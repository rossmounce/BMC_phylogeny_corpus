Abstract
Background: Chromatin in the nucleus of all eukaryotes is organized into a system of loops and domains. These loops
remain fastened at their bases to the fundamental framework of the nucleus, the matrix or the scaffold. The DNA
sequences which anchor the bases of the chromatin loops to the matrix are known as Scaffold/Matrix Attachment
Regions or S/MARs. Though S/MARs have been studied in yeast and higher eukaryotes and they have been found to be
associated with gene organization and regulation of gene expression, they have not been reported in protists like
Giardia. Several tools have been discovered and formulated to predict S/MARs from a genome of a higher eukaryote
which take into account a number of features. However, the lack of a definitive consensus sequence in S/MARs and the
randomness of the protozoan genome in general, make it a challenge to predict and identify such sequences from
protists.
Results: Here, we have analysed the Giardia genome for the probable S/MARs predicted by the available
computational tools; and then shown these sequences to be physically associated with the nuclear matrix. Our study
also reflects that while no single computational tool is competent to predict such complex elements from protist
genomes, a combination of tools followed by experimental verification is the only way to confirm the presence of
these elements from these organisms.
Conclusion: This is the first report of S/MAR elements from the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia. This initial work is
expected to lay a framework for future studies relating to genome organization as well as gene regulatory elements in
this parasite.
Background
Sequencing and annotation of the different genomes
done in the last couple of decades has clearly shown that
even the relatively compact eukaryotic genomes have
large amounts of non-coding DNA. This DNA harbors
elements that control genomic activity such as gene regulators, non-coding RNAs and less well characterized elements that position the chromosomes on the nuclear
matrix. The nuclear matrix forms a three dimensional
protein network onto which chromatin fibers are
attached. Interaction between chromatin and the nuclear
matrix is believed to occur at specific sites from 300 base

pairs (bp) to several kilobases (kb) long, termed scaffold/
matrix attachment regions (S/MAR) [1].
Experimentally, SMARs have been defined as either
DNA fragments that remain bound to the nuclear matrix
after chromatin proteins and other DNA are removed, or
DNA that binds to extracted nuclear matrix in the presence of competitor DNA [2,3]. Identification of S/MARs
is a necessary step for successful functional mapping of
nucleotide sequences, since these sites can bring genes
into association with the nuclear matrix and significantly
change transcription level, thus marking transcriptionally
active regions [4]. S/MAR elements play a major role in
genome organization and gene regulation. They have
been reported to alter the expression levels of some genes
depending on their position relative to the matrix [5]. S/

MARs have also been associated with enhanced transcription, particularly in transgene constructs where
flanking transgenes with S/MARs have resulted in higher
and more stable expression [6]. They have been associated as a boundary between functional chromatin
domains [7,8]. It is also reported that the effects of longrange enhancers may be restricted by the positioning of
S/MAR elements [9]. From the genome organization perspective, S/MARs have been implicated in the positioning of chromosomal territories [7,10].
Computational methods are thought to be prerequisite
for the analysis of whole genomes for predicting S/MARs
and though several tools like MarWiz [11-13], Marscan
[8], ChrClass [14], SMARtest [15] and SIDD [16,17] have
been developed for this purpose, prediction of S/MAR is
not conclusive unless it has been supported by experimental proof. The most common experimental method
for identifying S/MAR uses re-association assays to
define DNA fragments that bind to the nuclear matrix
[18]. South-western assays [19,20] and PCR based assays
[21] have also been used successfully to show S/MAR
binding to nuclear matrix.
Though S/MARs have been well studied in yeasts,
plants, mammalian systems and Drosophila, there has
been very few reports of these elements from the protists.
So far genome wide search for S/MARs have been carried
out in silico for Arabidopsis thaliana and C. elegans using
SMARTest and MRS finder respectively [22,23]. This
study had revealed that genes containing predicted S/
MARs had low transcription levels [22]. In C.elegans, S/
MARs were found to be the flanking coding regions [23].
Marfinder and Marscan have been used previously to
identify functional S/MAR elements in Entamoeba [19].
The genome of Giardia lamblia, the protozoan parasite
responsible for causing Giardiasis worldwide among people with poor fecal-oral hygiene, has been sequenced
recently [24]. The 11.7 Mb genome of this deep branching
eukaryote, distributed over 5 chromosomes showed an
exceedingly simple genome structure comprising of only
2 origin recognition complex proteins and total absence
of regulatory initiation proteins [24]. Moreover, Giardia
contained only 4 of the 12 transcription initiation factors
present in Saccharomyces [25]. As the genome of this
organism has been studied, very few regulatory elements

Page 2 of 13

were seen to be present in this parasite. Promoters had
been identified and characterized earlier [26-32] but
other regulatory elements like insulators, boundary elements enhancers and locus control regions were not
revealed in the genome sequencing project.
In this work, we have used all the available bioinformatics tools for predicting S/MARs from the genome of
Giardia lamblia and used PCR based, as well as southwestern assays to actually see how many of the predicted
S/MARs were able to bind to nuclear matrix. This is the
first ever report of S/MAR like DNA elements from this
gastrointestinal pathogen. In this paper we have also
reflected on how any single computational tools for prediction of S/MAR can be very inaccurate on the protozoan parasite genome, but a combination of different
tools along with laboratory based assays, give us a comprehensive idea about S/MAR distribution in Giardia
lamblia genome. Our studies show 10 S/MAR sequences
from Giardia lamblia which are associated with its
nuclear matrix proteins are can thus be regarded as S/
MAR elements.

Results
In silico prediction of putative S/MARs from Giardia genome
using existing tools

We used the available tools for identifying putative S/
MARs from Giardia genome. Currently, four such tools
are available: Marfinder [13], Marscan [8], Chrclass [14]
and SMARtest [15]. Some groups have also used SIDD
(Stress induced DNA Destabilization) for predicting S/
MAR regions [16]. However, as SIDD calculations do not
[yet] form the basis of an S/MAR predictor for wild type
S/MARs in genomic DNA as reflected by Evans et al [33],
we have not used it in our study. The results obtained
from these tools are summarized in Table 1.
SMARtest, which predominantly analyses S/MAR
based on the AT richness of the genome gave only 3 hits
in the Giardia genome. The average percentage of AT for
the predicted S/MAR regions using SMARtest is equal to
66.3%. Marscan, which predicts S/MAR regions based on
the presence of a bipartite signature, identifies 218 S/
MARs from the genome and predicted the average distance between two consecutive S/MARs to be ~50 kb.
MARfinder, which is by far the most widely used tool for

identifying S/MARs in mammalian and plant genome
predicts 66 putative S/MARs in the Giardia genome predicting an average distance of ~160 kb between two consecutive S/MARs and Chrclass, the tool based on
comparative analysis of various context characteristics
associated with S/MARs identifies 100 S/MARs from the
Giardia genome. A comparison of the results from the
different tools in determining the length of S/MARs in
the putative S/MAR regions and the distance between S/
MARs is demonstrated in Figure 1A Figure 1B and Table
1.
We used Marfinder to understand a complete picture of
the S/MAR distribution in the Giardia genome (see Figure. 1C). As this method looked into a varied number of
features associated with S/MARs (which included topoisomerase binding sites, DNA topology along with AT
richness). We trained the software on the negative dataset
reported in Evans et al [33] prior to running it on Giardia

genome. It was seen that the threshold value for a "MAR
potential" had to be modified from the default values to
50 in order to get a better noise to signal ratio. Using
these parameters on the Giardia genome, Marfinder predicted 66 putative S/MARs. Evans et al [33] has reviewed
the existing S/MAR prediction tools and has concluded
that no single tool is efficient enough to correctly predict
S/MARs even in higher eukaryotes. We thus assumed
that in protozoans with a much more "unstructured" and
random genome organizations, it would be more prudent
to use a combination of tools for the initial prediction of
S/MARs. We therefore compared the results from the
four different S/MAR predicting programs and selected
the S/MAR regions which were predicted by at least two
programs one of which was Marfinder (see Table 2). Total
of 15 such S/MAR regions were identified. The distribution of S/MARs as predicted by the 4 tools is shown in the
Venn diagram in Figure 1D. Primers were designed for all

length of the Giardia S/MARs. (A) and distance between two consecutive S/MARs (B). Efficient prediction of S/MAR prediction from Giardia genome is
achieved by using a combination of two or more tools. Marfinder was by far the best tool for prediction as seen in the profile (C). Marfinder was used
in combination with other S/MAR prediction tools for efficient predictions. Venn Diagram (D) shows the number of predictions obtained by the different tools.

of these 15 putative S/MARs (Additional file 1; Table S1)
for further analysis.
Organization of predicted S/MARs in Giardia

Of all the S/MARs predicted from the Giardia genome,
our analysis shows that about 30% of the S/MARs are
present in the upstream or downstream of ORFs and thus
in the intergenic region. 10% S/MARs overlapped with
ORFs either in the 5' or 3' region of the gene. Also, about
10% of S/MARs contained ORFs within themselves and
3% S/MARs were present within the ORFs. This distribution of S/MARs with respect to ORFs is shown in Figure
2A.

Of the 15 putative S/MARs, some were found to have
some interesting organization. GlSMAR7 (Figure 2B) was
found to have ORF of a reverse transcriptase endonuclease apart from a VSP and High Cysteine protein within
12 kb of it. Similar organization i.e presence of several
reverse transcriptase endonuclease was also noticed in
GlSMAR22 (Figure 2B) These ORFs are reported to be
present in the telomeric region of the chromosome in
Giardia [34]. The significance of the presence of these
elements in close proximity of such ORFs is beyond the
scope of current study. The 15 putative S/MARs were
then tested experimentally for their ability to bind to
nuclear matrix. The results are summarized in Table 2.

Giardia S/MAR like elements are present in the nuclear
matrix

To determine if Giardia S/MARs predicted by the bioinformatics search were indeed present in the nuclear
matrix, we performed a PCR based test [21]. The
extracted DNA from the nuclear matrix as well as the
supernatant released after EcoRI digestion (Figure 3A)
were used for polymerase chain amplification with the
primers (additional file 1, Table S1). It was seen that
GlSMAR10, GlSMAR11, GlSMAR20, GlSMAR66,
GlSMAR22, GlSMAR26-1, GlSMAR26-2, GlSMAR39,
GlSMAR42 and GlSMAR55 amplified at the expected
size (Figure 3B), whereas, no amplicon was seen from the
supernatant fraction. As positive control, these fragments
were also amplified from Giardia genomic DNA (Figure
3C). A non S/MAR DNA sequence was used as a negative
control (Figure 3D). This fragment was seen to be amplified from the loop fraction (Figure 3D Lane 1) and not
present in the attached fraction. (Figure 3D Lane 2).
Thus, at least 10 of the 15 Giardia S/MAR sequences predicted by the different computational tools were associated with Giardia nuclear matrix (Figure 3A). GlSMAR58

Giardia. Nuclear matrix dependent (A;Lane 1) and independent DNA

to [20 and used for PCR reactions with predicted S/MAR primers(B).

GlSMAR66, GlSMAR20, GlSMAR22, GlSMAR26-1, GlSMAR26-2,
GlSMAR39, GlSMAR42, GlSMAR51, GlSMAR55, GlSMAR58, in both panel
B and C. A non-S/MAR sequence was used as a control (PanelD). Amplification of multiple bands was seen in the matrix independent fraction (loop-fraction) lane 2 and no amplification was seen in the matrix
dependent fraction.

and GlSMAR16 did not amplify from this DNA pool as
they had EcoRI sites internal to the primer binding sites.
It was observed that GlSMAR 20 also had EcoRI sites in
the sequence. However, GlSMAR20 had its MAR potential peaks coinciding with this positions. It is therefore
possible that the EcoRI sites in GlSMAR20 are protected
from digestion as this region is actively involved in binding to the proteins in the nuclear matrix. However, this
can only be confirmed by further experimentation. It may
be noted that though the length of S/MARs in other
eukaryotes range from 300-700 bp, the Giardia S/MARs
were found to be longer. Fragments of 1.8-2.3 kb range
were amplified from the matrix associated DNA pool.
The exact length of DNA which is essential for the binding remains to be determined by further experimentation.
Giardia S/MARs bind to nuclear matrix proteins

Next, we tested the nuclear matrix associated putative S/
MAR sequences for their nuclear matrix binding by
chemiluminiscence. Common S/MARs predicted by the
bioinformatic tools were developed as probes. These S/
MARs were tested for their ability to bind to nuclear
matrix isolated from the organism. Nuclear matrix was
isolated according to the protocol of Kauffmann et al,
1991[35]. In this method, isolated nuclei were first
treated with DNAse to digest the DNA that was not associated with any proteins. The resulting pellet was then
extracted with 1.6 M NaCl to release the histones and
other high salt soluble proteins. This was followed up
with a detergent wash. The residual pellet, inextractible
by detergent or high salt was the nuclear matrix that was
used for the different experiments. Binding to the nuclear
matrix fraction was done by south western blotting [20].
It was seen that 8 of the 15 predicted S/MARs were able
to bind to nuclear matrix proteins (GlSMAR7,
GlSMAR10, GlSMAR16, GlSMAR20, GlSMAR22,
GlSMAR26-1, GlSMAR58 and GlSMAR66). All these 8
S/MARs were also seen to be associated with the nuclear
matrix in the PCR based assay. 4 of the S/MARs which
were seen to be associated with the nuclear matrix in the
PCR based assay did not show binding to nuclear matrix
in the south western assay (GlSMAR11, GlSMAR39,
GlSMAR42, GlSMAR55). This was probably because the
DNA binding motifs in the nuclear matrix were not
exposed to the probes in these cases. Alternately,
GlSMAR58 and GlSMAR16 showed binding to the
nuclear matrix by southwestern though it was not amplified from the matrix dependent pool in the PCR based
assay. This was because this S/MARs had Eco RI sites
internal to the primers that were used for amplifying the
S/MARs from the matrix dependent fraction. GlSMAR7
did not amplify in the PCR based assay, but it showed
binding to the nuclear matrix proteins in the south west-

ern assay. We checked the sequence for the presence of
EcoRI sites but could not find any. It is possible that the
template for the GlSMAR7 was too low in the matrix
dependent DNA pool to be amplified by the GlSMAR7
primers. When the probe was prepared for the south
western assay, it was thus able to bind to the protein in
the nuclear matrix. All S/MARs recognized proteins in
the Giardia nuclear matrix fraction ranging a molecular
weight of 17 kd-44 kd (Figure 4B a-g).
Mass Spectrometry of Giardia nuclear matrix protein

To verify whether any of the proteins recognized by the S/
MARs from Giardia were indeed resident nuclear matrix
proteins, we excised one band (44 kd) from the coomassie
stained gel which also bound to GlSMAR7 (Figure 4B a)
and went for mass spectrometric identification.
The obtained peaklist (Figure 5A) was analysed using
the web based analysis software MASCOT against the
NCBInr database as G.lamblia genomic database is not
present in MASCOT. The top score was that of a homologue of a tat-binding protein from Plasmodium chabaudi((Mr = ~20 kDa). The peptides identified in the
peaklist by MASCOT are shown in Figure 5B. When
searched against the Giardia database with the P. chabaudi protein sequence, as well as the individual peptides
from the MS data, a 26 S protease regulatory subunit 8 in
G.lamblia showed 63% identity with 79% homology (Mr
= 44 kDa) (Figure 5C). This protein complex is a known
resident nuclear matrix protein in higher eukaryotes [36]
and in G.lamblia, this subunit contains an AAA domain
of ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities. This
class of proteins belongs to the superfamily of ring
shaped P-loop ATPase [Figure. 5D]. These proteins exert
their activity through energy dependent unfolding of
macromolecules and are also reported to be involved in
regulation of gene expression [37,38].

Discussion
Giardia lamblia, is a diplomonad, with 2 nuclei and is
often referred to as a "deep branching eukaryote" as it
diverged out of the main evolutionary tree long before the
other eukaryotes. As a result, this oraganism has a number of unique features which have become more "organized" in the higher eukaryotes. One of the most unique
features of Giardia is its lack of organellar structures as
for example a well defined mitochondria, Golgi bodies
and endoplasmic reticulum, in spite of being an eukaryote. Traces of marker proteins from these organelles and
an amazingly developed membrane structure adept to
carry out these functions are however present here
enabling this organism to be classified as a eukaryote
[39].
Though the initials reports of nuclear matrix go as far
back as 1960's, the research on S/MARs as potential regu-

latory elements come from the works of J. Bode in 1988
[40,41]. Since then, throughout the eukaryotic world, the
S/MARs have been found to play a significant role in the
organization of chromatin, and gene regulation. Studies
on the recently sequenced Giardia genome have shown
the genome to be unique in its own way. The protist has 5
chromosomes, and almost 9000 ORFs packed into a small
genome of 12 Mb length. It has been seen that the parasite has no homolog for H1 which is the universal linker
for compacting chromatin in the nuclei [26]. In this scenario, the study of Scaffold/Matrix attachment region in

MALDI-TOF, showed distinct and sharp peptide profile in the mass spectrometric analysis (Panel A). The peptides obtained (panel B) were aligned with
the Giardia protein giving the closest hit (panel C). This protein, a proteasome 26 S subunit 8 had a conserved domain of AAA or ATPAse Associated
with diverse cellular Activities (Panel D).

this parasite can shed adequate light on the chromatin
organization in this organism. We did a preliminary
screen on the G.lamblia genome with available S/MAR
prediction tools. When the common regions predicted by
at least 2 tools were taken into consideration, we were
able to shortlist at least 15 putative S/MAR regions. To
prove this DNA fragments were indeed nuclear matrix
dependent fragments we did the PCR based assay, which
showed that 10 out of 15 putative S/MARs where actually
associated with the nuclear matrix of Giardia. This
showed that the false positive rate of our strategy was
about 33%. Assuming that the distance between the S/
MARs in this genome can range from 50-160 kb, as seen
in Table 1, we expect about 110 S/MARs in the entire
genome of Giardia. The combination of computational
tools correctly predicted only 10% of the total number of
the expected S/MARs. This indicates that the S/MAR
prediction tools that can be used with accuracy on the
higher eukaryotic genome, in most of the instances are
not very accurate in predicting lower eukaryotic S/
MARs. Experimental methods are an absolute necessity
in correctly identifying these elements from the lower
eukaryotic genomes. The computational tools for S/MAR
predictions can only be used as an initial screen for scanning the genome of the protists for presence or absence of
S/MARs, but the actual confirmation is achieved only by
experimental methods. Of the 10 S/MARs, 8 also showed
positive nuclear matrix binding property in south western blots. Among these, 7 S/MARs which showed positive binding both in PCR as well as south western assay
were indeed true S/MARs. It now remains to test these
Giardia S/MARs for chromosomal organization studies.
One of the major properties of S/MARs is chromosome
organization, anchoring and maintenance of higher order
structure [42]. This is achieved by the proteins in the
nuclear matrix which bind to the S/MARs thereby allowing it to carry out these functions. The proteins in the
nuclear matrix are involved in a host of different functions, including DNA replication and repair [43]. Of these
the S/MAR binding proteins are (S/MARBP) are of
utmost importance as they regulate transcription, replication, repair and regulation of gene expression [44]. One
of the GlSMARs, GlSMAR7 bound to a proteasome subunit 8 as shown by our mass spectrometry results. The 26
S proteasome is an eukaryotic ATP-dependent protease
complex of 2000 kd which is reported to be present in the
nuclear matrix in mouse myoblasts [36]. As seen in Figure 5, the conserved domain in the 26 S proteasome subunit 8 in Giardia was a AAA domain belonging to the
ATPase binding protein superfamily. These proteins perform a diverse range of functions in the cell starting vesicle fusion, peroxidase biogenesis [45] to DNA repair [46].
Thus it is not unlikely that this protein would be associated with S/MARs and have DNA binding properties.

There have been reports on the proteasome 20 S of Giardia lamblia [47,48], where Emmerlich et al showed the 14
subunits making up this proteasome structure. Though
the annotated genome of Giardia shows the presence of
several of the proteasome 26 S subunits, no detailed analysis has been done on these proteins in Giardia. A
detailed phylogenetic analysis of another AAA ATPase
domain containing protein Midasin has been studied by
Gallego et al. [49]. This protein is conserved thoughout
eukaryotes and plays the role of a nuclear chaperone in
most organisms. One of the proteins found to be associated with S/MARs from yeast to humans, is the SAF Box
domain containing protein. As reported by Kipp et al in
2000 [50], SAF-A binds to S/MARs through a novel conserved protein domain. A search in http://
www.eupathDB.org for proteins having the SAF box or
the SAP domain showed that 47 such proteins were present in the different protozoan genomes (Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Entamoeba and
Trichomonas). Thus it is likely that these genomes will
also have S/MAR like elements in their genome. However, when searched in the Giardia genome, this SAF/
SAP domain containing protein was not present. Our
experimental results discussed in this work indicate that
Giardia has S/MAR binding protein (26 S proteasome
subunit 8) which does not have a SAF/SAP domain, but
has nucleotide binding domains. While it is possible that
in a recently sequenced genome, this protein was not
annotated, it is also possible that Giardia placed much
earlier in the evolutionary scale probably has not yet
defined a machinery where these highly conserved
domain containing proteins may be present. The presence of S/MARs in Giardia and the absence of SAF box
proteins in this organism may also indicate that the early
divergence of Giardia during evolution probably .resulted
in "missing out" this very conserved protein involved in
nuclear architecture.
S/MARs have been found to be associated with not
only chromatin anchoring but also with other regions of
the genome as introns [51] and can play a significant role
in the regulation of gene expression [52,53]. Studies on S/
MAR in Arabidopsis and maize [54,55] have shown that
the plant genome is not packaged by random gathering
into domains of indiscriminate length, but rather, the
genome is gathered into specific domains, and a gene
consistently occupies a discrete physical section of the
genome. The average loop size in Arabidopsis and maize
has been estimated as 25 and 45 kb, respectively [55],
though other studies [8] have suggested smaller domain
sizes. Some loops may remain permanently condensed
and inactive, even within the euchromatic portions of the
genome, whereas others can be extended to produce a
transcriptionally poised conformation in appropriately
differentiated cells [56]. Our analysis for a genome-wide

Padmaja et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:386
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/386

distribution of S/MARs using different tools indicates
that the loop size ranges from 50-160 kbp in Giardia
(Table 1). Data on the location of transcribed elements
within structural loops at the supragenic level suggest
that attachment to the matrix and transcription is not
systematically associated [57,58], though S/MARs are
associated with the ends of some DNaseI-sensitive (transcriptionally poised) domains [59]. S/MARs have also
been identified within introns of genes [60,61]. Cockerill
et al. [60] suggested that S/MARs flanking enhancer
sequences may act as positive and/or negative regulators
of enhancer function. It is presumed that additional specific S/MARs have been further demonstrated in a variety
of functional tests to act as insulators [61], according to
the loop domain model, by protecting a loop from the
effects of the neighboring chromatin or associated
enhancer sequences. Distribution of Giardia S/MARs
among the transcription factors also hints at this possibility (data not shown). A much more in-depth study of the
S/MARs in lower eukaryotes is required to understand
the chromatin dynamics and packing in these organisms.
An observation was made in the study by Linnemann et
al in 2009[62], where it was seen that the S/MARs when
present in the 5' region of a gene resulted in a transcript
presence, where as those present within the ORF associated with silenced genes. A number of S/MARs in Giardia were also found within the ORFs. The significance of
this is not clear. In Entamoeba, such S/MARs were found
to have reduced binding ability to nuclear matrix compared to the ones that were present outside ORF (our
unpublished data). It is possible that in these early
eukaryotes, the genome organization machinery is also in
early stages of evolution and the S/MARs within the
ORFs are actually the ones which in course of evolution
would lose their ability to bind to the nuclear matrix completely.

Conclusions
Though analysis of S/MAR on large genomic sequences
are being done [63-65], S/MAR regions of protists have
never really come to the limelight. Study on the S/MARs
in these organisms is of significance in the understanding
their gene organization and regulation. The multiple
roles played by these S/MARs starting from chromosome
organization to promoter control, acting as domain barriers, make them important regulatory elements which
have not received much focus yet. Most of the prediction
tools are designed with the structurally organized higher
eukaryotic genome in mind. A comparison of these tools
reveal that no single tool is accurate enough to predict the
S/MARs even from an organism with a well defined
genome structure [33]. In case of lower eukaryotes, these
tools do identify the S/MARs, but with much less accuracy. Our study clearly indicated that even if we take into

Page 10 of 13

consideration all the available tools for predicting S/
MARs from protozoan parasites, they have to be verified
experimentally for their ability to be associated with the
nuclear matrix. Studies like this, also indicate the need to
modify and develop more dedicated tools for the prediction of these elements from such divergent genomes,
which in turn would help to study gene organization and
gene regulation in a much wider scale in these protozoans.

Methods
Bioinformatic tools for prediction of S/MARs

G. lamblia genome sequences available at http://
www.Giardiadb.org were used for all analysis. S/MAR
analysis was done according to the available S/MAR analysis tools - Marfinder (downloaded from http://genomecluster.secs.oakland.edu/marwiz/) SMARTEST (http://
www.genomatix.de/smartest.html), Marscan (EMBOSS)
and
Chrclass
(http://ftp.bionet.nsc.ru/pub/biology/
chrclass/chrclas2.zip). The tools and the description of
the datasets as well as the parameter information were
done according to Evans et al [25], with modifications
wherever required.
Giardia cell culture

Giardia lamblia strain WB1267 was cultured axenically
in TYI-S media supplemented with 10% Adult Bovine
serum (Invitrogen) and 1 mg/ml of bovine bile (Sigma) in
50 ml culture flasks. Parasites were routinely subcultured
every 48-72 hours when confluent. Cells were harvested
for nuclear matrix isolation by chilling on ice for 20 mins
followed by harvesting at 2000 rpm for 5 min in extraction buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 6.8; 24 mM KCl; 10 mM
MgCl2) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma, USA).
Genomic DNA, Designing primers and PCR

Giardia lamblia (strain WB1267) genomic DNA was prepared from confluent Giardia cultures using the
Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Sigma) according to the
manufacturers instruction. Primers were designed
against the predicted S/MAR sequences (details in additional file 1; Table S1) and supplied by Ocimum Biosolutions, India. Putative S/MARs were amplified from the G.
lamblia genome by Polymerase Chain Reaction using Taq
polymerase (NEB, USA).2 ng G.lamblia genomic DNA
was used as a template. DNA was denatured at 95Â°C for 5
min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95Â°C for 30
s, annealing at 55Â°C for 45 s and extension at 72Â°Cfor 30 s.
Final extension of 72Â°C was kept for 7 min. Amplicons
were sequenced to confirm the genomic sequence.
Synthesis of probes for hybridization

The purified PCR products were used as templates for
the labeling reaction. Biotinylated dNTPs (NEB) and

Padmaja et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:386
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/386

NEBlot Kit (NEB) was used to label the probes for chemiluminiscent detection. The reaction for synthesis of
probes was done according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Isolation of nuclear matrix

1. Cultured G. lamblia cells were harvested at 2000 rpm
and washed once in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The
cells were lysed in Extraction buffer (10 mM HEPESKOH(pH 7.2), 24 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM E64
(trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), a protease inhibitor; 1 mM, PMSF, 2 mM
DTT, 0.03%NP-40). The lysate was loaded on a cushion of
Extraction buffer containing 0.8 M sucrose and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 minutes. The nuclei were recovered in the pellet.
Nuclear matrices were prepared by treatment of the
isolated nuclei with 50 U of DNase I at 37Â°C for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes [18]. The
pellet was then washed twice with Low Salt Buffer (LSB)
containing 10 mM HEPES-KOH(pH 7.2), 0.2 mM MgCl2,
10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol followed by treatment with
High Salt Buffer (HSB) containing 1.6 M NaCl, 10 mM
HEPES-KOH(pH 7.2), 0.2 mM MgCl2,10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 4Â°C for 15 minutes. The insoluble nuclear matrix proteins were separated from the
high salt extractable proteins by centrifugation at 6000
rpm for 10 minutes. The final pellet was further washed
with 0.5% Triton-X 100. All fractions were prepared in
SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer and separated on a 10%
SDS-PAGE.
PCR-based assay for S/MAR binding

Nuclear matrix was isolated from G.lamblia cells as
described above. For the PCR based assay the protocol of
Kramer [20] was used with modifications. Briefly, Giardia nuclei were washed once with LSB and then treated
with HSB and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following
incubation, the reaction mix was centrifuged at 6000 rpm
and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed
once again with LSB followed by 1 Ã restriction enzyme
buffer for EcoR1. The pellet was then digested with EcoR1
for 2 hrs at 37Â°C. Following digestion, the reaction tube
was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected in a fresh tube. The residual pellet
(nuclear matrix) and the supernatant were subjected to
phenol: chloroform (1:1; v/v) treatment and the extracted
DNA from both fractions were precipitated with equal
volume of isopropanol. 2 ng of the extracted DNA was
next used as a template for PCR for the different predicted S/MAR sequences in Giardia.
South western hybridization for detecting nuclear matrixS/MAR association

The protein fractions separated by SDS-PAGE were
transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was

Page 11 of 13

blocked with 3% non-fat skimmed milk in containing 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (Standard Binding Buffer; SBB) for 2 hours. After three washes
of 15 minutes with SBB the membrane was incubated
overnight at 4Â°C with the biotinylated DNA probes.
Unbound probe was washed with SBB followed by incubation with Streptavidin conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (Sigma 1:500 dilution) for 1 hour. Excess
Streptavidin -HRP was washed with the same buffer. The
DNA binding ability was then detected with an enzyme
catalyzed light emitting reaction using Super Signal West
Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce 34082)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. The membrane was then exposed to CL-Xposure films (Pierce
34092) and the emitted light was captured on the film.
Sample preparation for proteomic analysis of Giardia
nuclear matrix protein

A major band around 44 kDa was excised from the gel
and sent to Syngene International, Bangalore, India for
proteomic analysis.
The sample processing was done by the CRO according
to standard methods. Briefly, the gel bands supplied were
washed with water and chopped into ~1 mm cubes and
washed with 50 mM NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile mixture
(1:1) for 15 min and washing solution was aspirated completely. Sufficient acetonitrile was added to cover the gel
particles following above the washing step. Acetonitrile
was removed after 2 min and gel pieces were re-hydrated
in 50 mM NH4HCO3. After 5 min, an equal volume of
acetonitrile was added and incubated for 15 min followed
by complete removal of all solvents. Gel pieces were covered by enough acetonitrile to effect shrinking of gel
pieces. Following shrinkage of gel pieces, acetonitrile was
removed and gel particles were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For reduction and alkylation, the gel particles were
allowed to swell in 50 mM NH4HCO3, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated for 45 min at 56Â°C in a water
bath followed by cooling to room temperature. Excess liquid was removed and replaced with freshly prepared 50
mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM NH4HCO3 followed by
incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
Excess iodoacetamide solution was removed and gel particles were washed twice with 50 mM NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile mixture (1:1). Each washing was carried out for
15 min. Gel pieces were allowed to dehydrate in acetonitrile followed by vacuum drying. For in-gel digestion,
gel pieces were rehydrated in 20 ng/ul Trypsin (Sigma)
solution prepared in 25 mM NH4HCO3 at 37Â°C for 30
min.25 mM NH4HCO3 was added to the reaction mixture
so that the gels remained completely submerged. Digestion was allowed to proceed at 37Â°C for 16 h.
Following digestion, the peptides were extracted by
adding extraction buffer (50% acetonitrile containing
0.1% TFA) to cover the gel pieces followed by sonication.

MALDI matrix preparation and MALDI-MS Analysis

Saturated solution of Alpha-cayano-4-hydroxy cinnamic
acid was prepared using 30% acetonitrile containing
0.1%TFA to prepare the matrix for MALDI. Undissolved
matrix particles were removed by centrifugation. Equal
amount of sample and matrix were mixed in a microfuge
tube and spotted on MALDI-target plate and the mixture
was allowed to dry at room temperature.
MALDI spectra were acquired in an AUTOFLEX III
SMARTBEAM MALDI-MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). External calibration was done with peptide calibration standard supplied by Bruker, with masses
ranging from 1046 Da-3147 Da. All the spectra were
acquired in Reflectron +ve ion mode with an average of
2000 laser shots. Mass detection range was set between
m/z 800-3500. Acquisition software used was FlexControl version 3 and Analysis software used was FlexAnlaysis version3. Analysis of the peaklist obtained was done
using the web based analysis software MASCOT using
the NCBInr database. All the default parameters of MASCOT were maintained for analysis.
