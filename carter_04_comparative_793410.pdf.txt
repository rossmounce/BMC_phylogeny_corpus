Abstract
Based on the number of tissues separating maternal from fetal blood, placentas are classified as
epitheliochorial, endotheliochorial or hemochorial. We review the occurrence of these placental
types in the various orders of eutherian mammals within the framework of the four superorders
identified by the techniques of molecular phylogenetics. The superorder Afrotheria diversified in
ancient Africa and its living representatives include elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvark, elephant
shrews and tenrecs. Xenarthra, comprising armadillos, anteaters and sloths, diversified in South
America. All placentas examined from members of these two oldest superorders are either
endotheliochorial or hemochorial. The superorder Euarchontoglires includes two sister groups,
Glires and Euarchonta. The former comprises rodents and lagomorphs, which typically have
hemochorial placentas. The most primitive members of Euarchonta, the tree shrews, have
endotheliochorial placentation. Flying lemurs and all higher primates have hemochorial placentas.
However, the lemurs and lorises are exceptional among primates in having epitheliochorial
placentation. Laurasiatheria, the last superorder to arise, includes several orders with
epitheliochorial placentation. These comprise whales, camels, pigs, ruminants, horses and
pangolins. In contrast, nearly all carnivores have endotheliochorial placentation, whilst bats have
endotheliochorial or hemochorial placentas. Also included in Laurasiatheria are a number of
insectivores that have many conserved morphological characters; none of these has
epitheliochorial placentation. Consideration of placental type in relation to the findings of
molecular phylogenetics suggests that the likely path of evolution in Afrotheria was from
endotheliochorial to hemochorial placentation. This is also a likely scenario for Xenarthra and the
bats. We argue that a definitive epitheliochorial placenta is a secondary specialization and that it
evolved twice, once in the Laurasiatheria and once in the lemurs and lorises.

Introduction
Early in mammalian development, the conceptus differentiates into an inner cell mass and an outer sphere of
cells, the trophoblast. The latter contributes solely to the
extra-embryonic membranes. The tissues of the embryo
are all derived from the inner cell mass as are the amnion
and major components of the yolk sac and allantois. The
yolk sac endoderm may soon become apposed to the tro-

phoblast, but this two layered structure (the bilaminar
omphalopleure) is not regarded as a true placenta. Efficient maternal-fetal exchange first becomes possible when
mesoderm is interposed between the endoderm and trophoblast, carrying with it branches of the vitelline vessels.
Together these tissues form the choriovitelline or yolk sac
placenta (trilaminar omphalopleure). Somewhat later,
the allantois grows into the exocoelom and expands until

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2004, 2:46

it comes into contact with the trophoblast. The chorioallantoic placenta is formed of trophoblast and allantois
and is vascularized by the allantoic or umbilical vessels. In
some mammals, the allantois displaces the yolk sac from
the trophoblast, so that yolk sac placentation is succeeded
by chorioallantoic placentation (Figure 1). Some mammals, including man, form only a chorioallantoic placenta. In still others, notably rodents and lagomorphs, the
yolk sac placenta persists until term. There is then partial
or complete inversion of the germ layers such that yolk sac
endoderm forms a maternal-facing absorptive epithelium
(inverted yolk sac placenta).
In marsupials, the separation of embryonic and trophoblastic areas of the blastocyst is less distinct than in eutherians [1]. Most marsupials form only a yolk sac placenta,
although bandicoots do have an additional chorioallantoic placenta. Nevertheless, it has been argued that the
allantochorion is an ancestral character present in the
stem species of marsupials and that the yolk sac became
predominant during evolution of the marsupial placenta
[2]. Extra-embryonic membranes participate in maternalfetal exchange in many non-mammalian vertebrates, too,
as detailed in several recent publications [3-5]. However,
the present review will be restricted to placentation in
eutherian mammals.
The interhemal area
The trophoblast sometimes but not always invades the
uterine wall displacing and/or replacing one or more
layers of tissue. Grosser's classification of placentas [6],
based on the number of tissues separating maternal from
fetal blood, has had an enormous influence [7]. According to whether the trophoblast is apposed to uterine epithelium, the endothelium of maternal vessels, or directly
to maternal blood, placentas are classified as, respectively,
epitheliochorial, endotheliochorial or hemochorial. Nevertheless, once placentas could be studied at the
ultrastructural level, it became apparent that this classification is of limited functional significance, since extensive
thinning of the tissues reduces the diffusion distance
between fetal and maternal blood even in epitheliochorial
placentas [8]. At the same time, studies of placental
ultrastructural made it clear that there were many variations in the structure of the interhemal area (Table 1).

The list in Table 1 by no means exhausts the known
number of placental types. Many placentas have specialized areas concerned with histiotrophic nutrition, that is,
absorption of secretions from the uterine glands or phagocytosis of cellular debris. A large number have hemophagous regions in which maternal erythrocytes are taken up
as a source of iron for the fetus. There are often large areas
that seem to be concerned more with protein synthesis
than materno-fetal exchange, as they are not penetrated

http://www.rbej.com/content/2/1/46

by fetal blood vessels; examples are the spongy zones of
rodent and hyrax placentas. Not surprisingly, there are
many variations in placental shape, from the diffuse and
cotyledonary forms in hoofed mammals through the circumferential ("zonary") placenta of carnivores to the
familiar discoid form of the human or mouse placenta.
Phylogenetic perspectives
Clearly each placental type is able to support a successful
pregnancy. Nevertheless, students of placental structure
have continued to ask why there is so much variability
and how the placenta evolved. The debate started with
Huxley and Owen in the nineteenth century (reviewed by
Pijnenborg and Vercruysse [9]), continued with Wislocki
[10] and Portmann [11], and culminated with the publications of Mossman [12,13] and Luckett [14]. The success
of molecular phylogenetics in identifying the relations
between the orders of mammals allows us to view placental structure from a new perspective [15,16]. It appears
that all extant eutherian mammals can be classed in four
superorders. These have been named Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria [17,18].
Accordingly, the approach taken here will be to review
placentation in each superorder in turn.

Placentation in the Afrotheria
This superorder was proposed following analysis of DNA
sequence data. It includes six orders of mammals. Three of
these, elephants, sea cows and hyraxes, were already considered to be closely related. Inclusion of the elephant
shrews and the aardvark is not controversial. There has,
however, been some debate about the sixth order, Tenrecomorpha or Afrosoricida, which comprises the golden
moles and tenrecs. This is in part because analysis of morphological characters fails to reveal a single synapomorphy in support of Afrotheria [19].
Placentation in the African elephant has been well studied
[20-23]. The placenta is of the circumferential type, forming a broad equatorial band, but is attached to the uterus
by only a narrow hilus. There is now information on the
fine structure of the interhemal area [23]. It is endotheliochorial with the maternal blood vessels closely invested
by cellular trophoblast. The basement membrane of the
maternal endothelial cells is thickened, but is pierced by
narrow processes from the trophoblast cells. On the fetal
side, these are deeply indented by fetal capillaries, reducing the diffusion distance between maternal and fetal
blood (Figure 2A). Beneath the labyrinth is a zone of cellular trophoblast that is actively phagocytic [20]. Of particular note is the persistence of a large allantoic sac
divided into four compartments by septa that carry
branches of the umbilical vessels.

also tend to have discoid, hemochorial placentas. In elephant shrews and tenrecs, there is an additional circumferential area or paraplacenta [31,33]. We examined the
interhemal area of the Madagascar lesser hedgehog tenrec
and found that it comprised a single layer of cellular trophoblast similar to the rock hyrax (Figure 2B) [33]. In the
otter shrews, the only tenrecs found on mainland Africa,
the situation is more complex. There appears to be a circumferential, endotheliochorial placenta (Enders, Carter
and Vogel, unpublished data). The giant otter shrew has
the four-lobed allantoic sac found in all the other orders
of Afrotheria [34].
Many of the placentas of afrotherians have hemophagous
regions (Table 2). These are very prominent in the tenrecs
[33], found at the margins of the placenta in elephants
and aardvark [20,26], and distributed across the surface of
the placenta sea cows [24]. Hemophagous regions are
absent in hyraxes, elephant shrews and golden moles, all
of which have hemochorial placentation.

Figure 1
Eutherian fetal membranes
Eutherian fetal membranes. The embryo is enclosed in the
amnion. Trophoblast (blue) and mesoderm (red) form the
chorion. Trophoblast and yolk sac endoderm (yellow)
together constitute a bilaminar omphalopleure. A choriovitelline or yolk sac placenta is then formed by interposition
of mesoderm containing fetal blood vessels. Later the allantois expands into the exocoelom and the allantoic and chorionic mesoderm fuse to form a chorioallantoic placenta. The
allantois will continue to expand into the exocoelom and
eventually displace the yolk sac. The full sequence of events is
seen most clearly in species with epitheliochorial placentation, such as horse and pig, although this cartoon is based on
the rock hyrax (reference [82]).

All these features are apparent in the placenta and fetal
membranes of the manatee [24], rock hyrax (Figure 2C)
[25] and aardvark [26,27]. However, whilst the aardvark
and possibly the manatee [13] have endotheliochorial
placentation, the rock hyrax placenta is hemomonochorial. The single layer of trophoblast in the interhemal barrier is cellular not syncytial [28]. One could thus envisage
how this arrangement could be derived from an endotheliochorial placenta such as that of the African elephant.
Elephant shrews have a discoid placenta. It is hemochorial
and the trophoblast in the barrier may be syncytial [29],
although this needs to be re-examined. Elephant shrews
do share the large, four-lobed allantoic sac with other
afrotherians [30,31]. Golden moles [32] and tenrecs [33]

Nothing is known about early development in sea cows,
but an extensive choriovitelline placenta is formed in all
other orders of Afrotheria. Following establishment of the
chorioallantoic placenta, however, the yolk sac is very
much reduced.
Based on current knowledge of placentation in the extant
species, it seems possible that the common ancestor of the
Afrotheria had the following features. (1) A circumferential, endotheliochorial placenta as in the elephant, manatee, aardvark and otter shrews. Loss of maternal
endothelium would lead to the hemochorial condition
seen in rock hyraxes, elephant shrews and some tenrecs.
The formation in elephant shrews and tenrecs of a discoid
placenta with a more or less extensive paraplacenta would
also be a derived state. (2) A prominent hemophagous
organ as in otter shrews and tenrecs, retained in elephants,
aardvark and manatee, but lost in rock hyraxes and elephant shrews. (3) A four-lobed allantoic sac, retained in
otter shrews and all other Afrotheria, but seemingly lost in
some members of Tenrecomorpha. (4) A short cord sending four leashes of vessels to the placenta.

Placentation in Xenarthra
This superorder is thought to have evolved in South America during the geographical isolation of this subcontinent
in the Cretaceous period. The close association of armadillos with American anteaters and sloths is apparent
from analyses of morphological characters and is strongly
supported by molecular phylogenetics [35]. In all three
orders, the embryo develops within a simplex uterus. Placentation has been most thoroughly examined in some
species of armadillo. In the nine-banded armadillo the
placental villi enter a series of maternal venous sinuses in

the fundic region of the uterus [36,37]. The villi then
spread within the sinuses in the body of the uterus, and
the villi that were initially in the fundic region degenerate.
Thus the placenta starts as discoid, then appears to be zonary. However the allantoic vessels of the four quadruplets
vascularize different areas of the zonary band. The placental villi are similar to those of primates in having an outer
layer of syncytial trophoblast in contact with maternal
blood (Figure 3B); they differ however in having the
cytotrophoblast confined to the growing tips of the villi
rather than as a Langhans layer. Little is known about placentation in anteaters except that they have a hemochorial
placenta and greatly enlarged fetal mesenchymal cells in
the villi in late pregnancy, as do the armadillos. As
pointed out by Benirschke [38], it is difficult to compare
the anteaters to other xenarthrans because of the absence
of fine structural studies of this group.
The sloth placenta differs in several respects from that of
anteaters and armadillos. It is diffuse in early stages but
later becomes discoid or even double discoid. The
exchange area is labyrinthine, not villous, and the interhemal area is endotheliochorial (Figure 3A). It consists of
hypertrophied maternal endothelial cells; a small amount
of extracellular material and spindle-shaped cells of presumed maternal origin; a layer of syncytial trophoblast
that although thick is fenestrated; and the fetal capillary
endothelium. In addition, the fetal connective tissue contains hypertrophied mesenchymal cells similar to those in
the armadillo and anteater, but also found in shrews and
tree shrews; these cells are characterized by abundant
granular endoplasmic reticulum [39].

Sloths; shrews (insectivores)
Carnivores and pinnipeds
Elephants; some sciuromorph rodents (Dipodomys,
Microdipodops); some bats (Natalus, Saccopteryx)
Lower primates; pangolin; some artiodactyls (e.g. pig)
Equids (perissodactyls, e.g. horse)
Ruminants (artiodactyls, e.g. sheep, cow)

In contrast to the afrotherians, xenarthrans have only a
rudimentary allantoic sac. However, the armadillos have
large inverted yolk sacs that persist well into gestation. Little is known about yolk sac placentation in anteaters. It is
doubtful that sloths have a choriovitelline placenta since
in late gestation the yolk sac is small and rudimentary.
Since the hemochorial placenta of the armadillo is not
preceded by an endotheliochorial condition and the placenta of armadillos and anteaters differs from that of the
sloths, it is not clear which might be considered more
derived. It is notable, however, that epitheliochorial placentation is not encountered in Xenarthra or Afrotheria,
the superorders considered closest to the root of the eutherian tree [17].

Placentation in Euarchontoglires
The Superorder Euarchontoglires or Superprimates comprises two sister groups. Glires unites rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits and pikas). The Euarchonta include three
orders: primates, flying lemurs and tree shrews
Placentation in Glires
The rodent order is so rich in species that only a small
sample of placentas has been described [40]. However,
the placentas of rodents and lagomorphs tend to conform
to a basic pattern. They are discoid to spherical in shape,
the exchange area is labyrinthine and hemochorial, and
there is a well developed spongy zone. An inverted or partially inverted yolk sac placenta supports the early development of the embryo and is retained until term.

There are three principal types of interhemal area in Glires
[41-43]. Hystricomorph rodents, such as the guinea pig

and capybara, have hemomonochorial placentas with a
single layer of syncytial trophoblast in the interhemal
barrier. So do the sciuromorph rodents or squirrels (Figure 4B). In lagomorphs the placenta is hemodichorial
with an outer layer of syncytial and inner layer of cellular
trophoblast. In most myomorph rodents the interhemal
area is hemotrichorial (Figure 4A). Although the outer
layer is cellular, it contains large pores and the inner layers
of syncytial trophoblast are thought to constitute the placental barrier [44].

There are some notable exceptions. The kangaroo rats
Dipodomys and Microdipodops are sciuromorph rodents,
but in this family (Heteromyidae) the interhemal area is
endotheliochorial and contains cellular trophoblast (Figure 4D) [45]. In two families of myomorph rodents, jerboas (Dipodidae) and jumping mice (Zapodidae), there
is a reduction in the trophoblast layers and the maternal
blood channels are lined by trophoblastic giant cells (Figure 4C) [46].

In most rodent placentas the labyrinth and spongy zone
form distinct layers. In hystricomorph rodents, however,
folding gives rise to a lobed placenta. The lobes are the
exchange areas and they are separated by interlobular trophoblast that is the equivalent of a spongy zone. In addition, hystricomorphs have a unique structure of unknown
function, the subplacenta [47].
Rodents represent the only order of eutherian mammals
for which placentation has been subjected to a strict cladistic analysis. Mess [43] concluded that the stem pattern
was labyrinthine and hemochorial with a single layer of
syncytial trophoblast in the exchange area. She did not
extend this analysis to include the lagomorphs. It is pertinent to note that, on this analysis, the mouse placenta represents an elaboration of the stem pattern. This has
potential implications for discussion of structural and
functional homologies between mouse and human placentas [48,49].
Placentation in Euarchonta
Ever since the seminal work of Hill [50], the evolution of
placentation in primates has posed some interesting questions [51]. Clearly there is a striking difference between
the lemurs and lorises (Strepsirhini) and other primates
(Haplorhini). The former have epitheliochorial and the
latter hemochorial placentation. The recognition that tree
shrews were closely related to primates, which receives
further support from molecular studies, adds a further
layer of complexity, since tree shrews (Scandentia) have
endotheliochorial placentas [52]. Finally Hill, who
regarded hemochorial placentation as the derived state,
opined that it had evolved separately in the tarsiers than
in the monkeys and apes.

The colugos or flying lemurs (Dermoptera) have attracted
less attention. Molecular phylogeneticists group them
with primates and tree shrews, although the relations
between the three orders are not well resolved [53]. Their
placenta has been little studied. It is discoid and appears
to contain labyrinthine and villous areas. The interhemal
area is hemodichorial [13].
In contrast, the fetal membranes of tree shrews have been
well studied [52,54] and were included in an early cladistic analysis by Luckett [55]. Tree shrews have a quite distinctive form of endotheliochorial placentation (Figure
5B), involving twin discoid attachments to special pads
developed on the lining of the uterus. Conserved features
of their fetal membranes include retention of a large allantoic vesicle and a large yolk sac [55].
Lemurs and lorises present a curious case in that they have
diffuse, non-deciduate and epitheliochorial placentas
(Figure 5A). The resemblance to placentation in pigs

http://www.rbej.com/content/2/1/46

extends to the presence of thickened areas of trophoblast
opposite the openings of the uterine glands [50], which
parallel the areolae of the porcine placenta. There is a large
allantoic vesicle, which is lobed as in the afrotherians. A
temporary yolk sac placenta supports development of the
early embryo.
Tarsiers have a discoid, hemochorial placenta. Except that
it is labyrinthine rather than villous, the placenta is
generally similar to that of monkeys and apes. The allantois is not vesicular, as in lemurs, but forms an almost
solid connecting stalk of mesodermal tissue as in higher
primates, a point to which Hill [50] attached particular
importance.
There are strong resemblances in the early development of
the platyrrhine or New World monkeys, the catarrhine
monkeys of the Old World and the anthropoid apes.
However, in platyrrhine monkeys, proliferation of the trophoblast continues until much later in gestation and connections persist between the villi, which form a trabecular
network, not unlike that of the tarsier placenta. Only at a
late stage of fetal development are branched villi found
within a more or less continuous intervillous space. In
catarrhine monkeys, on the other hand, arborescent chorionic villi are present from a very early stage, as they are in
the human placenta. Although macaque and baboon
implantation sites develop â sequentially â trophoblastic
plate, lacunar and villous stages as do the anthropoid
apes, in the former animals trophoblast taps maternal vessels early and the lacunae expand the placenta into the
uterine lumen [56]. Macaques also form a secondary placenta on the opposite side of the uterus from the original
implantation. In man and anthropoid apes the trophoblast proceeds further into the uterus and the abembryonic
as well as the polar trophoblast forms lacunae, resulting in
an interstitial placenta. In all of these animals the definitive placenta is discoidal with free and anchoring villi and
an intervillous space perfused by maternal blood (Figure
5C).
Based on their diffuse, non-deciduate and epitheliochorial placentation, Hill [50] argued that the lemurs and
lorises were a more primitive form of primate than the tarsiers. This argument went to the very heart of the current
debate about parallelism in the evolution of the placenta.
Many found it difficult to accept that rodents, insectivores
and primates arose from a common stem with a diffuse
type of placentation. Among the doubters was Wislocki
[10], who advanced the view that hemochorial placentation was the more primitive type of placentation and that
the epitheliochorial placenta of the lemurs was the result
of a secondary simplification.

A lucid discussion of the evolution of placentation in primates is given by Luckett [55]. He noted that there is substantial homology in fetal membrane development
between taxa with epitheliochorial placentation, but not
between those with the endotheliochorial or hemochorial
types. He argued that this was indicative of convergent
evolution of hemochorial placentation, whereas the epitheliochorial type was part of the primitive eutherian
condition.
On the grounds of parsimony, one might argue that the
widespread occurrence of hemochorial placentation in
Euarchonta reflects their common ancestry and follow
Wislocki [10] in regarding the epitheliochorial placenta of
strepsirhine primates as a derived state. Tree shrews have
many conserved characters and it is possible that endotheliochorial placentation is one of these rather than being
derived from a hemochorial type.

Placentation in Laurasiatheria
Many types of placentation are found in the Superorder
Laurasiatheria. Not surprisingly for an order that has
undergone such a high degree of adaptive radiation, the
greatest diversity is found among the bats. The insectivores now included in Eulipotyphla also present a variety
of placental types. Carnivores and pinnipeds have
endotheliochorial placentation. The three remaining
orders have epitheliochorial placentas. These are the
whales and cloven-hoofed mammals (Cetartiodactyla);
horses, tapirs and rhinoceroses (Perissodactyla); and pangolins (Pholidota).
Core insectivores
The order of insectivores has undergone steady attrition,
the most recent exclusions being the tenrecs and golden
moles. The relations between the core insectivores
(shrews, moles, hedgehogs and Solenodon) continue to
puzzle even the molecular phylogeneticists [57,58]. Most
have discoid labyrinthine placentae. The interhemal area
is hemochorial in hedgehogs and Solenodon [59]. The
American mole Scalopus has a circumferential placenta
that is considered to be epitheliochorial [60], whereas the
European mole Talpa is definitely endotheliochorial [61].
However, Prasad et al. [60] had only a single midgestation
specimen to examine by electron microscopy, and the
looping arrangement of the maternal vessels is more similar to that seen in endotheliochorial placentas than that
in typical epitheliochorial placentas. In the short-tailed
shrew Blarina the interhemal area is endotheliochorial,
but the trophoblast component is fenestrated [62]. In the
musk shrew Suncus the placenta is endotheliochorial, but
there is progressive thinning and fenestration of the
trophoblast layer [63]. There are even areas where processes from the two endothelial layers contact one another
through the pores in the trophoblast.

All insectivores have a partially or completely inverted
yolk sac that is maintained to term. The allantoic sac is
large in Talpa, medium sized in the hedgehog, small in
Scalopus and small or rudimentary in shrews. This is a
group of mammals that would repay close study using
modern techniques.
Bats
As befits a widely diversified adaptive group of mammals
[64], bats and especially microbats have evolved a multitude of endotheliochorial and hemochorial placental
types (Table 1; reviewed by Badwaik and Rasweiler [65]).
The most common type of definitive placenta is the
hemodichorial placenta, where syncytial trophoblast that
has intrasyncytial bays fronts the maternal blood space
and is underlain by cytotrophoblast (Figure 6A). Endotheliochorial placentas are found both as a diffuse placenta in
midpregnancy and as a cellular endotheliomonochorial
discoid placenta in late pregnancy (Figure 6B). In some
mollosid bats the central area of the placenta near term is
cellular hemomonochorial (Figure 6C). Megabats (fruit
eating bats) have hemochorial placentas with Rousettus
having a syncytial hemomonochorial type and Pteropus
having a hemodichorial one, at least in midpregnancy.
Although 13 of the 18 families of bats have been studied
[65], there is still a great deal to be learned both about the
fine structure and about other advanced features of membrane development [14].
Carnivores and pinnipeds
The terrestrial carnivores and their aquatic relatives the
pinnipeds (sea lions, walruses and seals) usually have circumferential, labyrinthine and endotheliochorial placentas, although the hyena develops hemochorial
placentation late in pregnancy [66,67]. Carnivore placentas have hemophagous regions of variable size and location [68]. Mossman [12] at one time considered the
carnivore fetal membranes to be the most primitive type
among extant eutherians, because both the yolk sac and
allantoic sac are large and persist until term.
Cetartiodactyls, perissodactyls and pangolins
The remaining orders of Laurasiatheria are characterized
by epitheliochorial placentation. The placenta may be diffuse with villi distributed over the surface of the chorioallantoc sac, as in whales [69], Suiformes (pigs, peccaries,
and hippopotamus) [70], camels [71] and pangolins [13],
or with microcotyledons as in the horse [16,72]. Most
ruminants have cotyledonary placentas with the cotyledons varying in number from 5â8 in deer to 50â175 in
bovids [8]. Chevrotains are considered to be the most
primitive ruminants and, interestingly, they have diffuse
placentas [73].

The epitheliochorial type of arrangement has as its advantage the safety factor of the isolation of fetal and maternal
components. The presence of two complete epithelia
should diminish immunological problems as well as the
deportation of fetal cells to the maternal organism. The
disadvantage is the greater difficulty in passage of materials between organisms, but this is overcome by a variety
of mechanisms. Most importantly, indenting of trophoblast and uterine epithelium by capillaries decreases the
interhemal distance. There are often, but not always, small
absorptive and phagocytic areas, for example the areolae
of the pig placenta. In equids, girdle cells of fetal origin
invade the uterine epithelium to form endometrial cup
cells that secrete equine chorionic gonadotropin [74-76].
However, not all perissodactyls have endometrial cups
[8]. In ruminants such as sheep and cow, binucleate trophoblast cells fuse with maternal epithelial cells and this
facilitates passage of prolactin to the maternal organism
[77]; this type of placenta is sometimes referred to as
synepitheliochorial.
The diffuse type of epitheliochorial placenta usually is
associated with an extensive allantoic sac. The cotyledonary type tends to be associated with a long, tubular allantoic cavity, although it is still large. There is a temporary
yolk sac placenta early in development, where this has
been examined, and a free yolk sac later in gestation.
Mossman [13] noted the resemblance in definitive yolk
sac placentation between whales, artiodactyls,
perissodactyls and pangolins, but grouped them together
with some non-laurasiatherians.

suborder Strepsirhina (lemurs and lorises).

How did the placenta evolve?
Although placental structure is directly involved in the
success of fetal growth, it is only one aspect of the complex
interrelationship between reproductive success of
individual matings and the overall reproductive success of
a given female [78]. Consequently different aspects of the
total reproductive process may be more or less important
depending on the relationship of a given species to its
environment. Nevertheless placental structure has been
considered useful as one of the characters to be used in
tracing relationships as it is considered conservative [14].
Although physiological data would be useful, unfortunately such data as the increase in fetal weight per weight
of placenta per day is available for only a few domestic
and laboratory animals, limiting our ability to use such
data on a comparative basis [79].
The evolutionary pressure favoring some type of hemochorial placenta has evidently been great. Hemochorial
placentas are found in insectivores, primates, tenrecs,
rodents, bats, hyraxes, elephant shrews, anteaters, armadillos, flying lemurs and even hyenas. The large variation
in the definitive form of the placenta, the divergent way in

which the hemochorial condition is achieved, and the
variety of unrelated orders in which it is found might
seem to suggest convergent evolution [15].
An endotheliochorial condition is succeeded by hemochorial placentation in the hyena. This could very well
have been the path of evolution in Afrotheria and perhaps
in Xenarthra and some bats. The question then arises of
whether either placental type arose from an epitheliochorial condition. It vexed the pioneers in this field, who were
puzzled to find that the tenrecs, which were mammals
with many conserved characters, nonetheless had hemochorial placentas (see [33]). Later, Wislocki [10] advanced
the view that hemochorial placentation was the more
primitive type and that epitheliochorial placentation was
the result of a secondary simplification. A similar opinion
was held by Portmann [11]. Certainly, it is more parsimonious to assume that epitheliochorial placentation is a
derived state arising perhaps twice, in Laurasiatheria and
in the strepsirhine primates (Figure 7). Of interest, invasive trophoblast occurs in marsupials, although there is
too little information to tell whether invasiveness is part

metatherian and eutherian mammals [2].

lections at the Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht. The studies were supported
in part by The Carlsberg Foundation, Denmark.

Additional clues to placental evolution are provided by
the early development of the fetal membranes. Luckett
[14,55] argued that ancestral mammals would have had
an amnion formed by folding rather than cavitation and
possessed a large allantoic vesicle. A large vascular yolk sac
would have been present early in development, forming a
choriovitelline placenta, but the yolk sac would have been
reduced in later stages [14]. These features are found with
endotheliochorial and hemochorial placentas in Afrotheria as well as with epitheliochorial placentas in some
Laurasiatheria.

Portmann [11] argued that the allantoic sac had evolved
along two paths. Mammals with epitheliochorial
placentation had retained a large allantoic sac as a receptacle for the dilute urine produced by a large and persistent mesonephros. The carnivores had also followed this
route. In contrast the allantoic cavity had become reduced
or was absent in mammals that had a poorly developed
mesonephros, such as rodents, higher primates, bats and
xenarthrans. Most of these had a hemochorial placenta
that was thought to have assumed the function of the mesonephros as first proposed by Bremer [80]. This hypothesis needs to be tested and refined in the light of current
concepts of mammalian phylogenetics and kidney development [81].

Conclusions
The position argued here resembles that originally
adopted by Mossman [12]. He considered that the
endotheliochorial and hemochorial conditions were
closely related and that the endotheliochorial type was the
more primitive. We have shown that the likely path of
evolution was from endotheliochorial to hemochorial in
the Afrotheria. It certainly occurred with the carnivores
and more than likely in the bats and Xenarthra. There may
be an epitheliochorial stage during placental ontogeny,
but Mossman [12] argued that a definitive epitheliochorial placenta was a secondary specialization; he regarded
the cotyledonary placentas of ruminants as among the
most highly specialized. We are inclined to agree. Consideration of placental type in relation to the findings of
molecular phylogenetics suggests that epitheliochorial
placentation evolved just twice, once in the Laurasiatheria
and once in Euarchontoglires.
