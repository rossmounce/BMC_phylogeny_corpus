Origin and evolution of a placental-specific
microRNA family in the human genome

Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short regulatory RNAs encoded in the genome of DNA viruses,
some single cell organisms, plants and animals. With the rapid development of technology, more and more
miRNAs are being discovered. However, the origin and evolution of most miRNAs remain obscure. Here we report
the origin and evolution dynamics of a human miRNA family.
Results: We have shown that all members of the miR-1302 family are derived from MER53 elements. Although the
conservation scores of the MER53-derived pre-miRNA sequences are low, we have identified 36 potential paralogs
of MER53-derived miR-1302 genes in the human genome and 58 potential orthologs of the human miR-1302
family in placental mammals. We suggest that in placental species, this miRNA family has evolved following the
birth-and-death model of evolution. Three possible mechanisms that can mediate miRNA duplication in
evolutionary history have been proposed: the transposition of the MER53 element, segmental duplications and
Alu-mediated recombination. Finally, we have found that the target genes of miR-1302 are over-represented in
transportation, localization, and system development processes and in the positive regulation of cellular processes.
Many of them are predicted to function in binding and transcription regulation.
Conclusions: The members of miR-1302 family that are derived from MER53 elements are placental-specific
miRNAs. They emerged at the early stage of the recent 180 million years since eutherian mammals diverged from
marsupials. Under the birth-and-death model, the miR-1302 genes have experienced a complex expansion with
some members evolving by segmental duplications and some by Alu-mediated recombination events.

Background
MiRNAs are endogenously expressed, single-stranded
RNAs ~22 nucleotides (nt) in length [1]. In animals,
miRNAs are transcribed as long primary miRNA (primiRNA) sequences that are processed in the nucleus to
give precursor sequences of miRNA (pre-miRNAs). The
pre-miRNA sequences are exported to the cytoplasm
where they are cleaved to produce mature miRNAs. The
miRNAs are then incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complexes where they function either to inhibit
translation or to mediate the degradation of their target
mRNAs commonly by binding to complementary
regions in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) [2-4].
MiRNAs play a pivotal role in many cellular functions
by regulating normal developmental and physiological

[8,9].
Repetitive elements (repeats) include tandem repeats
and interspersed repeats (DNA transposons and retrotransposons). Interspersed repeats are responsible for
gene (or exon) shuffling and duplication [10,11] as well
as for regulatory changes [12,13]. Gene (or exon) shuffling and duplication leads to the de novo creation of
protein domains [12,14] or new protein sequences
[15,16]. Recently, many miRNAs derived from repetitive
elements have been identified in mammals and plants
[17-21]. Some transposable elements become integrated
in multiple loci in the genome and evolve into different
members of a miRNA family. An example of this is the
hsa-mir-548 family, the members of which are derived
from Made1 transposable elements [19]. Some transposable elements surrounding miRNAs have also been
found to facilitate the expansion of miRNA clusters
[18,22]. As the evolution of many miRNAs remains

obscure, the analysis of miRNAs derived from repetitive
elements may facilitate the understanding of the evolution of miRNAs.
Here we report our study of the miR-1302 gene family
that has been experimentally verified in the human genome [23]. In miRBase (Release 16.0, Sept 2010), this
family has 11 members distributed in the human genome. Members of this family have recently been identified using computational methods in the chimpanzee
and horse genomes [24,25]. We have found that all
members of this family are derived from one transposon, the MER53 element [26]. The MER53 element is a
type of DNA transposable element with a 193-bp (base
pair) consensus sequence that exists in eutherian species. MER53 elements are characterized by the presence
of terminal inverted repeats and TA target site duplications that can form palindromic structures [26]. If integrated into the genome and transcribed, they may be
processed into miRNAs by the miRNA processing
machine. In this paper, we focus on MER53-derived
miRNAs in the human genome. First, we identified
MER53-derived miRNAs in known miRNAs and
scanned the human genome for their paralogs. Next, the
phylogenetic distribution and evolution dynamics of the
miR-1302 family were analyzed. Finally, we investigated
the functions of the predicted target genes and analyzed
the over-representation of Gene Ontology terms and
KEGG pathways for this miRNA family.

Results
Conservation Evaluation of MER53-derived miRNAs in the
Human Genome

By comparing the genomic coordinates of human miRNAs from miRBase v13.0 [27] with the locations of
repeats annotated by RepeatMasker [28] in the human
genome, we found 11 MER53-derived miRNA genes
that can encode hsa-mir-1302-1, hsa-mir-1302-2 (four
copies on different chromosomes), hsa-mir-1302-3, hsamir-1302-4, hsa-mir-1302-5, hsa-mir-1302-6, hsa-mir1302-7 and hsa-mir-1302-8 (Figure 1, Table 1 and
Figure S1 in Additional File 1). In miRBase v13.0, there
were eight members of the hsa-mir-1302 family. Four
identical copies of hsa-mir-1302-2 were identified on
chromosomes 1, 9, 15 and 19 (Table 1 and Figure S1 in
Additional File 1). In the later updates of miRBase, hsamir-1302-2(chr9), hsa-mir-1302-2(chr15) and hsa-mir1302-2(chr19) were renamed as hsa-mir-1302-9 (chr9),
hsa-mir-1302-10 (chr15) and hsa-mir-1302-11 (chr19)
respectively. The IDs of the other members of the miR1302 family are unchanged. Except for hsa-mir-1302-5,
the coverage densities of MER53 sequences to these
pre-miRNAs are 100% (Table 1). It is interesting that
all 11 of the MER53-derived miRNA genes that we

Page 2 of 12

identified, developed into one mature miRNA, hsa-miR1302 (5’UUGGGACAUACUUAUGCUAAA3’).
The average phastCons conservation scores of premiRNA sequences have been used to determine the conservation of pre-miRNA. In our study, the average phastCons conservation scores of hsa-mir-1302 members are
much lower than the thresholds used in previous studies
(Table 1) [21,29].
Potential Paralogs of the miR-1302 Family in the Human
Genome

Of the 5,839 MER53 elements annotated in the hg18
genome assembly, we identified 44 MER53 elements
that may encode miRNAs (Additional File 2). Eight of
the 44 potential sequences overlap with experimentally
verified miR-1302 precursor sequences [23] that are distributed on different chromosomes (Additional File 2).
Hsa-mir-1302-5 and hsa-mir-1302-7 were not identified
by our method as their multi-branched loops were filtered out by the MiPred program and hsa-mir-1302-8
was not identified because the selected region did not
meet our criterion to be a pre-miRNA. Thus, we have
identified 36 MER53 elements that may encode miRNAs
belonging to the miR-1302 family and that have not yet
been reported in the human genome.
Phylogenetic Distribution of Orthologs of the Human
miR-1302 Family

The 103 orthologs (Figure 2) of the hsa-mir-1302 family,
identified as described in Materials and Methods, were
only found in placental mammals, suggesting that the
miR-1302 family is a placental-specific gene family. Of
these, 58 orthologs from 21 species were validated as
miRNA using MiPred [30] (see Additional File 3). The
21 species are chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus,
marmoset, tarsier, mouse lemur, bushbaby, tree shrew,
guinea pig, rabbit, alpaca, dolphin, cow, horse, cat,
microbat, megabat, elephant, rock hyrax and sloth
(Figure 2). Although there are four copies of the hsamir-1302-2 gene in the human genome, only one ortholog was found in the genomes of all 21 species.
MER53 elements are only found in eutherian species
(placental mammals) [26]. Because eutherian mammals
diverged from marsupials and monotremes 180 and
210 million years ago, respectively [31], the homologs
of the hsa-mir-1302 family in placental mammals may
all be derived from MER53 elements, explaining why
homologs of the mir-1302 family are not found in
opossum and platypus (Figure 2). From this, we can
infer that MER53 elements and MER53-derived
miRNA genes emerged at the early stage of the recent
180 million years since eutherian mammals diverged
from marsupials.

During evolution, many miR-1302 genes have been
gained and lost (Figure 2). To estimate the gain and loss
of miR-1302 genes during evolution, we have used the
previously reported parsimony method [32] to infer that
miR-1302-1, miR-1302-2, miR-1302-4, miR-1302-5,
miR-1302-6, miR-1302-7, and miR-1302-8 evolved after
the MER53 elements had been inserted and fixed. For
example, miR-1302-2, miR-1302-4 and miR-1302-5 gene
are present in human and marmoset but absent in other
species such as tarsier, suggesting that these genes were
generated in the ancestor of human and marmoset and
lost in tarsier (Figure 2). In addition, in the tarsier genome the orthologs of miR-1302-1 and miR-1302-6 are
further diverged than other miRNA genes (Figure 2). In
humans, three additional hsa-mir-1302-2 genes and one
hsa-mir-1302-3 have been duplicated from the original
hsa-mir-1302-2 (discussed in detail in the next section).
The miRNA gene family has experienced repeated gene
duplication and while some of the duplicated genes have
diverged functionally others have become pseudo genes
or have been deleted from the genome of these species.
This pattern is clearly shown in Figure 2.
Previous workers have pointed out that if the gene
members of a family evolve in a birth-and-death manner
the genes will cluster by type and not by species, while
under the concerted model they will cluster by species
[33,34]. Except for hsa-1302-2 and hsa-1302-3 that are
produced from recent segmental duplication events and
cluster together, the miR-1302 genes do not show a
within-species clustering pattern (Figure S2 in Additional File 1). Combining the evolutionary divergence
between sequences information (Additional file 4) and
the results of previous analysis, we can infer that the
miR-1302 genes evolved in a birth-and-death manner.

Segmental Duplication and Alu Repeats Mediate the
Expansion of the miR-1302 Gene in the Human Genome

It is known that some protein-coding gene families
expanded by segmental duplication events [35-39]. Some
of the eleven members of the hsa-mir-1302 family are
remarkably similar. There are four identical copies of the
hsa-mir-1302-2 gene on different chromosomes and hsamir-1302-2 and hsa-mir-1302-3 differ at only two
nucleotide positions (see Figure S3A in Additional
File 1). We therefore hypothesize that, in addition to the
MER53 transposition effect, segmental duplication events
may have contributed to the expansion of the hsa-mir1302 family. If this is correct, then some members of the
family should be located in regions of segmental duplications. We find that five of the miRNA genes (the four
copies of hsa-mir-1302-2 and hsa-mir-1302-3) are indeed
located in segmental duplications (Table 2) thus supporting this view. As shown in Table 2, there are 10 nonredundant segmental duplication pairs in the human genome, some of which overlap. The relationship between
these duplications is shown in Figure 3 where each duplication pair is linked by a line. The miR-1302 gene and
the neighboring genes in each duplication region are
shown in Additional file 5. In each of the segmental
duplication pairs, the gene members are similar and the
gene order is either identical or in the opposite direction
(see Additional file 5 and Figure S4 in Additional File 1).
This is powerful evidence supporting our thesis that the
miR-1302 gene and its neighbors evolved by segmental
duplication events.
There is only a two-nucleotide difference between hsamir-1302-2 and hsa-mir-1302-3 (see Figure S3A in
Additional File 1), the same as the difference in the
alignment of their corresponding MER53 sequences (see

Figure S3B in Additional File 1). This indicates that,
owing to DNA segmental duplication, the hsa-mir-13022 sequence was also duplicated. When the hsa-mir1302-2 gene underwent duplication, as part of the evolution process, it is possible that mutations occurred
resulting in a new gene, hsa-mir-1302-3.
Because they have not been found in regions of segmental duplication, the other hsa-mir-1302 genes may
be products of MER53 transposition events alone. To
determine if they were also formed by segmental duplication events, we analyzed the 36 paralogs of the hsamir-1302 family that we identified in the human
genome (Additional File 2). We found that, like most of
the members of the hsa-mir-1302 family, none of them
were located in regions of segmental duplications.
Alu-mediated recombination events may facilitate the
expansion of segmental duplications through recombination [40] as well as mediate the expansion of miRNA
genes [18,22]. Alu-mediated recombination creates
mosaic Alu elements at the recombination junctions.
Consequently, the junction Alu elements exhibit marked
sequence divergence when compared with internal Alus
[40]. In the present study, we find that for most of the
segmental duplications only one of the ends (the 5’ or 3’
end) adjoins one or more of the Alu sequences (see Figure S4 in Additional File 1). Further, the distribution
pattern of AluSp-(hsa-mir-1302-2/3)-AluJo-AluYc-AluJrAluSx is present in all of these duplication sequences
(see Figure S4 in Additional File 1). Therefore, we have
used AluSp, AluJo, AluYc, AluJr and AluSx as internal
Alu elements. Of the 10 duplication pairs, six pairs have
Alu elements located at the junction and these were
used in the present analysis. Interestingly, we find no
significant sequence divergence among the internal Alu

pairs (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 3.0372, df = 4,
p-value = 0.5516), but the sequence divergence between
the junction Alu pairs and the internal Alu pairs is considerable (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 16.8957, df = 5,
p-value = 0.004702), indicating that the junction Alu
pairs have diverged more than the internal Alu pairs
(Figure 4). We therefore suggest that during the evolution of the hsa-mir-1302-2 and hsa-mir-1302-3 genes,
Alu-mediated recombined events have facilitated the
expansion of the segmental duplications that harbor
them.
Target Prediction and Functional Analysis

The function of hsa-miR-1302 is still unknown. We have
analyzed the targets of the mature human miR-1302 in an
attempt to explore its potential function. In the human
genome, 1,835 target genes are predicted by both PITA
[41] (17,844 predicted target genes and left 39,154 target
sites if removing the duplicate coordinates, see Additional
file 6) and TargetScan [42,43] (2,055 target genes with 94
conserved sites and 2,334 poorly conserved sites, see Additional file 7). We used the 1,835 target genes at the intersection between the two predicted gene sets as valid
targets (Additional file 8). Ninety-one of the TargetScan
predicted conserved sites (Additional file 9) and 1,744 of
the TargetScan predicted poorly conserved sites were
identified in the 1,835 valid target gene data set. To determine the functions and pathways that may involve hsamiR-1302, all the valid targets of hsa-mir-1302 were annotated using WebGestalt [44] and KEGG [45]. The 1,835
target genes are widely distributed across all the chromosomes (see Figure S5A in Additional File 1) and are
expressed in most tissues of the body. The highest expression levels are in the nervous system, and lowest are in the

Figure 3 Relationship between segmental duplication pairs in the human genome. The relationships are shown between the 10
duplication pairs where the miR-1302 genes located on chromosomes 1, 9, 15 and 19 are linked by green lines. The four copies of hsa-mir1302-2 are distributed on chromosomes 1, 9, 15 and 19. Hsa-mir-1302-3 is on chromosome 2. The circular ideograms of the chromosomes were
drawn using the files of genome karyotypes from the UCSC Genome Browser.

soft tissue and in the adrenal medulla (see Figure S5B in
Additional File 1). In the nervous tissue, the genes are
enriched in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles
and in the synapse (see Figure S5C in Additional File 1).
Functionally, the target genes are over-represented in
transportation, localization, system development processes, and in the positive regulation of cellular processes.

They may also play a role in binding and transcription regulation (see Figure S5D, Figure S5E in Additional File 1
and Additional file 10). Overall, these predicted target
genes are implicated in cell proliferation and cell division,
metabolism, development and in the immune response. In
the pancreas some of the genes have roles in the insulinrelated signal pathway and in pancreas pathology, while in

the nervous system some are involved in learning, memory, and signal transduction and are implicated in neural
disease development (see Figure S5 D-E in Additional File
1 and Additional file 10). The KEGG annotation indicates
that some of the target genes are involved in diseases and
are enriched in pathways that lead to glioma, chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, type II
diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer’s disease, and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (Additional file 10). As miR-1302 was first identified
in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells and embryoid
bodies [23] and is enriched in pathways to cancer, it may
influence the biological processes taking place in stem
cells, in tumor cells and in the early embryo.

Discussion
Recently, miRNAs that originate from repetitive elements have been identified in mammals and plants
[17-21]. Here we report a microRNA family, the miR1302 family, which originates from the DNA transposable element, MER53. MER53 is a medium reiteration
frequency, non-autonomous DNA transposon related to
the mariner family. MER53 elements can form palindromic stem-loop structures (see Figure 1B and Figure 1C)
[26]. Once an MER53 element becomes inserted into
the genome in the region of an active transcription and

Page 8 of 12

is fixed by natural selection, it may be transcribed and
processed by the enzyme machine system of miRNA
into miRNAs. Previous studies have shown that transposable-element-derived miRNAs are less conserved than
non-transposable-element-derived miRNAs [21]. However, we find that the average conservation scores for
the miR-1302 genes are very low (Table 1). Because
quite a few orthologs of the precursors of human miR1302 are found (See Additional File 3) in eutherian
mammals, we suggest that the MER53 elements and
MER53-derived miRNA genes may have evolved after
eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials and
monotremes as recently as 180 million years ago. In placental species, many miR-1302 genes have been gained
and lost, indicating that they may have evolved following
the birth-and-death model of evolution. It should be
noted that the parsimony reconstruction of gain and
loss of the miR-1302 genes is influenced by the fact that
the miR-1302 genes were first identified in the human
genome and the orthologs in other species were identified using computational approaches. Nevertheless, the
theoretical approach is a good starting point for deducing the evolution mode for miRNA families.
MiRNAs, like protein-coding genes, form gene families
and like MIR166 in plants, many of the pre-miRNAs produce either similar or identical mature miRNAs [27,46].
These pre-miRNAs are classified as one family. The following questions arise: How do miRNA genes evolve to
become miRNA families? What is the evolution dynamics
of these miRNA genes? And are their evolutionary patterns the same as those for protein-coding gene families?
Previous studies have shown that the expansion of
miRNA families usually occurs through tandem or segmental duplications [22,47-50]. In the present study, we
have focused on the precursors of human miR-1302.
Because genes of the miR-1302 family are found on several chromosomes, we investigated the possibility that
they too evolved through segmental duplication events.
We suggest that besides the transposition effect of the
MER53 elements, the four copies of hsa-mir-1302-2 and
the one copy of hsa-mir-1302-3 were produced through
segmental duplication events. When Alu sequences are
near or at the boundaries of the duplication units they
are known to mediate the expansion of segmental duplications through recombination. Our results indicate that
the hsa-miR-1302-2 and hsa-mir-1302-3 genes may have
evolved because of Alu-mediated recombination events.
However, this mechanism apparently does not apply to
other members of the human miR-1302 family or to
potential paralogs in the human genome. They may have
evolved by the transposition of MER53 elements alone.
Small RNAs regulate gene expression in many ways:
they mediate antiviral responses; they play a role in the
organization of chromosomal domains; and they restrain

Yuan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:346
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/346

the spread of selfish genetic elements. Small RNAs guide
transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing
machinery to specific target sequences that include
genes and transposable elements [51]. The target genes
of miR-1302 are over-represented in functions that
require the binding of metal ions and binding to DNA.
They are mainly involved in metabolism, regulation of
cellular physiological processes, signal transduction and
transport. The MER53-derived miRNAs may, therefore,
play important roles in cell proliferation and cell division, metabolism, development, pancreas physiology and
pathology, nervous system physiology, diseases and in
the immune response. Because the functions of miR1302 have been predicted and predictions notoriously
produce a large number of false-positives, a better
method to assign a function to miR-1302 would be to
combine the expression profiles of the miRNAs and the
target genes. This is a study that we would like to do in
the future.

Conclusions
In this study, we report the origin and evolution of the
miR-1302 family in the human genome. Overall, we have
identified 36 novel potential paralogs of miR-1302 genes
in the human genome and 58 orthologs of the human
miR-1302 genes in 21 placental species. Our data show
that all members of miR-1302 family are derived from
MER53 elements and we have proposed that they emerged
at the early stage of the recent 180 million years since
eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials. Segmental
duplication events have facilitated the expansion of the
miR-1302 family while the expansion of these segmental
duplications may also have been facilitated by Alu-Alumediated recombination events. Because, in placental species many miR-1302 genes have been gained and lost, we
have proposed that their development proceeded according to the birth-and-death model of evolution. Furthermore, we have found that the predicted target genes of
miR-1302 are over-represented in transportation, localization, and in system development processes as well as in
the positive regulation of cellular processes. Many of the
potential target genes are predicted to function in binding
and transcription regulation.
Methods
Finding MER53-derived miRNAs Within Known Human
miRNAs

The genomic locations and sequences of repetitive elements (including MER53) in the human genome were
taken from the University of California Santa Cruz
(UCSC) Genome Browser [52] using the Table Browser
[53] and analyzed using RepeatMasker 3.27 [28]. The
sequences and coordinates of the human pre-miRNAs
and mature miRNAs were downloaded from miRBase

Page 9 of 12

v13.0 [27] and mapped to the human genome (hg18).
The nomenclature for some members of the hsa-mir1302 family differs between miRBase v13.0 and that in
later releases. However, the sequences are the same and
the new nomenclature has been explained in the Results
section. The genomic locations of the miRNAs and the
repeats in the whole genome sequence were compared
using the UCSC Table Browser [53] and Galaxy [54]. If
the overlap of coordinates (equivalent in this case to
percentage identity) between a repetitive element and a
pre-miRNA sequence was at least 50% for the premiRNA sequence or 100% for the mature miRNA
sequence, then the miRNA was considered to be a
repeat-derived miRNA [21]. To retrieve information and
for further analysis, the data and results were processed
using Linux shell and Perl scripts. Unless otherwise specified, all the data in the present work were analyzed
using these tools.
Genome-wide Identification of Potential Paralogs of
MER53-derived miR-1302 Genes

To identify potential paralogs of MER53-derived miR1302 genes, we developed a three-step operational
scheme. We first searched the human genome for candidate MER53 elements using the BLAST program. Only
hits with exact matches in the “seed region” (nucleotides
2-8) of miR-1302 were selected and two potential miR1302 precursor sequences of length 110 nt harboring
the “seed region” were excised from the hit sequences
using a method similar to that described earlier [55]. An
excised sequence refers to a mature miRNA that is processed from the left or right arm of a potential precursor sequence. Using MiPred [30], excised sequences that
were predicted to be miRNA precursors were selected
for further analysis. Finally, if the candidate sequence
could be transcribed and if it was not the exon of a protein-coding gene, then it was assumed to be a miRNA
precursor. To determine if the sequence was transcribed
and was not an exon of a protein-coding gene, we compared the coordinates of the potential precursor
sequences with the coordinates of ESTs and the exons
of protein-coding genes in the hg18 genome assembly.
Phylogenetic Distribution of the Orthologs of MER53derived miR-1302 Genes

The orthologs of the eight members of the hsa-mir-1302
family in different organism were retrieved from the
Multiz alignments of 44 vertebrate species [56]. When
there were gaps or short inserts (1-10 bp) in the selected
alignment region then the corresponding sequences
were checked using the Ensembl Genome Browser. cjamir-1302-5, ggo-mir-1302-6 and ggo-mir-1302-7 were
detected by the BLAT program with best reciprocal hits.
Because a number of workers have used the liftOver

Yuan et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:346
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/346

program provided by the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
Group to determine orthologs [57-61], we checked our
previously determined ortholog sequences by applying
liftOver to over.chain files (downloaded from ftp://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/) to further authenticate them
(see details in Additional File 3). The miPred [30] classifier was used to validate these sequences as potential
pre-miRNAs.
Evolution Analysis

The UCSC’s phastCons program [62] was used to calculated the conservation score of each nucleotide of every
member of the hsa-mir-1302 family of the 17-species
Multiz alignment [56] from the UCSC Genome Browser
[52]. The 17-species are human, chimp, rhesus, mouse,
rat, rabbit, dog, cow, armadillo, elephant, tenrec, opossum, chicken, frog, zebrafish, tetraodon, pufferfish
(fugu). The Multiz data contains a measure of evolutionary conservation for each nucleotide in the human genome against the other 16 genomes. To estimate the
probability that each nucleotide belongs to a conserved
element in the multiply aligned sequences, phastCons
computes conservation scores based on a phylogenetic
hidden Markov model [62]. The phastCons scores range
from 0 to 1 and are a measure of the probability of purifying selection. The score estimates the probability of a
nucleotide or a region being under selective pressure.
The average score of each pre-miRNA was calculated
from the per-site conservation score.
Sequences were aligned using the R-Coffee program
[63]. Molecular evolutionary analyses were performed
using MEGA 4 [64]. The extent of nucleotide sequence
divergence was estimated using the uncorrected p-distances and evolutionary distances were calculated with
the pairwise deletion option. Phylogenetic trees were
reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method [65]
and the statistical reliabilities of the internal branches
were assessed using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Two independent approaches have been developed to
detect segmental duplications (SDs) [66,67]. In one of
the approaches, SDs (≥1 kp and ≥90% identity) were discovered by identifying high-copy repeats, removing the
repeats from the whole genomic sequence and then
searching for similar sequences in the genome. The
repeat sequences were reinserted into the pairwise alignments, the ends of alignments were trimmed, and global
alignments were generated (see reference [66] for
details). To test our hypothesis that, in addition to the
effect of MER53 transposition, SD events may contribute to the expansion of the hsa-mir-1302 family, we
analyzed the segmental duplication data that were precomputed by Bailey and his colleagues [66] and that we
downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser [52]. By
comparing the coordinates, we determined whether

Page 10 of 12

human miR-1302 genes were located in regions of segmental duplications. We used Circos v0.52 [68] to show
the relationships between segmental duplications harboring miR-1302 genes.
To find out if the segmental duplications that harbor
miR-1302 genes are produced by Alu-mediated recombination events, we examined sequence features at the
junctions of duplications. We defined junction sequences
as the sequences at the terminal ends of segmental duplications spanning a ±5 bp interval. We compared the
divergence of Alu elements located at the junctions with
the divergence of the corresponding internal Alus in the
pairing duplications [40]. Sequence divergence was estimated using Kimura’s two-parameter model for genetic
distance in MEGA 4 [64]. The data were analyzed using
version 2.9.0 of the R programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [69].
Target Prediction and Regulatory Function Analysis

We collected the 3’UTR-sequences of human coding
refGenes from the UCSC Genome Browser [52]. Two
programs, PITA [41] and TargetScan [42,43], were used
to identify potential target sites of hsa-miR-1302. The
intersection of the two independently computed sets of
target genes was used to list the valid potential targets.
The number of possible target sites for human miR1302 in all human coding genes was calculated after
removing the coordinates of overlapping genes. To
determine the functional categories to which the target
genes belong, we used the WebGestalt program [44] to
display the GO categories of the target genes. We also
mapped the genes to KEGG pathways [45].
