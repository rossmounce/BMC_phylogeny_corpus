Abstract
Background: The filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum is used as biological control agent of
several plant-pathogenic fungi. In order to study the genome of this fungus, a functional genomics
project called "TrichoEST" was developed to give insights into genes involved in biological control
activities using an approach based on the generation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Results: Eight different cDNA libraries from T. harzianum strain CECT 2413 were constructed.
Different growth conditions involving mainly different nutrient conditions and/or stresses were
used. We here present the analysis of the 8,710 ESTs generated. A total of 3,478 unique sequences
were identified of which 81.4% had sequence similarity with GenBank entries, using the BLASTX
algorithm. Using the Gene Ontology hierarchy, we performed the annotation of 51.1% of the
unique sequences and compared its distribution among the gene libraries. Additionally, the
InterProScan algorithm was used in order to further characterize the sequences. The identification
of the putatively secreted proteins was also carried out. Later, based on the EST abundance, we
examined the highly expressed genes and a hydrophobin was identified as the gene expressed at
the highest level. We compared our collection of ESTs with the previous collections obtained from
Trichoderma species and we also compared our sequence set with different complete eukaryotic
genomes from several animals, plants and fungi. Accordingly, the presence of similar sequences in
different kingdoms was also studied.
Conclusion: This EST collection and its annotation provide a significant resource for basic and
applied research on T. harzianum, a fungus with a high biotechnological interest.

Background
Trichoderma is a fungal genus that includes cosmopolitan
fungi able to colonize different substrates under diverse
environmental conditions. One of the most significant
ecological niches occupied by Trichoderma species is the
plant rhizosphere, which is effectively colonized due to
the capacity of these fungi to interact with plants and compete with other soil organisms [1]. This ability is the result
of a long period evolution in which biological mechanisms for attacking other microorganisms and for enhancing plant growth have developed in Trichoderma [2]. The
biocontrol activity of Trichoderma depends on its metabolic versatility and secretory potential, which are responsible for the production of large amounts of highly diverse
hydrolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of fungal
cell walls [3]. Since Trichoderma species are efficient antagonists of other fungi and due to their ubiquity and rapid
substrate colonization, they have been commonly used as
biocontrol organisms for agriculture, and their enzyme
systems are widely used in industry [4].
The Trichoderma genome, although it is a fungal genus of
high biotechnological value, has been poorly surveyed
compared to other microorganisms. A structural genomics
project, carried out by the U.S. Joint Genome Institute [5]
has provided the first version of the full genome sequence
of the T. reesei strain QM 9414, an isolate without known
biocontrol abilities, but with industrial interest. Additionally, the functional genomics EU-funded project "TrichoEST" [6] was undertaken by an International
Consortium comprised of academic institutions and
enterprises. The aims were to identify genes and gene
products from twelve strains with biotechnological value
from different Trichoderma species [7]. In this project, the
antagonistic strain T. harzianum CECT 2413 was selected
representing the T. harzianum biotype.
In this work, mRNA populations from Trichoderma transcribed among others, under mycoparasitic and nutrient
stress conditions, trying to simulate some of the environmental conditions that take place in the soil, were cloned
as cDNAs and were the origin of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs). This strategy has been used as an efficient and economical approach for large-scale gene discovery, to
explore gene regulation patterns and to identify differentially regulated genes. During the last years, a large
number of ESTs have been generated from several filamentous fungi and Oomycetes, including among others
Gibberella zeae [8], Magnaporthe grisea [9], Mycosphaerella
graminicola [10], Phytophthora parasitica [11], Uromyces
fabae [12] or Ustilago maydis [13,14].
There are several previous studies involving EST
approaches that have been carried out in Trichoderma species. In the first one [15], the metabolism of T. reesei QM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/193

9414 was studied focusing on the anaerobic and aerobic
degradation of glucose. Their genomic work produced the
sequence of 2,835 randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to 1,151 unique transcripts and the complete mitochondrial genome of T. reesei. Their complete EST
database and the details on the experimental procedure
and results are available on line [16]. In another study
[17], 18,000 ESTs from a sole cDNA library were
sequenced and 5,131 unique sequences were obtained
from T. reesei QM6a. They also detected twelve enzymes
involved in biomass degradation, performed microarray
expression analysis and found that these enzymes were
transcriptionally regulated [17].
Diener et al [18] identified genes from T. reesei QM6a
involved in protein processing and secretion. A total of
21,888 ESTs from two different cDNA libraries were
sequenced, corresponding to 7,943 unique transcripts.
Liu and Yang [19], working with a T. harzianum unknown
strain, obtained 3,298 ESTs (1,740 unique transcripts)
from a single cDNA library. In the most recent study,
2,047 ESTs (457 unique sequences) were retrieved using a
subtractive strategy. Two cDNA subtraction libraries were
used in order to identify genes that were differentially
expressed in response to secretion stress in T. reesei RutC30 [20].
In the present study we report the analysis of 8,710 ESTs
obtained from T. harzianum CECT 2413. These sequences
were derived from eight different cDNA libraries that had
been made combining different growth conditions. Overall, 3,478 unique transcripts were identified and GOterms were assigned. In addition, the relative abundance
of ESTs provided a measure of gene expression. We identified the putative secreted proteins and also performed a
comparative analysis among our dataset and the other
collections of ESTs from Trichoderma species. Finally, the
T. harzianum ESTs were compared to genomic sequence
databases from several animals, plants and fungi.

Results
EST sequence determination and analysis
Different conditions were used to build specific and
mixed cDNA libraries for the "TrichoEST" project as seen
in the Methods section. Eight different libraries were
made (Table 1) and EST sequences were produced (Table
2). A total of 7,283 sequences were identified as having
high quality by Phred [21] (quality values greater than 20)
from the 8,710 sequencing reactions (83.6%). The average sequence length was 566 nucleotides, and approximately 79.8% of the ESTs were longer than 400
nucleotides, while 7.2% of the sequences were shorter
than 100 nucleotides.

ESTs were generated from different libraries with the
expectation that more unique genes would be identified
from moderate levels of sequencing from diverse libraries
rather than deep sequencing of a single library. The combined ESTs for all libraries clustered into 889 multisequence contigs, with 2,589 singlets yielding an estimate of
3,478 unique sequences. These unique sequences are
listed in the additional file 1. The ESTs that are contained
in each contig are listed in the additional file 2.
The distribution of ESTs across multiple libraries was
assessed as a measure of uniqueness of gene concurrence
across libraries. No contig contained sequences that were
from seven or eight libraries, and only nine unique
sequences were present in six libraries. Most of the contigs
contained sequences found in one to three libraries, with
the largest category being contigs represented by clones
from two libraries (393 clones). This pattern is mainly due
to the fact that many of the contigs contain only a small
number of ESTs. Considering only those contigs representing 20 or more ESTs, it is found that most of the genes
are usually represented in multiple libraries.
Functional annotation and analysis
Unique sequences were assigned functions according to
gene ontology (GO) terms [22] based on BLAST definitions using the program Blast2GO [23]. GO categories
were assigned to 1,776 of the 3,478 predicted unique

sequences (51.1%). Later, we used a locally implemented
AmiGO browser in order to examine the representation of
genes across different functional categories. Our AmiGO
browser is publicly available [24]. However, in this paper
we only cite those libraries that provided more than 300
unique sequences: L02, L03, L06 and L10 (Table 3).
The gene distribution in the main ontology categories was
studied and the percentages of unique sequences with
assigned GO terms that fell into these categories were calculated. For this purpose, we considered 100% as the total
number of unique sequences from each of the libraries
that possessed an assigned GO term in each of the three
organizing principles of GO (Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component) [22]. It must be
taken into account that these percentages do not add up
to 100% because many deduced proteins can have more
than one GO assigned function. Gene distribution was
very similar across the libraries that came from Trichoderma grown in liquid media (L02, L03 and L10). However,
differences were found in L06, made from Trichoderma
grown in solid media (solid minimal medium containing
0.1% glucose or PPG medium). For example, in L06 the
percentage of GO terms in the following categories was
significantly higher than in the other libraries: "metabolism" (92.9%), "biosynthesis" (56.4%), "cellular metabolism" (85.8%), "macromolecule metabolism" (64.4%),
"primary metabolism" (80.6%), "nucleic acid binding"

Identification of putative secreted proteins
T. harzianum is the source of a number of secreted proteins
produced for various industrial applications. To identify
potential secreted proteins we used SignalP 3.0 [25] in
order to search for predicted proteins with a signal peptide. We found that 800 of these predicted proteins

(23.0%) possessed this putative signal peptide (see additional file 1).
Exploration of more abundantly expressed genes
Sequencing of random cDNA clones allows studies of
mRNA abundance. Thus, analysis of the frequency of specific ESTs that form individual contigs can provide information with respect to the expression levels of particular
genes under different experimental conditions [9,10].
Table 4 displays the total number of contigs made up of
20 or more ESTs together with the originating libraries.
The data illustrate the functional diversity of these highly

expressed unique sequences with apparently no particular
functional category dominating the analysis. However, at
this point it must be considered that a significant amount
of hypothetical and/or unassigned-function proteins were
also detected. As expected, a number of housekeeping
genes involved in protein translation, carbon metabolism
and energy production were identified, as some of the hits
corresponded to genes like the translation elongation factor 1α, histones H3 and H4, polyubiquitin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or ribosomal proteins.
The most abundantly represented gene in the total collection (T34C463, 95 ESTs) was similar to a hydrophobin
from Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph T. reesei). Hydrophobins are small molecular weight proteins of fungal origin
that can play roles in diverse physiological processes
including adhesion, development and pathogenesis
[26,27].

We also found genes probably involved in the synthesis of
thiamine (vitamin B1): T34C494 (46 ESTs) and T34C829
(24) were similar to the NMT1 protein and T34C811 (28)
was similar to the THI4 protein, a thiazole biosynthetic
enzyme. Additionally, we also detected sequences similar
to an ADP/ATP carrier protein (T34C470), the ATP synthase protein 9 (T34C216) [28], a peptide involved in
stress response (T34C759) and a cyclophilin (T34C418).
Comparison to the nr database and InterProScan
annotation
Sequence comparison using the BLASTX algorithm
against the NCBI non redundant (nr) database allowed
the identification of 2,832 unique sequences (81.4%).
Thus, 646 sequences did not exhibit significant similarity
(E-value < 10-5) to genes in the nr database.

Additional information on the ESTs was obtained by protein-signature scanning. InterProScan was used for

sequence comparison to the InterPro database [29]. This
database contains signature information from Hidden
Markov models, regular expressions, fingerprints and profiles for protein families, and domains from public
domain database projects including Pfam [30], PROSITE
[31], ProDom [32], PRINTS [33], TIGRFAMS [34] and
SMART [35]. The submission facilitated the annotation of
3,331 (95.8%) unique sequences with significant protein
signatures. Within them, 2,006 (57.7%) sequences contained associated InterPro (IPR) numbers. Of these 2,006
sequences, 76 had not been annotated during the
sequence comparison against the NCBI nr database. These
data are included in the additional file 1.
Comparison with other Trichoderma collections of ESTs
We used the tBLASTX algorithm [36] in order to study the
presence of similar sequences in the collections of ESTs
from Trichoderma publicly available. At the E-value < 10-10
level, the highest percentages of similar sequences were
found in three collections from T. reesei: 44.7% [18],
40.5% [17] and 25.1% [15]. Unexpectedly, only 21.6% of
similar sequences was found in the related to biocontrol
collection obtained from T. harzianum [19]. Finally, a very
low percentage (4.5%) of similar sequences was found
with the ESTs recently obtained from T. reesei following a
subtractive strategy [20].

BLAST analysis to species sequence datasets
We used the BLASTX algorithm [36] to identify ESTs with
sequence similarity to the protein sequences derived from
the genomic sequence datasets of 15 eukaryotic species
(two animals, two plants and eleven fungi). We used an Evalue < 10-5 as indicative of sequence similarity significance. In these comparisons it is important to note that
the T. harzianum sequences do not represent the complete
genome.

All unique sequences from T. harzianum were queried
against the sequence datasets. A table listing the number
of unique sequences possessing a top hit below the E-values of 10-5, 10-25, 10-50, 10-75, and 10-100 was produced
(Table 5). Of the 3,478 unique sequences from T. harzianum, the highest proportion of similar sequences was
found in filamentous fungi. At the 10-5 level, the percentages were: T. reesei (75.2%), Fusarium graminearum
(71.7%), Neurospora crassa (66.4%), M. grisea (63.4%)
and Aspergillus nidulans (59.1%). These proportions
decreased in the basidiomicete U. maydis (42.0%) and
Cryptococcus neoformans (35.9%) and also in the yeasts
Candida albicans (41.4%), Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(39.2%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (39.0%). At this
level, a total percentage of an 80.2% of the unique
sequences had sequence similarity with at least one of the

between fungi and plants (not present in animal
genomes). Furthermore, the number of unique sequences
with similarity to the fungal and plant genomes but not
the animal genomes was 178. Meanwhile, the number of
unique sequences with similar sequences in the fungal
plus in either of the two animal, but not in the plant
genomes was 157 (Figure 1). The T. harzianum unique
sequences found to have similar sequences only in fungal
species totalled 1,474 (42.4%). These sequences are also
listed in the additional file 3.
The number of orphan unique sequences (those showing
no similarity with any other organism or the nr database)
was 487 (14.0%). However, the number of unique
sequences lacking a similarity to sequences in the nr database was 646 (18.8%). Thus, after our cross-species identification of similar sequences, we reduced the number of
orphan genes by another 159 unique sequences.

fungal datasets. The number of ESTs plus contigs with
similarity to sequences of plants was slightly higher
(33.3% in total, 32.5% for Arabidopsis thaliana, 29.3% for
Oryza sativa) than what was found in animals (31.3% in
total, 25.8% for Drosophila melanogaster, 25.1% for
Caenorhabditis elegans). A total of 2,793 unique sequences
(80.3%) showed sequence similarity with at least one species with an E-value < 10-5. Logically, these percentages
decreased as the E-value increased (Table 5). For instance,
at the E < 10-100 level, 11.6% of the sequences had similar
sequences in T. reesei, 5.0% in F. graminearum and 4.0% in
A. nidulans, being the rest of the genomes not significantly
represented.
Further analysis of the T. harzianum unique sequences
grouped these sequences based upon the eukaryotic taxa
in which sequence similarity was found. The classification
of unique sequences conserved across all eukaryotes was
defined by at least one similar sequence in each of the
fungi, plants and animals. Under these criteria, 981 of the
2,793 unique sequences (35.1%) that showed sequence
similarity (E-value < 10-5) with at least one organism, were
present in all eukaryotic taxa (Figure 1). These sequences
are listed in the additional file 3.
Moreover, 1,138 unique sequences were found in
genomes from fungi and animals (not present in plants)
and a slightly higher number of genes (1,159) was shared

We are investigating the genome of T. harzianum CECT
2413, a strain with a great interest in biotechnology and
biological control [37,38]. EST sequencing provides information about functional identification of genes, gene
structure and gene expression patterns. Like in other
recent studies carried out in fungi [9,39], a strategy of
sequencing a variety of different libraries was used to maximize the number of unique genes. The approach based
on the construction of cDNA libraries from a mixture of
conditions was successfully used in T. reesei by Foreman et
al. [17]. The Trichoderma growth conditions for the different cDNA libraries were mainly chosen in order to simulate in vitro some aspects of the biocontrol process
occurring in the soil environment like mycoparasitism
[7]. This strategy has proved to be successful in order to
identify genes involved in the biocontrol such as ThPTR2
(EST L03T34P074R06935), a peptide transporter recently
studied by our group that was highly expressed when Trichoderma was interacting with the plant-pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea [40]. Additionally, similar findings
have been obtained for other genes like erg1, involved in
the biosynthesis of terpenes [41] or the proteases pra1 [42]
and p6281 [43].
Overall, we searched in our collection of ESTs for unique
sequences encoding cell wall degrading enzymes, which
could be involved in the mycoparasitism. For this purpose
we looked at the BLAST definitions and found several
unique sequences with putative chitinase (6 unique
sequences), glucanase (30) or protease (54) activities.
This isoenzyme multiplicity has been described before by
different groups and reported by our team in a study
where several isoenzymes with glucanase, protease or chitinase activities were detected in different Trichoderma species, including T. harzianum CECT 2413 [44].

Sequence redundancy within our study was 56.4%. This
level of redundancy was lower than in the two comparable studies carried out in T. reesei: 71.5% [17] and 59.4%
[15]. In the first one, 18,000 ESTs were sequenced from a
single cDNA library made from a mixture of more than 20
different growth conditions. However, in the second one
[15], a unique growth condition was used and the
number of sequenced ESTs was also lower (2,835). The
subtractive study [20] had a sequence redundancy of
77.7%. Finally, the remaining study is not comparable
since a separate assembly process was used for each library
[18]. Taking into account that sequence redundancy
increases with the total number of sequenced ESTs, we
consider that our strategy, designed in order to maximize
the number of unique genes without increasing in excess
the number of sequences, worked properly.
Overall, 3,478 unique sequences were identified in T. harzianum CECT 2413, which represents a significant portion
of the genome. According to recent available data [45], the
number of genes in the T. reesei genome (34.5 Mb) is very
close to 10,000. This is similar to what has been found in
other filamentous fungi. Thus, our collection of genes
would represent about one third of the total.
BLASTX searches indicated that 81.2% of the unique
sequences had sequence similarity to an entry in the NCBI
nr database. This percentage is quite similar to what has
been recently found in a similar study in Aspergillus niger
(83.0%) [46], but it is much higher than what was found
in other recent EST studies carried out in other fungi like
Conidiobolus coronatus (58%) [47], Phakospora pachyrhizi
(48%) [48] and U. maydis (57–59%) [13,14]. New
sequence data from complete genome projects from several fungi had made possible this increase although a high
proportion of the hits remains annotated as hypothetical
proteins.
The degree of annotation was extended through the identification of protein motifs, using InterProScan searches of
the InterPro database. This extension resulted in annotation of a 95.8% (3,331) of the unique sequences, including 2,006 with InterPro annotation. This percentage is
again much higher than the one found in U. maydis
(69.4%) [13].
As seen before, in a number of cases clones that did not
cluster (considered as unique sequences) displayed
sequence similarity to the same protein. Several factors
can account for this. Among them, (i) the clones are different genes that are homologs of the same protein, (ii)
the clones align with different regions of the same search
hit but do not overlap (or have too small of an overlap)
with each other, and (iii) the clones represent different
splice variants of the same gene. We searched for alterna-

tive transcript forms by looking carefully inside each contig but apparently, none of them were detected in the
present study. They have been recently found in other filamentous fungi like M. grisea [9] and Fusarium verticillioides [39], although perhaps the most extensive genomewide survey on alternative splicing in a fungus comes
from the basidiomycete C. neoformans serotype D [49],
where this mechanism was found in 4.2% of the genes.
Additionally, there are at least two studies where alternative splicing has been described in Trichoderma species. In
the first one, carried out also in T. harzianum CECT 2413,
two alternative forms of a glucoamylase gene were
detected in different growth conditions [50]. In the second one, the authors found two different mRNA species
from two chitinases (chi18-3 and chi18-13), depending
also on the culture media where T. atroviride had been previously grown [51].
EST abundance
The analysis of the relative abundance of individual ESTs
that make up unique sequences (contigs) from different
libraries can be used as a first indicator of transcript abundance. We identified a number of unique sequences generated from 20 or more ESTs (Table 4). Apparently, no
particular gene family was predominant. This agrees with
some previous works [10,18], but it is in contrast with
other analysis where particular classes of genes (e.g.,
encoding ribosomal proteins) dominated these frequency
tables [8,14]. However, numerous housekeeping genes
were detected as expected.

A unique sequence similar to the hydrophobin II from H.
jecorina was the most represented gene. A similar sequence
(contig1201) was also found as one of the most expressed
genes in the library LT002 from T. reesei [18]. However, we
have not found another possible hydrophobin in a similar frequency table made in any other fungus including T.
harzianum [19]. In a recent study [52], it was found that
the T. reesei hydrophobins I and II had a role in hyphal
development and sporulation, respectively. Among the
most highly expressed genes we also detected sequences
that could be involved in thiamine biosynthesis, similar
to the NMT1 and THI4 proteins respectively. THI4 is a thiazole biosynthetic enzyme that had been previously
found (contig437) as highly expressed in T. harzianum
[19]. However, both genes could also be involved in other
processes [53]. In S. cerevisiae THI4 appears to be a dual
function protein involved in thiazole biosynthesis and
tolerance to mitochondrial DNA damage [54].
A putative cyclophilin was also identified as one of the
most abundant transcripts. Cyclophilins include the binding proteins of the cyclic peptide cyclosporin A, they possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity in vitro and
can play roles in protein folding and transport, RNA splic-

ing and the regulation of multi-protein complexes in cells
[55]. One similar sequence was also found as one of the
most expressed genes (contig429) in the EST collection
from T. harzianum [19]. So far, cyclophilins have been
more studied in yeasts [56,57] than in filamentous fungi
[58,59].
GO terms
The percentage of assigned GO-terms (51.1%) was
slightly higher than in one similar study in A. niger [46].
As far as we know, this is the first time that the program
Blast2GO [23] has been used for this purpose. Clear differences were found in the distribution of the GO terms
among the gene library L06 and the other three (L02, L03
and L10). This could be explained considering that L06
was the only library among them made using mRNA from
Trichoderma growing in solid medium. However, it must
be also considered that these differences could arise more
from their different composition than from the solid or
liquid nature of the media. The liquid media included different stress-related growth conditions like nitrogen or
carbon starvation, chitin or fungal cell walls as sole carbon
source whereas the solid medium covered only carbon
starvation.

We identified 800 predicted proteins with a putative signal peptide. Gene Ontology annotation categorized only
80 of the predicted proteins as "extracellular", included in
the GO terms "extracellular matrix" (GO:0031012) and
"extracellular region" (GO:0005576) (see [24]). However,
it must be taken into account that we were able to assign
a GO term to 51.1% of the unique sequences. The percentage of predicted proteins with signal peptide (23.0%) was
almost identical to what was found in A. niger (23.4%)
[46] but lower than in T. reesei (33%), using the same
algorithm [18]. These differences could be related to the
different growth conditions from which the cDNA libraries were made or to the fact that they are different species.
Comparison with other Trichoderma collections of ESTs
We found that only 21.6% of the unique sequences had
similar sequences in the related to biocontrol collection
obtained from T. harzianum [19]. A higher number of similar sequences was found in the other comparable collections from T. reesei, specifically in the collection of ESTs
involved in protein processing and secretion [18]. These
results were unexpected because in principle, a highest
number of similar sequences should have been found in
the EST collection related to biocontrol [19] than in the T.
reesei collections. The lack of information on the strain
and the growth conditions in which that EST collection
for T. harzianum was obtained [19] makes difficult to
explain this fact. As for the differences in the presence of
similar sequences between the three comparable collections from T. reesei, it is logical that the lowest percentage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/193

of similar sequences was found in a collection obtained in
very different growth conditions, with glycerol as sole carbon source [15], than the ones used in our study.
BLAST analysis to species sequence datasets
The unique sequences were compared to the genomes of
eleven different fungi, two animals (C. elegans and D. melanogaster) and two plants (A. thaliana and O. sativa).
Within the total of 2,793 unique sequences (80.3%) that
showed sequence similarity with at least one species (at Evalue < 10-5), 2,616 (93.7%) had a similar sequence in the
T. reesei complete genome. It must be considered that
many gaps are still present in the current publicly available version (v1.0) of this genome [5]. The new version
(v2.0) containing very few gaps will be available soon [45]
and will allow us to further study the unique sequences
that could be found in T. harzianum but not present in T.
reesei.

Behind T. reesei, the ascomycete F. graminearum possessed
the largest number of similar sequences to the T. harzianum unique sequences. This is not surprising due to the
close taxonomic relationship between the Trichoderma
and Fusarium genera, because their teleomorphs are
located in the close families Nectriaceae and Hypocreaceae, respectively [60].
In the species-by-species comparison, 981 (28.2%)
unique sequences were present in all the eukaryotic taxa.
A similar percentage (29%) was found in a similar study
in U. maydis [13]. These 981 clones constitute a 35.1% of
the unique sequences (2,793) that showed sequence similarity (at the level E-value < 10-5) with at least one organism (animals, plants or fungi). This number is perhaps
slightly low because it has been described that about 40%
of the total genes in an eukaryotic genome may be shared
with other eukaryotes of different kingdoms, although
this does not mean that they are all essential genes
[61,62]. This slightly low percentage could be due to the
fact that our EST data set constitutes only a portion of the
genome.
T. harzianum sequences found to have similar sequences
only in fungal species totalled 1,474 (42.4%). This percentage is much higher than what was found in U. maydis
(12.3%) [13]. There may be genes among these that have
retained phylogenetic signatures dating to the separation
of fungi and animals, or genes with signatures representing further changes leading to the current state of T. harzianum.

Conclusion
The 8,710 ESTs identified in this study represent the major
attempt so far to define the T. harzianum gene set and represent about 3,478 genes. Thus, these data dramatically

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:193

increase the number of identified T. harzianum genes. The
clone collection offers a base for expression profiling, enabling the identification of genes involved in specific physiological processes. The application of these results is not
only of a great interest in biocontrol of plant-pathogens
but also in the searching of genes with high biotechnological value.

for 36 h. Biomass was treated as indicated above and
transferred to MM under the following conditions in separate cultures: (i) (ii) MM containing 1.5% chitin during
8 and 20 h, respectively (iii) MM buffered at pH 2.5 with
HCl containing 1.5% chitin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) during
8 h, or (iv) MM containing 2% glucose, in nitrogen starvation conditions (50 mg/l ammonium sulphate), during 8
h.

Methods
Fungal strains
T. harzianum CECT 2413 (Spanish Type Culture Collection, Valencia, Spain) was used in this study. Phytophthora
syringae CECT 2351, B. cinerea CECT 2100, Penicillium
aurantiogriseum IMI 374515 (International Mycological
Institute, Egham, UK) and Rhizoctonia solani CECT 2815
were used as a source to obtain fungal cell walls. The fungal strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA,
Difco Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD).
cDNA libraries construction
A set of more than eight different conditions, most of
them designed in order to simulate biocontrol processes
were used to build specific and mixed cDNA libraries. The
following libraries were made for the "TrichoEST" project:
L02, L03, L05, L06, L08, L10, L11 and L15 (Table 1).

For the L02 library the biomass was obtained following a
two-step liquid culture procedure. First, T. harzianum
CECT 2413 was grown in a minimal medium [63] (MM:
15 g/l NaH2PO4, 5 g/l (NH4)2SO4, 600 mg/l CaCl.2H2O,
600 mg/l MgSO4.7H2O, 5 mg/l FeSO4, 2 mg/l CoCl2, 1.6
mg/l MnSO4, 1.4 mg/l ZnSO4), containing 2% glucose as
carbon source, in baffled flasks at 25°C and 160 rpm for
two days. Biomass was harvested, rinsed twice with sterile
distilled water and transferred to MM [63] containing
0.5% of a 1:1 mixture of fungal cell walls from P. syringae
and B. cinerea. It was incubated during 9 h.
For the L03 library, T. harzianum was grown in potato dextrose broth (Difco Becton Dickinson), in baffled flasks at
25°C and 160 rpm for two days. Biomass was treated as
indicated above and transferred to MM under the following conditions in separate cultures: (i) 0.1% glucose, (ii)
1.5% chitin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), (iii) a 100-fold
increase in the concentration of metals or (iv) 1% of a 1:1
mixture of fungal cell walls from P. aurantiogriseum and B.
cinerea. The cultures were incubated under these conditions for 8 and 12 h.
No pre-culture was performed when L05 library was
made. T. harzianum was directly grown in MM containing
5% glucose during 30 h.

In order to make the L15 library no pre-culture was performed. Trichoderma was directly grown in MM containing
0.1% polygalacturonic acid, 0.1% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.1% pectin, 0.1% xylan and 0.2% glucose, at 28°C
during 36 h.
Growth conditions for the remaining libraries involved
solid media. For the L06 library, the biomass was
obtained after Trichoderma was cultured (1.5 × 106 spores
onto cellophane sheets) in solid MM containing 0.1%
glucose or PPG medium (2% dextrose, 2% smashed potatoes, 2% agar) plates. For the L08 library, the biomass was
obtained after Trichoderma was cultured during three days
(1.5 × 106 spores onto cellophane sheets) in solid MM
containing 0.02% colloidal chitin as carbon source.
Finally, for the L11 library, plates of MM containing 0.2%
glucose were inoculated with one 0.5-cm mycelial plugs
of R. solani. After 3.5 days of incubation, R. solani was covered with a cellophane sheet and then, one plug of T. harzianum was inoculated on the top of the cellophane, in the
other side of the plate, 5 cm far each other. After 3.5 days
of growth at 25°C, mycelia were recovered from the Trichoderma overgrowth zone
In all cases, mycelia were harvested, rinsed twice with sterile distilled water, freeze-dried and kept at -80°C until
RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from the mycelia by
grinding them with a mortar and pestle under liquid
nitrogen and extracted using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After total RNA extraction, an equal
amount of RNA from the different growth conditions was
mixed and mRNA was purified using poliA columns
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (for the libraries L02, L05, L10
and L11) or Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). The
cDNA libraries were constructed using the UNI-ZAP® XR
Vector System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the
manufacturer's instructions, excepting for the libraries
L08 and L11, where the kit "Creator Smart cDNA library
construction" (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used.
In the latter case, it was performed a PCR in order to
amplify the cDNA, before the cDNA cloning step.

For the L10 library, T. harzianum was grown in MM containing 4% glucose, in baffled flasks at 25°C and 160 rpm

Clone isolation
In vivo excision of pBluescript® plasmids from Uni-ZAP®
XR vector was performed in SOLR Escherichia coli host cells
(Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells were plated on Q-Tray plates containing LB (LuriaBertani) agar medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin
and then, they were grown at 37°C overnight. Colonies
were picked and then were distributed into known positions into 384-well plates, previously filled with 60 µl
freezing medium per well, using a QPix robot (Genetix,
New Milton, UK). One liter of freezing medium included:
900 ml of LB glycerol (10 g/l NaCl, 10 g tryptone, 5 g/l
yeast extract and 44 ml/l glycerol), 100 ml of a solution
composed by 90 ml of a mixture of salts (6.27 g K2HPO4,
1.80 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g trisodium citrate and 0.90 g ammonium sulphate, per each 90 ml) and 10 ml MgSO4 (0.1 g
per each 10 ml), and 100 mg ampicillin. Well plates were
incubated at 37°C overnight and then frozen at -80°C
until used.
DNA sequencing
Template DNA was extracted using a modified alkaline
lysis protocol. Sequencing reactions were performed following standard Big Dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) protocols for a 0.25X reaction. Cycle sequencing was
performed over 35 cycles (96°C for 10 s; 50°C for 5 s;
60°C for 4 min) in an Applied Biosystems GenAmp 9700
thermocycler. Multiscreen 96-well plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used for dye-terminator removal. The 5'
end of each clone was sequenced using an ABI 3,100 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence processing
The data were managed and stored using software specifically developed for the project. EST sequencing was performed and only the sequences containing more than 150

bases, with the program Phred [21] quality values greater
than 20, were selected. Then, the EST sequences were
cleaned using three programs included in the EMBOSS
package [64]: Vectorstrip (for removing vector contamination), Trimseq (for removing the ambiguous ends of the
sequences) and Trimest (for removing poly-A tails).
Finally, the EST sequences were assembled into contigs
using CAP3 [65]. Singlets and multisequence contigs
resulting from this curation and assembly process were
annotated on MySQL tables to build the TrichoEST database. A contig viewer written in PHP was used to browse
the contigs. Several scripts in PHP and Python were used
to parse the CAP3 standard output into MySQL tables.
This method provided us with a clean table to keep exclusively unique sequences.
All unique sequences were queried against the NCBI nonredundant (nr) database (by January 2,006) and different
datasets obtained for each species (Table 6) using the
BLASTX algorithm [36] with default parameters. We also
used the tBLASTX algorithm [36] with default parameters
to compare our sequences with other collections of ESTs
from Trichoderma. All unique sequences were submitted to
InterProScan analysis [29] in order to search for protein
motifs. A Java application was prepared to undertake the
complex BLAST and InterPro analysis. This application
was based in the BioJava library that was compatible with
the API functions of a grid supercomputing facility available at our labs (based on the InnerGrid package, by
GridSystems). Redundancy of the collections of ESTs was
calculated as [1- (Number of unique sequences/Number
of sequenced ESTs)] × 100. For this purpose, we only considered those sequenced ESTs that passed the quality criteria. Prediction of signal peptide cleavage sites was
carried out by both the Hidden Markov Model and neural
network modules of SignalP 3.0 [25].

Assignment of GO terms
Annotations were based on the Gene Ontology (GO)
terms and hierarchical structure [22]. The unigene set of
EST contigs and singlets were annotated using the program Blast2GO [23,66] using the E-value < 10-5 level.
Blast2GO assigns the GO terms based on the BLAST definitions. The GO term annotations were merged and
loaded into the AmiGO browser and database [67].
Accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences of the generated ESTs were
deposited in the EMBL database and have been assigned
to
accession
numbers
from
[EMBL:AJ893574]
[EMBL:AJ904494] inclusive. They are available as supplementary data in the additional files 1 and 3.
