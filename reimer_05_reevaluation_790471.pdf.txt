Abstract
Background: Tumor-associated antigens are appreciated as diagnostic markers, but they have
also prompted tremendous efforts to develop tumor-specific immunotherapy. A previously cloned
tumor-associated antigen, EBAG9, was initially defined by reactivity with the monoclonal antibody
22-1-1. Functionally, the EBAG9-encoded gene-product was believed to induce apoptosis in
activated immune cells. However, using a cell-biological approach we identified EBAG9 as a Golgiresident modulator of O-linked glycan expression, the latter product was then recognized by the
22-1-1 antibody. Secondly, EBAG9 expression was found physiologically in all murine tissues
examined. This raised the question if EBAG9 is tumor-specific and mediates apoptosis itself or
through O-linked glycans generated, among them the cognate 22-1-1 antigen Tn.
Methods: We have used immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of 22-1-1 and EBAG9
in various tissues. Correlation between expression of both antigens in cell lines was analysed by
immunoblot and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was studied by using flow cytometry and CaspaseGlo™ 3/7 assay kit. Cellular distribution of EBAG9 was analysed by electron and confocal
microscopy.
Results: Here, we compared expression of the 22-1-1 and EBAG9-defined antigens in normal and
neoplastic tissues in situ. In contrast to 22-1-1 staining, EBAG9 is a ubiquitously expressed antigen
in all normal and cancerous tissues. Functional studies on the role of 22-1-1 reactive material did
not support any evidence for apoptosis induction. Employing electron and confocal microscopy, a
refined subcellular localization of EBAG9 at the Golgi was obtained.
Conclusion: We suggest that the estrogen-inducible EBAG9 gene-product and the 22-1-1 defined
antigen are structurally and functionally separate antigens.

Background
In tumor immunology considerable effort has been made
to discover tumor specific antigens. Numerous antigens
were introduced and cancer vaccines based on these antigens have been shown in pre-clinical studies to elicit
tumor-specific immunity and establish long-term memory without inducing an autoimmune response [1]. Other
important clinical applications of tumor-associated antigens include a role as markers for diagnosis of onset and
relapse of cancer.
Recently, the tumor-associated antigen RCAS1 has
received considerable attention. Initially, RCAS1 was
defined by the 22-1-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb),
which was raised by immunization of mice with the
human uterine cervical adenocarcinoma cell line SiSo [2].
Expression cloning led to the identification of a cDNA
apparently encoding the 22-1-1 antigen. The gene product
was termed " receptor binding cancer antigen expressed
on SiSo cells" (RCAS1) and is identical with the estrogenresponsive protein EBAG9 (estrogen receptor-binding
fragment-associated gene 9) [3,4]. In this report, we refer
to the term EBAG9. Cell surface staining with 22-1-1 mAb
was shown immunohistochemically in a large number of
different tumor tissues [5-7]. Protein expression of
EBAG9, as detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal
anti EBAG9 serum, was reported in ovarian cancer cell
lines [8]. Functionally, cell culture supernatant from SiSo
cells was proposed to inhibit proliferation of activated T
lymphocytes and K562 cells and to induce apoptotic cell
death in receptor bearing cells [3]. Therefore, EBAG9 was
introduced as a new death receptor ligand involved in
tumor immune escape, reminiscent of the Fas/Fas ligand
system [9].
Since EBAG9 and 22-1-1 are broadly used as synonymous
functional terms, a misleading picture emerged. We have
recently reported that the EBAG9 encoded antigen is a predominantly Golgi-localized protein with a short transmembrane N-terminus and a large cytoplasmic Cterminus [10]. Upon reexamination, we found out that
EBAG9 has a palmitoylation anchor, responsible for
membrane attachment and functional protein-protein
interactions [11]. EBAG9 is not recognized by the 22-1-1
mAb itself, instead we were able to show that EBAG9 overexpression leads to the generation of the normally cryptic
O-linked glycan Tn, which is then recognized by the 22-11 antibody [10]. Of note, aberrant glycosylation of glycoproteins or glycolipids is often associated with neoplastic
transformation [12,13].
Since many attempts are made to correlate mAb 22-1-1
reactivity and EBAG9 expression with clinical prognosis or
even pathogenesis of tumors, these reports prompted us

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/47

to revisit tumor-specificity of both antigens and their suggested role in induction of apoptosis.

Methods
Immunohistochemistry
The specimens analysed included 10 cases of each of squamous cell carcinoma from the oral cavity, adenocarcinoma of the lung, gastric, colorectal and prostate
carcinomas. In addition to the invasive prostatic carcinoma 2 cases showed areas of high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III). The carcinomas
selected for investigation showed various degrees of differentiation and were always surrounded by various nonneoplastic tissues. All cases were retrieved from the files of
the Institute of Pathology, Charité, Campus Benjamin
Franklin, Medical University Berlin, Germany.

Four micrometer thick sections from paraffin-embedded
tissue specimens were cut, dewaxed and subjected to antigen retrieval before incubation with primary antibodies.
This consisted of a brief, high-temperature heating of the
sections immersed in various solutions in a high-pressure
cooker [14]. In the case of 22-1-1 (IgM; MBL, Göttingen,
Germany, 1:200), 1 mM EDTA-NaOH at pH 8.0 and a
heating time of 1 min was employed, while the conditions
for Ab-1/clone 5E4 (IgG1; Oncogene, San Diego, CA,
USA, 1:100) were a citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) and a
heating time of 2 min. Appropriate control experiments
involving isotype controls mouse IgG1 and IgM (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) were performed. Bound
antibodies were detected by using the streptavidin-biotinalkaline phosphatase method and New-Fuchsin as chromogen.
All
reagents
were
purchased
from
DakoCytomation.
Cell lines
All cell lines employed and their tissue origin are listed in
Table 1. Cell lines HBL-100, Colo-205, ZR-75-1, H-184
A1, T-47D, CAL-51 and MDA-MB-468 were kindly provided by Drs. U. Karsten and U. Jandrig (MDC, Berlin).
The other cell lines were obtained from the DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures,
Braunschweig, Germany).
Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Cell lysate preparation and electrophoresis were performed according to Engelsberg et al. [10]. Proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with
anti-EBAG9 serum (1:1000) and α-actin antibody (Sigma,
Taufkirchen, Germany) overnight at 4°C. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL,
USA), bound proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany).

Expression of antigen on the cell surface was determined by incubation with 22-1-1 antibody and analysed by flow cytometry. Expression of EBAG9
was determined by immunoblot using the anti-EBAG9 serum. (+++, very high expression, ++, high expression, +, intermediate expression, -, no
expression).

Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed according to
Engelsberg et al. [10]. Briefly, cells were incubated with
22-1-1 or an isotype control IgM (1:100) for 1 h on ice
and next with a biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Bound antibodies were detected with PE-conjugated streptavidin
(Southern Biotechnology), and flow cytometric analysis
was carried out on a FACSCalibur™ cytometer (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany).
Electron microscopy
HEK293 A cells were stably transfected with a GFP-tagged
EBAG9 construct and selected with G418 (400 µg/ml).
Cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde/0.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 0.18 M sucrose for 1 h at
room temperature. Following harvesting and washing
with 0.1 M phosphate buffer/0.18 M sucrose cells were
infiltrated with 1.8 M sucrose/20 % polyvinylpyrrolidone
(K15, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) overnight. Ultrathin cryosections (70 nm) were obtained according to Tokuyasu
[15] using an ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung Ultracut S)
attached to a cryosystem FC4S. GFP was detected with a
polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK,
1:400) diluted in a washing buffer containing 1 % BSA
(fraction V; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and 0.12% glycine in phosphate buffered saline. For signal detection, 12
nm colloidal gold-AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG, EM
grade (Jackson Immuno Research Lab., Inc., West Grove,
PA, USA) was used. Cryosections were contrasted and sta-

bilized with a mixture of 3 % tungstosilicic acid hydrate
(Fluka) and 2.5 % polyvinyl alcohol (Mr 10000, Sigma)
according to Kärgel et al. [16]. Electron micrographs were
taken with a Philips EM 400T at an acceleration voltage of
80 kV. As a control, non-transfected HEK293 A cells were
used.
Apoptosiss assays
For the assessment of apoptosis, we used an annexin VFITC apoptosis detection kit (Dako) according to the
manufacturer's instruction. For coculture experiments,
supernatant (RPMI 1640/10 % FCS) from subconfluent
MCF-7 cells was obtained after 3–4 days. It was precleared
from particulate matter by centrifugation and further concentrated by pressure filtration in an Amicon chamber
(cut-off 15 kD). K562 cells were incubated with 10 × concentrated supernatant medium from MCF-7 cells diluted
at a ratio of 1:4, normal or 10 × concentrated RPMI
medium, diluted as described above. Cells were incubated
for 48 h and apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-FITC/
propidium iodide staining. For treatment with glycans,
cells (1 × 105) were grown in a 24-well plate and incubated with β-GalNAc-PAA-biotin, β-GlcNAc-PAA, α-GalNAc-PAA (Tn) and Galβ1-2Galβ (TF) (Syntesome,
Munich, Germany) in a concentration of 50 or 100 µg/ml
for 48 h. Apoptosis was assessed by analysis of activation
of caspase -3 and -7 using the substrate DEVD-aminoluciferin from Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 assay kit (Promega,
Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's
instruction. As a positive control, UV irradiated K562 cells

were used. Data were analysed using Excel software. Student's t test was used to determine significance. Results are
expressed as the mean ± SD.
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy
HEK293 A cells expressing EBAG9-GFP were grown on
coverslips for 48 h and incubated with brefeldin A (BFA,
5 µg/ml) for 15, 30 and 60 minutes, or with nocodazole
(Noc, 10 µg/ml) for 2 h. Next, cells were fixed with 3 %
paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.25 % Triton X-100 for 5 min.
Cells were stained with anti-mannosidase II (Chemicon
Int., Temecula, CA, USA, 1:100) and anti-TGN38 (BD
Transduction Lab., Heidelberg, Germany, 1:100) antibodies overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed, and bound antibodies were detected with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or
goat anti-mouse antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated
Alexa Fluor™ 568 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Signals were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510
inverted laser scanning microscope and processed in LSM
5 image browser.

Results
Immunohistochemical comparison of 22-1-1 and Ab-1
staining in non-neoplastic normal tissue
The clinical significance of EBAG9 expression has been
assessed using the 22-1-1 antibody in immunohistochemistry. To our knowledge, only three reports make use of a
polyclonal antibody generated against recombinant
EBAG9 [8,17,18]. However, all conclusions drawn from
these studies were based on the assumption that the 22-11 antigen was identical to the EBAG9 encoded antigen.

Since we recently identified the O-linked glycan Tn as the
antigen recognized by mAb 22-1-1, we asked whether the
22-1-1 defined antigen was tumor-specific, and whether
this mAb recognizes the same antigenic structure as a
monoclonal anti-EBAG9 antibody, Ab-1. Our previous
observations were made in cell lines, therfore we now
applied both antibodies in a side-by-side immunohistochemical analysis to a variety of tumor entities and regular
tissues.
In normal gastric epithelia 22-1-1 stained mucous epithelia of the surface and neck of gastric foveolae, displaying
an intense cytoplasmic labeling (Figure 1 a, c). The antral
glands and the chief and parietal cells of the body of stomach were negative. There was always a positive labeling of
complete intestinal metaplasia areas in a pattern similar
to that observed in enterocytes and goblet cells (see
below). The neuroendocrine cells located in the basal
parts of foveoles showed also a weak cytoplasmic labeling. In comparison, the Ab-1 mAb showed an intense
cytoplasmic labeling of parietal and chief cells while all
other cells displayed a weak cytoplasmic labeling. Also the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/47

antrum type glands showed a cytoplasmic positivity (Figure 1 b, d).
In glandular epithelia, among them colonic enterocytes,
mAb 22-1-1 exhibited granular labeling of the apical portion of cells (Figure 1 e, g). Only occasionally goblet cells
showed an intense cytoplasmic labeling. In contrast, Ab-1
labeling was obtained in basal and apical portions of all
cells except goblet cells which were constantly negative
(Figure 1 f, h).
A third example with striking differences of staining patterns between both antibodies includes normal prostate
tissue where staining with 22-1-1 was seen in glandular
epithelia with a prominent labeling of the apical cytoplasmic portions (Figure 1i). Of note, also the secretions were
intensely positive. Ab-1 stained prostate epithelia in a dotlike perinuclear pattern whereas secretions were essentially negative (Figure 1j). In summary, in healthy tissue
Ab-1 invariably stains all cell types and is consistently negative for secreted matter from glandular tissues. In contrast, 22-1-1 reactivity is restricted to a characteristic apical
cytoplasmic or plasma membrane pattern in glandular tissues being always positive in mucous secretions. Other
normal tissues with striking differences between both
antibodies included epidermis, salivary glands, pulmonary alveolar cells and hematolymphoid cells (data not
shown).
Immunohistochemical comparison of 22-1-1 and Ab-1
staining in adenocarcinomas
Next, antibodies 22-1-1 and Ab-1 were compared for their
reactivity towards adenocarcinomas derived from stomach, colon, prostate, and lung (Figure 2). With the 22-1-1
mAb, we observed that neoplastic cells usually exhibited
strong cytoplasmic labeling (Figure 2 a, e, g, i). Of course,
the labeling was not always homogeneous in the entire
tumor specimen. In the case of more differentiated carcinomas the labeling was more intense in neoplastic cells
adjacent to luminal structures (Figure 2c). Mucous secretions as well as intracellular mucin were always intensely
positive (this being most prominent in signet ring cell carcinomas of the stomach, Figure 2a). Frequently the neoplastic infiltrate became easily visible at low
magnification due to its more intense staining compared
to the surrounding normal tissues. In case of prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN Grade III- high grade PIN)
the cells were most intensely labeled (Figure 2g). In contrast, Ab-1 usually exhibited a weak ubiquitous, frequently dot-like labeling of neoplastic cells, which
sometimes was more intense than that of the surrounding
normal tissues. Mucous secretions were always entirely
negative (Figure 2 d, f, h, j).

Subcellular localization of EBAG9 analysed by electron microscopy
Subcellular localization of EBAG9 analysed by electron microscopy. Immunogold labeling of HEK293 A cells. EBAG9GFP is found in Golgi cisternae and small vesicles in stably transfected cells. a) small vesicles surrounding the Golgi apparatus,
b) Golgi stacks, c) control-non transfected cells. Bar; 0.5 µm.

EBAG9 is a cis/medial Golgi protein
It has been demonstrated that EBAG9 colocalizes with the
Golgi marker protein 1,4 galactosyltransferase [10]. To
refine the subcellular localization of EBAG9, we first utilized electron microscopy. Ultrathin cryosections of
HEK293 A cells showed a highly specific labeling of GFPtagged EBAG9 on the entire Golgi stack (Figure 3b),
including small vesicles surrounding the Golgi apparatus
(Figure 3a). Sections of non-transfected control cells were
always free of label (Figure 3c).

Secondly, immunofluorescence staining in combination
with confocal microscopy revealed that EBAG9-GFP was
primarily localized to the juxtanuclear region of stably
transfected HEK293 A cells, and colocalized with the cis/
medial Golgi marker protein mannosidase II (Figure 4 a,

b, c). TGN38, a prototypical trans-Golgi protein revealed
only partial overlap (Figure 4 j, k, l). To more rigorously
assess the colocalization of EBAG9 and mannosidase II,
brefeldin A (BFA) [19] treatment was performed. After a
15 min BFA treatment, the Golgi-resident protein mannosidase II was detected in a characteristic ER pattern (Figure 4e), and EBAG9-GFP (Figure 4 d, f) was displaced
from the Golgi cisternae to the cytosol in characteristic
punctate like structures scattered throughout the cells.
Similar observation was done with 60 min of incubation
(Figure 4 g, h, i). Of note, the endogenous EBAG9 protein
behaved similarly (data not shown). Nocodazole [20] was
applied to explore the co-localization of EBAG9 with
TGN38. This treatment revealed that EBAG9-GFP was
only partially localized on the same Golgi fragments as

Almost all tumor cell lines expressed EBAG9 in varying
amounts, indicated by a characteristic double band and
stained with our polyclonal anti EBAG9 serum (Figure 5).
Strongest expression was obtained for MCF-7, K562, SiSo,
and Jurkat cells. To test whether different endogenous
protein expression levels of EBAG9 lead to surface display
of the 22-1-1 antigen, we stained all tumor cell lines with
mAb 22-1-1 and subjected them to flow cytometric analysis (Table 1, see Additional file 1). Only two cell lines,
MCF-7 and Jurkat with high levels of EBAG9 protein
expression were also strongly positive for staining with the
anti-Tn antibody, 22-1-1. Additionally, SiSo cells exhibited moderate 22-1-1 antigen expression. In conclusion,
endogenous expression levels of EBAG9 and Tn antigen
were only partially correlated.

TGN38 (Figure 4 m, n, o). We conclude that EBAG9 is
predominantly expressed at the cis/medial Golgi complex, but also on vesicles derived thereof.
High endogenous expression of EBAG9 only partially
correlates with cell surface expression of the mAb 22-1-1
defined antigen
Cancer cells often exhibit normally cryptic, O-linked glycan structures that can elicit humoral or cellular immune
responses. Transient overexpression of the EBAG9 cDNA
in HEK293 A cells leads to the generation of the antigen
recognized by the mAb 22-1-1, which is identical to the Tn
glycan antigen [10]. To investigate if expression of endogenous EBAG9 correlates with the occurrence of the 22-1-1
antigen, we have chosen several tumor cell lines and
examined their EBAG9 protein content by immunoblot,
whereas 22-1-1 surface staining was assessed by flow
cytometry. Unfortunately, the mAb 22-1-1 was not applicable to immunoblot analysis.

The antigen recognized by the 22-1-1 mAb does not induce
apoptosis
Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, can be induced by
multiple cell signaling mechanisms [21]. Recombinant
EBAG9 has been previously suggested to induce apoptosis
in activated T cells or K562 cells that express an unidentified EBAG9 receptor [3]. We were unable to repeat this
experiment, because EBAG9 is only soluble in the presence of detergents. However, a soluble form of the 22-1-1
antigen was detected in supernatants from SiSo and MCF7 cells, and this form was also suggested to cause apoptosis. To revisit whether an antigen present in culture supernatant of 22-1-1 positive MCF-7 cells can induce
apoptosis, we incubated K562 cells with a dilution of concentrated culture supernatant [5]. To detect apoptosis
induction, K562 cells were stained with annexin V-FITC
and propidium iodide after 48 h of culture. In K562 cells
treated with concentrated supernatant from MCF-7 cells
in a dilution of 1:4, we observed less then 6% of cells positive for annexin V-FITC, which was similar to control cells
(Figure 6 a). Incubation with concentrated regular
medium also failed to induce apoptosis in K562 cells (Figure 6 a). Since we have established that mAb 22-1-1 recognizes the Tn antigen, we asked whether chemically
defined glycans were able to mediate apoptosis. K562
cells were incubated with polyacrylamide-conjugated
(PAA) αGlcNAc, αGalNAc (Tn), TF and βGalNAc in two
different concentrations (50 and 100 µg/ml) and subjected to caspase -3 and -7 activity assay. As shown in Figure 6 b, essentially no caspase activity was observed in
K562 cells incubated with glycans compared to control
cells irradiated with UV light (P). In conclusion, we found
no evidence for apoptosis induction with the antigen recognized by the 22-1-1 mAb.

Discussion
EBAG9 was originally described as a novel tumor associated antigen with a functional role in tumor-immune
interactions [3]. Cell culture supernatant from SiSo cells

inhibited the proliferation of activated T cells and induced
apoptotic cell death in receptor bearing cells. Furthermore, recombinantly expressed EBAG9 was suggested to
bind to a yet unidentified receptor on activated immune
cells and on K562 cells. From these observations and from
the detection of apoptotic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
surrounding 22-1-1 mAb stained tumor lesions [3,22] it
was inferred that EBAG9 is a new death receptor ligand
involved in tumor immune escape [23]. In the present
study, we have extended our previous cell biological characterization of EBAG9, resulting in conclusions that are
not consistent with the currently held view on the functional and clinical role of EBAG9.
We first addressed the question whether EBAG9 is a
tumor-specific marker. Recently, we and others have
pointed out that EBAG9 is highly conserved in phylogeny,
and the gene-product was found to be expressed in all
murine tissues examined [24]. Applying immunohistochemistry on a representative selection of tumor and normal human tissue specimen, reactivity with the EBAG9specific monoclonal antibody Ab-1, generated against a
recombinant EBAG9 fusion protein, was seen in essentially all tissues and cell types examined. Staining in
benign or malignant cell types was confined to a cytoplasmic pattern. In tumor infiltrating plasma cells a Golgi-like
distribution could be clearly seen. Secondly, referring to
our previous report [10] we asked whether the cognate 221-1 antigen and the EBAG9 antigen are distinguishable in
situ. In a side-by-side comparison of both antibodies in
immunohistochemistry, we confirmed significant differences between 22-1-1 and Ab-1 antibody reactivities.
Most striking examples for differences in immunostaining
included normal glandular tissues, among them gastric
epithelia, colon and normal prostate tissue. Of note, 22-11 constantly stained secreted matter from glandular
tissues, whereas Ab-1 was always negative for mucus. In
agreement with previous reports [5,23], 22-1-1 staining is
not limited to malignant tissue, but is also seen in normal
gastric, colon and prostate epithelia. In case of adenocarcinomas, strong staining for the 22-1-1 mAb was observed
in signet ring cell carcinomas with an intense labeling of
the intracellular mucin. In sharp contrast those neoplastic
cells remained almost negative with Ab-1. In most cases,
the expression of the 22-1-1 antigen was enhanced in adenocarcinomas as compared to their normal counterpart.
This was not the case for the antigen recognized by Ab-1.
Other marked differences were seen with mucous secretions and with the subcellular distribution of the epitope
recognized by Ab-1. This conclusion is substantiated by
only partial correlation between endogenous EBAG9 protein levels and the corresponding expression profiles for
the 22-1-1 antigen in human tumor cell lines, as determined by immunoblotting or flow cytometry,
respectively.

The staining pattern obtained for 22-1-1 was almost identical to that described for the tumor-associated O-linked
glycan Tn [25,26], thus confirming our epitope identification [10]. In addition, Tn antigen is found as soluble antigen in serum of tumor patients, an observation that is also
shared with the occurrence of 22-1-1 soluble antigen
[4,27].
We also refined the subcellular localization of the EBAG9encoded antigen. EBAG9-GFP localized predominantly to
the Golgi cisternae and to small vesicles surrounding the
Golgi apparatus, as evidenced by immuno-electronmicroscopy. A more functional analysis revealed sensitivity to
BFA and a corresponding colocalization with the cis/
medial Golgi marker, mannosidase II. These findings
identify EBAG9 as a predominantly Golgi localized protein which is unlikely to be secreted. Our results shed
doubt on the hypothesis that soluble 22-1-1 reactive
material induces apoptotic cell death in activated immune
cells or other receptor bearing cells. This earlier conclusion rests on two different experimental approaches,
either the incubation of activated T cells or K562 cells with
culture supernatant, as obtained from SiSo or MCF-7 cells,
or the exposure to recombinantly expressed EBAG9 protein [3,23]. Functional readout for both systems was the
detection of apoptotic cell death. However, none of the
apoptotic pathways have been elucidated yet. We have
previously pointed out that full-length recombinant
EBAG-GST is not soluble in aqueous solutions and
requires the presence of detergent. Therefore, it was reasonable to suggest that cell viability in assays using recombinant EBAG9 was most likely affected by residual
detergent [10]. In our hands, cell culture supernatant from
22-1-1 positive MCF-7 cells failed to induce apoptosis in
K562 cells. Likewise, the O-linked glycan recognized by
22-1-1, Tn (αGalNAc), did not induce apoptosis in K562
cells. Presently, we cannot reconcile our data with those
published earlier.
In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that the antigens
recognized by 22-1-1 and the EBAG9 antibody, Ab-1, are
different. It follows that studies on the correlation of
EBAG9 expression and clinical prognosis were correct as
long as their screens were based on RT-PCR or immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti EBAG9 antibody [8]. In contrast, functional and clinical studies on the 22-1-1 defined
antigen (Tn) need to be revisited, and should be compared to other studies obtained with anti-Tn antibodies.
At present, a direct link between the occurrence of Tn and
expression levels of EBAG9 is still elusive, since we
observed a correlation in some cell lines, but not in others. Provided that the physiologically occurring molecule
EBAG9 is indeed dysregulated or mutated in tumors, this
should prompt further investigations on the role of
EBAG9 in the modulation of O-linked glycan expression.
