the Flury-LEP strain
Short report

Abstract
The entire genome of rabies virus vaccine strain Flury-LEP-C, a Chinese variant of the rabies virus vaccine strain FluryLEP, was sequenced. The overall length of the genome of Flury-LEP-C strain was 11 924 nucleotides (nt), comprising a
leader sequence of 58 nt, nucleoprotein (N) gene of 1353 nt, phosphoprotein (P) gene of 894 nt, matrix protein (M)
gene of 609 nt, glycoprotein (G) gene of 1575 nt, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, L) gene of 6384 nt, and a
trailer region of 70 nt. There was TGAAAAAAA (TGA7) consensus sequence in the end of each gene in Flury-LEP-C
genome, except G gene which had a GAGAAAAAAA sequence in the end of the non-coding G-L region. There were
AACAYYYCT consensus start signal close to the TGA7. Flury-LEP-C has 310 nucleotides more than HEP-Flury in G-L
intergenic region. The analysis showed that the residue at 333 of the mature G protein was Arg, which was reported to
be related to pathogenicity. Compared with FluryLEP, there were 19 different amino acids (AAs) in five proteins of FluryLEP-C, including 15 AAs which were identical with corresponding residues of Hep-Flury, and 4 AAs which were neither
identical with the residues of FluryLEP nor with the residues of Hep-Flury. The results showed the topology of the
phylogenetic trees generated by two protein sequences were similar. It was demonstrated that HN10, BD06, FJ009,
FJ008, D02, D01, F04, F02 have a close relationship to CTN-1 and CTN181, and MRV was closely related to Flury-LEP,
HEP-Flury and Flury-LEP-C.
Findings
The rabies virus belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family and
the Lyssavirus genus. The genome of the rabies virus is a
non-segmented, anti-sense, single-stranded RNA which
is about 12, 000 nucleotides (nt) long. Viral RNA encodes
five major proteins: nucleoprotein (N-protein), phosphoprotein (P protein), matrix protein (M-protein), glycoprotein (G-protein) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase
(L-protein) [1].
It was reported there were still high rabies cases happened in China, especially in rural China, about 5537
fatalities per year in 80's, and about 3300 fatalities in 2007
[2-5]. During recent years, most of the research on the
control of rabies has concentrated on the development of
oral vaccine, including attenuated vaccine and live vectored vaccines. However, these virus strains are still
pathogenic for laboratory and wild rodents or wildlife
species, and several rabies cases caused by such vaccines
have been reported [6,7]. It was reported some rabies

virus in China was closely related to several vaccine
strains [8]. The main goal of the present study was to
obtain the entire genome sequence of vaccine strain
Flury-LEP-C, a Chinese variant of the rabies virus vaccine
strain Flury-LEP, including the 3'- and 5'-terminal noncoding regions of the genome. The genome sequence has
been compared to the sequences of other vaccine strains
used in China and street strains in China available from
GenBank. The data obtained from vaccine strain and
street strain can lead to a better understanding and more
effective strategies to control the spread of rabies.
Here, we obtained the full length genome of Flury-LEPC strain by RT-PCR or RACE similar to the method
described by Marston et al. [9]. Using a total of 12 primers (as shown in Table 1), the entire genome of FluryLEP-C strain was amplified as 5 separate overlapping
PCR products. The result showed that the full genome of
rabies virus strain Flury-LEP-C consists of 11924 nt. The
full length sequence was submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession numbers FJ577895).
In the full genome sequence of Flury-LEP-C, the leader
sequence was 58 nt in length, while trailer sequence was

3' leader and 5' trailer termini showed exactly complementary for the terminal 11 nt of all RVs, except that
MRV and DRV showed different 3'-terminus and 5'-terminus end.

Between the transcription stop and start signals, there
was an intergenic sequence (IGS), which was not transcribed into mRNA. The N/P IGS was CT. The P/M IGS
was CAGGC, and M/G IGS was CTATT. The IGS
between the non-coding G-L region and L gene was 21

The G-L intergenic region is a non-coding region. It
was reported that this region was highly susceptible to
random mutations, unrestricted by structure and function requirements or by immunological pressure [10].
Comparison result in this study showed that the G-L
intergenic region of Flury-LEP-C has 310 nucleotides
more than that of HEP-Flury (Fig. 3), which demonstrate
that the non-coding G-L region was more prone to
mutate. The observation indicates that the region may be

used as an insertion site for a marker gene to construct a
marker vaccine. However, studies should be undertaken
to
confirm
this
hypothesis.
Rabies virus encodes five structural proteins in the
order of N-P-M-G-L. The length of five genes of FluryLEP-C strain were 1353 nt, 894 nt, 609 nt, 1575 nt, 6384
nt, respectively. There was TGAAAAAAA (TGA7) consensus sequence in the end of each gene in Flury-LEP-C
genome, except that G gene had a GAGAAAAAAA

sequence in the end of the non-coding G-L region. There
were AACAYYYCT consensus start signal close to the
TGA7. The main difference between Flury LEP and
Flury-LEP-C was that the latter has 12 nt more than the
former in L gene (Table 3). Further studies are necessary
to elucidate the role of these mutations in Flury-LEP-C.
The entire amino acid sequence of Flury-LEP-C was
aligned with 17 entire genome sequences (as shown in
table 2) obtained from the GenBank. Analysis of deduced
amino acid sequences from open reading frames (ORFs)
of N, P, M, G, and L genes revealed 98.81%, 93.94%,
96.75%, 95.12%, 97.69%. Szanto reported that P gene was
the most variable gene[11], similar result was obtained in
Flury-LEP-C.
The G gene does indeed encode a product of 524 amino
acids but this includes a 19 amino acid N-terminal signal
peptide that is cleaved to generate the mature product of
505 amino acids. It was reported that the G protein plays
an important role in viral pathogenicity and protective
immunity, especially residue Arg333 [1,12-17]. Jackson et
al. reported that less neurovirulent strain, which contains
an attenuating substitution of Arg333 in the rabies virus
glycoprotein, was a stronger inducer of neuronal apoptosis and there was an inverse relationship between patho-

genicity and apoptosis [18]. In this study, the analysis
showed that the residue at 333 of the mature G protein
was Arg.
P protein is a structural component of the RNP. And P
protein is also crucially involved in numerous events during the virus life cycle, including proper formation of viral
RNPs and virus particles and viral RNA synthesis [14].
The P protein has been shown to interact with LC8 (cytoplasmic dynein light chain) at residues 138-172 [19,20],
specifically the motif K/RXTQT at residues 145-149 [20].
Mebatsion found that the deletions introduced into the
LC8 binding site abolished the P-LC8 interaction,
blocked LC8 incorporation into virions, and reduced the
efficiency of peripheral spread of the virus, but LC8 is
dispensable for the spread of a pathogenic RV from a
peripheral site to the CNS [19]. We found that the minimal binding motif for LC8 at residues 145-149 of P protein was KSTQT in all rabies sequences in this study,
except that SHBRV-18 has a KATQT motif.
Compared with FluryLEP, there were 19 different
amino acids (AAs) in five proteins of Flury-LEP-C,
including 15 AAs which were identical with corresponding residues of Hep-Flury, and 4 AAs which were neither
identical with the residues of FluryLEP nor with the resi-

dues of Hep-Flury (table 3). Comparison of L protein of
all RVs in table 2 showed that all RVs, except Hep-Flury
and FluryLEP, have these four insertions in L protein.
Studies are undertaking to find difference in phenotypic
characteristics between the Flury-LEP-C and its parental
strain FluryLEP.
In this study, two kinds of proteins were used to construct the phylogeny tree. First, nucleotide sequences of
five viral genes of each strain were translated into protein
sequences and joined to one sequence in the original
order, based on which a phylogenetic tree was generate
(Fig. 4). Second, P protein, due to its multifunctional
nature including its ability to interact with host-cell proteins [21], were also used to construct a phylogeny tree
(Fig. 5). The results showed the topology of the phylogenetic trees generated by these two methods were similar.
It was demonstrated that HN10, BD06, FJ009, FJ008, D02,
D01, F04, F02 have a close relationship to CTN-1 and
CTN181, which means the homology between the CTN
stains and the Chinese street strains was much higher
than that of any other vaccine strain. And MRV was
closely related to Flury-LEP, HEP-Flury and Flury-LEP-C,
but DRV formed an outlying clade. The CTN (or its derivates, including CTN-1 and CTN181), PV and PM strains
are the human rabies virus vaccine strains, and FluryLEP,

HEP-Flury, ERA and CTN-1 are the veterinary rabies
virus vaccine strains currently used in China. It was
hypothesized the CTN strain should be most suitable for
use in China as a vaccine strain [10,22], and the result in
our study also supported the hypothesis.
