Abstract
Background: Clan AA of aspartic peptidases relates the family of pepsin monomers evolutionarily
with all dimeric peptidases encoded by eukaryotic LTR retroelements. Recent findings describing
various pools of single-domain nonviral host peptidases, in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, indicate
that the diversity of clan AA is larger than previously thought. The ensuing approach to investigate
this enzyme group is by studying its phylogeny. However, clan AA is a difficult case to study due to
the low similarity and different rates of evolution. This work is an ongoing attempt to investigate
the different clan AA families to understand the cause of their diversity.
Results: In this paper, we describe in-progress database and bioinformatic flowchart designed to
characterize the clan AA protein domain based on all possible protein families through ancestral
reconstructions, sequence logos, and hidden markov models (HMMs). The flowchart includes the
characterization of a major consensus sequence based on 6 amino acid patterns with
correspondence with Andreeva's model, the structural template describing the clan AA peptidase
fold. The set of tools is work in progress we have organized in a database within the GyDB project,
referred to as Clan AA Reference Database http://gydb.uv.es/gydb/phylogeny.php?tree=caard.
Conclusion: The pre-existing classification combined with the evolutionary history of LTR
retroelements permits a consistent taxonomical collection of sequence logos and HMMs. This set
is useful for gene annotation but also a reference to evaluate the diversity of, and the relationships
among, the different families. Comparisons among HMMs suggest a common ancestor for all
dimeric clan AA peptidases that is halfway between single-domain nonviral peptidases and those
coded by Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements. Sequence logos reveal how all clan AA families follow
similar protein domain architecture related to the peptidase fold. In particular, each family
nucleates a particular consensus motif in the sequence position related to the flap. The different
motifs constitute a network where an alanine-asparagine-like variable motif predominates, instead
of the canonical flap of the HIV-1 peptidase and closer relatives.

Background
Clan AA of the aspartic peptidases (CAPs) [1] is a group of
proteolytic enzymes that use an aspartate dyad and a molecule of water to hydrolyze a peptide bond [2]. There are
2 major forms of this enzyme; the single domain aspartic
peptidase (LTRCAP) encoded by eukaryotic LTR retroelements, which dimerizes in its active form and the 2domain pepsin monomer, involved in the metabolism
and proteolysis of food by eukaryotes. Because of the similar pseudo-symmetry it is normally assumed that pepsins
evolved from the duplication [3] of an ancestral dimeric
form similar to retroviral proteases [4] (i.e. LTRCAPs).
This scenario is supported by recent issues [5-9] describing 2 related families of single-domain nonviral peptidases in prokaryotes (pSNCAPs) and 3 others (eSNCAPs)
in eukaryotes. However, the split between the 2 structural
forms is probably older than previously thought as
sequencing projects have recently revealed the presence of
pepsin representatives in several prokaryotic genomes
(annotations available at MEROPS [10]). Little is known
about pSNCAPs (COG3577 and COG5550), which are
open reading frames (ORFs) of ~120 residues widely distributed in α-proteobacteria [5] and also present in
archaea such as A. fulgidus (Genbank accession
AAB90625). In contrast, the 3 eSNCAP families namely as
SASPases, DNA-damage inducible(DDI) peptidases, and
neur onal interacting factor × 1 (NIX-1), have been studied more extensively. DDI peptidases are enzymes of ~350
residues in length, widely distributed in plants, fungi and
animals [5] and exhibiting a central CAP domain flanked
by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-associated domains [5,7]. The
recent characterization of the 3D structure of this enzyme
confirms that it is a dimer with a similar fold to LTRCAPs
[6]. NIX-1 is a nuclear receptor-associated protein of ~250
residues [11] that preserves a CAP domain closely related
to that of DDI [5,7]. SASPases constitute a set of host
enzymes of ~280 residues, displaying a single CAP
domain toward the C-terminus. SASPases are specifically
expressed in at least human and mouse epidermis [8,9],
and have been implicated in several dermal side effects
induced by protease (i.e. peptidase) inhibitors in antiAIDS therapy [9].
The derived approach to investigate the relationships
between the new and the old clan AA members is by studying their diversity and phylogeny. However, the evolutionary history of clan AA is extremely difficult to assess.
Retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons are not under the
same pressure of error correction that affects host genes,
the mutation rates of LTR retroelements probably exceed
those of their nonviral counterparts. The large diversity of
eukaryotic LTR retroelements and encoded CAP products
creates a daunting task when trying to establish relationships and make classification. Upon that, it is currently
known that the most representative LTR retroelements

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

inhabiting the eukaryotic genomes can be divided in 5
groups – Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, Retroviridae and
Caulimoviridae (for more details, see [12]). However, the
different CAPs encoded by these groups have proved to be
hard to keep track of in eukaryotic genomes, as most of
these sequences remain unclassified or have conflicting
phylogenetic signal (searches for potential homologues
using LTRCAP queries produce too many hits, most of
which are pseudogenes or deactivated retrotransposons).
An important principle of peptidase classification has
been established by MEROPS [1] (a general database on
enzymology), according to which, pepsins and LTRCAPs
can be divided in five families: A1, A2, A3, A9 and A11 [1].
In this classification, pepsins represent the family A1,
which splits in 2 subfamilies – A1A and A1B. The different
LTRCAPs encoded by vertebrate retroviruses (Retroviridae)
are classified as the family A2 (retropepsins) except those
encoded by spumaretroviruses, which were assigned to
the family A9 (spumaretropepsins). The LTRCAPs
encoded by caulimoviruses and Ty1/Copia LTR retroelements have been assigned to the families A3 and A11,
respectively. MEROPS also classifies a few examples of
Ty3/Gypsy LTRCAPs in several sub-families within the
family A2 because of their similarity to retropepsins.
However, not all Ty3/Gypsy LTRCAPs are similar to retropepsins just as not all the Retroviridae LTRCAPs are retropepsins. In fact, the diversity in Ty3/Gypsy LTRCAPs
greatly exceeds their current classification. LTRCAPs
encoded by Bel/Pao LTR retroelements [12-14] and the different SNCAP families of prokaryotes and eukaryotes have
no current family classification. Beyond MEROPS, there
are no studies addressing an exhaustive sequence evaluation of clan AA in the post-genomic era. Having recognized that, the large diversity of eukaryotic LTR
retroelements revealed by sequencing projects clearly justifies the development and continuous update of a
curated database focusing on the investigation and classification of the different LTRCAP families and their related
host genes.
In this paper, we introduce the Clan AA Reference Database (CAARD), a phylogenetic database hosted at Gypsy
Database (GyDB) Project [15] and developed with the
aim to classify the different clan AA families according to
different estimations of their taxonomy and phylogeny.
The characterization addressed here is compatible to, but
suggests an improvement over the pre-existing classification, as we consider the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements and the recently reported SNCAPs. Thus, we will
be receptive to all MEROPS suggestions to assign family
letters to the different families described in this and further CAARD versions. In fact, the approach is in progress
because the actual diversity of clan AA cannot be realistically determined in a single study. In this first version, we

perform an evaluation of all clan AA families, but pay particular attention to Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTRCAPs
according to their differentiation into clades and genera.
The main objective of this first CAARD version is to investigate the major consensus and phylogeny to typify the
different protein families by sequence logos and HMMs.
With this aim, we designed a flowchart of bioinformatic
analyses to confirm and standardize the phylogenetic signal of each family using maximum likelihood reconstruction (AMLR) before to its characterization by sequence
logos and HMMs. The flowchart is detailed online as an
additional section of CAARD. Finally, we use the set of
sequences logos and HMMs to perform here a comparative approach to explore certain aspects of clan AA related
to the evolutionary history and diversity of this enzyme
group.

Results and discussion
Clan AA families and bioinformatic flowchart
This work is an attempt to characterize the clan AA protein
domain in all its possible phylogenetic signals. With this
goal, we combined the pre-existing classification [1] with
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) [16] and prior studies [5-9,12,15,17], to assign taxonomy levels to 323 non-redundant canonical CAPs
(Table 1). Here, we recognize the 2 pepsin subfamilies A1
and A2 at MEROPS [1] but for analytical purposes, we
divided these 2 into 4 families by considering each pepsin
domain as a separate family. Our classification is work in
progress. In this first version, we pay particular attention
to the classification of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
LTRCAPs according to their differentiation into clades and
genera of LTR retroelements. This classification derives
from prior studies and an exhaustive investigation of the
2 groups based on not only the CAP domain but also on
other protein domains (see [15,18]). In phylogenetic
terms, the current classification is not a particular bias
against other LTRCAPs such as those encoded by Ty1/
Copia and Bel/Pao LTR retroelements because they have
phenotypic features distinguishing them from other
CAPs. Despite this, Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao LTR retroelements are also rich in lineages and variability. In further
versions, we are committed to perform similar investigation based on these and other LTR retroelement groups to
revise the existing clan AA families in light of new data.

The most important difficulty of clan AA is that the families considered here share less than 20% of identity and
follow different phylogenetic signals. This makes it very
difficult to establish conclusions about similarity, major
consensus and evolutionary relationships of the different
families summarized in Table 1. With this aim, we
designed a bioinformatic flowchart using manual means
and software analyses to standardize and characterize the
different phylogenetic signals. The flowchart scheme is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

presented in Figure 1 and we provide extensive description of the flowchart in an additional section of CAARD
available online at [19]. The flowchart consists of 4 steps
– multiple alignments and consensus identification,
information content enhancement, HMMs and sequences
logos, and major consensus.
The first step involves the creation of 34 multiple alignments, one for each family including 2 or more CAPs to
characterize the protein domain architecture of each family (we dismissed the LTRCAPs representing one-sequence
families because they cannot be established in family
alignments). Additionally, we performed a non-redundant single multiple alignment with all CAPs to investigate the phylogeny and major consensus. Here, we used
prior structure-based alignments [4,20] and the
Andreeva's model [21] as the criterion to manually align
the different families. The alignment was refined using the
guide tree illustrated in Figure 1 (an extended version of
this tree is available online, as the Additional file 1). That
is, prior structure-based comparisons between retropepsins and pepsins revealed a common hydrophobic core of
90–190 residues [4,20]. This core can only be used to
describe the similarity between 2 or 3 families, due to the
low amino acid identity among families. In an attempt to
establish a universal reference, Andreeva presented in
1991 a structural template to describe the peptidase fold
of pepsins [21] and showed that retroviral LTRCAPs also
fit into this template (for a more detailed overview of pepsins, see [22]). The clan AA peptidase fold displays 6
major regions, namely the catalytic site, the sheet platform, the helix (H1), the cantilever, the flap elwood, and
the flap (all emphasized in colors in Figure 1). These
regions are the result of the physiochemical interactions
of minor structural elements which Andreeva described as
follows: a N-terminal loop A1, a loop B1 containing the
catalytic motif, an α-helix C1 not preserved by several
LTRCAPs, a β-hairpin loop D1, a hairpin loop A2, a wide
loop B2 containing the ILG motif B2, an α-helix C2 and a
loop D2 substituted in several LTRCAPs by a strand or a
helical turn. Subsequent issues confirmed and expanded
this model to all enzymes belonging to clan AA (see [23]).
Because of the low similarity, there are no sequences
related to Andreeva's model in previous studies, except
retropepsins and pepsins. However, while performing the
non-redundant alignment, we identified 6 amino acid
patterns with structural correspondence with the
Andreeva's model [21]. Thorough the rest of this paper,
we will refer to the 6 amino acid patterns as the DTG/ILG
template because the 2 canonical DT/SG and ILG amino
acid motifs [4,24] are prominent in this template. Figure
1 shows the correspondence between the DTG/ILG template and the Andreeva's model by using lentiviral CAPs as
a canonical retropepsin-like example (for more details on
this topic see [23,25]). The DTG/ILG template provides

*The descriptor "Chrofung" collects the CAPs encoded by Ty3/Gypsy chromoviruses of fungi and vertebrate organisms.**In this study, each pepsin
subfamily at MEROPS is represented by 2 families, one per each protein domains (1 and 2 or N- and C-terminal). For information about the

not only the needed criterion to align exhaustively the different clan AA families but also a major consensus based
on the Andreeva's model. We tried to characterize this
template as an HMM and a sequence logo using the nonredundant alignment as an input to different tools. However, all tools failed to reconstruct informative material
because of the variability and multiple gaps introduced in
the alignment. At least, we were able to approximate a preliminary sequence logo shown in the center of Figure 1,

which is not significant under conventional logos methodology but is sufficiently informative to visualize the
major consensus sequence (in the words of George P. Box
quoted by Schneider [26] – "all models are wrong, but
some are useful").
The second step considers the information content
enhancement of each family alignment by AMLR. We
included this analysis in the flowchart because many fam-

signals. The flowchart consists of 4 steps: 1) Multiple alignments and consensus identification; 2) Information content enhancement; 3) HMMs and sequence logos; 4) Major consensus.

ilies have conflicting signal and because the degree of
sequence preservation varies depending on the family. In
other words, the object of the AMLR analysis was to
increase prominent sequence patterns specifically preserved by each set of monophyletic CAPs.
In the third step, we chose the AMLR alignments obtained
with the Jrof method to create a collection of sequence
logos and HMMs modeled as HMM profiles and as majority-rule consensus (MRC) sequences.
In the fourth step, we reconstructed the DTG/ILG template. Noting that the previously resolved sequence logo
of this template is only an approximation, we completed
a more precise characterization using a master alignment.
Here, we anchored the different MRCs derived from
HMMs and 4 LTRCAPs representing one-sequence families to perform an additional AMLR analysis in 2 different
ways (with and without Ty3/Gypsy sequences). Subsequently, we used the 2 Jrof alignments reported by the 2
AMLR analyses to characterize the DTG/ILG template as
an HMM and as a sequence logo. Figure 1 also shows the
2 alternative sequence logos constructed using Shannon's
algorithm [27] and a correction factor for < 100
sequences. Both logos exhibit similar information content
shape, which suggests that the template is not biased
toward Ty3/Gypsy or any sequence in particular, but that
its information content shape derives from sequence patterns imprinted by the peptidase fold. The 2D structure
below of the DTG/ILG temple sequence logo describes the
canonical "helix-strand-helix" template (i.e. the
Andreeva's model) usually resolved and/or approximated
based on predicted and/or empirical data. The 2 alternative DTG/ILG template forms thus suggest that Andreeva's
model is reproducible by sequence not only using the
same material employed here, but also with other subsets
of non-redundant sequences.
The database
The most valuable feature here is the set of alignments,
AMLRs, sequence logos and HMMs. This set is in progress
because the actual diversity of clan AA cannot be determined in a single study. With this motivation, we organized the entire collection in CAARD, except the original
alignments, which are freely accessible in various formats
within the GyDB collection [28] deposited at Biotechvana
Bioinformatics [29] (for accessing the alignment URLs,
see the additional file 2 accompanying online this paper).
As shown in Figure 2, CAARD is based on a number
datasheets, one for each family plus another one focusing
on the DTG/ILG template. The datasheets are structured
into 2 main sections – "Ancestral ML reconstruction" and
"Models". The first includes 6 sub-sections, one for each
output generated by the AMLR analysis. This includes
Newick tree (the most commonly accepted format to rep-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

resent phylogenetic trees using parentheses and commas),
statistics data and values related to the AMLR, as well as
the 2 Jrof and Mrof alignments available in various formats. The user can download the Jrof and Mrof AMLR
alignments in 2 ways, processed or unprocessed (as the
output were originally reported by the AMLR analysis, see
"Methods"). The second section contains the sequence
logo and the HMM profile and its derived MRC sequence.
This section also provides a pairwise alignment between
the MRC and the DTG/ILG template to facilitate a comparison between the major consensus and each particular
family consensus. By default, the datasheet focusing on
the DTG/ILG template presents the material derived from
characterization using Ty3/Gypsy sequences. This site
links to another datasheet, which supplies the alternative
characterization performed without Ty3/Gypsy information. Upon the database, we are working to implement
the next version using wiki software to let other authors to
contribute material such as structures, more HMMs, and/
or consensus sequences or position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) iterated for instance, from specialized databases such as MEROPS [1] and REPBASE [30] or from
genome projects.
The database is accessible through a dynamic tree the user
can move, resize and rotate in different ways. By clicking
the name of each cluster in this tree, the user can locate the
datasheet corresponding to the selected family. The tree
has been inferred based on the single non-redundant
alignment of all Jrof AMLR sequences reconstructed in
this study. The sequences can be retrieved in 3 independent ways: 1) within each data sheet as a Jrof alignment, 2)
as a non-redundant alignment by clicking on the blue circle at the center, 3) in separate files clicking the leaves of
the tree. Here, the different AMLR sequences have tags
with information about the parental relationships of the
sequence represented by each leaf. Note the example provided at the top of Figure 2, where the abbreviation
"LENT" indicates "lentiviral family" and the tag "N_8"
denotes the reconstructed node represented by the
selected sequence. To infer the tree we used the parsimony
method of phylogenetic reconstruction [31,32], but other
methods such as neighbor joining (NJ) [33] equally support the families. Values accompanying the clusters are
bootstrap estimations supporting the clusters (families)
that occurred > 55% of the time in the parsimony and NJ
analyses. In general, the tree confirms the different families summarized in Table 1 and shed light on the relationships of Ty3/Gypsy LTRCAPs with other families. The tree
shows how, depending on the family, Ty3/Gypsy
LTRCAPs can be similar to other LTRCAP families or to
SNCAPs. At this point, the current tree has also reasonable
limitations that we are committed to resolve in further
versions. In particular, the tree shows certain ambiguities
due to the conflicting signals between certain families,

and we also think that a more extensive differentiation of
Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao LTRCAPs into families will probably modify the internal branches of this tree in further
versions.
Database topic: Investigating the diversity and
relationships among the different clan AA families through
sequence logos and HMMs
The set of tools deposited in CAARD provides various
methods and resources to evaluate the diversity of, and
the relationships among, the CAPs of LTR retroelements

and their homologous host genes of eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. The most obvious use of this set is for gene
annotation. Along these lines, we are currently testing the
different HMMs and MRCs with the Pea aphid genome,
where they have proved excellent for detecting and annotating new caps ranging from pepsins and ddi host genes
to different LTR retroelement lineages (manuscript and
database update in preparation). In this section, we show
other CAARD applications performing a comparison of
sequence logos and HMMs to investigate certain aspects of
clan AA related to its evolutionary history and diversity.

The qualitative comparison of all sequence logos deposited in CAARD reveals that any clan AA family approximates similar information content shape we divided in 6
amino acid patterns with structural correspondence with
Andreeva's model. This suggests that, with obvious conformational variations, all CAPs investigated follow similar peptidase fold architecture. One of the most interesting
aspects of this fact is the consistency between the DTG/
ILG template's pattern 3 and the flap the structural β-hairpin loop that covers the active site carrying substrate-binding functions (see [23]). In a prior study [18], we
investigated the relationships of Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements based on the differentiation of vertebrate retroviruses into 3 previously reported classes [3438]. What we found is that 3 protein products (one of
them being the CAP) exhibit phenotypic differences we
used to describe an evolutionary network between Ty3/
Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements. Regarding the
CAP, the network involves 3 isoforms of the enzyme
showing 3 flap variations, namely as GIGG, GANG and
TIHG [18]. We chose this nomenclature because of the
tendency of pattern 3 to nucleate particular consensus
motifs with similar physiochemical properties, depending
on the Retroviridae class and Ty3/Gypsy clade or genus. The
GIGG variation defines the well-known glycine-rich flap
of the LTRCAP encoded by HIV-1 and other class II relatives (see [23]). We observed that several Ty3/Gypsy
clades code for LTRCAPs preserving this variation. The
GANG motif is an idealized consensus used to describe a
variation usually characterized by the predominance of an
alanine and an aspartate/asparagine/threonine in the
equivalent flap trait of almost all LTRCAPs encoded by the
Retroviridae class I (epsilon- and gammaretroviruses).
Along these lines, we found that other Ty3/Gypsy clades
codify for LTRCAPs bearing this variant. Additionally, we
found that the TIHG variant defines the flap [39] of the
LTRCAPs coded by class III spumaretroviruses, and that
many but not all Ty3/Gypsy elements belonging to the
genus Errantiviridae encode for LTRCAPs preserving this
variation.
Regarding clan AA, the logos comparison reveals that not
only Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTRCAPs but also all
other clan AA families nucleate intrinsic consensus motifs
in pattern 3. As shown in Figure 3, the different motifs are
similar but not identical each other. We show only 4–6
residues of the most prominent of each pattern 3 motif
delineated by the information content shape of each
sequence logo. As this scheme extends the Ty3/Gypsy/Retroviridae network to all other CAPs, we categorized the
different motifs into 8 idealized variations following the
GANG-GIGG nomenclature introduced in [18]. The flappattern 3 equivalence is supported by empirically characterized data. The 3D structures available of the CAPs
encoded by SFV [39], HIV-1 [40], HTLV-1 [41,42] retrovi-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

ruses and DDI peptidases [6] are indistinctly and clearly
delineated by 3 different TIHG, GIGG, and GANG motifs.
Although the domain-2 of pepsins does not have a true
flap, the pepsin structures empirically characterized also
support the equivalence between pattern 3 and the flap of
the pepsin domain-1 (see the PDB-files accessions available at MEROPS). Finally, the motif's similarity between
the empirically characterized flap and the highly preserved pattern 3 found in almost every, but not all,
sequence logos suggests that the likeliest function for pattern 3 is flap. Upon that, the CAPs belonging to families
exhibiting a highly preserved pattern 3 usually show the
same motif. The best alignment for this motif when aligning (family-to-family and by both automated and manual
means) any of these families with retropepsins is consistent with the flap motif. This suggests no bias in the alignment of these families. However, Figure 3 also evidences
how the preservation of pattern 3 varies depending on the
family and that many families characterized show poorly
preserved pattern 3 motifs. This could be due to the following: 1) several families may be carriers of 2 or more
pattern 3 variants; 2) the flap may be able to evolve from
one state to another within and between families; 3)
many CAPs might have lost the flap as the pepsindomain-2 probably did. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and by this reason we do not dismiss putative bias in the sequence logos of poorly preserved
families toward the most predominant pattern 3 motif (as
a consequence of the enhancement of patterns performed
by the AMLR analysis). This fact probably has a negligible
effect to the overall biological conclusions but suggests
that families showing poorly preserved pattern 3 motifs
may enclose more protein isoforms, which should be
characterized by separate HMMs and logos to clarify all
possible pattern 3 variants.
One interesting aspects of the network is that it suggests
that pattern 3 is an evolutionary marker helpful in tracing
several aspects of both clan AA and LTR retroelement evolution. In this particular, the GANG variant is prominent
in the DTG/ILG template sequence logo. This is because
this variation is more frequent in the network than any
other variation (such as the well-known GIGG motif of
the HIV-1 LTRCAP and relatives). Speculating, this suggests that the GANG variation is probably the ancestral
state from which other variants evolved, in at least dimeric
CAPs. Upon that, the qualitative similarity between various GANG motifs derived from the LTR- and SNCAP families is consistent with the CAARD phylogeny and suggests
a putative relationship between LTR- and SNCAPs. Evaluation of the sequence logos dismisses Ty1/Copia and Bel/
Pao LTRCAPs from this relationship because these 2 families exhibit phenotypic features distinguishing them from
other CAPs. Among other features, Ty1/Copia LTRCAPs
usually preserve an ILS motif substituting the ILG motif

Pattern 3 variations
Pattern 3 variations. The DTG/ILG template's pattern 3 defines the sequence position equivalent to the β-hairpin loop
called flap. A comparison among all constructed sequence logos reveals how, depending on the family, this position nucleates
particular consensus motifs related but not identical to those of other families. We categorized this network into 8 variants
according to the physical-chemical properties of residues and only show the entire sequence logo of the DTG/ILG template
(the remaining logos are available within the database under "Results"). In this network, an alanine-asparagine variable motif
predominates among LTR- and SNCAPs, instead of the canonical glycine-rich motif of HIV-1 peptidase and closer relatives.

displayed at the C-terminus of almost all other CAPs
(material available in CAARD). In similar terms, Bel/Pao
LTRCAPs present an extremely large and variable core that
is rich in serine-threonine residues (material available in
CAARD). In contrast, caulimoviruses, Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements code for a variety of CAPs,
which are similar to SNCAPs based on sequence and protein domain architecture. To investigate which of these 3
LTRCAP families is more similar to SNCAPs, we performed additional analyses comparing all HMMs to each
other. We do not discuss all cases, only the most significant instances in performing the analysis – Ty3/Gypsy
LTRCAPs and SNCAPs. As shown in Table 2, the comparison reveals similarity between the families COG3577 and
Osvaldo, and between many Ty3/Gypsy families and SASPases and DDI eSNCAPs. The similarity between
COG3577 and Osvaldo is significant but not sufficient to
conclude recent horizontal transference in any direction,
and the wide distribution of DDI eSNCAPs in plants,
fungi and animals, suggests that, regardless of the relationship between this enzyme and Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements, this relationship is ancient. HMM analyses thus
suggest a common ancestor for dimeric CAPs that, as a
sequence, might have been an intermediate between
SNCAPs and Ty3/Gypsy LTRCAPs. Here, an interesting
question to address in further analyses is if the DTG/ILG
template can be considered as a general consensus
approximating the ancestral dimeric form.
Taking into primary consideration that the different families preserve different pattern 3 motifs we have noted that
the network can be interpreted evolutionarily and taxonomically. For instance, the Retroviridae is a group of retroviruses which can be divided in 3 taxonomical classes I,
II, and II and we have also noted that there is a particular
flap variant usually preserved depending on the class [18].
Since this point, another interesting aspect of the pattern
3 variability meriting further attention is to discern should
each pattern 3 variant might be enclosing structural differences related to function. We explored this possibility
combining empirical data with prediction models. That is,
the flap is a β-hairpin loop consisting in 2 antiparallel βstrands coupled by a β-turn. The β-turn (also known as
reverse turn) is a supersecondary structure originally
described by Venkatachalam [43] that consists of 4 residues designed as "i", "i+1", "i+2", "i+3". In Figure 4 we
illustrate 3 empirical examples of GIGG and TIHG β-turns
based on the 4 amino acids that define the true flaps of the
LTRCAPs encoded by HIV-1 [40], HTLV-1 [41,42], and
SFV [39] retroviruses. Here, 3 types of β-turns appear to be
distinguished according to prior classifications [44-46]
based on the "Phi" and "Psi" torsional angles of residues
at positions "i+1" and "i+2" (using the Ramachandran
plot, data not shown). The TIHG turn apparently adopts
the type II' conformation, while GIGG turns adopt the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

type II with the exception of the GAGG turn of deltaretroviral LTRCAPs, which adopts the type I. We think that this
might be due to the alanine at "i+1" which has smaller
side chain than that of the isoleucine "i+1" in GIGG turn.
Figure 4 also shows 3 additional predictions based on the
pattern 3 variations of osvaldo and gammaretroviral
LTRCAPs (GANG-like), and betaretroviral and 412/Mdg1
LTRCAPs (GIGG-like) we modeled using the HIV-1 and
HLTV-1 turns as templates. These 3 predictions are apparently consistent with the notion suggesting that GANGlike β-turns might adopt the type I conformation while
GIGG-like turns implement the type II. Additionally, we
performed β-turn type predictions using the different pattern 3 motifs summarized in Figure 3 as queries to the
COUDES server [47]. For simplicity's sake we do not show
the results obtained in this analysis but they were also
consistent with the possibility addressed. Prediction models should be carefully interpreted because even empirically resolved structures may reflect constraints imposed
by crystal formation rather than significant differences
between the breathing native structures in solution. We
can only speculate but the structural characterization of
the different models merits further attention because predictions are sufficient consistent to discreetly arguing the
possibility of structural differences based on pattern 3
motifs.

Conclusion
The pre-existing classification combined with the evolutionary history of LTR retroelements permits a consistent
taxonomical collection of sequence logos and HMMs.
This set is useful for gene annotation but also a reference
to evaluate the diversity of, and the relationships among,
the different families. Comparisons among HMMs suggest a common ancestor for all dimeric CAPs that is halfway between SNCAPs and those coded by Ty3/Gypsy LTR
retroelements. Sequence logos reveal how all clan AA families follow similar protein domain architecture related to
the peptidase fold. In particular, each family nucleates a
particular consensus motif in the sequence position
related to the flap. The different motifs constitute a network where an alanine-asparagine-like variable motif predominates, instead of the canonical motif of the HIV-1
LTRCAP and closer relatives.

Methods
Sequences and database
We created a sequence database with 323 non-redundant
CAPs collected from NCBI [48] and MEROPS [1]. Here,
we would like to stress that concerning LTR retroelements,
we used only sequences encoded by canonical sequences,
almost all being functional. A more detailed summary of
the sequences used is available in the Additional file 1,
which provides an extended version of the guide tree illus-

Types of β-turns. Based on 3 empirically characterized GIGG, GAGG, and TIHG flap-like β-hairpin loops, and 3 prediction
GIGG and GANG models, the β-turns differ from each other based on the orientation the "Phi" and "Psi" torsional angles of
the peptide bond between residues in "i+1" and "i+2" (indicated with curved arrows). Additional differences based on the
properties of the residues in the position "i+1" are also observed (in circles). Chains were colored according to the physiochemical properties of amino acids. Hydrophobic residues are colored grey, acidic residues and relatives are yellow, and basic
residues are in blue.
trated in Figure 1. This tree summarizes names, taxonomy,
hosts and Genbank accessions of all CAPs used.
Alignments
We divided the 323 CAPs investigated in this study into
38 protein families according to prior estimations of taxonomy and evolutionary relationships. Then, we created
34 multiple alignments, one for each family having more
than 2 sequences plus a single non-redundant alignment
collecting all CAPs. Families were aligned using CLUSTAL
X [49] and manually refined using the GENEDOC editor
[50] in shaded mode. The refinement was conducted
using the following groups of amino acid similarity: [T,S
– small nucleophile amino acids], [K,R,H – basic amino
acids], [D,E,N,Q – acidic amino acids and relative
amides], and [L,I,V,M,A,G,P,F,Y,W – hydrophobic amino
acids]. The non-redundant alignment was performed
manually with GENEDOC and using the aforementioned
groups of amino acid similarity. Here, we used prior structure-based alignments [4,20] as well as the information
content shape delineated by the Andreeva's model [21,23]
to establish a sequence core from which we excluded

Andreeva's element A1 (because of the dissimilarity in this
trait). We used this core to align and refine the different
families manually, family-to-family. The refinement was
led by inferring and using the clan AA phylogeny as a
guide tree (the tree was inferred as many times we refined
the alignment). This process revealed 6 amino acid patterns we call the DTG/ILG template because these 2 motifs
predominate. This template is common to all CAPs investigated and was used as an anchoring criterion of alignment and refinement thorough the rest of this study.
Ancestral maximum likelihood reconstructions
The different sets of AMLR sequences generated in this
study were reconstructed using each family alignment as
an input to FastML 2.02 [51]. This tool performs the analysis using 2 methods, Joint and Marginal [51-54] and
reports 6 outputs – Pin, Fin, Jrof, Jpf, Mrof, and Mpf. The
Pin output is an NJ tree [33] summarizing the relationships between CAPs (the input taxa) and AMLR sequences
(the nodes). Fin is a file giving information about the
parental relationship between AMLR sequences and CAPs.
Jrof is the AMLR alignment obtained using the Joint

Biology Direct 2009, 4:3

method. Jpf is a file providing information about the joint
probability per position and the total log likelihood in the
Jrof alignment. Mrof is the AMLR alignment obtained
using the marginal method. Mpf is a file giving the marginal probability per position and the total log likelihood
in the Mrof alignment. All AMLR files are available online
in CAARD introduced under "Results". There is a minor
limitation when performing the AMLR analysis with
FastML; should a particular CAP display an amino acid
trait not found in the remaining CAPs, the tool includes
such a trait in all AMLR sequences. To avoid this limitation, we processed the alignments containing these biases
to remove the non-informative positions. The criterion
was to eliminate alignment positions with 70–100% gaps
and/or high amino acid entropy.
HMMs
HMM profiles [55] were modeled and calibrated using
HMMER [56] and the processed Jrof AMLR alignments as
inputs. MRC sequences were derived from the HMMs
using HMMER. All HMM profiles and MRCs are available
online within CAARD introduced under "Results". The
profiles can be consulted directly via the HMM search at
GyDB, with the exception of the 4 HMM profiles describing the 4 pepsin domain, which are only available in the
CAARD. In the HMM server, pepsins are represented by 2
HMM profiles, which describe the natural 2-domain
forms of pepsins (sub-families A1A and A1B according to
MEROPS [1]).
Sequence logos
The sequence logo methodology consist in the creation of
graphical representations of the consensus of DNA and
protein multiple alignments. The methodology is useful
to decipher the order of predominance and the relative
frequencies of residues at every position. This provides a
significant view of the patterns characteristic of a gene or
a protein. In each position, each residue is a letter whose
height is proportional to its frequency per position multiplied by the information content of each position measured in bits [57]. Letters are placed such that the most
frequent is positioned at the top. In this study, sequence
logo analyses involved CheckAlign 1.0 [58] in Shannon's
algorithm mode [27] and correction factor. We used each
processed Jrof AMLR alignment as an input to this tool. In
each sequence logo, basic residues are represented in red,
hydrophobic residues in black, amino acids that are common in β-turns (G and P) in dark grey, small nucleophiles
in violet, acidic residues in orange and acidic-relative
amides in green. CheckAlign directly builds the logo from
an ungapped alignment using the conventional methodology [57,59]. Here, the maximum uncertainty by position in a protein alignment is log2 20 = 4.3. In the case of
gapped alignments, CheckAlign builds the logo, taking
the gap character as another amino acid species. Here, the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

tool considers the maximum uncertainty by position to be
log2 21 = 4.4 for protein alignments. The different
sequence logos constructed are available online within
the CAARD introduced under "Results". CheckAlign also
includes a naive relative-frequency algorithm we used to
identify a preliminary form of the DTG/ILG template (for
more details about CheckAlign see [58]).
Comparative analyses
BLAST similarities were correlated using different queries
(CAPs and MRCs) to the CORES database via the NCBI
BLAST search [60] at GyDB using the BLASTp search
mode. HMMs were tested using different HMM profiles as
queries to the CORES database via the HMM search at
GyDB using hmmsearch. We used the hmmpfam search
tool in this server to compare the different MRCs with the
HMM profiles, using the MRCs as queries to the HMM
profile database available by default.
Programming
The CAARD is a database presented through a web-based
template programmed in PHP language [61]. The template retrieves information from the database through a
management system based on URL parameters, and
reproduces the radial topology of a phylogenetic tree
inferred based on the alignment of all the processed Jrof
AMLR sequences reconstructed. To perform this alignment we followed the same strategy used to obtain the
non-redundant alignment using CAPs. The template acts
as a presentation layer of the different datasheets stored,
and cluster names depicted in the tree are links that
invoke the stored information.
Structural modeling
We illustrated the 3D structure of the HIV-1 LTRCAP using
SWISS-PDB Viewer 3.7 [62] and the PDB file 1a30 [40].
The PDB file 1a30 was also used along with the PDB files
2b7f [41,42] and 2ijs [39] to illustrate with SWISS-PDB
Viewer 3.7 the different types of β-turn types displayed in
the flap of HIV-1, HTLV-1 and SFV LTRCAPs, respectively.
All PDB files were downloaded from the RCSB Protein
Data Bank [63]. We also used SWISS-PDB Viewer 3.7 for
modeling the β-turn involving the GIGQ flap motif of
betaretroviral and 412/Mdg1 LTRCAPs using the HIV-1 βturn as a template. The GATG and GANG flap motifs typically found in gammaretroviral and Osvaldo LTRCAPs
were modeled using the HTLV-1 β-turn as a template. The
2D structure prediction of the DTG/ILG template shown
in Figure 1 was made using the PSIPRED server [64].
Phylogenetic trees
The 2 phylogenetic reconstructions performed in this
study – guide and database trees – employed PHYLIP 3.6
[65]. First, we generated 100 bootstrap replicates of each
alignment using SEQBOOT. Second, we used the protein

sequence parsimony method of Felsenstein, based on the
approaches of Eck and Dayhoff [31] and Fitch [32], to perform the analysis. The bootstrap file was used as an input
to PROTPARS and the input was randomized using the
following parameters: random number seed = 5 and
number of times to jumble = 5. Then, CONSENSE was
used to obtain a MRC tree [66] using the tree file generated by PROTPARS as an input. As the MRC tree usually
consists of all clusters that occur > 50% of the time, we
took consensus values > 55 as a bootstrap reference. We
used the bootstrap values to scale the trees. We also tested
the NJ method [33] using different models of distances
implemented in PROTDIST. Here, it is important to keep
in mind that the overall efficiency of the different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction in building the true
tree vary with substitution rate, transition-transversion
ratio, and sequence divergence [67,68]. With the particular material we studied, phylogenies based on the parsimony principle proved themselves to be more consistent
with the MEROPS classification and known LTR retroelement phylogenies than NJ trees. Parsimony trees also
reported better bootstrapping and were more consistent
with the comparative analyses than NJ trees. Nevertheless,
NJ and parsimony trees were consistent to each other
when the analysis was inferred using AMLR sequences
instead of CAPs.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Reviewer 1: Daniel H. Haft, J. Craig Venter Institute.
Reviewer's comment
This paper can be viewed as an archival reference to
describe a web resource on clan AA aspartyl proteases.
That family is of special interest because both HIV and
eukaryotic LTR retroelements encode members of the
family. The HIV protease is an important therapeutic target. The paper itself describes a work flow, but the pipeline
does not correspond to a distributable tool because it
includes essential manual steps. Instead, the resulting collection of sequence logos, HMMs, and web resources is
the featured contribution of this work. There seem to be
two main points of emphasis in this paper. The first point
is that a pre-existing (but not yet complete) classification
scheme for clan AA aspartyl proteases can be made into a
self-consistent classification scheme by multiple sequence
alignments, sequence logos, and HMMs. The classification includes both those subfamilies already explicitly
defined in MEROPS and other implicit members recognized as belonging to the clan but awaiting explicit
MEROPS treatment (e.g. COG3577 members). The second main point is that using Pattern 3 by itself, the "flap",
leads to an informative classification scheme that distinguishes proteins according to motif-based matches in this
glycine-rich beta-turn. The possibilities were not really
discussed that convergent evolution, human bias during
manual sequence alignment, or other alignment or interpretation troubles led the authors to produce a catalog of
pattern 3 variants with relatively little value for guiding
the interpretation of clan AA protease evolution. The pattern 3 motif catalog may turn out to have value for extrapolating protein function from characterized to
uncharacterized members of the family. However, the
reward to the reader from the pages-long description of
how these "flap polymorphisms" support models for the
evolution of clan AA may not justify the burden.
Authors' response
Yes, the flowchart combines software analysis and manual
means to construct a set of tools including alignments,
ancestral ML reconstruction analyses, sequence logos and
HMMs. The classification is an improvement over the preexisting classification but it is work in progress because of
the large diversity of the eukaryotic LTR retroelements and
their coded peptidases. For this reason, we created the
database in order to establish a reference set that we plan
to update in light of new data. Regarding the second point

we have amended the manuscript discussing the possibilities addressed by the referee but have also toned down
the most speculative aspects.
Reviewer's comment
The first draft of the paper is too long, with too much difficult syntax, paragraphs that are so long that the main
points are hard to find, with too much speculative language. Review reports for the typical anonymous reviewer
would likely require a substantial streamlining of the
manuscript with improved clarity, necessitating a second
round of review. I believe I must make an equivalent recommendation here. I find portions of the analysis to be
novel enough and useful enough for eventual publication,
and I find the web presentation of the same work quite
nice.
Authors' response
Done, we have reduced the manuscript and figures. We
have also revised the style and syntax, etc.
Reviewer's comment
I would like to note that unique identifiers (D.O.I. numbers) can be attached to electronic publications. Some
content from original manuscript could be pointed to by
your revised manuscript as a distinct document, and presented through the web site as free text or as database content, rather than being run through the peer review
process as part of the work that reviewers are asked to
endorse directly.
Authors' response
Done, we have separated the flowchart's description from
the manuscript. This text and accompanying figures is
now available as a section of the database.
Reviewer's comment
Note on justifying why the study of protein family evolution should be done: My perception is that, in a wellunderstood protein family with many 3-D structures, the
insights to be gained by an evolutionary reconstruction
are not nearly as great as when structural and mechanistic
information is limited. By contrast, constructing a classification scheme that imposes a sensible nomenclature, and
attaching the nomenclature to clear and useful functional
description, does have value. A core of the paper here can
fit that goal.
Authors' response
Done, we have rewritten the current manuscript version,
which focuses on database/collection justifying the study
in the basis of different arguments addressed in the manuscript introduction.

Reviewer's follow-up comment based on second version

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

Reviewer's comments
Following the authors' revision of the manuscript and
response to comments, I have amended my comments
somewhat. Some technical comments were fully
addressed, are now irrelevant, and have been removed.
However, I left some comments in place, even if largely
addressed, as they represent a discussion of the work. This
paper describes a body of work in which manual alignment editing, guided by extensive previous work in the
field (crystallographic and interpretive), leads to consistent identification of six key motifs that unify a broad family of peptidases and clarify which of its features are
general. Attempts to leverage from these human-curated
subfamily alignments to develop additional useful database objects such as motif definitions, sequence logos,
and phylogenetic trees, all presented through a smoothly
functioning web site, have met with some success, and the
work is expected to continue past the date of publication
for this work. Portions of the discussion in the article may
be regarded as somewhat speculative.
Authors' response
We thank this expert in the field of protein families for his
constructive criticisms and positive assessment of the
issue and database site.
Reviewer's comments
The discussion of flap motifs seems somewhat cleaner and
clearer, but it still mixes in considerable speculation and
is still quite long. The sequence logo, a one-dimensional
representation of consensus sequence, may be overworked here as a tool for providing insight into protein 3D structural variation near the protease active site.
Authors' response
By comparing all sequence logos deposited in CAARD,
one can easily visualize how all sequence logos exhibit
similar information content shape. The information content shape of each sequence logo is defined by the number
of computed bits for which Shannon's algorithm provides
a information measure for each amino acid or symbol
(since information is statistically random and each new
symbol would increase the measurement). This means
that a sequence logo provides information on not only the
consensus sequence of a DNA and/or protein family but
also other information related to natural patterns (see
Schneider [26]). In this case, the different patterns and
information content shape of the clan AA protein domain
architecture (in general) appear to be delineated by the
peptidase fold. In this study, we started using a structurebased model based on retropepsins (previously resolved
and widely supported by a number of studies). What we
have found is that the remaining clan AA families are consistent with this particular information content shape and
that the structural model (i.e. the Andreeva's template)

Page 14 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:3

can be resolved as a sequence template which we divide
into 6 amino acid patterns (the DTG/ILG template). Here,
the equivalence between pattern 3 and flap is clearly supported by the 3D structure of all empirically characterized
aspartic peptidases (or aspartyl proteases). Due to the
high degree of conservation of pattern 3 in almost every,
but not all, remaining CAP families evaluated, one can
certainly assume that pattern 3 is functional and that the
likeliest and most reasonable function for pattern 3 is flap
(by position and by motif similarity to the true empirically characterized flaps). We do not argue that all members within many families are carriers of flaps since the
degree of conservation of pattern 3 varies in many cases
and because there is evidence of flap lost (in the case of
the pepsin lobe 2). We have presented a collection of pattern 3 variants, which are preserved depending on the protein family and prior data indicates that they can be
related with the flap. This finding should be addressed as
a result and we think that the speculation is justified as
part of discussion. However, we have re-written the final
version taking particular care to refer to only as flap those
pattern 3 motifs having empirically demonstrated equivalence. In turn, we refer to the collective of positional traits
which are equivalent by position, degree of preservation,
and motif similarity to the flap as pattern 3.
Reviewer's comments
While certain structural elements may be important for
nucleating folding, I would expect proteins to have some
elements for structure and some for specifity. Since the
flap element can flip right off the structure, and is known
to be involved in binding substrate, it must be other beta
turns that nucleate folding. The whole text from "This
arrangement is a preliminary display" to "had selective
advantages from this feature" probably should be
removed.
Authors' response
Amended, we have removed the most speculative comments (those related to nucleating folding) from the text
addressed above, and we tone down the comments that
we think are justified, well supported, or needed as a discussion.
Reviewer's comments
I rebel against the idea that, in a family of proteins so
divergent no automated alignment is possible, "the
GAGG motif is a transitional state between the GIGG and
GANG variations." So many factors affect the definition of
these motifs – manual alignments, founder effects from
nucleating each motif, co-evolution with the rest of each
protein – that even the level of speculation that remains
seems excessive. The current figure 4 discusses 3D structure of the flap based in part on 3 actual structures and 3
predicted structures, without making it clear enough

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

which is which. The value of this analysis is highly questionable.
Authors' response
We agree with the referee regarding the fact that the automated alignment of extremely divergent protein families
is possible. However, we did not find any algorithm or
tool capable of exhaustively aligning more than 2 or 3
non-redundant clan AA families (and in all cases the automated alignment needed manual refinement). Note that
the difficulty of clan AA is not to obtain an exhaustive
alignment but to exhaustively align all its possible
sequence forms. So we think that the manually performed
model in this study can be useful as a case study to investigate new automations for exhaustively aligning fast
evolving proteins. Upon this, our model considers 6
amino acid patterns which appear to be preserved in terms
of physiochemical properties of amino acids in every evaluated clan AA family. The 6 patterns provide a sequence
core to which other sequences have shown significant
similarity hits in the following performed comparisons:
1) between sequences within families, and 2) between
family consensus sequences and/or HMMs. This includes
the general DTG/ILG template HMMs in its 2 current
forms (with or without Ty3/Gypsy sequences). The information about similarity is available online in CAARD as
the Supplementary Table P1 accompanying the flowchart
section available in the URL [19]. The different similarities
displayed in this Table correspond to the different pairwise alignments available in the "Section Models" of
CAARD between the DTG/ILG template model and each
family consensus. By evaluating these alignments, one can
see how all consensus sequences constructed based on all
dimeric CAP families align pattern3-to-pattern3 with the
DTG/ILG template. This is because pattern 3 is a positional trait, essential in order to anchor the core of similarity between 2 CAP sequences. On the other hand, we
have noted that clan AA can be automatically aligned into
subsets of 2, 3 or even 4 families. For instance, it is known
that the Retroviridae is a group of vertebrate retroviruses
whose encoded LTRCAPs can be automatically aligned
using software tools. In all cases, the different GANG,
GIGG, and TIHG motifs of the Retroviridae LTRCAPs usually align pattern3-to-pattern-3 without needing manual
refinement. This is because the trait we have called pattern
3 is strongly preserved in the different LTRCAPs encoded
by the different Retroviridae genera. One can find similar
result when aligning many other CAP families or when
aligning other families with Retroviridae LTRCAPs. This
means that there is no human bias in the definition of patterns 3 in the families exhibiting high degree of preservation. Another question is, can this pattern be labeled as
flap? At this point, regarding dimeric CAPs, the empirical
prior information is consistent with this possibility but,
following the words of caution addressed by this referee,

Page 15 of 21

Biology Direct 2009, 4:3

we have toned down to avoid excessive speculation. The
highly preserved patterns 3 present a wide range of motif
variability that can be used to identify other patterns in
the less preserved families. In these cases of less preserved
families, we recognize that the information content
enhancement of sequence patterns may be biasing the
pattern 3 motif towards the most frequent motif in these
families and many other sequences within these families
may be carriers of other motifs or have lost the flap. We
have discussed more widely this possibility in the manuscript. Finally, we agree with this referee that there are
many aspects that probably affect the network of flap polymorphisms such as co-evolution with not only the rest of
each protein but also other proteins (in the case of eukaryotic LTR retroelements). Nevertheless, whatever the cause
of the different pattern motifs found in the network, we
think that it is clear that there is an evolutionary constraint
involving the variability of pattern 3 since each CAP family usually preserves a particular motif (the feature can be
used for taxonomy purposes). From that point on, we
have tried to additionally explore the structural meaning
of the variability of pattern 3 by comparing true flap βturns and using them to make a predictive analysis. Predictions are analyses usually used for publication purposes and we present Figure 4 in these terms. However, we
have re-written the paper clarifying the limitations of this
Figure.
Reviewer's report 2
Reviewer 2: Vladimir Kapitonov, Genetic Information
Research Institute, Mountain View
Reviewer's comment
The authors have developed a database of the AA clan of
aspartic proteases. Although the AA clan was included previously into the MEROPS database, a general database of
proteases, its enormous diversity clearly justifies development of a more detailed database similar to the one
described in this paper. The authors have mentioned that
Bel aspartic proteases are not described in MEROPS as a
separate group of aspartic proteases. Actually, a few years
ago, there was so called A17 family of Bel/Pao peptidases
in MEROPS. Moreover, the MEROPS A17 peptidase family was also introduced into Pfam (PF05380), which is
actively used at NCBI for annotation of protein domains.
However the A17 family was described wrongly as the
protease. In fact, this was a ribonuclease (RNase H). Later,
the A17 family was excluded from families of proteases in
MEROPS. Yet it is still reported as a protease in Pfam and
GenBank protein domain annotations. So I am sure that
the establishment of a separate properly curated database
of the AA proteases will help to avoid such problems.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

Authors' response
We thank this expert in the field of mobile genetic elements, for his positive feedback and comments for
improving the original and future approach. Certainly,
sequencing projects have revealed how the diversity of
clan AA greatly exceeds the current classification. We agree
that the large diversity of eukaryotic LTR retroelements
and the need to clarify their relationships with their host
counterparts justifies the creation and continuous update
of a curated database.
Reviewer's comment
My main concern is a disproportionally high number of
Gypsy families introduced in the database. Among 38
families of the AA proteases, 17 families belong to Gypsy
LTR retrotransposons! I understand that the authors have
started this project working on Gypsy. However, other
groups of LTR retrotransposons, including Copia and BEL,
are as diverse as Gypsy: and yet each of them is represented here by a single family. As a result, general evolutionary reconstructions and scenarios made based on such
biased data would be unreliable. The authors wrote (page
13, last paragraph) that the variability of BEL and Copia
proteases is lower than that of their Gypsy and Retroviridae counterparts. Is that so? Just a brief look at Copia proteases via PSI-BLAST shows that these proteases are as
diverse as Gypsy! After a few rounds of PSI-BLAST iterations, one can easily collect numerous Copia proteases
less than 17% identical to each other.
Authors' response
Certainly, our study improves the pre-existing classification but the diversity of clan AA is extremely large to be
completely addressed in a single study. In particular, the
peptidases encoded by LTR retroelements are extremely
difficult to deal with because of their diversity, conflicting
signal, and possibility of being part of pseudogenized
transposable copies. For this reason the database is in continuous progress. In this first version, we paid special
attention to Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae peptidases
because we previously exhaustively analyzed these 2
groups of LTR retroelements based on not only on the
peptidase domain but also other protein domains such as
gag, RT, RNAse H, INT, etc. What we found is that the phylogenetic signal of the peptidase domain of Ty3/Gypsy
and Retroviridae elements is low but consistent with their
differentiation into clades and genera. Along these lines,
sequencing projects continuously reveal new lineages
belonging to the different LTR retroelement groups.
Therefore we think that the Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae
families summarized are not disproportional; they are
based on the clades and genera of LTR retroelements we
currently classify. As the matter of fact, there are Ty3/
Gypsy lineages such as those Gmr1 and Tor-like that are
not included here and whose peptidases deserve analysis

Page 16 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:3

and classification. However, the referee is right when noting that other LTR retroelement groups such as Ty1/Copia
and Bel/Pao are as diverse as Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelements.
Here, we are committed to perform identical investigation
based on these (and other) retroelement groups. However, because of the large material to investigate, this is a
separate study on which we are currently working because
while there are previous studies focusing on the Bel/Pao
and Ty1/Copia groups there is not yet a comprehensive
phylogenetic differentiation of these groups into clades
and genera. It is true that there is an existing agreement of
classification to divide Ty1/Copia elements into several
Pseudoviridae genera, but these genera are based on priming mechanisms instead of the phylogeny. Despite this,
the current differentiation into families achieved in this
study is not particular bias against Ty1/Copia, and Bel/Pao
peptidases (in terms of phylogenetic signals). Unlike Ty3/
Gypsy peptidases, the different Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao
peptidase sequences usually fall in independent single
clusters in phylogenetic analyses because they have particular features not found in other peptidases (we have
included some discussion in the manuscript). For this reason we have followed the MEROPS approach to classify
these 2 into 2 families. Despite this, we are in complete
agreement with this referee with regard to the fact that
Ty1/Copia and Bel/Pao sequences must be taxonomically
classified into a more complex classification into families,
a topic we will focus on in further updates and that will
probably reveal very exciting insights.
Reviewer's comment
Given the enormous sequence data available, the authors
don't have to limit themselves by only experimentally
studied retrotransposons. They can use protease
sequences encoded by consensus sequences of hundreds
of young families of LTR retrotransposons collected in
other databases (e.g. Repbase). It would be beneficiary to
the community if each family of the AA proteases in this
database will be accompanied by a separate PSSM available to users. Very often, PSI-BLAST is as good as HMM.
Therefore, the available PSSM would be helpful in PSIBLAST-based detections of AA proteases.
Authors' response
In principle and in order to create phylogeny-based
HMMs, the Gypsy Database (GyDB) project follows the
phylogenetic analysis and database annotation of nonredundant canonical sequences with the full genome
completely available. That is the scope of the GyDB, not
to exhaustively align all sequences but look for reference
models in a context of non-redundancy. About this, we
find the 2 ideas proposed by this referee very interesting
and we are certainly open to collaborate with the REPBASE team and/or use material retrieved from this senior
database to implement not only the peptidase database

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

but also other sections of the GyDB project. Moreover, we
are currently working to implement the GyDB with wiki
software to let other authors and research groups to contribute material of any kind, server and tools. Upon this
scenario, the possibility to implement the clan AA database with PSSMs is viable and compatible with our classification criterion if using the MRCs currently available to
iterate searches that can improve the capability of the phylogenetic HMMs or generate highly informative PSSMs.
We think that this is important because of the conflicting
signals found between several families. Our reasons about
this criterion are directly related with the following
Reviewer's comment and our answer.
Reviewer's comment
I am quite skeptical about using currently available tools
and methods (including Joint and Marginal, mentioned
by the authors) for reconstruction of ancestral AA proteases. Most of these proteases were/are encoded by transposable elements. Different families of transposable
elements, regardless of their proteases, can differ dramatically from each other in terms of their transposition rates.
Families that were more successful in massive transposition are represented by higher numbers of copies in
genomes than their slow-transposing relatives. Usually,
one collects randomly a number of different families.
Therefore, any standard reconstruction of an ancient protease ancestral to proteases encoded by these elements
would be biased towards families that had high transposition rate. The more ancient ancestry would one try to
reconstruct the more significant transposition related bias
will be.
Authors' response
Following the indications of referee 1, we have derived the
manuscript to its most immediate scope – the collection
of sequences and its uses. Along these lines, our main
intention when using ancestral ML reconstruction in this
study was to enhance the information content of each
family instead of reconstructing the ancestor (we emphasized in the manuscript that the probability of reconstructing the true ancestor is near zero). Certainly, not all
clan AA families need this kind of process but when dealing with this enzyme group, one finds different degrees of
preservation. In many cases, the information content of
many families is certainly low probably because of the
points addressed by this referee, and software fail to construct informative logos and HMMs. However, we have
tested the collection in many ways, one of them being the
screening of a genome project with HMMs where they
proved excellent for annotating new sequences. All queries detected peptidase sequences that were later confirmed to belong to the LTR retroelement lineage related
with the HMM used. So the collection works, this means
that the difficulties posted by the referee are precisely the

Page 17 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:3

same reasons that motivated us as to make such an
exhaustive analysis of the different monophyletic families
of peptidases (taking into account their evolutionary relationships and prior taxonomy). This difficulty was also
the reason why we used ancestral ML reconstruction to
emphasize the most prominent domain architecture of
each monophyletic dataset. The analysis is not affected by
the different rates of evolution because what we characterized is the clan AA protein domain based on all possible
phylogenetic signal and not the functional families. The
main basis of this argument is that the HMM describing
the peptidases encoded by a particular LTR retroelements
lineage will be able to show the best similarity to their lineage counterparts, and so on. Note as an example the
peptidases encoded by the 412/Mdg1 and Micropia/Mdg3
LTR retrotransposons, which are more similar to those of
vertebrate retroviruses (retropepsins) than to those of
other Ty3/Gypsy elements. At the same time these peptidases are not similar enough to those of vertebrate retroviruses to conclude recent recombination and/or
horizontal transference, and despite this, they show similarity to other Ty3/Gypsy peptidases. Obviously, the diversity of several peptidases may escape detection of the
current HMMs but the classification is in progress and
new sequences will calibrate the set of tools. On the other
hand, the set of tools and combination of methods gives
various angles for investigating different aspects of clan
AA.
Reviewer's comment
One minor comment is on terminology. The authors use
regularly terms "cohort", "families", "pools" making the
manuscript unreasonably convoluted. "Cohorts" can be
easily replaced by "families"!
Authors' response
Done, we have replaced the term "cohort" by "family".
Reviewer's report 3
Reviewer 3: Ben M. Dunn, University of Florida College
of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology
Reviewer's comment
As for my comments, I offer the following from the perspective of an enzymologist who has worked on both the
retroviral members as well as the eukaryotic members of
the AA family. The author's effort to derive relationships
between the various members of the AA family of peptidases is important and overdue. Natalia Andreeva constructed a "structural template" for the pepsin-like
enzymes back in 1990 and presented this at a conference
in Sonoma, California (published as reference #6 of the
manuscript). She related the sequence of HIV-1 protease
to the pepsin family and showed that retroviral sequences

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

could also fit into the structural template. Ten years later,
Wlodawer and Gustchina (who was Andreeva's graduate
student) presented a thorough analysis of retroviral protease properties, including demonstration that additional
structural data confirmed and expanded Andreeva's
model of the "fold" of all enzymes in the AA family. However, the absolute identity of amino acids between the 2
groups of peptidases is very low, making it very difficult to
make conclusions about similarities. Thus, the work of
Llorens and colleagues is important in pushing the analysis as far as possible.
Authors' response
We thank this expert enzymologist for his positive review.
Indeed, clan AA is one of the most widely studied
enzymes in the scientific literature but it is at the same
time one of which little is known because of its large
diversity. While enzymes such as pepsins and retropepsins
have been extensively investigated, others remain yet
uncharacterized. The comment of this referee is indispensable to evaluate the object of the bioinformatic flowchart. We constructed an ongoing database to investigate
and classify the different clan AA families using a major
consensus derived from Andreeva's model to understand
the different patterns (imprinted over sequence by the
peptidase fold). With this aim, we continued in the same
direction as prior approaches. Here, we investigate what is
common between not only extensively studied aspartic
peptidases such as pepsins and retropepsins but also others of which little is known.
Reviewer's comment
From a bioinformatics perspective I think that this is a
good and carefully designed work that tries to impress by
an amount of analyses whose significance and effectiveness is very hard to evaluate. Figures and the interactive
website look very nice, professional, and probably useful
to researchers in the field. The authors do a very meticulous job in aligning the sequences, finding conservation
patterns, searching databases and creating evolutionary
trees with different methods and outputs. In my opinion
the bioinformatics of what they do is not particularly
innovative or creative and I think they do a lot of over-killing but at least they are very exhaustive in their analysis.
One aspect of the paper that disturbs me a little is that
they seem to make a huge effort to demonstrate exceptional depth and insightfulness in their analyses. I am not
sure what they are actually gaining by going through those
complex exercises of finding hmm profiles, anchoring
alignments, etc etc. I was never sure of what was accomplished at each step of the analysis and I had often the
impression that a lot of dust was being raised. This
impression may also be a reflection of the fact that the
authors use a pompous and often obscure language. I

Page 18 of 21

would ask to lighten up the language a lot before publication
Authors' response
Certainly this issue is difficult because it involves 3 different areas of research – enzymology, LTR retroelement evolution, and protein families. We have carefully rewritten
the manuscript to make the language accessible to any
reader. We hope that this expert will now find the
improved manuscript straightforward. Briefly, the key to
understand why so many analyses, has been addressed by
this referee with the sentence.

"The absolute identity of amino acids between the 2
groups of peptidases is very low, making it very difficult to
make conclusions about similarities."
If this is the case with just 2 families, one can only imagine
what happens when evaluating 3, 4 and more families.
Our objective was not to impress but to demonstrate the
significance of our results. There are various problems
when dealing with clan AA. In fact, this enzyme group is a
conundrum that cannot be resolved with elegant analyses
but by doing a lot of work usually in the border of the significance, which should be therefore confirmed by various analyses. Upon that, the set developed in this study
works, we tested the different HMMs and MRCs with a
genome project, where they proved excellent to detect and
annotate new sequences. However, as the point we see the
large diversity of clan AA, each protein family is a particular case to study and the study of all cases gives the background to evaluate the whole enzyme group. Our
database project describes different tools (and will probably describe more, see our response to referee 2) which
can be used in many aspects. However, it is also a long
term research where we investigate the origins and diversity of clan AA. To have significant results we should made
different analyses in different ways. For instance, the only
way to resolve by significant means the DTG/ILG template, as a logo as an informative profile, was by anchoring the MRCs and reconstructing various intermediate
states by AMLR. The whole pipeline is a daunting task, but
it has given as various clues to programme several scripts
to process and align not only clan AA but also other fast
evolving protein families. We have rewritten the manuscript with a more appropriate language and have
removed unnecessary material as much as possible such
as the former Tables of BLAST statistic included in the
database (to show that the different HMMs and MRCs
were tested). We hope that this additional correction will
give a more appropriate and easy-to-use aspect to the database. See also our response to referee 2.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/3

Reviewer's comment
P. 10: I don't understand what the following means: "The
analysis revealed a process of evolutionary divergence
organized hierarchically into a natural network from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes".
Authors' response
The analysis refers to the qualitative comparison of the
sequence logos, which at the same time are computational results by themselves. Logo methodology assigns
size to each amino acid species in the graphical representation. This is by using Shannon's algorithm to estimate
the entropy of each amino acid species per alignment
position, and according to information theory. The most
important trouble to follow this issue is that it compresses
so many topics into a single manuscript. The referred network is obvious for an expert working in LTR retroelement
evolution because knows the bio-distribution and differentiation of the LTR retroelement groups into lineages
(clades, genera, etc). In fact, the network was previously
reviewed and introduced regarding Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements in a prior study [18]. In this clan
AA manuscript, we show that the network also extends to
other LTR retroelement groups and other peptidases. The
different motifs are similar but not identical. The hierarchy from prokaryotes to eukaryotes comes from the fact
that motifs can be established in variants establishing different relationships among the different families.
Reviewer's follow-up comment based on second version
Reviewer's comment
The figures are improved, although I still cannot read all
the text in Figure 2. I know that this from a screen shot, so
I guess it is okay. The one remaining problem is that your
manuscript is very much of a "mid-term" progress report.
It suffers from the fact that it does not describe a finished
product. This is probably okay in your field, so I don't
want to make a big point about this.
Authors' response
The analysis of clan AA is work in continuous progress.
For this reason the main focus of the manuscript is the
database tool and the flowchart/pipeline. This manuscript
will be the citation reference for further updates of the
database even if we publish additional data (in further
updates we will not describe the tool just the results in further approaches). This means that the research is inprogress but the database (as version 1) is job completed.
