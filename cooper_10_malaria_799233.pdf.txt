Malaria vectors of Timor-Leste
Robert D Cooper1*, Michael D Edstein1, Stephen P Frances1, Nigel W Beebe2,3

Abstract
Background: The island of Timor lies at the south-eastern edge of Indonesia on the boundary of the Oriental and
Australian faunal regions. The country of Timor-Leste, which occupies the eastern part of the island, is malarious
but anopheline faunal surveys and malaria vector incrimination date back to the 1960 s. Over the last decade the
malaria vectors of south-east Asia and the south-west Pacific have been intensely studied using molecular
techniques that can confirm identification within complexes of isomorphic species. The aim of this study is to
accurately identify the Anopheles fauna of Timor-Leste using these techniques.
Methods: The survey was carried out over the period February to June 2001. Standard entomological techniques human landing collections, larval collections and CO2 baited light traps - were used to collect anophelines from
the main geographical regions: coastal plains, inland plains, and highlands. Specimens were processed for
identification by morphology and genotyped for the ribosomal DNA ITS2 by restriction analysis and/or DNA
sequencing. Phylogenetic relationship of Anopheles sundaicus and Anopheles subpictus individuals was also assessed
using DNA sequences from the ITS2 and mitochondrial cytochrome-b. All specimens, other than those from larval
surveys, were processed to detect the presence of the Plasmodium parasite circumsporozoite protein by ELISA for
vector incrimination.
Results: Of 2,030 specimens collected, seven species were identified by morphology: Anopheles barbirostris,
Anopheles aconitus, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles peditaeniatus, An. sundaicus and Anopheles
vagus. These were confirmed by molecular analysis with the addition of Anopheles flavirostris and an unidentified
species designated here as An. vagus genotype B. This latter species was morphologically similar to An. vagus and
An. subpictus and is likely to be the An. subpictus described by other workers for Timor. However, genetically this
species showed strong affinities to the An. sundaicus complex. Anopheles vagus was the most common species but
was rarely collected coming to bite humans; An. barbirostris and An. vagus genotype B were the two most
common species collected in human landing catches and both were found positive for CS protein.
Conclusions: The anopheline fauna of Timor-Leste is of Oriental origin with no evidence of elements from the
Australian Region. The existence of species complexes will make the use of morphological markers problematic in
the country. Using molecular analysis a number of issues regarding the anopheline fauna of Timor-Leste were
resolved and nine putative species of Anopheles were identified; two species: An. barbirostris and An. vagus
genotype B, were incriminated as malaria vectors.

Background
Timor, of which Timor-Leste (formerly East Timor) is
part, is the largest island at the eastern end of the Lesser
Sunda Islands which form part of the Malayan Archipelago and the country of Indonesia from which TimorLeste recently gained independence. Malaria is endemic
in Timor-Leste, though transmission is not high, tending
to be mesoendemic on the coast, hypoendemic in the

Australia

inland lowland regions, and very low to absent in areas
over 500 m above sea level (asl) [1]. Malaria transmission peaks at the end of the wet season, which occurs
from November to May [2].
The island of Timor lies on the border of the Oriental
and Australian faunal regions, and while, like Australia,
it is of Gondwanic origin the island has never been connected with Australia, even during the glacia-maxima of
the Pleistocene era and the existence of the Shula Shelf
[3]. Its Anopheles fauna appears to be distinctly Oriental,
although it has been reported that members of the

Punctulatus Group, which includes the major malaria
vectors of the south-west Pacific, may occur there [4].
Various publications have listed the anopheline fauna of
Timor-Leste, however they tend to be general in nature
covering either the whole of Indonesia or south-east
Asia [5,6]. Faunal surveys by Portuguese workers mentioned 11 species [7,8]. In 1975, Lien and colleagues
provided a list of 14 anopheline species for Indonesian
Timor [9]. Four species have been incriminated as vectors of malaria: Anopheles barbirostris, Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles subpictus and Anopheles aconitus. Of
these An. barbirostris, An. subpictus and An. sundaicus
are considered as the main vectors [7-9].
The discrepancies presented by the various authors
with regards to anopheline speciation in Timor-Leste
highlights the problems of using alpha taxonomy for
identifying specimens especially where cryptic or isomorphic species are involved. Here the problem is exacerbated as Oriental species have, over the last 5 M
years, moved down from the south-east Asian mainland
through the islands of the Malayan Archipelago allowing
for founder effects and island isolationism, resulting in
cryptic species with subtle changes in morphology.
Accurate species identification, which allows important vectorial parameters to be applied to species, is crucial in malaria transmission studies and in implementing
and monitoring control strategies. Over the last ten
years a considerable amount of work has been done to
validate the identity of the malaria vectors of south-east
Asia and the south-west Pacific using molecular techniques. Species identification is now predominantly based
on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the ribosomal
DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)
region either through restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) or an allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) [10,11]. To date, these techniques have not been
applied to resolve the species identity of the malaria vectors in Timor-Leste; this study rectifies this.
In support of Timor-Leste’s transition to independence, a United Nations Peace Keeping Force was
deployed in September 1999. During the first six months
the Australian Defence Force (ADF) contingent suffered
267 malaria infections (4.8% of 5,500 personnel) consisting of 43 cases of Plasmodium falciparum and 21 cases
of Plasmodium vivax in-country and 212 cases of relapsing P. vivax on return to Australia [12]. During the
period October 2000 to June 2001 anophelines surveys
were conducted on the western border of Timor-Leste
to monitor the risk of malaria to ADF personnel
deployed there as part of the UN Peace Keeping Force.
These collections were made during the wet season
when it would be expected that both vector densities
and malaria transmission would be heightened. The
material collected in this study was analysed by PCR to

provide accurate species identification and by ELISA to
identify the infectious stage of the Plasmodium parasite
and incriminate malaria vectors.

Methods
Climate and geography

The island of Timor lies 9°S and 125°E; Timor-Leste
occupies 18,900 sq km (about two-thirds) of the eastern
part of the island. The climate is tropical monsoon with
distinct wet and dry seasons. Precipitation ranges
between 1,000-2,000 mm p.a.; the wet season occurs
from November to May and accounts for 80-85% of the
annual rainfall, whereas the dry season is from June to
October. The country is mountainous with a central
range up to 2,900 m asl separating the north and south
coasts. There are three main geographical regions: a
narrow coastal plain (0-20 m asl), inland lowland plains
(100-500 m asl), and highland regions (>500 m asl).
Collection methods

Collections of anophelines were made from the Dili
area (coastal) and the Bobonaro District including
coastal, lowland inland and highland areas (Figure 1).
Human landing collections were made over the period
February to June 2001. Sunset was approx 1915 hr and
sunrise 0645 hr. Three human landing catches (HLC)
(1900-0700 hr) were conducted, one on the coast at
the town of Batugade and two inland, around the
towns of Tonobibi and Marko. Forty-four HLC (19000100 hr) were subsequently made, twenty-two of
which were on the coast around the towns of Batugade, Aidabaletan and Port Hera (all <10 m asl); sixteen in the inland lowland region around the towns of
Tonobibi (170 m asl), Maliana (240 m asl) and Marko
(100 m asl); six in the highlands with four at Balibo
(530 m asl), and two at Bobonaro (900 m asl). The
purpose of these HLC was to determine which species
were present in the different geographical zones, which
species were biting humans, and to provide specimens
for circumsporozoite (CS) protein determination. Adult
collections were also made using CO2 baited EVS traps
[13]. Seventeen traps were set: six coastal, eight in the
inland low land areas and three in the highland town
of Balibo. Larval surveys were also conducted throughout the Bobonaro District and around Dili and Port
Hera over the period October 2000 to July 2001. All
specimens were stored frozen at -20°C in the field and
transported on dry ice back to the Army Malaria Institute, Brisbane, for further analysis.
Species identification

All larvae were reared to adults in the site water from
which they were collected. All adult females were identified morphologically using the keys of Bonne-Wepster

and Swellengrebel, Reid, and O’Connor and Soepanto
[6,14,15]. Species identified were further characterised
by PCR-RFLP studies of the rDNA ITS2 which assesses
crude sequence variation and is augmented by the presence of indels (insertions and deletions) common in
this region that can produce diagnostic band profiles in
related species [11,16]. Following PCR amplification,
products were digested with restriction enzymes (Hinf I,
Hha I, Tru 9I, Hsp 92 III, Ali I, Sau 3AI, Sal I, Msp I,
Dde I, and Rsa I) that recognise four nucleotide motives
to produce diagnostic RFLPs of the ITS2 region.
DNA sequencing and analyses

The rDNA ITS2 region was sequenced from species
belonging to recognised complexes based on differential
PCR-RFLP profiles [17]. The mtDNA cytochrome oxidase (cyt-b) fragment was amplified using both PCR and
sequencing primers CBsunA and CBsunB [18]. The 25
μl PCR reaction contained 1.75 mM MgCl2, 200 pM of
each dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.5U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Fisher Biotech, WA, Australia) and approximately 1-20 ng of genomic DNA template (1 μl of
extraction). Cycling conditions included initial denaturing at 93°C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of 93°C for
1 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1.5 min. The PCR product was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen) and sequenced by the Australian Genome

Research Facility (University of Queensland, St Lucia,
Australia) on an ABI3730xl.
Additionally, ITS2 and cyt-b sequences were
obtained from An. subpictus specimens collected from
Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Vietnam. Anopheles
sundaicus and An. subpictus ITS2 and cyt-b sequences
were obtained from Genbank using both species’ name
searches and nucleotide Blast (Blastn) searches through
the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). Sequences drawn from GenBank were limited
to An. sundaicus and related An. subpictus species
(Table 1). Sequence alignments for both markers were
generated in ClustalW [19] and edited for length for
ITS2 and cyt-b and length and repeat structure (ITS2
only). Sequence alignments then underwent Maximum
Likelihood analyses using the GTR+Γ+I model in
PhyML 2.4.4 [20]. Branch support was evaluated by
the bootstrapping method with 100 replicates in
PhyML.
Sporozoite detection

All adult mosquitoes collected in human landing
catches were processed for the presence of CS protein
of P. falciparum and P. vivax 210 (and 247 variant)
using a rapid dip stick method (VecTest™ - Medical
Analysis Systems Inc, Camarillo, California, USA) [21].
Positive samples were confirmed using the standard

Results
Collections and species composition

Three HLC were conducted 1900-0700 hr and indicated
that while anophelines fed sporadically throughout the
night, there was a peak feeding time in the first hour of
the night when the majority of feeding occurred.
Accordingly the remaining HLC were made from 19000100 hr. Thirty-eight larval collections were made

throughout the survey area. Figure 1 shows the locations
where adult, larval and trap collections were made.
A total of 2030 anophelines were collected, 932 from
HLC, 1082 as larvae, and 16 from trap collections. From
these the following seven species were identified by
morphology: An. barbirostris, An. peditaeniatus, An.
aconitus, An. annularis, An. maculatus, An. sundaicus
and An. vagus. All species, except An. maculatus, were
collected in HLC. Anopheles barbirostris, An. vagus, An.
maculatus and An. annularis were also collected as larvae. The results of CO 2 baited traps collections were
poor and from the 17 traps set only 16 anophelines
were collected: An. vagus (×12), An. aconitus (×1), An.
annularis (×2) and An. peditaeniatus (×1).
Collections from highland sites were limited, HLC
(1900-0100 hr) resulted in one An. vagus from Balibo
and no anophelines were collected using this method in
the vicinity of Bobonaro. Around Balibo and Bobonaro
the terrain is rugged and steep with little flat ground
and few potential anopheline larval habitats. Only two
An. vagus larval sites were located at Balibo and one at
Bobonaro. Table 2 shows the types of collections and
the numbers of each species collected; the site numbers
match those in the Figure 1.
Species collected

Anopheles barbirostris was common and widespread
throughout the coastal and inland lowland regions. It
was one of the dominant anophelines collected in HLC
both on the coast (31.2% of total collection) and inland
(38.2% of total collection) though only three larval sites
were located. These sites were large permanent bodies
of water with well-established flora and fauna. Sixty-six
specimens were analysed by PCR-RFLP and there
appeared to be only one ITS2 genotype.
Anopheles peditaeniatus was collected in HLC, but not
as larvae. This species was rarely found on the coast (1/

66) but was common in the inland lowland plains (65/
66). The ITS2 region was examined in 29 specimens; all
were found to be the same RFLP genotype. It was determined that the restriction enzyme Dde I would produce
RFLPs that would reliably separate An. sinensis, An.
crawfordi and An. peditaeniatus. This enzyme identified
all the Timor-Leste material as An. peditaeniatus (confirmed by sequencing: GenBank accession number
AF543862). Additionally sequences from the ITS2
region from these specimens matched those of An. peditaeniatus from China [23]. With many of the specimens
collected, identification based on morphological characters was difficult, and even using all the taxonomic keys,
separation from Anopheles nigerrimus and Anopheles
argyropus was not always possible.
Anopheles aconitus was collected on the coast and
inland (<500 m asl); all in HLC with no larval sites
found. Of the 26 specimens collected 18 were subjected
to molecular analyses [16]. Of these 14 were An. aconitus and four were An. minimus. All 18 specimens were
originally identified as An. aconitus based on the pale
scaling on the proboscis. Given that this is an unusual
character for Anopheles minimus, the four specimens of
this type were sequenced and found to be Anopheles flavirostris. Anopheles aconitus was found coastally and in
the inland lowland plains; An. flavirostris was only
found in the inland plains. The ITS2 sequence from An.
aconitus (GQ500119) was unique although it shows
high similarity (97-98%) to An. aconitus isolates from
south-east Asia, whereas An. flavirostris (GU062188)
showed one nucleotide difference to the same species
from the Philippines.
Anopheles annularis was collected as larvae and in
HLC; all collections were made from the inland plains.
The numbers collected in HLC were low; larval habitats
were natural ground pools with established flora and
fauna. All specimens showed the same ITS2-RFLP

profiles and a subset were sequenced (GU062187) and
showed 99% identity with the same species from southeast Asia.
Anopheles maculatus was collected as larvae from six
locations, all inland below 500 m asl. Anopheles maculatus appeared at the end of the wet season (from May
onwards) when large numbers of larvae were commonly
found in shallow pools formed in the gravel beds of
receding rivers and in shallow water remaining in rice
fields post harvest. Anopheles maculatus is one of several closely related species within the Maculatus Group
[24], the members of which have recently been identified based on ITS2 sequence differences [25]. Molecular
characterisation of 54 specimens (5-10 specimens from
each larval site) indicated one distinguishable ITS2
RFLP genotype. Sequences of the ITS2 region from a
subset of these specimens were the same (GQ500120)
and matched 100% to a GenBank sequence of the same
species collected from Terengganu in Malaysia and also
clustered with other An. maculatus sequences from
Malaysia.
Anopheles sundaicus was found at Port Hera, with
eight specimens collected in HLC. The taxon sundaicus
was recently split based on mitochondrial (COI and cytb) and ribosomal ITS2 markers, with the mainland type
designated Anopheles epiroticus and the island type An.
sundaicus [26-28]. The ITS2 sequence of the Port Hera
specimens matched Variant II, which is one of four distinct ITS2 sequence variants for An. sundaicus [18].
Variant II occurs in Sumatra and Java (Indonesia) and
can occur together with Variants I and III within a single mosquito. Variant IV appears unique to the Malaysian Borneo populations. On comparison of the cyt-b
sequences of the Timor specimens to published
sequences used to develop a PCR diagnostic separating
An. epiroticus, An. sundaicus s.s., and An. sundaicus
species E [18], we found polymorphisms that would not
identify the Timor specimens as either taxa. However,
phylogenetic evolutionary analysis using cyt-b sequences
with published An. sundaicus sequences from south-east
Asian individuals grouped these specimens with An.
sundaicus individuals from Malaysia-Borneo.
Anopheles vagus was the most common species in the
survey region with 1315 specimens identified by morphology. It was taken in larval collections, HLC and
CO2 baited light traps from 32 of the 36 collection
sites. It had the widest distribution of any species being
collected on the coast, inland plains, and highland
regions. The presence of a small pale patch of scales on
the apex of the labium - a character used to separate
An. vagus var. vagus from An. vagus var. limosus [29]
and from An. subpictus [6,14] - was found in 27 of the
1315 specimens collected; the remainder had an allblack labium. Papal morphology, also used to separate

Page 6 of 11

An. vagus and An. subpictus [6,14,15], was not definitive
in these specimens and was difficult to apply as specimens shared characters of both species. It could not be
discounted that some of this material morphologically
resembled An. subpictus.
All specimens morphologically identified as An. vagus
were amplified and digested with the restriction
enzymes Msp I and Rsa I. Both enzymes generated two
unique RFLP profiles, and these genotypes were designated A (901 specimens) and B (414 specimens). The
size of the undigested ITS2 differed between the two
genotypes with A being approximately 700 bp and B
600 bp. All 27 specimens with white scaling on the apex
of the proboscis were identified as genotype A. The
ITS2 sequences of these two genotypes were compared
to existing sequences in GenBank. Genotype A matched
an existing sequence of An. vagus (FJ654649), whereas
genotype B showed highest identity (98%) to An. sundaicus carrying the ITS2 sequence Variant I (AY768540)
[18]. A neotype has recently been raised for An. sundaicus and a detailed morphological description provided;
the neotype and associated topotypic specimens were
collected from Sarawak [28]. The specimens of genotype
B collected from Timor-Leste are morphologically distinct from the An. sundaicus neotype in that the femur
and tibia are not speckled or mottled with white scales.
This characteristic is considered to be of major importance in separating An. sundaicus from An. vagus and
An. subpictus [6,14], thus suggesting here that genotype
B is morphologically closer to An. vagus and An. subpictus than An. sundaicus. Phylogenetic assessment using:
the four ITS2 sequence variants of An. sundaicus, An.
vagus genotype B, and An. subpictus from PNG, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, strongly supports genotype
B clustering with An. sundaicus species (Figure 2A).
Additionally, assessment of the cyt-b sequence (Figure
2B) places An. sundaicus from Timor with An. sundaicus individuals collected from Malaysia and Borneo,
whereas genotype B forms a separate clade basal to the
An. sundaicus species and also separate to An. subpictus
species from Vietnam and PNG. It is thus considered
that genotype A is An. vagus and genotype B - provisionally termed An. vagus genotype B - is an unknown
species resembling An. vagus and An. subpictus morphologically but showing strong genetic affinities to the
An. sundaicus complex. The placement of genotype B
closer to An. sundaicus than to An. subpictus suggests
that a large cryptic species group exists within the An.
subpictus taxon and would require a more thorough
study of An. subpictus throughout its distribution in the
Oriental and Australian Regions to further resolve this
issue.
Of the 901 specimens of An. vagus collected only 61
were in HLC and these were all from inland sites. The

sequences of the rDNA ITS2 (Panel A) and mtDNA cyt-b (PanelB). In Panel A, the ITS2 tree places An. sundaicus from Timor-Leste (TL417)
with the An. sundaicus ITS2 sequence variants I-IV. However, the placement of An. vagus genotype B (TL411) specimens basal to the An.
sundaicus clade suggest a more recent evolutionary connection to An. sundaicus as the An. subpictus individuals from Papua New Guinea,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka appear paraphyletic suggesting several lineages or cryptic species exist within this morphotaxa. In Panel B the
Maximum likelihood analysis of cyt-b sequences places An. sundaicus individuals from Timor-Leste (TL415 and TL 417) within other An. sundaicus
species forming a well supported and separate branch with individuals from Malaysia/Borneo. The cyt-b analysis also places An. vagus genotype
B (TL411 and TL412) basal to the An. sundaicus clade and paraphyletic to An. subpictus individuals, also indicating closer genetic affinities to An.
sundaicus and not An. subpictus. For each of the trees only bootstrap branch support values over 70% are displayed.

larvae were taken both on the coast and inland and
were found in a wide variety of water bodies including
swamps (fresh and brackish), rice fields, smaller ground
pools with both clay and gravel substrates, animal wallows and hoof prints, wheel ruts, concrete drains,
domestic waste water polluted with detergents, truck
tyres and folds in plastic wraps where it cohabited with
the container breeder Aedes albopictus.
Specimens of An. vagus genotype B were commonly
collected in HLC (335/414). All specimens collected by
this method were from coastal sites except for one
inland location (site 22, Tonobibi). Anopheles vagus genotype B was only collected as larvae on the coast and
was more conservative in its larval habits than An.
vagus, being found in large, well-established bodies of
water including coastal lagoons (fresh and brackish) and
large pools in creek lines.
Human biting and sporozoite infections

The landing rate for all anophelines in coastal areas was
24.0 anophelines/human/night (based on 132 hours of
collecting) and for inland areas 14.64 anophelines/
human/night (based on 108 hours of collecting). Anopheles barbirostris and An. vagus genotype B made up
82.1% of the HLC. The landing rate of An. vagus genotype B was 15.6/human/night on the coast, while the
rate for An. barbirostris was 7.44/human/night on the
coast and 5.52/human/night inland.
For all species there appeared to be an observable
peak feeding period early in the evening. On the coast,
24.6% of all feeding occurred in the first hour of the
night from 1900 to 2000 hr, and inland, 49.3% of feeding occurred at this time. The anophelines/human/hr
for 1900-2000 hr was 3.46 for all species while the average hourly landing rate after this was 1.2 anophelines/
human/hr.
From the HLC 907 specimens were processed for circumsporozoite antigen, these consisted of 390 An. barbirostris, 61 An. vagus, 355 An. vagus genotype B, 66
An. peditaeniatus, 20 An. aconitus, 8 An. sundaicus, and
7 An. annularis. Of these, one An. barbirostris, collected
from the inland village of Marko (site 32), was found
positive for CS protein for both Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax (210 variant); and one An. vagus
genotype B, collected from the village of Aidabelatan
(site 8), was found positive for P. vivax (247 variant) CS
protein.

Discussion
The data presented here on anopheline species’ composition supports the concept that the anopheline fauna of
Timor-Leste is of Oriental origin and contains no species from the Australian Region. Thus Timor-Leste is
one of the most south-easterly limits of an Oriental

Page 8 of 11

anopheline fauna that has filtered down from south-east
Asia over the last 5 M years.
Lien and others [9] list 14 species of Anopheles in
Timor-Leste, this being a compilation of the studies of
various earlier workers. More comprehensive studies,
conducted by Portuguese workers, collected both larvae
and adults from 17 locations over a period of five
months, covered most of the country, and identified
nine species of Anopheles [7,8]. The present survey covered only the Bobonaro District and the Dili area, but
included all the main landforms - coastal, inland plains
and highland regions - and with regards to human landing collections and larval habitats, the sampling was
quite intensive. Nine species were collected in the present survey, seven of which were also collected by Fraga
de Azevedo and others [7] these included: An. barbirostris, An. aconitus, An. annularis, An. flavirostris, An.
maculatus, An. sundaicus and An. vagus. In addition, we
collected An. peditaeniatus and An. vagus genotype B
whereas Fraga de Azevedo and others [7] also collected
An. subpictus and Anopheles tesselatus. Other Portuguese workers [8] added An. nigerrimus and Anopheles
barbumbrosus to the records, though for Timor-Leste
this latter species is more likely to be An. barbirostris
[13].
All previous surveys on the anopheline fauna of
Timor-Leste predate the advent of molecular genetic
technologies (PCR and DNA sequencing) and have
relied solely on morphological identification. Morphology is still the mostly commonly used method of identifying anophelines in malarious countries throughout the
world. It has the benefits of being relatively inexpensive
and quick (when compared to molecular methods) and
can be carried out in the field. However, the variation of
morphological characteristics within and between species, the practical limitations of local keys, and the presence of cryptic species within many of the Anopheles
taxa undermines the effectiveness of this identification
method. Still, preliminary morphological identification
remains indispensable for initially assigning specimens
to species groups and complexes, thus simplifying the
task of subsequent molecular analysis.
Species identification is paramount to understanding
malaria epidemiology and so the genetic characterisation
of cryptic species and the subsequent use of molecular
diagnostic tools provide vital support for studies into
mosquito surveillance and malaria control initiatives. In
this study, molecular genetic methods separated An. flavirostris from An. aconitus and differentiated An. sundaicus from An. epiroticus, supporting the concept of
island and mainland species [27] with An. sundaicus
confined to the islands of south-east Asia. Earlier workers have identified An. argyropus, An. nigerrimus and
An. sinensis from the Hyrcanus Group in Timor-Leste

Cooper et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:40
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/40

[9]. There are problems with the morphological identification of these and other members of this group of
mosquitoes throughout south-east Asia and China
[30,31]. It has been suggested that there is too much
variation in many of the characters commonly used to
assign affinities between members of this group [31]. In
the material collected here from Timor-Leste, it was difficult to morphologically separate An. argyropus, An.
nigerrimus and An. peditaeniatus, however PCR and
sequencing of the ITS2 confirmed all the material as
An. peditaeniatus and it is possible that earlier collections of An. argyropus, An. nigerrimus and An. sinensis
were misidentifications of this species. Several members
of the Hyrcanus Group are found in Indonesia, but only
An. peditaeniatus has been found as far east as the
island of Lombok (900 km west of Timor) [32].
Anopheles vagus genotype B morphologically resembles An. subpictus and An. vagus. At the molecular
genetic level however, this mosquito was placed, with
strong branch support by the ITS2 and cyt-b markers,
between An. subpictus and An. sundaicus, with closer
genetic affinities to An. sundaicus. Anopheles vagus genotype B is probably an undescribed new species that has
in the past been misidentified as An. subpictus and thus
may be an important vector of malaria in Timor-Leste
[7-9]. Like An. sundaicus, An. subpictus is also a species
complex, but only a few ITS2 sequences were available
for comparative analyses. Some of these were from India
and Sri Lanka and appeared to be distantly related. To
provide additional comparative data, sequences of An.
subpictus specimens from PNG and Vietnam were
included in the analysis; however, An. vagus genotype B
could still not be placed confidently with either An. subpictus or An. sundaicus.
Interestingly, both An. sundaicus and An. vagus genotype B from Timor-Leste cannot be amplified with the
An. sundaicus PCR diagnostic that separates An. epiroticus, An. sundaicus s.s, and An. sundaicus E [18], because
they do not contain the species-specific sequence mutations required for allele-specific primer binding. Nonetheless, phylogenetically An. sundaicus from Timor
groups with individuals from Malaysia-Borneo, which
are regarded as An. sundaicus s.s., and not Sumatra and
Java (Indonesia) individuals, which are geographically
closer and regarded as An. sundaicus E [10]. The placement of An. vagus genotype B at the base of the An.
sundaicus complex, and as sister taxa to An. subpictus
species, supports the concept that this is a new as yet
undescribed malaria vector species.
A shared evolutionary trait exists within both the An.
sundaicus complex and the An. subpictus complex in
that they are both coastal species that have adapted to
utilising brackish water for oviposition and the development of the immature stages [10]. In this study, An.

Page 9 of 11

vagus genotype B was mainly found on the coast and
the larvae of this species were collected from brackish
water sites. Only one inland site was found and the
ITS2 sequences of specimens from this site matched
those of An. vagus genotype B collected from the coast;
earlier workers collected specimens of An. subpictus
from two inland locations up to 300 m asl [7]. A further
detailed study utilizing both morphological and molecular characters needs to be conducted on the An. vagus
and An. subpictus groups to validate existing morphological markers. For example, how important is the apical
patch of pale scales on the proboscis in separating An.
vagus and An. subpictus?
Anopheles vagus, identified in this study by morphology and confirmed by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing,
fits the behavioural characteristics of this species in that
it is a highly adaptable species, capable of utilising a
wide variety of aquatic habitats including artificial containers. Its reported zoophilic behaviour [14] is supported here with only 6.7% (61/901) of specimens
collected by human landing despite an abundance of larvae being found throughout the survey area.
In April-May 2001 the malaria prevalence rate was
determined by mass blood surveys in seven villages
located in the area where the vector surveys were conducted [1]. The parasite rate ranged from 0% at Bobonaro in the highlands to 35.3% at Batugade on the coast
and on the inland plains it ranged from 6.0% at Marko
to 9.0% at Maliana; these figures indicate that there was
active transmission occurring in the area at the time of
the vector surveys. In prior studies only An. subpictus
has been identified with sporozoites whereas oocysts
have been found in An. barbirostris, An. sundaicus, and
An. aconitus [7-9]. This present study confirms the vector status of An. barbirostris and incriminates An. vagus
genotype B, which is likely to be An. subpictus of earlier
authors.
The peak feeding time for all species of Anopheles collected in Timor-Leste was early in the evening (19002000 hr). This may have implications for malaria control
strategies such as indoor residual spraying or long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, as early night feeding
vectors can avoid these measures by feeding early when
most of the local population is outdoors and
unprotected.
All species collected in this survey, except An. maculatus, were found to feed on humans and so could be
potential vectors of malaria. How important this role
might be will depend on their ability to achieve appreciable numbers, their host preference and their longevity.
Anopheles vagus was very common in the survey region
but appeared to be only an indifferent feeder on humans
and probably plays no role in malaria transmission, confirming similar observations made by other workers

Cooper et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:40
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/40

[7,14]. The ability to achieve appreciable numbers will
vary throughout the year depending on seasonal weather
conditions producing suitable larval habitats. Anopheles
sundaicus has been incriminated as a vector in TimorLeste, but at the time of our surveys its numbers were
very low. Higher numbers have been collected between
March and November by other workers, with some of
these specimens positive for oocysts [7]. Similarly, the
larvae of An. maculatus only appeared in large numbers
at the end of the survey period when the aquatic habitats it appears to favour were plentiful and so in these
surveys the peak period for this species may have been
missed. This highlights the limitation of surveys conducted over one season; only longitudinal surveys over
several years can help to resolve seasonal fluctuations in
species densities.

Conclusions
The anopheline fauna of Timor-Leste consists of Oriental species with no species from the Australian Region.
Accurate morphological identification is difficult due to
the presence of cryptic taxa with overlapping morphological characters, possibly the result of genetic drift in
small isolated island populations following founder
events leading to morphological changes. However, the
simplicity and timeliness of identification by morphology
makes it invaluable in the field even if only as an initial
screening tool prior to molecular analysis.
This study identified seven species of Anopheles morphologically; molecular methods confirmed these and in
addition identified An. flavirostris and a new species
referred to here as An. vagus genotype B. Anopheles barbirostris and An. vagus genotype B were the two taxa
most commonly attracted to humans and both these
species were found positive for Plasmodium CS protein.
