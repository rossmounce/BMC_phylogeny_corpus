Abstract
Background: Helicobacter mustelae causes gastritis, ulcers and gastric cancer in ferrets and other mustelids.
H. mustelae remains the only helicobacter other than H. pylori that causes gastric ulceration and cancer in its
natural host. To improve understanding of H. mustelae pathogenesis, and the ulcerogenic and carcinogenic
potential of helicobacters in general, we sequenced the H. mustelae genome, and identified 425 expressed proteins
in the envelope and cytosolic proteome.
Results: The H. mustelae genome lacks orthologs of major H. pylori virulence factors including CagA, VacA, BabA,
SabA and OipA. However, it encodes ten autotransporter surface proteins, seven of which were detected in the
expressed proteome, and which, except for the Hsr protein, are of unknown function. There are 26 putative outer
membrane proteins in H. mustelae, some of which are most similar to the Hof proteins of H. pylori. Although
homologs of putative virulence determinants of H. pylori (NapA, plasminogen adhesin, collagenase) and
Campylobacter jejuni (CiaB, Peb4a) are present in the H. mustelae genome, it also includes a distinct complement of
virulence-related genes including a haemagglutinin/haemolysin protein, and a glycosyl transferase for producing
blood group A/B on its lipopolysaccharide. The most highly expressed 264 proteins in the cytosolic proteome
included many corresponding proteins from H. pylori, but the rank profile in H. mustelae was distinctive. Of 27
genes shown to be essential for H. pylori colonization of the gerbil, all but three had orthologs in H. mustelae,
identifying a shared set of core proteins for gastric persistence.
Conclusions: The determination of the genome sequence and expressed proteome of the ulcerogenic species
H mustelae provides a comparative model for H. pylori to investigate bacterial gastric carcinogenesis in mammals,
and to suggest ways whereby cag minus H. pylori strains might cause ulceration and cancer.
The genome sequence was deposited in EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession number FN555004.

Background
The genus Helicobacter contains over 50 species, and a
large number of candidate or unclassified species, which
have been isolated from a wide range of vertebrate hosts
(reviewed by Solnick and Vandamme [1]). The type species is Helicobacter pylori (reviewed in ref. [2]), which is
a causative agent for duodenal ulcers & peptic ulcers
[3,4], is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma [5] and
for B cell MALT lymphoma [6]. The majority of

Helicobacter species are not found in the stomach [7].
One enterohepatic species, H. hepaticus has been shown
to cause chronic active hepatitis and typhocolitis in
infected mice [8], development of liver carcinomas in
infected mice [9], and induction of inflammatory bowel
disease symptoms in mice [10]. This contrasts with the
cases of other extragastric Helicobacter species, for
example, with the association of “H. rappini” (taxonomic
name not validly published) with disease in humans and
companion animals (reviewed in ref. [7]). All of the gastric Helicobacter species produce a potent urease, as an
acid protection mechanism, whereas the large number

of enteric species (gastrointestinal, intestinal, hepatic
and biliary) are not uniformly urease positive [7].
The ferret (Mustela putorius) is a valuable element in
comparative medicine, providing inter alia models for
human influenza [11] and infectious gastritis [12,13]. H.
mustelae is a gastric pathogen of ferrets, and was the
second member of the genus identified [14-16]. H. mustelae cells are smaller and typically less helical than
those of H. pylori, with lateral as well as bipolar flagella
[17]. H. mustelae is virtually endemic in ferrets [12,18]
and other mustelids [19], and like H. pylori, stimulates a
humoral immune response [13], including in naturally
infected animals [18], which does not clear the infection.
Experimentally infected ferrets develop a gastritis which
closely resembles the diffuse antral gastritis seen in
some adults, and in children [20]. Ferret gastric epithelial cell proliferation increases upon H. mustelae infection [21], and the bacterium has been linked to gastric
adenocarcinoma [22] and MALT lymphoma [23] in the
infected ferret. Ulcer formation in H. mustelae-infected
ferrets is also common; H. mustelae infection of ferrets
is the only natural model of Helicobacter-associated
ulcer disease, making it a unique model [13]. Although
other recently discovered gastric Helicobacter species
from marine mammals, pigs and companion animals
may also cause gastric ulcers and cancer, the knowledge
base and tractability of the ferret makes it an attractive
animal model for human gastric disease due to Helicobacter infection [24].
Despite being isolated from the ferret stomach, phylogenetic analysis of H. mustelae based upon the 16S
rRNA gene positions it, with H. suncus, in a clade within
the enteric helicobacters [7,25]. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis based upon the 23S rRNA gene resulted
in a discordant tree structure (from that based upon the
16S rRNA gene; [26]), in which H. mustelae was positioned even deeper among the enteric helicobacters.
Another interesting outcome of that study was the positioning of another ε-proteobacterium, Wolinella succinogenes, between H. pylori and H. hepaticus, when
orthology levels of 870 core proteins were analyzed [26].
H. mustelae was not included in that analysis because a
genome sequence was not available.
Driven to a large extent by the desire to understand
their pathogenesis at a molecular level, many of the εproteobacteria have been subjected to genomic analyses.
In addition to two early H. pylori genome sequence
determinations [27,28], draft or complete genome
sequences for 11 additional H. pylori strains are lodged
with NCBI Genome Projects http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Entrez/. However no whole genome sequence for
gastric Helicobacter species other than H. pylori, and the
closely related H. acinonychis, is available so far. Genome sequence projects of an additional five extragastric

Page 2 of 24

species (H. pullorum, H. bilis, H. winghamensis, H, canadensis, and H. cinaedi) are currently underway at the
Broad Institute http://www.broadinstitute.org/. The genomes of H. hepaticus [29], and H. acinonychis [30] have
been sequenced, as have those of Campylobacter jejuni
[31,32], C. lari, C. uppsaliensis and C. coli [33], and W.
succinogenes [34]. Comparative genomic analysis of four
of these Campylobacterales species - H. pylori, H. hepaticus, C. jejuni, W. succinogenes, has been informative
for identifying core proteins and specific adaptations to
pathogenicity or commensalism in the respective species
[35].
Relatively few H. mustelae strains have been characterized in detail at the molecular level. The genome size of
H. mustelae was estimated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to be in the range of 1.685-1.69 Mb for 15
strains examined [36], and the genome was apparently
conserved among the strains at this low discrimination
level. A number of presumptive virulence factors were
identified in H. mustelae. A potent urease UreAB is
implicated in acid-tolerance and pathology [37-39]. Ferrets may be therapeutically immunized against H. mustelae by administration of H. pylori urease protein [40].
The H. mustelae type strain 12198 was recently shown
to produce a second urease enzyme UreAB2 which acts
independently of nickel and accessory proteins. It
appears to be representative of an adaptation by Helicobacter species that colonize the stomachs of carnivores,
in which dietary nickel is limiting [41].
H. mustelae produces a surface array composed of
ring-shaped protein aggregates of the Hsr protein [42],
and which is required for persistent infection by H. mustelae in the ferret model [43]. We have shown that this
surface protein is antigenically variable [44], suggesting
it is subject to antibody pressure. Antigenic variation of
the Hsr protein is achieved by recombining cassettes
encoding epitopes in the passenger region of this autotransporter protein into the expression site [44]. These
cassettes were detected in a 15 kb Hsr locus (HSRL),
only a third of which is occupied by the expressed hsr
gene [44], the rest being devoted to sequences encoding
alternative antigens. Another major surface antigen is
the flagellum, the major components of which have
been well studied [45,46]. Type strains of H. mustelae
have been shown to produce a monofucosyl A type 1
histo-blood group epitope in their LPS [47] and antigastric auto-antibodies are elicited by the type strain
12198 (ATCC 43772) [48]. The structure of lipid A of
H. mustelae strain 43772 differs from that of the lipid A
of H. pylori [49].
Despite a limited genome-wide mutagenesis approach
[50], relatively little about the genomic basis for H. mustelae persistence and pathogenesis in the ferret is
known, since this organism has not benefitted from the

pathogenomics approach that was applied to other Helicobacter species [51]. We report here the genome
sequence of H. mustelae type strain 12198, which is the
first whole genome of a non-H. pylori-H. acinonychis
gastric Helicobacter species. In addition, we compare the
expressed proteome of H. mustelae with that of
H. pylori. These data clarify the species-specific and
host-specific adaptations by these gastric helicobacters,
consolidate the phylogenomics of the genus, and significantly enhance the value of the ferret model for investigating helicobacter-related gastric disease.

Results and Discussion
General H. mustelae Genome Features

The general features of the H. mustelae genome are
summarized in Table 1, and compared to selected other
genomes of members of the Campylobacterales. The
H. mustelae genome comprises a single circular chromosome of 1,578,097 base-pairs, and like most strains of
the ε-proteobacteria selected for sequencing thus far, is
plasmid-free. The GC content of the H. mustelae

genome is the second highest among the Campylobacterales analyzed herein, and is among the highest values
reported for members of the genus [7]. All the Campylobacterales genomes sequenced to date have similarly
high coding densities. H. mustelae has slightly higher
mean predicted CDS length than many other related
bacteria, aided by the fact that the H. mustelae genome
encodes some of the largest proteins ever recorded in
this bacterial group (see below). Laterally acquired DNA
in bacteria can be identified by local anomalies in GC
mol% content, and is often associated with IS elements
or tRNA genes [52]. In pathogenic bacteria in general,
such islands are typically associated with significant augmentation in virulence capability [53], and the H. pylori
cag pathogenicity island is a key determinant of
increased potential to cause more severe pathology
including gastric ulcers and cancer [54]. The cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori is not present in H. mustelae,
nor in any of the other helicobacters or campylobacters,
including H. acinonychis which diverged relatively
recently (ca. 200,00 years) from H. pylori [30]. Although

searching of the H. mustelae genome with the Alien
Hunter program initially identified 23 candidate regions
with anomalous nucleotide content, none of these are
large enough to be considered an island or islets (data
not shown), and they are not characterized by linkage to
phage genes, integrases or tRNA genes. A representative
example is the region from HMU08130 to HMU08170
with a GC content of 41.55 mol%, flanked by direct
repeat sequences in HMU08130 and HMU0818; this
region encodes a presumptive type I restriction-modification system. The region from HMU08300 to HMU08350
has a GC mol% content of 46.69% and harbours several
biosynthesis genes that are also found in H. pylori,
H. hepaticus, W. succinogenes and C. jejuni. Alien Hunter
also detected the primary Hsr locus from HMU08520 to
HMU08780. Analysis of the GC mol% content around
the genome (Fig. 1) shows several smaller stretches of
anomalous GC content, similar to localized deviations in
H. pylori. However, there is no evidence for a pathogenicity island in H. mustelae, in contrast to H. pylori and
H. hepaticus. A curious feature of the H. mustelae genome is the asymmetric nature of the GC skew pattern
([G-C]/[G+C]; Fig. 1). The pattern of GC skew is normally symmetrical for bacterial circular chromosomes
[55]. The lack of symmetry of the H. mustelae GC skew

Page 4 of 24

may be indicative of recent genome rearrangement, as
suggested for Yersinia pestis [56]. This is most likely to
be a localized deletion, since in contrast to Y. pestis, the
GC skew pattern of the H. mustelae genome does not
suggest a transposed genome region. Lack of large-scale
synteny between helicobacter genomes (see Comparative
Genomics below) complicates identification of such a
presumptive deleted region.
The paucity of insertion sequence elements and bacteriophage-related genes in H. mustelae (Table 1) suggests that these mechanisms are not significant agents
of diversity generation in this species, a process which is
driven in H. pylori by free recombination [57]. Thus it
was surprising to identify a CRISPR locus and three cas
genes (HMU00230-00250) in the H. mustelae genome,
as these features have recently been identified as a
phage resistance mechanism [58]. CRISPR loci have not
been annotated in other helicobacter or campylobacter
genomes. HMU00670 encodes another potential phage
resistance mechanism, a predicted Abortive Infection
(Abi) protein. H. acinonychis is unusual in having two
complete prophages in its genome (one of which is no
longer contiguous, due to genome decay), which has
been attributed in part to the presence of only six predicted functional restriction-modification loci compared

to eleven in H. pylori [30]. The H. mustelae genome also
encodes 6 predicted restriction-modification systems.
Virulence-related Genes in H. mustelae

Members of the Campylobacterales whose genome has
been sequenced to date harbour a variable complement
of known or inferred virulence factors genes (reviewed
comparatively in ref. [35]). Many of these factors have
not actually been studied for biological significance
except in H. pylori, where the linkage to gastric colonization or pathogenesis for some defined traits is generally very clear [2]. The presence in the H. mustelae
genome of homologues to genes whose products have
been linked to colonization, persistence or pathogenesis
in related organisms is summarized in Table 2. As
noted above, a cag pathogenicity island is not present.
Relative to H. pylori, the H. mustelae genome contains a
second (additional) urease operon AB2, that contributes
to acid resistance [41]. There is no full-length H. mustelae ortholog of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA of
H. pylori. Homology searches with the H. pylori vacA
gene identified 10 predicted autotransporter (AT) genes,
organized into three cluster, plus the Hsr locus, and one
singleton HMU08270 (Additional File 1). HMU04240 is
a VacA homologue that lacks an autotransporter
domain. Significantly, when the autotransporter betabarrel domain is excluded from the analysis, six of the
VacA homologues detected using the full length VacA
sequence (HMU00600, HMU00620, HMU00630,
HMU01180, HMU01190 and HMU08270 show no

Page 5 of 24

significant identity between their passenger domains and
database entries. HMU06680 and HMU06730 are annotated as glycine-rich autotransporters, located in AT
cluster 3. Regions of HMU06680 display 32% identity to
HP0922 (a toxin-like outer membrane protein/VacA
paralog) and significant residue identity in the passenger
domain to an immunodominant antigen in H. bilis
(accession AAQ14336). In addition, two regions of the
HMU06680 protein, residues 100-130 and 1339-1494,
show ca. 25% residue identity to passenger-domain
regions of VacA, and VacA-like proteins in H. pylori.
Several older studies have suggested that H. mustelae
does not produce vacuolating cytotoxic activity [59,60],
so the biological significance of these VacA-related proteins is unclear. Of the remaining autotransporters, one
is the Hsr variable surface antigen HMU08630, in a
genetic configuration similar to strain 4298, flanked by
cassettes for alternative epitopes [44]. The predicted
autotransporter HMU08270 comprises 4,094 amino
acids, has no significant identity to database entries, and
an unusual autotransporter domain, which is not at the
extreme carboxy-terminus. Finally HMU06740 lacks a
predictable signal peptidase cleavage site, and is unusually small for an autotransporter protein. The distinctive wealth of this class of secreted protein in
H. mustelae, the evidence for their production (see
below) and the likelihood of their involvement in host
interaction, make this bacterium a potentially productive
model for exploring autotransporter evolution and biological function.

Outer membrane proteins are important for the pathogenesis of H. pylori. The genome of H. mustelae contains 26 genes that were annotated as encoding putative
outer membrane proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these
proteins relative to the categorized H. pylori OMPs [61]
showed that some of the H. mustelae OMPs group with
H. pylori orthologs (Fig. 2). For example HMU05640,
HMU05650, and HMU10680 convincingly cluster in the
clade containing the 8 members of the Hof OMP family
of H. pylori, and the three Hof-related H. mustelae proteins show similar size and C-terminal motif to the
H. pylori Hof proteins (Table 3). Apart from the fact
that HP0486 is expressed and is not heat-modifiable
[62], suggesting it is not a porin, nothing is known
about the function of Hof proteins. Interestingly, a
further 12 H. mustelae OMPs cluster in two groups
either side of the Hof protein clade (Fig. 2). None of the
annotated H. mustelae OMP sequences position phylogenetically in the tight Hop-containing clade that
includes BabA, SabA and OipA, and orthologs of these
three adhesins are absent in the H. mustelae genome.
One Omp in H. mustelae, HMU04150, is positioned on
the periphery of a clade containing both Hor and Hop
proteins of H. pylori (Fig. 2). However HMU04150 lacks
the characteristic (AEX [D, N]G) motif present in the
H. pylori Hop proteins, and its carboxy terminal motif
(Table 3) is more similar to Hor proteins. HMU11950
clusters with the three FecA orthologues of H. pylori.
The majority of the remaining H. mustelae OMPs are
currently unclassified (Table 3). They almost all share
the properties of relatively small size, and lack of significant-identity database homologues. Some have atypical
carboxy terminal sequences for OMPs, and signal peptidase cleavage sites that are not readily predicted. Two of
them are expressed (see below), indicating significant
production levels, and the biological function of these
unclassified OMPs warrants further investigation.
The H. mustelae genome encodes many other proteins
likely to contribute to virulence, based upon information
available for homologues (Table 2). Close to the origin
of replication, in a region distinguished by anomalously
low GC content, are two genes related to haemolysis or
haemagglutination. HMU00160 encodes a predicted protein with significant homology to haemolysin activators
of diverse gram-negatives including Photorhabdus luminescens, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and a pathogenicityisland encoded determinant of E. coli [63]. HMU00170
Hag/Hly encodes a predicted 227 kDa protein with predicted signal peptide, and containing Pfam motifs for
haemagglutination (Haemagg_act; PF05860), filamentous
haemagglutinin (Fil_haemagg; PF05594), and an ATP/
GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop). Homologues of this
protein constitute a large family whose members are
widely distributed among gram-negative pathogens, are

Page 6 of 24

annotated as either haemagglutinins or haemolysins, but
which appear to lack functional characterization. The
residue identity with HMU00170 is confined to the first
350 residues of that protein, and is particularly high
over the filamentous haemagglutinin region (ca. 35-50%
identity). Homologues of this pair of genes are lacking
in helicobacters and campylobacters, suggesting this
is an H. mustelae-specific acquisition among the
ε-proteobacteria.
H. mustelae has two orthologs (HMU02820 and
HMU09010) of HP0508, which has been characterized
as a plasminogen binding protein in H. pylori [64]. The
biological significance of this phenotype in either gastric
pathogen is unclear. HMU0700 was annotated as CiaB
by virtue of containing a low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase Pfam domain, and significant residue identity to the C. jejuni CiaB
(Campylobacter Invasion Antigen B; Cj0914c) protein.
This protein is required for maximal invasion of epithelial cells by C. jejuni, and is notably exported by the flagellar export apparatus [65]. Another recently
discovered Cia protein, Cj1242 [66], is not present in
the H. mustelae genome. Homologues of CiaB have
been annotated in W. succinogenes and H. hepaticus, but
not in H. pylori, which is curious because CiaB is also
present in ε-proteobacteria isolated from sea vents [67],
which are located on the deepest branch of the ε-proteobacterial tree. Like H. pylori, H. mustelae lacks the
N-glycosylation system that contributes to pathogenesis
in Campylobacters [68,69], and the genes for which are
also present in H. hepaticus, W. succinogenes and sea
vent ε-proteobacteria [67]. HMU10120 is a homologue
of proteins in other Campylobacterales which was first
described in C. jejuni as PEB4a, and which is a major
antigen and cell adhesin [70,71]. The HMU10120 gene
product was detected in the H. mustelae proteome (see
below). Its role as an adhesin warrants further scrutiny,
since it surprisingly contains a rotamase Pfam domain.
Another candidate virulence/survival determinant in
H. mustelae is HMU12690, which is a homologue of
the H. pylori neutrophil activating protein HP0243
[72]. This has recently been described as one of three
H. pylori proteins diagnostically predictive for development of gastric cancer [73]. NapA also has a role in
protecting H. pylori from oxidative stress [74]. These
features, coupled with the high-level expression of the
HMU12690 protein in H. mustelae (see below), suggest
that it may be relevant for survival or pathogenesis in
the ferret stomach. The H. mustelae gene HMU06150
is homologous to Cj1327 and Cj1328, two genes
involved in sialic acid biosynthesis, HMU06140 is
annotated as an acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase.
Thus, H. mustelae may decorate its surface with sialic
acid.

H. pylori incorporates human blood group antigens
into its LPS (reviewed in references [75-77]) in a strain
dependent manner. Ferrets express a structure equivalent to human blood group A on gastric tissue, and H.
mustelae strains express blood group A antigen in their
LPS [47,78]. The H. mustelae genome includes divergent
orthologues of ten out of fourteen genes [77] implicated
in H. pylori LPS biosythesis/blood group antigen production (Additional File 2). Some of these candidate

orthologues are so divergent that they cannot be confidently separated from potential flagellin glycosylation
genes (see below). The H. mustelae repertoire includes a
single predicted fucosyl transferase, encoded by
HMU12060. H. pylori fucosyltransferases display low
identity to mammalian enzymes. Interestingly,
HMU12050 encodes a predicted blood group AB glycosyltransferase, which shows 31-33% BLAST identity
against mammalian AB glycosyltransferases, and putative

glycosyltransferases from E. coli O86 and Haemophilus
somnus (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a bacterial gene for synthesizing mammalian
blood group A/B antigen which is known to be actually
produced on the bacterial surface. It is expected by analogy with H. pylori (reviewed in ref. [75]) that this gene
product will contribute to the ability of H. mustelae to
adapt to the gastric environment (immune avoidance),
modulate inflammation and immune cell recognition,
and exacerbate pathology by triggering autoimmunity.
The ferret model provides an excellent platform to test
these hypotheses.
There are 4 secretion systems predicted in the H. mustelae genome (see below), including the flagellum protein
export system. Motility conferred by flagella is an essential property for successful colonization of the ferret by
H. mustelae [79], and the hook and flagellin proteins of
H. mustelae have already been characterized [45,46].
The annotation of the H. mustelae genome revealed a
typical set [80] of Campylobacterales flagellar genes
(Additional File 3), for structural components, glycosylation, regulation, and chemotaxis. The number of chemotaxis genes is reduced compared to H. pylori, with
orthologs of cheV1, tlpC, and tlpA apparently being
absent. This may be functionally offset by the presence
of HMU05990, a putative MCP-type signal transduction
protein, which includes a PAS domain sensor sequence
(Pfam 08447). This protein is absent in H. pylori and
H. hepaticus, and its closest homolog is in C. jejuni.
H. pylori contains several genes including HP0840 and
HP0366, whose products result in glycosylation of

flagellin with pseudaminic acid [81], which is required
for flagellin assembly into flagellar filaments [82]. The
H. mustelae genome includes a clear orthologue of
HP0840 (designated flaA1; Additional file 2, Table S2).
Two potential homologues of HP0366, HMU06610 and
HMU02370, were identified in the H. mustelae genome.
Another group of H. mustelae genes, HMU11700HMU11730, shows some relatedness to Cj1311-Cj1317,
involved in flagellin sialylation, but their function, and
indeed the glycosylation state of H. mustelae flagellins,
is still unknown. A noteworthy feature is the fact that
two essential motility genes, fliK (HMU07800; hook
length control protein) and motA (HMU03580; motor
protein) are pseudogenes in the sequenced strain, which
we subsequently confirmed to be non-motile (data not
shown). The original type strain used for the species
description emendation [17] was motile, as are H. mustelae isolates from wild ferrets [18]. In the case of FliK,
HMU07800 is flanked upstream by an ORF encoding
277 amino acids, which is preceded by a perfect GGN10 -GC s54 promoter motif expected for fliK [83,84].
Thus, a frame-shift between HMU07800 and
HMU07790 has inactivated fliK. The gene for MotA
also appears to have suffered a frameshift. We assume
that these mutations occurred during recent laboratory
passage, in a manner similar to frame-shift inactivation
of fliP in H. pylori strain 26695 [85], revertants of which
can be easily obtained on motility agar at high plating
density.
The 3 other complete or partial protein secretion systems predicted from the H. mustelae genome are

O’Toole et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/164

presented in Additional File 4. The Sec system genes are
not linked, except for secD and secF, which are clustered
with yajC. Like other ε-proteobacteria, H. mustelae lacks
SecB; it has a single secA gene. The secE gene was
found by homology search, internal to the tlp gene and
in the opposite strand. There is a single tatB-tatC gene
cluster. The tatA gene is present (HMU02290) but the
tatE gene is apparently absent. It is thus not clear if
the H. mustelae Tat system is functional. Relevant for
the abundance of autotransporters, we annotated a gene
predicted to encode an Omp85(YaeT) homolog, which
has a critical role in outer membrane protein insertion/
biogenesis [86]. Analysis of the Gsp genes suggested the
presence of a fragmented or remnant pilin biosynthesis
system. The genes encoding GspDEF (also called
CtsDEF) are clustered. However, there are other ORFs
around them that have no significant homology to Gsp
or type IV pilin-related proteins, except for a putative
pseudopilin but this is unusually distantly separated
from the others. Putative PilT-encoding and prepilin
peptidase genes were also found separately on the chromosome, and not near anything that looks like encoding
type IV pili or GSP machinery. Thus there may be a
pilin assembly unit in the H. mustelae genome, which
could contribute to pathogenicity, but functional investigation is required. Types IV and VI secretion system
components were not found.
The presence of homopolymeric tracts in and between
genes has been identified as a potential antigenic variation mechanism in C. jejuni [31], H. pylori [28] and
H. hepaticus [29], and has been postulated to compensate for the relative paucity of transcriptional regulators.
Disregarding polyA or polyT repeats because of the high
genomic AT content, we identified 12 genes potentially
affected by variation in copy number of intragenic
homopolymers, and 8 potentially affected by intergenic
variation (Additional file 5). Only two of the former
category showed actual length variation in the shot-gun
read data, compared to three of the latter. As expected
from other Campylobacterales, the dominant gene function affected was surface architecture, at either protein
or carbohydrate level. However, the overall number of
genes potentially affected by this putative method of
antigenic variation was significantly lower than H. pylori,
C. jejuni or H. hepaticus. This may be due to the dominant coverage by the Hsr protein, which is a major antigen, and which changes epitopes by recombination [44].
The Expressed Proteome of H. mustelae

We prepared sub-cellular fractions from H. pylori and
H. mustelae, and first compared them by SDS-PAGE
(Fig. 4). We cultured both species for two days on plates,
compared to five-days used for the initial H. pylori proteome analysis [87], to minimize development of coccoid

forms [88]. The initial supernatant from harvesting the
cells was designated as an extracellular fraction, since it
was expected to contain exported proteins. In accordance
with the well-documented property of autolysis for
H. pylori [89], the extracellular fraction of both species
shared many bands with the cytosolic fraction of the
respective species (Fig. 4). However, it was also clear that
most of the proteins were apparently not shared between
the two species. The greatest number of co-migrating
bands between species was observed in the cytosol fraction, while the envelope fractions of the two species contained distinctive protein profiles. The H. mustelae
envelope fraction contained around eight major proteins,
less than half the number in the H. pylori envelope fraction, and few if any appeared to be produced by both
species, consistent with the predictions from their respective genome sequences.
The dominant proteins in the envelope and cytoplasmic compartments of H. mustelae were identified by
LC-MS. The most abundant 50 proteins in each fraction
are presented in Table 4 and Table 5; the complete
datasets are available in Additional file 6 and Additional
file 7. The membrane proteome includes several cytoplasmic proteins that are also known to be highly

expressed in H. pylori, including alkyl hydroperoxide
reductase AhpC, flavodoxin and thioredoxin [87], and
bacterioferritin [90]. Resistance to oxidative stress, and
electron transfer functions, are clearly important processes that are performed using similar proteins in the
two species. These proteins are all known to form
either higher molecular weight aggregates, or membrane associations, which may explain their presence
in the insoluble cell fraction. The AhpC protein, originally and mistakenly thought to be H. pylori-specific
[91], was reported to be produced by several other
Helicobacter species but not H. mustelae [92], although
the gene was detectable in H. mustelae by PCR. The
abundant soluble urease subunits A and B were also
present in the insoluble fraction, as well as the cytosolic fraction, either through aggregation or membrane
association in the former. The UreA2 and UreB2 structural sub-units were not detected, even though their
mass fingerprints are clearly distinguishable from UreA
and UreB (not shown). This non-production under our
growth conditions is consistent with the observation
that the expression of the Ure2 operon in H. mustelae
only occurs under nickel limitation [41]. Despite the
apparent lack of similarity between the H. pylori and
H. mustelae proteomes in one-dimensional electrophoresis, when the 20 most abundant proteins detected

were cross-compared to the H. mustelae cytosolic proteome, all 20 were present in the latter sample (Table
6). The relative abundances cannot be reliably compared due to differences in the methodologies, and
growth phases of cells. The shorter growth period we
used is reflected by the lower levels of stress proteins
and higher levels of elongation factor EF-Tu in the
detected H. mustelae proteome. Future comparative
transcriptomic and proteomic investigations are needed
to identify variations in core genome expression
between the two species. In addition, we will compare
the H. mustelae transcriptome and proteome after 5

days growth to that of H. pylori, to clarify comparative
issues with the current datasets.
The abundant members of the cell envelope proteome
include proteins involved in metabolism (e.g. ATP
synthase), transport (e.g. ABC transporter subunits),
secretion (SecG, lower amounts of SecA), and several
flagellar proteins (Table 4). Notable among the most
abundant proteins is HMU14250, a hypothetical protein
with homology to pseudopilin or pilin subunits (see
above). Less than 1% of the expressed cytosolic proteome was annotated as “hypothetical”. In contrast, six
of the top fifty proteins in the membrane proteome
were annotated as “hypothetical”, as was 10% of the
total detected membrane proteome, validating the gene
annotation process, and highlighting the possible contribution of proteins of unknown function to the biology
of H. mustelae. Of the 26 predicted outer membrane
protein in H. mustelae, only 4 of these, HMU0564,
HMU0565, HMU1360 and HMU1367, were detected in
the membrane proteome (Table 4). The fact that two of
these are encoded by contiguous genes and likely cotranscribed is suggestive that their successful detection
is due to similarly high expression levels. It is likely that
some or many of the other predicted outer membrane
proteins are actually expressed, but are below the detection limit, estimated to be in the micromolar range. Surface proteins detected in the expressed proteome also
included HMU04120, a putative OM component of an
efflux system. Of the 10 autotransporter proteins annotated, 7 of these were detected, at relatively high levels.
Interestingly, at 1.37 Mol%, the dominant surface ringforming protein Hsr was not the most highly expressed
protein. HMU0118 was detected at 1.72% Mol% and
HMU0063 at 1.73%. HMU0118 is 29% identical to the
Hsr protein and HMU0063 is 38.8% identical to Hsr,
but in both cases, the identity at the amino terminal
exposed part of the molecule is low. Although the Hsr
gene was identified and cloned by immunoreactivity
with antiserum raised against purified Hsr protein, and

a. H. pylori annotation; b. Cytosolic fraction

this antiserum labeled the surface rings by immunoelectron microscopy [42], the possibility remains that the
surface rings are composed of more than one autotransporter protein. This would contribute to even greater
antigenic variability of the H. mustelae surface caused
by recombination of sequences for new epitopes into
the expressed Hsr protein [44].
Sequence motifs associated with high-level protein
production

Relative protein production levels determined by
high-throughput LC-MS will be modulated by factors
including transcription rates, translation efficiency, susceptibility to proteolysis, and limitations of solubility.
Notwithstanding these complexities, we searched the
intergenic regions of the H. mustelae genome for motifs
associated with the genes for the 426 proteins detected
in the combined proteome fractions. Only non-coding
intergenic regions, from positions -40 to -200 from the
start codon were searched, as most DNA-binding motifs
are found within these regions [93]. This analysis identified several sequence elements strongly associated with
elevated protein detection proportions. The top five

variants of each of five motifs detected upstream of
genes in the envelope and cytosol fraction proteomes
are presented in Additional file 8 and Additional file 9.
Motifs associated with the most highly expressed proteins in the membrane fraction (Motifs 1 and 2) tended
to be localized 60-150 nt from the start of the ORF and
might represent a binding site for a positive regulator.
Motif 3 overlapped the presumptive ribosome binding
site except in one case. None of the motifs appeared to
correspond to a composite promoter configuration, and
in the case of genes with known promoters (e.g. flaB;
HMU07150), the expected s54-dependent promoter was
not found. Interestingly, the motif listed in Additional
file 8, Table S8 for HMU01180 was found, in identical
sequence and position, on the opposite strand upstream
of HMU01190. These two genes are essentially identical
in the regions encoding the signal sequences and autotransporter domains, and could arguably have evolved
by a gene duplication event, that would have conserved
this motif without selection. Alternatively it could represent a conserved control element for these highly
expressed proteins. The motifs located in the upstream
flanks of the genes for highly expressed soluble proteins

O’Toole et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/164

are also located further from the ORF, in most cases,
than would be expected for a promoter. Motif 4, as for
Motif 3 for the membrane proteins, is the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Genome-wide functional analysis of
helicobacter expression signals, by transcript mapping,
deletion analyses and gene fusions, is warranted.
Comparative Genomics and phylogeny of the
ε-Proteobacteria

Alignment of the H. mustelae genome sequence with
those of W. succinogenes, C. jejuni, H. pylori and
H. hepaticus revealed lack of extensive i.e. long-range
synteny with any of these genomes (Fig. 5), a feature
noted for other genomic comparisons within the Campylobacterales [35]. Although the ACT software allows

Figure 5 Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) alignment of selected
genomes with that of H. mustelae. Alignments were performed
as described in Methods and visualized with a 500 residue cut-off.
In the bottom alignment, the published genome sequences of H.
pylori and H. hepaticus were re-ordered so that co-ordinate1 was the
start of the DnaA gene. The cag pathogenicity and genome island
of H. pylori and H. hepaticus, respectively, are asterisked.

visualization of mutually reversed homologous
sequences, it was noteworthy that comparing H. mustelae to W. succinogenes or C. jejuni seemed to more
clearly highlight a vestigial genome backbone than comparing it to H. pylori or H. hepaticus (Fig. 5). Re-orienting the H. pylori and H. hepaticus genomes with the
dnaA genes at co-ordinate 1 partly clarified the rungs of
a conserved ladder of homology between the genomes,
but this was still largely obscured by the numbers of
relative transpositions and reversions of multiple loci
between the genomes. The rungs in the ladder are
formed by genes including dnaA, gyrase, a putative
metallo-beta-lactamase (shared with H. hepaticus), and
gatB, the 2-oxoglutarate:acceptor oxidoreductase operon.
This analysis also highlighted the degree to which lack
of synteny in the compared genomes is due to transposition across the origin-terminus axis, resulting in an
X-shaped alignment that is symmetric about the origin
of replication as previously noted in other bacteria by
Eisen [94]. This symmetry indicates homologous loci at
the same distance from the origin but on the opposite
side of the origin, which is explained by the fork replication theory [95]. The genome alignments highlight the
absence of the H. pylori cag pathogenicity island and the
H. hepaticus genomic island (from HH_232 to HH_303)
in the H. mustelae genome (Fig. 5). Relatively few longer
stretches of the H. mustelae genome lack any significant
homologues in H. pylori or H. hepaticus; those that
exist include HMU00600-HMU00690 that includes AT
cluster 1; HMU01180-HMU01200 including AT cluster
2; and HMU10860-HMU10880 that encodes a predicted
tricarboxylate transport system not found in the other
Helicobacter species.
To explore the phylogenomics of the Campylobacterales for which genome sequence data were available, we
first performed pair-wise alignments of their proteomes
and then constructed a matrix based on their relatedness. Using methods derived during our studies of
another bacterial group within which genetic distances
are very long, the Lactobacillales [96], we defined orthologues at protein level, requiring 30% identity over 80%
of the sequence lengths. The pair-wise alignment data is
presented in Additional file 10. These data indicated
that H. mustelae was closest phylogenetically to
H. hepaticus, followed by H. pylori and the the Campylobacters. A tree constructed based on 212 orthologous
proteins shared between the respective taxa (Fig. 6)
showed two major branches, one including the four
Camplyobacter genomes. In the second branch, H. mustelae clustered most closely with H. pylori and with the
enterohepatic species H. hepaticus. W. succinogenes was
peripheral to the Campylobacter clade. This topology is
more concordant with the 16S rRNA phylogeny of
Dewhirst [26] and Gueneau [25] than with the 23S

rRNA gene phylogeny constructed by Dewhirst et al,
which the authors suggested to be more robust [26].
The positioning of W. succinogenes in particular by the
23S rRNA gene phylogeny is significantly different from
that based on numbers of orthologs in the current study
including H. mustelae. Our exclusion of W. succinogenes
from the helicobacters also conflicts with a phylogeny
constructed in the same study by Dewhirst and colleagues [26], based on 870 shared proteins.
We have previously used Supertree analysis to clarify
relatedness in distant taxa [96]. The advantage of this
approach is that it combines the maximum likelihood
trees constructed from each of hundreds of core proteins, in this case the 212 proteins shared by all taxa
(Fig. 7). This all-against-all comparison identified numbers of proteins specific to major groups (Fig. 7). The
three helicobacters constituted a reasonably robust
group, with over thirteen hundred core proteins,
compared to 1097 in the four campylobacters. The consensus supertree constructed for the eight Campylobacterales plus outgroup is presented in Fig. 8. Based on
this more restricted set of core proteins, W. succinogenes
still positioned on the edge of the Helicobacter clade.
H. pylori was most closely related to H. mustelae. However this H. pylori-H. mustelae branch was the least supported by the combined frequencies of the individual
maximum likelihood trees, indicating the instability of
this phylogenetic relationship. Considering the pairwise
comparisons, whereby H. mustelae was most closely
related to H. hepaticus (Additional file 9, Table S9), the
choice of proteins clearly has a profound affect on the

sequences were analyzed.

phylogeny inferred. The choice of T. maritima as outgroup may also have affected the outcome, but the
number of shared orthologs was only 252 when this
taxon was not included in the all-against-all comparison,
suggesting this was not a major factor. As for the pairwise ortholog analysis and the phylogeny based on concatened core proteins (Fig. 6), W. succinogenes did not
cluster among the helicobacters, and the data do not
support the notion of revising the nomenclature of
these genera [26].

Conclusions
H. pylori infects over half the global population [97].
Although the majority of infected individuals do not
develop cancer [98], the prevalence rates mean that a
significant number of subjects will suffer a preventable
neoplastic transformation. Development of mammalian
cancer in response to bacterial infection is a relatively
recently recognized phenomenon [99], and this outcome
has also been robustly attributed to H. hepaticus and
H. mustelae. The H. mustelae-ferret system presents a
model for studying the development of gastric cancer.
Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for cancer, because
of a shift in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes
towards a more anti-apoptotic phenotype [100]. Human

Page 17 of 24

infections with cag-positive strains of H. pylori are much
more frequently associated with neoplastic outcomes
[101]. Cag-minus strains are less infrequently associated
with non-atrophic gastritis and duodenal ulceration
[102]. However it has long been recognized that infection with Cag-minus H. pylori poses a significantly
greater risk for gastric cancer compared to non-infection
[103]. Indeed in a recent primary study and accompanying meta-analysis, the increased gastric cancer risk due
to infection by a Cag-minus strain compared to noninfection was four-fold [104], and the reviewed values in
well controlled studies ranged from two-fold to fivefold. Given the time-scale over which neoplastic transformations occur, the development of cancer due to
Helicobacter spp. will likely have a major component of
chronic inflammation. Among the three species known
to be carcinogenic, convergent infection-related disturbances of pro-apoptotic pathways is thus likely to be the
key feature, rather than a single pro-carcinogenic microbial product or metabolite common to all three species.
The strong linkage of cag to human gastric cancer thus
appears to be a specific host-bacterium phenomenon. A
search for “carcinogenicity determinants” should encompass complex persistence mechanisms and host-interaction molecules, and not focus solely on overt effectors
such as CagA. Animal model systems may be useful
for such searches. Haas and colleagues identified 47
H. pylori genes that were required for gastric colonization of the Mongolian Gerbil [105]. Orthologues of all
but three of these genes are found in the H. mustelae
genome (Additional file 11), including a collagenase
shown to be a functional enzyme when cloned from
H. pylori [105]. Some of the H. mustelae orthologues
are quite divergent, suggesting a degree of host-adaptation or lack of strong selection, but nevertheless indicating that the primary gastric persistence mechanisms of
H. pylori and H. mustelae are essentially conserved.
In addition to the lack of cag in H. mustelae, the lack
of VacA and the major H. pylori adhesins indicates that
colonization and persistence of these two gastric species
is mechanistically different. This may simply reflect
immunological and physiological differences between
ferret and human stomach [106], but also the fact that
the pathology of human gastritis is generally more
severe [13]. The striking abundance of autotransporter
proteins in H. mustelae strongly indicates a role for
these molecules in host interaction. The Hsr AT protein
decorates the H. mustelae surface in a paracrystalline
array of ring structures that are antigenically variable,
presumably to avoid a humoral immune response that
would clear the infection. Attempts to develop vaccines
against H. pylori have been largely unsuccessful, despite
promising animal trials (reviewed in ref. [107]). The reasons for this failure are complex, but include the fact

O’Toole et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/164

that key adhesins are low copy number OMPs, and that
immune cells are actively targetted by VacA. Investigation of how the ferret immune response may be
exploited to eradicate or prevent H. mustelae infection
could be informative for preventing H. pylori infection
in humans.
Paradoxically, C. jejuni persists as a commensal of
birds, and W. succinogenes as a commensal of ruminants, despite both genomes being endowed with known
(C. jejuni) or inferred (W. succinogenes) virulence determinants. As the sequencing of its genome has revealed,
some of these are also shared with H. mustelae. Just as
has been argued for H. pylori strains [2], and for pathogens in general [108], what defines a pathogen and a
disease outcome involves the phenotype of the microbe,
the genotype of the host, and the vigour and appropriateness of the host response. Comparative and functional genomics of the ε-proteobacteria will be a fertile
area to explore these hypotheses.

Methods
Cell culture and growth conditions

Helicobacter mustelae strain 12198 (identical to CCUG
25175 and ATCC 43772, the type strain of H. mustelae)
was cultured as described previously [87,109] on chocolate blood agar plates (CBA; Oxoid Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) for 48 h at 37°C in an atmosphere containing
5% CO2.
DNA extraction, genome sequencing, and annotation

High molecular weight genomic DNA of H. mustelae
was extracted as previously described [42]. The genome
of H. mustelae strain 12198 was sequenced to approximately 8-fold coverage, from pUC18 (insert size 2.8-3.3
kb and 3.0-3.3 kb) genomic shotgun libraries using bigdye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 automated
sequencers. End sequences from large insert BAC
libraries in pBACehr (insert size 10-25 kb) and
pBACe3.6 (insert size 12-15 kb) were used as a scaffold.
All repeat regions were bridged by read-pairs or endsequenced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products.
The sequence was finished to standard criteria [110].
Sequence assembly, visualization, and finishing were
performed using PHRAP (http://www.phrap.org;
P. Green, unpublished data) and Gap4 [111]. The
sequence and annotation of the H. mustelae 12198 genome has been deposited in EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ
under accession number FN555004.
The H. mustelae genome sequence was annotated
using Artemis software [112]. Initial coding sequence
(CDS) predictions were determined by Orpheus [113],
Glimmer2 [114], and EasyGene software [115]. These
predictions were collated and combined, and were
further refined by reference to codon usage, positional

Page 18 of 24

base preference methods and comparisons to the non
redundant protein databases using BLAST [116] and
FASTA [117]. The entire DNA sequence was also compared in all six potential reading frames against UniProt,
using BLASTX [116] to identify any possible coding
sequences previously missed. Protein motifs were identified using Pfam [118] and Prosite [119], transmembrane
domains were identified with TMHMM [120], and signal sequences were identified with SignalP version 2.0
[121]. rRNAs were identified using BLASTN [116] alignment to defined rRNAs from the EMBL nucleotide database; tRNAs were identified using tRNAscan-SE [122];
stable RNAs were identified using Rfam [123].
The H. mustelae genome was visualized in circular
format using Genomeviz [124]. The input MAP file was
produced from the corresponding Artemis file. COGS
were assigned on the basis of a BLASTP comparison to
an in-house COG database. GC % and GC skew maps
were also generated in Genomeviz, with a window size
of 1000 bp, and an overlap of 500 bp between windows.
Regions of the genome likely acquired by horizontal
gene transfer were identified using the Alien Hunter
algorithm [125] which works by finding local compositional biases based on a variable-order motif distributions method [125].
Motif searches, for detecting conserved motifs
upstream of highly expressed genes, were performed
using MEME [126], searching positions -40 to -200 of
start codons. If the intergenic region was less that 40 nt,
the downstream ORF in question was considered to be
part of a operon and the intergenic region upstream of
the first gene in the operon was selected for analysis.
MEME was instructed to search the given strand (coding strand) for motifs between 6 and 50 bp in length
and only on the coding strand. The MEME statistical
parameter zoops (Zero or one Occurrence per
Sequence) was set in the run command. Only motifs
with an E value of <0.001 were considered relevant
[126]. Weblogos summarizing the consensus motifs
were derived using MEME. The E-value of a motif was
defined as the number of motifs as good as or better
than the motif in question which would appear in a random set of sequences the same size as the training set.
The P-value is the probability that a random string will
have the same score as the current one, and is thus an
indication of the degree of similarity a string has to the
consensus.
Comparative genomics

Outer membrane protein phylogeny was investigated by
first aligning a combined dataset of H. pylori 26695 and
H. mustelae predicted OMPs in MUSCLE [127], using
the phylogeny.fr web server [128]. The aligned
sequences were then used to construct a maximum

O’Toole et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/164

likelihood phylogeny with Phyml [129]. Branch support
values were calculated using the Approximate Likelihood Ratio test or aLRT) [130].
Sequence data for the in silico analyses were obtained
from the NCBI reference sequences (RefSeq) for the circularized genomes of Helicobacter hepaticus ATCC 51449
(NC_004917), H. pylori 26695 (NC_000915), Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 (NC_002163), Wolinella succinogenes DSM 1740 (NC_005090) and
Thermotoga maritima MSB8 (NC_000853) and for the
incomplete genome sequences of C. upsaliensis RM3195
(AAFJ01000001), C. lari RM2100 (NC_012039) and C. coli
RM2228 (AFL01000001). Proteome sets consisted of the
translated gene sequences of respective complete or
incomplete genomes.
Whole genomes were aligned using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [131]. Full genome sequence comparisons were performed using the BLAST program
bl2seq. Comparisons were done at protein level with an
e-value cut-off of 1E-08. Blast results were parsed with
MSPcrunch and the resulting files visualized with ACT.
In order to improve the visualization of synteny in the
graphical alignments, the start regions of the H. pylori
and H. hepaticus genome sequences were shifted to the
beginning of their corresponding dnaA genes.
Proteome sets derived from respective complete or
incomplete annotated bacterial genomes were compared
pairwise, and all-against-all using BLASTP [116]. Our
working definition of orthology was protein sequences
that reciprocally shared more than 30% sequence identity using BLASTP over at least 80% of total sequence
length, so that sets of pair-wise and all-against-all orthologs were obtained, correspondingly. The former set was
used to build a pairwise comparison matrix, where the
lower triangle indicates the total number of orthologs in
genome-genome comparisons while the upper triangle
shows the average sequence identity values expressed in
percentage.
For the consensus tree, each of the 212 protein
sequences were aligned using ClustalW, their best protein model of evolution was chosen, and a maximum
likelihood tree was built for each protein set using Multiphyl [132]. Using these trees, a final consensus tree
was built using the option ConsensusNetwork with a
threshold of 0.33 using the Edge Weights mean option.
To construct the concatenated phylogenomic tree, the
212amino acid sequences were concatenated for each
organism. The resulting final sequences were aligned
using Mafft v6.240 [133] with the option “auto”. Columns in the resulting alignment with gaps in more than
50% of the sequences were deleted using Gblocks [134]
in order to avoid poorly aligned positions and divergent
regions. Using these sequences, a maximum likelihood

Page 19 of 24

tree was built using Phyml 3.0 [129] with default values
and a bootstrap of 100 replicates. The resulting tree was
visualized using TreeView [135], and in both consensus
and concatenated trees T. maritima was used as an outgroup.
Protein extraction and quantification

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole,
UK) with the exception of mass spectrometry grade
water and acetonitrile, which were purchased from
Romil (Cambridge, UK) and trypsin, which was purchased from Promega (Southampton, UK).
Bacterial cells were harvested from CBA plates into
phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS; Sigma, Dorset,
UK) and cell numbers were adjusted by the addition of
PBS to obtain absorbance values of 0.5 (600 nm), determined by viable count to be equivalent to 4 × 108 CFU
ml-1. A 20 ml volume of each cell suspension was centrifuged at 8,600 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Cell pellets were
weighed and resuspended in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.8) at
ratios of 1 g cells to 2 ml buffer. The cells were then
broken using sonication as described previously by Graham et al. [136]. The soluble proteome fraction was isolated by centrifugation of the homogenate at 25,000 × g
for 30 min at 3-5°C (Beckman J2-HS, Beckman Instruments, CA, USA) followed by ultracentrifugation at
150,000 × g for 2 hours at 3-5°C (Beckman L8-M, Beckman Instruments, CA, USA) to sediment insoluble fractions. Supernatant fractions were decanted and stored in
1 ml aliquots at -70°C until required. The insoluble fractions were weighed and resuspended in 2% SDS in PBS
at ratios of 1 g cells to 2 ml buffer, treated in for 45
mins at 4°C, and then also stored in 100 μl aliquots at
-70°C until required.
One Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis

Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay [137] and aliquots of supernatant and insoluble fractions were added to 10 μL Tris-Glycine SDS
sample loading buffer (Invitrogen, Renfrewshire, UK),
made up to 40 μl with dH2O, and boiled for 5 min. The
samples (20 μL; 100 μg total protein) were loaded onto
a 1 mm thick Nu-Page 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen,
Renfrewshire, UK). SeeBlue™ Plus 2 (Invitrogen,
Renfrewshire, UK) was used as a protein molecular
mass marker. The gel was electrophoresed, using MES
SDS running buffer, in an X-Cell II mini gel system
(Invitrogen, Renfrewshire, UK) at 200 V, 120 mA, 25 W
per gel for 35 min. Proteins were visualised using SimplyBlue™ Safestain (Invitrogen, Renfrewshire, UK). The
entire lane was excised from the gel and cut into eight
fractions based on molecular mass as previously
described by Graham et al. [138,139]

O’Toole et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:164
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/164

In-Gel Tryptic Digestion

Excised gel fractions were washed for 30 min in 200
mM NH4 HCO3 , pH 7.8 at 37°C. These fractions were
then dehydrated by incubation for 30 min in 200 mM
NH4HCO3 pH 7.8/MeCN (4:6 v/v) at 37°C, followed by
rehydration for 30 min in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 at
37°C. Following incubation in 100% acetonitrile for 2
min, 0.1 μg trypsin in 50 mM NH 4HCO3, pH 7.8 was
added to each sample, which was then incubated overnight at 37°C. The supernatant was subsequently recovered into microcentrifuge tubes and a second peptide
extraction from these gel pieces was carried out (0.1%
TFA in 60% acetonitrile for 5 min). Peptide-containing
liquid fractions were pooled, dried under vacuum and
re-suspended in 20 μL 0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile prior to storage at -70°C until required.
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometric Analysis
(LC-MS)

Mass spectrometry was performed using a 3200
Q-TRAP Hybrid ESI Quadropole linear ion trap
mass spectrometer, ESI-Q-q-Qlinear ion trap-MS/MS
(Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Toronto, Canada)
with a nanospray interface, coupled with an online Ultimate 3000 nanoflow liquid chromatography system
(Dionex/LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). A
μ-Precolumn™ Cartridge (300 μm × 5 mm, 5 μm particle
size) was placed prior to the C18 capillary column (75
μm × 150 mm, 3 μm particle size) to enable desalting
and filtering. Both columns contained the reversed
phase material PepMAP™ 100 (C18 silica-based) with a
100Å pore size (Dionex/LC Packings). The elution buffers used in the gradient were Buffer A (0.1% formic
acid in 2% acetonitrile) and Buffer B (0.1% formic acid
in 80% acetonitrile). The nanoLC gradient used was 60
min in length: 0 - 55% B in 45 min, 10 min at 90% B
followed by 5 min at 100% A. The flow rate of the gradient was 300 nLmin -1 . The detector mass range was
set at 400-2000 m/z. MS data acquisition was performed in positive ion mode. During MS acquisition
peptides with 2+ and 3+ charge state were selected for
fragmentation.
Database Searching, Protein Identification and
PROVALT Analysis

Protein identification was carried out using an internal
MASCOT server (version 1.9; Matrix Science, London,
UK) searching against the H. mustelae genome database.
Peptide tolerance was set at ± 2.0 Da with MS/MS tolerance set at ± 0.8 Da and the search set to allow for 1
missed cleavage, and allowed for fixed modifications of
carbamidomethylation and variable modifications of oxidation of methionine residues. In order to expedite the
curation of the identified protein list from MASCOT,

Page 20 of 24

the result files were re-analysed against an extracted
database comprising the H. mustelae file using the heuristic method known as the protein validation tool PROVALT [140]. This automated program takes large
proteomic MS datasets and reorganises them by taking
multiple MASCOT results and identifying those peptides that match. Redundant peptides are removed and
related peptides are grouped together associated with
their predicted matching protein, thus, the program dramatically reduces this portion of the curation process.
For identification purposes the minimum peptide length
was set at 6 amino acids, minimum peptide MOWSE
score was set at 10 and the minimum high quality peptide MOWSE score was set at 22. PROVALT also uses
peptide matches from a random database (in this case
the extracted H. mustelae protein database was randomised) to calculate false-discovery rates (FDR) for protein identifications as previously described by
Weatherley et al. [140]. Briefly, identifications from
searching the normal and random databases are used to
calculate the FDRs and set score thresholds and thus
identify as many ‘actual’ proteins as possible while
encountering a minimal number of false-positive protein
identifications. Rather than calculate error rates at the
peptide level, the FDR calculations employed by PROVALT provide a reasonable balance between the number of correct and incorrect protein assignments. In this
study the FDR was set at 1%, meaning that 99% of the
reported proteins identified should be correct. All
detected proteins were then quantified by utilising the
exponentially modified protein abundance index
(emPAI) [139,141,142]. This method allows the quantification of individual identified proteins by utilising database and MASCOT output information (based on
number of peptides identified), in order to give an
emPAI value http://www.matrixscience.com/help/quant_empai_help.html. The emPAI values were then be
used to estimate protein content within sample mixtures
in molar fraction percentages as previously described
[139,141,142].
