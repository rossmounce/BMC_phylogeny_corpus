Abstract
Background: The geographic and ethnolinguistic differentiation of many African Y-chromosomal lineages
provides an opportunity to evaluate human migration episodes and admixture processes, in a pancontinental context. The analysis of the paternal genetic structure of Equatorial West Africans carried out
to date leaves their origins and relationships unclear, and raises questions about the existence of major
demographic phenomena analogous to the large-scale Bantu expansions. To address this, we have analysed
the variation of 31 binary and 11 microsatellite markers on the non-recombining portion of the Y
chromosome in Guinea-Bissau samples of diverse ethnic affiliations, some not studied before.
Results: The Guinea-Bissau Y chromosome pool is characterized by low haplogroup diversity (D = 0.470,
sd 0.033), with the predominant haplogroup E3a*-M2 shared among the ethnic clusters and reaching a
maximum of 82.2% in the Mandenka people. The Felupe-Djola and Papel groups exhibit the highest
diversity of lineages and harbor the deep-rooting haplogroups A-M91, E2-M75 and E3*-PN2, typical of
Sahel's more central and eastern areas. Their genetic distinction from other groups is statistically significant
(P = 0.01) though not attributable to linguistic, geographic or religious criteria. Non sub-Saharan influences
were associated with the presence of haplogroup R1b-P25 and particular lineages of E3b1-M78.
Conclusion: The predominance and high diversity of haplogroup E3a*-M2 suggests a demographic
expansion in the equatorial western fringe, possibly supported by a local agricultural center. The paternal
pool of the Mandenka and Balanta displays evidence of a particularly marked population growth among the
Guineans, possibly reflecting the demographic effects of the agriculturalist lifestyle and their putative
relationship to the people that introduced early cultivation practices into West Africa. The paternal
background of the Felupe-Djola and Papel ethnic groups suggests a better conserved ancestral pool
deriving from East Africa, from where they have supposedly migrated in recent times. Despite the overall
homogeneity in a multiethnic sample, which contrasts with their social structure, minor clusters suggest
the imprints of multiple peoples at different timescales: traces of ancestral inhabitants in haplogroups AM91 and B-M60, today typical of hunter-gatherers; North African influence in E3b1-M78 Y chromosomes,
probably due to trans-Saharan contacts; and R1b-P25 lineages reflecting European admixture via the North
Atlantic slave trade.

Background
Many genetic studies of sub-Saharan Y chromosome variation have paid special attention to the large-scale Bantu
expansions, and the particular pool of the "relic" Central
African Pygmies and the South African Khoisan [1-7],
while little is known about the events that have shaped
the paternal structure of Equatorial West Africans.
Although anthropological evidence is scarce, the earliest
traces of West Atlantic occupation by modern humans
dates back 40 ky [8,9]. Later climatic changes, when
around 9 kya the Sahara was at its wettest [10], created
conditions for both the massive displacement of people
and the spread of agriculture, reaching previously uninhabited areas and promoting admixture with isolated
populations [11-14]. Although the farming practices in
Sahel could have started earlier than 6 kya [15,16], firm
archaeological evidence points to the domestication of
local sorghum, millet and yams ~4 kya [17]. Together
with the introduction of iron-smelting techniques ~2.7
kya, agriculture led ultimately to the large-scale Bantu
migrations from the Gulf of Guinea to the south of the
continent [18]. From the perspective of Y chromosome
genetic variation, such movements are believed to have
erased much of the pre-existing diversity, replacing it with
the now dominant haplogroup E3a-M2 lineages
[4,19,20].
The inhabitants of the Guinea-Bissau area have certainly
been under the influence of several demographic events
since prehistorical times, as a result of migratory movements, trade networks and consecutive invasions. The first
recorded influx of ethnically defined groups is the arrival
of Fulbe people in the 8th century AD, from a Central Afri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/124

can epicenter [21]. First contact with the North African
Berbers dates back to at least the 9th century, and was
repeated in the 11th century when, pushed by the
Omníades, these people came to occupy the vicinity of
Senegal [22]. The economic shift in the Sahel allowed
more centralized states to form (namely the "Black Kingdoms" in the period between the 8th and 16th centuries,
[23]), linked by a trading corridor reaching from Mauritania to Niger [18]. In the following centuries pastoral Fulbe
arrived again slowly but en masse, together with the Mandenka, and became the most prevalent people in GuineaBissau territory. Oral tradition also states that the Djola
people – Felupe-Djola, Baiote and possibly Beafada –
came from Sudan in the 15th-16th centuries [24]. As for the
Balanta, Sudanese or Bantu affinities may argue for their
cultural and phenotypic aspects. Though research on the
background of the Nalú is less advanced, Teixeira da Mota
[25] considers them to be the autochthonous people of
the region. The same author identifies Bijagós as a separated branch of Djola or relatives of Papel and Nalú. The
main ethnic groups now present in Guinea-Bissau (Figure
1; see Additional file 1) were already settled in the region
in the 15th century, at the time of arrival of the Portuguese.
With the establishment of the Atlantic slave trade the
region experienced an input of Europeans, in their vast
majority males, whose genetic imprint is undetermined.
Many of the ethnic barriers were brought down, in particular the endogamic practices, promoting an intense cultural contact and higher levels of admixture between
groups than before.
The present study intends to characterize the paternal
genetic pool of Guineans, focusing on their ethnic affilia-

tion, by the use of binary markers and microsatellites on
the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY).
Our sample (n = 282) extends significantly the Y-chromosomal coverage of West African populations (Senegal [5],
Gambia/Senegal Wolof and Mandenka [7], Mali [2] and
Dogon [7], Burkina-Faso [1,26], Ghana Ewe, Ga and
Fante [7]) both in size and number of surveyed ethnic
groups. The unique features of the Y chromosome system,
namely its haploid and non-recombining nature and
paternal inheritance, provide an opportunity to evaluate
the temporal and spatial aspects of population movements, in the light of the available non-genetic evidence.

Results and discussion
Y chromosome haplogroup variation
The fairly homogeneous paternal structure of Guinea-Bissau (D = 0.470, sd 0.033), is not surprising given the gen-

eral landscape of sub-Saharan low Y-chromosomal
haplogroup diversity [2,27] and its reported east-to-west
decline along a Central African corridor [28]. Responsibility for the low diversity is attributed to the highly frequent
E3a*-M2 and E1*-M33 lineages (72.0% and 15.6%,
respectively) that are shared among all ethnic clusters
(Figure 2). In our dataset the Mandenka harbor the highest frequency (82.2%) of the E3a*-M2 paragroup, fitting
the context of its closest neighbors (~80% in Senegalese
[5] and Gambia/Senegal Mandinka [7]). The lack of diversity of West African Y chromosomes together with the predominance of E3a*-M2 lineages (assuming a frequency
peak only equivalent to that in Central Africa; Figure 3)
reinforces its link to agricultural expansion [3,4,19,20]
and hint at the existence of a large local center of cultivation [14-16,18,29]. We hypothesized that the newly
adopted lifestyle created conditions for major demo-

graphic growth, obscuring earlier patterns of lineages.
Alternatively, a moderate farming expansion may have
occurred on a background of reduced diversity, following
the 5.5 kya savanna retreat [30] or the malarial epidemic
episodes which were an outcome of pastoral habits [31].
The lifestyle transition in West Africa was most likely promoted by people other than the Bantu, as no relevant
westwards migrations of these people are reported and
none or few Bantu languages are found in the area today.
In fact, the West African center may date earlier than that
documented for Central Africa and may have acted as a
western source of knowledge [14-16]. Based on the high
frequency and microsatellite diversity of E3a*-M2 in the
Mandenka and Balanta (Figure 2; see Additional file 2),
we suggest that these people may have experienced a particular benefit from food production. If so, this might
associate their ancestors with the people who implemented the farming habits in the Guinea-Bissau area. The
Mandenka are physically and culturally descendants of
the Mande, protagonists of agricultural population expansions in Niger/Mali/Burkina-Faso region [18] and rulers
of the West African Black Empires, based on trade and
agriculture. For the Balanta, the cultural and physical
affinities with Bantu suggest a common origin at the end
of the Pleistocene [24], so it may be that different peoples
jointly learnt the agricultural techniques. The E3a7-M191
lineages of one Fulbe and two Mandenka individuals of
Guinea-Bissau are undoubtedly representatives of a Central African lineage that followed a trajectory to the west
[2,3,5,32].

Haplogroup E1*-M33, of probable local radiation (5–7%
in Senegal and Burkina-Faso [2,3,5,7], 40.4% in Mali and
52.9% in Fulbe of Cameroon [1,26]), is surprisingly frequent in Felupe-Djola and Papel (34.0% and 20.3%).
Both ethnic groups exhibit the highest haplogroup diversity (0.5 < D < 0.6) and the deepest-rooting phylogenetic
types in our dataset – haplogroups A-M91, E2-M75 and
E3*-PN2 – some with occasional occurrences in Fulbe
and Balanta (Figure 2). These minor imprints may represent movements from Sahel's more central and eastern
parts, seen, for example, in the typically Ethiopian/Sudanese E3*-PN2 lineages that have reached Senegambia
[2,3,5]. The Djola's oral tradition claims an arrival from
Sudan in the 15th-16th centuries which is supported by
their carrying the lowest fraction of E3a* in our dataset
(58.0%). At the same time, the relatively short time of residence and/or the genetic isolation on cultural grounds
has not contributed to a greater homogeneity among the
peoples. The Papel, curiously also affiliated to the Bakspeakers, may either represent a legacy left by earlier
inhabitants of the Guinean delta, survivors of an ancient
pool through demographic reductions and expansions, or
later arrivers who have preserved a more discrete genetic
identity.
Of greater prevalence in the East quadrant of Africa and
among South African Khoisan (~12% and 15%, respectively; [2,5]) the paragroup E3b*-M35 is common to
Felupe-Djola and Papel (~2%) but is also found among
Fulbe and Mandenka (~4%). Its presence at ~2% in
Guinea-Bissau and ~5% in Senegal may also indicate
loose relationships to the North, where it is widespread at
rather low frequencies (2–4%, [1,26,33-35]. A similar scenario of Eastern prevalence and North African spread
traces the African distribution of E3b1-M78 (~26% in
Sudan and Ethiopia and 19% in NW-African Arabs), not
to mention the ~7% in the Near Eastern and European
people [1,5,26,33-35]. In Guinea-Bissau this haplogroup
attains the highest frequency so far reported for West
Africa (~4%).
The remainder of binary marker variation falls into haplogroups A, B and R, each detected at marginal frequencies
(0.4–3.9%). Clades A-M91 and B-M60, the most divergent of the haplogroups of the Y chromosome tree, are
associated with the earliest modern human diversification
and are putative markers of the first pan-African dispersals
of hunter-gatherers [2,3,7,20,36]. However, the GuineaBissau A-M91 lineages do not belong to the widespread
A3-M32 but to the A1-M31 subcluster, with reported marginal presence in Mali (2.0% [2,7]), Gambia/Senegal
Mandinka (5.1% [7]) and North African Berbers (3.1%
[1,33-35]). Any association of Balanta to the Sudanesespeakers is traceable only in the A3b2-M13 and E3* Y
chromosomes. The B-M60 variant observed in almost all

sub-Saharan collections [28] was only found in Nalú. One
other Nalú individual belongs to the rare and deep-rooting DE* paragroup described in five Nigerians [37] and
thus representing a coalescent "missing link", paraphyletic to haplogroups D and E. The two Western European R1b-P25 lineages in Fulbe and Bijagós are best
explained by recent European influence, at the time of the
slave trade. A partial introduction through North African
pastoral immigrants can not be rejected, where the 3–12%
of R1b-P25 are due to the geographic proximity and the
long reported contacts with Europe and Middle-East [33].
The European source seems nevertheless more likely:
firstly, Y chromosome signatures of European presence
have a reported great expression in the nearby Cape Verdians [38] and secondly, highly frequent North African
haplogroups that would have been equally carried by the
migrants (e.g. E3b2-M81) are absent in Guineans. The
M173 and P25 derived states in both our samples rule out
a relationship to the R1*-M173 lineage previously found
in Cameroon, Oman, Egypt and Rwanda, and adduced to
support the "Back-to-Africa" theory [3,28].
Pairwise FST analysis of haplogroup frequencies reveals the
Felupe-Djola as the only group statistically significantly
different from others, namely Bijagós (FST = 0.095, P =
0.027), Fulbe (FST = 0.081, P = 0.004) and Mandenka (FST
= 0.107, P = 0.004). The exact test of population differentiation reveals similar information, further distinguishing
Papel from Bijagós (P = 0.01), Fulbe (P = 0.003) and Mandenka (P = 0.04). These results are in agreement with principal components analysis (PCA; see below) and the
interpretation of the greater distinctiveness of the paternal
pool of Felupe-Djola and Papel among other Guineans.
PCA and AMOVA analysis
A PCA of Guinean and other African populations Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies is depicted in Figure 4a
[see Additional files 3 and 4 for population details]. The
1st PC clearly separates the Afro-Asiatic speakers from
other linguistic families, independently of their geographic location. Consistent with geographical grouping,
North and West Africans cluster in independent and
tighter groups. The coordinates of North Africans are
attributable to haplogroups E3b2-M81 and J-12f2 while
West Africans' Y chromosomes cluster largely due to E3a*M2, and E1-M33 to a lesser extent. Central and South African people are more dispersed in the plot, many lying
closer to the Eastern populations (due to the presence of
R-M207, A3-M32 and B2-M182 lineages) while others lie
closer to the Western cluster. A linguistic correlation is
hypothesized to underlie the genetic proximity of Bantuspeakers occupying different quadrants of the continent,
driven by the E3a7-M191. Guinea-Bissau groups are
included in the western cluster of populations, in close
vicinity to Gambia/Senegal Wolof and Mandinka [7] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/124

Senegalese [5] with which they share numerous population groups. It is noteworthy that the Guinea-Bissau Fulbe
show a distinct pool from other Fulbe people, namely the
ones in Burkina-Faso and Cameroon, and are integrated
within the Guinea-Bissau variation. A PCA of Guinea-Bissau ethnic groups is illustrated in Figure 4b, less biased by
the major influence of haplogroup E3a*-M2 and where
the influence of minor clusters is emphasized. The FelupeDjola and Papel have distinctive positions, largely a result
of the high frequency of haplogroup E1-M33. The Bijagós,
inhabitants of the archipelago, are placed apart in closer
relation to the mainland Fulbe. The position of Mandenka
is clearly defined by its E3a*-M2 composition.
The AMOVA yielded no statistically significant results for
ethnic group distinction on any of the defined criteria,
with ~97% of the variance occurring at the within-population level (P < 0.05; see Additional file 5). These results
suggest that in spite of obvious sociocultural differences
among groups, marked by the supposedly strict admixture
barriers, their Y chromosome gene pool remains largely
shared, because of common origin or common history of
genetic admixture without language shift.
Microsatellite haplotypes within haplogroups
Y-chromosomal microsatellites provide further haplotype
resolution, and are of particular use when, as in this case,
some haplogroups are very prevalent. The E3a*-M2 microsatellite profiles of Mandenka and Balanta are the most
diverse among our data (RST average gene diversity, see
Additional file 2) and attest to an earlier origin or more
pronounced expansion. Since the corresponding parameter in Fulbe is less diverse we consider this to signal either
a genetic bottleneck or their more recent expansion and
late arrival in the West. The data are consistent with the
less diverse E3a-M2 profile in Central and South Africans
(data not shown). Haplotypes within E3b1-M78 are supposed to represent distinct clusters of local genetic drift
[39]. The rare DYS439 allele 10 of a so-called E3b1-β cluster particularly widespread among Moroccan Arabs
defines a contribution to the Guinean Fulbe and Bijagós
from North West Africans who have crossed the Sahara.
The hypothesis of much later European contribution is
valid though the remaining variability is absent (except
for two R1b-P25 chromosomes) and none of the Guinean
haplotypes carry the A7.1 allele with size 9, characteristic
of Europe [39]. Microsatellite networks for paragroup
E3a*-M2 and haplogroup E3b1-M78 are not informative
due to multiple reticulations and the absence of a clear
haplotype sub-structure particularly associated to ethnic
groups [see Additional file 6]. Further refinement awaits
the finding of new markers especially within paragroup
E3a*-M2. The microsatellite profile of the DE* individual
is one mutational step away from the allelic state
described for Nigerians (DYS390*21, DYS388 not tested;

[37], therefore suggesting a common ancestry but not elucidating the phylogenetics.
The Fulbe E3a*-M2 extended haplotypes find exact
matches in Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Angola and
Xhosa (H61, H48, H69 [40,41]; see Additional file 7) supporting their broad distribution. The Mandenka share
E3a*-M2 variants with all other groups in Guinea-Bissau
and do not match types outside Central-West Africa
(except H67 in Mozambique), a sign of localized expansion and increased influence over their ethnic neighbors.
The Felupe-Djola, Balanta and Papel each share one microsatellite haplotype (H49, H46 and H127, respectively)
with Mozambique and Angola. Several E3a* eight-loci
profiles matched Europeans (H29, H38, H44, H30, H152,
H153 and H55), most likely descendants of incoming
slaves. Three Fulbe E3b1-M78 haplotypes (H155 and
H156) were found to match Spanish haplotypes [42] and
samples in Central Portugal, Macedonia, Romania and
Poland (YHRD database [43]). Both profiles present the
A7.1 allele 12, quite frequent in Equatorial Guinea [44].
The R1b-P25 H165 has a 10-loci haplotype found in 68
worldwide populations, of which 53 are European (nine
matches in Portugal, YHRD). The picture for H166-R1b is
quite different since on a 7-loci basis it matches four Europeans and two individuals from the Reunion Islands,
known to have a European-permeable culture.
MtDNA haplogroup variation
Comparisons between mtDNA and Y-chromosomal
diversity are hindered because of the very different mutational properties of their SNPs and Y microsatellites, and
because of SNP ascertainment bias on the Y chromosome.
Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting the results.

The maternal inheritance of Guineans is markedly West
African, with haplogroups coalescing at distinct timeframes, from the initial occupation of the area to the later
inputs of people [45]. Of relevance for comparison with
the paternal counterpart are the signatures of recent
expansion in haplogroups frequent in Senegambia,
namely haplogroups L2a-L2c, the latter displaying an
almost starlike phylogeny and being particularly frequent
in the Mandenka ([45]; Tajima's D and Fu's Fs, our
unpublished data). An intriguing increased frequency of
L0a1 in the Balanta might parallel A1-M31 and A3b2M13 Y chromosomes in representing East African traces.
Although the founder L0a1 haplotype is shared in an eastto-west corridor, the emerging lineages are exclusive of
Guineans, indicating a rapid spread and local expansion
after arrival. These may therefore reflect the arrival of their
ancestors in the Holocene (at about 7 kya, [45]). Moreover, the exact matches found between Balanta and North
Africans in haplogroups L2a, L2b and L3b may represent
evidence for their contact and long residence in the terri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/124

tory. L3e4 lineages, thought to signal the western expansion of food-production and iron-smelting, show a
moderate frequency of 8% in the Balanta. The absence of
mtDNA Bantu-markers [46-49] suggests either that Bantu
people contributed very little to the maternal gene pool of
Guineans, or that they had a different pool from that associated with the southwards migrations [45].
The widespread L3e2b is mainly a Felupe-Djola and Papel
cluster with probable links to their homeland mirrored in
exact matches with East and Central African haplotypes.
Lineages within L3h, coalescing at the late Pleistocene/
early Holocene in Guineans [45], exhibit one of the highest found frequencies among the Felupe-Djola (8%).
Their increased frequency of West African mtDNA haplogroups L2b and L3d and Y chromosome E1*-M33 could
be due to amplification in small founder groups, as these
are absent in East Africa.
The mtDNA haplotypes in Guinean Fulbe exhibit a wide
range of matches supported by their wide distribution and
massive movements in recent history (e.g. [21]). The high
frequency of L1b is otherwise a constant in the Fulbe
"world" [50]. Conversely to what is seen on the paternal
side, this is the only group that retains statistically significant differences in mtDNA lineages from its ethnic neighbors. As for the Y chromosome, the mtDNA pool of
Bijagós shows higher affinity to that of Fulbe, making less
likely any connections to the Djola, Papel or Nalú [25].
The North African mtDNA haplogroups demonstrates
partial diffusion to Sahel, namely U6 found in Fulbe and
Mandenka and M1b present in Guinea-Bissau Atlantic
Bak-speakers ([51,52]; previously referred to as M1 in
[45]). The U5b1b lineages in Fulbe and Papel are representatives of a link between the Scandinavian Saami and
the North African Berbers, emphasizing the great importance of post-glacial expansions [53]. These lineages have
most likely crossed the strait of Gibraltar and developed
into local clusters, one of which is in West Africa. They do
not seem to result from recent gene flow given that the
North African Euroasiatic haplogroups H, J and T are
absent in our sample.

Conclusion
The analysis of our data provides further evidence for the
homogeneity of the Y chromosome gene pool of subSaharan West Africans, due to the high frequency of haplogroup E3a-M2. Its frequency and diversity in West Africa
are among the highest found, suggesting an early local origin and expansion in the last 20–30 ky. Hypothesizing on
the existence of an important local agricultural centre, this
could have supported a demographic expansion, on an
E3a-M2 background, that almost erased the pre-existing Y
chromosome diversity. Its pattern of diversity within

Mandenka and Balanta hints at a more marked populational growth, these people possibly related to the local
diffusion of agricultural expertise. The Papel and FelupeDjola people retain traces of their East African relatives, to
which the short timescale of residence in Guinea-Bissau
and higher isolation from major influences have contributed. In the near absence of archaeological data, the signatures of North, Central and East Africans, traceable in less
frequent extant paternal haplogroups, fit well with the linguistic and historical evidence regarding the origin and
admixture processes of particular ethnic groups. Minor
influences of North and East Africa, in particular, are corroborated by mtDNA data.

employed to align DNA sequences. The nomenclature and
phylogenetic relationship of lineages followed the guidelines proposed by the YCC [60], referred to in the text by
the (sub)haplogroup and the terminal mutation.

Methods

Data analysis
A graphical representation of the haplogroup phylogeny
and distribution among ethnic clusters was built in netViz
6.5 [69]. Arlequin program ver. 2.000 [70] was used for
the summary statistics on both haplogroup and microsatellite haplotype frequencies for each population unit:
diversity indexes [71]; FST and RST calculation; exact test of
population differentiation (DYS385 omitted from the
analysis) [72]; AMOVA tests [73] with hierarchical clustering of the ethnic groups on geographical, linguistic and
religious criteria. PCAs were performed with the software
MSVP Version 3.13 m [74] for haplogroup frequencies of
our data and a wide selection of African populations
(units as in Figure 4; see Additional files 3 and 4), to generate a more complete picture of the African Y-haplogroup
variation and the phylogeographic relationships.

Sampling procedure
A total of 282 Guinea-Bissau unrelated healthy males
were analyzed in this survey for the Y chromosome biallelic markers. The sample constitutes a subset of that typed
for mtDNA [45] and therefore follows similar selection
criteria and DNA extraction procedures. The present data
are published as a Cape Verde source population [38] but
here samples are described by ethnic affiliation. In the
aforementioned article the authors were alerted to slight
inconsistencies in Figure 2, which are corrected in the
present work (see Figure 2), such as the missing 44 haplogroup E1*-M33 individuals. Note that discrepancies were
not due to sample mistyping but to typographical errors
in the original table.

In order to have a manageable number of units with reasonable sample size, many of the Guinean ethnic groups
were clustered: Felupe-Djola includes the homonymous
group, Baiote, Cassanga and Beafada; Papel includes
Papel, Manjaco and Mancanha; Fulbe clusters Fulbe, FutaFulbe, Fulbe-Preto and Fulbe-Forro; Mandenka joins
Mandenka, Mansonca, and Sussu; Balanta, Bijagós and
Nalú were considered independently. The clustering is not
without controversy, but follows pertinent information
related either to history, anthropology or linguistics
[24,54-59].
Typing of Y chromosome Binary and Microsatellite
Polymorphisms
The hierarchical selection of the following 31 Y chromosome binary markers according to the Y Chromosome
Consortium phylogeny [60,61] allowed the inclusion of
each Y chromosome into specific haplogroups: YAP [62],
92R7 [63], SRY4064, SRY10831 [64], P25 [65], PN2 [62],
M2, M9, M10, M13, M14, M31, M32, M33, M35, M44,
M60, M75, M78, M81, M89, M91, M116, M123, M130,
M155, M168, M173, M174 and M191 [2,20]. The typing
details of restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) and direct sequencing analysis are available from
the authors. The Wisconsin Package Version 10.0 [66] was

The microsatellite variation, previously determined for a
subset of 215 individuals [67] and newly typed for five
samples, was associated to the haplogroups. Typing methodology of microsatellites DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II,
DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385, DYS437,
DYS438 and DYS439 is published elsewhere [67]. An
additional GATA microsatellite A7.1 (DYS460 [68]) was
tested for E3b1-M35 chromosomes.

Haplotype networks of microsatellite data were drawn
using the Network 4.1.1.2 program [75]. Information on
seven microsatellites (DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II,
DYS390, DYS391, DYS392 and DYS393) was sequentially
submitted to reduced-median and median joining algorithms [76,77]. Singletons were excluded from the analysis and the threshold level of 2 was set, with weighted STR
loci [78]. The YHRD database and published sources were
consulted for exact matches of eight and ten microsatellites (minimal and extended haplotypes, respectively).
