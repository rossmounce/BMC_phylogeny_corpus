Abstract
Background: Seagrasses are a polyphyletic group of monocotyledonous angiosperms that have adapted to a
completely submerged lifestyle in marine waters. Here, we exploit two collections of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) of two wide-spread and ecologically important seagrass species, the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia
oceanica (L.) Delile and the eelgrass Zostera marina L., which have independently evolved from aquatic ancestors.
This replicated, yet independent evolutionary history facilitates the identification of traits that may have evolved in
parallel and are possible instrumental candidates for adaptation to a marine habitat.
Results: In our study, we provide the first quantitative perspective on molecular adaptations in two seagrass
species. By constructing orthologous gene clusters shared between two seagrasses (Z. marina and P. oceanica) and
eight distantly related terrestrial angiosperm species, 51 genes could be identified with detection of positive
selection along the seagrass branches of the phylogenetic tree. Characterization of these positively selected genes
using KEGG pathways and the Gene Ontology uncovered that these genes are mostly involved in translation,
metabolism, and photosynthesis.
Conclusions: These results provide first insights into which seagrass genes have diverged from their terrestrial
counterparts via an initial aquatic stage characteristic of the order and to the derived fully-marine stage
characteristic of seagrasses. We discuss how adaptive changes in these processes may have contributed to the
evolution towards an aquatic and marine existence.

Background
Lambers and co-authors summarized the uniqueness of
seagrasses as follows: “Aquatic angiosperms are perhaps
comparable to whales: They returned to the water, preserving some features of terrestrial organisms” [1]. The
monocotyledonous seagrasses represent, in fact, a polyphyletic group of plants that can live underwater in fully
marine environments. At least three independent seagrass lineages, but no other angiosperm species, have
evolved to a life in the marine environment [2,3].
Seagrasses consist of about 60 species, most of which
superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family
Poaceae in that they have long, narrow leaves and grow
in large meadows. Seagrasses belong to the order of

Alismatales which includes 11 families of aquaticfreshwater species and 4 families that are fully marine.
The marine families include the Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae, and Cymodoceaceae, and have
originated in the Cretaceous period [2]. Phylogenetic
analysis of members of the entire order, based on the
plastid gene encoding for RuBisCO large subunit [4], indicates that the return into the sea occurred at least three
times independently through parallel evolution from a
common aquatic-freshwater ancestor of terrestrial origin.
Living submerged in an aqueous environment poses
many challenges requiring physiological and morphological adaptations that are distinctive from terrestrial
angiosperms. For example, the photosynthetic apparatus
needs to be modulated to accommodate the changes in
light attenuation through the water depth [5]. Consequently, the overall light intensity is decreased and the
wavelength composition of sunlight reaching underwater
plants is different. Accordingly, seagrasses have one of

the highest light requirements among angiosperms [6,7].
One factor contributing to these high light requirements
is the reducing sediments to which seagrasses are
rooted. These sediments challenge seagrass root tissues
with anaerobic conditions since marine sediments are
often oxygen deficient. When the internal transport of
oxygen from shoot to root tissues is not sufficient, seagrasses can be forced to resort to fermentative metabolism [8,9]. Submergence also exposes organisms to the
forces of wave action and tidal currents that effects
reproductive functions and reduces the availability of
carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Consequently, seagrasses have
evolved to propagate via hydrophilous pollination [10]
and rely on carbonic acid and bicarbonate instead of
CO2 [11,12]. Specific to marine environments, seagrasses
are often exposed to high salt levels and short-term salinity fluctuations in the coastal and estuarine system
[13-15]. Increased levels of sodium (Na+) are known to
be toxic, partly due to the fact that both Na+ and potassium (K+) have very similar physicochemical properties.
Key metabolic processes in the cytoplasm such as enzymatic reactions, protein synthesis, and ribosome functions rely on K+ as a co-factor [16]. An increased level
of Na+ creates a competing environment for K+ binding
sites and thus decreases efficiency of these processes.
Moreover, detrimental effects can propagate from the
cytoplasmic compartment into the chloroplasts, leading
to a decreased efficiency of photosynthesis which in
turn impairs growth [17].
Strikingly, despite their independent evolutionary
routes, seagrasses from the three different lineages have
evolved many similar morphologies, life history strategies, and breeding systems [3,18]. This indicates that the
aquatic habitat imposes novel selection forces that can
lead to parallel evolution. For instance, most seagrass
species share a secondarily simplified morphology which
includes horizontal rhizomes and strap-like leaves originating from a basal meristem. Additionally, seagrasses
have been found to share morphological traits that distinguish them from terrestrial plants such as reduced
stamen and corolla, and elongated pollen without exine
walls [19]. Except for the genus Enhalus with above-surface pollination, all of the 60 seagrass species exhibit
true sub-aqueous pollination by means of filiforme pollen (hydrophily; [10]). This adaptation to a marine habitat is thus an example of morphological parallel
evolution [20,21].
Identifying genes and cellular processes that may have
adaptive contributions to submerged fully marine habitats is therefore of particular interest. By comparing a
group of marine angiosperms to terrestrial angiosperms,
consequences of specific selection pressures and molecular adaptations can be uncovered. In general, such phenotypic changes can be caused by both changes in gene

Page 2 of 12

expression and the primary sequence of encoded proteins. Protein sequences can be strongly conserved
whereas changes in their expression pattern can be adaptive (e.g. [22,23]). Conversely, changes in the coding
sequence of genes can modify protein structure, function,
and efficiency, and therefore can be used to identify evidence for parallel or convergent evolution as successfully
demonstrated in recent studies for sequences in plants
[24,25], monkeys [26], and fish [27,28].
In this study, the molecular evolution of an identified
set of orthologous genes through changes in the coding
sequences is investigated to identify candidate genes
that may be involved in morphological and physiological
adaptations of seagrasses. Gene expression changes as a
second mechanism of phenotypic adaptation will not be
addressed due to the limitation of the current dataset,
although intra-specific analysis of EST libraries between
heat-stressed and control treated Zostera marina has
previously been conducted [29]. Comparing orthologous
gene sequences of two seagrasses and eight terrestrial
angiosperm species allows for the inference of sequence
evolution and the statistical assessment of synonymous
(dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates, providing insights into molecular adaptation [30,31] of seagrasses. We use EST libraries which were recently
developed for two important seagrass species, the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile and the
temperate species Zostera marina L. (eelgrass). These
seagrass species are two representatives of three currently recognized independent seagrass lineages (Posidoniaceae and Zosteraceae) [4]. Using a molecular
evolution approach, the positive selection (dN/dS > 1) of
genes along branches leading to each seagrass species
was investigated to identify candidate genes in which
adaptations allowed for the transition from a terrestrial
to an aquatic - and ultimately marine - lifestyle. Estimates of evolutionary distances can be obtained from
the timetree database [32], which lists molecular
sequence studies that determined that the two seagrass
species Z. marina and P. oceanica split 72.5 to 75 million years ago [33-35] and their evolutionary distance to
the terrestrial monocots used in this study is estimated
at 131 million years [35].

Results
Construction of the dataset

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular
evolution of genes shared between seagrasses and terrestrial angiosperms following the split from the aquatic,
last common ancestor (LCA) of seagrasses from the terrestrial monocots. In order to represent two independent seagrass lineages, expressed sequence tag (EST)
data were used for Zostera marina and Posidonia oceanica. Orthologous sequences of the two seagrasses were

Wissler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/8

compared to eight terrestrial angiosperm species with a
balanced representation of monocot and dicot clades:
four monocots including Zea mays [36], Sorghum bicolor [37], Oryza sativa [38] and Brachypodium distachyon
[39]; and four dicots including Arabidopsis thaliana
[40], Populus trichocarpa [41], Medicago truncatula
[42], and Vitis vinifera [43]. Using sequences from all
species, orthologous gene clusters (with one sequence
per species) could be constructed for 189 genes. The
genomes of the moss Physcomitrella patens [44] and
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [45] were not
included in this analysis as these species have split from
higher plants roughly 600 and 900 million years ago,
respectively. Evolutionary distances of this magnitude
would have prevented accurate estimations of mutation
rates.
Detection of positive selection after the seagrass splits
from terrestrial monocots

Using a maximum likelihood framework, the sequence
evolution of each gene was evaluated along the species
tree (Figure 1A) by estimating the ratio (ω) between the
rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) in the coding sequence. The parameters used
for the analysis were set such that only the alternative
hypothesis allows for positive selection in the foreground
branch, and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) can determine
whether or not the alternative model is a significantly
betterfit to the observed sequence alignment than the
null model. To each orthologous gene cluster, the branch
site test for positive selection in CODEML (test 2, [46])
was applied, using the evolutionary model that allows for
a varying ω within the alignment and thus is sensitive
towards positive selection limited to a very small number
of sites. Testing for positive selection includes running
CODEML twice, both with model A (model = 2; NSsites
= 2) but with different constraints for the site classes (see
Materials and Methods). Three branches abbreviated Po,
Zm, and LCA (see Figure 1A) were used as foreground
branches in separate tests to identify positive selection
after the split of the two seagrass lineages from the terrestrial monocots. For each model, a likelihood score was
obtained and a LRT was performed to test for positive
selection with p < 0.05. Separate testing of the three
branches allowed for rare cases where a gene was
inferred to be positively selected in more than one
branch. Accordingly, this approach uncovered 65 cases
across 51 genes, where the branch-site test for positive
selection was significant at least once for the three tested
foreground branches (Table 1, p < 0.05).
Annotation of positively selected genes (PSGs)

Among the 189 tested genes, 51 genes were identified as
positively selected genes (PSGs). Using KEGG pathway

Page 3 of 12

information, 30 of the 51 PSGs could be associated to at
least one pathway. Metabolic pathways, ribosomes, and
photosynthesis showed the highest number of associated
genes (Table 2), indicating that several components of
these pathways have acquired sequence changes after
the split of the common ancestor of seagrasses from the
terrestrial monocots 130 MYA. For 27 of the 51 PSGs,
positive selection was inferred in the branch leading to
the last common ancestor of the two seagrass species
(branch LCA, Figure 1A). Signals of positive selection in
the LCA branch reflect either adaptation before the split
of the two seagrass lineages or parallel evolution after
their split. In the LCA branch, positive selection has
been inferred mostly for ribosomal and metabolic genes
(Table 2). Over-representation analysis of GO terms
associated with PSGs in the LCA branch revealed only
two functional gene classes significantly enriched,
including proteins interacting with calmodulin, and proteins located in the thylakoid lumen (Figure 1B).
Potential lineage-specific positive selection was also
detected for 18 and 20 PSGs in Posidonia and Zostera,
respectively (Figure 1A, Table 2). Over-representation
analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) revealed that,
within this limited sample, positive selection has acted on
different functional classes between the three branches
under investigation (Figure 1B). In the Zostera lineage, 6
PSGs were identified to be involved in the photosynthesis
pathway (ID: 00195), whereas none of these were
observed in the Posidonia lineage, suggesting that parts
of the two photosystems and the light reaction have
undergone Zostera-specfic adaptation (Table 2). Additionally, GO annotation indicates that in Zostera, positive
selection has acted on genes responsive to abiotic stimuli
and cold (Figure 1B). PSGs in Posidonia were identified
to be mostly involved in metabolic processes and biosynthetic pathways. Together, these findings indicate that
the two seagrass lineages have diverged substantially on a
molecular level despite a seemingly similar habitat. Nonetheless, many signals of positive selection found in the
LCA branch also indicate adaptive traits shared by both
lineages. These PSGs may have evolved either in their
last common ancestor or in parallel after their split.

Discussion
Positively selected genes associated with central
biological pathways

Positive selection for 51 genes was detected after the
split from terrestrial monocots based on a maximum
likelihood approach. Theoretical models based on confirmed biological data have suggested that molecular
adaptation is realized to different extents across the proteome and depends on the functional role of each individual protein [47]. In the present analysis, many of the
identified PSGs are involved in the central biological

pathways of translation, photosynthesis, and glycolysis.
These adaptations are possibly associated to the above
mentioned Na + toxicity which seagrasses have likely
experienced during their evolution towards the marine
environment. To this respect, molecular adaptation of
key cellular processes known to be sensitive towards

increased ionic levels such as photosynthesis, translation,
and selected metabolic enzymes are expected. Considering the importance of these processes for the survival of
an organism over short and evolutionary time scales, it
is not surprising to identify strong selection pressure
shaping genes which increase salt tolerance.

The available dataset allowed only for the investigation
of 189 orthologous clusters, equivalent to ~1% of the A.
thaliana genome. Since orthologous clusters include
only ESTs from both seagrasses, the presented dataset is
not an unbiased sample of the genome and is probably
enriched for genes that show significant expression
levels in both seagrass species. Nevertheless, the presented analysis was able to provide significant partial
insights into the molecular evolution of seagrasses.
While the limited size of the current dataset leaves
room for further investigations, the well described ecology of seagrasses can be utilized to discuss how these
PSGs may have contributed to seagrass adaptation to
the marine environment.
Molecular evolution for salt tolerance

A number of terrestrial lineages of plants have evolved
into aquatic-freshwater hydrophytes and a number of
morphological features are shared by both hydrophytes
and seagrasses, e.g., the presence of a diffusive boundary
layer around the leaves, a photosynthetic epidermis, loss
of stomata and the development of aerenchyma
(reviewed in [48]). Physiologically, however, seagrasses
must cope with high ion concentrations, inefficient carbon uptake and other physical coping mechanisms that
are still poorly understood. One of the questions that
has to remain open is how exactly do seagrasses deal
with the high salinity of the ocean. Seagrasses have been
found to harbor increased intracellular levels of Na+ and
K+ as compared to terrestrial angiosperm species [49] as
well as to other aquatic angiosperms [48]. In general,
salt-tolerant plants compensate osmotic and ionic
imbalances with increased K+ import and the accumulation of compatible solutes [50,51]. However, genes that
are known to facilitate salt tolerance such as the SOS
pathway [52,53] were absent from the orthologous gene
clusters and could therefore not be investigated. Thus,
the mechanism by which seagrasses achieve either a tolerance of higher salinity levels or employ active mechanisms to decrease intracellular Na + deserved further
investigation with more comprehensive sequence and
additional expression datasets.

as a consequence of anoxic conditions [54]. Hence, the
positive selection of these three glycolysis genes may be
associated with seagrass-specific adaptation to
anaerobiosis.
PSG Group 2: Ribosomal Genes

Ten PSGs were found to be ribosomal proteins involved
in translation. From an evolutionary point of view,
translation is an ancient cellular process, and high selection pressure is expected to act against deleterious
mutations, as ribosome functioning affects virtually all
cellular processes. In A. thaliana, on average four gene
copies encode for any of the approximately 80 different
ribosomal proteins [55,56]. This redundancy may reflect
the importance of maintaining highly productive translation and protein synthesis. At least three scenarios can
explain the seemingly high number of PSGs with ribosomal function: (1) Since translation is salt-sensitive, one
can hypothesize that these changes reflect salt tolerance
adaptations. The vast majority of signals of positive
selection in ribosomes were inferred in the LCA branch
so that these changes are shared by both seagrass species. Ultimately, signals of positive selection in ribosomes could be one of the traits that allowed the
transition to the marine lifestyle. (2) As ribosomes consist of a multitude of subunits, changes in only a few
proteins could cause compensatory mutations in other
ribosomal proteins to maintain structure and function
of the ribosomal complex. Such compensatory mutations were shown to occur in an E. coli mutant [57],
and would increase the number of observed changes
and overestimate the number of “adaptive changes”. (3)
Acquisition of non-ribosomal functions could explain
sequence changes in these proteins without them being
adaptive in the context of ribosomal functioning. In the
primate ribosomal protein S4, positive selection has
been shown to occur after gene duplication [58]. Andrés
et al. [58] concluded that one gene copy has acquired a
non-ribosomal function with 2 to 6 amino acid substitutions identified as positively selected sites. The three
presented scenarios are not mutually exclusive and ultimately, more experiments will be required to reveal the
nature of the inferred sequence changes.

PSG Group 1: Glycolysis

With two fructose-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes and a
malate dehydrogenase, the list of PSGs contains three
enzymes of the glycolysis pathway. This observation
may be particularly significant due to the challenges
imposed by the O2 sink created by the reductive sediment leading to compensation by internal transport of
oxygen from shoot to root tissues during the day cycle,
as mentioned above. In darkness, seagrasses can even be
forced to switch to fermentative metabolism. In P. oceanica, malate has previously been shown to accumulate

PSG Group 3: Photosynthesis and carbon fixation

Seven PSGs were related to the photosynthetic pathway
and may reflect adaptations to new conditions of carbon
fixation and photosynthesis that seagrasses had to face
after their split from a terrestrial ancestor. Fixation of
CO2 is expected to be more difficult for seagrasses since
seawater contains very little dissolved carbon dioxide.
While CO2 can readily diffuse from the air through the
stomata to the mesophyll cells in terrestrial plants, aquatic plants often have limited CO 2 diffusion rates [1].

Wissler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/8

Factors contributing to slow CO2 diffusion in aquatic
plants (and especially in seagrasses) are thick boundary
layers around the leaves that are sometimes amplified by
the presence of unicellular or multicellular photosynthetic epiphytes that compete for CO2 [59], and the low
rate of CO2 transport in water. The two seagrass species
under investigation, Z. marina and P. oceanica, are
−
known to utilize bicarbonate ( HCO 3 ) as a major source
of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis [11,12]. The abil−
ity to utilize HCO 3 could be one of the traits evolved
in the LCA branch. In contrast, a set of signals of positive selection specific to the Zostera lineage could relate
to the biochemical mechanism used in carbon fixation.
Seagrasses have long been regarded as C3 plants, but
physiological measurements have gathered indications
that several seagrass species, including Z. marina, are
C3-C4 intermediates or have various carbon-concentrating mechanisms to aid the RuBisCO enzyme in carbon
acquisition [60-63]. Finally, seagrasses are able to activate different mechanisms to cope with conditions of
light-limitation and shifted light spectrum [6,7] through
long-lasting metabolic adjustments including down-regulation of RuBisCO, enhanced proteolysis [64] and
putative changes in the antenna complex. These various
unique characteristics of seagrasses are further
supported by our results.

Conclusions
We have undertaken the first step in systematically
unraveling the molecular basis of seagrass evolution
from terrestrial ancestors to a fully marine lifestyle.
Only genes that were contained in the available seagrass
EST collections could be analyzed in this study. Consequently, the current dataset of orthologous gene clusters
for 10 angiosperm species is biased and limited in size.
Nevertheless, this study has shed light on the molecular
evolution of seagrass genes expressed under native conditions in root and leaf tissues. 51 genes showed evidence for positive selection in seagrass branches
indicating that photosynthesis, a few metabolic pathways, and ribosomes have strongly diverged after the
split of the common ancestor of seagrasses from terrestrial monocots. Further studies will need to address the
following questions: (1) How seagrasses have acquired
osmoregulatory capacity to tolerate high salinities, (2)
how CO2 is fixated, (3) how their photosynthetic apparatus has evolved for under water light harvesting, and
(4) under what conditions anaerobiosis takes place. In
this regard, comparisons with the aquatic members of
the Alismatales will be necessary to distinguish between
more general adaptations to the aquatic environment
and those that are marine-specific. Finally, the completion of the Zostera marina genome project, currently

Page 8 of 12

under way at the Joint Genome Institute (http://www.
jgi.doe.gov/), will be a milestone in providing more comprehensive datasets in the near future to further our
understanding of evolution and adaptation of seagrasses
and their aquatic relatives.

Methods
Sequence data

Gene sequences from ten angiosperm species were compared to identify genes with signs of positive selection in
seagrasses. The two seagrass species Zostera marina and
Posidonia oceanica were represented by expressed
sequence tag data. Protein-coding sequences from the
genomes of eight terrestrial angiosperm species were
used to contrast the seagrass sequences. These species
included Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon, Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus
trichocarpa, Medicago truncatula, and Vitis vinifera. In
the seagrass ESTs representing putative transcript
sequences, open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted
based on significant BLASTX matches [65] to protein
sequences of the other eight angiosperm species (E <
1e-5). Two sequence datasets were constructed: one containing protein sequences, and another one for the protein coding sequences (CDS). For more information on
the EST sequences and how the libraries were built can
be found in [66].
Orthologous gene clusters

Using the protein sequences of the ten species, orthologous gene clusters were constructed with OrthoMCL
[67] using default settings. Only clusters with at least
one sequence per species were used in our analysis. If
more than one sequence of any species was contained
in an OrthoMCL cluster, all sequences of that species
were removed except for the one sequence that showed
the highest similarity to all other sequences of the cluster as assessed with T-Coffee [68]. For each 1:1 ortholog
cluster (see Additional file 1), multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the protein and coding sequences
were constructed. First, protein sequences were aligned
with MUSCLE [69] (see Additional file 2). Second,
PAL2NAL [70] was applied to align the CDS codonwise, guided by the protein MSA as a reference (see
Additional file 3).
Test for positive selection

CODEML from the PAML package [71] (v4.3) was used
to identify genes under positive selection using a codonbased maximum likelihood method [72]. The phylogenetic relationships between the 10 tested taxa were
obtained from NCBI Taxonomy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Taxonomy/) and used as reference tree. To test

Wissler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/8

a foreground branch for positive selection, CODEML
was run twice, both with model A (model = 2; NSsites
= 2) but with different constraints for the site classes
as described for test 2 [46]. Model A requires branches
in the tree to belong to either foreground or background branch category, where only foreground
lineages are allowed to have experienced positive selection (ω > 0). Four classes of sites are assumed in
model A: (1) class 0 codons are conserved through the
tree, with 0 ¡ ω 0 < 1; (2) class 1 codons evolve neutrally with ω1 = 1; (3) class 2a and (4) class 2b codons
differ in their selection mode between foreground and
background branches. In background branches, 2a
codons are conserved with 0 <ω 0 < 1, and 2b codons
are neutral with ω 1 = 1. In foreground branches and
the null hypothesis run, 2a and 2b codons evolve neutrally with fixed ω2 = 1. In foreground branches under
the alternative hypothesis, 2a and 2b codons are positively selected with each ω2 > 1. In separate runs, each
of the three branches Zm, Po, and LCA were marked
as foreground branches and the branch site test for
positive selection was applied (see Additional file 4).
Positive selection was inferred if the LRT between the
scores of the models corresponding to the null and the
alternative hypothesis was < 0.05. The p-values were
not adjusted for multiple testing for two reasons. First,
the presented dataset is relatively small, and given a
5% error rate, only about 3 false positives are to be
expected among the 65 significant cases of positive
selection. Second, lowering the p-value cutoff makes
the test for positive selection a lot more conservative,
dismissing genes where positive selection is limited to
a very small number of residues.
GeneOntology and KEGG pathway annotation

The A. thaliana ortholog of each cluster was used to
associate additional annotation to the whole ortholog
cluster. First, GeneOntology (GO) annotation [73]
was obtained for Arabidopsis thaliana from http://
www.geneontology.org/. Both filtered and unfiltered
gene associations of A. thaliana (8 Dec 2009 version)
were pooled. From these pooled annotations, only
non-redundant mappings to genes from the newest
Arabidopsis genome release (TAIR9) were kept. Based
on the Arabidopsis ortholog contained in each cluster,
GO terms were mapped to PSGs. The R package
topGO [74] was used to test enrichment of GO annotation terms in these PSGs, using all tested orthologous clusters as reference (see Additional file 5).
Enrichment was assessed by Fisher Exact tests as
implemented in topGO’s classic algorithm treating
each GO term as an independent unit. Second, A.
thaliana KEGG pathway annotation [75] was obtained
from ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genes/organisms/
