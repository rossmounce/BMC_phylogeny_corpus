Abstract
Background: Most bacterial chromosomes exhibit asymmetry of base composition with respect
to leading vs. lagging strands (GC and AT skews). These skews reflect mainly those in protein
coding sequences, which are driven by asymmetric mutation pressures during replication and
transcription (notably asymmetric cytosine deamination) plus subsequent selection for preferred
structures, signals, amino acid or codons. The transcription-associated effects but not the
replication-associated effects contribute to the overall skews through the uneven distribution of
the coding sequences on the leading and lagging strands.
Results: Analysis of 185 representative bacterial chromosomes showed diverse and characteristic
patterns of skews among different clades. The base composition skews in the coding sequences
were used to derive quantitatively the effect of replication-driven mutation plus subsequent
selection ('replication-associated pressure', RAP), and the effect of transcription-driven mutation
plus subsequent selection at translation level ('transcription-associate pressure', TAP). While
different clades exhibit distinct patterns of RAP and TAP, RAP is absent or nearly absent in some
bacteria, but TAP is present in all. The selection pressure at the translation level is evident in all
bacteria based on the analysis of the skews at the three codon positions. Contribution of
asymmetric cytosine deamination was found to be weak to TAP in most phyla, and strong to RAP
in all the Proteobacteria but weak in most of the Firmicutes. This possibly reflects the differences
in their chromosomal replication machineries. A strong negative correlation between TAP and
G+C content and between TAP and chromosomal size were also revealed.
Conclusion: The study reveals the diverse mutation and selection forces associated with
replication and transcription in various groups of bacteria that shape the distinct patterns of base
composition skews in the chromosomes during evolution. Some closely relative species with
distinct base composition parameters are uncovered in this study, which also provides
opportunities for comparative bioinformatic and genetic investigations to uncover the underlying
principles for mutation and selection.

Background
A genome contains coding information that specifies pro-

tein and RNA sequences and structural information that
specifies local DNA conformation involved in interacPage 1 of 16

tions with proteins. On top of these is the subtle global
tendency of a genome to move toward a preferred nucleotide composition and distribution that are characteristic
for each clade. Most notable is the G+C content, which
vary widely (between 25% to 72%) among the prokaryotes. The preferred G+C content is conserved among closely
related species, as are the relative abundance of dinucleotides, trinucleotides, and tetranucleotides [for review, [14]].
In addition, in most bacterial chromosomes, mononucleotides exhibit a biased distribution between the two replicating (leading vs. lagging) strands. GC skew, as expressed
by (G-C)/(G+C), and AT skew, expressed by (A-T)/(A+T),
of bacterial chromosomes were first noticed by Lobry [5]
in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophillus influenzae, and later by Mrazek and Karlin [6] in Mycoplasma
genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori.
It was noticed that GC skews (and, to lesser extent, AT
skews) exhibit a striking sign switch at the replication origin (oriC) and another one at the termination region in
many bacterial chromosomes. From an analysis of a limited number (9 to 36) of bacterial chromosomes, it has
been proposed that there is an overall excess of purines
('purine excess') or keto bases G and T ('keto excess') in
the protein coding sequences (CDS) [7-9]. These base
composition skews have been recently reviewed [10-12].
The composition skew may be extended to include a
number of oligomer sequences, which are known to be or
are likely to be implicated in replication, recombination,
and/or repair process of genomes [13,14]. A classical
example is the octameric Chi sequence (CGTGGTGG) in
E. coli, which serves as a signal for recombinational repair
of double strand breaks, and is important to the rescuing
of broken replication forks [[15] for a concise review].
Another example is the Rag motif (RGNAGGGS) in the E.
coli chromosome, the skew of which shift abruptly at the
terminus of replication [13,16]. Chi and Rag motifs
together account for about 7% of the global GC skew of
the E. coli chromosome [14].
Base composition skews are shaped by asymmetric accumulation of specific mutations, which are determined at
two levels, namely strand-biased mutation and subsequent selection [reviewed in [11,17]]. These strand-biased
mutation forces may be further classified into two basic
categories: replication-driven mutation and transcriptiondriven mutation. Several mechanisms of replicationdriven mutation have been proposed based on the asymmetrical structures of the replication forks [reviewed in
[12]], including higher abundance of single-stranded gaps
and nicks on the lagging strands that are prone to mismatch repair and cytosine deamination (leading to C-T
transition) [10,18] and asymmetrical enzyme machiner-

ies that replicate the leading and lagging strands. Transcription-driven mutation has been proposed to include
mutations associated with exposed non-transcribed
strands during transcription and transcription-coupled
repair [19]. The non-coding sequence (non-CDS) is under
replication-related mutation pressure, and free from selection at the translation level. However, the transcribed
non-CDS (upstream or downstream from the CDS) is still
under transcription-driven mutation. The CDS, on the
other hand, is affected by replication-driven mutation and
transcription-driven mutation plus selection at the translation level.
These mutations undergo various kinds of selection,
including the shaping of the signal sequences on the chromosomes [14] (see above). A universal and powerful
selection is at the translation level, in which adverse mutations are eliminated or selected against. In addition,
codon usage and amino acid usage preferences in combination also select optimal mutations at this level. The facts
that codons usage in bacteria shows a preference for G
over C (a translational selection) and that more genes (up
to about 80% in some Gram-positive bacteria) are located
on the leading strands than on the lagging strands of most
bacterial chromosomes [20] automatically lead to G
excess in the leading strands [21,22]. Moreover, selection
pressure at the translation level may also produce biases
in the usage of nucleotides, codons, and amino acids [2327]. It has been noted that orthologs on the leading
strands show lower rates of divergence than those on the
lagging strands among various bacteria; this is a reflection
of lower mutation pressure on the leading strand [28]. In
many cases, these strand biases are considerable, and may
be used to predict the replicating strand location of particular CDS with surprising accuracy [27].
The effect of mutations and subsequent selections on base
composition skews cannot be readily separated in analysis. In general, the combined effect of replication-driven
mutation plus subsequent selection is treated collectively
as 'replication-associated pressure' (RAP), and the combined effect of transcription-driven mutation plus subsequent selection at the translation level as 'transcriptionassociate pressure' (TAP). While RAP is directly reflected
in the overall skew, the effect of TAP depends on relative
distribution of the CDS on the two replicating strands. If
CDS are equally distributed between the leading and lagging strands, the effect of TAP on base composition skews
is nil, and if CDS are present exclusively on one replicating
strand, the TAP effect is total.
The TAP effect exerted on CDS on either replicating strand
is equal, whereas the RAP effect has an opposite directionality on CDS on two replicating strands. Thus, the base
composition skews of CDS on the two replicating strands

may be used to extract the effects of RAP and TAP. This
general principle has been applied by Lobry and Sueoka
[29] to detect and assess RAP and TAP in 43 bacterial chromosomes using a graphic approach. These graphically
deduced RAP and TAP were for GC and AT skews combined together. It was concluded that these two forces
were most evident in the weakly selected third codon
position and in intergenic regions. The authors noted that
the directions of the two effects are almost universal (with
some exceptions), resulting in G and T excess in the leading strands, which was compatible with the hypothesis of
excess of cytosine deamination in the single-stranded state
during DNA replication [11]. In fact the authors modeled
their analysis based on C-T transitions and attributed any
non-conformity to the effect of TAP.
In this study, using the same general principle but with a
more comprehensive mathematical approach, we evaluated the RAP and TAP for GC skews and AT skews in 185
bacterial chromosomes from 11 phyla. The results show
diverse and distinct RAP and TAP patterns among different families of the bacterial chromosomes, and each GC
and AT skew-shaping force may be very different. While
all the chromosomes are under significant TAP, a portion
of them is under no or little RAP. Some bacteria (e.g., Firmicutes and proteobacteria) exhibit high RAP and high
TAP, some (e.g., Chlamydiae) exhibit only significant RAP
and little or no TAP, and a few (e.g., Cyanobacteria)
exhibit none of either. Analysis of the RAP and TAP shows
that the cytosine deamination may be important for RAP
in some bacteria such as proteobacteria, but not in TAP.
Instead, there appears to be significant involvement of
transversion in the generation of base composition skews.
Our study shows that chromosomes that exhibit high base
composition skews generally possess high TAP and RAP.
Moreover, the trends and magnitudes of the skews can be
correlated to the size and G+C contents of the chromosomes. This is in line with the notion that the base composition skews and their underlying mechanisms are
important to the shaping of the bacterial chromosomes
during evolution.

In order to assign the leading and lagging strands, the replication origin (oriC) and termination (ter) must be
defined. oriC of only a few bacterial chromosomes has
been experimentally determined. For the remaining
majority, prediction of oriC has been based on several different parameters. For examples, Worning et al. [30] predicted the location of oriC using biased distribution of all
oligonucleotides up to 8 bp, and Mackiewicz et al. [31]
use three criteria â composition skew, location of dnaA
gene, and distribution of DnaA box-like sequences â for
oriC prediction. Here we have followed the basic method
of Mackiewicz et al. [31] to predict oriC. Ninety-nine bacterial chromosomes with a predicted oriC were taken from
Mackiewicz et al. [31]. From the available complete bacterial sequences, oriC was predicted for another 86 chromosomes. For circular chromosomes, the ter site was assigned
to be directly opposite to oriC. For linear chromosomes,
the ends are where replication terminates. In total, a total
of 185 chromosomes representing 11 phyla [see Additional file 1] were included in this study. Of these bacteria,
the largest Phyla are Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in
many of the analyses, they were further subdivided into
Classes. The sizes of the chromosomes ranged from 0.6 to
9.1 Mb (mean 3.4 Mb), and their G+C contents from 24
to 72% (mean 49 %).

ÏG and ÏA were calculated from the sequence of the 185
bacterial chromosomes. ÏG is statistically significant (p <
10-3, Ï2 test) for all except 12 bacteria, and ÏA are significant statistically (p < 10-2, Ï2 test) for all except 17 bacteria
[see Additional file 1]. These exceptions include four of
the five Cyanobacteria tested.
Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of ÏG vs. ÏA for the bacterial
chromosomes. Interestingly, while the ÏA values spread
from about -0.10 to 0.12, the ÏG values are mostly positive, ranging from -0.04 to about 0.24. The prevalence of
positive ÏG values for most bacterial chromosomes is consistent with previous observations that G is more abundant in the leading strand of most bacterial chromosomes
[12]. Only two Actinobacteria (Figure 1, white circles) and
three Îµ-Proteobacteria (red circles) exhibited statistically
significant negative ÏG values.

Results

ÏG vs. ÏA: Clustering of related chromosomes
The overall base composition skews with respect to leading strands vs. lagging strands over the whole bacterial
chromosome are designated ÏG (for GC skew) and ÏA (for
AT skew). ÏG is defined as the total number of G minus
the total number of C divided by the total number of G
and C on the leading strands, and ÏA is defined as the
total number of A minus the total number of T divided by
the total number of A and T on the leading strands.

In the plot, related bacterial chromosomes tend to cluster
together. For example, the Firmicute chromosomes (green
symbols) are essentially all distributed in Quadrant I.
Within the Firmicutes, members of the same Class also
cluster together. Most other bacterial chromosomes are
distributed in Quadrant II. Within Quadrant II, clustering
is also seen for proteobacteria (red symbols) and its
Classes. This is in accordance with the notion that the base
distribution skews are evolutionally conserved.

CDS is susceptible to both RAP and TAP. Non-CDS is
more complicated in that it contains both non-transcribed and transcribed regions (stable RNA genes and
transcribed regions upstream and downstream of genes).
The non-transcribed part is susceptible to RAP only, and
the transcribed part is susceptible to both RAP and TAP
(but without translation pressure). Unless transcription
maps in non-CDS is available, it is impossible to investigate the components that shape the skews in non-CDS. In
contrast, CDSs provide a simpler model for extraction of
information regarding the operations of RAP and TAP in
this
study.

Scatter-plot analysis of base composition skews â ÏG vs. ÏA
Figure 1
Scatter-plot analysis of base composition skews â ÏG
vs. ÏA. The ÏG values and ÏA values of 185 bacterial chromosomes are plotted against each other. The symbols for
the 19 groups of bacterial chromosomes (1â19) are listed on
the right. The 'Keto Excess' and the 'Purine Excess' trends in
Quadrant I and II are indicated.

ÏG vs. ÏA: Two trends of distributions
The ÏG vs. ÏA plot also shows a general trend for the absolute values of these two values to increase in proportion (r
= 0.72). From the denser central area, the chromosomes
diverge in two general directions, one toward simultaneously increasing ÏG and ÏA, and the other toward increasing ÏG but decreasing ÏA. The former corresponds to
'purine excess' in the leading strand as noted by Freeman
et al. [8] for nine bacterial chromosomes. Most of the
chromosomes in this trend lie in Quadrant I, and belong
to Firmicutes and also F. nucleatum. Of these, the
clostridia chromosomes (green inverted triangles) have
the highest ÏA and ÏG values. The other trend, in which
ÏG varies in inverse proportion with ÏA, corresponds to
'keto excess' trend also noted by Freeman et al. [8]. Most
of these chromosomes lie mainly in Quadrant II, but a few
are in Quadrant IV. That related bacteria have the similar
strengths of keto and purine excesses has also been noted
by Song et al. [9] for 36 species examined.
Base composition skews deviate more in non-CDS
For subsequent analysis, we separate the genome
sequences into CDS (protein-coding sequences) and nonCDS (the remaining sequences). CDS constitutes the
major portion of the bacterial chromosomes. In the 185
chromosomes investigated, the fractions of CDS range
from 50.9% (Sodalis glossinidius) to 95.5% (Candidatus
Pelagibacter ubique) with a mean of 86.2%.

Thus, we break down ÏG and ÏA into those in the CDS
(ÏGcd, ÏAcd), and those in the non-CDS (ÏGnc, ÏAnc). The
scatter chart comparison (Figure 2, filled circles) shows
that, for most chromosomes, ÏGcd and ÏAcd are nearly
identical to ÏG and ÏA, respectively (mean differences of
2 Ã 10-3 for both). This is not surprising, since CDS constitute the majority of bacterial genomes.
In contrast, ÏGnc and ÏAnc deviate noticeably more widely
from ÏG and ÏA, respectively, for most bacterial chromosomes (Figure 2, open circles). Most (87%) of the ÏGnc values are higher than the corresponding ÏG values with a
mean difference of 2 Ã 10-2. In contrast, ÏAnc is higher than
the corresponding ÏA in only about 37% of the bacteria
regardless of their phylogenetic groups. The deviations of
skews in the non-CDS and the CDS presumably reflect the
difference in the mutation pressures and selection pressures exerted on these sequences, which are expected to be
lower in non-CDS.
RAP and TAP are estimated from base composition skews
in the CDS
The base composition skews in the CDS may be used to
estimate RAP and TAP under the assumption that the
effects of the two forces are independent of each other.
This assumption is reasonable, because, considering the
relatively low magnitude of the base composition skews,
it is very unlikely that any nucleotide position is simultaneously affected by RAP and TAP.

The GC skew in the CDS on the leading strand (designated ÏGd) and on the lagging strand (designated ÏGg)
may be represented, respectively, as:

ÏGd = ÏGT + ÏGR
ÏGg = ÏGT - ÏGR
where ÏGT and ÏGR are GC skews shaped by TAP and RAP
in CDS, respectively.
From these, ÏGT and ÏGR may be derived as:

Similarly, the AT skews generated by TAP (i.e., ÏAT) and
RAP (i.e., ÏAR) may be derived from AT skews in the CDS
on the leading (i.e., ÏAd) and lagging strand (i.e., ÏAg) as:

ÏAT = (ÏAd + ÏAg)/2

(3)

ÏAR = (ÏAd - ÏAg)/2

(4)

It is noteworthy that ÏGd - ÏGg and ÏAd - ÏAg correspond
to 'ÎGC skew' and 'ÎAT skew', respectively, described by
Rocha and Danchin [32], which are defined as the difference between the average skews of the genes in the leading
strand and those in the lagging strand.
Patterns of base composition skew-shaping RAP and TAP
among bacterial families
With the above equations, the base composition skews in
CDS and the RAP and TAP effects for the 185 bacterial
chromosomes were derived (Figure 3). ÏGd is statistically
significant (p < 10-2, Ï2 test) in all bacterial chromosomes
except for five [see Additional file 1], and ÏGg is significant
in all except twelve. ÏAd is significant in all except thirteen,
and ÏAg is significant in all except thirteen [see Additional
file 1]. Statistically insignificant ÏGg and ÏAg values, however, should not necessarily be taken as an indication of a
lack of a TAP on the base composition skews in CDS on
the lagging strand (CDSg), but may reflect effect of the
counteracting of RAP on the skews in these bacteria.

Different phyla exhibit distinct patterns of skews in base
compositions and CDS (ÏCDS; see below), and within the
same phylum different species tend to exhibit similar patterns. For example, the Firmicute chromosomes (Groups
9â12) have the highest ÏCDS, ÏGcd, and ÏAcd. In contrast,
the Cyanobacterial chromosomes (Group 7) have essentially no ÏCDS, ÏGcd, or ÏAcd. Most phyla also display distinct patterns associated with the calculated effects of RAP
and TAP on the base composition skews. Most strikingly,
the Spirochaete chromosomes (Group 19) have large and
approximately equal ÏGT and ÏGR values, together with
large ÏAT and ÏAR values of opposite signs. In contrast, all
these values are nearly zero in Actinobacterial chromosomes (Group 2).
To assess the general effects of RAP and TAP in seven larger
phyla, their averaged ÏGT, ÏGR, ÏAT, and ÏAR values are
calculated and listed in Table 1. From the list, some general trends may be seen. The ÏGT averages are very small
(â¤ 0.005) and vary widely in three phyla (Actinobacteria,
Chlorobi, and Deinococcus-Thurmus), but are relatively
large in the other four phyla, particularly in the Spirochaetes (0.096) and Firmicutes (0.075). The ÏGR averages are
positive in all seven phyla and range from 0.001 (Cyanobacteria) to 0.096 (Spirochaetes). Therefore, it appears
that there is a general trend of bias toward G excess for
both RAP and TAP in most of the bacteria.
The ÏAT averages are positive in all the phyla
(0.001~0.067) except in Cyanobacteria (-0.011). In contrast, the ÏAR averages are negative (-0.012~-0.075) in five
of the seven major phyla and near zero in the other two
(Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes). Therefore, TAP is gener-

slightly. The mean of errors is 3 Ã 10-4 Â± 6 Ã 10-4 (S. D.) for
ÏGcd, and 2 Ã 10-4 Â± 2 Ã 10-4 (S. D.) for ÏAcd.

The effect of TAP depends on ÏCDS
ÏGcd may be quantitatively presented as:

Equations (5) and (6) bring in the third main factor in
determining the base composition skews in the CDS of
bacterial chromosomes, ÏCDS. The ÏCDS values vary
between -0.15 to 0.74 with a mean of 0.23 among the 185
bacterial chromosomes. When ÏCDS approaches zero
(equal distribution of CDS on the replicating strands), the
skews are contributed to by RAP only.

Similarly,

Equations (5) and (6) are based on the assumptions that
(i) the TAP effect (ÏGT and (ÏAT) is equal on the leading
and lagging strands, and (ii) the RAP and TAP effects are
independent. Such assumptions are supported by the
results of Tillier and Collins [22] in their analysis of 12
bacterial species. Moreover, ÏGcd and ÏAcd values calcu-

The Firmicutes have the highest ÏCDS (0.11~0.74),
which, in combination with moderately high ÏGR and
ÏAR values, produce the highest ÏGcd and ÏAcd among all
the bacterial groups (Figure 3). The high ÏCDS values in
the Firmicutes have been noted to be associated with the
presence of a polC gene in the genome [33]: Chromosome
containing both polC and dnaE have an average ÏCDS of
0.78, whereas for chromosomes containing only dnaE
have an average ÏCDS of 0.58. The reason for this correlation is not clear.
Both TAP and RAP correlate positively with ÏGcd and ÏAcd
The relative contributions of RAP and TAP to the base
composition skews in the CDS were compared by plotting
ÏGcd and ÏAcd against ÏGR, ÏGT, and ÏCDSÂ·ÏGT, and
against ÏAR, ÏAT, and ÏCDSÂ·ÏAT, respectively (Figure 4;
Table 2). ÏGcd is strongly correlated to ÏGR (r = 0.88), and

the linear regression line intersects the axes near the origin
with a slope of 0.54. ÏGcd is only moderately correlated
with ÏGT (r = 0.64), but is strongly correlated with
ÏCDSÂ·ÏGT (r = 0.84) as expected. The ÏGcd vs. ÏCDSÂ·ÏGT
regression line also intersects near the origin, and the
slope of this line is 0.45.

CDS, and therefore the RAP and TAP on the two groups of
sequences cannot be separately evaluated from Figure 4.
The RAP and TAP trend analysis disfavors the cytosine
deamination model
The RAP and TAP analysis may be used to examine the
cytosine deamination model [27,34,35], which proposes
that base composition skew is generated by preferred
deamination of cytosine in single-stranded DNA such as
the lagging strands during replication and the sense
strands during transcription [18,36]. If strand-biased cytosine deamination plays a major role in shaping base composition skews during replication and transcription, the
result of C to T transition would be reflected as a negative
correlation between ÏGR and ÏAR and between ÏGT and
ÏAT, respectively.

Similarly, ÏAcd is also strongly correlated to ÏAR (r = 0.85).
The linear regression line for ÏAcd vs. ÏAR passes near the
origin, and has also a slope of 0.60. ÏAcd is weakly correlated with ÏAT (r = 0.49), but is strongly correlated with
ÏCDSÂ·ÏAT (r = 0.72) as expected. The ÏAcd vs. ÏCDSÂ·ÏAT
linear regression line also intersect near the origin with a
slope of 0.40.
These results indicate that the relative contribution to
either ÏAcd or ÏGcd by RAP and TAP (after ÏCDS attenuation) is approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, across
the bacterial spectrum. These average values, however, are
not good reflections of RAP and TAP in individual species,
which may deviate from these average ratios significantly.

Correlation analysis between these forces with a weight
adjustment for different G+C contents in the 185 chromosomes is shown in Figure 5. The analysis shows a weak
negative correlation between weight-adjusted ÏGR and ÏAR
(m = -0.29, r = 0.34, p < 0.01; left panel). For individual
clades, negative correlation is strong in the Î±-, Î²-, and Î³Proteobacteria (m = -0.46~-0.64, r = -0.68~-0.87, p <
0.01), moderate in the Îµ-Proteobacteria (m = -0.65, r = 0.74; p = 0.06), and insignificant in the Î´-Proteobacteria
(p = 0.15). Of all the Firmicutes, only the Mollicutes
shows a (negative) significant correlation (m = -1.43, r = 0.68, p = 0.02). No significant correlation exists in other
phyla, which, in some cases (e.g., Î´-Proteobacteria) is due
to the small sample size. Therefore, the cytosine deamination model appears to be only applicable to RAP in the
Proteobacteria (except Î´-Proteobacteria) and the Mollicutes.

The skews in the non-CDS is more correlated to RAP than
to TAP
Regression analysis of the effect of RAP and TAP on the
base composition skews in the non-CDS (Figure 4) shows
that ÏGnc and ÏAnc are not only strongly correlated with
ÏGR (r = 0.88) and ÏAR (r = 0.86), respectively, but also
moderately correlated to ÏGT (r = 0.51) and ÏAT (r = 0.34),
respectively, and moderately correlated to ÏCDSÂ·ÏGT (r =
0.72) and ÏCDSÂ·ÏAT (r = 0.49), respectively. The latter
two sets of correlation presumably are due to the presence
of transcribed sequences in the set of non-CDS, which
would be under transcription-driven pressure, but not
translation-driven pressure. The transcribed non-CDS
cannot be readily separated from the non-transcribe non-

A weak positive correlation was seen between weightadjusted ÏGT and ÏAT in the 185 chromosomes (m = 0.42,

phyla shows only significant positive correlations (m =
0.97~2.01, r = 0.75~0.94, p ranging from < 0.01 to 0.05)
in Î±-Proteobacteria and Îµ-Proteobacteria, and Clostridia
in Firmicutes. No significant correlation exists in other
phyla, which, in some cases, is due to the small sample
size. The lack of negative correlation here indicates that
the cytosine deamination model does not play a major
role in shaping TAP in most if not all bacteria.
RAP at three codon positions reveals lacks of RAP in some
bacteria
The three positions of codons are under different selection
pressures at the translation level. The third position is 4way or 2-way degenerate for most amino acids, and enjoys
the largest freedom for synonymous substitutions. The
G+C content of a bacterial chromosome is principally
shaped by the G+C content at this position [37,38]. The
G+C content of the other two positions correlate only
weakly with the G+C content of the chromosome, but still
exhibit biased preference for different bases: a significant
overrepresentation of G and underrepresentation of T at
the first position and overrepresentation of A and T and
underrepresentation of G at the second position. In our
tabulation of the 185 bacterial chromosomes, frequencies
of occurrence are 0.35 and 0.17 of G and T, respectively,

Figure 5
Examination of cytosine deamination effect

chromosomes. The symbols are as in Figure 1.

at the first position, 0.30, 0.30, and 0.17 of A, T, and G,
respectively, at the second position. These biases constitute part of the selection at the level of translation.
We investigated RAP and TAP at the three codon positions
in all the bacterial chromosomes. The plots of ÏGR and
ÏAR at these positions against the overall ÏGR and ÏAR
(Figure 6, top two panels) showed strong linear correlation between them (r = 0.86~0.98). The ÏGR and ÏAR
effects (reflecting RAP involved in GC and AT skews) are
the strongest at the third codon position as expected. The
effect is significantly lower at the other two positions.
Notably the three trend lines intersect at the origin, indicating that some bacteria possess nearly no overall ÏGR
and ÏAR as well as ÏGR and ÏAR at all three positions. This
means that, for these bacteria, there is very little or no
RAP.
TAP at three codon positions reveals omnipresence of TAP
in all bacterial chromosomes
In contrast, in the plots of ÏGT and ÏAT at the three positions against the overall ÏGT and ÏAT, none of the three
linear trend lines intersect at the origin (Figure 6, bottom
two panels). Even for the bacterial chromosomes that
exhibit no or little overall ÏGT and ÏAT, their ÏGT and ÏAT
values at the three codon positions are far from zero. In
these chromosomes, TAP is all positive on the first codon
position, but is cancelled out by the negative effect on the
other two positions. The lack of any all-zero case indicates
the presence of considerable TAP in all the bacterial chromosomes.

In the ÏAT correlation plot (bottom right panel), all three
positions exhibit a moderately strong linear correlation (r
= 0.55~0.79). The all positive ÏAT values at the first position presumably reflect the underrepresentation of T (by
32%) at this position (see above).

depicted.

The ÏGT correlation plot (bottom left panel) showed the
strongest TAP effect at the first and third positions (r =
0.82, 0.82). The strong correlation at the more relaxed
third position is expected. The strong and all positive
effect at the first codon may be attributed to the selection
for overrepresentation (by 60%) of G at that position in
all the bacteria. There is essentially no correlation (r = 0.08) at the second position. ÏGT at the second position is
negative regardless of the overall ÏGT, presumably reflecting the underrepresentation (by 32%) of G at this position.

G+C content is strongly correlated with base composition
skew
Examining the skews and other parameters of the 185
chromosomes (Figure 3) revealed a number of exceptional cases that exhibit skew patterns atypical for the particular clade. Interestingly, these atypical skews are
accompanied by atypical G+C contents. For example, the
six species of Rickettsiales (three Rickettsia species, two Wolbachia species, and Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique; chromosome 101~106) display atypical skews parameters
among the Î±-proteobacteria. They also stand out in this
clade as displaying unusually low G+C contents
(29.0â35.2% vs. an average of 61.5%). Moreover, two
closely related spirochaetes, Treponema denticola and
Treponema pallidum (chromosome number 184 and 185)
differ greatly in skew parameters as well as G+C contents.

To investigate the correlation between the G+C contents
and the skew parameters, the G+C content of the bacteria
was plotted against the skew parameters (Figure 7A). The
results show that G+C content is strongly and inversely
correlated with ÏGT (r = -0.77), but loosely and inversely
correlated with ÏGR (r = -0.40). ÏGcd also shows an inverse
correlation with G+C content (r = -0.58). These inverse
correlations are most evident in the Actinobacteria (whitefilled circles) and Proteobacteria (red symbols), but are
looser in Firmicutes (green symbols).
G+C content is strongly and inversely correlated with ÏAT
(r = -0.71) but not with ÏAR (r = -0.09; p > 0.05). ÏAcd is
only weakly and inversely correlated with G+C content (r
= 0.40). G+C content is also loosely correlated with the
size of the bacterial chromosomes (r = 0.55; data not
shown) as previously noted [39]. Therefore, correlation
between the chromosomal size and the skew parameters
were also examined (Figure 7B). The analysis shows an
insignificant correlation between the chromosomal size
and ÏGR (r = -0.12) and ÏAR (r = -0.12), but a weak negative correlation between the chromosomal size and ÏGT (r
= -0.33) and ÏAT (r = -0.35).
There appears to be a general trend toward decreasing
magnitudes of the skew parameters with increasing chromosome size. The GC skew parameters converge from
positive values toward zero; whereas the AT skew parameters converge from positive and negative values toward
zero. This seems to suggest that larger bacterial chromosomes are under lower RAP and TAP.

Discussion
Omnipresence of TAP
The present study of the base composition skews reveals
widely variable patterns of skews as well as the underlying
shaping forces, suggesting extensive diversification of the
mutation and selection spectra during evolution of the
bacterial chromosomes. Analyzing base substitutions
between orthologs in 33 closely related strains in 6 clades,
Rocha et al. [40] have previously reached similar conclusions. Based on this, these authors proposed that the skew
shaping process is multifactorial. The same conclusion
may be drawn from the current study.

The RAP and TAP analysis at the three codon positions
(Figure 6) reveals interesting contrasts between the two.
Most remarkable is the omnipresence of TAP, in contrast
to the absence of RAP in portions of the bacteria. The analysis also shows that TAP is (at least partly) contributed by
selection pressure at the translational level that generates
the biased base composition at the first two codon posi-

tions. It implies that the apparent lack of TAP in some bacterial chromosomes does not reflect the absence of it, but
rather cancellation among the effect on the three positions.
Comparison with previous studies
The basic principle of deducing RAP and TAP by comparison of base composition skews in the CDS on the two
replicating strands used in this study is similar to that
employed by Mackiewicz et al. [26] and Lobry and Sueoka
[29].

Mackiewicz et al. [26] performed 'detrended DNA walks'
on seven bacterial chromosomes, which displayed base
composition skews on a two-dimensional plot. DNA
walks on nucleotides in the CDS on two complementary
strands of the chromosomes were added or subtracted.
Addition of the skews would cancel the effect of RAP, thus
revealing other mutation and selection effect (essentially
equivalent to RAP). Subtraction, on the other hand,

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:286

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/286

would cancel the effect of TAP, and leaving RAP. The subtraction (RAP) curve would exhibit a sign switch whereas
the addition (TAP) curve would exhibit a maximum and
minimum at the origin and terminus of replication. The
results of such analyses were available for the chromosomes of B. subtilis [26] and B. burgdorferi [41].
In their analysis of 43 bacterial chromosomes, Lobry and
Sueoka [29] plotted GC and AT skews at the third codon
positions on the two replicating strands against each other
(Figure 8), from which RAP and TAP were derived graphically. The presence of RAP separates these skews on the
leading and lagging strands into two distinct groups, and
the distance between the centers (averages) of the two
groups (Figure 7A, line BI) is taken to represent RAP. The
authors assumed that, in the absence of TAP, BI would
intercept the midpoint (0.5, 0.5) (Figure 8A), and that a
deviation from that (Figure 8B, line BII) would represent
TAP.

It is noteworthy that the relative RAP and TAP thus
deduced were for both GC and AT skews combined. They
may further be broken down into RAP and TAP specific
for GC and AT skews by applying vector analysis, i.e., RAP
for GC and AT skews corresponding to y1 - y2 and x1 - x2,
respectively (Figure 8A); and 'TAP' for GC and AT skews
corresponding to yc - 0.5 and xc - 0.5, respectively (Figure
8B). By applying this method on the original data of
Lobry and Sueoka [29], we extracted relative RAP and TAP
values from 32 bacterial chromosomes that are included
in our study, and compare them to those derived mathematically in this study. Correlation is very high (r = 0.96
and 0.97, respectively) between their and our RAP values
for both GC and AT skews. Correlation is also very high (r
= 0.96) between their and our TAP values for AT skews,
but slightly lower (r = 0.83) for GC skews.

strands, thus pushing BI away from the midpoint (0.5, 0.5). The relative strength of TAP corresponds to BII (arrow), the distance
between BI and the midpoint. Modified from Lobry and Sueoka [29].

all bacteria. This suggests that, if the model is applicable,
the exposed single strands during replication and during
transcription may differ in length, binding proteins (e.g.,
single-strand binding proteins), and other characteristics.
Our conclusion appears to be different from previous
studies that favor the cytosine deamination model for TAP
[for example, [27,34,35]]. However, the previous studies
are based on investigation of a small number of actively
transcribed genes from Proteobacteria. For example, the
conclusion of Francino and Ochman [34] was based a
phylogenic comparison of an approximately 1.8-kb
actively transcribed non-CDS in 12 E. coli strains. The E.
coli chromosomes (No. 80~83) in the present study
exhibit very low or statistically insignificant ÏA and ÏAT,
but moderate ÏG and ÏGT, indicating a lack of a major
contribution by cytosine deamination.
It is noteworthy that the number of bacterial genes highly
expressed during exponential growth appears to be relatively small [42,43], and, there is evidence for the absence
of cytosine deamination effect in the transcription of cryptic genes [35]. Thus, it is possible that either the small
sample in the previous studies is not representative for
chromosomes as a whole, or that the previously postulated cytosine deamination effect on TAP acts only on a
small number of highly expressed genes, and represents
only a minor fraction of overall TAP.
On the other hand, our analysis shows that cytosine
deamination may play a significant role in RAP in Î±-, Î²-,
Î³-, and (to a lesser degree) Îµ-Proteobacteria, and Mollicutes. This is in general agreement with the base substitution analysis of Rocha et al. [40], which shows cytosine
deamination is applicable in RAP in Bordetella (Î²-Proteobacteria), E. coli (Î³-Proteobacteria), Neisseria (Î²-Proteobacteria), and Streptococcus (Firmicutes), but not in,
Bacillus and Staphylococcus (two Firmicute clades), and
Rickettsia (Î±-Proteobacteria). The latter, being intracellular parasites, may be considered an exceptional case.
In contrast to the situation in Proteobacteria, cytosine
deamination cannot be applicable to RAP in most Firmicutes (except Mollicutes). This suggests a major difference
in the state of single-stranded DNA exposed during replication in these two phyla of bacteria. In Proteobacteria,
both strands of the chromosomes are replicated by DnaE.
In contrast, the Firmicute genomes encode an additional
replicase PolC [33], which is known to replicate the leading strand in B. subtilis [44]. Perhaps the two distinct systems generate single-stranded intermediates of very
different states.
The distinctly different cytosine deamination effects
between these two phyla of bacteria correspond to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/286

separation of the base composition skews into the 'purine
excess' trend in the Firmicutes and 'keto excess' trend in
the Proteobacteria (Figure 1). The cytosine deamination
model has been found to be the most likely cause of TAP
in other studies [12,32]. However, the sample size (28)
was considerably smaller than that in this study, and no
clade-based analysis was performed.
Skews and G+C content
In this study we found weak or no correlation between
G+C content of the chromosomes and RAP on base composition skews, but a relatively strong negative correlation
between G+C content and TAP on both GC and AT skews
(Figure 6A). This is in line with the facts that the chromosomes with low G+C contents are mainly those of Firmicutes, and that the TAPs for both GC and AT skews (ÏGT
and ÏAT) are highest in the Firmicute phylum (Figure 3;
Table 1). The TAPs may also be analyzed by examining the
relationship between G+C content and base composition
in CDSs in the bacterial chromosomes (Figure 9), which
shows that the G and C contents or A and T contents in
CDSs do not vary in the same proportion to the G+C content of the chromosomes. At lower G+C contents, there is
a distinct bias toward more Gs than Cs and more As than
Ts (i.e., more purines than pyrimidine) in CDS on both
replicating strands. At higher G+C contents, the trends are
reversed albeit with lower deviations from the norms.
These four biased trend lines correspond to the TAPs, and
are highly correlated with G+C content (r > 0.97). This is
in accordance with the linear correlation between ÏGT or
ÏAT and G+C content (Figure 6B).
Chromosomal sizes and skews
Because of the positive (albeit loose) correlation between
the G+C content and size of bacterial chromosomes [39],
it is not surprising to find that there is also a weak negative
correlation between the chromosomal size and the TAPs
(ÏGT and ÏAT; Figure 6B). However, there is an under-representation of larger bacterial chromosomes in the current
set of sequenced genomes. It is possible that the convergence towards zero skews, TAPs, and RAPs observed in the
larger chromosomes (Figure 6B) may be due to the small
sample of large chromosomes. This remains to be investigated when more large bacterial chromosomes are
sequenced.

On the other hand, the diminishing skews, TAPs, and
RAPs in large chromosomes may be real and reflect an
evolutional trend. It is reasonable to assume that the
larger chromosomes have generally evolved from smaller
ones (except for reductive evolution in parasites) by
acquiring extra genes necessary for more complex structures (through differentiation) and contingency functions
(e.g., secondary metabolism) that provide adaptability
and a competition edge. Under this premise, the increase

chromosomes, and the chromosomes of two spirochaetes, T. denticola and T. pallidum (number 184 and 185)
that differ greatly in G+C contents and ÏAT (opposite
signs). Moreover, the chromosomes of Moorella thermoacetica and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (number 55 and
56) are also unique among the Clostridia in displaying
atypically low ÏGcd, ÏAcd, ÏGT, and ÏAT. All these provide
opportunities for comparative investigation to uncover
the underlying genetic elements.

Conclusion
In summary we have analyzed the base composition
skews and the underlying mutation/selection forces associated with replication and transcription among 185 bacterial chromosomes in 11 phyla. The diverse patterns that

evolution that shape these skews. The correlation among
the skews, the G+C content, and the size of the chromosomes also hints at the direction of the trends of the evolution.

Correlation between G+C content and base composition of CDSs. The contents of four nucleotides in CDSd
(upper panel) and CDSg (lower panel) in the 185 bacterial
chromosomes are computed and plotted against their C+C

in gene number (and chromosomal size) is accompanied
by an increase in G+C content and decrease in RAP, TAP,
and base composition skews. If such an evolution trend is
real, it suggests that RAP and TAP were stronger among
ancestral bacteria.
The RAP and TAP analysis in this study may provide guidance for further bioinformatic and genetic investigations
into the underlying principles for these mutation and
selection forces. The best candidates for such investigations are probably closely relative species with distinct
base composition parameters, such as the aforementioned Rickettsiales chromosomes (number 101 â 106),
which display remarkably low G+C contents and high
ÏGR, ÏGT, and ÏAT compared to other Î±-proteobacterial

Genomic sequences and assignment of oriC and ter sites
The chromosomal sequences were taken from National
Center for Biotechnology Information []. Prediction of the
oriC location followed the basic procedure of Mackiewicz
et al. [31] using two methods: (i) DNA asymmetry (i.e.,
sign switch site of either GC or AT skew) and (ii) location
of dnaA gene. A putative oriC was assigned at the first base
of dnaA, when the locations predicted by these two methods were within 7% of the length of the chromosome.
Chromosomes with more than one dnaA homologs were
excluded. The ter site was assigned to be directly opposite
of oriC for circular chromosomes. For linear chromosomes (such as those of Streptomyces and Borrelia), the
ends are the ter sites.
Definitions and conventions
A, T, G, and C denote the numbers of these nucleotides in
the sequence or replicon under consideration. Their locations on the leading and lagging strands are denoted by
subscript d and g, respectively. Overall base composition
skews with respect to the leading and lagging strands in a

bacterial chromosome are designated with the symbol Ï,
Gd â Gg Gd â Cd
ÏG =
=
and defined by
and
Gd + Gg Gd + Cd

A chromosomal sequence is divided into two super sets,
CDS and non-CDS. CDS represent all the protein coding
sequences, and non-CDS the rest of the sequences

The base composition skew in CDS is denoted by the symbol Ï. Combined with the replicating strand designations,
ÏGd and ÏGg denote GC skews in the CDS on the leading
and lagging strands, respectively. ÏAd and ÏAg are similarly
defined.

ÏCDS, a measure of the skew of distribution of CDSs with
respect to the replicating strands, is defined as:
CDSd â CDSg CDSd â CDSg
Ï CDS =

CDSd + CDSg

The statistical significance of the calculated skews was estimated by binomial distribution probability and a Ï2 test.
Data charting and statistic analysis
The processed data were charted and statistically analyzed
using Aabel (version 2.1, Gigawiz) running under Mac OS
X (version 10.4.8) on a PowerMac (Apple).
