Abstract
The inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are
involved in immune evasion mechanisms for several pathogens causing chronic infections. Blockade of the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway restores anti-virus immune responses, with concomitant reduction in viral load. In a previous report,
we showed that, in bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, the expression of bovine PD-1 is closely associated with
disease progression. However, the functions of bovine PD-L1 are still unknown. To investigate the role of PD-L1 in
BLV infection, we identified the bovine PD-L1 gene, and examined PD-L1 expression in BLV-infected cattle in
comparison with uninfected cattle. The deduced amino acid sequence of bovine PD-L1 shows high homology to
the human and mouse PD-L1. The proportion of PD-L1 positive cells, especially among B cells, was upregulated in
cattle with the late stage of the disease compared to cattle at the aleukemic infection stage or uninfected cattle.
The proportion of PD-L1 positive cells correlated positively with prediction markers for the progression of the
disease such as leukocyte number, virus load and virus titer whilst on the contrary, it inversely correlated with the
degree of interferon-gamma expression. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in vitro by PD-L1-specific antibody
upregulated the production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, and correspondingly, downregulated the BLV
provirus load and the proportion of BLV-gp51 expressing cells. These data suggest that PD-L1 induces
immunoinhibition in disease progressed cattle during chronic BLV infection. Therefore, PD-L1 would be a potential
target for developing immunotherapies against BLV infection.
Introduction
The immune response to bovine leukemia virus (BLV)
in cattle is an important factor to determine the outcome of BLV infection. BLV is a B-cell tropic virus that
is genetically closely related to human T-cell leukemia
virus-1 (HTLV-1). The majority of BLV-infected cattle
are clinically inapparent, and are referred to as asymptomatic or aleukemic (AL). A small fraction of the latently
infected individuals develop the disease characterized by
persistent lymphocytosis (PL) and B cell lymphoma.
During BLV-infection especially at the PL and

lymphoma stage, T-cell dysfunction including, impaired
cell proliferation and cytokine production characterized
by the down-regulation of Th1 cytokines, accelerates the
disease progression through mechanisms yet to be elucidated [1-3].
An immunoinhibitory receptor programmed death-1
(PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) are involved in immune dysfunction in several
chronic infections and cancers [4,5]. In particular, recent
in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the importance
of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in retroviral infections,
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1
and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). PD-1 and
PD-L1, whose expression is upregulated on CD4+ and
CD8 + T cells specific for HIV [6,7] and HTLV-1 [8],

negatively regulate T-cell activation through the inhibition of a T cell receptor signal. Moreover, blocking of
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by antibodies specific to PD-1
or PD-L1 has been shown to restore T cell function
during HIV and HTLV infection in vitro [6,8,9]. Interestingly, in the SIV model for potential immunotherapy,
the viral load was significantly reduced by the inoculation of anti PD-1 antibody in vivo [10,11]. These findings indicated that high expression of PD-1 and PD-L1
in retrovirus infection leads to T cell dysfunction, suggesting that the reinvigoration of immune dysfunction
has a potential for application in clinical immunotherapy
against these chronic infections.
To determine the contribution of the PD-1/PD-L1
pathway to immune dysfunction caused by several
domesticated animal diseases such as BLV, we have previously cloned bovine PD-1 and shown that the expression profiles of PD-1 in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are
closely associated with BLV-induced lymphoma [12].
However, the dynamics and functions of PD-L1 in disease progression during BLV infection remain unknown.
In this study, in an attempt to determine whether the
PD-1/PD-L1 system promotes the BLV-induced immunosuppression, we cloned, sequenced and characterized
the cDNA encoding bovine PD-L1, and subsequently
measured the expression levels of bovine PD-L1 in
BLV-infected cattle at different disease stages. We also
investigated the effects of blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 by
anti-PD-L1 antibody on BLV infection.

Materials and methods
Cell preparation, subset isolation and depletion

Bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were purified from heparinized venous blood of healthy
Holstein-Friesian and Japanese Black breed, maintained
at the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, by density gradient centrifugation on
Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ,
USA). CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, CD5+ cell and CD14+
monocyte populations were isolated from PBMC using
the BD IMag™ Cell Separation System (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the following antibodies:
CACT138A (mouse anti-bovine CD4: VMRD, WA,
USA), IL-A51 (mouse anti-bovine CD8: a gift from
International Livestock Research Institute), CACT105A
(mouse anti-bovine CD5: VMRD) and CAM36A (mouse
anti-bovine CD14: VMRD), respectively. T cell subsets
(CD4+, CD8+, CD3+) were depleted from PBMC using
the following antibodies: CACT138A, IL-A51 and
MM1A (mouse anti-bovine CD3: VMRD). The purity of
each cell population was confirmed by EPICS XL flowcytometry system (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA,
USA) with the EPICS EXPO32 ADC software (Beckman
Coulter). Highly purified cells (> 90%) were used for the

Page 2 of 15

analysis of the PD-L1 expression and T cell-depleted
PBMC (< 5%) were used for the PD-L1 blockade assay.
Cloning of full length cDNA encoding bovine PD-L1 and
sequence analysis

To induce PD-L1 expression, PBMC were incubated at
37°C for 4 h with 5% CO2 in the presence of 5 μg/mL
concanavalinA (ConA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Total RNA was extracted from cultivated PBMC
using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
residual DNA was removed from the RNA samples by
treatment with Deoxyribonuclease I (Invitorogen).
cDNA was synthesized from the RNA samples using
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Takara, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. 3’- and 5’- rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) were performed using the 3’-/5’- RACE
System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen) with PD-L1 gene-specific primers, 5’-ACG TGT
CAG GCT GAG GGT TAC CCT GAA GC-3’ and 5’GTC ACA TTT TTC TAC ATC-3’. After obtaining the
5’- and 3’-end sequences, we designed new primers, 5’ATG AGG ATA TAT AGT GTC TT-3’, and 5’-TTA
CGT CTC CTC AAA CTG T-3’, and performed PCR to
clone the full length bovine PD-L1 cDNA. The resulting
amplification products were cloned into the pGEM-T
Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and
sequenced using CEQ2000 DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). The established sequences were aligned,
and an unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed
with the Mega 4 software [13].
Expression analysis of bovine PD-L1 mRNA by
quantitative real-time PCR

To investigate the expression levels of PD-L1 mRNA,
RNA samples were extracted from purified CD4+, CD8+,
CD5+, CD14+ cells and PBMC incubated for 18 h in the
presence of either anti-bovine CD3 antibody (0.2 μg/mL,
MM1A, VMRD) or ConA (5 μg/mL). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA samples as described above. Quantitative RT real-time PCR was performed using the
LightCycler 480 system II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cDNA template was mixed with 10 μL
of SYBR Premix DimerEraser (Takara) and 0.6 μL each
of primers (10 pmol/μL) in a total volume of 20 μL. Primers used were 5’-GGG GGT TTA CTG TTG CTT
GA-3’ and 5’-GCC ACCT CAG GAC TTG GTG AT-3’
for bovine PD-L1, and 5’-CGC ACC ACT GGC ATT
GTC AT-3’ and 5’-TCC AAG GCG ACG TAG CAG
AG.-3’ for b-actin. The cycling conditions consisted of
initial template denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, followed by
the amplification of template for 45 cycles of 95°C 5 s,

Ikebuchi et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:103
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/103

60°C 30 s and 72°C 30 s. A final melting curve analysis
was performed from 65 to 95°C at the rate of 0.1°C/s
(continuous acquisition), with the final cooling to 40°C
for 10 s. Each amplification procedure was done in triplicate, and the results of PD-L1 mRNA expression are
presented as a ratio obtained by dividing the concentration of the PD-L1 mRNA by that of the b-actin mRNA.
BLV-infection diagnosis

Blood samples from Japanese black, Holstein-Friesian
and First filial of Japanese black/Holstein-Friesian were
investigated. All of the cattle from which the blood samples were obtained had been diagnosed with BLV-infection at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Graduate
School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University,
between 2008 and 2010. Genomic DNA was extracted
from whole blood using the Wizard™ Genomic DNA
Purification kit (Promega). The concentration of purified
genomic DNA was measured at OD of 260 nm, and the
DNA samples were stored at 4°C until use. BLV infection was tested by nested-PCR to amplify the BLV long
terminal region (LTR) using primer pairs BLV-LTR1 5’TGT ATG AAA GAT CAT GCC GAC-3’ and BLVLTR533 5’-AAT TGT TTG CCG GTC TCT-3’ for the
initial PCR, and BLV-LTR256 5’-GAG CTC TCT TGC
TCC CGA GAC-3’ and BLV-LTR453 5’-GAA ACA
AAC GCG GGT GCA AGC CAG-3’ for the second
PCR. The conditions for both of the PCR were incubations at 94°C for 5 min, followed by amplification of
template for 35 cycles of 94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s and 72°C
30 s with the final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The provirus load was further confirmed by real-time PCR using
a LightCycler 480 system II, with SYBR Premix DimerEraser and primers, BLV-LTR256 and BLV-LTR453 for
BLV, and 5’-ACA CAA CTG TGT TCA CTA GC-3’
and 5’-CAA CTT CAT CCA CGT TCA CC-3’ for
bovine b-globin, as described previously [14]. 100% provirus load corresponded to each PBMC having one copy
of BLV provirus. Furthermore, the virus titers were
quantified based on the number of syncytia formed by
isolated PBMC co-cultured with a mouse sarcoma virustransformed (cc81) feline cell line. The syncytium formation assay was conducted according to the procedure
described previously [2]. The 1 × 105 cc81 cell line was
grown with 5 × 105 PBMC from BLV-infected animals
for 72 h in a 24-well plate (Corning, NY, USA) with
RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mmol L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The
confluent cells were then fixed in methanol for 30 min
and stained with 10% Giemsa solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 30 min. All samples were tested in
triplicate and the data are presented as the mean numbers of syncytia.

To investigate the degree of immunosuppression in
cattle, interferon (IFN)-g mRNA was quantified by quantitative RT real-time PCR as described above. The primers used were 5’-ATA ACC AGG TCA TTC AAA
GG-3’ and 5’-ATT CTG ACT TCT CTT CCG CT-3’.
Cattle with lymphoma were diagnosed clinically, and
confirmed by microscopic and histological examinations.
Other BLV-positive animals were classified as AL or PL
based on the amount of leukocytes and the percentage
of B-cells in their whole blood as described previously
[15].
Flow cytometry analysis

To analyze the cells expressing PD-L1, single- and dualcolor flow cytometric analysis was performed using the
following antibodies; CACT105A (mouse anti-bovine
CD5), BIG73A (mouse anti-bovine IgM, VMRD) and H130 (rabbit anti-human PD-L1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) as previously described [16].
Purified PBMC (1 × 107 cells/mL) were incubated with
the optimal concentration of each antibody for 40 min
at 4°C. Then, the cells were washed with PBS containing
EDTA (0.5 mg/mL) and stained with either FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) or PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beckman Coulter). Rabbit
IgG isotype control (Beckman Coulter) and normal
mouse serum were used as isotype controls. Fluorescence of the cells was measured on an EPICS XL flowcytometry system (Beckman Coulter), and the data were
analyzed using the EPICS EXPO32 ADC software (Beckman Coulter).
PD-L1 blockade assay

For PD-L1 blockade, PBMC and T cell-depleted PBMC
from BLV-infected cattle (4 × 106 cells/well in 24-well
plates) were cultured at 37°C for 18 h (for cytokine
mRNA expression analysis) or 72 h (for the evaluation
of inhibitory effects on virus propagation) with ConA (5
μg/mL) in the presence of either 10 μg/mL rabbit antihuman PD-L1 antibody or rabbit IgG isotype control.
To quantify anti-viral factors, interleukin (IL)-2 and
IFN-g mRNA expressions were analyzed in bovine
PBMC cultivated for 12~18 h by real-time PCR using
primers, 5’-TTT TAC GTG CCC AA GGT TAA-3’ and
5’-CGT TTA CTG TTG CAT CAT CA-3’ for IL-2, and
5’-ATA ACC AGG TCA TTC AAA GG-3’ and 5’-ATT
CTG ACT TCT CTT CCG CT-3’ for IFN-g. RNA
extraction from the cells, cDNA synthesis and real-time
quantitative RT-PCR were conducted as described previously [2]. To examine the influence of the PD-L1
blockade on virus propagation, 72 h-cultivated bovine
PBMC were harvested and total DNA was extracted
from the cells. Provirus load was measured using realtime PCR as described above. And after 48 h cultivation,

Ikebuchi et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:103

BLV-gp51+ cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using
the BLV1 (mouse anti-BLV envelope protein gp51,
VMRD). The data are indicated as relative ratio to control treated with only ConA.
Statistics

Spearman rank-correlation, one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s post test and Wilcoxon matched pairs test were
performed using GraphPad Prism version5.0. P-values of
less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Sequence analysis of bovine PD-L1

To clone the bovine PD-L1 gene, total RNA isolated
from bovine PBMC was used to synthesize total cDNA
from which the full-length sequence of bovine PD-L1
cDNA was generated by 5’- and 3’- RACE. The fulllength bovine PD-L1 cDNA sequence and its putative
amino acid sequence obtained from the Holstein breed
is shown in Figure 1a [GenBank: AB510902]. The complete nucleotide sequence was 1 352 bp in length, and
contained 60 nucleotides upstream of the initial ATG
codon and 422 nucleotides downstream of the stopcodon. The polyadenylation site was located at 13 bases
upstream of the poly A tail. The PD-L1 cDNA sequence
derived from Japanese Black breed cattle was found to
be identical to that obtained from Holstein breed cattle
(Table 1). In comparison to other artiodactyls species,
the predicted amino acid sequence of bovine PD-L1 was
found to be most similar (99.0%) to that of water buffalo. The bovine PD-L1 had amino acid identities of
92.0%, 89.3%, 85.2%, 83.4%, 80.7% and 52.1% to the pig,
horse, human, monkey, mouse and chicken PD-L1,
respectively (Table 1). Sequence analysis of bovine PDL1 shows that the amino acid residues 1 to 24 represent
a putative signal peptide, and that the residues 238 to
259 represent the transmembrane domain (Figure 1b).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that vertebrate PD-L1 was
divided into two groups, mammalian (Primate, Rodentia,
Carnivora and Artiodactyla) and avian groups, with
bovine PD-L1 clustering in the artiodactyl species group
(Figure 1c).
Comparative analysis of PD-L1 expression in various
bovine PBMC-derived cell types

In order to investigate the expression levels of bovine
PD-L1 mRNA, we used real-time PCR to quantify the
expression of bovine PD-L1 mRNA in PBMC. Firstly, we
evaluated the expression levels of bovine PD-L1 mRNA
in several cell types among PBMC (mean ± SD: 50.67 ±
12.63) from healthy cattle (Figure 2a). Among the
PBMC cell subsets, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA in
CD14+ cells (238.0 ± 239.5), which are representative of

Page 4 of 15

monocytes, was higher than that in CD5+ cells (the T
cells and B-1 cells fraction) (29.83 ± 24.06), CD4 + T
cells (17.65 ± 23.67) and CD8+ T cells (6.793 ± 3.122).
The PD-L1 mRNA expression was also observed in the
negative fraction (60.37 ± 27.45), which was considered
to contain natural killer cells and conventional B cells
among others. To determine the effect of T cell stimulation on the expression of bovine PD-L1 mRNA, PBMC
from healthy animals were cultured in the presence of
anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Figure 2b,
the addition of this antibody enhanced the expression of
bovine PD-L1 mRNA in PBMC (785.7 ± 557.4) to a
magnitude similar to that induced by ConA (616.7 ±
481.3), a lectin which induces T cell proliferation by its
specific interaction with the T cell receptor complex.
There were no notable differences in the expression
levels of bovine PD-L1 mRNA before and after cell cultivation without stimulation (187.7 ± 73.28).
PD-L1 expression in BLV-infected cattle at different
disease stages

To evaluate PD-L1 expression in BLV-infected animals,
we examined the percentages of PD-L1+ cells in PBMC
freshly isolated from BLV-infected cattle at different disease stages. Typical cases of different expression levels
of PD-L1 in BLV-infected cattle at different disease
stages determined by flow cytometric analysis are shown
in Figure 3a. The mean percentage of PD-L1+ cells in
PBMC isolated from PL cattle (33.89 ± 10.55) was significantly higher than that of uninfected cattle (10.32 ±
6.801, p < 0.001) and AL cattle (15.81 ± 11.05, p <
0.001) (Figure 3b). Similarly, the mean percentage of
PD-L1+ cells was significantly increased in cattle with
lymphoma (24.17 ± 7.404) compared to BLV-negative
cattle (p < 0.05). No difference in the mean percentage
of PD-L1+ cells was observed between BLV-negative and
AL cattle, as well as between PL and cattle with lymphoma. In the case of retrovirus infections such as HIV
and HTLV-1, the up-regulation of the PD-L1 expression
has been observed in target cells for virus infection or
infected cells [8,17]. BLV is characterized as a B-cell tropic virus and induces aberrant B cell (especially CD5+ or
IgM+ B cell) proliferation during disease progression. As
an attempt to evaluate the expression of PD-L1 on B
cells, we measured the proportion of the cells expressing
PD-L1 among IgM+ cells and CD5+ cells by flow cytometry. As expected, the number of IgM+ cells and CD5+
cells were increased during disease progression (data not
shown). As shown in Figures 3c and 3d, the percentages
of PD-L1 + and CD5 + or IgM + cells in PBMC were
clearly increased in cattle at the PL stage (17.22 ± 9.004
and 25.61 ± 14.13) compared to BLV-negative (3.154 ±
1.989, p < 0.001 and 7.935 ± 2.613, p < 0.001) and AL
cattle (6.623 ± 4.479, p < 0.01 and 14.86 ± 11.91). The

proportions of PD-L1+ and CD5+ or IgM+ cells isolated
from cattle with lymphoma (11.77 ± 5.122 and 21.23 ±
6.091) were elevated compared to those of AL and BLVnegative cattle, although the differences were not statistically significant.

during virus proliferation and progression of BLVinduced disease could be due to the increase of PD-L1+
cells.

Correlation between the number of leukocytes, provirus
loads or virus titer and PD-L1 expression

To test the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on
immune cell function, PBMC from BLV-infected cattle were cultivated in the presence of ConA together
with either an anti-PD-L1 or an isotype control antibody. The expression of anti-viral cytokine (IL-2 and
IFN-g) mRNA in the cultured PBMC were analyzed
by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of both
IL-2 and IFN-g was found to be augmented in cells
treated with the anti-PD-L1 antibody compared to
those treated with the control antibody for 18 h (Figure 6). IL-2 mRNA was increased by 4.258 fold (Figure 6a: p < 0.01), while IFN-g mRNA was increased by
2.401 fold (Figure 6b: p < 0.05). In contrast, there was
no notable change in cytokine expression in PBMC
treated with the isotype control antibody. To confirm
that the PD-L1 blockade can enhance T cell dependent functions, CD4 + or CD8 + cell-depleted PBMC
were cultivated in the presence of either an anti-PDL1 or an isotype control antibody. A limited number
of cattle were tested, the restorative effect of IL-2
(Figure 6a) and IFN-g (Figure 6b) expression were
lower in the T cell-depleted PBMC than those of
whole PBMC, although there is no significant difference between them. These findings raise the possibility that the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could inhibit BLV
propagation. Thus, we examined the provirus load
and proportion of the BLV-gp51+ cells in the presence
of either an anti-PD-L1 or an isotype control antibody. As expected, the provirus load was strongly
decreased (except in one case) by the addition of antiPD-L1 antibody (Figure 7a: 0.69 ± 0.29, p < 0.05).
BLV-gp51 + cells were notably eliminated by the

To determine if the increased proportion of PD-L1-positive cells among PBMC correlated to the changes in the
number of leukocytes, provirus loads and virus titer in
BLV-infected cattle, we performed statistical analysis
based on Pearson correlation coefficients (Figure 4). As
expected, a significant positive correlation was detected
between the levels of PD-L1+ cells and the number of
leukocytes (Figure 4a: p < 0.01). Notably, the levels of
PD-L1+ cells correlated with provirus loads (Figure 4b: p
< 0.001) and virus titer (Figure 4c: p < 0.0001) in BLVinfected cattle. These results suggest that an increase of
PD-L1 + cells could influence the expansion of BLVinfected cells during the progression of the disease.

expression

It has been known that IFN-g, a key cytokine for virus
clearance, is downregulated during BLV infection [2].
This phenomenon is characterized as immune suppression that facilitates disease progression during BLV
infection through an unknown mechanism. Thus, we
investigated the correlation between the percentages of
PD-L1+ cells and IFN- g expression in PBMC from BLV
infected animals. As observed in the previous study [2],
increased IFN-g levels correlated significantly with
reduced provirus load in BLV-infected animals (Figure
5a: p < 0.01). Interestingly, lower proportions of circulating PD-L1+ cells correlated strongly with increased
IFN-g levels (Figure 5b: p < 0.001). These results
prompted the notion that decreased levels of IFN-g

although some individual differences were observed
(Figure 7b). The anti-viral effects were downregulated
by T cell-depletions, such as CD4 + , CD8 + and CD3 +
cells, although no significant difference was observed,
so the results need to be confirmed using a larger
sample size of cattle (Figure 7b).

Discussion
In domestic animals including cattle, there are still many
intractable diseases with poor-prognosis because of lack
of effective treatment and vaccination. This may be
attributed to the lack of a better understanding of
immunological mechanisms leading to immune evasion.
Recent studies have indicated the involvement of a

Ikebuchi et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:103
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/103

major inhibitory network of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways
in immune dysfunction in several human diseases. However, there are only a few reports available on the role
of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways in domestic animals. As an
example, porcine PD-1 and PD-L1 have been cloned
and shown to have functions [18,19]. In the present
study, the genes for bovine PD-L1 in two breeds of cattle were cloned and sequenced, and together with
bovine PD-1 reported in our previous study [5], they
were compared to the sequences from various mammalian species. We also demonstrated the correlation
between BLV infection and PD-L1 expression, and confirmed that the blockade of PD-L1 by anti-PD-L1 antibody led to upregulation of cytokine production that
resulted in enhancement of anti-virus immunity and
ultimately reduced virus load and infected cells in vitro.
A deeper understanding of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in
domestic animals will facilitate the elucidation of events
leading to immune dysfunction during the progression
of incurable diseases.
In our studies, PD-L1 expression on PBMC, especially
B cells that proliferated abnormally, and PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [5] were found to be
upregulated in cattle with advanced disease, consistent
with previous reports showing the upregulation of PD-1
and PD-L1 expression in retrovirus infections. In HIV
infection, the expression of PD-L1 has been found to be
upregulated on myeloid DC [17] as well as on CD4 +
and CD8+ effector T cells [7]. Moreover, HIV-specific
CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been shown to express
high levels of PD-1 that correlated with HIV-specific Tcell dysfunction with impaired proliferative responses to
virus-derived antigens [6,9,20]. In HTLV infection, the
upregulation of PD-L1 on CD4+ and CD25+ T cells, as
well as the upregulation of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells (especially HTLV-1-specific T cells) together with anti-virus
T cell dysfunctions have been reported [8,21]. BLV,
which is related to HTLV, causes chronic infections of
B cells that may lead to leukemia and lymphoma in cattle through mechanisms of disease progression yet to be
elucidated. Nevertheless, there has been evidence of dysfunction of cellular immunity that has been associated
with progression of the disease [2]. Thus, our findings
underscore earlier reports suggesting that the PD-1/PDL1 pathway in retrovirus infection is associated with T
cell dysfunction during disease progression, and that
PD-L1+ B cells proliferate abnormally in BLV-infected
cattle. However, in the present study, we could not
compare the expression of PD-L1 on BLV-infected cells
between cattle at different disease stages because BLVgp51 was not found to be expressed on freshly isolated
PBMC from infected cattle, even at the late stage of the
disease. Nevertheless, after a short period of culturing
the cells, BLV-gp51 could be expressed on B cells, but

Page 13 of 15

the co-founding complication was that the downregulation of PD-L1 expression appeared to be inconsistent
among the various cattle tested. It was thus difficult to
determine whether the expression of PD-L1 was specifically upregulated on BLV-infected B cells compared to
BLV-negative B cells, despite its clear effect on the provirus load and virus titer. Further detailed analyses will
be needed to confirm this.
The mechanism of PD-L1 upregulation during BLVinduced disease progression remains unknown. In HIV
models, several hypotheses on what elevates PD-1 and
PD-L1 expressions, such as cytokine microenvironment
[22], virus-derived proteins [23], influx of microbial products [24] and chronic antigen presentation [25], have
been proposed. These hypotheses might contribute to
understanding the mechanism of PD-L1 upregulation
during BLV infection, considering that changes in cytokine microenvironment [1,2,26,27] and aberrant modulation of host molecules by a BLV transcription factor,
Tax, have been previously reported in BLV-infected animals [28]. Nevertheless, further elucidation of the
mechanism for the elevation of PD-L1 expression is
warranted to fully understand the cell signaling pathways involved in the modulation of host immune
responses.
In mouse models, the reinvigoration of exhausted antiviral immune responses by the blockade of the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway is well established. Blockade of the PD1/PD-L1 pathway by anti-PD-L1 antibody, presumably
by blocking the inhibitory signal of PD-1, results in the
enhancement of the proliferative capacity of T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV),
hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus [29-32]. Similar
observations have been made for HIV and HTLV infections by using antibodies to block the PD-1/PD-L1
interaction in in vitro cell cultures [6,8,20]. In the present study, we have shown that blockade of PD-1/PD-L1
by anti-PD-L1 antibody upregulated the expression of
anti-virus cytokines (IFN-g and IL-2) in cultured PBMC
that had been isolated from immune-suppressed BLVinfected cattle. It is noteworthy that the blockade of the
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway restored anti-viral immune functions and reduced BLV provirus and BLV-gp51+ cells in
vitro. The results obtained in this study were consistent
with those of LCMV, HIV and HTLV.
As an alternative method to confirm that the PD-L1
blockade can enhance T cell functions, CD4+ or CD8+
cell depleted PBMC were cultivated in the presence of
anti-PD-L1 antibody. A limited number of cattle were
tested, yet as expected, the restorative effect of IL-2 and
IFN-g expression were lower in the T cell depleted
PBMC than those of PBMC. In addition, BLV-gp51
+
cells were notably eliminated by the addition of antiPD-L1 antibody, and the anti-viral effects were

Ikebuchi et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:103
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/103

downregulated by T cell depletions. The likely cause of
the inhibition of BLV proliferation during the blockade
of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in vitro could be due to the
enhancement of proliferation of CTL and Th1 cells that
have anti-virus specific cellular functions. However, our
observations could not point to anti-BLV specific
immune cells. Bovine or sheep T cell epitope peptides
of BLV gp51 were identified in several works [33,34], so
the analysis of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade stimulated by
the epitope peptide or the peptide mix of other BLV
protein helped to clarify whether the BLV specific
immune reaction is upregulated or not. Furthermore, by
using real-time RT-PCR, presumed secreted anti-viral
factors, granzyme B and perforin, were analyzed in
PBMC cultivated in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody. However, no significant changes in the expression
profiles of these anti-viral factors were observed in the
PBMC containing cells expressing high levels of IFN-g
and IL-2 mRNA (data not shown). Further elucidation
of the detailed mechanisms concerning the effect of the
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on BLV-induced disease progression is required.
It remains to be determined whether bovine PD-L1 on
B cells has any function similar to mouse or human PDL1 on T and B cells whose functions are to send the
immunoinhibitory signals into the cells. The intracellular domain of mouse, human and bovine PD-L1 is only
about 30 aa in length and there is no known functional
domain, suggesting that PD-L1 may function only as a
ligand. However, there have been some conflicting
reports on the intracellular signaling functions of mouse
and human PD-L1. Stimulation of PD-L1 on EpsteinBarr virus-transformed B cells has been reported to
induce apoptosis of the B cells [35], while PD-L1 on
cancer cells has been shown to act as an anti-apoptotic
receptor [36]. PD-L1 on mouse and human T cells has
been demonstrated to interact with B7-1 (CD80), resulting in the generation of the inhibitory signal in the T
cells [37,38]. Although no consensus was reached about
the PD-L1 function as a receptor in our study, the treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibody induced the reduction
in provirus load, suggesting the presence of a reversesignaling mechanism through PD-L1.
In conclusion, we present here an aberrant expression
of PD-L1 on B-cells in BLV-infected cattle, with the elevated proportion of PD-L1 + cells correlating with
immune evasion during the course of the disease. Consistent with previous reports, the blockade of the PD-1/
PD-L1 pathway enhanced T-cell function and resulted
in the inhibition of BLV proliferation. Thus, PD-1induced T-cell dysfunction through its binding to the
PD-L1 on B-cells might contribute to disease progression. The treatment of SIV-infected macaques and
LCMV-infected mice with either PD-L1 or PD-1

Page 14 of 15

antibody have restored multiple functions in formerly
exhausted T cells and resulted in virus clearance in vivo
[10,11,29]. Thus, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has
a potential clinical application in enhancing host antimicrobial immunity to treat chronic infections. Studies are
underway to evaluate the possible clinical application of
the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as a novel strategy to control
bovine diseases using the BLV infection model.
