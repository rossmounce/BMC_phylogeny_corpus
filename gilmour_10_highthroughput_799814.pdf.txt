Abstract
Background: A large, multi-province outbreak of listeriosis associated with ready-to-eat meat products
contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1/2a occurred in Canada in 2008. Subtyping of outbreakassociated isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed two similar but distinct AscI PFGE patterns.
High-throughput pyrosequencing of two L. monocytogenes isolates was used to rapidly provide the genome
sequence of the primary outbreak strain and to investigate the extent of genetic diversity associated with a
change of a single restriction enzyme fragment during PFGE.
Results: The chromosomes were collinear, but differences included 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
and three indels, including a 33 kbp prophage that accounted for the observed difference in AscI PFGE patterns.
The distribution of these traits was assessed within further clinical, environmental and food isolates associated with
the outbreak, and this comparison indicated that three distinct, but highly related strains may have been involved
in this nationwide outbreak. Notably, these two isolates were found to harbor a 50 kbp putative mobile genomic
island encoding translocation and efflux functions that has not been observed in other Listeria genomes.
Conclusions: High-throughput genome sequencing provided a more detailed real-time assessment of genetic
traits characteristic of the outbreak strains than could be achieved with routine subtyping methods. This study
confirms that the latest generation of DNA sequencing technologies can be applied during high priority public
health events, and laboratories need to prepare for this inevitability and assess how to properly analyze and
interpret whole genome sequences in the context of molecular epidemiology.

Background
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, facultative
intracellular bacterial pathogen that can cause severe
disease in humans, other mammals and birds [1].
Human listeriosis is relatively rare despite our likely frequent encounters with L. monocytogenes, which is ubiquitously present in the environment (including water,
soil, vegetation), farm and rural environments, and
urban environments [2-6]. The vast majority of human
listeriosis is foodborne and the most commonly implicated vehicles are ready-to-eat food products such as
meat, dairy, seafood, and fresh produce that are

contaminated with L. monocytogenes during processing
[6,7]. L. monocytogenes can be introduced into food processing facilities and food products due to cross-contamination with environmental sources or from the
feces of food production animals. L. monocytogenes can
persist within food processing environments for long
periods of time, due in part to its ability to grow at
wide-ranging temperatures and pH (0.4°C to 45°C, pH 4
to 9.6) and the ability to form biofilms promoting
adherence to food processing surfaces [8-11]. The persistence of a single subtype of L. monocytogenes in processing facilities or on equipment has been reported
from several months to more than 10 years [12,13].
Given the widespread occurrence of L. monocytogenes,
subtyping of clinical and food isolates is required to
establish epidemiologic links during routine surveillance,

outbreak investigations, and for source tracking. There
are 13 known serotypes of L. monocytogenes but the vast
majority of human disease cases are caused by strains
belonging to serotypes 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b, severely limiting the utility of this subtyping method for differentiating L. monocytogenes [14]. Large clonal outbreaks owing
to contaminated food sources such as coleslaw, milk,
cheese, hot dogs and deli meats, have been predominately caused by serotypes 4b and 1/2a strains [15].
Accordingly, additional subtyping methods are required
to better characterize outbreak isolates. Several molecular subtyping methods have been developed and applied
to L. monocytogenes, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, multilocus variable-number
tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and sequence-based
subtyping [14,16,17]. PFGE has been adopted by PulseNet as the internationally standardized method for
molecular subtyping of L.monocytogenes and has been
essential in the detection and investigation of listeriosis
outbreaks in Canada and worldwide [18-20].
DNA sequencing has enabled analyses of L. monocytogenes genomes and furthered the understanding of this
pathogen’s biology and phylogeny. Comparative analyses
of genome sequences have elucidated the genetic differences between L. monocytogenes serotypes, the acquisition and evolution of virulence and pathogenic traits
among Listeria spp., and the genetic basis underlying
the unique survival and growth characteristics of L.
monocytogenes [21-23]. Genome sequencing has also
permitted the development of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) protocols, which in combination with other
typing methods, have validated three evolutionary
lineages for L. monocytogenes [24-29]. The lineages
reflect the serotype distribution, with serotypes 1/2b, 3b
and 4b segregating to lineage I and serotypes 1/2a and
1/2c segregating to lineage II. Risk assessments based
upon genetic lineages have suggested that L. monocytogenes subtypes may have unique ecological niches and
may also differ in their pathogenic potential or host
adaptations [30,31].
The majority of available bacterial genome sequences
have been generated using the Sanger chain termination
sequencing chemistries. Although this technology was
instrumental in the emergence of the field of genomics,
it is time and resource intensive [32,33]. Several postSanger sequencing technologies (also referred to as
next-generation sequencing technologies) have
since been developed that enable extremely rapid wholegenome sequencing and a broader application of
comparative genomics [33,34]. The high-throughput
pyrosequencing method commercialized as the 454 or
GS FLX™ platform has been applied for rapidly determining the genome sequences of bacterial isolates.

L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a caused a nationwide
outbreak of listeriosis associated with ready-to-eat meat
products in Canada during the summer of 2008. The
outbreak resulted in 22 deaths and at least 57 illnesses.
Whereas the majority of outbreak-associated isolates
(human clinical and food isolates) had an indistinguishable AscI PFGE pattern, one clinical isolate from
Ontario and several isolates from the affected food production facility exhibited an AscI PFGE pattern that differed by a single restriction enzyme fragment compared
to the primary outbreak strain. We report herein the
first real-time application of whole-genome sequencing
during an active listeriosis outbreak investigation. Highthroughput pyrosequencing was applied to characterize
two outbreak-associated isolates of L. monocytogenes in
order to obtain a thorough genetic characterization of
the outbreak strains and to determine the genetic basis
for the single AscI restriction fragment change.

Results and Discussion
Primary outbreak isolate harbors unique plasmid
pLM5578 and prophage jLMC1

Public health responses to foodborne outbreaks require
bacterial subtyping data to definitively link affected individuals with contaminated food sources and other suspected patients. The genetic relatedness between clinical
and food isolates is routinely determined using methods
such as PFGE, however, with the latest generation of
DNA sequencing technologies it is theoretically possible
to now determine the complete genetic blueprint of bacterial isolates within the scope of an outbreak. In this
study, draft genome sequences suitable for comparative
analysis between outbreak isolates and to reference genomes were available within three days. These data
allowed for discovery of novel prophage and genomic
islands, and the subsequent sequence closure and the
confirmation of sequence variants allowed for annotation of polymorphisms and other traits associated with
micro-diversity.
Clinical isolate 08-5578 was selected as the reference
outbreak strain (serotype 1/2a; PFGE patterns
LMACI.0040 and LMAAI.0001; Table 1) and clinical
isolate 08-5923 differed only in the AscI restriction pattern (LMACI.0001; Fig. 1). High-throughput pyrosequencing was performed on both isolates and closed
circular chromosomal sequences were obtained for each
isolate (Table 2; Fig. 2). A 77 kbp contig present in the
08-5578 sequence assembly but absent in 08-5923 was
identified as a circular plasmid and designated pLM5578
(Table 2). Comparison of the chromosomal sequences
for isolates 08-5578 and 08-5923 with publicly available
Listeria spp. genomes (Fig. 3A) and with select loci used
for MLST (Fig. 3B) indicated that these isolates were

members of evolutionary lineage II and clonal complex
8 (discussed further below).
The AscI restriction patterns of 08-5578 and 08-5923
were indistinguishable, except for a single band shift of
approximately 32 kbp (from 476 kbp in 08-5578 to 444
kbp in 08-5923; Fig. 1). Accordingly, comparative
sequence alignment revealed a 33 kbp contiguous region
integrated adjacent to (but not disrupting) the tRNA-Ser
gene that was unique to 08-5578 and encoding several
putative bacteriophage-related coding sequences (designated jLMC1) (Fig. 4). BLAST analyses indicated that
this prophage was unique among sequenced Listeria
genomes, although it was comprised of coding
sequences similar to determinants from several known
phages associated with Gram-positive microbes, including L. monocytogenes phages A006, A118 and B025 (see
Additional file 1). The presence of prophage jLMC1
accounted for the AscI restriction pattern difference
between isolates 08-5578 and 08-5923.
The extrachromosomal circular plasmid (pLM5578) harbored in isolate 08-5578 encoded putative determinants
for replication, partitioning, heavy metal resistance and
DNA translocation (Fig. 5a, and Additional file 2). Many
of these features were homologous to sequences
encoded by plasmids from L. innocua (pLI100), L.
monocytogenes serotype 4b isolate H7858 (pLM80) and
Bacillus anthracis (pXO2), including a replication and
regulation control center (pLM5578_17 - 20). Two
regions of pLM5578 were related to heavy metal resistance, including a transposon-associated cadA that

exhibited high sequence identity to pLI100. A second,
distinct region unique to pLM5578 was comprised of
cadA (second copy) and cadC genes, with the latter
encoding a cadmium-efflux ArsR-family regulatory
accessory protein (repressor) homolog. Resistance to the
heavy metal cadmium has been recently discovered to
be associated with resistance to quaternary ammonium
compounds (sanitizers), which may contribute to L.
monocytogenes persistence in food production facilities
[35]. Notably, several coding sequences exhibited
sequence similarity to type IV secretion systems (T4SS),
including DNA processing (virD2), DNA coupling
(virD4) and membrane channel formation (virB1, -B4,
-B5, -B6, -B11) (see Additional file 2). Additional predicted membrane-associated proteins were present
within this region, and all coding sequences were
oriented in the same direction (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the operon-style organization of most known
T4SS. Varying degrees of similarity between pLI100,
pLM80 and pXO2 plasmids have already been established [21], and our data further support a chimeric nature for Listeria plasmids.
pLM5578 and jLMC1 exhibit non-homogeneous
distribution within a wider panel of
outbreak-associated isolates

During the outbreak, serotype 1/2a L. monocytogenes
isolates were recovered from clinical samples, contaminated food products and the food processing environment that shared the two AscI PFGE patterns observed

that this novel sequence insertion accounts for the

restriction enzyme pattern shift relative to PFGE pattern
LMACI.0040. Bacteriophage insertions have previously
been recognized as contributing to macromolecular
genetic diversity between related outbreak-associated L.
monocytogenes strains [12,36].
The PCR screening assays for plasmid determinants
confirmed that pLM5578 was absent in isolate 08-5923,
and this plasmid was also absent in other outbreakrelated isolates (independent of PFGE profile), including
one clinical isolate (Table 1). The sequence of pLM5578
revealed an absence of AscI restriction sites and presence of a single ApaI restriction site, but this element
did not contribute to the PFGE patterns resulting from
these enzymes. In contrast, plasmid pLM80 (containing
a single ApaI recognition site) had been reported as visible in ApaI PFGE digests [36]. Just as a variable presence of plasmid pLM5578 was observed in this
Canadian outbreak, plasmid pLM80 was sporadically
present in isolates during the 1998-99 multi-state serotype 4b frankfurter USA outbreak [36]. Lack of stable
vertical transmission of pLM5578 during the outbreak
or laboratory culture (despite the presence of a partitioning determinant, pLM5578_15) might account for
plasmid absence. Alternatively, pLM5578 may have been
carried only in a subset of L. monocytogenes strains that
subsequently caused the outbreak. Presence of determinants related to bacterial conjugation (Fig. 5A) further
confounds any speculation on the transmission of this
plasmid.
Whole genome comparisons enable construction of an
evolutionary model of the outbreak isolates

The genomes of 08-5578 and 08-5923 were collinear, and
with the exception of the prophage and plasmid unique
to 08-5578, all genetic diversity was accounted for by 2
short indels and 28 confirmed SNPs. The two indels
included a single C/T base pair insertion in 08-5578 that
introduced a frameshift truncation into coding sequence
LM5578_1509 (buk, encoding a putative butyrate kinase).
Secondly, there was a 21 bp (7 codon) in-frame deletion

in the gltX gene (LM5578_0279) of 08-5578 encoding a
putative glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. DNA sequencing
confirmed that this gltX deletion was present in all examined LMACI.0040 isolates but that a wild type allele was
present in all isolates typed as LMACI.0001 (Table 1).
Alternatively, a wild type buk gene was only observed in
isolate 08-5923 and a truncated butyrate kinase was
encoded in all other isolates, independent of PFGE pattern (Table 1). Directed PCR and DNA sequencing of the
SNP sites within the panel of clinical, food and environmental isolates was also performed (Table 1). Of the 28
SNPs, 27 were only present in isolate 08-5923. The

singular remaining non-coding SNP was observed in
each of LMACI.0040 isolates (at intergenic coordinate
2691224 of 08-5578) but was absent in all of the
LMACI.0001 isolates, including 08-5923.
The 27 SNPs observed in the genome of clinical isolate 08-5923 included 20 non-synonymous, 5 synonymous and 2 intergenic mutations (Table 3). Such a
predominance of non-synonymous changes suggests
that isolate 08-5923 was under strong positive selection
for functional divergence rather than purifying selection
(wherein synonymous exceed non-synonymous mutation
rates). The non-synonymous mutations occurred in nine

COG categories, including four changes related to transcription, but no mutations occurred in COGs related to
DNA repair, recombination or replication (Table 3).
Only four non-synonymous changes represented functionally analogous amino acid changes (e.g, I/L/V/G)
and none were in exported proteins carrying signal peptides. To place this finding into context, Listeria species
have been reported as having the strongest purifying
selection (elevated synonymous mutation rates) of all
the prokaryotes following comparison of multiple completed genome sequences [37]. Furthermore, genome
sequencing of four serotype 1/2a lineage II isolates from
an endemic clone contaminating a single food production facility from 1988 to 2000 revealed only 11 total
SNPs outside of the bacteriophage determinants, and a

maximum of 8 SNPs were observed between any two
given strains [12]. This low number of SNPs in an endemic clone spanning over 12 years suggested that noncontrolled natural populations of L. monocytogenes are
stable and exhibit limited genetic micro-diversity [12]. If
a similar mutation rate occurred in the serotype 1/2a L.
monocytogenes isolates recovered during this 2008 Canadian outbreak, passage of several decades would be
expected in order to attain 28 total SNPs. We are
assuming that 08-5923 shares a very recent ancestor as
08-5578 and thus speculate that 08-5923 was subjected
to pressures resulting in elevated mutation rates and an
abundance of non-synonymous changes.
We propose a model to describe the chromosomal
evolution of strains involved in this nation-wide

outbreak using the distribution and segregation of
genetic traits such as SNPs, indels and prophage (Fig. 6).
This model assumes that the last common ancestor
(LCA) of all strains encoded wild type buk and gltX loci,
jLMC1 was absent, and the wild type state of all SNP
positions was represented by the sequences in 08-5578
with the exception of intergenic SNP at 2691224. Isolate
08-5923 is predicted to be a direct descendent of the
LCA, as it is the only isolate encoding a wild type buk
gene. The remainder of the LMACI.0001 isolates

differed from the LCA by only the single frameshift in
buk, generating ancestor 2 (Fig. 6). From ancestor 2,
acquisition of three independent traits (jLMC1, the 21
bp deletion in gltX and the intergenic SNP at coordinate
2691224) occurred, resulting in a third lineage defined
by the LMACI.0040 PFGE pattern. In light of the high
numbers of non-synonymous SNPs in 08-5923 and
macromolecular genetic changes such as bacteriophage
integration in the lineage represented by 08-5578, we
speculate that three distinct, but highly related strains

were circulating in this outbreak (Fig. 6). The diversifying SNPs in 08-5923 may have occurred in response to
adverse environmental conditions prior to infection or
host-specific conditions during infection, and jLMC1
likely arose by acquisition from other natural populations in the affected production facility.
Genome sequence alignments reveal that the outbreak
isolates belong to evolutionary lineage II - clonal
complex 8

Phylogenetic comparison to Listeria genome sequences
representing each of the three L. monocytogenes evolutionary lineages, L. welshimeri and L. innocua indicated
that 08-5578 and 08-5923 are both lineage II strains
(Fig. 3A). The most closely related genome was strain
EGDe, a serotype 1/2a lab-passaged animal isolate from
1924 [22]. For detection of large-scale genomic rearrangements, a dot plot comparison of 08-5578 versus the
EGDe genome sequence was performed (see Additional
file 3). This revealed that the common chromosomal
sequences were collinear, with the exception of a large
50 kbp inverted segment around the putative origin of
replication (coordinate 1 of EGDe) (see Additional file
3). Symmetric inversions around the origin of replication
have previously been observed between other bacterial
genome sequences [38]. In contrast to only 28 SNPs
being observed between 08-5578 and 08-5923, 24660
high quality SNPs and 941 estimated indels were
revealed in a comparison of 08-5578 and EGDe (data
not shown). These included 17874 synonymous SNPs,
4692 non-synonymous SNPs and 475 indels occurring
within 1214 predicted coding sequences, with 1 to 167
non-synonymous SNPs and/or indels occurring per
gene. Moreover, two large contiguous regions present in

both 08-5578 and 08-5923 represent probable prophages
(designated jLMC2 and jLMC3) that are absent in
EGDe (Fig. 2, see Additional file 3). jLMC2 was highly
related to phage B025, and jLMC3 was inserted at
comK and related to Listeria phage A006.
Comparative analysis of the regions used for multilocus sequence typing (MLST) indicated that isolates 085578 and 08-5923 are more closely related to lineage II
clonal complex 8 (CC8) than to EGDe (Fig. 3B). The
MLST determinants used by Ragon et. al. [24] were
extracted in silico from the genome sequences and 085923 was identical to a previously characterized CC8,
sequence type 120 (ST120) strain (encoding abcZ allele
5, bglA allele 6, cat allele 2, dapE allele 29, dat allele 5,
ldh allele 3, lhkA allele 1). The extracted sequences for
08-5578 were also identical to ST120 except for one SNP
within the abcZ locus not currently listed in the Institute
Pasteur’s L. monocytogenes MLST database. The sole previous member of ST120 was identified as a clinical serotype 1/2a isolate derived from a CNS infection in New
Zealand in 1995 [24]. Phylogenetic trees based on MLST
and whole genome sequences were relatively congruent
when considering evolutionary lineages, however genome
sequences provide a more precise placement relative to
other examined isolates. The pyrosequencing data also
provided the opportunity to analyze the entire genome
for micro and macro-diversity, including the full repertoire of phylogenetically relevant loci.
Virulence-associated determinants of the outbreak
isolates informs lineage- and strain-specific
virulence potential

The surface protein internalin, encoded by the inlA
locus, is a principal virulence determinant promoting

Gilmour et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/120

mammalian host cell invasion via interaction with Ecadherin on epithelial cells [39]. Truncation variants of
inlA have been associated with decreased pathogenicity
and significantly reduced invasiveness for human intestinal epithelial cells [40,41]. Using nomenclature assigned
by Ragon et al. [24], isolates 08-5578 and 08-5923 both
encode a full length inlA allele type 2 that has previously been observed in isolates related to human illness [24]. This singular determinant however cannot
account for differences in pathogenicity since foodborne
isolates have been observed with intact inlA loci [42]
and inlA allele 2 is also encoded by environmental isolates [43]. L. monocytogenes does encode multiple additional internalin and internalin-like coding sequences,
although the function of each paralog is currently
unknown [21,44]. Isolates 08-5578 and 08-5923 both
encode inlB, inlC, inlC2, inlD, inlE, inlF, inlG, inlI, inlJ
and 11 other leucine-rich internalin-like coding
sequences (see Additional file 4). The presence of an
intact inlA locus and this compilation of other internalin-like loci may account in part for the pathogenicity of
the serotype 1/2a outbreak strains sequenced in this
study, but this requires further examination.
The Listeria pathogenicity island 1 (LIPI-1) encodes
six significant virulence-associated loci: prfA (pleiotropic
virulence transcriptional regulator), plcA, plcB (both
encoding phospholipases), hly (listeriolysin O), mpl
(metalloprotease) and actA (involved in actin-mediated
motility). Previous phylogenetic analysis of this region
from food, clinical, animal and environmental isolates
indicated that this gene cluster was genetically diverse
and clustered based on the three L. monocytogenes evolutionary lineages [25,45]. BLASTn comparative analyses
of this ~9 kbp region from 08-5578 and 08-5923 identified a very high sequence identity with other lineage II
isolates, including 99.5% identity to the EDGe reference
genome; ≥ 98% identity to all 23 lineage II isolates characterized by Ward et al. [25], and ≥ 98% nucleotide
identity to all 21 lineage II isolates characterized by Orsi
et al. [45]. In comparison, all LIPI-1 regions encoded by
evolutionary lineage I and III strains in these previous
studies were ≤ 95% identical to our lineage II strains.
PrfA regulates additional virulence determinants
encoded elsewhere on the chromosome, such as bsh
encoding a bile salt hydrolase that promotes survival
within the gut [46] and uhpT encoding for a hexose
phosphate permease for utilization of host carbon
sources [47]. These latter two determinants were also
encoded within 08-5578 and 08-5923. The presence of
these determinants along with LIPI-1 is well conserved
across L. monocytogenes strains independent of evolutionary lineage, so are unlikely to enhance virulence
potential unless the allelic diversity observed between
lineages results in a phenotypic change. In general, the

Page 10 of 15

contribution of lineage-specific genome differences to
virulence and pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes are not
well understood. For example, recent in silico analyses
have indicated that while there are lineage II-specific
genomic regions not present in lineage I, their role in
virulence is not clear [30]. Furthermore, the presence of
the Listeria pathogenicity island LIPI-3 operon encoding
Listeriolysin S has been associated with evolutionary
lineage I strains causing foodborne outbreaks [48]. This
region was absent in the genomes of both 08-5578 and
08-5923.
Outbreak isolates harbor a putative mobile genetic island
encoding translocation functions

A large 49.8 kbp contiguous region (coordinates
1836435-1886209 of 08-5578; coding sequences
LM5578_1850 to LM5578_1903) was present in both
sequenced genomes yet absent in all publicly available
Listeria genome sequences to date, including EGDe (Fig.
2). The bordering coding sequences LM5578_1849 and
LM5578_1904 were each 98% identical to contiguous
EGDe coding sequences lmo1702 and lmo1703, respectively, implying that the 50 kbp operon-like structured
region represents a genomic insertion within the ancestral chromosome of these isolates. Accordingly, putative
serine recombinases are encoded in this region (loci
LM5578_1855-58) and 16 bp imperfect inverted repeats
are present at the borders in the intergenic regions
between loci 1849/50 and 1903/04 (Fig. 5B), indicating
that this is a horizontally acquired genetic island, hereafter designated Listeria genomic island 1 (LGI1).
Coding sequences within LGI1 exhibited sequence
homology and were similarly organized as contiguous
regions present within several environmental firmicutes,
including Clostridium kluyveri, C. bolteae and Desulfitobacterium hafniense. These LGI1-like regions also
appeared to be horizontally-acquired, based on skewed
G/C content relative to neighboring sequences [49]. The
genetic organization and predicted functions of several
LGI1 loci resembled the proposed B. anthracis pXO1
plasmid-encoded secretion system [50], including several
coding sequences that resembled putative type II and
type IV secretion systems (T4SS) (Fig. 5B; and Additional file 2). Prototypical members of these systems are
involved in pilus biogenesis and translocation of DNAprotein complexes or virulence effectors, respectively.
Canonical T4SS genes predicted within LGI1 include
virB4, virD4, and virB11, which encode ATPases
involved in substrate recruitment to the transfer complex and substrate translocation, and virB5 and virB6
subunit genes, which form the core membrane-spanning
transfer complex (Fig. 5B; and Additional file 2). Genes
that likely contribute to pilus-like surface appendages
were also detected (cpa, tad), and the presence of a

Gilmour et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/120

dnaG gene encoding a putative primase neighboring the
virD4 coupling protein homolog suggests that this
genetic island may be mobilizable (see Additional file 2).
Besides pXO1, Type IV secretion-like systems (T4SLS)
features have also been described in Gram-positive plasmids such as B. anthracis plasmid pXO2 [51,52] and the
pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmid pCF10 of
Enterococcus faecalis [53].
Gram-positive T4SLS also encode a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase and adhesin, both of which are predicted
functions in LGI1 (LM5788_1873 and LM5578_1866,
respectively). LM5788_1873 encodes a C-terminal NlpC/
P60 domain, and is predicted to be involved in assembly
of the core substrate transfer complex as a VirB1-like peptidoglycan hydrolase. A P60 domain is also present in the
autolytic virulence determinant designated Listeria invasion associated protein (Iap) [54]. LM5578_1866 is predicted to encode a Sel1-like repeat (SLR) family protein
that contains helical domains mediating protein-protein
interactions [55]. Although protein adhesins are often
used in Gram-positive bacteria to mediate conjugative
attachment to target cells, SLR proteins also are involved
for eukaryotic cell entry by Legionella pneumophilia
[56,57]. Whether this T4SLS is involved in translocation of
pathogenicity effector molecule(s) (in addition to probable
DNA-protein translocation) is tempting to speculate, but
further study is required.
LGI1 also encoded a homolog (LM5578_1862) to the
multidrug efflux proton:drug antiporter EmrE implicated
in resistance to toxic cationic hydrophobic compounds
such as quaternary ammonium compounds and tetracycline [58]. This gene was flanked by a MarR-family
transcriptional regulator loci (1425) and a putative
DNA-directed RNA polymerase sigma-24 subunit (rpoE,
1861) encoding a specialized ECF (extracytoplasmic
function) family sigma factor, which is part of the bacterial stress response regulon [59]. A two component
signal transduction system (sensor histidine kinase and
response regulator; LM5578_1852 and 1851) and restriction modification components (LM5578_1850 and 1853)
also were present. Cumulatively, LGI1 is unique compared to all currently sequenced L. monocytogenes but
the contribution to pathogenicity or environmental persistence is unconfirmed.

Conclusions
High-throughput DNA sequencing rapidly provided the
complete genetic content of two L. monocytogenes outbreak isolates. Within three days of project commencement, draft genome sequences were available that were
suitable to begin comparative analyses such as genome
alignments, preliminary annotation of coding sequences,
and identification of traits associated with macro-diversity and micro-diversity. This allowed us to determine

Page 11 of 15

evolutionary lineages and unequivocally define the full
breadth of genetic variation between two subtype variants
identified by the internationally PulseNet standardized
PFGE typing method. Whole genome sequencing therefore enabled robust real-time characterization of virulence determinants and genetic diversity (prophage and
plasmid elements; SNP and indel mutations) within a
natural L. monocytogenes population. These novel markers were then applied for a rapid assessment of the
genetic relatedness of additional clinical, food, and environmental isolates recovered during the outbreak. The
distribution of the SNP, indel and prophage traits indicated that three distinct but highly related strains were
likely involved. Further characterization of the SNPs indicated that clinical isolate 08-5923 was likely subjected to
positive selective pressures resulting in a higher frequency of non-synonymous mutation than would normally be expected for L. monocytogenes. Selective
pressure for adaptive change could have resulted from
host specific conditions during infection or adverse food
storage conditions, but with only a single available isolate
representative of this SNP genotype it is not possible to
identify the micro-diversification timeline.
Previous comparative genomic studies of outbreakassociated L. monocytogenes have found several strain
and serotype-specific coding sequences between serotype 4b and 1/2a strains, but amongst these there were
few relevant genetic traits suggestive of virulence potential [21,30]. One notable exception was variation in the
complement of internalin-like coding determinants [21],
and consistent with this finding, a large composition of
internalin-like determinants was observed in the current
study. In addition, there were two large-scale genetic
insertions unique to our serotype 1/2a strains. Prophage
jLMC1 was composed of genes related to previously
characterized phage determinants, but on the whole,
represented a novel Listeria phage. A ~50 kbp genetic
island (LGI1) unique amongst all other currently
sequenced L. monocytogenes isolates was also present in
08-5578, encoding putative translocation, resistance, and
regulatory determinants.
While L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a can be frequently
isolated from food processing environments, the majority
of invasive listeriosis outbreaks to date have resulted from
lineage I serotype 4b strains [15]. Lineage II serotype 1/2a
strains have more frequently been associated with outbreaks of listerial gastroenteritis [15]. Our current study
demonstrates that lineage II strains can also cause large
outbreaks of severe invasive disease and is consistent with
a global trend towards serotype 1/2a predominance.
Whole genome sequencing allowed us to detect within
these outbreak isolates a repertoire of genetic determinants involved in diversification and microevolution.
These features may have a role in virulence and

Gilmour et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/120

pathogenicity, as well as survival within food processing
environments and in foods. Genomic studies can therefore
facilitate a greater understanding of the lineage-specific
and strain-specific features of L. monocytogenes and how
they contribute to this pathogen’s ecology and virulence.
This knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of
methods to better assess the risks posed by individual L.
monocytogenes strains.
This study also provides a proof-of-concept that the
latest generation DNA sequencing platforms have a
place in real-time public health responses to bacterial
pathogens. Whole genome sequencing may not be ready
to be applied routinely as a subtyping method, but public health laboratories need to prepare for this inevitability and assess how to properly analyze and interpret
whole genome sequences in the context of molecular
epidemiology. Most of the current subtyping methods
such as PFGE and MLST capture only a small proportion of the true genetic content, so it is still difficult to
interpret robust data sets such as whole genomes when
all previous characterizations have been comparatively
limited in detail. It is foreseeable that the burgeoning
capacity for whole genome sequencing will soon provide
a cost effective alternative to the current subtyping
methods after a reconciliation has been made between
the true nature of subtypes, the diversity revealed by
classical methods and the micro- and macro-diversity
readily identified by next-generation sequencing technologies. As more genomes from clinical isolates are completed and compared (as in this study), it will become
increasingly feasible to apply genome sequencing for
responses to bacterial outbreaks.

Methods
Bacterial isolates

Clinical, food and environmental isolates (Table 1) were
collected by the Ontario Central Public Health Laboratory and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency during
an outbreak investigation of L. monocytogenes and transferred to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML)
for additional subtyping. The clinical isolates examined
in this study were collected from individual outbreakassociated cases.
Serotyping and Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis

Serotyping was performed by slide agglutination with
antisera prepared at the NML according to Seeliger and
Höhne [60]. Molecular serotyping was completed using
a multiplex PCR scheme [61]. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed according to the PulseNet standardized protocol using restriction enzymes
AscI and ApaI. PFGE patterns were designated using
BioNumerics after comparison to the PulseNet Canada
database.

Genome sequencing and bioinformatics

Genome sequencing was performed on the Roche GS
FLX™ standard platform, as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations. The relative genome coverage
achieved was approximately 40× for 08-5578 (Q40+
bases = 99.88%) and 36× for 08-5923 (Q40+ bases =
99.91%). Within the 08-5578 project the coverage of
pLM5578 was 68×, indicating that the plasmid copy
number was between 1-2 copies per cell. De novo
sequence assembly was completed using Roche’s Newbler assembler and the Staden software package [62]
after a fosmid mate-pair end library was constructed.
Gap closure was completed by Sanger-based sequencing
of select regions to bridge contigs. Presumptive insertion/deletions (indels) associated with homopolymeric
regions were verified or corrected after Sanger-based
sequencing of directed PCR amplicon templates generated from the corresponding regions in both 08-5578
and 08-5923 by proof-reading Taq polymerase.
Sequences were deposited into GenBank under the
accession numbers CP001602 (08-5578), CP001603
(pLM5578) and CP001604 (08-5923).
Pyrosequencing was completed within three days to provide greater than 99% of the genome coverage. This was
sufficient for preliminary analysis such as identification of
plasmid and phage determinants and candidate SNP’s.
Closed circular chromosomal sequences were obtained
within an additional 5 weeks after fosmid libraries were
constructed, contigs ordered and all gaps closed. Three
additional weeks were required for resequencing of SNP
and homopolymeric regions to confirm polymorphisms
and indels between the two sequenced isolates. The costs
associated with this project (in US dollars) were $5000 for
the GS-FLX run covering both isolates, $500/isolate for
the fosmid libraries and related consumables, and $2000/
isolate for primer synthesis and Sanger-based sequencing
for gap closure and resequencing.
Annotation of coding sequences for isolate 08-5578
was completed using GenDB v2.2 [63], BASys [64],
Glimmer3 [65] and by comparison to RefSeq annotations completed for L. monocytogenes strain EGDe [22].
Sequences encoding rRNA and tRNA were identified by
RNAmmer version 1.2 [66] and tRNAscan-SE version
1.23 [67], respectively. Artemis was used for manual
annotation and additional manipulations [68]. Multiple
sequence alignments of whole genomes and select loci
were generated using MAUVE [69] and ClustalW [70],
respectively, and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees
were generated using the Phylogeny Inference Package
(Phylip version 3.68). Distant homologies between
hypothetical coding sequences and entries at the PDB,
COG, PFAM and SCOP databases were detected using
the FFAS03 server [71]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified between the sequenced

Gilmour et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/120

isolates using NUCMER and dot plots were generated
using MUMmerplot [72]. The circular representation of
the genome of 08-5578 was created using DNAplotter
[73] and feature tables generated using Artemis.
Reference Listeria genome sequences were obtained
from GenBank for isolates EGDe (accession number
NC_003210),
F2365
(NC_002973),
HCC23
(NC_011660), Clip11262 (NC_003212; L. innocua),
SLCC5334 (NC_008555; L. welshimeri) and L. monocytogenes phage B025 (NC_009812). Accession numbers for
plasmid DNA sequences of pLI100 and pXO2 were
NC_003383 and NC_001496, respectively. In addition,
the DNA sequences of L. monocytogenes strains F6854
and H7858 [21] and plasmid pLM80 from strain H7858
were obtained from the J. Craig Venter Institute Comprehensive Microbial Resource http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgibin/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi. A cross match table
(Additional file 5) of the coding sequences between all
of these L. monocytogenes genomes was generated using
the publically available annotations as of September
18th, 2009 with a reciprocal BLASTp alignment threshold of 80% identity and 80% hsp. Draft genomes
sequences at the Broad Institute were also screened for
select regions using BLAST available at their database
http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/listeria_group/MultiHome.html. MLST loci data were downloaded from the Institute Pasteur Listeria monocytogenes
MLST Database http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/genopole/PF8/mlst/Lmono.html.
PCR screening and SNP confirmation

All polymerase chain reactions were performed with
Invitrogen HiFi Platinum proof-reading Taq polymerase
following the manufacturer’s directions, and with 1 uM
of each oligonucleotide (see Additional file 6) using the
following thermocycling conditions: 94°C for 5 min.; 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec., 50°C for 30 sec. and 68°C for
45 sec.; followed by 68°C for 5 min. Amplicons were
visualized after electrophoresis in 1% agarose-TBE gels.
Confirmation of SNP sites was achieved by Sangerbased sequencing of targeted amplicons using the same
oligonucleotides as used for PCR amplification.
