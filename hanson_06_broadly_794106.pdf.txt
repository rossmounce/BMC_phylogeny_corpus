Abstract
Background: Many viral pathogens are poorly characterized, are difficult to culture or reagents are
lacking for confirmatory diagnoses. We have developed and tested a robust assay for detecting and
characterizing large DNA viruses and adenoviruses. The assay is based on the use of degenerate PCR to
target a gene common to these viruses, the DNA polymerase, and sequencing the products.
Results: We evaluated our method by applying it to fowl adenovirus isolates, catfish herpesvirus isolates,
and largemouth bass ranavirus (iridovirus) from cell culture and lymphocystis disease virus (iridovirus) and
avian poxvirus from tissue. All viruses with the exception of avian poxvirus produced the expected
product. After optimization of extraction procedures, and after designing and applying an additional primer
we were able to produce polymerase gene product from the avian poxvirus genome. The sequence data
that we obtained demonstrated the simplicity and potential of the method for routine use in characterizing
large DNA viruses. The adenovirus samples were demonstrated to represent 2 types of fowl adenovirus,
fowl adenovirus 1 and an uncharacterized avian adenovirus most similar to fowl adenovirus 9. The
herpesvirus isolate from blue catfish was shown to be similar to channel catfish virus (Ictalurid herpesvirus
1). The case isolate of largemouth bass ranavirus was shown to exactly match the type specimen and both
were similar to tiger frog virus and frog virus 3. The lymphocystis disease virus isolate from largemouth
bass was shown to be related but distinct from the two previously characterized lymphocystis disease virus
isolates suggesting that it may represent a distinct lymphocystis disease virus species.
Conclusion: The method developed is rapid and broadly applicable to cell culture isolates and infected
tissues. Targeting a specific gene for in the large DNA viruses and adenoviruses provide a common
reference for grouping the newly identified viruses according to relatedness to sequences of reference
viruses and the submission of the sequence data to GenBank will build the database to make the BLAST
analysis a valuable resource readily accessible by most diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrated the utility
of this assay on viruses that infect fish and birds. These hosts are phylogenetically distant from mammals
yet, sequence data suggests that the assay would work equally as well on mammalian counterparts of these
groups of viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that obtaining genetic information on routine diagnostic
samples has great potential for revealing new virus strains and suggesting the presence of new species.

Background
Many viral pathogens of animals are poorly characterized.
To date, if a suspected new virus was identified and the
virus could be cultured, morphology, physical characteristics, growth characteristics and antigenic nature were
determined. This method of characterization is very time
consuming and is limited to culturable viruses (in established cell lines or readily available primary cells). Usually, because of the time and expense, this
characterization is limited to viruses that are associated
with an important disease. However, a large portion of
viruses are either unculturable, difficult to culture or are
not associated with a disease of importance to justify indepth characterization or development of reliable serological reagents. Even with culturable viruses, confirmative diagnosis is often not done because of a lack of
diagnostic antibodies or PCR assays. Therefore the development of broad spectrum diagnostic methods that obviate culture are needed as well as methods to bypass the
cumbersome traditional methods of characterizing culturable viruses. We addressed this need by using identified
sequence conservation between an important group of
viral pathogens, the large DNA viruses and adenoviruses.
Alignment of the amino acid sequences the DNA
polymerase of representatives of Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Herpesviridae, Iridoviridae, and Baculoviridae reveal
two regions that display a high level of conservation [1].
The upstream region showed two different contiguous
sequences of conservation with potential for degenerate
probe development with the adenoviruses grouping in
one, and the herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses and
baculoviruses grouping in the second. One downstream
conserved region was shared by all of the virus groups. We
designed degenerate primer sets using different upper
primers corresponding to the two upstream amino acid
sequences and a common lower degenerate primer corresponding to the downstream amino acid sequence. We
then validated the assay by using these primers to amplify
the fragment of the DNA polymerase gene from case isolates or infected tissues of Ictalurid herpesvirus 1(channel
catfish virus-CCV), two iridoviruses-lymphocystis disease
virus (LDV) and largemouth bass ranavirus (LBV), avian
adenoviruses and avian poxviruses. We were able to readily obtain the expected products from all of these viruses
except the avian poxviruses. In order to obtain the
sequence for the avian poxvirus, DNA extraction methods
were optimized and new primers were developed. The
poxvirus sequence was finally obtained and the difficulty
was likely due to secondary structure of the PCR product
and/or competition by aberrant products.

of DNA viruses of animals (herpesviridae, poxviridae,
adenoviridae and baculoviridae) had been aligned [1] and
two areas of conservation were identified. We analyzed
these regions in additional viruses including Ostreid herpesvirus 1, African swine fever, iridoviridae, an ascovirus,
and whitespot disease virus of shrimp. We were looking
for two highly conserved regions of consecutive amino
acids (aa), spaced 70 – 400 aa apart. This would allow the
design of degenerate PCR primers that would cover a large
number of viruses and yield a useful, easily amplified
product (large enough for sequence comparisons yet
small enough for efficient PCR). There was considerable
variation in the deduced amino acid sequences between
families. Several small regions of conservation were identified. Only one region with conservation of at least 5 consecutive amino acids was found among nearly all
sequences evaluated. This was the YGDTD sequence previously described [1]. The only differences among viruses
analyzed were a serine instead of the glycine at the second
amino acid of the Ascovirus and methionine, alanine
instead of tyrosine, glycine as the first two amino acids in
Ostreid herpesvirus 1. Approximately 400 to 700 bp
upstream of this region was a portion that was relatively
conserved in all of the virus groups except Adenoviridae
but a region approximately 1200 bp upstream within adenoviridae was conserved (Figure 1). Therefore we
designed one degenerate downstream primer to be used
for all large DNA viruses of vertebrates (Cons lower
primer-5'cccgaattcagatcTCNGTRTCNCCRTA3' N = A/C/
G/T, R = A/G) and two degenerate upstream primers, one
representing
Adenovirus
(Adeno
primer5'gggaattctaGAYATHTGYGGNATGTAYGC3' Y = T/C, H =
A/C/T) and the other based on herpesvirus sequences but
representing the other large DNA viruses of vertebrates
(HV primer-5'cggaattctaGAYTTYGCNWSNYTNTAYCC3' S
= C/G, W = A/T) (Figure 1). We added additional
sequence to the 5' ends to improve amplification properties with lower primer having 14 nucleotides (nt) of additional sequence and the upper primers having 10 nt of
additional sequences (indicated above by lowercase letters). The additional sequences also provided EcoRI and
BglII restriction enzyme recognition sites to the lower
primer and EcoRI and XbaI recognition sites to the upper
primers that could be used for cloning purposes. When
the amino acid sequences used to design the Adeno
primer and the cons lower primer were used together in
BLAST analysis against the GenBank non-redundant database, only adenovirus DNA polymerase genes were found
with substantial identity. When the amino acid sequences
used to design the HV primer and cons lower primer were
used together in BLAST analysis against the GenBank nonredundant database, a wide variety of DNA polymerase
genes were found to contain identical or nearly identical
sequences. These included the DNA polymerase genes of
the virus groups listed in figure 1 as well as a large number

of members of the Phycodnaviridae, Archea, plants, fungi,
ciliates, plasmodia, nematodes, echinoderms, insects, and
vertebrates. The vertebrate host tissues and cells represented the strongest potential source of unwanted PCR
products but the vertebrate DNA polymerase genes contain introns making the DNA polymerase products from
the host genomic DNA much larger than from viral
genomic DNA. The predicted PCR product from the
mouse genome would be 2622 nt [GenBank:NC_000073]
and for 3556 nt for Danio rerio [GenBank:NC_007114].
Application of primer sets to representative viruses
We tested the designed primer sets on avian and fish case
isolates representing the most common DNA viruses of

vertebrates that contain DNA polymerase genes: herpesviridae, iridoviridae, poxviridae and adenoviridae.
The DNA polymerase PCR was performed on three adenovirus isolates from infected chicken primary fibrobasts
using the Adeno and Cons lower primers. All three gave
strong single bands at the expected 1200 bp size (Figure
2A). Direct sequencing done on the excised products
using upper and lower primers respectively demonstrated
that the products of our chicken embryo lethal orphan
virus (CELO, fowl adenovirus 1) strain of Fowl adenovirus A, and case 162 were similar and case 1422 demonstrated some divergence from the other two. The products
were cloned and sequenced using vector primers and

internal sequencing primers to resolve the entire fragments. The sequences of the first two adenovirus samples
were identical to the published sequences of the represented region of CELO [GenBank:U46933]. The case 1422
isolate sequence [GenBank:DQ159938] was most similar
to the respective region of fowl adenovirus 9 strain of
Fowl adenovirus D [GenBank:AF083975] of adenovirus
DNA polymerases that had been sequenced. The 1145 nt
region between the primers showed 68.5% identity at the
nucleotide level and a corresponding 66.4% identity at
the amino acid level.
As a test for utility of DNA polymerase PCR on herpesvirus
samples, DNA was amplified from virus isolates from two
cases of diseased from blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus)
using the HV primer with the Cons lower primer. These
isolates were designated as "blue catfish virus" (BCV)
because they were shown to be herpesviruses by electron
microscopy and produced similar cytopathic effect on
CCO cells as CCV but would replicate in the Chinook
salmon embryo cell line (CHSE 214) where as CCV would
not. The DNA for these samples and the type isolate of
CCV were isolated from infected CCO cells. All three produced a distinct 465 bp band after DNA polymerase PCR
(Figure 2B lanes CCV and BCV represent type virus and
blue catfish isolate respectively). Cloning and sequencing
this fragment from the two blue catfish isolates [GenBank:DQ159941] demonstrated 100% nt identity
between each other and 97.7% nt identity to CCV (10 nt
difference in 439 nt) with 100% amino acid identity. This
suggests that the blue catfish isolate is a strain of CCV and
our data provides strong evidence for a broader host range
for CCV.
To test the utility of the primer set for Ranavirus genus of
the Iridoviridae, we used the HV-Cons lower primer set on
DNA from two isolates of largemouth bass ranavirus
(LBV). One was the type virus, the other was a case isolate
from a diseased largemouth bass in Mississippi. Both were
cultured on fathead minnow cells and both yielded 695
bp products (figure 2C-LBV). The PCR products of both
isolates were identical [GenBank:DQ159940]. No previous LBV DNA polymerase sequence had been submitted
to GenBank. The highest BLAST scores were to the DNA
polymerase genes of tiger frog virus [Genand
frog
virus
3
[GenBank:AAL77804.1]
Bank:AAT09720.1]. Simple alignment of the 641 nt
between the primers demonstrated 76.6% (491 nt) and
76.3% (490 nt) identity to tiger frog virus and frog virus 3
respectively. The deduced 213 aa sequence demonstrated
80.28% (171 aa) identity to each.
To test the utility of this assay for Lymphocystis disease
virus (LDV) genus of Iridoviridae and the use of this assay
directly on tissues, DNA was extracted from pathogno-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/28

monic lymphocystis disease lesion on the caudal fin of a
largemouth bass. The 662 bp product was amplified using
the HV primer with the Cons lower primer (figure 2C,
Lane LDV). Sequence analysis [GenBank:DQ159939]
demonstrated that the highest similarity of the 608 nt
region between the primers was the corresponding region
from a LDV isolated from flounder in China [GenBank:AY380826.1] with 75.16% (457 nt) identity. The
deduced 202 aa sequence demonstrated 77.7% (157 aa)
identity. In comparison the same region from LDV 1 from
flounder in North America [GenBank:L63545.1] demonstrated 70.68% nt identity and 69% deduced aa identity.
Our data suggests that the largemouth bass isolate of LDV
may be a different species from the two previously characterized LDV isolates.
To test the utility of the assay on Poxviridae we obtained
avian poxvirus isolates from quail and turkey. DNA samples extracted from infected chicken chorioallantoic
membrane tissue were used to performed the degenerate
PCR assays. We generated many different bands in these
assays (Figure 2D, lanes QPV and TPV for quail and turkey
isolates respectively) so two bands closest to the expected
600 bp these were re-amplified, cloned and sequenced.
BLAST analysis demonstrated that both of the sequences
were derived from chicken genomic DNA. To reduce host
genomic DNA contamination we filtered the tissue
homogenate through 0.45 µm filters and DNAse treated
the samples before nucleic acid extraction. These treatments greatly simplified the banding pattern (compare
Figure 2D with Figure 3A, lanes Qp and Tp were filtered
and Lanes Qd and Td were DNAse treated). Cloning and
sequencing of 3 bands all revealed fowl pox sequences but
none were the DNA polymerase gene. We theorized that
the problem may have been due to excessive mis-matches.
The Chordopoxvirinae upstream amino acid sequence was
DYNSLYP verses DFASLYP this would result in 3 nt mismatches at the 5' end of the upstream target. When we calculated the degeneracy required to cover Chordopoxvirnae,
and Herpesviridae, we would have a degeneracy of 32768,
which was excessive. However, if we made 8 separate
degenerate primers and combined them we could eliminate nucleotide combinations at the serine and leucine
encoding sites that do not encode the desired amino acid.
This resulted in a primer mixture with a degeneracy of
3456, lower than the HV primer. We tried the new primer
set. Cloning and sequencing of three bands close to the
expected 600 bp size revealed avipoxvirus sequences but
no DNA polymerase gene. We re-evaluated potential
primers for poxviruses. Alignment using Chordopoxvirinae
DNA polymerase aa sequences identified an alternative
upstream primer. The best contiguous sequence near the
previous upstream primer target was YCIHDAC. PCR

turkey isolates (figure 3B). This primer set generated the
expected band on nucleic acid extracts from the tissue, tissue homogenate that had been filtered and virus pelleted
and pelleted virus that was treated with DNAse before
extraction but not from control tissue. Figure 3 clearly
demonstrates the advantage of concentrating the virus

(pelleted and nuclease treated before extraction)]. The
DNA polymerase gene fragment product from the turkey
isolate was confirmed by sequencing. It exactly matched
that of fowlpox virus [GenBank:NC_002188].
Aberrant products that were sequenced during this
research generally provided only small regions of similarity to known DNA sequences, often having some similar-

ity to microsatellite sequences or to putative retrovirus
provirus sequences of various genomes. The most common of the aberrant products generated from the poxvirus
research was a portion of ORF FPV115 an Ankyrin repeat
gene family protein [2].

Discussion
The use of degenerate primers to DNA polymerase gene to
amplify a DNA fragment and identify the presence of
DNA viruses have been used by many researchers for specific research projects or to characterize a virus associated
with a specific disease. Also, the amino acid sequences of
DNA polymerase of many large DNA viruses have been
compared to evaluate virus relationships and compared to
the DNA polymerases of other organisms to hypothesize
the relationship and origin of this family of molecules[1,3,4]. The regions targeted with our degenerate
primers were identified by the original alignment of Ito
and Braitwaite [1] and overlap regions designated as
regions 2 and 4 by Villarreal et al [4]. VanDevanter et al [5]
used degenerate primers to the DNA polymerase gene of
mammalian and avian herpesviruses to identify unknown
herpesviruses and were successful in identifying gene
sequences of herpesviruses from several species of mammals. They were however, unsuccessful in amplifying the
DNA fragment from CCV and did not evaluate the utility
of there primers on other families of DNA viruses. Our
primers targeted similar regions as two of their primers.
Our HV primer targeted was similar to their DFA primer
targeting the DFASLYP sequence. The 3' (gene specific)
portion
of
our
sequence
being
compared
to
5'GAYTTYGCNWSNYTNTAYCC3'
5'GAYTTYGCNAGYYTNTAYCC3'. Their IYG downstream
primer targeted IYGDTDSV with the corresponding
degenerate
primer
being
5'CACAGAGTCCGTRTCNCCRTADAT3'. Our Cons lower
primer targeted YGDTD with the gene specific portion of
the degenerate primer being TCNGTRTCNCCRTA3'.
Ehlers et al [6] utilized similar primers as VanDevanter et
al [5] but they included deoxyinosines at sites with a
degeneracy of 3 or more. The differences in the primers
allows all codons for serine to be represented in the HV
primer and the narrower target of our cons lower primer
accounts for different amino acids flanking the YGDTD
sequence in non-herpesvirus targets. Our objective in this
study was to develop a broad spectrum method that could
be used to characterize most large DNA viruses including
those in which the virus type is poorly defined, those that
have not been cultured and those that come from a host
that is phylogenetically distant from the hosts of well
characterized members of the DNA viruses. This goal
necessitated the use primers with a high degree of degeneracy. Yet, most of the samples readily yielded the desired
products even when there were up to two nt mismatches
(with CCV). Our success is likely due to the high copy

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/28

number of viral genomes present on our DNA extracts.
The specific product yield was substantially increased
when the filtration step, virus concentration and DNase
treatment were added to the tissue/cell extraction procedure. We believe that these steps substantially reduced the
complexity of the target and improved the efficiency of the
degenerate primer PCR.
We chose to use generic primer sets with more degeneracy
rather than family specific primer sets because they would
be more readily used in a diagnostic environment. The use
of limited generic primer sets allows for the application of
the assay before the disease agent is as extensively characterized. The use of generic primers has the added advantage of covering most known variants, this minimizes the
effect of unique species-specific sequences within a "conserved" region that often occur in virus families. We demonstrated the utility of our assay on defined virus isolates
and virus samples that had not been characterized of four
families of DNA viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the methodology was directly applicable to infected
tissues. The PCR products generated from this assay are
sufficiently long for detailed sequence comparison and for
the development of specific PCR primers for diagnostic
and research applications.
Our difficulty in generating a fragment from the poxvirus
sample was unexpected because the degenerate primers
were matched to that sequence. The alternate primer set
worked very well and because the secondary structure may
cause similar problem with poxviruses the use of the pox
specific primer set may be warranted when a poxvirus is
suspected. In the process of optimizing the procedure for
the poxviruses, we found that the use of DNAse treatment
of the tissue/cell homogenate before DNA extraction
greatly improved the specificity of the assay. Even with the
poxvirus, the primer sets that did not amplify the DNA
polymerase did amplify poxvirus sequences and sequence
analysis of non-targeted sequences may be of use in characterizing a newly discovered virus. The use of nuclease
treatment in conjunction with sequence independent single primer amplification has been very successful for identifying unknown viruses in serum samples [7]. The
advantage of using degenerate PCR is that the product
obtained is a fragment of a specific gene, which simplifies
comparisons to known orthologs for phylogenetic placement of the virus.
The assay that we developed is being quickly adapted in
fish virology community to evaluate suspected cases of
virus infected tissues or to characterized culturable
viruses. The primers were successfully used to amplify the
DNA polymerase gene products from 3 cyprinid herpesviruses, [8,9](personal communication Janet Warg, Diagnostic Virology Laboratory, National Veterinary Services

Laboratories, Ames, Iowa). This assay has been used to
characterize 7 herpesviruses from sturgeon [10].

Conclusion
In this report, we use a defined region of a gene common
to all large DNA viruses to develop a general diagnostic
method that is broadly applicable to a wide spectrum of
viruses. We demonstrated the utility of this system on cell
culture isolates and on infected tissues of four major
groups of DNA viruses; the Poxviridae, Herpesviridae,
Adenoviridae and Iridoviridae. Although the assay was
applied to a small sample of the viruses (1–3 examples per
group), they represented diverse virus families and
included up to 2 amino acid mismatches in the upstream
target region. Success by other laboratories and amino
acid sequence analysis of DNA polymerases of other
members of these groups supports the broad applicability
of this assay to the large DNA viruses and adenoviruses of
vertebrates. The Phycodnaviridae found in algae, Baculoviridae and Ascoviridae found in arthropods and the herpesviruses of mollusks should also be amenable to this
procedure with modified primers. This assay will not work
on RNA viruses and DNA virus types that do not have a
DNA dependant DNA polymerase gene such as Hepadnaviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae and
Polyomaviridae. We demonstrated the benefit of using
the defined region for matching case isolates to species
that have been previously sequenced and demonstrated a
useful scenario for identifying species of which the DNA
polymerase gene have not been previously sequenced. As
this target fragment of more species of DNA viruses are
sequenced, BLAST and GenBank will prove to be a utilitarian software and database for virus diagnostic work that is
readily available to all diagnostic and research laboratories. The advantages of the selected target for diagnostic
use are: it is sufficiently small that the product can be efficiently generated, yet, there are regions that are highly
conserved allowing general placement of unknown
viruses into families and there are regions of sufficient variation to allow the development of specific PCR primers.
The use of DNAse pretreatment in the extraction protocol
simplified the substrate and to allow effective amplification even with highly degenerate primers.
Our optimized protocol is: 1. Disrupt the cells/tissue to
release the virions. 2. Pellet the cellular debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. 3. Filter the supernatant
through a 0.45 µm filter. 4. Concentrate the virus from the
filtrate by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min. 5.
Resuspend the pellet in a small volume of water and
DNase treat the suspension to reduce cellular DNA. 5.
Extract the DNA. 6. Run degenerate PCR. 7. clone predominant bands of the appropriate sizes (450–800 bp for
the HV primer and 1200 bp for the Adenovirus primer). 8.
Sequence the products and use BLASTx to compare the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/28

translated sequence to deduced amino acid sequences in
GenBank. Variations that are helpful are (1) to use larger
amounts of cells or tissues in samples that are suspected
of having low numbers of virions and (2) to run a negative
control of non-infected tissue when multiple weak bands
are produced to distinguish cellular products from virus
product candidates.

Methods
Virus sources
All diagnostic case samples were submitted to the Mississippi State University, College of Veterinary Medicine
Diagnostic Laboratory. Virus isolates were obtained from
infected diagnostic samples by homogenizing the tissues
in serum free medium (SFM) or tryptose phosphate broth
(TPB) at the rate of approximately 1 part tissue to 5 parts
TPB (vol:vol), passed through a 0.20 µm filter, and diluted
1:10 (vol:vol) in SFM or TPB containing penicillin (100
units/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml).

Avian samples were inoculated onto 24-hour-old monolayers of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells or onto the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of embryonated eggs.
For CAM culture, eleven-day-old embryonated eggs from
a commercial specific-pathogen free (SPF) source (HyVac, Inc., Gowrie, IO) were inoculated via the CAM route
using 0.2 ml of the antibiotic-treated sample/egg. The eggs
were sealed, incubated at 37°C, and candled daily. Those
eggs containing live embryos 6 days later, were opened
and the CAMs in the area of inoculation were examined.
CAMs containing plaques or similarly-suspicious lesions
were harvested and pieces placed into McDowell's fixative
for histological examination. The rest of the affected
membranes were held frozen (-60°C). Histological evaluation identified CAM samples as avian poxvirus-infected
when epithelial hyperplasia and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions were demonstrated [11]. Inoculated
CEK cells were observed daily. At 2, 4, and 6 days postinoculation (PI), aliquots of cells and supernatant were harvested and frozen at -70°C. These aliquots were pooled
and served as subsequent inocula for two additional 6-day
passages. Harvests from any passage showing evidence of
"round-cell" cytopathology were tested against adenovirus-specific antiserum (SPAFAS, Inc., Norwich, Conn.) in
an agar-gel precipitin (AGP) test. Avian poxvirus isolate
4905 was from a quail in 1984 and isolate M6959 from a
wild turkey near Jackson Mississippi in 1989. The avian
adenovirus isolates, were chicken embryo lethal orphan
(CELO) virus that was used as the positive control for the
AGP test, case isolates 162 and 1422b were from diseased
chickens in commercial broiler operations in Mississippi
in 2002.
Channel catfish virus was either the type strain (Auburn
clone A-American Type Culture Collection) or from diag-

nostic cases S98-675 and S98-697 from diseased blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus from a commercial catfish
production pond near Inverness, Mississippi in 1998.
Virus was propagated by infecting monolayers of channel
catfish ovary cell line at approximately 0.1 plaque forming
units per cell and freezing the cells and medium when the
entire cell sheet was involved in cytopathic effect (CPE).
Largemouth bass virus (LMBV) case isolate was from a diseased largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) found in a
private use pond near Brandon, Mississippi (case C01170) in 2001. The type specimen was from the first
described case of LMBV from the Santee-Cooper reservoir,
South Carolina [12] and was provided by Dr. V. Greg
Chinchar (University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson MS). Both were cultured on the Fathead Minnow
(FHM) cell line. The lymphocystis disease virus sample
was extracted from fin lesions from largemouth bass with
lymphocystis disease (case C02-033, found in a commercial catfish production pond near West Point, Mississippi
in 2002).
Sample preparation
Virus from infected cell cultures in 25 cm2 flasks were
released from the cells by serial freeze thaw cycles, the
debris was centrifuged out at 1000 × g for 5 min then virus
was concentrated out of the supernatant by centrifugation
at 21,000 × g for 30 min in a microfuge. The pellet was
suspended in 80 µl of water. When tissues were evaluated,
the DNA was either extracted directly from a 50 mg tissue
sample or virus was concentrated from the sample. This
was done by homogenizing approximately 200 mg of the
tissue sample in 2.25 ml of serum free cell culture
medium, centrifuging the sample at 1000 × g for 5 min
and concentrating the virus out of the supernatant as
described above. The filtration variation to the protocol
involved filtering the supernatant of the 1000 × g centrifugation step with a 0.45 µm syringe filter then proceeding
to the virus concentration step. The DNase variation on
the protocol involved adding 20 µl of 10 × buffer and 100
µl of RQ1 DNAse (Promega) to the 80 µl of concentrated
virus and incubating it at 37°C for 2 hours. This was followed by the addition of 20 µl of stop buffer (20 mM
EGTA, pH 8.0) and a 10 min incubation at 65°C to inactivate the DNAse. DNA was isolated using Puregene
genomic DNA isolation system (Gentra, Minneapolis,
MN). The sample was suspended in 600 µl Puregene cell
lysis solution containing 60 µg proteinase K, incubated
overnight at 50°C then the DNA was isolated according to
the manufacture's suggested procedure. DNA was quantitated using UV spectrophotometry (GeneSpec I, Hitachi
Software Engineering Company LTD, Japan).
Degenerate PCR and cloning
PCR consisted of approximately 100 ng of template DNA,
20 pmole of each primer, 4 µl 10 mM dNTP, 5 µl 10 ×

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/28

buffer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase mix (Fisher Scientific) in 50
µl reactions. PCR used the appropriate forward primer
and the consensus reverse primer (Figure 1). The reaction
conditions were: 93°C, 1 min for one cycle followed by
93°C, 30 sec; 45°C, 2 min; 72°C 3 min for 35 cycles followed by a single cycle at 72°C for 4 min. Product was
evaluated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels followed by staining with GelStar nucleic acid gel stain (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) and UV
transillumination (ChemiImager 5500, Alpha Innotech
Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Bands of interest were
excised from the gel and the DNA was recovered using
GenElute Agarose Spin Columns (Supelco, Bellefonte,
PA). The product was cloned into plasmid pT7blue using
the Perfectly Blunt Cloning Kit (Novagen) or the plasmid
pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen).
Selected candidate clones were evaluated for a DNA insert
of the appropriate size using colony PCR (as described in
the Perfectly Blunt or TOPO TA cloning kit). Then plasmid
was purified for sequencing from 1 ml cultures using the
QIAQUIK plasmid purification kit (Qiagen).
Sequencing
PCR products from all virus samples except the adenovirus isolates were cloned and then sequenced. Sequencing
was performed on both strands of at least three clones
from each product using vector specific forward and
reverse sequencing primers in with the ABI PRISM™ Big
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and by the use of
the ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). A modification of this was the use of direct
sequencing of the Adenovirus PCR product using 500 ng
of template excised from an agarose gel and 3.2 pmole of
upper or lower primer, respectively. Additional sequencing was done on cloned PCR products from the adenovirus samples using vector specific forward and reverse
sequencing primers, a lower strand
primerACGATTTSAGTGCCTTCGTAGATG and a upper strand
primer-CATCTACGAAGGCACTSAAATCGT. Data were
assembled using MacDNASIS and sequences were edited
by manual comparison of overlapping electropherograms
(Version 3.7, Hitachi Software Engineering America, Ltd.,
South San Francisco, CA). The DNA sequence data were
analyzed and amino acid sequences deduced using MacDNASIS. Related amino acid sequences were identified
using BLASTx [13]. ClustalX [14] was used to align the
deduced amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase
fragment.
