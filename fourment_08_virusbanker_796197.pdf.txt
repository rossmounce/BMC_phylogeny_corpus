Abstract
Background: Viruses of the Bunyaviridae have segmented negative-stranded RNA genomes and
several of them cause significant disease. Many partial sequences have been obtained from the
segments so that GenBank searches give complex results. Sequence databases usually use HTML
pages to mediate remote sorting, but this approach can be limiting and may discourage a user from
exploring a database.
Results: The VirusBanker database contains Bunyaviridae sequences and alignments and is
presented as two spreadsheets generated by a Java program that interacts with a MySQL database
on a server. Sequences are displayed in rows and may be sorted using information that is displayed
in columns and includes data relating to the segment, gene, protein, species, strain, sequence length,
terminal sequence and date and country of isolation. Bunyaviridae sequences and alignments may be
downloaded from the second spreadsheet with titles defined by the user from the columns, or
viewed when passed directly to the sequence editor, Jalview.
Conclusion: VirusBanker allows large datasets of aligned nucleotide and protein sequences from
the Bunyaviridae to be compiled and winnowed rapidly using criteria that are formulated
heuristically.

Background
Virus sequence databases are known for their well-organized interfaces and search systems; important examples
include the Influenza Virus Resource of GenBank [1], the
Viral Bioinformatics Resource Centre of the Universities of
Victoria and of Alabama at Birmingham [2], and the HIV,
influenza and Hepatitis C databases of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory [3]. These databases allow a user to
use quite complex search criteria to define large datasets of
sequences. In almost all of these databases records are represented on webpages and selections are made using
standard webpage menus and check boxes. Sorting proc-

esses are done through calls to a database on a server. The
use of web-pages, however, has some disadvantages: a
user cannot build a dataset in successive steps, where
some sequences are added and others are deleted, and
check-boxes are slow to use. As a result a user may be discouraged from exploring the database and may fail to
identify some sequences they wish to include or exclude,
or they may choose not to use the database to fully define
the dataset but instead use downstream editing software
to check and refine it.

Construction and content

The VirusBanker program directly connects with the open
source sequence editor Jalview [4]. Sequences and alignments may be passed from the second spreadsheet to the
editor, so that Jalview's phylogenetic, clustering and alignment functions are immediately accessible. Sequence sets
may also be downloaded in FASTA or NBRF/PIR formats.
Nucleotide sequences that match the coding sequences in
GenBank (cds and ORFs) are identified automatically and
are also available. VirusBanker provides a link to a web
page for querying sequences using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against precompiled nucle-

Once the user has saved a selection of sequences to the
second spreadsheet, the same range of selection and sorting operations are available. Individual sequences or sets
of sequences may be moved to the second spreadsheet or
deleted from it, without a call to the database. The aim of
the approach is to permit a user to rapidly explore the
database, and create the selection criteria while learning
about the features of the virus sequences and so better
refine the dataset. A third spreadsheet is available to display sequences uploaded by the user, which is useful, for
example, to review the related GenBank records or to
identify the protein sequences encoded by nucleotide
sequences. These operations are possible after the user has
manually cross matched the GI numbers of the uploaded
sequences with the GI numbers held in VirusBanker. The
Java program and database software have been tested with
a dataset of more than 40,000 sequences: no difficulties
were experienced except for slight delays in sorting processes.

Systems and methods
In the VirusBanker database, an alternative programmatic
approach has been used. VirusBanker consists of a Java client-server program (Figure 1) that generates an interface
consisting of three spreadsheets. The sequence characteristics required for sorting are loaded from a MySQL database on a server when the program is launched. The
program does not call the server during a sorting operation, but only when a set is selected and saved to the second spread sheet, or downloaded, or the user changes
between viewing protein and nucleic acid sequence data.
Sequences are represented as rows that may be scrolled
through. A user can choose from a menu of 16 characteristics that once selected are represented as columns.
Sequence records are sorted alphabetically or numerically
by clicking the column titles. Sets of sequences are
selected by clicking and dragging the cursor, and saving
the selected sequences to a second spreadsheet. A click on
the Geninfo Identifier number (GI) opens the record from
GenBank in a web browser. A series of drop-down menus
may also be used to define a sequence set or search for a
particular sequence by accession code or GI number.

identify newly sequenced virus isolates or to identify
closely related sequences within the database.
Database content
The Bunyaviridae consists of five genera: Orthobunyavirus,
Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, Tospovirus and Hantavirus. The
viruses have enveloped virions and single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes that consist of small (S),

medium (M) and large (L) segments, comprising from
11000 to 28000 bases of sequence in total, and encoding
four to six proteins. Viruses from the family that cause significant disease include Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [6]
that spreads in people and livestock in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus
(CCHFV) [7] that spreads in Africa, eastern Europe and
Asia, and Hantavirus [8,9], that spreads in the Americas,
eastern Europe, and eastern Asia. Fatality rates as high as
50% may be suffered during outbreaks of disease caused
by RVFV and CCHFV. One unusual aspect of the family is
that it includes a genus of plant viruses: Tospovirus.
Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV), the best known
of these plant viruses, is a significant crop pathogen [10].
Most viruses from the family also infect arthropods that
act as vectors. Most of the vertebrate-infecting members of
the family are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or phlebotomine flies. Tospoviruses are transmitted by thrips.
Hantaviruses are mainly transmitted in aerosols. Transovarial and venereal transmission has been demonstrated
for some species.
The characteristics used in the Bunyaviridae VirusBanker
database are those often used in studies of virus sequences
and include the genus, species, strain, host and country
names, collection dates, and gene and protein names. Protein sequences were those identified in GenBank and protein sequence names were curated for consistency. A
customized pipeline consisting of a set of Java interfaces
was used to create, curate and update the database. The
original data was retrieved from GenBank using the ENTREZ Programming Utilities (eUtils), then it was parsed
with a Java program and manually curated. Species names
were obtained from the most recent publication of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [11]
using Perl scripts. The database program has been running
for 3 years and has been used by biologists and bioinformaticians. The Bunyaviridae database is updated every 6
months or upon a user's request and is the program is frequently updated.
Proteins and nucleotide alignments used in the Bunyaviridae VirusBanker database were generated using MUSCLE
[12]. The first and last 10 residues of the sequences and
sequence lengths are also provided as characters, which is
useful since the Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus,
Tospovirus and Hantavirus have different conserved terminal sequences [11], and although the majority of the
nucleotide and protein sequences in the database are
incomplete many them have matching terminal subsequences. The source and definition fields from GenBank
are recorded as separate columns in VirusBanker to provide further taxonomic information. More information
on hosts and vectors is available from another database

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/83

[13] and this should be used in the future, but at present
too few sequence records are linked to such data.

Utility and discussion
The routine use of reverse transcription PCR and sequencing to detect and characterise RNA viruses has led to a dramatic increase in the number of full and partial genomic
sequences submitted to the primary public databases.
However, building coherent and complete datasets from
the public databases has become increasingly difficult
because of the large number of sequences and the lack of
consistency in their annotation. Researchers sometimes
use incorrect or unofficial species names and different
names for homologous genes and proteins. Very useful
databases have been created for well known viruses such
as HIV and influenza, but less attention has been given to
the Bunyaviridae and other virus groups. The Viral Orthologous Cluster database, which was based on the Poxivirus
Orthologous Clusters database [14], also uses a Java client-server application and contains data from the Bunyaviridae and it appears to be designed for analysing
complete genomes. The Virus Orthologous Cluster database is limited to 981 full segment sequences, it does not
offer aligned sequences, but rather offers to align selected
sequences, and it does not provide easy access to the terminal sequences nor contain information on the host and
location of isolation.

Conclusion
We have created a database containing 3958 nucleotide
sequences and 4267 protein sequence from the Bunyaviridae that were released in GenBank before September
2007. By providing a spreadsheet of the data that is available in GenBank and from the ICTV, VirusBanker allows
users to quickly define large and coherent datasets with
fairly complex criteria and in this way it may speed up the
analysis of these important viruses. Some operations are
faster with VirusBanker than with equivalent HTML pages:
including or excluding sequences from a subset, reversing
such an operation, ordering and reordering sequences,
and switching between spreadsheets. The speed with
which these operations can be done encourages the user
to refine datasets using VirusBanker rather than some
downstream editing software.
