Abstract
Background: Plastid-bearing cryptophytes like Cryptomonas contain four genomes in a cell, the
nucleus, the nucleomorph, the plastid genome and the mitochondrial genome. Comparative
phylogenetic analyses encompassing DNA sequences from three different genomes were
performed on nineteen photosynthetic and four colorless Cryptomonas strains. Twenty-three rbcL
genes and fourteen nuclear SSU rDNA sequences were newly sequenced to examine the impact
of photosynthesis loss on codon usage in the rbcL genes, and to compare the rbcL gene phylogeny
in terms of tree topology and evolutionary rates with phylogenies inferred from nuclear ribosomal
DNA (concatenated SSU rDNA, ITS2 and partial LSU rDNA), and nucleomorph SSU rDNA.
Results: Largely congruent branching patterns and accelerated evolutionary rates were found in
nucleomorph SSU rDNA and rbcL genes in a clade that consisted of photosynthetic and colorless
species suggesting a coevolution of the two genomes. The extremely accelerated rates in the rbcL
phylogeny correlated with a shift from selection to mutation drift in codon usage of two-fold
degenerate NNY codons comprising the amino acids asparagine, aspartate, histidine, phenylalanine,
and tyrosine. Cysteine was the sole exception. The shift in codon usage seemed to follow a gradient
from early diverging photosynthetic to late diverging photosynthetic or heterotrophic taxa along
the branches. In the early branching taxa, codon preferences were changed in one to two amino
acids, whereas in the late diverging taxa, including the colorless strains, between four and five amino
acids showed changes in codon usage.
Conclusion: Nucleomorph and plastid gene phylogenies indicate that loss of photosynthesis in the
colorless Cryptomonas strains examined in this study possibly was the result of accelerated
evolutionary rates that started already in photosynthetic ancestors. Shifts in codon usage are
usually considered to be caused by changes in functional constraints and in gene expression levels.
Thus, the increasing influence of mutation drift on codon usage along the clade may indicate
gradually relaxed constraints and reduced expression levels on the rbcL gene, finally correlating
with a loss of photosynthesis in the colorless Cryptomonas paramaecium strains.

Background
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase
(RuBisCO) plays a key role in the photosynthetic Calvin
cycle as the carbon dioxide fixating enzyme [1,2]. The
most common type of RuBisCO, form I RuBisCO, is
found in Viridiplantae, cyanobacteria (green-like
RuBisCO), in most non-green algae, and some proteobacteria (red-like RuBisCO) [3]. Eight large subunits and an
equal number of small subunits make up a functional
holoenzyme of form I RuBisCO [1]. Their genes, rbcL and
rbcS, are plastid-encoded and co-transcribed in non-green
algae, whereas in the Viridiplantae, rbcS was transferred to
the nucleus and evolved to a multi-gene family [3,4]. To
compensate for its inefficient and slow catalytic mechanism, RuBisCO is usually expressed at high rates in plastids, making it "the most abundant protein in the world"
[5]. Surprisingly, in some colorless algae and holoparasitic land plants, functional RuBisCO was found [6,7].
One possible explanation for a function of RuBisCO outside of the Calvin cycle was reported only recently. In
developing Brassica napus seeds, RuBisCO recycles CO2
that was released in the pyruvate dehydrogenase step prior
to fatty-acid biosynthesis [8].
Cryptophyte algae are flagellates with complex plastids
originating from a secondary endosymbiosis between a
phagotrophic host cell and a red alga [9]. The cryptophyte
plastid consists of two nested compartments, each with its
own genome (nucleomorph in the periplastidial space
between inner and outer pairs of plastid membranes and
plastid genome) [9,10]. Cryptophytes of the genus Cryptomonas thrive exclusively in freshwater habitats [11]. The
leukoplast-bearing freshwater cryptophytes were formerly
considered a separate genus Chilomonas, but have been
shown in phylogenetic analyses to be colorless Cryptomonas cells; the diagnosis of the genus Cryptomonas was
emended accordingly [11]. In previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, accelerated evolutionary rates in either
nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal transcribed spacer 2
[ITS2] and partial LSU ribosomal DNA [LSU rDNA]) or
nucleomorph SSU ribosomal DNA sequences were found
in three independently evolved colorless Cryptomonas lineages and in closely related photosynthetic strains [12].
Accelerated evolutionary rates are usually considered
indicative for relaxed selective constraints and were also
found in rbcL genes of land plants [13,14]. Previous studies have shown that relaxed selective constraints and different levels of gene expression in protein-coding genes
correlate with biases in codon usage [15,16]. Possibly, by
preferring the so-called "major codons" in highly
expressed genes, the efficiency of the translation process is
increased [17]. The differences in codon usage between
highly and lowly expressed genes are most obvious for
two-fold degenerate NNY codons, i.e. pairs of triplets that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/56

code for the same amino acid with either C or T(U) at
third positions. In highly expressed genes, NNC is preferred over NNT in most two-fold degenerate NNY
codons, whereas the codon preference reverses, if functional constraints are relaxed and expression levels
decrease [16,18]. Under neutral mutation, DNA displays
a strong bias towards increased A+T contents. Such a
genome compositional bias has been found also in endosymbiotic or organellar genomes [9,19,20]. Thus, in twofold degenerate NNY codons, codon bias due to selection
operates in opposite direction to genome compositional
bias [16].
In this study, we compare the phylogeny of the rbcL gene
as a representative for the plastid genome to phylogenies
of nuclear rDNA (concatenated SSU rDNA, ITS2 and partial LSU rDNA) and nucleomorph SSU rDNA. To obtain a
congruent taxon sampling across the three genomes of all
strains, twenty-three rbcL genes and fourteen nuclear SSU
rDNA genes were newly sequenced. As putative indicators
for differences of functional constraints and expression
levels in the rbcL genes, codon usages of two-fold degenerate NNY codons were compared among photosynthetic
and colorless Cryptomonas species.

Results
Results of the phylogenetic analyses
Both ribosomal data sets passed the chi-square test for
homogeneity of base frequencies across taxa, whereas the
rbcL data set failed the test (Additional file 1). After exclusion of third codon positions, the rbcL data set passed the
test, indicating that the heterogeneity of base frequencies
was restricted to third codon positions. This became also
obvious by separate computation of mean values and
standard deviations of base frequencies for first, second
and third codon positions across all twenty-three taxa.
The second codon position was most homogeneous concerning standard deviations (A: 27.8 ± 0.3%; C: 21.4 ±
0.4%; G: 19.9 ± 0.4%; T: 30.9 ± 0.3%), the first codon
position had an intermediate position (A: 24.6 ± 1.0%; C:
17.8 ± 1.4, G: 38.9 ± 0.7, T: 18.7 ± 1.1), whereas the third
codon position was most heterogeneous (A: 29.0 ± 2.6%;
C: 16.1 ± 4.6%; G: 10.3 ± 3.8%; T: 44.6 ± 3.2%). Phylogenetic analyses with bootstrap resampling under all optimality criteria and a Bayesian analysis, however, showed
that despite of an obvious bias, these positions contributed the most to the support of the clades in the rbcL data
set. This was confirmed by separate phylogenetic analyses
of first, second and third codon positions (Additional file
1). The highly conserved rbcL protein sequences consistently failed to recover three clades that were otherwise
highly supported in all DNA sequence data sets (Cryptomonas marssonii, C. ovata and C. pyrenoidifera), because
phylogenetic information was predominantly based on
synonymous substitutions. Therefore, we used the rbcL

with the nuclear and nucleomorph ribosomal DNA phylogenies (Figure 1A to 1C).
Almost all Cryptomonas clades were unequivocally recovered with significant or at least moderate support in
nuclear, nucleomorph and plastid gene trees (Figure 1A to

ovata (Cov), C. paramaecium (colorless strains; Cpa), C.

pyrenoidifera (Cpy), and C. tetrapyrenoidosa (Cte; clades
named according to Hoef-Emden and Melkonian 2003).
C. borealis (Cbo) was significantly supported in nuclear
and nucleomorph phylogenies but not in all phylogenetic
analyses in the rbcL phylogeny (Figure 1C). Significant
support for this clade, however, was found in the rbcL protein phylogeny apparently due to nonsynonymous substitutions (tree not shown; for support values, see Additional

The entries for the rbcL genes in Table 1 refer to absolute counts per 396 amino acids (= 1188 nucleotide positions). Also for the Guillardia theta
rbcL gene only the corresponding 396 of the 488 codons were used. The plastid of G. theta contains genes for 30 tRNAs [10]. Only the NNC
codons (underlined) are served by an exactly matching tRNA. As a code table, the eubacterial/plastid code was used (code table 11). Bold face,
changed codon usage from NNC to NNU = shift from selection bias to genome composition bias.

highly supported in nuclear and nucleomorph phylogenies, could not be resolved in the rbcL phylogeny (Figure
1C).
In all phylogenies, C. borealis, C. gyropyrenoidosa and C.
lundii formed a "super-clade" together with the colorless
C. paramaecium (termed clade LB for long-branch in [11];
Figure 1A to 1C). Only in the nucleomorph SSU rDNA
tree, however, convincing support for clade LB was found
(Figure 1B). In the nucleomorph SSU rDNA and rbcL phylogenies, representing the two genomes of the complex
plastid, evolutionary rates and topologies of the strains in
clade LB resembled each other. In both phylogenies, evolutionary rates were extremely accelerated in clade LB, and
the branching pattern was similar, except for the position
of C. gyropyrenoidosa, which was a sister to C. lundii in the
nucleomorph SSU rDNA (but without bootstrap support), but not in the rbcL phylogeny (where it was the first

divergence). In the nuclear-encoded ribosomal DNA phylogeny, predominantly the strains of clade NoPyr displayed increased evolutionary rates, whereas evolutionary
rates were less pronounced in C. borealis and C. paramaecium of clade LB (Figure 1A). In clade NoPyr, an acceleration of evolutionary rates was also present to a lesser
extent in the nucleomorph SSU rDNA; in the rbcL phylogeny, however, branch lengths of this clade were inconspicuous (Figure 1B and 1C).
In Figure 1D, the phylogenetic trees of Figure 1A to 1C
were scaled to the same substitution rate and in Figure 2,
the maximum likelihood distances of C. pyenoidifera
strain M1077 to the other taxa were plotted in a chart diagram for a direct comparison of genetic divergences.
Among the three data sets, the rbcL data displayed generally the highest substitution rates and genetic distances. In
the nucleomorph SSU rDNA, the evolutionary rates of C.

gyropyrenoidosa, C. borealis and C. paramaecium were in an
intermediate position. Apparently, evolutionary rates in
clade LB increased successively from host to nucleomorph
to plastid genome.
Codon usage analysis
In Table 1, the codon usages of the six amino acids with
two-fold degenerate NNY codons (asparagine, histidine,
aspartate, tyrosine, cysteine and phenylalanine) are listed
in absolute counts computed from the 396 codons that
were included in the phylogenetic analyses. Cysteine was
exceptional in codon usage in that it mostly showed a
preference for UGU over UGC, thus it will not be further
discussed (Table 1). For the remaining five amino acids,
NNC codons were always preferred over NNU codons in
C. marssonii, C. pyrenoidifera, C. tetrapyrenoidosa and in
clade NoPyr (Table 1). In all strains of clade LB, on the
other hand, indications for a change of codon usage were
found, although to different extent. In almost all strains of
C. paramaecium (except for histidine in strain CCAP 977/
1) and C. borealis (except for asparagine in strain SCCAP
K-0063) codon preferences were inversed from NNC to
NNU for these amino acids (Table 1). C. lundii and C.
gyropyrenoidosa were in an intermediate position concerning codon usages. In C. lundii only in two amino
acids, aspartate and tyrosine, codon usage was inversed to
prefer GAU over GAC (aspartate) and UAU over UAC
(tyrosine), whereas in C. gyropyrenoidosa only one
amino acid, aspartate, was affected (Table 1). Inversed
codon usages were also found in two clades that were not
part of LB, C. curvata (histidine and aspartate in strain
CCAC 0080, aspartate in strain CCAC 0006) and C. ovata
(aspartate and tyrosine; Table 1). In the three phylogenies,
C. ovata displayed slightly increased evolutionary rates in
nucleomorph SSU rDNA and rbcL phylogenies, whereas
C. curvata had slightly longer branches only in the nuclear
ribosomal DNA phylogeny (Figure 1A to 1C).

Discussion
Lineage-specific parallel evolution across three genomes in
Cryptomonas
Most of the Cryptomonas clades were recovered with high
support values in phylogenies of the concatenated nuclear
ribosomal DNA sequences (SSU rDNA, ITS2 and partial
LSU rDNA), of the nucleomorph SSU rDNA and of the
plastid-encoded rbcL gene, but obvious differences in evolutionary rates among the different clades and genomes
were displayed.

In the "super-clade" LB, consisting of three photosynthetic (C. borealis, C. gyropyrenoidosa and C. lundii) and one
heterotrophic Cryptomonas species (C. paramaecium),
largely congruent branching patterns and extreme evolutionary rates in the nucleomorph and plastid gene phylogenies suggested coevolution under similar selective

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/56

constraints, as if the two genomes of the complex plastid
were a genetic unit in this clade. In the nuclear ribosomal
DNA phylogeny, an increase in evolutionary rates was in
part also present but less pronounced. Support for this
clade was low in the nuclear ribosomal DNA phylogeny,
although several parts of the nuclear ribosomal operon
were concatenated to improve resolution (the nuclear SSU
rDNA alone failed to recover clade LB, but increased evolutionary rates in C. paramaecium and C. borealis were
more pronounced than in the concatenated data set; not
shown).
In a different clade, that also consists of photosynthetic
and colorless Cryptomonas taxa, clade NoPyr, the situation
was reversed; coevolution with increased evolutionary
rates seemed to have taken place in the nuclear and nucleomorph genes [12], whereas no acceleration of evolutionary rates could be observed in the rbcL gene phylogeny
(this study). We did not obtain an rbcL PCR product, however, from the colorless strains of clade NoPyr [[12], this
study].
Cho et al. [21] demonstrated that extremely accelerated
evolutionary rates were present in three mitochondrial
genes (two protein-coding genes, cox1, atp1, and one
RNA-coding gene, rrn16, the gene for the SSU rDNA in
mitochondria) in the flowering plant genus Plantago, but
not in plastid or nuclear genes of the same taxa. We chose
two RNA-coding genes and a protein-coding gene as representatives for three of the four genomes in Cryptomonas.
Despite their differing functions, the phylogenetic trees
suggested that at least two (clade NoPyr), or even all three
genomes (clade C. borealis and C. paramaecium) may have
evolved in parallel under similar selective constraints or
by interacting with each other.
Evidence for relaxed functional constraints on RNA- or
protein-coding genes
Possible explanations for accelerated evolutionary rates of
DNA sequences include relaxation or loss of functional
constraints due to either changes in mode of nutrition,
adaptations to new environmental conditions, genetic
bottlenecks or obligate asexuality [22-25]. Endosymbiotic, parasitic and organellar genomes are notorious for
high A+T contents in their genomes likely caused by
biased substitution rates under neutral mutational pressure [19,20,26,27]. Minimum amounts of G and C are
required to maintain the codon information for a functional protein or to preserve the secondary structure of an
RNA. Depending on the strengths of the functional constraints, the resulting selection bias may differ from the
genome composition bias to varying degrees (reviewed
for protein-coding genes in [16]). Thus, lineage-specific
relaxed selective constraints may be identified by increases
in A+T content.

This notion is supported by the observation that the
nucleomorph SSU rRNA genes in clade LB accumulate
mononucleotide repeats of A and T in highly variable
regions [11,12]. In functional protein-coding genes, the
triplet structure constrains mutation rates by selection.
Synonymous substitutions do not replace amino acids,
thus are more likely to occur than nonsynonymous substitutions. In previous studies, however, also synonymous
substitutions were reported to be skewed towards specific
codons in correlation with expression levels of the respective protein [15,28,29]. The codon biases were explained
as a result of a competition between selection and genome
compositional bias [17]. In highly expressed genes,
codons with abundant or perfectly matching tRNAs
(major codons) are apparently preferred over codons are
translated by rare or "wobbling" tRNAs (minor codons)
[29,30]. In plastid genomes, usually only 30 to 31 tRNAs
are available to translate all 61 codons (in the Guillardia
theta plastome, 30 tRNAs were found) [10,16]. In twofold degenerate NNY codons, the preferred major codon
in highly expressed genes is usually NNC, thus codon bias
due to selection can be comparably easily distinguished
from codon bias due to mutation drift [16,18]. Among the
six amino acids with two-fold degenerate codons (asparagine, aspartate, histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and
cysteine), cysteine seems to be the sole exception [[16],
this study].

phylogenies, it may, thus, be a better option to use protein
sequences instead.

In the rbcL genes of most Cryptomonas clades, the major
NNC codons for asparagine, aspartate, histidine, tyrosine,
or phenylalanine were preferred over their NNU alternatives, however, codon preferences were reversed in several
or all of these amino acids in clade LB [this study]. There
was even a gradient of decreasing selective constraints and
presumably also expression levels along the LB clade: In
the early diverging C. gyropyrenoidosa and C. lundii,
reversed codon usages were found in only one or two
amino acids, whereas in the late diverging C. borealis and
C. paramaecium in four or five NNY-coded amino acids,
NNU codons were preferred. Morton and Levin used the
codon adaptation index (CAI) to compare codon usage of
two-fold degenerate NNY codons in psbA genes among
dicot and monocot plants, and discussed putatively
decreasing selective constraints from basally to terminally
diverging lineages [18]. However, no hemi- or holoparasitic angiosperm plants were included in their study.

Previous studies have shown that mutations in genes of
DNA repair or DNA replication may result in overall
increases of substitution rates in bacterial and eukaryotic
genomes, e.g. [37]. Many genes of the cryptophyte nucleomorph have been transferred to the host nucleus including DNA polymerases [9,10,35]. Thus, some potential
mutator genes in cryptophytes can be expected to be
nuclear-encoded. It is tempting to speculate that a spontaneous mutation in a nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted
protein, for example in the proofreading subunit of a
DNA polymerase III or in a DNA repair enzyme, could
have accelerated successively mutation rates in nuclear,
nucleomorph and plastid DNA in the photosynthetic
ancestors of clade LB. Accelerated mutation rates may
have resulted in loss of photosynthesis in C. paramaecium,
which in turn perhaps resulted in less functional constraints on the rbcL protein and, thus, in further increase
of evolutionary rates.

In previous studies, convergent codon usage resulted in
artificial tree topologies [31]. Despite an obvious bias in
codon usage, the rbcL phylogeny was largely confirmed by
the nuclear and nucleomorph ribosomal DNA phylogenies. It is likely that the rbcL genes examined in this study
had not yet diverged enough to cause artifacts. It may have
been different, though, if rbcL had been used to infer phylogenetic trees across cryptophyte genera. For higher level

Another possible cause for accelerated evolutionary rates
in clade LB was discussed previously [12]. The genus Cryptomonas is dimorphic, a feature that usually correlates with
sexual reproduction. Final proof for sexual reproduction
is still missing, but, however, in clade LB only strains with
campylomorph cells were found[11,12]. It may, thus, as
well be possible that loss of sexual reproduction caused an
increase in mutation rates by loss of recombination affect-

Potential causes for lineage-specific accelerated rates and
relaxed functional constraints
One of the explanations for accelerated evolutionary rates
and relaxed functional constraints in plastid genomes is
loss of photosynthesis, since this usually results in largescale degradation and compaction of plastomes leading to
loss of almost all photosynthetic genes, except perhaps for
rbcL [22,32,33].

In the cryptophyte Guillardia theta, photosynthesis genes
are spread across plastid (46 genes), nucleomorph (30
genes) and nucleus (α-subunits of phycoerythrin, and an
unknown number of additional photosynthetic genes)
[9,10,34,35]. Thus, loss of photosynthesis is not an
unlikely explanation for a parallel acceleration of evolutionary rates across three genomes in C. paramaecium.
However, observations of elevated evolutionary rates in
closely related photosynthetic taxa contradict this notion.
Instead of being the cause for increased substitution rates,
loss of photosynthesis may rather be a result of an accelerated evolution that had started already in the photosynthetic ancestors of the colorless lineages [[12], this study].
Similar observations have been made in plastid gene phylogenies of hemi- and holoparasitic land plants [36].

ing also nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted proteins. However, the observed increase in evolutionary rates from host
to nucleomorph to plastid genome suggests that the evolutionary processes may have started in the plastid
genome.

Conclusion
An rbcL phylogeny of twenty-three Cryptomonas strains
was compared with phylogenetic trees inferred from
nucleomorph and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences. In
a super-clade comprising photosynthetic and colorless
Cryptomonas species, a congruent increase in evolutionary
rates and a similar branching pattern were found in data
sets representing the two genomes of the complex plastid,
the nucleomorph SSU rDNA and the rbcL data set. In both
data sets, the colorless strains displayed the highest substitution rates. A direct comparison of the genetic distances
across nuclear, nucleomorph and plastid data sets showed
that the evolutionary rates in the long-branch super-clade
were highest in the rbcL genes and lowest in the nuclear
ribosomal DNA. Perhaps evolutionary rates first accelerated in the plastid genome, then in the nucleomorph
genome. The increased evolutionary rates of nucleomorph SSU rDNA and rbcL gene evolved in parallel with
a gradual shift in codon usage of the rbcL gene towards a
relax in functional constraints and decreasing expression
levels. Strongest evidence for relaxed functional constraints and decreased expression levels in rbcL were found
in the terminally diverging photosynthetic species Cryptomonas borealis and in the colorless species C. paramaecium.
Either loss of photosynthesis was a gradual at first hidden
process starting already in pigmented ancestors of the
colorless C. paramaecium strains or the accelerated evolutionary rates caused defects in the photosynthetic genes
resulting in loss of photosynthesis.

Methods
Algal cultures
Photosynthetic and heterotrophic Cryptomonas strains
were obtained from different algal culture collections
(Table 2). Photosynthetic strains were maintained in
modified WARIS-H freshwater culture medium [38,39],
and heterotrophic strains in biphasic soil/water medium
with one-eighth of a pea for supply with organic substances. Strains were grown at 15°C under a 14/10 h light/
dark regime (15–35 µmol photons m-2 s-1; photosynthetic
strains) or in the dark (colorless strains).
Isolation of DNA, PCR amplification and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was isolated from the cells with the
DNeasy Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR amplification
of nuclear SSU rDNA, ITS2 and partial LSU rDNA, and of
nucleomorph SSU rDNA with nucleus- or nucleomorphspecific primers followed previously described protocols

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/56

[11,40]. For PCR amplification of cryptophyte rbcL genes,
new primers were designed using an alignment of bangiophyte or florideophycean red algal and cryptophyte rbcL
sequences (cryptophyte sequences: Chroomonas sp., acc.
no. AY119781; Cryptomonas paramaecium, acc. no.
AY119780; Guillardia theta, acc. no. AF041468; Pyrenomonas helgolandii, acc. no. AY199782). Similarly, new
sequencing primers were constructed using the same
alignment (sequences of PCR primers and sequencing
primers for rbcL are listed in Additional file 2). For PCR
amplification of rbcL DNA sequences, the same cycling
protocol as for the ribosomal DNA sequences was used
except for a decrease of the annealing temperature (predenaturation for 3 min. at 95°C; 30 cycles: 1 min. at 95°C,
2 min. at 45 or 50°C, 3 min. at 68°C). PCR products were
purified with the Dynabead M-280 system according to
the manufacturer's protocol (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). For
bidirectional sequencing, two sets of primer pairs were
used for each PCR product; the forward primers were
labeled with IRDye-800 and the reverse primers with
IRDye-700 (see Additional file 2). Double-stranded
sequences were determined with a Li-Cor 4200L bidirectional sequencer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Bad Homburg, Germany).
Phylogenetic analyses
The rbcL nucleotide and protein sequences were prealigned with clustalw and refined by eye using the multiple
alignment sequence editor SeaView [41]. The ribosomal
DNA sequences were manually aligned according to secondary structure; non-alignable regions were excluded
prior to the phylogenetic analyses.

Since the taxon sampling was congruent for plastid-,
nucleomorph- and nucleus-encoded sequences, all
unrooted data sets comprised 23 taxa (accession nos. are
listed in Table 2). The unrooted rbcL nucleotide data set
consisted of 1188 positions and was translated to perform
phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences or modified
for phylogenetic analyses of single codon positions (396
positions each data set; see Additional file 1 for additional
information about the data sets). A rooted data set of rbcL
nucleotide sequences consisted of 46 taxa and 990 positions, including 14 rhodophyte rbcL sequences as outgroup taxa (Additional file 3). The nuclear ribosomal
DNA sequences were concatenated for phylogenetic analyses resulting in a data set with a total length of 2623
nucleotides (complete nuclear ITS2 and partial nuclear
LSU rDNA comprising approx. 800 nt of the 5' terminus:
1083 positions; nuclear SSU rDNA: 1540 positions). The
nucleomorph SSU rDNA data set comprised 1496 positions.
All nucleotide data sets were subjected to distance, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian

analyses. To determine the evolutionary model fitting best
the data according to the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), Modeltest 3.6 was used [42]). Distance, maximum
likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses were performed with the program PAUP* 4.0b10 [43]. Distance
analyses were run under minimum evolution and set to
the maximum likelihood parameters proposed by Modeltest. Data sets with heterogeneous base frequencies were
also analyzed using the LogDet transformation. For both
types of analyses, trees were inferred with the neighborjoining algorithm. Maximum likelihood analyses were
done using the proposed evolutionary model settings of
Modeltest with three random addition replicates and heuristic tree search algorithm with tree bisection and reconnection (TBR). Unweighted maximum parsimony
analyses were performed using 10 random addition replicates also in combination with the heuristic tree search
algorithm. For all analyses under the distance or maximum parsimony criterion, 1000 bootstrap replicates were
calculated; for maximum likelihood, 500 bootstrap replicates were computed. Bayesian analyses were performed
using MrBayes 3.0B4 [44]. For the nucleotide data sets,
likelihood settings were set to GTR, gamma-distributed

among-site rate variation and covarion (includes proportion of invariable sites). Samples were drawn every 100th
generation for at least 3.5 million generations with one
cold and three heated chains. Burn-in was determined for
the individual data set according to the sump plot.
The protein data set was also subjected to distance, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian
analyses. The evolutionary model fitting best the data was
determined with ProtTest 1.2.6 according to the AIC
[45,46] and used for maximum likelihood analysis with
Phyml 2.4.4 [47]. Distance analysis was performed using
protdist from the Phylip 3.62 package (set to JTT+Γ with
global rearrangements; progam suite by Joe Felsenstein
[48]). The shape parameter α for the gamma distribution
in protdist was calculated using Tree-Puzzle 5.2 [49]. Maximum parsimony analysis was done using PAUP* 4.0b10
(10 random addition sequence replicates). For Bayesian
analyses with MrBayes 3.0b4, prior expectations were set
to AAmodel=mixed (priors for all amino acid substitution
matrices considered equal) and likelihood settings to
gamma-distributed among-site rate variation and proportion of invariable sites. Samples were drawn every 100th

three heated chains. Burn-in was determined according to
the sump plot.
Codon usage analysis
The countcodon program from the web site of the Codon
Usage Database [50] was used to determine absolute
counts of all codons of the twenty-three rbcL sequences
(396 codons). The DNA sequences were translated using
the eubacterial/plastid codon table (code table 11).
