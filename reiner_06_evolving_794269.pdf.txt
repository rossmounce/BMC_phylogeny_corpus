Abstract
Background: Doublecortin (DCX) domains serve as protein-interaction platforms. Mutations in
members of this protein superfamily are linked to several genetic diseases. Mutations in the human
DCX gene result in abnormal neuronal migration, epilepsy, and mental retardation; mutations in RP1
are associated with a form of inherited blindness, and DCDC2 has been associated with dyslectic
reading disabilities.
Results: The DCX-repeat gene family is composed of eleven paralogs in human and in mouse. Its
evolution was followed across vertebrates, invertebrates, and was traced to unicellular organisms,
thus enabling following evolutionary additions and losses of genes or domains. The N-terminal and
C-terminal DCX domains have undergone sub-specialization and divergence. Developmental in situ
hybridization data for nine genes was generated. In addition, a novel co-expression analysis for most
human and mouse DCX superfamily-genes was performed using high-throughput expression data
extracted from Unigene. We performed an in-depth study of a complete gene superfamily using
several complimentary methods.
Conclusion: This study reveals the existence and conservation of multiple members of the DCX
superfamily in different species. Sequence analysis combined with expression analysis is likely to be
a useful tool to predict correlations between human disease and mouse models. The subspecialization of some members due to restricted expression patterns and sequence divergence
may explain the successful addition of genes to this family throughout evolution.

Background
Mutations in the X-linked gene doublecortin (DCX) result
in lissencephaly or subcortical band heterotopia (SBH)
[1,2] (see review in [3]). Lissencephaly is a severe brain

malformation characterized by absent (agyria) or
decreased (pachygyria) convolutions accompanied by
thickening of the cortex [4]. SBH is a related disorder in
which there are bilateral bands of gray matter interposed

in the white matter between the cortex and the lateral ventricles [5]. In general, lissencephaly and SBH are neuronal
migration disorders. SBH is very common among females
with mutations in DCX [1,2]. DCX [6-9] and its closely
related gene product DCLK (doublecortin-like kinase)
[10,11] are classical microtubule (MT) associated proteins
(MAPs), and contain two evolutionary conserved tubulin
binding repeat sequences. We have initially defined the
evolutionary conservation based on a limited number of
proteins [12], following the expansion in available
sequences, but the recent explosion of available sequence
data, strongly warrants revisiting of this issue of the evolution of the DCX protein family. Interestingly, most missense mutations that are found in lissencephaly patients
cluster in the defined DCX (doublecortin) domain
[12,13]. These tandem repeat protein motifs are 11 kDa
and are located in the N-terminal part of the 30 kDa DCX
protein. The structure of the DCX domain markedly differs from that of classical MAPs adopting a globular structure with a ubiquitin-like fold [14]. Cryo-electron
microscopy studies revealed that DCX binds to MTs at a
novel site, located in between the protofilaments [15].
This binding site can explain why MTs are stabilized by
DCX. Two additional genes of this superfamily are implicated in human diseases. RP1 is the protein product of
retinitis pigmentosa -1 (RP1) [16,17]. Mutations in this
gene result in progressive blindness, not only in humans,
but also in a mouse model [18]. DCDC2 has been implicated in dyslexia [19,20]. Reduction of Dcdc2 in the developing cortex using in utero electroporation inhibited
neuronal migration [19].
The notion that DCX domain proteins may function in a
redundant way during cortical development was raised
when Dcx null mice exhibited a very mild cortical phenotype [21], whereas acute knockdown of Dcx using RNAi
resulted in a doublecortex phenotype [22]. Recent experimental evidence indicated that DCLK was redundant with
DCX. Dclk -/- mice also exhibited a rather mild cortical
phenotype, but Dcx/Dclk double mutant mice displayed
severe cortical defects [23,24]. Recently, an additional
member of this protein family, doublecortin kinase 2 (or
DCLK2), has been described, and found to posses MT
binding activities [25]. Nevertheless, Dcx and Dclk are but
two genes among eleven DCX domain proteins in the
mouse genome [26]. Thus, the quest for how DCX
domain-containing proteins exert their multiple functions during cortical development is still open [27]. Our
previous study has demonstrated common and unique
activities in regard to protein interactions, MAP activity,
and the subcellular localization of nine of the mouse DCX
domain superfamily members [26]. Two unifying functional aspects were detected; all proteins affected MT
polymerization, and all interacted with the JNK scaffold
proteins, JIP1 and JIP2. Thus, the DCX superfamily of pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/188

teins is likely to mediate signal transduction pathways.
Proteins with a tandem DCX domain stabilized MTs in
transfected cells. Some of the transfected proteins exhibited localization to actin-rich subcellular structures, and in
addition most of the DCX domain proteins exhibited a
nuclear localization. A distinct set of proteins interacted
with the scaffold protein neurabin 2, which binds to PP1
[28] as well as to actin [29]. Positive interactions were
observed with DCX, DCLK, and DCLK2, closely related
family members, but not with other DCX-domain containing gene products.
In the current study, we studied the evolution of the DCX
superfamily from unicellular organisms to humans. It was
possible to demonstrate emergence and disappearance of
specific genes or individual domains. The N-terminal and
C-terminal DCX domains have undergone sub-specialization and divergence. In addition, the expression pattern of
gene members was studied using database mining and in
situ hybridization tools. The sub-specialization of some
members due to restricted expression patterns and
sequence divergence may explain the successful addition
of genes to this family throughout evolution.

Results
Identification of proteins with a DCX domain
Human and mouse proteomes were searched for
sequences similar to that of the human DCX domain
yielding a total of 22 proteins containing one or two DCX
repeats (Table 1, the complete sequences used in the
present study are found in supplementary Fig. 1).

Serine/threonine protein kinase domains were found in
three human/mouse proteins (DCLK, DCLK2, and
DCLK3), and a ricin domain predicted to bind carbohydrates was found in a human/mouse protein referred to as
FLJ46154 [30]. The structure of the human FLJ46154 and
DCDC2B proteins differed from other proteins with tandem repeats; they contained a repeat more similar to DCX
C-terminal repeat, which appeared in the N-terminal part
of this protein, and a second repeat more similar to DCX
N-terminal repeat. In the mouse orthologs of these two
proteins, only one DCX domain was present. All the
mouse genes reside in chromosomal regions (Fig. 1b),
which are synthenic to the human orthologs (supplementary Fig. 2). This includes also the location of DCDC1 and
BAC26042, however they are not true orthologs since the
sequence similarity is very low (52%, among 46 out of 86
amino acids) only in the DCX domain, and the phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis, described below, indicate
that they are different. BAC26042 is also unique in its
close physical proximity with FLJ46154, the distance
between these two genes being only 2 kb, suggesting they
may share common regulatory elements.

This study is focused on the DCX domains, and does not
cover the full-length proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was
conducted for the individual DCX domains, separating
the N- and C-terminal parts (Fig. 2). Several interesting
features emerged from the human and mouse DCX
domain phylogenetic analysis. The majority of human
genes had a mouse ortholog. Two genes do not obey this
rule as they do not have unambiguous orthologs (human
DCDC1 and mouse BAC26042). Furthermore, in most
instances the N-terminally located DCX domains were
more similar to other N-terminal domains than to the Cterminal domains of the same protein. The two exceptions
were already mentioned; human DCDC2B and FLJ46154.
Sequence analysis combining BLAT [31] and phylogenetic
analysis identified the orthologous relationships listed in
Table 1.
Next, we extended the sequence analysis by including several additional non-mammalian genomes. Initially, the
analysis encompassed proteins found in the conserved
domain database CDD [32]. Subsequently, these searches
were broadened with extensive BLAST, TBLASTN, and
BLAT searches. Using BLAT search [31] sequences from
opossum, rat, and rhesus monkey were added. Ciona
sequences were added using TBLATN analysis against the
genomic data, and only those sequences corresponding to
ESTs were included. Hence, the present phylogenetic analysis included DCX-motif-containing proteins from
human, chimpanzee, mouse, cow, dog, chicken, fish,
worms, insects, frogs, fungi, and sea squirts (multiple
alignments are provided in supplementary Fig. 3). The
analysis of the tandem DCX domain proteins (67 proteins) resulted in an unrooted tree with bootstrap values
shown in Fig. 3.
Four groups of proteins are easily categorized within the
tandem DCX domain tree, which contains 67 proteins.

From top to bottom, the group of RP1 and RP1L1 include
orthologs from the frog Xenopus laevis, fish (zebrafish
Danio rerio, and pufferfish Tetraodon nigrovidis), chicken,
cow, dog, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, and human. The second group includes proteins similar to DCDC2A (previously known as DCDC2, name approved by the HUGO
Gene Nomenclature Committee) from mammals, including opossum (a marsupial), as well as chicken, fish, frog,
and simpler organisms such as the ascidian Halocynthia
roretzi, and the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. The third group
of proteins is devoid of mammalian proteins, but contains proteins from the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, and one protein from Ciona intestinalis. Similar
proteins were identified in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the
honey bee, Apis mellifera. Furthermore, two similar proteins from the worms Caenorhabditis elegans (ZYG-8), and
Caenorhabditis briggsae are detected in this group. The
fourth group of proteins includes those most similar to
DCX, DCLK, and DCLK2. This group included mammalian, chicken, fish proteins, and one protein from and
Ciona intestinalis. This analysis of proteins with two
domains, was followed by an analysis for the N- and Cterminal domain proteins (supplementary Figs. 4-5). One
hundred and seven proteins were analyzed in the Ngroup, and one hundred and one proteins in the C-group,
suggesting that there are slightly more proteins similar to
the N-terminal part of DCX. The general subdivision into
the four groups was preserved. Inspection of the proteins
composing the N-terminal phylogenetic tree detected that
additional proteins were added mainly to the third group
containing the Dictyostelium discoideum protein (including
8 members). Proteins from flies and worms were also
added to this group. The fruit fly genome contains five
DCX proteins, four of which are single repeats. Furthermore, several mammalian proteins were added to this
group as well. This group was increased to contain 26

members in the N-group and 19 members in the C-group.
This group included a protein from the unicellular organism Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria parasite.
Inspection of the proteins composing the C-terminal phylogenetic tree detected a group containing all the DCLK3
proteins. It should be noted that this group as a whole is
quite distinct from DCX, DCLK, and DCLK2. Proteins in
this group contain a single DCX domain from mammals
(human, chimpanzee, cow, rat, and opossum), but also
from fruit flies, honeybees, and malaria mosquitoes. An
exception is the ciona protein demarking this group
(Sca_10), which has a tandem repeat. One of the groups
contain both DCDC2A and DCDC2B proteins, and yet an
additional group contains several more DCDC2B proteins, suggesting probably less evolutionary conserved
sequences in the C-terminal domains of this subset of proteins.
During the analysis of the DCX domain proteins, the presence of tandem or single DCX-domains was noted in corresponding orthologs. The simplest way to explain these
differences may be through loss of intergenic sequences.
The analysis of exon-intron boundaries included all the
mammalian species and chicken since it is a non-mammal vertebrate, close enough to mammal to make comparison possible (Table 2). In general, the location of the
intron-exon boundaries is highly conserved. In some cases
the presence of an additional exon, does not change the
length of amino acids that are part of the DCX domains.
Such is the case with DCDC2C; most species contain one
exon, whereas the cow ortholog the corresponding amino
acid sequence is divided into two exons. However, in most
cases, the lack of an exon implies a reduction in the amino
acid information. For example, FLJ46154 contains in
most species three exons, whereas in mouse and in the

corresponding sequence in rat only two. Consequently, in
mouse and rat only a single DCX domain was identified
in the region corresponding to the human FLJ46154 DCX
domains. This analysis also allows identifying key time
points in the evolution of the DCX-domain proteins. The
common vertebrate ancestor of mammals and birds is
now believed to reach back 310 million years, marsupials
split from the main (placental) group about 180 million
years ago, and humans and rodents split off from their
evolutionary family tree about 87 million years ago. The
above analysis revealed that it is likely that BAC26042 was
lost during evolution (in mouse two exons exist, while rat
and rhesus monkey harbour only one exon). This analysis
has been complicated due to a predicted sequence in rat
(XM_230359) that is a fused sequence containing both
FLJ46154 and BAC26042. However, we have experimental evidence that do not support the existence of this fused
sequence. Antibodies we generated against the mouse
FLJ46154 protein recognize a protein of the predicted size
for FLJ46154 in mouse brain extract (supplementary figure 6). Thus, we have conducted our analysis based on the
human data, which is derived from mRNA and EST data,
and the mouse data that is based on EST data, supported
by our experimental data. DCLK3 was generated after the
mammals and birds split. BAC26042, FLJ46154, and
DCDC2C were generated after the marsupials split from
the main placental group. DCDC1 was generated after the
humans and rodent split. According to this analysis the
most conserved genes in this superfamily are DCX, DCLK,
and DCDC2A.
Following analysis of the two groups including N- and Cterminal domains, analysis for all the DCX proteins was
conducted (data not shown). As previously observed for
the human and mouse proteins (Fig. 2), the N- and C- terminal domains were more similar to each other than to
the corresponding repeat within the same protein. This
result suggested that the DCX-domain duplications were
ancient, and probably these two repeats have differed in
their functions. Subspecialization of the N-terminal and
C-terminal DCX motifs can be visualized at the level of
logo sequences. Previously, four conserved blocks (A-D)
within the DCX motif were identified [12], these conserved blocks are shown in the bottom of Fig. 4. When the
N-terminal region was analyzed separately from the C-terminal region, it was obvious that the A and portions of Band C- subdomains specify the N-terminus, while a portion of the C- subdomain specifies the C-terminus (Fig. 4).
This result was obtained using the Lawrence Gibbs sampler motif-finding algorithm. Similar results were
obtained with the Smith's MOTIF motif-finding algorithm (data not shown). This analysis indicates that
although the tandem domains share a short sequence of
similar amino acids, the N-terminal domain has a unique
very conserved block of amino acids.

Lawrence Gibbs sampler motif-finding algorithm.

Expression analysis by in situ hybridization
Taken into consideration the similarities among the different DCX-domain paralogs, and their common functions in relation to signal transduction and microtubule
regulation [26], it is important to establish when and
where these genes are expressed. This will help in delineating their potential function. For example, the distinction
whether a specific gene is expressed in proliferating,
migrating, or differentiating cells is critical when trying to
figure out gene function. Additionally, coexpression in a
particular tissue may indicate that paralogs could cooperate or be redundant.

Our analysis was carried out by in situ hybridization at
E14.5, a stage at which many differentiated cell types characteristic of an adult organism have formed yet at same
time such mid-gestation embryonic tissues still contain
progenitor cells. This analysis was performed with the
goal to generate an expression profile "snapshot". With
the exception of the ubiquitously expressed Dcdc2B (Fig.
5D), expression patterns of genes encoding DCX-repeat-

containing proteins are to a greater or lesser extent
regional. Dcx, Dclk and Dclk2 are expressed in the central
and peripheral nervous system including the brain, spinal
cord, cranial and dorsal root ganglia and in the parasympathetic ganglia (Fig. 5A–C). A high power view (Fig. 5E–
H) shows that in the developing neocortex Dcx and Dclk
transcripts are much more abundant in the preplate, but
individual cells expressing the Dcx and Dclk genes can be
detected in the ventricular zone. Both Dclk2 and Dcdc2B
are expressed in the developing neocortex, largely uniform and at low levels, but more pronounced in the ventricular zone than Dcx and Dclk. Outside the nervous
system, prominent sites of Dcx and Dclk expression are the
skeletal muscles, tongue muscles and individual cells of
the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 5A,B). The latter tissue also
expresses Dclk2 (Fig. 5C).
BAC26042, FLJ46154 and Dcdc2A exhibit highly regional
expression patterns, which in the brain appear to be similar for BAC26042 and FLJ46154 (Fig. 5I–K). Fig. 5I and 5J

(Fig. 5I,K).
The majority of DCX-repeat encoding genes are expressed
in the developing retina. Three types of patterns emerge:
Dcx, Dclk, Dclk2 transcripts are strongly expressed in the
postmitotic inner neuroblastic layer (Fig. 5L–N), whereas
BAC26042 and FLJ46154 are also expressed in this layer,
but in a more restricted fashion near and at its surface (Fig.
5P,Q). Finally Rp1l1 transcripts are found in the outer
neuroblastic layer that contains proliferating cells (Fig.
5O). Radially arranged Dcx, Dclk or Dclk2-expressing cells
are detected in the outer neuroblastic layer which is reminiscent of the situation seen in the ventricular zone of the
neocortex (Fig. 5E–G).
In addition, lung and kidney express Dcx, Dclk and
Dcdc2A. Dclk2 transcripts are also found in the developing
ovary and weak expression is also seen throughout the
kidney (data not shown).
Our analysis included most of the 11 genes listed in Table
1, the exceptions being Dclk3, and Dcdc2C for which we
could not yet identify suitable templates. Rp1 was also
examined but it is not expressed at E14.5, except expression noted in some midline cells of the spinal cord (data
not shown). To summarize our studies, we found that tissues destined to respond to electrical stimuli – central and
peripheral nervous systems and skeletal muscles – represent the most striking sites of expression of DCX-repeat
encoding genes. Outside these tissues, expression is
mostly low and usually not regional, the exceptions being
kidney and lung.
Expression analysis in human and mouse
The relevance of functional genomics approaches using
mouse models for studying human diseases obviously
depends on the similarity of gene expression in the two
species. Thus, we compared the expression of the human
members of the DCX gene superfamily investigated in this
study with their mouse orthologs. For this purpose, we
used the Unigene database of expression data website. Tissue-dependent expression profiles for both human and
murine DCX repeat-containing proteins were generated
from the EST count provided by UNIGENE [33]. Since the
mouse-human comparison was a key feature, the analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/188

was limited to tissues with a high total number of EST
counts that were common to both organisms. We analyzed data for ten different human genes, and eight mouse
genes. For two human genes there were no corresponding
expression data in mouse: DCDC2B, which has a mouse
ortholog that is not listed in UNIGENE, and DCDC1,
which does not have a mouse ortholog. The clustered
expression data resulting from this analysis is shown Fig.
6A and a gene-gene correlation based on this information
is shown in Fig. 6B.
We tested the significance of the correlation by random
permuation analysis. The correlations were re-calculated
1000 times after rescambling for each gene independently
all tissues at random. We found that all high correlation
(>0.5) were significant (p < 0.01). Two clusters revealing
very high correlation were observed. The largest group
included human RP1 and RP1L1, and their murine
orthologs. In addition, DCDC1, which so far had been
reported to be expressed mainly in testis, and embryonic
brain [34], was included in this group. This group is characterized by high levels of expression in the eye, which is
common amongst most DCX proteins, and has been
noted in our in situ analysis. In addition to expression in
the eye, these genes are expressed at lower levels only in a
few other tissues. In this group there is no clear distinction
in the gene-gene correlation in the expression in mouse
and human. The correlation between the different members of this group is >0.9 in all cases. Both the human and
the mouse FLJ46154 are related to this group, however the
correlation between the human and mouse FLJ46154 is
low (0.3). The protein-products of these two genes have
also diverged, with a loss of a DCX domain in the mouse
protein. Thus, it may be possible that there has been less
conservation in the regulatory regions of these genes as
well.
The second group exhibiting high gene-gene correlations
includes the murine genes Dcx, Dclk, and Dclk2, and their
human orthologs. Human DCLK2 exhibited somewhat
lower correlations with its mouse ortholog (0.4) than the
other genes in this group. This may stem from its general
overall lower expression levels (Fig. 6A). Our in situ data
also indicated a high similarity in the co-expression of
Dcx, Dclk, and Dclk2. Furthermore, our functional analysis
[26] indicated that this group shares more properties and
only they interact with the scaffold protein neurabin 2. A
third group of genes with lower levels of correlation
include DCDC2A, DCLK3, Dcdc2A, and Dclk3. In this
group the correlation between the corresponding
orthologs does not exceed 0.5. It should be noted that
there are some additional high correlations between different genes, for example; DCLK3 and Flj46154, or
FLJ46154 with DCX, DCLK, and Dcx.

Discussion
Protein architecture
Number of doublecortin repeats
The DCX domain family of proteins consists of multiple
members in the animal kingdom from the unicellular
organisms Plasmodium and Dictyostelium (in the nonaggregated part of its life cycle) to human. Although, Plasmodium and Dictyostelium do not have a nervous system,
motility is one of their important characteristics. The shift
from a single to a tandem DCX repeat (or vice versa) is a
rather simple mode to modifying protein activity from
binding to tubulin and assisting MT polymerization (one
repeat) to enabling it to promote MT bundling (two
repeats). We have demonstrated experimental evidence
for this view for DCX [12], and for eight additional members of the mouse DCX domain proteins [26]. The duplication of a single DCX motif was an ancient event because
of the existence of a tandem repeat already in Dictyostelium, and since the similarity within the N-terminal
domains is generally higher than to the C-terminal
domains of the same protein. We were able to document
the loss of a domain, by the loss of an exon ("domain
death"). Interestingly, the group of proteins encoding a
single repeat is expanded in nematodes. These single
repeat proteins are usually similar to the same extent to
the groups of the N- and C- terminal repeats. Our previous
analysis [12], structural analysis of DCX [14,15,35], and
our current analysis reveals differences between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains. Our analysis detected
a short stretch of conserved amino acids common to both
N-terminal and C-terminal repeats, however the
sequences diverged and the N-terminal domain has a
unique block of conserved amino acids. Close inspection
of the phylogenetic trees revealed higher evolutionary
conservation among proteins in the N-terminal group
than those in the C-terminal group. Our analysis detected
that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DCX
promote assembly of MTs [12], however the N-terminal
portion has higher activity than the C-terminal one. In
addition, other proteins containing a single or tandem
DCX domain were capable of promoting MT assembly
[26]. Among the studied mouse proteins FLJ46154 exhibited the highest activity in promoting MT assembly [26].
This protein contains a single DCX domain, which is more
similar to the C-terminal domain of DCX. Future studies
directed at the structural analysis of the different DCX
domains combined with the sequence analysis conducted
here may provide the basis for elucidating these functional variations. Another study indicated that the N-terminal domain of DCX binds only to assembled MTs,
whereas the C-terminal domain binds both to assembled
MTs and to unpolymerized tubulin [14]. Therefore, the
conserved amino acid block common to both repeats may
be important in directing the binding to assembled MTs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/188

Additional domains
A significant portion of the DCX-domain containing proteins has a kinase domain attached to them. This group
includes DCLK, and DCLK2, in which a tandem DCX
repeat is detected, and DCLK3, which contains a single
repeat more similar to the C-terminal one. Orthologs of
these proteins are also found also in invertebrates including nematodes. The C. elegans ortholog ZYG-8 has been
studied extensively [36]. In nematodes, ZYG-8 was found
to be important for assembly of astral microtubules. The
mutant ZYG-8 phenotype was observed with several different alleles including mutations in the DCX domain,
and the kinase domain, therefore suggesting a role for
kinase activity in regulating MT assembly. So far, the
endogenous substrates of these kinases, besides DCLK
which undergoes autophosphorylation [37], are
unknown.

Addition (or reduction) of the number of domains is not
always conserved in evolution. In close relationship with
DCLK3, which contains a kinase domain, a branch
including proteins with a different domain is found. This
branch includes the Drosophila melanogaster protein
(EMAL_DROME), which contains an additional HELP
domain, and WD repeats, which can be detected in the
closely related Anopheles gambiae, and Apis mellifera proteins. The HELP (Hydrophobic ELP) motif is found in
EMAP and EMAP-like proteins (ELPs), and has been
found to mediate binding to MTs in vitro [38,39]. Therefore, the combinatorial possibilities of modifying or
changing functional activities will depend upon specific
amino acid substitutions within the DCX domains, and
addition of other functional domains.
Additional ways to add on functions
On the level of the whole organism, one of the best ways
to modify protein activity is to vary the expression pattern.
Indeed, even in the case of proteins with similar sequence
and similar expression pattern such as in the case of DCX,
DCLK, and DCLK2 some notable differences in expression pattern were noted. For example, the expression of
DCLK2 in the ventricular zone of the cerebral cortex is
much more obvious than that of DCLK, suggesting that
the former may have a pronounced role in regulation of
proliferation of neurogenic progenitors. In fact, the
involvement of DCLK in regulation of mitosis has been
demonstrated recently [40]. DCLK regulated the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles and the proper transition
from prometaphase to metaphase during mitosis in
HEK293 cells and neuronal progenitors. In cultured cortical neural progenitors, DCLK RNAi disrupted the structure
of mitotic spindles and the progression of M phase, causing an increase of cell-cycle exit index and an ectopic commitment to a neuronal fate [40]. As mentioned above, the
C. elegans ortholog of DCLK, ZYG-8 regulates assembly of

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:188

astral microtubules [36]. Taken together, these findings
suggest that regulation of the MT-based mitotic spindle
may represent a conserved function among DCX-domain
proteins.
Two genes FLJ46154, and BAC26042, exhibited very similar expression patterns in the mouse. In the mouse
genome, the distance between these two genes is only 2
kb, suggesting that they may share common regulatory
sequences. Perhaps due to such a highly similar expression pattern, the loss of BAC26042 in other mammalian
species is not surprising. Partial copies of this gene (containing only one exon instead of two) exist in rat and in
the rhesus monkey. A proposed unified nomenclature for
the doublecortin superfamily based on correspondence
with the mouse gene nomenclature committee is presented in supplementary figure 7.
Expression patterns and phylogenetic correlations
One of the most exciting outcomes of the present analysis
is that in some cases we observed a high correlation
between orthologs and paralogs, and their expression profiles. This was most striking in case of the human and
mouse RP1, and RP1L1. A possible hypothesis, based on
these results is that a high correlation in the expression of
the human and mouse genes may be indicative of a high
probability that a mouse mutant would model the human
disease (or vice versa). If we review this hypothesis within
the limited genetic data available, we see that this hypothesis is supported. Rp1-/- mice closely reflect very well the
progressive blindness observed in human patients [1618,41,42]. Furthermore, in these mice the JNK pathway
was affected [43], and our functional analysis describe a
possible connection between RP1 and the JNK pathway
[26]. An unexpected member to this group is DCDC1. The
gene-to-gene function correlations are also very high in
case of the human and mouse DCX, DCLK, and DCLK2
genes. They are found on adjacent branches in the phylogenetic analysis. These genes are highly expressed in the
central nervous system not only in human and mouse, but
also in additional animals as chicken (DCX, DCLK [44],
and DCLK2 (unigene data for Dcx Gga.2608, Dclk2
Gga.16742), cow (dclk and dclk2; Bt.34533, Bt.55548),
rat (dcx Rn.121471, dclk Rn.155540, dclk2 Rn.23327),
and dog (dcx Cfa.19843, dclk Cfa.9988). Our analysis
detected expression of some of these genes in several additional tissues such as muscle, heart, and kidney, sites
which have not been previously described. Although Dcx/- mice have minor neuronal abnormalities [21,45], they
do not adequately recapitulate the human disease. This is
due to gene redundancy because the double mutant mice
Dcx-/- and Dclk-/- exhibited perinatal lethality accompanied with multiple brain abnormalities [23,24]. However,
using in utero electroporation in the rat and mouse
embryo, reduction in the expression of Dcx resulted in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/188

apparent inhibition of migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex [22,46]. In the rat, it was possible to observe
heterotropic positioning of neurons in postnatal rat
brains similar to SBH in human [22]. In contrast to the
cases discussed, there are several genes for which the
orthologs exhibit low gene-gene correlation; the lowest
are DCLK3 and FLJ46154 (0.3), DCLK2 (0.4), and
DCDC2A (0.5). Among these genes variability in
sequence analysis was noted as well. With future expansion of available information in databases, this analysis
will be extended to include many more tissues, addition
developmental stages, and additional species. We suggest
that this analysis may be useful in predicting possible
functional redundancy. Furthermore, it may provide useful clues in which tissues the mouse gene expression is
most similar to its human ortholog, thus suggesting the
possible relevance of a corresponding mouse model for a
human disease.

Conclusion
In summary, the DCX-domain family of proteins has
proven to be a very successful and prolific protein family
involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal regulation. Modifications in regulatory sequences allowing
unique expression patterns, addition of new domains,
and modifying the amino acid sequence of the DCX
domains themselves explains – at least in part- why this
superfamily is thriving.

Methods
Database homology search and phylogenetic analysis
Our database similarity search initiated with an NCBI
blast search using the sequence of mouse doublecortin
protein (NP_034155.2). In addition, all proteins with the
DCX domain were retrieved from the CDD, (Conserved
Domain DB). In a similar fashion, DCX proteins from the
EBI InterPro db, which were not detected in CDD were
extracted and added. In order not to miss related
orthologs, BLAT analysis using UCSC BLAT site [31] was
conducted initiating with the human and mouse genes.
Definition of orthologs was based on positioning in syntenic chromosomal localizations. In addition, an exhaustive TBLASTN search was conducted to detect DCX-related
transcripts in the EST database of Ciona intestinalis (sea
squirt) [47]. The corresponding cDNAs were mapped to
their corresponding genomic localizations.

For our analysis, three datasets were generated, the first
dataset for the proteins with 2 DCX motifs (including
both the N-term and C-term repeats) composed of 57 proteins from human, mouse, chicken, bovine, ciona, frog,
fish, nematodes, chimp and flies.
The second dataset included the proteins with a single
DCX motif, which exhibited higher similarity to the

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:188

mouse doublecortin C-terminal DCX motif, and the C-terminal ones of those with two DCX motifs. The single
repeats exhibited which exhibited identical similarity to
both the N- and C-terminal repeats of mouse DCX were
included in both N-term and C-term groups. The comparison was based on two-way BLAST analysis using
blast2seq. This dataset integrated 77 proteins from
human, mouse, chicken, ciona, dog, bovine, frog, fish, sea
squirt, nematode, ascidian, fruit fly and fungus.
The third dataset was composed of the proteins with a single DCX motif, which was more similar to the mouse doublecortin N-terminal DCX motif, and the N-terminal ones
of those with two DCX motifs. This dataset included 85
proteins from the species mentioned above.
Multiple alignment program, Clustalw, was run on each
of the datasets and the regions corresponding to the DCX
motifs were extracted, resulting in three multiple alignments (data sets are deposited in supplementary data 1).
The Phylip package ver. 3.6 was used to build the ML trees
with boot strapping values.
One hundred datasets were generated using the program
SEQBOOT from the original data (multiple alignment
done by clustalw) for each of the 3 groups of motifs (2repeats, C-terminal repeats and N-terminal repeats). This
was followed by running the program ProML (protein
Maximum Likelihood) on each of the datasets in the
group, using the JTT model. A consensus tree (from all the
100 trees) was generated using the program CONSENSE.
The trees were drawn using NJPLOT program or TreeView
[48]. All sequences of the three original datasets are available in supplementary Fig. 1.
Separate datasets were generated for the human and
mouse proteins, the first dataset for the proteins that have
two DCX motifs (N-terminal and C-terminal) composed
of 13 proteins. The second dataset for the proteins with a
single DCX motif more similar to the mouse doublecortin
C-term DCX motif, and the C-terminal ones of those with
two DCX motifs. This dataset included 20 proteins. A
third dataset included the proteins with a single DCX
motif more similar to the mouse doublecortin N-term
DCX motif, and the N-terminal ones of those with two
DCX motifs. This dataset has 21 proteins. These datasets
were subject to all the programs as mentioned above, clustalw, seqboot, proml, consense and njplot. CONSENSE
and NJPLOT were used to draw the human-mouse phylogenetic trees.

Washington, USA [49]. The Logoshown represents the
Lawrence Gibbs sampler motif-finding algorithm, similar
(but not identical) results were obtained using Smith's
MOTIF motif-finding algorithm.
Extraction of public large-scale expression data and
cluster analysis
EST counts from different human and murine tissue samples were extracted for 10 human and 8 mouse genes from
the UNIGENE website [33]. We discarded all human samples with less than 150,000 total EST counts and retained
only the murine samples that could be matched to these
samples. The murine 'late gestation' sample was matched
to the human 'embryo'. Expression value are given as
"counts per million of total ESTs". We applied a scaling
transformation 'x → t·arcsinh(x/t)' to the raw expression
values x to scale down (logarithmically) values above the
threshold t = 10.

In order to identify similarly expressed genes the combined set of expression data was clustered using Pearson
correlations over all tissues as similarity measures and single linkage for the generation of the dendrograms. Similarly, the tissues were clustered based on similar
expression across the genes. Alternative clustering methods were tested and yielded similar results. We used the
standard Matlab clustering algorithm.
In situ hybridization
The antisense RNA templates for in situ hybridization
were generated by in vitro transcription using PCR products (using the appropriate combinations of T7, T3, and
SP6 primers) from the corresponding genes, which were
cloned in BSIIKS+ or pGEMT. The sizes of the probes
ranged between 0.6 – 3 kb. The sequences of the templates
can be requested from the author. In several cases more
than one probe per gene was tested. Hybridizations and
data collection were done as described [50].
