Abstract
Background: The identification of protein coding elements in sets of mammalian conserved
elements is one of the major challenges in the current molecular biology research. Many features
have been proposed for automatically distinguishing coding and non coding conserved sequences,
making so necessary a systematic statistical assessment of their differences. A comprehensive study
should be composed of an association study, i.e. a comparison of the distributions of the features
in the two classes, and a prediction study in which the prediction accuracies of classifiers trained
on single and groups of features are analyzed, conditionally to the compared species and to the
sequence lengths.
Results: In this paper we compared distributions of a set of comparative and non comparative
features and evaluated the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained for discriminating sequence
elements conserved among human, mouse and rat species. The association study showed that the
analyzed features are statistically different in the two classes. In order to study the influence of the
sequence lengths on the feature performances, a predictive study was performed on different data
sets composed of coding and non coding alignments in equal number and equally long with an
ascending average length. We found that the most discriminant feature was a comparative measure
indicating the proportion of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous sites. Moreover,
linear discriminant classifiers trained by using comparative features in general outperformed
classifiers based on intrinsic ones. Finally, the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained on
comparative features increased significantly by adding intrinsic features to the set of input variables,
independently on sequence length (Kolmogorov-Smirnov P-value ≤ 0.05).

Conclusion: We observed distinct and consistent patterns for individual and combined use of
comparative and intrinsic classifiers, both with respect to different lengths of sequences/alignments
and with respect to error rates in the classification of coding and non-coding elements. In
particular, we noted that comparative features tend to be more accurate in the classification of
coding sequences – this is likely related to the fact that such features capture deviations from
strictly neutral evolution expected as a consequence of the characteristics of the genetic code.

Background
The annotation of whole genomes through the identification of protein coding and regulatory regions is one of the
major challenges in the current research in molecular
biology. In comparative genomics, the key idea is that
sequences, which are highly conserved during evolution,
likely correspond to either protein coding exons or regulatory motifs [1]. In our study, we focused on homologous conserved sequences among three mammalian
species: human, mouse and rat. Subsequent to their divergence, these genomes have independently accumulated
changes including insertions, deletions and substitutions
of nucleotide bases. Comparative genomic studies have
found that about 1 billion of the 3 billion bases in each of
the genomes of rats, mice and humans align with each
other. These aligned bases are thought to be an "ancestral
core" that has been retained in the three species. This core
composed of 1 billion bases encodes nearly all the genes
and their regulatory signals, accounting for the similarities
among mammals. However, only a portion of this core
constituting 5–6% of the whole genome appears to be
under selective constraint in rodents and primates, while
the remainder appears to be evolving neutrally [2-5]. Most
of coding exons and regulatory elements are included in
this highly conserved genome core. In consideration that
we still do not know the complete gene inventory of
human and other eukaryotic genomes, we are in principle
unable to unequivocally assess if a conserved sequence
element (CSE) is coding or not basing the decision only
on the comparison with the current gene annotation.
Indeed, a CSE may well overlap with a still unknown coding exon. The vast majority of coding sequence annotations are derived at least in part from sequence similarity
to previously annotated sequences – propagation of "conserved hypothetical protein" annotations thus risks erroneous protein gene predictions. Therefore, we are
interested in discriminating between coding and non-coding sequences in this highly conserved genome core, independently of the currently available gene annotation.
We stress the ongoing importance of sequence and evolutionary-dynamic-based discriminators in the prediction of
coding genes and the identification of regulatory elements. Different discriminative approaches have been
proposed which are based on various measures of the coding potential, i. e. measures of the likelihood that

sequences with a particular nucleotide substitution pattern or with a certain bases composition are coding
sequences. These metrics aim to capture different signals
that distinguish coding and non coding conserved
sequences and may use comparative or non-comparative
features. The former are based on cross-genomic comparisons, whereas the latter are computed by analyzing single-species sequences. The most common comparative
features are based on evolutionary signals which aim to
quantify 1) the tendency of nucleotide insertions and
deletions to preserve the codon reading frame [6,7] and 2)
mutational biases towards synonymous codon substitutions and conservative amino acid changes [8,9] unique
to homologous coding regions. Concerning the most
common non-comparative features, some metrics are
based on base compositional bias [10], on asymmetry of
the base composition in the three codon positions [11,12]
and other quantify the three-base periodicity in genetic
code [13,14]. Although different studies exist in literature
about the evaluation and comparison of discriminative
metrics based on single-species sequences [15,16], a complete study concerning both comparative and non-comparative features is still missing. In the field of
comparative genomics, many features have been proposed [17] but a critical study concerning their combination and influence on learning machines in predicting
coding and regulatory motifs lacks. In [18,19], the authors
combined two measures in a single one without addressing the problem of adding new features and measuring
their relevance on the final classifier. In [20], the authors
trained Support Vector Machine classifiers on a set of 180
features without focusing on the redundancy of subsets of
the features adopted. Moreover, these studies did not
address a critical study concerning the influence of the
sequence length on the classification performance.
As far as we know an unbiased statistical assessment of the
capacity of single as well as groups of features of classifying sequences between coding and non coding CSEs lacks.
Many experimental conditions and procedures for estimating the generalization error [21] strongly influence the
evaluation of the predictive ability of features and so must
be carefully taken into account. In particular, an objective
comparison and evaluation of the competing metrics
requires an accurate choice of data sets in terms of balance

in the sizes and in similarity of sequence lengths in the
two classes.

data sets consisting of 32318 coding and 5438 non coding
alignments.

In this paper we have provided a systematic and unbiased
statistical assessment of comparative and non comparative features for discriminating coding exons from regulatory motifs. In particular, we assessed the differences of
distributions by using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney non parametric tests [22] and we estimated the classification ability of single as well as groups of features by using multiple
cross validation strategy, which provides an unbiased estimate of the generalization error of learning machines
[23,24]. The statistical significance and power of the estimated prediction accuracy of Fisher's linear classifiers
were estimated by using non parametric permutation tests
[25,26]. In particular, in our study we evaluated the influence of the sequence length on the prediction accuracy of
classifiers trained on balanced data sets. Moreover, by
using Kolmogorov-Smirnov non parametric test [22] we
investigated if adding non comparative features to the
comparative ones could improve in a statistically significant way the performances of the classifier. We considered
features already reported in literature as well as novel features that attempt to capture extra signals of coding potential.

The length distributions of the sequences in the two data
sets (coding and non-coding sequences) are very similar:
their lower quartiles, medians and upper quartiles are
respectively 83 nt, 114 nt, 154 nt in the coding data set
and 74 nt,119 nt,198 nt in the non coding data set.

Methods
Data set description
Homologous genes have been extracted from Homologene database selecting only those genes with an annotated reference mRNA (NM_ID) and protein (NP_ID) in
all the three organisms considered: human, rat and
mouse. Reference mRNA sequences of these genes were
mapped on corresponding genomes using BLAT (the
BLAST-Like Alignment Tool [27]), then we identified
genomic regions corresponding to coding sequence by
parsing the BLAT output and the relevant mRNA Genbank
entry.

To generate the three-species coding CSE set we run the
BLAT search on genomic sequences masked in all noncoding sequences. Conversely, to generate the non-coding
set, all annotated coding regions and repetitive elements
were masked. In this way the coding set included CSEs
corresponding to coding exons, whereas the non-coding
set included 5' and 3'UTRs, introns or other intergenic
unique regions.
The hortologous genomic sequences of the coding and
noncoding set were pairwise aligned by using the BLAST
algorithm [28] to generate coding and noncoding conserved sequences, respectively. Conserved core regions
shared by all three organisms were extracted and multialigned by ClustalW program (with default parameters)
generating our coding and noncoding multi conserved

Discriminative features
In this section, we provide a detailed description of the
measures we chose to reveal the differences between the
two classes.
Comparative features
The most common comparative features are based on evolutionary signals as mutational biases towards some
codon substitutions. The evolution of highly conserved
sequences, both coding and non-coding, is under the control of negative selection. However, their evolutionary
dynamics is expected to be quite different for these two
classes of sequences. Due to the nature of the genetic code
the majority of base substitutions in coding regions tend
to be synonymous [29], thus mostly affecting the third
codon position, with non-synonymous changes favoring
interconversions between amino-acids with similar chemical-physical properties. On the other hand non-coding
conserved sequences follow a completely different evolutionary dynamics as negative selection, in this case, acts to
preserve the binding of regulatory proteins (e.g. transcription factor binding sites) or regulatory RNAs (e.g. miRNAs) [8,9]. To quantify these differences, we evaluated the
following metrics.
Rate ratio
Following the Nei-Gojobori approach [29], we computed
the number of codon pairs which differ only for the nucleotide at the i-th position, i. e. the number of single base
changes:

m Si

with i = 1, 2, 3

and the number of codon pairs which differ for two or
three nucleotide differences one of which is at the i-th
position, i. e. the number of multiple base changes:

m Mi

with i = 1, 2, 3 .

Si among the m Si substitutions are synonymous. Assuming that the proportion of substitutions in multiple bases
which are synonymous is equal to the estimated proportion of synonymous substitutions among all substitutions

S

in single bases π Si = m i , we computed the number of
Si
synonymous substitutions:
3

Sd =

∑ (m

Si

+ m Mi ) ∗ π Si

d

or equivalently d s becomes infinite when its denominan
tor is zero. In order to avoid this problem, we defined as
measure of selective pressure the following substitution
rate ratio:

(1)

i =1

SRR =

and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions
3

Nd =

∑

(m Si + m Mi ) ∗ (1 − π Si ).

(2)

i =1

To compare the two numbers Sd and Nd, we must differently weight them because the number of potential synonymous sites is much smaller than the number of
nonsynonymous sites.
To this end, we computed the numbers of synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitutions for each codon position, i. e. for the i-th codon position we evaluated the proportion si of possible substitutions in the i-th codon
position which are synonymous and the proportion ni of
possible substitutions in the i-th codon position which
are nonsynonymous (ni = 1-si). We normalized Sd and Nd
by using the average of si and the average of ni over all pairs
of aligned triplets, denoted S and N respectively, obtaining the following quantities:

S

p s = d , pn = d
S

known as p-distances [30]. In the study of the evolutionary divergence, the above computed p-distances are corrected to account for multiple substitutions at the same
site by the Jukes-Cantor correction and become

ln(1 − p s ), d n = − ln(1 − p n ),

(4)

known respectively as synonymous substitution rate and
d
nonsynonymous substitution rate [31]. The dn rate ratio
s

is used as measure of the relative importance of evolutionary forces that have shaped a particular protein. A rate
ratio significantly greater than one strongly suggests that
positive selection has acted on the protein: the nonsynonymous substitutions are "relatively" more frequent. The
values ds and dn are defined only if psand pn are smaller
3
than 4 . So we preferred to neglect the Jukes-Cantor cord
rection and to use the p-distances. Moreover, the ratio dn

where ps is the estimated proportion of synonymous
nucleotide substitutions per synonymous sites and pn
denotes the estimated proportion of nonsynonymous
nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous sites as
above defined. Our measure is the proportion of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous sites normalized by using the sum of both proportions of the
nucleotide substitutions. A SRR ratio of 0.5 suggests that
these genes have evolved without constraints, a value of
SRR greater than 0.5 (ps> pn) suggests that nucleotide substitutions that don't change the encoded amino acid (negative selection) are the most frequent substitutions. On
the contrary, a SRR smaller than 0.5 (ps > pn) indicates that
the most frequent substitutions are those which change
the encoded amino acid (positive selection). Note that, in
the computation of SRR in 5, we consider only the aligned
triplets without gaps. MRna sequences which differ at the
most for gap triplets have SRR equal to infinite. These
sequences are so similar that we can't establish if the selective pressure is positive, neutral or negative, so we
excluded these sequences from our study. The measure
SRR clearly depends on the reading frame and for the protein coding sequences there is only one correct reading
frame. We expect the SRR gets the maximum value in correspondence of the correct reading frame. To this end, we
chose as coding potential score the maximum value of
SRR out of six possible reading frames. On the contrary,
for the non coding sequences all the six reading frames
should have similar SRR values and so a smaller dispersion on the different frames around the maximum value.
For this reason, we evaluated this dispersion as follows:

SRR M = max SRR(i)

Blosum score
In order to quantify amino acid similarity between the
two aligned sequences, we averaged over the Blosum
scores of consecutive triplet pairs for each reading frame
BL80(i) [32]. We used a modified version of the
BLOSUM80 by assigning a null Blosum score to the couples of two stop codons and to the couples of codons of
Page 4 of 12

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 6):S2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S2

which one has three gaps codons and the other one hasn't
any gap or has three gaps and a Blosum score of -9 to couples of codons with almost one codon with one or two
gaps [9]. As metrics of the coding potential, we selected
the maximum value on the different frames and its coefficient of variation around the maximum:

BL80 M = max BL80(i),
i =1,2,...,6

BL80 std =

1 6
2
∑ (BL80(i)− BL80 M)
5 i =1
.
BL80 M + 9

(8)

(9)

Note that, to ensure that the coefficient of variation wasn't
infinite, we added 9 to the BL80M value at the denominator.
Reading frame conservation
In coding exons of conserved regions, alignment gaps
don't shift the reading frame (id est gap lengths are multiple of three bases) or are arranged to let the recovery of the
frame. We evaluated the percentage of nucleotides that are
in the same frame for each pair of the sequences in the
alignment and for each possible offset:

RFC i

∀i = {1, 2, 3},

(10)

(see Figure 1). In detail, we labeled the nucleotides of the
first sequence (skipping the gaps) by their codon position
beginning with the first one, and labeled the nucleotides
of the second sequence beginning once with the first, once
with the second and once with third codon position. Then
we counted the percentage of nucleotides equally labeled
in each pairwise comparison RFCi and selected the maximum value RFC [6]. We expected that this value was
greater in the coding sequences data set than in the non
coding one.

Nucleotide Percent Identity
Finally, we considered the percentage of bases which are
conserved across each pair of sequences denoted by
Nucleotide Percent Identity (NPI).
Intrinsic features
In the following, we describe the coding potentials which
were derived from single species sequences.
C+G content
It's well known that the concentration of genes is correlated with a highest C+G density [10]. For this reason, we
counted the C+G content in each sequence in analysis.
Percentage of stop codon
Moreover, we expected a smallest percentage of stop
codons in the correct reading frame of a protein coding
sequence (just one codon stops the translation) than in a
non coding sequence, where the triplets have no meaning
for the amino acid translation. So we counted the percentage of stop codons (TAA, TGA, TAG) in each reading
frame %Stop(i) and selected the smallest such percentage
out of six possible reading frames and its dispersion
around the minimum:

%Stop m = min %Stop(i),

(11)

i =1,...,6

%Stop std =

∑ (%Stop(i) − %Stop

(12)

i =1

Nucleotide compositional skewness
Moreover, in order to capture eventual differences of
skewness in the basis composition of the sequences, we
computed the following skews:

AT skew =

n A −nT
n −n
, CG skew = C G .
n A + nT
nC + nG

(13)

Note that these measures depend on the reading frame
direction, in particular their signs change with the direction. As we don't know whether right frame is direct or
inverse, we could only compare ATskew and CGskew in absolute value.

reading frame conservation test by M. Kellis et al. (2004).

Positional composition bias
It's known that for coding sequences in the GenBank,
there is a preference for purine in the first codon position
(32% G and 28% A) and for weakly bonded pair in the
second position (31%A and 28% T) [11]. So we computed for each sequence the sum of densities of A-G in the
first codon position and A-T in the second codon position
on each reading frame:

Discrete Fourier Transform
It's known that there's a three bases periodicity in the coding DNA signal and the power spectrum at frequency of 1/
3 is a measure of this periodicity [13].

In detail, each DNA sequence is converted in 4 digital signals, one for each nucleotide α:

I{n j =α }

for α = {A, C , G, T},

j = {1 : N}

where N is the sequence length and nj is the jth base in the

in the three-bases periodicity between the two classes.
Predictive study
We adopted Fisher's linear classifiers [26] trained by using
each feature singularly and sets of them for classifying
CSEs. As measure of classifier performance we used the
error rate, i. e. the fraction of both coding and non coding
CSEs incorrectly predicted, or, equally, the accuracy, i. e.
the fraction of both coding and non coding CSEs correctly
predicted. The prediction error rate was measured by a
holdout cross-validation procedure [33]. The data set was
randomly split 1000 times into a training set and in a
assessment set and the prediction error E was estimated by
averaging on the 1000 errors Ei when each sequence in the
assessment set was predicted from the training set:

The frequency is f = N and k = 0,..., N - 1. To average
power spectra Sαβ (k), we followed the approach in [14]

and defined the power spectrum of each sequence as

where s is the number of random splittings in training and
assessment data sets.
The statistical significance of the estimated error rate E was
assessed by using a non parametric permutation test [25].
This test aims to answer the following question: what is
the probability to obtain, under the null hypothesis H0 of
independent input variables and class labels, an error rate
E' less than or equal to the really observed error rate E? To
this end, we shuffled 1000 times the labels of the
sequences and computed the P-value as the percentage of
random classifiers with error rate E′i equal or smaller than
the error E of the classifier trained on the correctly labelled
data:

allowed to evaluate an estimate of the power π of the test

Results and discussion
We characterized the distributions of feature values in
coding and non-coding alignments and assessed the statistical significance of their differences using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) non-parametric test [22].
The results are summarized in Table 1. For each species,
the first two columns show the mean values of each variable in the two classes and the last one shows the P-values
of WMW test. The features are ranked for increasing P-val-

ues. We used the Bonferroni correction to control the
probability of obtaining any false positive feature under
the hypothesis that each feature is equally distributed in
the two classes [34]. So we selected a cutoff value dividing
0.05 by the number of features. It results that all P-values
are less than the cutoff value, i. e. the distributions of all
features are significantly different in the two classes except
for the CGskew and the %Stopstd for M. musculus. The WMW
test applied to our data set confirms some findings present
in the literature. For example CG-content, frequency of A/
G at first codon positions and frequency of A/T at the second codon position ( f( AG)1 ( AT ) 2 M ) are all higher for the
coding sequences [10,11]. This is likely due to the higher
GC content of coding exons with respect to the background sequences as well as to their compositional periodicity related to the triplet codon structure [35].
Unsurprisingly, these phenomena are also much more
"frame specific" for the coding sequences: in fact the

For each species, the first two columns show the mean values of each variable in the two classes and the last one shows the P-values of WilcoxonMann-Whitney test. The suffices H-M, H-R and H-R indicate the species in comparison. The features are ranked for increasing P-values. Note that
all P-values are less than 0.0025 except for the CG-skewness and the stop codon spread %Stopstd for M. musculus.

value on the different frames is greater for the coding
sequences. Moreover, we observed a greater AT-skew and
a smaller CG-skew in the coding regions.
The SRRM value is significantly higher in coding regions
confirming that substitutions in the correct reading frame
of homologous coding regions are more strongly biased
towards synonymous changes than in any candidate reading frame in non coding alignments [17]. Furthermore,
we found that nonsynonymous substitutions cause more
conservative amino acid changes in the coding alignments
(BL80M is greater in the coding pairwise alignments) [18].
The table shows that the ranking of P-values is identical
for rat, human and mouse. For all three species the CGcontent, FFT, %Stopm, f( AG)1 ( AT ) 2 std textit (intrinsic features) are the most discriminant features.
Moreover, we found that the comparative features are
more discriminatory for human-mouse and human-rat
alignments than for rat-mouse alignments suggesting that
these features are more discriminatory at greater evolutionary distances [36].
The distributions of almost all measures being significantly different in the two classes, we might hope to attain
accurate classifications by training classifiers on each feature and constructing data driven models of linear functions to discriminate coding and non coding sequences
and then examine the performances of our classifiers in
terms of prediction error rate on sequences that were not
used to construct the model (For details see the section
"Methods: Predictive study"). Nevertheless, we observed
that several parameters could influence the prediction
accuracy of classifiers of mRNA sequences as coding or not
coding: one important parameter is the length distribution of the sequences in the training set and in the validation set.
Sequence length dependence of classifier performances
We analyzed the performances of classifiers trained on rathuman-mouse alignments as a function of sequence
lengths. The study of this trend gives indications about the
minimum sequence length required to obtain a significantly small error rate. This analysis is especially useful for
methods to identify coding and non-coding CSEs which
use classifiers built on sliding windows of fixed length.
Accordingly, we studied how the performances of classifiers change by varying the sequence lengths for fixed data
set sizes: in particular, we controlled the predictive error
rates monitoring their P-values and the powers of classifi-

ers (See "Methods: Predictive study"). To this end, we
built 21 different balanced data sets, that is with coding
and non coding alignments in equal number (75 coding
and 75 non coding sequences), and with equally long
sequences with an ascending average sequence lengths.
The sequence lengths of the 21 data sets were respectively
in the following ranges: [41, 50], [51,60], . . . , [241,250]
bp. For each classifier and for each species, we constructed
learning curves in which the empirical error rate (median,
25% and 75% quantiles) is plotted as a function of
sequence length. As the trends of learning curves related to
the non comparative features were very similar for all
three species, we reported in Figure 2 only the results for
human sequences. Concerning the comparative features,
we observed that the learning curves for human versus rat
comparison are very similar to those for human versus
mouse. Accordingly, the Figure 3 shows only the human/
mouse and mouse/rat curves. Several features show significantly different distributions for coding and non-coding
sequences/alignments but are not able to accurately discriminate between the two classes of sequences (P-values
> 0.05). These features include CGskew, ATskew,

f( AG)1 ( AT ) 2 M , %Stopstd and NPI.
For the intrinsic features with statistically significant error
rates (%Stopm, CG-Content, f( AG)1 ( AT ) 2 std , FFT) we
observed decreasing error rates with ascending sequence

lengths (see Figure 2). The same behavior was observed
for comparative features with statistically significant error
rates, i. e. for the Blosum scores BL80M and BL80std, the
substitution rate ratio scores SRRM and SRRstd and the
reading frame conservation RFC. Moreover, our results
suggest that these comparative features better discriminate
for more genetically distant species. Error rates related to
the human/mouse and human/rat comparisons (blue
line) are smaller than those obtained in the mouse/rat
comparison (green line).
In order to compare the performance of all classifiers
according to the sequence lengths, we summarized the
results for human sequences and their alignments in a
unique plot shown in Figure 4. To build this summary
plot, we grouped the empirical estimated error rates in
four classes by averaging error rates of the classifiers
related to the increasing sequence lengths: [41,90[,
[91,140[, [141,190[, [191,250] bp. Our analysis suggests
that the percentage of stop codons %Stopm, the rate ratio
SRRM and its spread SRRstd are the most discriminatory
features for the species considered. Nevertheless, %Stopm
is strongly influenced by the sequence lengths, while
SRRstd and SRRm exhibit less than 30% error rates even for
sequences and alignments with lengths in the [41,
90[base range. Finally, we point out the behavior of the
classifier trained by using Blosum scores BL80M which
provides small error rates independently of the sequence
lengths. Lower performance is expected for all methods

when confronted with short sequences due to stochastic
factors, the poor performance of the %Stopm metric with
short sequences is unsurprising given that low numbers of
stop codons are expected even for non-coding sequences
when the length is short. In order to obtain higher accuracies, for each sequence length we trained a classifier with
the comparative features and a classifier with the intrinsic
ones.
The features depending on the reading frame were evaluated by using the frame suggested by the most accurate
univariate classifier, i. e. the classifier based on SRRM. The
empirical distributions (median and interquartile range)
of prediction accuracies of comparative and intrinsic classifiers are depicted respectively in Figure 5a) and 5c). Both
learning curves are ascending for increasing sequence
length: the accuracies vary in [70%, 97%] and are statistically significant for each sequence length (P-value < 0.005
and π > 0.88). Although these learning curves exhibit a
similar qualitative behavior, they result statistically different. In fact, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show that the error
rates of comparative classifiers are significantly smaller
than ones of non comparative classifiers in 68% of the
length classes for the human, in 65% for the mouse and
in 94% for the rat.
Moreover, we investigated if adding the intrinsic features
to the comparative ones could improve the performance
of the classifier in a statistically significant way. To this
end we trained a classifier by using the above features
simultaneously and assessed its error rate as a function of

the sequence length. For each length class, the empirical
distribution (median and interquartile range) of prediction accuracy of this global classifier is depicted in Figure
5e). By the permutation test, the significance and the predictive power of the error rate were assessed: all 21 error
rates are significant with P-values < 0.05 and π > 0.992.
The accuracy increases proportionally to the sequence
length up to 97% (P-value = 0, π = 1). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, applied for comparing comparative versus global classifiers, show that the error distribution of the
global classifier is significantly smaller than the one of the
comparative classifier, for all three species in analysis and
independently of the sequence length. In other terms, the
information related to the intrinsic features is not redundant in the ensemble of all features in order to classify
coding from non coding CSEs.
We completed our analysis comparing the global, comparative and intrinsic classifiers in terms of sensitivity
(proportion of coding sequences/alignments classified as
coding) and specificity (the fraction of non-coding
sequences correctly predicted as non-coding) (see Figure
5b), 5d) and 5f)). We found that the combination of comparative features is more powerful in the classification of
protein coding sequences while the inverse is true for the
intrinsic features independently on sequence length. In
the global classifier prevails the non comparative behavior: it better predicts the non coding than the coding CSEs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S2

regardless of sequence length. The fact that comparative
features tend to be more accurate in the classification of
coding sequences is likely related to the fact that such features look deviations from strictly neutral evolution
expected as a consequence of the characteristics of the
genetic code. Conversely, novel intrinsic features might be
expected to aid in the correct classification of non-coding
sequences.
We still do not know the complete inventory of human
and other eukaryotic genomes although several efforts in
this direction have been carried out so far. Phylogenetic
footprinting is a powerful tool for such purpose as evolutionary conservation is a significant hallmark of protein
coding potential. Indeed, coding portions of genes generally are under strong selective pressure that preserve their
primary sequence [37]. However, also some non coding
regions are highly conserved or ultraconserved as they
may be involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory activity [38]. Thus the problem is to reliably discriminate between coding and non-coding
conserved sequences, as the first, when falling outside current annotations, may represent novel exons of alternative
splicing variants or of unknown protein coding genes,
while the latter are likely involved in some regulatory
activity. We previously developed an heuristic method to
measure the protein coding potential that resulted quite
well performing [18,39]. However, we did not evaluate
the specific contributions of different features on the discriminatory efficiency. The results presented here fill this
gap as they measure the predictive potential of different
features, both those based on intrinsic features simply
based on primary sequences (e.g. base composition or
periodicity) and those deriving from comparative measures (e.g. Ks or Ka). We also evaluated the effect of CSE
length on the prediction accuracy. Results presented
reveal some general statistic properties of coding and non
coding sequences that may be of general interest also for
other studies aimed at their classification adopting different methodologies.

Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a systematic and statistically well founded assessment of various comparative and
non-comparative features for distinguishing coding from
regulatory motifs in conserved sequences tags among
human, rat and mouse species. In our study we evaluated
the relevance of single as well as groups of features in distinguishing coding from non coding CSEs by using association and prediction studies. The distributions of the
analyzed features were statistically different in the two
classes, confirming well known results and suggesting
novel differences between coding and no coding CSEs
which should be confirmed on different data sets. Moreover, we have provided an experimental evidence concern-

ing the relevance of intrinsic features in predicting crossspecies alignments. In fact, the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained by using comparative features increased significantly by adding intrinsic features to the set of input
variables. We observed distinct and consistent patterns for
individual and combined use of comparative and intrinsic
classifiers, both with respect to different length classes of
sequences/alignments and with respect to error rates in
the classification of coding and non-coding exemplars.
A problem, worthy of future study, is derived from the fact
that most, if not all, published comparative methods have
been trained and evaluated with entirely coding or
entirely non-coding alignments. While this renders generation of training sets more tractable, it does not reflect the
real situation encountered during the annotation of draft
genome or other sequences where alignments may be generated through similarity searches, but no a-priori information regarding delineation of coding regions is
available. To this end, our data showing that carefully
chosen features can show high sensitivity and specificity
even for short alignments suggest that sliding window
approaches may be capable of addressing this issue.
Finally, it is clear that while, particularly for the comparative features, different measures are far from independent
(all such features measure deviations from random substitution patterns expected as a consequence of the genetic
code), different features function differentially at different
evolutionary distances. In general therefore, it should be
considered desirable to use multiple species comparisons
spanning different levels of divergence – both in order to
maximize the proportion of the reference genome which
is aligned, and to maximize the discriminatory power of
the tools at hand. Such approaches are the subject of
ongoing work.
