Abstract
Background: The phylogeny of Eumalacostraca (Crustacea) remains elusive, despite over a
century of interest. Recent morphological and molecular phylogenies appear highly incongruent,
but this has not been assessed quantitatively. Moreover, 18S rRNA trees show striking branch
length differences between species, accompanied by a conspicuous clustering of taxa with similar
branch lengths. Surprisingly, previous research found no rate heterogeneity. Hitherto, no
phylogenetic analysis of all major eumalacostracan taxa (orders) has either combined evidence from
multiple loci, or combined molecular and morphological evidence.
Results: We combined evidence from four nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial loci (18S rRNA,
28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) with a newly synthesized morphological
dataset. We tested the homogeneity of data partitions, both in terms of character congruence and
the topological congruence of inferred trees. We also performed Bayesian and parsimony analyses
on separate and combined partitions, and tested the contribution of each partition. We tested for
potential long-branch attraction (LBA) using taxon deletion experiments, and with relative rate
tests. Additionally we searched for molecular polytomies (spurious clades). Lastly, we investigated
the phylogenetic stability of taxa, and assessed their impact on inferred relationships over the
whole tree. We detected significant conflict between data partitions, especially between
morphology and molecules. We found significant rate heterogeneity between species for both the
18S rRNA and combined datasets, introducing the possibility of LBA. As a test case, we showed
that LBA probably affected the position of Spelaeogriphacea in the combined molecular evidence
analysis. We also demonstrated that several clades, including the previously reported and surprising
clade of Amphipoda plus Spelaeogriphacea, are 'supported' by zero length branches. Furthermore
we showed that different sets of taxa have the greatest impact upon the relationships within
molecular versus morphological trees.
Conclusion: Rate heterogeneity and conflict between data partitions mean that existing molecular
and morphological evidence is unable to resolve a well-supported eumalacostracan phylogeny. We
believe that it will be necessary to look beyond the most commonly utilized sources of data
(nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences) to obtain a robust tree in the future.

Background
Attempts to infer the phylogeny of eumalacostracans have
been high on the agenda of systematic zoology at least "
[s]ince the awakening in natural science which followed
the publication of the Origin of species" [1]. This is unsurprising, firstly because several of the most influential zoologists of the late 19th and early 20th century were
carcinologists, and secondly because the erstwhile 'higher
Crustacea' houses the majority of economically and commercially important species of edible crabs, shrimps, and
lobsters. What is surprising, however, is that in the 21st
century, when considerable resources are being directed
towards "assembling the tree of life", no major initiative
is focused on resolving relationships within this, the most
diverse of all crustacean clades [2]. By contrast, relatively
large programs are underway to tackle both broader (e.g.,
arthropod phylogeny: NSF DEB-0120635, awarded to C.
Cunningham, J. Martin, J. Regier, J. Thorne, and J. Shultz)
and more narrow (e.g., decapod relationships; NSF
awards DEB-EF-0531603 (F. Felder), DEB-EF-0531616 (J.
Martin), DEB-EF-0531670 (R. Feldmann and C. Schweitzer) and DEB-EF-0531762 (K. A. Crandall and N.
Hanegan)) phylogenetic problems. A concerted effort to
resolve eumalacostracan phylogeny would complement
these efforts, providing a valuable supplement and
broader interpretative framework, respectively.
The ongoing development of faster and cheaper DNA
sequencing techniques, coupled with advances in analytical methods, are encouraging researchers to revisit old and
recalcitrant phylogenetic problems. Before embarking on
such a revision for the Malacostraca, it is therefore
extremely timely to take stock of the present state of
knowledge by synthesizing and analyzing all of the presently available data. This is necessary for several reasons.
Firstly, there is still no robust consensus on malacostracan
phylogeny, despite recent and comprehensive analyses of
morphological and molecular data [3-6]. Although there
is some congruence between the latest morphological
analyses, some striking incongruities are present as well
[3,4]. Here, we discuss critically some of the most striking
unresolved issues, and integrate previously published
morphological data sets [3,4,7-9] into a new matrix.
Secondly, molecular approaches to eumalacostracan relationships are still in their infancy. Although sequence data
have been applied to a variety of taxonomically restricted
questions [10,11], only two studies were based on sufficient taxon sampling to be able to focus on resolving the
major relationships between the traditional higher-level
malacostracan taxa [5,6]. In addition, several studies of
deeper arthropod phylogeny [12-15] have included small
numbers of representative eumalacostracans, but taxon
sampling is too sparse to interpret these results straightfor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/21

wardly. The two comprehensive studies aimed explicitly at
resolving eumalacostracan phylogeny are based on 18S
rRNA [5,6]. However, potential problems with these analyses, such as long-branch attraction, and the availability
of new sequences of 28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I for previously unsampled taxa,
make a multilocus re-evaluation of eumalacostracan phylogeny opportune.
Thirdly, a comparison of the morphological and molecular phylogenies of Eumalacostraca reveals a number of
"puzzling" [5] or even "disturbing" [3] conflicts that have
so far evaded satisfactory explanation, or testing in a total
evidence framework. These conflicts are easily revealed by
a topological comparison of the molecular and morphological cladograms, but we perform the first quantitative
test of whether morphology and molecules present significantly different signals.
The two most recent and most comprehensive morphological phylogenetic analyses of eumalacostracan phylogeny are Richter & Scholtz (2001) [4] and Poore (2005) [3].
These studies evaluated and synthesized previous evidence for malacostracan phylogeny, and agree on the following:
• Peracarida including Thermosbaenacea (= Pancarida) is
monophyletic
• Mysidacea is monophyletic
• Mictacea and Spelaeogriphacea are sister taxa
In contrast, these studies disagree about the positions of
Decapoda, Euphausiacea, Mysidacea, Cumacea, Tanaidacea, and Isopoda. However, because Poore (2005) [3]
focused on resolving peracarid relationships while Richter
& Scholtz (2001) [4] had the broader remit of malacostracan phylogeny, these studies are not strictly comparable.
Poore (2005: 2) [3] stated that his morphological data set
was "essentially a compilation of those [morphological
characters] used previously but with additions", which
leads to the reasonable expectation that Poore's analysis
should be the most severe morphological test of peracarid
(and possibly wider eumalacostracan) phylogeny published to date. We note, however, that Poore chose not to
incorporate several characters from Richter & Scholtz
(2001) [4], including some that he conceded were "the
most significant" to bear on certain relationships within
the wider Eumalacostraca. These were excluded, quite reasonably, because they did not contribute specifically to
resolving peracarid relationships. All have been reinstated
in the present analyses.

We synthesized the character sets of Richter & Scholtz
(2001) and Poore (2005) [3,4] with those of previous
works [4,8,9,16] as well as newly published information
to derive a revised morphological hypothesis of malacostracan phylogeny.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/21

The most striking differences between molecular (principally 18S rRNA) and morphological (principally Richter
& Scholtz 2001 and Poore 2005 [3,4]) trees, respectively,
are the following:
• Monophyly vs. polyphyly of Mysidacea

Published molecular phylogenies focusing expressly on
eumalacostracan relationships are derived from 28S rRNA
and 18S rRNA sequences [5,6,10,15]. Congruence
between these is limited, partly because of differences in
taxon sampling, but also (as we show here), because the
two molecules contain conflicting signals that are not
strong enough to resolve relationships at all levels. However, 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA do agree that:
• Mysids are more closely related to euphausiaceans and
stomatopods than to the other peracarids
• Isopods and amphipods are not sister taxa
• Decapods, euphausiaceans and stomatopods may be
part of a clade separate from the peracarids
The phylogenetic positions of all other taxa are highly variable. Different analytical methods yield different trees
[5,15], all of which have very low levels of clade support.
One striking aspect of the 18S rRNA trees in Spears et al.
(2005) [5] and Meland & Willassen (2007) [6] is the large
difference in branch lengths. All peracarid branches, (with
the exception of those of Mysida), appear to be significantly longer than those of the non-peracarid malacostracans. Particularly noteworthy is the clade of Amphipoda
and Spelaeogriphacea, which is supported by both studies, but which lacks any known morphological support
[3,5]. This anomalous clade groups the most divergent
sequences included in these studies, leading us to suspect
long-branch attraction (LBA). Although Meland & Willassen (2007) [6] did not discuss the possibility of LBA,
Spears et al. (2005) [5] dismissed it. Our reinvestigation
suggests that LBA may, in fact, be a significant problem.
The most striking result of the recent literature is the
apparent conflict between morphology [3,4,8,9,16-18]
and molecules [5,6,10,11]. This implies significant homoplasy in either molecular or morphological evidence (or
both). The only sister group relationship to receive independent support from molecules and morphology is that
between Euphausiacea and Decapoda (Eucarida). Even
so, this clade is contradicted by several other morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Considering
clade membership rather than sister groupings admits a
few more areas of agreement. For example, some studies
present molecular and morphological support for a clade
comprising Cumacea, Isopoda, and Tanaidacea.

• Monophyly vs. polyphyly of Peracarida (through exclusion of Mysida from Peracarida)
• Absence vs. presence of a clade minimally including Stomatopoda, Euphausiacea and Mysida
• Absence vs. presence of a clade minimally including
Amphipoda, Spelaeogriphacea and Lophogastrida
In this paper we combine, for the first time, molecular
data from four nuclear and mitochondrial loci (18S rRNA,
28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I)
along with morphological evidence for higher-level
eumalacostracan relationships. Among other things, this
represents the first test of the phylogenetic position of
Bathynellacea and the monophyly of Syncarida using
combined molecular evidence (16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) [11,19]. The combined discussions and results presented in this paper should be
valuable as a guide to any future phylogenetic analysis of
this diverse clade. They reveal the limitations of published
evidence, and highlight where understanding is lacking.

Methods
Morphology
We synthesized a new morphological cladistic dataset by
integrating previous matrices (additional files 1, 2) [3,4,79,16]. The data sets of Wills (1997, 1998) [7,9] and
Schram and Hof (1998) [16] were originally compiled to
address wider questions of crustacean phylogeny. In
removing most non-malacostracan taxa (with the exception of an outgroup comprising Leptostraca, Anostraca,
Notostraca and Brachypoda) a number of characters were
rendered uninformative for the residual taxon sample.
Other additive (or "ordered") characters had "intermediate" states removed, and were therefore recoded to reflect
only those states present in the remaining sample. Poore's
(2005) [3] data set contained a restricted sample of nonperacarid malacostracans, such that additional taxa were
coded for some characters. Groups represented in Poore
(2005) [3] by more than one OTU (Mictacea and Spelaeogriphacea) were recoded as polymorphic taxa. Pires
(1987) [8] did not present a matrix as such, and most
characters were subsumed within those of later authors.
More generally, characters represented in two or more
matrices were coded to reflect the most recent study. We
have typically coded limited uncertainty and polymorphic
states rather than introducing assumptions regarding the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:21

groundplans for our terminals. Characters relating to
numbers of podomeres have generally been coded to
reflect all of the variation between orders. Many crustacean orders contain exemplars in which given rami for
given appendages may be either reduced (one or two
podomeres) or absent altogether. For this reason, we have
predominantly included "zero podomeres" as a state
within characters coding for podomere numbers. The
alternative would be to introduce an additional character
for the presence or absence of a given ramus, with
"podomere" characters coded as inapplicable for terminals lacking the ramus. Possible ordering and weighting
schemes for such characters have been discussed elsewhere in detail [9], and similar principles have been
applied here. In some analyses, therefore, characters relating to numbers of limb elements (podomeres, endites,
etc.) and numbers of somites have been ordered, while
those relating to numbers of limb elements have also been
scaled to unit weight.
Molecules
Spears et al. (2005) and Meland & Willassen (2007) [5,6]
have published the most comprehensively sampled
molecular phylogenies of the higher-level taxa within
Malacostraca (14 of the 15 recognised, excluding
Bathynellacea). Both analyses are based on 18S rRNA. In
contrast, Jarman et al. (2000) [10] included just 10 of the
15 recognized higher-level taxa in the first phylogenetic
analysis of Malacostraca based on 28S rRNA. Subsequent
more inclusive analyses of wider arthropod relationships
have generally included a more restricted sample of malacostracan higher-level taxa [12-15].
Taxon selection
Our choice of taxa was dictated by several considerations.
Firstly, we started with the aligned 18S rRNA dataset of
Meland & Willassen (2007) [6] facilitating a direct comparison with this study and that of Spears et al. (2005) [5]
(additional file 3).

Secondly, we concatenated the data partitions for 18S
rRNA, 28S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit
I, and morphology (additional files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). In order
to maximize data density per taxon we created composite
(chimerical) higher-level terminals for several taxa (see
Table 1), which is a reasonable strategy in multilocus and
phylogenomic analyses [20,21]. For composites, we
included the most closely related species available, using
generic (or higher when necessary) membership as proxies for relatedness. This strategy should not distort phylogenetic analyses, provided the composite taxa are
certifiably monophyletic with respect to the others sampled [22]. This is well supported for the terminals used
here [4]. We acknowledge that this strategy precludes testing explicitly the validity of our assumed monophyla.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/21

Some authors therefore prefer not to amalgamate, despite
the introduction of large amounts of "missing data" [23].
Although missing data can reduce consensus resolution, it
does not necessarily yield spurious relationships [24].
Thirdly, for taxa with multiple representative species we
excluded most of those with data for just one or two loci.
This explains why we sometimes included fewer representatives of certain groups (e.g., Tanaidacea, Mysida,
Lophogastrida, and Decapoda) than Meland & Willassen
(2007) [6]. The problematic and rarely-sampled orders
Mictacea and Spelaeogriphacea were included on the
basis of 18S rRNA data alone, while Bathynellacea was
represented by 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I data. Stygiomysis was excluded. Again, we note that
the inclusion of missing data need not obfuscate or distort
inferred relationships [24]. Moreover, missing data is not
the only thing with the potential to influence trees: small
differences in taxon or character sampling can have radical effects [25]. Hence, there are two issues. The first is
whether the removal of taxa that share few characters with
the majority of the others will result in a different tree. The
second is whether these same taxa are themselves resolved
in a misleading position. The first issue was addressed, at
least in part, by first order jackknifing. This would demonstrate that both Mictacea and Bathynellacea could be
removed from the parsimony analysis, with no effect
upon the relationships of the remaining terminals.
Removal of the Spelaeogriphacea had a small, localized
effect, with no implications for the positions of Mictacea
or Bathynellacea. We also investigated this in the Bayesian
analyses, with a similar outcome. Removal of Spelaeogriphacea left the topology of the combined molecular
analysis unchanged, while removal of Bathynellacea only
affected the position of the Mictacea (shifting it down the
tree by two nodes that lacked significant support). The
second issue – testing the placement of these taxa – can
only be addressed by collecting more data: filling in the
gaps or sequencing new genes. However, this is true for
any phylogenetic hypothesis, irrespective of putative missing data problems.
Fourthly, we reduced the number of species in the combined molecular and morphological evidence analyses so
that each OTU was represented by a single taxon. This was
done to prevent the results from being affected by the replicated morphological ground patterns, which would
strongly bias the analyses in favour of the monophyly of
the higher taxa with multiple representative species.
For the molecular and combined evidence analyses we
designated Leptostraca as the outgroup. There is general
consensus in the malacostracan literature that leptostracans are the sister group to the remaining malacostracans,
and the monophyly of Eumalacostraca is well supported

For several analyses some higher taxa have two or more representatives (e.g., Stomatopoda 1 and Stomatopoda 2, etc.). The superscripted
numerals in the table indicate to which (composite) taxa the sequences have contributed (e.g. Cumacea1 is based on the sequences with numeral

by morphology [4]. This is also supported by some larger
scale molecular and combined evidence analyses
[13,15,26].
Data partitions and alignments
All sequences (except 18S rRNA sequences, which were
kindly provided by K. Meland), were downloaded from

the GenBank, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (see Table 1 for accession numbers), and
with the exception of the 18S rRNA data, were aligned
online with T-coffee http://www.tcoffee.org. For the 18S
rRNA data we used the alignment of Meland & Willassen
(2007) [6], which incorporates secondary structure information. Ambiguously aligned regions were determined by

Page 5 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:21

the program Gblocks version 0.91 b [27], and excluded
from the analyses. After trying a variety of settings, the
final Gblocks settings were selected to yield a good quality
alignment while not sacrificing an unnecessarily large
amount of data. Nevertheless, ambiguously aligned
regions and especially pronounced length variation
between species in the ribosomal genes necessitated the
removal of 49%, 65%, and 85% of the 18S, 16S, and 28S
alignments, respectively. The settings were the following
for the 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and 28S rRNA partitions
respectively: [1: 27; 2: 44; 3: 8; 4: 4; 5: all]; [1: 11; 2: 11; 3:
8; 4: 5; 5: with half]; [1: 10; 2: 10; 3: 8; 4: 5; 5: with half].
The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I partition did not contain any ambiguously aligned regions, and the alignment
was checked with respect to the amino acid alignment.
The partitions and the character exclusion sets based on
Gblocks are as follows (positions continuous in the concatenated dataset):

The data were analysed using both parsimony and Bayesian inference, using PAUP* [28] and MrBayes [29]
respectively. We performed Bayesian and parsimony analyses on all separate partitions and the combined data.

For the parsimony analyses we performed heuristic
searches consisting of 1,000 (or more where stated) random addition replicates with TBR branch swapping. All
molecular characters were treated as unordered and
equally weighted, offering a contrast with the Bayesian
analyses (where complex models of molecular evolution
were used). The ordering and weighting of morphological
characters in the parsimony analyses is as defined in additional file 1. Bootstrapping analyses were based on 2,500
or more resamplings, each with 1,000 random additions
and TBR swapping. For the morphological data set, bootstrapped trees were additionally used to determine maximum leaf stabilities (LS) [30-34] using RadCon [30]. In
rooted trees, the leaf stability of a taxon is calculated as the
average of the support values for all three-taxon statements including that taxon. Stable taxa will contribute to
well-supported triplets. Taxa with lower leaf stabilities are
more likely to impact negatively upon apparent support.
Hence, leaf stabilities can be used to measure directly how
far the relationships of a given terminal to all other terminals are supported, which in turn offers a proxy for the
likely impact of a given taxon on global measures of tree
support. We also used first order jackknifing to determine
the impact upon relationships of removing individual
taxa [25]. Reference trees were produced by pruning each
taxon from the set of MPTs from the simultaneous analysis of all taxa. These were compared with trees resulting
from additional parsimony analyses sequentially omitting each taxon from the outset. The impact upon apparent relationships was measured using two indices: the
symmetric difference distance on full splits (RF of Robinson and Foulds 1981 [35]) and the maximum agreement
subtree distance (d1 of Finden & Gordon 1985 [36]). The
RF measures the difference between two trees as the
number of nodes unique to both, while d1 reports the
number of taxa missing from the maximum agreement
subtree. These differ conceptually, and may differ markedly in practice. Where comparisons were between sets of
trees, we calculated the mean distance between each tree
in one set and the most similar tree in the other set (such
that identical sets of trees have no difference). For the
combined evidence analyses, we calculated partitioned
Bremer support indices [37] using TreeRot version 3 [38].
For the Bayesian analyses we used MrModeltest [39] to
determine the best-fitting model for each data partition,
excluding ambiguously aligned regions from the calculations. This resulted in the following models being used for
all analyses of separate or combined partitions: GTR + G +

I (general time-reversible model + gamma distributed
rates of substitution + estimated proportion of invariant
sites) for 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA; GTR + G for 28S rRNA
and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. We did not partition
stem and loop regions for the 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA
genes. With respect to the 18S rRNA data, both Spears et
al. (2005: 134) [5] and Meland & Willassen (2007: 1090)
[6] note that Bayesian analyses with the stem and loop
regions of the 18S rRNA molecule treated the same or as
unlinked partitions resulted in "highly congruent" results.
For the morphological partition, we used a commonmechanism maximum-likelihood model, with a gamma
distribution of rates (Mkv+G model of Lewis, 2001 [40]).
Unless stated otherwise we ran four chains, of which three
were heated. We sampled every 200 generations, and used
a 25% burn-in. In all combined analyses, we allowed rates
to vary independently for each partition. For the combined molecular and morphological analyses all morphological characters were treated as equally weighted and
non-additive. For individual runs, additional parameters
were:
- 18S rRNA: seven million generations, average standard
deviation of split frequencies: 0.007.
- 28S rRNA: 2039000 generations before automatic average standard deviation of split frequencies (0.01) was
reached.
- 16S rRNA: three million generations, average standard
deviation of split frequencies: 0.006.
- Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I: five million generations, average standard deviation of split frequencies:
0.008.
- Morphology (MOR): three million generations, average
standard deviation of split frequencies: 0.003 (all nonadditive characters)/0.002 (some characters treated as
additive).
- Combined molecules (MOL): seven chains (six heated),
sample and print frequency: 200, seven million genera-

tions, average standard deviation of split frequencies:
0.0094.
- MOL minus Spelaeogriphacea: seven chains (six heated),
sample and print frequency: 200, four million generations, average standard deviation of split frequencies:
0.007.
- MOL minus Amphipoda: five chains (four heated), sample and print frequency: 200, six million generations,
average standard deviation of split frequencies: 0.007.
- Combined molecules and morphology (MOLMOR): six
chains (five heated), six million generations, average
standard deviation of split frequencies: 0.004.
- MOLMOR minus Spelaeogriphacea: six chains (five
heated), sample and print frequency: 400, six million generations, average standard deviation of split frequencies:
0.003.
- MOLMOR minus Amphipoda: six chains (five heated),
sample and print frequency: 400, six million generations,
average standard deviation of split frequencies: 0.008.
In the combined Bayesian analyses we unlinked the
parameters for priors on substitution rates (revmatpr), stationary nucleotide frequencies (statefreqpr), shape of the
gamma distribution of rate variation (shapepr), and proportion of invariant sites (pinvarpr) for all molecular data
partitions.
For the ILD test [41] we made all possible comparisons of
individual loci (Table 2) and between these and morphology (Table 3) (in addition to a single test of all partitions
analysed simultaneously). For each comparison, we
removed all taxa present in only one partition. Hence, the
number of taxa analysed was not uniform. This necessitated the further removal of uninformative characters
from one or both partitions so that the number of characters contributed by an individual partition was also variable. Each concatenated data set (comprising two loci, or
one locus and morphology) was analysed in PAUP* with
1,000 random partitions ("hompart"). All characters were

treated as unordered and unweighted for simplicity. Heuristic searches were used throughout, with 1,000 random
additions of taxa followed by TBR branch swapping. For
the molecular data set (Table 2), we also estimated the
topological Mickevich-Farris ILD or TILD [42]. In this
implementation, we inferred a strict consensus from each
partition, recoded these using group inclusion characters
(matrix representation in PAUP*), and subjected the
resultant combined matrix to the ILD test. We note that
the TILD test can be applied to partitions and trees comprising incompletely overlapping sets of taxa, but preferred to make a direct comparison with the ILD results
here.
Branch lengths, long-branch attraction and relative
substitution rates
We assessed the possibility of long-branch attraction artefacts in our analyses with a series of exploratory analyses
(there are no conclusive tests per se). Firstly, we performed
a distance-based relative rate test with RRTree [43] on the
18S rRNA data to test whether taxa differed significantly in
their relative substitution rates. We compared the results
considering each taxon as a separate lineage, and using a
pre-defined guide tree to allow rates to be compared
between different supra-specific clades (using the 18S
rRNA topology of Meland & Willassen 2007 [6]). This
method has been used to identify fast-clock organisms for
exclusion from phylogenetic analyses [44,45].

Secondly, we utilized likelihood ratio tests in PAUP* to
determine whether the sequences evolved at similar rates.
We did this by comparing the likelihoods of the trees both
with and without a molecular clock enforced. The likelihood ratio was then calculated as 2(lnL1-lnL2), where L1
is the null hypothesis (clock assumed), which is a subset
or special case (in nested models) of the alternative
hypothesis L2 (no clock assumed). We assumed s-2
degrees of freedom, where n is the number of terminals.
We used this test in addition to the above distance-based
relative rate test for several reasons. Spears et al. (2005) [5]
rejected the possibility of LBA in their 18S rRNA tree based
on the basis of a likelihood ratio test, so we re-analysed
our data in the same way. More importantly, distancebased relative rate tests and likelihood ratio tests may differ in their sensitivity [46], so we applied both here. More

prosaically, and despite repeated attempts, we failed to
prevent RRTree from crashing when analyzing the concatenated molecular data (possibly a function of the
amount of sequence data the program is able to handle).
Consequently, we resorted to likelihood ratio testing for
the concatenated molecular data.
Thirdly, we performed taxon exclusion experiments
designed to test whether taxa with high substitution rates
are artificially attracted to each other [47]. If LBA occurs by
attraction of two long-branch taxa, removal of one of
these from the analysis may allow the other taxon to find
its proper place in the phylogeny. If the remaining taxon
jumps to a different position in the tree, then it is possible
that the initial clade was a LBA artefact.
Fourthly, we evaluated concordance between the analyses
of the separate data partitions, and between the parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Both methodological discordance of results (based on the fact that different
methods differ in their ability to prevent LBA), and the
lack of morphological support for a molecular clade (an
admittedly weak criterion) have been taken as possible
indications of LBA in the literature [47].
Using PAUP *, we performed a likelihood ratio test of
internal branch lengths for the 18S rRNA sequences and
the combined molecular evidence. This allowed us to test
whether the very short internal branches were significantly different from zero length (an option available
under "likelihood settings").

Results
A single most parsimonious tree resulted from the analysis of the morphological characters alone (Figure 1). Trees
resulting from parsimony analyses of individual molecular partitions are given in Figure 2. Combined parsimony
analyses for all molecules, and molecules plus morphology, are given as Figures 3 and 4 respectively. The Bayesian
morphological tree is given as Figure 5, while Bayesian
trees from the individual molecular partitions are presented in Figure 6 and 7. Combined Bayesian analyses of
all molecules and molecules plus morphology are given in
Figures 8 and 9 respectively.

(2001) and Poore (2005) [3,4,7-9,16]. Characters relating to numbers of somites, limbs and limb elements (podomeres and
endites) have been ordered. Characters relating to limb elements have also been scaled to unity (ranged). Bold figures on
branches indicate Bremer support. Italic figures are bootstrap percentages where these exceed 50% (10,000 equiprobable
character resamplings, each with 1,000 random additions and TBR). Histograms of mean RF and mean d1 relate respectively to
the symmetrical difference distance and maximum agreement subtree distance measures of the impact upon relationships of
removing individual taxa (first order jackknife). Leaf stability is calculated as the maximum value based on trees from the first
2,000 bootstrap replicates.

The congruence of partitions
The results of the individual pairwise ILD tests are
reported in Tables 2 and 3. ILD tests for both the combined molecular, and combined molecular and morphological data sets partitioned simultaneously into separate
loci/morphology were also highly significant (P < 0.001).
For the larger, 24 taxon, molecular data set, all comparisons, except that between 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I for the ILD test, were highly significant
(and the hypothesis of congruence was therefore
rejected). It is probable that the 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I comparison passes the test

because the signal in one or both subsets of data is very
weak (see Figures 7 and 2). The TILD tests of topological
congruence confirmed this: all partitions (including 16S
rRNA vs. cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) yielded significantly incongruent relationships (irrespective of the support for those relationships). Moreover, the PBS analyses
of combined molecular and total evidence (Figures 3 and
4) pick up conflict between the signals for 16S rRNA and
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I for several nodes. For the
smaller, fifteen taxon data set including morphology,
eight of the ten ILD comparisons yielded a significant
result (Table 3). Comparisons showed that only the 16S

18S rRNA and 28S rRNA partitions passed the ILD test.
Such a finding of incongruence between morphology,
mitochondrial and nuclear sequences is not uncommon
[48,49], and the ILD test is known to be conservative,
sometimes suggesting conflict where none exists [50].
Given the acknowledged interpretational ambiguities
associated with the results of ILD and TILD tests [51] we
investigated the effects of combining all of the data.

Contribution of data partitions to combined evidence:
partitioned Bremer support
PBS analysis highlighted moderate conflict between partitions for the MOL analysis. As can be seen in Figure 3, for
13 out of 21 within-ingroup-nodes, one (but never more
than one) partition conflicted with the other three. In ten
of these 13 cases, a mitochondrial partition (in 9 cases,
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) conflicted with the other
partitions. In striking contrast, all 12 ingroup nodes of the
MOLMOR analysis displayed conflict, as can be seen in
Figure 4. For eight of these, the morphological partition

conflicted with all the molecular partitions that contributed clade support. Remarkably, in all eight cases, morphology contributed positive support to the node,
suggesting that the parsimony analysis of MOLMOR evidence is resolved strongly on the basis of morphology.
Topology of Bayesian and parsimony trees
Many of the clades found in the combined evidence trees
are at odds with traditional ideas based on morphological
evidence, and have therefore not (yet) received names. We
refrain from proposing new names for these clades
because our results are equivocal. We label the clades with
numbers, which are referred to in summary table 4 and
the figures. The Bayesian analyses based on combined
molecular (MOL), and molecular + morphological (MOLMOR) evidence (Figures 8 and 9) share a number of
clades:

However, we stress that the Bayesian posterior probabilities were statistically insignificant (<0.95) for all clades
uniting higher taxa in the MOL tree. In this tree (Figure 8)
just three groups of higher taxa had posterior probabilities
greater than 0.90: clade I (0.93), III (0.94), and IV (0.93).
Combining morphological with the molecular data (Figure 9) raised the posterior probabilities of clade III to 1.00
and clade IV to 0.95, and additionally produced a clade
containing Thermosbaenacea, Bathynellacea and the peracarid taxa with a support of 0.97.
The Bayesian MOL tree (Figure 8) and the tree based on
morphological data alone (MOR) (Figure 5) were strikingly different, as was also the case for the MOL and MOR
trees based on parsimony (Figures 3 and 1). The Bayesian

dacea and Thermosbaenacea, and the position of Anaspidacea.

The parsimony tree based on the MOL data (Figure 3)
shared only clades I and III with the Bayesian combined
evidence trees, while the parsimony MOLMOR tree (Figure 4) only shared clades II and III with the Bayesian trees.
With the exception of the sister group relationship
between Amphipoda and Spelaeogriphacea, the parsimony MOL and MOLMOR trees were strikingly different.
The bootstrap values for the parsimony analyses were generally very poor.

Bayesian analyses of the morphological data with or without explicit character ordering and weighting as specified
in additional file 1 yielded identical trees, although with
the latter slightly less resolved. Removing explicit character ordering and weighting from the parsimony analyses
of the morphological dataset had modest effects. Inferred
relationships were changed less than by the removal/
inclusion of some terminals (i.e., Leptostraca, Euphausiacea and Amphionidacea). Weighting all characters to
unity (but retaining order for those characters previously
ordered) resulted in a single tree, differing from the original by d1 = 6 and RF = 12. The positions of Tanaidacea
and Cumacea within the peracarids were affected, and
Euphausiacea emerged as sister group to the peracarids.
Additionally, relationships within the remaining eucarids
were altered, with the subtree of Procaridea to Dendrobranchiata re-rooted on Dendrobranchiata (such that Procaridea + Caridea formed the most highly internested

The parsimony analyses of the MOL partitions are

displayed some conspicuous differences, notably in their
placement of Euphausiacea, the relative positions of Mysi-

clade). Additionally treating all characters as unordered
resulted in four trees, one of which was identical to that
for the flat weighted but ordered analysis. The strict consensus of these four introduced just one tritomy in the
peracarids and one in the outgroup. Since these changes
were comparable to those resulting from slight differences
in taxon sampling, we did not explore alternative ordering
and weighting regimes in the combined or Bayesian analyses.
Test of internal branch lengths
In our molecular trees, internal branches were markedly
shorter than most terminal branches. Conspicuously
short branches might actually represent molecular polytomies [52]. Hence, we used a likelihood ratio test to investigate whether several key branches were significantly
longer than zero. For our 18S rRNA partition (Figure 6),
the putative clade of Spelaeogriphacea and Amphipoda
[5,6] failed this test (P < 0.01). The same held true for the
clade of Tanaidacea and Cumacea, and the clade uniting
all taxa except Leptostraca, Mictacea, and Mysida. While
our combined molecular evidence (Figure 8) instead suggested that Bathynellacea is the sister group to Amphipoda, this was also "supported" by an internal branch
length not significantly different from zero (P < 0.01). The
same is true for the branch uniting both Bathynellacea
and Spelaeogriphacea with Amphipoda, the clade of Tanaidacea and Cumacea, and the clade uniting all taxa
except Leptostraca and Mysida.
Relative rates of evolution and long-branch attraction
Long branch attraction (LBA) can result from rate heterogeneity across taxa. Likelihood ratio tests strongly rejected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/21

rate constancy in both the 18S rRNA and MOL datasets.
The distance-based relative rate test confirmed this for the
18S rRNA data (P < 0.001, using a Bonferroni correction
for the number of tests). Taxon deletion was then used to
test for the possibility of LBA empirically. A clade of Spelaeogriphacea and Amphipoda has been recovered in previous studies [5,6], but this clade is not supported by
unique morphological characters [3], and both taxa have
long terminal branches. When Spelaeogriphacea was
deleted from the MOL analysis the tree remained otherwise unchanged, with Amphipoda remaining the sister
group to Bathynellacea. However, when Amphipoda was
removed (Figure 10), the position of Spelaeogriphacea
changed dramatically, becoming the sister group of Tanaidacea. This strongly suggests the possibility that Spelaeogriphacea is artificially attracted to Amphipoda, which is
consistent with the zero length of the branch supporting
the clade.
We stress that relative rate tests, likelihood ratio tests,
taxon deletion experiments and comparisons of trees generated from different data partitions and using different
methods cannot prove LBA, but they are suggestive of this
explanation (or, at very least, consistent with it). None of
our tests allowed us to discount the possibility of longbranch artefacts.
The impact of taxa on inferred relationships
We also measured the impact of individual taxa upon
inferred relationships in a more exhaustive way using first
order jackknifing (Figures 3, 4, 1). In general terms, the
two measures of impact (RF and d1) were very strongly
correlated for taxa on each tree. Moreover, there was a
wide range of values for the terminals on each tree, some
taxa having no effect and others having a more marked
impact. However, when comparing the morphological
(MOR), molecular (MOL) and total evidence (MOLMOR)
trees, the same taxa behaved very differently. This is consistent with our finding of conflicting signals in the morphological and molecular partitions. In the MOR dataset,
eucarids had a higher impact on average than peracarids,
and the most influential ingroup taxa were Euphausiacea,
Amphionidacea and Lophogastrida. For the MOL data,
peracarids are more influential than eucarids, although
this may reflect differences in taxon sampling. Even
closely related taxa (i.e., different species within the Mysida and Isopoda) can have very different impacts (Figure
3), which underlines the importance of adequate taxon
sampling.
Leaf stability
Maximum leaf stability based on bootstrapping is illustrated for the parsimony analysis of morphology, the
combined molecular dataset, and the total evidence dataset (Figures 3, 4, 1). The leaf stabilities of all taxa in each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/21

when morphological and molecular evidence are combined, morphology conflicts strongly with all molecular
partitions. Notwithstanding, the morphological signal
has a strong effect on the relationships inferred in the
MOLMOR tree (especially for the parsimony analysis),
which differs considerably from the MOL tree. We
acknowledge that such differences may also result from
differences in taxon sampling. However, strong conflict
between molecular and morphological evidence has been
noted before for eumalacostracan relationships [3,5],
although it had not been quantified in a combined analysis. Our analyses demonstrate that some of the conflict
hitherto flagged up as "surprising" or "disturbing" (notably the sister group relationship between Spelaeogriphacea and Amphipoda based on 18S rRNA) dissolves
because of equivocal molecular evidence and possible
LBA.

of these analyses were very similar. Hence, no taxa reduce
branch support spectacularly more than their neighbours.
Again, the trends (insofar as these can be detected) are different for the three analyses, which reflects the different
signals present.

Discussion
This is the first study to attempt to resolve eumalacostracan phylogeny using a combination of evidence from
multiple molecular loci and morphology. Our results variously confirm or reject previously proposed phylogenetic
hypotheses, although it should be stressed that many conclusions remain tentative in the absence of unequivocal
phylogenetic signals. The most striking findings are the
relatively strong conflict between molecular and morphological evidence, and the probable effects of systematic
error (including possible LBA) on these and previously
published results. Although the ILD tests for the restricted
15 taxon dataset suggest that the nuclear and mitochondrial partitions are mutually conflicting, the PBS analysis
instead reveals that in most cases of molecular conflict, it
is the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I partition that conflicts with the remaining molecular partitions. However,

We stress that the clade support measures in our analyses
are generally low. Hence, while molecular and morphological conflict is relatively strong, neither signal is especially robust. However, given the level of interest in the
conflict between molecular and morphological trees
[53,54], it will be interesting to revisit the issue with new
datasets in the future.
Clade support values
In both the MOL and MOLMOR analyses, posterior probabilities and bootstrap support values were generally
insignificant for nodes uniting higher-level taxa. This is
unsurprising given that analyses of the separate molecular
partitions also had poor support. What was surprising,
however, was that in the Bayesian MOL analysis, a clade
of Bathynellacea + Amphipoda had one of the three highest posterior probabilities (0.93), but was nevertheless
"supported" by a branch not significantly longer than
zero. This result was not apparent from branch lengths
alone. The anomaly occurred because Bathynellacea was
represented by mitochondrial data alone, whereas branch
lengths were scaled as the expected number of changes per
site. This finding highlights the need for caution when
interpreting clade support measures, especially posterior
probabilities that are lower than 0.95 [55].
Branch lengths, relative rates, and LBA
Two striking features of previous molecular phylogenetic
analyses [5,6,15] are the combination of short internal
branches and long terminal branches, and conspicuous
differences in the terminal branch lengths of ingroup taxa.
In particular, non-mysid peracarid species exhibit much
longer branches than the remaining taxa. Because these
long-branch taxa group together, and because some of the
longest branching taxa surprisingly resolve as sister groups
in the absence of morphological support (Amphipoda
and Spelaeogriphacea), it is possible that these relation-

otide-substitution rates among lineages for a given topology." We question these conclusions for several reasons.

ships are affected by LBA. Spears et al. (2005) [5] noted
these long branches, and concluded (p. 142) that they can
generally be "viewed as an indication that a lineage either
has had an ancient divergence followed by an extended
period of independent evolution or has an accelerated
rate of evolution." They rejected the latter possibility in
favour of the former, because "a likelihood-ratio test did
not find evidence of significant heterogeneity in nucle-

Firstly, if their likelihood-ratio test indicated that all
sequences evolved according to a molecular clock, one
would not anticipate pronounced differences in branch
lengths between taxa. The only way a molecular tree of
extant species can accommodate terminal branches of differing lengths under a clock is if internal branches are also
of different but complementary lengths so as to average
out apparent rates. This does not appear to be the case in
Spears et al.'s phylograms. Secondly, Spears et al. preferred ancient divergence as the explanation for long
branch lengths because LB taxa such as Spelaeogriphacea
have a Palaeozoic fossil record. However, they also noted
that equally ancient taxa may have markedly shorter
branch lengths. Thirdly, our own likelihood-ratio test on
the 18S rRNA data partition strongly rejected rate constancy, a finding congruent with the distance-based relative rate test. In fact, when the distance-based test is
performed while not taking tree topology into account
(i.e., considering every taxon as a separate lineage), Spelaeogriphacea is found to evolve at a rate significantly
faster than any other included species, with the exception
of the fastest evolving amphipod.
Strong rate heterogeneity and very short internal branches
(indistinguishable from zero for several groupings) mean
that LBA is likely to be a problem in our 18S rRNA and
other data partitions. The outcome of distance-based relative rate tests has been used to exclude fast clock taxa from
phylogenetic analyses to prevent LBA [44,45]. Following
this advice would have made the present study impossible
(at least for the 18S rRNA data). This conclusion is supported by analyses of the combined MOL and MOLMOR
data sets, where exclusion of Amphipoda (the longest
branch taxon after Spelaeogriphacea) caused Spelaeogriphacea to significantly change position, grouping
instead with another long branch taxon (Tanaidacea).
Worryingly, our relative rates tests confirm the prediction
(based on branch length differences in 18S rRNA trees),

topologies. In the light of our results, however, we are
convinced that this would be largely futile for available
data. The combined phylogenetic signals in the molecular
and morphological partitions are clearly insufficient to
resolve a robust phylogeny. Tweaking the analyses in
increasingly sophisticated ways is unlikely to change this.
Instead, future time and effort should be invested in
enlarging the molecular and morphological datasets. In
particular, we advocate the pursuit of data from hitherto
unexploited nuclear markers.

Conclusion
Despite the combination of molecular and morphological
evidence, eumalacostracan relationships remain tenuous.
A consensus based on the total evidence analyses, and
supported by clades with at least a posterior probability of
90 or 70% bootstrap, yields just four clades:
1. Euphausiacea + Stomatopoda
2. Reptantia (Decapoda) + Stomatopoda
3. Anaspidacea + Stomatopoda + Euphausiacea + Decapoda
4. Amphipoda + Bathynellacea

that subclades have characteristic but very disparate rates.
The trees of Meland & Willassen (2007) [6] illustrate this
well: slow evolving mysids, euphausiaceans, and stomatopods form one clade, while the fastest evolving decapods
group with a clade of fast evolving peracarids, thereby
making Decapoda paraphyletic.
Additional sequence and phylogenetic analyses: flogging a
dead crab?
Although this is arguably the most methodologically thorough investigation of eumalacostracan phylogeny to date,
we acknowledge that it could be refined in several ways.
Among other things refinements could include additional
exploratory analyses of data signal and conflict, separate
analyses of stems and loops for the ribosomal genes, the
use of different or simultaneous sequence alignments,
incorporation of the very latest morphological evidence
[56], or likelihood testing of alternative phylogenetic

Two caveats apply. Firstly, the first and second clades are
in conflict, and based on Bayesian and parsimony analysis, respectively. Secondly, the branch supporting the
fourth clade is not significantly different from zero length.
The third clade is the higher-level clade with the highest
support to emerge from both the Bayesian and parsimony
analyses of both combined molecular and total evidence
analyses. It is the only Bayesian clade with statistically significant clade support (based on total evidence). The reasons for this lack of resolution include the significant
conflict between morphology and molecules, the sensitivity of inferred relationships to the inclusion of morphological data, the low clade support values in both Bayesian
and parsimony analyses, the very short internal branches,
the heterogeneous substitution rates between taxa, the
possibility of LBA, and the disagreement between Bayesian and parsimony analyses of combined MOLMOR evidence.
The fossil record indicates that Malacostraca evolved no
later than the Silurian [7,57,58] and Eumalacostraca no
later than the Devonian. Most major eumalacostracan lineages appear in the Carboniferous. The short internal
branches separating major groups in our trees may indicate an initial, rapid radiation, consistent with the fossil
record. This would make phylogenetic reconstruction
especially difficult. Current evidence may be insufficient

to resolve such ancient divergences: a problem that additional data may yet solve.
Higher-level metazoan phylogenetics has advanced
greatly in recent years, and lessons learned in this endeavour may be applied to the eumalacostracan problem (for
an overview see [59]). Both groups probably radiated rapidly, and while the Metazoa clearly did so earlier, the
antiquity of the two divergences is of the same order of
magnitude. Molecular phylogenies of both groups were
based initially on rRNA sequences. Although these
informed a greatly revised understanding of metazoan
phylogeny, the limitations of relying on these loci alone
have become clear too.
Workers seeking to expand the nuclear and mitochondrial
dataset for Eumalacostraca must consider carefully the
issue of taxon sampling. Given the potential for LBA, fast
evolving species should be avoided. When included,
exploratory analyses for the potential of LBA are necessary. For example, a recent study of 18S rRNA data for stygiomysids concluded that they are not related to mysids,
but are rather the sister group of Mictacea [6]. However
(although not included in our dataset here), a preliminary
analysis indicated that stygiomysids share a high substitution rate with mictaceans, while mysids evolve significantly slower. Moreover, when Mictacea was deleted from
the analysis, stygiomysids jumped to a very different position in the tree, appearing as the sister group to slow
evolving decapods. This at least admits to the possibility
that their phylogenetic position based on 18S rRNA evidence is an LBA artefact.
Species sampling within higher taxa should be increased
as well. The results of our taxon deletion experiments (Figure 10) suggest that certain species within given higher
taxa (e.g., mysids and isopods) may have disproportionate effects on tree topology. However, given the benefits
and increasing ease of generating larger amounts of data
[60], we believe that the most efficient strategy is to
exploit new markers. Specifically, we advocate the use of
nuclear protein coding genes for several reasons. Firstly,
the acknowledged benefits of nuclear coding genes. There
is a vast reservoir of nuclear loci evolving at a variety of
rates that are able to address divergences at a range of
depths. Not only can these be aligned more confidently
via amino acid translation, but also amino acid sequences
offer one possible way to ameliorate LBA effects that may
plaque analysis of nucleotide sequences. Secondly, and
more specifically, large phylogenomic data sets are based
on nuclear protein coding loci. Testing the utility of these
same markers for Eumalacostraca (and other lower level
arthropod taxa) will foster integration of these independ-

ent subtrees via primary data, which maximizes explanatory power. When the subtrees are based on minimally
overlapping or isolated datasets, by contrast, we limit ourselves to integrating them through supertree methods
[61].
