Abstract
Background: Citrus sudden death (CSD), a disease that rapidly kills orange trees, is an emerging
threat to the Brazilian citrus industry. Although the causal agent of CSD has not been definitively
determined, based on the disease's distribution and symptomatology it is suspected that the agent
may be a new strain of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). CTV genetic variation was therefore assessed in
two Brazilian orange trees displaying CSD symptoms and a third with more conventional CTV
symptoms.
Results: A total of 286 RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 284 heat shock protein 70
homolog (HSP70h) gene fragments were determined for CTV variants infecting the three trees. It
was discovered that, despite differences in symptomatology, the trees were all apparently
coinfected with similar populations of divergent CTV variants. While mixed CTV infections are
common, the genetic distance between the most divergent population members observed (24.1%
for RdRp and 11.0% for HSP70h) was far greater than that in previously described mixed infections.
Recombinants of five distinct RdRp lineages and three distinct HSP70h lineages were easily
detectable but respectively accounted for only 5.9 and 11.9% of the RdRp and HSP70h gene
fragments analysed and there was no evidence of an association between particular recombinant
mosaics and CSD. Also, comparisons of CTV population structures indicated that the two most
similar CTV populations were those of one of the trees with CSD and the tree without CSD.
Conclusion: We suggest that if CTV is the causal agent of CSD, it is most likely a subtle feature
of population structures within mixed infections and not merely the presence (or absence) of a
single CTV variant within these populations that triggers the disease.

Background
Diseases caused by the aphid-borne Closterovirus, Citrus
tristeza virus (CTV), are among the greatest threats to citrus
production worldwide. CTV has a c.a. 19.3 Kb single
stranded positive sense RNA genome encoding 19 proteins expressed from 12 open reading frames (ORFs) that
is the largest amongst the known closteroviruses [1]. A
large amount of phenotypic diversity has been detected
amongst CTV isolates characterized from around the
world, with the identified strains differing from one
another in the symptoms they induce in different citrus
genotypes or their aphid transmissibility [2-9].
Since 2001, an emergent disease, called citrus sudden
death (CSD), has caused the death or eradication of four
million orange trees throughout the Brazilian states of
Minas Gerais and São Paulo [10]. The disease is continuing to spread and epidemiological studies indicate that
the casual agent is possibly distributed by an air-borne
vector [11]. One curiosity of the disease is that it has
almost exclusively been reported in trees comprising a
sweet orange graft onto a Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia
Osb.) rootstock. Neither Rangpur lime nor sweet orange
appear sensitive to the disease in isolation and diseased
trees can sometimes be salvaged by removing the sweet
orange graft.
There is some circumstantial evidence implicating CTV as
a casual agent of CSD: (1) Trees presenting with CSD
symptoms are invariably infected with CTV (Fundecitrus,
personal communication); (2) CSD and CTV have similar
epidemiological properties [11] and (3) CTV induces
symptoms that present and develop in a similar manner
to those occurring in trees with CSD [12]. It remains to be
confirmed, however, whether CSD is caused by some
novel CTV variant, another citrus-infecting virus (for
example a marafivirus) [13] or some synergistic interaction between CTV and one or more other infectious
agents. Due to its unknown etiology, no serological or
molecular tools are available for diagnosing CSD and currently the only reasonably reliable indicator of the disease
is yellowing of the phloem vessel system in the tissues of
rootstocks.
In an attempt to identify genetic features of CTV that may
be associated with CSD, two loci within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the HSP70 homologue
(HSP70h) genes were extensively sampled from CTV populations infecting three trees – two with CSD and one
without the disease. While significant differences in the
population structures of the viruses in the three trees were
observed, it was not possible to definitively associate any
of these with CSD. While our results demonstrate extraordinary Brazilian CTV genetic diversity and intraspecific
recombination within individual plants they also indicate

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/9

that it is unlikely to simply be the occurrence of a single
CTV genetic variant within these mixed CTV infections
that causes the disease.

Results and Discussion
Within tree CTV populations are unexpectedly diverse
Preliminary analyses of the pairwise genetic distances
between the 286 RdRp and 284 HSP70h sequences from
the three trees indicated that all were infected with a
diverse range of CTV genotypes. Previous analyses of CTV
mixed infections have revealed within host CTV population structures that are expected for RNA virus quasispecies: One or two predominant genotypes (>30% of the
population) and a number of closely related variants of
these [2,6,9]. The CTV populations in the three Brazilian
trees analyzed here are extraordinarily diverse by comparison with these previously described populations. For
example, the most diverse population of CTV sequences
in an individual tree described by Sentandreu et al. [9] was
for isolate T385 at the p20 locus. Out of 30 sequences
sampled from T385, ten unique haplotypes were identified. The total number of haplotypes identified amongst
451 p20 and 274 p18 sequences sampled from six trees
(originating in Spain and Japan) were 35 and 23 respectively. By contrast sequence analysis of the 286 RdRp and
284 HSP70h gene fragments sampled from amongst the
three Brazilian orange trees here revealed a total of 76
RdRp and 153 HSP70h haplotypes.

The minimum pairwise sequence identities observed in
individual Brazilian trees were 75.9% for two RdRp
sequences from tree C3 and 89.0% for two HSP70h
sequences from tree C5. In all the trees we observed that
RdRp diversity was greater than that of HSP70h. Although
the HSP70h gene, which has an important function in virion assembly [14,15], is characteristically more conserved
than the RdRp gene, we have paradoxically sampled
approximately twice as many HSP70h haplotypes.
Potential associations between specific CTV variants CSD
We therefore used a mixture of recombination and phylogenetic analyses to characterize the complex populations
of CTV RdRp and HSP70h sequences found in the three
trees. Since recombination has been previously reported
in CTV [2,16] and is a process that violates the assumptions of conventional phylogenetic reconstruction methods (such as neighbor joining, and maximum likelihood)
[17], we sought to remove all obviously recombinant
sequences from our dataset prior to phylogenetic analysis.
We used a battery of recombination analysis methods
implemented in RDP3 to identify and remove 17 RdRp
and 32 HSP70h sequences that were obviously recombinant.

trees. (A) Largely recombination free maximum likelihood phylogeny of 269 RdRp gene fragment sequences. Sequences sampled from trees C3, C5 (both with CSD) and C6 (without CSD) are represented by blue, green and red dots respectively. Multiple dots on particular branches represent identical sequences. Whereas branches with more than 75% bootstrap support are
labeled with filled black diamonds, those with between 50 and 74% support are labeled with unfilled black diamonds. Sequence
lineages R1a, R1b, R2, R3 and R4 are indicated. (B) The mosaic structures of obviously recombinant sequences excluded from

lineages in A. Coloured dots beside the schematic representations of the recombinant sequences represent the numbers and
origins of recombinant sequences sharing similar mosaics. (C) The relative population representation of different major RdRp
lineages identified in A.

Maximum likelihood trees constructed using the remaining 269 RdRp and 252 HSP70h sequences (Figures 1A and
2A) indicated that, with a few exceptions, the sequences
obtained from all three orange trees respectively fell into
four and three distinct (>75% bootstrap support) RdRp
and HSP70h lineages. The lineages were arbitrarily named
R1 through R4 for the RdRp sequences and H1 through
H3 for the HSP70h sequences. The R1 lineage was further
divided into R1a and R1b groups on the basis of there
being >50% boostrap support for a small but distinct R1b
lineage. Whereas the R1b, R4 and H2 lineages contained

only sequences sampled from trees C3 and C6, the R2 lineage contained only sequences sampled from trees C5 and
C6. There was no lineage containing only sequences sampled from the trees with CSD (C3 and C5).
We examined the inferred mosaic structures of the recombinant sequences identified previously and determined
that most were clearly recombinants between the major
lineages (Figs 1B and 2B). While we cannot rule out the
possibility that some of these recombinants might be RTPCR artifacts, the occurrence of nearly identical recom-

binant mosaics in different trees strongly suggests that at
least three of the RdRp recombinants (RM1, RM3, and
RM5) and four of the HSP70h recombinants (HM1, HM2,
HM4, and HM7) are genuine. As none of these recombinants were found in both of the trees with CSD, they can
also be excluded as causal agents of the disease.

iants within a mixed CTV infection are key to the development of CSD will require the construction of numerous
infectious CTV full genome clones and a mechanism for
artificially recreating complex mixed infections such as
we've described here.

Methods
Interestingly, all seven of these "shared" recombinants
were detected in the tree without CSD, C6, and one of the
trees with CSD (C3). Also, no HSP70h recombinants and
only one class of RdRp recombinant (RM2) was found in
C5, the other tree with CSD. One obvious reason for the
lack of recombinants in tree C5 is that it was a much
younger tree than the other two at the time of sampling.
Analysis of the relative population representations of the
two CTV gene lineages in the different trees (Figs 1C and
2C) also indicated that the CTV populations in the two
older trees, C6 and C3 were substantially more similar to
one another than either was to the CTV population in C5.
There is no obvious association between CSD and CTV
population structure
Genetic differences between CTV population structures in
the three trees were quantified using Hudson, Boos and
Kaplan's Kst* statistic [18]. Although CTV population
structures were found to be significantly different between
all trees (permutation test p-value < 0.001 for all tree and
loci comparisons), the populations of both the RdRp and
HSP70h sequences in trees C3 (with CSD) and C6 (without CSD) were substantially more similar to one another
(Kst* = 0.037 for RdRp and 0.015 for HSP70h) than the
populations in either tree were to populations sampled
from tree C5 (for RdRp Kst* = 0.15 and 0.16 for comparisons of C5 with C3 and C6 respectively; for HSP70h Kst*
= 0.042 and 0.051 for comparisons of C5 with C3 and C6
respectively). Unlike the association between CTV virulence and population structures observed by Sentandreu
et al. [9], there therefore appears to be no simple association between population structures and CSD in these
three Brazilian CTV trees.

Conclusion
We have determined that the two sampled trees with CSD
(C3 and C5) have more divergent population structures
than one of these trees (C3) has compared to a tree without the disease (C6). Our analysis therefore suggests that,
rather than a recombinant CTV variant or obvious differences between the population structures of mixed CTV
infections, the most likely hypothesis relating CTV infections and CSD is that it may be caused by the occurrence
and interaction of two or more specific CTV sequence variants within these mixed infections. If nothing else this
study indicates that it may be extremely difficult to fulfill
Koch's postulates for potential causes of CSD. Properly
demonstrating that the existence of specific sequence var-

Virus sample collection
Three natural Brazilian CTV populations were surveyed.
These were obtained from: A tree without CSD symptoms,
C6 (12 years old), collected at Araraquara in São Paulo
(SP) state and two trees with CSD symptoms, C3 (6 years
old) and C5 (2 years old), collected at Colômbia, in SP
state and at Comendador Gomes in Minas Gerais (MG)
state, respectively. The three sampling locations were on
an approximately 300 Km long straight line with C3 in the
middle, approximately 200 Km from C6 and 100 Km
from C5. Rootstock (Rangpur lime) phloem, specifically
that showing yellowing symptom characteristic of CSD,
was collected, initially stored on dry ice, and then frozen
at -80°C until further processing.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)
CTV genomic RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (QUIAGEN, Valencia, CA) from triturated
phloem parts with liquid nitrogen in a coffee grinder. Two
pairs of specific RT-PCR primers were designed for amplification of a 542 bp RdRp fragment and a 564 bp HSP70h
fragment using six complete CTV genome sequences

fectprep gel clearnup kit (Eppendorf). Adenosine residues
were added to the 3' ends of purified DNA fragments
using Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) with dATP for 30 min
at 70°C. Then, the DNA was cloned into pGEM-T
(Promega) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α by
electroporation [19]. For each of the two amplified gene
regions plasmid DNA was purified from 300 transformed
colonies using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega). Nucleotide sequences of
these clones were determined in both directions using SP6
and T7 primers and an ABI Prism DNA sequencer 377
(Perkin-Elmer). Sequence quality control and individual
sequence assemblies using reads from both strands were
performed using the Staden package [20].
Sequence analyses
RdRp and HSP70h fragments were aligned along with corresponding sequences from ten full length CTV genomes
sampled from around the world ([GenBank:AF260651,
GenBank:NC_001661,
GenGenBank:U16304,

Japan, [GenBank:Y18420, GenBank:AY170468, GenBank:DQ151548] from Spain, [GenBank:DQ272579]
from Mexico and [GenBank:AY340974] from Egypt)
using the ClustalW method (with default settings) [21]
implemented in Mega (version 3.1) [22]. Columns of the
alignment containing indels or missing data for any of the
sequences were excluded from analyses leaving indel-free
alignments containing 499 and 411 columns of HSP70h
and RdRp sequence respectively. Pair-wise Hamming distances between the sequences in each alignment were calculated using DNAMAN (Lynnon Corporation, Canada).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/9

Genetic distances between populations sampled from different trees were estimated with DnaSP [32] using Hudson, Boos and Kaplan's Kst* statistic [18]. Significant
differences between estimated Kst* values were determined with a permutation test (1000 replicates) also
implemented in DnaSP.

Recombination amongst the sequences in the two alignments was analyzed using the RDP [23], GENECONV
[24], BOOTSCAN [25], MAXCHI [26], CHIMAERA [27],
SISCAN [28] and 3SEQ [29] methods implemented in
RDP3 [30]. Default settings were used throughout and
only potential recombination events detected by two or
more of the above methods coupled with phylogenetic
evidence of recombination were considered significant.
Also, the severity of Bonferroni correction during detection was minimized by only searching for recombinant
signals in a single sequence within groups of sequences
sharing >99.7% sequence identity.
