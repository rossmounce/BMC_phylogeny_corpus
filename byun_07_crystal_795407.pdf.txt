Abstract
Background: EstE1 is a hyperthermophilic esterase belonging to the hormone-sensitive lipase
family and was originally isolated by functional screening of a metagenomic library constructed from
a thermal environmental sample. Dimers and oligomers may have been evolutionally selected in
thermophiles because intersubunit interactions can confer thermostability on the proteins. The
molecular mechanisms of thermostabilization of this extremely thermostable esterase are not well
understood due to the lack of structural information.
Results: Here we report for the first time the 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of EstE1. The
three-dimensional structure of EstE1 exhibits a classic α/β hydrolase fold with a central parallelstranded beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices on both sides. The residues Ser154, Asp251, and
His281 form the catalytic triad motif commonly found in other α/β hydrolases. EstE1 exists as a
dimer that is formed by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges. Circular dichroism spectroscopy
and heat inactivation kinetic analysis of EstE1 mutants, which were generated by structure-based
site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues participating in EstE1 dimerization, revealed that
hydrophobic interactions through Val274 and Phe276 on the β8 strand of each monomer play a
major role in the dimerization of EstE1. In contrast, the intermolecular salt bridges contribute less
significantly to the dimerization and thermostability of EstE1.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that intermolecular hydrophobic interactions are essential for
the hyperthermostability of EstE1. The molecular mechanism that allows EstE1 to endure high
temperature will provide guideline for rational design of a thermostable esterase/lipase using the
lipolytic enzymes showing structural similarity to EstE1.

Background
Lipolytic enzymes, including esterases or carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) and lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), catalyze the
stereospecific hydrolysis, transesterification, and conversion of a variety of amines and primary and secondary
alcohols [1-3]. Esterases and carboxylesterases hydrolyze
partly-soluble fatty acid esters with acyl chain lengths of
less than 10 carbon atoms [4], whereas lipases act on
water-insoluble long-chain triglycerides. Many lipases
and esterases have been isolated from a variety of microorganisms, animals, plants, and metagenomes [4,5].
Thermostable esterases/lipases originate from thermophiles. Their extraordinary thermodynamic stability
allows these enzymes to function in organic solvents, and
at elevated temperatures that approach or exceed 100°C
[5,6]. Despite the many biotechnological and industrial
applications of thermostable lipolytic enzymes, only less
than one dozen of them have been isolated from thermophiles, hyperthermophiles, and metagenomes from
thermal environments [4-6]. We recently reported a new
hormone-sensitive esterase/lipase (HSL) family [7] hyperthermostable esterase, EstE1, which was isolated by functional screening of a metagenomic DNA librariy
constructed from a thermal environment sample [5].
EstE1 is composed of 311 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa. It
exhibits an esterase activity on short chain acyl derivatives
of length C4–C6 at temperatures of 30 to 90°C, and is stable at temperatures exceeding 90°C [5,8] The amino acid
sequence of EstE1 is significantly similar to other thermostable HSL-family esterases, including an esterase from
hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis
(64%) [9], the esterase AFEST from hyperthermophilic
archaeon Archeoglobus fulgidus (57%) [10], and the esterase EST2 from thermophilic bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (51%) [8] Recently, the three-dimensional
(3D) structure of EstE1 was predicted by homology modeling using the AFEST esterase as a reference [8]. Structure
and sequence-based analyses for the thermostability
determinants of EstE1 identified multiple intramolecular
ion-pair networks and hydrophobic interactions critical
for the thermostability of EstE1 [8].
Dimers and oligomers are often the functional form of
proteins and may have been evolutionarily selected to
confer thermostability on the proteins in thermopiles
because subunit associations can result in extra stabilization of the proteins. Indeed, many enzymes from thermophilic organisms are capable of forming higher order
oligomers [11-15], but only a few have been studied in
detail to determine what interfacial interactions are
responsible for their thermostability. Here we report for
the first time the crystal structure of EstE1 at 2.1-Å resolution. By structural and functional analysis of the ther-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/47

mostability determinants of EstE1, we found that EstE1
dimerization through hydrophobic interactions is the
major contributor for the hyperthermostability of EstE1.

Results
Structure of the EstE1 monomer
The 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of the selenomethionine derivative of EstE1 was determined in space group
P41212 (unit cell dimensions of a = b = 73.71 Å, c = 234.23
Å, and α = β = γ = 90°) with two independent molecules
per asymmetric unit, by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. Several cycles of simulated
annealing, minimization, and B group refinement using
the program CNS [16], followed by manual model
rebuilding, reduced the R values for all the data in the resolution range of 50.0–2.1 Å. The Rfactor of the present
model is 22.3% with an Rfree value of 26.4%. The crystallographic statistics for data collection and refinement are
summarized in Table 1.

The final structure of EstE1 displayed a nearly ellipsoidal
shape with approximate dimensions of 46 Å × 47 Å × 57
Å (Figure 1). It has the classical features of an α/β hydroTable 1: Data collection and refinement statistics

lase fold [17] consisting of a central eight-stranded mixed
β-sheet surrounded by the five helices α3 (Asp93-Ser103),
α4 (Thr122-Leu141), α5 (Ala155-Ser170), α8 (Leu253Ser267), and α9 (Asp291-Leu308). The electron density
of the N-terminal 16 residues, which is expected to
include the α1 (Lys8-Arg13) helix, was disordered.
Strands β1 and β3 – β8 are parallel but the β2 strand is
antiparallel to the others. The β1 and β8 strands are
rotated approximately 90° because β2–β7 sheets are in
the counter-clockwise direction starting from the position
of the β1 strand and extending to that of the β8 strand.
These β strands form an α/β fold core domain, which is
the canonical architecture of an α/β hydrolase [17]. EstE1
also contains a similar cap domain present in other members of the HSL family [18-20]. The cap domain consists
of two separated helical regions (containing residues 1–41
and 193–218) and locates to the upper region of the central β-sheet. The helices α1 (not shown in Figure 1; residues 9–14), α2 (residues 23–41), α6 (residues 193–200),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/7/47

α7 (residues 208–218), two 310-helices (G2 and G3), and
several random coils between these helices constitute the
cap domain.
Active site architecture: catalytic triad and substratebinding pocket
The activity of α/β hydrolases primarily depends on a catalytic triad formed by Ser, His, and Asp/Glu residues
[17,21,22]. The active site of EstE1 also resides in a canonical position (Figure 1) inferred from known structures of
α/β hydrolases [17]. The key nucleophile Ser154, which is
found in a highly conserved Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly pentapeptide
(X denotes any amino acid) [10,20], locates to the apex of
the nucleophilic elbow. The nucleophile backbone φ and
ψ angles for Ser154 lie in an unfavorable region of the
Ramanchandran plot (φ = 59° and ψ = -121°) because of
the sharpness of the turn connecting the β5 strand and α5
helix. A hydrogen bond (3.1 Å) between the OG atom of
Ser154 and NE2 atom of His281 stabilizes the conformation of the nucleophile Ser154. The proton carrier residues His281 and Asp251 that form the charge-relay
network locate to the carboxyl edge of β-strands 7 and 8,
respectively. The side-chains of His281 and Asp251 are
stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds formed by the
ND1 atom of His281 and the OD2 atom of Asp251 (2.7
Å), the NE2 atom of His281 and the OG atom of Ser154
(3.1 Å), the OD1 atom of Asp251 and the NH atom of
Leu253 (2.8 Å), and the O atom of Asp251 and the N
atom of Arg254 (3.0 Å).

The substrate-binding pocket of EstE1 extends approximately 16 Å from the protein surface to the catalytic
Ser154 residue. The deep hydrophobic cleft is funnelshaped and its entrance is surrounded by three α-helices
(α2, α6, and α7), the 310-helix G3 (Phe283–Phe289), and
the loop regions (Ile14-Ser22 and Ala201-Pro207). The
sequence motif His-Gly-Gly-Gly (residues 80–83), which
is conserved in the HSL family [20], is upstream of the
active site. It is involved in hydrogen bonding for stabilization of the oxyanion hole formed by Gly82, Gly83, and
Ala155. Residue Gly81 is fixed by hydrogen bonds
between its amino group and the OD1 atom of Asp153
(3.1 Å), and between the carbonyl group of Gly81 and the
ND1 atom of His30 (2.6 Å).

respectively. G2 and G3 represent 310-helices. Helix α1 is

and C termini, respectively.

Hydrophobic interactions essential for the dimerization of
EstE1
EstE1 exists as a dimer in solution. An EstE1 dimer has 2fold crystallographic symmetry and displays an extensive
dimeric interface spanning over 128 Å2 (Figure 2A).
Assuming two molecules comprise an asymmetric unit,
the Matthews coefficient VM was calculated to be 2.2 Å3/
Da, which corresponds to a solvent content of 44.1%.
EstE1 dimerization is primarily mediated by hydrophobic
interactions in the middle of the interface and is assisted

of Lys177B on the β6 strand and Glu295A on the α9 helix. (D) A detailed view of the hydrophobic interaction interface

of AFEST are supported by hydrogen bonds between Tyr280 and Gln303, and by a weak hydrophobic interaction through

by salt bridges at both ends of the interface (Figure 2B).
The dimeric interface is characterized by the formation of
β-sheet between the two monomers by an antiparallel
association between two C-terminal β8 strands. We identified two salt bridges, Lys177 (on the β6 strand)-Glu295
(on the α9 helix) and Arg270 (on the loop between α8
helix and β8 strand)-Asp291 (on the α9 helix) (Figure
2C). These interactions exhibit centrosymmetric configuration toward the center of the interface. We also identified hydrophobic interactions between Val274 (on the β8
strand), Phe276 (on the β8 strand), and Leu299 (on the
α9 helix) (Figure 2D).
The residues responsible for dimerization of EstE1 subunits differ from those of AFEST. A previous study showed
that intermolecular contacts present in AFEST consisted of
hydrogen bonds and salt bridges [19]. Amino acid
sequence alignment revealed that Val274, Phe276, and
Leu299 of EstE1 correspond to Val278, Tyr280, and
Gln303 of AFEST, respectively (Figure 3), but these residues in AFEST did not participate in similar hydrophobic
interactions as observed in EstE1. Instead, hydrogen
bonds between Tyr280A-Gln303B and Tyr280B-Gln303A,
and weak hydrophobic interactions between Val278A and
Val278B, appear to contribute to the intermolecular interactions observed in AFEST (Figure 2E). To verify the roles
of the hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges identified in EstE1 dimer interface, eight EstE1 mutant proteins
containing single or multiple amino acid substitutions
were created. Five EstE1 mutants had disruptions in
hydrophobic interactions. Val274 was replaced with Ala
to generate EstE1V274A. Phe276 was replaced with Ala and

Glu to generate EstE1F276A and EstE1F276E, respectively.
Leu299 was changed to Asp in EstE1L299D. Both Phe276
and Val274 were changed to Ala in EstE1V274A/F276A. In
addition, three EstE1 mutants containing changes in the
residues involved in the salt bridges were generated.
Arg270 and Glu295 residues were replaced with Ala to
generate EstE1R270A and EstE1E295A, respectively. Both of
these amino acids were changed to Ala to generate
EstE1R270A/E295A. All of these mutants were expressed in E.
coli and purified to near-homogeneity from cell extracts
that were not heat-treated, using Ni-affinity chromatography as described previously [8]. Analysis of the molecular
weight of the purified mutant proteins by gel filtration
chromatography (GFC) revealed that EstE1F276E and
EstE1V274A/F276A converted to a monomer of approximately 42 and 38 kDa, respectively, while wild-type EstE1
and other mutants were the size of a dimer with a molecular weight of ~60 kDa (Figure 4). EstE1F276A remained as
a dimer whereas a single mutation of Phe to Glu in
EstE1F276E completely abolished dimerization. This is
likely due to the fact that Ala has a similar hydrophobicity
scale as that of Phe such that EstE1 molecules maintained
their hydrophobic interactions, while change of the Phe to
hydrophilic residue Glu did not permit the formation of
hydrophobic interactions with Val274 in another molecule of EstE1. This result underscores the critical role of
hydrophobic interactions through Phe276. In addition,
even though a single amino acid change in EstE1V274A and
EstE1F276A did not convert them to monomers, the combination of these two mutations in EstE1V274A/F276A abolished its ability to form dimers, suggesting the
hydrophobic interactions involving both Val274 and

Phe276 are important for EstE1 dimerization. Likewise,
native PAGE analysis revealed a faster electrophoretic
mobility of EstE1F276E and EstE1V274A/F276A compared to
that of wild-type EstE1 (data not shown). In contrast, the
EstE1 mutant proteins with Ala substitution of Arg270 or
Asp295 (EstE1R270A and EstE1E295A), and the mutant with
Ala substitution on both of these residues (EstE1R270A/
E295A) were still able to dimerize, indicating salt bridges at
the both ends of the hydrophobic interface are not critical
for EstE1 dimerization.

The relationship between the dimerization and
thermostability of EstE1
To investigate the relationship between the dimerization
and thermostability of EstE1, we compared the thermostability of the EstE1 mutant proteins by thermal denaturation experiments using CD spectroscopy. CD spectra
of all EstE1 mutants in the far-UV region at 20°C were
very similar to that of wild-type EstE1 (Figure 5A), confirming that the integrity of secondary structure of the
mutant proteins was not affected by the introduction of
mutations. We then determined the apparent transition
temperature (Tapp) [8,23] by monitoring changes in secondary structure content in the temperature range of 70 to
110°C (Figure 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the Tapp value for
EstE1F276E and EstE1V274A/F276A, which converted to monomers (Figure 4), showed an approximate 20°C decrease in
Tapp. This demonstrates that both Phe276 and Val274,
which are important for intermolecular hydrophobic
interactions, are critical for thermostability of EstE1. In
contrast, mutations of the residues involved in interfacial
salt bridges did not significantly decrease the Tapp value.

ity. Introduction of mutations to the residues involved in
salt bridges at the EstE1 dimer interface did not induce
conversion of EstE1 dimer to a monomer form (Figure 4).
EstE1R270A and EstE1R270A/E295A displayed a slight decrease
in their thermostability (over 75% activity after incubation for 2 h at 80°C), and EstE1E295A still maintained its
activity (Figure 6). These results suggest that salt bridges
are not the major contributor required for EstE1 dimerization and thermostability, whereas two hydrophobic interfacial spots, Val274 and Phe276 on the β8 strand of two
molecules of EstE1, are critical for EstE1 dimerization and
thermostability.

phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were incubated at 80°C for the
indicated times. Residual activities were then determined by
measuring the amount of p-nitrophenol released by esterasecatalyzed hydrolysis. The activity of a non-incubated sample
was defined as 100%

E295A,

and EstE1Y250F were estimated to be 97.8, 103.7°C,
104, and 98.2°C, respectively. None of these mutants lost
their ability to form dimers (Figure 4), suggesting that
hydrophobic interactions responsible for EstE1 dimerization are the main contributors to the thermostability of
EstE1.

Kinetic analyses of the thermal stability of wild-type and
mutant EstE1 proteins also support the notion that the
thermostability of EstE1 correlates with its ability to form
a dimer (Figure 6). By mutating the sites involved in the
hydrophobic interaction between two molecules of EstE1,
EstE1F276E and EstE1V274A/F276A dramatically lost their
enzyme activities after incubation for 1 h at 80°C. The
estimated half-life values of EstE1F276E and EstE1V274A/
F276A were 6.5 and 29 min, respectively. In contrast, wildtype EstE1 showed no significant decrease in activity even
after incubation for 2 h. EstE1F276A, which did not exist in
a monomeric form, lost approximately 50% of its activity
after incubation for 2 h at 80°C, suggesting that weaker
hydrophobic interactions can be disrupted during heat
denaturation. This result is consistent with the thermal
denaturation pattern of EstE1F276A, displaying an earlier
denaturation profile compared to wild-type EstE1 (Figure
5B). EstE1L299D appeared as a dimer (Figure 4) and
retained a high thermostability, indicating that Leu299 is
not detrimental for EstE1 dimerization and thermostabil-

We determined the crystal structure of EstE1 at 2.1-Å resolution by the SAD method. EstE1 has a characteristic α/
β hydrolase fold with nine alpha helices and an eightstranded β-sheet. The residues Ser154, Asp251, and
His281 of the catalytic triad are found in the canonical
positions observed in a wide variety of α/β hydrolases
[21]. Four members of the HSL family have been structurally characterized. They include an esterase from the mesophilic bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus [24], the BFAE
from the mesophilic bacterium Bacillus subtilis [20], and
two thermophilic esterases, the EST2 from the thermophilic bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius [18],
and the AFEST from the hyperthermophilic archaeon
Archaeoglobus fulgidus [19]. EstE1 is closer in structure to
HSL-family thermostable esterases AFEST (Protein Data
Bank (PDB) code 1JJI; 283 Cα atoms superimposed, rootmean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.3 Å) and EST2 (PDB
code 1EVQ; 280 Cα atoms superimposed, rmsd of 1.5 Å)
than to mesophilic esterases, an esterase from Alcaligenes
eutrophus (PDB code 1QLW; 196 Cα atoms superimposed,
rmsd of 2.7 Å) and BFAE (PDB code 1JKM; 282 Cα atoms
superimposed, rmsd of 2.0 Å).
EstE1 exists as a dimer through hydrophobic interactions
and salt bridges (Figures 1 and 2). The thermostable esterase AFEST, which is most closely related with EstE1 both
in structure and amino acid sequence, also was known to
exist as dimers, and the intermolecular contacts of AFEST
primarily consist of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges [19].
Our comparison of the structures of EstE1 and AFEST
revealed that, although β-sheets of the core domain of
these thermostable esterases are almost identically
arranged, the overall content of secondary structure elements in EstE1 and AFEST show slightly different configurations. EstE1 consists of 39.5% helical and 16.7% βstrand conformations, while AFEST has 43.1% helical and
21.5% β-strand conformations [25]. This suggests that
EstE1 has more turns and loops that might result in
decreased thermostability of EstE1 because, in the order of
mesophilic/thermophilic/hyperthermophilic
proteins,
gradually reduced dimensions in the loop regions are

likely to presented [26]. Nevertheless, EstE1 displays a
higher thermostability compared to AFEST. AFEST had
approximately 50% residual activity after incubation for
30 min at 95°C with a half life of 26 min, whereas EstE1
still displayed > 95% residual activity under the same conditions [8,10]. This hyperthermostability of EstE1 is most
likely due to strong hydrophobic interactions at the
dimeric interface. Alignment of the amino acid sequences
of EstE1 and AFEST revealed that the residues playing a
key role in EstE1 dimerization differ from those of AFEST
(Figures 2E and 3). The hydrophobic residues Val274,
Phe276, and Leu299, which are involved in EstE1 dimerization, correspond to Val278, Tyr280, and Gln303 of
AFEST, respectively. Unlike EstE1, AFEST cannot form
strong hydrophobic interactions through these residues.
AFEST dimers appear to be formed by hydrogen bonds
(Tyr280A-Gln303B and Tyr280B-Gln303A) and weak
hydrophobic interactions between Val278A and Val278B.

BFAE revealed that its dimerization is mediated mainly by
the ionic interactions between side chains of each subunit
(Glu306-Arg319, Glu353-Arg366, Arg357-Asp365 and
Arg357-Asp358), and by the main chain-main chain
hydrogen bonds at the dimeric interface (between the β8
strand of each subunit). Alignment of BAFE and EstE1
amino acid sequences shows that the hydrophobic residues Val274, Phe276, and Leu299 in EstE1 were substituted with the hydrophilic residues, Arg331, Asn333, and
Arg357 in BFAE, respectively (Figure 3). BFAE exists as a
dimeric form in solution [20], like EstE1, but the dimer
interactions are quite distinct in that EstE1 dimer has tight
hydrophobic interactions assisted by ionic interactions,
while BFAE dimerization is mainly mediated by ionic
interactions. Therefore, thermostability of EstE1 is probably explained by hydrophobic interaction-mediated
dimerization not observed in one of its homologous mesophilic esterases, BFAE.

Because hydrophobic effect is considered to be a key feature that leads proteins to fold into its functional configuration [27,28], it also is assumed to be the major force
involved in protein thermostabilization in thermal environments [29]. Kinetic analyses of the thermal stability of
wild-type and mutant EstE1 proteins revealed that the elevated thermostability of EstE1 correlates with its ability to
form dimers (Figures 4 and 6). The activity of EstE1F276E
and EstE1V274A/F276A, which are present as a monomer, was
dramatically diminished when they were incubated at
80°C. Although EstE1 retained its dimeric status upon
mutation of either Val274 or Phe276 to Ala (Figure 4),
mutation of both of these amino acids to Ala (EstE1V274A/
F276A) destabilized the EstE1 and converted it to a monomer in solution. These results suggest that the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions through Val274 and
Phe276 between two molecules of EstE1 largely contribute to the thermostability of EstE1. Mutation of either
Val274 or Phe276 to Ala rendered the mutant proteins
more sensitive to heat denaturation, with the latter mutation being more effective in destabilizing EstE1 dimers
during the course of heat denaturation (Figure 5) and
thermostability kinetic analysis (Figure 6). Our analysis of
the β-sheet stability index (mean curvature value, which
has a smaller value for a more stable residue in the βsheet) [30] predicted the extent to which Val274 and
Phe276 in β-strand 8 contributed to the stability of the
intermolecular β-sheet bridges. The results showed that
the mean curvature of Phe276 (0.059) was smaller than
that of Val274 (0.119), suggesting that alteration of the
more stable residue Phe276 on the β-strand could result
in destabilization of EstE1 dimers by altering the β-strand
conformation. Previously, mesophilic BFAE also was
shown to form a dimer by a network of hydrogen bonds
and ionic interactions [20], but detailed information was
not provided. Our analysis of the dimeric interface of

In our previous work, we compared the sequence and
structure of esterases from thermophiles with that of their
mesophilic counterparts to demonstrate that changes in
the size or packing state of hydrophobic clusters in the
cavity of EstE1 affect its thermostability. Likewise, we also
identified ion-pair networks consisting of Arg61, Arg97,
and Arg147, that contribute to the stabilization of EstE1
in thermal environments [8]. Mutation of Ala75, which is
located in the hydrophobic cavity of EstE1, to Gly in
EstE1A75G more effectively decreased the thermostability
than other mutations of residues involved in intramolecular ion-pair network formation [8]. EstE1A75G, however,
still exhibited ~75% residual activity after incubation for
30 min at 95°C [8], while mutation of Val274 and
Phe276, which were identified in this work as the residues
most critical for EstE1 thermostability, resulted in no
detectable level of activity and ~25% residual activity,
respectively, after incubation for 30 min at 80°C (Figure
6). Together, these results underscore the importance of
hydrophobic interactions-mediated dimerization in the
hyperthermostability of EstE1. A recent analysis of structures and sequences of several hyperthermostable proteins proposed two possible mechanisms for
thermostabilization of proteins, "structure-based" and
"sequence-based" mechanisms of thermostability, which
possibly explain an evolutionary strategy of thermophilic
adaptation of proteins [31]. The authors found that hyperthermophilic archaea possibly used structure-based mechanisms to increase the thermostability of their proteins,
and that the proteins were "de novo"-designed to be more
compact than their mesophilic counterparts. Indeed,
EstE1 has a relatively higher number of van der Walls contacts per residue (126 and 125 for dimer and monomer,
respectively, which is comparable number obtained with
various hyperthermophilic proteins [31]) compared to
the mesophilic BFAE (124 and 122 van der Walls interac-

tions for dimer and monomer, respectively). Thus, compactness of EstE1 structure provides a plausible
explanation for its hyperthermostability. Thermostability
determinants of EstE1 identified in this study and in our
previous work [5] altogether suggest that EstE1 might be
originated from a hyperthermophilic archaeon because its
thermostability mainly relies on the "structure-based'
mechanism as described above. Our experiments-based
prediction of the origin of EstE1 is consistent with the previous data showing that EstE1 is more closely related to
hyperthermophilic archaea-originated HSL-family esterases/lipases, as demonstrated by phylogenetic tree analysis [5].

Conclusion
Our structural analysis of the EstE1 dimer structure identified hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges that contributed to the formation of EstE1 dimers. Site-directed
mutagenesis analysis revealed that hydrophobic interactions through Val274 and Phe276 on the β8 strand at
dimer interface contribute to the formation of EstE1 dimers and their hyperthermostability. Our data along with
the previous ones [8] suggest that the hyperthermostability of EstE1 is likely the result of a delicate balance
between several factors including ion-pair networks and
hydrophobic interactions. Nevertheless, the hyperthermostability of EstE1 seems to be achieved mainly by its
dimerization through hydrophobic interactions, rather
than intermolecular and intramolecular ion-pair networks even though they additively contribute to further
stabilization of EstE1. EstE1 therefore might be evolutionally adapted to thermal environment by its intrinsic structural ability to form compact and stable dimers [31].

Methods
Plasmids
The EstE1 esterase expression vector pET-22b(+)-estE1 has
been previously described [8]. EstE1 mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with two sequential
rounds of PCR using oligonucleotides containing the target mutation as described previously [8]. Primer
sequences are available upon request. The PCR products
were digested with NdeI and NotI and ligated with pET22b(+) (Novagen) to obtain the expression vectors for
EstE1 mutant proteins. The presence of the correct mutation was verified by DNA sequencing.
Expression and purification of EstE1 proteins
EstE1 was expressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells (Novagen)
transformed with pET-22b(+)-estE1 [8]. Cells were cultured at 37°C in liquid M9 medium containing 19 amino
acids and selenomethionine (SeMet) to express SeMetEstE1 protein with a C-terminal six-histidine tag. Protein
expression was induced at 25°C for 12 h by addition of 1
mM
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside.
Cellular

extracts were heat-treated at 80°C for 10 min, and SeMetEstE1 was purified by affinity chromatography using Nicharged Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham
Biosciences) as described previously [32]. Purified EstE1
was stored in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM
NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and
was further concentrated to approximately 10 mg/ml for
crystallization. For biochemical studies of wild-type and
mutant EstE1, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were
transformed with each plasmid construct and recombinant protein was purified from non-heat treated cellular
extracts as described previously [8].
Crystallization and data collection
Crystallization of EstE1 was performed by the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method as described previously
[32]. Briefly, SeMet crystals suitable for data collection
were obtained by mixing 1.5 μl of protein sample and 1.5
μl of reservoir solution (0.1 M Bis-Tris, 0.2 M ammonium
sulfate, 1 M lithium sulfate, pH 6.5) and were equilibrated
against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Before mounting, the
crystals were transferred and soaked in cryo-protective
solution containing 15% ethylene glycol and reservoir
solution. Selenium X-ray single-wavelength anomalous
dispersion (SAD) data of the crystals were collected on a
Bruker Proteum 300 CCD detector at the 6B and 4 MX
beamlines of Pohang Light Source in Korea. Data were
processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL
package [33,34].
Structure determination and refinement
The structure of EstE1 was solved by SAD method. Phasing and automatic tracing was performed using the
SOLVE/RESOLVE package [35]. The expected 8 selenium
sites were identified using SOLVE, and density modification and model building was performed using RESOLVE.
A tracing of Cα for the N-terminal residues (Leu17-Ala20)
and the C-terminal residues (Glu295-Pro310) was conducted manually using the program O, and most residues
fit into the electron density map [35]. Crystal structure
was refined using the program CNS [16]. The quality of
the model was assessed with the program PROCHECK
[36]. van der Waals interactions were calculated using
CCP4 program suite CONTACT [37]. Only the contact
distances between 2.5–5.0 Å were considered. Figures 1
and 2 were prepared using the PyMOL 0.93 software. The
atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for
Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, with accession code 2C7B.
Gel filtration chromatography
Esterase-containing fractions from the Ni-affinity column
were combined and dialyzed against gel filtration column
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5

mM EDTA, pH 7.8), and then subjected to GFC using a
Superdex 200 column (Amersharm Biosciences). Proteins
were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.
Eluates were monitored with a UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. The column was calibrated using
known molecular weight standards to construct a calibration graph from which the molecular weights of the eluted
proteins were calculated.
Circular dichroism
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected on a J-810
spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a
Peltier temperature-control system (Model PTC-423S) as
described previously [8]. Thermal denaturation curves
were obtained by monitoring the change in the molar
ellipticity at 222 nm at a scan rate of 1°C/min in the temperature range of 70 to 110°C. Because of irreversible
unfolding of EstE1 proteins under these CD spectroscopy
conditions, apparent transition temperature (Tapp) values
were estimated by fitting the data using the five-parameter
sigmoid function as described previously [8,23].
Heat inactivation and enzyme assays
Thermostability was analyzed by measuring the residual
activities after incubating the enzymes (6.0 μM in 20 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) at 80°C for various
times. Esterase activity was determined by measuring the
amount of p-nitrophenol released by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caproate as described previously [5].
