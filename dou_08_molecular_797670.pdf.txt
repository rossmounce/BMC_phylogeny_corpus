Abstract
Background: The control of tuberculosis in densely populated cities is complicated by close
human-to-human contacts and potential transmission of pathogens from multiple sources. We
conducted a molecular epidemiologic analysis of 356 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from
patients presenting pulmonary tuberculosis in metropolitan Taipei. Classical antibiogram studies
and genetic characterization, using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number
tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing and spoligotyping, were applied after culture.
Methods: A total of 356 isolates were genotyped by standard spoligotyping and the strains were
compared with in the international spoligotyping database (SpolDB4). All isolates were also
categorized using the 15 loci MIRU-VNTR typing method and combin with NTF locus and RD
deletion analyses.
Results: Of 356 isolates spoligotyped, 290 (81.4%) displayed known spoligotypes and 66 were not
identified in the database. Major spoligotypes found were Beijing lineages (52.5%), followed by
Haarlem lineages (13.5%) and EAI plus EAI-like lineages (11%). When MIRU-VNTR was employed,
140 patterns were identified, including 36 clusters by 252 isolates and 104 unique patterns, and the
largest cluster comprised 95 isolates from the Beijing family. The combination of spoligotyping and
MIRU-VNTR revealed that 236 (67%) of the 356 isolates were clustered in 43 genotypes. Strains
of the Beijing family was more likely to be of modern strain and a higher percentage of multiple
drug resistance than other families combined (P = 0.08). Patients infected with Beijing strains were
younger than those with other strains (mean 58.7 vs. 64.2, p = 0.02). Moreover, 85.3% of infected
persons younger than 25 years had Beijing modern strain, suggesting a possible recent spread in the
young population by this family of TB strain in Taipei.
Conclusion: Our data on MTB genotype in Taipei suggest that MTB infection has not been
optimally controlled. Control efforts should be reinforced in view of the high prevalence of the
Beijing strain in young population and association with drug resistance.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a worldwide healthcare concern and has been characterized as an epidemic by World
Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated one third of
the world's population has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and that 3 million people will die
of the disease per year between now and 2010. The distribution of TB in different geographic regions is characterized by the prevalence of different MTB strains with varied
virulence and drug resistance. Both environmental and
host factors are responsible for the transmission and prevalence of different MTB strains. Although both the incidence and mortality rates of TB in Taiwan have shown a
steady decline since 1950, TB remains a leading notifiable
infectious disease on the island. In 2001, 14,486 cases
were reported, with a notification rate of 64.9 per 100,000
people.
At the molecular level, the global TB epidemic consists of
multiple genotype-specific subepidemics. Different MTB
genotypes can be identified by variation in certain wellcharacterized repetitive sequences, such as the IS6110
transposable element and the direct repeat region [2]. The
Beijing genotype family is well recognized as having a distinct genetic signature, and it is genetically highly conserved [3] even though sequence polymorphisms have
identified four monophyletic subgroups [4]. It is dispersed worldwide yet predominates in certain geographic
areas, particularly in parts of Asia [5,6] and Russia [7]. Its
prevalence in the patient populations of recent studies in
Vietnam and Russia suggests the recent spread to those
areas [8]. It has been proposed that "Beijing" should be
regarded as an emerging genotype family [9].
The association between drug resistance and the Beijing
genotype is well documented in recent medical literature
[3,4,6,10-13]. The geographic variability observed in this
association [4], along with the frequent clustering of
resistant genotypes and their successful spread within the
Russian prison system [7,13] suggests recent colonial
expansion. This is further supported by the evidence that
some strains of the Beijing genotype family retain fitness
despite the acquisition of drug resistance [13]. The Haarlem family genotype has a similar relationship with drug
resistance and rapid clonal expansion [14]. The association of these genotype families with drug-resistant outbreaks clearly demonstrates their epidemic potential
[14,15]. From a TB-control point of view, it is relevant to
understand whether specific genotype families are overrepresented among drug-resistant cases and, in particular,
if these resistant strains are successfully transmitted within
the community. Taipei is a metropolitan city in northern
Taiwan with a population of 2.3 million inhabiting a
basin of 272 square km. The population of Taipei includes
Han Chinese whose ancestors migrated to this island in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/170

the 16th century, the veterans who retreated to the island
in the late 1940s during the Chinese civil war, and the Taiwanese Aborigines, who have resided on this island since
before the 16th century [16]. The prevalence of TB in large
urban areas is complicated by the close human-to-human
contacts and potential multiple sources of MTB strains
from different ethnic and migratory populations. The
goals of this study were therefore to characterize the prevalence of genotypes, cluster pattern, and drug resistance of
MTB isolates in Taipei to provide information for potential transmission and formulation of effective infectioncontrol policy.

Methods
Mycobacterial strains and genomic DNA
A total of 356 samples were randomly collected between
2002 and 2004 from 356 patients at the Tri-Service General Hospital, a large medical center that handles a substantial number of TB patients referred from hospitals
throughout Taipei. All of the patients were sputum microscopy positive and culture positive. Mycobacterial
genomic DNA was extracted from cultured cells as
described previously [17,18]. Resuspending mycobacterial colonies in 100 to 200 μl of distilled H2O and incubating them at 85°C for 30 min obtained genomic DNA.
After centrifugation of the suspension, the supernatant
containing the DNA was removed and stored at -20°C
until further use. The study protocol has been approved
by the institutional review board of the National Health
Research Institutes, Taiwan.
Spoligotyping and spoligotype analysis
Spoligotyping was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Isogen Bioscience B.V., Maarsen,
Netherlands). The resulting spoligotypes were documented under a binary code representing either a positive
or negative hybridization result (n and o, respectively)
and analyzed using the Excel program for grouping and
ordering of the patterns. Spoligotypes common to more
than one strain were designated as shared types (ST) and
assigned a shared international type number (SIT) according to the updated version of the international spoligotype database SpolDB4 [19].
PCR and MIRU analysis
PCRs were carried out using the PCR reagent system
(Gibco-BRL). Sequences of primers used for amplification
of 12 MIRU loci and 3 ETR loci (A, B, C) were selected
according to descriptions in other studies [20]. Five microliters from fivefold-diluted DNA solutions were added to
a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.2 μl of DNA polymerase (1 U); 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP;
5 μl of PCR buffer; 0.4 μM (2 μM for locus 7) of primers;
and 1 to 3.5 mM of MgCl2. The primers and MgCl2 concentrations used were as described by Mazars et al. [21].

The PCR fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with 1.5% agarose. The sizes of the amplicons
were estimated by comparison with 50- and 100-bp ladders. The MIRU copy number per locus was calculated by
using the conventions described by Supply et al. [22].
TbD1 Analysis
According to Brosch et al. [23], TbD1 is specifically
present in the ancestral lineage of MTB. The presence of
TbD1 was analyzed by PCR. Briefly, two PCR assays were
performed per isolate by using either primers complementary to the sequences flanking the deleted region or
primers complementary to the internal sequences. For the
isolates that did (TbD1+) or did not (TbD1-) contain the
TbD1 region, an amplicon was obtained only with internal primers or only with flanking primers, respectively.
NTF locus and RD deletion analysis
A multiplex PCR approach was used to determine possible
IS6110 insertion(s) in the NTF region of M. tuberculosis
strains. The method, including primers within the NTF
region as well as the IS6110 sequence and PCR parameters, was adapted from a previously described paper by
Plikaytis et al. [24].

A primer set was used to check for the presence or absence
of RD105, RD181, RD150, RD142, and RD207. The PCR
mixture consisted of 0.2 μg DNA template, 13.9 μl Q
buffer, 5 μl 5× buffer, 4 μl 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1 μl of each primer (10 pmol/μl), 1μl DMSO,
and 0.6 μl Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (STRATAGENE, USA). Sterile water was used to dilute the mixture
up to 25 μl. A detailed explanation of this methodology
has been described [25-27].
Drug resistance testing
The proportional method for drug susceptibility testing
(DST) of MTB was performed as described previously
[28]. Briefly, for each drug a 1:10 dilution of standardized
suspensions was inoculated onto the control and drugcontaining media. The extent of growth in the absence or
presence of the drug was compared and expressed as a percentage. If growth at the critical concentration of a drug
was >1%, the isolate was considered to be clinically resistant. 7H10 agar with 0.2 or 1 mg/l isoniazid (INH), 1 or 5
mg/l rifampicin, 5 or 10 mg/l ethambutol, and 5 or 10
mg/l streptomycin was used.
Statistical analyses
Frequencies of multiple-drug resistance (MDR) among
different genotype families based on spoligotyping were
compared with a chi-square test, or a Fisher's exact test
when any of the cells had expected counts ≤ 5. The extent
of association was expressed as an odds ratio (OR) and
95% confidence interval (95% C.I.). All statistical tests

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/170

were two-sided; and statistical significance was set at a pvalue <0.05.
Patients in this study can be classified into two groups,
characterized by clustered and non-clustered MTB isolates. A possible cluster is defined as two or more patients'
strains with identical genetic patterns defined by the
MIRU-VNTR typing; patients' strains with unmatched
genetic profiles were considered non-clustered. Previous
literatures have suggested that clusters may be assumed to
have arisen from recent transmission; and the clustering
rate was used to determine the amount of recent transmission in this population [29,30]. The patients' strains with
the same genetic pattern may represent an epidemiologically linked cluster. Therefore, the minimum estimate of
the proportion of M. tuberculosis cases related to recent
transmission can be calculated as (number of clustered
patients minus the number of clusters)/total number of
patients (Additional file 1).

Results
Analysis of the spoligotyping patterns
During the study period, 356 patients were diagnosed
with culture-confirmed TB. Molecular analysis showed
that all TB cases were caused by M. tuberculosis, except one
by Mycobacterium bovis. The median age of these patient
was 61.2 years, and 70%(251/356) were male. Spoligotyping and drug susceptibility testing (DST) were performed on all of the specimens. Of the 356 isolates
analyzed, spoligotypes from 290 isolates (81.4%) were
classified according to SpolDB4 into one of the 47 shared
international types (SITs) (Figure 1). Of the remaining 66
isolates, 40 patterns were not identified in the database,
22 were of the East African-India (EAI), 4 were of the Beijing, and the other 40 (11.2%) were orphans (Figure 2).
Of the 47 defined spoligotypes, the most frequent strain
found was the Beijing spoligotype ST1 (49.43%), followed by ST50 (5.9%) of the Haarlem strains, and ST19
(3.65%) of the EAI_2 Manilla strains (Figure 1). The Beijing family was the most prevalent genotype, identified in
187/356 (52.5%) isolates, followed by the Haarlem family, identified in 48/356 (13.5%) isolates (Table 1). In
these novel spoligotypes, 22 strains were found to be
TBD1 positive and are further characterized by the
absence of DR spacers 29 to 32 and 34 and the presence
of spacer 33. Based on this result, these new spoligotypes
belong to the East African-India (EAI) family. There are
two novel spoligotypes with the RD 105 deletion, indicating their membership in the Beijing family (Figure 2). Of
all the isolates studied, the most prevalent subfamilies
after the Beijing family (52.5%) were H3 (13.2%) and
EAI-like (6.2%) (Figure 3). Among all of the isolates, 63
(18%) displayed unique spoligotypes, and 293 (82%) displayed one of 24 spoligotypes.

with Beijing strains as compared to 50% of those older
than 75 with Beijing strains, giving an odds ratio of 2.18
with 95% C.I. = 1.11–4.28 and p = 0.02 (Table 2). The
association between young age and Beijing strains was
even stronger in younger ages: 85.3% of people 25 yearold or less had Beijing strain, and when compared with
those more than 75 year-old produced an odds ratio of
5.8 with p = 0.0002 (Table 2). These results indicated that
young population in Taipei were more likely to be
infected with Beijing strains than with other strains and as
compared to older age groups, and thus suggested a possible recent spread of the Beijing genotype in the young
generation in this area.

Typing of strains and clustering analysis by MIRU-VNTR
All 356 isolates were also categorized using the MIRUVNTR typing method, which detected 140 different patterns, comprising 36 clusters formed by 252 isolates and
104 unique patterns formed by 104 isolates (Table 3). The
largest cluster comprised 95 from the Beijing family, with
an MIRU-VNTR profile of 223325173533. Of 187 Beijing
strains as defined by spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR typing
further divided them into 47 different patterns, comprising 15 clusters formed by 155 isolates and 32 unique patterns formed by 32 isolates. Of 48 Harrlem strains, 24
different MIRU-VNTR patterns were found, which consisted of 5 clusters and 19 unique MIRU-VNTR genotypes.
The largest cluster comprised 10 in the Haarlem family,

lates in general population were modern strains (96%,
174/181).

A test population of 356 MTB isolates classified by spoligotyping analysis into six MTB lineages was typed using
15-locus (including ETR-A, B, C) MIRU-VNTR profiling.
The combination of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing for the 356 isolates revealed that 120 (33%) have
unique genotypes and 236 (67%) can be grouped into
one of 43 genotypes. The minimum estimate for the proportion of TB in the study population due to recent transmission is estimated around 54% ([236–43]/356) (Table
3).

Drug resistance patterns
Of the 356 strains in this study, 281 isolates (79%) were
sensitive to all four of the first-line agents tested, and 75
were resistant to at least one drug, 2.8% are multidrug
resistant (MDR) (Table 1). Analysis of the association
between MDR and genotypes (as determined by spoligotyping) showed that the Beijing genotype is more likely to
be MDR than all other genotypes (Haarlem, T, EAI, others,
and orphan combined) [p = 0.08, OR = 3.73, and 95%
C.I. = (0.78–17.83)]. The EAI family is significantly more
likely to be sensitive to all drugs than are other genotypes
[p = 0.02, OR = 3.64, and 95% C.I. = (1.09–12.15)]. Interestingly among the orphan strains, 5% were MDR and
20% were resistant to one drug, showing a distribution
similar to that of the Beijing family.

NTF locus and RD deletion analysis
The RD105 (regions of difference) LSP appears in all Beijing strains examined to date and can be used to define the
set of strains belonging to this lineage. Further subdivisions of the M. tuberculosis Beijing lineage are made on the
basis of the variable appearance of the RD207, RD181,
RD150, and RD142 deletions. In the present study, we
refer to group 1 Beijing strains as those that contain only
the RD105 deletion, while group 2 to 7 Beijing strains also
contain RD105 and RD207 deletion (group 2); RD105,
RD207, RD142, and RD150 deletion (group 3); RD105,
RD207, and RD181 deletion (group 4); RD105, RD207,
RD181, and RD150 deletion (group 5); RD105, RD207,
RD181, and RD142 deletion (group 6); and RD105,
RD207, RD181, RD150, and RD142 deletion (group 7).
Strains in groups 1–3 have neither deletion of RD181 nor
insertion of IS6110 in NTF region, and can be thought of
as being "ancient" to the "modern" Beijing lineage (Figure
4). Results of RD analyses suggest that most of Beijing iso-

Discussion
Tuberculosis remains a major public health issue in Taiwan and throughout the world. Recent advances in molecular technology such as spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR
typing provide a powerful tool to analyze MTB genotype
and transmission patterns, which should be valuable for
development of effective infection-control policy.
Among the 356 samples we analyzed in our study, 65%
isolates would be considered to be potentially clustered
based on 15 loci MIRU-VNTR typing [29]. Such rate is
higher than that reported for other major cities such as
San Francisco or New York, but similar to that from the
Netherlands and Denmark, where the average of recent

transmission rate ranged between 35% and 45% [30-33].
In densely populated areas, such as Northern Malawi,
South African, clustering could be even higher, approaching 70% in some reports [34-36]. However, the rate of
clustering in this study may have been overestimated due
to the insufficient number of MIRU-VNTR loci we used,
especially in an ares with high prevalence of Beijing
strains[37]. Typing by additional loci, such as the 24 loci
MIRU, is required to better differentiate the genetic relationship, clustering and possible transmission chain of all
Beijing strains. Since typing methods of 24 loci MIRU
were published in 2006, we attempted to set up the exper-

iment protocol in our laboratory for the other 8 loci on
top of the 16 loci we had used (the 15 shown in this paper
plus the "MPTR-A"). Typing for 6 of the 8 loci was successfully established and performed on 52 Beijing strains that
were from 15 clusters based on the 15 loci MIRU typing in
this study. Our preliminary data using the additional 6
loci revealed that the same clustering patterns as that by
the 16 loci were observed in 50% of the 52 Beijing strains
analyzed. Therefore, the addition of the new VNTR loci to
MIRU analysis is required to clarify the clustering and
transmission issue in Taipei city in the future.

The modern MTB strains such as the Beijing, Haarlem,
EAI, and T clusters comprise the causal agents of major
epidemics. This study revealed the Beijing strain as the
dominant pathogen for up to 52.5% of cases in Taipei,
similar to the level in a recent report for Taiwan as a whole
[38]. The majority of MTB strains of the Beijing family
originated from the area in and around Beijing, China,
and strains of this family were found to be dominant in
neighboring countries such as Indonesia (44%), South
Korea (72%), Thailand (44%), and Vietnam (53%)
[3,5,8]. In contrast to the predominance of the Beijing
genotype in many Asian countries, a low frequency (3%)
of this genotype was reported among the strains in India
[39]. Strains of the Beijing family have also been found in
Europe, Africa, and the United States. The W strain, which
caused a large outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB in New
York and other U.S. cities, also belongs to the Beijing family [40]. In countries neighboring Taiwan, rates of infection with the Beijing family strains are higher than those
in more distant countries, suggesting that the Beijing family may have radiated from the Beijing area to other
regions. Based on the epidemiologic data, the Beijing
strains appear to have a growth advantage over other
strains, enabling them to circulate better in the population [3,5,8]. Moreover, we also demonstrated that Beijing
family strains were associated with MDR phenotypes in
this study (p = 0.08), a finding similar to that in the recent
report from Taiwan [38]. Association between Beijing
strains and MDR varies worldwide. Although such an
association was reported in studies in the United States,
Estonia, and Vietnam [41], it has not been noted in countries such as China and Indonesia, where representation
of Beijing strains in the population is higher [42].
A total of 187 strains in the Beijing cluster identified by
spoligotyping were further discriminated by MIRU-VNTR
analysis. A total of 155 of the 187 strains were clustered
into 15 groups, each consisting of 2 to 95 strains; and
remaining 32 strains were found to have unique patterns.
This study further showed that MTB isolates grouped into
the Beijing family by spoligotyping have a similar grouping pattern when other genetic markers such as MIRUVNTR typing are used. This was borne out by the fact that
all MIRU-VNTR patterns of Beijing family strains were
highly similar, differing only in copy numbers for one to
three loci. In this study, all isolates that contain ≥ 2 repeats
in the MIRU-VNTR locus 24 belong to the ancestral
(TbD1+) group; and all but 1 isolate containing two
repeat units in locus 24 belong to the modern (TbD1-)
groups. In contrast, we found that ST480 of the U lineage
has the MIRU-VNTR profile 254326223432 and TBD1+.
The genetic characteristics of ST480 are very similar to
those of the EAI family. Frequencies of TbD1+/EAI isolates have recently been reported to range from 25% to
50% in Bangladesh [43,44] and Singapore [45]. A fre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/170

quency of 8% has been reported in a study that used spoligotyping alone for genetic characterization of 105
isolates from the Delhi area [46]. Our analysis found that
5.5% of the samples were TbD1+/EAI isolates, while
another 5.5% were TbD1+/new EAI spoligotype. The
Haarlem isolates accounted for 13.5% in this study. Preliminary studies on the MTB strain distribution in eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, where Taiwanese Aborigines
comprise a relatively large percentage of the population,
showed a predominance of the Haarlem strain of up to
45% [47]. Since Taiwan was colonized by the Dutch in the
17th century, it is conceivable that the Haarlem strain is
dominant in Taiwanese Aborigines. In addition to the Beijing and Haarlem strains, we identified the EAI family, the
T family, the Latin American-Mediterranean family
(LAM), the U family, and the MANU family of MTB in our
population in Taipei. In addition to the identified predominant groups, we were able to identify the occurrence
of rare clusters or localized STs listed in SpolDB4.0 that
had previously been found in America, Australia, and
Europe, with more found in countries neighboring Taiwan, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
China.
TB occurs partly as a primary disease (typically defined as
occurring within 5 years of infection) and partly as an
endogenous reactivation or exogenous reinfection (occurring >5 years after infection) [48]. With increasing age, a
decreasing proportion of cases are due to primary TB.
Thus, the association of the Beijing genotype and young
age suggests a recent spread of the Beijing genotype in Taipei. Anh et al. [49] reported that M. tuberculosis isolates of
the Beijing genotype was less associated with BCG vaccination but was frequently associated with younger age in
Vietnam. Lopez et al [50] used the mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis to investigate the protective efficacy
of BCG against these different strains and found that BCG
was least protective against the Beijing strain. In contrast,
Chan et al. did not find in Hong Kong any association
between the Beijing genotype and younger age but did
find a weak association with isoniazid (INH) resistance
[51]. Although Taiwan executes comprehensively the BCG
vaccination for more 40 years, the predominance of Beijing family strain in young population (85%, below 25
years of age) in this study suggest that BCG may fail to
protect adequately the young people infected with the Beijing strain MTB.
The Beijing family can be further grouped into ancestral,
modern, and recent strains by NTF locus analysis [8] and
RD deletion analysis [4,52], suggesting the strains' temporal evolution or transmission in migratory populations
[16]. According to our previous study, the distribution of
the Beijing sub-lineage with intact NTF region (ancient)
was 19% in the general population, 24% in the veterans,

and 50% in Aborigines in Taiwan [47]. We speculate the
group 3 needed for 500 years from the evolution by group
1, group 4 to group 7 only need for 50 years, obviously
modern strain genome was unstable and perhaps this
instability was conducive to its fast spread. According to
the view of evolution, existence of RD181 region or not,
boundary to become modern and ancient lineage, infer
RD181 perhaps (contain Rv2262c, Rv2263) the gene
included may relate to the maintenance of genome stability. The hypothetical protein RV2262c may involve in protein modification and repair, and the hypothetical protein
RV2263 involve in oxidoreduction http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgibin/CMR/shared/GenePage.cgi?locus=NTL02MT02256.
The genome instability may be caused by these gene deletions.

Conclusion
This study gives a first overview of the M. tuberculosis
strains circulating in metropolitan Taipei. Based on a
combination of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR, our preliminary data showed that the Beijing strain has a high
number of clusters in our sample population and this
conclusion should be further clarified in the future using
the 24 loci MIRU analysis. The high prevalence of Beijing
genotype in young age population warrants a close attention to the control policy and the vaccine strategy. These
findings indicate that TB is not optimally controlled in
Taipei, and that efforts for control strategies should be
enforced. Strain analysis, together with virulence studies,
will also helping pinpointing isolates associated with
higher morbidity and mortality, with the aim of directing
efforts to limit the spread of those strains within the
region.
