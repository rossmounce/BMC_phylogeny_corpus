Abstract
Background: Clonorchis sinensis is a carcinogenic human liver fluke that is widespread in Asian countries.
Increasing infection rates of this neglected tropical disease are leading to negative economic and public health
consequences in affected regions. Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown a strong association
between the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma and the infection rate of C. sinensis. To aid research into this
organism, we have sequenced its genome.
Results: We combined de novo sequencing with computational techniques to provide new information about the
biology of this liver fluke. The assembled genome has a total size of 516 Mb with a scaffold N50 length of 42 kb.
Approximately 16,000 reliable protein-coding gene models were predicted. Genes for the complete pathways for
glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and fatty acid metabolism were found, but key genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis
are missing from the genome, reflecting the parasitic lifestyle of a liver fluke that receives lipids from the bile of its
host. We also identified pathogenic molecules that may contribute to liver fluke-induced hepatobiliary diseases.
Large proteins such as multifunctional secreted proteases and tegumental proteins were identified as potential
targets for the development of drugs and vaccines.
Conclusions: This study provides valuable genomic information about the human liver fluke C. sinensis and adds
to our knowledge on the biology of the parasite. The draft genome will serve as a platform to develop new
strategies for parasite control.

Background
Clonorchis sinensis, the oriental liver fluke, is an important food-borne parasite that causes human clonorchiasis in most Asian countries, including China, Japan,
Korea, and Vietnam [1-3]. Increasing epidemiological
evidence demonstrates the great socio-economic impact
of this neglected tropical parasite, which afflicts more
than 35 million people in Southeast Asia and approximately 15 million in China alone [1,4]. The origin of
most clonorchiasis cases is the consumption of raw
freshwater fish containing C. sinensis metacercariae,
which excyst in the duodenum and then migrate from
the common bile ducts to the peripheral intrahepatic
bile ducts of their host [5]. Although clinical

manifestations are often asymptomatic, repeated and
chronic infections of C. sinensis can result in serious
hepatobiliary diseases, including cholangitis, obstructive
jaundice, hepatomegaly, fibrosis of the periportal system,
cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis [6]. Most importantly,
both experimental and epidemiological evidence strongly
implies that liver fluke infection is one of the most significant causative agents of bile duct cancer-cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)-which is a frequently fatal tumor
[7-10].
The life cycle of C. sinensis is complex and similar to
that of Opisthorchis viverrini, involving asexual reproduction in an aquatic snail (myracidium, sporocyst,
redia, and cercaria stages) and sexual reproduction in
piscivorous mammals (adult worm stage). Mammalian
hosts include humans, dogs, and cats [1,6]. C. sinensis
adult worms establish themselves as parasites in the
intrahepatic bile ducts and extrahepatic ducts of the

liver, and they can even invade the mammalian gall
bladder [3]. Long-term parasitism by liver flukes results
in chronic stimulation of the epithelial cells of the bile
ducts due to fluke excretory-secretory (ES) products, a
variety of molecules released from parasites into the
host bile environment [11]. Proteomic studies have identified the components of C. sinensis ES products that are
thought to act as stimuli for host bile duct epithelium
[12,13]. In vitro biochemical studies have indicated that
ES products from liver flukes have important roles in
feeding behavior, detoxification of bile components, and
immune evasion [11]. For instance, granulin-like growth
factor secreted by the carcinogenic liver fluke O. viverrini was shown to induce host cell proliferation, and the
proliferative activity could be blocked by antibodies
against granulin. These data indicate that secreted proteins, along with many other molecules, are released by
parasites to induce local cell growth [14]. Transcriptome
data sets for C. sinensis, which include substantial representation of ES products, also enable a better understanding of the mechanism of infection of this
carcinogenic parasite [3].
Epidemiological studies in regions affected by liver
flukes have shown a strong association between the incidence of CCA and the infection rate of parasites [6].
Despite the considerable impact of liver fluke-associated
hepatobiliary diseases on public health, there are currently no effective strategies to combat CCA. This study
provides genomic information for the carcinogenic
human liver fluke C. sinensis based on de novo sequencing, and the draft genome described will serve as a
valuable platform to develop new interventions for the
prevention and control of liver flukes.

Results and discussion
De novo sequencing and genome assembly

To avoid assembly difficulties because of high heterozygosity, we extracted genomic DNA from a single adult
fluke and constructed two paired-end sequencing
libraries with insert sizes of approximately 350 bp and
500 bp. Two lanes of Illumina paired-end sequencing
were performed for each library (Table S1 in Additional
file 1); in total, we generated 94.3 million pairs of reads
with an average read length of 115 bp. We screened out
contaminants in the raw data, including 0.25% of raw
reads mapping to the human genome (Homo sapiens)
and 0.06% from Escherichia coli. No reads were detected
from the cat genome (Felis catus). We made use of the
Celera Assembler, which has been updated to enable the
use of Illumina short reads of at least 75 bp in length.
The Celera Assembler has been used in many genome
assemblies, including the first whole genome shotgun
sequence of a multi-cellular organism [15] and the first
diploid sequence of an individual human [16]. By

discarding the low quality ends, we trimmed the raw
reads to 103 bp. We assembled the trimmed reads into
60,796 contigs with an N50 length of 14,708 bp, and we
generated 31,822 scaffolds with an N50 length of 30,116
bp. We also sequenced the transcriptome of an adult
fluke by Illumina sequencing with approximately 32 million paired-end reads with a read length of 75 bp. We
then used RNAPATH [17] to construct 26,466 superscaffolds with an N50 length of 42,632 bp (Table 1).
The total length of the assembled genome is 516 Mb,
approximately 20% smaller than the genome size estimated by k-mer depth distribution of sequencing reads
(644 Mb; Figure S1 in Additional file 1; described in the
Materials and methods section). The assembled genome
does not contain any fragments of the mitochondrial
genome [18], which may be due to the algorithm of the
assembly software as this cannot successfully assemble
extraordinarily high coverage regions, such as mitochondrial genomes. Among the reads left unmapped to the
assembled genome, 0.4% could be aligned to the previously published mitochondrial genome with approximately 5,000× coverage using Bowtie [19].
The average GC content of the C. sinensis genome is
43.85%. Using non-overlapping sliding windows along
the genome, we found a random distribution of sequencing depth over areas with different GC content (within
a range of 30 to 60%) covering more than 99.9% of the
genome sequence (Figure S2a in Additional file 1).
Regions with lower (< 0.2) or higher (> 0.6) GC content
were not found. The GC content of C. sinensis is higher
than that of four other genomes that we examined (Figure S2c in Additional file 1).
To evaluate the single-base accuracy of the assembled
genome, we mapped all of the trimmed reads onto the
super-scaffold using Bowtie [19] (no more than three
mismatches). Approximately 79% of the reads were
uniquely mapped (Table S2 in Additional file 1). For
more than 98% of the assembled genome, there are
more than ten reads mapped for each position, and the
maximum sequencing depth is 30× (Figure S2d in Additional file 1), which can provide a very high single-base
accuracy [20]. To further evaluate the assembly accuracy, 14 pairs of primers were designed to amplify specific genomic fragments. All PCR products were
sequenced on an ABI3730, and the resulting sequence
traces aligned to the genome with over 99.6% identity
(Table S3 in Additional file 1). The assembled genome
contains 88.2% of the 15,121 ESTs produced by the Sanger method that have consensus lengths of 100 bp or
more [21] (Table S4 in Additional file 1).
We called variants with the program glfSingle, which
was designed for genome data from a single individual.
We found 2.3 million variants (Figure S3 in Additional
file 1), with a transition/transversion ratio of 2.07. The

The N50 and N90 sizes of contigs or scaffolds were calculated by ordering all sequences and then adding the lengths from the longest to the shortest until the
summed length exceeded 50% and 90% of the total length of all sequences, respectively. bContigs and scaffolds were constructed by Celera, while contigs were
continuous sequence fragment without gaps (Ns). Super-scaffolds were built with RNA-seq data by RNAPATH based on the scaffolds.

heterozygosity was approximately 0.4% for the whole
genome, about three times that of Schistosoma japonicum [22].
Repeat annotation

Several families of repeat elements covering 0.35% of the
genome were identified by comparing the genome
sequence with the known repetitive sequences in
RepBase database. We further de novo predicted C.
sinensis-specific repeats with the RepeatModeler software [23,24], and found 691 different repeat families/elements, constituting 25.6% (132.2 Mb) of the genome
(Table S5 in Additional file 1). According to our estimate of genome size, approximately 128 Mb (19.9%) has
not been assembled; most of the unassembled sequence
may consist of repetitive sequences. The proportion of
repeats is comparable to S. japonicum (40.1% [22]) and
Schistosoma mansoni (45% [25]). We identified both
non-long terminal repeats (non-LTRs) and LTR transposons, comprising 10.34% and 1.03% of the genome,
respectively. Few short interspersed repetitive elements
(SINEs) were found.
Gene model annotation

Gene prediction methods (cDNA-EST, homology based,
and ab initio methods) were used to identify proteincoding genes, and a reference gene set was built by merging all of the results. In total, we predicted 31,526 gene
models (Table S6 in Additional file 1). To improve the
accuracy of prediction, we considered gene models satisfying at least one of the following requirements as reliable: 1) gene function was annotatable; 2) genes were
homologous to S. japonicum and S. mansoni genes; 3)
genes were supported by putative full-length ORFs of C.
sinensis (Table S7 in Additional file 1). In total, 16,258
gene models were retained as a reliable gene set and
used for further analysis. Detailed analysis of gene
length, exon number per gene and gene density in C.
sinensis showed similar patterns to S. japonicum and S.
mansoni (Table 2). Approximately 83.9% of the genes
have homologues in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database, and
57.8% can be classified with Gene Ontology terms [26].
Overall, 92% of the putative genes can be annotated
(Table S7 in Additional file 1).

To assess the completeness of our gene models, we
investigated the coverage of the CEGMA [27] set of 458
core eukaryotic genes. Most of these core genes (425;
92.8%) were found, of which 392 were aligned over
more than 50% of their sequences, suggesting the completeness of the genome (Table S8 in Additional file 1).
To investigate the amount of variation in gene families
between C. sinensis and other metazoans, we assigned
genes into families by clustering them according to their
sequence similarities (see Materials and methods). We
observed a minor amount of variation in the total number of gene families when looking across C. sinensis
(6,910), S. japonicum (8,898), S. mansoni (7,313) and
well characterized species like Caenorhabditis elegans
(10,180), Drosophila melanogaster (7,640) and Homo
sapiens (8,841) (Table S9 in Additional file 1).
Protein domains were identified by InterProScan (see
Materials and methods). In total, 8,372 domains were
found in the eight species (C. sinensis, S. japonicum, S.
mansoni, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, Danio rerio, Gallus
gallus and H. sapiens). Of the 16,258 gene models for C.
sinensis, 6,847 contained a total of 3,675 protein domains
(Table S10 in Additional file 1). Approximately 60%
(2,203 of 3,675) of protein domains in C. sinensis were
shared with other taxa (Figure 1), and these domains
could be considered ubiquitous among metazoans.
Among the 4,697 domains not detected in C. sinensis,
71% (3,345 of 4,697) were also not identified in Schistosoma. Only 29 domains present in C. sinensis and the
other species mentioned were not in schistosomes. Thus,
we speculated that domain loss events in C. sinensis
might have occurred to an even greater extent than in
Schistosoma (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). It is also possible that lack of completion of the draft genome could
lead to an artifact of domain loss in C. sinensis. This conclusion needs further validation in our future work.
In addition to protein-coding genes, we also identified
7 rRNA fragments and 235 tRNAs, 509 small nucleolar
RNAs, 169 small nuclear RNAs, and 858 microRNA
(miRNA) precursor genes in the C. sinensis genome
(Table S11 in Additional file 1). To further annotate C.
sinensis miRNA precursors, we mapped miRNA expression data [28,29] to our miRNA precursors and found
159 miRNA precursors had evidence of expression
(Additional file 2).

Phylogeny of C. sinensis

We used the C. sinensis sequences and eight other
sequenced genomes to construct a whole genome-based
species phylogeny. The eight additional species used to
construct the phylogeny were H. sapiens, G. gallus, D.
rerio, D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, C. elegans, S.
mansoni, and S. japonicum. The resulting phylogeny,
based on 44 genes with single copy orthologues in all
species, placed C. sinensis together with S. mansoni and
S. japonicum (Figure 2). The topology structure of the
tree is consistent with previous knowledge. C. sinensis
and S. mansoni (or S. japonicum) were found to be evolving under a roughly constant evolutionary rate according to Tajima’s relative rate test (P < 0.1).
Synteny between C. sinensis and S. japonicum and S.
mansoni

To investigate the long-range synteny between C. sinensis and the schistosome genomes, we selected all 79
scaffolds larger than 200 kb to perform alignments with
the S. japonicum and S. mansoni genomes. Given that
the average gene length of C. sinensis is about 10 kb, we
chose those blocks with size larger than 10 kb as putative syntenic blocks. The largest syntenic block between
C. sinensis and S. japonicum is 66 kb and the maximum
gene number in one syntenic block is three. The largest
syntenic block between C. sinensis and S. mansoni is 99
kb and the maximum gene number in one syntenic
block is four (Additional file 3). More closely related
species are needed to further understand the genome
synteny of the flukes.
Energy metabolism

To investigate energy metabolism in C. sinensis, we
mapped the gene models to the pathways represented in
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG). The results demonstrate that both the glycolytic pathway (Figure S5 in additional file 4) and the
Krebs cycle (Figure S6 in Additional file 4) are intact; C.
sinensis can obtain energy from both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Although liver flukes inhabit anaerobic bile ducts, the conserved biochemical pathway of
aerobic metabolism can facilitate the survival of C.

sinensis juveniles in their intermediate hosts. As
expected, genes encoding key enzymes required for glycolysis, such as hexokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and
lactate dehydrogenase, were present at high copy number. We did notice that some genes for enzymes
involved in energy metabolism were conspicuously
absent; it seems that loss of these metabolic enzymes in
C. sinensis might relate to its parasitic lifestyle. We presumed that C. sinensis adult worms might utilize exogenous glucose through the glycolytic pathway or by
absorbing nutrients from hosts under anaerobic conditions [1]. Like schistosomes, C. sinensis can ingest glucose at rates as great as 26% of its body weight per
hour, with glucose being broken down into lactic acid
through glycolysis [30]. Thus, glycolytic enzymes are
crucial molecules for trematode survival.
Fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis

After mapping gene models to KEGG pathways, we
found fatty acid metabolism completely intact in C.
sinensis, while fatty acid biosynthesis is lacking certain
key enzymes. As indicated in Figure S7 of Additional file
4 all genes encoding enzymes necessary for fatty acid
metabolism were found, but for the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway only three enzymes were detected: 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase II (FabF), acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2, 6.3.4.14) and [acyl-carrier-protein] S-malonyltransferase (FabD) (Figure S8 in Additional file 4). To validate the gene losses in fatty acid
biosynthesis, we searched for orthologous genes of this
pathway in our gene models based on sequence similarity
and domain organization. Only the three genes mentioned above resulted in reciprocal best BLAST hits and
the same domain organizations (Additional file 5). To
exclude the effect of incompleteness of the predicted
gene set, we aligned all orthologous genes (excluding the
three aforementioned genes) to the C. sinensis genome.
Only one orthologue of FASN (encoding fatty acid
synthase; KEGG gene ID tca:658978) got two significant
hits. Detailed analysis of the two hits showed that two
key domains (the beta-ketoacyl synthase N-terminal
domain and the C-terminal domain) of FASN were not
found (Figure 3a), suggesting these hits were not

orthologues of FASN. Similar analysis was also performed
in S. japonicum and S. mansoni, and the same results
were observed (Figure 3b, c; Additional file 5). Since all
three flukes have only the same three enzymes of the
fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, it seems impossible that

this pathway was lost by chance during sequencing and
assembling of the three genomes by different techniques
and laboratories [22,25]. Thus, we can conclude that the
defect of fatty acid biosynthesis may have occured before
the split of the three flukes.

Figure 2 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using concatenated amino acid sequences for 44
single-copy genes present in all nine genomes with maximum likelihood analysis. Numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap values.

We discovered many gene copies encoding fatty acid
binding proteins, which are thought to have a role as
fatty acid transporters in Fasciola hepatica [11]. Bile
contains high levels of fatty acids, which can act as a
nutrient source for parasites. The fatty acid binding proteins found in liver flukes may play an important role in
the uptake of nutrients from host bile, possibly making
it unnecessary for flukes to synthesize their own fatty
acids endogenously. Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1), a
gene involved in regulating biliary cholesterol concentration, was also identified in C. sinensis [31]. The role of
NPC1 in bile acid metabolic processes required for cholesterol absorption further indicates that C. sinensis is
able to absorb lipids from its host for survival.
Proteases, kinases, and phosphatases

To gain access to their preferred location within hosts,
parasites have to escape hosts’ defense mechanisms.
Diverse molecules and biochemical pathways have
evolved to counter those defenses, including important
enzymes like proteases. Particularly in liver flukes, proteases play key roles in invasion, migration and feeding/
nutrition [32,33]. Putative proteases we identified
include metalloproteases, cysteine proteases, serine proteases and aspartic proteases, among others (Table S13
in Additional file 6). Among these, the largest group is
the cysteine protease superfamily; these proteases have
been identified as possible diagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates in S. japonicum [22]. Only those of the
cathepsin F subtype are well characterized and theseare
thought to play a key role in parasite physiology and
related pathobiological processes in C. sinensis [34,35].

Other cysteine protease subtypes, such as cathepsins A,
B, D, and E and even serine proteases, have not been
previously recognized in C. sinensis, though they may
contribute to catabolism of bilirubin and other host proteins. By comparing C. sinensis with O. viverrini, which
has a similar life cycle, we were able to draw the general
conclusion that serine proteases, metalloproteases and
aspartic proteases may be principal players in host invasion and the progression of hepatobiliary disease
[36-38].
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occur in all
known eukaryotes through the antagonistic actions of
protein phosphatases and protein kinases. Protein
kinases play key roles in many eukaryotic processes,
such as gene expression, metabolism, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation [39]. We have identified many important protein kinases in C. sinensis (Table S14 in
Additional file 6), including casein kinase II, serine/
threonine-protein kinase, cell division protein kinase,
adenylate kinase isoenzyme, pyruvate kinase, cyclindependent protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
Casein kinase II is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein
kinase with multiple substrates and roles in diverse cellular processes, including differentiation, gene silencing,
cell proliferation, tumor suppression and translation;
however, its function in trematodes remains unknown
[40]. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is
implicated in numerous processes in mammalian cells
and plays an important role in parasite biology. Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum PKA resulted in

significant anti-parasitic effects [41]. Therefore, PKA
represents a promising target for the treatment of parasite infections. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase is essential for signal transduction in cells and
modulates a variety of physiological processes, such as
learning and memory, metabolism and transcription. For
Plasmodium gallinaceum zygotes, calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase is required for the morphological changes that occur during ookinete differentiation
[42]. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
are highly conserved kinases involved in signal transduction and development [43]. In general, protein kinases
are promising candidates as targets for RNA interference-based treatments to prevent liver fluke infection.
Apart from protein kinases, many phosphatases were
discovered in the draft genome, including glucose-6-

phosphatase 3, magnesium-dependent phosphatase and
protein tyrosine phosphatase (Table S15 in Additional
file 6). Phosphatases are endogenous kinase inhibitors
that reverse the action of kinases, and they can be classified by substrate specificity as either serine/threonine,
tyrosine or dual specificity phosphatases [44]. The physiological roles of serine/threonine protein phosphatases
are numerous and have been studied extensively.
Because of their critical regulatory roles in cellular processes, they have been regarded as promising targets for
drug development in recent years.
Tegument and excretory-secretory products

The outermost surface of a trematode is a syncytium.
For platyhelminth parasites, the tegument is generally
viewed as the most susceptible target for vaccines and

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R107

drugs because it is a dynamic host-interactive layer with
roles in nutrition, immune evasion and modulation,
pathogenesis, excretion and signal transduction [45,46].
We characterized putative tegument proteins, including
cathepsin B, epidermal growth factor receptor, glucose6-phosphatase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a calcium channel and a voltage-dependent channel
subunit (Table S16 in Additional file 6). These proteins
can be classified into several subtypes, such as proteases,
receptors, nutrition and metabolism enzymes, channel
proteins and transfer proteins. Most of these proteins
have not previously been recognized in C. sinensis and
may contribute to catabolism of host proteins and invasion of host tissue. Likely because of their critical roles,
the genes encoding phospholipase D, phosphatidic acid
phosphatase type 2A, glucose-6-phosphatase and calcium ATPase are found in high copy numbers. It is well
known that phospholipase D is an important signaling
molecule that increases nitric oxide synthesis and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression [47]. Phosphatase
type 2A plays a pivotal role in the control of signal
transduction by lipid mediators such as phosphatidate,
lysophosphatidate, and ceramide-1-phosphate [48]. Our
previous studies have revealed that some lipid metabolism enzymes, such as lysophospholipase [49] and phospholipase A2 [50], potentially contributed to liver
fibrosis caused by C. sinensis infection. The roles of
tegumental phospholipase D and phosphatase type 2A
in C. sinensis pathogenesis warrant further study.
In the C. sinensis genome, we have identified some
important ES products, including cortactin, aldolase,
enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, transketolase, programmed cell death 6 interacting protein, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Table S17 in Additional
file 6). The ES products of parasites have attracted
attention because of their potential uses in the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and drug therapies.
Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of
ES products in many parasites, such as O. viverrini, C.
sinensis, S. japonicum, S. mansoni, and Paragonimus
westermani [45-48,51]. ES products comprise various
proteins, the most predominant of which are proteases
and detoxifying enzymes, which may serve vital roles
in protecting parasites from host immune defenses
[50]. One of the ES products, enolase, is a cytosolic
glycolytic enzyme that has been reported to localize on
the cell surface and the tegument in helminths. The
secretory enolase of S. japonicum may promote fibrinolytic activity to enable parasitic invasion and migration within the host. This enzyme could be used for
vaccines and drug development applications [47]. Similarly, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is a conserved
enzyme that was classified as a metabolic enzyme that
modulates interactions between hosts and parasites

Page 8 of 14

[47]. This enzyme might have important roles in C.
sinensis.
Host-binding proteins and receptors

The highly co-evolved relationship between C. sinensis
and its hosts depends on adaptations in the host-binding
proteins and related receptors [52]. A number of such
molecules were characterized in our research (Table S18
in Additional file 6), such as fibronectin, calmodulin,
plasminogen, epidermal growth factor receptor and
fibroblast growth factor receptor. Fibronectin, a multifunctional protein, is well conserved across species and
has multiple domains for interaction with extracellular
matrix components, such as heparin and collagen [53].
It was reported that fibronectin plays a role in activating
phosphokinase A in the context of host invasion. Calmodulin has roles in the detoxification system, which
has evolved sensors and responders that use Ca2+ as a
messenger. Plasminogen plays important roles in processes such as fibrinolysis and the degradation of extracellular matrices, and it can enhance proteolytic activity
and increase tissue damage when coupled with its receptor. One of the most well characterized plasminogen
receptors in mammals is enolase, the glycolytic enzyme
described above [54]. Unexpectedly, a granulin-like
growth factor was also observed (Table S18 in Additional file 6). This growth factor is a homologue of
human granulin, a secreted growth factor associated
with liver fluke-induced cancers [14]. Further studies
should focus on the identification of host receptors to
provide therapeutic strategies for cancers. C. sinensis
can live for years, sometimes decades, within the bile
ducts of mammalian hosts as it develops, matures and
reproduces, so it is expected that co-evolution of parasite and host proteins has occurred in the process of
regulating host-parasite interactions.
Sex determination and reproduction

C. sinensis is a hermaphrodite, but the key genes
responsible for sex determination are still unknown. We
identified 53 genes related to sex determination, sex differentiation and sexual reproduction (Table S19 in
Additional file 6). We also identified 25 genes in particular by their annotation with the Gene Ontology term
‘hermaphrodite genitalia development’. That Gene
Ontology annotation comes from C. elegans, a nematode
that displays hermaphroditism [55]. In addition, six
genes were predicted to be related to sexual
reproduction.
In C. sinensis, we also found the genes SOX6 (SRY
(sex determining region Y)-box 6) and DMRT1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1), which are
known sex determination genes in vertebrates. In mammals, SRY is thought to be a testis determination factor

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R107

and a critical developmental regulator [56]. The fact that
SRY and SOX6 co-localize with splicing factors in the
nucleus indicates that SOX6 may play a role in splicing
of the testis-determining factor in C. sinensis development [56]. Doublesex and mab-3 contain a zinc fingerlike DNA-binding motif (DM domain) that performs
several related regulatory functions. DMRT1 regulates a
DM-domain-containing protein that has a conserved
role in vertebrate sexual development [57]. To date,
most investigations of hermaphrodite development have
focused on the nematodes, and our novel findings now
provide valuable clues for biological research on the hermaphrodite phenomenon.
Liver flukes and cholangiocarcinoma

Of particular interest in this study was the identification
of proteins that could contribute to carcinogenesis.
Apart from the previously described granulin and thioredoxin peroxidase, fatty acid binding protein and phospholipase A2 are members of the CCA-related gene
group (Table S20 in Additional file 6). Granulin in O.
viverrini is defined as a proliferative growth factor and
has been shown to be mitogenic at very low concentrations [14]. The genomic results provide strong evidence
that granulin is also encoded in C. sinensis, and further
work will determine its significance in the process of
carcinogenesis. Thioredoxin peroxidase is characterized
as an antioxidant enzyme ubiquitously expressed in the
tissues of the liver fluke and in epithelial cells within the
host bile duct [58]. Results suggest that thioredoxin peroxidase may play a significant role in protecting the
parasite against damage and inducing inflammation in
hosts. Our experiments have revealed the potential contribution of phospholipase A2 to hepatic fibrosis caused
by C. sinensis infection. As an ES product, phospholipase A2 could bind to the receptor on the membrane of
LX-2 cells [50]. Fatty acid binding protein is thought to
have functions in lipid transport in parasites [59], but
whether fatty acid binding protein is involved in carcinogenesis requires further clarification.
It has been acknowledged that liver fluke-induced
CCA is a multifactorial pathological process resulting
from infection-induced inflammation and the release of
carcinogenic substances by parasites [14]. Both proteomic and transcriptomic approaches to the study of
secreted and tegumental proteins have enhanced our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which
liver flukes establish a chronic infection, evade the host
immune system and ultimately contribute to the onset
of cancer [60]. However, the intrinsic molecular
mechanisms involved in these processes remain obscure.
Long-term hepatobiliary damage may result from multiple factors, including mechanical irritation of the epithelial cells, DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous

Page 9 of 14

carcinogens, and immunopathological processes directed
by ES products and tegumental proteins. Moreover,
increased concentrations of N-nitroso compounds in
humans infected with liver flukes may contribute to the
risk of developing CCA through the alkylation or deamination of DNA [54]. The results from our genomic
study will help to elucidate previous hypotheses and aid
us to explore more potentially important molecules
associated with liver fluke-induced CCA.

Conclusions
This study provides the fundamental biological characterization of the carcinogenic human liver fluke C.
sinensis, which has large socio-economic and public
health effects in Asian countries [1,2]. Recently, the
advent of next-generation sequencing technology provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to obtain
whole-genome sequence information for this neglected
parasite. We report here the draft genome of C. sinensis
based on DNA isolated from a single individual parasite.
Briefly, our work contributes needed knowledge to
decode the mechanisms underlying energy metabolism,
developmental biology and pathogenesis in C. sinensis.
Large pathogenic molecules involved in liver flukeinduced hepatobiliary disease have been discovered [6].
Numerous multifunctional secreted proteases and tegumental proteins have been highlighted for further study
as vaccine and drug targets. In conclusion, the results
presented here characterize the genomic features of C.
sinensis and reveal the evolutionary interplay between
parasite and host. We believe that the discoveries made
in the C. sinensis genome project will be quite valuable
for the prevention and control of this liver fluke.
Materials and methods
DNA library construction and sequencing

Adult C. sinensis flukes were isolated from cat livers
(Henan Province, China) and rinsed several times with
phosphate-buffered saline. A single adult was chosen for
genomic DNA extraction using phenol.
Two short-insert (350 bp and 500 bp) DNA libraries
were constructed according to the Paired-End Sample
Preparation Guide (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Briefly, we nebulized 2.5 μg of DNA with compressed
nitrogen gas, then polished the DNA ends and added an
‘A’ base to the ends of the DNA fragments. Next, the
DNA adaptors (Illumina) were ligated to the above products, and the ligated products were purified on a 2%
agarose gel. We excised and purified gel slices for each
insert size (Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit; QIAGEN Co.,
Ltd, Shanghai, China). Two DNA libraries were amplified using the adaptor primers (Illumina) for 12 cycles,
and fragments of approximately 450 bp and 600 bp
(inserted DNA plus adaptors) isolated from agarose gels.

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R107

We performed cluster generation on the cBot (Illumina), following the cBot User Guide. Then, we performed a paired-end sequencing run on the Genome
Analyzer IIx (Illumina) according to the user guide. A
total of 188.6 million raw reads (115 bp each) were
obtained. FastQScreen [61] was used to screen out Illumina adaptors and other contaminating sequences. After
masking adaptor sequences and removing contaminated
reads, clean reads were processed for computational
analysis.
RNA library construction and sequencing

Adult C. sinensis flukes were isolated from cat livers
(Guangdong Province, China) and rinsed several times
with phosphate-buffered saline. Twenty flukes were
pooled and total RNAs were extracted using the standard TRIZOL RNA isolation protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
For high-throughput sequencing, the sequencing
library was constructed by following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina). Fragments of 300 bp were
excised and enriched by PCR for 18 cycles. Then, we
performed a paired-end sequencing run on the Genome
Analyzer IIx (Illumina) according to the user guide.
After masking adaptor sequences and removing contaminated reads, a total of 31,965,154 clean paired-end
reads (2 × 75 bp) were processed for scaffolding.

reads must be at least 99; and (iii) the posterior probability threshold is 0.999.
Repeat annotation

Known repetitive elements were identified using RepeatMasker [69,70] with the Repbase database [71,72] (version: 2009-06). A de novo repeat library was also
constructed by using RepeatModeler, which contains
two de novo repeat finding programs (RECON [23] and
RepeatScout [24]). We used default parameters and generated consensus sequences and classification information for each repeat family. Then, we ran RepeatMasker
on the genome again using the repeat library built with
RepeatModeler.
Gene model annotation
GeneWise

Predicted proteins from S. japonicum and S. mansoni
were aligned to C. sinensis to identify conserved genes.
Because GeneWise [73] is time consuming, schistosome
proteins were first aligned with the C. sinensis genome
using genBlastA [74]. Subsequently, we extracted
matched genomic regions and used GeneWise to identify exon/intron boundaries.
Augustus and Genscan

Augustus [75] was run with the gene model parameters
tuned for Schistosoma. Genscan [76] was run using the
model parameters for human.

Sequence assembly and mapping

C. sinensis ESTs

We used the k-mer method [62,63] to estimate genome
size. We obtained the 17-mer depth distribution with
Soapdenovo [64] and ABySS [65]. The real sequencing
depth (C) was correlated with the peak of the 17-mer
frequency (Ck-mer), read length (L) and k-mer length (K)
in the formula:

cDNA libraries from C. sinensis metacercaria and adults
were constructed using the standard Trizol RNA isolation protocol (Invitrogen), and the two libraries yielded
9,455 and 2,696 EST sequences, respectively. We also
downloaded 2,970 existing EST sequences from the
NCBI dbEST database. In addition, 574,448 EST
sequences [3] were produced using the Roche 454 platform. We mapped all of the EST sequences to the C.
sinensis genome with GMAP [77].

Ck−mer = C × (L − K + 1) /L

Then, the genome size was estimated from total
sequencing length and sequencing depth.
Clean reads were trimmed to 103 bp to minimize problems associated with low quality ends. We used the
Celera Assembler [15] to assemble contigs and scaffolds,
and we constructed super-scaffolds with the RNA-seq
data using RNAPATH [17] (ERANGE module [66]).
We used Bowtie [19] to align trimmed reads to the
assembled genome with no more than three mismatches
and generated a sequence alignment/map (SAM) file.
Reads that matched repetitive sequences were filtered
out. We converted the SAM file to a GLF file using
SAMtools [67] and called variants with glfSingle [68]
with the following parameters: (i) the coverage depth of
a single base must be 10× to 60×; (ii) the root mean
squared (RMS) mapping quality score of overlapping

Integration of resources using EvidenceModeler

Gene predictions generated by Augustus and Genscan,
spliced alignments of S. japonicum and S. mansoni proteins and EST alignments from C. sinensis were integrated with EvidenceModeler [78].
Protein domain analysis

InterProScan [79] was run on all C. sinensis, S. japonicum and S. mansoni predicted protein sequences.
Matches tagged as ‘true positive’ (status ‘T’) by InterProScan were retained. InterPro domain information for
five other species (C. elegans, D. melanogaster, D. rerio,
G. gallus and H. sapiens) was downloaded from Ensembl
BioMart (Ensembl version 60) [80].
Functional annotation

We mapped the C. sinensis reference genes to KEGG
[81] pathways by BLAST (e-value < 1e-5). BLAST

Wang et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R107
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/10/R107

searches against the Swiss-Prot database and NCBI nonredundant database (e-value < 1e-5) were conducted to
provide comprehensive functional annotation.
CEGMA validation

The CEGMA [27] set of 458 core eukaryotic genes was
used to evaluate the completeness of the predicted gene
models using the GenBlastA [74] program with default
parameters.
Gene family construction

Genes were clustered according to sequence similarity.
We selected nine species in which to analyze gene
families. The eight genomes were C. sinensis, S. japonicum, S. mansoni, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, D. rerio, G. gallus and H. sapiens. Additional file 7
shows the sources of sequence data used in the present
study [80,82-84]. For each gene, the longest protein product was used for alignment purposes. The peptide
sequences were first aligned to other sequences from
the same genome using BLAST. Hits with e-value < 1e10 were used for clustering by Markov clustering [85]
(the parameter -I was set to 6).

Page 11 of 14

other eight species (e-value < 1E-10), and the Solar program was used to concatenate fragmentary alignments
for each pair of genes [64]. Genes that aligned with
more than one-third of another gene in the same species were considered multi-copy genes and excluded
from the analysis.
In total, 93 genes with single-copy orthologues in all
species were identified. Individual multiple amino acid
sequence alignments for each gene were created with
CLUSTALW [90]. Those alignments that lacked informative sites or had too many gaps were discarded. The
remaining 44 genes were concatenated into a final alignment. Regions with many mismatches were also discarded
to reduce alignment error. The best protein model was
found by MEGA5 [91] and used in the following analysis.
The phylogeny tree was constructed by maximum likelihood methods using both MEGA5 and PHYML [92],
which independently reached the same topology (only the
results obtained from MEGA5 are presented here). Bootstrap values were based on 1,000 replicates. Tajima’s relative rate test [93] was performed for C. sinensis and S.
mansoni (or S. japonicum), with D. rerio (or any of the
other five species) used as an out-group.

Non-coding RNA annotation

The rRNA fragments were identified by aligning C.
sinensis rRNA sequences from the NCBI Nucleotide
database to the draft genome. The tRNA genes were
found by running tRNAscan-SE [86] with eukaryote
parameters. Other non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, small nuclear RNAs and H/ACA-box small
nucleolar RNAs, were identified by searching the Rfam
database [87] with the software tool Infernal 1.0 [88].
Synteny with S. japonicum and S. mansoni

Seventy-nine scaffolds with length greater than 200 kb
were selected to perform pairwise genome alignment
with S. japonicum and S. mansoni using BLASTZ [89]
with the following parameters: C = 2, T = 0, W = 6, H
= 2000, Y = 3400, L = 6000 and K = 2200. The Chain/
Net package was used for post-processing, including lavToPsl, chainMergeSort, chainPreNet, chainNet, netToAxt and axtToMaf, and so on. All three of the
genomes were masked with RepeatMasker using the ‘-s’
setting.
Phylogeny reconstruction

We selected nine species to construct a phylogenetic
tree: C. sinensis, H. sapiens, G. gallus, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, C. elegans, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. For each species, the longest transcript model
was chosen to represent each gene, and genes shorter
than 30 amino acids were excluded [64]. BlastP was
used to compare all orthologues of the C. sinensis protein sequences against a protein database built from the

Data accessibility

All of the genome shotgun and transcriptome data are
available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive [SRA:
029284 and 035384]. The assembled genome and gene
models are available at [94]. The genome sequences can
also be downloaded from the DNA Data Bank of Japan
[DDBJ: BADR01000001-BADR01060778 (contigs) and
DF126616-DF142827 (scaffolds)]. The genome is available
