Palaeoclimatic events, dispersal and migratory
losses along the Afro-European axis as drivers
of biogeographic distribution in Sylvia warblers
Gary Voelker* and Jessica E Light

Abstract
Background: The Old World warbler genus Sylvia has been used extensively as a model system in a variety of
ecological, genetic, and morphological studies. The genus is comprised of about 25 species, and 70% of these
species have distributions at or near the Mediterranean Sea. This distribution pattern suggests a possible role for
the Messinian Salinity Crisis (from 5.96-5.33 Ma) as a driving force in lineage diversification. Other species
distributions suggest that Late Miocene to Pliocene Afro-tropical forest dynamics have also been important in the
evolution of Sylvia lineages. Using a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis and other methods, we seek to develop a
biogeographic hypothesis for Sylvia and to explicitly assess the roles of these climate-driven events.
Results: We present the first strongly supported molecular phylogeny for Sylvia. With one exception, species fall
into one of three strongly supported clades: one small clade of species distributed mainly in Africa and Europe,
one large clade of species distributed mainly in Africa and Asia, and another large clade with primarily a circumMediterranean distribution. Asia is reconstructed as the ancestral area for Sylvia. Long-distance migration is
reconstructed as the ancestral character state for the genus, and sedentary behavior subsequently evolved seven
times.
Conclusion: Molecular clock calibration suggests that Sylvia arose in the early Miocene and diverged into three
main clades by 12.6 Ma. Divergence estimates indicate that the Messinian Salinity Crisis had a minor impact on
Sylvia. Instead, over-water dispersals, repeated loss of long-distance migration, and palaeo-climatic events in Africa
played primary roles in Sylvia divergence and distribution.

Background
The avian genus Sylvia is an Old World warbler lineage
comprising roughly 25 species, to include species which
were until recently placed in other genera [[1-3]; Parisoma, Pseudalcippe, and Horizhorinus, respectively]. The
genus as a whole is distributed from central Eurasia to
the tip of South Africa, and about 70% of Sylvia species
have ranges that abut, or very nearly abut, the Mediterranean Sea. Individual species’ ranges vary from widespread inter-continental migrants such as the Greater
Whitethroat (Sylvia communis) to highly restricted
island endemics in the Mediterranean Sea and Gulf of
Guinea to include the Balearic Warbler (Sylvia balearica) and Dohrn’s Thrush-babbler [Sylvia dohrni; [3,4]].

Because Sylvia species are highly variable in distribution, range sizes and migratory behavior, they have been
used extensively as a model system in a variety of studies
including morphological evolution, the genetics of migration, the effects of climate change on migration, and the
evolution of range size [e.g., [2,5-10]]. Some of these studies have relied on molecular phylogenies as the basis for
understanding evolutionary patterns in the genus [e.g.,
[2,9]]. The phylogenies used, however, have generally
been based on neighbor-joining algorithms and the
resulting phylogenetic hypotheses have lacked support
for most relationships. The only study to use molecular
tools to investigate the historical biogeography of the
genus relied on DNA-DNA hybridization of 20 Sylvia
species; results were such that only a few broad-brush
biogeographic questions could be addressed [1].

Overall then, a well-resolved phylogeny of Sylvia is
still lacking. Thus, uncertainty remains when attempting
to explain evolutionary patterns within Sylvia, and most
questions relating to the historical biogeography of the
genus remain unaddressed, including when and how
most lineage divergences occurred. For example, the
high percentage of Sylvia species distributed on Mediterranean islands or around the margins of the sea in
Europe and North Africa (Figure 1) suggest that overwater dispersal or vicariance related to sea-level change
might have been important factors in lineage diversification. Indeed, the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, at ~5.3
million years ago (Ma), is defined by environmental
changes associated with the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis [MSC; [11,12]], specifically the re-filling of
the Mediterranean Sea following complete desiccation.
Although lasting for a rather short period of evolutionary time [from 5.96-5.33 Ma; [13]], the desiccation
of the Mediterranean would have allowed land-based
colonization routes for population expansion to islands
(e.g., Sardinia) and between Europe and Africa. Subsequent re-filling of the Mediterranean at the end of the
MSC would have created a vicariant barrier to further
land-based colonization, thus driving lineage diversification between (now isolated) populations. This same
mechanism could explain the trans-Mediterranean distribution of a number of Sylvia species [4]. Alternatively,
lineages could have diverged while the Mediterranean
was filled, before or after the MSC, suggesting that
over-water dispersal might have been important in the
evolution of Sylvia, as has been shown in other avian
lineages [e.g., [14,15]]. Molecular clock dates are key to
being able to discriminate between vicariance and dispersal hypotheses [e.g., [16]]. Similar questions relating
to the possible vicariant impact of the MSC on lineage
divergence, or the Mediterranean as a dispersal barrier
to island or intercontinental colonization have been
addressed for a variety of animal taxa to include butterflies [e.g., [17]], fish [e.g., [18,19]], mammals [e.g.,
[20,21]], and reptiles and amphibians [e.g., [22-24]].
Away from the Mediterranean, distributions of other
Sylvia species suggest that both Asian-African and
Northeastern (e.g., Ethiopia)-Southern African interchanges were important in the evolution of the genus
(Figure 1). There are good palaeo-climatic and palaeoecological records of African habitats extending back to
the late Miocene, and major shifts in climate had a significant impact on Afrotropical forest expansion and
contraction. These forest shifts have been shown to
have been important in the evolution of a variety of vertebrate lineages, serving as vicariance barriers for species
breeding in arid or montane regions, and as dispersal
corridors from Asia for forest adapted species [e.g.,
[16,25-31]].

Our aims in this paper were to develop a well-resolved
molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of Sylvia warblers,
and to use this phylogeny in conjunction with molecular
clock calibrations to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus. Based on Sylvia distributions, we
hypothesize that the Messinian Salinity Crisis will have
played a major role in lineage diversification around the
Mediterranean Sea. Because most African breeding Sylvia species do not breed in tropical forests, we further
hypothesize that expansion and contraction of Afrotropical forests will have played a role in lineage diversification between northern and southern African species. In
assessing these hypotheses, we also assess the possible
role that changes in migratory habit might have played
in the evolution of Sylvia distributions.

Methods
Molecular methods and phylogenetic analysis

We included all species of Sylvia following Sibley and
Monroe [[32]; Table 1]. We also included several species previously recognized as races of other Sylvia taxa,
as well as taxa that have more recently been shown to
be part of the genus [e.g., Parisoma, Pseudalcippe, and
Horizhorinus; [1-3]]. Sylvia leucomelaena is represented by cytochrome b data obtained from GenBank.
As outgroups, we included individuals from closely
related (Chamaea, Paradoxornis) and more distant
genera [Turdoides, Zosterops; [33]]. We did not recognize Sylvia moltonii here, although moltonii has been
suggested as specifically distinct from cantillans
because of its genetic distance relative to other cantillans races [4-5%; [34]]. Comparing a moltonii cytochrome b sequence (GenBank EU760693) to our
samples of cantillans (one S. c. cantillans from Senegal
and one S. c. albistriata from Greece) we find a 4.5%
difference. But more importantly, we find a far higher
divergence between our two samples of cantillans
(3.6%) than that reported in the literature [0.35%;
[34]]. We agree with Brambilla et al. [34] that regardless of taxonomic rank, moltonii is sister to other cantillans races (analysis not shown) and also agree that
many questions in the cantillans complex remain
unsolved. In the current study, the distribution of moltonii is therefore reflected in our scoring for cantillans.
We obtained extracted DNA for a number of species
(those preceded by a “B” in Table 1), which have been
previously used in assessments of Sylvia relationships [e.
g., [2,9]]. For new samples, whole genomic DNA was
extracted from tissue using the DNeasy tissue extraction
kit (Qiagen). For all samples, we used the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the mitochondrial
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and cytochrome-b (cyt-b) genes using published primers and
protocols [35]. Automated sequencing was performed

We used SEQUENCHER, version 4.5 (Gene Codes) to
align ND2 and cyt-b sequences for each sample. To
ensure the accuracy of amplification of the ND2 and
cyt-b genes, we sequenced both heavy and light strands,

and verified that sequence data were protein-coding.

our first weighting scheme (two partitions) the ND2 and
cyt-b genes were unlinked and allowed to estimate gene
appropriate GTR + I + Γ parameters. In the second
(four partitions), first and second codons were linked
for ND2, linked for cyt-b gene, and third codon positions for each gene were treated as independent partitions. In the third scheme (six partitions), each codon
position was unlinked. We used MrModelTest [36] to
determine appropriate models of nucleotide substitution
and to choose best-fit model of sequence evolution for
each partition.
For each weighting scheme, we used MRBAYES [37] to
initiate four runs of four Markov-chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains of 2 million generations each from a random starting tree, sampling every 100 generations. Each
run resulted in 20,000 trees and converged on the same
topology. The first 50,000 generations (5000 trees) from
each analysis were removed as our “burn-in”, and the
remaining 60,000 trees were used to create a majority rule
consensus tree. A longer run of 4 million generations did
not affect tree topology or posterior probability values.
Bayes factors were computed using the harmonic means
of the likelihoods calculated from the sump command
within MRBAYES. A difference of 2 ln Bayes factor >10
was used as the minimum value to discriminate between
analysis schemes [38,39], and the six partition weighting
scheme was identified as the best fit to the data.
In addition to assessing nodal support via posterior
probabilities derived from MRBAYES, we also assessed
nodal support via 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates in
Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood Computing [RAxML-VI-Abe; [40]], using GTR + I + Γ parameters for each codon position.

We used the program BEAST v1.6.1 to estimate divergence times within Sylvia [41,42]. Prior to these analyses,
the data set was pruned to include only one representative of each species in most cases; two representatives per
species were included when high levels of genetic

differentiation were present within a species (e.g., curruca). Because of the absence of an acceptable fossil calibration point within Sylvia, we employed a lineage
substitution rate of 0.0105 per site/million years. This
mean substitution rate translates to 2.1% per million
years, and is generally accepted as applicable to the cyt-b
gene in songbirds [e.g., [43]]. We employed a normal distribution for this prior and assigned a standard deviation
of 0.0013, which encompasses a slower (1.6%) and faster
(2.53%) estimate calculated for songbird cyt-b substitution rates in other studies [44,45]. Before estimating
divergence times, likelihood ratio tests were performed
using PAUP* 4.0b10s [46] to determine if the cyt-b
sequence data departed significantly from clocklike behavior. These analyses revealed the Sylvia cyt-b data are not
clocklike, therefore our substitution rate was enforced
using a relaxed, uncorrelated lognormal clock. In BEAST,
a Yule process speciation prior and an uncorrelated lognormal model of rate variation were implemented in
each analysis. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution for the entire cyt-b gene was selected as described
above (GTR+I+G). Two separate MCMC analyses were
run for 10,000,000 generations with parameters sampled
every 1000 steps, and a 10% burn-in. Independent runs
were combined using LogCombiner v.1.6.1 [42]. Tracer
v.1.5 [47] was used to measure the effective sample size
of each parameter (all resulting effective sample sizes
exceeded 200) and calculate the mean and upper and
lower bounds of the 95% highest posterior density interval (95% HPD) for divergence times. Tree topologies
were assessed using TreeAnnotator v.1.6.1 [42] and FigTree v.1.3.1 [48]. Analyses performed separating codon
positions into individual partitions resulted in failure of
the BEAST run to converge after 100,000,000 generations
in the MCMC analyses.
Ancestral Areas

For biogeographic analysis, we used both DispersalVicariance Analysis [DIVA; [49]] and likelihood analysis
of geographic range evolution (dispersal-extinction cladogenesis) implemented in LaGrange v. 2.0.1 [50]. In
DIVA we used the “maxareas” option to limit the range
of ancestral distributions to no more than two areas. In
LaGrange we used the default number of ancestral distributions which is based on the overall number of area
distributions. In both analyses, we used range maps [4]
to code each species as present or absent in each of five
areas: Africa south of the Sahara, North Africa, Mediterranean Islands, Europe, and Asia (which was broadly
defined to include the Saudi Peninsula and the Middle
East; Figure 1). The dividing point between Europe and
Asia was Turkey (Figure 1). In LaGrange, ancestral areas
were reconstructed by performing likelihood optimizations on the BEAST maximum clade credibility tree.

Page 5 of 13

We ran two sets of analyses based on the above distributions. In the first, we included island distributions for
those species that also had broad continental distributions; this led to a result of Mediterranean Islands being
the ancestral area at most nodes in one major clade (see
below). In the second analyses, we only scored a species
as having an island distribution if it was an island endemic (balearica, sarda, melanothorax) or nearly endemic
(rueppelli).
Migration

We classified each species as having migratory or sedentary behavior, following the designations used by Böhning-Gaese et al. [2]. We used MacClade [51] to trace
and reconstruct ancestral character states across the
phylogeny.

Results
Sylvia phylogeny

We analyzed 1040 basepairs (bp) from the ND2 gene,
and 999 bp from the cyt-b gene, for a total of 2039 bp.
Given the lack of alignment problems (no insertions or
deletions) and stop codons, the genes amplified were
most likely of mitochondrial origin. Within our core
clade of Sylvia (Figure 2) there were 546 variable sites
(434 parsimony informative) in the ND2 data and 398
variable sites (341 parsimony informative) in the cyt-b
data. Mean nucleotide frequency for ND2 was A =
31.2%, C = 35.7%, G = 9.5%, T = 23.6%, with generally
similar values for cyt-b (26.4%, 35.2%, 13.6%, 24.8%).
Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses
identified a monophyletic Sylvia relative to the outgroup
taxa (Figure 2). Both Bayesian posterior probabilities
(PP) and ML bootstrap support (BS) values indicated
very strong support for most relationships in Sylvia. Just
four nodes were supported at less than 0.95 PP, and
only two nodes were supported at less than 75% BS
(Figure 2).
Three major clades are evident in the phylogeny
(Figure 2). Clade 1 comprises a group of four species, two
of which are endemic to Africa (dohrni and abysinnicus)
and two that breed largely in Europe or Eurasia and winter largely in Africa (borin and atricapilla). Voelker et al.
[3] previously suggested that dohrni belonged in this
clade as sister to abysinnicus, rather than in the monotypic genus Horizorhinus, and our results here confirm this.
The next divergence places Sylvia nana basal to the
two remaining major clades (Clades 2 and 3), although
the sister relationship between these major clades is not
well supported by either PP or BS measures (Figure 2).
Clade 2 comprises a group of 11 species with breeding
distributions around the Mediterranean (including
southwestern Asia), and includes three Mediterranean
island endemics (balearica, sarda, and melanothorax).

Nodal support values for most relationships in this clade
are high under one or both measures of support.
Clade 3 is comprised of species that breed around the
Mediterranean (including southwestern Asia), as well as
four African endemics (boehmi, subcaeruleum, layardi,
and lugens). Ten, and perhaps 11 species are included in
this clade, depending on how curruca 1 is defined
(Figure 2). The relatively deep divergence between our
curruca samples (8% uncorrected cyt-b data) suggests
that two species could be included here. Based on phenotypic and molecular data two species, minula and
althaea, have been recognized as species distinct from
curruca. However the systematics and species status of
minula and althaea remains controversial [4]. Our curruca 1 is from the defined range of “minula“ but we did
not have a sample from the range of althaea (2 and 3
are from the defined range of curruca). Regardless, as
minula is a Eurasian breeding migrant its recognition
here would not influence our additional analyses, and
we keep this sample identified as curruca. As with the
other major clades, relationships in this third clade are
strongly supported.
Biogeographic history and divergence dating

Ancestral area reconstructions in both DIVA and
LaGrange identified Asia, or Asia + Europe as probable
area(s) for the origin of Sylvia (Figure 3). Given the
position of Sylvia near or inside babblers (Timaliidae) in
broader phylogenies [e.g., [33,52]], Asia is the most
likely ancestral area. Overall, 24 dispersals were inferred
by DIVA to explain current distributions across Sylvia.
Molecular clock calibration sets the origin of Sylvia to
~20 Ma, with diversification of extant lineages beginning
at 19.4 Ma (Figure 4). Speciation of extant species
within Clade 1 is dated to 14.5 Ma (Figure 4) and Europe is reconstructed as the most likely ancestral area for
this clade (Figure 3). Following the divergences of atricapilla and borin, a sub-Saharan distribution was established (Figure 3), with a subsequent divergence between
dohrni (Gulf of Guinea Island endemic) and abysinnicus
(broad Afro-tropical distribution).
Sylvia nana diverged from the remaining Sylvia 14.5
Ma, and Clades 2 and 3 diverged from one another 12.6
Ma (Figure 4). Asia is reconstructed as the ancestral area
for these clades (Figure 3). Within Clade 3, four Asian to
African movements are evident. One movement accounts
for the North African component of the range of hortensis, while the remaining movements account for subSaharan distributions of lugens, leucomelaena and the
boehmi clade (Figure 3). Most divergences in Clade 3
occur in the Miocene and Pliocene; just one divergence is
dated in the Pleistocene (Figure 4).
Lineage divergence within Clade 2 began 6.8 Ma, prior
to the beginning of the MSC at 5.96 Ma (Figure 4). Six

subsequent divergences occur in the late Miocene and
four occur in the Pliocene (Figure 4). In Clade 2, Island
endemics are not each other’s closest relatives, indicating multiple vicariance or dispersal events. In this clade,
ancestral area reconstructions conflicted depending on
how species distributions were coded. If Island distribution was restricted to island endemics (balearica, sarda,
melanothorax) and rueppelli (a species with a combined
island and very small continental distribution), then
continental areas are reconstructed as ancestral for the
clade (Figure 3). However, if broadly distributed continental species that also have island distributions are
coded as such, then Island is reconstructed as the sole
ancestral area for every node in Clade 2 by LaGrange,
and for all but two nodes by DIVA (Island + another
area; Figure 3). This conflict results in competing interpretations of the biogeographic history of this clade (see
below).
Evolution of migration

Migration is reconstructed as the ancestral state for Sylvia, and as the ancestral state for each of the three
major clades (Figure 3). Seven changes in migratory
habit are evident but several branches are reconstructed
as equivocal under the most parsimonious reconstruction of character state (Figure 3). Using ACCTRAN
(change forced to base of tree) to resolve character
states at these equivocal nodes suggests that sedentary
behavior independently evolved four times, with migratory behavior subsequently evolving three times in two
otherwise sedentary clades. Using DELTRAN (change
delayed toward tree tips) to resolve character states
suggests that migration was lost seven times (no gains;
Figure 4). Deciding when to use ACCTRAN or DELTRAN can be problematic [e.g., [53]], but we suggest
that assuming more recent evolutionary changes (DELTRAN) in migratory behaviors are consistent with similar studies (both inter- and intraspecific) of other avian
lineages which suggest that birds can and do respond
rapidly to environmental changes by changing migratory
behaviors [e.g., [54]].

Discussion
Sylvia phylogeny

Even with long-standing interest in Sylvia systematic
relationships, and the use of Sylvia as a model system to
explore the evolution of patterns in morphology and
range sizes [e.g., [1,2,6,8,9]], the ML phylogeny presented here is the first strongly supported hypothesis of
relationships for the genus. Despite this, however, there
is topological concordance between our phylogeny and a
recent neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogeny used to assess
range size in Sylvia [9; BGEA hereafter]. Although the
BGEA phylogeny had just 10 of 24 nodes supported at

DIVA analysis; reconstructions below nodes are based on LaGrange analysis. Asterisks associated with individual species ranges indicate species
that have broad continental distributions, but that also have distributions on Mediterranean islands; reconstructions shown above and below

thus is considered as a possible ancestral area, DIVA or LaGrange reconstruct an Island ancestral area at all nodes in one major clade (indicated
by asterisks to the right of nodes). Dashed branches indicate equivocal reconstructions under the most parsimonious reconstruction of migratory
habit.

Figure 4 Molecular clock estimates of lineage divergence times in Sylvia, based on a cyt-b mean rate calibration of 2.1% per million
years (see text). Bars at nodes indicate 95% highest posterior density interval. The vertical shaded rectangle indicates the duration of the
Mediterranean Salinity Crisis; the end of the MSC marks the end of the Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene. The vertical dashed line
indicates the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. Arrows with “ML” indicate lineages that have lost long-distance migration.

>74% BS, it recovered the three major clades that we
recovered in our more exhaustive searches; Sylvia nana
was similarly positioned as well.
Intra-clade differences do exist between the BGEA NJ
and our ML topologies. Our Clade 1 places S. atricapilla basally and places S. borin as sister to other clade
members (abyssinica + dohrni), whereas abyssinica
occupies the basal position with atricapilla and borin as
sisters in BGEA. Our Clade 2 places the deserticola,
melanothorax, and mystacea clade as sister to all other
clade members, while BGEA places communis as the
basal taxon. Our placement of communis renders a
“Mediterranean species group” [2,8] polyphyletic. Differences in Clade 2 also include the placement of rueppelli,
deserticola, conspicillata, and consequently sister relationship differences are evident as well. Our Clade 3 is
topologically congruent with that of BGEA, with the
exception of hortensis which BGEA placed basally to
crassirostris and leucomelaena. Thus, while there are

topological similarities between our phylogeny and that
of BGEA (which is itself similar to previous phylogenies
based on NJ or DNA-DNA hybridization [1,2,8]), sufficient differences exist to warrant reassessment of results
based on those topologies, all of which were less well
supported than our ML phylogeny.
It is possible that nuclear sequence data could provide
support for the few nodes that have low support in our
phylogeny (Figure 2), or narrow the confidence intervals
on our divergence estimates (Figure 4). However, in
most avian systematic studies which combine nuclear
with mtDNA data or that use nuclear data to test
mtDNA results, the nuclear data have not been overly
successful at supporting relationships except when species are highly divergent or species-level sampling within
a genus is low [e.g. [54,55]]. With respect to divergence
dating, studies that examine ways to narrow credibility
intervals find that the most important factors affecting
divergence time estimation using molecular data are the

Voelker and Light BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:163
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/163

number and distribution of calibration points on the
tree [56-59]. These calibrations are primarily fossils,
which are generally lacking in number and temporal distribution for most songbird lineages.
Biogeography and lineage diversification: the MSC versus
over-water dispersal

Did the MSC impact speciation in Sylvia, as it has other
animal lineages [e.g., [17-24]]? Our divergence dating
results suggest that the MSC probably did have an
impact, albeit very limited. This is particularly relevant
with respect to Clade 2 where most species are distributed around the Mediterranean Sea or on Mediterranean
Islands (Figures 3, 4). The initial divergences within
Clade 2 occur before the beginning of the MSC, with
confidence intervals indicating a possibility that diversification could have begun during the MSC. However,
these pre-MSC diversifications are not divergences
between terminal taxa or between Island versus mainland (or Africa versus Europe) groups. Therefore, we
cannot make a convincing argument for population
expansion during MSC followed by population fragmentation and isolation as the Mediterranean refilled (i.e.,
vicariance) as a main driver of speciation in Sylvia.
Consequently, we must instead argue that there has
been substantial overwater (trans-Mediterranean) dispersal in Clade 2 since the MSC to explain why many species have Europe + North African distributions (Figure
3). A dispersal argument is supported by the high number of dispersal events inferred by DIVA, and the high
number of dispersals can probably be linked to most
species with Europe + North African (or broader) distributions being migratory (Figure 3).
Further, several Island restricted species (balearica
and sarda) clearly achieved their distributions well after
the MSC, which suggests over-water dispersals (Figure
4). However, divergence estimates for melanothorax
(island endemic) and rueppelli (near island endemic)
suggest the possibility that these species achieved their
island distributions during the MSC, and became isolated as the Mediterranean refilled at 5.33 Ma (Figure
4). As mentioned above, ancestral area reconstructions
and thus biogeographic reconstructions conflict depending on how Island is coded. As such, Islands are either
the ancestral distribution for this clade, or they are
derived distributions from an Asian ancestral area (Figure 3). While island distributions are typically derived
from continental areas [e.g., [16,28,55]], it is clear that
islands may also be the source area(s) from which continental distributions are established [e.g., [14,15,28,56]];
migratory behavior is often invoked in the establishment
of these distributions.
Post-Miocene divergence dates suggest that Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean Sea level changes and glacial

Page 10 of 13

cycles can also be implicated as factors in driving speciation in Clade 2, where many species have distributions that include Europe (Figure 3). If these factors can
be implicated this would suggest that lineage divergence
occurred in and between refugial areas [e.g., [34,57-59]].
However, given the extensive range overlap of many closely related species (e.g., rueppelli, melanocephala, cantillans) in Clade 2, we are unable to address this
possibility with our data. Phylogeographic studies of
European species would be necessary to identify ancestral populations, and to determine whether currently
overlapping species were in fact isolated in different
refugial areas.
Biogeography and lineage diversification: the role of
migration

It does seem likely that migration played a role in the
diversification and distribution of Sylvia, as migratory
changes in Clade 2 are consistent with the establishment
of all three Island endemic distributions (Figure 3). If
Island is the ancestral area for Clade 2, then migratory
+ Island are the states reconstructed at most basal
nodes; subsequently some Island endemics became nonmigratory residents, and continental distribution evolves
six times (Figure 3). However, given that migration is
the ancestral state for the clade and because no extant
Island breeding endemic species has retained long-distance migratory behavior, we feel it more parsimonious
to assume that Island endemic distributions in Clade 2
were derived from continental distributions as function
of the loss of migration (Figure 3). This then suggests
that broadly distributed migratory ancestors’ established
Island distributions, lost their migratory habit, and were
then isolated to become sedentary residents. An exception to this pattern could be melanothorax, which may
have lost migration after isolation during the MSC (see
above; Figure 3). A loss of long-distance migration is
also related to the distribution of deserticola in North
Africa, and the Island + mainland (coastal Mediterranean) distribution of undata (Figure 3).
It is less clear how the loss of migration might have
played a role in lineage divergence and distribution elsewhere on the phylogeny. In Clade 1, a migratory loss is
inferred for the African species dohrni and abysinnicus
and is related to their divergence from borin (Figure 3),
a Eurasian-breeding species which winters in Africa.
This migratory drop-off in Africa suggests a response to
ecological change or opportunity, which can clearly play
a role in whether migration is gained or lost [e.g.,
[54,60]]. However, the dohrni-abysinnicus divergence
from borin at 12.7 Ma cannot be directly linked to
Afro-tropical forest expansion which has been widely
implicated in vertebrate speciation in Africa (see below)
at ca. 5 Ma [Figure 4; [61-63]]. Neither forest dynamics

Voelker and Light BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:163
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/163

nor change in migratory behavior can explain the divergence between abysinnicus (widespread in Africa) and
dohrni [endemic to Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea;
[64]]. This divergence is necessarily explained by an
over-water dispersal event by our data here, and the fact
that Príncipe is part of the oceanic sector of the volcanic
Cameroon Line, and as such has never been connected
to mainland Africa [65]. Given the recent discovery that
dohrni belongs within Sylvia [3] it is possible that other
Sylvia taxa are currently recognized under other genera.
One possible example is Lioptilus nigricapillus, which
was shown to fall between atricapilla and abysinnicus
[but no other Sylvia included; [52]]. Inclusion of Lioptilus in a Bayesian analysis (unpublished data from S.
Reddy) indicates a sister relationship with dohrni and
abysinnicus (not shown) thereby supporting just a single
loss of migration in this clade. Additional “unrecognized” African Sylvia could change both the sister relationship we report for dohrni-abysinnicus, as well as our
inference regarding when migration was lost in Clade 1.
In Clade 3, migration was lost three times (Figure 3)
and these losses are primarily associated with African
taxa. Given that Asia is reconstructed as the ancestral
area for this clade, and that migratory behavior is also
ancestral, this suggests that these sedentary African
lineages are the result of migratory drop-offs (see also
below).
Biogeographic and lineage diversification: other factors
driving speciation in Sylvia

It is clear that for species with breeding distributions
across Eurasia or that are endemic to Asia or Africa
south of the Sahara, factors other than the MSC must
be considered to explain lineage divergences. These
divergences can include deep intra-specific differences.
For example, the divergence between our samples of
curruca (dated to 4.9 Ma; Figure 4), could be related to
Central Asian aridification peaks which fragmented multiple Eurasian avian lineages through time [66]. This
explanation is less likely to explain the deep divergences
in either atricapilla or borin, as neither breeds in Eastern Asia [4]. However, divergences in both species are
dated near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (ca. 1.8 Ma;
Figure 4), suggesting that European glacial events may
have been involved in their divergences. European Pleistocene refugia have been suggested to explain divergences within cantillans [34], although that study did
not attempt to date lineage divergences; our results suggest that very late Pliocene events might also have been
important for atricapilla and borin. An alternative for
the divergence of atricapilla is that disjunct wintering
ranges translate to genetically isolated breeding populations. Although wintering range is not fragmented for
borin, there is clear evidence that migratory route is

Page 11 of 13

under strong genetic control in this species [5,7], and
ringing recoveries indicate that breeding populations
winter, to some extent, in different areas [4] and are
therefore potentially isolated from one another yearround.
At ca. 9.8 Ma Clade 3 diverged in to two sub-clades
(Figure 4), one of which is endemic to Africa and is the
result of a dispersal event (with migratory loss) from
Asia according to ancestral area reconstructions (Figure
3). This clade comprises three arid-adapted species:
boehmi is distributed from Ethiopia to Tanzania, while
both layardi and subcaeruleum are distributed in southern-most Africa [64]. The timing of movement of this
clade from Asia into Africa (Figure 4) was likely facilitated by climate and habitat changes that resulted in an
increase in grasses (i.e., more open habitats) in east
Africa from 9-5 Ma [see [25,26]], and an inferred movement during this period is consistent with Eurasian to
African dispersals by other arid-adapted birds [e.g.,
[16,35]]. Isolation from an Asian ancestor (and a migratory loss) could be explained by tropical forest expansion at 5 Ma, which would have served as a vicariance
event isolating this clade in southern Africa [e.g.,
[16,35]].
A second dispersal in this sub-clade, from southern to
northeastern Africa, is necessary to explain the distribution of boehmi which diverged from a common ancestor
with subcaeruleum 7 Ma (Figure 4). This date seems
inconsistent with the general pattern of speciation in
arid-adapted species, in that the current range of boehmi
spans, both to the north and to the south, the region of
eastern Africa where the Afrotropical forest expanded to
coastal Kenya. We suggest that prior to establishing its
current range, boehmi was either isolated in the north
(Ethiopia) from subcaeruleum prior to forest expansion
with an extended period for divergence, or that boehmi
was isolated in the south (Tanzania). The latter seems
more likely given the divergence and palaeo-climatic
dates (a phylogeographic study could discriminate
between scenarios). A Tanzanian isolation scenario suggests that subcaeruleum and boehmi may have diverged
across different arid zone habitats; a similar explanation
is necessary to explain their divergence from layardi,
whose distribution extensively overlaps that of subcaeruleum [64].
Distributions of the remaining species in Clade 3
involve one dispersal to North Africa + Europe + Islands
(hortensis) and two dispersals to Africa (lugens and leucomelaena; Figure 3). The Red Sea is involved in both
the distribution of leucomelaena (western and southern
Saudi Peninsula + Egypt to Eritrea) and the lugens
(Ethiopia to Tanzania) divergence from its common
ancestor with buryi (Saudi Peninsula). The Red Sea
expanded ca. 7 Ma and seawater had penetrated the

Voelker and Light BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:163
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/163

northern region of the sea by at least 5 Ma [67,68], suggesting that the sea has been a barrier to biotic dispersion since the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. The
exception to this is evidence of land-bridges thought to
have formed five times during the last 500,000 years, as
a result of sea-level lowering during glacial maxima
[69,70]. The lugens-buryi divergence is dated at 2.9 Ma
(Figure 4), suggesting a dispersal event across the Red
Sea. This date is consistent with Pliocene tropical forest
retraction ca. 3-2.5 Ma ago [61-63], and the concomitant expansion of grassland and desert environments in
northeastern Africa [71]. Thus, the lugens-buryi divergence occurred when suitable habitat became available;
similar ‘suitable habitat’ arguments have, when temporally associated with lineage divergences, been used to
explain African-Asian interchange in lizards [31], birds
[16,27,28] and mammals [25,26,30]. Although our single
sample does not allow us to discuss the evolution of distribution in S. leucomelaena, additional sampling could
reveal whether its trans-Red Sea distribution is the
result of over-water dispersal, movement between the
Saudi Peninsula and Egypt, or movement across landbridges during the last 500,000 years.

Conclusion
Our analyses provide the first well-resolved phylogeny
for Sylvia warblers, a focal genus for a variety of morphological, behavioral, systematic, and evolutionary studies [e.g., [1,2,5,7-9]]. Molecular clock calibration
suggests that Sylvia arose in the early Miocene (19.4
Ma), and that few lineage divergences in the genus were
directly driven by palaeo-climatic changes associated
with the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Losses of long-distance migratory behavior are correlated with several
lineage divergences and distributions, particularly African lineages or Island endemic species. Elsewhere in the
phylogeny, divergences can be linked to broad-scale
palaeo-climatic events that have been shown to have
affected a multitude of vertebrate lineages in both Eurasia [e.g., [66]] and Africa [e.g., [16,26,29,31,35]]. There is
evidence that palaeo-climatic changes near the PlioPleistocene boundary may have impacted lineage divergences in Sylvia [34, this study], and additional study is
needed to determine if these divergences warrant the
recognition of additional Sylvia species.
