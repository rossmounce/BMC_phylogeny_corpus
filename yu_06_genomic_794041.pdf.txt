Abstract
Background: The Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) is the causative agent
of the human disease melioidosis. To understand the evolutionary mechanisms contributing to Bp
virulence, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of Bp K96243 and B. thailandensis (Bt)
E264, a closely related but avirulent relative.
Results: We found the Bp and Bt genomes to be broadly similar, comprising two highly syntenic
chromosomes with comparable numbers of coding regions (CDs), protein family distributions, and
horizontally acquired genomic islands, which we experimentally validated to be differentially
present in multiple Bt isolates. By examining species-specific genomic regions, we derived
molecular explanations for previously-known metabolic differences, discovered potentially new
ones, and found that the acquisition of a capsular polysaccharide gene cluster in Bp, a key virulence
component, is likely to have occurred non-randomly via replacement of an ancestral polysaccharide
cluster. Virulence related genes, in particular members of the Type III secretion needle complex,
were collectively more divergent between Bp and Bt compared to the rest of the genome, possibly
contributing towards the ability of Bp to infect mammalian hosts. An analysis of pseudogenes
between the two species revealed that protein inactivation events were significantly biased towards
membrane-associated proteins in Bt and transcription factors in Bp.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that a limited number of horizontal-acquisition events, coupled
with the fine-scale functional modulation of existing proteins, are likely to be the major drivers
underlying Bp virulence. The extensive genomic similarity between Bp and Bt suggests that, in some
cases, Bt could be used as a possible model system for studying certain aspects of Bp behavior.

Background
Identifying the molecular mechanisms and pathways
responsible for generating and regulating pathogen virulence is a key challenge of infectious diseases research.
Besides increasing our basic understanding of pathogen
behavior, such information is also essential for many clinically-relevant areas including the acquisition of drug
resistance, vaccine design, and the emergence of new diseases [1,2]. With the increasing availability of complete
genome sequence data from multiple microbial pathogens, comparative genomics has recently emerged as a
powerful tool to understand the basic molecular properties of pathogens. A particularly useful analysis in this
regard has been to compare the genomes of a virulent species to a closely related but avirulent family member. Such
studies have revealed the fundamental importance of horizontal acquisition, gene mutation, genome rearrangements, and bacteriophage mediated recombination in the
development of virulence [3-5]. However, of the >60
microbial pathogens sequenced to date, less than a quarter (<15) have been compared in this manner. To achieve
a broad understanding of the general mechanisms governing the evolution of pathogens, it is likely that such comparative analysis will be required for several more
pathogenic species.
The Gram-negative pathogen B. pseudomallei (Bp) is the
causative agent of melioidosis, a serious, often fatal disease of both humans and animals [6,7]. Endemic to many
parts of South East Asia and Northern Australia, Bp is considered a major tropical pathogen [8] and Category B biowarfare agent [9]. In many countries, Bp can only be
experimentally manipulated under biosafety level 3
(BSL3) conditions (ABSA, USA). In contrast to Bp, the
related species B. thailandensis (Bt) is nonpathogenic for
humans and animals although it displays several phenotypic characteristics similar to Bp. Indeed, by routine diagnostic tests, it is often difficult to distinguish the two [10].
Like Bp, Bt is also a soil saprophyte, and until its classification as a distinct species in 1998 was considered to represent a subtype of Bp [11,12]. Recently, the genome
sequence of one Bt strain, E264, was reported and compared to Bp and B. mallei, another related species [13].
However, in that work, most of the comparative analysis
was confined to a set of 716 genes transcriptionally regulated in B. mallei upon mouse infection, representing less
than 15% of all genes in Bp. The identification of Bt-specific genetic elements was also not addressed in that
report, which might also prove important for understanding virulence, as recent reports have suggested that gene
loss can also contribute to pathogenesis [14]. To definitely
address the roles of horizontal transfer, gene mutation,
and transcriptional plasticity on the development of Bp
virulence, a comprehensive genome-wide comparison of
Bp and Bt is required.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/46

In this work, we report the draft genome sequence of Bt
strain ATCC700388, corresponding to the same strain as
Bt E264. By comparing the ATCC700388 draft sequence
against the finished Bt E264 genome, we corrected certain
sequencing errors in the reported Bt E264 genome, and
compared the refined Bt strain E264 sequence to the
genome of Bp K96243 [15]. We find that Bp and Bt are
broadly similar at many genomic levels – for example,
both species display highly conserved genomic synteny,
and appear to share an extensive repertoire of genes
involved in core metabolism, accessory pathways, structure-based superfamilies and bacterial virulence factors.
Despite these similarities, our analysis also revealed that
in comparison to the rest of the genome, virulence-related
genes in Bp appear to have undergone accelerated change,
perhaps to better adapt to the challenge of infecting and
surviving in a human or animal host. We also defined a
series of key large-scale differences between Bp and Bt
contributing to novel metabolic differences between the
two species, and others that may be critically required for
virulence. Our results raise several testable hypotheses
regarding key virulence components in Bp, and enhance
our general understanding of pathogen evolution. Finally,
the broad similarities between Bp and Bt also raise the
possibility that Bt could prove useful as a potential model
organism to study certain aspects of Bp biology.

Results
Bt is closely related to Bp by 16S phylogeny
The Burkholderia genus is a large bacterial family containing >30 distinct species [16]. We estimated approximate
divergence times between Bt and other species in the Burkholderia genus by comparing on a phylogenetic basis 16S
rRNA gene sequences from four Burkholderia species and
three outgroup species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa
LMG1242T, Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2). From this analysis, we found that Bt occupies a
branch in the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree that is highly
related, but not identical, to B. pseudomallei (Bp) and B.
mallei (supplementary figure one in Additional file 1). The
close phylogenetic similarity between Bp and B. mallei is
expected given that recent genome analysis suggests that
B. mallei is in fact a derivative or clone of Bp [17]. A calibration of the phylogenetic tree against the E. coli and S.
typhimurium divergence, estimated at 140 million years
(Mya) [18], suggests that Bt diverged from Bp and B. mallei approximately 47 Mya ago. Similar time-frames were
also obtained using groEL, another highly conserved
housekeeping gene (Y. Yu, data not shown). This analysis
suggests that although Bt is avirulent, it is likely to be
highly evolutionarily related to virulent Bp, and a good
candidate for comparative genomic analaysis. Notably,
the Bp/Bt separation times are comparable to that used in
other studies comparing pathogenic and non-pathogenic
species [19,20].

Genome sequencing of Bt ATCC700388 and comparison to
Bt E264
Genomic DNA from Bt ATCC700388 was sequenced by a
shotgun approach to 7x genome coverage, and the computer program ARACHNE was then employed to assemble
the shotgun reads into contigs and scaffolds. The median
contig length was 40 Kb (86 contigs in total), and 3 scaffolds could be assembled from the contigs, comprising
3.4, 2.9, and 0.35 Mb respectively. A subsequent comparison of these scaffolds to the finished Bt E264 sequence
allowed the 1st and 3rd scaffold to be collapsed into a single assembly (Chromosome 1). The amount of genome
sequence contained in contigs (sum of contig lengths)
was 6.66 Mb (Chr 1 – 3.78 Mb, Chr 2 – 2.88 Mb), compared with a total genome length (sum of scaffold lengths,
including estimated gaps between contigs) of 6.7 Mb (Chr
1 – 3.80 Mb, Chr 2 – 2.9 Mb). Thus, approximately 99%
of the Bt ATCC700388 genome is contained in contigs,
with 44 sequence gaps (29 in Chr 1, 15 in Chr 2), of which
15 gaps are larger than 500 bp (largest gap size being 9995
bp).

Although Bt ATCC700388 and Bt E264 represent the same
bacterial strain, the specific isolates chosen for sequencing
were stored at independent centers (DMERI and USAMRIID), and Bt ATCC700388 exhibits a slightly reduced
growth rate compared to Bt E264 (Additional file 2). An
analysis of the E264 and ATCC700388 genome sequences
revealed that they were near identical except for : I) a chromosomal inversion of 2 Mbp on Chr 1, from position
12442442 (BTH_I1099) to 3328461 (BTH_I2895) based
on the E264 genome sequence, II) 4 genes that are absent
in ATCC70388, and III) 80 genes with putative protein
sequence-altering DNA polymorphisms between the two
strains (a full list of these genes is presented in Additional
file 3). An initial resequencing analysis of genes in category III) revealed that several of the putative DNA 'polymorphisms' were sequencing artifacts, and thus an
extensive analysis of genes in this category was not pursued further (Additional file 3). Of the four ATCC70388
absent genes, two genes (Bth_I1484 and Bth_I1485) were

experimentally validated by PCR (Chua HH, data not
shown) and encode components of a Type II Oligopolysaccharide (OPS) synthesis gene cluster [21]. It is possible that the lack of these genes in ATCC700388 may
contribute towards the observed growth differences by
affecting Bt cell wall and membrane biogenesis. Although
this hypothesis is supported by studies of the Bth_I1484
homolog in B. subtilis (TagO, 22), we emphasize that it is
still highly speculative and needs to be further investigated. As the genomes of both strains (ATCC700388 and
E264) were largely similar, we decided to adopt the finished E264 genome, after incorporating corrections for a
few sequencing errors, as a reference Bt genome to compare against Bp.
Genome features of Bt
Similar to Bp, the Bt genome comprises two circular chromosomes of 3.8 and 2.9 Megabases (Figure 1). With a
total of 5,645 predicted protein-encoding ORFs (3282
from Chromosome 1 and 2363 from Chromosome 2)
(Table 1), the Bt genome ranks in the top twelve largest
bacterial genomes amongst the 200-odd bacterial
genomes sequenced at the time of writing this report (supplementary figure two in Additional file 1). A striking
architectural feature of the Bt genome is the presence of at
least fifteen regions exhibiting either atypical GC content
or stretches of bacteriophage related genes and phage-like
integrases (supplementary table one in Additional file 1).
Collectively encompassing 4–5% of the entire genome,
we refer to these regions as Bt-genomic islands (Bt-GIs), in
keeping with similar regions found in Bp [15]. The Bt-GIs
are not found in Bp and B. mallei, consistent with their
being acquired by Bt subsequent to the Bp-Bt divergence.
Supporting a model of recent acquisition, it has been
found that some of these regions (eg. Bt-GI12) may still
harbor functionally active bacteriophages [23]. Interestingly, of the ten Bt-GIs on Chromosome 1 and five on
Chromosome 2, three Bt-GIs (Bt-GI 8, Bt-GI 9, and Bt-GI
10) occur in the same relative genomic location as GIs in
the Bp genome. The presence of different horizontally
acquired sequences in the same genomic location in

related species suggests that these locations may represent
genomic hot spots or landmarks for the acquisition of
horizontally acquired sequences.
To experimentally show that the Bt-GIs are likely to represent regions of lateral transfer between different Bt strains,
we then performed a series of PCR experiments to confirm
the presence or absence of the fifteen Bt-GIs in 29 natural
isolates of Bt, obtained from independent soil locations in
either Northeast (n = 21) or Central Thailand (n = 8, 9 if
E264 is also considered). We found that the distribution
of Bt-GIs was indeed highly variable between different Bt
strains (Figure 2). Specifically, while Bt-GIs 1, 3, 8 and 10
appear to be unique to Bt E264, GIs 2, 4, 5, 12, 13 were
detected in 10–50% of strains and the rest of the GIs were
detected in 50–80% of strains. Interestingly, GI 12 was
present in 4 out of 9 strains isolated from Central Thailand (including E264), but absent from all Northeast
Thailand strains. These results indicate that the Bt

genome, like Bp, indeed contains a substantial fraction of
genomic material that is highly variable in different
strains. It is thus possible that genes on these islands may
contribute to the presence of different strain-specific phenotypes.
Genomic synteny and large-scale differences between the
Bp and Bt genomes
To assess large-scale genomic similarities between Bp and
Bt, we aligned the two genomes and found that both chromosomes were highly syntenic between the two species
(Figure 3). Specifically, we identified only four large-scale
inversions involving genomic regions greater than 10 Kb;
three in Chromosome 1 and one in Chromosome 2. Six
out of the eight breakpoints flanking these inversions contain genes involved in DNA recombination such as transposases,
phage
integrases
and
recombinases
(supplementary table two in Additional file 1). At this
large-scale resolution, we did not observe any evidence for

exchange of genetic material across the two chromosomes. The high degree of synteny between Bt and Bp is
unexpected, given the fundamental plasticity of bacterial
genomes, and because a previous analysis has demonstrated a much higher degree of genome rearrangement
events between Bp and B. mallei, which is even more
closely related [17]. The syntenic conservation of Bp and
Bt is also considerably higher than that observed between
other virulent and non-virulent bacteria species, despite
the latter having smaller genome sizes and similar or
shorter divergence times from that of Bt and Bp [5]. This
unexpected result raises the possibility that that there may
exist certain functional constraints acting as a negative
selective forces to preserve the large-scale genomic organization of Bp and Bt.
The acquisition and loss of large-scale genomic material
represents a major driving force in bacterial evolution and
often plays a critical role in the development of novel
microbial phenotypes. These species-specific regions,
which include the Bp-GIs and Bt-GIs, could largely be collapsed into a series of discrete genomic stretches, often
exceeding 100 kb. We classified these regions into three

categories: I) Bp-specific, representing regions present in
Bp but absent in Bt; II) Bt-specific, for regions present in
Bt but absent in Bp; and III) Bp-Bt-divergent, representing
regions of distinct CDS content but which are present in
both species at similar genomic locations. We now discuss
a few interesting examples from these three categories (see
Table 2), and a comprehensive list is provided supplementary table three (see Additional file 1). Notably, we
have deliberately excluded the Bp and Bt GIs from this
analysis, since they have already been described earlier
and in a previous report [15].
Metabolism
Although Bp and Bt occupy similar ecological niches, previous biochemical analysis has identified several phenotypic differences between the species, including the ability
of Bt, but not Bp, to assimilate the carbon sources arabinose and xylose [24]. Confirming a previous report [25],
we found that Bt contains an eight-gene arabinose assimilation operon (BTH_II1626–1633) on Chromosome 2
that is absent in Bp. In Bp, this region has been replaced
by a two protein cluster containing one hypothetical protein and one MarR family regulatory protein. A similar sit-

uation is likely to explain the differences in xylose
metabolism as well. We found that Bt contains a 64 kb
region on Chromosome 1 encoding several genes
involved in xylose metabolism, including an aldose epimerase, xylose isomerase, xylose ABC transporter and an
operon regulator (BTH_I2336–2339). This region, however, is absent in Bp, which instead carries GI 8 in the
same location (Figure 4a). This result suggests an evolutionary model where the horizontal acquisition of GI 8 by
Bp may have also resulted in deletion of the xylose gene
cluster, demonstrating how horizontal transfer events can
often result in simultaneous gene acquisition and loss. We
also identified a thirteen-gene phosphonate gene cluster
(BPSL2848–2860) on Chromosome 1 in Bp that was
absent in Bt, consisting of ATP-binding (phnC, phnKL,
phnN), phosphonate binding (phnD), metabolism (phnM,
phnJ-G), and transport proteins (phnE), and a transcriptional regulator (phnF) (Figure 4b). In other species, gene

products of the phn operon are required for the utilization
of phosphonate as a phosphorus source [26], and are also
involved in the uptake of phosphite, phosphate, and
phosphate esters such as phosphoserine [27]. Since phosphorus availability is essential for many aspects of cell
physiology, the lack of this operon in Bt suggests that
other mechanisms must exist for acquiring phosphate in
Bt. Supporting this hypothesis, the Bt genome contains
several genes that could function in alternative pathways
for phosphorus acquisition, including alkylphosphonate
(BTH_I0257), phosphoglycerate (BTH_I3017–3022),
and l-phosphonoalanine (BTH_II1908–1910) gene clusters.
Virulence
We attempted to identify genomic regions that might specifically contribute to the differential virulence of Bp and
Bt. Variations in surface component proteins have been

shown to contribute to virulence in several pathogenic
species. For example, fimbriae are short pilus structures
that allow bacteria to adhere to environmental surfaces
and host cells, and Bp has been shown to be more efficient
than Bt in adhering to and invading host cells [28]. We
found that Bp contains twice as many fimbrial gene clusters (six) as Bt. Of the three Bp-specific fimbrial gene clusters (BPSL1626–1629, BPSL1799–1801, BPSS0120–
0123), one cluster on Chromosome 2 is of particular
interest as it contains a fimbrial usher protein, a fimbrial
chaperone and two exported proteins with similarity to

to have been horizontally acquired by Bp as its GC con-

tent significantly deviates from the rest of the Bp genome,
and replaces a flagellar operon (BTH_II0143–0197) in the
homologous position in the Bt genome (Figure 5a). In
addition to fimbriae, another important class of surfacerelated proteins that could contribute to virulence are surface polysaccharides. It has been previously shown by
other molecular techniques that Bp contains a large gene
cluster (BPSL2790–2810) involved in the synthesis and
export of capsular polysaccharides, a major determinant
of virulence, and that this cluster is absent in Bt [29]. We
confirmed this finding and further discovered that the
specific location of the Bp capsule gene cluster within the
Bp genome is likely to be non-random, as it replaces a preexisting 10-gene cluster in Bt already dedicated towards

the metabolism and processing of polysaccharide structures (Figure 5b). Specifically, the original cluster in Bt
contains several genes involved in polysaccharide assembly, such as GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, a
GDP-mannose 4, 6-dehydratase, a methyltransferase and
four glycosyltransferases, which are all involved in GDPD-rhamnose biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [30].
This result expands our depth of understanding surrounding this important acquisition event, and raises the
intriguing possibility that a key event in the pathogenic
evolution of Bp was to replace a pre-existing or ancestral
polysaccharide coat with an alternative pathogenic variant
capable of resisting challenges by the immune system of
an infected host. In addition to surface molecules, another
broad class of molecules that might contribute to virulence is secondary metabolites with toxin activities [31].
There are four polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal pepeide synthase (NRPS) clusters involved in the
production and regulation of secondary metabolites that
are present in Bp but absent in Bt, containing genes
encoding putative resistance proteins (BPSS1011), efflux
proteins (BPSS1268) and lipopeptide antibiotic proteins
(BPSS1631–1634), which could be involved in toxin production. Other differences, including the previously
reported absence of a type III secretion system (TTS1) in
Bt [32], are listed in the supplementary table three and
table four (see Additional file 1).
The Bp and Bt genome share similar protein family
distributions
The SUPERFAMILY hidden Markov model library [33] is a
database representing all proteins of known structure
derived using Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP)
defined structural folds. We used SUPERFAMILY analysis
to classify and compare evolutionarily related groups of
domains between the two organisms. We queried the predicted proteomes of Bp and Bt against the SUPERFAMILY
HMM library and obtained structural (and hence implied
functional) assignments to protein sequences at the superfamily level for both species. This exercise produced 3706
Bt sequences with 721 unique SCOP superfamilies and
3645 Bp sequences with 705 unique SCOP superfamilies.
The top 20 structural families assigned to Bp and Bt protein sequences are provided in supplementary table five
(see Additional file 1). We found the distribution of different structural family assignments highly similar
between Bp and Bt, supporting our basic conclusion that
genomes of Bt and Bp are highly conserved. The most
populated superfamily in both organisms were P-loop
containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (~7.7%),
with a local sequence motif ([AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]) for ATP/
GTP binding. The second and third most distributed
superfamilies are winged helix DNA-binding domain
(~6%) and NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/46

(~5%), which are involved in DNA-binding and NAD(P)binding respectively.
Virulence genes in Bp and Bt exhibit increased diversity
Besides the acquisition of large-scale genomic material,
alterations in the amino acid composition of protein
homologs could also play an important role in the phenotypic differences of Bp and Bt, by altering protein activities
and specificities. To perform a systematic analysis of the
Bp and Bt proteomes, we identified and compared 4630
orthologous protein pairs (2826 from Chromosome 1
and 1804 from Chromosome 2) between the two
genomes, and mapped them to them to their respective
metabolic pathways. We found strong conservation
between the Bp and Bt proteomes in core metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, cofactor and carrier
synthesis, nucleotide and protein biosynthesis, consistent
with the ability of Bp and Bt to occupy similar environmental niches [24]. Based upon KEGG annotations, only
five out of 1997 genes involved in core metabolic pathways in Bp do not have a clear homolog in Bt, including a
putative ATP-binding protein (BPSL2860), a putative
acetyltransferase (BPSL1417), a putative RNA 2'-phosphotransferase (BPSL0762) and two ABC transporters
(BPSL1824, BPSL2849). This result suggests that the central metabolic machineries utilized by Bp and Bt are likely
to be highly similar. Unexpectedly, the Bp and Bt proteomes also appear to share significant similarities in their
virulence components as well. Specifically, of 368 known
and potential virulence genes in Bp [15], 275 orthologs
(71%) are present in Bt at an average similarity of greater
than 80% (see supplementary table four in Additional file
1), including two type three secretion systems (TTS2 and
TTS3), antibiotic resistance genes, type IV pili-generating
proteins, hemolysin-related genes, and several adhesion
factors and proteases. Of the remaining 93 Bp-specific virulence-related genes, 20 are located in Bp GIs or regions
of atypical GC content, and 73 within the core Bp
genome.

We then investigated if specific components of the Bp and
Bt genomes might exhibit significantly greater or lesser
levels of diversity, by computing synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rates (Ka and Ks) for
orthologous protein pairs. The average Ka/Ks ratio for Bp
and Bt orthologs was 0.069 (0 – 1.14) for Chromosome 1
and 0.099 (0 – 1.20) for Chromosome 2, where low ratios
suggest decreased diversity (p < 0.001 for Chr1 vs Chr2).
The significantly lower Ka/Ks ratio for Chromosome 1 is
consistent with this chromosome encoding many proteins involved in core biological functions, including
energy production and conversion genes, genetic information processing, cell cycle control. Supporting this
hypothesis, the Ka/Ks ratio of core metabolism genes
(0.05) from both chromosomes was significantly lower

establishes a specific physical interface between the pathogen and host [34]. It is tempting to speculate that subtle
functional alterations in these specific TTS3 genes could
have contributed towards the ability of Bp to successfully
infect human and other animal hosts. In addition to the
TTS3 members, four genes of unknown cellular function
(one from chromosome 1 and three from chromosome 2)
also exhibited Ka/Ks ratios greater than one, suggesting
that they might be rapidly evolving. However, no predictable function or identified domains could be assigned to
these four genes, thus not allowing speculation on their
roles in pathogenesis.

than the genome average (p < 0.001). In contrast, the average Ka/Ks ratio of ortholgous virulence genes (0.099) was
significantly higher than the genome average (p < 0.001,
Figure 6a), suggesting that these virulence-associated
genes are likely to exhibit increased diversity between Bp
and Bt compared to other genes. Intriguingly, genes associated with the Type III secretion cluster TTS3, including
BPSS1547 (prgH), BPSS1549 (mxiI/prgJ), BPSS1551 and
BPSS1552 (orgA and B), exhibited the highest level of
divergence among the virulence related genes between Bp
and Bt. In other species, prgH and prgJ proteins are integral
members of the Type III secretion needle complex, which

Functional biases in Bp and Bt pseudogenes
Besides point differences in amino acid composition,
another evolutionary mechanism for generating protein
diversity is the introduction of point or frameshift mutations to generate pseudogenes that are subsequently
eroded and eliminated by small deletions events [35]. We
used the Psi-Phi program to identify pseudogenes in Bp
and Bt [36], and found 170 (129 on Chr1 and 41 on
Chr2) pseudogenes in Bp and 179 pseudogenes (82 on
Chr1 and 97 on Chr2) in Bt. Of the 170 Bp pseudogenes,
44 were previously identified in the original Bp genome
annotation [15], which also reported an additional 81
other pseudogenes. These 81 genes lack clear homologs in
Bt, and were thus not detected by Psi-Phi, which requires
a comparative genomic metric for pseudogene identification. A complete list of these genes is provided in the
Additional file 1 (supplementary table six). To better
understand the molecular events responsible for these
pseudogenes, we grouped the Bp and Bt pseudogenes by
their functional inactivation categories, ranging from
nonsense mutations, frameshifts, IS insertions, to other
insertions or deletions, and truncations (Figure 7). In this
analysis, "frameshifts" were classified as very small insertions or deletions (typically only 1 or 2 nt in length),
"other insertions" were >10 bp in length, and "truncations" included large deletions at either or both the beginning and end of an ORF. Interestingly, when we
considered all recognized pseudogenes including those
previously annotated and those newly identified, the Bp
and Bt genomes were found to display remarkably different mutational spectra. Specifically, internal stop codons
due to nonsense mutations were the most usual disruption (~74%) in the Bt genome, followed by truncations
(~21%) and frameshifts (~3%). In contrast, a large proportion of the Bp pseudogenes resulted from truncations
(~51%), followed by nonsense mutations (~26%) and
frameshifts (~17%). In both species, only a few pseudogenes corresponded to IS element insertions.

Around one third of the pseudogenes in both species corresponded to hypothetical proteins and/or proteins of
unknown function. However, among the annotated pseu-

dogenes in the Bt genome, there was a distinct non-random functional trend for proteins exhibiting such
inactivation events, as they largely involved membraneassociated and exported proteins (26 Bt pseugodgenes, p
< 0.001 by Fisher's Test). This bias may reflect the results
of strong selective pressures in the natural environments
directly contacted by these bacteria. Intriguingly, in the Bp
genome, one frequently involved class of proteins that
were subject to inactivation events were genes involved in
transcription (21 from Bp; p < 0.001), which could lead to
differences in activating upstream stimuli and the selection of target genes. This result suggests that certain
aspects of Bp-specific behavior may result from alterations
in gene expression, in addition to the other large-scale and
protein differences previously discussed.
Comparison of Bp and Bt intergenic regions
Finally, our finding that a number of transcriptional regulators might be targeted for inactivation in Bp made us
also investigate the extent to which the transcriptional regulation machinery in Bp and Bt might be similar or different. As a surrogate for gene expression information, we
compared intergenic regions of the orthologous protein
pairs, which are likely to contain important cis-acting promoter elements and motifs for transcriptional regulator
docking and activity. Using a working criterion that an
intergenic region should be greater than 30 bp and lie
between two distinct ORFs, we identified 1191 (~58%)
orthologous intergenic regions in Chromosome 1 and
634 (~49%) in Chromosome 2 for further analysis. When
assessed at a global level, the intergenic regions of Bp and
Bt appear to be similar, in terms of average sequence identity (93% for integenic pairs in both chromosomes),
mean lengths, and size ranges (p > 0.05). The high levels

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/46

of similarity between the intergenic regions could mean
that either the transcriptional regulatory machineries of
Bp and Bt are highly similar, or that insufficient time has
passed for conserved promoter motifs to emerge against
the background mutation rate. To test the genomes for
any evidence of increased conservation in the intergenic
regions, we asked if there was any relationship between
the extent of protein similarities between homologs and
the degree of sequence conservation in their 5' intergenic
regions. Comparing the orthologous gene pairs, we identified a weak but significant positive correlation between
protein similarity and adjacent 5' intergenic sequences for
genes associated with core metabolism (r = 0.134, P <
0.01, Spearman's correlation coefficient). This bias
became stronger particularly for Chromosome 1 when it
was treated as separate from Chromosome 2 (r = 0.147, P
< 0.0001 for Chromosome 1; r = 0.084, P < 0.05 for Chromosome 2, Spearman's correlation coefficient). In addition, the percentage similarity for promoters of core genes
was significantly higher compared to the genome average
(p < 0.001, Figure 6b). The finding that orthologs
involved in core metabolism already tend to have more
conserved 5' intergenic region suggests that some degree
of selection in the integenic regions has already taken
place. In contrast, for the virulence genes, such a relationship was not observed (p > 0.05). Thus, for genes that are
present in both species, the high levels of similarity
between their intergenic regions suggest that the cis-acting
promoter elements of Bp and Bt, are likely to be broadly
similar.

Discussion
Genomic comparisons between pathogens and related
nonpathogenic relatives have played an important role in
identifying the mechanisms responsible for acquisition of
virulence in the natural environment [3,36-39]. Through
these analyses, a general picture is now emerging where
different pathogens appear to have employed slightly different evolutionary mechanisms to develop virulence. For
example, genomic comparisons between pathogenic and
laboratory strains of E. coli have revealed evidence of a
common core chromosome interrupted by the horizontal
introduction of multiple segments of virulence related
genes (pathogenicity islands) [37,40]. In contrast, the loss
of ancestral genomic DNA may play an important role for
generating virulence in Listeria and Bordetella species
[38,41]. In the case of Yersinia pestis, it has also been proposed that extensive chromosomal rearrangements and
massive gene inactivation can also act as a driving force for
pathogen evolution [5].
In the case of Bp, our comparative analysis indicates gene
mutation, gene deletion, and gene acquisition are likely to
represent the major evolutionary drivers of Bp virulence,
and that other proposed mechanisms of pathogen evolu-

tion, including chromosomal rearragement and bacteriophage-mediated recombination [5,40] may thus a less
relevant role in the pathogenic evolution of Bp. Our
results are broadly consistent and support the findings of
a previous study where genes found to be transcriptionally
regulated in B. mallei upon infection were compared to
their counterparts in Bp and Bt [13]. In that study, the
investigators found that the three organisms all possessed
the same genome structure of two chromosomes and high
levels of conserved nucleotide identity. However, downregulated genes, which were related to cell growth, were
more well conserved while up-regulated potential virulence encoding genes were less well conserved or absent in
Bt. Besides confirming these findings on a genome-wide
scale, our study also possesses a number of novel features.
Specifically, these include I) the discovery and validation
of GIs in the Bt genome as genomic elements of lateral
transfer, II) that unlike B. mallei, the Bp and Bt genomes
are highly syntenic, III) the increased divergence of virulence genes, especially those associated with Type III secretion, between Bp and Bt, IV) functional biases in
inactivated genes for membrane-associated proteins in Bt
and transcription factors in Bp, V) effects of species-specific genes on metabolism and virulence, and VI) evidence
that the cis-transcriptional regulatory machineries of Bp
and Bt are likely to be broadly similar.
To develop as a successful pathogen, virulent bacteria
need to evolve both offensive (eg. adherence, invasion,
toxin, secretion systems) and defensive pathways (eg.
antiphagocytosis, anti-proteolysis, phase variation, serum
resistance). Bp and Bt share a large proportion of both
offensive and defensive virulence factors (~71%), including adhesion factors, type IV pili, and two Type III secretion systems (TTS2 and TTS3). However, when treated
collectively, these virulence genes appear to be significantly more divergent between Bp and Bt compared to the
core metabolic genes or the rest of the genome. In contrast
to this proteomic comparison, our analysis of the promoters of these genes failed to demonstrate an increased rate
of divergence in cis-acting loci that might affect the transcriptional regulation of these genes. This result is unlikely
to be caused by a lack of sensitivity in our comparison, as
we were able to detect a significantly increased rate of conservation in the promoters of genes associated with core
metabolism. Thus, at present, we favor the possibility that
the cis-acting loci responsible for the regulation of these
genes are likely to be fairly similar between Bp and Bt.
However, we note that a different scenario may pertain to
the trans-acting loci, since a significant enrichment of transcription factors appear to have been mutationally inactivated or altered in Bp. A close comparison of the
transcriptomes of Bp and Bt, which is currently underway
in our laboratory, should prove valuable in addressing
this issue.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/46

Our results also support key roles for large-scale gene loss,
acqusition, and replacement in the development of Bp virulence. For example, both Bp and Bt share the TTS3 Type
III secretion system, which is required for the full virulence of Bp in a hamster model of infection [42]. However, it has been recently shown that arabinose exposure
may downregulate TTS3 expression and activity [25]. The
absence of an arabinose assimilation operon in Bp might
thus have contributed to the increased virulence of this
species. Besides gene deletion, several gene clusters related
to fimbriae and capsular polysaccharides synthesis have
also been horizontally transferred to Bp, potentially contributing to the variation of surface components between
the two organisms. It has long been recognized that bacterial surface components can play an indispensable role
in the pathogenesis of infectious disease, and surface components of Bp may serve as virulence factors by playing a
role in the attachment of bacteria to the host cell surface
[43,44]. One striking result from our analysis was our discovery that the polysaccharide capsule gene cluster, which
has been shown to be an essential virulence determinant
[29], is likely to be non-randomly transferred into the Bp
genome by replacing a pre-existing gene cluster in Bt
already dedicated to polysaccharide synthesis. Polysaccharide coats play an important role in bacterial survival
and persistence in the environment and evasion of host
immune response, but may not constitute offensive
attack. The fact that Bp has higher invasion, adherence
capacity, and resistance to phagocytosis are thought to be
related to the ability of Bp to produce exopolysaccharides
[28,45].
We conclude this report by noting that B. pseudomallei is
listed as a category B agent on the Centers for Disease
Control Bioterrorism Agents/Diseases list [9], and experimental manipulation of Bp is mandated by law in several
countries to be conducted under biosafety level 3 (BSL3)
laboratory requirements. As many centers in Bp-endemic
areas do not have BSL3 facilities, this requirement has
somewhat hampered the progress of research in basic Bp
biology. By contrast, Bt is considered a risk group 1 agent,
and although not considered clinically significant, Bt has
been shown to be lethal to the model system C. elegans
[46]. Thus, although it is undoubtedly essential to be cautious when extrapolating findings from one species to
another, the high degree of similarity between the Bt and
Bp genomes raises the possibility that Bt could be used as
a model system for studying certain aspects of Bp biology,
similar to B. cereus and B. anthracis. The availability of an
easily tractable experimental organism, which can be
manipulated under standard laboratory conditions, could
thus prove useful in accelerating research in the pathogenesis of melioidosis.

Conclusion
A comparative genomic analysis of Btto Bp has revealed
that their molecular inventories are highly similar, in
terms of genome structure, gene order, and functional
content. Bt contains at least fifteen genomic islands that
are variably present across different Bt isolates, whichmay
contribute to the presence of different strain-specific phenotypes. Our results suggest that a limited number of horizontal-acquisition events, coupled with the fine-scale
functional modulation of existing proteins, are likely to
be the major drivers underlying Bp virulence. The extensive genomic similarity between Bp and Bt suggests that,
in some cases, Bt could be used as a possible model system for studying certain aspects of Bp behavior.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
16S ribosomal sequences for Burkholderia (B. pseudomallei
K96243, B. thailandensis E264, B. mallei ATCC23343 and
B. cepacia J2315), and other spp. (Pseudomonas. aeruginosa
LMG1242T, Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2) were aligned and compared using MEGA version 3.0 software [47]. Sequence divergence rates were
calculated using a neighbor joining algorithm and a bootstrap value of 2000. P. aeruginosa LMG1242T was used as
an outlier subgroup.
Bacterial strains and genome sequencing
Two independent cultures of B. thailandensis E264,
derived from the same original isolate but stored at independent centers (DMERI and USAMRIID), were processed
for genomic DNA extraction and whole-genome shotgun
(WGS) sequencing at separate facilities (The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) and the Broad Institute (BI)).
At TIGR, sequencing and assembly followed by genome
closure was performed as described in Nierman et al. [17].
Identification of B. thailandensis coding sequences (CDs)
was performed using GLIMMER (48) with modifications
described in Nierman et al. [17]. The BI sequencing
approach is highly similar and described in the Main Text
and Additional file 4. Our comparative genomic analysis
is primarily based on the TIGR E264 genome after incorporating corrections for specific sequencing errors. The
TIGR Bt E264 genome sequence has been assigned GenBank accession no. CP000086 and CP0000865. The
Whole Genome Shotgun project described in this paper
has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the
project accession AACX00000000. The version described
in this paper is the first version, AACX01000000.
Genome alignments and comparative genomics
The genome sequence of virulent B. pseudomallei K96243
was obtained from NCBI [15]. Syntenic regions between
the B. thailandensis (Bt) and B. pseudomallei (Bp) genomes
were identified and aligned using MUMMER [49], and vis-

ualized using the ARGO Genome Browser [50] (Broad
Institute, MIT). Protein homologs between the two species were identified using BLASTP at an E-value threshold
of < 10-10 with subsequent confirmation by reciprocal
blast. The BLASTP output was also manually curated to
generate the final list of orthologous gene pairs between
the two species. Pathway comparisons were performed by
interrogating the Bp and Bt genomes against the KEGG
metabolic database. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the difference between proportions of functional
enrichment. Rates of nucleotide substitution in CDs were
calculated by aligning the nucleotide sequences of orthologous gene pairs by Clustalw [51] and determining the
number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and the number of nonsynonymous
nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) by
a maximum-likelihood method [52] in PAML [53]. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Inc., Calif.).
Intergenic sequences of orthologous gene pairs, defined as
the non-coding sequence between the translational start
or stop of two successive genes, that were greater than 30
nucleotides between two species were compared by
BLASTN. Two-sample t-tests (for normal distributions)
and Mann-Whitney tests (for non-normal distributions)
were used to determine the difference between means of
different populations.
Experimental validation of genomic islands
The presence of absence of 15 GIs was assessed across 29
Bt isolates using PCR. The 29 isolates were collected from
independent soil locations in two major areas: Northeast
Thailand (21 isolates) and Central Thailand (8 isolates).
One target gene and one flanking gene were selected for
each genomic island based on Bt E264 sequence data. The
target genes chosen were predominantly hypothetical
conserved proteins; and genes such as integrases and bacteriophage were avoided. The flanking genes were the
genes immediately abutting each putative island. The PCR
primers and cycling conditions (supplementary table
seven in Additional file 1) for the target and flanking
genes were optimized using Bt E264 genomic DNA. PCR
amplifications were performed with a PTC-0220 DNA
engine (MJ Research, Cambridge, MA) with Platinum Taq
polymerase (Invitrogen), and aliquots of reaction mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
SUPERFAMILY assignment
SUPERFAMILY (release 1.69) is a library of HMM models
based on SCOP and contains 1539 known structural
superfamilies [33]. The HMM based assignment tool provides structural assignments to protein sequences at the
super-family level using known structural information.
SUPERFAMILY was run to assign structural superfamilies

and domains for Bt and Bp protein sequences in HMMER
mode.
Identifying pseudogenes in Bp and Bt
To identify pseudogenes, we first used protein sequences
of Bp (or Bt) genome to query the nucleotide sequence of
the Bt (or Bp) genome using TBLASTN. We then applied
the Psi-Phi program suite [36] on the BLAST outputs to
recover candidate pseudogenes in each genome. Briefly,
Psi-Phi is designed to identify pseudogenes by a comparative analysis of related genomes, and retrieves pseudogenes resulting from nonsense mutations, frameshifts
generated by small insertions or deletions, large insertions
(such as those resulting from transposable elements), and
truncations of any specified length as well as any incorrectly annotated spacers resulting from gene degradation
[36]. Since Bp and Bt are closely related, a stringent cutoff
of E-value < 10-15 and a minimal percentage of protein
identity of 79% was used to identity pseudogenes. The
candidate pseudogenes were manually curated, and the
disrupting mutations determined by aligning the nucleotide sequences of putative pseudogenes with their functional counterparts using CLUSTALW 1.8 [51]. The IS
elements were searched by blasting genome sequences
against the IS nucleotide database [54].
