Abstract
Background: In this study, we addressed whether a single 454 Life Science GS20 sequencing run
provides new gene discovery from a normalized cDNA library, and whether the short reads
produced via this technology are of value in gene structure annotation.
Results: A single 454 GS20 sequencing run on adapter-ligated cDNA, from a normalized cDNA
library, generated 292,465 reads that were reduced to 252,384 reads with an average read length
of 92 nucleotides after cleaning. After clustering and assembly, a total of 184,599 unique sequences
were generated containing over 400 SSRs. The 454 sequences generated hits to more genes than
a comparable amount of sequence from MtGI. Although short, the 454 reads are of sufficient length
to map to a unique genome location as effectively as longer ESTs produced by conventional
sequencing. Functional interpretation of the sequences was carried out by Gene Ontology
assignments from matches to Arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of GO categories.
53,796 assemblies and singletons (29%) had no match in the existing MtGI. Within the previously
unobserved Medicago transcripts, thousands had matches in a comprehensive protein database and
one or more of the TIGR Plant Gene Indices. Approximately 20% of these novel sequences could
be found in the Medicago genome sequence. A total of 70,026 reads generated by the 454
technology were mapped to 785 Medicago finished BACs using PASA and over 1,000 gene models
required modification. In parallel to 454 sequencing, 4,445 5'-prime reads were generated by
conventional sequencing using the same library and from the assembled sequences it was shown to
contain about 52% full length cDNAs encoding proteins from 50 to over 500 amino acids in length.
Conclusion: Due to the large number of reads afforded by the 454 DNA sequencing technology,
it is effective in revealing the expression of transcripts from a broad range of GO categories and
contains many rare transcripts in normalized cDNA libraries, although only a limited portion of
their sequence is uncovered. As with longer ESTs, 454 reads can be mapped uniquely onto genomic
sequence to provide support for, and modifications of, gene predictions.

Background
In genome projects such as the Medicago Sequencing Initiative [1], Expressed Sequenced Tags are of great value for
genome annotation because they provide evidence of
expression of predicted genes, and by spliced alignment to
genomic DNA, they can provide support for gene structures. In instances where genome sequence is not available, EST sequencing provides a first catalog of a species'
gene inventory. Combinations of library normalization
and deep sequencing are used to maximize gene discovery. Here, we examine whether the deep sequencing made
cost-effective by pyrosequencing technology leads to significant new gene discovery in a normalized cDNA
library, and whether the short reads produced are of value
in gene structure annotation and SSR identification.
454 Life Sciences Corporation, Branford, CT, has developed the first DNA pyrosequencing platform to employ
picoliter volumes in a highly multiplexed, flow-through
array capable of producing 20–40 million bases per run.
Sequencing is performed on randomly fragmented DNA
using microbead-based pyrosequencing chemistry. This
technology enables sequence data generation for large
genome organisms that was previously inaccessible with
conventional sequencing platforms because of prohibitive cost and throughput limitations [2]. The usefulness of
454-derived sequences was assessed with the specific goal
of identifying new genes and improving gene predictions.
ESTs, are single-pass and partial sequences from cDNA
clones that provide a rapid and cost-effective method to
analyze transcribed portions of the genome while avoiding the non coding and repetitive DNA that can make up
much of the genome of some crop plants. EST sequencing
has been shown to accelerate gene discovery including
gene family identification [3], large-scale expression analysis [4,5], establishing phylogenetic relationships [6],
developing PCR based molecular markers [7], and identifying simple sequence repeats [8] and single nucleotide
polymorphisms [9,10]. In both of the finished plant
genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa,
expressed sequences (ESTs and cDNAs) have been invaluable [11,12] in defining the correct components of gene
structure, with spliced alignments of transcript sequences
resolving partial or complete exons, splice sites, and in the
case of full-length cDNAs, complete gene structures. EST
assemblies generated using PASA (Program to Assemble
Spliced Alignments) were shown to allow the automated
modeling of novel genes and more than 1,000 alternative
splicing variations, as well as updates (including UTR
annotations) to nearly half of the ~27,000 annotated protein coding genes in the Arabidopsis genome [11]. Since
experimental biologists are more interested in the reliability of individual predictions than in the average performance of gene predictions, it is important to have an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/272

extensive EST collection to guarantee the quality of individual gene models. Although large numbers of ESTs have
been generated for many species including barley, rice,
maize, sorghum, soybean, Medicago and wheat, characterizations of the transcriptomes of these species are likely far
from complete.
Here, we examine whether the deep sequencing made
cost-effective by the 454 technology leads to significant
new gene discovery in a cDNA library by comparisons
with The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Medicago
truncatula Gene Index (MtGI) containing 226,923 highquality ESTs [13]. We also investigate whether the short
reads produced are of value in gene structure annotation
by comparisons to high quality automated gene prediction generated by the International Medicago Genome
Annotation Group (IMGAG) [14].

Results and discussion
The overall objective of this study was to determine if the
454 technology leads to significant new gene/transcript
discovery in a cDNA library, and whether the short reads
produced by this technology are of value in gene structure
annotation.
Library normalization, 454 derived cDNA sequences,
assembly, functional annotation, SSRs and new transcripts/genes discovery will be discussed first, followed by
an analysis of genome mapping to determine their ability
to validate and update gene structures.
cDNA library production

An adapter-ligated normalized cDNA population was
generated from RNA pooled from four aerial plant tissues
(flowers, early seed, late seed, and stems) of M. truncatula
as described in Materials and Methods. This cDNA (size
range 800–2,000 nucleotides) was used to construct both
a plasmid library and the 454 library used for 454
sequencing. In order to address the number of full length
cDNAs generated from the SMART technology, conventional sequencing was carried out and analyzed. A total of
4,445 5' end reads from conventional sequencing were
generated that assembled into 3,619 unique sequences.
Of these, 1,916 (~50%) assembled sequences have a protein hit that contains the corresponding start codon and
are thus potentially full-length. The top protein matches
range between 50 to over 500 amino acids in length and
would thus indicate that the predicted open reading frame
generated from this library did not have any bias towards
long or short protein sequences (Table 1). Approximately
30% of these full length cDNAs do not have a full-length
counterpart in the current MtGI.

454 sequencing
A single 454 run on this sample generated 292,465 reads
with an average length of 99 nucleotides and a total length
of 29 Mb. In the previous section, conventional sequencing of the plasmid-based library was discussed with reference to the percentage of full length cDNAs. The
remainder of the analysis in this manuscript will focus on
454 sequencing of the normalized (but un-cloned) cDNA
population. Conventional sequencing on the plasmid
library was performed using a plasmid-located primer
close to the 5' end of the cloned cDNA and thus represents
the 5' ends of the cDNA population generated by reverse
transcription and second strand cDNA synthesis. By contrast, the 454 library preparation involves random shearing of the normalized but un-cloned cDNA population,
fragment end polishing, adaptor ligation, library immobilization, fill-in reaction, single stranded DNA library isolation and pyrosequencing [2]. The 454 reads therefore
originate from random locations within each cDNA and
may have either orientation. However because the original cDNA preparation involved the use of directional
adapters that were subsequently used for cloning, we can
also recognize the 454 reads that originate from the 5' and
3' ends of the cDNA population by the presence of different adapter sequences and, in the case of the 3' end, also
by polyA tracts (both adapter and polyA tracts were
removed from the 454 reads before assembly). Searching
for the directional adapters resulted in 41,877 reads containing the 5'end adaptor while 50,594 reads either contained the 3'end adaptor or a poly A/T tail. In addition the
complete set of reads had matches to over 50% of the Arabidopsis proteome. The presence of adapter sequences,
poly A tracts and hits to the Arabidopsis proteome indicates that the 454 sequences represents both good coverage both of the ends (presumably UTRs) and within the
protein open reading frames.
454 cDNA sequence assemblies
Cleaning (removal of adapter, polyA tail, etc) of these
sequences resulted in a total of 252,384 high quality reads
with an average length of 92 nucleotides totaling 23 Mb.
After clustering and assembly using TGICL clustering utilities [15], 101,650 sequence reads were incorporated into
33,865 assemblies leaving 150,734 singletons for a total
of 184,599 unique sequences. Most assemblies are short
(Table 2) and contain few component reads (Table 3).
This is presumably due to both the length of the individual reads and the low coverage of the transcriptome repre-

241

sented in this dataset. Based on the current MtGI, the
transcriptome space was estimated as follows: ~40,000
sequences of approximately 2,000 nucleotides equates to
80 Mb of unique M. truncatula expressed sequence. The 23
Mb of 454 cDNA sequence analyzed in this study represents only 0.28 times coverage of the transcriptome space,
and therefore any attempt at clustering and assembly will
not generate high levels of overlapping reads. In order to
address the effectiveness of normalization of the library, a
comparison was made between the top five most abundant transcripts from the MtGI and the 454 derived
sequences. Representation of the most abundant transcripts was 25 to 50 fold reduced in the normalized cDNA
population as compared to the collection of ESTs in MtGI,
the vast majority of which are derived from non-normalized libraries (Table 4).
Uniqueness of 454 sequences
Many plant genomes have a high proportion of repetitive
sequences, and many multi-gene families. Short reads
from recent duplications might not be distinguishable. In
order to address this, 454 derived sequences were compared to the MtGI with regard to their ability to map to a
single location on the genome. Using a threshold of 95%
identity plus 95% coverage, 70% of the 454 unique
sequences could be mapped to a unique location. Similarly, 70% of the MtGI sequences could be mapped to a
unique location using the same threshold of 95% identity
plus 95% coverage. This demonstrates that although
short, 454 reads can be mapped to the Medicago Genome,
with the same confidence as longer ESTs.

Functional annotation
Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary of functional terms that allows coherent annotation of gene
products. In order to assign putative functional roles to
the Medicago sequences, we used the GO assignments of
the Arabidopsis proteome [16]. The Medicago 454 and the
MtGI derived unique sequences were compared with the
Arabidopsis proteome using BlastX (Figure 1). Top protein
matches from 12,480 Arabidopsis genes was assigned to
each of 43,360 Medicago 454 sequences. Both the MtGI
and 454 sequences were plotted side by side and in both
cases, the genes cover a broad range of GO categories.
Striking differences can be seen within the molecular
function of 'response to abiotic or biotic stimulus' and
'biological process unknown as a function'. However this
is not surprising since a large percentage of the libraries
that were used in the MtGI were generated under abiotic
or biotic stress.
Comparison between 23 Mb of 454 cDNA sequence with
23 Mb of randomly selected EST sequence
In an attempt to compare EST sequence from conventional sequencing and pyrosequencing, we randomly
sampled approximately 23 Mb of DNA sequence from the
available Medicago ESTs in Genbank. Using the same conditions to assemble the 454 cDNA reads and repeating the
following analysis three times generates similar results as
follows. Cleaning (removal of adapter, polyA tail, etc) of
these sequences resulted in a total of 43,985 reads with an

average length of 532 nucleotides. After clustering and
assembly using TGICL clustering utilities [15], 6,332
assemblies were generated leaving 12,057 singletons for a
total of 18,389, unique sequences (Table 5). Not surprisingly, the individual EST reads, and assemblies generated
were longer on average and had higher coverage per
assembly when comparisons were made with 454 cDNA
reads and assemblies (Table 6). Despite the much smaller
number of reads, the longer EST length of the individual
reads increased the chance of forming contigs and
increased the number of reads per assembly. Strictly
speaking, an ideal comparison would be to sample EST
reads out of the same library from which the 454 cDNA
reads were sequenced, however, no similar libraries are
publicly available for M. truncatula because they were not
normalized in the same way.
Identification of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) Within
454 cDNA sequence assemblies
A total of 401 unique 454 cDNA sequences contained a
SSR. Among the SSRs, 143 are trinucleotides, followed by
dinucleotides (132), mononucleotides (56) tetranucleotides (47), pentanucleotides (23), and hexanucleotides
(8). AG/CT (127) is the most frequent repeat motif, followed by AAG/CTT (86). Among the ESTs without a MtGI
hit; 104 sequences contained a SSR. Among these SSRs, 41
are dinucleotides, followed by trinucleotides (30), mononucleotides (10) tetranucleotides (10) and pentanucleotides (10). Randomly selected ESTs from the previous
section generated 121 more sequences containing SSRs,
three times more sequences with more than one SSR (25)
and twice as many SSRs in compound formation. (19)
probably due to the longer read and contig lengths.
Comparison of 454 cDNA aequence assemblies to the
TIGR Medicago gene index and characterization of novel
transcripts
The 454 cDNA assemblies and singletons were searched
against the TIGR MtGI, containing 226,923 high-quality
ESTs [13]. Approximately 70% of the 454 unique
sequences had a blat or a blastn hit to 21,064 MtGI
sequences (Expected value cut off 1e-10). From the
53,796 assemblies and singletons (~29%) that had no
match in MtGI 3,960 had matches in a comprehensive
protein database using blastx (due to the short sequence

length, an Expected value cut off 1e-2 was used) and
~2,000 sequences had a blat match to one or more of 27
other TIGR plant gene indices (Figure 2). The ~2,000 reads
with matches to TIGR Gene Indices could be condensed
into 748 clusters based on their single best match to different parts of the same or orthologous TCs and likely represent this number of previously unobserved Medicago
transcripts. Similarly, 3,960 sequences that had matches
in the comprehensive TIGR protein database could be
condensed into 3,144 clusters based on their top protein
matches.
To more clearly demonstrate that the 454 technology
could discover new genes by deep sequencing, a comparison was made between the EST sequencing coverage ver-

sus the annotated genes of Medicago and Lotus that are
discovered. Figure 3 shows that 454 derived ESTs contain
many more gene hits for a given amount of EST sequence
coverage when compared to the MtGI. Twice as many
gene hits are found up to 750,000 bp of EST sequence coverage and thereafter the rate of gene hits slows but is
always found to be substantially higher than the MtGI.
Thus 454 sequencing has revealed many transcripts not
previously detected in Medicago, some of which have
matches in protein or EST databases. This supports the
idea that deeper EST sequencing using 454 technology
will identify a larger number of expressed sequences than
conventional EST sequencing and is effective in revealing
the expression of many rare transcripts.

Mapping novel sequences to Medicago genomic DNA
Of the 53,796 sequences not found in MtGI, 13,260 and
9,362 could be mapped using blat with a threshold of
90% identity and 90% coverage and 95% identity and
95% coverage, respectively, to all available M. truncatula
genome sequence in Genbank (1 April 2006). These transcripts had low levels of repeats sequences [17] and are
unlikely to represent sequencing errors, since alignments
on the genome using lower thresholds, 60% identity and
60% coverage generated only a 10% increase in matches.
At this point, it is estimated that ~50–60% of the Medicago
euchromatic gene space has been sequenced. Thus the 454
sequences without matches to genomic DNA may be
derived from transcripts from the as yet unsequenced
euchromatin, from expressed genes residing in the 200+
Mb of heterochromatin or from contaminating nucleic
acid e.g. plant bacteria or fungi, although there is no evidence for this last possibility. Thus it is likely that a large
fraction of the novel sequences will be useful for gene
structure or expression validation in the remainder of the
Medicago euchromatin or as an indication of the presence
of expressed genes in the heterochromatin.

Use of 454 cDNA reads to support annotation and define
exon-intron boundaries
The Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA) was
developed to cluster expressed sequences on genomic
DNA using Blat, Sim4 and GeneSeqer and to generate
spliced alignments to validate and update gene structures
[11]. The gene structure updates provided by alignment
assemblies are classified into several distinct categories:
UTR extension, gene model incorporation without modification, CDS extension, gene model merging and gene
isoform creation (Figure 4).

From the 252,384 sequence reads, a total of 70,026 were
mapped to 785 M. truncatula GenBank HTGS phase 3
high quality sequence BACs (Table 7), producing 13,933
PASA assemblies. These assemblies were incorporated
into 5,124 existing IMGAG gene models. A total of 1,141
assemblies extend 1,061 UTRs, and 278 assemblies alter
the protein sequence of 278 genes. Twenty gene models
could be merged to produce 10 new genes, and 39 gene
model isoforms could be created from PASA assemblies
(Table 8). A total of 3,712 PASA assemblies had a [GT,
GC]/AG consensus donor/acceptor splice sites at intron
boundaries and a near-complete, near-perfect alignment
requiring at least 90% of the sequencealigned with at least
95% sequence identity. Introns generated from 454 PASA
assemblies of length greater than a generous 2 Kb were
excluded, effectively eliminating alignments with false terminal extensionswhich otherwise appear to be high quality alignments.
To determine whether the novel transcripts which lack a
MtGI match were useful in Medicago gene structure annotation, the 53,796 sequences consisting of assemblies plus
singletons that had no match in the existing MtGI were
mapped to 785 M. truncatula Phase 3 BACs using PASA.
From the 10,360 sequences that aligned, 3,221 PASA
assemblies were generated and incorporated into 2,186
existing IMGAG gene models. An additional 439 assemblies extend the UTRs of 429 genes and 127 assemblies
altered the protein sequence of 127 gene prediction. Five
gene models were capable of merging with five other gene
models and eight gene model isoforms could be created.
A total of 553 of these PASA assemblies conformed to the
[GT, GC]/AG consensus donor/acceptor splice sites.
Thus, as with longer ESTs, 454-generated sequences
derived from both known and novel transcripts in a cDNA
library can be mapped onto genomic sequence and provide valid spliced alignments to provide support for and
modifications of gene predictions providing gene structure updates and defining exon-intron boundaries.

Conclusion
In this study, two major ideas were examined: whether the
deep sequencing made cost-effective by the 454 technology leads to significant new gene discovery in a cDNA
library, and whether the short reads produced by the 454
technology are of value in gene structure annotation.
Approximately 30% of the reads produced by a single 454
run were not found in the Medicago Gene Index derived
from over 220,000 ESTs from more than 30 libraries,
illustrating the power of the deep sequencing facilitated
by this technology to generate more gene hits, and reveal
rare and novel transcripts, albeit only a small portion of
each sequence. Although the read lengths are short, 70 %
of the reads were of sufficient length to map to unique
locations on the Medicago genome as with ESTs from the
MtGI via conventional sequencing. Functional annotation shows that the 454 sequences cover a broad range of
GO categories. In addition, 454 reads can be mapped
onto genomic sequence to provide support for and modifications of gene predictions. We expect that a similar

analysis using other plant species would work synergistically with existing EST data and identify new genes/transcripts and/or support a significant number of existing
gene models at a very cost effective and efficient manner.

Methods
cDNA library construction for conventional sequencing
and 454 sequencing
The normalized cDNA population and cDNA plasmid
library were constructed employing the Smart cloning
methodology [17,18] using the services of Evrogen [19]
and Sfi IA/B primers/adapters that permit directional
cloning. Reverse transcription was carried out on a pool of
RNA from three Medicago truncatula tissues (flowers, stems
early and late seed) The primer annealing mixture (5 µl)
containing 0.3 µg of total RNA; 10 pmol SMART-Sfi IA oligonucleotide
(5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCrGrGrG-3') and 10 pmol CDS -Sfi IB

(5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCGAGGCGGCCd(T)20–3') was heated at 72°C for 2

Reverse Transcriptase (BD Biosciences Clontech) in a final
volume of 10 µl, containing 1X First-Strand Buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3); 75 mM KCl; 6 mM MgCl2); 2 mM
DTT;1 mM of each dNTP, incubated at 42°C for 1.5 hr
and then cooled on ice. The first-strand cDNA was diluted
5 times with TE buffer, heated at 72°C for 7 min and used
for amplification by Long-Distance PCR in a 50 µl reaction containing 1 µl diluted first-strand cDNA, 1 × Advantage 2 reaction buffer (BD Biosciences Clontech), 200 µM
dNTPs, 0.3 µM SMART PCR primer (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3') and 1 × Advantage 2 Polymerize mix
(BD Biosciences Clontech). 18 PCR cycles were performed
using the following parameters: 95°C for 7 s; 65°C for 20
s; 72°C for 3 min. Amplified cDNA PCR product was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, CA),

concentrated by ethanol precipitation and adjusted to a
final concentration of 50 ng/µl. For cDNA normalization,
3 µl (about 150 ng) purified ds cDNA plus 1 µl 4× Hybridization Buffer (200 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 8.0; 2 M NaCl)
was overlaid with one drop of mineral oil, denatured
95°C for 5 min and then allowed to anneal at 68°C for 4
h. The following preheated reagents were added to the
hybridization reaction at 68°C: 3.5 ul milliQ water;1 µl of
5× DNAse buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mM

For 454 sequencing, approximately, 3 µg of the final normalized, adaptor-ligated cDNA population was sheared
via nebulization into small fragments a few hundred base
pairs in length. The fragment ends were made blunt and
short adaptors which provide the priming sequences for
both amplification and sequencing of the sample library
fragments were ligated onto both ends. These adaptors
also provide a sequencing key (a short sequence of four
nucleotides) which was used by the system software to
recognize legitimate library reads. Next, the library was
immobilized onto streptavidin beads, facilitated by a 5'
biotin tag on Adaptor B, and any nicks in the doublestranded library are repaired. Finally, the unbound strand
of each fragment (with 5'-Adaptor A) was released, and
the recovered single-stranded DNA library's quality is
assessed. Sequences are available for download [22].

Sequence analysis
454 cDNA reads were assembled using TIGR Gene Indices
clustering tools [14]. Clustering and assemblies from 454
cDNA reads for genome annotation comparisons was carried out using PASA [11].
Identification and analyses of simple sequence repeats
Perfect dinucleotide to hexanucleotide simple sequence
repeats were identified using the MISA [21] Perl scripts,
specifying a minimum of six dinucleotide and five tetranucleotide to hexanucleotide repeats and a maximum of
100-nucleotides interruption for compound repeats.
