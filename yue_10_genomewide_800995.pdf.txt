Genome-wide investigation reveals high
evolutionary rates in annual model plants

Abstract
Background: Rates of molecular evolution vary widely among species. While significant deviations from molecular
clock have been found in many taxa, effects of life histories on molecular evolution are not fully understood. In
plants, annual/perennial life history traits have long been suspected to influence the evolutionary rates at the
molecular level. To date, however, the number of genes investigated on this subject is limited and the conclusions
are mixed. To evaluate the possible heterogeneity in evolutionary rates between annual and perennial plants at the
genomic level, we investigated 85 nuclear housekeeping genes, 10 non-housekeeping families, and 34 chloroplast
genes using the genomic data from model plants including Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula for
annuals and grape (Vitis vinifera) and popular (Populus trichocarpa) for perennials.
Results: According to the cross-comparisons among the four species, 74-82% of the nuclear genes and 71-97% of
the chloroplast genes suggested higher rates of molecular evolution in the two annuals than those in the two
perennials. The significant heterogeneity in evolutionary rate between annuals and perennials was consistently
found both in nonsynonymous sites and synonymous sites. While a linear correlation of evolutionary rates in
orthologous genes between species was observed in nonsynonymous sites, the correlation was weak or invisible in
synonymous sites. This tendency was clearer in nuclear genes than in chloroplast genes, in which the overall
evolutionary rate was small. The slope of the regression line was consistently lower than unity, further confirming
the higher evolutionary rate in annuals at the genomic level.
Conclusions: The higher evolutionary rate in annuals than in perennials appears to be a universal phenomenon
both in nuclear and chloroplast genomes in the four dicot model plants we investigated. Therefore, such
heterogeneity in evolutionary rate should result from factors that have genome-wide influence, most likely those
associated with annual/perennial life history. Although we acknowledge current limitations of this kind of study,
mainly due to a small sample size available and a distant taxonomic relationship of the model organisms, our
results indicate that the genome-wide survey is a promising approach toward further understanding of the
mechanism determining the molecular evolutionary rate at the genomic level.

Background
Clarification of the pattern and dynamics of nucleotide
change in evolution is of fundamental importance for
understanding evolutionary mechanisms. One major
focus is the determination and evaluation of factors that
affect the evolutionary rate at the molecular level. While
molecular clock has been largely accepted as a null
hypothesis of molecular evolution, many possible influencing factors have been proposed and investigated

either in animals or in plants during these decades,
including changes in population size, protein dispensability, efficiency of DNA replication and repair systems,
metabolic rate, speciation rate, and generation time
[1-9].
Among these, life history traits are of particular interest. For example, generation time, referring to the time
to reach sexual maturity, has long been suspected as a
major factor that alters the molecular evolutionary rate
among species. In animals, several empirical studies suggested that rodents have a higher evolutionary tempo
than primates, indicating an inverse relationship
between evolutionary rate and generation time [5,6,10].

In plants, on the other hand, the role of life history in
molecular evolution is still under debate despite a
number of studies supporting its importance [7,11-13].
Whittle and Johnston [14] reported genetic comparisons
of the nuclear 18S ITS1 and ITS2 regions between
annual plants and perennial plants and found no evidence for the inverse relationship between evolutionary
rate and life span. Such a study raised a question against
the general applicability of the generation time effect on
molecular evolution of the plants. Moreover, considerable variations in breeding system, population size, speciation rate and gene-specific selective constraints
introduce further complications in addressing the connection between plants’ evolutionary rate and their
annual/perennial habits.
Notably, one critical problem in previous studies is the
limited DNA sequence data from different species and
particularly different gene loci sampled, due to historical
and technological reasons. Fortunately, the recent development of the DNA sequencing technology lends the
resources needed to further investigate this perplexing
topic based on far more sequence data than ever before.
For instance, an exemplary study carried by Smith and
Donoghue recently detected the much higher rates of
molecular change in annuals by sampling and sequencing multiple loci from many species representing the
five major branches within flowering plants [15].
Herein, we present our study on this topic from a
comparative genomic perspective. Recently the whole
genome sequences of many plants, ranging from moss
to flowering plants including annuals and perennials,
became available [16-19]. Such genomic information
from multiple species offers a great opportunity to
explore the heterogeneity in evolutionary rate between
annuals and perennials across a large set of gene loci at
the whole genome level. In this study, we investigate a
total of 441 kb-long genomic sequence including 85
nuclear housekeeping genes, 10 non-housekeeping gene
families and 34 chloroplast genes in four model species
of dicot plants (two annuals and two perennials, Additional file 1). They include Arabidopsis thaliana (At,
annual), Medicago truncatula (Mt, annual), Vitis vinifera
(Vv, perennial), and Populus trichocarpa (Pt, perennial).
A monocot species, Oryza sativa (Os), was used as an
outgroup. A relative measure of the evolutionary rates
of the orthologous genes between annuals and perennials enabled us to effectively disentangle the genomewide effect of plant life history trait on the evolutionary
rate from locus-specific effects of evolutionary forces
such as protein dispensability or selective constraints.
Our results provide a strong support for the association
between the annual/perennial life histories of plants and
the rate of molecular evolution at the genomic level.

Results
Phylogenetic Reconstruction

For phylogenetic reconstruction, 34 chloroplast genes
were concatenated to form a 31,752 bp-long sequence
data set. For nuclear genes, a data set containing 85
housekeeping genes with a total length of 79,866 bp was
used (Additional file 1 for the list of genes). Well-consistent branching order was observed in the phylogenetic
trees based on both datasets, although the bootstrap
support of the topology was only strong for nuclear
genes (Figure 1, see Methods for further details).
According to the phylogenetic trees, A. thaliana
diverged first after the split of monocots and dicots, and
the two perennial species, grape (V. vinifera) and poplar
(P. trichocarpa), diverged most recently. Long external
branches for all five species imply that they are distantly
related. In addition, the branch lengths were longer for
A. thaliana and M. truncatula compared with V. vinifera and P. trichocarpa in both phylogenetic trees. Thus,
higher evolutionary rate in annuals than in perennials,
in both nuclear genes and chloroplast genes, was supported in the studied species. Detailed results for each
type of genes are described in the following sections.
Nuclear Housekeeping Genes

Using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, we found
that 76.5-82.4% of the 85 nuclear housekeeping genes
had higher nucleotide substitution rates (d) in annuals
than in perennials in our annual-perennial pairwise
comparisons (Table 1). This pattern was consistent for
nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) and synonymous
substitution rates (dS) as well, with the higher-rate proportions of 62.4-74.1% (in dN) and 74.1-82.4% (in d S).
The predominant heterogeneity in evolutionary rate
between annual and perennial plants was statistically
supported by sign-test (Table 1). Paired t-test was then
performed to take into account the degree of annualperennial evolutionary rate shift across each locus and
allow quantitative statistic analysis. Again, the 12 crosscomparisons based on d, dN and dS showed significant
annual-perennial heterogeneity in evolutionary rates
(Table 2).
Next, we plotted evolutionary rate in annuals against
that in perennials (Figure 2). We also conducted regression analysis for d, dN and dS. Majority of the plots were
located below the diagonal line and the regression slope
was consistently lower than unity (0.44-0.86), confirming
the higher evolutionary rate in annuals than in perennials across multiple gene loci. Another interesting finding lies in the correlation of evolutionary rates between
annuals and perennials, which can be considered as a
measure of relative rate consistency across multiple
gene loci (Table 3). For M. truncatula, clear correlation

was detected consistently among d, dN and also dS. For
A. thaliana, on the other hand, such correlation could
be only found in d N , probably due to the saturation
effect of synonymous substitution at some gene loci.
Saturation of nucleotide substitutions can bias the estimate of evolutionary rate when evolutionary rate is high
and the lineages of comparison are distantly related.
Thus, the saturation effect explains the observation well,
considering the early split of A. thaliana (Figure 1) and
high nucleotide substitution rate at the synonymous
sites (as indicated by dS > 1 in Figure 2). Indeed, out of
the 85 gene loci, 34 (40%) showed dS >1 in the M. truncatula branch relative to those two perennials, whereas
63 genes (74%) showed dS >1 in A. thaliana. Although
all the results above are based on the estimation of
evolutionary rates using ML method, another (outgroup-dependant) method based on an assumption of
molecular clock also provided similar results (See Methods, Table S1-S3 in Additional file 1, Figure S1 and S2
in Additional file 2).

functions. A total of 111 orthologous gene clades were
sampled from the 10 gene families according to our
sampled criteria. Eventually four data sets were built for
further analysis on the gene families (one total dataset
and three sub-datasets, see Methods for detail).
The results from this analysis were largely consistent
with those from housekeeping genes above, in support
of heterogeneity in annual-perennial evolutionary rates
even in these gene families. Both sign-test and paired
t-test suggested significantly higher evolutionary rates in
these 10 gene families (Table 1, 2 and Additional file 1).
In the scatter plot for the evolutionary rates of annuals
vs. perennials, regression lines clearly deviated from the
diagonal line and inclined to the annual side (Figure 3
and Table 3, see also Additional files 1 and 2). Moreover, as we found in housekeeping genes, strong correlation between evolutionary rates in the annual-perennial
comparisons was detected in d N , whereas d and d S
showed weak or invisible correlation between A. thaliana and those two perennials in many cases (Table S9
in Additional file 1).

Non-housekeeping gene families

Housekeeping genes are often highly conserved. Many
non-housekeeping genes, on the other hand, often vary
in size and functional constraint across different species.
They also frequently experience duplication, recombination and diversifying selection, making their evolutionary
histories much more complex than those of housekeeping genes [20]. So, it is tempting to ask whether such
annual-perennial rate heterogeneity holds the same for
non-housekeeping gene families. To examine this, we
expanded our analysis to incorporate 10 non-housekeeping gene families with different sizes and diverse

Chloroplast genes

Previous studies indicated that nucleotide substitution
rates vary greatly among nuclear, mitochondrial, and
chloroplast genomes and that chloroplast genome evolve
much more slowly than nuclear genome in plants [7,21].
Consistent with these reports, our analysis based on
34 randomly sampled chloroplast genes showed a considerably lower evolutionary rate than that detected in
nuclear housekeeping genes and gene families (about
1/3 at nonsynonymous sites and 1/4 at synonymous
sites). Therefore, for each annual-perennial comparison,

method. Cases in all 4 annual-perennial cross-comparison are shown. The dotted line is the diagonal line with a slope equal to 1, and the red

the genetic divergence in chloroplast genomes tends to
be much smaller than in nuclear genomes (Figure 1).
Thus, we expected that chloroplast genes provide a better resolution in order to better estimate the evolutionary rates in these distantly related species.
Among the 34 chloroplast genes, 64.7-97.1% showed
higher evolutionary rates in annuals than in perennials
in our cross-comparisons (Table 1). The sign-test and
the paired t-test clearly showed heterogeneity in the
rates of molecular evolution between annuals and perennials (Table 1 and 2). Moreover, the regression slopes in
the scatter plots were smaller than unity (0.541-0.730)
between annuals and perennials in all the 12 comparison pairs (Figure 4 and Table 3). For chloroplast genes,
the correlation between annual-perennial evolutionary
rates in A. thaliana appeared to be still detectable after
synonymous substitutions were incorporated (R 2 =
0.358-0.531 for d) (Table 3). The overall range of dS in
the 34 chloroplast genes calculated for A. thaliana was
0-0.57 with an average of 0.27 (SD = 0.13), suggesting a
minimal saturation effect on the estimation of evolutionary rate in the chloroplast genes.

Discussion
Possible mechanisms for the higher evolutionary rate in
annuals

In this study, we examined a large number of gene loci
across both nuclear and chloroplast genomes in four
model plants. These genes encode proteins with diverse
functions in plants, including structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, and transcription factors. Therefore, they
represent genes with different functional constraints
well, and they can be used as a proxy for inferring the
situation across the whole plant genome. In nuclear
genomes, our survey on 85 nuclear housekeeping genes
and 10 gene families consistently revealed a generally
higher evolutionary rate in annuals than in perennials.
Similar pattern was found in chloroplast genomes in
this study, which is consistent with a previous study
based on two chloroplast genes [22]. In addition, consistent results have been reported at several loci in mitochondrial genes, e.g. in atpA, coxI, and some noncoding regions [12,23-25]. Altogether, the consistent
results from various genomes suggest a globally faster
evolutionary tempo at the molecular level for annuals

than for perennials across both nuclear and organelle
genomes.
Following this line of reasoning, such a global pattern
should be shaped by some organism-level factors which
influence both nuclear and organelle genomes. Generation-time might be one of such factors. Assuming that
mutations occur predominantly at cell division and that
the spontaneous meiotic and mitotic mutation rate per
cell cycle are the same for annual and perennial plants, the
observed difference in evolutionary rate should depend on
the frequency of cell division per unit time. Since annual
plants take a shorter time from germination to reach first
flowering than perennials, they might on average experience more frequent cell divisions per unit time prior to
reproduction. If this is true, a generally faster evolutionary
tempo in annuals than in perennials, as observed in our
results, is expected. Meanwhile, our results suggest that
the lifelong accumulated somatic mutations, mostly introduced by mitosis, have not offset the generation time
effect on annual-perennial evolutionary rate difference,
which is consistent with other studies [15].
While generation-time might at least partly account
for the evolutionary rate heterogeneity between annuals
and perennials, there are other possibilities to generate
the observed pattern. For example, the observed interspecific rate heterogeneity could also be attributed to
the difference in their effective population size (Ne)

[26]. Ne is an important factor that influences the balance among mutation, random genetic drift and natural
selection. As predicted by the Nearly Neutral Mutation
Model [9,27], smaller Ne leads to higher probability of
fixation of mutations by random genetic drift, and
hence higher evolutionary rate. In plants, there are
strong association between outcrossing rate and the perenniality of the species [28], and an annual species tend
to be a selfing species and has generally lower Ne compared with perennials [15,29-31]. And the observation of
strongly negative selection for inbreeding in perennial
plants further enforced the tendency of a genome-wide
lower evolutionary rate in perennials than in their
annual counterparts [32].
Different speciation rate may be also an alternative
explanation. It has been shown that perennials appear to
have slower speciation rates than annuals [33]. Thus, the
lower frequency of speciation events in perennials and
fewer corresponding opportunities for bottleneck and
adaptation events may result in lower evolutionary rates,
especially at nonsynonymous sites, compared with
annuals [4]. In addition, the slower metabolic rate and
fewer recombination events per unit time in perennials
might also result in the higher spontaneous mutation
rate per unit time in annuals [34]. Therefore, while the
difference in evolutionary tempo between annuals and
perennials seems to be quite pronounced, the biological
mechanism behind this phenomenon is still unclear.
Pronounced evolutionary rate correlation among species

Another interesting finding was clearly linear correlations of evolutionary rates at the nonsynonymous sites.
The square of correlation coefficient (R2) ranges from
0.280-0.593 in nuclear genome and 0.297-0.721 in chloroplast genome. Moreover, in contrast to the fast decay
of correlation at synonymous sites, the strong correlation at nonsynonymous sites held quite well even
between the highly diverged taxa. Therefore, it seems
that the relative evolutionary rate between two compared species was relatively constant across multiple
gene loci in plant genomes, showing an analogous
clock-behavior. This observation reminds us a classic
concept of molecular clock, which claims an approximately constant evolutionary rate over time for any
given protein or DNA sequence in all lineages [35].
Herein, the roughly constant relative rate of nonsynonymous substitutions among species at the genomic level
might provide a robust measure to calibrate the lineage
effect of the local molecular clock.
Exception genes against the global trend of higher
evolutionary rate in annuals

Nine nuclear housekeeping genes and one chloroplast
gene were identified due to their consistently higher rate

of molecular evolution in perennials rather than in
annuals in all four cross-comparisons, based on one or
more estimators (Table S10 in Additional file 1). Among
them, Transketolase, Prenylcysteine oxidase 1 and PsaC
are the most noticeable, showing consistently higher
rates of evolution in perennials among d, d N and d S .
Transketolase is an enzyme that participates in the
transfer of ketol groups and catalyzes three reactions in
the regenerative phase of the Calvin cycle [36]. It also
participates in non-oxidative branch of the pentose
phosphate pathway and Rubisco shunt. Prenylcysteine
oxidase 1 is involved in the farnesyl diphosphate metabolic process, and plays an important role in detoxification and recycling of farnesylcysteine [37]. In plant
chlorplast, PsaC is an important subunit of photosystem
I (PSI) which provides the ligands for the terminal electron acceptors, FA and FB [38,39]. Such pronounced disagreements with the global trend of faster evolution
tempo in annuals together with the critical biological
functions of these two genes hint the effect of selective
force at least at the species-specific level. It will be interesting to test whether such exceptions hold the same in
the annual-perennial comparisons of other species.

The limitations of this study

We acknowledge that the selected species in this study
were not ideal by two reasons. Firstly, their phylogenetic
relationships were too distant to avoid the saturation
effect (Figure 1, 2). This was inevitable for the genomic
survey due to the limited availability of genomic information at this moment, but comparisons between more
closely related pairs of annual and perennial species
would have provided a better resolution without suffering from the saturation effect. Sibling species comparisons have been used in plant biology in different
contexts (e.g., Gitzendanner and Soltis [40]) and proven
to be fruitful. Nevertheless, we believe that our conclusions on the heterogeneity of evolutionary rate between
annuals and perennials are valid because the lack of
resolution due to saturation effect generally makes the
results conservative. Secondly, our sample size (four species plus one outgroup) was restricted, and the comparisons were non-independent (two annuals by two
perennials). This is also inevitable at this moment, and
we should not over-generalize our conclusions to nonmodel species. Since more and more genomic information is becoming available, future studies on new

genomic data of additional close-related plants and deeper understanding of their life histories, including
annuals and perennials, will soon provide further knowledge about the generality and the mechanism of heterogeneous evolutionary rate between these species.

Conclusions
Four annual-perennial comparisons based on multiple
gene loci and the combination of nuclear and chloroplast genomes consistently suggested higher evolutionary rates in annual plants. Together with previous
studies, we propose that the difference in evolutionary
rate between annuals and perennials is a genome-wide
phenomenon in plants, thereby shaped by some genome-wide factors associated with their annual/perennial
life histories. Besides, it is noteworthy that nucleotide
substitution rate at nonsynonymous sites appears to
correlate well among compared species in our study,
implying a roughly constant relative rate of molecular
evolution across different gene loci. Finally, a few consistent exceptions of the global trends of faster evolution tempo in annuals were observed in all four crosscomparisons of our study, indicating noticeable effects

of natural selection in these gene loci. While we
acknowledge the methodological limitations of this
study based on a small number of distantly-related
model species, our results indicate that the genomewide comparison is a promising approach to further
understanding the mechanism determining the molecular evolutionary rate at the genomic level in plants.

Methods
Data sampling

Five different plant taxa were investigated in this study,
including four dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago
truncatula, Vitis vinifera, and Populus trichocarpa) and
one monocot (Oryza sativa). Their nuclear genome
sequences and annotation data were downloaded from
online databases; the detailed download websites and
the data version can be found in Table S11 (Additional
file 1). The corresponding chloroplast genomes data
were downloaded from Genbank. The evolutionary history of these five species was inferred based on multigene matrix as described below [41,42].
Eighty-five housekeeping genes were randomly
selected, based on the enzymes encoded by housekeeping

Yue et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/242

genes in A. thaliana [43] and very conserved genes
throughout plant evolution from moss to flowering
plants [44] (Table S12 in Additional file 1). 34 chloroplast
genes were randomly chosen according to two criteria: 1)
the gene is conserved across the five different plant species used in our study, 2) the length of the gene should
be >200 base pairs (bp) to give enough substitution information (Table S13 in Additional file 1). 10 non-housekeeping gene families with a wide spectrum of homolog
gene numbers and functional constraints were randomly
sampled according to the gene family list on TAIR and
Pfam database v23.0 (Table S14 in Additional file 1).
Amino acid sequences of the 85 nuclear housekeeping genes were first identified using BLASTP in each
plant genome. Then, the corresponding nucleotide
sequences of the CDS regions were obtained and
employed in further analysis. Both amino acid and
nucleotide coding sequences of the 34 chloroplast
genes in each of the five studied species were identified
according to Gramene.
For non-housekeeping gene families, both BLAST and
hidden Markov model (HMM) searches were performed
to identify the homologous genes of every gene family
in each species. Firstly, the amino acid consensus
sequence of the representative domain of each gene
family was retrieved from the Pfam database and was
adopted as the query in BLASTP searches for all possible homologs encoded in our sampled genomes. The
threshold of expectation value was set to 1.0, a value
determined empirically to filter out most spurious hits.
Next, all candidate hits in each gene family were examined to further verify whether they encoded the representative motif of this specific family using hmmpfam
based on the Pfam database with an E value cut-off of
10-4. Using this method, all homolog genes for each of
the 10 non-housekeeping gene families in our sampled
five plant genomes were identified. Then, the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for each gene family based
on the neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Gene families
usually experiences extensive segmental and tandem
duplication over the evolutionary history, thus bringing
difficulties in identifying their orthologous relationships
across different species. Therefore, only those monophyletic clades which cover all four dicots and also have >
50 bootstrap values were sampled in this study. The
neighboring homologous genes surround the sampled
clade were used as a proxy of outgroup. Although this
sampling criterion is relatively strict, generally > 50%
members were sampled for each gene family. Following
this strategy, our total dataset of 111 orthologous clades
were sampled from those 10 non-housekeeping gene
families. Since the number of clades sampled in each
gene families varies considerably, simply using this total
dataset to conduct statistic analysis may introduce latent

Page 9 of 12

sampling bias. Therefore, this total dataset was further
divided into three sub-datasets. Sub-dataset 1 contains
35 clades which sampled from eight relatively small
gene families. Sub-dataset 2 is comprised of 24 clades,
all sampled from PP2C gene family. Finally, sub-dataset
3 covers 52 clades and represents LRR-Pkinase gene
family. Further analyses were conducted for not only the
total dataset but all these three sub-datasets as well.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction

Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed for both
revealing evolutionary relationship among our sampled
five species and estimating evolutionary rate in each
gene locus or clade. The sequences of those 34 chloroplast genes and 85 housekeeping genes were respectively
concatenated in unique matrix to infer the evolutionary
history of O. sativa, A. thaliana, M. truncatula, V. vinifera and P. trichocarpa. The amino acid sequences of
this matrix were aligned by ClustalW with default
options [45] and the resulting alignments were then
used to guide the alignments of nucleotide coding
sequences (CDSs). The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining (NJ) method
with the Kimura’s 2-parameter model using MEGA program v4.0 [46]. All positions containing gaps or missing
data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option in MEGA). The stability of internal nodes
was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates.
For each of our sampled individual gene loci or clades,
the phylogenetic tree was also reconstructed independently following similar procedures. The tree topologies
of these individual gene loci or clades were then used as
input files for PAML package (v4.4) [47] in molecular
evolution estimation. We also used Phylip program version 3.69 [48] with the Maximum Likelihood (ML)
method to confirm the phylogenetic relationship, and
obtained the same topology as NJ trees for nuclear
genes with 100% bootstrap supports (data not shown).
For chloroplast genes, the ML consensus tree suggested
a different topology (P. trichocarpa clustered with M.
truncatula before the clustering with V. vinifera). The
bootstrap support for the clustering of P. trichocarpa
and M. truncatula was rather low (50.6%) in this case,
however. Thus, we present only the results from the NJ
method (Figure 1).
Evolutionary rate estimation

Theoretically, for each of our sampled gene loci or
clades, the evolutionary rates of two compared species
A and B after they have diverged from their common
ancestor with reference to the outgroup species O, can
be estimated by the equation dA = (dAB+dAO-dBO)/2 and
dB = (dAB+dBO-dAO)/2 respectively [23,49]. In our study,
four annual-perennial pairs, At vs Vv, At vs Pt, Mt vs

Yue et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/242

Vv, Mt vs Pt, were compared, with Oryza sativa as an
outgroup. For species with multiple copies of paralogs,
its evolutionary rate was estimated by calculating the
mathematic mean of those paralogs. A total of three different measurements, the nucleotide substitution number per site (d), the proportion of nonsynonymous
difference (pN) and the proportion of synonymous difference (p S ), were employed to estimate evolutionary
rates. d was calculated using the Kimura’s 2-parameter
method and pN and pS were calculated using the NeiGojobori method by MEGA.
In addition, we used the maximum likelihood (ML)
method to compare the evolutionary rates. Since this
method does not necessarily depend on the sequence
information from the outgroup, which is largely distant from the dicot species in our study (Figure 1),
the ML method might minimize the saturation effect
and provide better estimates. As in Ronald et al. [50],
we implemented the branch-specific likelihood model
with the codeml program in PAML 4.4 in our calculation. The branch models allow different dN/dS for different branches along the phylogeny. The ML branch
lengths from tips of the two compared species to their
nearest node were collected and compared for each
annual-perennial pair. For species with multiple
copies of paralogs, their evolutionary rate was estimated by calculating the mathematic mean of those
paralogs. Three different estimators, nucleotide substitution rate per site (d), nonsynonymous substitution
rate per site (d N ), and synonymous substitution rate
per site (d S), were employed to estimate evolutionary
rates.
Both the outgroup-dependent method and the ML
method were used in this study and generally consistent
results were obtained. Therefore, only results from the
ML method were shown in the text for simplicity. The
results from the outgroup-dependent method were
attached in Additional files 2 and 1 (Figure S1-S2 and
Table S1-S6).
Statistical analysis

The differences between annual and perennial evolutionary rates were calculated for each comparison pair
and both sign-test and paired t-test were used to assess
the null hypothesis of equal evolutionary rates between
annuals and perennials. According to the sign-test, if the
ratio of plus signs to minus signs deviates from the
expected 1:1 ratio significantly, the null hypothesis is
rejected, suggesting different evolutionary rates in
annuals and perennials. Paired-t test, on the other hand,
measures whether the means of the same subject from
the two compared groups vary significantly from each
other, thus taking into account the degree of difference
in each matched pair.

The correlation analysis was conducted using Origin
software. Following the biological hypothesis that two
compared species diverge from a common ancestor, if
their evolutionary rates do correlate, the regression line
should pass through the origin. Thus, the square of correlation coefficient (R 2 ) is calculated under this
assumption.
