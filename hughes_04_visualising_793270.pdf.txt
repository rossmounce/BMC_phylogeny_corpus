Abstract
Background: Common existing phylogenetic tree visualisation tools are not able to display
readable trees with more than a few thousand nodes. These existing methodologies are based in
two dimensional space.
Results: We introduce the idea of visualising phylogenetic trees in three dimensional hyperbolic
space with the Walrus graph visualisation tool and have developed a conversion tool that enables
the conversion of standard phylogenetic tree formats to Walrus' format. With Walrus, it becomes
possible to visualise and navigate phylogenetic trees with more than 100,000 nodes.
Conclusion: Walrus enables desktop visualisation of very large phylogenetic trees in 3
dimensional hyperbolic space. This application is potentially useful for visualisation of the tree of
life and for functional genomics derivatives, like The Adaptive Evolution Database (TAED).

Background
There are approximately 1.7 million identified species. A
conservative estimate of the total number of species on
Earth is 4 to 10 million species. About 80,000 of the identified species have a resolved phylogeny and ongoing
research aims to substantially increase this number [1].
While methods for phylogenetic visualization have typically been developed for small phylogenetic trees, new
methods are required as efforts to resolve the tree of life
proceed. Beyond purely taxonomic interest, visualising
phylogenetic data is increasingly important in functional
genomics and other fields (see [2,3]). For example, systematic analysis of genome content, adaptive evolution of
proteins, and other genome scale datasets can be parsed
phylogenetically, where an overview of the relationship of
species is important.

Many common software tools for visualising small phylogenetic trees already exist, including Treeview [4] and ATV
[5]. These tools lay out trees in a two dimensional Euclidean space and are useful for visualising trees of up to a
few hundred nodes. Some software tools, like Hypertree
[6], have increased the number of visualisable nodes
using 2D hyperbolic space to provide a "focus+context"
view, where a subset of the data can be viewed at higher
resolution with the remaining contextual data still in view
(see the Deep Green project for an example with plant
phylogenies [7]).
In hyperbolic space (as opposed to Euclidean space), circumference and area increase exponentially instead of
geometrically, enabling allocation of space for every node
independent of the total number of nodes in the tree.
Although hyperbolic space is infinite, it can be projected
into a finite volume of euclidean space for a

"focus+context" view. The result of the projection is a disc
where points within the disc are magnified according to
their radial distance from the center with the amount of
magnification decreasing continuously and at an accelerating rate from the center to the boundary. By bringing
different parts of a tree to the magnified central region, the
user can examine every part of the tree in detail while
retaining a sense of the context. Hypertree allows visualisation of up to a thousand nodes [6]. While this represents
an improvement, a tool that can handle an order of magnitude more nodes is still required.
Different approaches have been proposed for solving this
problem. One strategy is to not visualise the whole tree

but instead to display a representative part of it as implemented in SpaceTree and TreeWiz [8,9]. Visualization
using virtual reality has also been reported as a potential
approach to the problem, but this requires a special virtual reality chamber [10,11].
We suggest visualising trees in 3D rather than 2D hyperbolic space which allows rendering inside a sphere rather
than a disc. By using specifically developed layout algorithms [12], the Walrus tool (related to H3 Viewer) [1214] makes it possible to interactively visualise the entirety
of trees with several hundred thousand nodes on a desktop computer.

Implementation
Walrus and the Walrus phylogenetic tree conversion tool
are written in Java. The architecture of the design is
depicted in Figure 1. Walrus reads files in its own specific

LibSea format [15]. This format describes the topology of
the tree and the labels associated with the nodes (labels
can be textual or numerical). A conversion program converts various phylogenetic tree formats to the LibSea for-

mat by converting both the topology and the label data.
The implemented features in the conversion tool include
conversion from New Hampshire (Newick, Phylip), New
Hampshire Extended (ATV) and the NCBI taxonomy database files to the LibSea format, narrowing the conversion
to a particular subtree of interest, colouring of different
sections of the tree included in the conversion and production of a corresponding legend, and with conversion
from the NCBI taxonomy database format, inclusion in
the LibSea output of data on rank, taxonomic ID, and scientific name, as included in the NCBI database [16].

Results and discussion
Figure 2 depicts the cellular tree of life from the NCBI taxonomy database [16]. The X depicts the root of the tree,
while the Eukaryotes, Archaea, and Eubacteria are clearly
visible as distinct groupings. With this view in the background for perspective, it is possible to view closer relationships in detail. Figure 3 shows the primate tree from
the NCBI taxonomy database. Figure 4 shows the same
tree in ATV [5], where the 321 leaves are much less distinguishable. While traditional 2D viewers like ATV have
other uses, the advantages of 3D viewers like Walrus for

large scale visualisation are readily apparent from Figures
3 and 4.
Visualising phylogenetic and taxonomic classification
data in 3D has clear utility. While the examples shown in
Figures 2, 3, and 4 present species trees and taxonomic
relationships, the browser can also be utilized for
extremely large gene family trees. Olfactory receptors are
one gene family with an interesting history of gene duplication, selection, and gene loss that can be visualised
using this type of tool [17]. Finally, the tool is valuable as
a companion for the front end of databases containing
functional genomics information indexed phylogenetically, like The Adaptive Evolution Database (TAED) [2].

Conclusions
Munzner and colleagues have demonstrated the advantage of using hierarchical data viewers enhanced with a 3D
hyperbolic view over conventional 2D based viewers for
efficiency of deciphering tree-based information [18].
While the 3D hyperbolic visualization of phylogenetic
trees will not fully supplant 2D viewers, it can serve as an
additional module to augment other visualization components. In the future, a phylogenetic tree visualization
tool that integrates several visualization components in a
similar way to the XML3D tool used by Risden et al. [18]
would be desirable. The Walrus viewer and the conversion
tool are a step towards this goal.
