Abstract
Plant diseases caused by fungi and oomycetes result in significant economic losses every year.
Although phylogenetically distant, the infection processes by these organisms share many common
features. These include dispersal of an infectious particle, host adhesion, recognition, penetration,
invasive growth, and lesion development. Previously, many of these common processes did not
have corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) terms. For example, no GO terms existed to describe
processes related to the appressorium, an important structure for infection by many fungi and
oomycetes. In this mini-review, we identify common features of the pathogenic processes of fungi
and oomycetes and create a pathogenesis model using 256 newly developed and 38 extant GO
terms, with an emphasis on the appressorium and signal transduction. This set of standardized GO
terms provides a solid base to further compare and contrast the molecular underpinnings of fungal
and oomycete pathogenesis.

Common pathogenesis programs of fungi and
oomycetes
Oomycetes, although phylogenetically very distant, share
many common morphological and physiological features
with the true fungi [1-3]. For example, they have similar
filamentous, branching, indeterminate bodies, and they
acquire nutrition by secreting digestive enzymes and then
absorbing the resultant breakdown products. More
importantly, fungi and oomycetes share a unique capability compared with other microbial pathogens, namely
that they are able to breach cuticles of host plants and
establish infection rapidly [4]. Consequently, both are

causal agents of many destructive plant diseases and are
responsible for significant economic losses every year.
In this review, we summarize common mechanisms of
pathogenesis displayed by oomycetes and fungi. Pathogenesis by a fungus or oomycete is a complex process.
Briefly, it includes the following steps: dispersal and
arrival of an infectious particle (usually a spore of some
kind) in the vicinity of the host, adhesion to the host, recognition of the host (which may occur prior to adhesion),
penetration into the host, invasive growth within the host,
lesion development in the host, and finally production of
additional infectious particles [5,6] (see Figures 1, 2). In

that these child terms are general GO terms; "position regulation," for example, includes induction, upregulation,
stimulation, etc. Four diagrams (see Figures 3, 4, 5, 6)
encompassing the 256 new and 38 extant GO terms
explicitly depict our description of pathogenesis, with an
emphasis on appressorium formation and signal transduction. More details about each step are presented in the
following sections.

order to describe the entire process, we formulate a
description of pathogenesis using standardized terms
from the Gene Ontology (GO), including 256 new terms
developed by members of the PAMGO (Plant-Associated
Microbe
Gene
Ontology)
consortium
http://
pamgo.vbi.vt.edu, an official interest group of the GO
Consortium, as well as 38 extant GO terms that are placed
in shaded boxes in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6.
All of the 256 new terms are placed within GO under the
node "GO ID 0044403 symbiosis, encompassing mutualism through parasitism" (note the original, broad definition of "symbiosis" used in GO, which specifies use of the
words "symbiont" and "host" as the smaller and larger,
respectively, of the symbiotic interactants). Among these
new terms, every term that starts with "modulation" or
"regulation" has two child terms, one is "positive regulation of...", and the other is "negative regulation of..." Note

Dispersal of spores is the most common process to initiate
new infections [5], though direct infection by hyphae may
occur. An example of the latter is the spread of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes in forest soils. Dispersal mechanisms can be grouped into two types: one is passive
dispersal by wind, water or animal [7], and the other is
active dispersal such as shooting ascospores through the
boundary layer of air surrounding the fruiting body by
forcible discharge [8]. Similarly, spores can be grouped
into two types according to their motility. In fungi nonmotile spores include sexual spores such as ascospores,
rust urediniospores, sclerotia and conidiospores, while
non-motile oomycete spores include oospores, sporangiospores and conidia. Motile spores with flagella, called
zoospores, are ubiquitous among oomycetes and are also
found in chytrid fungi [9]. Additionally, spores vary in
requirements for dormancy. Some spores, such as
zoospores, must encyst and differentiate to acquire qualities of dormancy before they become true spores [10]. Different spores vary in the length of the dormancy period;
for example, some ascospores and oospores show
extended dormancy, while others such as zoospores and
ascomycete conidia are usually short-lived.
Three new GO terms including the term "GO ID 0075325
spore dispersal on or near host" were developed under the
node "GO ID 0051701 ...interaction with host" to
describe the mechanisms of spore dispersal. New terms
describing active or passive dispersal mechanisms were
placed as children of "spore dispersal on or near host" (see
Figure 3).
Eight new GO terms describing spore motility were listed
under the node "GO ID 0052127 movement on or near
host". The term "GO ID 0075230 spore movement on or
near host" is central to these eight terms with "GO ID
0075234 zoospore movement on or near host" as the
principal child term (see Figure 3).

Similarly, eight new GO terms were added under "GO ID
0044408 growth or development of symbiont on or near
host" to describe spore encystment. The term "GO ID
0075214 spore encystment on host" is central to these
eight terms, with the term "GO ID 0075218 zoospore
encystment on host" as the main child term (see Figure 3).

www.geneontology.org for further information).

These 19 new terms are appropriate for annotating gene
products known to be involved in spore dispersal. For
example, inhibition of the vacuolar H+-ATPase by potassium nitrate causes a reduction in vacuole expulsion in
zoospores of the oomycete Phytophthora nicotianae and
leads to premature encystment [11]. Thus, H+-ATPase
negatively regulates zoospore encystment and can be
annotated with the new term "GO ID 0075221 negative
regulation of zoospore encystment on host".

Adhesion to the host
Adhesion of spores to the host involves physical and
chemical processes [3]. Typically, when spores reach the

surface of a host tissue, they attach via adhesion molecules
[5]. A germination tube then emerges from the spore or
the encysted zoospore (see Figure 2). From the germination tube, a growth hypha or an infection structure such as
an appressorium [12-16] develops, which also becomes
firmly attached to the host surface via adhesion molecules. A variety of other infection structures such as
hyphopodia [17-19], haustorium mother cells [20-23], or
infection cushions [24] are generated by fungal pathogens
after germinating on the host surface. These all serve a
common function of facilitating the pathogen's entry into
the host tissue. It should be noted that the sporangia of
many oomycetes may germinate directly to form an infec-

tion hypha, or else in the presence of abundant water they
may differentiate, through specialized cleavage vesicles,
into 10–30 zoospores that can individually disperse to
initiate sites of infection [25].
Seven new GO terms under the parent, "GO ID 0044406
adhesion to host", were developed to describe in detail
the biological process of adhesion to a host. The term "GO
ID 0075001 adhesion of symbiont infection structure to
host" is central to this section. Among the seven terms,
five terms that describe adhesion of a specific infection
structure, including appressorium, hyphopodium, haustorium mother cell, infection cushion, or germination
tube, are children of "adhesion of symbiont infection
structure to host" (see Figure 3).
To describe spore germination on or near host tissue, 16
new terms under the parent, "GO ID 0044408 growth or
development of symbiont on or near host", were developed. The 16 terms cover spore germination, sporangium
germination, encysted zoospore germination, and germ
tube formation. The term "GO ID 0075005 spore germination on or near host" is central to this section. Major
relationships among the sixteen terms are shown in Figure
3.
The 23 new GO terms in this section are useful for annotating pathogen gene products involved in adhesion to
host tissue. For example, Car (cyst-germination-specific
acidic repeat) proteins of the oomycete Phytophthora
infestans are transiently expressed during germination of
cysts (i.e., encysted zoospores) and during formation of
appressoria, and they are localized at the surface of germlings. These proteins have considerable sequence homology to mucins and have an internal octapeptide repeat
with the mucin consensus sequence TTYAPTEE. Therefore,
like mucins, Car proteins should serve as a mucous cover
protecting the germling and assisting in adhesion to the
leaf surface [26]. Thus, the Car proteins can be annotated
with the new terms "GO ID 0075226 encysted zoospore
germination on or near host" and "GO ID 0075001 adhesion of symbiont infection structure to host", using the
GO evidence code ISS (Inferred from Sequence or Structural Similarity).

Signal transduction during recognition of the
host
Signal transduction is an integral component of the host
recognition process. Examples include protein kinasemediated signal transduction [27], receptor-mediated signal transduction [28], G-protein coupled receptor protein
signal transduction, G-protein subunit-mediated signal
transduction [29], cAMP-mediated signal transduction
[30], calcium or calmodulin-mediated signal transduction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S7

[31], and adenylate cyclase-mediated signal transduction
[12].
In order to adequately describe signal transduction during
symbiont interaction with its host, three sets of new terms
were developed. Signal transduction pathways involved in
the recognition between host and symbiont are generally
quite extensively characterized and consequently 127 new
terms were developed.
The first set of new terms is intended for annotation of
host gene products that stimulate symbiont signal transduction (see Subtree 1, which includes terms under the
node "GO ID 0052470 modulation by host of symbiont
signal transduction pathway" in Figure 5). This set has 37
new terms. Five of these terms describing different types of
signal transduction pathways are children of "GO ID
0052470" (see Subtree 1 in Figure 5).
The second set of new terms is intended for annotation of
symbiont gene products that stimulate host signal transduction (see Subtree 2, which includes terms under the
node "GO ID 0052027 modulation by symbiont of host
signal transduction pathway" in Figure 5). This set has 36
new GO terms and has the same structure as the first set
(see Subtree 2 in Figure 5). The terms in the second set are
essentially the converse of the terms in the first set. For
example, the term "GO ID 0075130 modulation by symbiont of host protein kinase-mediated signal transduction" in the second term set has a complementary term
"GO ID 0075099 modulation by host of symbiont protein kinase-mediated signal transduction" in the first term
set.
The third set of new terms is intended for annotation of
symbiont gene products that stimulate symbiont signal
transduction in response to the host (see Subtree 3, which
includes terms under the nodes "GO ID 0051701 interaction with host" and "GO ID 0051707 response to other
organism" in Figure 6). This set has 56 new GO terms. The
new term "GO ID 0075136 response to host" is central to
the 56 new terms. This term has 10 child terms that
describe 10 symbiont responses to host organisms, such
as "GO ID 0075147 regulation of signal transduction in
response to host", "GO ID 0075140 response to host
defense molecules", and "GO ID 0075180 regulation of
transcription in response to host" etc. (see Figure 6). Eight
of the 10 terms have their own child and lower level offspring terms, and each of those "response" terms has a
child term such as "maintenance of symbiont tolerance to
host ..." (see details in Figure 6).
The term "GO ID 0075147 regulation of signal transduction in response to host" has five children to describe different types of signal transduction, similar to the five child

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9(Suppl 1):S7

terms of "GO ID 0052470 modulation by host of symbiont signal transduction pathway" in the first set. Each of
the five terms has child terms for positive regulation and
negative regulation.
The three sets of new GO terms can be used to explicitly
describe genes of signal transduction pathways involved
in host recognition. For instance, the PMK1 gene of the
rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae encodes a mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), which is a key component in the MAPK signaling cascade and is involved in
appressorium formation and infectious growth [32].
Thus, the PMK1 protein can be annotated with the term
"GO ID 0075171 regulation of MAP kinase-mediated signal transduction in response to host". Note that this gene
product would not be annotated with "GO ID 0052435
modulation by host of symbiont MAP kinase-mediated
signal transduction pathway" since this latter GO term is
reserved to annotate host gene products. Similarly, this
protein should not be annotated with "GO ID 0052080
modulation by symbiont of host MAP kinase-mediated
signal transduction pathway" since PMK1 belongs to the
symbiont's and not the host's signaling transduction pathway.
In addition, the modulation terms have children that
describe more specific kinds of signal transduction. For
example, "GO ID 0075168 regulation of protein kinasemediated signal transduction in response to host" has a
child "GO ID 0075171 regulation of MAP kinase-mediated signal transduction in response to host" (see details
in Figure 6).

Penetration into the host
Pathogens have evolved several mechanisms that include
structural and/or enzymatic components in order to enter
into their plant hosts [5]. Many fungi, such as Alternaria
alternata, Colletotrichum graminicola, M. oryzae, Pyrenophora
teres, and many oomycetes, such as P. infestans and Phytophthora cinnamomi, develop appressoria to directly penetrate plant cuticles [13,33-38]. An appressorium is a
highly specialized structure that differentiates from the
end of a symbiont germ tube. It is a swollen, dome-shaped
or cylindrical organ, from which a narrow penetration peg
emerges to rupture the plant cuticle and cell wall [33]. The
penetration peg extends and forms a penetration hypha to
penetrate through the epidermal cells and emerge into the
underlying tissue [34,35]. In some instances, penetration
is driven by astoundingly high turgor pressures within the
appressoria [36,38]. Generation of turgor is due in part to
a thick inner cell wall layer of melanin in mature appressoria. In other instances, cell wall degrading enzymes may
play a primary role in or may facilitate the penetration
process [39-41]. Appressoria produced by some fungi,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/S1/S7

such as rust fungi, do not penetrate directly through the
cuticle, but gain entry through stomata [42].
Sixty-four new GO terms were developed to describe the
biological process of penetration into the host, and they
form two groups. The first group includes 43 new GO
terms related to infection structures established on the
outside of the host tissue, such as appressoria, hyphopodia, infection cushions, and haustorium mother cells. The
second group has 21 new terms related to specialized
structures that directly pierce the surface of the host, for
example penetration pegs, penetration hyphae, and haustorium necks.
All of the 43 terms in the first group are children or lower
level offspring of "GO ID 0052108 growth or development of symbiont during interaction with host". The core
of this group is "GO ID 0075015 formation of infection
structure on or near host". Twenty-eight terms in this
group are related to appressorium formation. In particular, five of the 28 terms describe in detail the process of
appressorium formation, namely "GO ID 0075025 initiation of appressorium on or near host", "GO ID 0075034
nuclear division during appressorium formation on or
near host", "GO ID 0075033 septum formation during
appressorium formation on or near host", "GO ID
0075035 maturation of appressorium on or near host",
and "GO ID 0075017 regulation of appressorium formation on or near host" (see details in Figure 3).
Besides the child term "GO ID 0075016 appressorium
formation on or near host", the term "GO ID 0075015
formation of infection structure on or near host" has three
more detailed child terms: "GO ID 0075192 haustorium
mother cell formation on or near host", "GO ID 0075187
hyphopodium formation on or near host", and "GO ID
0075183 infection cushion formation on or near host"
(see details in Figure 3).
All of the 21 terms in the second group are children or
lower level offspring of "GO ID 0044409 entry into host".
The core of this group is "GO ID 0075052 entry into host
via a specialized structure", which has three child terms
related to penetration peg, penetration hypha, or haustorium neck for entry into the host (see details in Figure 4).
The 64 new terms can be used to annotate the gene products of penetration-related genes. For example, genes
involved in melanin biosynthesis in the rice blast fungus,
such as ALB1, RSY1 and BUF1, are required for appressorium function since mutants lacking these genes make
appressoria, but are unable to penetrate susceptible rice
leaves [43]; these can be annotated with the term "GO ID
0075053 formation of symbiont penetration peg for entry
into host".

Invasive growth within the host

Other new GO terms

After successful penetration, invasive hyphae are formed
that ramify through the host tissue [44,45]. In some cases,
special structures, such as a haustorium or an arbuscle, are
formed in host cells for the symbiont to absorb nutrition
[22,23].

Six new terms were placed jointly under the nodes "GO ID
0006914 autophagy" and "GO ID 0044403 symbiosis,
encompassing mutualism through parasitism". The term
"GO ID 0075071 autophagy during symbiotic interaction" is the core of the six terms, and it has two complementary children, "GO ID 0075044 autophagy of host
cells during interaction with symbiont" and "GO ID
0075072 autophagy of symbiont cells during interaction
with host". The latter term has a child "GO ID 0075073
autophagy of symbiont cells on or near host surface",
which itself has a lower level child "GO ID 0075074 spore
autophagy during appressorium formation on or near
host" (see details in Figure 3).

To describe invasive growth, 15 new GO terms were developed that are children or lower level offspring of "GO ID
0044412 growth or development of symbiont within
host". The term "GO ID 0075065 growth or development
of symbiont in host cell" has two children, "GO ID
0052094 formation by symbiont of haustorium for nutrient acquisition from host" and "GO ID 0075066 growth
or development of symbiont in host organelle". Additionally, arbuscules produced by mycorrhizal fungi are a type
of structure functionally similar to haustoria, and thus
"GO ID 0075328 formation by symbiont of arbuscule for
nutrient acquisition from host" is a sibling of "GO ID
0052094" (see details in Figure 4).
The 15 new GO terms in this section meet the need to
annotate pathogen genes that are involved in invasive
growth. For example, the MST12 gene in the rice blast fungus M. grisea was found to regulate infectious growth but
not appressorium formation [46]. In particular, no obvious defects in vegetative growth, conidiation, or conidia
germination were observed in MST12 deletion mutants.
Also, MST12 mutants produce typical dome-shaped and
melanized appressoria. When inoculated through wound
sites, MST12 mutants fail to cause spreading lesions and
appear to be defective in infectious growth. As a result,
MST12 mutants are nonpathogenic [46]. Thus, the MST12
gene can be annotated with the term "GO ID 0075061
formation of symbiont invasive hypha within host".

Lesion development in the host
The eventual result of infection in most cases is lesion
development. A lesion can be defined as any abnormality
involving any tissue or organ due to any disease or any
injury (cited from MedicineNet.com). Not surprisingly,
there are many types of lesions including those caused by
damage such as cold injury or insects' bites etc. It is difficult to define lesions objectively, as this requires a subjective judgment on what constitutes abnormal or damage
and from what perspective, ranging for example from perturbation of a few cells to death of an entire tissue or
organ. Similarly, formation of a lesion is not a specific
process belonging to either the pathogen or the host and
can be highly dependent on the environment. Therefore,
at this time only one term, "GO ID 0009405 pathogenesis", is appropriate for genes involved in lesion formation.

The six autophagy-related GO terms are applicable to
describe the functions of several genes in fungal pathogens during symbiotic interaction. For example, formation of a functional appressorium in the rice blast fungus
requires autophagic cell death of the conidium, which is
controlled by the MgATG8 gene. Deletion of MgATG8
results in impaired autophagy, arrested conidial cell
death, and a nonpathogenic fungus [14]. Thus, MgATG8
can be annotated with the new term "GO ID 0075074
spore autophagy during appressorium formation on or
near host".

Conclusion
Two hundred fifty-six new GO terms were developed to
annotate genes or gene products involved in common
pathogenic processes in fungi and oomycetes, including
spore dispersal, host adhesion, recognition, penetration,
and invasive growth. These new GO terms provide the
opportunity to apply a standard set of terms to annotate
gene products of fungi, oomycetes, and their associated
hosts, as well as those of other plant-associated pathogens
and their hosts. The ability to compare and contrast these
annotations for widely different plant-associated
microbes and their hosts, using a standardized vocabulary, will greatly facilitate the identification of unique and
conserved features of pathogenesis across different kingdoms. In addition, such comparisons should provide
insight into the evolution of pathogenic processes.
