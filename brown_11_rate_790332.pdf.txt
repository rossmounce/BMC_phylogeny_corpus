Rate variation and estimation of divergence times
using strict and relaxed clocks
Richard P Brown1* and Ziheng Yang2

Abstract
Background: Understanding causes of biological diversity may be greatly enhanced by knowledge of divergence
times. Strict and relaxed clock models are used in Bayesian estimation of divergence times. We examined whether:
i) strict clock models are generally more appropriate in shallow phylogenies where rate variation is expected to be
low, ii) the likelihood ratio test of the clock (LRT) reliably informs which model is appropriate for dating divergence
times. Strict and relaxed models were used to analyse sequences simulated under different levels of rate variation.
Published shallow phylogenies (Black bass, Primate-sucking lice, Podarcis lizards, Gallotiinae lizards, and Caprinae
mammals) were also analysed to determine natural levels of rate variation relative to the performance of the
different models.
Results: Strict clock analyses performed well on data simulated under the independent rates model when the
standard deviation of log rate on branches, s, was low (≤0.1), but were inappropriate when s>0.1 (95% of rates fall
within 0.0082-0.0121 subs/site/Ma when s = 0.1, for a mean rate of 0.01). The independent rates relaxed clock
model performed well at all levels of rate variation, although posterior intervals on times were significantly wider
than for the strict clock. The strict clock is therefore superior when rate variation is low. The performance of a
correlated rates relaxed clock model was similar to the strict clock. Increased numbers of independent loci led to
slightly narrower posteriors under the relaxed clock while older root ages provided proportionately narrower
posteriors. The LRT had low power for s = 0.01-0.1, but high power for s = 0.5-2.0. Posterior means of s2 were
useful for assessing rate variation in published datasets. Estimates of natural levels of rate variation ranged from
0.05-3.38 for different partitions. Differences in divergence times between relaxed and strict clock analyses were
greater in two datasets with higher s2 for one or more partitions, supporting the simulation results.
Conclusions: The strict clock can be superior for trees with shallow roots because of low levels of rate variation
between branches. The LRT allows robust assessment of suitability of the clock model as does examination of
posteriors on s2.

Background
Dating divergences between populations/taxa is of considerable value in phylogenetic/phylogeographic studies
because of the importance of an absolute time-scale
when assessing hypotheses of lineage diversification, e.g.,
[1-5]. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods have become widely used for this purpose
[6-8]. The Bayesian approach is well-suited to dating
because it naturally incorporates different sources of
information and associated uncertainties through the

priors. Most significantly, time calibrations are incorporated through the prior on divergence times. This represents a more robust solution to that offered by current
maximum likelihood alternatives, which do not appear
to correctly account for all sources of uncertainty and
therefore underestimate confidence interval widths on
divergence times [[9,10] pp248-251].
Bayesian MCMC dating incorporates models that
allow the rate of molecular evolution to vary across the
tree, through the prior on substitution rates. To date,
rate variation is generally modelled using a relaxed or
local clock approach in which the rate on a branch is
either correlated with the rate on its ancestral branch or
is independent of rates on other branches [11-13]. (Note

that we use the term “relaxed clock” throughout this
paper to simultaneously refer to both independent and
correlated rates models.) Under the independent rates
model, a rate is assigned to each branch from a single
lognormal distribution. The program MCMCTREE [14]
assigns both the mean rate and the variance of the log
transformed rate, s2, from gamma distributions specified
by the user. This model is also implemented in the program BEAST [15] although the standard deviation of log
rate, rather than s2, is assigned from a user-defined distribution. Under the correlated rates model, rates on
branches are dependent on branch durations and the
rate on the ancestral branch. The mean of the normal
distribution for log rate is obtained from the log of the
rate on the ancestral branch. The variance of this distribution is the product of the branch time duration and a
parameter ν that is specified from a gamma distribution
[12]. Hence, rates on shorter branches will show greater
similarity with the rate on their ancestral branches than
rates on longer branches. Finally, strict clock models
generally assign a single rate to the entire tree from a
lognormal distribution with a mean and variance specified from a gamma or other distribution.
A comparison of the models discussed here indicated
that the independent rates model performed well overall
for simulated data, possibly because it can accommodate
homogenous and correlated rates [7]. Nevertheless, this
model contains more parameters and provides wider
posterior intervals than the strict clock. Furthermore,
the strict clock has been shown to perform well on data
that show quite clock-like evolution [7]. An investigation
of the impact of increasing levels of rate variation on the
performance of the strict clock is therefore of considerable practical use. The correlated rates model has a
large number of parameters but is also more restrictive
than the independent rates model. It may therefore be a
less suitable option than the other two models, under
most conditions. Ho et al. [16] found that exponential
and lognormal independent rates models performed well
when rates were correlated or uncorrelated, but found
little support for the correlated rates model (see also
[17]). In contrast, Lepage et al. [18] compared the fit of
several different models to three real datasets and
argued for correlated rates particularly in large datasets
(although their analyses did not use any calibrations and
so did not fully reflect typical applications). Here, our
primary aim was to compare independent rates with
strict clock models, but we also examine the performance of the correlated rates model. We achieve this by
analyzing divergence times of sequences using a strict
phylogenetic approach, as opposed to divergence times
of species using a phylogenetic-coalescent approach
[19]. Also, we use programs that were designed for dating single topologies, rather than programs such as

Page 2 of 12

BEAST [15], because integration over topological uncertainty can have undesirable effects on the specification
of priors on times [20]. Our approach attempts to simplify the analysis while still providing general findings
concerning the suitability of the clock models and natural levels of rate variation.
This paper considers dating of shallow trees, which we
broadly define as phylogenies with a Miocene or more
recent root. There is good reason to believe that rates
should be similar among recently diverged lineages.
Rates may vary due to both stochastic effects and inherited or other lineage-correlated factors such as environment. Among the inherited effects, body size [21-25],
mass-specific metabolic rate [26], but see also [27] and
generation time [28-30] have all been suggested as partial explanations of rate variation. The similarity of these
characteristics in closely related species leads to the
expectation of lower rate variation in these phylogenies,
which may favour use of a strict clock.
The decision to use a strict or relaxed clock needs to
be informed by a suitable test. Although new methods
are being developed [31], the likelihood ratio test (LRT)
has traditionally been used for testing for clock-like evolution [32]. It compares a tree with no branch rate constraints with the same tree in which rates on branches
are constrained to be equal. The LRT is powerful when
rates vary between, but not within, branches [33] as
modelled in the relaxed clock analysis. One disadvantage
is that it may have low power when there are few taxa
and sequences are short, leading to type II errors (incorrect acceptance of the clock). In addition, it will not
detect rate variation if tips are all equidistant from the
root, which could occur for example if equivalent rate
changes occurred synchronously across all branches.
There appears to be a paucity of detailed studies that
consider the performance of the LRT. Hence, a secondary aim of this work was to consider its performance
across different levels of rate variation.
This paper reports on the effects of rate variation on
the recovery of node ages using strict and relaxed clock
approaches as well as the ability of the LRT to detect
this rate variation.

Results
Simulated data
1) Rate heterogeneity

The relaxed and strict clock analyses recovered all internal node ages on the tree in the majority of analyses
when the sequences were evolved with s ≤ 0.1 (Figure
1). Strict clock analyses performed poorly when s > 0.1.
Note that we use the term ‘coverage probability’ to
describe the proportion of analyses that recover all node
ages on the tree (see Methods). Coverage probabilities
for relaxed clock analyses were high for all levels of s

under the independent rates model (MCMCTREE), but
were significantly lower under the correlated rates
model (MULTIDIVTIME) when s>0.2. Posterior intervals on selected nodes were wider for relaxed clock analyses, markedly so when s was high (Figure 2A, B). This
effect was more noticeable under the independent rates
than the correlated rates model. In contrast, the intervals remained similarly narrow for all levels of rate variation when analysed using a strict clock in
MCMCTREE (Figure 2A).
MCMCTREE analyses of replicates simulated under s
= 2 that used the correlated rates instead of the independent rates model provided very similar results to the
correlated rates MULTIDIVTIME analyses. Node ages
were recovered for all nodes on the tree in only 4% of
analyses, compared with recovery by 5% of analyses in
MULTIDIVTIME. This contrasts with a recovery of all
nodes in 67% of analyses under the independent rates
model in MCMCTREE (Figure 1).
The frequency of rejection of the clock by the LRT
showed a sharp transition around s = 0.1-0.2, which
paralleled the performance of the strict clock analyses.
The clock was rejected for less than 10% of the datasets
evolved with s < 0.2, but was almost always rejected
when s > 0.2 (Figure 3).
2) Number of taxa

The independent rates analyses recovered all node ages
in the 5 species tree for all replicates. Recovery of all
nodes ages in the 10 species (97-100%) and the 20 species replicates (96-100%) was also high. The

corresponding recovery of node ages under the correlated rates model was generally lower (89-99% for 5 species and 93-100% for 10 and 20 species trees). Slightly
lower recovery of node ages was obtained under the
strict clock, as would be expected given the previous
results. The LRT rejected the clock for 11% (5 taxa),
16% (10 taxa) and 26% (20 taxa) of replicates.
3) Age of root

The performance of the strict clock implemented in
MULTIDIVTIME was strongly dependent on root age,
with lower recovery of all node ages for older roots
(48% of replicates for 20 Ma root (Ma is an abbreviation
of Mega-annum) and 29% of replicates for 40 Ma root).
There was slightly poorer recovery of all node ages
under the correlated rates model at the oldest root age
(69% of replicates) compared with trees with 5-20 Ma
roots (81-83% of replicates). The pattern was different
in MCMCTREE. Strict clock analyses seemed to perform slightly better when the root age was older (5 Ma,
all node ages recovered in 68% of replicates; 10 Ma,
74%; 20 Ma, 85%; 40 Ma, 84%). The relaxed clock independent rates model performed more consistently over
the four root ages (93-97% replicates). However, coverage probabilities were generally higher under relaxed
compared with strict clocks over all root ages, for both
programs. Posterior intervals on nodes became narrower, as a proportion of node age, with increasing root
age under all relaxed clock analyses, but this trend was
clearer in MCMCTREE. The LRT rejected the clock on
slightly fewer occasions for 5 Ma (19%) and 10 Ma

4) Number of loci

Increasing the number of loci had no strong effect on the
suitability of strict or relaxed clock analyses. For MULTIDIVTIME, recovery of all node ages was slightly higher
for five independent loci under both the strict clock (80%
of replicates) and correlated rates (85%), when compared

with fewer loci (correlated rates: 77-81%, strict clock: 7072%). Posterior interval widths were similar for different
numbers of loci. Results differed for MCMCTREE, where
an increased number of loci had no discernible effect on
the frequencies of analyses recovering all node ages.
There was a trend for narrower posteriors with increased
numbers of loci for the MCMCTREE relaxed clock analyses but not for the strict clock analyses.

The LRT indicated violation of the clock for codon position 2 (X2 = 33.95, P = 0.03), but not for codon positions 1 (X 2 = 27.44, P = 0.12) or 3 (X 2 = 22.92, P =
0.29). The MCMCTREE independent rates analysis provided 95% posterior intervals for the variance in log
rate, s2, that included zero for codon position 1 (0.000,
0.358). The intervals were slightly higher for codon position 3 (0.077, 1.196), and indicated considerable rate
variation at codon position 2 (0.209, 2.330). The posterior means for s2 corresponded to quite high values of s
ranging from 0.27-1.00.

Posterior node ages differed considerably between the
strict and relaxed clock analyses with 95% intervals
being wider and means lower under the relaxed clock
for both programs (Table 1). MULTIDIVTIME posterior
means were lower under the strict clock and higher
under the correlated rates model, relative to the strict
and independent rates models in MCMCTREE.
2) Primate-sucking lice

The LRT did not indicate violation of the clock for
mtDNA codon positions 1-3: X2 = 4.29; P = 0.75; X2 =
3.57, P = 0.83; X2 = 7.16, P = 0.41, respectively, or for
nuclear codon positions 1 or 2 (X2 = 4.59, P = 0.71; X2
= 1.34, P = 0.99, respectively). However, the clock was
rejected for nuclear codon position 3 (X2 = 26.25, P <
0.001) and the 18S rRNA gene (X2 = 21.74, P < 0.003).
The lower posterior limit on s2 (MCMCTREE independent rates analysis) approximated to zero for mitochondrial codon positions 1-3: (0.003, 0.840), (0.003, 0.794),
(0.000, 1.987), and for nuclear codon positions 1 and 2:
(0.003, 1.814), (0.000, 1.975). Evidence of higher rate
variation was detected for nuclear codon position 3
(0.748, 4.247) and 18S rRNA (1.514, 6.182), closely
reflecting the LRT results. The posterior means corresponded to a range of s from 0.39-1.84.
For MCMCTREE, the ages of the two selected nodes
differed between strict and independent rates analyses in
the same way that they differed for the Black bass data,
i.e., higher posterior means and wider posterior intervals
for independent rates (Table 1). Posterior node ages
were lower for both models in MULTIDIVTIME, relative to MCMCTREE.
3) Podarcis

the LRT did not support violation of the clock for any
of the partitions (cytochrome b, codon 1, X2 = 11.40, P

Page 5 of 12

= 0.91; cytochrome b, codon 3, X 2 = 20.04, P = 0.39;
ND1 and ND2 codon 1, X2 = 14.43, P = 0.76; ND1 and
ND2 codon 3, X 2 = 14.00, P = 0.78; 12S rRNA, X 2 =
2.92, P = 0.99; control region X2 = 8.40, P = 0.98). The
95% posterior intervals on s 2 also indicated low rate
variation with lower posterior limits tending to zero in
all cases: cytochrome b, codon 1, (0.001, 0.989); cytochrome b, codon 3, (0.001, 0.653); ND1 and ND2 codon
1, (0.005, 1.546); ND1 and ND2 codon 3, (0.002, 0.848);
12S rRNA, (0.002, 1.322); control region (0.002, 1.205),
respectively. Posterior means were equivalent to a relatively narrow range of s from 0.40-0.60.
Relaxed clock analyses again provided slightly wider
posterior intervals on node ages than the strict clock
(Table 1). Posterior means were lower under the strict
clock compared with the relaxed clock but differences
between these clock models were smaller than found in
the Black bass and lice data. Again, posterior mean
node ages were lower in MULTIDIVTIME than in
MCMCTREE.
4) The Gallotiinae

Similar to Podarcis, the LRT did not indicate violation of
the clock for any of the mtDNA partitions (codon position 1, X2 = 21.65, P = 0.42; codon position 2, X2 = 12.69,
P = 0.92; codon position 3, X2 = 21.47, P = 0.43, rRNA
loops X2 = 20.96, P = 0.46, rRNA stems X2 = 17.04, P =
0.71) which was consistent with the lower limits of the
posteriors on s2: codon position 1, (0.002, 0.448); codon
position 2, (0.001, 0.901); codon position 3, (0.000,
0.215); rRNA loops (0.008, 1.088); rRNA stems (0.001,
0.541). Posterior means on s2 were quite low and equivalent to a relatively narrow range of s from 0.25-0.57.
The posterior means showed generally the same patterns as those detected for Podarcis, i.e., relaxed and

strict clock analyses gave quite similar mean node ages
for both programs with slightly wider posterior intervals
under the relaxed clock. Unlike Podarcis, there was no
clear trend for the strict clock to always give lower posterior means than the relaxed clock or vice versa (Table
1).
We also explored the sensitivity of the posteriors to
the prior on s2 using these data. The data were analysed
with 5 different priors that ranged from the wide G(0.5,
0.01) to the unsuitably narrow G(0.5, 100)(Table 2). The
three widest gamma distributions were all found to give
similar results, indicating a considerable influence by the
likelihood on the posterior for s2 in these cases.
5) Caprinae

The LRT indicated considerable violation of the clock at
codon positions 1 and 3 (X2 = 43.26, P < 0.01 and X2 =
57.90, P < 0.001, respectively), but not at codon position
2 (X2 = 31.24, P = 0.12). Estimates of s2 do not reflect
these results as clearly as for other datasets. The posterior intervals for s2 were quite low for all three codons:
position 1, (0.012, 0.431); position 2, (0.003, 0.710); position 3 (0.056, 0.355). Posterior means were low with a
narrow range, equivalent to s = 0.35-0.42.
Posterior node ages from relaxed and strict clock analyses were quite similar for each program (Table 1). Differences between programs were also quite small for
these data.

Discussion
Analyses of our simulated data confirmed that the strict
clock is useful for analysing shallow phylogenies. It provided relatively narrow posterior intervals and good
recovery of node ages when rate variation between
branches was low, that is, when the standard deviation
of log rate on branches (s) was ≤0.1. To better illustrate
this: 95% of rates fall within the range 0.0082-0.0121
subs/site/Ma when s = 0.01 (for a mean rate of 0.1
subs/site/Ma). The strict clock did not perform well
when rate variation was higher. Relaxed clock analyses
with independent rates showed a different performance

profile. Coverage probabilities were similar or only
slightly higher than the strict clock analysis when s <
0.2 but were notably better when s ≥ 0.2. At the highest
level of rate variation (s = 2), all internal node ages
were recovered by 67% of analyses under the relaxed
clock, compared with none under the strict clock. These
results are partly explained by increased posterior intervals widths under the relaxed clock. The relaxed clock
posteriors are substantially wider than corresponding
strict clock intervals (44% wider when s = 0.1). For this
reason, the strict clock is preferable when rate variation
is low but rapidly becomes unsuitable as rate variation
increases.
Unlike the independent rates analyses, the correlated
rates model did not perform well at higher levels of rate
heterogeneity (s = 0.2-2). This is attributed to the
relaxed clock model rather than some other aspect of
the programs because similarly poor performance was
obtained when the correlated rates prior was tested in
MCMCTREE. Our results strongly favour the independent over the correlated rates model when rate variation
is high and not time-correlated between branches. However, correlated rates may be preferable to a strict clock
at intermediate levels of rate variation.
We assessed performance in terms of coverage probabilities and posterior interval widths. These are the
principal arbiters of a successful analysis because the
aim is to achieve a high probability of capturing true
ages within narrow posteriors. Accuracy of the posterior
mean was not considered here, but it is worth noting
that a small upward bias is evident in the posterior
means of relaxed relative to strict clock analyses. This
has been observed previously and seems to be associated
with an increased influence by the prior on divergence
times [34]. Why it might have greater influence at
higher levels of rate variation will be explored in future
work.
We demonstrate that robust assessment of the clock
model is required prior to dating. The LRT is appropriate for this purpose when applied to the simulated data.

It tended not to reject the clock when the strict model
performed well (i.e., when s < 0.2) and almost invariably
rejected the clock when the strict clock model performed poorly (s > 0.2). This finding changes a little for
different numbers of species. The coverage probability
averaged over all nodes remains quite similar for 5-20
species trees. However, the clock rejection rate by the
LRT, shows more than a two-fold increase (from 11% of
5 species replicates to 26% of 20 species replicates) indicating that the clock is more likely be rejected for larger
trees, even when the strict clock model is appropriate.
More species on the tree increases the degrees of freedom in the LRT and increases statistical power. Hence
violation from the clock is more likely to be detected
even when rate variation is so small that the strict clock
model is quite suitable. In contrast, the number of species on the tree should have no noticeable influence on
s.
An increased number of loci leads to a small improvement in performance. This result is specific to phylogenetic dating of sequences but not to phylogeneticcoalescent dating of speciation times, e.g., [19]. A small
improvement could be expected in a phylogenetic analysis because a ‘rate-outlier’ on a branch will tend to have
a significant impact when only one single locus is
included. In a multilocus analysis the impact of such an
outlier will be mitigated by rates at other independent
loci on the same branch. These analyses also suggest
that a strict clock may be suitable at slightly higher
levels of rate variation when multiple independent loci
are available.
From the simulations we expected that strict and
relaxed clocks should perform similarly well when the
LRT does not reject the clock. This is largely supported
by the analyses of real datasets. Relaxed and strict clock
analyses provided quite similar divergence time estimates for the Gallotiinae and Balearic Podarcis datasets,
where rate variation was low for all data partitions. The
clock was rejected for some sequence partitions in the
other 3 datasets. Relaxed and strict clock analyses provided different divergence time estimates for two of
these datasets, the Black bass and lice data, in which
two or more partitions showed significant rate variation.
The Caprinae data were an exception to these findings.
The LRT rejected the clock for 2 out of 3 equally-sized
partitions. In contrast, Bayesian estimates of s 2 indicated relatively little rate variation which is consistent
with the similarity of the strict and relaxed clock estimates of divergence times. This demonstrates the utility
of the marginal posterior on s2 as a measure of rate variation across the tree. Unlike the variances in rates specified by the correlated rates model, which depend on
branch duration, s2 provides a simpler estimate of rate

Page 7 of 12

variation. It could be more generally applied to compare
across datasets. In BEAST [15] this could be achieved
by examining the posterior on the standard deviation in
log rate. Variance/standard deviation in rate will of
course depend on mean substitution rate at the locus,
and so comparisons would assume similar rates between
loci.
Rate variation seems to vary quite widely between different genes and partitions in real datasets. Posterior
means were equivalent to a range of s from 0.2-1.8,
which spans the range of s examined in the simulations.
Partitioning the data allows not only small improvements in divergence time estimation, as described here,
but also detection of quite considerable differences in
rate variation that can occur between partitions. Our
analyses of real data indicate that significant rate variation in one partition justifies use of the relaxed clock,
even though our more general conclusion is that the
strict clock can be superior for analyses of recently
diverged sequences.

Conclusions
The strict clock is shown to have significant advantages
over relaxed clocks because it provides good recovery of
node ages and narrow posterior intervals when rate variation is low. Rate variation in three out of five shallow
(Miocene root) phylogenies was within the range of rate
variation over which the strict clock model performed
well, supporting the applicability of the simulation
results. The LRT is a generally suitable way to test the
suitability of the strict clock, although examination of
posteriors on s2 may be more informative.
Methods
Simulated data

Bayesian analyses are computationally intensive which
favours simulation of smaller datasets. A tree with 10
taxa and a 10 Ma root (Figure 4A) was used for most
simulations, although trees with different numbers of
taxa (Figures 4B, C) and different node ages were also
used. The general procedure was as follows. Rates were
sampled from a log normal distribution with a mean of
0.01 substitutions/site/Ma and assigned to branches.
Branch lengths were obtained from the product of
branch duration and rate. DNA sequences of length
2500 bp were simulated for terminal taxa on these phylogenies using Evolver from the PAML suite of programs (ver. 4.3 [14]). The HKY+G model [35] was used
with the following base frequencies:0.30 (T), 0.25 (C),
0.30 (A), 0.15 (G), a transition: transversion ratio () of
5, and a gamma shape parameter (a) for site rate heterogeneity of 0.5. One hundred replicate datasets were
generated for each set of conditions.

1) Rate heterogeneity

Different levels of rate variation were simulated using
the standard deviation of the normal distribution (s)
from which the natural logarithm of the rate was
sampled. Replicate datasets were obtained for each of
the following values of s: 0 (strict clock), 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0. For illustration, the central 95% of
rates will be between (0.0091-0.0110), (0.0066-0.0145)
and (0.0000-0.0682) for s = 0.05, 0.2 and 2.0,
respectively.
2) Number of taxa

Replicates were simulated for phylogenies containing 5,
10 and 20 species with s = 0.1 (Figures 4B,C).
3) Age of root

Replicates were simulated for the 10 species topology
with the following root ages: 5 Ma, 10 Ma, 20 Ma, 40
Ma (s = 0.1 in each case). The ages of other nodes on
these trees were proportional to their ages on the tree
with the 10 Ma root.
4) Multiple loci

The 2500 bp of sequence was assigned to different numbers of partitions, each with a different rate but with s =

A

0.1. The multiple loci tested were: two (1250 bp each,
with mean rates 0.005 and 0.015), three (833 bp, rate =
0.005; 834 bp, rate = 0.010; 833 bp, rate = 0.015) and
five (500 bp each, with mean rates 0.0050, 0.0075,
0.0100, 0.0125, and 0.0150) loci.
Analyses of simulated data

Bayesian estimates of divergence times were obtained
for each replicate using the programs MCMCTREE [14]
and MULTIDIVTIME [36]. These programs were
selected because their statistical features have been
described and investigated quite extensively
[6,8,12,33,36-39]. Details of the analyses are described
below.
A multivariate normal approximation of maximum
likelihood (ML) estimates of branch lengths is used by
MULTIDIVTIME. Calculation of these branch lengths
required assignment of an arbitrary outgroup to the
simulated datasets. This was simulated in the same way
as the other taxa, but with a divergence time that was
10% older than the root on each tree. (The outgroup
was removed for the subsequent Bayesian dating

analysis.) No outgroup was necessary for MCMCTREE,
which calculates an exact likelihood using just ingroup
sequences.
Analyses were specified to accommodate the models
used to generate the simulated sequences. The correct
(HKY) model was used with both i)  (control variable:
kappa_gamma) and ii) a (control variable: alpha_gamma) specified from the gamma distribution: G(1,
0.1). Gamma distributions are specified using the mean
and standard deviation in MULTIDIVTIME, but for
consistency we describe all gamma distributions in
terms of shape (a) and scale (b) parameters where mean
= a/b, variance = a/b2.
All analyses were carried out with 1 time unit = 10
Ma. Uniform distributions with hard bounds were used
to constrain the root age in MCMCTREE (sensu [8]).
This option was selected because soft bounds are not
available in MULTIDIVTIME. The root was constrained
by maximum (15% above the correct root age) and
minimum bounds (15% below the correct root age).
The prior density on times in MCMCTREE, hereafter
referred to as the BDS prior, was specified from a birth
(l), death (μ) process with species sampling (r), where
l = 5, μ = 5, r = 0.1. This specification generates
higher densities of younger nodes for the range of true
root ages used here (0.5-4 time units) and appears generally appropriate for analyses of shallow phylogenies
[39]. In MULTIDIVTIME, the ages of the internal
nodes on the tree are specified by a symmetric (i.e., all
elements of the alpha vector are equal) Dirichlet distribution, conditional on the root age. The Dirichlet
prior was parameterized by a single value defined by
the minab option. We used minab = 1.0 which provides a uniform Dirichlet density. Prior intervals on
node ages were assessed by running the MCMC chains
without data.
In MCMCTREE relaxed clock analyses of simulated
data, the hyperpriors on mean rate and the variance in
log rate were both assigned from a gamma distribution:
G(0.5, 1.0). In MULTIDIVTIME the hyperparameter
that determines the degree of rate correlation, ν, was
specified from G(0.5, 1.0). The rate at the root was also
specified from the same gamma distribution. In order to
separate the effects of the different models from other
differences between programs, the correlated rates
option was also used in MCMCTREE to analyse 10 species datasets (100 replicates) simulated for a 10 Ma root,
using the same specification that was used in
MULTIDIVTIME.
A single rate is specified for strict clock analyses. A G
(0.5, 1.0) distribution was used to specify both the mean
of this global rate and the variance of log rate in
MCMCTREE, and also to specify the global rate in
MULTIDIVTIME.

Page 9 of 12

Bayesian MCMC chains were run for 2.5 × 105 generations, with a sampling interval of 50, for both programs. Likelihoods were obtained for rooted (clock) and
unrooted (unconstrained) trees for each simulated dataset (individual loci analysed separately) using BASEML
(ver. 4, [14]), and the significance of the difference
between them tested using the LRT.
High coverage probabilities for individual node ages
indicate that the analyses have performed well. However,
wider posteriors increase the coverage probability without providing useful information on times. Performance
was therefore assessed in two ways for each group of
replicates: 1) examination of the coverage probabilities
over all nodes, to obtain the frequency of replicates in
which all node ages were recovered by the analysis, 2)
analysis of mean widths of posterior intervals on
selected nodes.
Real datasets

Five datasets were used to examine levels of rate variation in real phylogenies and compare the results of strict
and relaxed clock analyses. The LRT was used to test
for clock-like evolution in individual partitions, for all
datasets (ingroup taxa only).
1) Black bass

Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among
Black bass (Micropterus) were investigated by Near et al.
[40] using 2190 bp of mtDNA, representing complete
cytochrome b and ND2 gene sequences (Figure 5A,
Additional file 1). Several additional genera were
included (Lepomis, Ambloplites, Archoplites, Ennacanthus, Centrarchus) to provide minimum fossil constraints for two nodes. Minimum constraints alone are
inadequate for reliable dating and so we used Near et
al.’s findings to define reasonable maximum bounds on
these nodes. The age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Archoplites and Ambloplites were specified as ‘>1.5 <1.75’ time units, while the root node was
specified as ‘>2.3 <3.2’ time units (Figure 5A). We used
hard bounds and specified 1 time unit = 10 Ma for all
analyses of real data. Lepomis was used only as an outgroup for estimation of branch lengths, prior to the
MULTIDIVTIME analyses. Similar sequences were
removed, leaving 22 ingroup taxa for analysis.
Strict and relaxed clock analyses were performed using
MULTIDIVTIME and MCMCTREE. Analyses were
similar to those described for the simulated data, with
minor differences which we describe here. In
MCMCTREE,  was specified from a G(5, 0.667) distribution and a was specified from a G(1, 1) distribution.
Similarly, the mean rate was specified from a G(0.1, 1)
distribution and the variance in log rate was specified
from a G(0.5, 1) distribution both for rates on branches
in the relaxed clock analysis and the global rate in the

strict clock analysis. As for all data sets, priors on divergence times were examined by running the MCMC
chain without data and then an appropriate BDS prior
on times was specified (see [39]). For the Black Bass
data this prior was specified as were: l = 5, μ = 5, r = 1.
In MULTIDIVTIME the rate at the root (relaxed
clock) and the global rate (strict clock) were specified
from a G(0.1, 0. 1) distribution. The parameter, ν, was
assigned from a G(0.5, 1) distribution. The Dirichlet
prior on times was specified using minab = 0.3 to provide wide prior intervals on node ages.
2) Primate-sucking lice

Speciation times in lice were investigated by Light and
Reed [41], using sequences from COI, Cytochrome b,
and CO3 mitochondrial genes and from 18SrRNA, EF1a, CAD, POl, Wg, and H3 nuclear genes (Figure 5B,
Additional file 2). We divided the sequence into 7

partitions: 3 partitions of 694 bp each corresponding to
mtDNA codon positions, 3 partitions of 687 bp each
corresponding to nuclear DNA codon positions, and
536 bp of nuclear sequence from the 18S rRNA. Some
individuals originating from the most basal nodes were
removed from the original dataset, leaving 9 individuals
from the following species: Pediculus schaeffi, P. humanus, Pthirus pubis and Pthirus gorilla (Figure 5B). A
tenth species, Pedicinus badii, was used as an outgroup
in the MULTIDIVTIME analyses. All partitions were
available for all ten species.
Light and Reed [41] applied 5-7 Ma constraints on the
node representing the MRCA of P. schaeffi (chimpanzee
lice) and P. humanus (human lice), corresponding to the
divergence of humans and chimpanzees. We specified
this calibration as well as a maximum bound on the
root as of 18 Ma using the RootAge (MCMCTREE) and

Brown and Yang BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:271
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/271

Bigtime (MULTIDIVTIME) control variables. The maximum bound on the root was specified using the posterior distribution published in the original study.
In MCMCTREE we specified the BDS prior on times
as: l = 5, μ = 5, r = 3. In MULTIDIVTIME the prior
root age was specified from a G(4, 2.667) distribution.
Other control variables were the same as those
described for the Black bass analyses.
3) Podarcis lizards

Brown et al. [34] analysed mtDNA from 21 P. pityusensis and P. lilfordi from different islands within the Balearics (Mediterranean sea) together with a P. sicula
outgroup (used here to estimate branch lengths for
MULTIDIVTIME only)(Figure 5C, Additional file 3).
The sequence (control region, cytochrome b, ND1,
ND2, 12S rRNA, 3 tRNAs) was divided into six partitions: cytochrome b codon position 1 (271 bp) and
codon position 3 (270 bp), ND1/ND2 codon position 1
(149 bp) and codon position 3 (149 bp), control region
(481 bp), 12S loops (213 bp). Other parts of the
sequence (e.g., codon position 2) were removed because
they contained negligible phylogenetic information.
The root node in the tree represents the MRCA of the
two recognized species of Balearic Podarcis. Speciation
coincided with the rapid refilling of the Mediterranean
basin 5.33 Ma. Hence, Brown et al. [34] placed narrow
5.32-5.33 Ma constraints on the root node. We allowed
slightly greater uncertainty here by specifying ‘>0.528
<0.538’ (time units) as minimum and maximum constraints on the root. Other control variables were the
same as for the Black Bass analyses, although analyses of
priors on times indicated that a l = 5, μ = 5, r = 3 BDS
prior was more suitable in MCMCTREE.

Page 11 of 12

5) Caprinae

Lalueza-Fox et al. [43] examined mtDNA evolution within
the Caprinae. Brown and Yang [39] used an updated version of this dataset to obtain Bayesian estimates of divergence times in 25 Caprinae (Figure 5E, Additional file 5).
We re-examined the dataset used in [39]. The data consist
of 1128 bp of the cytochrome b gene, after removal of
missing data, and were partitioned by codon position (Figure 5E). Twenty-five species were analysed, together with
an outgroup for MULTIDIVTIME.
Constraints were applied to two different nodes (Figure 5E). First, the constraint ‘>0.528 <0.538’ was placed
on the (Myotragus, Ovis) node. This corresponds to the
same physical event that was described for Balearic
Podarcis. Second, we added a ‘<1.4’ maximum bound on
the root, which Lalueza-Fox et al. [43] reported as the
earliest likely time for the origin of this radiation. This
was specified using the RootAge control variable in
MCMCTREE and the Bigtime variable in MULTIDIVTIME. In MULTIDIVTIME the root age was specified
from a G(4, 6.4516) distribution.

4) Gallotiinae lizards

Cox et al [42] analysed 1786 bp mtDNA from 20 Gallotia lizards endemic to the Canary archipelago, and three
individuals from the North African sister taxon, Psammodromus. The sequence comprised 715 bp from the
cytochrome b, 261 bp from cytochrome oxidase I, 414
bp from the 16s rRNA and 396 bp from the 12S rRNA
genes (Figure 5D, Additional file 4). The lizard Timon
lepidus was used as an outgroup in MULTIDIVTIME.
Data were partitioned by codon position (cytochrome b
and cytochrome oxidase I) and by stem and loop secondary structures (12S and 16S rRNA).
Maximum constraints on eight node ages were determined from island ages. These ranged from <2.06 time
units on the root, to <0.112 time units on nodes that
represent colonization of the youngest Canary Island, El
Hierro. Arbitrary minimum constraints of >0.05 time
units were also placed on the two (La Gomera, El
Hierro) and the (Tenerife, La Palma) nodes, as in [42]
(Figure 5D). In MULTIDIVTIME, the prior on age of
the root was specified from a G(16, 8) distribution.
