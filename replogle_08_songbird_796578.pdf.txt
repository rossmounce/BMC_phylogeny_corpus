Abstract
Background: Songbirds hold great promise for biomedical, environmental and evolutionary
research. A complete draft sequence of the zebra finch genome is imminent, yet a need remains
for application of genomic resources within a research community traditionally focused on
ethology and neurobiological methods. In response, we developed a core set of genomic tools and
a novel collaborative strategy to probe gene expression in diverse songbird species and natural
contexts.
Results: We end-sequenced cDNAs from zebra finch brain and incorporated additional sequences
from community sources into a database of 86,784 high quality reads. These assembled into 31,658
non-redundant contigs and singletons, which we annotated via BLAST search of chicken and human
databases. The results are publicly available in the ESTIMA:Songbird database. We produced a
spotted cDNA microarray with 20,160 addresses representing 17,214 non-redundant products of
an estimated 11,500–15,000 genes, validating it by analysis of immediate-early gene (zenk) gene
activation following song exposure and by demonstrating effective cross hybridization to genomic

DNAs of other songbird species in the Passerida Parvorder. Our assembly was also used in the
design of the "Lund-zfa" Affymetrix array representing ~22,000 non-redundant sequences. When
the two arrays were hybridized to cDNAs from the same set of male and female zebra finch brain
samples, both arrays detected a common set of regulated transcripts with a Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.895. To stimulate use of these resources by the songbird research community and
to maintain consistent technical standards, we devised a "Community Collaboration" mechanism
whereby individual birdsong researchers develop experiments and provide tissues, but a single
individual in the community is responsible for all RNA extractions, labelling and microarray
hybridizations.
Conclusion: Immediately, these results set the foundation for a coordinated set of 25 planned
experiments by 16 research groups probing fundamental links between genome, brain, evolution
and behavior in songbirds. Energetic application of genomic resources to research using songbirds
should help illuminate how complex neural and behavioral traits emerge and evolve.

Background
Songbirds offer unique opportunities for studying the
links between genome, brain structure, neurophysiology,
behavior and evolution. They are one of the most successful vertebrate radiations, diversifying into more than 4000
different species over the past ~65 million years [1,2] and
displaying a great range of physical, behavioral and social
adaptations [3,4]. Many songbird species are readily
observed in their natural habitats and several species have
been domesticated (e.g., zebra finch, canary). All songbirds share a highly specialized neural system for learned
vocal communication. Indeed, songbirds are one of the
few animal groups capable of complex vocal learning and
stand alone as accessible experimental models relevant to
human speech [5,6]. Neurobiological research using
songbirds has consistently generated new insights that
were later found to be true for other vertebrates; examples
include definitive evidence for sexual differentiation of
brain circuits, seasonal changes in brain anatomy, and
lifelong neuronal replacement [7].
Against these opportunities, the songbird as a research
model also presents challenges. Although the zebra finch
has emerged as a primary focus, many other songbird species are studied especially in natural contexts. It will be
important to develop tools and reagents that allow study
not just of one species (the zebra finch) but of many, so as
to exploit the diversity of vocal behavior shown by songbirds. Some of these studies will be comparative in nature
(e.g., how is the genome different in species with lifelong
vocal learning, compared to species that learn song only
once?). Other research objectives may focus on a single
wild-caught species to address questions of gene regulation and variation in a particular niche, environment or
behavioral paradigm. A related challenge is that researchers with expertise in field biology, neuroscience, physiology or behavioral analyses may not necessarily have equal
expertise in molecular genetics, and vice versa.

In response to these needs and opportunities, in 2002 we
inaugurated the Songbird Neurogenomics (SoNG) Initiative [8,9]. Our goals were to leverage rapid advances in
genomic technology, so as to bring new resources to songbird research and stimulate collaborative approaches that
would integrate field researchers, physiologists and
molecular biologists. Here we describe the following
accomplishments, which form the foundations of the
ongoing SoNG Initiative: 1) three generations in the
development of an evolving catalog of gene sequences
expressed in the zebra finch brain; 2) production and validation of DNA microarrays useful for study of diverse
songbird species; 3) organization of an efficient community-based mechanism for stimulating use of these
resources.

Results
High-Throughput Expressed Sequence Analysis and
Annotation
Over the course of five years, we generated three sequential assemblies of expressed sequence information, each
one incorporating more data drawn from both our own
primary sequencing efforts and from other zebra finch
research groups working in parallel (Table 1). For efficient
generation, annotation and presentation of expressed
sequence information, we made use of the ESTIMA software interface [10] and a production pipeline that had
been refined in development of resources for cattle [11],
honeybees [12] and other emerging research organisms
[13]. In the first phase of the project, we applied highthroughput DNA sequencing methodologies to generate a
collection of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from a normalized zebra finch brain cDNA library. The resulting
sequence information was assembled (ESTIMA:Songbird
Build 1), made publicly available via the internet [9] in
2004, and used to build the cDNA array described later in
this report. In the second phase of the project, we incorporated sequence information obtained from a sister project
[14]. The sequences were re-assembled (ESTIMA:Songbird

described [15]. In the third phase, we incorporated additional data from subtractive sequencing of our original
cDNA library and data from another sister project [16]
(ESTIMA Build 3, replacing Build 2 in October 2007).
ESTIMA:Songbird Build 1
For the primary EST assembly used in production of the
SoNG 20 K array (below), cDNA clones were 5'-endsequenced using high-throughput methods. 35,232 filtered high-quality ESTs were clustered and assembled into
17,878 non-redundant sequences (Table 1), comprising
10,120 pure singlets, 5,855 contigs and an additional
1,903 clustered singlets (i.e., some sequence relationships
in initial cluster analysis but could not be assembled into
unbroken contigs; possible splice variants). In subsequent
EST builds and BLAST analyses (below), 2900 of the Build
1 sequences were absorbed into larger contigs or aligned
against redundant gene targets in other species, and 3409
failed to align anywhere (including the whole genome
assembly of the chicken). Thus we estimate Build 1 and
the corresponding SoNG 20 K microarray represent products coming from between 11,569 and 14,978 unique
genes, with the uncertainty depending on the origin of the
3409 ESTs that cannot yet be aligned with a known
orthologous genomic region.

ESTIMA:Songbird Build 2
The ESTIMA:Songbird database was designed to be a
dynamic repository for zebra finch cDNA sequences in an
evolving collection. A complementary initiative centered
at Duke University emphasized the isolation of full-length
cDNA clones from libraries representing a diversity of
zebra finch brain states [14]. The Duke investigators provided us with sequencing chromatograms from their
project, and we combined this with our SB01-02-03
sequence data to produce a single assembly representing
58,457 filtered high-quality reads and 22,628 assembled
unique sequences (Table 1). This assembly was used as
the basis for design of a short-oligo Affymetrix array in a
parallel project at Lund University [15] (see below). To
estimate gene representation empirically, we performed a
test BLAST search for 61 orthologs of specific interest
across a range of functional categories (Table 2). Fortyone (~67%) were present in Build 2, including representatives of each of the functional categories of interest. However, numerous gaps in coverage remain, as shown for
example by absence of several important steroid receptors
and channel proteins in the assembly.
ESTIMA:Songbird Build 3
In a third build of the database, we incorporated two
more rounds of subtractive sequencing plus additional
sequences from colleagues at Rockefeller University [16].
The combined total of high-quality filtered reads now
reached a total of 86,784, which assembled into 31,658
non-redundant transcripts (Table 1). Having reached a

sequencing of this cDNA source. However, the frequency
of singletons remains high (~55%) indicating considerable sequence diversity still remains unrepresented.
Annotation
We performed machine annotations of each of the
sequential ESTIMA builds by BLAST sequence similarity
searches against external databases, making the results
publicly available through the ESTIMA:Songbird website
[9]. For Build 3, the BLAST analyses aligned 77% of the
assembled unique sequences to putative orthologs in
other vertebrates (Table 3A). For nomenclature, we used
the International Protein Index (IPI) of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) as a primary reference point
[17]. IPI is a database of cross references between the primary data sources, providing a minimally redundant yet
maximally complete set of protein sequences and stable
identifiers for featured species (one sequence per transcript). IPI also maps to a growing set of qualified Gene
Ontology (GO) terms for its sequence entries. Searching
against chicken IPI, we obtained alignments for 13,219
(42%) of our assembled Build 3 sequences (Table 3B).

In addition to the 13,219 sequences that aligned with IPI
records, another 5614 found matches against the chicken

Unigene database but not IPI, and a further 265 aligned
against Human Unigene but neither Chicken Unigene nor
IPI (Table 3C). In sum, we were able to assign "custom
annotation" names for 19,098 sequences, or 60% of the
Build 3 assembly. A further 17% showed significant alignment to the chicken genome at sites with no current functional gene annotation, and the remaining 23% have not
yet been aligned to any putative orthologous genomic
region.
Microarray Production and Validation
For gene expression studies, two different DNA microarrays were produced from the first two ESTIMA:Songbird
builds (Table 1). After ESTIMA:Songbird Build 1, the
sequenced cDNA inserts were PCR-amplified and spotted
onto a glass microarray; for contigs, a single representative
clone was spotted (Methods). In addition to these clones,
we also added 36 previously characterized cDNA clones as
controls on the array (Tables 4 and 5). The total number
of addresses on each array = 20,215 (hence we refer to this
as the SoNG 20 K array). An annotation file for this array
based on the Songbird3 Assembly is presented as Additional File 1. From ESTIMA:Songbird Build 2, a separate
short oligonucleotide array (Lund-zfa array) was produced using sets of 25 mer "perfect match" probes
designed by Affymetrix [15] (additional information

immediate early gene zenk in the auditory lobule (AL) of
the telencephalon following presentation of song playbacks [18-28]. We used this phenomenon as the basis for
a primary test of the 20 K microarray. The original canary
cDNA clone for study of zenk expression in both canaries
and zebra finches [20] was spotted redundantly on the
array as a replicated internal control. Additionally, a nearfull-length cDNA from the zebra finch was spotted once
on each array as one of the "known" genes. Fortuitously,
three other cDNAs representing distinct parts of the transcript were also present on the array, as they did not form
contigs in our EST sequence assembly (Fig. 1). Thus the
microarray contains 5 different probes spanning the zenk
mRNA and also representing the sequences of two different songbird species.
For this first experiment we used 6 microarrays and a simple direct-comparison design, where each array was
hybridized with two probes from a different pair of zebra
finches. For each pair, one bird heard a 30 minute song

immediately euthanized and total RNA was extracted
from the dissected ALs. We analyzed the hybridization
data using a two-stage parametric linear modeling
approach (Methods). Data for the five zenk-hybridizing
probes are summarized in Table 6.
Each probe reported an increased signal in the song-stimulated samples versus controls. The redundantly replicated canary zenk control probe measured a two-fold
increase in hybridization signal in the song-stimulated
samples, somewhat smaller than in past studies where signal for this probe was localized in histological sections by
in situ hybridization [20,21,29]. Nevertheless the increase
was observed here with high statistical confidence (FDR
effectively zero). Both the canary and zebra finch control
cDNAs reported similar fold-changes and mean signal
intensities, suggesting that these hybridization conditions

support effective species cross-hybridization for zenk. For
the other three EST-derived probes, the magnitudes of
increase ranged from 1.2-fold to 2.3-fold. Interestingly,
the 5'-most probe measured the smallest fold-change but
had the largest mean signal intensity, with the converse
for the 3'-most probe. These differences may reflect differential rates of RNA processing along the transcript or
sequence relationships to other cross-hybridizing molecules (e.g., zinc finger domains).
Concordance of SoNG 20 K and Lund-zfa arrays
Comparing microarray analyses between different platforms and labs is a difficult task and the results have to be
interpreted cautiously. These problems include not only
differences in array design and fabrication but also differences in sampling handling [30-32] and differences in the
approaches to analyse data from cDNA and short-oligo
Affymetrix arrays. Although we acknowledge these prob-

probes and only 8 probes need to be detectable for significance, virtually all of the ESTs on the arrays will be
detected. Hence, both platforms are similar in this rough
measure of sensitivity and both detect almost all the transcripts in male and female adult brains.

partial zenk cDNAs are spotted on the 20 K microarray.
Here they are aligned against the derived contig ("mRNA")

e12 cDNA [Genbank: EF050732] is the original songbird
zenk sequence [20]. Zebra finch ZZF23 cDNA [Genbank:
EF052676] was isolated using the canary sequence to probe a
zebra finch cDNA library (C.V. Mello et al., unpublished).

lems and the fact that quantitative comparisons are very
difficult, we still believe that it is useful to qualitatively
compare our two zebra finch array platforms. To the
degree the platforms give fundamentally similar results,
they validate each other. To compare the SoNG 20 K array
and the Lund-zfa array, a set of 11 samples (5 adult males,
6 adult females) were hybridized to both array types.
On the SoNG 20 K array, between 98.4% and 99.8% of
the spots on each array (excluding the negative controls)
were detectable above local background by the GenePix
software, indicating that almost all of the cDNAs on the
array are expressed in each of the male and female adult
brains (Methods). On the Lund-zfa array, when we used a
global background calculated from the cells with the 2%
lowest signals + 2 SD we found that 98.7% – 99.9% of the
probes were detectable above background (Methods).
Since each EST on an Affymetrix array is represented by 11

To compare detection of differentially expressed RNAs, we
focused only on those singletons/contigs that could be
mapped in a 1:1 relationship across the two platforms,
i.e., represented by one clone on the SoNG 20 K array and
one probe set on the Lund-zfa array. This resulted in
15,537 comparable gene targets (hereinafter "genes") on
each array type (Methods). At a False Discovery Rate
(FDR) of 0.05, 492 genes were significantly different
between males and females on the SoNG 20 K array, versus 355 genes on the Lund-zfa array. Note that the quantitative differences between the two significant lists are not
directly comparable due to differences in sample handling
and array analyses. However, despite this the lists shared
286 genes in common, such that most of the expression
differences found on the Lund-zfa arrays were also found
on the SoNG 20 K array (80.5%). Hence, the fact that so
many of the sexually dimorphic genes were identified by
both array types shows that the results from the two platforms are in concordance. Presentation and analysis of
sex-regulated genes per se is the subject of a separate investigation (A. Arnold and J. Wade, in preparation) to be
reported elsewhere.
Moreover, we also compared the estimated log2-fold
changes for all genes on both array types (Figure 2A). The
overall Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.573; while this
may not seem very high, the separate analyses of each
array type indicate that > 95% of the genes likely have zero
fold-change plus random measurement error, so they are
not expected to be correlated [31]. The correlation coefficient between genes with significant expression differences on both arrays is 0.895. This clearly shows that both
platforms to a large degree identify the same biological
variation.

We conducted a principle components analysis of all 22
sets of array values (using the 15,537 genes in common)
after scaling the pre-processed expression values to the
overall mean for each gene (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the
first principle component (PC1), which explains 16.2 %
of the variation, separates the arrays by sex. This shows
that the effect of sex is much more important than any variation between platforms that is measured by the other
principal components, and that both array platforms are
efficient in picking up the biological variation between
the samples. The array difference shows up in PC2
(10.3%) & PC3 (8.5%), while the sample pairs do not segregate together until PC4 & PC5 (7.2% and 6.5%). The
larger between-sample variation in PC2 (Figure 2B) for
the Lund-zfa array compared to the SoNG 20 K array may
reflect technical and analytical differences between the
hybridizations on the two platforms (for example sample
treatment), and does not necessarily indicate an intrinsic
difference in the quality of the two arrays.
Comparative genomic hybridization assessment
A major goal of the SoNG Initiative is to facilitate application of genomic analysis to the broad range of songbird
species now used in research. To assess the efficacy of our
20 K zebra finch array for measuring gene expression in
other songbirds, we performed a set of Comparative
Genomic Hybridizations (CGH), where instead of reacting the arrays with labeled tissue mRNA (cDNA), we
hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each of the
species. In this way, any differences in signal intensity can
be attributed directly to sequence differences between the
species, not confounded by differences in gene expression. In general, avian species have a substantially lower
repeat density than do mammals, simplifying the analysis
of genomic DNA hybridizations [33,34].

For CGH analysis, we obtained DNA from four other species representative of those proposed for study by the
SoNG Initiative collaborators (see next sub-section).
White-crowned sparrows and song sparrows are common
subjects for field research in North America; the canary is
a domesticated species typically studied in the laboratory.
Like the zebra finch, all are members of the superfamily
Passeroidea. The European starling is studied both in the
wild and in captivity. As a member of a different superfamily (superfamily Muscicapoidea), the starling is somewhat more distant from the zebra finch. For comparison
we also obtained DNA from two even more distantly
related birds, the kingbird and the chicken. The kingbird
is a suboscine; like songbirds, suboscines are also members of Order Passeriformes, but suboscines have no
apparent vocal learning ability and are estimated to have
diverged from oscines (songbirds) about 77 MYA [1]. We
also obtained DNA from chickens, a member of a different order of birds that diverged from Passeriformes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

approximately 100 MYA [35]. Each species was represented by four separate individuals, 2 males and 2
females. Each sample from an individual bird was hybridized on a separate array along with a universal reference
sample of genomic DNA pooled from 4 zebra finches
(two males and two females) labeled with Cy5. The individual samples were labeled with Cy3 and the universal
reference with Cy5 (for our general purpose here we considered the impact of dye bias to be negligible). The resulting data were then expressed as the log(2) ratios of the
signal in the two dye channels for each spot on the arrays.
A log(2) ratio of zero indicates equal signal from the test
species and the reference genomic DNAs.
A clear effect of phylogenetic distance is evident in the
cross hybridizations to the zebra finch array using DNA
from the kingbird (suboscine) and the chicken (nonoscine), as shown by histogram analysis log(2) ratios for
all the spots on the arrays (Fig. 3A). Histograms from
hybridizations using genomic DNAs from the other
oscine species (not shown) were essentially indistinguishable from the zebra finch histogram when all spots on the
array were included. However, statistical analysis detected
a small subset of spots with significantly different hybridization signals in the other oscines relative to the zebra
finch. Histograms focusing on the 200 genes showing the
greatest effect of species are presented in Fig. 3B. With the
three other Passeroidea (canary, song sparrow, white
crowned sparrow), the histogram peak height is reduced
somewhat (note change in Y-axis scale) and a scattering of
genes appears with log(2) ratios of 1–3 (zebra finch to test
species). With the somewhat more distant starling the
number of genes with reduced signals is slightly larger,
and the number larger still with the kingbird DNA. With
the chicken DNA, the central peak (log2 = 0) is abolished
altogether and the curve for these 200 genes is now shifted
by approximately 2 logs to the right. Hierarchical clustering of the CGH array data is also consistent with the general phylogenetic relationships of the species under
comparison (Fig. 3C).
Interestingly, we also noted cases where particular spots
on the zebra finch array gave strongest signals against the
genomic DNA of species other than the zebra finch (e.g.,
negative log values in Fig. 3B). An example is shown in
detail in Fig 3D. Note the sharp drop in signal intensity
against all species other than zebra finch except for the
starling, where a sharp increase in hybridization signal is
detected. We speculate that cases like this may represent
species differences in gene copy number.

PCR product to print at least 1000 microarrays. To engage

while maintaining consistent technical standards, we
devised the following plan. In 2004 we circulated a broad
invitation for investigators to apply for use of some of the
resulting DNA microarrays. We offered to perform the
RNA extractions and hybridizations centrally by a single
skilled investigator (KR), at no cost to the applicant
beyond the cost of producing the tissue. Each initiating
investigator would have control over initial publication of
resulting data, but all data would eventually be available
for use in a planned meta-analysis. The Call for Applications is provided here as Additional File 2. In response, 16
research groups proposed a set of 25 experiments representing a range of research questions and foci (Table 7). In
March 2005, these proposals were reviewed by the central
steering committee for the SoNG Initiative [8], with feedback offered as appropriate to the initiating investigators.
Systematic execution of these experiments began soon
thereafter and should be completed by the end of 2008.

Discussion
Using a pipeline for high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, we generated ~72,000 reads of sequences
expressed in the zebra finch brain. We incorporated these
and 27,000 more reads from other projects in the community into a single master database available to the public
via the internet [9]. Our approach has been iterative, progressing through three sequential builds each one incorporating additional data. We used our evolving sequence
assemblies in the design of two different microarrays for
gene expression studies and we have deployed these
resources in a large set of collaborations that should continue to bear fruit in the future.
The 86,784 filtered high-quality sequences in the current
(third) build of ESTIMA:Songbird describe approximately
31,658 non-redundant transcript segments. Although this
is a dramatic increase in the number of sequence information available (there were only 72 records for songbirds in
Genbank when our project began [36]), this collection is
still only a partial representation of the sequence diversity
in zebra finch brain. Most of the sequences are represented by only a single read and even after three library
subtractions, one of every three new sequences generated
was still novel. An early analysis of RNA complexity in the
canary forebrain suggested a population of as many as
100,000 different transcripts, with total nucleotide diversity approaching the size of the genome itself [37]. This
complexity seemed implausible when that analysis was
first done, but recent studies in species from flies [38] to
humans [39-41] have now demonstrated that transcription is much more widespread in the genome than previously anticipated.
Some of the 31,658 non-redundant sequences undoubtedly represent discontinuous portions of common tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

scripts, including alternative splicing products as well as
non-overlapping ESTs. Indeed, using the chicken IPI
annotation, we detected significant matches for 13,219
sequences but only 8127 (61%) of these IPI identifiers
were unique. Presumably this indicates that a substantial
fraction of the 31,658 "unique" sequences in the SB3
assembly are in fact derived from a smaller set of genes; by
extrapolation this suggests an upper bound of 19,311
(31658 × 61%) unique transcription units represented by
the SB3 assembly. Hence we have no reason at this juncture to expect the complement of protein coding genes is
any larger for the zebra finch than it is for the chicken, i.e.,
20,000–23,000 [33].
Approximately 23% of ESTIMA:Songbird 3 sequences do
not align significantly against the current build of the
chicken genome (WASHUC2, May 2006). Some of these
could represent orthologs of sequences that are present in
the chicken genome but not yet incorporated into the
chicken genome build. The current chicken genome
assembly is believed to lack approximately 8% of the
genes in the full genome complement, including
sequences on the female-specific W chromosome in particular. Our cDNA libraries were prepared from a mix of
both sexes.
As is true for all gene indices, annotation of function is a
major ongoing challenge. Very few genes in songbirds
have received any sort of direct experimental analysis thus
we must rely on inferences based on similarities to
sequences in other species. The closest species with significant genome annotation is the chicken. However, annotation of the chicken genome itself has relied heavily on
putative orthologies to mammalian sequences. During
our three sequential builds we probed a number of databases to assess their utility for generating putative functional annotations according to sequence similarities. As
of Build 3, we focused on the chicken International Protein Index as a primary annotation reference. This is a relatively conservative reference and reflects alignments only
with known or predicted protein coding sequences. Only
42% of our Build 3 assembled sequences align against the
IPI index, and these represent only a third of the total
number of sequence identifiers in the complete chicken
IPI index. We anticipate that many of the currently unannotated Build 3 sequences probably represent non-coding
segments of IPI-annotated genes. Identification of these
relationships should follow from the annotation of the
zebra finch genome assembly, expected in 2008.
Our database probably also contains some non-coding
RNAs [42]. A preliminary BLAST analysis of the 86,784
ESTs in our current database against miRBASE [43], a
compendium of ~5000 known microRNA sequences,
revealed significant alignments for 789 zebra finch ESTs

reference DNA from pooled zebra finches. Histograms are shown of the resulting mean log2 ratios (zebra finch:test species)
for all gene targets, by test species. Note that when samples from individual zebra finches were hybridized versus the pooled
zebra finch reference, the log2 signal ratios cluster closely around 0 as expected. The curve becomes shorter and broader with
cross-hybridization to the kingbird and the chicken. B) Histograms of log2 ratios (zebra finch:test species) for a subset of 200

group at Lund University and is not included in this publication. In our main report here, we described several
analyses that may have more general implications for
transcriptome analysis in songbirds.

To stimulate broad application of genomic approaches to
songbird research, we generated a cDNA microarray from
our first EST build and organized a Community Collaboration system for design and execution of experiments
using this array. Part of our group also developed an
Affymetrix oligonucleotide array based on our second EST
build [15]. To validate these tools and to refine the general
methods for the Community Collaborations we did several analyses. These analyses included assessment of optimal methods for RNA purification, MA plots of
hybridization data, amplification and labeling from dissected brain samples; and methods for microarray statistical analysis. Some of these studies are summarized in our
Call for Community Collaborations (Additional File 2).
Validation of the Affymetrix array has been done by the

The SoNG 20 K cDNA microarray includes 5 different
probes for transcripts derived from the zenk gene, including one from the canary sequence. All probes gave signals
well above background with labeled cDNA from the dissected auditory lobules of individual birds hearing either
song or silence, and all reported an increase in signal in
the song-stimulated birds relative to the silence controls.
Comparing the near-full positive control probes from
zebra finch and canary, both gave equivalent signal intensities and fold-change measurements. In the direct-comparison design used for this experiment, a group size of 6
birds per condition hybridized on 6 arrays was sufficient
to reach fairly robust statistical significance for three of the
single-spotted probes. The fourth (SB02047B2F12.f1, the
5'-most EST) would not have passed the threshold for

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:131

identification using even generous criteria (e.g., raw p <
0.05, FDR < 20%). This EST reported a mean intensity that
was almost three-fold higher than for the zebra finch and
canary positive control probes. We suspect this may indicate cross-hybridization to some other sequences for this
particular probe. Alternatively, the variations in mean
intensities and fold-changes for the five different probes
could indicate differential transcription or RNA processing across the transcript, phenomena that are increasingly
observed in high-resolution analyses of transcription
units [40]. It is also worth noting that in this preliminary
experiment we detected changes in 220 other probes at
the significance threshold of the single-spotted zebra
finch cDNA postive control (FDR 16%). Analysis of songregulated sequences is a topic of several of the proposed
Community Collaborations and will be described in
detail elsewhere.
With the production of the Lund-zfa array after ESTIMA
Build 2 [15], we were able to compare hybridization
results using the same tissue samples on the two array
platforms. Almost all of the transcripts represented on
each platform were detected in adult male and female
brains, and there was a general concordance between the
platforms on the estimated log2-fold changes for the transcripts they had in common. While the exact "significant"
gene lists varied slightly, much of this difference is probably due to differences in sample treatment and analyses
between the two array types, which determine the probability of detecting differences. For, example, the SoNG-20
K arrays used a common reference design which helps to
normalize differences between arrays, whereas the individual samples had additional shipping and handling
before being hybridized to the Lund-zfa arrays, which
could have added to their variability. Despite the differences between the platforms, a principle components
analysis (Fig. 2B) shows that the biological differences
between males and females dominate over any technical
differences between the arrays. In sum, both array platforms describe a similar overall picture of differential gene
expression and should be useful for further studies.
When we surveyed the songbird research community for
interest in using the 20 K array, we recognized that there
was considerable interest in experiments involving species
other than the zebra finch (Table 7). We initiated comparative genomic hybridizations at this point primarily to
evaluate the feasibility of cross-hybridizations with other
species. The use of single-species microarrays for species
cross-hybridizations is a controversial point in the literature (e.g., pro: [44-50]; con: [51]; cautionary: [49,52,53]).
Direct comparison of gene expression in different species
on a single-species array is especially problematic, as variations in gene copy number, sequence divergence and
RNA expression levels are all confounded. However, for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

most of the experiments initially proposed for Community Collaborations, the goals were to analyze particular
phenomena within a single species, focusing on phenomena that are not well represented in the zebra finch (e.g.,
effects of photoperiod). We believe that our cross hybridization studies clearly validate our 20 K cDNA microarray
for within-species comparisons of other oscine songbirds
(Fig. 3), with the caveat that some minority of the probes
will give reduced signals compared to hybridizations with
zebra finch material. One must also interpret any annotations with particular care, and cross-hybridization results
based on particular zebra finch array probes may need to
be verified independently, e.g., by resequencing in the target species and RT-PCR to confirm regulation.
The Lund-zfa array was developed with our second build
of ESTIMA:Songbird (zebra finch), and it was specifically
designed with the intent of supporting research in other
songbird species. Quantitative analysis of CGH to DNA
from the common whitethroat (Sylvia communis; family
Sylviidae) supports the efficacy of cross-hybridization as
96% of the ESTs are called as present [15]. Taking these
studies together with our own, zebra finch probes have
now been shown to be adequate for detecting signals in
the all three major superfamilies of the Passerida parvorder of the oscines (divergence time < 50 MYA)
[1,54,55]. However, our data for the kingbird (Fig. 3) suggest that use of zebra finch arrays for analysis of suboscines (divergence time ~70 MYA) may be more problematic. Direct empirical tests are needed to establish viability for use with Corvid species, oscines that diverged
from the Passerida ~50 MYA.

Conclusion
With an inclusive and integrative approach, the Songbird
Neurogenomics Initiative has established a rigorous foundation for application of genomic technology by the community of researchers focused on songbirds. Already our
ESTIMA:Songbird database has been used in the study of
gene dosage compensation in birds vs. mammals [56], sex
chromosome evolution [57], regulation of brain caspase3 activity in experience-dependent plasticity [58], development of markers for study of population genetics in
zebra finches [59], and identification of sequences subject
to positive selection in birds (Axelsson et al., submitted).
With the third build of the ESTIMA:Songbird database
now complete, we anticipate future improvements in
transcriptome annotation will soon come from other new
approaches including whole genome tiling arrays and
massively parallel sequencing [60,61]. In the meantime,
the collection of microarray experiments organized here
(Table 7) will generate a broad profile of gene expression
in the songbird brain across multiple dimensions of species, sex, neuroanatomy, developmental age, physiological state and behavioral context. The active engagement of

a broad research community was instrumental in the
selection of the zebra finch as the second avian species for
whole genome sequencing, after the chicken [62]. Continuing community participation will be crucial in applying
these emerging resources to the expanse of fundamental
research questions posed by songbirds.

Methods
Sources of cDNA Sequences
Clones for sequencing were drawn first from two normalized libraries (designated SB01 and SB02) representing
zebra finch brain RNA from both sexes at multiple ages.
Three generations of subtracted libraries (SB03, SB05,
SB06) were then prepared sequentially from SB02, by
removing the clones sequenced in the previous rounds
using PCR subtractive hybridization. For clones from
these libraries, sequence reads were generated from the 5'
end of each insert. Additional sequence records were also
obtained from colleagues at Duke University [63] and
Rockefeller University. Details for each cDNA source follow.
SB01
2,880 cDNAs were donated by participant Juli Wade, from
a normalized library produced at Michigan State University representing d10-60 male and female telencephalons
[64]. Average read length was ~510 nucleotides, and
sequence redundancy was 9%.
SB02
A new normalized, directional library [65] was produced
for this project using zebra finch brains contributed from
aviaries at UCLA (A. Arnold), Oregon Health and Science
University (C. V. Mello), Michigan State University (J.
Wade) and University of Illinois (D. Clayton). The collected tissues represented telencephalon of both sexes at
each of 5 ages: adult, day45, day10, day1 and embryonic.
Total RNA was extracted separately from each of the 10
groups, using the Trizol method, and pooled in approximately equal amount. The integrity of total RNA was verified
by
denaturing
agarose
gels
and
by
spectrophotometry (ratio A260/280). Poly(A)+mRNA was
isolated twice from total RNA using the Oligotex Direct
mRNA kit (Qiagen). mRNA was reverse transcribed into
double stranded cDNA using a modified oligo18(dT)
primer with an identifying tag sequence. Double stranded
cDNAs were size selected (more than 450 bp). Size
selected cDNAs were adaptored with EcoRI adapters at
both ends and digested with NotI. The cDNA was then
directionally cloned into EcoR1-NotI digested pBluescript
II SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Purified plasmid DNA from
the primary library was converted to single-stranded circles and used as a template for PCR amplification using
the T7 and T3 priming sites flanking the cloned cDNA
inserts. The purified PCR products, representing the entire

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

cloned cDNA population, were used as a driver for normalization. Hybridization between the single-stranded
library and the PCR products was carried out for 44 hours
at 30°C. Unhybridized single-stranded DNA circles were
separated from hybridized DNA rendered partially double-stranded and electroporated into DH10B cells to generate the normalized library. The normalized library had
a total of 4.6 × 106 colony forming units (cfu) with less
than 1% empty vectors (blue colonies). Average insert
size, as determined by PCR of random clones, was 1 kb.
Average sequencing read length was ~710 nucleotides.
After 18,720 reads, redundancy was 41%.
SB03
A subtracted library was produced from SB02 by removing
previously sequenced clones as described in [65]. The
total number of clones of the SB03 library was 3 × 106 cfu.
SB03(a): For ESTIMA:Songbird Build 1, 19,584 clones
were sequenced from the subtracted library, with an average clean read length of 700 nucleotides. SB03(b): For
ESTIMA:Songbird Build 2, an additional 9,120 sequences
were determined.
SB05
a second round of subtraction was performed in which
clones sequenced from the SB02 and SB03 libraries were
removed from the SB03 library as described [65]. The
resulting library was named SB05 [there is no SB04 – that
designation was used in quality control procedures]. The
titer of the subtracted SB05 library was 4.6 × 106. A total
of 11,328 clones were sequenced from this library with an
average clean read length of 812 nucleotides.
SB06
the third round of subtraction involved the removal of all
sequenced SB02, SB03 and SB05 clones from the SB05
library. The new SB06 subtracted library had a titer of 2.2
× 106. An additional 11,040 clones were sequenced from
SB06, with an average clean read length of 635 nucleotides.
Duke sequences
Sequence data for was obtained directly from Erich Jarvis
and colleagues at Duke University [14]. Reads had been
performed from both 5' and 3' ends of each cDNA. For
Build 2, we obtained the raw sequencing chromatograms
and processed them as for the SB library reads at Illinois.
64% (23,225) met the minimum quality criteria. For
Build 3 we used the final sequence records (17,312) as
deposited in NCBI by the Duke investigators, where each
record represents a single unconnected read from one end
(either 5' or 3') of a single clone. In ESTIMA:Songbird,
these sequences are identified by their Genbank IDs,
which begin with initial letters "DV".

Rockefeller sequences
Sequence data as deposited in NCBI was obtained directly
from XiaoChing Li at Rockefeller University [16]. In
ESTIMA:Songbird, these sequences are identified by their
Genbank IDs, which begin with initial letters "EE".
High-Throughput Sequencing
For high-throughput sequencing from the cDNA libraries
described above, bacteria were plated on agar plates with
100 μg/μl of carbenicillin and colonies were robotically
picked with the Genetix Q-pix and racked as glycerol
stocks in 384-well plates. After overnight growth of the
glycerol stocks, bacteria were inoculated into 96-well deep
cultures with 0.7 ml of Luria Broth and 100 μg/μl of carbenicillin and grown for 18 hours. Plasmid DNAs were purified from the bacterial cultures with the Qiagen 8000 and
Qiagen 9600 BioRobots. Sequencing reactions were set up
as follows: 4 μl of 12.5% glycerol, 2 μl of 5X sequencing
buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 μl of 1 μM T7 standard
primer, 1 μl of H2O, 0.5 μl of BigDye terminator (Applied
Biosystems) and 1 μl of template. Thermal cycling was
performed at 96°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of
96°C for 15 sec, 53°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 4 min. Reaction products were precipitated with 70 μl of 0.2 mM
MgSO4 in 70% ethanol. Samples were resuspended in 10
μl of formamide (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions of the 5'ends were performed on ABI 3730 × l capillary systems. All 384- and 96-well format plates were
labeled with a barcode and a laboratory information management system (HTLims) was used to track sample flow.

Base-calling was performed using the Phred program. Vector sequences were trimmed using Cross-match. Lowquality bases (Phred quality score < 20) were trimmed
from both ends of sequences using Qualtrim and Simpletrim software developed at the W. M. Keck Center (University of Illinois). Those ESTs having a length of more than
200 base pairs after both vector and quality trimming
were considered "high-quality" ESTs. The repeat
sequences in these ESTs then were masked by the RepeatMasker program using vertebrate repeat sequences database as reference. The masked sequences were then
searched for sequences from bacterial chromosomal
DNA, RNA, viral DNA, rRNA, and mitochondrial DNA
using BLASTN).
EST Assembly
Paracel Transcript Assembler (based on CAP4) was used
to assemble the ESTs in a two-stage process [66]. First,
related sequences were clustered using BLASTN. Each cluster was then assembled into contigs where possible (i.e.,
no discontinuities in the alignment). All BLAST searches
were conducted using the NCBI stand-alone BLAST software. The maximum E-value for an alignment to be
judged significant was 10-5, an arbitrary value precedented

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

by other studies [11-13]. The nonredundant EST set was
searched by BLASTx against the NCBI nonredundant protein database (NR.aa) and SWISSPROT. Statistics for the
three sequential assemblies are given in Table 1. For example, for ESTIMA:Songbird Build 1, 87% of SB01, SB02 and
SB03(a) reads passed all criteria above and were included
as "filtered, high quality sequences," for a total of 35,232
sequences in the assembly.
EST Annotation
BLASTn was used to search against the chicken genome
sequence (Gga genome) assembly (WASHUC2, May
2006) [67] and tBLASTx to align against databases representing chicken transcripts in NCBI (Gga Unigene build
33, NCBI Chicken RNA downloaded May 17, 2007),
Ensembl (Chicken cDNA-All and Chicken cDNA ab initio, downloaded May 17, 2007), and the archive [68] of
the TIGR Chicken Gene Index GGGI release 11 [69]. We
also used tBLASTx to search against the Human (Hs) Unigene database (Build 201), the NCBI Chicken protein
database (downloaded May 17, 2007) and the Chicken
International Protein Index (IPI, Release 3.26). Default
parameters were used for all BLASTs, which were performed locally with TimeLogic Server. The maximum Evalue for an alignment to be judged significant was 10-5,
an arbitrary value precedented by other studies [11-13].
Where multiple targets within a database produced alignments with significant E-values, the single best-scoring
alignment was saved. Descriptive details for each alignment are available for each record in the ESTIMA:Songbird database [9]. To obtain a short, descriptive working
name for annotated sequences, where available we
imported the IPI protein name into our ESTIMA database
in the "custom annotation" field.
Production of 20 K spotted cDNA Array
Individual cDNA clones were selected to represent each of
the 17,878 unique sequences in the primary assembly. For
contigs that comprised multiple clones, we selected a single clone for the microarray as follows:

a. for each EST, we compared top 5 hits against
NCBI(NR), vs top 5 for whole contig consensus sequence;
eliminated ESTs having no correspondence to any of the
contig's hits [rationale: their inclusion in the contig could
be an artifact – direct similarity to the core conserved consensus is validating].
b. selected the EST farthest upstream ["5'-most," should
be the longest, and the most useful for cross-hybridizations]
c. where multiple ESTs shared the 5'-most ends, we picked
the longest.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:131

d. for the minority of contigs that did not align against
NR, we found the longest ORF in the contig consensus
and selected the EST that gave the best match (by
TBLASTN) to the consensus ORF.
The cDNAs representing these clones and controls were
rearrayed in 384 well plates with a Genetix QPix clonepicking instrument and stored as a stock clone set at 80°C. Sample clones from each plate were resequenced
for quality control and accuracy of clone transfer. Stock
clones were inoculated for overnight cultures in LB media
containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and 8% glycerol. 7.5 μl
diluted (1:14) culture was added to 75 μl PCR reactions
containing 37.5 μl custom 2X Platinum PCR supermix
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.3 μl of 100 μM forward and
reverse primers (representing the vector sequence flanking
the cDNA inserts). PCR parameters were as follows: Initial
denaturation at 95°C, 10 min. followed by 35 cycles of
95°C, 40 sec., 65°C, 40 sec, 72°C, 3 min, and a final
extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were checked
by electrophoresis on E-gel 96 1% gels (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Failed reactions were reamplified as above
with the addition of 1 M Betaine to the PCR reaction. PCR
product was cleaned with Millipore PCR 96 cleanup plates
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). All liquid manipulations were
carried out in 96 well format on a Beckman Biomek FX
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cleaned product was
transferred to 384 well plates, dried in a speedvac and
resuspended in 3 × SSC and 1.5 M Betaine buffer for printing. using a GeneMachines OmniGrid 100 robotic printer
onto Corning GAPSII amino-silane coated slides. PCR
product sufficient for printing 1200 arrays was generated
during July-September, 2004.
Song stimulation
All procedures involving animals were conducted with
formal institutional (IACUC) approval and oversight. For
the microarray analysis, male zebra finches 3–17 months
old (age-balanced, two groups) were hatched and reared
(3 birds/cage; 12:12 light:dark cycle) in D. Clayton's aviary at the Beckman Institute, Urbana IL. During 2/20/
2005–3/10/2005, each was individually isolated in a
sound attenuation chamber for 46 hours, then exposed to
a 30 minute song playback (or silence) between noon and
1 PM. Behavioral responses were videotaped for subsequent quantification of a "listening" index [70]. At the
end of the 30 minute stimulation period, the birds were
immediately euthanized by decapitation, and the two
auditory lobules (AL) were dissected out [71], put into
RNAse-free 1.5 ml tubes and frozen on a dry ice/ethanol
mixture. Tissue was stored at -80°C until RNA preparation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

Microarray hybridization (Song stimulation experiment)
Total RNA was prepared with RNAqueous-Micro kit
(Ambion; average yield = 4 μg/AL-pair). 500 ng RNA was
amplified using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear
Amplification kit (Agilent; average yield = 25 μg). The
resulting aRNA was reverse transcribed using an indirect
aminoallyl incorporation protocol and labeled with
either Cy3or Cy5 dyes (GE Healthcare). Dye labeling was
balanced by group (i.e., half of each group, song or
silence, was labeled with Cy3 and the other half with
Cy5). Six arrays were hybridized simultaneously, each
array with one Song and one Silence sample. Thus each
array represents one of six biological replicate measurements of the song-vs-silence relationship for each spot on
the array. Slides were hybridized overnight at 42°C,
washed and scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B
microarray scanner. All slide images were analyzed using
GenePix Pro 6.0 software. Analyzed slide images were
manually edited and aberrant spots were flagged for exclusion in downstream analysis.
Statistical analysis of hybridization data (Song stimulation
experiment)
Prior to analysis, the fluorescence intensities were edited
by removing automatically and manually flagged spots
that did not surpass minimum quality thresholds. "Background" was defined independently for each spot from its
surround and subtracted from each spot value. The data
were log2 transformed and loess normalized within each
array. Analysis then proceeded using the two-step
approach of Cui et al. [72], where the normalized data
were first adjusted for global array and dye effects across
genes, then the resulting adjusted intensities were analyzed by gene with a parametric linear model [73-76]. This
model was implemented using Bioconductor R-routines
[77] and the MIXED procedure (SAS, 2004).

For the analysis of the five different zenk sequences (Figure
1, Table 6), replicate spottings of the same cDNA on one
array (e.g., the redundant spottings of the canary zenk
cDNA) were treated as replicate measurements, whereas
cDNAs representing different segments of the same gene
were treated as independent targets (e.g, each of the other
four zebra finch zenk cDNAs spotted once per array).
Production of Universal Reference RNA sample
Total RNA was prepared from whole telencephalon of 30
birds [3 males and 3 females from each of the aviaries of
Clayton, Wade, Arnold, Mello, and D. Perkel (University
of Washington)] using TRI Reagent (Ambion). The total
RNA was DNase I treated (Turbo DNase, Ambion) and
cleaned up on a spin column (RNeasy, QIAgen). Equal
amounts of RNA from each bird were pooled. Aliquots of
the pool were amplified (Low Input Linear RNA Amplification Kit, Agilent) and pooled. Sufficient cRNA for 5×

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:131

more arrays than necessary was generated and stored at 80 in small aliquots. A test hybridization of the reference
sample, labeled only with Cy3 (GE Healthcare), showed
signal detectable above background on greater than 95%
of probes.
Concordance of SoNG 20 K and Lund-zfa arrays
RNA samples were prepared from 11 individual zebra
finch brains (5 adult males, 6 adult females) and hybridized to SoNG 20 K arrays as described above for the Song
Stimulation experiment, except that a common reference
design was used. One male or female sample was hybridized to one channel of an array and the universal reference
sample was hybridized to the other channel of each array.
No technical dye-swaps were done; instead possible dyebias was controlled by putting the reference sample in the
Cy3 channel for ~ half the male and ~ half the female samples and in the Cy5 channel for the other half of the samples. After the analysis in the US the samples were kept at
-80°C for 2 months before they were shipped on dry ice
to an Affymetrix service provider in Sweden, the Swegene
Center for Integrative Biology at Lund University (SCIBLU
MARC) [78], where hybridizations to the Lund-zfa array
were performed. The experiments in the present study
used the initial version of the Lund-zfa array which was an
Affymetrix design spotted with NimbleGen technology
[15]. (Note that since then, the Lund-zfa Array has been
re-designed and the version currently distributed is spotted like any Affymetrix standard array.). Before hybridization the RNA samples were quality checked using a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer and RIN values were calculated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. One high quality
sample representing each of the 11 individuals was
hybridized according to standard Affymetrix protocols for
RNA. Five μg total RNA from each sample was used in the
regular protocols for GeneChip® Arrays and hybridized
onto the Lund-zfa Affymetrix array overnight in the GeneChip® Hybridisation oven 6400 using standard procedures. The arrays were washed and then stained in a
GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450. Scanning was carried out
with the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 and image analysis was
performed using GeneChip® Operating Software.

Pre-processing of each array type was done in R using Bioconductor packages appropriate for spotted or Affymetrix
arrays. Because > 98% of spots on the SoNG 20 K arrays
were above local background estimates, no background
correction was performed. Within-array printtip loess normalization was performed, as was a between-array scaling
normalization using the limma package [79]. For the
Lund-zfa arrays, pre-processing was done using RMA
(with the normal background correction included) [80].
The Lund-zfa array is a PM only array, with Perfect Match
probes arranged in a checkerboard pattern on the array
and 4 empty features adjacent to each PM probe [15]. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/131

used the signals from the 2% lowest empty features on the
chip (5111 features distributed throughout the spotted
area) + 2 standard deviations as an estimate of the global
background of each chip, and this background cut-off was
then used to calculated the percentage of present call
probes. To use the 2% lowest signals is a standard Affymetrix cut-off for background calculation. Both array types
were analyzed for differential expression using the limma
package, which fits a mixed linear model with an empirical Bayes error correction. Multiple test correction of the p
values was done using the false discovery rate (FDR)
method [81].
Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)
Tissue or blood was obtained from two males and two
females of each species. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was collected from each sample using the GenomicPrep Cell and
Tissue or Blood DNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare). gDNA
was digested with Hae III for 5 hours at 37°C and cleaned
using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (QIAgen). A reference sample was created by pooling equal amounts of
digested and cleaned DNA from 2 male and 2 female
zebra finches. Template DNA was polymerized from 4 μg
digested and cleaned DNA using high concentration Klenow (New England Biolabs) and incorporating aminoallyl dUTP (Sigma Aldrich) for 4 hours at 37°C. The
resulting amino-allyl labeled DNA was coupled with Cy
dye (GE Healthcare), cleaned, and hybridized using SlideHyb #1 hybridization buffer (Ambion). All experimental
samples were labeled with Cy3 and all reference samples
were labeled with Cy5. Slides were hybridized for 48 hrs
at 42°C, washed and scanned using an Axon GenePix
4000B microarray scanner. All slide images were analyzed
using GenePix Pro 6.0 software. Analyzed slide images
were manually edited and aberrant spots were flagged for
exclusion in downstream analysis. Normalization and statistical analysis [82] was performed using the TM4 software suite developed by TIGR. Slides were within-slide
LOWESS normalized using MIDAs.
