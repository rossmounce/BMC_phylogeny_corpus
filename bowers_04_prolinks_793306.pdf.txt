information

An enhanced understanding of the physical and functional
relationships between proteins has recently become attainable through the use of non-homology-based methods [2,3].
These methods infer functional linkage between proteins by
identifying pairs of nonhomologous proteins that coevolve.

Evolutionary pressure dictates that pairs of proteins that
function in concert are often both present or both absent
within genomes (phylogenetic profiles method), tend to be
coded nearby in multiple genomes (gene neighbors method),
might be fused into a single protein in some organisms
(Rosetta Stone method) or are components of an operon
(gene cluster method). In contrast, proteins not related by
function need not appear together or exhibit spatial proximity
in the genome. The complete sequencing of over 100 genomes
provides a rich medium from which to infer protein linkages
and function by analyzing pairwise properties using these
methods. Protein functional links may also be inferred from
automated text mining. Here we use a simple algorithm (TextLinks) to identify proteins that are often found together in
scientific abstracts [4].

interactions

Genome sequencing has allowed scientists to identify most of
the genes encoded in each organism. The function of many,
typically 50%, of translated proteins can be inferred from
sequence comparison with previously characterized
sequences. However, the assignment of function by homology
gives only a partial understanding of a protein's role within a
cell. A more complete understanding of protein function
requires the identification of interacting partners: interacting
subunits if the protein is a component of a molecular complex, and pathway members if the protein participates in a
metabolic or signal transduction pathway [1]. Knowledge of
these relationships, which we will call 'functional linkages', is
a prerequisite for understanding physiology and pathology.

refereed research

The advent of whole-genome sequencing has led to methods that infer protein function and
linkages. We have combined four such algorithms (phylogenetic profile, Rosetta Stone, gene
neighbor and gene cluster) in a single database - Prolinks - that spans 83 organisms and includes 10
million high-confidence links. The Proteome Navigator tool allows users to browse predicted
linkage networks interactively, providing accompanying annotation from public databases.
The Prolinks database and the Proteome Navigator tool are available for use online at

to explore interactively the protein links generated for 83
microbial organisms. Sequence, sequence homology, and
public annotation, including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG), Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COG) and National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) descriptions, are available for each protein. The network of predicted associations is tunable, based on an adjustable confidence limit. The network has 'clickable' nodes that
permit rapid navigation. Although this is not the first database that analyzes protein coevolution, it is in many respects
distinct from existing tools [5,6]. In the Discussion section we
analyze these differences. We also show how the Proteome
Navigator may be used to recover links between functionally
related proteins and between proteins contained within protein complexes. In short, this database extends the value of
existing tools for genome annotation.

Genomic inference methods

The four genomic methods used by the Proteome Navigator
are the phylogenetic profile, gene neighbor, Rosetta Stone,
and gene cluster methods. An additional method, named TextLinks, does not use genomic context to infer functional linkages, but instead provides an automated analysis of PubMed
scientific abstracts to infer protein relationships. Although
each approach has been previously reported, here we provide
the details of its implementation in the Prolinks database.

Phylogenetic profile method
The phylogenetic profile method uses the co-occurrence or
absence of pairs of nonhomologous genes across genomes to
infer functional relatedness [7,8]. The underlying assumption
of this method is that pairs of nonhomologous proteins that
are often present together in genomes, or absent together, are
likely to have coevolved. That is, the organism is under evolutionary pressure to encode both or neither of the proteins
within its genome and encoding just one of the proteins lowers its fitness. As in all of the above methods, we assume, and
later confirm, that coevolved genes are likely to be members
of the same pathway or complex.
Because sequenced genomes allow us to catalog most of the
proteins encoded in each organism, we can determine the
pattern of presence and absence of a protein by searching for
its homologs across organisms. We define a homolog of a
query protein to be present in a secondary genome if the
alignment, using BLAST [9], of the query protein with any of
the proteins encoded by the secondary genome generates an
E-value less than 10-10. The result of this calculation across N
genomes yields an N-dimensional vector of ones and zeroes
for the query protein that we call a phylogenetic profile. At
each position in the profile the presence of a homolog in the
corresponding genome is indicated with a one and an absence
with a zero. A schematic representation of the construction of
phylogenetic profiles is shown in Figure 1.

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/R35

Using this approach we can readily compute the phylogenetic
profiles for each protein coded within a genome of interest.
We next need to determine the probability that two proteins
have coevolved; this is based on the similarity of their profiles. If we assume that the two proteins A and B do not coevolve, we can compute the probability of observing a specific
overlap between their two profiles by chance by using the
hypergeometric distribution:

 n  N −n 
 

k m−k 
P ( k′ | n, m, N ) =   
N
 
m
where N represents the total number of genomes analyzed, n
the number of homologs for protein A, m the number of
homologs for protein B and k' the number of genomes that
contain homologs of both A and B [10]. Because P represents
the probability that the proteins do not coevolve, 1 - P(k >k')
is then the probability that they do coevolve. We compute this
probability for all pairs of proteins within a genome.

Gene cluster method
Within bacteria, proteins of closely related function are often
transcribed from a single functional unit known as an operon.
Operons contain two or more closely spaced genes located on
the same DNA strand. These genes are often in proximity to a
transcriptional promoter that regulates operon expression.
Various methods have been developed to identify operon
structure within microbial genomes [11-13], relying on intergenic distance as a predictor of operon structure.
Our approach to the identification of operons begins with the
assumption that gene start positions can be modeled by a
Poisson distribution, with each position having the same
probability of being a start site. In other words, if we consider
only the intergenic regions of a genome plus all the start sites,
the probability that a gene starts at any position is given by
P(start) = me-m where m is the total number of genes divided
by the number of intergenic nucleotides. It follows that the
probability that a gene does not start at a position is
P(position_without_start) = e-m and the probability of N - 1
sequential nucleotides without a start site followed by a start
site is P(N_positions_without_starts) = me-Nm. From this we
estimate the probability that two genes are separated by a distance less than N:
x

P ( separation < N ) = ∫ me −mN = 1 − e −mx
0

We assume that the probability that two genes that are adjacent and coded on the same strand are part of an operon is 1 P, as the more likely we are to find a greater intergenic

Gene neighbor method
Some of the operons contained within a particular organism
may be conserved across other organisms. The conservation
of an operon's structure provides additional evidence that the
genes within the operon are functionally coupled and are perhaps components of a protein complex or pathway. Several
methods have been reported that identify conserved operons
[14-16]. However, unlike the previous approaches, we have

separation the less likely two genes are to be part of an
operon. Although this is a very simple model of intergenic
spacing, it captures the basic biology that the closer two codirectional genes are, the more likely they are to be members
of the same operon. Unlike the other coevolution methods
described here, the gene cluster method is able to identify
potential functions for proteins exhibiting no homology to
proteins in other genomes.

The general mechanism of inference for each of the four methods used by the Proteome Navigator. (a) The gene neighbor (GN) method identifies protein
pairs encoded in close proximity across multiple genomes. We see in this example that genes A and B are gene neighbors while A and C are not. (b) The
Rosetta Stone (RS) method searches for gene fusion events. We see that the A and B proteins are expressed as separate proteins in one organism.
However, in a second organism a sequence exists that represents the fusion of the two proteins. The fusion protein is termed the Rosetta Stone protein
as it allows us to infer that the A and B proteins are functionally linked. (c) The construction of phylogenetic profiles (PP) begins with four sequenced
genomes, from which the protein sequences have been predicted. The protein sequence, A, within E. coli is compared to that of the proteins coded by the
other genomes and homologs are identified. If the genome contains a homolog of A, a 1 is placed in the corresponding phylogenetic profile position, a 0
otherwise. Genes with similar phylogenetic profiles are likely to participate in the same pathway. (d) The gene cluster (GC) or operon method identifies
closely spaced genes, and assigns a probability P of observing a particular gap distance (or smaller), as judged by the collective set of inter-gene distances.

developed a novel algorithm that generates a P value for the
likelihood that two proteins are coded within a conserved
operon. A schematic describing this method is shown in Figure 1, where genes A and B are found in close proximity on
four genomes, while gene C is positioned randomly.
Our approach, the gene neighbor method, first computes the
probability that two genes are separated by fewer than d
genes:

P(≤ d) =

2d
N −1

where N is the total number of genes in the genome. Note that
we must use the smaller of two values of d for two genes that
are coded on a circular plasmid or circular chromosome. If
the two genes have homologs in other organisms we compute
the product of the above probability across these organisms:
m

where m is the number of organisms that contain homologs of
the two genes of interest.
To compute the likelihood that two genes are components of
a conserved operon we need to compute the probability of
obtaining a value of X that is smaller than the observed value.
It can be shown that this probability is given by:

Rosetta Stone method
Occasionally, two proteins expressed separately in one organism can be found as a single chain in the same or a second
genome. Analysis of gene fusion/division events to infer functional relatedness, commonly known as the Rosetta Stone
method, is illustrated in Figure 1, and has been described in
detail elsewhere [17,18]. Proteins that carry out consecutive
metabolic steps or are components of molecular complexes
are often expressed as a single polypeptide chain to maximize
kinetic or expression efficiency.
To detect gene-fusion events we first align all protein-coding
sequences from a genome against the nonredundant database
using BLAST. We identify cases where two nonhomologous
proteins both align over at least 70% of their sequence to different portions of a third protein. We refer to the third protein
as the Rosetta Stone protein. When this situation arises we
hypothesize that during the course of evolution the ancestors
of the two proteins fused to form the ancestor of the Rosetta
Stone protein.

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/5/R35

A confounding aspect of this analysis is that many of the
alignments between the starting proteins and the Rosetta
Stone protein occur in regions of highly conserved domain
sequences, such as kinase or zinc finger domains. Proteins
that contain these common domains are often found linked to
each other by the Rosetta Stone method, even though they
may not have fused.
To screen out these confounding fusion events we compute
the probability that two proteins are found linked by the
Rosetta Stone method by chance alone:

 n  N −n 
 

k m−k 
P ( k′ | n, m, N ) =   
N
 
m
where k' is the number of Rosetta Stone sequences, n the
number of homologs of protein A and m the number of
homologs of protein B and N the total number of sequences in
the nr database [19]. In other words, if a protein has many
homologs in the database, possibly because it contains a common domain, it is likely to be linked to a second protein, even
though the Rosetta Stone protein did not evolve by a fusion of
this protein with another. Therefore, the probability that two
proteins have fused is given by 1 - P(k >k').

TextLinks
Just as the systematic presence or absence of coevolved genes
across genomes can be used to infer functional linkages, so to
can the co-occurrence of gene names and symbols within the
scientific literature be used to establish known gene interactions. Again, the underlying assumption is that genes, related
by function, will often appear within the same scientific article or abstract. For this analysis, we have used the PubMed
database [20], containing 14 million abstracts and citations,
as a basis set. Within abstracts, we identify the presence or
absence of individual genes using a controlled vocabulary of
gene names and symbols available for each genome at NCBI
[21].
As with the phylogenetic profile method, abstracts and individual gene names were used to develop a binary vector
describing each protein's distribution within the scientific literature. The result is an N-dimensional vector (where N is the
total number of abstracts) of ones (a protein name is found
within a given abstract or citation) and zeroes (the protein
name is absent) for the query protein. Using this approach,
we compute the literature profile for each protein coded
within a genome of interest. Finally, we compute the probability that two proteins are related, based on the similarity of
their literature profiles, using the same hypergeometric distribution function used for the phylogenetic profile and
Rosetta Stone methods:

information

Because each method is now measured according to the same
confidence metric, we combine all the methods by considering any pair of genes to be linked with a confidence given by
the maximal confidence of any method. The receiver operator
characteristic curve (ROC; Figure 2b) shows that the rankordered list of combined protein interactions recovers functionally related protein links with a 15-fold greater accuracy
than would be expected from a random selection of protein
pairs. From this analysis we conclude that pairs of genes that
function within the same pathway are likely to be coupled

Figure 2 shows how well each of the four coevolution methods
performs in recovering protein pairs that are assigned to the
same COG pathway. Based on this metric, the gene neighbor
method provides the most accurate and extensive coverage of
the four methods, whereas the gene cluster method is the
least accurate.

The current version of the Prolinks database contains linkages for 83 genomes. We list all the organisms in Table 1:
there are ten from the Archaea, five from the Eukaryota and
the rest are from the Bacteria. In total we have computed
18,077,293 links between proteins coded within these
genomes. As the number of fully sequenced genomes is constantly increasing, we expect that future versions of this database will contain significantly more data. The Prolinks
database may be accessed though the Proteome Navigator

The confidence metric for each prediction is derived from
COG pathway recovery [22]. For each method, inferences are
ordered by their intrinsic statistical metric (P-value) and the
cumulative accuracy with which COG pathway annotation is
recovered, starting from the most significant prediction, is
recorded for each pairwise prediction. Recovery means that
both proteins belong to the same pathway. Predicted pairs
with the same COG pathway annotation are treated as true
positive, while pairs assigned to different COG pathways are
considered false positive.

Each of the methods outlined above is statistical in nature,
allowing us to compute a probability associated with each
predicted interaction. However, the probability metrics from
different methods differ in scale, making direct comparison of
inference between methods problematic. To overcome this

We applied the four genomic inference methods to 83 fully
sequenced microbial genomes and the TextLinks approach to
Escherichia coli. The resulting calculation generates several
hundred thousand predicted protein associations for each
organism. In order to facilitate access to these data, we have
developed an online browser, the Proteome Navigator [23].

The opening page of the Proteome Navigator prompts the
user to identify a protein using a protein name, sequence
identifier or functional category (Figure 3). Note that if a protein is selected on the basis of an identifier, it may not be
coded within a fully sequenced genome contained in the database; in which case no Prolinks will be generated for the protein. To identify a related gene or gene name that is coded
within a fully sequenced genome, one may use BLAST against
the fully sequenced genome at NCBI.

we have developed to infer coevolution between proteins are
useful for detecting protein pairs that act within the same cellular pathways.

Additional graphing capabilities are also available, including
coloring of the protein nodes based on known KEGG or COG
pathway annotation and 'clickable' protein nodes. Clicking on
a given protein node within the displayed network prompts
the Proteome Navigator to perform a new search using the
chosen node as the beginning search protein and the same
search parameters as before. This operation allows the user to
navigate easily through the entire microbial network without
manually selecting new protein-search criteria.

sequence, known function(s), name and alias. Tabs at the top
of each page allow the user to examine known homologs of the
protein, the profile or distribution of homologous proteins
among the sequenced genomes, protein characteristics and
annotation, and the graph of the network of predicted interactions for the protein.
The graph function of the Proteome Navigator (Figure 4)
allows the user to navigate the network of predicted interactions interactively. The layout of the graph is determined
using a spring minimization algorithm. Each protein is connected by a 'spring' whose spring constant is proportional to
the number of links separating the nodes on the graph.
Because the minimization algorithm is seeded with a random
number, each time the graph is rerun it will generate a different layout.
The graph tab also permits the user to vary the scope and
attributes of the resulting network. For instance, the 'graph
order' function can be used to extend the network to include
all proteins that are linked within n interactions of the input
seed protein. Higher graph orders generate networks of
increasing size and complexity. A setting of graph order of 2
prompts the Proteome Navigator to first identify protein links
satisfying a minimum confidence threshold to an original
search protein. This original group of identified proteins is
then used to perform a secondary search using the same criteria. The original protein is displayed in the resulting network as a double-lined box located towards the center of the
graph. An example of such a second-order search and the

Another important feature of the Proteome Navigator allows
one to obtain detailed information on each link. In the Prolinks tab all of the links associated with the starting protein
are listed. Associated with each link is a 'detail' hyperlink that
generates a separate browser page that describes the underlying source for each link. For instance, in the case of phylogenetic profile links, the page reports the organisms that
contain the two proteins of interest, and the probability of
finding the observed number of matches between the two
profiles.

Example results
Chemotaxis
To illustrate the utility of the Proteome Navigator, we show a
network search starting with a known member of the E. coli
flagellar assembly, FliG. Specifying a confidence metric of 0.6
and graph degree setting of 2, we obtain the network shown
in Figure 4, colored by KEGG pathway categories.
In addition to identifying most components of flagellar biosynthesis, control and structure (FliS, Flit, FliA, FliL, FliA,
and so on; orange), this procedure also associates subnetworks of related function. These include the flagellar ATP
synthase complex (AtpA, AtpC, AtpB, AtpG, FliI; red, green,
blue), chemotaxis (CheR, CheB, CheY, CheZ, Tar, Tap; blue),
cell motility (MotA, MotB, CheA, CheW; blue), and osmolarity sensors (OmpR, EnvZ; aqua). Each functional category
sublocalizes within the network, providing an intuitive summary of the E. coli chemotaxis multiprotein complexes and
their interrelationships.
Previously uncharacterized proteins such as YkfC, shown in
gray in Figure 4, also appear within the network. We see that
YkfC has multiple links to the bacterial chemotaxis machinery
and would therefore predict it to have a function related to
chemotaxis. We note that YkfC has no sequence similarity to
the other chemotactic proteins. Hence this putative functional relationship has been discovered by non-homology
methods.
We also note that the network also contains some false-positive links. For instance, although OmpR and CheY are linked

This example illustrates one possible use of predicted networks, which is to the assign a function to uncharacterized
genes [24-26]. In the case of E. coli, only two thirds of the
genes have been functionally annotated, according to the
NCBI documentation. This leaves 30% of genes with no functional annotation using any of the standard homology-based
bioinformatics techniques. Using Prolinks, we can assign
putative functions to most of these 1,500 open reading frames
(ORFs).

derived from the fact that the two proteins often appear
together in abstracts, despite the fact that they do not physically associate.

While the ability of coevolution methods to identify functionally related proteins has been well established, it has been less
clear how well they recognize direct protein interactions. We

these predictions awaits further scientific inquiry.

Figure 5 illustrates the performance of each of the four methods in identifying components of multiprotein complexes. In
contrast to COG pathway benchmarking, gene cluster performs best among the methods, identifying 6,000 protein
interactions with greater than 83% accuracy, as judged by the
EcoCyc benchmarking. The phylogenetic profile method
identifies members of known E. coli complexes with an accuracy of 30% (greater than the 1% percent accuracy random
selection would provide), but the accuracy appears to be independent of the statistical confidence (P-value) of the prediction. On the basis of the totality of these benchmarking
results, the Prolinks database performs well in identifying
subunits of protein complexes.

In Figure 4b we show a network seeded with the lipolysaccharide pathway gene kdtA (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic-acid
transferase). This network involves six genes known to be
involved in the pathway. Along with the known genes we also
find other uncharacterized ORFs (gutQ, yrbH and yaeT) that
are also tightly linked to the cluster. We postulate from this
analysis that all three of these genes are likely to be involved
with the lipolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway.

Another example that demonstrates the pathway reconstruction and function assignment capabilities of Prolinks involves
the lipolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway. This pathway contains proteins that are involved in the formation from simpler
components of lipopolysaccharides, any of a group of related,
structurally complex components of the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria.

Unlike the Predictome database, the String database does
produce a score to estimate the accuracy of each pairwise
association. However, unlike the Prolinks database, which is
based on single proteins in a specific genome, the String database is constructed around COGs [22]. COGs are groups of
orthologous proteins across organisms that have been determined using sequence-alignment techniques. The use of
COGs rather than individual genes has both benefits and limitations. One of the limitations, as we will see in the example
below, is that the analysis generates a COG network that
includes COGs that may not be present in the organism you
are interested in. Another difference between the two databases is that Prolinks attempts to reconstruct the operon
structure of each organism, while String relies only on the
other three methods.

Existing coevolution databases

Two databases previously described as compiling information on coevolving proteins are Predictome [5] and String [6].
Although these databases use some of the same methods
described here, they differ from Prolinks in some important
respects.
Predictome, for instance, uses the gene fusion and phylogenetic methods to predict interactions between proteins. However, unlike Prolinks, there appear to be no statistical
measures to gauge the accuracy of each prediction. This is
potentially a significant limitation because, as we show in Figure 2, the accuracy with which these methods recover known

To compare Prolinks to the String and Predictome databases
we have downloaded all the functional links for E. coli in each
database. We obtained 407,520 links from String and 22,004
from Predictome in comparison with 515,892 links from
coevolution methods from Prolinks (that is, not including
TextLinks). For the links from String and Predictome, we
could not rank order the linkages as no quality measure is
provided. Therefore, in all cases we compute only averages for
the entire list.
To assess the quality of the lists, we computed the fraction of
links between proteins assigned to COG pathways that are
between proteins in the same pathway. In the case of String
we found that 17% of the annotated links were between proteins in the same pathway. When we took the top 407,000
links between E. coli proteins in Prolinks, we found that 20%
of the links between proteins assigned to a COG pathway were
between proteins in the same pathway.
Similarly, we also calculated the fraction of annotated links
that are between proteins in the same COG pathway for the
Predictome list of 22,004 links. In this case we found that
60% of the links were between intrapathway pairs. We compared this fraction to that obtained from the top 22,000 Prolinks linkages that gave 68%.
The conclusion from both these analyses is that by these
measures Prolinks predicts more physical and functional
linkages at higher accuracy than those presently contained in
the String and Predictome databases. Because COG pathways
were not used to generate the linkages, this is a rigorous test
of the capability with which linkages associate members of
the same pathway. We also note that Prolinks contains more
than ten times as many linkages as the Predictome database

In conclusion, on the basis of a comparison with linkages
from E. coli, we find that: Prolinks offers a greater number of
functional linkages than other databases; each link from Prolinks is assigned a confidence measure; and that our benchmarking reported here of Prolinks against COG pathways or
complexes compares favorably to the linkages contained in
String and Predictome.

We also used the EcoCyc database of known E. coli complexes
to test the frequency with which the three linkage lists
associate subunits of known complexes. In the case of String
we find that 4% of the linkages between proteins that are subunits of complexes are between subunits of the same complex.
In contrast, 9% of the top 407,000 Prolinks linkages between
subunits of complexes are intra-complex pairs. We also find
that 30% of the Predictome linkages between subunits of
complexes are intra-complex pairs whereas 32% of the top

and novel protein interactions within the E. coli genome. We
begin by using identical input parameters, which include a 1degree depth search, a 0.4 confidence setting, starting from
the protein AtpA. Each graph in Figure 6 identifies seven
additional members of the ATP synthase complex, including
AtpB, AtpC, AtpD, AtpE, AtpF, AtpG and AtpH. The Proteome Navigator also identifies nine protein interactions not
identified by the String database. For instance, FliI, a flagellar-specific component of the ATP synthase machinery, is not
found by in the String search, but is linked to the search protein AtpA, as well as five other components of the ATP synthase complex, by the Prolinks database. The Proteome
Navigator also predicts functional links to proteins known to
govern E. coli energy metabolism, GidB and GidA, and other
proteins of known chemotaxis- related function.

A final and substantial difference between the respective
databases is their ability to generate genome-specific graphs.
Because the String database uses a COG-based approach to
phylogenetic analysis and visual output, the information presented often contains linkages to COGs that are not present in
the starting organism. For instance, a starting search using
the E. coli gene fliG and a confidence limit of 0.4 identifies the
protein as belonging to COG1536. The linkage analysis by
String links COG1536 to COG1315, a predicted polymerase
family not present within E. coli yet included within the
resulting network. Graphs and linkages produced by the Proteome Navigator are always specific to the input organism
and protein, producing graphs that contain nodes colored and
clustered by known functional annotation, making their
interpretation intuitive and ideal for discovery.
In conclusion, Prolinks complements existing databases and
provides additional features and capabilities that are not
found in Predictome and String. As such, we believe that Prolinks represents a useful addition to the suite of tools that are
available to biologists to study protein functional linkages.

Discussion

Over the past few years significant progress has been made to
measure protein interactions and protein complexes in cells
using experimental approaches. Although the data have
proved valuable to biologists, they are still limited in their
coverage of organisms whose genomes have been fully
sequenced. The majority of protein interactions have been
measured within a single organism, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [28]. Although there is some value in extrapolating
interactions from one organism to another using homology,
several lines of evidence indicate that such an approach may
be error-prone [29,30]. Furthermore, the underlying interaction data in a single organism has been shown to contain a
large percentage of false positives [30].

To complement the directly measured data on protein interaction we have presented a comprehensive database of protein interactions inferred from 83 fully sequenced organisms
by coevolutionary methods. We have shown that the computational methodology that we utilize to identify inferred interactions is able to link proteins that function within the same
biochemical pathway as well as subunits of protein
complexes.
The potential uses of these inferred functional linkages are
several. By combining pairs of inferred linkages within a
genome, one can build up networks of functional links. These
give information on both protein complexes and metabolic
pathways that can be compared with more directly measured
information. The networks place proteins in their functional
contexts in the cell, and can thus be used to gain an expanded
view of the multiple functions of proteins within cells. This
