Abstract
Background: Members of a class of bHLH transcription factors, namely the hairy (h), Enhancer of
split (E(spl)) and hairy-related with YRPW motif (hey) (h/E(spl)/hey) genes are involved in vertebrate
somitogenesis and some of them show cycling expression. By sequence comparison, identified
orthologues of cycling somitogenesis genes from higher vertebrates do not show an appropriate
expression pattern in zebrafish. The zebrafish genomic sequence is not available yet but the genome
of Fugu rubripes was recently published. To allow comparative analysis, the currently known Her
proteins from zebrafish were used to screen the genomic sequence database of Fugu rubripes.
Results: 20 h/E(spl)/hey-related genes were identified in Fugu, which is twice the number of
corresponding zebrafish genes known so far. A novel class of c-Hairy proteins was identified in the
genomes of Fugu and Tetraodon. A screen of the human genome database with the Fugu proteins
yielded 10 h/E(spl)/hey-related genes. By analysing the upstream sequences of the c-hairy class genes
in zebrafish, Fugu and Tetraodon highly similar sequence stretches were identified that harbour
Suppressor of hairless paired binding sites (SPS). This motif was also discovered in the upstream
sequences of the her1 gene in the examined fish species. Here, the Su(h) sites are separated by
longer intervening sequences.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that not all her homologues in zebrafish have been isolated.
Comparison to the human genome suggests a selective duplication of h/E(spl) genes in pufferfish or
loss of members of these genes during evolution to the human lineage.

Background
Somitogenesis is the phase in embryonic development of
vertebrates during which the somites, that is segmented
mesodermal tissue along each side of the notochord, are
successively generated. Besides other models [1], the
"clock-and-wavefront" model [2] is able to explain somite
formation. This model proposes the existence of a cellular

clock that interacts with a slowly progressing wave (wavefront) moving along the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)
from anterior to posterior. Genes of the h/E(spl)/hey family have been identified in chicken and mouse that show a
cycling expression pattern, namely c-hairy1, c-hairy2, chey2, mhes1 and mhes7[3–9]. These bHLH proteins are
thought to obey the proposed molecular clock.

Analysis of the family of h/E(spl)-related genes in zebrafish has yielded 9 her-genes so far (her1-6: [10,11], her7
and her8 unpublished own work, accession numbers:
AF240772, AY007990, her9: [12]) and one member of the
hey class, called gridlock[13]. her1, her4, her6 and her7 are
thought to play a role in somite formation [14–16]. her4
and her6 are expressed in the developing nervous system
and in the anterior PSM of zebrafish embryos but they do
not cycle [10,17]. The her1[15,18] and the her7 gene (unpublished) are both cyclically expressed in the PSM during somitogenesis. Both genes are only distantly related to
the cycling c-hairy type genes from higher vertebrates. In
zebrafish, her9, the apparent orthologue of the cycling
genes from chicken and mouse does not show any expression at all in the PSM [12]. Therefore, it has been suggested that the zebrafish her1 gene is the functional
homologue to the cycling c-hairy type genes and thus an
element of the molecular clock. Alternatively, more than
two c-hairy type genes (her6 and her9) exist in zebrafish.
Since whole genome sequence information for zebrafish
is still missing, we chose to exploit the publicly available
draft sequence of the Fugu genome [19] to identify all the
H/E(spl)/Hey-related proteins of this organism. The evolutionary divergence time of both fish species is about 180
myr compared to 430 myr to tetrapods [20]. Hence, the
emerging picture might give us a clearer view on the situation of the h/E(spl)/hey-related gene family in zebrafish
than from comparison to higher vertebrates. Due to a remarkable conservation of exon-intron structure of the h/
E(spl)-related genes from insects up to man, it is possible
to annotate the proteins of this family on the level of genomic sequence for Fugu rubripes. Since the automatically
performed annotation was not able to correctly predict
the protein sequences (the N- and/or C-termini often were
missing), it became necessary for comparative analysis to
re-compile the sequences on the basis of an exon-intron
dataset of known h/E(spl) genes.
It has been shown, that the pufferfish Fugu rubripes possesses a very small genome with a size of only 400 Mb
[21]. Compared to zebrafish or man the genome size in
pufferfish is 4 to 8 times reduced. This reduction refers
mostly to the intergenic regions and repetitive elements,
while Fugu seems to possess a similar gene set with the
same structure than mammalian organisms [22]. Comparison of promoter sequences from homologous genes
in both fish species should facilitate the identification of
candidate transcription factor binding sites.

Results and Discussion
In the genome of Fugu rubripes significantly more h/E(spl)/
hey-related genes were identified than in Danio rerio are
currently known
Screening of the genomic sequence database of Fugu rubripes with the so far known zebrafish "Hairy and Enhanc-

er of split"-related (Her) proteins by the TBLASTN
program [23] revealed 20 h/E(spl)/hey-related genes in
Fugu (table 1, see additional file 1, additional file 2 and
additional file 3. A BLASTN search with the compiled
genes against the available cDNA database [ftp://
ftp.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/pub/fugu/fugu_cdna.zip] gave no
matches, indicating that the dataset (3142 entries) is too
small. All assembled sequences showed conserved exonintron boundaries and no unexpected stop-codons, suggesting that the genes are functional. In general, the Fugu
proteins were named according to their overall similarity
to the zebrafish Her proteins. To reveal the relationships
within the bHLH proteins of Fugu rubripes the sequences
were aligned (fig. 1) and a corresponding tree was calculated (fig. 2A). The Fugu proteins could be clearly divided
into the three classes Enhancer of split type (3 members,
fig. 2A: orange box), Hey type (5 members, fig. 2A: light
red box) and Hairy type (12 members, fig. 2A: bluegreen,
light green, dark green and violet boxes).
In more detail: Deduced from the intronless genomic
structure, which is indicative for E(spl) genes in Drosophila
melanogaster[24], FrHer2 (T002603/1) and both Her4
proteins (T002603/2, T002289) were identified as Enhancer of split type proteins. Fugu her2 and one of the her4
genes are located close to each other in a head to tail orientation on contig T002603 (see additional file 2). However, FrHer2 (T002603/1) does not cluster with the other
2 Enhancer of split type proteins in the tree.
Five Fugu proteins were classified as Hey (4) or Hey-related (1) compared to only one currently known zebrafish
member of that class, called Gridlock [13]. Homologues
for each of the hey or hey-related genes in Fugu have already been isolated in higher vertebrates [5,25,26] or were
previously annotated in the genbank database (accession
number: XM_068025 for "bHLH protein similar to
hhesr1/hey1"). The C-terminal consensus sequence of the
Hey proteins is KPYRPWGTE(IHey1/VHey2)GAF. Focussing
on this consensus, FrHey1.1 (contig T004546), FrHey1.2
(contig T000531) and FrHey2 (contig T014948) could be
determined for the pufferfish (table 1 and fig. 1). Interestingly, all 3 proteins show at least one exchange to the Cterminal consensus sequence. According to the similarity
in the bHLH-domain the two other proteins in contig
T003476 and T005657 belong also to the Hey type proteins (fig. 1). However, like mouse HRT3 ([27], accession
number: AF172288) FrHey3 (contig T005657) possesses
the TEIGAF motif but deviates to a higher degree from the
YRPW-motif. The other protein (in contig T003476) does
not possess a KPYRPWGTE(IHey1/VHey2)GAF motif at the
C-terminal end. Instead a completely diverged amino acid
sequence is present. Furthermore, the basic domain is
somehow truncated (fig. 1, see additional file 4). Interestingly, this protein consists of 4 exons. This is in contrast to

the other identified Hey-genes, which have 5 exons in human and Fugu (see table 1). Nevertheless, the human orthologue, defined as "bHLH protein similar to Hesr-1/
Hey1" (accession number: XM_068025, table 1, additional file 4) shows equal aberrant features from the Hey-type
genes. Therefore, we will refer to the hey-related gene in
Fugu as Frhhesr1-related.
12 identified pufferfish proteins belong to the Hairy class
of bHLH transcription factors that can be further subdivided into 3 branches. 5 proteins belong to the c-hairy type
class compared to two genes known so far from zebrafish

(fig. 2: bluegreen box). At a first glance, in the second
branch at least two of three proteins seem to be the zebrafish orthologues Her1 and Her7, which are involved in
somitogenesis (fig. 2: violet box). A detailed analysis of
the c-Hairy type class as well as of the Her1/5/7 is given in
the following sections. The third branch consists of three
proteins that are related to the zebrafish Her8 (table 1, fig.
2: light green box).
Comparing both fish species, the number of h/E(spl)/heyrelated genes in pufferfish is twice the number of these
genes currently known from zebrafish. Evidence from

Hox cluster analysis suggests that the extent of duplication
in Fugu, if any, is far less extensive than in zebrafish [28].
Therefore, it is likely that more h/E(spl)/hey-related genes
in zebrafish exist. Deduced from the comparative tree it
can be estimated that at least for hey type genes and in particular for genes of the c-hairy type class further zebrafish
homologues have to be expected.
A screen with the 20 conceptually translated Fugu proteins
against the human genomic sequence database yielded 10
h/E(spl)/hey-related genes (for accession numbers see Materials and Methods). These 10 genes can be further divided into 6 h/E(spl) genes, 3 hey genes (hey1, hey2, heyL, [26])
and 1 hey-related gene (hhesr1, accession number:
XM_068025). In Fugu, 15 h/E(spl) genes, 4 hey-genes and
1 hey-related gene were identified. Deduced from the sequence alignment of the Hey type proteins (see additional
file 4), FrHey1.1 and FrHey1.2 are similar to human
Hey1, FrHey2 is similar to human Hey2 and FrHey3 is
similar to human HeyL. One copy of the hey-related gene
exists in both genomes (hhesr1, accession number:
XM_068025, and Frhhesr1). While the set of Hey- and Heyrelated genes is quite comparable in both organisms, the
number of h/E(spl) genes in Fugu (15) is 2.5 times higher
than in the human genome (6). This indicates a duplication of those genes in Fugu or loss of members of the h/
E(spl) genes in human. It is not known how these genes
are expressed in Fugu but interestingly the majority of the
zebrafish her genes is expressed in subsets of differentiating neuroblasts during nervous system development
([10,12,29]; her8 unpublished). Since fish possess a
unique set of neurons and sensory organs, compared to
higher vertebrates, it might be that selective duplication of
the hairy genes was one source that led to neuronal/sensory cell diversification.
A novel class of c-Hairy proteins exist in the genomes of
two pufferfish species
The 5 c-Hairy type proteins of the Hairy class of bHLH
transcription factors in Fugu rubripes can be divided into
three distinct c-Hairy subclasses, namely the c-Hairy1
class and c-Hairy2 class [4] and a third novel c-Hairy class,
which we will refer to as the c-Hairy-related class since no
apparent orthologue from chicken is known so far. Members of the three subclasses can be distinguished by length
of the amino acid sequence between the orange domain
and the WRPW motif (fig. 3). FrHer9 (in contig T000078)
possesses the longest amino acid sequence stretch between the two domains and therefore belongs to the cHairy1 class, like zebrafish Her9 [12].

In FrHer6.1 (in contig T007628) and FrHer6.2 (in contig
T000396) a sequence stretch of around 30–40 amino acids just N-terminal of the WRPW-motif is missing compared to c-Hairy1 class members (fig. 3). This feature is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/21

indicative for c-Hairy2 class proteins [4]. Thus, FrHer6.1
and FrHer6.2 belong to the c-Hairy2 class and can be considered as Her6 homologues.
Deduced from the high conservation in the bHLH domain to the other c-Hairy proteins, FrHer10.1 (in contig
T000956) and FrHer10.2 (in contig T008912) constitute
a third to our knowledge novel c-Hairy class. In both proteins a sequence stretch of around 40 amino acids is missing, like in the c-Hairy2 class. In addition, a second stretch
just C-terminal to the orange domain is absent compared
to the already known two classes (fig. 3). Proteins of this
c-Hairy type are so far not known in other vertebrates.
However, these two Fugu proteins show similarity to the
Hes2 proteins from mouse and human (fig. 3). But in the
Hes2 proteins the number of amino acids between the orange domain and the WRPW motif is even more reduced
in comparison to the c-Hairy-related proteins. To elucidate whether the class of c-Hairy-related proteins is
unique in Fugu, the shotgun sequences of Tetraodon nigroviridis were screened with the 5 Fugu c-hairy type nucleotide sequences. Like in Fugu, the two c-Hairy-related class
members (TnHer10.1 and TnHer10.2, TnHer10_1 and
TnHer10_2 in fig. 3) and also the second member of the
c-Hairy2 class were found (TnHer6.2, TnHer6_2 in fig. 3)
supporting that respective proteins have to be expected in
zebrafish.
Is the zebrafish her1/7 gene complex conserved in pufferfish?
One branch of the tree consists of the Fugu homologues of
zebrafish her1, her5 and her7 (see fig. 2B violet box and table 1). The her1 and her7 genes in zebrafish have been
shown to be cyclically expressed and are thought to play
an important role in somitogenesis. Besides, they are arranged in a head to head orientation (accession number:
AF292032). In contrast, Frher1 (in contig T002307) is orientated in the same manner to Frher5. Frher7 was identified on another contig (T014589). But sequence similarity
does not strictly mean functional similarity. It has been
shown that the specificity of the biological action in vivo
of proteins of the H/E(spl) family is mediated by the orange domain [30]. Sequence comparison of the orange
domain of FrHer5 with zebrafish Her7 and Her5 shows
that the domain from the Fugu protein is equally similar
to that of the zebrafish proteins (fig. 4). Besides, FrHer5
possesses a prolin residue C-terminal of the WRPW motif,
which is indicative for Her7/Hes7 proteins of zebrafish,
mouse and human. Moreover, in the FrHer7 basic domain
the prolin residue, which is necessary for the repressive
function by binding to N-boxes [31], is missing. Instead,
a histidin residue is present at this position (fig. 4). Additionally, the loop region of FrHer7 is shorter in comparison to zebrafish Her7. Length differences in the loop
region are known to be responsible for functional specifi-

sophila melanogaster and higher vertebrates, respectively
[33,34]. One of the binding sites occurs in a reverse orientation to the other. Furthermore, a hexamer motif, which
lies between or within the motifs, has a functional aspect.
Although the promoters consist of identical regulatory elements, on the level of nucleotide sequence they can be
divided into two groups that correspond to the c-Hairy1
and c-Hairy2 protein classes (fig. 5). In particular, this
classification is even reflected in the intervening regions of
the two Su(h) sites of the identified SPS motifs. Thus, the
promoters of the c-hairy class genes show more similarities
within their classes in different species than among themselves in the same species.

city [32]. All observed differences indicate that FrHer7 is
not the functional equivalent of zebrafish Her7. Furthermore, the Her1, Her5 and Her7 proteins in Tetraodon
show identical characteristics as the Fugu proteins (fig. 4).
Conclusively, evidence from sequence analysis implies
that the Fugu her1/5 gene complex is equivalent to the zebrafish her1/7 gene complex.
Promoters of c-hairy1 and c-hairy2 type genes can be classified into two distinct groups
In the upstream sequences of the c-hairy1 and c-hairy2
class genes Frher6.1 (T007628) and Frher9 (T000078) a sequence stretch of approximately 100 nucleotides matches
with the proximal part in the promoters of x-hairy2a and
hhes1. The corresponding promoter parts of the orthologous genes in Tetraodon and zebrafish show identical composition, organisation and localization of the regulatory
elements with respect to the 5' end of the corresponding
gene (fig. 5). The fish her6 and her9 upstream sequences
consist of a CCAAT-box, a TATA box and a SPS motif. It
has been shown that this site is a crucial element in the
regulation of the x-hairy2a gene, which is responsible for
the (striped) expression in the PSM in Xenopus[33]. The
SPS motif is a bipartite binding site for the Suppressor of
hairless protein. The binding sites are separated by 30 or
29 nucleotides in the promoters of E(spl) genes of Dro-

Identification of potential regulatory motifs in zebrafish
her1
The zebrafish her1/7 gene complex was compared with the
Fugu her1/5 gene complex. The intergenic region of zebrafish is 11.4 kb large (accession number: AF292032),
the region of Fugu consists of 2.4 kb. Alignment of the
intergenic regions of the two clusters did not show large
sequence stretches of significant similarity. Since conservation of promoter sequences most of the time show functional regions the reverse must not be true [35]. Therefore,
we comparatively analysed the zebrafish her1/7 promoter
with the upstream sequences of the Fugu her1/5 gene complex and Tetraodon her1 by MatInspector [36]. First, we focused on potential Su(h) binding sites in the pufferfish
promoters since Fugu and Tetraodon are closely related. Reexamination focussing on Su(h) sites that are able to constitute a SPS motif yielded one site in the intergenic region
of the Fugu her1/5 gene complex and in the upstream sequence of Tetraodon her1 (table 2). The SPS sequences in
the her1 promoters of both pufferfish deviate from the
other sites identified so far. In both Su(h) sites of Tetraodon her1 one nucleotide exchange is present at the same
position. Both SPS sequences in Fugu her1/5 and Tetraodon
her1 show a distance of 32 nucleotides between the two
Su(h) binding motifs (table 2). Deduced from this data
we suggest that: 1. The distance between the two Su(h)
sites has to be expected in the range of 29 – 32 nucleotides
for fish. 2. Single exchanges to the GTGGGAA consensus
might exist. Taking these parameters into account examination of the zebrafish her1/7 promoter yielded one SPS
candidate sequence (table 2). The two potential Su(h)
sites have a distance of 31 nucleotides and a hexamer motif. Both sites deviate from the GTGGGAA consensus. Nevertheless, for the Su(h) protein of Drosophila it has been
shown, that it binds to oligonucleotide sequences with
the consensus RTGRGAR [34]. At least one binding site
matches to this consensus. The second Su(h) site deviates
in one position from the identified motifs in pufferfish.
However, it has to be experimentally verified, whether the
identified SPS sequences in this study are targets for tran-

scriptional regulation. Screening with a model according
to these findings gave no further SPS motifs in the upstream sequences of the other Fugu genes than already
identified (see Materials and Methods).
In Xenopus, it has been shown that the SPS regulatory motif and a specific 3'UTR element are sufficient to drive mesoderm expression [33]. Since the zebrafish her1 gene is
exclusively expressed in the PSM, we assume that SPS sequences are specific mesoderm regulator elements in fish
and presumably in vertebrates.
Unusual high degree of conservation in the promoter of
the hesr1-related gene of zebrafish, human, mouse and
Fugu
To detect conserved regions, the upstream sequences of
the Fugu genes, for which we could identify the first exon,
were compared with the "genbank" database at NCBI by
using the BLASTN algorithm under low stringency conditions [23]. Only in the case of the upstream sequence of

Frhhesr1-related (in contig T003476) and the corresponding human, mouse and zebrafish promoters (fig. 6; see
Materials and Methods for retrieval of the sequences from
the different organisms) an extraordinary high degree of
similarity was observed. The sequences are not conserved
over the entire length. Highly conserved blocks are disrupted by diverged sequence stretches between the different species. The conserved blocks do not seem to contain
any regulatory motif characterized so far. It is unlikely that
the conserved regions do code for a protein. By using
GENSCAN [http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html] one
potential exon 500 bp upstream of the Start-Methionine
in Fugu was identified, which is not conserved in mouse
and human. However, a BLASTP search for the deduced
31 amino acid long peptide gave no significant similarities. A sorted six-frame translation with the Fugu sequence
with a minimum ORF size of 50 amino acids and any Start
Codon gave 18 ORFs that showed no remarkable similarities in a BLASTP search. Furthermore, a BLASTX search
over the entire sequence gave no positive results. Howev-

er, it cannot be excluded that so far uncharacterized miRNAs (reviewed in [37]) are encoded within the conserved
regions. Nevertheless, it would be worthwhile to investigate if this sequence truly represents a promoter and what
function the respective protein carries out.

Conclusions
By analysing the genome database of Fugu [http://
Fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/] 20 h/E(spl)/hey genes in Fugu were
determined, compared to 10 currently known members of
this family in zebrafish. Deduced from this data, at least
for hey type genes and in particular for genes of the c-hairy
type class further zebrafish homologues have to be expected. A novel c-hairy type class could be identified in Fugu
and Tetraodon that is so far not known in other vertebrates.
Since no apparent orthologue from chicken exists, we refer to this class as the c-hairy-related class. Indicative for
this class is the difference in length of the amino acid sequence between the orange domain and the WRPW motif
compared to the already known two classes. Although the
upstream sequences of the c-hairy1 and c-hairy2 class
genes show identical composition of regulatory elements

in zebrafish, Fugu and Tetraodon, the classification coming
from protein sequence analysis is reflected in the promoter regions on the level of nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, the identified SPS motifs in the promoters of the
analysed c-hairy1 and c-hairy2 type genes are highly conserved, shown by comparison with higher vertebrates. For
the SPS motif in the her1 upstream sequences of the analysed fish species longer intervening sequences between
the Su(h) sites were observed. Deduced from mesoderm
specific expression of the her1 gene in zebrafish, we suppose that the "Suppressor of hairless paired binding site"
is a specific mesoderm regulator in fish and presumably in
vertebrates.

Gene identification and sequence retrieval
By using the TBLASTN program [23] the Fugu database
(first release from 25.10.01) at the UK HGMP Resource
Centre [http://Fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/][19] was screened
with the 9 different Her proteins of Danio rerio. The accession numbers of the used zebrafish bHLH genes are: her1:
X97329, her2: X97330, her3: X97331, her4: X97332, her5:

X95301, her6: X97333, her7: AF240772, her8: AY007990,
her9: AF301264. The TBLASTN results were screened manually for the occurrence of sequence motifs known to be
conserved in H/E(spl)-related proteins. These motifs are
the basic domain with the consensus sequence KPx(M/V/
I)E(K/R)(R/K)R, the highly conserved second loop with
the consensus sequence (L/V)EKA(D/E)(I/V)LE and the
WRPW motif located at the C-terminal end of the proteins. For further analysis, at least two of these motifs had
to occur in a reasonable distance within a contig. Because
the N- and/or C-termini often were missing in the automatically annotated proteins [http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
fugu/index.html], a training set for identification of the
exonic regions was created, which contains the following
known hairy genes: Drosophila hairy: X15904, human hes1:
L19314, mouse hes1: D16464, mouse hes7: AB050104, zebrafish her1 and her7: AF292032 (see additional file 5).
The regions of coding sequences, which we have conceptually translated into the respective proteins of Fugu rubripes, are depicted in table 1. Sequence LGS99222 was
used for identification of the FrHer6.1 C-terminus
(PAAVSPGAPSGNTDSVWRPW). Sequence LGS286123
was used for identification of the FrHey1 C-terminus
(WGLEIGAF). The BLASTX algorithm [38] was used to
identify the closest relatives to the Fugu Her proteins in zebrafish and higher vertebrates (table 1).
For identification of the c-hairy homologues as well as
her1, her5 and her7 in Tetraodon nigroviridis the corresponding Fugu sequences were used to screen the shotgun
sequence database at genoscope by BLASTN [http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/tetraodon/Ressource.html] and the trace archive [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?]
at
NCBI
using
megaBLAST. The Sequences, which are described here, can
be retrieved at the Ensembl Trace Server [http://trace.ensembl.org] or at the NCBI Trace archive [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?]. Sequences with the

Promoter identification and sequence retrieval
For examination of the corresponding promoter regions 2
kb upstream of the Start-Methionine were used in a
BLASTN search [23] to detect conserved regulatory elements. Search for potential transcription factor binding
sites was done using the MatInspector program [36]. Due
to bad sequence reads we were not able to identify the first
exon in 4 genes (indicated with n.d. in table 1), which
were therefore excluded from upstream sequence analysis.

For identification of the zebrafish her6 and her9 upstream
sequences the corresponding cDNA sequences were used
for a blastn search against the trace archive at NCBI. The
sequences with the accession numbers 15682371 and
25608918 were assembled for the her6 promoter. The first
53 nucleotides of the published her6 cDNA sequence were
found on a different sequence stretch. The sequences with
the accession numbers 25425900, 98681634, 15611875,
98577137, 100352443 and 102690745 were assembled
for around 1 kb upstream of her9 (see additional file 6).
For comparison of the promoter region of the Frhhesr1-related gene in contig T003476 (table 1) the corresponding
human sequence (accession number: 16931048, nt
18662–20664) was used for a BLASTN search against the
trace archive to obtain corresponding sequences of mouse
and zebrafish. The mouse upstream region was assembled
using trace archive files with the following accession numbers 34431248 nt 1–741 of 741, 20297240 nt 135–751 of
751 (reverse complement), 7193321 nt 1–628 of 705 (reverse complement) and 43361903 nt 272–942 of 942 (reverse complement). The zebrafish promoter was
compiled by utilizing the following files (accession numbers): 83152916 nt 1–602 of 612 (reverse complement),
30330598 nt 191–612 of 612 and 42667125 nt 1–612 of
612. All sequences are immediate to the first ATG of the
respective hhesr1-related coding sequence, except for zebrafish. Here, no sequence information about the 3'end of
this promoter as well as the beginning of the coding sequence was available. Potential exonic regions in the upstream sequence of the Frhhesr1-related gene were
investigated by GENSCAN [http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html] and potential ORFs were identified by BioEdit [39].
The SPS sequence in the upstream sequence of Frher9
(T000078) was identified at position 38130–38161. The
SPS sequence in the promoter region of Frher6 (T007628)
was localized at position 7320–7289 (reverse complement). The Frher1/5 gene complex was found in contig
T002307 and a corresponding SPS sequence was identified at position 8677–8643 (reverse complement). Deduced from the created dataset of SPS sites, we used
FASTM at Genomatix [http://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin/
fastm2/fastm.pl] to define a model for this motif for fish.
The model consists of two binding site elements separated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/3/21

by 20 to 45 nucleotides (distance from start of element 1
to start of element 2). Both elements had to occur on one
strand, the elements are defined as: GTGRRAR and
WTYMCAC. With this dataset, we re-examined all available upstream sequences of the Fugu genes for the occurrence of SPS sites.
Sequence comparisons and phylogeny
Alignments of amino acid sequences were done making
use of the CLUSTALW algorithm [40] in the program
BioEdit or by using the Pileup program of the GCG software package [41,42]. Phylogenetic trees based on these
alignments were computed by the Neighbor-Joining
method [43] with a bootstrap support of 100 replicates.
For the tree calculations the program PHYLIP [44] was
used. Trees were displayed using Treeview [45]. The program GeneDoc was used for displaying the alignments
[46]. For the alignment of the c-hairy homologues the accession numbers of the compared genes are: c-hairy1:
AF032966, c-hairy2: [4], mouse hes1: NM008235, x-hairy1:
U36194, x-hairy2A: AF383159. For comparsion, the
mouse hes2 (NM_008236) and human hes2 (CAB46198)
were used.

For alignment of the upstream sequences the DIALIGN
program [47] from Genomatix [http://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin/dialign/dialign.pl] was used.
