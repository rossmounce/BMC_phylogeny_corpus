Abstract
Background: In comparison to higher vertebrates, fish are thought to rely heavily on innate immune system for
initial protection against pathogen invasion because their acquired immune system displays a considerably poor
immunological memory, and short-lived secondary response. The endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPPs)
directly and rapidly killing pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses are included within the realm of
innate defenses. In addition to piscidins, AMPPs that in recent years have been shown to be commonly linked to
innate defense, are histones and their polypeptide fragments, and peptides derived from the respiratory protein
hemoglobin. There is evidence that a number of stresses lead to significant regulation of AMPPs and thus their
monitoring could be a highly sensitive measure of health status and risk of an infectious disease outbreak, which is
a major impediment to the continued success of virtually all aquaculture enterprises and is often the most
significant cause of economic losses.
Results: We firstly isolated and deposited in Genbank database the cDNA sequences encoding for hemoglobin-blike protein (Hb-LP) [GeneBank: JN410659], H2B histone-like protein 1 (HLP1) GenBank: JN410660], and HLP2 [GenBank:
JN410661]. The “de novo“ prediction of the three-dimensional structures for each protein is presented. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed on Hb-LP, HLP1, and HLP2 sequences of sea bass and those of other teleost, avian, reptiles,
amphibian and mammalian species. We then used real time RT-PCR technology to monitor for the first time in sea
bass, dynamic changes in mRNA copy number of Hb-LP, HLP1, HLP2, and dicentracin in gills, skin, eyes, stomach
and proximal intestine in response to acute crowding/confinement stress. We showed that acute crowding stress
induces an increase in the expression levels of the aforementioned genes, in gills and skin of sea bass, but not in
other tissues, and that this expression patterns are not always rapidly reversed upon re-exposure to normal
conditions.
Conclusion: The higher expression of the four target genes in gills and skin of sea bass suggests that this AMPP
represents a first and immediate line of defense in combating pathogens and stressors since these tissues
constitute the first physiological barriers of the animal.

Background
Antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPPs), consisting of small
proteins with antimicrobial activity, are humoral components of the vertebrate and invertebrate innate immune
system. In fish, the acquired immune response displays
a poor immunological memory and slow lymphocyte
proliferation [1,2] due to its evolutionary status [3] and

poikilothermic nature. For this reason the innate
immune system, which shows an instant and relatively
temperature-independent response, is of primary importance in combating infections [4]. Several AMPPs have
been isolated from fish, including commercially important species, such as misgurin in loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) [5], epinecidin in grouper (Epinephelus
coioides) [6], pleurocidin in winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) [7], moronecidin in hybrid striped
bass [8], pardaxin in sole (Pardachirus marmoratus) [9],
hepcidin in winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes

americanus), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and perch
(Perca fluviatilis) [10,11], parasin in catfish (Parasilurus
asotus) [12], and dicentracin in sea bass (Dicentrarchus
labrax) [13]. AMPPs are abundantly and typically
expressed in tissues that constitute the surfaces of access
for pathogen entry such as skin, gills, and the intestinal
tract, [14] but they are also found in peripheral blood
leukocytes and head kidney, which represents the primary organ involved in immune function [15-17].
In intensive aquaculture fish often have to cope with
several conditions of chronic or severely acute stress,
such as high biomass densities, that may compromise
their ability to resist disease. Today, antibiotics that are
effective and routinely used to treat human infections
are also used for animals, either for therapy or prophylaxis [18]. However, the use of antibiotics in animal feed
can promote the development of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, which can be transmitted to the general population, creating a serious worldwide crisis in both
human and veterinary medicine that would urgently
require new modes of antimicrobial action [14]. For this
reason, the use of antibiotics in animal feed is forbidden
or heavily controlled in most countries. AMPPs have
potent, broad spectrum activity, directly and rapidly killing pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and
viruses. Thus, these molecules have the potential to
increase resistance to infectious diseases. These diseases
constitute a major constraint in aquaculture, and
AMPPs contribute in a preventive manner to fish health
and welfare [19].
The mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides is
strictly related to their structure: most molecules are
relatively small (less than 100 aminoacid residues), and
contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues,
enabling insertion into biological membranes [10].
Microbial killing is a consequence of the interaction of
the AMPP with the microbial outer membrane, which
destabilizes the membrane in a disruptive or non-disruptive manner (intracellular target) [20]. In the first
case, channel formation alone promotes leakage of cytoplasmic contents, resulting in the death of the organism;
in the second situation, AMPPs enter the cytoplasm,
where interaction with cellular components induces the
microbial killing [8].
In fish, the structure of AMPPs makes it possible for
them to divide into different groups such as piscidins,
histone-like proteins (HLPs), and hemoglobin-like proteins (Hb-LPs).
Piscidins, first isolated from mast cells of the commercially cultured hybrid striped bass (white bass, Morone
chrysops, ♀ x striped bass, Morone saxatilis Walbaum
♂) [21], comprise a large number of AMPPs widely distributed in higher teleost families, such as Moronidae,
Serranidae, Sciaenidae, Cichlidae, Siganidae, and

Page 2 of 19

Belontidae [14,22]; they are linear, amphipathic, a-helical peptides, with a highly conserved N-terminus characterized by the consensus motif I-X5-H-X4-I-H [23]. It
has been demonstrated that the expression levels of piscidin 4 in gill tissue of healthy hybrid striped bass are
within concentrations that are lethal to important fish
pathogens [24]. Moreover, they are expressed to a significantly greater degree in healthy fish than in either
nutritionally stressed or in diseased ones [25]. Gene
expression of piscidins can be upregulated by integrating
immunomodulators such as Bio-Mos® in the food [26];
this promotes the nonspecific immune system in sea
bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), increasing the mRNA copy
number of the dicentracin in the head kidney [27].
Another group of broad spectrum antimicrobial molecules highly represented in fish are the histone-related
AMPPs, proteins highly homologous to histones (for a
review see [19]). HLPs were first isolated from the skin
of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) [28] and then
identified in the skin, gills, and spleen of hybrid striped
bass and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [29,30].
HLP-1 is the most common and most potent HLP and
it is highly homologous to histone H2B. Robinette and
Noga [31] measured HLP-1 in channel catfish skin
through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), detecting that chronic stress has a significant
suppressive effect on this molecule as compared to
levels in unstressed fish. The reduction in HLP-1
expression is neither affected by acute stressors nor correlated with disease status, features that – together –
make this peptide a promising indicator for monitoring
fish health. Other HLPs, histones or fragments of them,
are related to the innate immune response: HLP-2, for
example, which is highly homologous to histone H1,
oncorhyncin II, a histone H1-derived protein [32], and
parasin I, a peptide homologous to the N-terminal of
human histone H2A [12], from which hipposin is also
derived, isolated from skin of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) [33]. The participation of histonederived peptides in innate host defense has been
demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, where HLPs and their
peptide fragments are inhibitory to many important fish
pathogens, including bacteria such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio salmonicida,
Vibrio anguillarum, and Vibrio alginolyticus [19].
Like histones, whose main functions concern nuclear
regulation and chromatin structure in nucleosome, the
hemoglobins, which bind respiratory gasses, have also
been found to be a source of peptides with potent antimicrobial activity [34]. Both intact hemoglobin tetramers
and single alpha and beta subunits from various species,
including human, exhibited considerable activity against
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi [35].
A variant of the b-chain of hemoglobin, Hbb peptide 1,

Terova et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:69

is expressed in skin and gill epithelium of channel catfish (I. punctatus) in response to the ciliate parasite ich
(Ichthyophthirius multifillis) infection and the concentration expressed in vivo appeared to be well within the
antiparasitic concentrations measured in vitro [36].
As already mentioned, reared fish often face environmental conditions that are not ideal for their physiological functions. Sometimes these conditions cause the fish
to become stressed, decreasing immune capabilities and,
as consequence, promote outbreaks of infections [37,38].
As a result of chronic stress AMPP expression can be
downregulated [39,31] and at the same time increase
disease susceptibility. In contrast, upregulation of AMPP
expression can clearly protect against disease, as
reported for mammals [40-42] and in a number of studies with transgenic fish [43-46]. Therefore, antimicrobial peptides could be doubly valuable in aquaculture,
functioning as indicators of chronic stress to prevent
disease and as a new and promising class of
therapeutics.
Accordingly, in this study we investigate for the first
time in D. labrax, the most widely reared species in
Mediterranean aquaculture, the mRNA expression of
different AMPPs in different tissues after acute confinement/crowding stress with the aim to relate these
expression levels to the immediate early response of the
innate immune system.

Methods
Experimental design

Forty subadult sea bass (D. labrax, L.) of 187.13 ± 27.5 g
mean weight, obtained from Nuova Azzurro commercial
hatchery (Civitavecchia, Italy) were reared, with inconsistent mortality, at a low biomass density (less than 10
kg/m3) in a 2.5 m3 fiberglass tank connected to a water
recycling system supplied with about 24 parts of water
per day per day. The salinity (obtained by adding salt
Oceanfish 600 LT from Prodac Int. to dechlorinated tap
water) was 22 g/L.
Other water parameters were strictly controlled: temperature 21.8 ± 0.9°C, pH 7, total ammonia below 0.2
mg/L, and nitrite below 0.02 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen
(DO) was maintained at over 99% of the saturation
value by adding pure O2 to the system. A computerized
multiprobe Rilheva® system (Xeo4, Italy) was used to
continuously monitor DO, pH, and temperature in each
tank.
Fish were allowed to acclimate for 10 days before
starting the experiment; then five animals (mean weight
188.8 ± 54.9 g), representing the control group, were
randomly sampled. The other fish in the tank were
rapidly displaced by an opaque partition which confined
them to a small volume (less than 10% of the total tank
volume); the biomass density was thus increased

Page 3 of 19

approximately tenfold (from 3 kg/m3 to 29 kg/m3). The
confinement-stress was imposed for 4 hours, after which
five fish (mean weight 196.8 ± 39.6 g) were randomly
sampled. The normal biomass density was then restored
by removing the fiberglass partition from the tank, and
other five animals were sampled after 24 hours of recovery (mean weight 175.8 ± 26.3 g). The biometric data of
the animals sampled during the trial, are reported in
Table 1.
For the molecular biology analysis, gills, skin, eyes,
stomach, and proximal gut were isolated from fish of
each group (control, stressed, and recovered) for a total
of 75 samples. The tissues were immediately transferred
and then stored at -80°C until the time of the analysis.
AMPP genes isolation
RNA purification and first strand cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from gills, skin, eyes, stomach
and proximal gut using the PureYield RNA Midiprep
System (Promega, Italy) following the protocol. Briefly, 2
ml of ice-cold Lysis Solution containing b-mercaptoethanol were transferred to a 10 ml tube. Tissues of interest
were excised, placed in the tube and then homogenized
until no visible tissue fragments remained. Two ml of the
lysate prepared above were transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube, and 4 ml of RNA Dilution Buffer were added.
The tube was sealed, mixed thoroughly by inverting it 34 times, and vortex. One ml of thoroughly mixed Clearing Agent was added to the diluted lysate mixture which
was then mixed inverting 2-3 times, and vortex until
homogeneous. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 5
minutes to denature Tubes were then removed, and cool
at room temperature for at least 5 minutes. One blue
PureYield™ Clearing Column for each sample was
placed in a 50 ml collection tube. Each sample was mixed
by vortexing or vigorously shaking until homogeneous
and the mixture was immediately poured into the
assembled PureYield™ Clearing Column/collection tube.
The PureYield™ Clearing Column assembly was then
centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 2,000 × g at 2225°C for 10 minutes to clear the lysate. The blue Clearing
Column was discarded, whereas the cleared lysate was
saved in the collection tube. For additional information,
please see the PureYield™ RNA Midiprep System Technical Manual #TM279, available online at: http://www.

The quantity of the RNA was calculated at an absorbance of 260 nm. The integrity and relative quantity of
RNA was assessed by electrophoresis. After extraction, 3
μg of total RNA from proximal gut was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a volume of 12 μl containing 1 μl
of oligo dT16 primer (50 pmol) and 1 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs. This mix was heated at 65°C for 15 min and
chilled on ice, and then 4 μl of 5 × reverse transcription
buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 μl RNaseOUT, and 200
units of Moloney murine Leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase were added to a final volume of 20 μl, as
described in the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase kit
(Invitrogen). After incubation at 37°C for 50 min, the
reaction was stopped by heating at 75°C for 15 min.
Cloning and sequencing

To perform PCR, an aliquot of 4 μl of the resulting
cDNA was amplified with 1 μl GoTaq Polymerase (Promega) in 50 μl of final volume containing 5 μl buffer,
dNTPs 10 mM, and 50 pmol of each of the designed
AMPPs RT-PCR primer sets (Table 2). A total of 30
cycles (10 touchdowns) of the PCR amplification were
performed for all primer sets, using an automated Thermal Cycler (Mycycler, Biorad). The annealing temperatures depended on the melting temperatures of the
primer set used. An aliquot of each sample was then
electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer
(Eppendorf) and bands were detected by ethidium bromide staining. The positive control consisted in a master
mix of cDNA and cytoplasmatic b-actin primers [GeneBank: AY148350] [47], while the negative control consisted of total RNA added to the RT reaction mixture
without reverse transcriptase and subsequently amplified
using the same set of primers and the same conditions.
The negative control confirmed the absence of genomic
contamination. The PCR products from AMPPs primer
amplifications were cloned using the pGEM ® -T Easy
cloning vector system (Promega, Italy) and subsequently
sequenced in both directions (T7 and SP6).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Generation of in vitro-transcribed AMPP mRNAs for
standard curves

The absolute number of AMPP gene transcript copies
have been quantified by comparing them with a standard graph constructed using the known copy number
of mRNA of this gene. For this, a forward and a reverse
primer were designed based on each mRNA sequences
of the D. labrax genes we had identified, and on dicentracin cDNA sequence, already available in NCBI database [GeneBank: AY303949]. These primer pairs were
used to create templates for the in vitro transcription of
Hb-LP, HLP1, HLP2 and dicentracin mRNAs: the forward primers were engineered to contain a T3 phage

Page 4 of 19

polymerase promoter gene sequence to its 5’ end and
used together with the reverse primer (Table 2) in a
conventional RT-PCR of total sea bass skin RNA. RTPCR products were then evaluated on a 2.5% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide, cloned using
pGEM®-T cloning vector system (Promega, Italy), and
subsequently sequenced in T7 and SP6 directions.
In vitro transcription was performed using T3 RNA
polymerase and other reagents supplied in the Promega
RiboProbe In Vitro Transcription System kit according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The molecular weight (MW) of the in vitro-transcribed RNA for each gene was calculated according to
the following formula:
MW = (n◦ of A bases × 329.2) + (n◦ of U bases × 306.2) + (n◦ of C bases × 305.2) + (n◦ of G bases × 345.2) + 159

The results, concentrations measured as absorbance at
260 nm and the concentration of the final working solution are reported in Table 3.
Generation of standard curves for AMPPs

The mRNAs produced by in vitro transcription were
used as quantitative standards in the analysis of experimental samples. Defined amounts of mRNAs at 10-fold
dilutions were subjected in triplicate to real-time PCR
using one-step TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core Reagents
(Applied Biosystems, Italy), including 1 × Taqman buffer, 3 mM Mn(OAc)2, 0.3 mM dNTP except dTTP, 0.6
mM dUTP, 0.3 μM forward primer, 0.3 μM reverse primer, 0.2 μM FAM-6 (6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled
probe), 5 units rTH DNA polymerase, and 0.5 units
AmpErase® UNG enzyme in a 25-μL reaction. AmpErase® uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) is a 26-kDa recombinant enzyme encoded by the Escherichia coli uracil-Nglycosylase gene. UNG acts on single-and doublestranded dU-containing DNA. It acts by hydrolyzing
uracil-glycosidic bonds at dU-containing DNA sites. The
enzyme causes the release of uracil, thereby creating an
alkali-sensitive apyrimidic site in the DNA. The enzyme
has no activity on RNA or dT-containing DNA. For
Taqman® assays, AmpErase® UNG treatment can prevent the reamplification of carry over PCR products
from previous PCR reactions. When dUTP replaces
dTTP in PCR amplification, AmpErase UNG treatment
can remove up to 200,000 copies of amplicon per 50 μL
reaction. RT-PCR conditions were: 2 min at 50°C, 30
min at 60°C, and 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles
consisting of 20 s at 92°C, 1 min at 62°C. The Ct values
obtained by amplification were used to create standard
curves for target genes.
AMPP transcripts quantification by one-step TaqMan® realtime RT-PCR

100 ng of total RNA extracted from the experimental
samples was subjected to real-time PCR, in parallel to

Statistical analysis

The data were statistically compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
In silico analysis

The amino acid sequences of sea bass Hb-LP, HLP1, and
HLP2 were analyzed using the open reading frame
(ORF) finder program which is available at NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Nucleotide sequences were compared with other sequences available at the GenBank
database using the BLAST algorithm [48]. Sequences
were aligned using ClustalW program http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/clustalw, and Multiple Sequence Alignments Editor
& Shading Utility, GeneDoc, version 2.6.002 http://www.
psc.edu/biomed/genedoc.
Protein annotation

The analysis of the primary sequences of the three target AMPPs for annotation was performed at the MemPype server http://mu2py.biocomp.unibo.it/mempype
[49]. Other functional conserved domains were searched
at the PROSITE http://prosite.expasy.org/[50,51] and at
the Interpro 33.0 [52].
Tertiary structure

Because of the lack of a template for the proteins in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB), http://www.pdb.org/pdb/
home/home.do, a “de novo” prediction of the tertiary
structures of the putative proteins was obtained at the ITasser server http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ITASSER. The four stages of the method implement a
threading procedure, followed by structural assembly,
refinement of the model and structural-based functional
annotation. The output consists of five models. The first
model which is the most accurate is presented in results
section. The indexes of accuracy are the C-score, the
TM-score and the RMSD [53-55].
We used the UCSF Chimera software, release 1.5.3
(supported by NIH P41 RR001081, http://www.cgl.ucsf.
edu/chimera/) [56] to visualize, analyse and compare the
structural models.
Sites for posttranslational modifications
A) Phosphorylation and sumoylation

The serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites
were searched at the NetPhos 2.0 server http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/[57]; sites for sumoylation were
checked with the SUMOsp 2.0 program http://sumosp.
biocuckoo.org/[58].
B) Glycosylation

The glycosylation sites possibly present in the proteins
were searched at the server of the CBS (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, at the Technical University of
Denmark, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/.
Sites for the mucin-type mannosyl-O-glycosylation
(Net-O-glyc 3.1) [59], C-glycosylation [60], and the

Page 6 of 19

epsilon-glycosylation of lysine residues [61] were
searched. Sites for N-glycosylation were predicted at the
Center for Biological Sequence Analysis of the University of Denmark, the CBS prediction server, http://www.
cbs.dtu.dk/services/: the application automatically
searches the presence of signal peptide (Net-N-glyc 1.0)
[57,62]. After N-glycosylation sites were predicted,
further analysis was done at the Glycosciences server
http://www.glycosciences.de/modeling/. The GlyPro tool,
implemented by the server, evaluates, in the .pdb file
format, the availability of N-glycosylation sites not only
on the basis of their consensus sequence, but also
according to the accessibility of the Asn residue, whose
spatial coordinates (torsion angles) are given.
C) DNA binding

The DNA binding sites were searched and compared in
the primary structure of the two Histone-like proteins,
HLP1 and HLP2 with the tools BindN+ [63] and DPBind [64,65].
Both are upgraded software implemented on iterative
alignment across profiles of evolutionary conservation.
The first tool, predicting both RNA and DNA binding,
reaches prediction accuracy as high as 79% with equal
sensitivity and specificity, for the DNA-binding residues.
The second, dedicated to the DNA, is featured by accuracy of 77.2%, sensitivity of 76.4% and specificity of
76.6%.

Results

Creation of standard curves for absolute quantitation of
Hb-LP, HLP1, HLP2 and dicentracin

Sea bass AMPPs cDNA sequencing

At the beginning of this research, the cDNA sequence
coding for sea bass dicentracin was available at the
NCBI Genbank database [GeneBank: AY303949] [13].
The coding sequences for the other three target genes:
Hemoglobin-b like protein (Hb-LP), H2B histone like
protein 1 (HLP1) and H1 histone like protein 2 (HLP2),
conversely, were not available in public databases. Thus,
a BlastN search was performed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/BLAST/ on the complete, nonredundant Genbank
nucleotide database for orthologues of these genes in
other fish species. A multiple sequence nucleotide alignment http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw was then carried out
on coding sequences and a strategy based on regions of
strong nucleotide conservation was used to design the
primers.
In the case of Hb-LP, the coding sequence was amplified using two sets of primer designed on conserved
regions within the coding sequences of sea bream
(Sparus aurata) [GeneBank: AJ277207] and rainbow
trout (O. mykiss) [GeneBank: NM_001124187]. With
these primer pairs (Hemoglobin forward1 + Hemoglobin
reverse1 and Hemoglobin fw2 + Hemoglobin rv2),
(Table 2) we obtained two cDNA fragments, of 201 and

The correct template lengths, including the T3 promoter, were verified by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Quality and purity of mRNAs were confirmed by the
ratio of absorptions at 260/280 nm, i.e., 1.8-2.0.
To obtain threshold cycle (Ct) values for the target
genes, defined quantities at 10-fold dilutions of in vitro
transcribed mRNAs were subjected to a one-tube twostep real-time RT-PCR. The standard curve created for
Hb-LP, HLP1, HLP2 and dicentracin was based on the
linear relationship between the Ct value and the logarithm of the starting amount.
AMPP expression patterns in response to acute stress

Total RNA from sea bass tissues was subjected to realtime RT-PCR using the standard curve method to determine absolute amounts of each target gene mRNAs in
these tissues. This analysis revealed that the AMPPs
being considered are mostly expressed in gills and skin
(Figures 1, 2, 3), where we also observed a significant
change in their expression after acute stress. After four
hours of confinement stress at high biomass density the
mRNA levels of dicentracin, Hb-LP, and HLP2 significantly increased in gills and skin as well, but we did not

gills, skin, eyes, stomach and gut, and it was normalized as a ratio to 100 ng total RNA. Fish were sampled before stress (control), after 4 hours

detect any variation in their expression in stomach, eyes,
and gut in any of the tested groups (Figures 1, 2, 3). On
the contrary, HLP1 expression was upregulated after
confinement stress in all the tissues examined, except
for the gut (Figure 3).
After 24 hours of recovery, the levels of dicentracin
and HLP2 mRNA in the gills were still high, whereas in
the skin the expression had returned to the control
group values (Figure 1). Hb-LP mRNA levels decreased
in gills and skin of the “recovered” group, reaching the
control value only in the skin (Figure 2). HLP1 gene
expression decreased in gills, skin, stomach, and eyes as
compared to the expression levels of the stressed group,
but only in the gills and eyes did it return to the control
group levels (Figure 3).
In silico analysis

A complete set of bioinformatics analysis was carried
out to characterize the three AMPPs isolated in D. labrax and here described.
Protein annotation

The AMPPs here considered are deprived of signal
peptide, transmembrane domains and glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchor. Annotation at the Mempype

server classifies them as globular protein; the Hb-LP is
strongly predicted to be localized on internal membrane, and the HLP1 and 2 in the chromosomes or
nucleus.
According to the Gene Ontology (GO) entries, the
Hb-LP belongs to the hemoglobin complexes, devoted
to oxygen transporter activity in response to hypoxia.
The GO predicts for the HLP2 a very high probability
of binding (near 100%) for the DNA, and weaker (70%
ca.) for the proteins. Among the other biological processes mediated by this protein, the spermatogenesis is
the most probable (50%).
The second histone-like, HLP1, is instead better associated with protein binding (70% ca) than with DNA
(no more than 20-30%). Its role in cellular response
seems to be better defined in the field of defense
response to bacterial (either Gram-negative or Grampositive) infections mediated by the migration of mononuclear cell migration and by the activation of the plasminogen (50% ca.).
The amino acid sequence of the Hb-LP contains a
conserved motif, which is localised between the 5th and
138 th amino acids. This motif aligned with a score of
32.953 with the globin classified at the PROSITE entry

confinement/crowding (stress), and then after 24 hours of recovery from stress. The means of five animals in each group are shown. Bars

as PS01033. Two metal binding residues are also present
at positions H64 and H93.
The linker histone H1/H5 motif (hit PS1504 in PROSITE, score 23.208) is present in the chain of the HLP2,
between the amino acids 14 th and 87 th , whereas the
HLP1 does not contain any conserved motifs.
Tertiary structure

According to their globular nature, the predicted tertiary
structure of the AMPPs of D.labrax is dominated by
ordered alpha helices (Figure 4); two antiparallel beta
strands are present in the HPL2 (Figure 4B). I-Tasser
server predicted these structure with different degree of
accuracy, the C-score was high for Hb-like (C-score:
1.35, TM-score: 0.90 ± 0.06; RMSD: 2.0 ± 1.6 Å), and
HLP1 (C-score: 0.05; TM-score: 0.72 ± 0.11; RMSD: 3.5
± 2.4 Å), and lower for HLP2 (C-score: -2.57; TM-score:
0.42 ± 0.14; RMSD: 10.3 ± 4.6).
Sites for posttranslational modifications

No sumoylation sites are present on the three AMPPs,
but they could eventually undergo phosphorylation and
glycosylation: the predicted sites are shown in Figure 5.

Among the different types of glycosylation, the Cmannosylation was never predicted, whereas the O-GalNAc (mucin type) glycosylation sites were found only in
HPL1. They involve two threonine residues (T77 and
T79) near the C-terminus which could eventually
undergo phosphorylation. The prediction scores for T77
are fairly over the threshold for both the processes,
whereas the phosphorylation score for T79 is higher
(0.976 vs 0.545, threshold: 0.5).
A motif allowing the N-glycosylation is present only in
the Hb-LP, and it is centred on the residue N48
(48NLS50). Table 4 reports the spatial coordinates of this
site on the tertiary structure of the protein, as obtained
at the Glycosciences server http://www.glycosciences.de/
modeling/.
The most common type of glycosylation among those
predicted at the CBS server occurring on the three
AMPPs is the epsilon-type of lysine residues (Figure 5).
The process seems to extensively involve the HLP2
chain (Figure 5B) and the N-terminus of the HLP1 (Figure 5A) with generally high scores (range: 0.906-0.953 in
the Hb-LP, 0.523-0.940 in the HLP2 and 0.721-0.909 in
HLP1).

Phylogenetic analysis

To analyse the evolutionary relationship of sea bass HbLP, HLP1, and HLP2 with respect to other publicly
available, related genes in teleost, avian, amphibians,
reptiles, and mammalian species, we reconstructed a
phylogenetic tree for each gene (Figure 6).

The clustering pattern provides evidence that sea bass
Hb-like (Figure 6) is grouped with high bootstrap support in the lineage of other teleosts, sharing the highest
similarity with Japanese amberjack Hb-LP (82%), sea
bream (80%), red drum (80%), and red sea bream (78%)
whereas the avians (red jungle fowl, speckled teal),

amphibians (african clawed frog, marine toad), reptiles
(red-footed tortoise) and mammalians (thick-tailed
bushbaby, human, opossum, golden hamster) are
grouped into other distinct lineages.
Sea bass HLP1 (Figure 7) is also grouped with high
bootstrap support in the lineage of other teleosts, sharing the highest similarity with orange-spotted grouper
HLP1 (86%), Japanese medaka (86%), rainbow trout
(82%), and zebrafish (81%). Sea bass HLP1 shares a similarity of 82% and 83% with avians such as red jungle
fowl and turkey, respectively; of 84% with amphibians
(Japanese gliding frog); of 81% with reptiles (green
anole), and of 77-81% with mammalians (dog, giant
panda, horse, gray short-tailed opossum, platypus,
northern white-cheeked gibbon, human, chimpanzee,
and African savanna elephant).
Phylogenetic analysis at cDNA levels supported the
evolutionary conservation of HLP2 (Figure 8) in fish
species (D. labrax, C. auratus, S. gardneri (O.mykiss),

and D. rerio). Sea bass HLP2 shares a similarity of 56%
with godfish, rainbow trout and zebrafish HLP2; of 52%
with avians (zebra finch, red jungle fowl, and duck), of
53% with amphibians (Western clawed frog), and a similarity of 50-55% with the mammalians (mouse, rabbit,
gray short-tailed opossum, dog, chimpanzee, and
human).

Discussion
To be profitable, aquaculture must optimize rearing
conditions to grow fish in as little space and at as fast a
rate as possible; however, this high-density rearing condition creates a stressful environment not suitable for
several physiological functions of fish. Thus, preventive
strategies to control the health and immune responses
of the fish play a crucial role in aquaculture.
AMPPs can be used as sensitive indicators of fish
health [19]. They are mainly present at sites of potential
entry of pathogens and their levels vary significantly

even before an animal shows signs of disease, making it
possible to intervene before adverse conditions cause
overt disease and subsequent loss.
HLP1 and 2 are the most known AMPPs in fish and
from the literature we could deduce that, given their
ubiquity, they can carry out functions related to defense
mechanisms in most teleosts [19], including D. labrax.
Regarding Hb-LPs, it has been shown that their cytosolic
breaking can generate peptides that possess biological

activity related to hypothetical, secondary functions in
different tissues, such as temperature regulation, antibacterial and inflammatory activity, blood pressure regulation, and enhancement of cholinergic transmission
[68]. Dicentracin, recently isolated in D. labrax [13], has
a role in immune defense. Using in situ hybridization
assay, Salerno et al. [13] observed dicentracin expression
in 68-71% of peripheral blood leukocytes, kidney leukocytes or peritoneal cavity leukocytes, whereas

dicentracin mRNA was observed in most of the granulocytes, as well as in monocytes from both peripheral
blood and head kidney, and in macrophages from peritoneal cavity.
The predicted 3D structure of the AMPPs in our study
is dominated by ordered alpha helices. Most AMPP
molecules are frequently alpha-helical, with an overall
positive charge (generally +2 to +9) imparted by the presence of multiple lysine and arginine residues and a substantial portion (30% or more) of surface hydrophobic
residues. These features seem to play an essential role in
the various mechanisms of membrane permeabilization,
which often lead to microbial cell death [69]. Microbial
killing is a consequence of the interaction of the AMP
with the microbial outer membrane, which destabilizes
the membrane and promotes channel formation. A first
step in this mechanism of action is the electrostatic interaction between the cationic peptide and the negatively
charged components of the membrane of the pathogen;
hence, an increase in positive charge of the peptide will
increase microbicidal activity [70].
However, membrane permeabilization, per se, does not
invariably result in bacterial death. Although AMPs

interact with microbial cell membranes, creating pores
that lead both to leakage of ions and metabolites, and
depolarization, there is increasing evidence to indicate
that these effects are not the only mechanisms of microbial killing, and that antimicrobial peptides have other
intracellular targets [20]. Some peptides must cross the
cytoplasmic membrane and they have developed unique
mechanisms to translocate to the cytoplasm. Once in
the cytoplasm, translocated peptides can inhibit nucleicacid synthesis, alter the cytoplasmic membrane septum
formation, inhibit cell-wall synthesis, inhibit protein
synthesis or inhibit enzymatic activity. An example is
buforin II, a histone H2A-derived antimicrobial peptide,
which inhibits the cellular functions of E. coli by binding
to DNA and RNA after penetrating the cell membranes.
PR-39, a proline/arginine-rich antimicrobial peptide, is
able to bind the cell membrane of E. coli without affecting its integrity and kill bacteria by blocking both DNA
and protein synthesis. Tachyplesin binds in the DNA
minor groove. At their minimal inhibitory concentrations, pleurocidin and dermaseptin both inhibit nucleic
acid and protein synthesis without damaging the E. coli
cytoplasmic membrane. E. coli cells exposed to these

peptides are unable to undergo cell division due to the
blocking of DNA replication or the inhibition of membrane proteins that are involved in septum formation
[20,71].
In fish, the tertiary structure of at least two AMPPs of
the group of “piscidins” has been resolved by crystallography: [piscidin 1: Protein Data Bank entry 2O JM, and
hepcidin: PDB entry 3 HOT http://www.pdb.org/pdb/
home/home.do]. Piscidin 1, isolated from hybrid striped
bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops), is very similar to
dicentracin from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).
According to Campagna et al., [72] which determined
the three-dimensional structure of piscidin, the number
of positively charged residues (two arginines, one lysine,
and four histidines), and the ability to form an

amphipathic helical structure in membrane mimicking
environments, are the two main features responsible for
the antimicrobial activity of this AMPP. Furthermore,
the substitution of two glycine residues, Gly8 and Gly13,
with Ala or Pro on piscidin’s structure decrease the bacterial cell selectivity of this antimicrobial peptide [73]. In
particular, the antimicrobial and haemolytic activities,
and the ability to permeabilize the model phospholipid
membranes, were higher in piscidin with Gly or Pro at
position 8 than for its counterparts with either Gly or
Pro at position 13 [73].
The other peptide of the “piscidin” group, hepcidin,
reveals a distorted beta-sheet shape with a hairpin loop.
The beta-sheet structure is stabilized by disulphide pairing of Cys residues and hydrogen bonding between the

two antiparallel strands [74]. This leads to a markedly
amphipathic peptide structure, a hallmark of many antimicrobial and antifungal peptides. The hepcidin 3D conformation is important for its aggregation and function.
In particular the proximity of the loop portion of the
peptide to the rest of the peptide is a feature associated
with the aggregation of the peptide, whereas the rare
vicinal disulphide pairing in the hairpin loop may be a
significant characteristic in the function of this peptide
[74].
The tertiary structure of other groups of AMPPs such
as “Hemoglobin like” and “Histone-like” have not yet
been resolved by crystallography in fish. Thus, the structures of Hb-by crystallography in fish. Thus, the structures of Hb-LP, HLP1, and HLP2 were “de novo”
predicted in our study. These structures shows a distribution of hydrophobic residues at the surface, suggesting a functional involvement of such residues. This is
similar to the aforementioned 3D structures of piscidin
1, and hepcidin. Indeed, sea bass Hb-LP and HLP1 align
partially to the alpha helix of piscidin 1, whereas HPL2
aligns partially to the chain C of hepcidin. Furthermore,

the charge distribution of the aligned fragments is very
similar, suggesting similar functional properties associated to the 3D structure of these AMPPs.
Antimicrobial peptides of animal origin display different types of post-translational modifications that can
modify their activity in a significant way; among the
most frequent, are glycosylation, and phosphorylation.
The analysis of the sea bass AMPP sequences show the
presence of O-GalNAc glycosylation sites in HPL1,
whereas a motif allowing the N-glycosylation is present
in the Hb-LP.
Aside from its important role in antimicrobial activity,
little is known about other roles of glycosylation in the
lethal mechanisms of the corresponding peptides,
though some ideas have been advanced, such as protection against proteinases, modification of secondary
structure inhibition of enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis or specific recognition between pathogen and peptide [70]. Phosphorylation has been
described for histatins although absence of phosphate
does not preclude candidacidal activity of this antimicrobial peptide. Other AMPPs such as chromacin,

Terova et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/12/69

requires both O-glycosylation and tyrosine phosphorylation for full antibiotic activity, and the synthetic nonmodified peptide is completely inactive. Enkelytin, an
antibacterial peptide derived from proenkephalin A has
two phosphoserines and an oxidized methionine
required for activity [70].
After isolating the sea bass cDNAs of HLP1, HLP2,
and Hb-LP, we quantified the expression of these genes
and of that of dicentracin (previously isolated by Salerno
et al. [13]) by using real-time RT-PCR in the skin, gills,
eyes, stomach, and proximal intestine of three groups of
animals. The first group represented the control conditions; the second one was subjected to acute confinement/crowding stress; and the third one was subjected
to the same acute stress followed by 24 hours of recovery. Reverse transcription-real-time PCR, which is based
on two sequential reactions – reverse transcription of
the mRNA, followed by applying the resulting cDNA as
a PCR template – is considered as one of the most
accurate methods for transcript evaluation [75]. In aquaculture, the use of real-time PCR has recently expanded,
in particular for detecting microbes, parasites, and
genetically modified organisms. However, any need for
fast and precise measurements of small amounts of
nucleic acids in fish represents a potential niche for
real-time PCR-based applications, and as machines
become faster, cheaper, smaller, and easier to use, more
in-field application needs for this technology in aquaculture are likely to be filled.
The results obtained for the Hb-LP gene showed an
increase in the number of mRNA copies in gills and
skin of stressed fish as compared to control animals.
During the recovery phase, the mRNA copy number of
this Hb-LP tends to decrease in both tissues, reaching
the control values after 24 hrs of recovery only in skin
(Figure 2). Hb-LP expression observed in the gills and
skin was higher than in eyes, stomach, and gut. The
upregulation of the transcription could be considered as
a response for coping with acute stress and it could be
associated with an increase in Hb-LP protective activity
against noxious external agents. An increase in the antibacterial activity of a hemoglobin-related AMPP, the
hemoglobin-like protein 1 (HbbP-1), has been observed
in gills and skin of catfish (I. punctatus) after exposure
to ectoparasite I. multifillis [36], and subsequent studies
[76] showed that HbbP-1 is active against another ectoparasite, Amyloodinium ocellatum. This microorganism
is also the target of the histone-like protein isolated
from the gills of rainbow trout (O. mykiss), catfish, and
sea bass [29,30]. We could deduce that HbbP-1 and its
related peptides may act in association with other
AMPPs, such as histone-like proteins, isolated from the
same tissues, creating a powerful line of innate defense
against pathogens. No variation in transcript levels in

Page 16 of 19

the other analyzed tissues might indicate that this gene
is constitutively expressed and performs its function in
immune defense proactively against a stressful event.
However, other antimicrobial molecules might play
immunological roles in the eyes, stomach, and gut; in
fact, a single organism can possess different classes of
AMPPs and several variants of the same class [15]. The
induction of transcription of Hb-LP gene after four
hours of crowding stress, compared to the control samples, is consistent with the data of Liu et al. [77], who
showed that the induction of b-globin requires 3.5 to 24
hours in the presence of interferon or
lipopolysaccharide.
The results obtained for HLP1 and HLP2 confirmed
that the acute crowding stress induces AMPP transcription and the recovery phase does not always restore
mRNA levels to the control values (Figure 3). Thus, the
histone-like proteins may also be involved in the
immediate early response of the innate immune system.
Both HLP1 and HLP2 were expressed mainly in the gills
and skin, where a statistically significant change in the
number of mRNA copies was observed between control
and stressed animals. HLP2 expression was also relevant
in eyes, organs that may be damaged by wounds and
traumas under conditions of high livestock density. The
expression of HLPs in the other tissues, such as gut,
could be constitutive, as mRNA levels did not change
following acute stress; however, the antimicrobial action
in those tissues might be performed by other AMPPs
that work together with those analyzed in this work.
Richards et al. [78] reported that HLP2 isolated from
the gut, stomach, and liver of Atlantic salmon (S. salar)
was involved in specific immune responses. The authors
showed that this protein has antimicrobial activity
against Escherichia coli D31, carrying out its functions
through active cell secretion during infection events.
HLP2 shows antibacterial activity towards both grampositive and gram negative agents, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa [79], and anti-parasitic activity against
the ectoparasite A. ocellatum, as demonstrated by incubating gill cell lines with the spores of this microorganism [29]
HLP2 also binds the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [80,81],
protecting cells from an endotoxic shock mediator, the
tumor necrosis factor [82], and other inflammatory
mediators [83]. All these features, combined with
increased transcript levels in our experiment, confirm
that HLP2 has a central role in modulating the immune
system response as a proper immune effector.
HLP1 shows specific antimicrobial activity towards different microorganisms, such as Micrococcus luteus,
Bacillus megaterium, E. coli, and Candida albicans
[84-86]. Cho and colleagues [87] have highlighted the
role of HLP1 as immune modulator in catfish, where it

Terova et al. BMC Immunology 2011, 12:69
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/12/69

is present in the epithelial cells in a nonacetylated form.
They showed that, after skin injury, HLP1 is proteolysed
by cathepsin D to increase the levels of antimicrobial
peptide parasin I. Contrary to effects caused by acute
stress, chronic stress decreases the transcriptional levels
of HLP1 in catfish before any signs of illness can occur.
The downregulation of AMPPs transcripts may dramatically increase the susceptibility of fish to infectious diseases [31]. In support of our data, it has been shown
that, in rainbow trout, acute stress, such as confinement
for a short time (minute to hours), rapidly increases the
concentration of plasmatic proteins and stimulates the
innate immune system, rather than suppressing it, in
order to protect the fish from possible injuries [88].
Dicentracin gene showed an increase in the number of
mRNA copies in skin and gills after the acute stress,
compared to the same tissues of control animals. The
recovery phase restored transcript levels to the control
values only in the skin (Figure 1). The higher expression
of dicentracin gene in gills and skin suggests that this
AMPP represents a first and immediate line of defense
in combating pathogens and stressors since these tissues
constitute the first physiological barriers of the animal.
Furthermore, in anticipation of a stress, which often
occurs during many routine farm practices (hauling,
grading, etc.) the AMPP levels in the population would
be upregulated so that immune defenses are stronger
after the stress is imposed. Under this scenario, the
population remains resistant to pathogens commonly
present in a latent state in the population. However, we
cannot extensively discuss the potential role of the
increase in dicentracin mRNA levels based on the
results of the present study as we do not know whether
such an mRNA profile is consistent with the functional
protein levels. Therefore, without protein data we cannot draw any conclusions about the relationship
between the mRNA levels and the dicentracin antimicrobial activity in gills and skin of stressed sea bass.
Thus, our hypothesis that dicentracin has a role in the
acute stress response in fish must be confirmed by
further proteomic investigations.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we isolated the sea bass cDNA sequences
encoding for Hb-LP, HLP1, and HLP2 antimicrobial
peptides in the present study. We have also shown that
acute crowding stress induces an increase in the expression levels of the aforementioned genes and dicentracin
in gills and skin of sea bass, and that this pattern of
expression returned to basal levels within 24 hours of
recovery in normal conditions. Future studies are necessary, however, to completely elucidate the underlying
mechanism of AMPPs activation in marine teleosts. The
present study is the first to investigate the role of these

gene transcripts during acute confinement stress in a
representative of this species.
