Abstract
Background: The industrially important yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to grow both in the
presence and absence of oxygen. However, the regulation of its metabolism in conditions of
intermediate oxygen availability is not well characterised. We assessed the effect of oxygen
provision on the transcriptome and proteome of S. cerevisiae in glucose-limited chemostat
cultivations in anaerobic and aerobic conditions, and with three intermediate (0.5, 1.0 and 2.8%
oxygen) levels of oxygen in the feed gas.
Results: The main differences in the transcriptome were observed in the comparison of fully
aerobic, intermediate oxygen and anaerobic conditions, while the transcriptome was generally
unchanged in conditions receiving different intermediate levels (0.5, 1.0 or 2.8% O2) of oxygen in
the feed gas. Comparison of the transcriptome and proteome data suggested post-transcriptional
regulation was important, especially in 0.5% oxygen. In the conditions of intermediate oxygen, the
genes encoding enzymes of the respiratory pathway were more highly expressed than in either
aerobic or anaerobic conditions. A similar trend was also seen in the proteome and in enzyme
activities of the TCA cycle. Further, genes encoding proteins of the mitochondrial translation
machinery were present at higher levels in all oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions, compared
to fully aerobic conditions.
Conclusion: Global upregulation of genes encoding components of the respiratory pathway under
conditions of intermediate oxygen suggested a regulatory mechanism to control these genes as a
response to the need of more efficient energy production. Further, cells grown in three different
intermediate oxygen levels were highly similar at the level of transcription, while they differed at
the proteome level, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to distinct physiological
modes of respiro-fermentative metabolism.

Background
Oxygen is one of the basic determinants of cellular physiology. Oxygen is needed for energy metabolism and
sterol, fatty acid and heme biosynthesis, but may also

cause oxidative damage, especially when cells are exposed
to oxygen after being in oxygen-restricted conditions [1].
Regulation of metabolism in response to oxygen availability is needed for rapid adaptation to changing environPage 1 of 19

ments both in nature and in industrial bioprocesses.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a major industrial organism, is
able to grow both in the presence and in the complete
absence of oxygen by adjusting the mode of metabolism
from respiratory to respirofermentative and fermentative.
Among yeasts, S. cerevisiae and other Saccharomyces species
are unique in being able to restrict respiration and
increase fermentative metabolism on glucose, even in the
presence of oxygen, by the repression of respiratory genes
[2].
The concentration of heme plays a central role in the regulation of oxygen responsive genes in S. cerevisiae,
through the biosynthetic pathway of heme which is not
active in the absence of oxygen. However, there are at least
two types of heme pools in the cell, a protein-bound and
a free pool, and it is not known how these two pools contribute to the transcriptional regulation [3]. The transcription factor Hap1p acts as an activator or as a repressor of
certain genes depending on the presence or absence of
heme. In the presence of heme, Hap1p activates the
expression of genes involved in respiration and oxidative
stress [4,5]. Transcriptional activation by Hap1p increases
dramatically between anaerobic and severely oxygenrestricted conditions, but only gradually between 1 μM O2
and fully aerobic conditions [3]. Hap1p also induces the
expression of ROX1, which encodes a repressor of genes
needed during severe hypoxia or in anaerobic conditions
[6,7]. In the absence of heme, Hap1p acts as a repressor of
genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis [8]. The transcription factor Hap2/3/4/5p is also suggested to be activated by heme and it induces the expression of many
genes involved in respiratory metabolism in the presence
of oxygen [9,10]. However, while the regulation of Hap1p
by heme has been widely studied, the regulation of Hap2/
3/4/5p by heme and oxygen is largely unknown [11].
In anaerobiosis, the cell wall and cell membrane of S. cerevisiae is remodelled, which enables import of sterols and
fatty acids, which, like heme, are not synthesised in the
absence of oxygen [9,12-16]. Transcription factors Upc2p,
Ecm22p and Sut1p are known to play a role in the import
of sterols, but the exact mechanisms are not known
[17,18]. However, nearly one third of anaerobically
upregulated genes contain Upc2p/Ecm22p binding sites
in their promoters [19,20]. Upc2p and Ecm22p bind the
same sequence and the binding is dependent on sterol
concentration [21]. In addition, Mox1p and Mox2p have
been suggested to be repressors interacting with Upc2p
[22]. The target genes of Sut1p are not known, but the
overexpression of SUT1 has been shown to enable uptake
of sterols in aerobic conditions [23,24].
Genome wide studies have revealed that a large part of the
S. cerevisiae transcriptome reacts to the presence or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

absence of oxygen, partly depending on the carbon source
and nutrient limitation [12-14,25,26]. While Piper and
co-workers identified 877 transcripts differentially
expressed between aerobic and anaerobic glucose-limited
conditions, Tai and co-workers found that only 155 of
these genes responded consistently to anaerobiosis under
four different macronutrient limitations [25,26]. Lai and
co-workers monitored the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae
during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in batch cultivations on glucose and galactose
[13,14]. These studies revealed an initial response of
stress-activated genes only on galactose, while later
responses of downregulation of mitochondrial functions,
upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and redox regulation and activation of networks involved in sterol and
cell wall homeostasis were similar on both carbon
sources. In addition to transcriptome analyses, a recent
comparison of the transcriptome and proteome revealed
post-transcriptional regulation of glycolysis and of the
aminoacyl-tRNA, purine and amino acid biosynthetic
pathways, in respect to oxygen availability [27].
To our knowledge, there is no published data of the transcriptome or proteome in steady state conditions with
intermediate oxygen levels. Studies of yeast provided with
different oxygen levels could reveal regulation that is
dependent not only on the presence or absence oxygen,
but also on oxygen concentration. Severe hypoxia is
known to modulate gene expression of some gene pairs in
a Hap1p, Hap2/3/4/5p and Rox1p dependent manner
and it is thought to enable more efficient oxygen utilisation. COX5a/COX5b, CYC1/CYC7, AAC2/AAC3 and
TIF51a/ANB1 are pairs of interchangeable genes, of which
one member of the pair is used under aerobic conditions
and the other under severe oxygen restriction [9]. This
switch occurs only in very low oxygen concentrations [28]
and nothing is known about the expression of these gene
pairs under conditions of moderately low oxygen.
Under steady state glucose-limited conditions, glucose
repression of respiratory functions does not occur and it is
possible to study the effect of oxygen on metabolism without interfering effects of using different carbon sources or
changes in the specific growth rate. We cultivated S. cerevisiae in highly controlled glucose-limited chemostat cultures with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.8 and 20.9% oxygen in the feed
gas and studied the levels of selected transcripts, metabolites and fluxes of central carbon metabolism [29,30]. Our
studies revealed that cells grown with 2.8% oxygen in the
feed gas were very similar to those grown with 20.9% oxygen (fully aerobic conditions) in terms of oxygen uptake
rate, carbon evolution rate, and biomass production,
while only minor changes in fluxes were seen. However,
the metabolism was already respiro-fermentative with
2.8% oxygen and a large fraction of measured transcripts

levels differed from those observed in cells grown with
20.9% oxygen [29,30]. Furthermore, even though the biomass yield and the respirative carbon flux through the
TCA cycle were significantly reduced when cells were fed
1.0% or 0.5% oxygen, compared to fully aerobic conditions, 36% and 25% of the ATP was still generated
through respiration with 1.0% and 0.5% oxygen, respectively [29,30]. In order to get a global view on the metabolism of S. cerevisiae under various conditions of oxygen
provision, we have performed whole transcriptome and
partial proteome analysis of S. cerevisiae cells grown in
glucose-limited chemostat cultures with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.8 or
20.9% oxygen in the feed gas and used both well established and recently published computational tools for a
thorough analysis of the data.

Results
The effect of oxygen provision on gene transcription in
steady state glucose-limited chemostats
Microarray analysis of yeast from glucose-limited chemostat cultivations with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.8 and 20.9% oxygen in
the feed gas was performed. Statistical analysis of the
steady state data revealed that 3435 genes responded significantly (p < 0.01) to oxygen availability under the five
conditions studied. While the highest number of responsive genes (2900) was observed between the anaerobic
and fully aerobic conditions, the number of genes
expressed differently in conditions of intermediate oxygen
(0.5-2.8%) was relatively small (Figure 1A and 1B). The
transcriptome from cultures with 0.5% and 1.0% oxygen
was particularly similar: only 10 genes had statistical differences (p < 0.01) in their expression. When the anaero-

bic or fully aerobic conditions were compared to
conditions of intermediate oxygen, significant differences
were found in 2000-2400 and 1500-1600 genes, respectively.
To obtain an overall picture of metabolic pathways
responding to oxygen availability, gene set enrichment
analysis was performed. This analysis allows the identification of defined sets of genes with differential expression
between two classes of samples [31,32]. Parametric gene
set enrichment analysis (PAGE) uses fold changes
between experimental groups to calculate Z scores for predefined gene sets and uses normal distribution to infer the
statistical significance of the gene sets [33]. This approach
was used in the present study to identify KEGG pathways
and GO categories (containing 10 or more genes) which
contained genes that were differentially expressed in conditions of different oxygen provision. Pair wise comparisons of successive oxygen levels and of the anaerobic and
fully aerobic conditions are shown in Table 1. Comparison of intermediate oxygen levels showed that few pathways were differentially expressed when cells were
provided with 0.5, 1.0 or 2.8% oxygen. In particular, comparison of 0.5% and 1.0% oxygen found no statistically
significant differences, even at a p-value of 0.05 (data not
shown).
Most of the genes (78%) which were differentially
expressed between anaerobic and 0.5% provided oxygen
were likewise differentially expressed between anaerobic
and fully aerobic conditions (Figure 1A). PAGE analysis
revealed that the pathways that were differentially
expressed between anaerobic and 0.5 or 1.0% provided
oxygen, but not between anaerobic and fully aerobic conditions were those of oxidative phosphorylation, pheromone signalling, arginine, proline and glutathione
metabolism and exocytosis (Table 1). Pathways unique to
the comparison of 2.8% and 20.9% provided oxygen were
protein folding, iron ion homeostasis, protein targeting to
membrane and metabolism of phenylamine and amino
sugars.
Clustering of transcription data and promoter analysis of
the clusters
Cluster analysis of the transcriptional data was carried out
using fuzzy c-means clustering, which enabled clustering
without prefiltering of the genes and thus included potentially interesting genes that did not differ strongly in the
different conditions and which would otherwise have
been discarded from the analysis [34]. Fuzzy c-means
clustering is a soft clustering method that assigns genes to
clusters with gradual membership values between zero
and one. Not all genes are forced into clusters, as is often
the case in traditional clustering of predetermined, significantly changing genes. Moreover, the membership values

The promoter and 3'UTR sequences of genes in the clusters identified using fuzzy c-means clustering were analysed using FIRE software [35] and the results of the
analysis are shown in Figure 3. The analysis revealed 17
transcription factor binding site motifs and 7 3'UTR
motifs, of which some had significant co-occurrence and/
or co-localisation patterns. A more detailed description of
the results of clustering and promoter analysis is provided
below.
Genes of the respiratory pathway and TCA-cycle have
enhanced expression in intermediate compared to fully
aerobic conditions
Two steady state clusters (cluster 4 and cluster 11) contained genes that had higher expression in all intermediate oxygen conditions compared to either anaerobic or
fully aerobic conditions. The transcription levels of genes
in cluster 4 were higher in anaerobic than aerobic conditions, while the opposite was observed in cluster 11. Cluster 4 was enriched in genes of KEGG pathways for the cell
cycle and glycerophospholipid metabolism, while cluster
11 was enriched in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, the MAPK signalling pathway and
pyruvate metabolism. FIRE analysis revealed that different
motifs were enriched in the promoters and 3'UTR
sequences of the genes of these two clusters. In genes of
cluster 4, motifs for Puf3p 3'UTR sites were found, while
genes in cluster 11 were enriched in binding sites of the
Hap2/3/4/5p transcription factor and two previously
undescribed 3'UTR motifs (WHATATTC and HTTTAWTTH). All three motifs found in cluster 11 had significant
co-occurrence amongst the genes.

Nearly all of the genes encoding nuclear-encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes were located in cluster
11 (30 out of 37) and cluster 4 (4 out of 37), thus having
their highest expression levels in the intermediate oxygen
conditions. Cluster 11 and 4 also contained genes encoding several TCA cycle enzymes: Cit1p, Aco1p, Idh1p,
Kgd1p, Kgd2p, Lpd1p, Mdh1p (cluster 11) and Idh2p
(cluster 4). The increase in the expression was mainly less
than 2-fold, suggesting a subtle change of the components
of these pathways. Of the genes encoding the main
enzymes of the TCA cycle, only FUM1, LSC1 and LSC2 did
not have their highest expression level in the intermediate
oxygen conditions, but in the fully aerobic conditions.
Further, genes encoding isoenzymes of the enzymes of the
TCA cycle had their highest expression either in fully aerobic (IDP2, IDP3, MDH2, MDH3, CIT3, YLR164W,
YJL045W, YMR118C) or anaerobic (CIT2) conditions.
Many respiratory enzymes contain metals and accordingly, many genes involved in metal transport and homeostasis were found in clusters 4 and 11. Genes encoding
vacuolar iron transporters Fth1p and Fet5p, plasma mem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

brane copper transporters Ccc2p and Ctr1p, the metal ion
transporter Smf1p and iron and copper reductase Fre1p
were found in cluster 11. Additionally, genes encoding
metallopeptidases/proteases Yta12p, Axl1p, Qri7p, and
the copper deprivation induced ORF YOR296W were
amongst the members of this cluster. Cluster 4 contained
genes encoding plasma membrane siderophore-iron
transporter Arn1p, oxidoreductase Fet3p, vacuolar zinc
transporter Zrc1p and Ggc1p involved in mitochondrial
iron homeostasis. Comparing gene expression in 2.8%
oxygen and the fully aerobic conditions, 9 out of 16 genes
known to be involved in transport of iron from the extracellular medium to the cytosol [36] had 2-16 fold higher
expression and only two genes had lower expression in
2.8% oxygen than in the fully aerobic conditions.
Cluster 4 was enriched in genes related to mitochondrial
organisation and biogenesis (RPM2, POR1, UTH1, PNT1,
CLU1, DNM1, MGM1, MBA1). In addition, genes encoding mitochondrial translation elongation factors (TUF1,
MEF1), mitochondrial translational activators (CBS2,
PET309), mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (RRF1)
and subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes (10 genes) were
found in this cluster. Cluster 10, in which the lowest level
of expression occurred in the fully aerobic conditions and
similar, higher expression levels occurred in the oxygenlimited and anaerobic conditions, also contained genes
related to mitochondrial protein synthesis. 57 genes
encoding components of mitochondrial ribosomes and
10 genes of mitochondrial protein import machinery
were found in cluster 10. The 3' UTR motif for binding of
Puf3p, which promotes degradation of mRNAs of nuclearencoded mitochondrial proteins, was over-represented
both in clusters 4 and 10. The expression of PUF3 itself
was low and remained constant under all the conditions
of different oxygen provision studied.
Effect of oxygen on transcription of genes involved in lipid
metabolism
Clusters 16 and 21 were enriched in genes related to fatty
acid oxidation and peroxisomal biogenesis. Cluster 16
showed highest expression in fully aerobic conditions,
lowest expression in anaerobic conditions and a similar,
intermediate level of expression in all the intermediate
oxygen conditions. Genes encoding activities of fatty acid
β-oxidation (TES1, POX1, CTA1, PXA1, SPS19, DCI1,
ANT1, FOX2, POT1, PEX11, PXA2), the oleate responding
transcription factor OAF1 and 4 genes related to peroxisomal biogenesis (PEX15, PEX2, PEX8, PEX18) were located
in this cluster. Gene expression in cluster 21 was at its
highest in fully aerobic conditions, and at a lower, comparable level in the oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions. This cluster contained 6 genes (PCD1, YOR084W,
CAT2, IDP3, ECI1, AAT2) related to fatty acid metabolism, and 7 genes related to peroxisomal biogenesis

(PEX14, PEX5, PEX19, PEX30, PEX28, PEX1, PEX3,
YMR018W). The oleate responding transcription factor
PIP2 was also located in this cluster.
Clusters 3 and 14 were enriched in genes related to sterol
metabolism. Genes of cluster 3 were transcribed at lower
levels in intermediate oxygen conditions, compared to
fully aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The cluster contained genes encoding activities of ergosterol biosynthesis
(ERG6, ERG11, HMG2, ERG25, DAP1), sterol transport
(SUT2, OSH2), sterol homeostasis (TGL1) and synthesis
of membrane sterols (ATG26). Genes in cluster 14 were
transcribed at a lower level in all oxygen containing conditions, compared to anaerobic conditions. The cluster
was enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in
ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG26, ERG7, ERG2, ERG3,
ERG1, ERG10, NCP1, ERG9, ERG27, ERG24, ERG28,
HES1), sterol esterification (ARE1), sterol transport
(AUS1, SWH1) and regulation of sterol transport and biosynthesis (UPC2, ECM22). Also DAN/TIR genes, encoding
cell wall mannoproteins, and PAU genes of unknown
function were accumulated in cluster 14 (DAN1-4, TIR14, PAU2,3,5,9). When a less strict α-value of 0.1 was used
to define the genes belonging to this cluster, three additional PAU genes were found in it (PAU7,17,18).
Promoters of the genes in clusters 3 and 14 were enriched
in two putative transcription factor binding sites that had
strong, positive co-occurrence. The motif BTAWACGA was
found in all the sterol metabolism-related genes of cluster
14, except in SWH1, and in all the three ERG genes of cluster 3. The motif RACAATAG was found in the promoters
of 11 out of the 29 genes related to sterol metabolism of
cluster 14, and in 2 out of 9 of those in cluster 3.
Oxygen dependent stress responses
Three clusters (clusters 3, 8 and 16), with distinct expression profiles, showed enrichment in genes in the GO category of stress response, and binding sites of stress-related
transcription factors Msn2/4p and Gis1p were over-represented among the promoters of the genes in two of these
clusters (clusters 8 and 16). In the promoters of the genes
in cluster 16, binding sites of Ume6p and two unknown
transcription factors were also over-represented while,
binding sites for a stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1p were under-represented. Further, the gene
encoding Xbp1p was a member of cluster 16. The expression level of XBP1 was induced 3-fold in the intermediate
oxygen (0.5-2.8%) and 8-fold in the fully aerobic conditions compared to the anaerobic conditions. Promoter
analysis revealed enrichment of the binding site for
Xbp1p in clusters 1 and 22. These clusters had an average
correlation of -0.81 and -0.97, respectively, to the expression level of XBP1. 72% and 68% of the genes in clusters
1 and 22, respectively, contained the central core bases

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

(CTCGA) of the Xbp1p binding site. Many of these genes
are related to the regulation of cell division (GIC1, BUD4,
TOS4, KIP2, TOS1, KIN4, TUB4, CIN8, TUB3, VIK1,
SMC2, UNG1, PIN4, FKH1) and cell wall organisation
(EXG2, ORF YFL052W, TOS1, BUD7, MHP1, DSE1,
SUN4).
The MAPK signalling pathway for pheromone response
and filamentous growth is affected by oxygen availability
Clusters 4, 7 and 11, of which clusters 4 and 11 have been
discussed above with reference to genes involved in the
TCA cycle and respiration, and which contain those genes
which were more highly expressed in the conditions of
intermediate oxygen availability, were enriched in genes
involved in mating and filamentous growth. These clusters contained genes which showed a low level of expression in anaerobic, compared to intermediate oxygen
conditions. However, they differed in the fully aerobic
conditions, genes of clusters 4 and 11 had lower expression levels in the aerobic than in the intermediate oxygen
conditions, but in cluster 7 the expression levels were
comparable in all conditions provided with oxygen.

Genes in cluster 11 included some encoding proteins of
the MAPK signalling pathways for pheromone response
and filamentous growth (Ste3p, Gpa1p, Fus3p, Sst2p,
Kss1p), genes regulated by these signalling pathways
(FUS2, FUS1, FIG1, SAG1, FIG2, PRM6, AGA1, PRM1,
CLN1, BUD8, MSB2, CWP1, GFA1, KTR2, SVS1) and the
transcription factors (Ste12p, Tec1p) that are activated by
these pathways. According to FIRE analysis, this cluster as
well as cluster 4, which contained a set of genes related to
mating (FAR1, STE4, CLN2, MSG5, STE23, KAR5, ASH1,
HO, CCW12), were enriched in genes whose promoters
contain the transcription factor binding site for Ste12p.
Cluster 7 contained genes regulated by the MAPK signalling pathway for mating (PRM5, PRM10, AGA2, MDG1,
AFR1, PRR2, PRM8, CHS1). While promoters of genes in
cluster 7 were overall enriched with a binding site of
Ume6p transcription factor, Ume6p binding site was not
enriched in the promoters of the genes related to pheromone signalling.
Comparison with previous data and oxygen dependence of
genes of pentose phosphate pathway
We previously published transcription data for 72 selected
genes related to central carbon metabolism, measured
with the TRAC method [29]. Of those genes analysed with
both Affymetrix (p < 0.01) and with TRAC (p < 0.05)
methods, 61 showed statistically significant differences in
their expression levels with both methods. Sixteen of the
significantly changing genes showed >3-fold difference in
expression and had an average correlation of 0.8 between
the TRAC and the Affymetrix analysis. Thirteen of the significantly changing genes showed 2 to 3-fold difference in

Page 8 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:461

expression and had an average correlation of 0.6. Twentyfour of the significantly changing genes had <2-fold difference in their expression and had an average correlation of
only 0.2. However, five of these genes which had <2-fold
difference had correlations > 0.7. The genes that showed
poor correlation between the TRAC and the Affymetrix
data, and that showed ≥ 2-fold differences in the Affymetrix were GPD2, CIT2, ACS1, HAP1, MAE1 and PCK1, the
signals of the three latter genes being very close to the
detection limit using the TRAC method.
Large changes in the expression of SOL4, GND2, TKL2
and the ORF YGR043C, from the pentose phosphate pathway, were observed in Affymetrix data. These genes had
their highest levels of expression in the aerobic and lowest
levels of expression in the anaerobic conditions (cluster
16). The fold differences were 2-15 between the anaerobic
and intermediate oxygen and 16 to 40-fold between the
anaerobic and fully aerobic conditions. In addition, SOL3
was slightly (1.5-fold) upregulated in the 2.8% oxygen
and fully aerobic conditions compared to lower oxygen
levels. Of these genes, the expression of GND2, TKL2 and
ORF YGR043C had also been measured with the TRAC
method and the correlation between the Affymetrix and
TRAC measurements was > 0.7.
ZWF1 was also measured with both Affymetrix and TRAC.
With both methods ZWF1 expression was shown to
increase 1.3-fold, compared to expression in fully aerobic
cells, however, this increase was seen in cells provided
with 0, 0.5 and 1.0% oxygen in the Affymetrix analysis,
but only in cells provided with 2.8% oxygen in the TRAC
analysis. Of the other genes from the pentose phosphate
pathway, GND1, TKL1 and TAL1 did not show significant
differences in their expression levels in different oxygen
conditions when measured with Affymetrix.
Effect of oxygen on the proteome and enzyme activities,
correlated with transcriptome changes
2D-gel analysis of 2-4 independent cultures from each
level of oxygen provision resulted in a proteome of 484
protein spots in total that were included in the statistical
analysis. After quantile normalisation, a similar analysis
for statistically significant changes in quantity with linear
modelling was performed as with the gene expression
data. This analysis revealed 145 spots that differed significantly (p < 0.01) when the cells were provided different
levels of oxygen. Of the 484 spots, 209 were identified.
The data is presented in additional data file 2.

Enzymes of the TCA cycle and those involved in respiration showed either a slight increase in quantity (1.5 to 2fold) in the intermediate oxygen conditions, compared to
other conditions (Idh2p, Mdh2p, Sdh1p, Atp3p, Atp5,
Atp7p, Qcr2p, Rip1), a strong increase (3 to 64-fold) in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

fully aerobic conditions (Cit1p, Fum1p, Lsc1p, Idp2,
Atp1, Cyb2p) or did not differ in different levels of oxygen
provision (Aco1p, Idh2p, Atp2, Atp7p, Idp1p, Lsc2p).
Many of the proteins involved in glucose fermentation
were found as multiple pI isoforms which differed in relative quantities in different oxygen levels. These included
Adh1p (3 pI isoforms), Adh2p (3), Ald4p (2), Ald6p (2),
Eno1p (6), Eno2p (4), Gpm1p (3), Fba1p (2) and Hxk1
(2).
Enzyme activities were measured from crude cell extracts,
providing a measure of the combined activity of all isoforms of the respective enzymes in the cell (Figure 4). The
activities were expressed as units (U) per total soluble protein. It has previously been shown that there are only
small differences in the protein content of the cells grown
in aerobic and anaerobic glucose-limited chemostats at
the growth rate of 0.1 h-1.[27]. In comparison of enzyme
activities we assumed that the protein content of cells
grown in oxygen limited conditions would be similar to
those of cells grown anaerobically and aerobically. The
activities of citrate synthase (CS), aconitase (ACO), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and malate dehydrogenase
(MDH), from the TCA cycle, strongly correlated (correlation > 0.89) with the transcriptome data for the corresponding genes of the TCA cycle (CIT1, ACO1, IDH1,2
and MDH1, respectively). Of the enzymes of the pentose
phosphate pathway, the activity of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) had a correlation of 0.7 with the
corresponding gene, ZWF1. The activities of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), transketolase
(TKL) and transaldolase (TAL) had a correlation of 0.5 to
GND1, TKL1 and TAL1, respectively, and no correlation to
GND2, TKL2 and ORF YGR043C, respectively.
In all the aeration conditions studied, the Pearson's correlation between proteins identified in the 2D gels and the
mRNA levels of the corresponding genes in the transcriptome was similar, with an r-value between 0.41 and 0.55.
For a more detailed comparison, the 107 significantly
changing protein spots (from the 2D-gels) and the corresponding transcripts were hierarchically clustered (Figure
5). In the case of multiple protein isoforms, the corresponding transcript was assigned to each isoform separately. Of the eight groups formed by the cluster analysis,
the protein and transcript quantities in groups 1 and 6
showed a high correlation (average 0.80 and 0.77, respectively). Members of group 1, related to metabolism of ethanol (ADH2), the glyoxylate cycle (ICL1, MLS1), fatty acid
metabolism (FAA2), acetyl CoA synthesis (ACS1, ALD6,
ALD4), and glycolysis (FBA1), were at high levels in fully
aerobic conditions and both the expression of the genes
and the quantity of the proteins decreased with decreasing
oxygen availability. Members of group 6, involved in
translation (DED1, PAB1, DYS1, HTS1) and amino acid

metabolism (MET17, SER1, SAM2), glycolysis and ethanol fermentation (HXK1, ADH1), were at high levels in
anaerobic conditions and on low levels in fully aerobic
conditions. In groups 2, 4 and 5 the transcript and protein
levels differed significantly only in cells provided with
0.5% oxygen. Group 2 contained genes and proteins
involved in oxidative stress (SOD2, TSA1), redox balance
(GCY1, CYB2), fatty acid metabolism (ETR1) and the TCA
cycle (FUM1, LSC1). The protein levels in group 2 were
high with 1.0 to 20.9% provided oxygen, while the transcript levels were already high with 0.5% provided oxygen. In group 4, related to the TCA cycle (ACO1, IDH2,
SDH1), oxidative phosphorylation (ATP1, QCR2, RIP1,
ATP7, ATP3) and other mitochondrial reactions (ILV2,
MCR1, TUF1, POR1), the protein levels were highest with
1.0 and 2.8% provided oxygen and the transcript levels
were again high already with 0.5% provided oxygen. In
group 5, containing genes and proteins related to redox
balancing (TRR1, RHR2, DLD3, YEL047C), the highest
protein levels were observed in anaerobic conditions and
when 0.5% oxygen was provided, while gene expression
levels were highest under anaerobic conditions. Members
of group 3, involved in various different functions, had
their highest protein and gene expression levels in fully
aerobic conditions, but in oxygen-restricted conditions
the levels did not correlate. Group 7 contained genes and
proteins, the expression and quantity of which correlated

in some levels of provided oxygen. Group 8 contained
genes and proteins that did not show any correlation.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the oxygen limitation, not
only the presence or absence of oxygen, strongly affects
both the transcriptome and proteome of the yeast S. cerevisiae. Genes related to the respiratory pathway, the TCA
cycle, metal ion homeostasis and the MAPK signalling
pathways of mating and filamentous growth responded
specifically to intermediate oxygen availability, a response
not seen when focusing only on anaerobic and aerobic
growth conditions. In addition, comparison of array and
proteome data indicated post-transcriptional regulation,
especially with 0.5% oxygen in the feed gas.
Respiratory functions inevitably have the highest oxygendemand of cellular reactions. Interestingly, analysis of the
transcriptome revealed an upregulation of nearly all genes
encoding subunits of respiratory complexes and the main
enzymes of the TCA cycle in conditions of intermediate
oxygen. The differences at the transcriptional level were
less than 2-fold and would have been neglected in clustering analyses involving a pre-selection of genes. The same
trend was observed in the proteome as an increase in the
concentration of some of the proteins of the TCA cycle
and respiratory chain, and further confirmed by increased

enzyme activities of the enzymes of the TCA cycle in the
intermediate oxygen levels. This may indicate that the cell
senses that oxygen is restricted and tries to enhance respiration by global upregulation of the genes related to these
functions. Supporting this hypothesis, several genes
encoding enzymes that function in the transport of iron
and zinc also had their highest expression in the intermediate oxygen conditions. Proteins functioning in oxygen
binding and oxygen-dependent metabolism contain a
large proportion of the cellular iron, copper and other
metals [37] and additional metals are thus needed to
enhance the synthesis of oxygen binding proteins. To our
knowledge, the global upregulation of respiratory pathways observed in this study as a response to intermediate
oxygen availability has not previously been described.
The Hap2/3/4/5p transcription factor, the binding site of
which was enriched among the promoters of the respiratory genes which were upregulated in the intermediate
oxygen conditions, is known to act as an activator of many
genes encoding subunits of the respiratory chain complexes. It may have a role in gene regulation induced by
oxygen restriction, possibly in combination with regulation mediated by the two 3'UTR motifs found to be
enriched in the genes that had their highest expression
level in the intermediate oxygen conditions. One of these
motifs (WHATATTC) resembles the motif AATATTCTT
found in a comparative genomics study of three yeast species [38] and a similar motif found by the matrixREDUCE
algorithm [39]. Both of these studies identified the motif
as over-represented among genes related to energy metabolism, the latter being particularly over-represented
among the genes of the electron transport chain.
Hap2/3/4/5p is suggested to play a role in the activation
of respiration during growth rates above 0.08 h-1 providing excess respiratory capacity that allows for respiratory
metabolism at higher glucose fluxes [10,11]. Both high
specific growth rates and intermediate oxygen provision
in glucose-limited chemostats lead to onset of respirofermentative metabolism [29,40]. In fully aerobic conditions at growth rates below 0.3 h-1, the cell is able to
maintain fully respiratory metabolism. In conditions with
only 0.5 to 2.8% oxygen provided, however, the restricted
oxygen provided is not sufficient for purely respiratory
metabolism even though the cell responds by upregulation of Hap2/3/4/5p controlled networks.
Hap2/3/4/5p has also been suggested to control other
mitochondrial processes than respiration [10] to coordinate functions of both nucleus- and mitochondrionencoded mitochondrial proteins. However, at the transcriptional level, our data indicates that mitochondrial
translation and import machineries are not co-ordinately
regulated with respiratory functions, as the genes encoding the former were more highly transcribed in anaerobic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

rather than in fully aerobic conditions while the genes of
the latter were not. In addition, the 3'UTR sites found in
these groups were different. The results suggest that mitochondrial import and translational machineries have an
important role also during anaerobic conditions, in which
mitochondria are known to exist in the form of pro-mitochondria, the role of which is not yet very well understood
[41].
Utilisation of fatty acids is an oxygen-dependent process
[42]. Accordingly, the genes encoding activities of fatty
acid β-oxidation and peroxisomal biogenesis were more
highly expressed in the fully aerobic compared to oxygenlimited conditions. Interestingly, there was a clear difference between cells grown with 20.9% and 2.8% oxygen in
the feed gas, even though the oxygen uptake rate under
these two conditions was very similar. CTA1 and POX1
have previously been shown to be regulated by oxygen
[12,43], via a heme-dependent pathway that does not
involve Hap1p, and via another mechanism that does not
rely on heme, but the exact pathways are not known [43].
It is possible that the other genes of the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway in the same cluster (TES1, CRC1, ANT1 and
FOX2) are regulated by oxygen via the same, still
unknown pathway as CTA1 and POX1.
Sterol biosynthesis, which is also an oxygen-requiring
process, is regulated differently than fatty acid oxidation.
In contrast to fatty acid oxidation, which is mainly related
to energy production, sterol biosynthesis is essential for
the cell [15,44,45]. Our promoter analysis revealed two
putative transcription factor binding site motifs that are
possibly involved in sterol metabolism. One of these
(BTAWACGA) was found in 18 out of 20 promoters of the
genes of ergosterol biosynthesis, in all promoters of DAN/
TIR genes encoding cell wall mannoproteins, and interestingly also in UPC2 and ECM22, genes which encode transcription factors known to be involved in the regulation of
sterol uptake and biosynthesis [20,46-48]. A closer look at
this motif revealed that it corresponds to the AR1 (TCGTATA) and SRE (TCGTTYAG) motifs which are involved
in Upc2p/Ecm22p mediated transcriptional regulation of
anaerobically induced genes and ERG genes, respectively
[20,49]. The other motif found by the FIRE programme,
RACAATAG, has previously been observed through phylogenetic footprinting analysis to be enriched in genes of
lipid metabolism [50] and in genes which where upregulated on galactose medium in anaerobic conditions [13].
The motif was found in the promoters of 6 ERG genes,
UPC2 and ECM22. Thus this motif may be involved in
regulation of genes of ergosterol biosynthesis directly or
through Upc2p and Emc22p.
Even though the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is not
active in the absence of oxygen [51-53], some of the genes
of this pathway (ERG genes) had higher expression in

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:461

anaerobic cultures compared to the cultures receiving oxygen. This has previously been observed in cultures which
were anaerobic or severely oxygen-restricted [13,21,27],
but the opposite has also been reported. It was recently
shown that some of the ERG genes are repressed by Hap1p
in severely oxygen restricted conditions [8]. Anaerobic
upregulation of ERG genes may reflect the fact that sterols
are essential, by maintaining high levels of transcription
for pathways of sterol and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis,
priority may be given to these pathways in conditions
where oxygen becomes available after a period of anaerobicity to facilitate mitochondrial membrane biogenesis
[54].
Gene set enrichment analysis of our data indicated that
the genes of GO category of stress response were affected
by oxygen provision. The GO category of stress response
contains a wide set of genes responding to different stress
conditions and the cluster analysis showed that these
genes were indeed enriched in three clusters with distinct
expression profiles. However, all these clusters showed a
higher expression level of stress-related genes in the fully
aerobic conditions, compared to 2.8% provided oxygen.
XBP1, encoding a stress-induced transcriptional repressor,
was found to be regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner: the level of transcripts of this gene was lowest in
anaerobic, highest in the fully aerobic and on a similar,
intermediate level in the intermediate oxygen conditions.
The DNA-binding domain of Xbp1 is homologous to the
DNA-binding domains of cell cycle regulators Swi4p and
Mbp1 and binds a related sequence [55,56]. Xbp1p has
been indicated to act as a sporulation specific regulator in
diploid cells, but the role of this transcription factor in
haploid cells is not clear [55]. The transcription of XBP1 is
induced by various stress situations, including glucose
starvation and oxidative stress [55,56]. The enrichment of
its binding sites in the promoters of the genes whose transcription negatively correlated to the transcription of this
repressor, indicated a role related to cell division and cell
wall organisation. However, it is not clear why these functions would be regulated in conditions of constant growth
rate.
Interestingly, several genes of the MAPK signalling pathway of mating and filamentous growth were considerably
upregulated in the conditions of intermediate oxygen
availability. Glucose limitation is known to provoke filamentous growth in haploid cells with concomitant action
of MAPK, 5'-AMP-dependent and 5'-cyclic AMP-dependent kinase pathways (reviewed in [57,58]). The MAPK signalling pathway of mating and filamentous growth may
be activated by low glycosylation of the exo-cellular
domain of Msb2p in low glucose conditions. However,
since the glucose was below detection limit in all cultures
studied, oxygen limitation in addition to glucose limita-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

tion, contributed to the induction of this signalling pathway in the conditions of intermediate oxygen availability.
No clear filamentation of the cells was observed under
these conditions, possibly due to lack of activity of the
other kinase pathways.
In conditions of restricted respiration, the carbon flux
through glycolysis is increased while the flux through the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) remains constant
[30,59-62]. The regulation of glycolysis has been shown
to be predominantly post-transcriptional [27,29,63], but
less is known about the regulation of the PPP. Expression
of the genes encoding the main isoenzymes of the PPP did
not differ significantly in conditions of different oxygen
provision, while the expression of the genes encoding the
minor isoenzymes of PPP, GND2, TKL2, SOL4 and ORF
YGR043C (NQM1) was strongly affected by oxygen provision. The expression of the latter genes was not dependent
on the absolute level of oxygen in the feed gas, but rather
on the absence, limited provision or excess oxygen. Genes
encoding these isoenzymes are also induced after the
diauxic shift [64]. It thus seems that they are important for
respiratory metabolism and that the downregulation of
their expression in fermentative conditions is not dependent only on glucose repression.
We previously published transcription data for 72 selected
genes related to central carbon metabolism, measured
with the TRAC method [29]. Comparison of the results of
TRAC analysis and the present data revealed good correlation for most of the transcripts showing more than 2-fold
difference in their expression when measured with
Affymetrix. This is similar to the correlation observed in
comparison of transcription data for 1375 human genes
using microarray or real-time PCR analysis [65]. The proportion of genes that showed similar significant differences with both arrays and real-time PCR was
dramatically decreased when changes less than 2-fold
were considered [65]. The differences between the TRAC
and the Affymetrix measurements may be due to differences in sample preparation and the need for cDNA synthesis: in TRAC crude cell lysates are used and no cDNA
synthesis is performed while in Affymetrix purified RNA is
used to synthesise cDNA for hybridisation [66]. In addition, normalisation and probe design may affect the
results [67].
Our results on the correlation of the proteome and transcriptome (Pearson correlation 0.41 to 0.55) are consistent with previous studies in yeast [68], although both
higher [69] and lower [70] correlation has been reported.
The 35 proteins spots and the corresponding genes of oxygen dependent reactions and respiration, and of acetylCoA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, translation and
glycolysis in groups 1 and 6 were very similarly affected by

the oxygen availability, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. However, the glycolytic enzymes in particular, as well as aldehyde dehydrogenases, were found as
multiple pI isoforms and the responses of the isoforms of
glycolytic enzymes differed from each other, indicating
regulation by phosphorylation [71].
Interestingly, for several transcript-protein pairs the
expression correlated when oxygen availability was high,
but varied in low oxygen conditions, especially when only
0.5% oxygen was provided (members of groups 2, 4 and
5). Proteins of the TCA cycle and the electron transport
chain, and those related to oxidative stress and additional
mitochondrial functions, which clustered in groups 2 and
4, were present at relatively low levels when 0.5% oxygen
was provided, although the gene expression levels were
already high, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of
these proteins. In group 5, related to redox status of the
cell, the opposite was observed, i.e. protein levels were
high, even though gene expression was down-regulated,
again indicating a post-transcriptional level of regulation.
Thus, both physiological characteristics and the fluxes
[29] demonstrate that provision of 0.5, 1.0 or 2.8% oxygen in the feed gas results in distinct modes of respiro-fermentative metabolism which are clearly not achieved
through transcriptional regulation alone.

Conclusion
The level of oxygen provision affected a significant part of
the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae. However, there were
only a few genes, the expression of which strictly correlated with oxygen concentration in the feed gas. Rather,
the differences were observed in comparison of anaerobic,
oxygen-limited and fully aerobic conditions, which
require different modes of metabolism in S. cerevisiae. An
overview of the interactions of the genes and transcription
factors highlighted in this study is given in the Additional
file 3 in which the relative gene expression in the different
conditions is indicated along with the relevant transcription factors. Further, comparison of transcriptome and
proteome level data indicated post-transcriptional regulation, especially when 0.5% oxygen was provided.
In the oxygen-limited conditions, the genes encoding respiratory pathways were more highly expressed and the
quantities of proteins were higher than in either anaerobic
or aerobic conditions. Regulation was possibly achieved
at the transcriptional level through the action of the
Hap2/3/4/5p transcription factor and the two previously
undescribed 3'UTR elements. While the expression levels
of these genes were high in all three oxygen-limited conditions studied, the protein quantities were high only
when 1.0 or 2.8% oxygen was provided, suggesting a posttranscriptional level of regulation. In addition, according
to these results, the transcriptional responses of respira-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/461

tory and mitochondrial translational machineries were
not coordinated, since the transcription of the latter was at
a higher level in oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions, compared to fully aerobic conditions, whereas the
transcription of the former was higher in oxygen-limited
conditions, compared to either anaerobic or fully aerobic
conditions. Further, the regulatory elements enriched in
the genes of mitochondrial translation machinery were
different to those enriched in genes related to respiratory
pathways.

Methods
Strain and culture conditions
The cultivations were described and the fermentation data
published by Wiebe and co-workers [29]. Briefly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-1A (MAT , URA3, HIS3,
LEU2, TRP1, MAL2-8c, SUC2) was grown in 0.8 to 1 L
medium in B. Braun Biotech International (Sartorius) Biostat® CT (2.5 L working volume) bioreactors in the defined
minimal medium described by Verduyn et al. [72], with
10 g glucose l-1 as carbon source, and supplemented with
10 mg ergosterol l-1 and 420 mg Tween 80 l-1. Silicone
antifoam (BDH 331512K, VWR International, UK; 0.5 mL
l-1) was used to prevent foam production in the cultures.
Chemostat cultures were maintained at D = 0.10 ± 0.02 h1, pH 5.0, 30°C, with 1.5 volume gas [volume culture]-1
min-1 (vvm). For cultures which received less than 20.9%
O2 (vol/vol) in the gas stream, air was replaced with the
equivalent volume of N2, so that total gas flow was maintained constant for all experiments. Cultures which were
fed 2.8 or 20.9% O2 were subject to oscillations. To prevent these, approximately 5% of the total cell concentration in the bioreactor was added to the culture as cells in
mid to late exponential phase at the time when continuous medium feed was started [73].
Transcriptome analysis
Affymetrix microarray analysis of two (0.5%, 2.8% O2) or
four (0%, 1.0%, 20.9% O2) parallel cultivations was performed. From cultures which received 0.5% and 2.8% O2,
two separate steady state samples were also analysed. In
addition, from one of the cultivations with 1.0% O2 in the
feed gas, four separate steady state samples were analysed.
The cells were collected in cold (+4°C) 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7. After centrifugation (3500 rpm, 5 min,
+4°C), the cell pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen. For
anaerobic samples, the buffer was saturated with nitrogen
in advance. For RNA extraction, 5-20 mg dry mass of cells
were suspended in 400 μl cold (+4°C) disruption buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2
mM DTT). 400 μl phenol-chlorophorm (50:50), 5 μl 20%
(w/v) SDS and 400 μl glass beads (0.5 mm diameter,
Biospec Products) were added. The cells were disrupted
with a Fastprep machine (Q-Biogene), 2 × 20 s, at speed 6.
After centrifugation (14000 rpm, 15 min, +4°C), superna-

tant was used for total RNA extraction. The total RNA
extraction was done with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.

clusters were computed with the GOstats package [82].
Transcriptional regulatory motifs in the clusters were analysed with the FIRE method [35].

Hybridisations were carried out at the Finnish DNA
Microarray Centre at Turku Centre for Biotechnology. 2 μg
of total RNA was used as starting material for sample preparation. Samples were processed according to the OneCycle Target Labelling protocol in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Manual (Affymetrix). Both before and after
the amplifications the total RNA/cRNA concentrations
were assessed with Nanodrop ND-1000 and total RNA/
cRNA quality was assessed by BioRad's Experion electrophoresis station. Each sample was hybridised to the GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 Array at +45°C overnight (16 h)
according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical
Manual (Affymetrix). A GeneChip Fluidics Station 450
was used to wash and stain the arrays, and a GeneChip
Scanner 3000 with AutoLoader was used to scan the
arrays. CEL-files were extracted with GCOS Manager 1.4.

Proteome analysis
Cells for proteome analysis were collected in cold Naphosphate buffer, pH 7 as described for the microarray
analysis. 5-10 mg dry mass of cells was re-suspended in
150 μl of 10% (v/v) trichloro acetic acid (TCA, Merck) in
1.5 ml micro centrifuge tubes. 500 μl glass beads (0.5 mm
diameter, Biospec Products) were added and the tube
inserted into a MiniBeadbeater 8 (Biospec Products) and
shaken at homogenisation speed, three times for 30 seconds. The tubes were cooled on ice between each homogenisation step. The suspensions were withdrawn and
proteins were precipitated by adding 600 μl of -20°C acetone and incubating 30 min. on ice. Precipitated proteins
were collected by centrifugation for 30 min., 13 000 rpm,
at 4°C, rinsed once with 600 μl of -20°C acetone and resuspended in 450 μl of 7 M urea (Promega, USA), 2 M
thiourea (Fluka, USA), 4% (w/v) CHAPS (Fluka), 1% (w/
v) Pharmalytes 3-10 (Pharmacia, Sweden) and 1% (w/v)
DTT (Sigma) by gently shaking for 20 min. at room temperature. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation
for 5 min. 13 000 rpm (Eppendorf bench centrifuge). The
protein concentration of supernatants was determined by
the Non-Interfering Protein Assay (Geno Technology,
Inc.) and the samples were stored at -70°C before isoelectric focusing.

All data analysis was done using R/Bioconductor, version
2.5.1 [74,75]. The raw data was normalised with Robust
Multichip Average (RMA) normalisation [76]. Statistical
differences in the expression were analysed using linear
modelling with the tools of limma package [77]. For each
gene, a linear model was fitted by the least squares
method and differential expression within pairs of experimental conditions was computed using the empirical
Bayesian approach [78]. For correction of multiple testing
errors, the Benjamini & Hochberg -method controlling
false discovery rate (FDR) was used [79]. The microarray
data can be accessed through GEO accession number
GSE12442.
The Gene Ontology (GO) classes and KEGG pathways differentiating the conditions studied were computed using
parametric gene set enrichment analysis [33,80]. Pair wise
fold changes between conditions of different oxygen provision were calculated and the fold changes were used to
calculate Z scores for the gene sets. Statistical significances
of Z scores were determined against normal distribution.
The clustering analysis of gene expression data was performed using fuzzy c-means clustering [34,81]. The clustering method assigns genes to clusters with gradual
membership (values between 0 and 1). For the clustering,
the expression values were scaled and centred to have a
mean of zero and standard deviation of one. The parameter m, which controls the sensitivity of the clustering process to noise, was adjusted to 1.25 to prevent the detection
of clusters in randomised data. The number of clusters
was selected, such that no clusters were formed where all
the genes would have membership values below 0.5. The
enriched GO classes and KEGG metabolic pathways in the

Isoelectric focusing and second dimension 11% (w/v)
SDS-PAGE were carried out as described earlier [83]. After
electrophoresis the gels were fixed for one and a half
hours in 30% (v/v) ethanol and 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid and
stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes), according to
manufacturers' instructions. The stained gels were
scanned with a resolution of 100 microns on a Typhoon
instrument (GE Healthcare). The gel images were analysed using the Progenesis software (Nonlinear Dynamics). The gel patterns from different gels were
automatically matched, with some additional manual
editing, and the quantities of matching spots in different
gels were compared. From each condition, samples from
2-4 independent cultivations were used and for each sample 4 gels were analysed. After background correction, the
data was transferred to the R environment for normalisation and data analysis.
Background corrected proteome data of 500 spots was
obtained from Progenesis software. For each condition,
the spots that had zero values in more than 50% of the
gels were treated as real zeroes and set to the lowest value
of each gel [84]. The rest of the missing values were estimated using the k- nearest neighbour-method [85]. The
data was log transformed and quantile normalised as

described in [86]. The statistical analysis of differences
was done using linear modelling [77].
Protein identifications were carried out in the Protein
Chemistry Unit, Institute of Biomedicine, Anatomy, Biomedicum, Helsinki. For protein identification, excised gel
spots were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile
(Rathburn, Scotland, HPLC grade S). Proteins were
reduced with 20 mM DTT and incubated at 56°C for 30
min before alkylation with 55 mM Iodoacetamide
(Sigma, USA)/100 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate
(NH4HCO3) in the dark at room temperature for 15 min.
After washing with 100 mM NH4HCO3 and dehydration
with acetonitrile the gel pieces were rehydrated in 10 to 15
μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, USA) in 100 mM
NH4HCO3, to a final concentration of 0.01 μg/μl trypsin
and incubated for trypsin digestion overnight at 37°C.
Tryptic peptides were eluted from the gel pieces by incubating for 15 min at room temperature successively in 25
mM NH4HCO3 and then twice in 5% formic acid. The
tryptic peptides were desalted using Zip Tip μC-18 reverse
phase (Millipore, USA) and directly eluted with 50% v/v
acetonitrile/0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) onto a
MALDI target plate. Then, a saturated matrix solution αcyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) (Sigma, USA) in
33% ACN/0.1% TFA was added. MALDI-TOF analyses
were carried out with an Autoflex (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen Germany) equipped with a nitrogen pulsed laser
(337 nm) and operating in positive mode. Typically, mass
spectra were acquired by accumulating spectra of 240 laser
shots. External calibration was performed for molecular
assignments using a peptide calibration standard (Bruker
Daltonics GmbH, Leipzig, Germany). Trypsin autolytic
peptide masses were used to check or correct the calibration.
Protein identifications were performed by searching the
peptide masses against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant database
using Matrix Science's Mascot - Peptide Mass Fingerprint
http://www.matrixscience.com/cgi/
search_form.pl?FORMVER=2&SEARCH=PMF.
Protein
identifications by peptide mass fingerprinting were further evaluated by comparing the calculated and observed
molecular mass and pI, as well as the number of peptides
matched and percent sequence coverage.

Enzyme activity assays
Enzyme activities were measured as units (U) per mg of
total soluble protein. One U was defined as the activity
which converts one μmol substrate per min. Enzyme
activities were measured from cell extracts prepared by
disrupting the yeast cells with glass beads in 100 mM
Hepes-buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, supplemented with
Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, USA). The protein concentration of the cell extracts
was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, USA), using bovine serum albumin as the
standard. All enzyme activities were measured as triplicates using the Konelab Arena 20XT automated analyser
(Thermo Scientific, Finland) at 30°C and 340 nm in 79
mM TEA, pH 7.6, except citrate synthase activity which
was measured at 420 nm. The isocitrate dehydrogenase
(EC 1.1.1.41) assay mixture contained 1.2 mM MnCl2 and
0.48 mM NAD. The reaction was started by adding DL-isocitrate trisodium salt to a final concentration of 4 mM.
The citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) assay mixture contained
0.38 mM Acetyl-CoA and 0.1 mM DTNB. The reaction was
started by addition of oxaloacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3) assay mixture contained 1.2 mM MnCl2, 0.48 mM NADP and 0.8 U
ml-1 isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP dependent). The
reaction was started by addition of sodium citrate to a
final concentration of 2 mM. The malate dehydrogenase
(EC 1.1.1.37) assay mixture contained 0.2 mM NADH.
The reaction was started by addition of oxaloacetic acid to
a final concentration of 0.56 mM. The transketolase (EC
2.2.1.1) and transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) assay mixture contained 0.2 mM NADH, 20 U ml-1 triosephosphate isomerase and 20 U ml-1 glycerolphosphate isomerase. In
addition, transketolase mixtures contained 0.3 mM thiamine pyrophosphate and 4 mM MgCl2. The transketolase
assay was started by addition of ribulose-5P and ribose-5P
to final concentrations of 5 mM and ribulose epimerase to
25 U ml-1. The transaldolase assay was started by addition
of erythrose-4 phosphate and fructose-6 phosphate to
final concentrations of 0.7 mM and 5.4 mM, respectively.
Glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase assay mixtures contained 0.2 mM
NADP and 8 mM MgCl2. The reactions were started by
addition of glucose-6 phosphate and 6-phoshphogluconate, respectively, to final concentrations of 0.3 mg ml-1.
