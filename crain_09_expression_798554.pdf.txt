Abstract
Microglia are implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, many of which display sexual
dimorphisms and have symptom onsets at different ages. P2 purinergic receptors are critical for
regulating various microglial functions, but little is known about how their expression varies with
age or sex. Therefore, comprehensive information about purinergic receptor expression in normal
microglia, in both sexes, over age is necessary if we are to better understand their roles in the
healthy and diseased CNS. We analyzed the expression of all fourteen rodent P2X and P2Y
receptors in CD11b+ cells freshly-isolated from the brains of C57Bl/6 mice at five different ages
ranging from postnatal day 3 to 12 months, in males and females, using quantitative RT-PCR. We
also compared purinergic receptor expression in microglia freshly-isolated from 3 day-old pups to
that in primary neonatal microglial cultures created from mice of the same age. We observed
patterns in P2 receptor expression with age, most notably increased expression with age and agerestricted expression. There were also several receptors that showed sexually dimorphic
expression. Lastly, we noted that in vitro culturing of neonatal microglia greatly changed their P2
receptor expression profiles. These data represent the first complete and systematic report of
changes in purinergic receptor expression of microglia with age and sex, and provide important
information necessary for accurate in vitro modeling of healthy animals.

Introduction
Microglia are the primary resident immune cell population in the central nervous system (CNS). They phagocytose debris following neuronal remodeling processes,
help maintain CNS integrity, and perform neuronal support functions through the production of neurotrophins
and growth factors [1]. Microglia also react to invading
pathogens and CNS damage such as that resulting from
physical injury, ischemia, and disease [2,3]. However,
uncontrolled microglial activation and their resulting production of neurotoxic cytokines and reactive oxygen and

nitrite species is thought to contribute to the pathology of
many neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, agents that
function to reduce microglial inflammatory activities are
currently being sought.
Work from our laboratory and others' has pointed to a
role for P2 purinergic receptors (P2Rs) in reducing microglial production of inflammatory mediators [4-6]. Purines
are the endogenous ligands for most P2Rs, but pyrimidines and some nucleotide sugars can activate certain subtypes as well. The two major P2 receptor families are

subdivided based on agonist specificities and proposed
membrane topologies: the P2X receptors are ligand-gated
cation channels composed of homo- or heterotrimeric
P2X subunits, and the P2Y receptors are seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors [7]. To date, there are
seven known P2X receptor subtypes (P2X1–7) and eight
P2Y receptor subtypes (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11,
P2Y12, P2Y13, P2Y14) however the P2Y11 receptor gene
is absent from the rodent genome [8]. In microglia, nucleotides are important regulators of diverse cellular functions such as release of neuroprotective factors like BDNF
[9-12], production of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6 [13-15], as well as phagocytic, chemotactic, and
motility effects [16,17].
Previous studies have evaluated the microglial expression
of specific P2Rs in multiple CNS disease models [18-22],
but few have addressed P2 receptor profiles in microglia
from healthy animals. Moreover, systematic studies of all
fourteen rodent P2Rs in microglia have not been reported.
P2 receptors have an important role in modulating microglial inflammatory activity, and this inflammation coincides with the pathology of various neurodegenerative
diseases. The diseases described in the studies above (e.g.
ALS, Alzheimer's disease) have different incidence rates at
different ages; therefore it is essential to know how P2
receptor expression changes with age in the normal CNS
as this may have implications for their role in the pathogenesis of disease. In addition, because many CNS diseases are sexually dimorphic (that is, males and females
are differentially affected), and microglia are responsive to
sex hormones (reviewed in [23]), we were interested in
ascertaining if there are differences in microglial P2R
expression profiles between males and females.
In the present report, we analyzed P2 receptor expression
in brain microglia freshly-isolated from C57Bl/6 mice
ranging in age from 3 days to 12 months, and identified
several sexual dimorphisms. We also assessed how accurately P2R mRNA levels in mixed sex primary neonatal
microglial cultures, commonly used for in vitro studies,
model expression in vivo.

Materials and methods
Animals
C57Bl/6 mice were maintained in an AAALAC-accredited
animal facility according to protocols approved by the
University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. All animals were housed under standard
conditions, with a 12 hour light/dark cycle and ad libitum
food and water. Experiments were performed using animals aged postnatal day 3 (3d), 21 days-old (21d, weaning age), 7 weeks-old (7 wk, adolescent/young adult), 4
months-old (4 mo, adult), and 12 months-old (12 mo,
becoming reproductively senescent). Adult male mice

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/6/1/24

were housed in separate cages, while the mature females
were housed together for one week prior to use in experiments. The 4 mo females were virgins and the 12 mo mice
were retired breeders, with females not having born a litter
for at least two months prior to their sacrifice. All efforts
were made to minimize the number of animals used yet
allow the formation of statistically reliable conclusions.
CD11b+ cell isolation
Mice were euthanized and then perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove the majority of circulating immune cells from the CNS vasculature. The
brains (excluding the brain stem but including the cerebellum) were removed, cleaned of meninges, then dissociated into a single cell suspension by both physical
disruption and enzymatic digestion using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit protocol (this and all associated reagents were from Miltenyi Biotec, Germany unless
otherwise stated). Myelin was removed by high-speed
centrifugation at 850 g in a 0.9 M solution of sucrose in
Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS; Cellgro, Herndon,
VA). Cells were then rinsed in HBSS, resuspended in
buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 2 mM EDTA), and stained
with PE-conjugated anti-CD11b antibodies followed by a
magnetic bead-conjugated secondary antibody against PE.
Magnetically-tagged CD11b+ cells were then isolated
using MS columns according to the Miltenyi MACS protocol. Reagents are used at 4° and the cells are kept on ice
during the isolation process to slow metabolic rate and
reduce the opportunity for microglial cell activation.

The average purity of isolated cells having the characteristics of microglia was 97% as determined by CD11b/CD45
staining and flow cytometry, including FSC/SSC scatter
analysis. Flow cytometric analysis of samples from nonperfused animals demonstrated that the level of CD45 in
this population is CD45low whereas blood-derived
CD11b+ cells were identifiable as a second population
that is CD45high (data not shown). These macrophages
have been shown to represent only a small fraction of
CD45+ cells in the normal CNS of animals perfused with
PBS [24]. Similarly, the perfused samples used for this
study displayed only a single population of CD45+ cells,
as shown in Figure 1, indicating that the cell population
isolated by our method contains very few blood-derived
cells. As a result, these CD11b+ cells are hereafter referred
to as "microglia."
Genotyping
The sex of the 3d mice was visually determined and later
verified by genotyping for the sex-determining region Y
(SRY) gene, which is located on the Y chromosome.
Genomic DNA was isolated from each mouse by digestion
of a small section of tail in a Tris buffer with 0.4 mg/mL
proteinase K (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 56°, and then used

in PCR for SRY using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega,
Madison, WI). SRY was amplified using the following
primers: forward – TCTTAAACTCTGAAGAAGAGAA,
reverse – GTCTTGCCTGTATGTGATGG. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as a positive control for DNA quality and successful PCR, and was
amplified with the following primers: forward – CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG, reverse – GATGGCATGGACTGTGGTC. The PCR cycling program was as follows: 35
cycles of 95° for 2 min; 51° or 60° (for SRY and GAPDH,
respectively) for 1 min; and 72° for 40 s, followed by a
final extension at 72° for 10 min. The PCR products were
electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide and visualized using the Autochemi Imaging System (UVP, Upland, CA). Visualization of the resulting gels
[see Additional file 1] showed that all of the pools were
sexed correctly. The consistent detection of GAPDH product demonstrated that DNA was isolated from each pup
and could be successfully amplified by PCR even though
an SRY amplicon was absent in females.
Primary microglial cultures
Primary neonatal microglial cultures were prepared as
previously described [25]. Litters were approximately 50%
female and 50% male. Briefly, 3 day-old C57Bl/6 mice
were euthanized, and their brains removed and cleaned of
meninges and visible blood vessels. The tissue was dissociated by incubation in 0.25% trypsin (Cellgro) and

DNase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) followed
by trituration. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (all from
Cellgro), and plated in T75 flasks (Nunc, Rochester, NY)
at a density of approximately one brain per flask. The
medium was changed the next day, and the cultures were
maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After
10 days, the microglia were lifted from the astrocyte layer
by shaking for one hour at 75 rpm on an orbital shaker.
The microglia were then plated at 250,000 cells/well in a
12-well plate, cultured for two days, and then harvested.
The purity of microglial cultures was greater than 96% as
assessed by CD11b+ staining, as described previously [25].
RNA extraction/reverse transcription
RNA was extracted from all cultured or freshly-isolated
microglia according to the TriReagent protocol (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO), with the addition of Glycoblue
(Ambion, Austin, TX) during the isopropanol incubation.
cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA and MMLV
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as previously described
[26].
Quantitative PCR
cDNA was used in real-time quantitative PCR with
Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI
7300 system. The PCR cycling program was as follows:

95° for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95° for 15 s and
60° for 1 min, and finally a dissociation stage. The
primer sequences are as follows, and were designed to
span introns whenever possible to discount any product
from genomic DNA. Primer specificity was assessed
through NCBI BLAST analysis prior to use and, for each
sample following PCR, verification that the dissociation
curve had a single peak with an observed Tm consistent
with the amplicon length. Primer efficiency was tested
through the use of serial dilutions.
Ct values from duplicate measurements were averaged,
and relative expression levels were determined by the
ΔΔCt method. Evaluation of at least four different housekeeping genes, with multiple primer sets, indicated that
the expression levels of β-actin and β-tubulin remained
most stable in the microglia over age. Therefore, we chose
to normalize the expression of each gene to the levels of
β-actin detected in the same sample using the following
primer sets: F – ACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAA, R – AGAG
CATAGCCCTCGTAGATGG; or: F – CACAGCTTCTTTGC
AGCTCCTT, R – ACGACCAGCGCAGCGATAT. The aver-

age Ct for β-actin was 18; the average Ct values for the
P2Rs (at 3d) are included in the primer sequence table
(Table 1) as the number of cycles to threshold above that
for β-actin. mRNA levels for some genes, including the
absence of P2X2, were verified using a second unique
primer set. While PCRs were run to 45 cycles, all detected
genes had Ct values below 35 in a majority of the samples
examined.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed on ΔΔCt data using a
one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer Multiple
Comparisons or Dunnett post hoc tests (as appropriate) or
unpaired t-tests with a Welch correction, using Sigma Stat
3.1 software. Statistical significance was set at the 95%
confidence limit (p < 0.05). For Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, a
single symbol (* or †) above a bar represents p < 0.05; two
symbols p < 0.01; three symbols p < 0.001; and a letter or
# above a bar represents 0.05 < p < 0.10. Quantitative data
are expressed as the mean ± SEM of n = 4–6 mice in each
group (males in black bars, females in grey). Due to the
limited amount of tissue, brains from three or four 3d

P2X1 (A) and P2X4 (B) receptor mRNA expression in freshly-isolated mouse microglia varies with age and differs from cultured neonatal microglia. P2R mRNA levels in freshly-isolated microglia from male and female mice of different ages and mixed-sex primary neonatal microglial cultures were determined using qRT-PCR. Expression was normalized to
β-actin and average folds (+/- SEM) are graphed relative to the 3d time point of each sex. n = 3–6; for primary cells n = 5 separate culture preparations. Values in parentheses are fold-changes of the lowly-expressed samples. # 0.05 < p ≤ 0.10, * p ≤ 0.05;

mice were pooled by sex [see Additional file 1], and
microglia were isolated from n = 4 independent pools for
each sex. Results for primary microglial cultures (hatched
bars) are from n = 5 independent culture preparations.
Levels of gene expression are shown relative to 3 day-old
animals (for age comparisons) or males (for male/female
comparisons).

ferences were found in females (Figure 2A, lower panel).
In contrast, P2X4 expression is lower at 21d than at the
other ages (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, levels of both receptors in primary cultures are very different compared to
those in freshly-isolated microglia from mice at any age
examined, with P2X1 being significantly lower and P2X4
expression being approximately three times more abundant.

Results
In the present study, we evaluated the expression of all
rodent P2Rs in freshly-isolated mouse microglia, and we
display them here in groups according to their overall
expression patterns. We found four major expression patterns: expression that varies over age (Figure 2); expression that increases with age (Figures 3 and 4); expression
that does not change with age (Figure 5); and agerestricted expression (Figure 6).
P2X1 and P2X4 expression varies over age
We found that mRNA expression of both P2X1 (Figure
2A) and P2X4 (Figure 2B) vary with age. In males (Figure
2A, upper panel), P2X1 levels are significantly lower at 4
mo than they are at 3d, but no statistically significant dif-

Expression of P2X7 and P2Y6 is steady after 21d
P2X7 (Figure 3A) and P2Y6 (Figure 3B) mRNA levels are
lowest at 3d in both males and females, and were approximately three-fold higher at all other ages. Thus, maximum expression of both of these receptors appears to be
on or before 21 days of age, a time coinciding with weaning. In addition, mRNA levels of both receptors in primary
cultures are similar to those in microglia isolated from 3d
pups.
Expression of P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y1 increases with age
P2Y12 (Figure 4A), P2Y13 (Figure 4B), and P2Y1 (Figure
4C) mRNA levels in freshly-isolated microglia were also
lowest at 3d, but they continued to increase significantly

P2X7 (A) and P2Y6 (B) mRNA expression in microglia is lower at 3 days than at the other ages. P2R mRNA levels in freshly-isolated microglia from male and female mice of different ages and mixed-sex primary neonatal microglial cultures

with age. In both males and females, P2Y12 expression
was lower at 3d than at any other age. Its expression also
appeared to peak in both sexes by 4 mo (by ~five-fold),
but in males it decreased significantly thereafter (Figure
4A, upper panel). In addition, P2Y12 expression was significantly lower (by ~100-fold) in primary microglial cultures than in any of the freshly-isolated cells.
Like P2Y12 mRNA levels, P2Y13 expression is also much
lower (~100-fold) in primary cultures than in the freshlyisolated microglia (Figure 4B). Expression is increased in
microglia from 7 wk, 4 mo, and 12 mo animals compared
to 3d animals, in both sexes, though to varying levels of
significance. In males, P2Y13 levels were also significantly
higher than in the 21d samples, but in females only, the 7
wk time point was also higher than 21d.
P2Y1 expression in 21 d, 7 wk, and 4 mo animals also
trended towards increased expression (by 50- to 100-fold)
compared to 3 d old animals (Figure 4C); but unlike like
P2Y12 and P2Y13, its expression in 3d microglia and primary microglial cultures was similar. Unexpectedly, we
found that P2Y1 receptor expression was not detectable in
12 mo microglia samples.

Increases in P2X6, P2Y2, and P2Y14 with age are not
significant
In contrast to the receptors described above, the levels of
P2X6 (Figure 5A), P2Y2 (Figure 5B), and P2Y14 (Figure
5C) did not significantly change with age, although they
all showed a trend toward increased levels of expression at
adult ages (4 mo and 12 mo). The trend would likely
become significant if a larger number of animals was
used, though this sample size produced highly significant
results for other, less variable P2 receptors.
Expression of P2X3, P2X5, and P2Y4 is age-restricted
We found an unusual pattern of expression for P2X3 (Figure 6A), P2X5 (Figure 6B), and P2Y4 (Figure 6C) receptors: their expression in microglia appeared to be
restricted to mice of specific ages. For example, P2X5 is
present in microglia from 3d mice, but is absent in microglia from males and females of all the other examined
ages (Figure 6B). P2X5 expression in primary neonatal
microglial cultures is significantly lower (by ~800-fold)
than in the freshly-isolated 3d microglial samples. P2Y4
mRNA is expressed in microglia from 3d and 4 mo mice,
but it was not detected in samples from other mouse ages
(Figure 6C). Its expression in 4 mo male samples is signifPage 6 of 16

icantly higher than in 3d or primary microglia, but in 4
mo females this difference did not reach statistical significance. Lastly, in females, P2X3 mRNA was low but detectable at 3d, and it increased with age from 21d to 12 mo
(by ~75-fold to 125-fold). However, while P2X3 mRNA is
also increased in males at 21d (~50-fold) and 4 mo (~60fold) compared to 3d, it was undetectable in microglia
from 7 wk or 12 mo animals (Figure 6A). P2X3 mRNA levels in primary microglia were similar to microglia isolated
from 3d mice of both sexes.
P2X2 mRNA was not detected in freshly-isolated microglia from male or female mice at any age examined, nor
was it detected in our neonatal primary microglial cultures. These observations were confirmed using at least
two P2X2 primer sets which did amplify P2X2 from whole
brain cDNA samples.
Expression of some P2 receptors is sexually dimorphic
In order to examine the effect of sex on P2R expression,
independently of age effects, we compared expression in
freshly-isolated microglia from females to that in males at
each age. For the P2X receptors, we found sexual dimorphisms in four members: 1) P2X1 expression (Figure 7A)
is significantly decreased in 12 mo females compared to

age-matched males; 2) expression of P2X4 (Figure 7B) is
significantly lower in microglia from females than males
at 21 d, 7 wk, and 4 mo; 3) P2X5 levels (Figure 7C) in
females are nearly twice those in males at 3d (the only age
at which it was detected) and 4) the P2X3 receptor is
expressed in microglia isolated from females at 7 wk and
12 mo, but it is not detected in microglia from male mice
of these ages (Figure 6A).
We also found sexual dimorphisms in three P2Y receptors:
1) P2Y4 mRNA levels (Figure 8A) are nearly four times
higher in freshly-isolated microglia from 3d females than
from males, and there is a trend, though not significant, at
4 mo as well; 2) P2Y12 expression (Figure 8B) is lower at
4 mo in female microglia than that in males; and 3)
P2Y13 expression is lower at 4 mo and 12 mo in female
microglia (Figure 8C).
No statistically significant sexual dimorphisms were
found in the other six P2 receptors.

tor function; therefore it is important to ascertain how
accurately these cultures represent microglia in vivo. We
compared P2R expression in mixed-sex primary microglial cultures (made from 3 day-old pups) to the average
of that in freshly-isolated microglia from 3d males and
females, and found differences in 10 of the 13 expressed
receptors (Table 2). P2X1, P2X5, and P2X7 mRNA levels
were significantly decreased, whereas P2X4 levels were
increased in primary cultures. Of particular note is the dramatic reduction in P2X1 and P2X5 mRNA levels (by more
than 150-fold) in culture relative to freshly-isolated
microglia. Among the P2Y receptors, all but P2Y4 showed
a significant, or nearly significant, difference in expression
in primary versus freshly-isolated microglia. P2Y1, P2Y2,
and P2Y14 were increased in cultured microglia whereas
P2Y6, P2Y12, and P2Y13 mRNA levels were significantly
decreased in primary cultures compared to those in
freshly-isolated microglia from mice of the same age, with
P2Y12 and P2Y13 levels being reduced by nearly 100fold.

Discussion
In the present studies, we comprehensively analyzed P2X
and P2Y purinergic receptor expression levels in freshlyisolated brain microglia from male and female mice ranging in age from 3 days to 12 months. No studies to date
have reported changes in the basal expression of all P2
receptors in microglia with animal age. Moreover, sexual
dimorphisms in P2R expression in microglia have not
been studied before, despite strong gender differences in
multiple neurodegenerative diseases in which microglial
inflammatory activities are implicated. Lastly, we assessed
how P2R expression is altered by culturing in vitro, a significant issue given that primary mixed-sex neonatal
microglia are widely used for microglial studies.
The cells used in this study were CD11b+ cells isolated
from PBS-perfused C57Bl/6 mouse brain. The C57Bl/6
strain was chosen because it is a common research strain
and it is the genetic background upon which many knockout mice are made. Of the isolated CD11b+ cells used in

P2R mRNA levels in freshly-isolated microglia from 3d male and
female mice and mixed-sex primary neonatal microglial cultures (also
derived from 3d mice) was determined using qRT-PCR. Expression
was normalized to β-actin and the average fold change (+/- SEM) of
the mixed primary cultures is given compared to the average of male
and female 3d freshly-isolated microglia. n = 3–4 for freshly-isolated
samples; n = 4–5 separate culture preparations for primary cells. # p

this study, an average of 97% were also CD45+. Because
the majority of circulating CD11b+ cells were removed by
PBS perfusion prior to brain harvesting, the contribution
of non-microglial cells was negligible, consistent with previous reports [24]. The magnetic bead isolation system we
employed for isolating CD11b+ cells provided enough
cells to allow for quantitative analysis by RT-PCR without
the need for culturing. Moreover, this system enabled the
rapid isolation of microglial cells from multiple samples
simultaneously and minimized sample degradation, compared to cell sorting by standard flow cytometry.
The majority of genes examined in this study showed relatively minimal variability for ex vivo samples. A few of the
more lowly-expressed genes (P2X3, P2X6, P2Y2, P2Y14)
displayed higher variation. This probably reflects a wider
range of expression levels for these genes within the population, but it may also be due to the influence of gonadal

hormones as discussed further below, or the result of
short-term effects of mouse activity (e.g. differences
between when each mouse last ate, exercised, etc.) prior to
harvest. The absence of detection of P2X3 in males at 7 wk
and 12 mo, and P2Y4 in both sexes at all ages examined
except 3d and 4 mo is likely to be specific to the expression of those particular genes. For example, the expression
of many receptors is indeed at their maximum at the 7 wk
time point and several internal controls for the integrity of
each sample were used in this study (including the assessment of housekeeping genes measured using multiple
primer sets), suggesting that sample quality is not the reason for the absence of expression of one or two particular
genes out of fifteen.
Age-dependent changes in P2X receptors
Whereas there have been descriptions of P2R expression
in a number of organ systems (reviewed in [27]), to our
knowledge this is the first study examining both P2X and
P2Y expression in immune cells at different ages. Several
studies have evaluated changes in specific P2X subtypes in
various CNS disease models [18-22] and found their
expression to be increased. Given that nucleotides can
modulate cytokine levels [13-15] and inflammation is
often present in these diseases, P2Rs may have a role in
the development or initiation of these conditions. Here
we report that microglial P2X receptor expression varies
with mouse age, although with differing time courses.

While little is known concerning the specific inflammatory roles of most P2X receptors in microglia, P2X4 and
P2X7 receptor function is better understood. P2X4 up-regulation has an identified role in neuropathic pain [28],
and P2X7 receptors are critical for controlling inflammasome assembly that leads to cytokine release [29-31]. We
found that P2X4 expression was decreased in microglia
from 21d mice compared to that from the other ages,
while P2X7 levels were lowest at 3d and approximately
three-fold higher in microglia from mice at the other ages
examined. It is interesting to note that a recent report indicates that increased P2X7 levels drive microglial activation
and proliferation in vitro [32], an effect that may predispose to Neuroinflammation in adults. A previous study of
P2X receptor expression in late embryonic and early postnatal rat brain [33] found that P2X1 immunoreactivity
declined to undetectable levels at postnatal days 30 and
60 (males and females were not distinguished). Although
those time points do not match our own, we found relatively steady expression of P2X1 mRNA in microglia from
mice even to 12 months of age in both sexes. This discrepancy may be due to differences in assay sensitivity
between qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining
methods, or simple species differences. Differences
between microglial markers used may also account for
this divergence. For example, Xiang and Burnstock saw

Page 12 of 16

Journal of Neuroinflammation 2009, 6:24

dissimilar results for certain P2X receptors when ED-1 or
isolectin B4 was used as the microglial co-stain; we used
CD11b as the microglial marker in our studies. It is also
possible that there are disparities between P2X1 mRNA
and translated protein levels, however, post-transcriptional regulation of P2X1 receptors has not been documented.
P2X2 mRNA was not detected in any of the samples examined, and P2X5 receptor mRNA was only detectable in
microglia from 3d-old animals. Similar to our results,
Xiang and Burnstock did not detect P2X2 immunoreactivity in microglia from animals examined up to 60 days of
age. However, they did observe transient P2X5 receptor
immunoreactivity in cerebellar microglia in 7 day-old rats
[34], a time point we did not examine.
Lastly, this is the first study demonstrating expression of
P2X3 and P2X6 mRNA in freshly-isolated mouse brain
microglia, even though these receptors have been reported
in the murine N9 microglial cell line [35]. This pattern of
P2X6 receptor expression steadily increasing with age
until it plateaus at about 7 wk of age is consistent with
P2X6 expression in rat Kupffer cells where it also increases
with age [36].
Age-dependent changes in P2Y receptors
Although much less is known about the function of P2Y
receptors in microglia compared to P2X receptors, the
importance of P2Y receptors in regulating various microglial activities is becoming clear [37]. Recently, critical
roles for P2Y6 receptors in microglial phagocytosis [38]
and P2Y12 receptors in microglial migration, chemotaxis
and process extension have been revealed [16,17,39,40].
In addition, a role for P2Y12 receptors in neuropathic
pain has also recently been described [41].

In the present study, we found that the expression of most
P2Y receptors tended to increase between postnatal days 3
and 21, except for that of P2Y13 and P2Y4. The expression
of P2Y1, P2Y6 and P2Y12 receptors seemed to be most
strongly up-regulated during this time. There is significant
synaptic re-modeling and pruning that occurs during this
period in mouse brain development [42,43], and microglial activities are essential for these processes [44-46].
While the specific roles of these receptors in microglia
early in postnatal life is not yet known, we speculate given
the central role of P2Y6 receptors in microglial phagocytosis [39] and P2Y12 receptors in chemotaxis and migration, that their up-regulation may facilitate these activities
during brain development.
Also important, P2Y12 receptor expression levels declined
between 4 months and 12 months of age. Similarly, P2Y1
and P2Y4 receptor levels are completely undetectable in

http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/6/1/24

microglia from 12 mo animals. A decline in P2 receptors
whose expression is requisite for microglial migration and
phagocytosis may contribute to microglial senescence, a
hypothesis proposing that microglia lose their normal
capacity to perform neuron-protective and -supportive
functions as they age [45,46]. Another interesting point is
that the phylogenetically and structurally related P2Y
receptors (i.e. P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6) which are
postulated to inhibit inflammatory mediator release from
microglia [4-6], have either decreasing expression with
age or are completely undetectable in 12 mo animals. If
the endogenous role of these P2Y receptors in microglia is
indeed to act as a natural "brake" for pro-inflammatory
mediator production, perhaps their decline, as in Alzheimer's disease [18-22], underlies the exaggerated microglial inflammatory responses of the aged brain, and may
contribute to the onset of inflammatory processes
involved in neurodegenerative disease pathology [45,46].
Studies are in progress using RNAi methods similar to
those used in [47] to investigate the effect of receptor
knockdown on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in
aged brains.
Sexual dimorphisms
Seven P2 receptors were found to be sexually dimorphic
in freshly-isolated microglia, though the ages at which
these differences occurred varied depending on the receptor. Sexual dimorphisms were found in P2X1, P2X4,
P2Y12, and P2Y13 expression which was lower in females
than males, whereas P2X3, P2X5, and P2Y4 mRNA levels
were higher in microglia from females compared to agematched males.

At both ages when P2Y4 was expressed (3 d and 4 mo),
microglia from females had higher expression than those
from males. Although this difference was only statistically
significant at 3d, the high variability in P2Y4 expression in
females at 4 mo may result from hormonal regulation of
this gene. While breeding-age female mice in this study
were housed together, we did not identify estrous stage
prior to their sacrifice. Gonadal steroid hormone regulation of the P2Y4 gene has not been described, but we have
identified several putative estrogen response elements in
its 5' flanking region (JMC and JJW unpublished observations). Future studies will investigate the effect of estrous
cycle stage on P2Y4 expression in microglia. It should also
be noted here that the P2Y4 gene is located on the X chromosome in the mouse, human and rat, and it is the only
known P2R encoded on this chromosome.
In males, we find P2X3 mRNA levels in microglia to be
undetectable in 7 wk and 12 mo animals, whereas its
expression in females gradually increased between 21d
and 12 months. In addition, because we find that P2X3
mRNA levels decline dramatically between day 21 and 7

Page 13 of 16

Journal of Neuroinflammation 2009, 6:24

wks in males, there may be a role for maternal hormones
in regulating its expression in early postnatal male pups.
There is some evidence supporting P2X3 receptor regulation by gonadal hormones in peripheral tissues: ovariectomy has been shown to alter P2X3 expression in mouse
bladder [48], and its expression is increased in the cervix
during pregnancy [49]. We also observed that P2X1
mRNA levels were significantly lower in microglia from
12 mo females. While the expression of all P2X receptor
subtypes has been evaluated in the adult female rat reproductive tract, only a single estrous stage was examined
[50], and therefore possible changes in P2X receptor
expression patterns due to alterations in circulating steroid hormone levels could not be addressed. We are currently completing studies that more specifically evaluate
the role of female sex hormones in regulating P2R expression in microglia.
Differences between freshly-isolated microglia and
primary cultures
This study demonstrates that culturing neonatal microglia
greatly alters their P2R expression when compared to
microglia freshly-isolated from 3d mice, the age used for
making the primary cultures. P2 mRNA levels in averaged
3d male and female freshly-isolated microglia were found
to differ from that in primary mixed-sex microglial cultures by three- to over 800-fold. Culturing conditions can
alter microglial gene expression in a number of ways,
including their exposure to soluble factors in serum at
concentrations different from those in the CNS, the
absence of neurons and synaptic connections in a dish, as
well as altered microglia:astrocyte ratios from which they
are exposed in vivo. Thus, it is not unexpected that microglia, a cell type whose primary function is to monitor their
surroundings, change in response to alterations in their
environment. However, to our knowledge this is the first
report that begins to address how well primary neonatal
microglial cultures model expression in mice of different
ages and demonstrates that culturing significantly alters
P2R levels in microglia.

We also compared P2 receptor profiles in primary microglia to each of the other ages of freshly-isolated microglia.
While there were instances where expression in primary
microglia was similar to that in freshly-isolated cells, overall there was not one particular age that was most accurately represented by the P2R expression in primary
cultures. As with most in vitro experiments, extrapolation
of results obtained using primary microglia as a model
(and microglial cell lines as well), should therefore be
interpreted cautiously. However primary cultures do, at a
minimum, provide a good model for studying P2X6,
P2X7, and P2Y6 signaling in 3d mice, or P2Y2 signaling in
adult mice. Additionally P2Y1, P2Y14, and P2X3 expression in primary cultures is in between the expression levels of microglia from 3d and 21 day-old mice.

Conclusions and future directions
The data presented here provide new, sensitive and quantitative information on the impact of age and sex on P2R
mRNA expression in microglia. Although evaluating P2R
protein levels is desirable, P2X receptor mRNA levels
closely correlate with protein levels [51-53], and additional information provided by such studies would be
limited. Accurate quantitative analysis is difficult with
immunohistochemical staining, and immunoblot analysis would not allow discrimination between cell surface
receptors and intracellular pools. Several P2X immunohistochemical studies have been performed in rats by
Burnstock and colleagues (some using custom-made antibodies), however, the commercially-available antibodies
for mouse P2Rs (including many we have evaluated for
P2YRs) often show non-specific bands in immunoblots
which would be indistinguishable in immunohistochemistry ([54]; JJW unpublished observations). Therefore,
future development of antibodies having greater target
specificity is needed to provide more reliable information
on regulation of P2X and P2Y receptors at the protein
level. Additionally, as P2X channel activity is dependent
on subunit composition, FRET labeling studies using
highly-specific antibodies to identify individual P2X subunit constituents of native channels in microglia would be
very informative.

In conclusion, the present studies provide the most comprehensive information to date on the changes in P2
receptor expression in freshly-isolated microglia with age
and represent the first such study of P2YRs. These data
contribute to a better understanding of these receptors,
which have important effects on a host of microglial activities, in the normal aging CNS. Microglial inflammatory
activities in particular are implicated in the pathology of a
number of neurodegenerative diseases which emerge at
different ages. Many of these conditions are strongly sexually dimorphic, and we identified several sexual dimorphisms in P2 receptor expression. In addition, we found
many differences in P2R levels between primary neonatal
microglia and freshly-isolated microglia, which begins to
address the usefulness and accuracy of this current gold
standard for modeling purinergic signaling in vitro.
Together, these data provide important new information
necessary for future mechanistic studies on the contribution of P2Rs to the aging process and their role in CNS
inflammatory disease.
