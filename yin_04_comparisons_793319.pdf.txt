Abstract
Background: The reovirus M1 genome segment encodes the µ2 protein, a structurally minor
component of the viral core, which has been identified as a transcriptase cofactor, nucleoside and
RNA triphosphatase, and microtubule-binding protein. The µ2 protein is the most poorly
understood of the reovirus structural proteins. Genome segment sequences have been reported
for 9 of the 10 genome segments for the 3 prototypic reoviruses type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones
(T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D), but the M1 genome segment sequences for only T1L and T3D
have been previously reported. For this study, we determined the M1 nucleotide and deduced µ2
amino acid sequences for T2J, nine other reovirus field isolates, and various T3D plaque-isolated
clones from different laboratories.
Results: Determination of the T2J M1 sequence completes the analysis of all ten genome segments
of that prototype. The T2J M1 sequence contained a 1 base pair deletion in the 3' non-translated
region, compared to the T1L and T3D M1 sequences. The T2J M1 gene showed ~80% nucleotide
homology, and the encoded µ2 protein showed ~71% amino acid identity, with the T1L and T3D
M1 and µ2 sequences, respectively, making the T2J M1 gene and µ2 proteins amongst the most
divergent of all reovirus genes and proteins. Comparisons of these newly determined M1 and µ2
sequences with newly determined M1 and µ2 sequences from nine additional field isolates and a
variety of laboratory T3D clones identified conserved features and/or regions that provide clues
about µ2 structure and function.
Conclusions: The findings suggest a model for the domain organization of µ2 and provide further
evidence for a role of µ2 in viral RNA synthesis. The new sequences were also used to explore the
basis for M1/µ2-determined differences in the morphology of viral factories in infected cells. The
findings confirm the key role of Ser/Pro208 as a prevalent determinant of differences in factory
morphology among reovirus isolates and trace the divergence of this residue and its associated
phenotype among the different laboratory-specific clones of type 3 Dearing.

Background
RNA viruses represent the most significant and diverse
group of infectious agents for eukaryotic organisms on
earth [1,2]. Virtually every RNA virus, except retroviruses,
must use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to
copy its RNA genome into progeny RNA, an essential step
in viral replication and assembly. The virally encoded
RdRp is not found in uninfected eukaryotic cells and
therefore represents an attractive target for chemotherapeutic strategies to combat RNA viruses. A better understanding of the structure/function relationships of RNAvirus RdRps has been gained from recent determinations
of X-ray crystal structures for several of these proteins,
including the RdRps of poliovirus, hepatitis C virus, rabbit
calicivirus, and mammalian orthoreovirus [3-6]. However, the diverse and complex functions and regulation of
these enzymes, including their interactions with other
viral proteins and cis-acting signals in the viral RNAs,
determine that we have hardly scratched the surface for
understanding most of them.
The nonfusogenic mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) are prototype members of the family Reoviridae,
which includes segmented double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) viruses of both medical (rotavirus) and economic (orbivirus) importance (reviewed in [7-9]). Reoviruses have nonenveloped, double-shelled particles
composed of eight different structural proteins encasing
the ten dsRNA genome segments. Reovirus isolates (or
"strains") can be grouped into three serotypes, represented by three commonly studied prototype isolates:
type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing
(T3D). Sequences have been reported for all ten genome
segments of T1L and T3D, as well as for nine of the ten
segments of T2J (all but the M1 segment) (e.g., see
[10,11]). Each of these segments encodes either one or
two proteins on one of its strands, the plus strand. After
cell entry, transcriptase complexes within the infecting
reovirus particles synthesize and release full-length,
capped plus-strand copies of each genome segment. These
plus-strand RNAs are used as templates for translation by
the host machinery as well as for minus-strand synthesis
by the viral replicase complexes. The latter process produces the new dsRNA genome segments for packaging
into progeny particles. The particle locations and functions of most of the reovirus proteins have been determined by a combination of genetic, biochemical, and
biophysical techniques over the past 50 years (reviewed in
[8]).
Previous studies have identified the reovirus λ3 protein,
encoded by the L1 genome segment, as the viral RdRp
[6,12-14]. Protein λ3 is a minor component of the inner
capsid, present in only 10–12 copies per particle [15]. It
has been proposed to bind to the interior side of the inner

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/6

capsid, near the icosahedral fivefold axes, and recent work
has precisely localized it there [16,17]. In solution, purified λ3 mediates a poly(C)-dependent poly(G)-polymerase activity, but it has not been shown to use virus-specific
dsRNA or plus-strand RNA as template for plus- or minusstrand RNA synthesis, respectively [14]. This lack of activity with virus-specific templates suggests that viral or cellular cofactors may be required to make λ3 fully
functional. Within the viral particle, where only viral proteins are known to reside, these cofactors are presumably
viral in origin. The crystal structure of λ3 has provided
substantial new information about the organization of its
sequences and has suggested several new hypotheses
about its functions in viral RNA synthesis and the possible
roles of cofactors in these functions [6]. Notably, crystallized λ3 uses short viral and nonviral oligonucleotides as
templates for RNA synthesis to yield short dsRNA products [6].
The reovirus µ2 protein has been proposed as a transcriptase cofactor, but it remains the most functionally
and structurally enigmatic of the eight proteins found in
virions. Like λ3, µ2 is a minor component of the inner
capsid, present in only 20–24 copies per particle [15]. It is
thought to associate with λ3 in the particle interior, in
close juxtaposition to the icosahedral fivefold axes, but
has not been precisely localized there [16,17]. A recent
study has shown that purified µ2 and λ3 can interact in
vitro [18]. The M1 genome segment that encodes µ2 is
genetically associated with viral strain differences in the in
vitro transcriptase and nucleoside triphosphatase
(NTPase) activities of viral particles [19,20]. Recent work
with purified µ2 has shown that it can indeed function in
vitro as both an NTPase and an RNA 5'-triphosphatase
[18]. The µ2 protein has also been shown to bind RNA
and to be involved in formation of viral inclusions, also
called "factories", through microtubule binding in
infected cells [18,21-23]. Nevertheless, its precise function(s) in the reovirus replication cycle remain unclear.
Other studies have indicated that the µ2-encoding M1 segment genetically determines the severity of cytopathic
effect in mouse L929 cells, the frequency of myocarditis in
infected mice, the levels of viral growth in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, the degree of organ-specific
virulence in severe combined immunodeficiency mice,
and the level of interferon induction in cardiac myocytes
[24-29]. The complete sequence of the M1 segment has
been reported for both T1L and T3D [23,30,31]. However,
computer-based comparisons of the M1 and µ2 sequences
to others in GenBank have previously failed to show significant homology to other proteins, so that no clear indications of µ2 function have come from that approach.
Nevertheless, small regions of sequence similarity to NTPbinding motifs have been identified near the middle of
µ2, and recent work has indicated that mutations in one

For this study, we performed nucleotide-sequence determinations of the M1 genome segments of reovirus T2J,
nine other reovirus field isolates, and reovirus T3D clones
obtained from several different laboratories. The determination of the T2J M1 sequence completes the sequence
determination of all ten genome segments of that prototype strain. We reasoned that comparisons of additional
M1 and µ2 sequences may reveal conserved features and/
or regions that provide clues about µ2 structure and function. The findings provide further evidence for a role of µ2
in viral RNA synthesis. We also took advantage of the
newly available sequences to explore the basis for M1/µ2determined strain differences in the morphology of viral
factories in reovirus-infected cells.

Results and Discussion

M1 nucleotide and µ2 amino acid sequences of reovirus
T2J and nine other field isolates
We determined the nucleotide sequence of the M1
genome segment of reovirus T2J to complete the sequencing of that isolate's genome. T2J M1 was found to be 2303
base pairs in length (GenBank accession no. AF124519)
(Table 1). This is one shorter than the M1 segments of reoviruses T1L and T3D [23,30,31], due to a single base-pair
deletion in T2J corresponding to position 2272 in the 3'
nontranslated region of the T1L and T3D plus strands
(Fig. 1, Table 1). Like those of T1L and T3D, the T2J-M1
plus strand contains a single long open reading frame,
encoding a µ2 protein of 736 amino acids (Fig. 2, Table
1), having the same start and stop codons (Fig. 1), and

having a 5' nontranslated region that is only 13 nucleotides in length (Table 1). Because of the single-base deletion described above, the 3' nontranslated region of the
T2J M1 plus strand is only 82 nucleotides in length, compared to 83 for T1L and T3D (Table 1). Regardless, M1 has
the longest 3' nontranslated region of any of the genome
segments of these viruses, the next longest being 73 nucleotides in S3 (reviewed in [32]).
To gain further insights into µ2 structure/function relationships, we determined the M1 nucleotide sequences of
nine other reovirus field isolates [33,34]. The M1 segments of each of these viruses were found to be 2304 base
pairs in length (GenBank accession nos. AY428870 to
AY428877 and AY551083), the same as T1L and T3D M1
(Fig. 1). Like those of T1L, T2J, and T3D, the M1 plus
strand from each of the field isolates contains a single
long open reading frame, again encoding a µ2 protein of
736 amino acids (Fig. 2) and having the same start and
stop codons (Fig. 1). Their 5' and 3' nontranslated regions
are therefore the same lengths as those of T1L and T3D M1
(Table 1). As part of this study, we also determined the M1
nucleotide sequences of the reovirus T1L and T3D clones
routinely used in the Coombs laboratory. We found these
sequences to be identical to those recently reported for the
respective Nibert laboratory clones [23].
Further comparisons of the M1 nucleotide sequences
The T2J M1 genome segment shares 71–72% homology
with those of both T1L and T3D (Table 2). This makes T2J
M1 the most divergent of all nonfusogenic mammalian
orthoreovirus genome segments examined to date, with
the exception of the S1 segment, which encodes the

our laboratories (Coombs/Nibert).

attachment protein σ1 and which shows less than 60%
nucleotide sequence homology between serotypes
[35,36]; reviewed in [11]. In contrast, the homology
between T1L and T3D M1 is ~98%, among the highest values seen to date between reovirus genome segments from
distinct field isolates [11,31,34,37-39].
The M1 genome segments of the nine other reovirus isolates examined in this study are much more closely related

to those of T1L and T3D than to that of T2J (Table 2), as
also clearly indicated by phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3 and
data not shown). Such greater divergence of the gene
sequences of T2J has been observed to date with other segments examined from multiple reovirus field isolates
[11,34,37-39]. Type 2 simian virus 59 (T2S59) has the
next most broadly divergent M1 sequence, but it is no
more similar to the M1 sequence of T2J than it is to that
of the other isolates (Table 2, Fig. 3). In sum, the results of

Alignment of the deduced µ2 amino acid sequences of T1L, T2J, T3D, and various field isolates
Figure 2
Alignment of the deduced µ2 amino acid sequences of T1L, T2J, T3D, and various field isolates. The single-letter amino acid
code is used, and only the T1L µ2 sequence from the Brown laboratory is shown in its entirety. For other isolates, only those
amino acids that differ from this T1L sequence are shown. Clones arranged in same order as in Fig. 1; the second T1L µ2
sequence is from the Nibert and Coombs laboratories, the first T3D µ2 sequence is from the Joklik and Cashdollar laboratories, and the second T3D µ2 sequence is from the Nibert and Coombs laboratories. Amino acid positions are numbered above
the sequences. Some symbols represent various nonconservative changes among the isolates: *, change involving a charged residue; § change involving an aromatic residue; †, change involving a proline residue; ‡, change involving a cysteine residue. Residue 208, which has been previously shown to affect microtubule association by µ2, is indicated by a filled diamond. Residues
410–420 and 446–449, which have been previously identified as NTP-binding motifs are indicated by filled circles. Consecutive
runs of wholly conserved residues ≥ 15 amino acids in length are indicated by the lines numbered 1 to 8.

this study provided little or no evidence for divergence of
the M1 sequences along the lines of reovirus serotype (Fig.
3), consistent with independent reassortment and evolution of the M1 and S1 segments in nature. Upon considering the sources of these isolates [34], the results
similarly provided little or no evidence for divergence of
the M1 sequences along the lines of host, geographic
locale, or date of isolation (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with ongoing exchange of M1 segments among
reovirus strains cocirculating in different hosts and
locales. Similar conclusions have been indicated by previous studies of other genome segments from multiple reovirus field isolates [11,34,37-39]. The M1 nucleotide
sequence of type 3 clone 12 (T3C12) is almost identical to
that of the T3D clone in use in the Coombs and Nibert
laboratories, with only a single silent change (U→C) at
plus-strand position 1532 (i.e., 99.9+% homology). However, several of the T3C12 genome segments show distinguishable mobilities in polyacrylamide gels (data not
shown), confirming that T3C12 is indeed a distinct
isolate.
Further comparisons of the µ2 protein sequences
The T2J µ2 protein shares 80–81% homology with those
of both T1L and T3D (Table 2, Fig. 2). Consistent with the
M1 nucleotide sequence results, this makes T2J µ2 the

most divergent of all nonfusogenic mammalian orthoreovirus proteins examined to date, with the exception of the
S1-encoded σ1 and σ1s proteins, which show less than
55% amino acid sequence homology between serotypes
[35,36]; reviewed in [11]. In contrast, the homology
between T1L and T3D µ2 approaches 99%, among the
highest values seen to date between reovirus genome segments from distinct isolates [11,31,34,37-39]. Also
consistent with the M1 nucleotide sequence results, the µ2
proteins of the nine other reovirus isolates examined in
this study are much more closely related to those of T1L
and T3D than to that of T2J (Table 2, Fig. 3), affirming the
divergent status of the T2J µ2 protein. The µ2 protein
sequence of T3C12 is identical to that of the T3D clone in
use in the Coombs and Nibert laboratories. In addition,
the µ2 protein sequence of T1C29 is identical to that of
T3C44. These are the first times that reovirus proteins
from distinct isolates have been found to share identical
amino acid sequences [11,32,34,37-39], reflecting the
high degree of µ2 conservation.
The encoded µ2 proteins of the twelve reovirus isolates are
all calculated to have molecular masses between 83.2 and
84.0 kDa, and isoelectric points between 6.89 and 7.44
pH units (Table 1). This range of isoelectric points is the
largest yet seen among reovirus proteins other than σ1s

variable regions (Fig. 4). The two large areas of greaterthan-average sequence conservation, spanning approximately amino acids 1–250 and 400–610 (Fig. 4), are
likely to be involved in the protein's primary function(s).
The more variable, 250–400 area between the two conserved ones might represent a hinge or linker of mostly
structural importance.
As indicated earlier, µ2 is one of the most poorly understood reovirus proteins, from both a functional and a
structural point of view. For example, atomic structures
are available for seven of the eight reovirus structural proteins, with µ2 being the missing one. Thus, in an effort to
refine the model for µ2 structure/function relationships
based on regional differences, we obtained predictions for
secondary structures, hydropathy, and surface probability.
PHD PredictProtein algorithms suggest that µ2 can be
divided into four approximate regions characterized by
different patterns of predicted secondary structures (Fig.
5C). An amino-terminal region spans to residue 157, a
"variable" region spans residues 157 to 450, a "helix-rich"
region spans residues 450 to 606, and a carboxyl-terminal

• •

♦

Comparisons of the twelve µ2 sequences showed eight
highly conserved regions, each containing ≥ 15 consecutive residues that are identical in all of the isolates (Fig. 2).
The highly conserved regions are clustered in two larger
areas of µ2, spanning approximately amino acids 1–250
and amino acids 400–610. Conserved region 5 in the
400–610 area encompasses the more amino-terminal of
the two NTP-binding motifs in µ2 (Fig. 2) [18,20]. The
other NTP-binding motif is also wholly conserved, but
within a smaller consecutive run of conserved residues.
The region between the two motifs is notably variable
(Fig. 2). Conserved region 5 also contains the less conservative of the two amino acid substitutions in T1L-derived
temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant tsH11.2 (Pro414→His)
[40]. The pattern of conserved and variable areas of µ2
was also seen by plotting scores for sequence identity in
running windows over the protein length (e.g., [32]). In
addition to the conserved regions described above, areas
of greater than average variation are evident in this plot,
spanning approximately amino acids 250–400 and 610–
736 (the carboxyl terminus) (Fig. 4). The 250–400 area is
notable for regularly oscillating between conserved and

[11], but is largely attributable to the divergent value of
T2J µ2 (others range only from 6.89 to 7.10). The substantially higher isoelectric point of T2J µ2 is explained by it
containing a larger number of basic residues (excess
arginine) than do the other isolates (Table 1).

region spans the sequences after residue 606. The aminoterminal region contains six predicted α-helices and three
predicted β-strands, and is highly conserved across all
twelve µ2 sequences. The "variable" region is the most
structurally complex and contains numerous interspersed
α-helices and β-strands. The "helix-rich" region contains
seven α-helices and is highly conserved across all twelve
µ2 sequences. The carboxyl-terminal region varies across
all three serotypes. Overall, the µ2 protein is predicted to
be 48% α-helical and 14% β-sheet in composition, making it an "α-β " protein according to the CATH designation
[41]. Interestingly, most tyrosine protein kinases with SH2
domains are also "α-β " proteins by this designation. The
T1L and T3D µ2 hydropathy profiles were identical to
each other. Both show numerous regions of similarity to
the hydropathy profile of the T2J µ2. However, there also
are several distinct differences between the T1L and T2J
profiles (Fig. 5). Alterations in amino acid charge at residues 32, 430 to 432, and 673 in the T2J sequence account
for the major differences in hydrophobicity between T2J
and the other serotypes. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal 66 residues show multiple differences in hydropathy.
The surface probability profiles of each of the three serotype's µ2 proteins are identical (Fig. 5) and show numerous regions that are highly predicted to be exposed at the
surface of the protein as well as regions predicted to be
buried.
The MOTIF and FingerPRINTScan programs were used to
compare the highly conserved regions of µ2 with other
sequences in protein data banks (ProSite, Blocks, and ProDomain). The results revealed that several of the conserved regions in µ2 share limited similarities with
members of the DNA polymerase A family and with the
SH2 domain of tyrosine kinases. The sequence YEAgDV in
µ2, located in conserved region 2 (Fig. 2), is similar to the
"YAD" motif of DNA polymerase A from a number of different bacteria (e.g., YEADDV in Deinococcus radiodurans).
The YAD motif is located in the exonuclease region of
DNA polymerase A, a region which also functions as an
NTPase and enhances the rate of DNA polymerization
[42]. The SH2 domain of tyrosine kinases was the highest
score hit for the conserved regions of µ2 with FingerPRINTScan. Four of the five motifs in the 100 amino acid
SH2 domain matched the µ2 sequence. The SH2 domain
mediates protein-protein interactions through its capacity
to bind phosphotyrosine [43]. The protein motifs found
by focusing on the conserved regions of µ2 provide supportive evidence that this protein is involved in nucleotide
binding and metabolism. However, the described similarities did not match with greater than 90% certainty and no
other significant homologies were detected. The inability
to identify higher-scoring GenBank similarities, first
noted when sequences of the T3D and T1L M1 genes were

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/6

reported [30,31] attests to the uniqueness of this minor
core protein.
Biochemical confirmations
In an effort to provide biochemical confirmation of the
predicted variation in the different isolates' µ2 proteins,
we analyzed the T1L, T2J, and T3D proteins by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and immunoblotting. Despite the slightly larger
molecular mass calculated from its sequence (Table 1),
T2J µ2 displayed a slightly smaller relative molecular
weight on gels than T1L and T3D µ2 (Fig. 6A). This aberrant mobility may reflect the higher isoelectric point of
T2J µ2 (Table 1). Polyclonal anti-µ2 antibodies that had
been raised against purified T1L µ2 [44] reacted strongly
with both T1L and T3D µ2, but only weakly with T2J µ2
(Fig. 6B), despite equal band loading as demonstrated by
Ponceau S staining. These antibody cross-reactivities correlated well with the predicted protein homologies (Table
2).
Factory morphologies among reovirus field isolates
We took advantage of the new M1/µ2 sequences to extend
analysis of the role of µ2 in determining differences in
viral factory morphology among reovirus isolates [23].
Sequence variation at µ2 residue Pro/Ser208 was previously indicated to determine the different morphologies
of T1L and T3D factories: Pro208 is associated with microtubule-anchored filamentous factories, as in T1L and the
Cashdollar laboratory clone of T3D, whereas Ser208 is
associated with globular factories, as in the Nibert laboratory clone of T3D [23]. For the previous study we had
already examined the factories of T2J and some of the nine
other isolates used for M1 sequencing above. We
nonetheless newly examined the factories of all ten isolates in the present study, using the same stocks used for
sequencing. T3C12 was the only one of these isolates that
formed globular factories; the remainder, including T2J,
formed filamentous factories (Fig. 7, Table 4). This
finding is consistent with the fact that T3C12 is the only
one of these isolates that has a serine at µ2 residue 208,
like T3D from the Nibert laboratory; the remainder, like
T1L and T3D from the Cashdollar laboratory, have a proline there (Fig. 2, Table 4) [23]. Thus, although the results
identify no additional µ2 residues that may influence factory morphology, they are consistent with the identification of Pro/Ser208 as a prevalent determinant of
differences in this phenotype among reovirus isolates.
Factory morphologies and M1/µ2 sequences of other T3D
and T3D-derived clones
T3D clones from the Nibert and Cashdollar laboratories
have been shown to exhibit different factory morphologies based on differences in the microtubule-binding
capacities of their µ2 proteins and the presence of either

SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of virion and core
SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of virion and core particles. Proteins from gradient-purified T1L (1), T2J (2), and

then fixed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250
and silver (A). Alternatively, proteins from the gels were
transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-µ2 antiserum

serine or proline at µ2 residue 208 [23]. We took the
opportunity in this study to examine additional T3D
clones. The clones from some laboratories formed
globular factories in infected cells whereas those from
other laboratories or the American Type Culture
Collection formed filamentous factories (Fig. 8, Table 5).
T3D-derived ts mutants tsC447, tsE320, and tsG453 [45]
formed filamentous factories (Fig. 8, Table 5). Other ts
mutants were not examined; however, [46] have shown
evidence that tsF556 [45] forms filamentous factories as
well.
We additionally determined the M1 sequences of the
wild-type and ts T3D clones newly tested for factory morphology. All clones with globular factories have a serine at
µ2 position 208 whereas all those with filamentous factories have a proline there (Table 5). These findings provide
further evidence for the influence of residue 208 on this
phenotypic difference.
All wild-type T3D clones with globular factories were
recently derived from a Fields laboratory parent whereas
all wild-type or ts T3D clones with filamentous factories

were derived from parents in other laboratories.
(Although extensively characterized by both Fields (e.g.,
[47,48]) and Joklik (e.g., [49,50]), the original T3Dderived ts mutants in groups A through G were generated
in the Joklik laboratory [45]). This correlation suggests
that formation of filamentous factories is the ancestral
phenotype of reovirus T3D and that the Ser208 mutation
in T3D µ2 was established later, in the Fields laboratory.
As we noted in a previous study [23], several other laboratories reported evidence for filamentous T3D factories in
the 1960's (e.g., [51,52]), following its isolation in 1955
[53]. Since microtubules were noted to be commonly
associated with T3D factories in Fields laboratory publications from as late as 1973 [54], but not in one from 1979
[55], the µ2 Ser208 mutation was probably established in,
or introduced into, that laboratory during the middle
1970's. Investigators should be alert to these different lineages of T3D and their derivatives for genetic studies. For
example, reassortant 3HA1 [56] contains a T3D M1
genome segment derived from clone tsC447, and its factory phenotype is filamentous (data not shown).
Additional genome-wide comparisons of T1L, T2J, and
T3D
Several types of genome-wide comparisons of T1L, T2J,
and T3D have been reported previously [11]. For this
study we examined the positions and types of nucleotide
mismatches in these prototype isolates in order to gain a
more comprehensive view of the evolutionary divergence
of their protein-coding sequences. Most mismatches
between T2J and either T1L or T3D segments, ~68%, are
in the third codon base position, while ~21% are in the
first position and ~11% are in the second position. Each
of these mismatch percentages was converted to an evolutionary divergence value by multiplying mismatch
percentage by 1.33 [31] (Table 3). These values have been
used to argue that the homologous T1L and T3D genome
segments diverged from common ancestors at different
times in the past, with the M1 and L3 segments having
diverged most recently and the M2, S1, S2, and S3 segments having diverged longer ago [31]. The consistently
high values for divergence at third codon base positions
among pairings with T2J genome segments (Table 3) indicate that all ten T2J segments diverged from common
ancestors substantially before their respective T1L and
T3D homologs. Relative numbers of synonymous and
nonsynonymous nucleotide changes identified in pairwise comparisons of the coding sequences of these isolates (Table 3) support the same conclusion.

The types of amino acid substitutions within each of the
prototype isolates' proteins were also examined. Pairwise
analyses showed that most substitutions in most proteins
were conservative (Table 3). Nonconservative substitutions were relatively rare in most proteins' pair-wise com-

proteins showed none (0.0%) of the 10 amino acid substitutions were nonconservative, and most T1L:T3D comparisons gave low nonconservative substitution values

ranging from 0.1–0.5% of total amino acid residues
within the respective proteins. However, some genes,
most notably M1, M3, and S3, demonstrated higher nonconservative variation, with values approaching 3.5% of

total amino acid residues. Most of these higher nonconservative substitution values were observed when T2J proteins were compared to either T1L or T3D proteins. In
addition, in many proteins, the majority of nonconservative substitutions were located within the amino-terminal
portions (first ~20%) of the respective proteins (data not
shown).
The frequencies with which different redundant codons
are used to encode certain mammalian amino acids are
non-random (reviewed in [57]). This phenomenon is
mirrored by different abundances of the complementary
tRNA molecules in mammalian cells. For example, CG
pairs are underrepresented in mammalian genomes and
common in their "rare" codons (see Table 6). A recent
study revealed that many RNA viruses of humans display
mild deviations from host codon-usage frequencies and

that these deviations are more prominent among viruses
with segmented genomes [57]. However, reoviruses were
not included in that study. By examining reovirus isolates
T1L, T2J, and T3D, for which whole-genome sequences
are now available, we found that codons that qualify as
rare in mammals are not rare in reovirus (Table 6). Moreover, the few codons that qualify as rare in reovirus (ACC,
AGC, CCC, CGG, CUC, and GCC; data not shown) are
common in mammals. The basis and significance of these
deviations remain unknown, but could have impacts on
the rates of translation of reovirus proteins. It is perhaps
notable in this regard that the four most highly expressed
reovirus proteins (µ1, σ3, µNS, and σNS) have the lowest
average frequencies of codons that are rare in mammals
(Table 6). Thus, incorporation of rare codons into reovirus coding sequences could be a mechanism of dampening the expression of certain viral proteins.

Methods
Cells and viruses
Reoviruses T1L, T2J, T3D, and T3C12 were Coombs and/
or Nibert laboratory stocks. Other reovirus isolates were
provided by Dr. T. S. Dermody (Vanderbilt University).
Virus clones were amplified to the second passage in
murine L929 cell monolayers in Joklik's modified minimal essential medium (Gibco) supplemented to contain
2.5% fetal calf serum (Intergen), 2.5% neonatal bovine
serum (Biocell), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1 µg/ml amphotericin B,
and large amounts of virus were grown in spinner culture,
extracted with Freon (DuPont) or Vertrel-XF (DuPont),
and purified in CsCl gradients, all as previously described
[19,58].
Sequencing the M1 genome segments
All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Gibco/
BRL. Genomic dsRNA was extracted from gradient-purified virions with phenol/chloroform [59]. Strain identity
was confirmed by resolving aliquots of each in 10% SDSPAGE gels and comparing dsRNA band mobilities [60].
Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to either the 5'
end of the plus strand or the 5' end of the minus strand
were as previously described [40]. Additional oligonucleotides for sequencing were designed and obtained as
needed. cDNA copies of the M1 genes of each virus were
constructed by using the 5' oligonucleotide primers and
reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL). The cDNAs were
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction [61] and
resolved in 0.7% agarose gels [59]. The bands corresponding to the 2.3-kb gene were then excised, purified, and

eluted with Qiagen columns, using the manufacterer's
instructions. Sequences of the respective cDNAs were
determined in both directions by dideoxynucleotide cycle
sequencing
[62-64],
using
fluorescent
dideoxynucleotides.
Sequences at the termini of each M1 segment were determined by one or both of two methods. For some isolates,
sequences near the ends of the segment were determined
by modified procedures for rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE) as previously described [32,65]. In addition,
the sequences at the ends of all M1 segments were determined in both directions by a modification of the 3'-ligation method described by Lambden et al. [66]. Briefly,
viral genes from gradient-purified virions were resolved in
a 1% agarose gel, and the M segments were excised and
eluted with Qiagen columns as described above.
Oligonucleotide 3'L1 (5'-CCCCAACCCACTTTTTCCATTACGCCCCTTTCCCCC-3'; phosphorylated at the 5' end
and blocked with a biotin group at the 3' end) was ligated
to the 3' ends of the M segments according to the manufacterer's directions (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C
overnight. The ligated genes were repurified by agarose gel
and Qiagen columns to remove unincorporated 3'L1 oligonucleotide and precipitated overnight with ice-cold ethanol. The precipitated genes were dissolved in 4 µl of 90%
dimethyl sulfoxide. cDNA copies of the ligated M1 genes
were constructed by using oligonucleotide 3'L2 (5'GGGGGAAAGGGGCGTAATGGAAAAAGTGGGTTGGGG-3') and gene-specific internal oligonucleotide
primers designed to generate a product of 0.5 to 1.2 kb in
length. These constructs were amplified by PCR, purified

in 1.5% agarose gels, excised, and eluted as described
above. Sequences of these cDNAs were determined with
gene-specific internal oligonucleotides and with
oligonucleotide 3'L3 (5'-GGGGGAAAGGGGCGTAAT-3')
by dideoxy-fluorescence methods.
Sequence analyses
DNA sequences were analyzed with DNASTAR, DNA
Strider, BLITZ, BLAST, and CLUSTAL-W. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed using the PHYLIP programs
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html. DNAPARS (parsimony) (Fig. 3) and DNAML (maximum likelihood) (data not shown) produced essentially identical

trees. These programs were run using the Jumble option to
test the trees using 50 different, randomly generated
orders of adding the different sequences. In addition,
DNAPENNY (parsimony by brand-and-bound algorithm)
generated a tree with the same branch orders as DNAPARS
and DNAML. RETREE and DRAWGRAM were used to visualize the tree and to prepare the image for publication.
Final refinement of the image was performed with
Illustrator. Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution frequencies were calculated according to the methods
of Nei and Gojobori [67] as applied by Dr. B. Korber at
http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/hcv-db/SNAP/SNAP.html.
Codon frequencies in the M1 coding sequences were
determined using the COUNTCODON program maintained
at
http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/countco
don.html. Values for codon frequencies in mammalian
genomes were obtained from the Codon Usage Database
maintained at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/.
Protein sequence analyses were performed using the GCG
programs in SeqWeb version 2 (Accelrys). Multiple
sequence alignments were done with PRETTY. Determinations of molecular weights, isoelectric points, and residue
counts were done with PEPTIDESORT. Determinations of
percent identities in pairwise comparisons were done with
GAP. Plots of sequence identity over running windows of
different numbers of amino acids (Fig. 4 and data not
shown) were generated with PLOTSIMILARITY, and the
image for publication was refined with Illustrator (Adobe
Systems). In addition, protein sequences were analysed
for conservative and nonconservative substitutions by
pairwise CLUSTAL-W analyses, using BLOSUM matrix
weighting [68].
SDS-PAGE
Gradient-purified virus and core samples were dissolved
in electrophoresis sample buffer (0.24 M Tris [pH 6.8],
1.5% dithiothreitol, 1% SDS), heated to 95°C for 3–5
min, and resolved in a 5–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel
(16.0 × 12.0 × 0.1 cm) [69] at 5 mA for 18 h. Some sets of
resolved proteins were fixed, and stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue R-250 and/or silver [70].
Immunoblotting
Gradient-purified viral and core proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE as described above, and sets of resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a
Semi-Dry Transblot manifold (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer of
all proteins was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Nonspecific binding was blocked in TBS-T (10 mM Tris [pH
7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with
5% milk proteins, and the membranes probed with polyvalent anti-µ2 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. E. G. Brown,
University of Ottawa). Membranes were washed with TBS-

24 h at 37°C before fixation for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS or 3 min at -20°C in
ice-cold methanol. Fixed cells were washed with PBS three
times and permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing
1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100.
Antibody was diluted in the blocking solution and incubated with cells for 25–40 min at room temperature. After
three washes in PBS, cover slips were mounted on glass
slides with Prolong (Molecular Probes). Samples were
examined using a Nikon TE-300 inverted microscope
equipped with phase and fluorescence optics, and images
were collected digitally as described elsewhere [23]. All
images were processed and prepared for presentation
using Photoshop (Adobe Systems).
