Abstract
Background: Cleavage of messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors is an essential step in mRNA
maturation. The signal recognized by the cleavage enzyme complex has been characterized as an A
rich region upstream of the cleavage site containing a motif with consensus AAUAAA, followed by
a U or UG rich region downstream of the cleavage site.
Results: We studied these signals using exhaustive databases of cleavage sites obtained from
aligning raw expressed sequence tags (EST) sequences to genomic sequences in Homo sapiens and
Drosophila melanogaster. These data show that the polyadenylation signal is highly conserved in
human and fly. In addition, de novo motif searches generated a refined description of the U-rich
downstream sequence (DSE) element, which shows more divergence between the two species.
These refined motifs are applied, within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework, to predict
mRNA cleavage sites.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that the DSE is a specific motif in both human and Drosophila. These
findings shed light on the sequence correlates of a highly conserved biological process, and improve
in silico prediction of 3' mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation sites.

Background
The process of mRNA 3' end formation requires premRNA cleavage followed by polyadenylation. Recent
reports support the hypothesis that cleavage occurs during
transcription and directly influences transcription termination in yeast and human cells [1,2]. mRNA cleavage in
mammals is thought to be controlled by two dominant
sequence signals, the well defined polyadenylation signal
(PAS) located 10–30 bases upstream of mRNA cleavage
site (CS) and a less conserved U-rich sequence, called

downstream sequence element (DSE) and located within
the first 30 nucleotides downstream of the CS. Protein
complexes involved in cleavage and polyadenylation have
been identified: the PAS is bound by the cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor (CSPF), while the DSE
recruits the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) (reviewed
in [3]).
In mammals, the PAS has been identified early on from its
high degree of conservation [4] and studies have shown

that point mutations of the consensus sequence AAUAAA
decrease or abolish polyadenylation efficiency [5]. However, genome-wide analysis of PAS clearly shows that
some variants which are less efficient in vitro are functional in vivo [6,7]. The second important region, the DSE,
is less conserved in mammalian genes and no clear consensus signal has been defined [3]. Tabaska and Zhang
suggested a consensus motif based on motif searches in
~100 test sequences [8]. Counting overrepresented words
identified U-rich hexamers in genome-aligned fly ESTs
[25], but failed to identify a conserved DSE motif in
human[9]. Selex experiments reported binding of CstF to
a small number of related sequences (reviewed in [3]),
while NMR studies suggested that a stretch of two adjacent
uridines is crucial for CstF binding [10].
The position of the CS was shown to be primarily defined
by the distance between the PAS and the DSE, and to
occur preferentially 5' of an adenine [11]. Survey of Unigene clusters show that the positions in the CSs of individual ESTs in a cluster tend to vary over a distance of 30–40
nucleotides [12]. This micro-variability in the cleavage
position further suggests that the fixed anchors governing
the cleavage process are the PAS and DSE and not the CS
itself.
Accurate characterization of 3' termination is particularly
relevant for gene prediction programs. To define the 3'ends of genes, the HMMgene program scans for the occurrence of the AAUAAA hexanucleotide (A. Krogh, personal
communication) while Genscan [13] applies a simplified
model of the mRNA cleavage site that uses an approximate scoring for the PAS irrespective of the presence of a
DSE. Thus, these programs are prone to false positives and
ignore mRNA CSs that do not match this motif. Attempts
to take into account other sequence features of the CS
region in human sequences used different computational
approaches. In a program called poladq, Tabaska and
Zhang [8] included the DSE motif using a quadratic discriminant function. Legendre and Gautheret [9] designed a
weight matrix based on the nucleotide composition in the
46 bases following the PAS. Both programs search the
genomic sequence for the occurrence of a PAS, and then
scan the putative positives for further signals. Recent
reports have successfully demonstrated the applicability
of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to the problem in S.
cerevisiae [14] or C. elegans [15].
Here, we take advantage of the systematic mapping of the
raw data from >1'500'000 human 3'ESTs [16] and of
>30'000 Drosophila 3'ESTs to their respective genomes to
model and compare PAS and DSE signals in both species
using a HMM framework. This study establishes that the
main features of mRNA cleavage regions are clearly conserved between both species, with a highly conserved PAS

signal and the presence of a DSE in both species. Model
assessment showed that including the DSE in HMMs significantly improves the accuracy of CS predictions.

Results
3'UTR length
We compared the length of human and Drosophila 3'UTRs defined as the distance between the stop codon and
the CS (Figure 1B). To avoid ambiguities, only sites from
genes with a unique stop codon, documented by at least
one entry in RefSeq were included. Both length distributions are good exponentials with characteristic lengths of
995 bases in human and 200 bases in Drosophila.
Polyadenylation signal variants
We investigated the frequencies of PAS variants reported
in [6], in the 50 bp upstream of CS documented by 3' tags.
Tags with matches to multiple variants were attributed to
the most common variant, so that each tag counted only
once. 46.7% of human and 47.7% of Drosophila sequences
had the main PAS variant AAUAAA, while 16% (10%)
had the second motif AUUAAA. Less common motifs
were present within both species, but interestingly 15% of
human bona fide cleavage sites (22.47% in Drosophila) had
none of the previously reported PAS motifs (Table 1). This
suggests that cleavage can be induced by yet unknown signals and/or mechanisms. However, we were unable to
find such signals in this dataset.
Compositional bias near mRNA CSs
To examine the nucleotide composition of all polyadenylation regions, we considered for each site the 100 bases
consisting of the 50 bases upstream of the CS followed by
50 bases from the genomic sequence. Collected tags are
then aligned on the position of mRNA cleavage occurring
between position 50 and 51, following reports showing
that mRNA cleavage occurs preferentially 5' of an A [11].
If the nucleotides immediately 5' of the mRNA CS are one
or several A's, the mapping procedure causes an unavoidable ambiguity in the real position of the cleavage. This is
reflected by the absence of A's at position 50 and the
amplification of the sharp peak in position 51. Nevertheless, simulations show that the human cleavage regions
(Figure 2A) have significantly higher A frequency at position 51 (~80%) than random sequence with identical
nucleotide composition (not shown).

Other noticeable features include an A-rich region 15–25
bases upstream of the CS (positions 20–35 in Figure 2A,
encompassing the PAS), and a U-rich region 10–25 bases
downstream of the CS (positions 60–75). The A-rich
region upstream of the CS is followed by a narrower (~5
nt) U-rich peak, then a small A-rich region, and possibly
another U-rich peak immediately before the mRNA CS.
An increase in Gs is visible between 5 and 10 nucleotides

participation of several observed regions in the cleavage
process.

Interestingly, all features described above are conserved in
Drosophila (Figure 2B). The A frequency at position 51
reaches 90%, which is noticeably higher than in human
regions. We computed the average A frequency in the 10
bases encompassing mRNA CS. In human the A frequency
in this region is 32,3%, which is close to the average
sequence composition of the polyadenylation regions.
Drosophila sequences show a local increase to 45,4% A's
near the CS compared to a 34,25% average A content. The
coarse compositional bias in the mRNA cleavage region is
clearly conserved between both species, pointing to a
functional conservation of mRNA cleavage and possibly a

Sequence motifs near cleavage sites
Using unsupervised motif searches, we investigated
whether specific sequence motifs would further characterize the neighborhood of the CS. For humans (respectively
Drosophila) 3'UTR tags were searched in groups of 250 (cf.
Methods) and two dominant signals were identified. Figure 3A shows the positional bias of both signals and this
information was incorporated in our definitions of the
weight matrices (cf. Material and Methods and Figure 3).

AAUAAA was unambiguously found as the dominant signal in both species, followed by weaker U-rich signals

downstream of the CS. No other motifs occurred systematically. The human polyadenylation signal (3B) shows a
very strong AAUAAA consensus, with a substitution of A
to U at position 2 occurring in ~20% of the cases, consistent with observed frequency of the AUUAAA variants
(table 1). The Drosophila PAS (Figure 3D) is remarkably
similar (details in Table 2), and the differences reflect the
slight variations in proportion of different variants shown
in table 1. Although the significance of the second motif
(DSE) was marginal, its consistency across independent
sets and positional bias suggested that we identified a
putative human DSE (Figure 3C). Notice that this DSE
seems related to that identified by Tabaska & Zhang [8],
albeit shorter by 3 nucleotides. Information content (cf.
Methods) did not support this extension in our dataset.
Scanning by information content (cf. Methods) indicated
that a longer descriptor did not improve performance in
our dataset. The second motif identified in Drosophila is
also U-rich, and similarly positioned relative to mRNA CS
as the human DSE (Figure 3A). However, the profile is
clearly different (Figure 3E). Based on its sequence and
nucleotide composition, we refer to this motif as the Drosophila DSE.

HMM model for polyadenylation sites
To establish whether the DSE element would help to predict cleavage sites, we constructed a HMM model for the
detection of polyadenylation sites in genomic sequences
(Figure 4). The model uses the two matrices, linked by a
spacer with Gaussian length distribution of mean 40 bases
and standard deviation (SD) 11 in human and Drosophila.
These parameters are close to those estimated from Figure
3 and showed optimal behavior in the predictions. We
investigated several other sequence features, such as dinucleotide frequencies at the CS, extended PAS and DSE
matrices, or different background emission probabilities
in each background region, including first order dinucleotide background models. With the exception of the second matrix, we found no evidence that any of these
additions would improve polyadenylation site prediction
using our evaluation procedures (see below). We therefore restricted further study to the one (PAS-only, Figure
4B) versus two matrix (Double) model (Figure 4A).

Model parameters were optimized and performances were
evaluated using two different approaches, one in which
we compared optimal scores (Forward decoding) for real

both human and Drosophila, the models including both
PAS and DSE weight matrices were clearly more specific
than the single weight matrix model. The ERPIN program

higher specificity of our model.

Furthermore, to assess the specificity of the DSE weight
matrices, we substituted the DSE matrix with U-rich profiles. The DSE matrix was replaced with a profile of the
whole U-rich region (bases 55 to 80, see figure 2A and
2B). The use of this 25-nt weight matrix decreases the specificity of polyadenylation site prediction in both human
and Drosophila 3'UTRs (Figure 5A and 5B, green curve).
Both DSE profiles include specific positions that have
strong preferences for non-U (C or G) nucleotides (figure
3C and 3E). To assess whether these significantly contributed to the DSE specificity, positions 4 and 6 in the
human DSE matrix and position 2 in Drosophila DSE were
replaced with background nucleotide frequency. Each of
these small changes of the DSE profiles resulted in a systematic decrease in specificity (Figure 5A and 5B, blue
curves).
Prediction of 3' mRNA termination
Since mRNA cleavage is thought to occur at the 5'-most
site having a sufficiently strong cleavage signal [3], we
designed a prediction paradigm that mimics the biological cleavage process. After model optimization (cf.

(PLP) of the PAS for each nucleotide in each human test
sequence. To measure the sensitivity and specificity of the
predictions, a range of thresholds in PLP was chosen. For
each fixed threshold and each sequence, we checked if the
first position after the stop codon with a PLP above the
threshold matches a known polyadenylation site. More
precisely, the prediction was considered a true positive
(TP) if its position occurred at most 40 bases upstream of
the 5' end of a documented site (shown in Figure S1). Predictions falling outside were considered false positives
(FP) and sequences having no prediction exceeding the
threshold were counted as false negatives (FN). As our
specificity and sensitivity assessment relies on the
assumption that all existing mRNA cleavage sites have
been documented, we applied this procedure only to
human 3'UTRs. For Drosophila, the coverage of 3P tags is
unlikely to be complete.
The sensitivity and specificity analysis shows that incorporation of the DSE improves the prediction quality for all
PLP thresholds tested (Figure 6). The increase in specificity due to the DSE is between 2 and 5%, and is relatively
uniform as a function of sensitivity although it slightly
increases at higher sensitivity (Figure 6A). For human
3'UTRs of 3000 bases, we achieved a specificity of 77%
when setting the sensitivity to 50% (and 64% for a sensitivity of 90%). Legendre and Gautheret [9] expressed their
results by comparing the predictions on 1000 bp long
3'UTRs to a series of control sets, such as shuffled 3'UTRs
and intron sequences. For a sensitivity of 55%, they
reported a specificity of 72 to 84% for their program
depending on the control set, and 68 to 82% for the pro-

gram of Tabaska and Zhang (1999). To avoid variation
due to selection of the control set, we quantified our predictions by comparing them to experimentally documented polyadenylation sites. Using this strategy, we
achieved specificity and sensitivity values comparable to
those reported by Legendre and Gautheret, even though
we scanned sequences that were three times longer.

Discussion
Sequence characteristics around the mRNA cleavage site
To investigate polyadenylation signals we used an exhaustive and unbiased database of CSs based on systematic
mapping of all expressed sequences (cf. Methods) to
genomes. Applying the same protocol to human and fly
allowed pointing out strong similarities in the organization of their mRNA cleavage site regions. Based on these
datasets, we identified PAS and DSE in both species, and
confirmed the specificity and relevance of these signals for
mRNA cleavage site prediction.

We defined as trustable CSs all genome-aligned EST reads
containing a polyA sequence not present on the genome.
Thus, our data differed from those assembled by [9] or
[19] in two main aspects. First, we did not require the CS
ESTs to overlap with a RefSeq, which allows us to take into
account distant polyadenylation sites that might not be
covered by mRNA sequences in RefSeq, which are very
often incomplete at their 3' ends. Similarly, in [], the candidate EST tags were derived from Unigene clusters, which
might also counterselect distant downstream polyadenylation sites. Secondly CS were not selected for the presence of well-described PAS variants. In fact, scanning our
CSs for the 13 common PAS variants [6] confirmed most
of them and revealed very similar distributions in both
species. The relative frequency of PAS motifs might reflect
the efficacy of their recognition by the CSPF, and suggests
that the specificity of this enzyme is well conserved
between the two species. Interestingly, 15% of human
mRNA cleavage sites (22% in Drosophila) do not have any
of the previously described PAS motifs. Absence of overrepresented signals in these suggests that cleavage might
happen via an alternative mechanism. Compared to the
numbers reported by Beaudoing at al [6], and Tian et al [],
we observe a lower frequency of all known polyadenylation variants, and a higher proportion of sequences without any known variant. We performed additional tests
that ruled out a widespread contamination of our dataset
with false priming sequences. Rather, detailed analysis
suggests that the proportion of the main PAS variants
increases with the number of tags documenting a PAS, so
that the lower numbers that we observe are due to the
more complete coverage of our dataset. Consistently with
what was found in [], the fine structure of the features
observed in the nucleotide profiles in human mRNA CS
region is largely conserved in Drosophila, while studies of

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:176

CSs in C. elegans [15] and S. cerevisiae (reviewed in [3])
showed different profiles. Recent phylogenetic studies
confirm that arthropods are closer to chordates than to
nematodes [20]. Our observation is thus consistent with
this finding, and may indicate that CS organization in
human and Drosophila melanogaster sequences evolved
before separation of arthropods and chordates.
The similarities between human and Drosophila mRNA CS
regions led us to search for finer sequence motifs. We consistently identified the well-known PAS motif AAUAAA
and a weaker U-rich motif that we interpreted as the DSE.
Our consensus sequence for the human DSE (Figure 3C)
is U [U/G]UCU [G/U]U. Tabaska and Zhang identified a
similar DSE using a much smaller dataset and a motifsearch tool (gibbs-seq) searching for two copies per fragment, while we required only one occurrence per
sequence. A recent detailed study focusing on motifs
involved in alternative polyadenylation [] reports 4 conserved UG-rich motifs in the DSE regions, one of them
(CDE.1) is very similar to the motif we found in all polyadenylation site tags. DSE weight matrices derived from
human 3UTRs with one of the four main PAS variants [see
Additional file 1, table 1] are extremely similar, although
they slightly more polarized in the sequences lacking the
AAUAAA variant. Our refined DSE motif, a U-rich motif
with conserved G residues, confirms the presence of a DSE
in Drosophila, as suggested earlier in word-searches using
a smaller set of ESTs []. Its similarity with the human DSE
is consistent with observations that crucial residues for
RNA binding in C-terminus of the RNA-binding domain
of CstF-64 are conservatively substituted in Drosophila
[10]. It is possible that the lower information content of
the DSE as compared to the PAS reflects true biological
variability of DSE, important for the control of alternative
polyadenylation. Variability in DSE motifs might influence this process as it was postulated that the presence of
sub-optimal DSE sequences causes a differential choice of
polyadenylation sites depending on the expression level
of CstF protein [10]. We investigated the relationship
between the PAS and DSE motifs, but we do not see significant difference between the DSE WMs derived from
sequences with different PAS variants [see Additional file
1, table 2]. However, the DSE motifs could be tissue-specific. Different consensus sequences might be bound by
tissue-specific isoforms of CstF-RNA binding subunits
[21] or competitor proteins [22].
Prediction of 3' mRNA termination
We used the derived PAS and DSE motifs to build a probabilistic model of human and Drosophila mRNA CSs. Previously constructed tools for human CS prediction used a
quadratic discriminant function [8] or were based on RNA
secondary structure [9]. Both tools require the presence of
the main AAUAAA or AUUAAA variants of the polyade-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/176

nylation motif. We chose the HMM framework, which
makes our approach suitable for easy incorporation in
gene prediction programs[13]. Similar approaches have
been used for prediction of mRNA cleavage in yeast [14]
and C. elegans[15], with more complex models of the
polyadenylation region including 4 to 6 distinct subsequent signal regions interspersed with higher order background models. Our model consists of the PAS and DSE
weight matrices chained together by a Gaussian zero-th
order background spacer reflecting the distance between
the 2 motifs (Figure 4A). We have verified that higher
order background models did not change the predictions
significantly. In both human and Drosophila, inclusion of
DSE elements in HMMs increased the accuracy of the
model predictions. However, our model does not include
a signal for the CS itself. These putative signals cover only
one or two bases, and have variable locations with respect
to both PAS and DSE (microvariability in the CS [12]).
Using CS signals did not improve our predictions. We
assessed the performance of the model in human
sequences using documented mRNA cleavage sites and
our model performed better in mRNA CS recognition
than previously reported tools (cf. Figure 5). In test
sequences containing 3'000 bp downstream of the translation stop codon, we achieved a specificity of 70% for a
sensitivity of 80%. Notice that we did not require the presence of the main variants of the PAS. However, as this
matrix is more informative than the DSE, PLP scores are
dominated by the PAS and sites strongly differing from
the consensus will tend to be missed (false negatives, [see
Additional file 1, Figure 1]). So even though our prediction specificity is high, differentially weighting the PAS
and DSE might lead to further improvements. In fact, the
reported specificity might be underestimated, since our
evaluation procedure assumed that all existing polyadenylation sites are documented with 3' tags. This probably
results in our overestimation of false positives. One extension to improve our current model would be to exploit
comparative genomics to define more precise DSE weight
matrices, which should be possible for both mammals
and insects.

Conclusion
We analyzed the sequence region encompassing mRNA
cleavage site in human and Drosophila ESTs, derived PAS
and DSE motifs for both species and proved their specificity. We integrated these motifs into a HMM which predicts mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation sites with
higher specificity than previously published tools.
Moreover, we show that the sequence regions involved in
polyadenylation are highly conserved between these two
species. Our study underlines the value of using the primary sequence data derived from EST projects, as well as
genome sequences, for the large-scale documentation and

analysis of polyadenylation sites. With the constantly
increasing number of available ESTs, future studies might
uncover sequence signals that control tissue specific regulation of alternative polyadenylation.

Methods
Polyadenylation tags for human and Drosophila
melanogaster
We mapped all publicly available human (described in
[16]; data available at our ftp site []) and Drosophila EST
reads (246'248 EST sequences from BGDP EST collection,
raw sequencing data, obtained from Dr. Mark Stapleton,
BGDP) to the corresponding genomes. The sequences that
matched the genome with at most 2 mismatches and
ended with at least 10 A's not present in the genome were
taken to be derived from bona fide polyadenylation events.
The genome sequences spanning from -50 to + 50 bp relative to the CS ("3' tags") were collected for all polyadenylation events. Micro-variability of a few bases in the
position of the CS is frequently observed [Additional file
1, Figure 2A] consistent with [12]. All unique CS sites so
defined were used for the statistics in Fig. 1, 2, 3 and for
building the PAS and DSE models. A polyadenylation site
can be defined as a cluster (our 3P clusters) of closely
spaced CS, for which the cleavage is driven by the same
PAS. Therefore CS that differ only by a few nt (cf. Fig S2A)
are clustered for the evaluation of polyadenylation sites
(Fig 6) as in ref [12].

Figure 1A shows the distribution of the number of 3' tags
per gene. In both human and Drosophila, a large fraction
of genes are represented by a small number of tags, while
some human genes have up to 5000 tags. Due to large
quantity of data (590'008 tags), the distribution of
human 3' tags is likely to reflect biological variation in the
expression levels of the corresponding genes. For Drosophila, we were able to collect only 11'385 3' tags, because
most of the sequences produced by the BGDP project were
5' ESTs. Although the average coverage is about 1/20th of
that in human, the similarity in these distributions in
both species suggests that the Drosophila tags reflect similar expression variability. The clustered 3' tags documented a total of 53'469 polyadenylation regions in
human, and 2'659 in Drosophila. All datasets used in the
various sections are described and available at [27].
Motif search and HMM algorithms
We searched for motifs in the 100-bp polyadenylation
regions documented by clusters of 3' tags using the meme
software [17]. To incorporate all sequences for defining
the motifs, we applied preliminary meme runs to identify
the two strongest signals (AAUAAA for PAS, UUUGUUU
for human DSE, and UUUCUGU for fly DSE) which were
then used as seeds to exhaustively search all sequences in
groups of 250.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/176

In fly the DSE seed is related although not identical with
the hexamers founds in [25]. Hits in these runs were then
used to define the final matrices if they met positional criteria. For the PAS hits we retained all occurrences with first
nucleotide at positions between 20 and 38 (Figure 3). For
the second motif, we retained all occurrences between
nucleotide 51 and 73. The extension of the matrices was
defined
by
the
information
content
( IC = 2 + ∑ pL log 2 (pL ) ) at each position. Positions with
L

IC > 0.2 bits, which provided a clear separation from surrounding background, were retained.
HMMs were trained and decoded using the implementation written by A. Krogh (unpublished). Training is based
on the Baum-Welch expectation minimization procedure
and models were decoded using either the Forward or
posterior label probability (PLP) [18] algorithms. The PLP
of the first nucleotide in the PAS motif at each position in
the sequence is computed for polyadenylation site prediction. The full model architecture is shown in figure 4.
HMM parameter optimization
When assessing the specificity of the DSE matrices, the
only parameters that were optimized were the background emission probabilities (b1 = b2 = b3 for model 4A
and 4A and b1 = b3 for 4B) and transitions (p1 and p3 in
both models), while the weight matrices and Gaussian
spacer parameters were kept fixed. After optimization, the
model was decoded (Forward) on two sets of sequences:
one set of positives independent from the training set, and
a shuffled version thereof serving as negative controls. A
model consisting of a single zero order background state
was optimized on the training sequence and used as background score.

For prediction, the model was optimized using an iterative procedure rather than simultaneous optimization of
all parameters using Baum-Welch. First we noticed that
optimizing the background transitions p1 and p3 tended
to place the cleavage site too far downstream, leading to
inferior performance. Thus, p1 and p3 were scanned and
fixed at values of optimal prediction. In the final model,
these corresponded to an average length in the first background state of 500 in human. Spacer length [40] and SD
[11] were always fixed.
3'UTR sequences used for model assessment
Since our purpose was to predict 3' mRNA end formation
knowing the position of the stop codon, we restricted our
set to genes with unique stop codons having at least one
entry in RefSeq and one polyadenylation site. To avoid
ambuiguites in the evaluation of predictions, we further
restricted the sets to sequences having an unique mRNA

cleavage site, documented spread on less 40 bp. These sets
consisted of 7743 genes in humans and 1680 in Drosophila. The sets were randomly split in disjoint halves for
model training and testing.
