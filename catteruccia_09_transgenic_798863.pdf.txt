Abstract
The last few years have witnessed a considerable expansion in the number of tools available to
perform molecular and genetic studies on the genome of Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of
human malaria. As a consequence, knowledge of aspects of the biology of mosquitoes, such as
immunity, reproduction and behaviour, that are relevant to their ability to transmit disease is
rapidly increasing, and could be translated into concrete benefits for malaria control strategies.
Amongst the most important scientific advances, the development of transgenic technologies for
Anopheles mosquitoes provides a crucial opportunity to improve current vector control measures
or design novel ones. In particular, the use of genetic modification of the mosquito genome could
provide for a more effective deployment of the sterile insect technique (SIT) against vector
populations in the field. Currently, SIT relies on the release of radiation sterilized males, which
compete with wild males for mating with wild females. The induction of sterility in males through
the genetic manipulation of the mosquito genome, already achieved in a number of other insect
species, could eliminate the need for radiation and increase the efficiency of SIT-based strategies.
This paper provides an overview of the mechanisms already in use for inducing sterility by
transgenesis in Drosophila and other insects, and speculates on possible ways to apply similar
approaches to Anopheles mosquitoes.

Background
Vector-borne diseases cause a considerable burden for
human health in tropical and subtropical regions. Malaria
alone, transmitted exclusively by Anopheles mosquitoes
infected with Plasmodium protozoan parasites, causes the
death of more than a million people each year, most of
which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional strategies
aimed at tackling malaria have often focused on reducing
human-mosquito contact with bednets and the suppression of vector populations, principally through the use of
insecticides. However, the rapid appearance of insecticide
resistance in vector species is hampering the eradication of

this devastating disease, and efforts aimed at developing
novel and more effective malaria control strategies are
intensifying.
Amongst the novel approaches, the use of transgenesis,
until a few years ago just a remote idea [1,2], has recently
gained considerable attention. Techniques for the genetic
modification of a number of anopheline species that
transmit malaria (Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles gambiae
and Anopheles albimanus) have now been developed [3-5]
and provide the means to manipulate the ability of mosquitoes to serve as disease vectors. In the case of the major

vector of human malaria, An. gambiae, germline transformation, even if still technically challenging, is achieved at
reasonable frequencies and, despite the limited number of
publications on the subject, is carried out in a number of
laboratories [6-8]. The potential of a transgenic approach
for the control of this important vector species is tremendously strengthened by the availability of genetic and
genomic tools (such as RNA interference techniques,
microarray platforms, and the full genome sequence)
essential to perform functional studies on specific genes
and to analyse different aspects of mosquito biology at the
organismal level [9-12]. In recent years studies on the factors and mechanisms that shape vectorial capacity [13-16]
and the interactions between the vector and the parasite
[17-19] have intensified, and a clearer understanding of
the genetic bases of mosquito biology and behaviour is
starting to emerge. In this scenario of rapid technological
progress and crucial advancement in understanding of
both the vector and the parasite biological systems, transgenic technologies are being proposed to support, replace,
or complement traditional vector control methods.
One approach involves the introgression of factors interfering with parasite development into field populations of
vectors. Theoretically, natural disease vectors could be
replaced with genetically modified anopheline mosquitoes that are rendered refractory to the transmission of
malaria parasites. The merits of such a control strategy,
known as population replacement, are demonstrated by
the various levels of refractoriness to the transmission of
murine malaria, Plasmodium berghei, achieved in the laboratory by the expression of a series of effector genes [6,7].
Intense efforts are being focused on the search for factors
that can act on parasites relevant to human health, as well
as for effective technologies to drive such factors through
field populations. A second approach for the use of transgenic technologies is focused on improving the implementation of the sterile insect technique (SIT) [20,21] or
its transgenic derivative, the release of insects carrying a
dominant lethal genetic system (RIDL) [22-24]. As thoroughly discussed elsewhere in this supplement [25], SIT is
a species-specific, environmentally friendly strategy for
the control of major insect pests which relies on the
repeated release of sterilized insects (i.e. not capable of
producing viable progeny upon mating) over large areas
to achieve suppression or eradication of field populations.
The use of transgenic technologies can improve SIT for
anophelines by helping to solve three major issues:
reduced male competitiveness due to the sterilization procedure (irradiation or chemosterilisation) [26]; the need
for genetic sexing strains so as to release only males
[27,28]; and the need to monitor the survival and dispersal of the sterile males in the field. In this paper, an update
on the use of transgenic technologies to induce sterility
using embryonic or late stage lethality in Anopheles males

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/S2/S7

will be provided, and possible strategies for achieving this
using Drosophila melanogaster as the paradigm will be discussed. Other methods currently discussed for achieving
what is in effect conditional sterility in insect progeny
(such as the use of inherited dominant lethals [29]) are
not reviewed here.

The advantages of using transgenic sterility over
irradiation
Currently, reproductive sterility in insects to be used in SIT
programmes is induced following their exposure to
gamma radiation from a 60Co or 137Cs source. Chemosterilization has also been used in the past, especially for mosquitoes, however there is a laboratory report of non-target
sterility [30] causing concern for the environment and for
human health (but see [31,32] for more details). Radiation induces chromosomal damage in the germ cells,
leading to the desired sterility [32] but also causes deleterious somatic effects that reduce the competitiveness of
the males. Thus a balance has to be struck between the
radiation dose, the induced sterility, the competitiveness
of the male and the final level of reproductive sterility
induced in the wild females [33]. Quantifying the negative effects of radiation on sterile male competitiveness
has produced extremely divergent figures in the literature.
For example in the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, one study showed a 10-fold reduction in competitiveness [34] whilst another could demonstrate no
negative effect of radiation [35]. Radiation is also usually
carried out at the life stage which is most convenient logistically, i.e. the pupal stage, and not at the stage most optimal biologically, i.e. the adult stage. In An. gambiae, a
recent study has demonstrated that irradiating pupae,
although more practical, is associated with reduced mating competitiveness of the resulting adults [26] (however
see [36] for An. arabiensis). Adult irradiation would, therefore, be the best option, but it is associated with obvious
logistical difficulties.
By eliminating radiation, insect competitiveness would be
improved and the insects could be released at any stage of
development. The logistics involved with the radiation
procedure would disappear, there would be one less deleterious treatment for the released insects, and there would
be no need for an expensive and politically problematic
radiation source, although the recent development of new
X-ray machines should deal with this issue.
It may also be possible to combine transgenic sterility
induction with a genetic sexing mechanism to produce
populations of male-only sterile mosquitoes. Transgenic
sexing strains have been developed in An. stephensi, a
major vector for human malaria in Asia, which can
achieve reliable separation of male individuals at an early
developmental stage based on the expression of a fluores-

cent marker in sperm cells driven by a testis-specific β2tubulin promoter (Figure 1). Reliable sex separation has
also been achieved in these lines using non-destructive
automated larval sorters [37]. In principle, such spermspecific markers could be linked to the factor(s) inducing
sterility, thereby providing the possibility to meet three
highly desirable objectives: 1) the automated separation
of males from females at the larval stage, 2) the monitoring of mating of sterile males with wild females through
the identification of fluorescent spermatozoa in the spermatheca, the female sperm storage organ, and 3) the prevention of the production of viable progeny. The
development and testing of constructs combining genetic
sexing (see [38] for genetic sexing mechanisms) and sterility is a research priority for future studies aimed at
improving sterility strategies.

How could sterility be induced in Anopheles?
In order for SIT programmes to be successful, males must
be effective at preventing the females they mate with from
reproducing. This relies on males being able to transfer 1)
sterile sperm to ensure death of developing zygotes and 2)
accessory gland secretions to induce the appropriate
behavioural responses in the female. These behavioural
responses include prevention of remating. Anopheles gambiae females mate only once in their lifetime and after a
successful copulation a life-long refractoriness to further
mating is induced. In many insects, it has been unambig-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/S2/S7

uously established that reduction or complete suppression of mating responsiveness is due to the transfer of
factors (mainly proteins and peptides) from the male
accessory glands during copulation, with sperm also playing an important role [39-42]. Although the triggers of
this post-mating response have not been identified with
certainty in Anopheles [43-46], it is likely that analogous
mechanisms are in place. Indeed, recently a large number
of genes and proteins with homology to important Drosophila male accessory gland proteins have been identified
in An. gambiae [47] (see Figure 1 for an image of the male
reproductive tract including testes and male accessory
glands dissected from an An. gambiae male). Control strategies based on the use of transgenesis to induce sterility
must take into consideration the effects it will have on the
ability of the males to induce normal post-copulatory
responses in females. In order to gain crucial insights on
how field populations will respond to any intervention, it
will be essential to intensify research efforts to understand
the genetic and physiological bases of reproduction in
Anopheles mosquitoes.
In the next four sections, the mechanisms used in Drosophila and other higher dipterans to induce reproductive
sterility will be discussed as will potential approaches on
how such mechanisms could be transferred and adapted
to Anopheles mosquitoes.

Reproductive sterility based on lethality of the
progeny
An elegant strategy to develop sterile males is based on the
expression of a dominant conditional lethal factor. However, it will be very important that the lethal system is
inactive during spermatogenesis and in adult males and
that the expression of the construct can be repressed under
permissive rearing conditions in the facility. After release,
non-permissive conditions will not affect spermatogenesis or the adult males themselves but will result in death
of their progeny. If a male is homozygous for such a gene
construct, each fertilization event will lead to lethality in
the progeny.

develop, are indicated. The image is an overlay of a fluorescent and a transmission microphotograph. The fluorescence
in the testes is derived from the expression of a green fluorescent protein egfp reporter gene driven by the testis-specific β2-tubulin promoter [37]. The scale bar is indicated.

Lethality could be induced by a number of cytotoxic gene
products driven by suitable promoters. The use of
polypeptide toxins, such as the diphtheria or ricin, is
probably not suitable as mosquitoes expressing these proteins may not be perceived favorably by regulatory agencies. However, dominant negative protein variants that
cause cytotoxicity, such as the constitutively activated cell
signaling molecule Ras64B, have been shown to cause
organismal lethality in Drosophila [23] and might provoke
less concern. The products of proapoptotic genes that
induce apoptosis of the cells in which they are expressed
represent another possible choice. In Drosophila, three
proapoptotic genes reaper (rpr), grim, and head involution

defective (hid) have been identified [48,49]. After conditional activation of these genes, ectopic apoptosis is
induced which causes organismal lethality. Phylogenetically conserved activity has been shown for all three genes,
as apoptosis can be induced by rpr in a lepidopteran cell
line [50] and the frog Xenopus laevis [51], as well as by grim
and hid in mammalian cell lines [52,53]. Thus, systems
based on these Drosophila proapoptotic effector genes
should be transferable to other species including disease
vectors. To enhance the strength of the lethality effect, a
constitutive active form of hid that cannot be down-regulated by cell signaling pathways can also be used [54].
Since a lethal strain would be impossible to maintain, the
expression of lethality needs to be conditional. This can
be achieved by using a two-component system, which will
be repressed during rearing due to an additive in the diet
but which, in the absence of the additives in the field, will
be expressed. One component of the system will be a
"driver" construct that will express a conditional mediator
under the control of a suitable promoter. The second component will be an "effector" construct that reacts to the
mediator, depending on the presence or absence of the
additive, and will lead to the expression of cytotoxic
genes. Before release, the strains will be switched to additive-free food and the two-component system will turn on
and cause the dominant sterility in the released males
based on lethality of their progeny. For this purpose, the
tetracycline-controllable transactivator (tTA) system [55]
can be used. The hybrid transactivator tTA represents a
fusion between the bacterial Tet-repressor and the Herpes
simplex VP16 activation domain. In the presence of tetracycline the tTA cannot bind DNA and the system is
switched "off". However, once the tetracycline is removed
from the diet or when the strain is released, tTA will bind
to the DNA at Tet responsible elements (TRE) and activate
transcription of effector constructs under the control of
TRE sites. The tTA/TRE system is extremely tight: even the
expression of potent toxin genes is sufficiently repressed
when tetracycline is provided. This system has already
been shown to be able to control gene expression in An.
stephensi [56].

Embryonic lethality: the proof of principle in D.
melanogaster
One way to achieve control of a lethal system to avoid
affecting spermatogenesis and adult males would be to
use a promoter that is active at early blastoderm stages
only. Such a transgene-based embryo-specific lethality
system was successfully tested in Drosophila and generated
reproductively sterile males [57]. The system was based on
the ectopic expression of the hyperactive phospho-acceptor-site mutant allele hidAla5 [54], which caused lethality
when driven by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator
tTA. To ensure early embryonic expression, tTA was regu-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/S2/S7

lated by an enhancer/promoter from the cellularization
genes nullo or serendipity α (sry α) [57]. In order to restrict
the detrimental effects of a dominant lethality system to
the embryo, cis-regulatory elements that are active during
the earliest possible stages of embryogenesis and whose
activity is entirely confined to these stages are of utmost
importance. The D. melanogaster cellularization genes sry
α and nullo encode structural components of the microfilament network that are required for blastoderm cellularization and are expressed specifically during the insecttypical superficial cleavage stages. Thus their strong and
ubiquitous but stage-specific expression seemed ideal to
drive an embryo-specific lethality system. This transgenic
approach caused reproductive sterility that neither interfered with the adult phase of the insect life cycle nor with
spermatogenesis and generated competitive males that
can transfer sperm [57].

Embryonic lethality: transfer to other insects
Because HID and tTA function not only in Drosophila but
also in mammalian systems and mosquitoes, the question
of transferability of the Drosophila proof-of-principle [57]
was mostly concerned with the functional conservation of
the cis-regulatory control elements of the cellularization
genes. A direct transfer of the Drosophila construct using
the sry α promoter to drive tTA expression to the Mediterranean fruit fly yielded transgenic flies that did not show
any expression of tTA [58]. This indicates that the cellularization specific sry α promoter from Drosophila is not functional in the Mediterranean fruit fly despite the relative
close phylogenetic relationship of these cyclorrhaphan
flies. Thus in order to get functional promoters, endogenous promoters of Mediterranean fruit fly had to be isolated. A first approach to obtain homologues of the genes
nullo and sry α using degenerate primers was unsuccessful
as these cellularization genes are evolving too rapidly [59]
and a cDNA subtraction approach was used. The time
window of cellularization in Mediterranean fruit fly was
first determined and genes were isolated that were specifically expressed during the superficial cleavage stages [59].
The promoter/enhancer regions of these genes were then
isolated by inverse PCR. These promoter/enhancer elements of cellularization-specifically expressed genes were
subsequently used to generate a reproductive sterility system for this species based on transgenic embryonic
lethality [59]. These elements act differently in expression
strength and in their ability to drive lethal effector gene
activation and they are strongly influenced by position
effects. However, out of several combinations of driver
and effector construct integrations, several resulted in larval and pupal lethality and one combination (LL#67)
showing complete embryonic lethality. Since the transgenic strain LL#67, appeared to be competitive with wildtype flies in laboratory and field cage tests, it might ultimately be possible to use it, or a similar strain, to improve

the efficacy of operational Mediterranean fruit fly SIT programmes. This successful transfer of the Drosophila proofof principle embryonic lethality system represents a
straightforward approach that should also be applicable
to anopheline malaria vectors.
Ideally, such an embryonic lethality system should be
combined with a genetic sexing system causing conditional female lethality so that vigorous, reproductively
sterile male mosquitoes could be produced for the use in
SIT programmes. In anopheline mosquitoes only one
transgenic sexing systems has so far been produced [37],
and alternative approaches could be modelled after systems that use either female specific promoters as shown in
Drosophila [23,60], which however might act too late for
effective mass production, or female specifically spliced
introns as shown for Mediterranean fruit fly [61].

Postembryonic lethality
Inducing lethality at later stages could be advantageous
for mosquitoes as transgenic larvae would compete with
wild larvae for resources under density dependent conditions in the field [62]. To achieve this, a simplified onecomponent system based on the toxicity of the tTA transactivator itself when expressed at high levels has been
developed and tested in the Mediterranean fruit fly [63].
In this system, expression of the tTA transactivator is
directly controlled by the TRE: in the presence of tetracycline, tTA is inactivated and, therefore, expressed at basal
levels, while when tetracycline is removed from the diet,
the basal expression of tTA induces an autoregulatory
loop that causes the synthesis of more tTA, which accumulates to high levels inducing lethality. When heterozygous
males were crossed to wild type females, half the progeny
reared in a non-tetracycline diet generally died, as
expected. This system induced lethality in Mediterranean
fruit fly at later developmental (larval and pupal) stages
with a number of adult escapers recovered.
The same tetracycline-repressible dominant lethal system
was also used in the yellow fever and dengue vector Aedes
aegypti to induce killing of both male and female mosquitoes [62]. A number of transgenic lines were developed
and reared in the presence and absence of tetracycline in
their diet. The lethality trait was highly penetrant, however as seen in the case of Mediterranean fruit fly, a small
proportion of transgenics survived to adulthood in the
absence of the drug. It is reasonable to envisage that it will
be possible to optimize this system by adding an additional lethal factor to achieve complete penetrance of the
lethality trait. This will be necessary to avoid an unwanted
ingression of adult transgenic individuals into wild mosquito populations that would interfere with monitoring
of the SIT programme and could become the basis for
resistance development.

Anopheles mosquitoes: current perspectives for
inducing male sterility
The examples provided in the previous sections show how
reproductive sterility based on embryonic or postembryonic lethality can be induced by transgenic means in
insects other than D. melanogaster. As mentioned above,
the use of the tTA transactivator system for conditional
gene expression has already been demonstrated in An.
stephensi [56], and there is no reason to doubt that the
one-component system will also be capable of inducing
lethality in An. gambiae. However, other avenues for
inducing male sterility or embryonic lethality are worth
pursuing.
Recently, a reaper/grim-like proapoptotic gene has been
identified in the An. gambiae genome. This gene, named
michelob_x (mx), despite not coding for a Grim helix 3
(GH3) domain, was capable of inducing cell death in D.
melanogaster S2 and Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell lines
within 20 h of transfection [64]. The apoptotic activity
was shown to be dependent on the N-terminal IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein)-binding motif of the molecule,
whose removal completely abolished killing. In the same
study, mx also induced embryonic lethality in vivo in the
progeny of the crosses of transgenic D. melanogaster
expressing a UAS-mx fusion in a specific set of cells of the
central nervous system and the ventral epidermis driven
by a P52Gal4 insertion [65]. Although it is possible that
such lethality was due to a 'leakiness' of the P52Gal4 insertion, as a parallel anti-β-galactosidase staining showed
that many epithelial cells were also killed by mx expression, these experiments demonstrate the ability of mx
from An. gambiae to function as a potent proapoptotic
gene in an unrelated species.
A novel mechanism has recently been proposed to create
sex ratio distortions and embryonic lethality in natural
populations based on the use of a homing endonuclease
enzyme [8]. Sex ratio distortions have been described in
Ae. aegypti and Culex pipiens mosquitoes in which Y chromosomes are naturally driven in field populations probably through the induction of breaks on the X chromosome
during male meiosis [66]. Recently there has been
renewed interest in using this system for population
replacement in Ae. aegypti [67,68]. A similar system could
be artificially created in An. gambiae using the property of
the I-PpoI homing endonuclease: this enzyme has been
recently shown to be able to cleave chromosomal rDNA
repeats in the An. gambiae Sua 4.0 cell line, leading to cell
proliferation arrest and possibly to cell death [8]. As in An.
gambiae and other anopheline species the rDNA region is
only present in the centromeric region of the X chromosome, expressing I-PpoI in the sperm cells during male
meiosis could potentially produce incapacitated X-carrying spermatozoa. Recently, transgenic An. gambiae lines

Page 5 of 8

were developed which express I-PpoI under the control of
the β2-tubulin promoter. Expression of I-PpoI in the testes
induced a strong bias toward Y chromosome-carrying
spermatozoa, and also induced complete early dominant
embryo lethality in crosses with wild-type females.
Embryos originating from transgenic males were arrested
very early in their development, probably at a point before
the fusion of the male and the female pronuclei [69].
In parallel to the quest for potent effector genes and mechanisms capable of inducing sterility, there is the need to
identify suitable promoters to drive their expression. This
is a considerable limitation of the system in Anopheles, as
besides the β2-tubulin regulatory regions described above
[37] (Figure 1), which are selectively transcribed at the
mature primary spermatocyte stage just before meiotic
division starts, no other male or female germline-specific
promoter has been successfully characterized and used in
transgenic individuals. Possibly, early cellularization promoters similar to those utilized in Drosophila and in Mediterranean fruit fly could be identified as outlined above
and used to transcribe toxic genes during embryogenesis,
thereby mediating reproductive sterility. It is reasonable
to speculate that in the near future it will be possible not
only to adapt existing strategies but also to develop novel,
possibly species-specific ones, to create populations of
transgenic Anopheles males that can be used in release programmes.

Conclusion
The development and adaptation of transgenic technologies to anopheline vectors of human malaria represents an
important tool available to the mosquito research community. Beyond its importance for performing functional
studies, genetic manipulation of the mosquito germline
can be exploited to support and complement vector control strategies such as those based on conventional SIT.
The induction of sterility by transgenic means could
undoubtedly provide important advantages to SIT programmes by eliminating the need for radiation. The examples available from other insects encourage optimism: a
number of mechanisms are available to be tested in
anopheline vectors for their efficacy and safety. Additional
strategies such as those proposed here could be attempted
that may have the advantage of a species-specific application. The possibility of combining sterility with a sexing
mechanism will render genetic manipulation of the vector
a crucial tool for a successful deployment of SIT strategies
targeting anopheline populations in the field.
