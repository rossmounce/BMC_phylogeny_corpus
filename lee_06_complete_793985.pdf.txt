Abstract
Background: Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the most important fiber crop grown in 90 countries. In
2004–2005, US farmers planted 79% of the 5.7-million hectares of nuclear transgenic cotton.
Unfortunately, genetically modified cotton has the potential to hybridize with other cultivated and wild
relatives, resulting in geographical restrictions to cultivation. However, chloroplast genetic engineering
offers the possibility of containment because of maternal inheritance of transgenes. The complete
chloroplast genome of cotton provides essential information required for genetic engineering. In addition,
the sequence data were used to assess phylogenetic relationships among the major clades of rosids using
cotton and 25 other completely sequenced angiosperm chloroplast genomes.
Results: The complete cotton chloroplast genome is 160,301 bp in length, with 112 unique genes and 19
duplicated genes within the IR, containing a total of 131 genes. There are four ribosomal RNAs, 30 distinct
tRNA genes and 17 intron-containing genes. The gene order in cotton is identical to that of tobacco but
lacks rpl22 and infA. There are 30 direct and 24 inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity
≥ 90%. Most of the direct repeats are within intergenic spacer regions, introns and a 72 bp-long direct
repeat is within the psaA and psaB genes. Comparison of protein coding sequences with expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) revealed nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes in ndhC, rpl23, rpl20,
rps3 and clpP. Phylogenetic analysis of a data set including 61 protein-coding genes using both maximum
likelihood and maximum parsimony were performed for 28 taxa, including cotton and five other
angiosperm chloroplast genomes that were not included in any previous phylogenies.
Conclusion: Cotton chloroplast genome lacks rpl22 and infA and contains a number of dispersed direct
and inverted repeats. RNA editing resulted in amino acid changes with significant impact on their
hydropathy. Phylogenetic analysis provides strong support for the position of cotton in the Malvales in the
eurosids II clade sister to Arabidopsis in the Brassicales. Furthermore, there is strong support for the
placement of the Myrtales sister to the eurosid I clade, although expanded taxon sampling is needed to
further test this relationship.

Background
The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis, where light
energy in photons is converted into chemical bond
energy, via redox reactions, including inorganic carbon
fixation at Calvin's cycle, finally yielding energy-rich carbohydrate molecules. Therefore, apart from the antennae,
photosystem I and II complexes, which are found in the
thylakoid membrane, the chloroplast contains the entire
enzymatic machinery for carbohydrate biosynthesis in the
stroma. Anabolic pathways such as protein, fatty acid,
vitamin, and pigment biosynthesis take place in the chloroplast as well, indicating the organelle's ability to synthesize complex molecules. The chloroplast genome
maintains a highly conserved organization [1,2] with
most land plant genomes composed of a single circular
chromosome with a quadripartite structure that includes
two copies of an inverted repeat (IR) that separate the
large and small single copy regions (LSC and SSC) [3]. The
recent surge of interest in sequencing chloroplast
genomes has provided a plethora of information on the
organization and evolution of these genomes and new
data for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships [2].
Chloroplast genetic engineering offers numerous advantages, including a high-level of transgene expression [4],
multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event
[4-7], transgene containment via maternal inheritance [811] or cytoplasmic male sterility [12], lack of gene silencing [4,13], position effect due to site specific transgene
integration [14], and pleiotropic effects due to sub-cellular compartmentalization of transgene products
[13,15,16]. Apart from expressing therapeutic agents,
biopolymers, or transgenes to confer agronomic traits,
plastid genetic engineering has been used to study plastid
biogenesis and function, revealing mechanisms of plastid
DNA replication origins, intron maturases, translation
elements and proteolysis, import of proteins and several
other processes [18]. Despite the potential of chloroplast
genetic engineering, this technology has only recently
been extended to the major crops, including soybean [19],
carrot [20] and cotton [21], via somatic embryogenesis,
achieving transgene expression in non-green plastids [22].
All other previous studies focused on direct organogenesis
by bombardment of leaves containing mature green chloroplasts [22]. Lack of complete chloroplast genome
sequences to provide 100% homologous species-specific
chloroplast transformation vectors, containing suitable
selectable markers and endogenous regulatory elements,
is one of the major limitations to extend this concept to
other useful crops [22,23].
The need for sequencing the cotton plastome is obvious,
when considering its annual retail value of about $120
billion, making it America's most value-added crop. This
is justified by the fact that cotton is the single most impor-

tant textile fiber grown in 90 countries; the US accounts
for 21% of the total world fiber production. In 2004–
2005, US farmers planted 79% of the 5.7-million hectares
of nuclear transgenic cotton. Upland cotton, Gossypium
hirsutum, has the potential to hybridize with G. tomentosum, feral populations of G. hirsutum, and G. hirsutum/G.
barbadense [21]. Therefore, geographical restrictions in
planting genetically modified cotton are in place because
of reports of pollen dispersal from transgenic cotton
plants [25]. Chloroplast genetic engineering could minimize transgene escape because of maternal inheritance of
transgenes [8-11]. In addition, other failsafe mechanisms,
including cytoplasmic male sterility could be employed to
contain transgenes [12].
The examination of phylogenetic relationships among
angiosperms has received considerable attention during
the past decade [reviewed in [26]]. Although there is considerable consensus about the circumscription and relationships among many of the major clades, most
molecular phylogenetic analyses have examined numerous taxa but have relied on only a few gene sequences.
Completely sequenced chloroplast genomes provide a
rich source of nucleotide sequence data that can be used
to address phylogenetic questions. Several recent studies
have attempted to use completely sequenced genomes to
resolve the identification of the basal lineages of flowering
plants [27-29]. Use of many or all of the genes from the
chloroplast genome provides many more characters for
phylogeny reconstruction in comparison with previous
studies that have relied on only a few genes. However, the
limited number of available whole chloroplast genome
sequences can result in misleading estimates of relationship [27,30]. This problem can be overcome as more complete chloroplast genome sequences become available.
In this article, we present the complete sequence of the
chloroplast genome of upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum.
One goal of this paper is to examine gene content and
gene order, and determine the distribution and location
of repeated sequences. Secondly, the RNA editing sites in
the cotton chloroplast genome are identified and examined, by comparing the DNA sequences with available
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences, because RNA
editing plays a major role in several lineages of plants
[31,32]. Lastly, protein-coding sequences from 61 genes
are used to estimate phylogenetic relationships of cotton
with 25 other angiosperms.

Gene map
Gene map of the Gossypium hirsutum chloroplast genome. The thick lines indicate the extent of the inverted repeats (IRa and
IRb), which separate the genome into small (SSC) and large (LSC) single copy regions. Genes on the outside of the map are
transcribed in the clockwise direction and genes on the inside of the map are transcribed in the counterclockwise direction.
Numbered lines around the map indicate the location of repeated sequences found in the cotton genome (see Table 1 for
details). The SSC region is in the reverse orientation relative to tobacco [80]. This does not reflect any differences in gene
order for cotton but simply reflects the well-known phenomenon that the SSC exists in two orientations in chloroplast
genomes [84].

copy region of 20,269 bp and 88,816 bp, respectively.
There are 112 unique genes within the cotton chloroplast
genome and 19 of these are duplicated in the IR, giving a
total of 131 genes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there are four
ribosomal and 30 distinct tRNA genes; seven of the tRNA
genes and all rRNA genes are duplicated within the IR.
There are 17 intron-containing genes, 15 of which contain
one intron, whereas the remaining two have two introns.
The gene order in the cotton plastid genome is identical to
that of tobacco, but cotton lacks the rpl22 and infA genes.
Overall, genomic content is 37.25% GC and 62.75% AT,
where 56.46% of the genome corresponds to protein coding genes and 43.54% to non-coding regions, including
introns and intergenic spacers.

revealed that rps16, rpl2, rpoC2, rps4 and ycf1 have 100%
sequence identity with their respective ESTs (data not
shown). Eleven non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, resulting in a total of nine amino acid changes, were
identified within ndhC, rpl23, rpl20, rps3 and clpP compared to respective ESTs, although their sequence identity
was above 98% (Table 2). Surprisingly, there were no synonymous substitutions. All of the five aforementioned
genes experienced one or two nucleotide substitutions,
apart from the protease-encoding clpP, which had five variable sites. Lastly, in all but rpl23, the nucleotide substitutions had an impact on the hydropathy of the amino acid
because they changed the amino acids from aliphatic to
hydrophilic, and vice versa.

Repeat structure
Repeat analysis identified 30 direct and 24 inverted
repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least
90% (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Twenty-three direct and 15
inverted repeats are 30 to 40 bp long, and the longest
direct repeat is 72 bp. Most of the direct repeats are within
intergenic spacer regions, intron sequences and ycf2, an
essential hypothetical chloroplast gene [33]. Interestingly,
a 72 bp-long direct repeat was found in the psaA and psaB
genes, whereas a 34-bp forward repeat was within the
rrn23 gene, and a shorter, 32 bp-long direct repeat was
identified in two serine transfer-RNA(trnS) genes that recognize different codons; trnS-GCU and trnS-UGA.

Phylogenetic analysis
The data matrix for phylogenetic analyses included 61
protein-coding genes for 28 taxa (Table 3), including 26
angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups (Pinus and
Ginkgo). The data set comprised 45,573 nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there were 39,624
characters. Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses resulted
in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of 49,957, a
consistency index of 0.46 (excluding uninformative characters) and a retention index of 0.62 (Fig. 3). Bootstrap
analyses indicated that 24 of the 26 nodes were supported
by values ≥ 95% with 19 of these with bootstrap values of
100%. Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis resulted in a
tree with a –lnL = 311251.33. The ML and MP trees had
identical topologies so only the MP tree is shown in Figure
3.

RNA editing
Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of protein coding genes and EST sequences retrieved from GenBank

Several major groups were supported within angiosperms
and these groups are generally in agreement with recent
classifications [26]. The most basal lineage was Amborella
followed by the Nymphaeales. The next branch included
Calycanthus, the sole representative of magnoliids in the
data set. This was followed by a strongly supported clade
of monocots, represented by members of three different
orders (Acorales, Asparagales, and Poales). The monocots
were then sister to the eudicots with the Ranunculales
forming the earliest diverging eudicot clade. Within the
core eudicots there were two major clades, one including
the rosids and the second including the Caryophyllales
sister to asterids. Within the rosid clade there were two
major groups, the eurosids II and a group that included
the Myrtales sister to the eurosids I. Gossypium in the Malvales was sister to Arabidopsis in the Brassicales.

and potato chloroplast genomes using tobacco flanking
sequences that do not have 100% sequence identity
[24,34,35], the cotton plastid transformation vector was
constructed using the PCR-amplified native cotton 16S/
trnI-trnA/23S sequence. However, regulatory sequences
used in the cotton plastid transformation were derived
from tobacco or other heterologous sequences. With the
availability of the entire cotton chloroplast genome
sequence, it should now be possible to utilize endogenous
regulatory sequences. Species-specific vectors should be
effective for plastid transformation, especially in recalcitrant plants, because of transgene integration using flank-

ing sequences with 100% sequence identity and
endogenous promoters, 5' & 3'untranslated regions,
thereby enhancing transcription and translation of transgenes. Also, the complete chloroplast genome provides
the option of transgene integration into transcriptionally
silent, active or read-through spacer regions for optimal
transgene
integration.
Thus far, transgenes conferring several useful agronomic
traits, including insect [4,36,37], herbicide [8,38], and
disease resistance [39], drought [13] and salt tolerance

biomaterials [6,47,48] have been produced successfully in
an environmental friendly way. Although many successful
examples of plastid engineering in tobacco have set a solid
foundation for various future applications, this technology has not been extended to many of the major crops,
primarily due to the lack of complete chloroplast genome
sequences and challenges in achieving homoplasmy in
recalcitrant crops.
Evolutionary implications
Other than the IR, repeated sequences are generally considered to be uncommon in chloroplast genomes [1]. Furthermore, previous studies based on both filter
hybridization and DNA sequencing have indicated that
dispersed repeats are found more commonly in genomes
that have experienced changes in genome organization
[49,56], especially in highly rearranged algal genomes
[51,52]. The most extensive examination of repeat structure in angiosperms was performed in legumes [3], which
do have a single inversion and in some taxa a loss of one
copy of the IR. These repeat analyses identified a substantial number highly conserved repeats ≥ 30 bp with a
sequence identity of ≥ 90%. Many of these repeats were
located in intergenic spacer regions and introns, with several located in the coding regions of psaA, psaB, and ycf2.
Our examination of repeats in the cotton chloroplast
genome (Table 1, Fig. 2) identified similar numbers of
repeats as in legumes [3], and these are also located
mostly in intergenic spacer regions and introns. Repeats in
coding regions of cotton are located in the same genes as
in legumes. Overall, it appears that dispersed repeats are
very common in angiosperm chloroplast genomes, even
in genomes that have not experienced rearrangements.
Future comparative studies are needed to determine the
functional and evolutionary role these repeats may play in
chloroplast genomes.

DNA and EST sequence comparisons identified many
nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes.
Based on previous studies of Atropa [53] and tobacco [54],
posttranscriptional RNA editing events result predominantly in C-to-U edits. However, analysis of the cotton
genome and EST sequences indicates that only two of the
eleven differences were C-to-U changes, suggesting that
most of these changes are not mRNA edits but may simply
represent intra-species polymorphisms. Evolutionary loss
of RNA editing sites has been previously observed and
could possibly be due to a decrease in the effect of RNAediting enzymes [31]. Additionally, conversions other
than C-to-U in cotton, as well as other crops, suggest that
chloroplast genomes may be accumulating considerable
amounts of nucleotide substitutions, where some genes
might accrue more alterations than others, such as the petL
and ndh genes that have a high frequency of RNA editing
[55]. Therefore, despite the plastome's high conservation,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/61

variations occur post-transcriptionally, promoting translational efficiency due to transcript-protein complex binding and/or changes in the chloroplast microenvironment,
like redox potential or light intensity [56,57].
The phylogeny based on 61 protein-coding genes for 28
angiosperms is congruent with relationships suggested in
previous studies [summarized in [26]]. There is strong
support for the monophyly all of the major clades of
angiosperms, including monocots, eudicots, rosids,
asterids, eurosids I, eurosids II, asterids I and asterid II.
Our phylogenetic analyses have greatly expanded the
taxon sampling of entire genomes because we included six
genomes (in bold in Table 1 and Fig. 3) that have not been
included in recently published phylogenies based on
complete chloroplast genomes [27-29,58]. The sampling
is particularly expanded in the rosids with four of the six
genomes from this clade. Thus, we will focus our discussion of the phylogenetic implications of this expanded
analysis on this group.
The rosid clade is very large and includes nearly 140 families representing almost one third of all angiosperms. The
most recent phylogenies of this group [summarized in
chapter 8 in [26]] indicate that there are seven major
clades whose relationships still remain unresolved. Representatives of three of these major clades are included in
our analyses, eurosids I, eurosids II, and Myrtales. The
position of the Myrtales has been especially controversial
with no clear resolution of the relationship of this order to
other members of the rosids. Our 61 gene chloroplast
phylogeny (Fig. 3) provides strong support for a sister
relationship of the Myrtales with the eurosid I clade. A
three-gene phylogeny of 560 angiosperms is congruent
with our results [59], although support was very weak.
However, a sister relationship between eurosids I and
Myrtales is in conflict with two other recent phylogenies
based on two chloroplast genes (atpB, rbcL), which placed
the Myrtales sister to the eurosid II clade with weak support [60,61]. Although our results clearly favor a closer
relationship of Myrtales to the eurosid I clade, expanded
sampling of complete chloroplast genome sequences of
rosids is needed to resolve this issue, especially since limited taxon sampling can lead to erroneous tree topologies
[27,30].
Our chloroplast phylogeny (Fig. 3) also supports the sister
relationship between the orders Cucurbitales and Fabales,
two of the four nitrogen fixing clades of eurosids I. Furthermore, the position of cotton, a member of the order
Malvales, as sister to Arabidopsis in the Brassicales, is in
agreement with recently phylogenies of the eurosid II
clade [26].

Conclusion
Our complete sequence of the cotton chloroplast genome
provides the needed information for expanding chloroplast genetic engineering to this important crop plant.
Although genome organization of cotton is very similar to
other unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes,
identification of disperse repeats and potential RNA editing sites provides new insights into the evolution of this
genome. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of sequences of 61
protein-coding genes for 26 angiosperms suggests that the
order Myrtales is sister to the eurosid I clade but denser
sampling is needed to test this result rigorously.

the translated amino acid sequence, using the plastid/bacterial genetic code.
Examination of repeat structure
REPuter [67] was used to locate and count the direct (forward) and inverted (palindromic) repeats within the cotton chloroplast genome. For repeat identification, the
following constraints were used: (i) minimum repeat size
of 30 bp, and (ii) 90% or greater sequence identity, based
on Hamming distance equal to 3 bp [3]. Manual verification of the identified repeats was performed in EditSeq,
while performing intragenomic blast search of the identified repeat sequence.

Methods
DNA isolation and amplification
Gossypium hirsutum plants cv. Coker310FR were grown
from seedlings in soil pots, until they were 1 m tall. Prior
to DNA extraction, the plants were placed in the dark for
two days to reduce the chloroplast starch levels. After that,
10 g of young leaf tissue was collected for cpDNA isolation based on the sucrose step gradient centrifugation
method by Sandbrink et al [62]. Isolation was followed by
whole chloroplast genome Rolling Circle Amplification
(RCA), using the Repli-g RCA kit (Qiagen, Inc.) following
the methods outlined in [63]. After incubation at 30°C
for 16 hr, the reaction was terminated with 10-minute
incubation at 65°C. Digestion of the RCA product with
BstXI, EcoRI and HindIII allowed verification of successful
RCA plastome amplification, as well as assessment of its
quality, prior to DNA sequencing.

Variation between coding sequences and cDNAs
Each of the gene sequences from the cotton chloroplast
genome was used to perform a BLAST search of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from GenBank. The retrieved Gossypium hirsutum ESTs were aligned with the corresponding
annotated gene using ClustalX [68], followed by screening
for nucleotide and amino acid changes using Megalign
and its' plastid/bacterial genetic code. Because of variation
in the length between an EST and the related gene, the
length of the analyzed sequence was recorded.

DNA sequencing and genome assembly
DNA was sheared by nebulization, size fractionated to 4–
6 kb, linker ligated and cloned into pHOS2, a TIGR
medium copy vector. A total of 1619 good reads with an
average length of 812 bases was generated during the random (1396 reads) and closure (223 reads) phases of
sequencing. Sequences were assembled using TIGR assembler [64] and scaffolded using Bambus [65]. Sequence finishing included directed PCR to span gaps, directed
primer walking on clones and transposon mediated
sequencing of full clones to cover the entire genome and
complete regions of low coverage and manual editing of
sequences to resolve inconsistencies.

Phylogenetic analysis
The 61 genes included in the analyses of Goremykin et al.
[28,29] and Leebens-Mack et al. [27] were extracted from
our new chloroplast genome sequences of cotton using
the organellar genome annotation program DOGMA.
[66]. The same set of 61 genes was extracted from chloroplast genome sequences of five other recently sequenced
angiosperm chloroplast genomes, including tomato,
potato, soybean, cucumber, and Eucalyptus (see Table 3
for complete list of genomes examined). In general, alignment of the DNA sequences was straightforward and simply involved removing gaps included in the data set
because of the elimination of non-seed plants and adding
the 61 genes for the new angiosperms to the aligned data
matrix from Leebens-Mack et al. [27]. In some cases, small
in frame insertions or deletions were required for correct
alignment. For two genes, ccsA and matK, the DNA
sequences were more divergent, requiring alignment
using ClustalX [68] followed by manual adjustments.

Gene annotation
The cotton genome was annotated using DOGMA [Dual
Organellar GenoMe Annotator, [66]], after uploading a
FASTA-formatted file of the complete plastid genome to
the program's server. BLASTX and BLASTN searches,
against a custom database of previously published plastid
genomes, identified cotton's putative protein-coding
genes, and tRNAs or rRNAs. For genes with low sequence
identity, manual annotation was performed, after identifying the position of the start and stop codons, as well as

Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP)
and maximum likelihood (ML) were performed using
PAUP* version 4.10 [69]. All phylogenetic analyses
excluded gap regions. All MP searches were heuristic with
100 random addition replicates and TBR branch swapping with the Multrees option. The Hasegawa-KishinoYano (HKY; [70]) model of molecular evolution was used
in ML analyses of the nucleotide sequences. ML analyses
used TBR branch swapping with the Multrees option and
one random addition replicate. Non-parametric bootstrap

analyses [71] were performed for MP analyses with 1000
replicates with TBR branch swapping, one random addition replicate, and the Multrees option and for ML analyses with 100 replicates with NNI branch swapping, one
random addition replicate, and the Multrees option.
