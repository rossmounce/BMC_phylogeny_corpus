Abstract
Background: Vertebrate SWS1 visual pigments mediate visual transduction in response to light
at short wavelengths. Due to their importance in vision, SWS1 genes have been isolated from a
surprisingly wide range of vertebrates, including lampreys, teleosts, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals. The SWS1 genes exhibit many of the characteristics of genes typically targeted for
phylogenetic analyses. This study investigates both the utility of SWS1 as a marker for inferring
vertebrate phylogenetic relationships, and the characteristics of the gene that contribute to its
phylogenetic utility.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate SWS1 genes produced topologies that were
remarkably congruent with generally accepted hypotheses of vertebrate evolution at both higher
and lower taxonomic levels. The few exceptions were generally associated with areas of poor
taxonomic sampling, or relationships that have been difficult to resolve using other molecular
markers. The SWS1 data set was characterized by a substantial amount of among-site rate
variation, and a relatively unskewed substitution rate matrix, even when the data were partitioned
into different codon sites and individual taxonomic groups. Although there were nucleotide biases
in some groups at third positions, these biases were not convergent across different taxonomic
groups.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that SWS1 may be a good marker for vertebrate phylogenetics
due to the variable yet consistent patterns of sequence evolution exhibited across fairly wide
taxonomic groups. This may result from constraints imposed by the functional role of SWS1
pigments in visual transduction.

Background
Opsins, or visual pigments, form the first step in the visual
transduction cascade in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. By means of a covalently-bound retinal chromo-

phore, opsins are able to respond to light by changing
conformation, which activates a second messenger G-protein, and triggers a biochemical cascade that eventually
results in a neural signal to the brain that light has been

perceived [1]. Opsins are a member of the extremely large
superfamily of integral membrane G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCR's), with thousands of genes present in
the human genome alone [2]. This family is involved in a
diverse array of physiological functions in vertebrates,
including neurotransmission, learning, memory, and various endocrine and hormonal pathways. All of its members are thought to share the same tertiary structure,
mechanisms of activation, and activation of G proteins,
even if the downstream effectors of the G proteins may
differ. Despite the vast array of functions mediated by this
family of receptors, the highly conserved seven helical
transmembrane structure of GPCR's as a whole (particularly the Class A type, of which opsins are a member) has
ensured that insertions and deletions remain rare, particularly in transmembrane regions.
Visual pigments can vary widely in their wavelength of
maximal absorption, ranging from the ultraviolet to the
red. The molecular basis of spectral sensitivity depends on
interactions between amino acids within the binding
pocket of an opsin protein and its associated light-sensitive chromophore. Any variation in the amino acid
sequence of a given opsin can, therefore, directly influence
the spectral wavelengths an organism can detect. Phylogenetically, visual pigments are divided into 5 groups,
roughly reflecting their function in vision, such as
whether they are active during the day (cone opsins) or at
night (rod opsins), and the spectral tuning of the wavelengths at which they are maximally sensitive [3-5]: red/
green or long-wavelength sensitive cone opsins (LWS;
approx. 500–570 nm), rod-like or medium-wavelength
sensitive cone opsins (RH2; approx. 465–520 nm), ultraviolet/violet or short-wavelength sensitive type 1 cone
opsins (SWS1; approx. 360–430 nm), blue or short-wavelength sensitive type 2 cone opsins (SWS2; approx. 430–
460 nm), and the rod opsins active at low light levels
(RH1; approx. 500 nm). The SWS1 opsins are the shortest
wavelength sensitive opsins, and are generally expressed
in a particular type of cone photoreceptor found throughout vertebrates that is characterized by an extremely short
outer segment [6], though exceptions do exist [7]. Only a
few types of vertebrates, such as those living in extreme
low light environments (subterranean or deep sea habitats) are thought to lack this type of cone. For example,
pseudogenes have been identified in the blind Ehrenberg's mole rat [8], as well in the bottle-nosed dolphin [9]
and a number of whales [10]. Similarly, organisms with
primarily nocturnal behaviours may also lack the SWS1
opsin; such as the owl monkey and the bushbaby [11].
Perhaps due to the highly conserved nature of its role in
vertebrate vision, the SWS1 opsin (hereafter SWS1) occurs
as a single copy nuclear gene in almost all animals investigated thus far. However, despite the fundamental impor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/97

tance of this gene for vision at short wavelengths, SWS1
exhibits considerable sequence variation across the diversity of vertebrates that have been investigated. This variation may be a product of SWS1 functional diversity, as
measured by absorption sensitivities [12-14], which in
visual pigments have often been found to be optimized to
specific visual environments [5,15,16]. To investigate the
molecular evolution of SWS1, we conducted phylogenetic
analyses of the gene using available vertebrate sequences.
SWS1 genes have been cloned from a considerable variety
of vertebrates, ranging from the lamprey to mammals.
Surprisingly, we found that this single gene appears to
reconstruct many of the commonly accepted relationships
among vertebrates (Figure 1), for both deeper and more
recent divergences. Indeed, SWS1 results were comparable
to those obtained from more exhaustive analyses using
multi-gene data sets [e.g. [17-20]]. Here, we present a
comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate SWS1
sequences. We then investigate the characteristics of this
gene that contribute to its evident success as a phylogenetic marker across a broad taxonomic range.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses
Sixty-two vertebrate SWS1 opsin nucleotide coding
sequences were obtained from GenBank, aligned using
ClustalX [21], and analyzed using a variety of phylogenetic methods including maximum parsimony [22,23],
maximum likelihood [24,25], and Bayesian methods
[26]. A series of nested likelihood ratio tests were performed using ModelTest [27] in order to determine which
nucleotide model of those tested best fit the data. Of the
nucleotide models commonly implemented for phylogenetic analysis, the general time-reversible model incorporating parameters for invariant sites, as well as among-site
rate heterogeneity (GTR+I+Γ) [28-30] was found to fit the
data significantly better than any simpler model. This
model was therefore used in subsequent likelihood and
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Assessing confidence in
nodes of the phylogeny was accomplished by bootstrap
analysis [31] or Bayesian posterior probabilities [26]. The
results of the phylogenetic analyses are shown in Figure 2,
with the bootstrap values of the maximum parsimony
(MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and posterior probabilities of the Bayesian analyses mapped onto the MP tree.

In all analyses, the reconstructed clades were remarkably
similar to currently accepted vertebrate relationships
based on morphological and molecular analyses (Figure
1). Among the available sequences, however, there are
quite a few groups not represented in our dataset, such as
cartilaginous fish, monotremes, turtles, crocodiles and
snakes. The lack of adequate sampling is particularly evident in the non-tetrapod vertebrates, with the only
sequences available being some of the more recently

derived ray-finned fish lineages. However, on the basis of
the taxa available, the vertebrate clade is divided into two
major groups: actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), and
tetrapods. The latter clade is further divided into modern
amphibians (frogs and salamanders), mammals, and reptiles (birds+squamates). This is in surprisingly good agreement with the generally accepted relationships among the
major vertebrate lineages according to molecular and
morphological data as summarized in Figure 1[18,32-39].
Within the ray-finned fishes, our trees support the basal
position of ostariophysans (carp, goldfish, and zebrafish),
followed by the neoteleosts, salmonids, and smelt, a situation congruent with morphological [40], mitochondrial
[35] and nuclear data [41]. Between the latter three clades,
however, the relationships remain debated: in some morphological studies salmonids and smelts form a clade
[42], whereas in other investigations salmonids group
with the neoteleosts [40]. A monophyly of smelts and
neoteleosts has also been proposed [43,44], and has since
received support from molecular analyses [20,35]. Our
analyses are in agreement with the foremost hypothesis,
having salmonids and smelts as a monophyletic sister
group to neoteleosts.
In our analyses, there is only weak support for the monophyletic grouping of modern amphibians (30% MP bootstrap, 24% ML bootstrap, 0.66 Bayesian posterior
probability). The paraphyly of amphibians has been suggested by Carroll [45] using morphological and paleontological data; by contrast, most research, including the
remaining paleontological studies and all molecular analyses, disagree with this hypothesis and maintain the
monophyly of modern amphibians [46,47]. It should be
mentioned, however, that only four amphibian sequences
were available for this study, which might be the reason
for the lack of resolution in our results.
Within birds, our results confirm the chicken as basal and
sister to the Neoaves (all other birds), with the passerines
(Passerida) as monophyletic and most derived, a result
congruent with recent molecular studies [37,48]. Previous
studies by Sibley and Ahlquist [48] using DNA-DNA
hybridization, which since has been supported by nuclear
and mitochondrial sequence data [38,49], divided Passerida into three major clades: Muscicapoidea (represented
in our phylogeny by the bluethroat and Siberian rubythroat), Sylvoidea (tits), and Passeroidea (finch and bishops); patterns of these relationships were identified in all
our reconstructed phylogenies.
Among mammals, marsupials are found to be the basal
lineage within Mammalia, followed by the monophyletic
groupings of rodents (minus the guinea pig), laurasiatherians, afrotherians, and higher primates; these relation-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/97

ships are all well supported by recent research [see [50] for
review]. Moreover, the more recent divergences within
these mammalian clades also resemble the results found
by other investigations. For example, all three phylogenies
show apes and Old World monkeys to be monophyletic,
forming the catarrhines, with the New World monkeys, or
platyrrhines, as a sister group, which together form the
higher primates. Although their positions are unresolved
in the MP consensus tree, there is some support for the
prosimians (the lemur and tarsier) as the most basally
positioned primates in the bootstrap (57% ML, 48% MP)
and Bayesian analyses (0.9 posterior probability). Our
results correspond not only with molecular phylogenies
constructed using nuclear [51] as well as mitochondrial
[52] datasets, but also with morphological data [53].
Patterns of sequence variation in the SWS1 data set
Given the utility of SWS1 for elucidating vertebrate evolutionary relationships across a range of divergences, we
explored patterns of sequence variation in our data set by
estimating parameters such as base composition, amongsite rate heterogeneity, and informative sites using parsimony and likelihood phylogenetic methods, and then
compared them to those published for other molecular
phylogenetic data sets.

The aligned SWS1 nucleotide dataset consisted of 1083
characters, of which 686 (63%) were parsimony informative. The proportion of invariant sites in our data set was
estimated in two ways: (1) by calculating the observed
number of invariant sites in our alignment, and (2) by
estimating the number of sites likely to be invariant under
a particular model of evolution (Table 1). Within vertebrates, there were a relatively small proportion of sites
estimated as invariant (I = 0.17). Within the data partitions corresponding to the major vertebrate groups, ML
estimates do not exceed 0.34. SWS1 tended to have similar proportions of invariant sites as other nuclear markers
commonly used for phylogenetic purposes, as estimated
using ML methods, for example RAG1 (0.34, squamates
[54], 0.36, amphibians [55], 0.40, rodents [56]) or RAG2
(0.24, frogs [55]). While it is generally assumed that a
lower proportion of invariable sites might be indicative of
greater phylogenetic information in the data set, this
parameter is often difficult to estimate accurately [57,58].
The parameter (α) describing the shape of the Γ-distribution used to account for among-site rate heterogeneity was
estimated for the SWS1 data set using likelihood methods
to be approximately 1.0 (Table 1). This suggests a fairly
even distribution of different substitution rates across
sites. Other nuclear genes widely used in phylogenetic
analyses tend to have α estimates of at least 1. For example, RAG1 ranges from 1.0 in amphibians [55] to 1.7 in
squamates [54]. When α is equal to 1, substitution rates

are exponentially distributed, which is intermediate
between the bell-shaped curves at higher values (α > 1)
and 'L' shaped functions at lower values (α < 1). This
exponential shape suggests that there is a more evenly distributed range of substitution rates across sites than would
be the case for higher or lower α values. It has been suggested that higher values of α might be better in aiding
phylogenetic resolution [59]. But, a more even range of
slow to fast evolving sites may be best for phylogenetic
analyses because it incorporates both slow sites to carry a
signal from deeper divergences, as well as fast sites for
more recent divergences. Past studies, based on both
empirical data [60] and simulations [59,61] have suggested that large amounts of among-site rate variation (as
indicated by low values of α) such as those often found in
some mitochondrial data sets, might tend to adversely
affect phylogenetic signal.
Furthermore, the variability observed in SWS1 does not
appear to be concentrated on third base positions only, as
is often the case in many genes; relative to other molecular
markers a great deal of variation is found at first and second positions as well. First, although about 92% of third
codon positions were parsimony informative, the proportion of informative sites present in first and second codon
positions was 55% and 41%, respectively. Second, esti-

mates of invariant sites (I) were generally low across all
three codon positions (Table 1), though the proportion of
invariant sites was lowest at third positions, as expected.
Third, relatively high α values were also found for first
(0.84) and second codon positions (0.65), though highest at third positions (4.7).
Most protein-coding data sets show higher α values (and
lower I values) at third codon positions compared to first
and second positions [62]. However, the values of α at
first and second codon positions in the SWS1 data set
were comparatively high. For example, under a similar
model of evolution (GTR+I+Γ), Dettai and Lecointre [63]
estimated α values of 0.29 for both codon positions in a
portion of the MLL gene in fish, as compared with 0.42
and 0.41 for first and second positions in fish SWS1 genes.
This would suggest that variation in substitution rates
tends to be more evenly distributed across codon positions in the SWS1 data set, and that more sites in the gene
are phylogenetically informative.
Maximum likelihood estimates of substitution rate
parameters in the SWS1 data set under the GTR+I+Γ
model did not exhibit substantial skew when estimated
across vertebrates, with values ranging only from about
1.0 to 3.3 (Table 1). This range of values is smaller than

many other data sets, including cyt b in birds (0.5 to 8.8
[37]), RAG1 in squamates (1.0 to 7.6 [64]), and RAG1 in
amphibians (1.0 to 5.7 [55]). A skewed rate matrix may
decrease the number of states a given site can have, resulting in increased homoplasy and potential loss of phylogenetic information. Although this has yet to be investigated
in detail in many data sets, a recent comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear genes in insects [65] found that
nuclear genes tended to have more homogeneous patterns
of among-site rate variation (i.e., larger α values), as well
as more symmetrical transformation rate matrices, and
that these patterns appeared to be associated with phylogenetic utility in their data sets.
Furthermore, substitution rate matrices were estimated in
different data partitions of the SWS1 data set corresponding to the different vertebrate groups and/or codon position (Table 1). Overall, the rate matrices remain relatively
homogeneous and unskewed across different partitions of
the data set, although there were certain partitions exhibiting differences in particular rate parameters. For example, there is some variation in substitution rates between
C and G in reptiles, as compared with fish and mammals
(3.3, 0.1, and 0.73 respectively), and across vertebrates at
second codon positions, as compared with first and third
positions (7.3, 0.7, and 0.6 respectively). Also, fish generally tend to have higher substitution rates relative to other
vertebrate groups at second codon positions (Table 1).
Base composition was estimated using likelihood methods under the GTR+I+Γ model for the complete data set,
as well as within partitions of the data corresponding to
individual codon positions, and the major vertebrate
groups (Table 2). Base compositional biases can be problematic in phylogenetic analyses, particularly if there is
convergence in bias across unrelated groups [66-68]. The
SWS1 data set does not appear to be affected in this manner. Despite a significantly heterogeneous base compositional bias overall (chi-square test of homogeneity p <
0.001, df = 183; Table 2), in the different data partitions,
corresponding to the major vertebrate groups and/or
codon position, the base frequencies are generally found
to be homogeneously distributed throughout the data set,
except in tetrapods and in third positions of many vertebrate groups (Table 2). Second positions showed a
slightly increased frequency of T, but this was also found
to be homogeneous across the data set (Table 2). The high
frequency of T at second codon positions is also seen in
genes such as rod opsin and cyt b, and presumably reflects
a strong functional constraint in genes coding for transmembrane proteins, which contain many hydrophobic
amino acids such as Ile (ATY), Phe (TYY) and, Leu (YTR)
[69,70]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/97

In summary, molecular patterns in the vertebrate SWS1
data suggest a substantial amount of variation across the
three codon positions, as well as high among-site rate variation throughout the gene. As well, the substitution rates
tend to be fairly homogeneous among the different
classes. Although there is some bias in nucleotide composition across different codon positions, this bias appears
to be non-convergent.

Discussion
Despite the ever increasing number of gene sequences
available in the databases, it remains surprisingly difficult
to select genes that will be useful for phylogenetic analyses, particularly across a variety of taxonomic ranges.
Known issues in molecular phylogenetics such as model
mis-specification, gene paralogs and alignment ambiguities often contribute to misleading results [71], and
accounting for effects such as among-site rate heterogeneity can substantially alter results. For example, early analyses of mtDNA data tended to place the root of the avian
phylogeny within passerines [72-75], a result in strong
conflict with prior phylogenetic studies [48]. Further analysis of mitochondrial data that accounted for unequal
evolutionary rates among sites, however, recovered the
traditional division of birds between palaeognathans and
neognathans, with passerines being a phylogenetically
derived neognath lineage [76]. Similarly, correcting for
base compositional bias in a mammalian data set of full
mitochondrial genomes increased support for marsupials
as the sister group of placentals [34], as opposed to the
original analysis, which supported a marsupialmonotreme grouping [77]. Many characteristics have
been identified as problematic; however, we know little
about exactly what characteristics make a strong molecular marker. For example, in insects, comparisons of nucleotide substitution patterns and phylogenetic utility
between nuclear ribosomal and protein coding genes [78]
as well as between nuclear and mitochondrial genes [65]
identified a number of features as useful for phylogenetic
analyses, including larger values of α (parameter for
among-site rate heterogeneity), and relatively unskewed
substitution rate parameters. However, such studies
remain relatively rare in the literature.
Mitochondrial genes have been widely used in molecular
systematics due to the relative ease with which mitochondrial genes, or even whole genomes can be amplified and
sequenced, as well as the absence of problematic features
often associated with nuclear markers such as introns, heterozygosity, and paralogy. Mitochondrial genes can, however, suffer from some marked disadvantages. In most
cases mitochondrial genes are thought to evolve much
faster than nuclear genes [[79], but see [80]], and they
may be subject to significant rate accelerations and decelerations in evolutionary history [81], possibly due to

changes in factors such as metabolic rate [82]. Such rate
differences can easily lead to positively misleading topological effects [83], and may be particularly problematic
in resolving deeper relationships or rapid radiations such
as those found within mammals [84]. Furthermore, mitochondrial data sets can often be biased in terms of base
composition, which has been found to contribute to misleading signal in a number of data sets including basal vertebrates [66,85], birds [76] and mammals [34,86,87].
However, their faster rate of evolution in comparison to
nuclear genes can be useful for resolving more recent relationships [65].
Recent years have shown a dramatic increase in the
number of nuclear genes that have been developed for
vertebrate phylogenetics in order to complement and
expand the set of useful phylogenetic markers [88-90].
Some nuclear genes have been used with success in multiple vertebrate groups ranging from fish to mammals, for
example RAG1 and 2 [91-93], c-mos [37,64], c-myc
[38,56], MLL [41,63], and 18S [94,95]. A host of other
nuclear genes have been used primarily in particular vertebrate groups, such as rod opsin in ray-finned fish
[63,69], and more recently amphibians [55,96]; β-fibrinogen introns in birds [97], and a variety of genes aimed at
resolving higher level mammalian phylogenetics: IRBP, α2B adrenergic receptor, aquaporin, β-basein, γ-fibrinogen,
κ-casein, protamine, and von Willebrand Factor [84].

Despite the success of nuclear markers in resolving some
of the longstanding problems in vertebrate phylogenetics
[32,50], several issues continue to plague many molecular
data sets. First, alignment issues, though long recognized
as problematic, often tend to be overlooked in many data
sets. Some sequences, particularly ribosomal genes such
as 18S, are known to be difficult to align properly [98],
and these alignment ambiguities can significantly affect
phylogeny reconstruction [95,99]. However, these problems can easily be avoided by careful selection of molecular markers that are unambiguously alignable. Second,
and even more importantly, some of the important
assumptions currently incorporated into commonly used
phylogenetic methods may not be reasonable for many
molecular data sets. For instance, most molecular models
of evolution assume that state frequencies, and even more
importantly, substitution rate frequencies do not change
over evolutionary time, assumptions incorporated in likelihood/Bayesian methods which tend to model molecular
evolution as stationary, homogeneous Markov processes
[100].
Even though nuclear data sets tend to suffer fewer problems than mitochondrial genes with respect to base compositional changes across a phylogeny, there are examples
of nuclear data sets for which nonstationarity can yield
positively misleading results, if there is convergence in
base compositional bias [101,102], or worse yet, codon
bias [66,103] among lineages. The use of phylogenetic

methods that have been developed to take into account
nonstationarity in base frequencies using either distance
[67,104] or likelihood approaches [105] can at least
somewhat ameliorate these effects, though not for codon
bias issues [66,103].
More recently, the use of genome-based approaches has
enabled more extensive investigations of sources of systematic bias, or inconsistency in phylogenetic analyses
[102,106-108] and identified new effects difficult to
detect in smaller data sets, such as site-specific changes in
evolutionary rates among lineages, or heterotachy [109111]. However, these issues are only just being addressed,
and the robustness of current phylogenetic models to
such violations explored [112-116]. Similarly, the issue of
changes in substitution rate frequencies across a phylogeny, or nonhomogeneity, has received relatively little
attention, though it has been recognized as a potential
problem [67,104,117,118]. Accounting for such effects in
more complex models of evolution may be useful for
genomic scale analyses, but it is not clear how much
power such parameter-rich models may have for relatively
small data sets. Selecting genes less susceptible to these
effects would tend to obviate the necessity of implementing more complex models, and therefore tend to increase
the statistical power of likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods.
With regard to some of the issues plaguing many molecular data sets, SWS1 visual pigment genes offer several clear
advantages. First, this gene has very few indels in its evolution across vertebrates, making for a largely unambiguous alignment, and it is a single copy nuclear gene with no
paralogs of high sequence similarity. Second, for the vertebrate SWS1 data set, base frequencies were found to be
fairly constant across the phylogeny. There was little evidence of base compositional heterogeneity; aside from
third codon positions in fish, reptiles, and tetrapods.
Third, the SWS1 data set exhibits a relatively unskewed
distribution of substitution rate frequencies among the
different types of substitutions, and a substantial amount
of among site rate variation, both of which are characteristics that previous studies suggest might be important for
phylogenetic utility [59,65,78]. Fourth, the substitution
rate frequencies are not only unskewed, they are also relatively constant across the phylogeny, indicative of a
homogeneous substitution process, which may be important in not attenuating phylogenetic signal across fairly
large divergences.
Why does the SWS1 visual pigment gene exhibit useful
phylogenetic characteristics across such a wide range of
divergences in vertebrates? Factors important in contributing to its utility as a phylogenetic marker may be due, at
least in part, to the highly conserved, yet somewhat varia-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/97

ble nature of its functional role in visual transduction. The
fundamental role of SWS1 genes in mediating visual sensitivities at the shortest wavelengths of the spectrum is
highly conserved throughout vertebrates, along with its
expression in a specific photoreceptor cell in the retina
characterized by extremely short outer segments [119121]. Unlike many other genes used for systematic purposes, which are often housekeeping genes which tend to
be expressed ubiquitously in many different cell types, or
developmental genes that may be expressed in a different
tissues mediating a variety of functions, SWS1 genes are
generally only expressed in a particular photoreceptor cell
type, though they have been found in rare instances to be
co-expressed in other types of photoreceptors with longer
wavelength-sensitive opsin genes, for example in the
mouse [122], guinea pig [7], and tiger salamander [123].
Its overall tertiary 3D structure has remained unchanged,
most likely due to constraints imposed by its role as an
integral membrane protein, and the mechanisms of activation which require specific structural rotations of the
helices which are thought to be conserved in many G-protein coupled receptors [124]. This conserved role in evolution may be important for maintaining homogeneous
molecular evolutionary processes such as substitution rate
frequencies across vertebrate evolution.
Along with its highly conserved role as the first step in visual transduction, vertebrate SWS1 visual pigments are
well-understood examples of functional variation in spectral sensitivity: SWS1 pigments can range in maximal
absorption from the ultraviolet to violet [see [12,125] for
reviews]. However, these shifts in function are thought to
be mediated via a few specific residues in the protein [see
[12]]. Despite the obvious constraints on protein structure, and adaptive changes in function such as spectral
sensitivities, these factors may have only limited influence
in restricting protein sequence evolution, as SWS1 clearly
shows a substantial amount of evolutionary variation
capable of carrying phylogenetic information. In fact, the
constraints imposed by SWS1 structure and function may
provide a framework in which the protein can vary in a
more homogeneous fashion that allows for the retention
of a strong phylogenetic signal.

Conclusion
The various phylogenetic methods used to analyse SWS1
produced strongly supported topologies showing remarkable congruence with most traditionally accepted hypotheses of vertebrate evolution from the consensus of
morphological and molecular studies. This nuclear, protein coding gene recovers not only deep relationships,
usually requiring combinations of genes, but also recent
relationships that typically require markers with high rates
of evolution, such as mitochondrial DNA. The few exceptions include the monophyly of the primates, the relation-

ships among the major groups of placental mammals, and
the position of the guinea pig, which remain inconclusive
in many data sets.
The phylogenetic utility of the SWS1 gene may result from
a number of features of the SWS1 gene found to be important in previous studies, including substantial among site
rate variation. Its ability to carry a phylogenetic signal
across a broad range of divergences in vertebrates may
also be due to a number of features, such as fairly homogeneous substitution rate matrix parameters, which are
potentially important but largely unexplored for other
phylogenetic markers. Future studies will explore these
characteristics in data sets of other nuclear markers, in
order to assess how well they correlate with phylogenetic
utility.

Methods
Sequence alignment
Sixty two vertebrate SWS1 opsin nucleotide and amino
acid sequences were retrieved from GenBank, with accession numbers for all sequences used in the analyses presented here provided in Table 3. SWS1 coding sequences
range in length from 1005 (salmonids) to 1056 (pig)
nucleotides, with very few indels (only 6 indels in complete coding sequences in the entire alignment; see Table
3 and Additional file 1). All SWS1 opsin genes identified
so far have four introns at highly conserved homologous
positions (located at amino acid positions 120, 176, 231,
and 311 in the macaque sequence [126]). The first two
introns are generally short, ranging in length from 70–76
bp in fish (Dimidiochromis compressiceps), to 283–324 bp
in mammals (Macaca fascicularis); whereas the second two
introns tend to be longer (120–143 bp in D. compressiceps,
627–979 bp in M. fascicularis) [126,127]. Only one copy
of SWS1 has been found in all taxa investigated so far,
with the exception of the smelt (Plecoglossus altivelis),
which may be due to a unique duplication specific to this
lineage of fish [128]. Only one smelt sequence was
included in our analyses, as investigations including the
second sequence showed it to be strongly monophyletic
with the first, and had no other effect on the phylogeny
(results not shown).

Sampling within the vertebrate groups was as follows: one
lamprey (Geotria australis), 17 actinopterygians (all of
which were teleosts); four lissamphibians (referred to in
the text as amphibians); 13 birds; three squamates; and 23
mammals (Table 3). The amino acid sequences were
aligned using ClustalX [21], Additional file 1). This amino
acid alignment was then used to produce an equivalently
aligned nucleotide sequence alignment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/97

Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using PAUP*v4b10,
[129] for the maximum parsimony (MP) and likelihood
(ML) methods, and MrBayes version 3.1 [130] for the
Bayesian analyses. For the MP analysis all characters were
assigned equal weight. Heuristic searches, with random
addition of taxa and TBR branch swapping, were performed with 10000 random-addition sequences. A strict
consensus tree was calculated from the equally most parsimonious trees found. To assess support for internal
branches, bootstrap analyses [31] of 1000 replicates with
10 random-addition sequences for each replicate, were
performed.

ModelTest [27] was used to perform a series of nested likelihood ratio tests in order to determine which nucleotide
model of those tested best fit the data. This model was
then used in subsequent model-based phylogenetic analyses such as likelihood and Bayesian analyses. Heuristic
ML analyses were conducted with TBR branch swapping
(10 random addition replicates), as well as bootstrap
analyses with 100 replicates in order to assess the robustness of the clades recovered [31]. The Bayesian analyses
were run for two million generations with default priors,
sampling the chains every 100 generations. To ensure that
our analyses were not trapped in local optima, four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were
performed (with default heating values). Stationarity was
assumed when the cumulative posterior probabilities of
all clades stabilized. The first 5000 trees were considered
'burn-in' and discarded, and the remaining trees were
saved. The associated Bayesian posterior probabilities
were calculated from the sample points after the MCMC
algorithm started to converge.
Nucleotide composition and substitution frequencies
Parameters such as base frequencies, substitution rate frequencies, among site rate variation (α), and invariant sites
(I) were all estimated on the ML phylogeny using maximum likelihood methods under the GTR+I+Γ model [2830] as implemented in PAUP*. Chi-squared tests of base
compositional homogeneity were also implemented in
PAUP* [129]. Since estimates of invariant sites (I) can be
problematic, particularly in reduced data partitions due to
insufficient data [58], the number of invariant sites was
therefore also calculated by simple counts of the observed
number of constant sites in our data set, as implemented
in MEGA3 [131].
