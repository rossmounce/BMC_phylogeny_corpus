Abstract
Background: Integrins comprise a large family of α,β heterodimeric, transmembrane cell adhesion
receptors that mediate diverse essential biological functions. Higher vertebrates possess a single
β1 gene, and the β1 subunit associates with a large number of α subunits to form the major class
of extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors. Despite the fact that the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a rapidly
emerging model organism of choice for developmental biology and for models of human disease,
little is currently known about β1 integrin sequences and functions in this organism.
Results: Using RT-PCR, complete coding sequences of zebrafish β1 paralogs were obtained from
zebrafish embryos or adult tissues. The results show that zebrafish possess two β1 paralogs (β1–
1 and β1–2) that have a high degree of identity to other vertebrate β1 subunits. In addition, a third,
more divergent, β1 paralog is present (β1–3), which may have altered ligand-binding properties.
Zebrafish also have other divergent β1-like transcripts, which are C-terminally truncated forms
lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Together with β1–3 these truncated forms
comprise a novel group of β1 paralogs, all of which have a mutation in the ADMIDAS cation-binding
site. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses indicate that the duplication that gave rise to β1–1 and β1–
2 occurred after the divergence of the tetrapod and fish lineages, while a subsequent duplication of
the ancestor of β1–2 may have given rise to β1–3 and an ancestral truncated paralog. A very recent
tandem duplication of the truncated β1 paralogs appears to have taken place. The different
zebrafish β1 paralogs have varied patterns of temporal expression during development. β1–1 and
β1–2 are ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues, whereas the other β1 paralogs generally show
more restricted patterns of expression.
Conclusion: Zebrafish have a large set of integrin β1 paralogs. β1–1 and β1–2 may share the roles
of the solitary β1 subunit found in other vertebrates, whereas β1–3 and the truncated β1 paralogs
may have acquired novel functions.

Background
Integrins are a family of metazoan cell surface receptors
that play critical roles in cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and survival [1]. Integrins are heterodimeric
glycoproteins containing non-covalently associated α and
β subunits, and are grouped into sub-families according to
the identity of the β subunit. In humans, eight different β
subunits combine with 18 different α subunits to form 24
functionally distinct heterodimers. Integrins have a large
extracellular domain responsible for interacting with
extracellular ligands, and a small intracellular domain
that binds to cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. Integrins
assimilate information from the extracellular and intracellular environments by acting as bi-directional transducers
of signals across the cell membrane. Hence, the binding of
an extracellular ligand can elicit activation of intracellular
signaling pathways and reorganisation of the cytoskeleton
[2,3]. Conversely, changes in intracellular signaling can
result in the stimulation or inhibition of ligand binding
due to conformational changes in the extracellular
domains of an integrin [4-6].
Integrin ligands include the major ECM components laminins, fibronectin and collagens. The β1 integrin sub-family contains 12 different heterodimers in mammals, which
form the major group of cell-ECM receptors. An ECMbinding β chain is probably the most ancient, in evolutionary terms, of all the integrin β chains [7,8]. β1
integrins have widespread essential functions both during
development and in the adult organism [9-12].
Sequence analysis and X-ray crystal structures [13-15]
have demonstrated that all integrin β subunits have an
identical domain structure (shown schematically in Fig.
1). At the N-terminus there is a PSI (plexin/semaphorin/
integrin) domain, into which is inserted an immunoglobulin fold known as the hybrid domain. A von Willebrand
factor type A domain (known as the A or I-like domain) is
in turn inserted within the hybrid domain. The PSI
domain also links directly to the C-terminal portion of the
β subunit, which contains four epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-type repeats (EGF-1 to EGF-4), a cystatin-like fold
known as the β-terminal domain (βTD), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail.
The A domain is the portion of the β subunit that is
involved in extracellular ligand binding; this domain also
is critical for the interactions with the α subunit that lead
to heterodimerisation. The A domain consists of a central
β-sheet encircled by seven α helices, and has two large
sequence insertions compared to other A domains [16].
These insertions, which are critical for ligand binding and
for association with the α subunit, lie in the loops
between β-strands B and C and between β-strand D and α
helix 5 [13,14]. The βC-βD loop (otherwise known the

'specificity-determining loop') contains a small disulfidebonded segment that contributes to the differences in ligand-binding specificity between different integrin heterodimers [17-19]. The A domain also contains three
cation-binding sites: MIDAS (metal-ion dependent adhesion site), ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS) and LIMBS
(ligand-associated metal binding site) [13,14]. The
MIDAS site is critical for ligand recognition, whereas the
ADMIDAS and LIMBS sites appear to have regulatory roles
[20,21].
X-ray crystal structures [13-15] of the extracellular
domains have revealed that the overall shape of the β subunit is that of a 'head' connected to a long 'leg' with an
intervening 'genu' or 'knee' (Fig. 1). The A domain and
hybrid domain form part of the integrin head region,
whereas the PSI and EGF-1 and EGF-2 lie in the knee

region; the remaining EGF repeats and βTD domain contribute to the leg region. The conversion of an integrin
from an inactive to an active state is proposed to involve
an unbending of the knee region, and a key hinge point in
the knee region has recently been proposed to lie in EGF2 [15]. A critical feature of this unbending is the release of
the hybrid domain from interactions with other integrin
domains, thereby allowing the hybrid to undergo an outward pivoting. In turn, this movement causes conformational changes in the A domain that promote ligand
recognition [14,22]. The β subunit cytoplasmic tail contains a HDRRE motif for interaction with the α subunit
cytoplasmic domain [23], and NPXY sequences that are
involved in binding to cytoskeletal proteins such as talin
and filamin [24].
The zebrafish is an emerging model organism with a large
number of attractive features for studying the function of
genes, such as: (i) the external and rapid development of
embryos, (ii) the transparency of embryos, which allows
visualisation and tracking of individual cells or groups of
cells, (iii) the high degree of conservation between
zebrafish and human genes, (iv) the similarities between
human and zebrafish embryonic development resulting
in a large proportion of tissues and organs being grossly
similar between the two species, (v) its genetic tractability,
aided by the availability of powerful genetic tools such as
gene knock-down by morpholino-modified antisense oligonucleotides (morpholinos) [25] and gene knockout by
target-selected mutational inactivation of genes (TILLING)[26], and (vi) the partially complete genome
sequence [59]. In addition, zebrafish is finding increasing
use as a model organism to study human diseases [27,28];
in many of these disorders integrin-ligand interactions
play important roles in the initiation or progression of the
disease [29].
To date, our knowledge of the biological roles of integrins
in vertebrates has been derived mainly from knockout
studies in mice [30,31]. For the reasons described above,
zebrafish provide a very attractive alternative model system for studying integrin function during development
and disease. Currently, however, very little published
information is available concerning the sequences and
complement of integrin genes in this organism. Here we
have investigated if β1-like genes and transcripts are
found in zebrafish. We found that zebrafish have two β1
paralogs that are closely related to the single gene found
in other vertebrates. Surprisingly, we also found multiple,
more divergent, zebrafish β1 paralogs, many of which are
truncated and entirely novel forms.

Results

Zebrafish have two β1 paralogs (β1–1 and β1–2) that are
closely related to human β1
To amplify β1-like sequences, primers were designed
based on partial sequences in the zebrafish genome
project or from EST databases (see Methods). Complete
coding sequences were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA
from 4-day old embryos. Two of the sequences obtained,
designated β1–1 and β1–2, had a high degree of identity
to other vertebrate β1 sequences, such as human β1 [Genbank Q8WUM6] (Fig. 2). These two sequences are >76%
identical to human β1 overall but two regions of the subunits are extremely well conserved (Fig. 3A,B). The first of
these regions is the A domain, indicating that the key
functional features of this domain are retained in these β
subunits. Highly conserved portions of the A domain
include the loops important for ligand binding and association with the α subunits (Fig. 2). All residues involved
in the coordination of the MIDAS, ADMIDAS and LIMBS
cations are also completely conserved (Fig. 2). The second
region of very strong conservation is the transmembrane
domain and cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that the signaling
and intracellular ligand binding properties of these
sequences have been highly conserved. The conserved features include the HDRRE α subunit cytoplasmic domain
interaction sequence and the two NPXY motifs [23,24].
All 56 cysteine residues in the extracellular domains are
also perfectly conserved between β1–1, β1–2 and human
β1. The sequences of β1–1 and β1–2 are 81% identical to
each other; β1–2 is 84% identical to a published catfish β1
sequence [32] [Genbank:Q9AI01].
Zebrafish have a third β1 paralog (β1–3), which is more
divergent in sequence from human β1
A third sequence amplified from zebrafish embryos, designated β1–3, was considerably more divergent in
sequence from human β1 than β1–1 and β1–2 (Fig. 3 and
Table 1). β1–3 also has fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (five) than β1–1 and β1–2 (which both have
eight). However, as observed for β1–1 and β1–2, all 56
cysteine residues are perfectly conserved. Overall, β1–3 is
more closely related in sequence to β1–2 than to β1–1
(Table 1). In comparison to the very high degree of
sequence conservation seen for the A domains of β1–1
and β1–2, the A domain of β1–3 is not well conserved
(Fig. 3). Although the MIDAS and LIMBS cation-binding
sites are conserved in the β1–3 A domain, two aspartate
residues are substituted by Ser/Asn at the ADMIDAS site;
these two aspartate residues are present in all other chordate β1 subunits. Because each aspartate residue provides
two carboxylate oxygen atoms for coordination of the
AMIDAS cation, the double substitution will probably
lead to loss of cation binding at the ADMIDAS. We have
previously shown that mutation of these residues in
human β1 causes constitutive inactivation of α5β1 [20].

In addition, the sequence of the 'specificity-determining
loop' between β strands B and C differs at several positions to that of the other β1 subunits; most notably, the
sequence of the disulfide-linked loop [17] in β1–3
(CFPSDC) is markedly different to that of β1–1 and β1–2,
which are both very similar to human β1 sequence (CTSEQNC). Hence, β1–3 is likely to have altered ligand-binding and α subunit association properties compared with
β1–1 and β1–2 [17,19]. However, the transmembrane
domain and cytoplasmic tail of β1–3 is highly conserved,
and this region is therefore likely to retain all the signaling
characteristics and intracellular ligand binding features of
β1–1 and β1–2.

Zebrafish have truncated β1 paralogs that are closely
related to β1–3
Several zebrafish database partial EST sequences [60]
(Table 2) appeared to be orthologous to human β1 but to
differ in sequence with β1–1, β1–2 and β1–3. Two of
these ESTs, ESTa and ESTb, were selected for complete
sequencing. Although the ESTs were found to be fulllength cDNA clones extending from the start codon to the
polyA tail, the integrin sequence carried a stop codon at
the end of the EGF repeats (see Additional file 1). Hence,
these transcripts were lacking the βTD, transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domains. The coding sequences of the
two ESTs were 95% identical to each other at the amino

of paralogs are bona fide truncated β1-like subunits. The
sequence of the truncated paralogs is shown in Fig. 2, and
in alignment with the EST sequences in Fig. 4. The truncated β1 paralogs are 95–98% identical to the EST
sequences or to each other (Table 1); β1tr-1 and β1tr-2 are
most like ESTb, whereas β1tr-3 has a similar degree of
identity to both ESTa and ESTb. The sequence differences
between the truncated paralogs were not due to PCR or
sequencing errors because the sequences were confirmed
in multiple independent PCR products. The truncated
paralogs are even more divergent from human β1 than is
β1–3 (Table 1, Fig. 5A), and like β1–3, these paralogs have
relatively few potential glycosylation sites (β1tr-1 and
β1tr-2 both have three sites, β1tr-3 has four). However, all
cysteine residues remain perfectly conserved, although an
additional cysteine residue is present in EGF-4. This extra
cysteine residue could form a disulfide bond with the
cysteine residue present in the additional four residues at
the C-terminus (Fig. 4).

acid level. The two ESTs had almost identical 5' sequences
but were more divergent in the 3' region, including the
3'UTR. In order to examine whether similar sequences
could be amplified from zebrafish embryos, we performed RT-PCR using a common forward (5') primer but
with different reverse (3') primers, which were specific for
either ESTa or ESTb (see Additional file 1). PCR products
were subcloned and individual clones were sequenced.
The most abundant sequence obtained using the ESTa
reverse primer from 4-day-old embryo RNA was designated β1tr-1 (truncated β1 paralog 1); the predominant
sequence obtained using the ESTb reverse primer was designated β1tr-2 (truncated β1 paralog 2). Since ESTa was
obtained from an adult kidney cDNA library, we also used
the same primer sets to amplify products from reverse
transcribed kidney RNA. The most abundant sequence
obtained using the ESTa reverse primer was identical to
that of β1tr-1; however a distinct sequence, designated
β1tr-3, was the predominant sequence obtained using the
ESTb reverse primer. All three of these paralogs carried a
stop codon at the same position as that found in the two
ESTs (see Additional file 1), resulting in a truncated translation product terminating four residues after the end of
EGF-4. Hence, these data clearly establish that this group

All the truncated paralogs are closely related to β1–3 (Fig.
5B), with ~80% sequence identity overall. Hence, together
with β1–3 they form a novel group of β1 paralogs. In a
surprising contrast to what is observed regarding sequence

Figure 4
Alignment of zebrafish truncated β1 sequences
Alignment of zebrafish truncated β1 sequences. The alignment was performed using ClustalW. Protein domains are
annotated: PSI, plexin/semaphorin/integrin; EGF, epidermal
growth factor. Yellow bar indicates the position of a putative
flexible linker region in EGF-2 [15]. Domain boundaries in
the EGF repeats are as predicted by Takagi et al. [58]. Based
on this prediction, the truncated β1 sequences contain four
additional residues after the end of EGF-4. The position of an
additional cysteine residue in EGF-4 (not seen in other β subunits) is indicated by tial. Sequence identities are indicated by
*, conservative substitutions by :, semi-conservative substitutions by.

conservation between β1–1 β1–2 and human β1(Fig. 3),
the PSI and hybrid domains are almost perfectly conserved between the truncated paralogs and β1–3, whereas
the A domains are much less well conserved (Fig. 5B). In
addition, the sequence of EGF-1 is highly conserved, and
the first two EGF repeats of β1tr-3 are almost identical in
sequence to those of β1–3 (Fig. 5B). The major region of
sequence variation between the truncated β1 paralogs is
the putative linker sequence in EGF repeat 2 [15], with
some of the paralogs having a six amino acid deletion in
this region (Fig. 4).
The truncated paralogs, like β1–3, have a substitution of
two key aspartate residues by Ser/Asn at the ADMIDAS. In
addition, these paralogs are also lacking an essential
LIMBS residue (E189 in human β1 [E169 in the mature
sequence]) due to a glutamate to arginine substitution. A
similar mutation in human β1 (APM and J. Askari,
unpublished data) or β3 [33] perturbs ligand recognition.
Hence, the A domains of the truncated paralogs may not
be functional for ligand binding, or may possibly bind to
ligands in a different manner to other β subunit A
domains. The MIDAS coordinating residues are conserved
in the truncated paralogs; hence, it remains possible that
they may bind ligands in a manner akin to the A domains
found in some α subunits [6].
Overall, the sequences of the A domains in the truncated
paralogs are highly divergent from other chordate
sequences; indeed, they are only slightly more similar to
human β1 A domain (57–58% identity) than the Ciona
β1 A domain (56% identity). The loops important for ligand binding and association with the α subunit are poorly
conserved. For example, the truncated paralogs all have a
large deletion of nine amino acids in the β B-βC loop. A
second part of the α/β subunit interface involves residues
in the βD-α5 loop, especially those that form a short
stretch of 310 helix (DGKL) [13]. This region is highly conserved between the full-length paralogs and human β1
(Fig. 2) but has several substitutions in the truncated paralogs. Taken together, these findings suggest that the truncated β1 paralogs may have weaker associations with α
subunits, associate with different α subunits, or even may
not associate with α subunits at all. However, even if the
truncated paralogs are able to associate with α subunits,
they would form non-signaling receptors, as they lack the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
Genomic and phylogenetic analysis reveals evolutionary
relationships between the β1 paralogs
Gene sequences corresponding to β1–1, β1–2 and β1–3
can be identified in the zebrafish genome (Table 2)
(although there are a number of inaccuracies and gaps in
the GENESCAN ab initio gene predictions). Currently, the
gene for only one truncated paralog can be identified from

the latest genome sequence (Zv6), corresponding almost
exactly to ESTb (Table 2). β1–2, 'ESTb' and β1–3
sequences lie adjacent to one another in a tandem array
on chromosome 2; β1–1 lies in a separate region of the
genome (chromosome 24). The genomic sequences show
almost perfect conservation of exon- intron boundaries
(data not shown), suggesting that all the β1 paralogs arose
from duplication of a single ancestral β1 gene.
For phylogenetic analysis, the six zebrafish β1 sequences
and two EST sequences were aligned with human β1 (see
Fig. 2 and Additional file 2). The Ciona β1 sequence is
ancestral to β1/β2/β7 [8] and is used as an outgroup for
the phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogenetic
analysis is presented in Fig. 6 in the form of a maximum
likelihood (ML) tree with supporting data from 1,000
neighbor-joining bootstrap replicates, 1,000 maximum
parsimony bootstrap replicates and Bayesian clade credibility values. The phylogeny suggests that: (i) the zebrafish
β1 paralogs are all derived from a single ancestral β1 gene
present in the last common ancestor of zebrafish and
tetrapods, (ii) the duplication that gave rise to β1–1 and
β1–2 occurred after the divergence of the tetrapod and teleost lineages, (iii) a subsequent duplication gave rise to

the ancestor of the divergent paralogs, (iv) this ancestral
divergent paralog then duplicated, giving rise to β1–3 and
the ancestor of the truncated paralogs, (v) a very recent
tandem duplication of the ancestral truncated paralog has
taken place. The branching order of the truncated paralogs
has low statistical support, indicative of the high sequence
similarity. However, the statistical analysis suggests that
ESTb, β1tr-1 and β1tr-2 are more closely related to each
other than to ESTa and β1tr-3, and probably arose more
recently.
The ML tree was supported by maximum parsimony and
Bayesian analyses. Only neighbor joining analysis (not
shown) produced two vertebrate clades where β1–1, β1–
2 and human β1 grouped separately to the other
sequences. However, the genomic locations of the different paralogs add support to the ML analysis. For example,
the position of β1–2 and β1–3 in close proximity on the
same scaffold suggests that β1–2 and β1–3 arose from a
tandem duplication of a common ancestor. The presence
of a truncated paralog in the same region of the genome
adds weight to the proposal (supported by all the phylogenetic analyses) that the ancestor of the truncated paralogs arose from a duplication of the precursor of β1–3.

The divergent β1 paralogs are expressed later in
development than β1–1 and β1–2
We examined the expression of the different β1 paralogs
at different times of development using RT-PCR with
primers specific for each paralog (Fig. 7). The results
showed that both β1–1 and β1–2 were expressed throughout development. The expression of β1–2 appeared to
peak at around 14 hours post fertilization (hpf) and
declined thereafter. In contrast, the expression of β1–1
appeared to be highest at later stages of development (48
hpf onwards). The more divergent β1 paralog β1–3 was
not found to be expressed during early development; β1–
3 message was first detected at 14 hpf and expression
strongly increased at later stages of development. The

truncated paralogs β1tr-1 and β1tr-2 were also expressed
only at later stages of development, with message first
detected at 24 hpf. In contrast, β1tr-3 was expressed
throughout development.
The divergent β1 paralogs are expressed less widely than
β1–1 and β1–2
The expression of the different β1 paralogs in adult tissues
was also examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 8). The results showed
that β1–1 and β1–2 were expressed in all tissues, although
the expression of β1–1 in intestine was low, whereas β1–
2 was highly expressed in this tissue. Expression of β1–3
was widespread, but tissues such as muscle and brain
showed only low expression. The truncated paralogs β1tr1 and β1tr-2 were only expressed in a limited number of
tissues, with expression being particularly strong in liver.
In contrast to the tissue-restricted expression of β1tr-1 and
β1tr-2, β1tr-3 was found to be expressed in all tissues.

EST sequences corresponding to the different β1 paralogs
can be identified in the NCBI databases (Table 2). The
majority of these EST sequences correspond to those of
truncated paralogs. Although no EST sequences that
exactly matched β1tr-1 or β1tr-2 were found, ESTs corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of β1tr-3 could be identified (Table 2). (Conversely, although there are many

additional EST sequences that correspond exactly with
ESTa (Table 2), we did not amplify any precisely matching
sequences from zebrafish embryos.) EST sequences also
provide evidence concerning the expression of the different β1 paralogs in different tissues or at different stages of
development (Table 2). ESTs for the truncated paralogs
(especially ESTs corresponding to ESTa) are found in
cDNA from several different tissues, and appear to be particularly abundant in liver and kidney.

Discussion
The novel findings of this report are: (i) Extensive expansion of the β1 integrin gene family has taken place in
zebrafish, (ii) a group of divergent β1 paralogs with regulatory site mutations is present, some of which are novel
truncated forms that lack the transmembrane and intracellular domains, (iii) the different β1 paralogs exhibit varied patterns of temporal and tissue expression. Our
findings raise several important questions. For example:
Why do zebrafish have multiple versions of the single β1
gene found in higher vertebrates? What is the function of
the divergent paralogs? Which α subunits does each paralog pair with?

Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the generation of phenotypic complexity, diversity and innovation. Gene duplication can occur either through tandem
duplication of an individual gene, segmental duplication
of a portion of a chromosome, or through whole genome
duplication. Recent analyses have provided strong support for a whole genome duplication in the lineage of rayfinned fishes approx. 350 million years ago [34-36]. Following this duplication, most of the gene duplicates were
rapidly lost. However, a small proportion of these duplicates were retained. Hence, for approximately 20% of single-copy human genes, two corresponding orthologs are
found in zebrafish [37]. It is possible that β1–1 and β1–2
arose from the fish-specific whole genome duplication.
Consistent with this possibility, β1–1 and β1–2 have different chromosomal locations and furthermore, both
gene loci show synteny with the p11.22 region of human
chromosome 10, which contains the β1 (ITGB1) gene
(APM, unpublished data). Two co-orthologs of β1 are also
found in other teleost species such as fugu [38].
In the classical model of gene duplication [39], new gene
duplicates face one of two fates: either one copy mutates
to a pseudogene (called nonfunctionalization), or one
copy preserves the original function, and the other copy
mutates freely until by chance it obtains a sequence that
confers a new, beneficial, positively selected function
(called neofunctionalization). In a third possibility, called
subfunctionalization or subfunction partitioning, the
complementary partitioning of ancestral subfunctions is
the mechanism that preserves gene duplicates [37]. Two
classic examples of subfunction partitioning in zebrafish
are the pair of sox9 genes, sox9a and sox9b [40], and the
two mitf genes, mitfa and mitfb [41]. It is possible that
ancestral β1 integrin functions have been partitioned
between β1–1 and β1–2. Subfunction partitioning can
occur through tissue-specific expression of gene duplicates and/or expression at different times of development.
We found that there are differences in temporal expression of β1–1 and β1–2, with the expression of β1–2 peaking in early development, whereas expression of β1–1 was
highest during later development. Also some differences
in the tissue expression between these two paralogs were
noted, with low expression of β1–1 in adult intestine. It is
also possible that partitioning could take place if each β
chain associates with a distinct subset of α chain partners.
The possible subfunction partitioning of β1 roles by β1–1
and β1–2 may provide distinct advantages for functional
genetic analyses in zebrafish. Whereas knockout of the
single β1 gene in mice is very early embryonic lethal
[9,10], knockout (or knockdown) of only one of these
genes in zebrafish may have a much less severe phenotype, making it possible to study the roles of β1 integrins
during the later stages of development.

In contrast to β1–1 and β1–2, it seems likely that the
divergent β1 paralogs arose through tandem duplications.
Taking the genomic, phylogenetic and sequence identity
data together, the most likely scenario is that the precursor
of β1–2 underwent a tandem duplication that gave rise to
the ancestor of β1–3; a subsequent duplication of this paralog gave rise to the progenitor of the truncated paralogs.
It seems likely that the divergent paralogs have acquired
novel functions. With the exception of β1tr-3, these paralogs are expressed at later times of development and in a
more tissue-restricted manner than β1–1 and β1–2. It
therefore appears that the divergent paralogs may be
involved in tissue differentiation, maintenance or remodelling, rather than in development/organogenesis. The
expression of many of these paralogs in tissues such as
liver and kidney supports this view.
One clue to the function of the divergent paralogs is that
they possess a double substitution (DD to SN) in the regulatory ADMIDAS cation-binding site in the A-domain.
Preliminary results suggest that engineering an identical
substitution in human β1 (in a heterodimer with α5 subunit) produces a constitutively inactive integrin, i.e., an
integrin with very low affinity for ligand (J. Askari and A.P.
Mould, unpublished data). It is therefore possible that
β1–3 could act as a dominant-negative β1 subunit by
competing with β1–1 and β1–2 for α subunit partners or
intracellular binding factors. It is also proposed that
expression of high levels of unoccupied integrins can trigger apoptosis [42]; hence, expression of β1-3 could also
regulate cell survival. If the truncated paralogs are unable
to associate with α subunits they could be secreted into
the extracellular environment. There are now many examples of cell surface receptors that also have a secreted
antagonistic counterpart, e.g. VEGFR, FGFR-1 and IL-1R
[43-45]. It is therefore intriguing to speculate that truncated integrin paralogs could have a similar mode of
action.
It is also possible that the divergent paralogs could have
acquired new binding partners. The very high degree of
sequence conservation of the PSI, hybrid domain and
EGF-1 between the divergent paralogs suggest that these
domains form a key functional region of these polypeptides, and furthermore that the function of these domains
is common to all the divergent β1 paralogs. Such a degree
of conservation suggests that these domains interact with
protein ligands (even though there is currently no evidence in other integrins that these domains have extracellular ligands). The PSI, hybrid, and EGF-1 domains lie
adjacent to each other at, or close to, the knee region of
the integrin [15]. Proteins that bind to these domains
could therefore alter function, either by constraining the
integrin in a bent (low affinity) form or by perturbing the
interactions between PSI/hybrid/EGF-1 domains and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/24

other integrin domains, thereby favouring the unbent
(high affinity) form. A key hinge point in the β subunit
knee region is thought to be the near the start of EGF-2
[15]. Interestingly, some of the truncated paralogs have a
six amino acid deletion in this linker region (Fig. 4),
which is likely to change the conformational state of the
protein, and may therefore modify function. Intriguingly,
the second EGF repeat in β1tr-3 is essentially identical to
that of β1–3, implying that this repeat may also have a
conserved role between these two paralogs.
It is currently unclear how many separate genes are represented by the truncated β1 paralogs and ESTs. Although
the sequences β1tr-1 and β1tr-2 are 98% identical to each
other they are probably distinct gene products because
they have different 3'UTRs. In addition, although β1tr-2
and β1tr-3 may have identical 3'UTR sequences, it appears
unlikely that β1tr-3 is an alternatively spliced form of
β1tr-2 because the differences between the two coding
sequences are spread throughout the primary structures
(Fig. 4 and Additional file 1). Additionally, the truncated
paralogs cannot simply represent different alleles of the
same gene because at least three of these paralogs could be
amplified from RNA derived from a single fish (APM and
Paul Walker, unpublished results). Furthermore, the
genomic sequence that corresponds to ESTb (which is
98% identical in coding sequence to β1tr-2) does not contain sequences that would allow the generation of different transcripts by alternative splicing (data not shown). In
summary, the currently available evidence suggests that
the truncated paralogs originate from separate (yet to be
characterised) genes. Since the genomic scaffold is assembled from shotgun sequences it is possible that, due to the
almost identical sequences of the truncated paralogs, the
scaffold is incorrectly assembled and additional genes of
truncated paralogs may be present in the same region. In
the future, the availability of finished clones in the region
of the genome that contains 'ESTb' for detailed analysis
should help to clarify the precise number of truncated β1
paralogs in the zebrafish genome. A further puzzle is why
none of the truncated β1 sequences we amplified from
zebrafish RNA exactly matched the ESTa or ESTb
sequences. A possible explanation is that the β1tr-1, β1tr2 and β1tr-3 sequences were only the predominant
sequences obtained by subcloning of the RT-PCR products. Other clones obtained have not yet been fully
sequenced, some of these may match the EST sequences
more precisely.
Truncated forms of β subunits have previously been
reported in sponge and man [7,46]. However, these
polypeptides represent alternatively spliced forms of fulllength β subunits that are truncated within the hybrid
domain, and therefore probably result in non-functional
proteins [47]. In contrast, the truncated β1 paralogs

Page 11 of 15

BMC Cell Biology 2006, 7:24

reported here appear to be unique gene products, and the
position of the truncation would preserve the structure
and function of all of the extracellular domains with the
exception of the βTD.
A key subject of future investigations will be to identify
the α subunit partners of the different paralogs. All twelve
α chains that pair with β1 in higher vertebrates have
orthologs in the zebrafish genome, and at least two of
these α chains have two co-orthologs (APM, unpublished
results). It seems very unlikely that all of the β1 paralogs
identified here are able to associate with all of the >14
potential α chain partners. For example, if each of the six
β1 paralogs has retained the ability to pair with all of the
α chains then a minimum of 84 different heterodimers
could form. This would present a huge increase in complexity over the twelve heterodimers found in higher vertebrates. It is likely, therefore that in this process of
multimeric protein evolution, previously termed 'molecular incest' [48], that only a limited number of possible
combinations was retained based on function.
It is not yet clear if divergent β1 paralogs are found in
other teleosts. Currently only limited gene information is
available on other fish species, with the exception of the
pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis.
Analysis of the pufferfish genomes suggests that only two
β1 paralogs are present in fugu and tetraodon; these paralogs are closely related to zebrafish β1–1 and β1–2 (AP
Mould, unpublished results). However, since β1–3 probably arose from an ancient duplication of the ancestor of
β1–2 it would be surprising if the former paralog was
retained only in the zebrafish lineage. Furthermore,
although the divergent β1 paralogs have not been
detected in pufferfish genomes, pufferfish may have
retained fewer gene duplicates than zebrafish [49].
The presence of expanded gene families is hypothesized to
have made a major contribution to the extraordinary
diversity and evolutionary success of teleosts, which make
up half of all vertebrate species. It is known that fish
genomes are more 'plastic' than other vertebrate genomes,
partly due to higher rates of gene duplication [50]. Fishspecific novel members of gene families may contribute to
a large extent to the distinct physiology of fishes and
mammals, while differential retention of duplicate genes
may have facilitated the isolation of emerging species during the vast radiation of teleosts [51,52]. Our findings
show that integrins are a dynamic family of genes that
have evolved in multiple ways after the divergence of the
common ancestors of the mammalian and fish lineages.
Expansion of the integrin family may also correlate with
expansion of extracellular matrix gene families, e.g. collagens, in teleosts [34].

Conclusion

At least six paralogs of the integrin β1 gene have been
identified in zebrafish, demonstrating that this species has
a greatly expanded integrin repertoire. Two of these paralogs may share the functions of the single β1 subunit
found in higher vertebrates, whereas the remaining paralogs may have acquired novel roles. This is the first
description of truncated β1 chains, which we speculate
could be secreted proteins that act as regulators of integrin
functions.

Methods

Sequencing of zebrafish integrin β1 paralogs
The complete amino acid sequence of human β1 [SwissProt: P05556] was used to probe the Danio rerio genome
([59,61]) using TBLASTN [53] to identify genes with highest sequence identity to human β1. To amplify complete
β1 sequences, primers were designed using putative 5' and
3' sequences (identified as described above) or from EST
sequences on the NCBI database [60]. The following
primers were used: β1–1, 5'-ATGGACCTGAAGCTACTTTTCATATC-3' and 5'-CTGATGGCCATTATTTGCCTTCG-3',
β1–2,
5'-ATGGACGTAAGGCTGCTCCTG-3'and
5'CACGTTCGTCCATTATTTGCCCTC-3',
β1–3,
5'ATGAAAATGAAGCTGCTGTTATTATC-3' and 5'-CACTTTCCCTCATATCTGGGATTC-3'
β1tr-1,

and
5'ATGTATAACATGAGGTCATGATGTAC-3'
β1tr-2
5'ATGGATATAACAGTTTTGTTATTATCAG-3'
and
5'GTATAACATGTGTCTCAATATATGATG-3'

Total RNA was prepared from 4-day old embryos using
TRI reagent (Sigma), and reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were performed using Phusion (New England Biolabs). Cycling
parameters were 98°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of
98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 60 s. An additional sequence, β1tr-3, was amplified from reverse transcribed RNA from adult kidney (prepared as described
below) using the same primers as for β1tr-2. The PCR
reactions generated products of ~2.4 kB for β1–1, β1–2
and β1–3, and ~1.9 kB for β1tr-1, β1tr-2 and β1tr-3. EST
clones ESTa and ESTb were obtained from RZPD German

contained a mixture of sequences and therefore these
products were subcloned into the Zero Blunt TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of individual clones
revealed a single most abundant sequence (β1tr-1, β1tr-2
or β1tr-3). Alignment of zebrafish and human sequences
was performed using CLUSTAL W [62].

identity of selected products was confirmed by DNA
sequencing. As a control, a fragment of β-actin was amplified using the primers 5'-CCACGAGACCACCTTCAACT-3'
and 5'-CATTGTGAGGAGGGCAAAGT-3' for 28 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 40 s and 72°C for 60 s. Negative
controls consisted of no cDNA template reactions.

Phylogenetic analysis
The β1 integrin sequences identified in Danio rerio were
aligned with the human β1 sequence [Swiss-Prot:
P05556] and the ancestral β1-like gene previously identified in Ciona intestinalis (JGI Ciona v1.0 ci0100141446)
[8] using CLUSTAL X [54]. Gap-containing sites were
removed from each alignment and Maximum Likelihood
trees were inferred using PROML from the PHYLIP package [55]. The JTT model of amino acid substitutions was
used with and without global rearrangements and correction for rate heterogeneity (α value obtained from TREEPUZZLE [56]). The topologies of the trees were tested using
three independent methods. Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Parsimony bootstrap replicates were obtained using
the PHYLIP package [55]. Bayesian tree inference values
were produced from the MrBayes programme [57].

RT-PCR analysis
Embryos were harvested at different times post fertilization. Tissues from adult fish (~9 months old) were
removed by dissection and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (QIAGEN). Reverse
transcription was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase or Omniscript (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were performed using recombinant Taq (a gift from P. Walker,
University of Manchester, UK) or Advantage 2 polymerase
(BD Biosciences). For the truncated β1 sequences, primers
were designed to give a single product of approx. 600 bp
that is unique to β1tr-1, β1tr-2 or β1tr-3. The following
primers were used:
