Assessment of a novel multiplex real-time PCR
assay for the detection of the CBPP agent
Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC
through experimental infection in cattle

Abstract
Background: Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC is the pathogenic agent of contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP), the most important disease of cattle in Africa causing significant economic losses. The reemergence of CBPP in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s illustrates that it is still a threat also to countries that have
successfully eradicated the disease in the past. Nowadays, probe-based real-time PCR techniques are among the
most advanced tools for a reliable identification and a sensitive detection of many pathogens, but only few
protocols have been published so far for CBPP diagnosis. Therefore we developed a novel TaqMan®-based realtime PCR assay comprising the amplification of two independent targets (MSC_0136 and MSC_1046) and an
internal exogenous amplification control in a multiplex reaction and evaluated its diagnostic performance with
clinical samples.
Results: The assays detected 49 MmmSC strains from diverse temporal and geographical origin, but did not
amplify DNA from 82 isolates of 20 non-target species confirming a specificity of 100%. The detection limit was
determined to be 10 fg DNA per reaction for the MSC_0136 assay and 100 fg per reaction for the MSC_1046 assay
corresponding to 8 and 80 genome equivalents, respectively. The diagnostic performance of the assay was
evaluated with clinical samples from 19 experimentally infected cattle and from 20 cattle without CBPP and
compared to those of cultivation and a conventional PCR protocol. The two rt-PCR tests proved to be the most
sensitive methods and identified all 19 infected animals. The different sample types used were not equally suitable
for MmmSC detection. While 94.7% of lung samples from the infected cohort were positively tested in the
MSC_0136 assay, only 81% of pulmonal lymph nodes, 31% of mediastinal lymph nodes and 25% of pleural fluid
samples gave a positive result.
Conclusions: The developed multiplex rt-PCR assay is recommended as an efficient tool for rapid confirmation of
a presumptive CBPP diagnosis in a well-equipped laboratory environment.

Background
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) caused by
Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (MmmSC) is
a disease of cattle affecting the respiratory tract of animals. It is manifested by fever, anorexia, cough, and dyspnoea. Macropathological examinations show gross

lesions in the lung including marbling, thickened interlobular septa and sequestra. However, clinical and
pathological signs are not always evident, and chronically infected animals might act as carriers and source
of infections. Today the disease is mainly confined to
sub-Saharan Africa where it causes severe economic
losses. As a result of rigid control measures and a consequent stamping out policy, Europe has been CBPP
free since the late 1990s. Even so, the risk of re-introducing CBPP remains high. In case of a CBPP outbreak in
non-endemic regions caused by animals with inapparent

infection or by re- introduction, rapid action such as
setting up exclusion zones and culling of affected live
stock is essential to efficiently prevent transmission and
spread of disease. All these measures depend on an
early identification of the pathogen. Two serological
tests, the complement fixation test (CFT) and a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA), are
approved by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) [1], but they are recommended at herd level only
[2-5]. Traditionally, mycoplasmas including MmmSC are
isolated by culture and identified by biochemical and
antigenic techniques [6-8]. Drawbacks of these methods
include low sensitivity caused by bacterial contamination, low specificity due to cross-reactivity of antigenic
determinants of closely related species and time- and
labour-intensive laboratory procedures. Considerable
improvements have been achieved by the introduction
of PCR since 1994 [2,9,10] which provides a much
quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of CBPP. However,
due to the close phylogenetic relatedness among
MmmSC and other members of the M. mycoides cluster
including M. mycoides subsp. capri, M. capricolum
subsp. capricolum, M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae and M. leachii, identification by conventional PCR
protocols remains problematic [7]. Real time PCR (rtPCR) formats using SYBR green detection of PCR products compensated some of the disadvantages connected
to conventional PCR [11,12], but are less specific than
real-time PCR assays that include specific probes
[13,14].
In this study, we developed a new multiplex rt-PCR
assay using TaqMan ® -labelled locked nucleic acid
(LNA) probes for the detection of MmmSC and validated it using samples from experimentally infected
Boran cattle taken at necropsy. The assay specifically
targets the gene lppQ (MSC_1046) and a gene encoding
an uncharacterized lipoprotein (MSC_0136) close to the
fba locus, and it includes an internal amplification control. The new protocol is intended for confirmatory
diagnosis of clinically or pathologically suspected cases
and is considered to contribute to further improvement
of CBPP control in routine laboratory diagnosis.

Methods
Bacterial strains

The specificity of the assay was verified by testing DNA
from 48 MmmSC field strains, from 46 other type and
field strains of the M. mycoides cluster to exclude potential cross-reactivity due to close phylogenetic relatedness
and from 36 isolates of 14 other relevant mollicute species occurring in cattle (Table 1). All mycoplasma
strains were recovered from lyophilized stocks and cultivated in modified Hayflick medium [15] containing 20%
horse serum at 37°C for 2-6 days. DNA extracts from

Page 2 of 12

the non-related bacterial pathogens Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica, that cause respiratory diseases in cattle, were also included in the
specificity testing (Table 1). 10 ng of genomic DNA
extracted from bacterial cultures were used in the specificity tests.
Clinical samples

Tissue samples from an animal infection trial performed
according to the Kenyan national legislation for animal
experimentation and approved by the ILRI Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC reference
number 2008.08) were obtained from the International
Livestock Research Institute Nairobi, Kenya [16].
Twenty 14-16 months old castrated outbred Boran cattle (Bos indicus) were infected intratracheally with 5 ×
1010 cfu of the strain MmmSC Afade in 50 ml culture
broth. Six days post infection nine animals were
depleted for CD4+ T lymphocytes using repeated injections of CD4-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. The
CD4+ T cell depletion had no discernable effect on the
infection status, clinical presentation, pathology or
humoral response of the animals [16]. Out of the 20
infected cattle, 19 were available for sampling. Three of
them (animals no. BD097, BD098, BD118) showed acute
CBPP-typical clinical signs such as coughing, dyspnea
and fever (> 39.4°C) for at least eight consecutive days.
Because of the severity of the disease, these animals had
to be euthanized 16 to 21 days post infection. Out of
the 16 surviving animals, 13 showed clinical signs, and
three animals (no. BD096, BD100, BD111) were asymptomatic. All were euthanized 28-30 days post infection.
Post mortem examination of lung tissue revealed typical pathological signs of pneumonia and respiratory disorder in all but one (no. BD102) individuals. Gross
lesions of red hepatisation and marmorisation, necrosis
and sequestra were seen in animals no. BD097, BD098
and BD118, whereas fibrous adhesions between pleura
and chest wall and the production of massive amounts
of pleural fluid (a typical symptom of acute CBPP) were
only observed in animals no. BD097 and BD118. All
other animals, with the exception of no. BD102, developed necrotic lesions, sequestra and areas of resolution
of differing sizes. Their low morbidity together with the
appearance of lung lesions indicated that these animals
were in the chronic stage of infection. Despite the artificial infection and the constant contact with its infected
companions, animal no. BD102 did not show any pathological changes in the lung, and also clinical signs were
mild. All animals showed a specific antibody response
detected by the complement fixation test (CFT) (data
not shown). According to the case definition for CBPP
given by the OIE [17], 18 animals are defined as
MmmSC-positive and animal no. BD102 as MmmSC-

negative. But since animal no. BD102 had MmmSC specific antibodies and mild clinical symptoms (fever) it
was also included in the positive group.
Specimens of lungs and lymph nodes as well as pleural
fluid were collected, immediately frozen at -80°C and
used for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR.
Re-isolation of MmmSC was done by inoculation of
50-100 mg smashed tissue or 300 μl pleural fluid into 3
ml modified Hayflick broth containing 20% horse serum
and 1000 IU/ml penicillin for 3-5 days. Subsequently, an
aliquot was plated onto a modified Hayflick agar plate
without penicillin to control for growth of mycoplasma
colonies. Sub-cultures were grown in 3 ml of modified
Hayflick broth without penicillin to identify the re-isolated species. DNA was extracted and conventional
MmmSC-specific PCR was performed as described
below.
20 negative control samples from cattle flocks in Germany (which is CBPP-free) were included in the analysis. Lothar Hoffmann (TLLV Bad Langensalza,
Germany) kindly provided lung samples of cattle diagnosed with pneumonia (n = 3). Bovine lung samples
from an experimental chlamydia infection (approved by
the Thuringian State Office for Food Safety and Consumer Protection under registration no. 04-002/07) causing pneumonia in cattle (n = 8) and lung samples from
uninfected animals (n = 9) were obtained from the animal facilities of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute.
DNA extraction

Cells from 3 ml broth cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS, and DNA was extracted
using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit™
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extraction from
animal tissue was performed following the protocol of
the innuSPEED Tissue DNA Kit™ (Analytik Jena, Jena,
Germany) and DNA was eluted with 100 μl of buffer.
Confirmation of strain identity

All strains presumably belonging to the M. mycoides
cluster were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a 992 bp fragment of uvrC.
M. mycoides cluster strains other than MmmSC were
additionally analyzed by amplification and sequencing of
fragments of rpoB. Universal primers uvrC-F1 5’-

GATCTATTTTATTAACACTACAACG-3’ and uvrC-R2
5’-TCTTTAGCTGCATGAATTTG and universal rpoBspecific primers as described by Manso-Silvan et al. and
Vilei et al. [18,19] were used at a concentration of 400
nM in a 25 ul PCR reaction volume with 1.5 mM MgCl2,
250 μM each dNTP, reaction buffer and 1 U InnuTaq
Hot A DNA Polymerase (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany).
The temperature-time profile on a UNO II thermocycler
(Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) was 95°C for 5 min and
35 times 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30s and 72°C for 60 s.
Amplicons were purified by the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and subsequently sequenced by Eurofins MWG Operon
(Ebersberg, Germany) using the respective forward primers. Sequences were edited by the software BioEdit™
version 7.0.9 and aligned and compared to reference
sequences by the software tool Multalin™ [20].
The field strains of other mycoplasma species of
bovine origin investigated in this study were isolated in
our lab over the last decades and identified by an inhouse indirect immunofluorescence test according to
Rosendal and Black, [8].
Conventional MmmSC-specific PCR

Conventional PCR [10] was done on dilution series of
quantified DNA from cultures and DNA extracted from
clinical specimens using the primer pair SC3NEST1-L/
SC3NEST1-R and Taq DNA Polymerase 5 Prime (VWR
International, Darmstadt, Germany) on a UNO II thermocycler. 5 μl of each PCR product were analyzed by
gelelectrophoresis and visualised by ethidiumbromide
staining.
Oligonucleotide Primers and TaqMan® probes

MmmSC-specific primers and probes were designed
using the software tool IDT OligoAnalyzer3.1 based on
sequence comparisons between the respective genes of
MmmSC field strains and type and field strains of the
M. mycoides cluster performed by the software tool
Multalin™ [20].
Locked nucleic acid (LNA)-containing dual-labelled
probes, designed in cooperation with and produced by
TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany), were applied to compensate the low GC-content of mycoplasma DNA and
to ensure specific and sensitive probe hybridization
despite the low Tm values of probe sequences.

The primers MSC_1046-S and MSC_1046-R2
obtained from MWG Operon (Ebersbach, Germany)
(Table 2) target the gene of a well-characterized antigenic and specific MmmSC lipoprotein [21]. This gene
occurs in two copies in type strain PG1, but only in one
copy in many other MmmSC strains [22]. The respective
probe MSC_1046-TM1 was designed to anneal to a
highly MmmSC-specific segment exhibiting ten nucleotide mismatches to the homologous sequences from M.
mycoides subsp. capri (GenBank accession number
FQ377874) and M. leachii (CP002108).
Primers MSC_0136-F and MSC_0136-R mediate the
amplification of the target MSC_0136, which codes for a
hypothetical transmembrane protein and is located
directly adjacent upstream of the fba locus [23]. The
PG1 genome also harbours a second copy of the gene in
reverse orientation [24]. Amplification products were
detected by hybridization and hydrolysis of probe
MSC_0136-TM which was designed with at least 3 mismatches to sequences from other members of the M.
mycoides cluster.
Internal amplification control

A 712 bp fragment of the enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) gene was used as internal amplification
control (IAC) template as described previously [25]
which is also commercially available as Intype IC-DNA
(Labor Diagnostik, Leipzig, Germany). A 177 bp amplicon was generated by amplification with primers EGFP1F and EGFP-10R and detected by probe EGFP-HEX to
demonstrate the absence of PCR inhibitory substances.
Multiplex real-time PCR

Amplifications were performed as duplex assays
(MSC_0136 and MSC_1046 assay) with culture material
and as triplex assays including also the IAC with tissue
samples. The assays were run on a Mx3000P® thermocycler (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) using the

following cycling parameters: initial denaturation at 95°
C for 5 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20 s,
primer annealing at 57°C for 45 s and extension at 68°C
for 45 S. Optimal primer and probe concentrations were
determined by empirical testing of different concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 800 nM final concentration. Finally, each 25 μl duplex reaction contained 12.5
μl 2 × QuantiTect® Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), 400 nM each of primers MSC_1046S, MSC_1046-R2, MSC_0136-F and MSC_0136-R, 300
nM each of probes MSC_1046-TM1 and MSC_0136TM and 1 μl of DNA template. Additionally, 800 nM of
the EGFP-specific primers and 400 nM of probe EGFPHEX as well as 0.25 μl IAC template DNA corresponding to 12,500 copies were added to reactions in the triplex assay.
Amplified products were analyzed using the Stratagene software MxPro™, and amplification plots were
generated with an adaptive baseline. The threshold, i.e.
the level of fluorescence signal that reflects a significant
increase over the baseline signal, was manually adjusted
at 0.2 for the MSC_0136 assay and at 0.15 for the
MSC_1046 assay. The threshold cycles were calculated
accordingly by the instrument.
Each sample was analysed by rt-PCR in duplicate.
Each microtitre plate included a serial dilution of quantified standard DNA containing 10 fg to 10 ng.
Standard curve calculation

Standard curves were generated from duplicates of five

To investigate the correlation between counts of colony
forming units (cfu) and extracted DNA and to define an
adequate reference value for pathogen quantification, a
growth curve of MmmSC PG1 was recorded. Cfu counts
and the respective quantities of total DNA determined
using the newly developed rt-PCR assay were compared
at different time points. Two-day cultures of MmmSC
were diluted 1:100 into fresh liquid medium and incubated at 37°C. Every 6 to 12 h up to 48 h, 100 μl aliquots were removed, tenfold serial dilutions were
prepared and 20 μl of each dilution were seeded on agar
plates for counting cfus after incubation of the plates for
3 days. The doubling time of the strain was calculated
during the logarithmic growth phase with Doubling
Time Software v1.0.10 (Roth, 2006, http://www.doubling-time.com/compute.php).
Furthermore, aliquots were taken after 12, 18, 24 and
48 h of growth from which tenfold dilution series were
prepared. DNA was extracted from 200 μl of each dilution sample as described above and quantified in duplex
rt-PCR assays. Results were compared with standard
curves obtained from tenfold serial dilutions of quantified MmmSC DNA. The calculated genome equivalents
of the 10-1 dilution samples at the time points 12, 18, 24
and 48 h were related to the respective cfu counts.

Figure 1 Real-time quantification of DNA extracted from

spectrophotometrically and adjusted to 100 ng μl-1. Five tenfold
dilution series were prepared and applied in duplex rt-PCR assays
comprising the amplification and detection of the targets
MSC_0136 (A) and MSC_1046 (B) with the TaqMan® LNA probes
FAM-MSC_1046 and Cy5-MSC_0136, respectively. The detection
limits are 10 fg DNA and 100 fg DNA corresponding to
approximately 8 genome equivalents and 80 genome equivalents
for the MSC_0136 and MSC_1046 assay, respectively.

Specificity testing

In order to determine the ability of the MSC_1046 and
MSC_0136 assays to detect MmmSC DNA, genomic
DNA extracts of the type strain PG1 and of 48 MmmSC
field strains were subjected to the duplex rt-PCR. All
isolates were readily detected by both assays.
All non-MmmSC strains belonging to the M. mycoides
cluster (46 strains) and 36 isolates of 16 other mollicute
and bacterial species yielded a signal below a Ct value of
39 in any of the two amplification reactions. The results
are summarized in Table 1 and confirm an analytical
specificity of the developed duplex rt-PCR of 100%.
Detection limit and standard curves of MSC_1046 and
MSC_0136 assay

Five tenfold serial dilutions of genomic DNA covering a
range from 1 fg to 100 ng were analysed in duplex assay
to calculate detection limits (LOD) and standard curves
for MSC_1046 and MSC_0136 amplifications (Figure 1).
The LOD giving a reproducible signal (10 out of 10)
was determined to be 10 fg DNA per reaction for the
MSC_0136 assay and 100 fg per reaction for the
MSC_1046 assay corresponding to 8 and 80 genome

equivalents, respectively, based on the size of the published MmmSC genome sequence [24]. Conventional
PCR performed with the same dilution series exhibited a
detection limit of 1 pg, corresponding to 800 genome
equivalents and thus, proved to be less sensitive by an
order of 1-2 log units.
While the standard curve of the MSC_1046 reaction is
linear over a range of 7 log units (from 100 fg to 100
ng), as illustrated by a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of
0.9999, the standard curve of the MSC_0136 reaction
shows linearity over a range of 6 log units (from 1 pg to
100 ng) only and has a lower R2 value of 0.9958 for the
entire detectable dilution range of 8 log units. The efficiency of amplification calculated from standard curve
slopes was determined by the instruments software to
be 109.6% for MSC_0136 and 98.2% for MSC_1046.
Intra-assay variation coefficients varied between 1.1 and
2.6% for MSC_0136 and between 0.7 and 2.3% for
MSC_1046. Inter-assay variation coefficients ranged
from 1.1 to 2.4% for MSC_0136 and from 0.8 to 2.9%
for MSC_1046 indicating a good reproducibility also
between different runs.

When compared to the two simplex reactions, the
duplex format did not shift Ct values and did in particular not compromise the sensitivity of the two assays.
Also the presence of the IAC did not negatively influence the amplification of MmmSC DNA in triplex rtPCR (data not shown).
Growth curve and MmmSC quantification

The growth curve in Figure 2 was obtained for MmmSC
type strain PG1 after colony counting under cultivation
conditions described above. The culture reached the stationary phase after 24 to 36 hours of cultivation. The
doubling time during the logarithmic phase after 18 to
24 hours of cultivation was 188 min which is in the
range reported for MmmSC strains [26]. In parallel, cultures at time points 12, 18, 24 and 48 h were examined
through the quantification of extracted DNA by
MSC_1046 rt-PCR assay. As expected, the total amount
of deduced genome equivalents exceeded the number of
viable mycoplasmas determined by colony counting.
While in the lag phase (12 h) and early logarithmic
phase (18 h), the total amount of DNA expressed in
genome equivalents exceeded the cfu values by a factor
of 8, this factor rose to 13 in the culture after 24 h of
growth and to 23 after 48 h.
Detection of MmmSC in clinical samples

Clinical samples were subjected to the triplex rt-PCR
assay comprising the amplification of the two MmmSCspecific targets MSC_0136 and MSC_1046 and the IAC
template. The IAC template was consistently amplified
in all samples as illustrated by a Ct value of approximately 27 ruling out a PCR inhibition in the sample
preparations.

Lung samples from cattle flocks in Germany with and
without diagnosed pneumonia were used as negative
control samples and examined in the multiplex rt-PCR
and conventional PCR. All negative control samples
yielded negative results as expected.
66 clinical specimens obtained from 19 animals of the
CBPP infection trial were investigated by the multiplex
rt-PCR, conventional PCR and cultivation (Table 3). 19
samples were positive in all tests, whereas 23 samples
yielded negative results in all tests. 30 specimens (45.5%)
were culture positive, but 41 samples (62.1%) were
tested positive with the MSC_0136 assay and 37 samples
(56.1%) with the MSC_1046 assay. 19 samples (28.8%)
gave a positive result with the conventional SC3 PCR.
All infected animals were correctly identified by the
rt-PCR assays if results from different sample types were
considered. Thus, calculation of test sensitivities based
on diagnosis for individual animals resulted in sensitivities of 100% for the MSC_0136 and MSC_1046 rt-PCR,
78.9% for the SC3 PCR and 89.5% for culture (Table 4).
Table 5 presents test specificities and sensitivities
based on data derived from the examination of lung
specimens. No false positive results were obtained in
any test resulting in specificities of 100% for the PCR
assays. The two rt-PCR assays failed to identify one out
of 19 lung samples as MmmSC-positive (sensitivity of
94,7%), but are more sensitive than detection by culture
(84. 2%) and conventional SC3 PCR (78.9%).
A strong difference was observed in rt-PCR test
results obtained from lung samples, lymph nodes and
pleural fluid samples (Table 3). While 94.7% of lung
samples were positively tested in the MSC_0136 assay,
81% of pulmonal lymph nodes, 31% of mediastinal
lymph nodes and 25% of pleural fluid samples gave a
positive result.

Discussion
Sensitive, reliable and time-saving molecular diagnostic
methods are indispensible tools for a successful control
of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. Here, we present the development and preliminary evaluation of a
new TaqMan®-based real-time PCR assay for the detection of the CBPP agent Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
mycoides SC in clinical samples. The assay comprises
the amplification of two independent targets, MSC_1046
and MSC_0136, as well as an internal exogenous amplification control in a multiplex reaction. Nowadays, PCR
is an accepted alternative to time- and labour-intensive
and often insensitive culture-based methods for the
direct detection of MmmSC in infected animals to confirm a presumptive clinical or pathomorphological diagnosis [17]. In general, PCR is known as a sensitive,
specific, straightforward and fast tool for pathogen
detection and several conventional PCR tests have been

proposed to detect MmmSC [2,9,10,27-29]. Despite the
superiority of real time-PCR assays over conventional
PCR and the importance and impact of the disease, only
few rt-PCR protocols have been introduced so far and
none of them was validated on more than five clinical
samples. Gorton et al. [13] published three independent
assays with MGB-TaqMan ® probes with rather low
amplification efficiencies and detection limits of 100 fg
to 1 pg. Higher sensitivities were reached with a SYBR
Green® rt-PCR assay [12], but the lack of specific amplicon detection by a probe might negatively influence the
specificity of the assay. Recently, Vilei and Frey [14]
reported on the development of two assays with

TaqMan® probes intended for the detection of MmmSC
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of cattle and for the discrimination of wild type strains from a mutant vaccine
strain. The assays are based on the gene of the welldescribed antigenic surface lipoprotein LppQ [21,30]
that is also used in the study presented here. However,
in our study, we preferred LNA probes to Minor Grove
Binding (MGB) probes as they were shown to be significantly more sensitive, have a low optimum concentration and low background fluorescence [31] and are also
cheaper. Furthermore, we used a probe binding site

downstream of the sites proposed by Vilei and Frey [14]
which guaranteed a more specific detection due to a
higher number of nucleotide mismatches to the homologous sequences from M. mycoides subsp. capri and M.
leachii. The differentiation between MmmSC and its
close relatives of the M. mycoides cluster is important
and best performed by the use of variable genetic targets
with high discriminatory potential such as MSC_1046
and MSC_0136. In fact, our duplex assay was able to
detect DNA of all of the 48 tested MmmSC strains and
did not cross-react with any non-target strain indicating
excellent specificity. The analytical sensitivity and detection limits of the two single assays were in the range
reported for rt-PCR tests. The lower LOD of the
MSC_0136 assay compared to the MSC_1046 assay was
also reflected in its higher diagnostic sensitivity.
Although both assays are predominantly designed for
qualitative pathogen detection, especially the MSC_1046
assay with a dynamic range of 7 log units may also be a
useful tool for quantitative evaluation of pathogen load.
Standard curve preparation and pathogen quantification
by rt-PCR are often related to cfu counts assuming a
strict correlation between numbers of viable cfu and
extracted DNA [12,14]. We have tested this assumption
and found that the total amount of detected DNA
exceeded the counted cfu already in the lag and early
exponential phase by eight times and that the ratio varies depending on the age of the culture (Figure 2). Thus,
especially for slow growing fastidious organisms such as
mycoplasmas, the use of cfu instead of DNA amount
may lead to an overestimation of sensitivity when assessing analytical test performance since the contribution
of non-viable genome equivalents to total DNA amount
is not considered.
In accordance with recommendations after which the
detection of MmmSC by PCR should be performed by
the amplification of two independent targets [1,7], our
new rt-PCR test was conceived as a multiplex assay
including two targets and an internal control without
loss of sensitivity. The multiplex format is advantageous
over simplex assays as it is particularly economical in
terms of cost of material (mastermix, consumables) and
turnaround time and suitable for small volume samples
and high-throughput.
The clinical usability of a PCR test is not solely dependent on its inherent specificity and sensitivity, but also
influenced by the course and stage of infection, sampling strategy and sample preparation. To evaluate the
ability of the new test to diagnose MmmSC infection in
cattle, different specimens from CBPP infected animals
and from cattle with non-MmmSC related pneumonia
as well as from healthy animals were examined. It was
evident that the extraction procedure efficiently
removed DNA polymerase inhibitors from the tissue

Page 10 of 12

matrices since amplification of the IAC template was
not impaired. However, DNA degradation was observed
in some samples after long-time storage at -20°C possibly due to nucleases remaining in the samples after
DNA preparation. Therefore, an immediate processing
of samples after DNA extraction is advisable.
The rt-PCR assays’ diagnostic specificity proved to be
100%. Diagnostic sensitivities were compared to those of
MmmSC detection by culture and conventional PCR.
The MSC_0136 and MSC_1046 assays were found to be
most sensitive. Concerning the diagnosis for the individual animal, the sensitivity was 100% for both rt-PCR
assays, compared to 89.5% for culture and 78.9% for
SC3 PCR (Table 4). Thus, both rt-PCR assays reliably
identified infected animals provided that different clinical specimens were investigated. If lung samples were
exclusively considered, diagnostic sensitivity was 94.7%
for the two rt-PCR assays, 84.2% for culture and 78.9%
for the conventional PCR test (Table 5). In contrast,
lymph nodes were obviously less appropriate to detect
MmmSC in infected animals. This observation is congruent to findings of a study using tissue samples from
a natural CBPP outbreak in Portugal [32]. As expected,
pathogen detection was more often successful in pulmonal lymph nodes that directly drain the lungs than in
the more distant mediastinal lumph nodes. Pleural fluid
was previously recommended as the sample of choice
for the diagnosis of CBPP [33]. However, it is not always
present in clinical cases of CBPP. We could detect high
titres of MmmSC (Ct values for MSC_0136 below 23
correlating to > 2.3E+08 GE/ml) in the voluminous
pleural fluid samples from the two acutely infected animals no. BD097 and BD118, whereas the other animals
accumulated only tiny amounts of pleural fluid of which
only two tested positive in the rt-PCR assay with Ct
values close to the detection limit (> 36.0). In conclusion, the apparent weak diagnostic performance in the
investigation of single specimens has to be attributed to
the used sample types being not all equally suitable.
Animal no. BD102 did not show any pathological
modifications in the lung, a fact that did not allow targeted sampling. This may explain the negative rt-PCR
result obtained for the animal’s lung sample. However,
MmmSC was detected in lymph node tissue and pleural
fluid of the animal, which underlines the importance of
a diversified sampling procedure, especially in animals
with negative pathology, in order to prevent false negative results [34,35]. The frequently reported cases of
detection of MmmSC by PCR in samples of asymptomatic animals without organic lesions and without successful cultivation ([36,34,32], present study) are not
reflected by the OIE case definition of CBPP. However,
those animals are nevertheless important as carriers and
shedders.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/47

Although the number of samples was limited and far
from satisfying the Principles of Validation of the OIE
Terrestrial Manual [1], the pre-validation of the new rtPCR assay presented here is a first important step in
assessing its diagnostic capabilities. In the future, wellcharacterized field samples from endemic areas are
needed for further validation of the assay according to
OIE guidelines.

Conclusions
1) The developed multiplex rt-PCR is more sensitive than
cultivation and conventional PCR. All infected animals
could be identified, but only a combined analysis of different sample types ensured 100% sensitivity of the test.
2) Lung samples collected from lesions at the interface
between diseased and healthy tissue are most appropriate to detect MmmSC infections and should predominantly be considered in the analysis by rt-PCR.
However, if resources allow, we propose a more comprehensive sampling strategy including also lymph node
tissue and pleural fluid to clarify the infection status of
the animal.
3) In conclusion, we recommend the duplex rt-PCR
assay as an efficient tool for rapid confirmation of a presumptive CBPP diagnosis based on clinical suspicion or
pathological observations especially in a laboratory setting of developed countries and for epidemic surveillance in CBPP-free countries. In the future, the test will
be used in routine diagnosis of CBPP in the German
Reference Laboratory.
