Abstract
Background: The rate of molecular evolution varies widely between proteins, both within and
among lineages. To what extent is this variation influenced by genome-wide, lineage-specific effects?
To answer this question, we assess the rate variation between insect lineages for a large number
of orthologous genes.
Results: When compared to the beetle Tribolium castaneum, we find that the stem lineage of flies
and mosquitoes (Diptera) has experienced on average a 3-fold increase in the rate of evolution.
Pairwise gene comparisons between Drosophila and Tribolium show a high correlation between
evolutionary rates of orthologous proteins.
Conclusion: Gene specific divergence rates remain roughly constant over long evolutionary times,
modulated by genome-wide, lineage-specific effects. Among the insects analysed so far, it appears
that the Tribolium genes show the lowest rates of divergence. This has the practical consequence
that homology searches for human genes yield significantly better matches in Tribolium than in
Drosophila. We therefore suggest that Tribolium is better suited for comparisons between phyla than
the widely employed dipterans.

Background
Understanding the causes of rate variation in protein evolution is central for many fields including molecular evolution, comparative genomics and structural biology. A
widely accepted principle is that more important proteins
evolve more slowly [1]. However, evolutionary rate variation not only exists between different proteins, but also
between lineages [2]. This was already observed in the earliest comparative studies, both within [3-5] and across
animal phyla [6].
Following the initial observation that Drosophilids are
fast evolving [6], it was shown that the rate of synonymous substitutions in Drosophila melanogaster is approxi-

mately two times higher than in rodents and ten times
higher than in primates [7]. However, the estimated acceleration seemed to depend on the types of proteins examined, with another study reporting only a 3-fold difference
between Drosophila and mammalian rates [8]. A study of
the relative rates of ribosomal RNA evolution in insect lineages showed that there was an episodic substitution rate
increase of about 20-fold in the stem lineage of dipterans
[9], suggesting that high evolutionary rates may be characteristic of the whole dipteran order. However, it is currently unclear whether the observed rate accelerations
encompassed the whole nuclear genome, or whether they
were restricted to certain classes of genes.

data from beetle (Tribolium castaneum), fly (Drosophila
melanogaster), mosquito (Anopheles gambiae), aphid
(Acyrthosiphon pisum), and human (Homo sapiens). Concatenation of these orthologous sequences resulted in a
single, well-defined alignment of 64,134 amino acids.
Given the known tree topology in Figure 1[10], branch
lengths were estimated using a maximum likelihood
method [11] (Table 1). The dipteran branches are much
longer than the Tribolium branch, indicating accelerated
evolution in the Diptera. Since their last common ancestor, Drosophila has accumulated 36% (95% CI: 31–42%)
more amino acid substitutions compared to Tribolium,
while the corresponding increase for Anopheles compared
to Tribolium is 23% (95% CI: 18–29%).

In this study, we assess the genome-wide variation of evolutionary rates between insect lineages, by comparing the
beetle Tribolium castaneum, and the dipterans Drosophila
melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. We test (i) whether
there is an acceleration of protein evolution in dipterans
that is observable on a genome-wide scale, (ii) whether
this acceleration is confined to an episodic burst of
changes at the base of the dipteran lineage, and (iii)
whether this acceleration affects all genes to a similar
extent.

Results
Genomic rate estimates confirm an acceleration in
dipterans
To estimate genomic evolutionary rates of insect lineages,
we formed 439 protein clusters derived from cDNA or EST

In order to assign absolute rates of evolution, we combined the sequence distances in Figure 1 with absolute
dates obtained from palaeontological estimates. Based on
the oldest coleopteran fossil [12] and the timing of the
primary radiation of holometabolous insect orders [13],
the divergence of dipterans (Drosophila and Anopheles)
from coleopterans (Tribolium) has been estimated to the
early Permian (the Artinskian; about 284.4-275.6 Mya).
The divergence between the Brachycera (Drosophila) and
the Nematocera (Anopheles) lineages has been estimated
to the Middle Permian (the Anisian; about 245.0-237.0
Mya) [14]. Combining these dates with the maximumlikelihood estimates of branch lengths, we obtained the
absolute evolutionary rates listed in Table 1. This shows
that the 39 My time interval starting with the separation
of coleopterans and dipterans and culminating in the
radiation of Diptera was characterised by an episodic
increase of evolutionary rate, averaging 3.07 times the
mean rate found for the Tribolium lineage (95% CI: 2.39–
4.34).
Deviations from clock-like evolution
The accuracy of absolute rate estimates depends on the
completeness of the known fossil record. Thus, the uncertainty assigned to the dates in Table 1, which reflects the
uncertainty in the dating of the strata where fossils were

found, is an underestimate of the true uncertainty. To confirm that the dipteran rate acceleration is not an artefact of
erroneous palaeontological estimates, we performed
additional analyses that directly compared relative evolutionary rates. To this end, we implemented several models
involving global or local molecular clocks [15]. Because
these models are nested, they can be compared via likelihood-ratio tests [16]. Considering the branch length differences in Table 1, it is not surprising that the model
employed above (without a clock assumption) fits the
data much better than a model with a global clock, which
enforces a constant rate of evolution across all lineages (P
< 10-66, Table 2). Is the clock assumption violated only at
specific (local) branches? Table 1 assigns the strongest rate
acceleration to the base of the Diptera. However, an evolutionary model involving a local clock for this branch
(with all other branches evolving at the same rate) still fits
the data significantly worse than the model without a
clock (P < 10-12, Table 2); the same is indeed true for all
models involving a single local clock (data not shown).
Thus, a burst of accelerated evolution at the base of the
dipterans is not sufficient to explain the rate increase
found for dipterans as a whole.
Further comparison of increasingly complex models of
evolution show that only models involving separate local
clocks for the Tribolium and Drosophila lineages can fit the
data as good as the model without a clock assumption (P
= 0.1, Table 2). All other combinations of local clocks
between the Tribolium, Drosophila and Anopheles lineages
were found to be inferior to the model without the clock
(P < 0.01, Table 2 and data not shown). Thus, although
the accelerated evolution of dipterans was most pronounced during a burst of changes that occurred at the
base of the order (Table 1), a sustained increase is also
detected in the branches separating Drosophila from
Anopheles. Remarkably, the need for a coleopteran local
clock also demonstrates that the Tribolium lineage has gen-

erally evolved much slower than most of the other taxa
considered here.
It should be noted that Table 2 contains multiple statistical comparisons, thereby decreasing the overall specificity
of the statistical test. A conservative strategy to control for
this is to divide the P-value cutoff for significance by the
number of comparisons (Bonferroni-correction), i.e., to
use P0 = 0.05/8 = 0.0063, or – if accounting for all comparisons in data not shown – P0 = 0.05/41 = 0.0012. This correction does not affect our conclusions.
The dipteran acceleration affects the majority of
individual genes
By analysing concatenated amino acid sequences, we have
demonstrated accelerated evolution in dipterans, compared to a slower rate in the Tribolium lineage. Is this rate
change confined to certain genes, or does it extend across
the genome as a whole? To analyse this issue, we calculated branch lengths for 1199 orthologous groups comprising sequences from Tribolium and Drosophila, using
human as an outgroup. In Figure 2, we compare the
amino acid distances of Tribolium and Drosophila proteins
to their last common ancestor. There is a very strong relationship between these a priori unrelated distances (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rs = 0.718, P < 10-3).

When calculated from single gene distances, the mean
evolutionary rate of the Drosophila lineage is significantly
larger than the one of the Tribolium lineage (0.284 >
0.245; two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 10-3). The
corresponding constant of proportionality is 1.31, in close
agreement with the relative rate increase of 1.36 obtained
from the concatenated sequences (Table 1). Thus,
although evolutionary rates among genes of a genome can
vary by several orders of magnitude, these rates are nevertheless correlated between species even after more than
280 My of independent evolution.

ing [25]). In the case of the rRNA comparisons, we could
indeed show that there has been a mutational bias
towards incorporating more A/T nucleotides than G/C
nucleotides at the base of the Diptera [9], which has probably caused the episodic acceleration of evolutionary
rates. Such a mutational bias is likely to have affected the
whole genome. However, the GC content of the Tribolium
genes in this study (46.0%) is very close to that of the Drosophila orthologs (47.1%), suggesting that mutational
biases are unlikely to be responsible for the continued
acceleration in dipterans. This interpretation is supported
by the fact that it is the Tribolium proteins which show a
slight bias towards AT-rich amino acids when compared
to the Drosophila orthologs (28.1% AT-rich amino acids
for Tribolium, compared to 27.2% for Drosophila).

Comparison to the identity line expected under equal rates
demonstrates that the acceleration is a genome-wide effect.

Discussion
Using 439 nuclear transcripts, we find that the dipteran
lineage (represented by Drosophila and Anopheles) has
experienced an episodic increase in evolutionary rate
when compared to the coleopteran lineage (represented
by Tribolium). This rate subsequently dropped in the diversifying dipteran lineage, but remained above average in
Drosophila. This is consistent with previous findings from
studies of ribosomal RNAs [9,17]. The rate increases
found in our genome-scale analysis of protein sequences
are lower than those reported for rRNAs, with an average
increase of only 1.3-fold during dipteran evolution versus
an at least threefold average increase for rRNAs [9]. However, our analysis is necessarily biased towards parts of
genes that are sufficiently conserved to be detected in the
outgroup (human) and that could be unequivocally
aligned. Still, Figure 2 demonstrates that the averaged rate
increase is representative for a large range of genes.
The Neutral Theory of Evolution [1,18,19] predicts that
the accumulation of molecular changes is only driven by
the mutation rate and the degree of purifying selection.
Accordingly, genome-wide variation in the rate of protein
evolution between species might be caused by physiological and ecological factors that affect the mutation rate
(e.g. metabolic rate [20,21], temperature [20]), or by differences in the efficiency of selection (notably variation in
effective population size [22-24] or the level of outbreed-

We observe a strong correlation between evolutionary
rates in the Tribolium and the Drosophila lineages (Figure
2). This indicates that the selective forces acting on the
majority of these genes have been similar between the two
lineages, consistent with a neutral model. The correlation
would be expected to become weaker or even disappear if
positive selection would occur episodically among these
genes. Our finding that most proteins diverge in a clocklike fashion, with clock speeds that differ among lineages
only due to genome-wide effects, suggests that episodic
changes are an exception, although such changes are
known to occur in some cases [26,27]. However, we note
that the class of fast evolving genes could not be analysed
here, as they diverge too fast to allow identification as
orthologs in distant comparisons [28]. In a dedicated
study of such genes between closely related Drosophila lineages, we found that there are indeed a significant number
of genes that must have undergone episodic changes in
substitution rates on a gene by gene basis [29]. Thus, we
emphasize that the above conclusions relate only to relatively conserved (or non-orphan) genes, while the generalized evolutionary patterns of fast evolving (or orphan)
genes will need further study.

Conclusion
We reported here the analysis of evolutionary rate variation of a large number of orthologous genes between
insect lineages. Variation in the rate of evolution has
genome-wide effects, and is correlated between orthologous genes over very long evolutionary time scales.
Because Drosophila melanogaster is among the best studied
animal model organisms, the peculiar evolutionary pattern confirmed here has practical implications. In BLAST
searches of human sequences against Tribolium and Drosophila, Tribolium sequences are found in 70% of cases to
be more similar to human than Drosophila genes (N =
1221, P = 10-50 from sign test). Thus, when attempting to
link human genes to their Drosophila homologs, data from

Tribolium will be helpful to provide a more conservative
reference sequence. This approach has been used, e.g., to
resolve the evolutionary relationship between the Drosophila zen gene and human HOX3 genes [30]. The slowly
evolving beetle Tribolium castaneum is thus likely to play a
significant role for comparisons between phyla.

Methods

rRNA – ribosomal RNA

Sequences
Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Homo sapiens peptides were obtained from Ensembl [31]. For Tribolium castaneum, EST data available through NCBI dbEST
[32] were assembled into contigs using phrap and manually curated to ensure high quality of the data set. For the
pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, a publicly available ESTbased unigene set was obtained from the INFOBIOGEN
GnpSeq database [33]. Tribolium and Acyrthosiphon pisum
contigs were then searched against all Drosophila melanogaster proteins using BLASTx. The reading frame from
the best hit was assumed to be the correct reading frame.
We then chose the longest run of peptides uninterrupted
by a stop codon as the peptide corresponding to each EST
contig.
Identification of orthologs
We performed BLASTp searches of all proteome pairs
among Tribolium castaneum, Drosophila melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, Acyrthosiphon pisum and Homo sapiens.
Orthologs were selected based on reciprocal best blast hits
[34] using an e-value cut-off of 10-10. A group of sequences
with exactly one member in each species was accepted as
an orthologous family if each sequence had each of the
other family sequences as the best BLASTp hit in the
respective proteome. This requirement of all-against-all
reciprocal best hits is very stringent, and thus gives good
confidence in the inferred orthology.
Alignments and distance estimation
Multiple sequence alignments were performed with MUSCLE [35] using default settings. Resulting alignments were
purged from putatively misaligned positions as well as
gap positions with Gblocks using default settings [36].

Branch lengths were calculated with the maximum likelihood model by Goldman and Yang [11] as implemented
in the PAML package [37]. We used the empirical transition matrix compiled by Jones et al. [38]. The distribution
of evolutionary rates across sites was approximated by a
discrete Γ-distribution, with the shape parameter as an
additional free parameter. When calculating rates for individual genes, we assumed a uniform rate across sites. Clusters containing genes with zero branch length were
discarded from further analysis.
