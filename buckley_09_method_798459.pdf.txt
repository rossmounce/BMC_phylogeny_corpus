Abstract
Background: As the amount of genome sequencing data grows, so does the problem of
computational gene identification, and in particular, the splicing signals that flank exon borders.
Traditional methods for identifying splicing signals have been created and optimized using
sequences from model organisms, mostly vertebrate and yeast species. However, as genome
sequencing extends across the animal kingdom and includes various invertebrate species, the need
for mechanisms to recognize splice signals in these organisms increases as well. With that aim in
mind, we generated a model for identifying donor and acceptor splice sites that was optimized using
sequences from the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. This model was then used to
assess the possibility of alternative or cryptic splicing within the highly variable immune response
gene family known as 185/333.
Results: A donor splice site model was generated from S. purpuratus sequences that incorporates
non-adjacent dependences among positions within the 9 nt splice signal and uses position weight
matrices to determine the probability that the site is used for splicing. The Purpuratus model was
shown to predict splice signals better than a similar model created from vertebrate sequences.
Although the Purpuratus model was able to correctly predict the true splice sites within the 185/
333 genes, no evidence for alternative or trans-gene splicing was observed.
Conclusion: The data presented herein describe the first published analyses of echinoderm splice
sites and suggest that the previous methods of identifying splice signals that are based largely on
vertebrate sequences may be insufficient. Furthermore, alternative or trans-gene splicing does not
appear to be acting as a diversification mechanism in the 185/333 gene family.

Background
Genome sequencing has generated large amounts of
sequence data, and the computational challenge of identifying genes, promoters, repeats and other sequence pat-

terns has proved demanding [1-3]. Average human genes
are 28 kb long, with 8.8 exons of ~120 nucleotides (nt) in
length that are separated by 7.8 introns [4]. Identification
of the splicing signals that flank exon boundaries involves

finding the correct site amid thousands of incorrect sites.
Although computationally distinguishing bulk coding
from non-coding sequence has met with relative success,
gene prediction programs typically identify exon boundaries with less accuracy [5]. A number of gene-finding strategies have been developed, including comparison of
genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences [6],
hidden Markov models to identify splicing motifs [7,8],
Bayesian networks [9], inter-species genome comparisons
to identify genes with homologous structures [10], and
various combinations of these and other strategies [1113]. Additionally, some progress has been made in examining exon splice sites directly in hopes of improving the
accuracy of predicting these sites [14]. Nearly all of these
models have been generated using sequences isolated
from either mammals (primarily human and mouse),
Arabidopsis, or yeast. As the number of sequenced invertebrate genomes increases, the need for splice site identification models designed specifically for those organisms also
increases (reviewed in [15]). Despite the growing number
of invertebrate genomes, little data exist to address the
accuracy of employing vertebrate-based models for splice
site identification in other organisms. The traditional
strategies may fall short, given that novel genes have been
identified in invertebrates that lack the level of similarity
to known sequences required for many of the gene finding
programs, and many gene prediction programs perform
poorly in the GC-poor sequences [5] that may characterize
invertebrate genomes [16].
Sea urchins are members of the Echinoderm phylum and
provide a useful and interesting phylogenetic perspective
as an invertebrate at the base of the deuterostome lineage.
Although the genome of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was only recently sequenced [16], the
species has long served as a model for embryonic development [17]. A number of interesting attributes of this species have been uncovered that set it apart from vertebrate
or insect genomes. The GC content of the sea urchin
genome is 36.9%, lower than most vertebrates [16]. The S.
purpuratus genome is estimated to contain 23,300 genes,
many of which have chordate or protostome homologues,
in addition to many novel genes [16]. The average sea
urchin gene structure is similar to those in humans and is
7.7 kb long, with 8.3 exons that are 100–115 nt long, and
7.3 introns that are ~750 nt long [16]. Little is known
about the evolutionary conservation of the splicing proteins or the splicing signals in sea urchin gene models,
however, ESTs matching splicing proteins are upregulated
in sea urchin immune cells, or coelomocytes, in response
to immune challenge [18] and a number of gene models
encoding splicing proteins have been annotated [16]. It
was therefore of interest to develop a model that could
identify more accurately splicing signals within S. purpuratus genomic sequence.

The sea urchin also has a surprisingly complex immune
system [19] consisting of a rudimentary complement system [20] and a number of significantly expanded gene
families encoding proteins that are homologous to
known vertebrate immune proteins [21]. The 185/333
gene family from the purple sea urchin is an intriguing
example of diversification of a family of invertebrate
immune response genes [18,22-26]. The 185/333 genes
are highly expressed in response to challenge with whole
bacteria [27], lipopolysaccharide (LPS; [18]), doublestranded (dsRNA), and the fungal signature β-1,3-glucan
[25]. Of the 689 transcripts that have been isolated from
14 animals, 437 have unique sequences [25,26]. The
diversity takes the form of substantial levels of point
mutations, in addition to the presence or absence of
numerous short blocks of shared sequence called elements.
The variable presence/absence of these elements defines
element patterns, of which 35 are currently known
[23,25,26]. Multiple sequence repeats within the messages and genes allow multiple alignments that are different but equally optimal, of which two have been analyzed
extensively [23].
Although initial reports speculated that the variation in
element pattern might be the result of extensive alternative splicing [18], the first identification of a few 185/333
genes in an early assembly of the sea urchin genome
showed that the genes are small and composed of only
two short exons [23,26]. The first exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence, while the second exon encodes
the remainder of the open reading frame [4], including
the variable element pattern (see Additional file 1A). Further analysis of the 185/333 gene family from individual
sea urchins suggests that it may be composed of 80–120
exceptionally diverse alleles [22,23,26]. Of the 215 genes
that have been cloned and sequenced from four different
animals, 135 have distinct sequences. The genes are
flanked by di- and trinucleotide repeats, and some are
linked as closely as ~3 kb [23]. This close spacing of genes
is believed to promote diversification through gene duplication (unpublished data) and frequent recombination
[22]. Analysis of sequences isolated from individual animals, however, indicates that the genes and messages are
not identical and suggests possible cytidine deaminaselike post-transcriptional editing of the 185/333 transcripts
[24]. Although the two exon gene structure initially ruled
out alternative splicing [23,26], it is possible that the discord between the gene and message sequences, particularly that of non-matching element patterns in the genes
vs. messages from individual sea urchins, may be the
product of cryptic splice sites within the 185/333 genes.
Two possibilities exist: cryptic splice sites within the genes
i) alter the element patterns of the transcripts by removing
whole elements, or ii) promote trans-gene splicing to
form messages that are hybrids of two closely linked

genes. It was therefore of interest to investigate putative
cryptic splice sites within the 183/333 genes to determine
whether alternative or trans-gene splicing could further
increase the diversity of the 185/333 transcripts.
The results presented here test a donor splice site model
that was generated using known sea urchin splice sites and
is called the Purpuratus splice site model. It incorporates
non-adjacent dependencies among positions within the
donor splice site [28] and uses position weight matrices to
assess the probabilities of each nucleotide (nt) in each
splice site position [29]. This method is more accurate for
predicting splice sites from sea urchin sequences than a
similar model constructed using vertebrate sequences
[28]. The Purpuratus model also out-performed the Vertebrate model in predicting splice sites in protostome
sequences. Although putative donor cryptic splice sites
were identified within the 185/333 gene sequences, no
transcripts have been identified that utilize these splice
sites to either delete elements or to promote trans-gene
splicing.

Results
Model procedure: donor splice site
Although previous research identified sequences that
might act as alternative or cryptic donor splice sites from
vertebrate genes and mRNAs [1-3], little attention has
been paid to this area for sequences from non-model
organisms. Therefore, a computational model was generated with the aim of predicting splice sites, including cryptic sites, in processed mRNAs from echinoderm
sequences. The model incorporated observed dependencies among non-adjacent positions within the splice site
[28] and utilized the normalized position frequency
matrices (PFM) as reviewed in [29] to score each site. The
first step in the splicing process occurs when the U1 small
nuclear ribonuclear particle (snRNP) anneals to the donor
site through base-pairing between the U1 snRNA and the
bases of the donor splice site in the pre-processed message. The donor splice site consensus region consists of

the last three nt of the exon (positions -3 to -1, Table 1),
and the first six nt of the intron beginning with the canonical GT (positions 1 to 6). This base-pairing is degenerate,
with mismatches between the U1 snRNA and a suboptimal donor sequence at some positions [28]. A model to
identify these suboptimal sequences was generated using
the maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) method
described in [28], which identified dependencies between
non-adjacent positions within the donor splice sites.
Two models were generated: one using vertebrate
sequences as the source for the dependencies and PFMs,
and a second that used annotated S. purpuratus genes. The
Vertebrate model was constructed using the model and nt
frequencies shown in [28]. A set of 292 annotated S. purpuratus gene models [16] containing at least two exons
was collected (January, 2007; these sequences constituted
the "Purpuratus model" sequence set; Table 2). In total,
2,845 donor splice sites were extracted from the sequences
(Table 2) and the frequency of the nt in each position was
calculated to generate a consensus sequence (Figure 1A).
Splice site sequences containing N's were omitted from
the analysis. For each of the seven variable positions
within the donor splice site, the significance of the
dependencies was calculated between the consensus
nucleotide and the non-consensus nucleotides in the
other six positions (see Table 1 for an example of a
dependencies table). Although the donor site is traditionally defined as positions -3 to +6 relative to the GT site, the
nucleotide frequencies were calculated from -20 to +20.
Additional sequence may contribute to the spliceosome
specificity; however, incorporating data from these positions did not affect the accuracy of the model presented
here (data not shown). Significant dependencies were
used to subdivide serially a set of known donor splice sites
to generate the model (Figure 1B). After the data were
completely partitioned (see Methods), PFMs were generated for each of the subdivisions by determining the frequency of each nt present in each position of the splice
site for the sequences present in that partition. The PFMs

Figure 1 donor splice site
Purpuratus(see previous page)model
Purpuratus donor splice site model. A. Analysis of the frequency of each base within the splice site reveals the S. purpuratus
donor splice site consensus sequence. The nine nt window surrounding the donor splice sites from 292 annotated S. purpuratus
gene models (2845 donor sequences) were extracted, and the frequency of each nt within the window was calculated. The values shown in bold are the consensus nucleotides. Positions 1 and 2 are invariant because only canonical splice sites were used
in this analysis. B. The Purpuratus splice site model incorporated non-adjacent dependences among the bases within the splice
site. The model is implemented such that a splice site score of a given candidate sequence is computed using the matrix determined by applying the set of rules shown in the flowchart. For example, the sequence AAGGTAAGT would be scored using
the matrix A-2G5G-1A4T6 (A-2→A-2G5→A-2G5G-1→ A-2G5G-1A4→A-2G5G-1A4T6). Non-adjacent dependences were calculated
for the 2845 S. purpuratus donor splice sites for each of the seven variable positions between the consensus nt and the nonconsensus nucleotides in the other six positions (Table 1). The position with the maximum dependencies was used to serially
subdivide the sites until either the subdivision became too small to obtain reliable data, or no more significant dependences
were observed. Position frequency matrices are shown, which were calculated for each of the terminal subdivisions and ultimately used in the Purpuratus splice site model.

were transformed into position weight matrices (PWMs)
by dividing each of the frequencies by the observed nt
background frequencies and converting to a log scale [29].
A sliding window of nine nucleotides that contained a GT
in the conserved donor splice site position was evaluated
using the appropriate PWM (Figure 1). The score for each
of these nine nt windows was equal to the sum of the corrected probabilities of each base in each position, as determined by the PWM (positions 1 and 2 were omitted
because they were invariant, see Table 1). Only canonical
donor sites were scored in both the Purpuratus and Vertebrate models.
Determining model thresholds
The performance of each model was assessed using six
measures (Equations 2–7; see Methods) that required
binary classification of the sites (either positive or negative). Therefore, it was necessary to define a threshold for
each model that separated the positive and negative
scores. Histograms of scores from known positive and
negative sites were created from the sequences that were
used to generate the models (Figure 2). In a perfect model,
there would be no overlap between the scores assigned to
the positive and negative sites, because the positive
sequences would all receive scores higher than the negative sites. This was not possible, however, due to the
degeneracy of the splicing machinery and because certain

sequences may act as donor splice sites in some sequences
but are not functional in others. These factors complicate
the results such that the scores for the positive and negative sites overlap. A threshold was required to define each
score as either positive or negative for the model assessments. The ideal threshold would maximize the number
of positives that were classified as positive (true positives;
TP) and minimize the number of negative scores incorrectly labeled as positive (false positives; FP). A number of
thresholds were analyzed, including the average of all the
scores, the score at which 95% of the positive scores were
considered positive (P0.05), and the score at which 95% of
the negative scores were considered negative (N0.95; Table
3). The best threshold was the average of the means of the
positive and negative scores (Figure 2) because it provided
the most favorable balance between the number of true
positives and false positives, and was therefore used in the
subsequent evaluations of the models.
Model performance
Donor splice sites in the S. purpuratus sequences
The Purpuratus and Vertebrate donor splice models were
used to evaluate an independent set of annotated S. purpuratus genes (Table 2). The frequencies with which the
known positive and negative donor sites were predicted
correctly were calculated using a 2 × 2 contingency table.
The resulting numbers of TP, FP, true negative (TN), and

false negative (FN) sites were used to calculate six measures of model accuracy. The Purpuratus model out-performed the Vertebrate model in five of the six assessments
(Table 4; Figure 3). Most notably, the specificity (Sp) of
the Purpuratus model was higher than that of the Vertebrate model, indicating that, compared to the Vertebrate
model, more of the predicted positive sites were likely to
be functional donor sites. The sensitivities (Sn) of the two
models were approximately the same (Table 4). For each
of the four assessments [correlation coefficient (CC), simple matching coefficient (SMC), average conditional
probability (ACP), and approximate correlation (AC)]
that combined Sp and Sn values, the Purpuratus model
scored higher than the Vertebrate model (Table 4). Thus,
when evaluating sea urchin sequences, the Purpuratus
donor splice site model more accurately predicted
whether or not a given sequence could be used as a splice
signal.
Evaluating vertebrate sequences
Both models were also used to predict donor splice sites
within vertebrate genes (Additional file 2). Unexpectedly,
as when evaluating the sea urchin sequences, the Purpuratus model had higher Sp, CC, SMC, ACP, and AC than the
Vertebrate model (Table 4; Figure 2). The Sn of the Vertebrate model was higher than that of the Purpuratus model,
indicating that the Vertebrate model was able to identify
more of the positive sites. When the vertebrate sequences
were evaluated, the Sp and Sn values were lower than
when the S. purpuratus sequences were evaluated by either
model (Table 4).

Evaluating experimentally validated donor splice sites
A more extensive analysis of echinoderm splice sites has
not been completed previously because, prior to the availability of the assembled S. purpuratus genome, insufficient
numbers of gene sequences were available to analyze. As
of January, 2008, only 55 echinoderm genes with annotated exons were deposited in GenBank. From these
sequences, 62 canonical splice sites were experimentally
validated (Table 2). These sequences were also used to test
the two models for predicting donor splice sites. The Purpuratus model was able to identify 60 of 62 of the experimentally validated sites, while the Vertebrate model
predicted 59 of 62 validated sites (Table 5). Furthermore,
the Vertebrate model predicted more false positives than
did the Purpuratus model. The Purpuratus model therefore
had higher Sp and Sn, in addition to the assessment statistics CC, SMC, AC, and ACP. Thus, the Purpuratus donor
splice site model is able to predict splice sites not only
from annotated gene sequences, but also from experimentally validated sequences.
Evaluating protostome sequences
As species that is phylogenetically positioned between vertebrates and insects, sea urchins contain homologues of
genes from both protostome and deuterostome organisms [16]. It was therefore of interest to determine
whether the Purpuratus donor splice site model would
work better on other invertebrate sequences compared to
the Vertebrate model. A set of protostome genes containing known splice sites was collected from NCBI and analyzed using the two models (Table 2). Similar to results
comparing sea urchin and vertebrate genes, Sp and all four
of the assessments that combined Sp and Sn were higher
when the Purpuratus model was used to analyze the protostome genes compared to results using the Vertebrate
model. The Sn values of the two models, however, were
similar Figure 3; Table 4).
Analysis of putative cryptic donor splice sites within the
185/333 gene family
The 92 unique 185/333 genes isolated from three animals
[23] were used to analyze the donor splice sites with both
the Purpuratus and Vertebrate splice donor site models. A
total of 6743 GT sites were present within the sequences.
The score for each GT site was categorized as "positive"
(score ≥ N0.95), "negative" (score < P0.05), or "possible"
(P0.05 ≤ score < N0.95) (see Table 3). Because the aim of this
study was to identify as many donor splice sites as possible, both the positive and possible scores were analyzed
further as "candidate" sites. The position of each of these
sites was mapped onto an alignment of the 185/333 gene
sequences [23,26] and the locations of the splice sites with
respect to the positions of the elements were characterized. Because the elements have been defined based on
the presence of gaps that optimized the alignments of

one message contained a gap that could be the result of
alternative splicing. Therefore, candidate donor splice signals located at the beginning of elements were of particular interest for further analysis.
Results from the Purpuratus model
Using the Purpuratus donor splice site model (Figure 1) to
analyze the 185/333 genes, 51 of the 6743 total GT sites
were identified as positive and 1219 were classified as possible. On average, each of the 92 genes had 13.8 candidate
donor splice sites. These sites were distributed among 51

positions within the alignment (Table 6). The known
donor splice site (position 56) located at the 5' end of the
intron received the highest average score for all of the
genes analyzed (Table 6), and served as a positive control
that supported the legitimacy of the model. Of the 1270
candidate donor sites, 18 were located within the intron
and represented false positives because i) intron
sequences have never been observed among any of the
sequenced transcripts, and ii) translation of the known
intron sequences lead quickly to a stop codon. Consequently, these 18 sites were not analyzed further. One candidate donor site (GT7) was present in all genes and was
located within the first exon just after the starting methio-

nine (position 7; Table 6). The first exon, which is 55 nt in
length, encodes the hydrophobic leader [18,26]. If the
GT7 site was a functional donor splice site, and worked
with the known acceptor site at the 3' end of the intron, it
would generate a transcript with an intact open reading
frame without a leader sequence. Although this splice variant has not been observed among 185/333 transcripts
[18,25,26], alternative splicing using this donor site could
theoretically affect the cellular localization of the encoded
protein. Analysis of the 185/333 protein localization
showed that most localized to vesicles in small and polygonal phagocytes and to the cell surface of small phagocytes, however, small amounts of 185/333 proteins were
present in the cytoplasm of these coelomocytes [30].
The remaining 31 candidate donor splice sites were
located within the second exon, the majority of which
were within elements rather than at their edges. The positions of splice sites were analyzed with respect to elements
from the two previously published alignments [23,26].
Although no splice sites were found at the edges of elements from the repeat-based alignment, three sites, were
located at the 5' end of three different elements from the
cDNA-based alignment (Table 6). The GT in positions
1406, 1478, and 1646 were the first two nt of elements
Ex17, Ex18, and Ex22, respectively. This is noteworthy
because elements were defined based on gaps present
within the transcript sequences [26]. If these sites were
used as donor splice sites, this would introduce a gap in
the transcripts starting with the GT site. GT1406 was located
at the 5' end of Ex17, an element that was present in all
transcripts except those missing subelement Ex15a
[25,26]. However, those genes that had Ex15a also lacked
Ex17 [23], which suggested that the absence of Ex17
among these transcripts was due to its absence within the
corresponding genes, rather than to mRNA splicing.
GT1478 was located at the 5' end of Ex18, which is only 30
bp long, and when it was absent from transcripts, Ex19
was always present [25,26]. Species-specific minimal
intron sizes in humans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila
melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are 92, 89, 61, and
48 bp, respectively [31], and Ex18 is much shorter. Thus,
although the minimal intron size in S. purpuratus is
unknown, the size of Ex18 suggested that it would not be
spliced out of a 185/333 transcript without splicing out
neighboring elements. However, the last two nt of Ex18
are CG, which may function as an alternative acceptor site.
Although GT-CG splicing has been observed, it is believed
to account for less than 0.2% of functional splice sites
[32]. GT1646 was located at the beginning of Ex22, however, this element is present in all transcripts that also contain the preceding element Ex21. This suggested that,
although GT1646 could theoretically be used by the splicing machinery, splicing at this site has not been observed
among the 687 185/333 transcripts that have been charac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/318

terized to date [18,25,26]. Therefore, although possible
cryptic donor splice sites were identified within the 185/
333 gene sequences using the Purpuratus splice site model
(Figure 1), it was unlikely that any of these sites were used
for intragenic splicing to generate element pattern variation based on comparison of the known 185/333 transcript and gene sequences. This is in agreement with
previous data that suggested that the majority of the transcript element pattern variation was encoded by the second exon in this diverse gene family [23].
Analysis of the 185/333 genes with the Vertebrate model
The 185/333 gene sequences were also analyzed using the
Vertebrate model that was generated based on vertebrate
sequences. Among the 6743 sites, 244 were characterized
as positive using the Vertebrate model, and 1186 were
classified as possible, for a total of 1430 total candidate
donor splice sites that were located in 50 positions within
the alignment (Table 6). The known donor splice site in
position 56 located at the 5' end of the intron was identified in all 92 genes, although this site did not have the
highest average score (Table 6). In agreement with the Purpuratus model, 19 candidate sites were identified within
the intron, and GT7was also identified as a candidate
donor splice site in all of the genes. The 30 remaining sites
were not located at the 5' edge of elements, and were
therefore considered unlikely to be utilized as donor
splice sites.

Together, the two splice site models identified 67 candidate donor splice sites among the 185/333 genes. It was
surprising that only 34 of the sites were recognized by
both models. This may suggest that the remaining 33 sites
were false positives, although there was no significant difference between the scores of the sites that were recognized by both models vs. those that were recognized by
just one. The fact that the two models scored sites differently supports the idea that the two models recognize different sequences, which may hint at evolutionary
differences between optimal splice sites in different
groups of animals.
Do linked 185/333 genes undergo intergenic splicing?
The 185/333 genes are closely linked, some as close as ~3
kb [23]. Therefore, it is possible that a primary transcript
could be generated that spans two 185/333 genes followed by splicing the intergenic region using cryptic or
alternative donor splice sites to produce a hybrid message
that resembles the typical 185/333 messages transcribed
from single genes. To identify transcripts that might result
from this type of putative intergenic splicing, the genes
and messages from individual animals were analyzed
[24]. If a message sequence was most similar to one gene
5' of a candidate splice site and most similar to a different
gene 3' of that splice site, this would provide evidence for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/318

intergenic splicing. Because the GT site would be removed
during the splicing process, the only candidate splice sites
within the alignment that were analyzed, were those in
which gene sequences had a GT and message sequences
had a gap. Only two sites, GT1406 and GT1478 (Table 6),
met the criteria for further analysis.

sible that some of the 185/333 messages may be result of
splicing between two neighboring genes, analysis of the
candidate splice sites within the gene and message
sequences and comparison of the sequence on either side
of these splice sites support the theory that each message
was most often the product of a single gene.

GT1406 was located at the beginning of element Ex17
(Additional file 1B). There was only one message in which
Ex16 was present and Ex17 was absent (4–2406; GenBank
accession number EF065721), although 35 of the genes
contained a high scoring candidate donor splice site at
this position. To identify putative intergenic splicing, the
sequence prior to and following GT1406 from message 4–
2406 was compared to all of the known 185/333 gene
sequences isolated from the same animal and scored for
substitutions and indels as in [24]. Previous analysis of
this message suggested that the gene from which it was
mostly likely transcribed was unknown because the message was not significantly similar to any of the genes [24].
If the 5' and 3' ends of the message were similar to two
separate genes, a more likely scenario may be that message
4–2406 is the product of intergenic splicing such that the
region 5' of GT1406 was transcribed from one gene, and the
3' end of the message from a different gene. A more
detailed sequence analysis showed that the region 5' of
GT1406 was most similar to gene 4–1544 (GenBank accession number EF607785), but differed by seven indels and
49 substitutions. On the other hand, analysis of the 3' end
of message 4–2406 showed that it differed from gene 2036 (GenBank accession number EF607718) by only a
single nucleotide (Additional file 1B). One interpretation
of this result may be that message 4–2406 was generated
from transgene splicing from an unknown gene to gene 2036, although other interpretations, such as gene recombination, are possible [22].

Discussion

The other candidate donor site of interest, GT1478, was
located at the beginning of element Ex18. A total of 38
genes contained GT1478 (Table 6), and there were four
messages in which the position was located at the beginning of a gap (4–2433, 4–2441, LPS2-2405, and LPS22412). The sequences from these messages located 5' and
3' of GT1478 were compared to the corresponding regions
of the genes, and the gene from which each end of the
messages was most likely transcribed was determined
[24]. This was done by adding the lowest score from the 5'
and 3' ends and comparing that to the score of a fulllength gene sequence [24]. For each of the four messages,
the score of the full-length gene from which the message
was likely to have been transcribed was lower than the
sum of the scores from the two halves. This indicated that
it was more probable that the message was transcribed
from a single gene, rather than being the product of intergenic splicing. Therefore, although it was theoretically fea-

The data presented here demonstrate that a splice site
model generated using sea urchin sequences can predict
more accurately the donor splice sites in sea urchin and
protostome sequences than a model generated using vertebrate sequences. It was intriguing that the Purpuratus
donor splice site model also worked better on the vertebrate sequences than did the Vertebrate model. The accuracy of the Purpuratus model was lower when analyzing
sea urchin sequences than when analyzing the vertebrate
sequences. The Purpuratus model was better able to predict
the splice sites in the set of experimentally validated echinoderm sequences. Although putative cryptic donor splice
sites were identified within the 185/333 gene sequences,
searches of the currently available transcript sequences did
not show that these splice sites were generally employed
to remove elements and change the element pattern,
although one example was identified that may employ
trans-gene splicing to generate novel messages.
Analysis of the splice site models
One problem with the Purpuratus donor splice site model
is that it has low overall specificity, which predicts many
false positives. The reason for this is that the nine nt
sequence that includes the donor splice site could be a
functional donor splice site in some cases and a non-functional donor splice site in others. For example, of the total
313,955 GT sites that are present in the set of S. purpuratus
sequences used to generate the Purpuratus model, there are
only 16,247 unique nine nt sequences (this number of
sites is possible given all combinations of the four nucleotides in each of the seven variable positions of the splice
site). Of those, 723 nine nt sequences are both functional
and non-functional in different sequences. This is the
basis for the overlap of the histograms of the positive and
negative scores, and confounds the establishment of a
clear threshold to define positive scores. A number of
thresholds were examined in this analysis, and it is feasible to continue to adjust the threshold of positive scores
based on the aims of this and future studies. For example,
in this analysis of 185/333 sequences, the aim was to identify as many putative splice sites as possible. Consequently, the threshold was defined as P0.05 because this
was the level above which 95% of known positive scores
fell. However, this threshold could be raised if a more
stringent analysis is required. Furthermore, because this
analysis considers only splice sites and does not evaluate
whether or not a sequence is likely to be a coding region,

this method is not likely to be optimal for ab initio gene
prediction, but rather, is better suited to identify cryptic or
alternative donor splice sites within the context of known
genes in conjunction with other data.
Acceptor site analysis
Acceptor sites are much more complex and the sequences
of acceptor sites are much more degenerate, and therefore
more difficult to model [14,28]. During splicing, the
deleted intron forms a lariat structure, which is part of the
process to ligate the adjoining exons. Lariat formation is
mediated by the branch point region, a short sequence
that is located between 10 and 50 nt upstream of the
acceptor site [33]. Previous studies have shown that the
sequence conservation of this branch point is very low.
For example, the consensus branch point sequence
(YYRAY) has been found in the correct position with
respect to the acceptor site in only 30% of vertebrate
sequences analyzed [28]. Despite the lack of conservation
in either the branch point sequence or its location, a
strong pyrimidine bias has been observed in the region
upstream of the acceptor site, as introns commonly end
with a poly-pyrimidine stretch [14,34]. Although this bias
was exploited to generate a simple model that predicts
acceptor splice sites, no predicted acceptor sites were identified within the 185/333 sequences other than the known
site (data not shown). Given the difficulty of modeling
acceptor sites, and the lack of trans-gene or alternative
splicing within the 185/333 sequences, this was not
explored further.
The evolution of splice sites
Although little attention has been paid to splicing
machinery in sea urchins, the small nuclear RNA ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles have been characterized
[35]. Gene models corresponding to components of the
spliceosome, including the U5 snRNP protein
(SPU_003407), U11/U12 snRNP protein (SPU_026605),
and the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP-associated protein
(SPU_019522) have been annotated in the sea urchin
genome [16]. Furthermore, analysis of transcripts
expressed in sea urchin coelomocytes in response to LPS
shows a number of mRNAs that encode proteins involved
in RNA splicing [18]. These include the ET putative translation product, nuclear RNA- and DNA-binding proteins,
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R, splicing factor 30, and a conserved nonhistone nucleic acid-binding
protein. This suggests that coelomocytes responding to an
immune challenge have increased gene expression that
requires a coordinated increase in the expression of proteins involved in RNA splicing and processing. The slight
differences observed in the frequency of nt in the putative
U1 binding site between the S. purpuratus donor sites and
the vertebrate donor splice sites, as well as the differences
in the non-adjacent dependencies between the sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/318

from the different phyla imply differences in the recognition specificity of the spliceosome proteins. The most
notable difference between the two models is that the
consensus sequences differ at the +3 position, where Purpuratus has a consensus A, whereas the vertebrate model
has an A/G [28]. This difference suggests that the Purpuratus model is more stringent, and therefore more specific,
which agrees with the hypothesis that alternative splicing
evolved by gradually relaxing the splice sites (see [36]).
Phylogenetic analyses of the proteins involved in RNA
splicing and their active sites may shed additional light on
these differences.
Analysis of the 185/333 splice sites
Although candidate donor splice sites are present within
the 185/333 gene sequences, no transcripts have been
identified that use these splice sites. Although some of the
donor splice sites are located at the 5' edge of elements,
these elements are present in similar frequencies in both
genes and messages, suggesting that they are not spliced
out and do not alter element pattern diversity. Furthermore, no hybrid transcripts were identified that appeared
to be composed of two different genes, which decreased
the possibility that trans-gene splicing is involved in diversification of the 185/333 transcripts. The 185/333 gene
family has not been exhaustively sampled [23], consequently it is possible that a pair of genes from which a corresponding hybrid transcript might be spliced may yet be
identified. However, our data strongly suggest that the
185/333 system is not using cryptic splice sites for diversification of the messages.

Conclusion
The data presented here are the first published analyses of
echinoderm splice sites, and the first splice site models
generated from echinoderm sequences. As more invertebrate genomes are sequenced, the utility of these types of
models will increase for identifying cryptic or alternative
splice sites within newly annotated genes. Because most of
the available data stems from mammals, the splice site
models that have been available to date have been tailored towards those sequences. Only the Purpuratus donor
splice site model was able to identify putative splice sites
located at the edges of the known 185/333 elements,
which suggests that the Vertebrate splice site models are
insufficient for sea urchin sequence analysis. It was of note
that the Purpuratus donor splice site model also predicted
protostome splice sites with greater accuracy than the Vertebrate model. The procedure for generating this model is
straightforward, and could be repeated using sequences
from any species or phylum, given enough available
sequences.
Previous work has suggested that there are two levels of
diversification of the 185/333 system. First, the 185/333

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/318

genes may undergo an elevated rate of gene recombination, which may be promoted by the numerous repeats
that are present both within and between the genes [22].
Second, the low correspondence between the sequences
of the genes and the messages from individual sea urchins
suggests that the messages are edited, perhaps by a constitutive cytidine deaminase [24]. The models described and
tested here have been used to search for a possible third
level of diversification of the 185/333 messages through
alternative and trans-gene splicing using cryptic splice
sites. The results suggest that, unlike the Dscam gene in
arthropods [37-39], the sea urchin 185/333 system either
does not employ alternative or trans-gene splicing, or that
the occurrences are below our abilities to detect them.
This highlights how different groups of organisms use different approaches to accomplish immune diversification.

Methods
Sequence data
A summary of the characteristics of the sequences used to
generate and evaluate the models is found in Table 2. The
sequences used to establish the positive threshold for the
Vertebrate model were taken from [28]. Vertebrate and
protostome sequences for evaluation were downloaded
from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Accession
numbers and coordinates are shown in Additional files 2
and 3, respectively. The set of experimentally validated
echinoderm gene sequences was downloaded from NCBI
and used to assess the splicing models. Accession numbers and coordinates of these sequences are given in Additional file 4.
Generating the donor site models
For each position within the donor site, the frequency of
each nucleotide was calculated (Figure 1A). The most
common nucleotide was considered the consensus. When
the consensus nucleotide was present in less than 50% of
the sequences, the two most frequent nucleotides were
both considered consensus (see position -3; Figure 1A).
To identify non-adjacent dependencies between the consensus indicator variable, Ci, and the nucleotides in position Xj, the χ2 value was calculated for Ci vs. Xj, for all pairs
of i, j such that i ≠ j. The dependencies were calculated
such that if the nucleotide indicator (Xj), matched the
consensus nucleotide (Ci), the score was 1; otherwise,
they received a score of 0. Positions 1 and 2 (the GT site)
were omitted, as they were invariant in this data set. Using
the χ2 values determined above, for each position i, the
sum

Si =

∑

i≠ j

χ 2(C i , X j )

(1)

was calculated. The position i, with the greatest value of Si
was used to subdivide the set of splice sites into those con-

taining the consensus nucleotide at position i, and those
containing a non-consensus nucleotide. The process was
repeated until one of the three following conditions
occurred: (1) no more subdivisions were possible because
all of the positions had been used; (2) no significant
dependencies were observed; or (3) the subdivided datasets became too small as to no longer provide reliable data
(< 500 sequences). The models were implemented using
PERL scripts (Additional files 5 and 6).
Measures of assessing the donor site models
The accuracy of the models was assessed using six measures: sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), correlation coefficient (CC), simple matching coefficient (SMC), average
conditional probability (ACP), and approximate correlation (AC). The formulas and rationales for each of these
parameters are described in [5,28]. Briefly, for each of the
models, a 2 × 2 contingency table was generated to identify the number of true positives (known positive sites that
were scored as positive; TP), false positives (known positive sites that were scored as negative; FP), false negatives
(known negative sites that were scored as positive; FN),
and true negatives (known negative sites that were scored
as negative; TN) (Figure 3). Sn and Sp are the most general
measures of model accuracy, defined such that

Sn =

TP
TP + FN

(2)

measured how many of the true positives the model was
able to identify, and

Sp =

TP
TP + FP

(3)

measured how many of the positives predicted by the
model were true positives. Although these measures provided some insight into the accuracy of the models, it was
of interest to use a single value that incorporated both Sn
and Sp to better compare the performances of the models.
The CC is a measure traditionally used by gene prediction
programs [5], and is defined as

CC =

(TP*TN )−(FN*FP )
(TP + FN )*(TN + FP )*(TP + FP )*(TN + FN )
(4)

The CC measures the probability of a GT donor site being
predicted as positive given that it actually is positive and
being predicted as negative given that it actually is negative. As noted by [5], the major flaw in the utility of CC is
that it is undefined when any of the values on the denominator is equal to 0. That is, when, either reality or prediction lacks both positive and negative donor splice sites. To
circumvent this problem, the SMC is used, where

SMC is a measure of the probability that a given GT site is
correct, i.e., that it is assigned the same value (positive or
negative) in both reality and prediction. ACP is another
single scalar value that assesses the global accuracy of the
models using the 2 × 2 contingency table, as does CC, but
can be calculated in any circumstance, like SMC. ACP is
defined as

site is in a given state. ACP is a probability that ranges
from 0 to 1, but is transformed into the AC through

AC = ( ACP − 0.5) * 2

such that the AC ranges from -1 to 1 and can be compared
to the CC and can be computed in any circumstance.
