Abstract
Background/Aim: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the subject of intense research and clinical
investigation as its major role in human disease has emerged. HCV circulates in vivo as a complex
population of different but closely related viral variants, commonly referred to as a quasispecies.
The extent to which recombination plays a role in the evolution of HCV quasispecies when patients
are undergoing anti-viral therapy is currently unknown. In order to gain insight into these matters,
we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of HCV quasispecies populations from six patients
undergoing anti-viral therapy.
Methods: Putative recombinant sequences were identified with the use of SimPlot program.
Recombination events were confirmed by bootscaning, using putative recombinant sequence as a
query. Statistical support for the presence of a recombination event was done by the use of LARD
program.
Results: A crossing-over event in the NS5A gene in a HCV strain recovered after four weeks of
treatment was identified in quasispecies from a patient with sustained response. Putative parentallike strains were identified as strains circulating in previous weeks on the same patient.
Conclusion: Only one recombinant strain was detected in all patient quasispecies populations
studied. The recombination break-point is situated on the PKR-binding region of NS5A. Although
recombination may not appeared to be extensive in NS5A genes of HCV quasispecies populations
of patients undergoing antiviral therapy, this possibility should be taken into account as a
mechanism of genetic variation for HCV.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is estimated to infect 170 million
people worldwide and creates a huge disease burden from
chronic, progressive liver disease [1] HCV has become a
major cause of liver cancer and one of the commonest
indications of liver transplantation [2,3].

HCV has been classified in the family Flaviviridae,
although it differs from other members of the family in
many details of its genome organization [1]. Like most
RNA viruses, HCV circulates in vivo as a complex population of different but closely related viral variants, commonly referred to as a quasispecies [4-7].

HCV is an enveloped virus with an RNA genome of
approximately 9400 bp in length [8,9]. Comparison of
nucleotide sequences of variants recovered from different
individuals and geographical regions has revealed the
existence of at least six major genetic groups [1,10-12].
Each of the six major genetic groups of HCV contains a
series of more closely related sub-types [1].
Interferon monotherapy provided the first hope for
patients with chronic hepatitis C that the virus could be
permanently eradicated. An important development in
treating this disease was the recognition that the effects of
interferon could be greatly enhanced by combining it with
ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue. This combination regimen essentially doubled the sustained virological
response rates seen with interferon alone. Recently,
pegylated forms of interferon have been developed, and
when that forms of interferon are used in combination
with ribavirin, it demonstrates even better efficacy. For
that reason, peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa2b are the latest innovations for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis C [3,13,14].
Recombination plays a significant role in the evolution of
RNA viruses by creating genetic variation. For example,
the frequent recovery of poliovirus that results from
recombination has the potential to produce "escape
mutants" in nature as well as in experiments [15]. Recombination has also been detected in other RNA viruses for
which multivalent vaccines are in use or in trials [16,17].
Recently, a natural intergenotypic recombinant (2 k/1b)
of HCV has been identified in Saint Petersburg (Russia)
[18,19]. Phylogenetic analyses of HCV strains circulating
in Peru, demonstrated the existence of natural intra-genotypic HCV recombinant strains (1a/1b) circulating in the
Peruvian population [20]. In these cases, the recombination events have taken place in the non-structural region
of the HCV genome. Recombination break-points in HCV
structural capsid genomic region has been recently identified [21].
Given the implications that recombination has for RNA
virus evolution [16], it is clearly important to determine
the extent to which recombination plays a role in the evolution of HCV quasispecies populations in vivo, when
patients are undergoing anti-viral therapy.

Results
To gain insight into possible recombination events, a phylogenetic profile analysis was carried out using HCV NS5A
sequences from HCV quasispecies populations obtained
by Puig-Basgoiti et al. [22] from patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Sequences were obtained by the use of the
LANL database [23] (for patients, strains accession num-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/87

bers, quasispecies obtained at different time points during
therapy and therapy outcome, see Table 1). Phylogenetic
profile analysis was done by the use of the SimPlot program [24]. Interesting, when the analysis was carried out
for strain AY378694 (obtained on week 4 in patient No.
7, see Table 1), a recombination point was detected at
position 286 of the NS5A sequence alignment and two
putative parental-like strains (AY378615 and AY378641,
obtained on weeks 0 and 2 from the same patient, respectively) were identified (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).
In order to confirm these results, the same sequences were
used for a bootscanning study [25]. The basic principle of
bootscanning is that mosaicism is suggested when one
observes high levels of phylogenetic relatedness between
a query sequence and more than one reference sequence
[25].When the putative recombinant strain identified in
the previous analysis (AY378694) is used as a query, this
is observed for this strain and the two putative parentallike strains previously detected (see Fig. 2). The same
recombination break-point position is observed in the
bootscanning analysis (see Figs. 1 and 2), confirming a
recombination break-point at position 286 of the NS5A of
strain AY378694.
To assess whether the recombination model we obtained
gave a significantly better fit to the data than the null
hypothesis of no recombination, we used LARD [26]. The
results of these studies are shown in Fig. 3.
As it can be seen in the figure, simulations of sequence
evolution under the null hypothesis (i.e., no recombination) gave strong statistical support for the alternative
hypothesis of recombination (P < 0.004, Fig. 3).

Discussion
The extent to which recombination plays a role in the evolution of HCV quasispecies when patients are undergoing
anti-viral therapy is currently unknown. In order to get
insight into this issue, we performed phylogenetic studies
on the NS5A gene of HCV quasispecies populations from
patients undergoing antiviral therapy. We have selected
NS5A since previous work by Enomoto et al. [27] suggested that the genetic heterogeneity of a specific domain
of HCV NS5A, termed IFN sensitivity-determining region
(ISDR), was related closely to response in Japanese
patients. Although this issue continues to be controversial
[22], analysis of the published information supports the
hypothesis that a relationship exists between NS5A and
response to therapy [28,29].
The results of these studies reveal that recombination can
not be denied as an evolutionary mechanism for generating diversity in HCV in vivo, in patients undergoing antiviral therapy (see Figs. 1 and 2). Recombination does not

seems to play an extensive roll in the evolution of HCV
quasispecies populations, at least by the study of NS5A
genes, since only one recombinant isolate was observed
among all HCV quasispecies populations studied. On the
other hand, the true frequency of recombination may be
underestimated, since a statistical significant number of
differences among recombinant and putative parentallike strains are needed in order to achieve detection by
current methods applied to detect recombination events.
Recombination may serve two opposite purposes: exploration of a new combination of genomic region from different origins or rescuing of viable genomes from
debilitated parental genomes [30]. Interestingly, the
recombination break-point identified in recombinant
strain AY378694 is situated on the PKR-binding region of
NS5A ISDR [27,31] (see Fig. 4). Recent evidence suggests
that HCV NS5A protein can repress PKR function in vivo,
possibly allowing HCV to escape the antiviral effects of
interferon [1,3,32,33]. An analysis of NS5A translated
sequences of recombinant and putative parental-like virus
suggests the possibility that recombinant isolate
AY378694 may have acquired amino acids known to be
present in HCV strains resistant to interferon treatment

(see Fig. 4), although more work is needed in order to test
this hypothesis, since the results found for the ISDR still
remains a controversial issue [22]. For that reason,
although recombination may not appeared to be extensive in NS5A genes of HCV quasispecies populations of
patients undergoing antiviral therapy, this possibility
should be taken into account as a mechanism of genetic
variation for HCV.

Conclusion
Only one recombinant strain was detected in all patient
quasispecies populations studied. The recombination
break-point identified in strain AY378694 is situated on
the PKR-binding region of NS5A. The results of these studies reveal that recombination events can be observed in
patients undergoing anti-viral therapy. Recombination
can not be denied as a mechanism of genetic variation for
HCV.

200 bp and 20 bp, respectively.

Sequences
NS5A sequences from the study done by Puig-Basagoity et
al. [22] were obtained from the HCV LANL database [23]
(for patient identification, quasispecies accession numbers obtained at each week of therapy and therapy outcome, see Table 1). Sequences were aligned using the
CLUSTAL W program [34].

The results obtained in the recombination analysis were
confirmed using a bootscanning analysis [25]. The window width and the step size were set to 200 bp and 20 pb,
respectively.

Putative recombinant sequences were identified with the
SimPlot program [24]. This program is based on a sliding

the entire length of a set of aligned homologous

To assess whether the recombination model we obtained
gave a significantly better fit to the data than the null
hypothesis of no recombination, we used LARD [26].
Briefly, for every possible breakpoint, the sequence alignment was divided into two independent regions for which
the branch lengths of a tree of the putative recombinant
and its two parent sequences were optimised. The two
