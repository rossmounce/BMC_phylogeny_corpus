Abstract
Background: Pathogenicity islands (PAIs), distinct genomic segments of pathogens encoding
virulence factors, represent a subgroup of genomic islands (GIs) that have been acquired by
horizontal gene transfer event. Up to now, computational approaches for identifying PAIs have
been focused on the detection of genomic regions which only differ from the rest of the genome
in their base composition and codon usage. These approaches often lead to the identification of
genomic islands, rather than PAIs.
Results: We present a computational method for detecting potential PAIs in complete prokaryotic
genomes by combining sequence similarities and abnormalities in genomic composition. We first
collected 207 GenBank accessions containing either part or all of the reported PAI loci. In
sequenced genomes, strips of PAI-homologs were defined based on the proximity of the homologs
of genes in the same PAI accession. An algorithm reminiscent of sequence-assembly procedure was
then devised to merge overlapping or adjacent genomic strips into a large genomic region. Among
the defined genomic regions, PAI-like regions were identified by the presence of homolog(s) of
virulence genes. Also, GIs were postulated by calculating G+C content anomalies and codon usage
bias. Of 148 prokaryotic genomes examined, 23 pathogenic and 6 non-pathogenic bacteria
contained 77 candidate PAIs that partly or entirely overlap GIs.
Conclusion: Supporting the validity of our method, included in the list of candidate PAIs were
thirty four PAIs previously identified from genome sequencing papers. Furthermore, in some
instances, our method was able to detect entire PAIs for those only partial sequences are available.
Our method was proven to be an efficient method for demarcating the potential PAIs in our study.
Also, the function(s) and origin(s) of a candidate PAI can be inferred by investigating the PAI queries
comprising it. Identification and analysis of potential PAIs in prokaryotic genomes will broaden our
knowledge on the structure and properties of PAIs and the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis.

Background
PAIs are distinct genetic elements of pathogens encoding
various virulence factors such as protein secretion systems, host invasion factors, iron uptake systems, and toxins [1,2]. PAIs are a subset of genomic islands which have
been transferred by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event
and confer virulence upon the recipient. PAIs can be identified by features such as the presence of virulence genes,
biased G+C content and codon usage, carriage of mobile
sequence elements, and/or association with tRNA genes
or repeated sequences at their boundaries [3].
Identification of PAIs is essential in understanding the
development of disease and the evolution of bacterial
pathogenesis [2]. As complete genome sequences rapidly
accumulate, various in silico methods have been developed to detect HGT [4-7]. Most of the methods were
based on the detection of genomic regions having atypical
G+C content, patterns of codon usage bias, or dinucleotide anomaly. However, compositional approaches may
generate many false positives due to other factors such as
selection and mutation bias [8,9], and a lot of false negatives owing to adjustment of the transferred sequence in
its composition by amelioration [10]. In fact, these methods detect different sets of ORFs as foreign origin when
applied to the genome of Escherichia coli K-12 [11]. Thus,
combining multiple lines of evidence can be beneficial to
determine whether a gene or a group of genes has been
acquired by HGT.
While studies on detecting horizontally transferred genes
or GIs in genome sequences have been intensively carried
out, little has been reported for PAIs. Considering that a
PAI is a GI encoding virulence factors, compositional criteria such as G+C content and codon usage is not sufficient for identifying PAIs because genomic approaches
can only lead to the identification of GIs [2]. In this work,
we designed a computational method for identifying PAIs
in sequenced genomes by combining a homology-based
method and detection of abnormalities in genomic composition. To do this, we collected published PAI data and
checked virulence genes on the PAI loci. We applied this
approach to 148 prokaryotic genomes and identified 77
candidate PAIs. Detected regions contain virulence genes
and relics of the HGT event.

Results
Genomic islands in bacterial genomes
As for the 157 chromosomes examined (Table 1S [see
Additional file 1]), the length proportion of GIs to the
chromosome averaged 10.1%. Nanoarchaeum equitans, the
smallest genome of any sequenced microbes, contained
the smallest proportion of GIs, which is only 2.9%. Leptospira intrerrogans, which is responsible for worldwide
water-borne zoonosis leptospirosis, contained the largest,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/184

34.7% for chromosome I and 32.2% for chromosome II.
The genome of L. interrogans was reported to have the biggest number of proteins with structural similarity to
eukaryal and archaeal proteins as compared to other bacteria [12]. In general, larger proportions of GIs in pathogens than those in related nonpathogenic species were
observed, e.g., 15.7% for Corynebacterium diphtheriae versus 7.6% for C. glutamicum, 12.3% for E. coli CFT073 versus 8.9% for E. coli K-12.
PAI-like regions
When every ORF contained in 207 PAI loci (see Table 1
and supplementary Table 2S for the complete information
[see Additional file 2]) were similarity-searched against
the ORFs present in the 148 prokaryotic genomes, 1,490
genomic strips of PAI-associated genes were defined based
on the proximity of the homologs of genes from the same
PAI accession. Overlapping strips were then merged into
525 genomic regions in 83 chromosomes (Figure 1).
Among these regions, 241 contained at least one gene
homologous to the virulence genes on the PAI loci, which
will be referred to as PAI-like regions in this study. 77 PAIlike regions (total 1,652,758 bp) partly or entirely overlapped GIs, while the remaining 164 regions (total
1,553,923 bp) did not contain any part of GIs. In this
report, we call the former candidate PAIs (cPAIs). Figure 2
shows the projection of PAI-like regions in their G+C contents and length-proportion of horizontally transferred
genes. 52% of all the PAI-like regions show lower G+C
content compared to those of their genomes (average of 0.6%, standard deviation of 3.8), however, 75% of the
cPAIs have lower G+C contents (-2.7%, 4.7, respectively).
The plot indicates that clusters of PAI-homologs are often
located in the backbone sequence while the detected GIs
tend to be biased to have lower G+C content.
Candidate PAIs
cPAIs, PAI-like anomalous regions, were present in 29
bacteria including 6 non-pathogens, and their sizes
ranged from 3.7 kb to 137.5 kb with the average length of
21.5 kb (Table 2, supplementary Table 3S [see Additional
file 3]). Most of these regions contained transposase, integrase genes or insertion sequence elements, and were
associated with tRNA genes at their boundaries, which is
indicative of genomic islands. In some instances, our
method allowed the detection of the entire PAIs for those
only partial sequences have been reported in the original
papers (Figure 3). This is due to the fact that PAIs often
share conserved regions, and homologous regions of
other PAIs can be located in the same PAI locus. Interestingly, cPAIs were detected in six strains which are known
to be non-pathogens. Genes contained code for an ABC
transporter (Bacillus halodurans), flagellar proteins (Bacillus subtilis), iron transport and fimbrial proteins (E. coli K12), transmembrane sensors and outer membrane efflux

proteins (Nitrosomonas europaea), or nodulation proteins
(Bradyrhizobium japonicum). Genes detected in Mesorhizobium loti, a bacterium that forms globular nodules and
perform nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with leguminous
plants, are involved in the nodulation process and a type
III secretion system (TTSS) [13]. However, the unexpected
locations of cPAIs in non-pathogens should be interpreted as some clusters of potentially horizontally transferred genes that have homology to virulence genes.
Among the 77 cPAIs, 34 matched to PAIs which have been
described in genome sequencing papers (Table 2, Figure
2). 27 cPAIs entirely matched to known PAIs â a PAI (in
Enterococcus faecalis), PAI I, IICFT073 (E. coli CFT073), LEE
(E. coli O157 EDL933 and Sakai), cag PAI (Helicobacter
pylori 26695 and J99), the TTSS and tc loci (Photorhabdus

luminescens), SPI-2,4,5 (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi
Ty2 and CT18, and serovar Typhimurium LT2), SPI-3 (S.
typhimurium LT2), SHI-1, 2 (Shigella flexneri 2a 2457T and
301), VPI (Vibrio cholerae), Hrp PAI (Xanthomonas
campestris), and HPI (Yersinia pestis CO92 and KIM). One
end of PAIs â SPI-1 (in three S. enterica strains), SaPIm3
(S. aureus Mu50), and SaPIn3 (S. aureus N315) â were
found in 5 cPAIs, and the other end of the PAIs were
found in seemingly backbone sequences. Î½SaÎ² in S. aureus
MW2 and CTX locus in V. cholerae N16961 were partly
matched. Nine cPAIs span the TTSS loci which were not
annotated as PAIs in the genome sequencing data.
Regions homologous to a certain PAI were frequently
found in genomes of various taxa. Especially, parts of PAIs
originally identified from enteropathogenic bacteria were

detected not only in enterobacteria but also in phyla other
than the Gammaproteobacteria in our study (Figure 4).
The number of genomes containing PAI-like regions was
drastically reduced when we considered genomic regions
that overlap GIs. Elements of PAI I~ III536 in the uropathogenic E. coli strain 536 showed high similarities to other
members of the Enterobacteriaceae. This is consistent with
the previous report that PAI-specific sequences of E. coli
strain 536 were frequently found in pathogenic and commensal E. coli isolates by using "E. coli pathoarray" [14].
Parts of the LEE PAI in enterohemorrhagic E. coli
O157:H7, enteropathogenic E. coli E2348/69, rabbit-specific enteropathogenic E. coli 83/89, and rabbit diarrheagenic E. coli RDEC-1 similarly matched to genomic
regions of different taxa.

In most cases, distribution of the regions homologous to
the PAIs from other enterobacteria such as VPI of Vibrio
cholerae, cag PAI of Helicobacter pylori, SaPI1 of Staphylococcus aureus strains were restricted to their host strains.
However, widespread distribution in different species was
evident for PAGI-1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Hrp
PAI of P. syringae, Xanthomonas spp., Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Ralstonia solanacearum. Variations of cPAIs
were observed for EDL933 and Sakai, which belong to the
same E. coli O157 group (Table 2). This discrepancy
results from the different distribution of prophages in the
two genomes. Also, different ORF prediction by different
research groups affected the determination of GIs.
PAI-like regions that did not meet the criteria
164 PAI-like regions in 57 prokaryotes including 16 nonpathogenic bacteria and one archaeon did not overlap GIs
(supplementary Table 4S) [see Additional file 4]. Their
sizes ranged from 1.9 to 50.6 kb and were averaged 9.5 kb.
Most of them encoded flagellar/fimbrial biosynthesis or
iron uptake systems. Among these regions, 14 were PAIs
published in the genome sequencing papers. Six PAIs â
Hrp PAI (in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000),
SPI-3 (S. enterica serovar Typhi strains Ty2 and CT18),
SaPIm1 (in S. aureus Mu50), SaPIn1 (S. aureus N315) and
Î½Sa3 (S. aureus MW2) â entirely matched, and 5 counterparts of the PAIs that partly match to the cPAIs that overlap GIs were found in these regions. Parts of LIPI-1 in
Listeria innocua and two regions of internalins in L. monocytogenes EGD were found. In fact, the Hrp PAI and LIPI-1
have DNA compositions similar to the core genomes, and
are suggested to have been acquired a long time ago
[15,16].

Discussion
By analyzing structures of many microbial genomes, it
became obvious that HGT is an important mechanism for
bacterial evolution, let alone genome complexity and
plasticity [1]. GIs, which are large genomic segments and

Example3of a PAI-like region and a cPAI in genome sequences
Example of a PAI-like region and a cPAI in genome sequences. 48.5-kb of PAI ICFT073 from E. coli CFT073 was
detected by merging genomic strips similar to known PAI loci (yellow strip) including partial sequence of PAI ICFT073. The
genomic region contains homologs of the virulence genes on the known PAIs (red arrow) and genomic island (grey bar).
Therefore, this PAI-like region is considered as a cPAI. Red and orange arrows in yellow strips denote virulence and putative
virulence gene, respectively. Numbers on the yellow strips indicate parts of the PAI loci homologous to the genomic strips: 1.
PAI I536 (accession number: AJ488511, host strain: E. coli 536); 2. PAI II536 (AJ494981, E. coli 536); 3. PAI III536 (X16664, E. coli
536); 4. LEE (AJ278144, E. coli 4797/97); 5 and 6. LEE (AF071034, E. coli O157:H7 EDL933); 7 and 8. PAI IICFT073 (AF447814, E.

most likely transferred by HGT, contribute to the survival
of the hosting bacterial strain in a particular environment
and sometimes to virulence. These two kinds of GIs, of
which the former can be referred as 'fitness islands', are
often hardly distinguishable from each other because the
role of a GI may vary in different ecological niches and the
physiology of the bacterium. Up to now, attempts to identify PAIs [5,6,17] have been made by detecting genomic

regions which only differ from the rest of the genome in
their base composition and codon usage. In this study, we
identified "candidate PAIs (cPAIs)" that reflect potential
PAIs with anomalous composition, probably due to their
recent acquisition. Among the 148 sequenced strains
searched in this study, 17 were the strains closely related
to the hosts carrying queried PAI loci. From the reports of
their genome sequencing projects, 27 PAIs have been

ella flexneri[18]. SPI-2 is a fusion of at least two genetic
elements â a 25-kb region encoding the TTSS with a low
G+C content and a 15-kb region encoding metabolic
functions with a G+C content similar to the rest of the
genome [19], and the Hrp PAI of Pseudomonas syringae has
a tripartite structure [15].

described. Among them, 23 PAIs were found in the list of
cPAIs and the accuracy of our method can be considered
as 85% (Table 2, supplementary Table 4S [see Additional
file 4]).
The presence of virulence factors could be a useful criterion for discerning PAIs from other genomic islands. Clusters consisting of only hypothetical genes and/or elements
involved in the transfer mechanism (e.g. IS elements,
tRNA genes, integrase, and prophage) were filtered out,
leaving only 46% of the genomic regions containing virulence factors. Widespread distribution of conserved elements of many PAIs in different species and in even nonpathogens is due to their complex mosaic structures consisting of elements of different origins. PAI I~ III536 in E.
coli 536 have mosaic-like structures consisting of many
DNA fragments that show high similarities to the chromosomal regions of other pathogenic E. coli strains and Shig-

Some virulence factors in PAIs are homologous to seemingly backbone genes. As shown in Figure 4, PAIs having
extensive mosaic structures showed highly frequent occurrence in various species, and clusters of seemingly backbone genes could be removed from the list of the cPAIs by
checking the presence of a GI in a PAI-like region. Many
Gram-negative bacterial pathogens cause diseases by
secreting and injecting virulence proteins (effectors) into
the host cell via a specialized protein secretion mechanism (TTSS) [20]. They are evolutionarily related to flagellar systems and often hard to distinguish when based only
on homology searches [21]. However, TTSSs are frequently transferred laterally between Gram-negative bacteria while flagellar systems are mainly inherited by
vertical descent. This fact explains why many regions
encoding flagellar biosynthesis genes have hits to PAI-like
regions not showing anomalies in DNA composition
(supplementary Table 4S) [see Additional file 4], while
PAI-like regions overlapping GIs contain lots of TTSSs
(Table 2). Iron uptake systems are important for bacterial
survival as well as virulence [2]. Many PAIs such as HPI of
Yersinia species, SHI-2 of S. flexneri, and SRL of S. flexneri
2a YSH6000 carry genes encoding various siderophore
systems that produce and secrete low-molecular-weight
siderophores with extremely high affinities for ferric iron.
Clusters of homologs of ferric dicitrate transport system
(fecABCDEIR, Fec) of SRL [22] were widely distributed in
the backbone genomic regions of various species, which
implies that Fec might be the most ancient siderophore
system (Figure 4, Table 2, supplementary Table 4S [see
Additional file 4]). Interestingly, a 7.1-kb fecCDE-homologous region can be found even in Halobacterium sp. NRC1, the only archaeon possessing the PAI-like region in this
study. This region is inserted by a 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase gene, 3 hypothetical proteins and tRNAArg gene.
One of the difficulties when dubbing potential PAIs in the
sequenced genomes is to determine the boundaries. A PAI
may have a number of genes which have undergone many
evolutionary stages and thus compositionally indistinguishable from the rest of the genome [2,23]. This might
be due to some parts highly adjusted to the base composition of the recipient's genome or to the backbone
genomic segments added later in evolution [10]. We
found that the length proportion of transferred regions
contained in the known chromosomal PAIs â 28.7 kb of
LEE in E. coli O157 Sakai, 36.2 kb of Cag PAI in H. pylori

Page 8 of 11

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:184

26695, 61.2 kb of VPI-2 in V. cholerae, and 137.5 kb of PAI
in Enterococcus faecalis â vary from 0.19 to 0.65. Thus,
compositional approaches cannot predict the boundaries
of the detected PAI because they only detect atypical
genomic region. To solve this problem, we detected
genomic segments homologous to each known PAI,
which were then clumped into a large genomic region.
This procedure is somewhat like the process of fragment
assembly in which a contiguous region (contig) is made
from overlapping fragments in shotgun sequencing [24].
Like the conserved sequences of TTSS structural genes
[20], PAIs often share conserved regions. In addition, PAIs
frequently carry relics of HGT event such as mobile
sequence elements and association with tRNA genes at
their boundaries [3]. Islander [25], a database of potential
integrative islands in prokaryotic genomes, detects GIs by
identifying tRNAs or tmRNA genes, and candidate integrase genes. Although many GIs reported from the database were in accordance with our results, large portion
was not annotated as cPAIs mainly due to the absence of
homologs of virulence genes in known PAIs and PAIs that
are not located at the tRNA loci. As illustrated in Figure 3,
frequent distribution of conserved regions between PAIs
allows our method to find the entire region of a PAI in a
sequenced genome even though its similar sequence is
partially known.
A typical genome sequencing team uses genes in the gene
cluster or the genome sequence of interest as a query to
search for any similar genes in the databases. Then,
homologs of pathogenicity/virulence genes are inferred
by checking whether descriptions of the retrieved genes
have any indications that suggest virulence/pathogenicity
or they are from pathogens. Because this approach
depends on the examiner's knowledge on known PAIs or
pathogenicity/virulence genes and entry descriptions of
the retrieved genes often are not informative to infer the
function, it is never sure whether the searches thoroughly
picked up all the genes associated with PAIs or pathogenicity/virulence. To avoid this uncertainty on the
robustness of the open-ended search, we first collected all
the reported PAI loci and used them as a query to search
for homologs in the complete prokaryotic genomes. Our
method guarantees that all the potential PAIs related to
the known PAIs were searched without the intervention of
human interpretation.
In completely sequenced genomes, we detected cPAIs that
are homologous to the published PAIs and show anomaly
in DNA composition. The methodology we developed in
this study has a limitation in that the detected cPAIs are
limited by the query data set of the known PAIs. This
caveat, however, can be advantageous when the researchers only concern a specific set of PAIs. Furthermore, this
approach can be easily extended to identify various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/184

genomic islands (e.g. fitness, metabolism, and resistance
islands). Among the cPAIs detected in this study, omission of several well-known PAIs such as Hrp PAI of P.
syringae and LIPI-1 of L. innocua is due to their DNA compositions similar to the core genomes which may caused
by horizontal transfer from closely related strains or very
ancient HGT event. Thus, patterns of best matches of each
gene to different species, lineage-specific genes or transferred genes from phylogenetically distant species would
be helpful in improving the possibility of finding GIs and
PAIs. Also, accumulation of PAI sequence data in bacterial
families other than the Enterobacteriaceae will lead to
detection of more putative PAIs across various taxa.
Finally, it should be noted that the identity of cPAIs as
bona fide PAIs need to be confirmed by further experimental verification. We are currently improving the detection scheme and are developing a database for cPAIs in
sequenced genomes.

Conclusion
We present the first computational framework combining
feature-based analyses and similarity-based analyses. As
shown in Figure 3, the similarity-based analysis that is
reminiscent of the sequence-assembly procedure was
proven to be an efficient method for demarcating the
potential PAIs in our study. Also, the function(s) and origin(s) of a cPAI can be inferred by investigating the PAI
queries comprising it. With the availability of rapidly
increasing complete genome sequences [26] as well as PAI
data, the proposed method will be useful in identifying
potential PAIs in microbial genomes.

Methods
Collection of complete genomes and PAI Data
The sequence files of 148 prokaryotic complete genomes
consisting of 157 chromosomes, including 17 archaeal
ones as of January 2004 were downloaded from the NCBI
FTP server (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov, supplementary Table
1S) [see Additional file 1]. We searched the GenBank database and literature [3,23] for any descriptions of the
"pathogenicity island". Forty five kinds of PAIs and 207
GenBank accessions containing either part or all of the
reported PAI loci in 120 pathogenic bacteria, are summarized in Table 1. (see supplementary Table 2S for the
complete information) [see Additional file 2]. The definition of virulence genes is difficult as their function may
depend on growth conditions and host niches. Thus, we
attributed this to the biologists who identified PAI loci,
and virulence genes of PAI loci were identified by literature survey. Many PAIs, 29 out of 45 kinds of PAIs, came
from Enterobacteriaceae. Thirty four PAI loci are completely sequenced ones ranging from 6.8 kb to 153.6 kb
(average: 41.3 kb), and the remains are part of PAI. It
should be noted that the collected sets do not contain

PAIs which were reported from genome sequencing
papers.
Detection of GIs in genome sequences
To detect GIs in a chromosome, we first identified horizontally transferred genes (H) based on the algorithm
developed by Garcia-Vallve et al. [4]. To alleviate false
positives caused by applying single criterion for identifying HGT regions, we considered a gene as H only if both
G+C content and codon usage are aberrant. For each
genome, we have computed total G+C content ([G+C]T)
and G+C contents at the first and third codon positions
([G+C]1 and [G+C]3) of every ORF. The compositional
bias at the first and third positions were reported to be
positively correlated to expressivity and genomic G+C
content, respectively [10,27]. Extraneous origin of the
gene in terms of G+C content was considered if its [G+C]T
deviates over 1.5 Ï or if deviations of [G+C]1 and [G+C]3
are of the same sign and at least one of them is over 1.5 Ï.
Mahalanobis distance (dM) was used to evaluate deviation
of the codon usage of a gene and mean of the genome [4].
dM is a statistic in unit of standard deviation from the
mean of 61 codon frequencies and can be calculated as
follows:

dM(X, Xmean) = (X - Xmean)T S-1(X - Xmean)
Where X and Xmean correspond to vectors having relative
frequencies of the 61 codons for a gene and the mean values for a genome, respectively. S-1 is the inverse of variance-covariance matrix (S) of all the 61 codon
frequencies. The higher this value is the more deviation in
codon usage [4]. If Xs are normally distributed, dMs can be
converted to p-values using the Ï2 distribution function.
We considered a gene as extraneous in codon usage if its
p-value was less than 0.05. It should be noted that genes
longer than 300 bp were used for calculating the mean
and standard deviation (Ï) of G+C contents and dMs. This
is from the observation that genes having shorter than 300
bp have much higher chance of anomalies in G+C content
and codon usage.
We ran a genome scan of a 10-gene window and identified
regions containing four or more H. This threshold frequency of 0.4 was inferred from the observation that the
frequencies of H in known PAIs such as LEE of E. coli
O157 Sakai, cag PAI of Helicobacter pylori 26695, VPI-2 of
Vibrio cholerae, and a PAI of Enterococcus faecalis, were
averaged 0.35. Neighbouring regions were merged into
larger regions which were referred to as GIs in this study.
Some genomic regions had highly biased G+C content
compared to the whole G+C content of the chromosome,
while their codon usage were not biased. For example,
46.4 kb genomic region ranging from 2,647,129 bp in
Yersinia pestis KIM, which contains yersiniabactin genomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/184

island [28] has considerably higher G+C content (55.7%
versus 47.6% average for the whole genome), but showed
a similar codon usage for the genes contained in this
region. Thus, among genomic regions made from genes
anomalous in G+C content, the region was added to GIs
if its G+C(T) deviates more than 1.5 Ï.
Identification of candidate PAIs
The detection scheme for the regions of cPAIs is outlined
in Figure 1. Each ORF from PAI locus was used as the
query in BLASTP searches [29] against the set of ORFs
from each of the 148 completely sequenced genomes
using PAM250 as scoring matrix for retrieving homologous genes in evolutionary distant strains. Likewise,
homologs of ORFs, RNA genes and repeat regions of PAI
locus on the nucleotide level were searched using BLAT, a
modified BLAST alignment program which can stitch
matched regions into a larger one [30]. If the identity of
the resulting hit is over 80% for DNA sequence or 25% for
protein sequence and the aligned region is both over 70%
of lengths of query and the hit, the pair of sequences was
considered as a homolog. Genomic strips corresponding
to each PAI locus were then obtained by identifying the
regions containing four or more homologs of the genes
from the same PAI accession and by merging the neighboring regions. Overlapping or adjacent genomic strips
corresponding to the same or different kind of PAI loci
were fused into a large region. Among these regions, PAIlike regions were identified by checking the presence of at
least one gene homologous to a virulence gene on the PAI
loci. We considered a candidate PAI (cPAI) only if the PAIlike region partly or entirely spans the GI.
