Background: In Drosophila melanogaster, the male seminal fluid contains proteins that are important for
reproductive success. Many of these proteins are synthesised by the male accessory glands and are secreted into
the accessory gland lumen, where they are stored until required. Previous studies on the identification of
Drosophila accessory gland products have largely focused on characterisation of male-specific accessory gland
cDNAs from D. melanogaster and, more recently, Drosophila simulans. In the present study, we have used a
proteomics approach without any sex bias to identify proteins in D. melanogaster accessory gland secretions.
Results: Thirteen secreted accessory gland proteins, including seven new accessory gland proteins, were
identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments. They included
protein-folding and stress-response proteins, a hormone, a lipase, a serpin, a cysteine-rich protein and two
peptidases, a pro-enzyme form of a cathepsin K-like cysteine peptidase and a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Enzymatic
studies established that accessory gland secretions contain a cysteine peptidase zymogen that can be activated at
low pH. This peptidase may have a role in the processing of female and other male-derived proteins, but is unlikely
to be involved in the processing of the sex peptide. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidases are type II integral membrane
proteins; however, the identified AG γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT-1) is unusual in that it is predicted to be a
soluble secreted protein, a prediction that is supported by biochemical evidence. GGT-1 is possibly involved in
maintaining a protective redox environment for sperm. The strong γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity found in the
secretions provides an explanation for the observation that glutamic acid is the most abundant free amino acid in
accessory gland secretions of D. melanogaster.
Conclusion: We have applied biochemical approaches, not used previously, to characterise prominent D.
melanogaster accessory gland products. Of the thirteen accessory gland secreted proteins reported in this study,
six were represented in a D. simulans male accessory gland EST library that was biased for male-specific genes.
Therefore, the present study has identified seven new secreted accessory gland proteins, including GGT-1, which
was not recognised previously as a secreted accessory gland product.

Background
The male accessory glands (AGs) of Drosophila melanogaster are necessary for male fertility [1,2]. They are
responsible for the synthesis and secretion of a large
number of seminal fluid proteins, many of which have
not been structurally or functionally characterised. The
most studied AG products are male-specific proteins
(Acps) that elicit multiple physiological and behavioural
effects in post-mated females [3]. These male influences
include increased rate of egg-laying, reduced attractiveness
to males, rejection of courting males, better sperm storage
and a reduction in female life-span [3]. The altered behaviour of mated females can last up to one week and this
long-term effect is dependent upon transfer of both sperm
as well as seminal fluid. The sex peptide (Acp70A) is partly
responsible for eliciting the short-term female responses
and solely responsible for the longer lasting changes in
post-mated female behaviour [4,5]. The latter effect is
dependent upon the presence of sperm that carry sex peptide bound to the surface of sperm tails [6]. The tethered
sex peptide is slowly-released from the sperm by proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal binding domain from the
C-terminal sequence, which contains the signal for the
post-mating response [7]. A second AG product (ovulin,
ACP26Aa) is also involved in stimulating the early
responses in mated females and appears to have a direct
effect on ovulation [8-10]. Ovulin also undergoes proteolysis in the female reproductive tract to release biologically
active peptides, a process that is dependent upon another,
as yet unidentified, male AG product [11]. Sperm storage
in the post-mated female requires Acp36DE, a 122 kDa
glycoprotein that is processed to a 68 kDa protein in the
female within ten minutes of transfer from the male [1214].
Other seminal fluid proteins that have been studied
include peptidase inhibitors, components of the mating
plug, lipases and anti-bacterial peptides (reviewed in [3]).
An expressed sequence tag screen of a cDNA library prepared from the AGs of D. simulans and purposely enriched
for male-specific cDNAs, indicated that there might be in
total over 70 Acps in this species [15]. Several classes of
enzymes, including lipases and peptidases, were well represented in the D. simulans AG ESTs, as were peptidase
inhibitors and immune defence proteins [16]. This information has led to a re-assessment of the total number of
secreted D. melanogaster Acps, which is now thought to be
52 [17]. However, this number will exclude AG products,
which are highly expressed in female tissues, but are vital
for male reproductive success. Specific antibodies raised
to thirteen D. melanogaster Acps showed that these male
AG proteins have multiple fates once transferred to the
female reproductive tract, with some proteins entering the
female haemolymph [18].

We now report the direct characterisation of protein products of D. melanogaster AGs, which were resolved by 2Dgel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry of
tryptic peptides. This study identifies thirteen AG proteins,
including protein-folding and stress-response proteins, a
lipase, a cysteine-rich protein and two peptidases, a proform of a cathepsin-like cysteine peptidase and a soluble
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Seven of these proteins have
not previously been identified as secreted AG products.
We also show that the AG secretions possess cysteine
peptidase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activities and
that the cysteine peptidase is synthesised primarily as an
inactive zymogen. The cathepsin K-like cysteine peptidase
is a candidate for the processing enzyme responsible for
the delayed cleavage of male proteins and peptides in the
uterus of the post-mated female.

Results and discussion
Identification of secreted AG proteins
AG contents were analysed by 2D-gel electrophoresis; the
first dimension used either pH 3–10 or pH 4–7 IPG strips
(Fig. 1). The gels were Coomassie stained and the most
intense resolved protein spots subjected to trypsin digestion and peptide fragment analysis by either MALDI-MS
or LC-MS/MS. Thirteen AG proteins with predicted signal
peptides for secretion were identified using this method
and their functions were inferred from comparison of the
primary structure to members of protein families with
known biological activity (Table 1). Almost half of these
proteins could be classed as stress response proteins or as
proteins required for the efficient and correct folding of
newly synthesised proteins in the ER lumen. The other
group of proteins contains two peptidases, a lipase, a protein hormone (Acp36DE), a cysteine-rich protein and a
serpin.
Protein folding and stress response proteins
CG2852 (cyclophilin-like) and CG9847 (Fkbp-13) are
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases that catalyse the cistrans isomerisation of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in polypeptide chains. They belong to two different structural classes
that are phylogenetically conserved and are known to
have multiple roles in the folding, assembly and trafficking of cellular proteins [19]. Although considered to be
primarily intracellular proteins, some mammalian cells
secrete cyclophilins into the extracellular environment,
where they have an important role in mediating cellular
responses to oxidative stress and in modulating immunity. CG6988 is a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) that
contains two thioredoxin-like folds and is highly
expressed at all stages of development [20]. The PDI family of proteins catalyse the formation, reduction and isomerisation of disulphide bonds and can protect cells from
hypoxic cell death [21]. Their ability to bind polypeptide
chains allows PDI to act as a molecular chaperone assist-

by functioning as intercellular signalling molecules that
facilitate sperm-oocyte interaction [28-30].

Four other molecular chaperones (CG9429/calreticulin;
CG4147/HSP70-3; CG2918; CG5520/Gp93) were identified in this proteomic study of male AGs. D. melanogaster
calreticulin belongs to the highly conserved family of lectin-like Ca2+-binding ER proteins that have diverse cellular roles in mammals, including regulation of intracellular
Ca2+, the correct folding of glycoproteins, integrin-mediated Ca2+ signalling, phagocytosis and cell adhesion
[22,23]. HSP70-3 is a BiP homologue involved in assembling protein complexes inside the endoplasmic reticulum [24]. Gp93 is a highly conserved heat shock protein
(HSP) of the vertebrate gp96 family of endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Galewsky et al. have reported that Gp93
accumulates at cell borders suggesting that the D. melanogaster protein can be exported from the cell to the extracellular surface [25]. CG2918 is structurally also a
member of the HSP family of proteins with strong homology to mammalian hypoxia up-regulated protein ROP150
[26].

Acp36DE (CG7157), cysteine-rich protein (CG17575) and
serpin-3 (spn-3, CG9334)
Acp36DE (CG7157) has been extensively studied and
shown to be required for sperm storage [12,14,31],
although the mechanism by which this is achieved is not
known. CG17575 has been shown by comparative structural modelling to be a member of the CRISP family
(cysteine-rich secretory protein) [16]. Interestingly, mammalian CRISP-1 is secreted by the proximal epididymis,
binds to the sperm surface, and appears to be involved in
gamete fusion [32]. CRISP-2 is secreted from spermatocytes and facilitates enhanced binding of spermatocytes to
Sertoli cells. Allurin, another CRISP, acts as a sperm chemoattractant produced by female Xenopus as part of the
egg jelly [33]. In addition to these suggested roles in reproduction, CRISP proteins of the CRISP-3 class might also
form part of the innate immune defence system [34].
Antibodies raised to recombinant CG17575 were used in
a recent study to determine the fate of the protein in the
mated female. Western blot analyses suggested a broad
distribution for CG17575 in female reproductive tissues,
including the uterus, oviduct and egg surface [18], consistent with a possible role in gamete fusion.

Five of the aforementioned AG protein-folding and stressresponse proteins possess a K/HDEL C-terminal sequence
(the C-terminus of CG2918 is HSEL) suggesting that these
proteins are resident in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum. However, it is well documented that proteins
entering the secretory pathway can escape KDEL-mediated
endoplasmic reticulum-retention to have a functional role
at the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu [23,27].
Indeed, recent studies have shown that cell-surface chaperone proteins can have important roles in reproduction

Two members (Acp76A and Acp62F) of the serpin family
were previously known to be present in D. melanogaster
AG secretions. The proteomic identification of SPN-3
takes the number of D. melanogaster AG serpins to three
and this number might be an underestimate, since Swanson and colleagues identified six AG serpin genes in D.

simulans, including the orthologue of Spn-3 [15]. The
expression of a number of serpin family genes in the AG
probably reflects the importance to the male of controlling proteolysis by serine peptidases in the seminal fluid
[16]. Evidence for such a role for serpins in animal reproduction comes from studies on male mice lacking the serpins, PCI and nexin-1 [35,36]. These animals display
abnormal spermatogenesis and malformation of the copulatory plug presumably as a result of a failure to control
peptidase activity. Immunological studies on the fates of
D. melanogaster Acps in the female, post-copulation, identified CG9334 in both the mating plug and the sperm
storage organs [18].
Acid lipase (CG31872)
The AGs of D. melanogaster are known to be a rich source
of an acid lipase capable of cleaving triacylglycerol and to
some extent cholesterol esters. Smith et al. showed that
the lipase activity of males was halved after mating,
whereas the activity in mated females was three-times that
of virgin female flies, indicating transfer in the seminal
fluid to the female during copulation [37]. Our proteomics analysis has identified CG31872 as a candidate for this
activity. These enzymes might have an important role in
providing energy for motile sperm by hydrolysing triglycerides to release free fatty acids for β-oxidation. The work
of Mueller et al. [17]identified five acid lipase related AG
ESTs of D. simulans and therefore we might expect additional lipases to be present in the AGs of D. melanogaster.

Procathepsin protein (CG4847) and the demonstration of
pro-form of a cysteine peptidase in AG secretions
CG4847 encodes a protein that structurally belongs to the
papain (C1A) family of cysteine peptidases and is related
to mammalian cathepsin K, L and S (Fig. 2) [38]. CG4847
has a predicted molecular weight of 44 kDa in its unprocessed form and, uniquely for this peptidase family,
posesses a Gly-Gly-Gly-Phe/Leu repeat sequence close to
the N-terminus of the protein. BLAST search of the predicted proteins of the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome
identified GA18475 as a close homologue of CG4847 that
shares 68% identity at the amino acid level. The predicted
D. pseudoobscura also has a Gly/Leu-rich region following
a signal peptide; however this region is shorter than that
in CG4847 (Fig. 2).

Cathepsins are typically synthesised as inactive proenzymes that, under favourable conditions, undergo
intracellular auto-cleavage that removes an N-terminal
pro-domain to generate an active peptidase of around 24
kDa in size [39]. The observation that CG4847 migrates in
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mass of
around 50 kDa and the fact that the peptide mass fingerprint contained five peptides from the predicted prodomain, indicates that the enzyme is secreted with a typical zymogen structure (Fig. 2). We sought enzymatic evidence for the synthesis and secretion of a pro-cathepsin
cysteine peptidase by male AGs. AG contents were incubated in activation buffer, prior to performing a standard
assay for C1A cathepsins using the substrate Cbz-Leu-ArgMCA in a continuous assay for peptidase activity. The
hydrolysis of the substrate was linear with time and was
strongly inhibited by two irreversible inhibitors of
cysteine peptidases (E64 and K11777), all at a concentration of 10 µM (Table 2). Mammalian pro-cathepsin K, like
many other cysteine peptidases, undergoes autoactivation
as a result of a conformational change on lowering the pH
[40]. The induced structural change exposes the pro-cathepsin K active site to increase the susceptibility of the propeptide to cleavage. When the activation procedure for the
AG cysteine peptidase was performed at 4°C rather than
at 35°C, the peptidase activity was greatly reduced (Table
2). This result is consistent with the peptidase being
secreted as a zymogen that can be activated in a temperature-dependent manner at low pH. It is possible that the
activation of the AG cysteine peptidase occurs after insemination by autocatalysis after experiencing a change in pH
in the female reproductive tract or by exposure to another
peptidase either present in the seminal fluid or secreted
from female reproductive tissues.
A potential role for the CG4847 is in the proteolytic
processing of hormone precursors. The predicted protein
is structurally related to mammalian cathepsin L, which in
secretory vesicles of chromaffin cells functions as a pro-

hormone processing peptidase responsible for the production of enkephalin peptides [41]. The cathepsin L
recognises monobasic and dibasic processing sites with
the positively charged side-chains occupying either the S1
or S1' sub-sites. Two D. melanogaster AG prohormones,
ovulin and sex peptide, undergo proteolytic processing in
the post-mated female and in both cases, basic residues
are the cleavage recognition sites [7,11]. CG4847 might
perform a similar prohormone processing role to cathepsin L and be involved in the cleavage of both ovulin and
sex peptide after transfer to the mated female. We have
investigated the possibility that the AG cysteine peptidase
is responsible for the cleavage of the sex peptide by testing
whether the activated enzyme can cleave sex peptide 1–13
(WEWPWNRKPTKFP), which contains two potential prohormone cleavage sites, at the Arg7-Lys8 and Lys11-Phe12
peptide bonds. HPLC analysis with UV detection (280

nm) identified a single major cleavage product that was
identified as WEWPWNRKPTK by MALDI-MS ([M+H]+ m/
z 1528). This hydrolysis was completely blocked in the
presence of 10 µM E64, confirming that the AG cysteine
peptidase activity was responsible. Peng et al. have shown
that the N-terminal region of sex peptide is required for
sperm attachment and for the long-term post-mating
response of females [7]. They have also shown that mutating the Arg7 and Lys8 to Gln7 and Gln8 prevents the release
of sex peptide from the surface of the sperm tail over a 5
day period, which suggests that proteolysis occurs at, or
close to, the dibasic motif. Since the AG cysteine peptidase
activity cleaves Lys11-Phe12, which is four peptide bonds
away from Arg7-Lys8, it is unlikely that the enzyme has a
major role in the processing of the sex peptide in the postmated female.

γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (CG6461, GGT-1) and
detection of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in AG
secretions
CG6461(GGT-1) is predicted to be a 62 kDa γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase (also known as γ-glutamyl transferase) and
a member of the T3 family of threonine peptidases [42].
These enzymes are abundant on the luminal surface of
secretory and absorptive epithelial cells and are responsible for the transfer of γ-glutamate from glutathione
(GSH), glutathione conjugates and glutathione disulphide (GSSG) to an acceptor molecule, which may be
another peptide, an amino acid, or water. The proenzyme
undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to generate the active γglutamyl transpeptidase, comprising two subunits of
around 40 kDa and 20 kDa [43]. The catalytic nucleophile
is the hydroxyl group of the threonine found at the N-terminus of the smaller processed subunit [44]. The AG peptide fragments identified in the present study came from a
protein spot with an estimated size of around 20 kDa and
corresponded to sequences within the predicted smaller
subunit of GGT-1 (Fig. 3). The SignalP 3.0 server predicts
with high probability that GGT-1 is a preproprotein comprising an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion and that
this is cleaved at the Gly30-Leu31 bond to generate a soluble, secreted γ-glutamyl transpeptidase [45]. The predicted
soluble nature of GGT-1 is unusual for members of this
family of enzymes, since eukaryotic γ-glutamyl transpeptidases are typically type II integral membrane proteins
found on the external surfaces of cells [42]. There are three
other γ-glutamyl transpeptidase genes (CG17636,
CG1492 and CG4829) in the D. melanogaster genome, all
of which are predicted by SignalP 3.0 to encode proteins
that conform to a membrane-bound structure. In D. pseudoobscura, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase genes are fewer in
number and the family is represented by one secreted
(GA9613) and only one membrane-bound γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase (GA13353): these are closely related to D.
melanogaster GGT-1 and CG4829, respectively.

We found strong γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (28.1
± 1.7 µmoles of p-nitroanilide released/h/AG; mean ±
standard error of the mean, n = 3) in the Drosophila AG
using γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as the substrate donor and

the dipeptide, Gly-Gly, as the acceptor. There was a linear
increase in enzyme activity, which was absolutely dependent on the presence of Gly-Gly and was inhibited by acivicin (0.4 mM, 98% inhibition), a selective inhibitor of γglutamyl transpeptidase. The AG γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity is not associated with cell membranes since
almost all of the activity of the AG homogenate was found
in the supernatant after centrifugation at 60,000 g for 2 h
(25.1 ± 2.3 µmoles of p-nitroanilide released/h/AG; mean
± standard error of the mean, n = 3).
The identification of a secreted γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
in the AG is of particular interest in respect of redox control during reproduction. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase has a
central position in the 'γ-glutamyl cycle', generating glutamate and Cys-Gly by cleavage of GSH. The dipeptide is
subsequently cleaved to its constituent amino acids [46],
which are taken-up across the plasma membrane and
used in the re-synthesis of intracellular GSH. GSH provides reducing equivalents for the reduction of hydrogen
peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides by glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins, and is required for detoxification reactions carried out by glutathione S-transferases
[47,48]. The maintenance of a high intracellular concentration of GSH is therefore important for preventing
injury to the germ cells by reactive oxygen species and
xenobiotics, and is highly dependent upon the breakdown and recycling of extracellular GSH compounds [48].
The soluble AG γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity provides an explanation for the relatively high levels of free
glutamic acid known to be present in AG secretions of virgin males of D. melanogaster and the rise in uterine glutamate in the post-mated female [49].

Conclusion
Interest in the male AG products of D. melanogaster has
mainly focused on the proteins and peptides that are
responsible for altering the behaviour and physiology of
the post-mated female. There have been few biochemical
studies of AG enzymes that are secreted into the seminal
fluid for transfer to the female, although their importance
for reproduction is recognised. The sequencing of malespecific cDNAs of D. simulans AG gave an indication of the
variety of new proteins that might be present in the seminal fluid of this species and probably other drosophilids.
However, this study was biased against proteins that are
expressed in both adult male and female flies, and did not
shed light on any post-translational modifications that
might be critical for biological activity. We have used the
complementary approach of proteomics to expand our
knowledge of the secreted AG proteins, mainly enzymes
and stress-response proteins, of D. melanogaster. We have
provided enyzmatic evidence for an inactive cysteine protease and a processed and fully active γ-glutamyl

transpeptidase in support of the proteomics data. The
cysteine peptidase might undergo activation in the extracellular environment and, if transferred to the female during copulation, might have a role in the processing of
male derived proteins (e.g. ovulin) in the mated female.
D. melanogaster is amenable to reverse genetic approaches,
which can now be used to determine the importance and
precise role of the identified AG proteins in reproduction.

Methods
Materials
Peptidase substrates and inhibitors, unless otherwise
stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd.,
Poole, U.K. K11777 (N-methylpiperazine-urea-phenylalanine-homophenylalanine-vinylsulfone-benzene) was a
gift from the Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic
Diseases, Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco.

Insects
Oregon R D. melanogaster were maintained on oatmeal/
molasses/agar medium at 25°C with a 12:12 h light/dark
regime [50]. For the collection of AG contents for proteomic and enzymatic analysis, males (3–5 days posteclosion) were separated from females at least 24 h prior
to dissection.
Proteomics
AGs (80 pairs) were excised in ice-cold Drosophila Ringer
solution [51], or 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing
peptidase inhibitors (complete, Mini, EDTA-free, Roche
Diagnostics Ltd, Bell Lane, Lewes, East Sussex BN7 1LG).
The AGs were then centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4°C to separate AG contents from the tissue. The supernatant was
then removed and stored at -20°C until required. Protein
samples were processed using a "2D clean-up kit" (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Pollards Wood, Nightin-

gales Lane, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire). AG
contents were solubilised in rehydration buffer (8 M urea,
4% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% (v/v) "BioLyte" Ampholytes, Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred
Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547 USA) prior to soaking of
either pH 3–10 or pH 4–7 11 cm IPG strip (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing was performed using a PROTEAN IEF cell
(Bio-Rad) for 40000 Vh. The strip was then equilibrated in
two base buffers (50 mM Tris/Cl, 2% (v/v) SDS, 6 M urea,
and 20% glycerol) containing first 1.4 M diothiothreitol
and then 1.3 M iodoacetamide. The second dimension
used precast 8–16% Tris/HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and was run
for 70 min at 200 V. The gel was washed three times for 15
min prior to staining with Coomassie ("biosafe" Bio-Rad)
for 3 h before de-staining with water.
Stained spots of protein were cut using a Proteome Works
spot-cutter (Bio-Rad) before being placed in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate and 50 % (v/v) acetonitrile. The
gel piece was sonicated for 10 min with the supernatant
being removed and discarded. This was repeated before
acetonitrile was added and then the gel was dried. The
trypsin digest was then carried out by adding 5 µl trypsin
solution (2 ng of trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) to the gel piece and allowing it to be absorbed
before addition of another 5 µl of 25 mM ammonium
bicarbonate 30 min later. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37°C.
MALDI-MS was performed using a matrix of 5 mg of αcyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 1 ml ethanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) with the peptide ACTH used as an internal standard. The matrix was then mixed with the sample
in a ratio of 1:1 with 1 µl being spotted onto a MALDI target plate for analysis using MALDI-TOF (Micromass
M@LDI L/R system) to generate a peptide mass fingerprint. The NCBI and MSDB peptide databases were
searched using Mascot http://www.matrixscience.com/
search_form_select.html with, 100 p.p.m. accuracy and
carbamidomethyl transformation selected. Some protein
spots were analysed by LC-MS/MS and the fragmentation
data was used to search the NCBI and MSDB peptide databases using Mascot as described previously [52]

cence emitted during the reaction was measured every 90
seconds in black 96-well microtitre plates (Corning Life
Sciences, High Wycombe, U.K.) at ambient temperature
using a Victor2 fluorometer (PerkinElmer™, Finland) and
an excitation λ of 380 nm and emission λ of 460 nm.
Reaction rates were linear up to 2 h (1 unit of activity is 1
pmol of 7-AMC released/h). Cysteine peptidase activity
towards sex peptide1-13 was performed by incubating the
contents from 50 AGs in 50 µl of activation buffer for 1 h
at 35°C, before adding sex peptide1-13 (50 µM, final concentration). After incubation for 12 h at 35°C, hydrolytic
activity was terminated by lowering the pH to 2 with 5 µl
of 8% (v/v) TFA. Cleavage products were analysed by
reversed phase HPLC using a Phenomenex Jupiter C18
column (5 µm particles, 250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex,
Macclesfield, U.K.) and an elution gradient of 12% acetonitrile rising to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over 25
min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of tryptophan
containing peptides was monitored at 280 nm. The major
product peak was collected and analysed by MALDI-TOF
MS.

γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase activity was assayed using γglutamyl-p-nitroanilide (1 mM) as the γ-glutamyl donor
and the dipeptide Gly-Gly (20 mM) as the acceptor in
Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8) [42]. The release of pnitroaniline was monitored every 10 sec in 96-well plastic
plates (NuncTM, Denmark) using a SPECTRA MAX 340PC
spectrometer (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, U.K.) set
at 410 nm (ε = 8800 M-1. cm-1) and a temperature of
25°C. The reaction rate was linear up to 1 h (1 unit of
activity is 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline released/h). The soluble nature of the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was established by homogenising ten AGs in 200 µl of Ringer's
solution in a glass homogeniser (GPE Ltd., Leighton Buzzard, UK) and centrifuging the homogenate at 60,000 g
for 2 h in a TLA110 Beckman rotor using an Optima Max
Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter UK Ltd, High
Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, U.K.). The enzyme activity
of resulting soluble fraction was compared to the activity
found in a sample of the homogenate taken prior to centrifugation.

Competing interests
Enzyme assays
AG contents were separated from the AG tissue by centrifugation in small volumes of Ringer solution, typically 20
pairs of AGs in 40 µl, at 10 000 g at 4°C. For the determination of cysteine peptidase activity, AG samples were
incubated in activation buffer (100 mM sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.5; 5 mM EDTA; 20 mM cysteine) at 35°C,
either without inhibitor or with one of two cysteine peptidase inhibitors (E64 and K11777). After 1 h, the substrate
(Cbz-Leu-Arg-MCA) was added to a final concentration of
10 µM in 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and the fluores-
