Abstract
Background: Although melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an economically important fruit crop, no genome-wide
sequence information is openly available at the current time. We therefore sequenced BAC-ends representing a
total of 33,024 clones, half of them from a previously described melon BAC library generated with restriction
endonucleases and the remainder from a new random-shear BAC library.
Results: We generated a total of 47,140 high-quality BAC-end sequences (BES), 91.7% of which were paired-BES.
Both libraries were assembled independently and then cross-assembled to obtain a final set of 33,372 nonredundant, high-quality sequences. These were grouped into 6,411 contigs (4.5 Mb) and 26,961 non-assembled BES
(14.4 Mb), representing ~4.2% of the melon genome. The sequences were used to screen genomic databases,
identifying 7,198 simple sequence repeats (corresponding to one microsatellite every 2.6 kb) and 2,484 additional
repeats of which 95.9% represented transposable elements. The sequences were also used to screen expressed
sequence tag (EST) databases, revealing 11,372 BES that were homologous to ESTs. This suggests that ~30% of the
melon genome consists of coding DNA. We observed regions of microsynteny between melon paired-BES and six
other dicotyledonous plant genomes.
Conclusion: The analysis of nearly 50,000 BES from two complementary genomic libraries covered ~4.2% of the
melon genome, providing insight into properties such as microsatellite and transposable element distribution, and
the percentage of coding DNA. The observed synteny between melon paired-BES and six other plant genomes
showed that useful comparative genomic data can be derived through large scale BAC-end sequencing by
anchoring a small proportion of the melon genome to other sequenced genomes.

Background
Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important horticultural
crop grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical
regions worldwide. More than 25 million tonnes of fruit
were produced in 2007, 64.5% in Asia, 14.6% in Europe,
13.1% in America and 7.8% in Africa [1]. Melon belongs
to the Cucurbitaceae family, which comprises 90 genera
and ~750 species, including other fruit crops such as
watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum &
Nakai), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), squash and
pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.). Genetically, melon is a

diploid species (2 × = 2n = 24) with an estimated genome size of 454 Mb [2]. Transgenic melons, first produced in 1990, can now be generated in a range of
recalcitrant cultivars [3,4]. Melon fruits are morphologically and biochemically diverse, which makes them particularly suitable for research into the flavor and texture
changes that occur during ripening [5].
Despite its economic importance, there are few genomic
resources for melon. As of January 2010, 126,940 highquality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and 23,762 unigenes were available in public databases [6,7], which is low
when compared to the 298,123 ESTs available for tomato
(Solanum lycopersicum L.) and the 1,249,110 ESTs available for rice (Oryza sativa L.) [8]. More recent efforts to
increase the availability of genetic and genomic resources
for melon [9] have included the construction of bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries [10,11], the

development of oligo-based microarrays [12,13], the production of TILLING and EcoTILLING platforms [14,15]
and the development of a collection of near isogenic lines
(NILs) [16]. However, the integration of genetic and physical maps is a necessary first step towards sequencing the
melon genome, identifying relevant genes using these to
discover how economically important aspects of fruit
development are controlled [17,18].
Over the last 15 years, several melon genetic maps have
been constructed primarily using randomly amplified
polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
[19-24]. These maps have helped to pinpoint the loci of
some important agronomic traits [25-27], but they are
sparsely populated and the different markers make them
difficult to compare. To address this issue, a genetic map
has recently been constructed by merging several of
those previous genetic maps [6]. In addition, a melon
physical map representing 0.9 × melon genomic equivalents has recently been constructed using both a BAC
library and a genetic map previously developed in our
laboratory [28]. The physical and genetic maps have been
integrated by anchoring 175 genetic markers to the physical map, allowing contigs representing 12% of the
melon genome to be anchored to known genetic loci.
It is important to obtain an accurate, representative
sample of the genome ahead of full genome sequencing
and annotation, and the end-sequencing of large numbers of BAC clones is an efficient strategy to achieve
this goal. BAC-end sequences (BES) generate accurate
but inexpensive genome samples that give a first impression of properties such as GC content, the distribution
of microsatellites and transposable elements, and the
amount of coding DNA [29-31]. However, most BAC
libraries are constructed by digesting DNA with one or
more restriction endonucleases, which introduces a partial bias in coverage because the target sites are distributed in a non-random manner [32]. We therefore
sequenced BAC-ends representing 33,024 clones, half
from a previously described BAC library generated using
restriction endonucleases, but the remainder from a
freshly-prepared random shear BAC library to eliminate
the possibility of bias. We obtained 47,140 high-quality
BES, which were analyzed for GC content, microsatellites, repeat elements and coding regions. A total of
43,224 paired BES were mapped independently onto six
sequenced genomes from other dicotyledonous plant
species to identify regions of microsynteny.

Results and discussion

Non-empty BAC clones containing melon genomic DNA
2
Based on an estimated haploid genome size of 454 Mb [2]

A BamHI BAC library (BCM) had previously been constructed in our laboratory with an average insert size of
139 kb, representing 5.7 genome equivalents of the
melon haploid genome (based on an estimated haploid
genome size of 454 Mb [2]) [11]. In order to increase
the genome coverage and reduce the bias associated
with BAC libraries constructed using non-random DNA
fragments, a second BAC library (RCM) was prepared
using randomly-sheared melon genomic DNA. With
30,720 BAC clones and an average insert size of 120 kb,
this library represents 6.4 genomic equivalents. When
combined, the two libraries represent ~12 genomic
equivalents.
Fingerprinting of clones from the BCM library allowed
the construction of a melon physical map [28]. The analysis of the structure of the BAC contigs revealed a high
proportion of ‘stacked’ contigs, that is, contigs containing regions of depth that exceeded by far the estimated
coverage of the library used (5.7×); in fact, most of the
contigs contained BACs sharing one border, a feature
most probably explained by the unequal use of BamHI
restriction sites during library construction. These data
strongly suggest that the BCM library could be heavily
affected by the non-randomness currently associated to
all libraries constructed by one-enzyme restriction of
genomic DNA. On the contrary, being a random shear
library, RCM should represent more randomly the
melon genome, although some bias produced by
unequal DNA fragmentation cannot be ruled out.
BAC end sequencing

We sequenced the ends of 16,512 BCM BACs and
16,512 RCM BACs, generating 23,878 and 23,262 highquality BES, respectively (Table 2). Together, this
amounted to 47,140 high-quality BES, of which 91.7%
were paired-BES. The average read length was 543 bp,
representing 25.6 Mb of genomic DNA in total or 5.7%
of the genome (using the 454 Mb estimate [2]). The
BES have been deposited in the GenBank databases
under the accession numbers HN291986-HN339125.
As any analysis based on a highly redundant set of
BES would produce unaccurate genomic information,

Sequences obtained by assembly of BCM-BES, RCM-BES or contigs and
singletons from the BCM and RCM assemblies

the BCM and RCM BES were assembled independently
to reduce sequence redundancy. In order to avoid as
much as possible the incorrect assembly of highly repetitive genomic regions, the assembly was performed
using rather strict constraints (see Methods section).
The BCM assembly produced 4,661 contigs with a total
length of 3.1 Mb, as well as 10,747 singletons (5.9 Mb),
whereas the RCM assembly produced 1,488 contigs
(1.2 Mb) as well as 17,618 singletons (9.2 Mb). Although
the numbers of high-quality BES, paired-BES and the
average read length were similar for both libraries, only
45% of the BCM BES remained as singletons after
assembly, compared to 76% of the RCM BES. Furthermore, the average length of contigs comprising two BES
was 631 bp for the BCM assembly and 715 bp for the
RCM assembly. These data support the conclusion that
the RCM BES are more uniformly distributed across the
melon genome than those from the BCM library, as
anticipated from the construction methods. The nonrandom distribution of restriction endonuclease target
sites and cytosine methylation targets has promoted
research into a number of alternative library construction methods, including the random shearing approach
used here and the use of methylation-sensitive partial
restriction digests [32-34].
A final combined set of non-redundant, high-quality
BES (named BCM-RCM) was produced after the crossassembly of the BCM and RCM contigs and singletons.
This contained 33,372 sequences of average length 568
bp and total length 18.9 Mb, grouped in 6,411 contigs
(4.5 Mb) and 26,961 non-assembled BES (14.4 Mb).
Only 997 (15%) contigs were longer than the maximum
BES length (879 bp). The average GC content was

35.2%, similar to previous values from sequenced melon
BAC clones [11,35].
Significantly, the total length of the BCM-RCM assembly was just 430 kb shorter, and contained only 1,142
less sequences, than the global length of the BCM and
RCM assemblies on the whole (Table 2). Thus, almost
no redundancy seems to exist between BES from the
BCM library and those from the RCM library, strongly
suggesting that incorrect assembly of BES from duplicate or repetitive genomic regions should not represent
a significant reason behind the high redundancy
detected when assembling BCM and RCM BES; otherwise, similar levels of redundancy would had been
detected when cross-assembling the BCM and RCM
contigs and singletons, contrary to our results.
Simple sequence repeats

The BCM-RCM sequences were screened for SSRs,
resulting in the identification of 7,198 microsatellites at
least 12 nt in length (1-3 nt repeats) or containing at
least four tandem repeat units (4-6 nt repeats). SSRs
accounted for 130,222 bp (0.7%) of the total BCM-RCM
sequence, which is equivalent to one microsatellite every
2.6 kb (Table 3). Mononucleotide tandem repeats were
the most abundant, accounting for 39.7% of all microsatellites, followed by trinucleotides (27.4%) and dinucleotides (24.2%). The poly(A)/poly(T) microsatellite was the
most common mononucleotide repeat (94.6%) and the
poly(AT) microsatellite was the most common dinucleotide repeat (67.8%). These data confirm previous results
from the analysis of two melon BAC clones [11,36]
although dinucleotide repeats appear to be less abundant in melon than in many other plants, e.g. apple,
tomato, potato, clementine, papaya and banana
[29,31,37-39].
A total of 1,439 (20%) microsatellites were found to be
> 20 nucleotides in length (class I microsatellites) making them good candidates for hypervariable, polymorphic markers. The longest microsatellites repeat
units of 1-4 nucleotides were a 57-bp poly(T) sequence,
a 102-bp poly(AT) repeat, a 465-bp poly(AAT) repeat
and a 172-bp poly(ACAT) repeat. The most abundant
SSRs for each repeat unit category were generally ATrich, although exceptionally the most abundant pentanucleotide repeat was AGCCG/CGGCT (representing 40%
of all pentanucleotide tandem repeats).
The above analysis was also carried out individually on
the BCM and RCM assemblies. When values in Table 3
were normalized relative to the total sequence length of
each assembly, RCM was found to contain 1.2 times
more SSRs than BCM, with some specific cases (namely
C/G, ACAT/ATGT, AGCCG/CGGCT and AATTT/
AAATT repeats) showing a marked increase in the
microsatellite content of RCM relative to BCM (between

Significantly, the number of SSRs longer than 100 nt
was found to be four times higher in RCM than in
BCM while the number of SSRs shorter than 100 nt was
only 1.1 times greater in RCM than in BCM. We therefore conclude that the RCM library represents genomic
regions with a higher content and different distribution
of microsatellites than those covered by the BCM
library.
We validated these results by searching for microsatellites in the melon unigene collection (v3) at ICUGI [6]
using identical search parameters. A total of 7,038 SSRs
was found among 23,762 unigenes spanning 18.5 Mb of
the melon transcriptome. These microsatellites represent
125,363 bp, or 0.7% of the total combined unigene
sequence, a density of one SSR every 2.6 kb. Although
these figures are equivalent to those obtained using the
BCM-RCM assembly, the relative abundance of 1-6
nucleotide repeat microsatellites was quite different,
with trinucleotide repeats the most abundant class
(47%), followed by mononucleotide (24.8%) and dinucleotide (20.7%) repeats. SSR frequency and type are
known to differ between coding DNA, intron DNA and
intergenic DNA [40], and it has previously been shown
that trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant SSRs in
plant coding regions [41].

The BCM-RCM assembly was compared with the plant
repeat databases at http://plantrepeats.plantbiology.msu.
edu/ and also screened using RepeatMasker software to
locate transposable elements, rRNAs and telomereand centromere-related sequences. A total of 2,484
sequences showed homology with plant repeat elements
(representing 6% of the assembly) of which 95.9% were
transposable elements (TEs) (Table 4). Class I transposons (retrotransposons) were the most abundant,
accounting for 85.4% of TEs. Sequences homologous to
retrotransposons were classified as LTR-containing Ty1Copia (61.6%) and Ty3-Gypsy (34.9%), LINES (1.5%)
and other unclassified elements (2%). The next most
abundant repeats were class II transposons, 51% of
which were classified as En-Spm elements. These figures
are similar to those obtained from cucumber, where retrotransposons accounted for 81% of all TEs, the Ty1/
Ty3 ratio is 1.4, and En-Spm elements accounted for
54% of all classified DNA transposons [42]. Other plant
repeat elements included twelve putative rolling-circle
transposons, 105 rDNA sequences and three putative
telomere-related sequences.
The BCM and RCM assemblies were searched independently for plant repeat sequences and the class

I/class II ratio was found to be the same from both
sources. However, some differences were detected
regarding the relative abundance of specific transposon
subfamilies. While En/Spm elements were the most
abundant class II transposons in the RCM assembly,
accounting for 64% of all DNA transposons and followed by MuDR elements (18%), En/Spm transposons
accounted for only 37% of TEs in the BCM assembly,
with MuDRs representing 43% of DNA transposons.
Also, the Ty1/Ty3 ratios were 2 and 1.5 in the BCM
and RCM assemblies, respectively. Significantly, whereas
the RCM assembly contained 84 putative rDNA
sequences, only 29 were found in the BCM assembly.
The genes for the 18S, 5.8S and 25S ribosomal RNAs
are present in tandem arrays containing up to 20,000
repeats in a chromosome structure known as the
nucleolar organizer region [42]. Genomic regions containing highly repetitive sequences arranged in tandem
repeats are often underrepresented in genomic libraries
constructed using one restriction endonuclease. Therefore, our data suggest that the melon RCM library
represents genomic regions not covered or poorly represented by the BCM library.

BCM-RCM non-redundant and masked sequences were
tested against the 23,762 sequences from the melon unigene database v3 [6] using the BLASTN algorithm
(Table 5). Because this approach compares short fragments of genomic DNA against ESTs, the use of stringent match conditions would fail to detect most BES
containing intron-exon boundaries, whereas less stringent conditions would increase the number of false positives. As a compromise, a double cut-off approach was
used with a low-stringency E value of 10-20 and a highstringency value of 10 -50 . The low-stringency search
identified 7,929 matching sequences, with 4,661 showing
> 95% identity to melon unigenes. The remaining
unmatched sequences were then used to search other
cucurbit unigene databases (81,401 unigenes from the
cucumber EST collection v2, and 4,719 unigenes from
the watermelon EST collection v1) [6]. A total of 3,064
additional sequences showed homology to those cucurbit unigene sets. Finally, sequences that failed to match
any cucurbit EST databases were used to search all noncucurbit plant EST assembly databases at http://www.
plantgdb.org and 379 additional hits were found. In all,
11,372 (34.1%) of the analyzed sequences were shown to
contain putative regions of coding DNA. The highstringency search identified 6,630 hits or 19.9% of all
tested sequences. These results suggest that between 20%
and 35% of the melon genome consists of coding DNA.
Melon unigene hits accounted for 72.1% of cucurbit
hits, or 69.7% of all hits, in the low-stringency search,
and for and 77.4% of cucurbit hits, or 76.5% of all hits,
in the high-stringency search. This suggests that the
current melon unigene database at ICUGI lacks 22-30%
of all melon transcripts. Because the melon unigene
database contains 23,762 unigenes, we can tentatively
estimate that the total size of the melon transcriptome
is 27,000-34,000 sequences.
Comparative mapping of melon BES onto other plant
genomes

The analysis of two regions of the melon genome 92 kb
and 215 kb in length has previously revealed significant
degrees of microsynteny between melon and Arabidopsis
thaliana, poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and Medicago
truncatula [11,35]. Syntenic relationships facilitate the
investigation of genome evolution and dynamics, comparative genomics and phylogeny [43,44], as well as
allowing agronomically important genes to be identified
and cloned [45]. For example, the melon nsv locus,
which confers resistance to Melon necrotic spot virus,
was cloned by exploiting synteny [46].
In order to identify regions of synteny between the
melon genome and other sequenced plant genomes, all
47,140 high quality BES were masked for repeats and

A. thaliana, cucumber, soybean (Glycine max), M. truncatula, poplar and grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Only scaffolds > 500 kb in length were used for comparative
mapping in cucumber because the contiguity of the
cucumber genome sequence is currently low. The
cucumber scaffolds represent 149 Mb or 73.4% of the
sequence assembly deposited in the Phytozome database
and 61% of the cucumber genome [47]. As shown in
Table 6, 6-10% of melon BES matched non-curcubit
genomes (9-14% were paired BES), and 65% of melon
BES matched the cucumber genome (67% were paired
BES). A. thaliana showed the lowest number of hits
whereas grapevine, poplar and soybean showed similar
levels. Because only ~70% of the complete cucumber
genome was used, we estimate that more than 90% of
all melon BES would show significant homology to the
whole cucumber genome sequence if available.
Synteny between the melon genome and other plants
was characterized by searching the BCM-RCM sequence
for paired BES that 1) mapped to the same chromosome, 2) within a 50-500 kb region and 3) were oriented
correctly with respect to each other. According to these
criteria, 0.05-0.35% of all paired BES were deemed
potentially collinear with the other plant genomes
(except cucumber, see below). Again, A. thaliana
showed the lowest number of hits (11), followed by
M. truncatula (24), grapevine (56), soybean (57) and
poplar (76). The higher degree of synteny between
melon and poplar compared to melon and M. truncatula, despite the Cucurbitales being considered phylogenetically closer to Fabales than to Malphigiales, is
consistent with previous results from the analysis of two
independent melon regions [35]. In cucumber, 4,138
paired BES (19% of all available paired BES) fulfilled the
three syntenic conditions listed above. However, the
available cucumber genomic sequence is not yet
assembled into chromosomes, and the scaffolds > 500
kb are represented by only ~150 sequences. Therefore, a
significant number of true collinear paired BES could

not be detected due to paired BES mapping into different but adjacent cucumber scaffolds, and so the number
of paired BES potentially collinear with the cucumber
genome is probably much higher than the above value.
When the requirement for correct orientation was
omitted to consider collinear regions that may have suffered localized inversions, there was an increase of
20-56% in the number of paired BES hits. Interestingly,
when considering the total number of paired BES that
map on the same chromosome, the percentage of paired
BES mapping within 50-500 kb is > 40% in all plants
except A. thaliana and M. truncatula. For example, 55%
of all paired BES mapping on the same poplar chromosome do so within the prescribed distance. As poplar
chromosomes are on average 20 Mb in length, these
data show that the mapping loci are not randomly distributed in the poplar genome, which supports our conclusion that our hits reflect true syntenic relationships.
Due to the high synteny degree detected between the
melon and cucumber genomes, the latter was chosen
for an additional synteny analysis performed using the
recently published melon physical map of fingerprinted
BACs from the BCM library [28]. The cucumber genome assembly together with all BCM BES were tested
against the physical map using the draft sequence functions of the FPC software as described in the Methods
section. All 320 physical contigs built from at least 15
BAC clones were analyzed and 37.5% were found to
contain four of more BES mapping in a contiguous
cucumber region greater than 40 kb. A detailed list of
the positive melon FCP contigs, cucumber contigs and
lengths of the detected synteny regions can be found in
the Additional File 1 Table S1. In addition, the SyMAP
software package, whose role is to compute and display
synteny blocks between physical maps and genome
sequences from different species [48,49], was used to
obtain graphical representations of the collinear regions
between melon and cucumber. Figure 1 shows an example of such a synteny region.
Previous results have shown that the network of microsynteny found between melon and the sequenced genomes of A. thaliana, poplar and M. truncatula results

from the polyploid structure of those genomes, which
reflect ancient whole genome duplications [35]. We
therefore determined the number of times each BES
pair generated hits on the same chromosome (Table 6).
In poplar, soybean, grapevine and M. truncatula, each
BES pair fulfilling the first of the syntenic conditions
listed above mapped twice, on average, onto the subject
genome. This fell to 1.3 in A. thaliana but climbed to
4.8 in cucumber. These figures seem to indicate a genome duplication event in a common ancestor of melon
and cucumber as well as another, more ancient event
affecting a common ancestor of all the dicotyledonous
species we analyzed. We also noted that ~83% of
BES pairs mapping to more than one locus mapped to
different chromosomes, suggesting a major role of
whole-genome/chromosomal duplications rather than
intrachromosomal segmental duplications as an explanation for the large number of multiple mapping pairedBES.
The analysis of 348 melon genetic markers suggested
that cucumber chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are collinear with melon chromosomes 2/12, 3/5, 4/6, 9/10, and
8/11, respectively [47]. This suggests that each cucumber chromosome originated from the fusion of two
ancestral chromosomes after cucurbit speciation. Several

interchromosomal and intrachromosomal rearrangements have also been described [47]. Given the high
number of paired melon BES showing collinearity with
the cucumber genome, the data presented here will provide further insight into the dynamic evolution of these
genomes, particularly once the current low contiguity of
the cucumber genome sequence has been addressed.

Conclusion
We have sequenced BAC-ends from 33,024 clones, half
from an existing BAC library produced using restriction
endonucleases and the remainder from a newly constructed random shear BAC library. The resulting
sequences confirmed that the random shear library is
more representative of the melon genome than the
restriction library, with less bias against repetitive DNA
and fewer gaps. The sequences covered ~4.2% of the
melon genome, providing data on the abundance and
distribution of microsatellites, TEs and coding DNA,
and synteny between melon paired-BES and six other
dicotyledonous plant genomes. In particular, we
observed sequence conservation and synteny between
the melon and cucumber genomes. These results
showed that useful comparative genomic information
can be derived using a large scale BAC-end sequencing

genome assembly at Phytozome v5.0. Contig 149 has an estimated size of 514 kb and consists of 19 BACs. There are 28 available BES,
represented as full or empty dots at the end of the BACs; full dots represent BES that map to the selected cucumber region whereas empty
dots represent BES with no hits. Dark violet dots represent BES with BLAST matches against the cucumber sequence. Violet lines connect BES
with the corresponding homologous cucumber regions. Two genetic markers (RFLPs mc268 and mc301) are known to map in the contig 149
region. Green lines show the mapping position of both markers on the cucumber sequence. Additional information regarding the genetic

approach by anchoring a small proportion of the melon
genome to other sequenced genomes.

Methods
Melon genotype and BAC library construction

Young leaves from the double-haploid C. melo subsp.
melo line PIT92 were used for BAC library construction.
The BamHI BAC library (BCM) was previously constructed in our laboratory [11]. It comprises 23,040
clones (average insert size 139 kb, 20% empty clones)
distributed in 60 384-well plates, representing 5.7 genomic equivalents of the haploid melon genome.
A second BAC library (RCM) was constructed by
Lucigen® Co. (Middleton, Wisconsin) using randomly
sheared melon genomic DNA. The resulting fragments

were size selected and inserted into the transcriptionfree BAC vector (Lucigen®). It comprises 30,720 clones
(average insert size 120 kb, 77% clones containing
melon nuclear genomic DNA) distributed in 80 384-well
plates, representing 6.4 genomic equivalents of the haploid melon genome.
BAC-end sequencing

BAC-end sequences representing 16,512 clones from the
BCM library and 16,512 clones from the RCM library
were generated by GATC Biotech (Constance, Germany). The software Phred was used for base calling
and sequence trimming. Vector masking was achieved
using the Sequencher 4.1.1 software package. BAC
clones carrying Escherichia coli genomic inserts or

González et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:618
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/618

melon organellar genomic DNA were removed using
BLASTN similarity searches. BES shorter than 50 bp
were discarded.
BAC-end clustering and assembly

Cleaned, high-quality BES from the BCM and RCM
libraries were clustered independently using the
Sequencher 4.1.1 software package with a minimum
overlap of 80, and a minimum match of 95%. The
resulting assemblies from both sets of BES were jointly
clustered to produce a final set of high-quality and nonredundant sequences. This yielded three sets of nonredundant sequences (referred to as ‘BCM’, ‘RCM’ and
‘BCM-RCM’ sequences) for subsequent analysis.
Analysis of repetitive elements

Non-redundant sequences were scanned for SSRs using
msatcommander 0.8.2. SSRs considered for the final
dataset included 1-3 nt repeats at least 12 nt in length,
and 4-6 nt repeats with at least four unit repetitions.
TEs, telomere-related sequences and rRNAs were identified using RepeatMasker 3.2.8 (parameters: cross-match
search engine, default speed/sensitivity and A. thaliana
DNA source) and the plant repeat databases at http://
plantrepeats.plantbiology.msu.edu/ with a cut-off value
of 1 × 10-20. All identified repeat elements were masked
to produce high-quality, non-redundant and masked
melon genomic sequences.
Identification of coding regions

Non-redundant and masked BCM-RCM sequences were
tested against the 23,762 sequences in the melon unigene
database v3 [6] using E values of 1 × 10-20 and 1 × 10-50.
Sequences that did not match the melon database
were tested against other cucurbit unigene databases
(81,401 unigenes from the cucumber EST collection v2
and 4,719 unigenes from the watermelon EST collection
v1) [6] using the same E values. Sequences with no
matches in any curcubit EST databases were finally
tested against all non-cucurbit plant EST assembly databases found at http://www.plantgdb.org.
Comparative genome mapping

All BES were mapped against the following genome
sequences from the Phytozome v5.0 database http://
www.phytozome.net: A. thaliana (five chromosomes,
TAIR release 9), P. trichocarpa (19 chromosomes, from
JGI, v2), M. truncatula (8 chromosomes, Mt3.0 from
the US/EU M. truncatula Genome Sequencing Project),
G. max (20 chromosomes, from the Soybean Genome
Project, v1), V. vinifera (19 chromosomes, French-Italian
Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization, September 2007 release) and C. sativus (117
scaffolds > 500 kb, Roche 454-XLR assembly). The

Page 9 of 11

homology searches were performed using Discontiguous
Megablast with an E value of 1 × 10-20.
Integration with the melon physical map and
representation of synteny

Cleaned, high-quality BES from the BCM library together
with the cucumber genome sequence assembly were
added to the current C. melo FPC physical map [28]
using the draft sequence functions of the FPC V9.3 software package http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/fpc/
as follows: BSS function using MegaBLAST with E-value
1-20, Identity > 80%, Match > 80%, followed by the Draft
Sequence Integration function with parameters: Window
size, 200 kb, Min Bes Hit, 4, and Top N, 0. Also, the
complete set of BCM BES, the physical map information
and the sequences of genetic markers anchored to the
map were loaded into the SyMAP v3.1 software package
http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap/ to display
areas of synteny between the melon physical map and the
sequenced chromosomes of C. sativus.
