Abstract
Background: Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), also known as catabolite gene activator protein
(CAP), is an important transcriptional regulator widely distributed in many bacteria. The biological
processes under the regulation of CRP are highly diverse among different groups of bacterial
species. Elucidation of CRP regulons in cyanobacteria will further our understanding of the
physiology and ecology of this important group of microorganisms. Previously, CRP has been
experimentally studied in only two cyanobacterial strains: Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena
sp. PCC 7120; therefore, a systematic genome-scale study of the potential CRP target genes and
binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes is urgently needed.
Results: We have predicted and analyzed the CRP binding sites and regulons in 12 sequenced
cyanobacterial genomes using a highly effective cis-regulatory binding site scanning algorithm. Our
results show that cyanobacterial CRP binding sites are very similar to those in E. coli; however, the
regulons are very different from that of E. coli. Furthermore, CRP regulons in different
cyanobacterial species/ecotypes are also highly diversified, ranging from photosynthesis, carbon
fixation and nitrogen assimilation, to chemotaxis and signal transduction. In addition, our prediction
indicates that crp genes in modern cyanobacteria are likely inherited from a common ancestral gene
in their last common ancestor, and have adapted various cellular functions in different
environments, while some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes as well as CRP binding sites during the
course of evolution.
Conclusion: The CRP regulons in cyanobacteria are highly diversified, probably as a result of
divergent evolution to adapt to various ecological niches. Cyanobacterial CRPs may function as
lineage-specific regulators participating in various cellular processes, and are important in some
lineages. However, they are dispensable in some other lineages. The loss of CRPs in these species
leads to the rapid loss of their binding sites in the genomes.

Background
Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), also known as catabolite gene activator protein (CAP), is an important transcriptional regulator widely distributed in a variety of

bacterial groups [1,2]. The biological processes under the
regulation of CRP are highly diverse, including energy
metabolism [3,4], cell division and development [5],
toxin production [1], competence development [6], quoPage 1 of 16

rum sensing [7] and cellular motility [8,9]. CRP belongs
to the CRP/FNR transcription factor (TF) superfamily
[10], which are generally believed to function as global
regulators throughout the eubacteria [11]. Each member
of the CRP/FNR superfamily contains an N-terminal effector binding domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix
(HTH) DNA binding domain (DBD) [12]. The TFs of this
superfamily form a homodimer in vivo, and are activated
by the binding of specific small effector molecules to their
effector binding domains [12]. The CRP dimer is activated
by the binding of two cAMP molecules to the effector
binding domain of each subunit, which causes a conformational change in the DBDs, allowing each to bind to
half of a specific pseudo-palindromic DNA sequence in
the promoters of the genes that are under CRP regulation
[13]. Upon the binding, CRP interacts with the C-terminal
domain of the alpha subunit of the RNA polymerase,
affecting the RNA polymerase binding to the promoter,
and thus leads to the change of the transcription initiation
rate of the target gene [14-18].
The functions of CRP as well as its target genes (the CRP
regulons) have been well studied in E. coli and other heterotrophic bacteria [19], and it seems that all the
sequenced E. coli genomes encode one copy of the crp
gene. CRP in E. coli is characterized as a global regulator,
which controls the expression of more than 200 transcriptional units involved in various important biological
processes of this organism [20,21]. Through decades of
research, 269 CRP binding sites (RegulonDB release 5.8
[21]) in this species have been experimentally identified,
which show a pseudo-palindromic consensus in the form
of TGTGAN6TCACA. More recently, slightly different CRP
binding sites with the consensus TGCGAN6TCGCA were
also identified in E. coli and other γ-proteobacteria [22].
One of the major functions of CRP in E. coli involves the
transcriptional regulation of genes related to organic carbon assimilation and energy metabolism [3,4].
As the life of E. coli and other heterotrophic organisms
relies on the assimilation of organic carbon sources from
the environment, it is not surprising that CRP works as an
important global regulator to coordinate a variety of biological processes in these organisms. Cyanobacteria, on
the other hand, are a group of autotrophic organisms
capable of oxygenic photosynthesis; therefore, they do not
rely on organic carbon source from the environment.
Intriguingly, at least half of the sequenced cyanobacterial
genomes encode at least one copy of the crp gene (see
below). CRP proteins have been experimentally studied in
two cyanobacterial strains, i.e. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
(PCC6803) [8,9,23-26] and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120
(PCC7120) [27,28]. In the PCC6803 genome, the open
reading frame (ORF) sll1371 encodes a homologue to the
E. coli crp gene [23], and has been named sycrp1. It has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/23

been shown that the product of this gene, SyCRP1 forms
a homodimer, which can bind cAMP with high affinity in
vitro [24]. Furthermore, in the presence of cAMP, SyCRP1
could form a complex with DNA that contains the consensus CRP binding site similar to that in E. coli
(TGTGAN6TCACA) [24]. Further studies have revealed
that SyCRP1 was essential for type IV pilus biogenesis and
was involved in cell motility in PCC6803 [8,9,25,29,30].
On the other hand, in the PCC7120 genome two ORFs,
alr0295 and alr2325, were found to encode putative CRPs,
and were named ancrpA and ancrpB, respectively [27].
Equilibrium dialysis measurements showed that both
AnCRPA and AnCRPB (the gene products of ancrpA and
ancrpB respectively) could bind cAMP. Electrophoresis
mobility shift assay (EMSA) further demonstrated that
AnCrpA could bind to the consensus CRP binding site in
E. coli [27]. It has also been reported that both AnCrpA
and AnCrpB are functional in PCC7120, the former regulates the expression of several genes involved in nitrogen
fixation [28], and the latter controls the genes induced by
nitrogen depletion [31]. A few CRP binding sites in these
two genomes have also been experimentally determined,
which were found to form a palindromic motif with the
consensus sequence TGTGAN6TCACA similar to that in
E.coli [25,28]. In addition, the promoter regions of most
of these identified CRP-activated genes in these two
cyanobacterial genomes also contain an E. coli -10 σ70-like
box (TAN3T), located ~22 bp downstream the CRP binding site. These studies also suggested that CRPs in cyanobacteria might regulate a very different set of genes than
those in E. coli. However, a systematic genome-scale study
of the potential CRP target genes as well as CRP binding
sites in cyanobacteria is hitherto lacking. In this paper, we
have predicted the CRP regulons as well as CRP binding
sites in 12 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes that encode
at least one copy of the crp gene using a highly effective
motif scanning algorithm [32,33]. We have also investigated the degradation of the CRP binding sites in the rest
of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes in which the crp
genes were lost during the course of evolution.

in Figure S1 (see Additional file 1), we used SyCRP1 as the
query sequence to search the RefSeq database using
BLASTP with an E-value cutoff 10-7. If there were multiple
hits from a species, the hit with the smallest E-value was
identified as the CRP in that species. The resulting
sequences were used to construct an un-rooted tree in the
similar way as described above. To construct the species
tree, the DNA sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the
sequenced cyanobacteria and that of E. coli K12 were
aligned using ClustalW with manual refinement. After the
indels were discarded, the final alignments contain 1311
positions. A Neighbor-Joining tree of the 16 rRNA gene
sequences was constructed with the E. coli K12 sequence
being the outgroup using Kimura 2-parameter model. Statistical significance at each node in the trees was evaluated
using 1000 bootstrap resamplings.

2. Prediction of operons
We predicted operon structures in each cyanobacterial
genomes using the Operon Finder Software (OFS) developed by Westover et al [34]. OFS predicts operons based
on three pieces of information, including the intergenic
distance, functional relatedness of gene annotations, and
conserved gene neighborhoods. In this study, both a
multi-gene operon and a singleton operon containing
only one gene are referred as a transcription unit (TU).

5. Phylogenetic footprinting and construction of the
profile of CRP binding sites in cyanobacteria
A previous screening of the target genes of SyCRP1 in
PCC6803 using microarray showed that 18 genes in 13
putative TUs were down-regulated in a sycrp1 disruptant
compared with the wild type strain [25]. Our preliminary
manual scanning of the upstream promoter regions of
these TUs revealed that four of them contain a putative
CRP binding site similar to those in E. coli (the first four
TUs in Table 1). The rest nine TUs that do not contain
putative CRP binding sites are likely to be regulated indirectly by CRP through different regulators. In addition,
since the crp gene is auto-regulated in E. coli as well as in
many other species [36], we also manually scanned the
upstream inter-TU region of sycrp1 (sll1371) and identified a putative CRP binding site in it (Table 1). We thus
used the orthologues (if they exist and were identified by
the BDBH method) of these five TUs for the phylogenetic
footprinting of CRP binding sites in cyanobacterial
genomes.

3. Prediction of orthologues
A simple bidirectional best hit (BDBH) approach using
the BLASTP program with an E-value cutoff 10-10 was used
for the prediction of orthologous genes between each pair
of genomes.
4. Phylogenetic analysis
To construct the CRP tree, the full length amino acid
sequences of cyanobacterial CRPs were identified by the
criteria described above using SyCRP1 (sll1371) in
PCC6803 as the query sequence. Multiple sequence alignments of the identified cyanobacterial CRP sequences and
that of E. coli K12 were performed using ClustalW implemented in MEGA [35] with default settings. A neighborjoining (NJ) tree with Poisson correction was constructed
using the MEGA program with the E. coli CRP
(GI:16131236) being the outgroup. To construct the tree

For this purpose, we pooled the entire upstream inter-TU
regions of these five TUs in PCC6803, as well as those of
TUs containing their orthologous genes in other cyanobacterial genomes which encode at least one crp gene.
Motif finding programs including CUBIC [37] and BioProspector [38], were then applied to predict CRP binding

sites in these sequences. CUBIC is a graph theoretic based
algorithm that identifies highly similar k-mers in a set of
pooled sequences; while BioProspector uses a Gibbs sampling strategy to find overrepresented k-mers in a set of
pooled sequences. Putative CRP binding sites with high
scores were manually picked up from the motif finding
results, and were used to build a preliminary profile of the
CRP binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes.
Since the number of binding sites used to construct the
preliminary profile of CRP binding sites was relatively
small (for the reason, see the Results section), in order to
minimize possible bias of binding site sampling, we conducted a one-round iteration to obtain a more representative profile of the CRP binding sites. To this end, we
scanned cyanobacterial genomes with the preliminary
profile using the techniques described below, and picked
the high scoring sites from each genome to construct the
more representative profile of the CRP binding sites. We
then used this final profile for genome-scale predictions
of CRP binding sites in the cyanobacterial genomes.
6. Genome-wide prediction of CRP binding sites
The whole genome screening of all possible CRP binding
sites were performed using an algorithm that we have
developed previously [32]. The design of this algorithm is
to enhance the prediction specificity by integrating the
information of co-occurrence of multiple binding sites in
the upstream region of a gene and that in the upstream
regions of its orthologues in related genomes. Briefly, the
final profile of the CRP binding sites obtained above was
first used to scan all the inter-TU regions of the cyanobacterial genomes. The best motif was returned for each interTU region. Then the 19 to 31 bp downstream region of
each putative binding site was further scanned for an E.
coli -10 σ-70 like box (TAN3T) using a corresponding profile that we have constructed previously from cyanobacterial genomes [32], to which a σ-factor of RNA polymerase
is likely to bind to transcribe the downstream TU. Then,
the upstream inter-TU regions of the orthologues of the
genes in that particular TU in other cyanobacterial
genomes were scanned for similar CRP binding sites and
-10 like boxes. A score that combines these three pieces of
information was computed to rank the putative CRP
binding sites for each possible CRP-regulated TU.

sequence with the same length as I U( g1 ,..., g n ) from the coding region, denoted as C U( g1 ,..., g n ) . We say that I U( g1 ,..., g n )
and C U( g1 ,..., g n ) are associated with U(g1, ..., gn) and with
each genes g1, ..., gn as well. All the extracted I U( g1 ,..., g n )
from one genome are denoted as set IU, and all the

C U( g1 ,..., g n ) in the same genome are denoted as set CU. For
each t ∈ IU or t ∈ CU, we scan for possible CRP bindings
sites using the profile M. The score of a putative binding
site found in t by scanning with profile M is defined as,

computing p(i, b), a pseudo count 1 is added to the frequency of each base at each position, and a is for normalization to keep Ii within the range of [0,1].

genomes G1 ,..., G mi , we denote ok(gi) as the inter-TU
sequence upstream the TU containing gi 's orthologue in

is also considered, the score of co-occurrence of the multiple binding sites in t is redefined as

7. Statistical evaluation of the predicted binding sites
We evaluated the statistical significance of our predictions
by comparing the probability of finding a high scoring
binding site in inter-TU sequences with that of finding the
same high scoring binding site in randomly extracted coding sequences [32,33]. Let p(St>s) be the probability that
an extracted sequence t (t ∈ IU or t ∈ CU) contains a putative binding site with a score (St) larger than s. To avoid
possible biased sampling, 300 Cus for each TU in each
genome were randomly generated, and SCu was computed
for each Cu. Then a log-odd ratio (LOR) function defined
as following was used to estimate the confidence of the
prediction:

helix

LOR( s) = ln

p(S IU > s)

p(SCU > s)

.

(6)

Since p(S CU > s) is the probability of type-I error for testing the null hypothesis that Iu does not contain a binding
site when S I U is greater than a cutoff s, we used it to estimate the false positive rate of the prediction results. In this
way, p(S CU > s) could be also considered as an empirical

c

p-value, and a cutoff of p < 0.01 was used for the CRP
binding site prediction in each genome.

1. Conservation of the DBDs of the CRP proteins in
cyanobacterial genomes
Using the BDBH algorithm and the criterion described in
Methods, we identified orthologues of SyCRP1 (sll1371)
of PCC6803 in 12 of the 29 sequenced cyanobacterial
genomes. All these 12 genomes encode one SyCRP1
homologue, with the exception that the PCC6803 and
PCC7120 genomes contain two: sll1371 and sll1924
(SyCRP2) in PCC6803, and alr0295 (AnCRPA) and

alr2325 (AnCRPB) in PCC7120, which are identified by a
unidirectional BLASTP search using SyCRP1 of PCC6803
as the query and an E-value cutoff 10-20. The phylogenetic
tree of these 12 CRP orthologues shows that they fall into
two distinct groups (Figure 1a). There are clear subtle differences between the DBDs of the two groups. Nonetheless, the residues of the DBD that are in direct interaction
with the DNA counterpart as revealed by the crystal structure of E. coli CRP/DNA complex [39], are highly conserved in all these cyanobacterial CRP sequences,
suggesting that they might bind to similar DNA sequences
(Figure 1b).
2. Profiles of the CRP binding sites predicted by
phylogenetic footprinting
When the 18 genes located in the five TUs (Table 1) in
PCC6803 that are likely to be regulated by SyCRP1 in this
species, are searched against the 12 cyanobacterial
genomes that encode crp genes, we found a total of 30
orthologues in five genomes. These 30 orthologous genes
are located in a total of 10 TUs in these five genomes, indicating that these TUs are not well conserved in these 12
genomes. By using the phylogenetic footprinting techniques (see Methods), we predicted a total of eight putative CRP binding sites from the 10 upstream inter-TU
regions, suggesting that the CRP binding sites are largely
shared by these orthologous genes. In order to increase
the representation of the profile of the CRP binding sites
and to minimize the possible bias of our original choice
of the five TUs, we performed a one-round iteration of
putative CRP binding site scanning using this preliminary
profile constructed from these eight putative CRP binding
sites (see Methods). From this preliminary whole genome
scanning results, we selected a total of 112 putative CRP
binding sites (Table S1 in Additional file 2) with high
scores to construct the final profile of CRP binding sites.

These sites display a strong pseudo-palindromic structure
with consensus TGTGAN6TCACA (Figure 1c), which is
similar to the canonical CRP binding sites in E. coli, suggesting that the pattern of CRP binding sites is well conserved between cyanobacterial and E. coli. This result is
also in agreement with the observation that the binding
sites of members of the CRP/FNR superfamily maintain a
high level of conservation across difference lineages [40].
3. Genome-wide prediction of CRP binding sites in the 12
cyanobacterial genomes
We then apply our motif scanning algorithm to predict
putative CRP binding sites in the 12 cyanobacterial
genomes that encode a crp gene using the profile of the
112 putative CRP binding sites as well as that of the previously prepared -10 like box from cyanobacteria [32]. The
log-odds ratio (LOR) function of the predictions in each
genome is all high when the score s is high (Figures 2),
suggesting that these genomes are likely to contain functional CRP binding sites. The predictions in each of the 12
genomes at p-value < 0.01 are listed in Tables S3-S14 in
Additional file 2, and all the prediction results are available upon request. In general, all these predicted CRP promoters contain a pseudo-palindromic CRP binding site
and most of them also contain a downstream TA-rich σfactor binding site, therefore they are likely to be true CRP
promoters. As shown in Table S12 (see Additional file 2),
the five CRP binding sites associated with the five TUs
(shown in bold) in PCC6803, which we selected as the
starting point of the our genome-wide prediction, were
not necessarily ranked very high (they were ranked 4th,
12th, 14th, 17th, and 43rd) among the 59 predicted CRP
binding sites in that genome, suggesting that our initial
choice of the five TUs did not bias our prediction to them.
Table 2 summarizes the predictions in the 12 cyanobacte-

Distribution of shared putative CRP-regulated genes in sequenced cyanobacterial genomes

Distribution of shared putative CRP-regulated genes in sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. Only two representative examples from PCC6803 and PCC7120 are shown for clarity. The horizontal axis is the number of genomes that share
putative CRP-regulated genes with PCC6803 or PCC7120, and the vertical axis is the number of shared genes. Among the 149
predicted CRP-regulated genes (at p < 0.01) in PCC6803, 117 (75%) are species specific, and the rest 32 (25%) are shared with
other genomes; of the 442 predicted CRP-regulated genes (at p < 0.01) in PCC7120, 224 (50.7%) are species specific, and the
rest 318 (49.3%) are shared with other genomes, most of which (191) are shared with the closely related ATCC29413
genome.

dicted by the algorithm described in Methods), and that
some of these cyanobacterial genomes contain much
more TUs/genes (Table 2) than the E. coli K12 genome
does. This result suggests that cyanobacterial CRPs might
regulate fewer genes than the E. coli CRP does. We then ask
whether the target genes of CRPs are conserved between E.
coli and cyanobacteria, as well as among the 12 cyanobacterial genomes, given that the DBDs of CRPs as well as
their binding sites are highly conserved.
Although these 12 cyanobacterial genomes share
13.88~32.19% of their genes with E. coli (Table 2), they
almost have no common genes in their CRP regulons with
that of E. coli K12 (Tables 3, and S3-S14 in Additional file
2), suggesting that the CRPs in cyanobacteria have
adapted to regulate very different sets of genes than those
in E. coli during the course of evolution. On the other
hand, the majority of the CRP targets in these cyanobacterial genomes are not conserved either, rather, only a small
portion of the CRP targets are shared by more than 2 of
the 12 cyanobacterial genomes (Figure 3), even though
our motif scanning algorithm might be biased toward the
genes that have orthologues in reference genomes (see
Methods). In the extreme cases, many CRP targets are species or lineage specific, suggesting that the targets of CRP
have changed very rapidly since the speciation of these
cyanobacterial genomes. For example, only 32 out of the
149 putative CRP target genes in the PCC6803 genome
are conserved in at least 2 of the 12 cyanobacterial
genomes. The only exception is the PCC7120 genome in
which the number is 218 out of 442. However, this is
largely because the reference genomes include a closely
related species ATCC29413. Moreover, the most conserved putative CRP-regulated genes are only shared by
five genomes (Figure 3). In addition, 17 of the 29
sequenced cyanobacterial genome do not encode the crp
gene, suggesting that CRP is not required for the life of
these 17 organisms; alternatively, the function of CRP in
these organisms have been replaced by another TF.
4. Functional classification of CRP regulons in
cyanobacteria
Based on the functional annotations of the CRP target
genes that we have predicted in this study, CRP seems to
be involved in a rather diverse spectrum of functions in
cyanobacteria (Table 4) as summarized below.
4.1. Photosynthesis and carbon fixation
Various numbers of genes involved in photosynthesis and
carbon fixation were predicted to bear a CRP-regulated
promoter in the 12 cyanobacterial genomes that encode
crp genes. Specifically, a total of 14 (at p < 0.01) photosystem I and II reaction center genes were predicted to be regulated by CRP, including AM1_0526, asr0847, Ava_4451,
Ava_0640, asr0847, CYA_0295, CYB_2824, PMT1665,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/23

P9303_22121, P9303_22711, Syncc9605_1640, sll0634,
slr1739, and Tery_4669. Several carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism protein ccmK genes, including
alr0317-0318 and slr1838-slr1839, were also predicted to
bear a CRP binding site. Moreover, putative CRP-regulated promoters were found for the phycobiliprotein family light-harvesting genes, including alr0523-0525,
sll1577-1580, ssl3093, slr1459 and tsr0033. In consistent
with these results, it has been previously shown that cellular cAMP levels change significantly in response to environmental stimuli such as light-dark cycle [41]. Thus
cyanobacterial CRPs are likely to participate in photosynthesis pathways.
4.2. Nitrogen assimilation
Three nitrogenase related proteins AM1_2462, Ava_4669
and alr0874 in MBIC11017, ATCC29413, and PCC7120,
respectively, were predicted to be CRP-regulated. Furthermore, an operon encoding a nitrate transporter (all33323335) in PCC7120 was predicted to bear a CRP binding
site. It has been previously reported that nitrogen starvation resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in intracellular cAMP
level in Anabaena variabilis [42,43]. Based on our prediction results, a possible scenario for a role of CRP in the signaling pathway of nitrogen assimilation could be as
follows. Nitrogen starvation somehow increases the adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to an increase in the intracellular cAMP level. The activation of CRP by cAMP then
lowers the transcription level of genes such as nitrate
transporter (all3332-3335), while it enhances the expression of genes like alr0874 (nitrogenase reductase) and
nitrogenase (AM1_2462, Ava_4669), as the cell switches
to the more energy intensive nitrogen fixation of nitrogen
gas. Nonetheless, an in-depth study is needed to elucidate
the details of the role that CRP may play in nitrogen fixation in these cyanobacteria. Since not all cyanobacterial
species are capable of nitrogen fixation, this role of CRP is
unique to the cyanobacterial species capable of nitrogen
fixation, such as MBIC11017, ATCC29413, and
PCC7120.
4.3. Transporters and porins
A few genes coding for transporters and porins were predicted to be CRP-regulated, including several ion transporter in PCC7120 (alr2210-2213 and alr2118-2120) and
PCC6803 (slr1392 and slr1950). Besides, several antiporters and ABC transporters were also predicted to be CRPregulated in various genomes, e.g. CYA_2315, Ava_0687,
sll0240, slr1452-1457, tll0559.
4.4. Kinases and two-component signal transduction systems
Dozens of genes coding for kinases and two-component
signal transduction systems were predicted to be CRP-regulated, suggesting that CRP might play an important role
in response to environmental changes in cyanobacteria.

Interestingly, it has been reported that the CRPs in
PCC6803 are involved in phototaxis as both sycrp1 and
adenylyl cyclase mutants showed impaired phototaxis
[9,29]. However, the genes that are involved in signal
transduction for pilus assembly and phototaxis, as listed
in [29], were not predicted to be CRP-regulated by our
algorithm, therefore, they might be regulated by CRP indirectly.
4.5. Other functions unique to a species/lineage
Among the top hits of our prediction results, a large portion of putative CRP-regulated genes are species or lineage
specific. The functions of these genes vary from genome to
genome, such as the type IV pilus synthesis in PCC6803
(slr1667-1668 and slr2015-2018) and MBIC11017
(AM1_3323-3324); various transposase in PCC7120
(all3624), BP-1 (tll2385) and IMS101 (Tery_0925); methyltransferase in MBIC11017 (AM1_5474); aldo/keto
reductase in A/B-Prime (CYA_0976 and CYB_2928); nblA
in BP-1 (tsr0033); TPR repeat containing protein in
ATCC29413 (Ava_3483); peptidase in MIT9313
(PMT1940); nuclease in CC9311 (sync_1258), etc. However, the functions of many other species or lineage specific putative CRP-regulated genes are largely unknown,
most of them are annotated as hypothetical proteins, such
as slr0442, sll1268, ssr2848 and sll1924 in PCC6803,
asr4669 in PCC7120, AM1_3950-3951, AM1_4103,
AM1_4957 and AM1_2209-2210 in MBIC11017,
CYA_0127/CYB_2776 in A/B-Prime, Tery_2530 and
Tery_1044 in IMS101, Ava_3757 in ATCC29413,
PMT1492, and PMT1223 in MIT9313, P9303_06191,
P9303_04111 and P9303_12031 in MIT9303, sync_093,
and sync_1261 in CC9311, and Syncc9605_0955 and
Syncc9605_0452 in CC9605. It would be interesting to
experimentally characterize the functions of these genes as
well as the roles that CRP plays in their transcriptional regulation.
5. crp genes were lost in some cyanobacterial genomes
during the course of evolution
The presence of crp genes in some, but not all cyanobacterial genomes, raised the question about their evolutionary
origin: are crp genes in cyanobacteria acquired through
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from other species, or are
they vertically inherited from their last common ancestor,
but lost in some cyanobacterial species/strains? To
address this question, we constructed a species tree of the
29 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes based on their 16S
rRNA gene sequences (Figure 4). Although some nodes in
the tree are not well supported by the currently available
sequence data, the relationships of the species in the tree
are in excellent agreement with a previously inferred
cyanobacterial species tree [44]. As shown in Figure 4, the
genomes encoding a crp gene do not form a particular
monophyletic group, rather, they are sporadically scat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/23

tered across the tree. On the other hand, all the known
cyanobacterial CRPs form a monophyletic group (Figure
S1 in Additional file 1), suggesting that they are likely
derived from a common ancestor. Therefore, the current
sporadic distribution of the crp genes within the
sequenced cyanobacteria likely resulted from differential
gene losses during the course of evolution. Independent
acquisition of the crp gene by individual cyanobacterial
lineage/species, though theoretically possible, is less parsimonious since it would entail multiple HGT events from
the same or closely related donors. Therefore, we conclude that the 17 cyanobacterial genomes that do not
encode a crp gene actually lost their original ones during
the course of evolution to adapt to their respective environments. It is interesting to note that most of the species
lacking a crp gene belong to marine cyanobacteria; these
species often have a reduced genome and inhabit a relative stable oligotrophic environment. On the other hand,
the species that contain a crp gene are distributed in both
fresh water and terrestrial environment. This again suggests that the crp gene might be beneficial to the species
that live in a variable environment, and those that have
adapted to a more stable environment such as oligotrophic ocean lost their crp genes.
6. Degradation of CRP binding sites in cyanobacterial
genomes after the crp genes were lost
We have previously shown that when a genome lost a TF
in the course of evolution, then it would rapidly lose its
cognate biding sites in inter-TU regions [32,33]. To extend
this conclusion, we applied our CRP binding site prediction algorithm to the 17 cyanobacterial genomes that do
not encode a CRP orthologue. Indeed, in four genomes,
namely, CC9902, RCC307, WH8102 and WH7803 (Figures S2 in Additional file 3), the LOR function oscillates
around zero as the score s increases, indicating that there
is no significant difference between the signal of CRP
binding sites in the inter-TU regions and that in the randomly selected coding regions (see Methods). These
results strongly suggest that these four genomes are
unlikely to contain functional CRP binding sites, which is
in agreement with our previous observation [32,33].
However, there is a clear CRP binding site signal in the rest
of 13 genomes as indicated by their relatively high LOR
when the score s is high, suggesting that there exist CRPlike binding sites in the inter-TU regions in these
genomes. The reason for this unexpected observation is
unknown, but one explanation would be that these sites
are bound by a different regulator in these genomes. To
identify possible TFs in these genomes that are likely bind
these CRP-like binding sites, we analyze the distribution
of the CRP/FNR superfamily in these genomes, and found
that they all encode at least one member of the superfamily, which are likely to recognize these CRP-like binding sites, as it has been shown that members of the CRP/

Discussion

2. The functions of CRP in cyanobacteria are highly diverse
It has been reported that SyCRP1 regulates the cellular
motility in PCC6803, as sycrp1 disruptants were devoid of
mobility and showed reduced type IV pilus biogenesis [8].
In another study, it was shown that the operons slr1667slr1668 and slr2015-slr2018 in PCC6803, which are
involved in type IV pilus biosynthesis [29,45], were downregulated in sycrp1 disruptants using microarray gene
expression profiling [25]. In consistent with these findings, we have predicted putative CRP binding sites for
these genes. However, the slr1667-slr1668 genes were
unique to PCC6803, and the orthologues of slr2015slr2018 could only be found in MBIC11017 (Table S2 in
Additional file 2) among the 29 cyanobacterial genomes.
Thus, this function of CRP is likely to be restricted to these
two species/strains only. In addition, based on our predictions of CRP regulons in the 12 cyanobacterial genomes,
we argue that CRP might be also involved in other functions in different cyanobacterial lineage/strains, including
carbon fixation, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, ion
channels/transporters, and two-component signal transduction, etc. (Table 4, Table S3 – S14 in Additional file 2).
Furthermore, as a large portion of our predicted CRP
binding sites are associated with hypothetical proteins,
CRP might be involved in the regulation of the other
novel functions yet to be discovered. In this regard, we
have provided a set of candidates for further experimental
characterization. However, due to the lack of sufficient
information about the functions of the CRP target genes,
it is currently rather difficult to derive a general pathway
model involving CRP regulons in cyanobacteria. Lastly,
AnCrpA was shown to regulate the expression of genes
related to nitrogen fixation in PCC7120 [28], including
all1517 (nifB), all1439, all1432 (hesA), alr2515 (coax-II),
and alr2834 (hepC). However, our algorithm failed to find
high scoring CRP binding sites for all these genes, the possible reasons for this are addressed below.

1. CRP is a lineage-specific global regulator
Studies have shown that CRP in E. coli functions as an
important global regulator controlling the expression of
genes involved in many pathways such as the carbon and
energy metabolism pathways. It was also reported that
CRP regulates a variety of genes in other bacterial species.
For instance, one recent study showed that CRP-like protein regulates genes involved in quorum sensing, motility
and intestinal colonization in Vibrio cholerae [7]. In this
study, we suggest that CRP in cyanobacteria seems to have
distinct functions. First, our results show that the members of the CRP regulons in cyanobacteria have little in
common with those in E. coli (Table 3), which is consistent with the observation that genes whose expression is
mostly affected by sycrp1 disruption in PCC6803 are
involved in the type IV pilus synthesis [8,25,29]. In contrast, genes that are involved in carbon and energy metabolisms as seen in E. coli are not significantly affected by
sycrp1 disruption [8,25,29]. Second, cyanobacterial CRPs
seem to regulate distinct sets of genes specific to each lineage or strain as we can not clearly identify a particular set
of genes common to most of the 12 cyanobacterial
genomes that are under CRP control (Figure 3, Table S2 in
Additional file 2). Third, more than half (17) of the 29
completely sequenced cyanobacterial genomes do not
encode a CRP orthologue, suggesting that CRP is dispensable in these strains/species. For a closely related group of
species, it is unlikely that an essential global regulator can
be replaced or lost in some genomes while present in the
others. Therefore, we conclude that CRP is not a global
regulator with conserved functions; instead, it is likely a
lineage-specific global regulator.

In fact, it has been shown that global regulators are not
necessarily conserved in moderately related species. For
instance, among the 7 and 6 global regulators in E. coli
and B. subtilis, respectively, none of them is in common
[11]. Furthermore, it is not surprising that CRP in cyanobacteria does not function as a conserved global regulator
as seen in E. coli, given that CRP is mainly involved in the
transcriptional regulation of genes related to carbon
metabolism in E. coli, while organic carbon assimilation is
no longer a constraint for the growth of autotrophic
cyanobacteria. On the other hand, since nitrogen assimilation is a constraint for cyanobacteria, the nitrogen
assimilation regulator, NtcA, a member of the CRP/FNR
family, which is unanimously encode in all the 29
sequenced genomes, has been characterized as one of the
conserved global regulators in cyanobacteria. Thus, it
seems that global regulators are often lineage-specific and

3. Binding sites of AnCRPA in Anabaena sp. PCC7120
Our failure to identify high scoring CRP binding sites in
the upstream regions of these nitrogen fixation genes in
PCC7120 is actually in agreement with the finding by
Suzuki and coworkers who suggested that AnCrpA might
have a different binding site pattern from the conventional pseudo-palindromic motif [28]. However, an in
vitro binding affinity test using EMSA showed that
AnCrpA could bind to the conventional palindromic
motif [27]. Thus, a possible explanation of this inconsistency would be that AnCrpA in PCC7120 could form a
monomer or a heterodimer in addition to a homodimer,
given that two CRP homologues are encoded in this

Page 13 of 16

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:23

genome, and one of them does not have a DBD. Such a
monomer or heterodimer might favor a non-canonical
CRP binding site, while the homodimer remains its ability
to bind to the conventional palindromic motif. Clearly, a
more in-depth study on this topic is needed to verify this
hypothesis. This explanation is in agreement with the
results that our algorithm predicts many CRP binding
sites for other genes in PCC7120 with statistical significance (Table S7 in Additional file 2).
4. Origin of crp genes in cyanobacteria and implications
for the evolution of CRP regulatory networks in bacteria
Because the crp gene is widely distributed in many distantly related bacterial groups, including actinobacteria,
aquificales, bacteroidetes, chlamydiae, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, deinococci, firmicutes, fibrobacteres, planctomycetes, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, etc. (Figure S1 in
Additional file 1), it was likely present in the common
ancestor of the extant eubacterial lineages. Under this scenario, the crp gene in this ancestor was flexible enough to
regulate different sets of genes. Alternatively, it is also possible that the crp gene originally evolved in a specific bacterial lineage and was subsequently spread to other groups
via HGT. Such HGT events may benefit the recipient
organism given the flexibility of CRP in regulating different biochemical activities, which are often coupled to
environment stimuli leading to the generation of intracellular signaling molecule cAMP. Therefore, the crp gene in
the ancestor of modern cyanobacteria was acquired by
either vertical inheritance or an ancient HGT event from
other lineages. Some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes
since harboring the gene might not necessarily increase
their fitness in their new environments. On the other
hand, in other cyanobacteria, the crp genes were adapted
to better meet their unique physiology and environmental
requirements. In other groups of bacteria, crp evolved to
regulate other lineage/species specific functions. For
instance, it regulates the carbon and energy metabolisms
in E. coli, cell-cell communication in Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia [46], and quorum sensing in Vibrio cholerae [7],
etc
5. Rapid degradation of CRP binding sites
Evolution of cis-regulatory binding sites is an interesting,
but not well-studied problem. The 17 cyanobacterial
genomes that do not encode a CRP orthologue provided
us an excellent opportunity to examine the degradation of
the CRP binding site in these genomes. It was expected
that high scoring CRP binding sites do not present in
those genomes, as previous studies have indicated that
binding sites rapidly fade out when the corresponding TF
was lost during the course of evolution [32,47]. We do see
such fading in the CC9902, RCC307, WH7803, and
WH8102 genomes (Figure S2 in Additional file 3). These
observations were in consistent with the well-accepted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/23

rule that "if no such a TF in a genome, then no corresponding binding sites in the genome". However, surprisingly, in the rest 13 genomes, high scoring CRP-like
binding sites seem to appear in the inter-TU regions with
a higher probability than in the randomly selected coding
regions (Figure S2 in Additional file 3), suggesting that
there exist sequence patterns similar to CRP binding sites
in these cyanobacterial genomes. A possible explanation
of this unexpected observation would be that there exist in
these genome TFs that recognize binding sites similar to
CRP binding sites. Indeed, at least one member of the
CRP/FNR superfamily is encoded in these 13 genomes,
and it has been shown that the binding sites of the members of this TF superfamily are well conserved across many
species with a wide range of evolutionary distance [40].
Thus, the CRP-like binding sites found in these genomes
are likely to be recognized by these non-CRP TFs of the
superfamily. The specificity of these similar binding sites
is likely to be achieved through the competition among
homologous TFs for the same binding site, which is governed by their thermodynamic equilibrium [48].

Conclusion
In this paper, we have predicted CRP binding sites in 12
cyanobacteria genomes that encode a CRP orthologue
using a highly accurate motif scanning algorithm. Based
on the analysis of these predictions as well as experimental data available to us, we conclude that 1) CRP has rather
different functions in cyanobacteria than in E. coli; 2)
cyanobacterial CRP also has a very diverse spectrum of
functions in different lineages or species/stains, and is
even dispensable in some species/strain; 3) CRPs in modern cyanobacteria are likely to be vertically inherited from
their last common ancestor, and some cyanobacteria lost
their crp genes during the course of evolution to adapt to
their new environments; and 4) once the crp gene is lost,
its binding sites degrade rapidly. Although many of our
predictions still await experimental verification, we
should have provided a high quality candidate set for further experimental characterization of the CRP binding
sites and regulons in this important group of bacteria.
