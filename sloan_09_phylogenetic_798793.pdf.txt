Abstract
Background: Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed that the mitochondrial genome of the
angiosperm Silene noctiflora (Caryophyllaceae) has experienced a massive mutation-driven
acceleration in substitution rate, placing it among the fastest evolving eukaryotic genomes ever
identified. To date, it appears that other species within Silene have maintained more typical
substitution rates, suggesting that the acceleration in S. noctiflora is a recent and isolated
evolutionary event. This assessment, however, is based on a very limited sampling of taxa within
this diverse genus.
Results: We analyzed the substitution rates in 4 mitochondrial genes (atp1, atp9, cox3 and nad9)
across a broad sample of 74 species within Silene and related genera in the tribe Sileneae. We found
that S. noctiflora shares its history of elevated mitochondrial substitution rate with the closely
related species S. turkestanica. Another section of the genus (Conoimorpha) has experienced an
acceleration of comparable magnitude. The phylogenetic data remain ambiguous as to whether the
accelerations in these two clades represent independent evolutionary events or a single ancestral
change. Rate variation among genes was equally dramatic. Most of the genus exhibited elevated
rates for atp9 such that the average tree-wide substitution rate for this gene approached the values
for the fastest evolving branches in the other three genes. In addition, some species exhibited major
accelerations in atp1 and/or cox3 with no correlated change in other genes. Rates of nonsynonymous substitution did not increase proportionally with synonymous rates but instead
remained low and relatively invariant.
Conclusion: The patterns of phylogenetic divergence within Sileneae suggest enormous variability
in plant mitochondrial mutation rates and reveal a complex interaction of gene and species effects.
The variation in rates across genomic and phylogenetic scales raises questions about the
mechanisms responsible for the evolution of mutation rates in plant mitochondrial genomes.

Background
Substitution rates in plant mitochondrial genomes are
generally low relative to their nuclear and chloroplast

counterparts, as well as relative to the mitochondrial
genomes of other organisms [1-3]. In fact, absolute rates
of sequence evolution in seed plant mitochondrial DNA

(mtDNA) are among the slowest ever estimated (Figure 1;
[4]). A series of recent studies, however, has revealed notable exceptions to this generalization [4-7]. There are
angiosperm species that not only deviate from the slow
substitution rates typical of plant mtDNA but also exhibit
some of the highest eukaryotic substitution rates ever documented (Figure 1). With such a substantial fraction of
known rate variation captured in a relatively small twig
within the tree of life, plant mitochondrial genomes represent an intriguing system for investigating the evolutionary forces that shape substitution rates [8-14].
Studies of rate accelerations in plant mitochondrial
genomes have consistently shown that these effects are
most pronounced at so-called synonymous sites, which
do not affect the corresponding amino acid sequence (e.g.
[5]). One of the pillars of the neutral theory of molecular
evolution is that the rate of neutral substitutions (i.e.
those with no fitness effect) is expected to equal the mutation rate [15]. Synonymous substitutions are not completely neutral, however. They are subject to a variety of
selection pressures including translational efficiency,

mRNA stability and the conservation of regulatory motifs
(reviewed in [16]), and direct measurements of mutation
rates can be more than an order of magnitude higher than
those estimated from synonymous substitution rates [17].
Nevertheless, synonymous sites still offer one of our best
approximations of the underlying mutation rate. Therefore, considering the absence of well-supported alternative hypotheses, the extreme synonymous substitution
rates observed in certain plant mitochondrial genomes are
most likely a result of mutational acceleration.
Silene noctiflora (Caryophyllaceae) is a recent addition to a
growing list of angiosperms exhibiting major accelerations in mitochondrial synonymous substitution rate
[4,7]. In other well-documented examples (e.g. Plantago
and Pelargonium), rate accelerations appear relatively old
(ca. 30-80 million years) having preceded the divergence
of large clades or even an entire genus [6]. In contrast, the
extreme mitochondrial substitution rates of S. noctiflora
appear unique relative to other Silene species, suggesting a
very recent acceleration. Estimates of mitochondrial substitution rate, however, are available for only a few Silene
species, representing a tiny fraction of this large and
diverse genus. The sparse sampling severely limits the
phylogenetic resolution to detect historical changes in
substitution rate.
The scarcity of mitochondrial sequence data within Silene
reflects a broader under-representation of plant mtDNA
in studies of molecular evolution. Whereas chloroplast
DNA (cpDNA) and animal mtDNA are utilized extensively in phylogenetic studies, the low baseline substitution rates and growing evidence for rate heterogeneity in
plant mtDNA often limit its utility in this context--particularly at local phylogenetic scales [18]. Understanding the
causes and consequences of mutation rate variation is a
fundamental problem in evolutionary biology [12,1921], but the lack of plant mtDNA sequence data is a hindrance to investigating this question. To characterize the
pattern of mitochondrial substitution rate variation
throughout Silene and related genera, we sequenced four
mitochondrial loci in a sample of 74 species that were
selected to capture the phylogenetic diversity of this genus
and its closest relatives (Table 1). To our knowledge, this
effort represents the most extensive species-level sampling
to date of mitochondrial sequence divergence in a plant
genus.
To compare absolute substitution rates in a gene across
lineages requires an estimate of the genealogy with dated
nodes (i.e. divergence times). In cases of extreme rate variation, generating such a tree directly from the gene in
question is problematic. With rate variation, slowly-evolving taxa can be difficult to resolve, and long branch attraction can favor incorrect topologies [22]. Even with an

accurate topology, rate variation can bias the estimate of
divergence times with molecular clock based methods.
For this reason, previous studies of substitution rate variation in plant mitochondrial genomes have constrained
their analyses based on phylogenies and divergence times
inferred from nuclear and chloroplasts sequences.
Because both mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are
predominantly maternally inherited in Silene, they are
expected to share a common genealogy [23,24] (although
breakdowns in uniparental inheritance may potentially
disrupt this relationship [25-27]). Therefore, we chose the
chloroplast gene matK to estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times. This gene has proven to be
highly informative in phylogenetic reconstruction, partly
because of its high rates of substitution [28,29]. It has also
been used in two recent analyses of divergence times
within Silene and the Caryophyllaceae [4,30].
We identified substantial rate accelerations in multiple
lineages within the Silene phylogeny as well as major rate
differences among mitochondrial genes. Here, we discuss
the complex patterns of mitochondrial rate variation in
the genus Silene and the implications they have for the
evolution of mitochondrial mutation rates and the patterns of selection on mtDNA at the sequence level.

Results
Chloroplast DNA phylogeny
Likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods were in general agreement for the matK dataset. The
70% parsimony bootstrap consensus tree (Figure 2) did
not conflict with any of the nodes from either the ML or
Bayesian analysis. The results were also generally consistent with previous cpDNA studies of the tribe Sileneae
[31,32]. The analysis recovered the two previously identified subgenera (e.g. [32])--Silene and Behenantha (Otth.)
Endl. (=subgenus Behen (Dumort.) Rohrb.)--along with

the relationships among the major clades in subgenus
Silene. There was, however, incomplete resolution in some
parts of the tree--particularly among the major lineages
within subgenus Behenantha, which appear as a large radiation. Four Silene species were not grouped with either of
the two major subgenera. As found in the analysis of other
chloroplast loci, S. sordida was placed in a clade with Lychnis [32]. Silene odontopetala was also assigned to this clade
with strong support. The relationships between subgenus
Behenantha, subgenus Silene, the Lychnis/S. odontopetala/S.
sordida clade, and a fourth lineage consisting solely of S.
cordifolia could not be confidently resolved. Finally, there
was unexpected support for a sister relationship between
S. delicatula and the rest of our Silene/Lychnis sample.
Divergence times
We used three different dating methods, which produced
roughly similar estimates of divergence times, but there
was a consistent pattern distinguishing them [see Additional files 1 and 2]. Specifically, the Langley-Fitch
method produced the youngest estimates of divergence
times within Sileneae, while a penalized likelihood
method produced the oldest. For example, the estimated
age of the root node for the entire Silene/Lychnis clade differed by 50% between the two methods (21.0 vs. 14.0
Myr). The BEAST model (Figure 2) generally produced
intermediate estimates of divergence time relative to the
other two methods. Only the BEAST values were used for
subsequent rate analyses, so the uncertainty in divergence
times should be considered when interpreting absolute
substitution rate estimates.
Mitochondrial rate variation
Branch lengths in terms of both synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous (dN) substitutions per site for each
mitochondrial gene are shown in Figure 3. All four genes
show little divergence at non-synonymous sites across the
entire tree (Table 2). In addition, they all share a pattern

Conoimorpha. Beyond those similarities, the four mito-

chondrial genes differ markedly in synonymous branch
lengths (Figure 3). Very little divergence is observed in
nad9 outside of the aforementioned six species. Synonymous divergence is similarly low throughout much of the
cox3 and atp1 trees, but there are a number of species that
exhibit substantial divergence, particularly within subgenus Silene. This group includes S. nutans which, despite
showing no sign of abnormal divergence in cox3 and nad9,
is highly divergent for atp1. Finally, synonymous divergence in atp9 is extreme and highly variable throughout
most of the genus Silene, although many of the outgroup
genera exhibit typically low levels of divergence. The total
synonymous tree length is approximately 9-fold larger for
atp9 than the slowly-evolving nad9. This gap widens to 41fold if the six taxa that have accelerated rates across all
genes are excluded from the analysis (Table 2).

stitution rates (RS) differ dramatically throughout the
tribe Sileneae (Figure 4, [see Additional files 3 and 4]). The
outgroups to Silene tend to have RS values of less than 0.5
substitutions per site per billion years (SSB), and certain
branches have an estimated RS of 0 because they lack a single synonymous substitution (Figure 4). Many lineages
within Silene have maintained these low rates. At the other
extreme, the rapidly-evolving Silene lineages have RS values that are more than two orders of magnitude greater
than the low rates of Beta vulgaris and other outgroups.
The fastest rate estimates observed in the entire dataset
were found in the atp9 tree. The internal branch subtending the minimally inclusive clade that contains S. succulenta and S. imbricata had an estimated RS value of 392
SSB. The fastest terminal branch in the atp9 tree was that
of S. schafta with a rate of 292 SSB, although it should be
noted that the error associated with atp9 rate estimates for
individual branches was generally large [see Additional
file 4]. RS and RN values were both positively correlated
across atp1, cox3 and nad9, but this correlation broke
down in comparisons with atp9 and matK (Table 3). In
addition, RS and RN values were significantly correlated
with each other within genes for atp1, cox3 and nad9 but
not for the other two loci.

matK topology at younger nodes, which are presumably
less susceptible to saturation at synonymous sites.

Evolutionary congruence between mitochondrial and
chloroplast genomes
We utilized a constrained topology derived from cpDNA
to analyze evolutionary rates in mtDNA, reflecting the
assumption that the two organelle genomes share a single
genealogy. Although the mitochondrial genes often
yielded limited phylogenetic signal because of the dual
problems of low variation and long branch attraction,
there was some evidence to support phylogenetic congruence between these genomes [see Additional file 5]. For
example, S. hookeri and S. menziesii were consistently
paired by both chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, suggesting that the allopolyploid S. hookeri inherited both of
its cytoplasmic genomes from the S. menziesii parental lineage [33]. In addition, the rapidly evolving atp9 gene produced a tree that generally agreed with the chloroplast

To date, studies of angiosperms with major increases in
plant mitochondrial substitution rates (e.g. Plantago, Pelargonium and Silene) have concluded that the observed
accelerations are largely independent of evolutionary rates
in the chloroplast or nuclear genomes (although there is
growing evidence for accelerated sequence and structural
evolution in the chloroplast genomes of species with high
mitochondrial substitution rates [34-36]). In our dataset,
we found little substitution rate variation among species
for the chloroplast matK gene and no significant correlation between mitochondrial and chloroplast rates (Table
3).

There were a large number of incongruencies between
chloroplast and mitochondrial trees, but they were generally lacking in support. Perhaps the most suspicious
example of conflict between mitochondrial and chloroplast topologies was the placement of S. samojedora, S.
seoulensis, S. zawadzkii and the major accelerated species
from subgenus Behenantha in a clade otherwise populated
by subgenus Silene in the cox3 tree [see Additional file 5].
Although this clade was supported by 74% of bootstrap
replicates, inspection of the alignments showed that the
grouping was based entirely on a single 6 bp region with
5 substitutions, raising doubts about the independence of
those characters. Overall, we found no overwhelming evidence of conflicts between mitochondrial and chloroplast
topologies, but the lack of mitochondrial divergence in
many lineages gave us little statistical power. Therefore, it
is possible that topological inaccuracies in our constraint
tree could have led to misidentification of small mitochondrial rate accelerations, but given the phylogenetic
scale of our analysis, it is unlikely that any of the major
rate changes was an artifact of topological conflicts.

Discussion
Mutation rate variation among species
Silene noctiflora has been shown to have dramatically
accelerated rates of mitochondrial evolution relative to its
congeners [4,7]. We examined the phylogenetic distribution of this rate acceleration within the tribe Sileneae and
identified six Silene species grouped into two clades that
exhibited major increases in synonymous substitution
rates across all four loci examined (Figure 3). As an illustration of the magnitude of these accelerations, we note
the average synonymous pairwise divergence between
these two closely-related clades within Silene subgenus
Behenantha exceeds the divergence typically observed
between flowering plants and liverworts--the deepest split
in the land plant phylogeny [37]. Based on the currently
available data in seed plants, the synonymous substitution rates exhibited by these rapidly-evolving lineages

(Figure 4) are exceeded only by the fastest lineages of Plantago (Figure 1) [5]. In addition, the observed rates are on
par with average estimates for mammalian mtDNA,
although they still fall well below the fastest mammalian
rates [38]. As discussed above (see Background), the
observed differences in synonymous substitution rates
most likely reflect differences in the underlying mutation
rate.
The phylogenetic data remain ambiguous with respect to
whether the two clades with rate accelerations represent
independent evolutionary events. The matK tree does not
strongly support or reject a monophyletic relationship
between S. noctiflora/S. turkestanica and section Conoimorpha (Figure 2; [see Additional files 6 and 7]). More thorough phylogenetic analyses of these taxa have recently
been conducted, utilizing both chloroplast and nuclear
loci [39]. These studies have found that, while cpDNA
sequences suggest phylogenetic independence between
the two clades, at least some nuclear loci support monophyly. Therefore it is possible but inconclusive that both
high rate clades are sister taxa that inherited an accelerated
mitochondrial substitution rate from a common ancestor.
If so, the two clades must have split shortly after that acceleration, because internal branches shared by the two lineages in the mitochondrial gene trees are quite short
relative to the divergence between the lineages [see Additional file 5]. Resolving these phylogenetic relationships
could prove difficult because previous studies have shown
that the evolutionary history of subgenus Behenantha may
be complicated by reticulation [32,40], such that relationships differ across genes and genomes
Comparisons of mitochondrial sequences from multiple
populations of S. noctiflora have revealed very low levels of
polymorphism, suggesting that the historically high
mutation rates in this lineage may have undergone a
reversion to more typical levels ([41] and unpublished
data). This conclusion was, at least partially, supported by
our phylogenetic data. The terminal branches for S. noctiflora and S. turkestanica exhibited a marked reduction in RS
values relative to the ancestral rate for that clade (Figure
4). In contrast, the patterns of divergence within section
Conoimorpha gave little indication of rate reversions.
The genus Silene is characterized by great diversity in
breeding system and life history, and there has been substantial interest in how these traits may be related to
molecular evolution in mitochondrial genomes
[14,26,41-44]. There is no clear correlation between
breeding system/life history and rate acceleration. The
species exhibiting rate acceleration across all four mitochondrial genes are all hermaphroditic/gynomonoecious
annuals with the exception of S. turkestanica, which is
perennial. However, there are at least ten additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/260

annual lineages represented in our sampling, and breeding system (hermaphroditic/gynomonoecious or gynodioecious) has yet to be determined for most species.
Mutation rate variation among genes
Substitution rates commonly differ among regions within
a genome because of variation in selection and/or mutational pressure, and a previous study had already identified substantial rate heterogeneity among Silene
mitochondrial genes [45]. Nevertheless, the differences in
synonymous substitution rates among mitochondrial
genes in the current study are surprisingly large. If the six
species that show universal acceleration across all four
mitochondrial genes are excluded, atp9 appears to be
evolving more than 40 times faster than nad9 at synonymous sites, while cox3 and atp1 fall in between these
extremes.

The extreme elevation in atp9 substitution rates calls into
question whether a biological mechanism other than an
increase in the mutation rate might be responsible. The
obvious alternatives to explain high levels of divergence
include horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from distantly
related species [46], maintenance of ancient, trans-specific
polymorphism by balancing selection [26,41,44,47], relocalization of the gene to the higher mutation rate environment of the nuclear genome [48], or relaxed selection
in a non-functional pseudogene [49].
None of these explanations, however, are fully consistent
with the data. To explain the observed levels of divergence
based on HGT without an increase in evolutionary rates
would require multiple phylogenetically distant donor
species (i.e. outside the angiosperms). Phylogenetic analysis of atp9, however, clearly places these sequences
within the Caryophyllaceae ([Additional file 5] and
unpublished data; note that this argument also applies to
the lineage-specific divergence in S. noctiflora/S. turkestanica and section Conoimorpha). Likewise, in the absence of
rate acceleration, an explanation based on balancing
selection alone would require that polymorphism be
maintained for hundreds of millions of years. Such a
model seems extremely unlikely and even still could not
explain the retention of partial phylogenetic congruence
between atp9 and matK. Of course, the fact that balancing
selection alone cannot explain the pattern of divergence
in atp9 does not rule out the possibility that balancing
selection has been acting on atp9 and other mitochondrial
genes in Silene.
It is unlikely that atp9 has been functionally transferred to
the nucleus in at least four Silene species--S. latifolia, S.
noctiflora, S. vulgaris and S. paradoxa. Whole mitochondrial genome sequences confirm that atp9 is mitochondrially encoded in both S. latifolia and S. noctiflora (Sloan et

Page 9 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:260

al., unpublished data). In addition, the gene has been
shown to be maternally inherited in S. vulgaris [26]. Comparing cDNA and genomic sequence also confirms that
atp9 contains a site that undergoes C-to-U RNA editing in
S. paradoxa--a process that is characteristic of organellar
but not nuclear genes in plants (Sloan et al., unpublished
data). Although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of nuclear transfer, these data strongly suggest that
nuclear transfer is not the driving force behind the pattern
of elevated substitution rate observed in atp9.
It is also clear that atp9 is functional based on its low ω
values and the absence of internal stop codons. Therefore,
we conclude that the most likely explanation for the high
levels of divergence is an increased mutation rate that is
specific to atp9 (or a subset of the mitochondrial genome
that includes atp9).
The molecular evolution of atp9 could be influenced by
the presence of multiple gene copies in at least some species (see Methods). The existence of multiple copies could
reflect heteroplasmy resulting from paternal leakage [25],
non-functional paralogs in the mitochondria or other
genomes [50], or the existence of multiple functional
mitochondrial copies [51]. It is conceivable that atp9 is
located in a region of active recombination within the
Silene mitochondrial genome or is experiencing frequent
retroprocessing back into the genome from mRNA. Both
of these processes may be mutagenic as well as lead to
gene duplication and, therefore, would be consistent with
our observations [6,52,53]. Alternatively, high mutations
rates in atp9 may have simply increased divergence
between heteroplasmic and/or paralogous copies, thereby
enhancing our ability to detect multiple copies of atp9
even though they exist for other genes as well. Sequencing
complete mitochondrial genomes, analyzing relative copy
number of atp9 variants, and sampling multiple individuals per species would help distinguish between these possibilities. In a sample of individuals from 40 different
populations of S. vulgaris, we found 4 individuals with
multiple atp9 copies, and certain variants were only found
in multi-copy individuals (unpublished data). This result
suggests there is polymorphism for the presence of a paralogous copy within S. vulgaris, although heteroplasmy
involving a rare haplotype is also plausible.
The acceleration in atp9 appears to be common to most of
Silene/Lychnis. In contrast, most of the other Sileneae genera exhibit more conventional substitution rates for atp9,
although their rates are still elevated on average. This pattern is consistent with an atp9-specific increase in substitution rate very early in the divergence of Silene, which
may have been magnified by further accelerations in local
areas of the genus.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/260

A previous study of mitochondrial substitution rate variation across the seed plant phylogeny identified a handful
of individual species exhibiting elevated divergence in one
gene but not others [4]. Our observations of rate variation
in atp9 within Silene indicate that such gene-specific
effects can be maintained across large clades of species
over millions of years. We also found that these effects can
occur quite locally. Most notably, S. nutans exhibited an
RS value of 80 SSB for atp1 (a rate that exceeds all other
species for that gene), but it showed no sign of acceleration in nad9 or cox3 (Figure 3). A number of other species
showed more modest rate increases in atp1 and/or cox3
without correlated accelerations in other genes. These patterns may reflect local mutational effects within the
genome. Alternatively, given the mounting evidence for
recombination in plant mtDNA [41,46,54] and the existence of rate variation both within and among species [7],
rate discrepancies between genes may be the result of
recombination between genomes with different mutational histories. Finally, the possibility of nuclear transfer
for a gene such as atp1 in S. nutans should also be considered [4].
Evolution at synonymous and non-synonymous sites
Despite the massive variation in synonymous substitution
rates among genes and species, we found that rates of
non-synonymous substitution generally remained low
(although there was a positive correlation between RN and
RS across branches: Figure 3, Table 3). Across genes, RS values vary by 9 to 41-fold (depending on whether the six
species with apparent genome-wide accelerations are
included), while RN values vary by only 2 to 3-fold (Table
2). As a result, there is an apparent negative relationship
between RS and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (ω). While RS is commonly interpreted as a
measure of the mutation rate, ω is used as an estimate of
the intensity/efficacy of purifying selection (i.e. "the selective sieve" [55]). Under these interpretations, our data
would suggest that genes experiencing high mutations
rates also face greater purifying selection. In contrast, the
opposite pattern has been observed in comparisons of
nuclear genes in mammals [56].

The relationship between RS and ω among mitochondrial
genes in Silene should be confirmed in a larger sample,
because we have examined only 4 loci in the present
study, and atp9 may generally be subject to strong purifying selection [57]. Whether RS and ω can be reliably interpreted as measures of mutation rate and purifying
selection depends on the distribution of fitness effects for
mutations at synonymous and non-synonymous sites,
which are not well understood in plant mitochondrial
genomes. These distributions will dictate how the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates scale with
the mutation rate.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:260

In a comparison of sequence divergence in 15 proteincoding mitochondrial genes between angiosperms and
the liverwort Marchantia, Laroche et al. [57] found much
greater variation among genes in dN than in dS--the opposite of what we observed. This discrepancy highlights the
importance of phylogenetic scale in these studies. Across
deep nodes in the land plant phylogeny, local differences
in gene-specific mutation rates are apparently averaged
out, and variation in the magnitude of purifying/positive
selection among genes becomes the primary determinant
of evolutionary rates. In contrast, at the local phylogenetic
scale of our study, the signature of gene-specific differences in mutation rate is apparently maintained.
Because of the high variance and abundance of 0 values
associated with short branches in our analysis, it is difficult to test for the same relationship between RS and ω
across lineages that we observed across genes. We did see,
however, that removing the rapidly evolving branches
from each tree raised the ω ratio for all four genes, suggesting that the same pattern may hold. Mower et al. [4] conducted a broad phylogenetic survey of seed plants in
which short branch lengths would be expected to be less
of a problem. Their data showed a strong negative relationship between RS and ω across lineages (see also [53]).
Therefore, it appears that major increases in mitochondrial synonymous substitution rate--either gene or taxonspecific--are accompanied by a less than proportional
increase in non-synonymous substitution rate such that
the effects of an apparent increased mutational pressure
on amino acid sequences are greatly dampened.
Uncertainty in divergence time estimates
We used molecular clock based methods to estimate
divergence times in our matK gene tree. The estimated ages
were generally older than estimates from two previous
studies [4,30]. The discrepancy between these studies is
likely attributable to two major differences. First, there is
simple difference in calibration age between our study
and the analysis of Mower et al. (2007), which utilized an
age of 38 Myr for the Beta/Silene divergence derived from
a broader molecular clock analysis of the angiosperms
[58]. This date appears to be in conflict with our fossil calibration point, as all three of our analyses estimate the age
of the Beta/Silene split to be at least 52 Myr old. This distinction, however, cannot explain the contrasting results
between our study and that of Frajman et al. [30], because
we used essentially the same calibration point. Instead, we
note that there was a significant difference in sampling
schemes between these two studies. Our focus on the
genus Silene produced a very imbalanced topology with
much denser branching in certain parts of the tree than
others. In contrast, Frajman et al. [30] utilized a much
more balanced phylogenetic sampling. Because it is easier

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/260

to detect multiple substitutions at the same site in regions
with lots of branching, there is a tendency to estimate
longer branch lengths in species-rich parts of a phylogeny
(the "node density effect" [59]). This effect may contribute to our older age estimates within the tribe Sileneae.
Because of this potential bias, the uncertainty over calibration points and the many assumptions associated with
molecular clock based dating, it is important to stress that
the divergence times used in this analysis should be considered only as approximations.
Divergence time estimates are necessary to calculate absolute substitution rates, so dating uncertainty should be
considered in comparing absolute rates across studies. For
example, re-calibrating node ages within Silene to correspond with the 12 Myr divergence time for the genus estimated by Frajman et al. [30] would increase our
substitution rate estimates by approximately 50%. In relative terms, however, our three dating analyses were quite
consistent within Sileneae. Therefore, our estimates of proportional variation in substitution rate across species and
genes are less sensitive to dating method.

Conclusion
Based on our analysis of mitochondrial divergence within
the tribe Sileneae, we conclude that mutational acceleration is not restricted to a single species nor is it completely
confined to a small number of high rate lineages. The patterns of divergence in atp9 illustrated that elevated rates
have been maintained throughout much of the genus
Silene for at least one mitochondrial gene, highlighting a
complex gene × species interaction in the distribution of
rate variation. The diversity in phylogenetic and genomics
scale suggests that there is no simple rule or single mechanism underlying mutation rate variation in plant mitochondrial genomes. Elucidating the mechanistic forces
that shape mutation rate variation should represent a high
priority in the field of plant mitochondrial genomics.
Silene was targeted for this in-depth sampling of specieslevel mitochondrial divergence because of a priori knowledge of the rate acceleration in S. noctiflora. Determining
whether the patterns of rate variation among species and
among genes in Silene are broadly representative of
angiosperm genera or represent something unique about
the molecular evolution of Silene will require similar levels of sampling in taxa that currently show no evidence of
rate increase.

Methods
Study species
Silene (Caryophyllaceae) comprises approximately 700
predominantly herbaceous species that vary substantially
in life history and breeding system [60]. The genus has
become a model system for diverse areas of research with

Page 11 of 16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/260

a particular focus on the molecular evolution of organelle
genomes, including studies of population genetics
[61,62], organelle transmission [25,27], evolutionary
rates [4,7,35,45], and cytoplasmic male sterility [26,44].
Silene belongs to the tribe Sileneae, which has been the
subject of extensive and ongoing phylogenetic analysis
[30-32,63-65]. Taxa were selected so as to represent major
groups that will appear in a forthcoming revised taxonomy of the genus (Oxelman et al. in prep). For this study,
we used a combination of field collected samples and preserved herbarium specimens along with previously published sequence data. Sample collection and voucher
information are summarized in Table 1.

Illecebrum verticillatum (Caryophyllaceae) and Scleranthus
perennis (Caryophyllaceae). Our ML search employed a
GTR+Γ substitution model with fixed parameter values
identified based on an analysis of our full matK dataset
(including outgroups) using the AIC method in ModelTest v3.7 [68]. The ML topology was identified with a heuristic search using the TBR branch swapping algorithm,
the MULTREES option in effect, and random addition of
sequences with 10 replicates. A MP bootstrap analysis
based on 1000 replicate datasets was performed using the
same heuristic search settings except with MULTREES off.
We performed ML and MP analyses in the same fashion
for each mitochondrial gene.

DNA extraction, PCR and Sequencing
We extracted total genomic DNA from each sample. For
silica-dried samples and herbarium specimens, we followed the protocol described by Oxelman et al. [31] and
performed subsequent purification using the Qiagen
QIAquick Purification Kit protocol, Ultra Silica Bead kit
(ABgene), or GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit
(Amersham Biosciences). For fresh tissue samples, extractions were performed using the Qiagen Plant DNeasy Kit.

We used three different techniques to estimate divergence
times from our matK gene tree: (1) a Bayesian relaxed
clock model implemented in BEAST v1.4.8 [69], (2) a
penalized likelihood (PL) method, and (3) the LangleyFitch (LF) method. The latter two methods were both performed in r8s v1.71 [70]. The LF model is a maximum
likelihood strict molecular clock method that enforces a
constant substitution rate over the entire tree. The other
two methods allow for rate variation among branches.
The PL approach assumes that rates are correlated across
adjacent branches and penalizes models that require rapid
rate changes within the tree. In contrast, the BEAST analysis constrained the rate variation among branches to a lognormal distribution but placed no restriction on
correlations between adjacent branches. All dating analyses incorporated an extra outgroup, Nepenthes glabrata
(Nepenthaceae), which was added solely to determine the
position of the root along the Beta vulgaris branch. It was
pruned from the resulting trees and discarded from all
subsequent analyses. We used a calibration time of 34
million years (Myr) for the split between Scleranthus and
Sileneae, which corresponds to the recent analysis of Frajman et al. [30] and the fossil evidence described therein.

We PCR amplified the full-length coding sequence of the
chloroplast gene maturase K (matK) and portions of four
mitochondrial protein coding genes: ATP synthase subunit
1 (atp1), ATP synthase subunit 9 (atp9), cytochrome c oxidase
subunit 3 (cox3) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 9 (nad9).
[See Additional file 8 for PCR primer sequences.]
PCR products were cleaned with Exonuclease I and
shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corporation), cycle
sequenced with BigDye v3.1 (Applied Biosystems), and
analyzed on an ABI 3130 × l capillary sequencer. Automated basecalls were edited manually using published
Beta vulgaris sequences as a reference for reading frame,
and sequences were assembled into contigs using
Sequencher v4.5 (Gene Codes). All sequences obtained
for S. sorensenis were identical to those from S. involucrata,
so S. sorensenis was excluded to simplify subsequent analysis. DNA sequences have been submitted to GenBank
[see Additional file 9 for accession numbers]. Sequence
alignments were generated using the Clustal function
imbedded in MEGA v4.0 [66] and edited manually [see
Additional file 10].
matK phylogenetic analysis and dating
We estimated the phylogeny of our sample based on the
matK dataset, using both maximum likelihood (ML) and
maximum parsimony (MP) criteria in PAUP* v4.0b10
[67]. In addition to the species listed in Table 1, our analysis also included matK sequences from GenBank for the
following outgroups: Beta vulgaris (Amaranthaceae),

The BEAST analysis was conducted with a GTR+Γ model
of substitution with 4 rate categories, empirical base frequencies and a birth-death process tree prior. We defined
a monophyletic ingroup to include all species except
Nepenthes, Beta and Illecebrum. The calibration date was
effectively fixed by specifying a normal distribution with
mean of 34 and standard deviation of 0.00001 as the prior
for the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of
the pre-defined ingroup. We ran 3 MCMC chains of length
50 million each with trees saved every 25,000 iterations.
The first 1000 trees (50%) from each chain were discarded
as burn in, and chains were combined after verifying convergence among runs. We generated a maximum credibility tree with mean node heights as well as a tree that was
constrained to the 70% bootstrap consensus topology
from our parsimony analysis. BEAST reported the esti-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:260

mated node ages along with the associated 95% high
probability densities (HPDs), as well as the posterior
probability for each node.
For the PL and LF analyses in r8s, we used the 70% parsimony bootstrap consensus topology with branch lengths
optimized under ML in PAUP*. We fixed the root age of
the tree to an arbitrary value of 1 and calibrated the resulting output tree with the 34 Myr fossil age for the Scleranthus/Sileneae split. Both analyses utilized the TN search
algorithm with 10 restarts, 10 time guesses, and the checkgradient option on. The cross-validation procedure was
used to determine an optimal smoothing parameter of
0.0022 for the PL analysis. Error in divergence times for
both methods was estimated based on the distribution of
100 bootstrap replicate datasets, following the recommendations in the r8s documentation.
Estimating dN and dS
We estimated the branch lengths of matK and all 4 mitochondrial genes individually in terms of synonymous (dS)
and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions per site, using a
codon-based model of substitution within the codeml
application in PAML v4.0 [71]. We also analyzed a concatenation of all 4 mitochondrial genes and a concatenation of atp1, cox3 and nad9 only. Tree topologies were
constrained based on the matK 70% parsimony bootstrap
consensus. Codon frequencies were determined by an
F1x4 model. The parameters values for ω and transition/
transversion ratio were estimated from the data with initial values of 0.4 and 2 respectively. Separate ω values
were estimated for each branch. As in the dating analysis,
Nepenthes glabrata was used as an outgroup in the matK
dataset to identify the position of the root along the Beta
vulgaris branch. Arabidopsis thaliana served a similar purpose for the mitochondrial genes. These outgroups were
pruned from the resulting trees and not considered further. Because the process of C-to-U RNA editing can bias
the estimation of dN and dS values in plant mitochondrial
genomes [72], we excluded all codons known to undergo
RNA editing in Beta vulgaris [73].

In the matK dataset, 6 species (Heliosperma pusillum, S.
conica, S. paradoxa, S. samojedora, S. seoulensis and S. conoidea) produced sequences with an apparent frameshift
indel in one of two homopolymer regions, raising the
possibility that we sequenced pseudogenes in these species. In addition, S. otites did not have a start codon at the
conserved position in the matK alignment. These
sequences showed little indication of elevated rates or
other abnormal substitution patterns, and their phylogenetic placement was consistent with a priori information.
Therefore, they were retained in the dataset, and codons
that contained frameshift indels were removed to keep all
sequences in frame.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/260

For the mitochondrial dataset, we obtained sequences for
atp1, cox3, and nad9 from all sampled species, but only a
subset of atp9 sequences were successfully generated. For
5 of the 74 species in our sample, we failed to successfully
amplify and sequence atp9, and an additional 9 species
appeared to have multiple atp9 copies. In the latter group,
sequencing electropherograms indicated the presence of
two different nucleotides in between 1.2 and 19.5% of
sites. These samples were excluded from the analysis.
Estimates of absolute substitution rates (RN and RS)
Following the basic methodology described by Cho et al.
[5], absolute substitution rates (substitutions per site per
year) can be obtained by dividing branch lengths (defined
in terms of substitution per site) by the age of the branch.
We calculated branch ages using the divergence times estimated by BEAST. We divided the dN and dS values reported
by PAML for each branch by the respective branch age to
obtain absolute substitution rates in terms of non-synonymous and synonymous sites (RN and RS, respectively).
Standard errors for RN and RS were calculated as described
by Parkinson et al. [6] where the standard errors for node
ages were approximated as one quarter of the 95% HPD.
Pearson correlations coefficient for RN and RS values
across and within genes were calculated with PROC CORR
in SAS Software v9.1.

values are in terms of SSB. Approximated standard errors (SEs) are provided for RN and RS. Note that SE approximations are undefined and
reported as 0 for any absolute rate estimate of 0. This table does not
include atp9 because it was not sequenced in all species. [See Additional
