<p>Analysis of intron gain and loss
Intron evolution in fungal genomes in fungal genomes provides support for an intron-rich fungus-animal ancestor.</p>

Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic protein-coding genes are interrupted by spliceosomal introns, which are
removed from transcripts before protein translation. Many facets of spliceosomal intron evolution,
including age, mechanisms of origins, the role of natural selection, and the causes of the vast
differences in intron number between eukaryotic species, remain debated. Genome sequencing and
comparative analysis has made possible whole genome analysis of intron evolution to address these
questions.
Results: We analyzed intron positions in 1,161 sets of orthologous genes across 25 eukaryotic
species. We find strong support for an intron-rich fungus-animal ancestor, with more than four
introns per kilobase, comparable to the highest known modern intron densities. Indeed, the fungusanimal ancestor is estimated to have had more introns than any of the extant fungi in this study.
Thus, subsequent fungal evolution has been characterized by widespread and recurrent intron loss
occurring in all fungal clades. These results reconcile three previously proposed methods for
estimation of ancestral intron number, which previously gave very different estimates of ancestral
intron number for eight eukaryotic species, as well as a fourth more recent method. We do not
find a clear inverse correspondence between rates of intron loss and gain, contrary to the
predictions of selection-based proposals for interspecific differences in intron number.
Conclusion: Our results underscore the high intron density of eukaryotic ancestors and the
widespread importance of intron loss through eukaryotic evolution.

Background

Unlike bacteria, the protein-coding genes of eukaryotes are
typically interrupted by spliceosomal introns, which are
removed from gene transcripts before translation into proteins. Eukaryotic species vary dramatically in their number of
introns, ranging from a few introns per genome to several

introns per gene. The reasons for these vast differences, as
well as the explanation for the particular pattern of intron
number across species, remain obscure. The first genomes
with characterized intron densities suggested the possibility
of a close association between intron number and organismal
complexity. The initial animal and land plant species studied

had high intron densities, for instance, Homo sapiens with
8.1 introns per gene [1], Caenorhabditis elegans with 4.7 [2],
Drosophila melanogaster with 3.4 [3], and Arabidopsis thaliana with 4.4 [4]. By contrast, many unicellular species were
found to have few [5]. However, further studies have shown
high intron densities in a variety of single-celled species [6,7],
with great variation in intron density within eukaryotic
kingdoms.
The case of fungi is particularly striking. The first fungal
genomes characterized, the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces
pombe (0.9 per gene) [8] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(0.05 per gene) [9], have low intron densities. However, the
euascomycete fungi Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans have much higher intron densities (2-3 per gene)
[10,11], and intron densities in basidiomycete and zygomycete fungi are among the highest known among eukaryotes (46 per gene) [12,13]. Gene structures among fungal species are
known to differ between closely related Cryptococcus species
[14] or more distantly related euascomycete species [15]. Conservation of intron positions between deeply diverged fungal
groups has not been systematically evaluated, and it is not
known whether the large numbers of introns among these
major fungal lineages are due primarily to retention of
introns present in fungal ancestors or to intron gain into
ancestrally intron-poor genes.
Many intron positions are shared between eukaryotic kingdoms. In particular, many intron positions are shared
between plants and animals but not the intron-sparse fungi S.
pombe and S. cerevisiae, a pattern that is due to some combination of loss in fungi [16-19], and homoplastic insertion in
plants and animals [16,17]. Separate analyses have supported
different pictures, either of moderate ancestral intron densities followed by a tripling of intron number in vertebrates and
plants [16,17,19], or of high ancestral intron density and massive intron loss in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and a variety of
other species [18,20]. This study represents the first multikingdom comparative analysis to include multiple diverse
and intron rich fungi, permitting a more accurate reconstruction of intron evolution through fungal history.
We used comparative genomic analysis of the gene structures
of 1,161 sets of orthologs among 21 fungal species and four
outgroups. We found that studied fungal species share many
intron positions with distantly related species; both the fungal ancestor and fungus-animal ancestor (Opisthokont) were
very intron rich, with intron densities matching or exceeding
the highest known average densities in modern species of
fungi and approaching the highest known across eukaryotes.
Fungal evolution has been dominated by intron loss and we
identify independent nearly complete intron loss along three
distinct fungal lineages in addition to overall patterns of
intron loss.

Results and discussion
Intron position data set
To study fungal intron evolution, we identified 1,161 orthologs
among 21 fungal species and 4 outgroups (Figure 1; see Materials and methods). We aligned the amino acid sequences and
mapped the corresponding intron positions onto the alignments. There were a total of 7,535 intron positions in 4.15
Megabases of conserved regions of alignment (hereafter 'conserved orthologous regions' (CORs)). Species' intron counts
ranged from 0.001 introns per kilobase (kb) in CORs (in S.
cerevisiae with 7 total introns) to 6.7 introns per kb (2,737
introns in humans; Figure 1). Figure 2 summarizes the average number of introns per kb of coding sequence versus
median intron length. In general, major lineages are clearly
separated by intron density. One exception is Ustilago maydis, a basidiomycete fungus that has many fewer introns than
other members of its clade. Median intron length is inversely
and significantly correlated with the average number of
introns per kb (R2 = 0.23, P = 1e-4; Spearman correlation coefficient), although the trend is not significant when the hemiascomycete fungi are excluded (R2 = 0.18, P = 0.06). This
finding of much longer introns in the very intron-poor hemiascomycetes is intriguing, particularly in light of other peculiarities of evolution in very intron poor lineages [21]. In
particular, very intron-poor lineages, including hemiascomycetes (see below), have more regular 5' intronic sequences
(that is, a stronger consensus sequence at the beginning of
introns). Presumably, this conservation of 5' boundaries facilitates intron splicing, in which case increased intron length
might be better accommodated. Comparison between other
very intron-poor species and more intron-rich relatives
should yield insight into the peculiarities of evolution of very
intron-poor lineages. Additional data file 4 provides the summary statistics of coding sequence, intron length, and density
for the sampled fungal genomes.

Patterns of intron sharing
Patterns of intron position sharing vary across fungal species.
Excluding the extremely intron-poor Hemiascomycota clade,
species show between 3.7% and 38.7% species-specific intron
positions, while between 32.0% and 76.5% of introns are
shared with a species outside of the clade (different colors in
Figure 1), and between 20.5% and 60.1% are shared with a
non-fungal species. Figure 3 summarizes the pattern of species-specific and shared intron positions across the CORs.
Out of 7,535 intron positions, 3,307 are species-specific positions, 1,602 of which are specific to A. thaliana. Of the 501
intron positions shared between plants and animals, from
2.76% in U. maydis to 43.2% in Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Figure 4) are shared with the various fungal species. In
all, 60.7% of shared plant-animal positions are also represented in at least one fungal species.
Species within a clade share more intron positions than
between clades. Another way to visualize this is using a phylogenetic tree derived from a parsimony analysis where each

We constructed a phylogenetic tree using Dollo parsimony
[22,23] from the intron presence absence matrix for the
CORs. Dollo parsimony assumes that 0 to 1 transitions
(intron gain) can occur only once across the tree for each site,

and then infers a minimum number of 1 to 0 transitions
(intron loss) to explain each phylogenetic pattern. Surprisingly, our species tree and parsimony tree from the intron
position matrix provide nearly the same result, with two
exceptions: the unresolved hemiascomycetes, which have few

intron presence characters; and the position of U. maydis and
S. pombe, presumably due to a high degree of intron loss in
those lineages. Previous failed attempts to reconstruct phylogeny by applying parsimony analysis to intron positions
experienced a similar phenomenon, with intron poor taxa
artificially grouping together [19]. As such, it seems possible
that intron positions could be good phylogenetic characters in
slowly evolving taxa, but will likely encounter problems in
cases of widespread intron loss.

High ancestral intron number and ongoing loss and
gain
We next studied intron loss and gain in fungi in CORs of 1,161
genes. Four previously proposed methods showed very similar pictures, with large numbers of introns present in ancestral genomes and widespread subsequent intron number
reduction along various fungal lineages (Figure 5, and tables

in additional files 4 and 5). We find that the fungal ancestor
was at least as intron rich as any modern fungal species and
that the fungus-animal ancestor was 25% more intron-rich
than any modern fungus, with at least three-quarters as many
introns as modern vertebrates.
Intron number reduction has been a general feature of fungal
evolution (Figure 5). We estimate that at least half of the studied fungal lineages (excluding hemiascomycetes) experienced
at least 50% more losses than gains, while only between three
and six experienced 50% more gains than losses (Figure 5;
depending on method used, see Additional file 5). Dramatic
intron reduction has occurred within each fungal clade. U.
maydis' 0.21 introns per kb represent a 94% reduction in
intron number relative to the basidiomycete ancestor; since
the ascomycete ancestor (with at least 2.77 introns per kb),
hemiascomycetes (0.01-0.07 introns per kb) species have

reduced their intron number by at least 94%, S. pombe has
reduced its intron number by 81% (0.52 introns per kb), and
even relatively intron-rich euascomycete species (0.81-1.16
introns per kb) have undergone a 60% reduction in intron
number. Interestingly, following dramatic intron number
reduction in the euascomycete ancestor, intron number has
remained relatively unchanged within the clade (Figure 5b),
consistent with previous results [15,24].

On the other hand, our results also attest to ongoing intron
gain. Most species have experienced hundreds of intron gains
in CORs (although many have subsequently been lost) since
the fungal ancestor, and nearly every studied species is estimated to have gained more than one intron per kb since the
intron ancestor. Differences in intron gain are sometimes the
central determinant of modern differences in intron number.
For instance, S. pombe shares as many of the 507 intron

fewer shared plant-animal introns than does Rhizopus

intron gain.

Intron evolution in hemiascomycetes
Intron evolution within hemiascomycetes provides insights
into the evolution of nearly intronless lineages. The extensive
loss of introns in hemiascomycetes corresponds to the position in the fungal phylogeny with a significant shift in intron
structure. Intron structure in hemiascomycetes requires a six
base sequence at the 5' splice site and a seven base pair site at
the branching point [25]. The other sampled fungi require
only a limited intron splice consensus at the 5' splice site and
branching point. Previous results have shown that this correspondence between greatly reduced intron number and
stronger conservation of intron boundaries across eukaryotes
is a general trend [21]. Two explanations have been proposed.
Irimia et al. [21] suggested that mutations that led to stricter
sequence requirements by the spliceosome might be favored
in intron-poor but not intron-rich species, in which case
widespread intron loss would lead to increased strictness of
splicing requirements (and thus intron boundaries). Another
possibility [26] is that a shift in splicing mechanism,
requiring more extensive conserved sequences at the branch
point and 5' splice junction, would create a condition where
introns would be more deleterious due to the additional
sequence constraint necessary for splicing. In this case,
increased strictness of splicing requirements (and thus intron
boundaries) would drive intron loss.
Why have all of the introns then not been lost in hemiascomycete species? Some of the S. cerevisiae introns encode
functional elements such as small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs)
[27] or promoter elements [28]. snRNAs located in the
introns of ribosomal proteins are found in orthologous loci of
basidiomycetes and ascomycetes (for example, snR39 in
RPL7A of S. cerevisiae), indicating their conservation since
divergence from the fungal ancestor. However, only 8 of 76
snRNAs are found in the 275 nuclear introns in S. cerevisiae
[9]. Introns also play a role in regulation of RNA and proteins
[29], perhaps through a role in recruiting factors that mediate
splicing-dependent export [30]. Some of the remaining
introns in hemiascomycetes may also provide a necessary role
as cis-regulatory containing elements or encoding factors
necessary for post-transcriptional regulation, but they may
also persist by chance due to low rates of loss.
On the other hand, our results show that hemiascomycete
intron positions are not in general widely shared. Only one of
the seven intron positions in non-Yarrowia lipolytica hemiascomycete species examined is shared with any species more
distant than euascomycetes. However, six of the seven are
broadly shared within the hemiascomycete lineage,
suggesting either that the remaining introns are very hard to
lose or that loss rates have greatly diminished within the lineage. By contrast, 14 of 23 introns present in Y. lipolytica but
no other hemiascomycete are shared with a non-euascomycete, and 10 are shared with plants and/or animals; thus,
widely shared introns have been preferentially lost among

Stajich et al. R223.8

hemiascomycetes after the divergence with the Y. lipolytica
ancestor.

Selection and intron evolution
Eukaryotic species vary in their numbers of introns by orders
of magnitude. These differences have traditionally been
attributed to alleged differences in the intensity of selection
against introns across eukaryotes [31,32]. Additionally, it has
been proposed that selection against introns could be similar,
with differences in population size determining intron
number [33,34]. Under these models, lineages with strong
selection against introns (or large population size) should
experience low rates of intron gain and high rates of intron
loss. Lineages with weaker selection (or smaller population
size) should experience more intron gain and less intron loss.
Both models thus predict a strong inverse correlation
between intron gain and loss rates. However, the data presented here show no clear pattern of inverse correlation (Figure 5).

On the reconstruction of intron evolution
These results provide an excellent opportunity to compare
different previously proposed methods for reconstruction of
intron evolution. There are five previously proposed methods. Dollo parsimony assumes a minimal number of changes
but that once an intron is lost at a position, it is never regained
[22]. Roy and Gilbert's method ('RG') [18,20] assumes that all
intron positions shared between species are representative of
retained ancestral introns, while the methods of Csűrös [16]
and of Nguyen and coauthors ('NYK') [17] allow multiple
intron insertions into the same site, so-called 'parallel insertion'. Carmel and coauthors' [35] method additionally allows
for the possibility of heterogeneity of rates of both intron loss
and gain across sites.
Previously, application of four methods (Dollo, RG, Csűrös,
and NYK) to intron positions in conserved regions of 684 sets
of orthologs showed very different pictures of early eukaryotic
evolution. Roy and Gilbert estimated the animal-fungus and
plant-animal ancestors had some three-fifths as many introns
as vertebrates (among the most intron-dense known modern
species) [18], while Rogozin and collaborators [19], Csűrös
[16], and Nguyen and collaborators [17] all concluded that
these ancestors had only half that many introns, and that
higher intron densities in plants and vertebrates were due to
dramatic increases in intron number. This difference has
repeatedly been attributed to overestimation by the RG
method [16,17,36,37], and the RG estimates have been called
'drastic' and 'generous' [27,28]. The rationale for this conclusion has been that if a significant number of matching intron
positions represent parallel insertion, the RG method will
clearly overestimate ancestral intron number.
We used all five methods to reconstruct intron evolution for
the current data set. In contrast to the previous discordance,
all methods now provide similar estimates for the numbers of

introns in the animal-fungus ancestor. Dollo parsimony
tended to be very different from the rest of the estimates for
deep nodes in the tree. The Carmel and NYK methods show
the most striking agreement, with less than 2% difference
across all nodes except for the Opisthokont ancestor (3.3%
difference). The NYK and Csűrös methods also show striking
agreement, giving estimates within 2% of each other for 13
out of 18 (non-hemiascomycetes) nodes, and to within 10%
for 17 out of 18. The RG method agreed with the other three
methods to within 15% for all nodes except six and was not
more than 30% higher than either of the other methods for
any node other than the Ascomycete node. Notably, the three
nodes on which RG was comparatively highest for the current
data set are deep nodes near very long branches in this tree.
Thus, further taxonomic sampling would likely bring even
these nodes into better agreement (see below). Numbers of
intron losses and gains in CORs along each branch were also
estimated using all four methods. Though absolute numbers
of estimated intron losses and gains along each branch varied
more considerably between methods, there was a striking
agreement in the relative incidence of intron loss and gain,
with Csűrös (2.03 losses per gain), evolutionary reconstruction by expectation-maximization (EREM; 2.14) and NYK
(2.12) nearly identical and RG only 21% higher (2.66). Notably, overall estimated numbers of gains were very similar,
with only 19 more gains by RG than NYK. Results for all methods are given in Additional data files 4 and 5.
Strikingly, all four methods now estimate that the fungus-animal ancestor had at least 70% as many introns as vertebrates,
15% more than estimated by Roy and Gilbert and more than
twice that previously estimated by Csűrös and NYK. Thus, it
appears that the previous difference in estimated intron density in the animal-fungal ancestor was not due to overestimation by the RG method, but to a 2.5-fold underestimation by
the other methods. Indeed, even the estimates of Roy and Gilbert appear to have been conservative [20].
Why should this be? Following the original authors [20], we
suggest that this pattern may be due to unrecognized differences in rates of intron loss across sites. Clear differences in
rates of intron loss across sites (that is, different rates of loss
for introns at different positions along the same lineage) have
been observed over both short [38,39] and long [40,41] evolutionary timescales; however, three out of four methods fail
to take into account such differences in loss rate. Given the
recurrent finding of differences in intron loss rates in a variety
of studies, it is interesting that Carmel and coauthors' recent
work did not find significant differences in rates, and that
their method so closely cleaves to the findings of the other
methods described here. Clearly, more study into possible differences in rates of evolution across sites, and their effects on
current methods, is necessary.
We performed simulations of intron evolution that included
variations in intron loss rate across sites, and reconstructed

intron loss/gain evolution on each set using four of the five
methods (Dollo, RG, Csűrös, EREM). We considered a fourtaxa case in which taxa A and B are sisters, and taxa C and D
are sisters (Additional data file 2), and in which there were
1,000 introns in CORs in the common ancestor and allowed
loss rates to vary between intron positions (Figure 6). In these
simulated data sets no parallel gain was allowed to occur.
There are four clear observations, each of which held over all
sets of parameters. First, all methods underestimated ancestral intron density. Second, for each data set RG was closest to
the real value, followed by EREM, then by Csűrös, then by
Dollo parsimony. Third, the Csűrös and EREM methods consistently estimated significant numbers of parallel insertions
even though none were included in the simulations - that is,
both methods overestimated parallel insertions. Fourth,
these trends typically increased with overall branch length.
An exception to this was the lack of clear dependency of
EREM on branch length.
Together, these observations suggest the following explanation for the discrepancy between previous and current estimates. In the previous data sets [19], the fungi were
represented by only S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, both of which
have lost the vast majority of their ancestral introns (that is,
the fungal branch was very long). Under such long branch
conditions, the RG method somewhat underestimated ancestral intron density, while the other methods considerably
underestimated intron density and overestimated parallel
insertion. In the new data set, the inclusion of fungal species
that retain many more of their ancestral introns shortened
the fungal branch, leading to a convergence of the four methods on better estimates (and less or no overestimation of parallel gain by NYK and Csűrös).
Indeed, the difference between NYK's estimation of the incidence of parallel gain between the present and previous data
sets is striking. According to the NYK method of calculating
parallel intron insertions, our data set showed very little evidence for parallel intron gain. Their method estimated 93.08
total parallel gains; thus, only 2.2 % of 4,228 shared introns
were due to parallel gain. This is much less than the previous
estimate that 18.5% of shared positions in the Rogozin data
set were due to parallel gains. This is despite the fact that the
overall number of estimated intron gains, as well as the overall number of estimated gains per kb, was higher in our data
set than in the Rogozin data set. Thus, it seems that parallel
gains were previously overestimated, and given the near
identity of results from Csűrös method to NYK's, the same is
very likely true of Csűrös' method.
This decrease in the estimated incidence of parallel gain is all
the more striking given the increased number of taxa across
data sets, which presumably brings with it an increased
number of real gains and real parallel gains, although the
implications are not entirely clear given that the species

present in the current data set are not a superset of the species
in the previous set. Our simulations suggest here that there
will be countervailing effects of greater taxonomic sampling,
with a decrease in the overestimation of parallel gains due to
long-branch effects coinciding with an increase in the overall
number of true parallel gains. The decrease in estimated incidence of parallel gain seen here implies that currently the
former effect dominates; however, with better and better
sampling the latter effect may come to dominate in future
data sets. More thorough simulation studies will be necessary
to more completely understand this issue.
What of other ancestral nodes of key biological interest for
which the different methods gave very different estimates?
The three methods' previous estimates based on the Rogozin
data set also differed significantly for the fungi-animal-plant
ancestor and the bilateran ancestor. In the previous data set,

both ancestors were flanked by at least one very long branch,
suggesting that all methods might have underestimated
intron densities. The finding of intron-rich protostomes and
apicomplexans would make resolution of this issue possible
in the near future. This argument suggests that intron density
was very high even in very early eukaryote ancestors.

Conclusion

These results resolve a debate over the intron density of the
fungal-animal ancestor. All proposed methodologies now
agree that this ancestor was very intron rich, and that all modern fungi have experienced more intron loss than gain since
divergence. These results underscore that intron evolution in
eukaryotic evolution often defies common assumptions of
organismal and gene structure complexity and requires new
models of intron loss and gain evolution.

orthologs are provided as Additional data file 8.

Materials and methods
Genome data and annotation
Annotated genomes of many of the fungi analyzed were
obtained from GenBank or directly from sequencing centers
and are listed in Additional data file 3. For unannotated
genomes, gene predictions were generated using a combination of ab initio and evidence based gene predictions and
combined into a single composite gene call with the tool
GLEAN [42]. The ab initio gene prediction programs SNAP
[43], AUGUSTUS [44], and Genezilla [45] were first trained
on a set of genes for each genome based on alignments of conserved fungal proteins to the genome using Genewise [46]
and Exonerate [47]. At the start of this study, high quality
annotations of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus,
Coprinus cinereus, Podospora anserina and Rhizopus
oryzae were not available so automated annotations were
generated so that these species could be included. We generated a new annotation of the v1 P. chrysosporium genome
[13] as we found the previously published gene structures
were not of sufficient quality based on multiple sequence
alignments of the proteins with other fungal proteins. Prediction parameters derived from the closest annotated species
were used with at least one round of retraining as previously
described [43]. Frozen versions of genome sequences,
annotations in GFF format, Genome Browser [48] and Web
BLAST [49] interface to the genomes, predicted coding
sequences and proteins are available for download from the
authors' site [50].

Ortholog processing and intron to alignment mapping
The predicted proteins from the 21 fungal genome annotations (Additional data file 3), were combined with the A. thaliana annotations (Feb 2005) [4] available from GenBank and
the Fugu rubripes (Ensembl 30.2e, assembly 2) [51], Mus
musculus (Ensembl 30.33f) [52], and H. sapiens annotations
(Ensembl 30.35c) [1]. The longest transcript was used for
genes with multiple isoforms. The protein set was masked for
low complexity sequences with pseg [53] searched in an allagainst-all fashion using FASTP [54] with an expectation
value cutoff of 1 × 10-5. The output was processed with a custom Perl script to generate, for each pair of species, pairwise
orthologs via best-mutual-FASTP hits. The pairwise
orthologs were combined via single-linkage clustering for all
sets of species into multi-way orthologs only if they formed
clusters that contained exactly one protein member from each
species.
The protein sequences for these orthologs were then aligned
using the multiple sequence alignment program MUSCLE
[55]. The protein alignments were used as a guide to align the
genes' coding sequences and intron positions were mapped
into both the protein and coding sequence alignments using
Perl language modules from BioPerl [56]. The 5' and 3' ends
of most genes were not alignable and many introns that
occurred in these regions, in particular most of the hemiascomycete introns that tend to be within the first few codons of a

The alignments were evaluated for these intron positions in
order to build a matrix of all intron positions. Similar to
methodology in previous work [18], each observed intron column in the alignment was classified as to which species
shared that intron position. Additionally, an intron position
was classified as 'gapped' and removed from the final data
matrix if it was within six nucleotides of a column with gaps
following methodology from previous studies [19]. The
aligned data with intron positions inserted are available in
Additional data file 7.

Phylogenetic analyses
A random sampling of 30 of the protein alignments were used
to generate a species tree by concatenating the aligned
sequences and removing all gap columns from the alignment.
The tree was computed and bootstrapped with MrBayes [57].
The fungal species tree topology was constrained so that
Stagonospora nodorum is basal to the euascomycetes for
consistency with more exhaustive phylogenetic methods
using larger sampling of taxa [58]. Other than this constraint,
the phylogenetic reconstruction was consistent with other
studies that used a larger sampling of orthologous gene
sequences [59].
Dollo parsimony was computed with dollop from the PHYLIP
package [60] using default parameters. We generated 1,000
bootstrap replicates with seqboot and Dollo parsimony was
recomputed on the replicates. The strict consensus tree was
computed from these trees with consense in PHYLIP.

Ancestral intron density reconstruction
The resulting matrix of classified intron positions was evaluated using the RG method computed along the species tree to
compute intron densities, numbers of intron gains and losses,
and the fraction of introns present at different internal nodes
in the tree. The NYK method was also used to construct intron
loss and gain rates and densities in ancestral nodes after modification of the authors' C code. The modified RG Perl code
and the NYK C code is available in Additional data file 6. The
Csűrös method, implemented in intronRates.jar program
[16,61], was applied to the data set and allowed to find the
optimal number of all-zero unobserved sites. EREM and
Dollo parsimony values were computed with the EREM program [35,62]. The EREM values were computed under a
homogenous model. The values reported in Figure 5 represent the maximum likelihood estimate from the EREM program of the numbers of predicted introns and gains and
losses. Reconstructed values from all five methods are
reported in the tables found in Additional data files 4 and 5.
No overall comparisons between methods was made for the
'Crown' node or branches leading from this node as not all
methods estimate ancestral density or rates without an
outgroup.

Simulations
We simulated a four-taxa case in which taxa A and B are sisters, and taxa C and D are sisters, and in which there were
1,000 introns in CORs in the common ancestor (Additional
data file 2). Different introns were assigned different loss
rates as given by a standard gamma distribution, with varying
gamma-values. The internal branch was set to length zero
(neither intron loss nor gain along the internal branch).
External branch lengths were set to be of equal length, with a
length chosen for each gamma value such that, on average, a
given fraction (70% or 30%) of all introns present at the
ancestral node were retained in each descendent taxon. We
generated data sets for gamma values from 2.0 (most variation in intron loss rate) to 10.0 (least) in increments of 0.5. No
insertion, parallel or otherwise, was assumed. For each set of
parameters we generated expected numbers of introns with
each phylogenetic distribution, and used these values,
rounded to the nearest integer, as inputs for all three
methods.
