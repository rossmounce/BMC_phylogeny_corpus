Abstract
Background: Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) constitute approximately 8% of the
human genome and have long been considered "junk". The sheer number and repetitive nature of
these elements make studies of their expression methodologically challenging. Hence, little is
known of transcription of genomic regions harboring such elements.
Results: Applying a recently developed technique for obtaining high resolution melting
temperature data, we examined the frequency distributions of HERV-W gag element into 13 Tm
categories in human tissues. Transcripts containing HERV-W gag sequences were expressed in
non-random patterns with extensive variations in the expression between both tissues, including
different brain regions, and individuals. Furthermore, the patterns of such transcripts varied more
between individuals in brain regions than other tissues.
Conclusion: Thus, regulated expression of non-coding regions of the human genome appears to
include the HERV-W family of repetitive elements. Although it remains to be established whether
such expression patterns represent leakage from transcription of functional regions or specific
transcription, the current approach proves itself useful for studying detailed expression patterns of
repetitive regions.

Background
The human genome contains approximately 3 billion
base pairs. Only approximately 2% of these encode the
proteins which carry out almost all of the known cellular
functions [1]. The remaining 98% of the human genome
has, by and large, been considered "junk" DNA. During
recent years, data from tiling arrays and large-scale
sequencing of cDNAs indicates that large amounts of the

junk DNA is transcribed, not only intronic DNA as parts
of unprocessed pre-mRNAs, but as tightly regulated cellspecific transcripts from both strands in intronic as well as
intergenic regions (for a review see[2]). Approximately
8% of our genome consists of sequences classified as
human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), ancient remnants of retroviral integrations and their subsequent
expansions in the genomes of our ancestors [3]. These

HERV elements have degenerated over millions of year of
evolution and can, with few exceptions, no longer encode
complete proteins let alone engender infectious viral particles [4-11]. Since genomic regions harboring repetitive
elements, including HERV, are for methodological reasons usually excluded from array-based large-scale expression studies, their potential transcriptional activities and
biological relevance remain largely uncharacterized,
despite the numerous observations of their differential
expression in human diseases [12-18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/532

In the present study we applied these techniques to determine expression patterns of transcripts containing HERVW gag sequences with unprecedented resolution, however, absolute expression level differences between tissues
were not examined. We report expression pattern profiling of transcripts containing HERV-W gag sequences in
human primary fibroblast cultures and tissues including;
blood, thymus, spleen, ovary, testis, liver, and regions of
the brain.

Results
As for the rest of the genome, evidence is mounting that
genomic regions containing HERV elements are transcriptionally active in human tissues, see [10,19,20] and
related references. Systematic studies of HERV expression
patterns across tissues have been limited to quantifying
expression of single elements or collective expression of
entire HERV families [5,7,21-23]. These studies suggest
that levels of transcripts encoding HERV elements vary
between tissues [21-24]. The repetitive nature of HERVs
makes designing assays that specifically detect individual
elements difficult and carefully optimized probe assays
are usually required for specificity [25]. The sheer number
of members in the different HERV families [26] makes it a
prohibitively expensive and sample consuming to determine expression patterns of more than a few elements
within the different HERV families. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of expression patterns of individual members of a HERV family across tissues and individuals has
not previously been performed. We have previously used
analysis of melting temperatures (Tm) in semi-quantitative PCRs (qPCR) as a proxy marker of sequence differences between amplicons generated by primers targeted
toward the HERV-W family [27,28]. By manually categorizing melting temperatures into 3-4 distinct groups, cell
type specific expression patterns of HERV-W elements in
human cell lines were observed [27]. Sequencing and
mapping of PCR-products representative of these different
groups indicated that a number of genomic loci were transcriptionally active in these cells. Cell-type specific
changes in the expression patterns following serum deprivation or influenza A/WSN/33 virus infection indicate
regulated expression of several of these loci.
We recently refined the Tm-assay by using a molecular
beacon as an internal control for temperature variations
over the heat-block in the thermocycler and an automated
analysis program for more precise and unbiased Tm
acquisition. By this approach, the resolution was
improved by a factor of ten [29] allowing acquisition of
more detailed data. These data can subsequently be analyzed by application of mixture models analysis for an
objective determination of minimum numbers of
sequences represented by the detected Tms and the frequency distributions of these Tms [30].

We applied the Gaussian curve fitting and temperature
normalization with a molecular beacon method previously described [29] to human tissue samples. When we
had accumulated 2775 individual Tm observations from
a wide range of human tissues we constructed a model (as
described in [30]) of the minimum number of Tm categories required to explain the spread of the data (based on
that the SD of recording a single Tm in the instrument was
0.06°C [29]). The mixture model Tm-analysis technique
predicted a model of mixture proportions into 13 Tm categories. This number of categories was found to be optimal according to Akaike's information criterion (Figure 1)
as previously described [30]. With this model we proceeded to fit sets of individual Tms recorded from tissues
to the model consisting of the 13 Tm categories.
Data points were subsequently plotted in frequency distribution histograms visualizing expression patterns in different tissue and cell types, Figure 2A. To investigate if
expression patterns of transcripts containing HERV-W gag
sequences differ between regions of the human brain, four
regions of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum were analyzed. Frequency histograms presenting these data are presented in Figure 2B. To investigate the extent of interindividual variation of expression of transcripts containing HERV-W gag, we also analyzed whole blood obtained
from seven blood-donors, Figure 2C. To try to distinguish
the genetic from the environmental components of the
expression patterns of HERV-W gag elements, we
employed cultures of human primary fibroblasts from
healthy individuals and subjected them to serum deprivation. This was also intended as a high resolution follow up
from our previous work on the environmental influence
on expression pattern of HERV-W gag elements[27], Figure 2D.
Heat-maps of p-values obtained from pair-wise Chisquare comparisons of expression patterns in the different
tissues are illustrated in Figure 2E-H. All comparisons,
except that between spleen and PBMC, suggest significantly differing patterns of transcripts containing HERVW sequences in human tissues, Figure 2E. Similarly,
expression of such transcripts also differed between the
investigated regions of the brain (Figure 2F). Blood sam-

ples were smaller than those observed between different
tissues or brain regions (Figure 3B). Patterns of HERV-W
gag expression between individuals varied more in brain
regions than in spleen tissue samples, whole blood or primary fibroblast cultures. Taken together, variation in
expression patterns in primary fibroblast cultures were
reduced in response to serum deprivation (Figure 3C).

ples from the different individuals, however, exhibited a
far more homogenous expression pattern (Figure 2G). We
observed that primary fibroblast cultures exhibited a
higher degree of variation between individuals than the
less cytologically defined whole blood samples (though
not from the same individuals, Figure 2H). The patterns
became more similar between individuals in response to
serum deprivation, in line with the hypothesis that HERVW gag expression correlates to specific expression changes.
To illustrate the degree of variation in expression patterns
between samples, we calculated the relative distances
(summed square differences of Tm-categories) between
single tissues and averages of tissues (Figure 3). Of all tissues tested, thymus and testis exhibited the most differing
expression patterns of transcripts containing HERV-W gag
sequences (Figure 3A). Indeed, approximately 70% of all
transcripts detected in cDNA from testis or thymus
matched single Tm-categories, whereas the distribution
was more even between Tm categories in other tissues.
The distances calculated between individual blood sam-

We next looked at similarities in expression patterns
between tissues by constructing neighbor-joining trees
based on correlations in expression patterns between samples. As can be seen from Figure 4, brain regions were
more closely correlated to each other than to other tissues.
Similarly, placenta, spleen, thymus and PBMC were also
more closely correlated to each other than to the brain
regions or gonads. Blood samples had a relatively even
distribution of mixing proportions into the 13 Tm categories and are consequently poorly correlated to all other tissue samples.

Discussion
We here report expression patterns of transcripts containing HERV-W gag sequences in human tissues. Transcripts
containing HERV sequences in general, along with other
repetitive regions of the genome are generally not prioritized in human genomics studies. Due to the difficulty in
finding specific primers and probe sequences, cross-reactions between different elements would render regular
PCR or array based techniques ineffective for distinguishing individual members within a HERV-family. Tm-analysis has the advantage of detecting variations in the
sequence of an amplified region, predicting the least
number of different sequences required to account for a
set of Tm data. It can, however, never predict more than
the minimum number of different sequences as different
sequences can have indistinguishable Tms [29]. Expression pattern variations between such sequences can therefore remain undetected. However, with Tm-analysis it is
possible to screen samples for differences in expression
patterns requiring sequencing of only a limited number of
products within a Tm category of interest. These can subsequently be differentially analyzed by more specific
assays, as exemplified in [28] or can be sequenced selectively based on Tm. The approach used allows a higher
resolution of repetitive sequence analysis without the
expense of large scale sequencing. The evaluation of cost
versus gain in information of the method used here as
compared to the high throughput sequencing data produced in next generation sequencing technologies is a
subject for future studies.
The current findings illustrate part of the hidden complexity of the human transcriptome. We can conclude that
expression of HERV-W gag sequences varies between
human tissues systematically and consequently in a non-

Distances between all tissues studied. To illustrate the degree of variation in HERV-W gag expression patterns between
tissue types and individuals, distances (mean squared differences of mixing proportions) were calculated. The average frequency distributions in all non-CNS and CNS tissues were used as references, which were calculated by adding all corresponding tissue data together. Distances from the references to individual tissues were defined as the sums of squares of mixing
proportion differences, Tm-category by Tm-category. Panel A shows the variation in HERV-W gag expression pattern
between averages of tissues. The red lines indicate distances between each CNS tissue to the average frequency distribution of
all CNS tissues. The blue lines indicate distances between each non-CNS tissue to the average of all non-CNS tissues. The
green line connecting the two nodes represents the distance between average CNS and non-CNS tissue frequency distributions. Panel B shows variations in HERV-W gag expression pattern between individuals and tissues for the subset of the data
where individual tissue samples were available. The green, red and blue lines are the same as in Panel A. The distance to each
individual is calculated relative to the average frequency distribution of each tissue. Panel C shows the variation in HERV-W gag
expression pattern between human primary fibroblast cultures and the variation after serum deprivation. The two nodes represent the average pattern of expression in the five individual cultures under control and serum deprived culture conditions.

blood samples depending on age, gender, time of day and
health status [35], despite this whole blood exhibited the
most homogenous expression pattern of the tissues investigated here. Interestingly, expression patterns in brain tissue exhibited the largest variation across individuals of all
tissues examined. Since spleen samples obtained from the
same individuals, displayed far less variation, these findings cannot be attributed to post-mortem or nucleic acid
purification artifacts. Indeed, Franz and coworkers [36]
reported that death caused exaggerated homogeneity in
expression profiles of coding transcripts in human brain.
Human fibroblasts lines from different individuals were
maintained for 3-5 passages under identical conditions,
yet differences between individuals remained, regardless
of treatment. Thus, in addition to environmental cues,
genetic or epigenetic components [37] appear to contribute to the HERV-W gag expression patterns.

random fashion. Tissue type and cell composition appear
to be a larger determinant of the expression profile of such
transcripts than the individual from which the tissues
were obtained. For instance the expression profile of
HERV-W gag containing transcripts in testis, a pooled
sample of, according to the manufacturer, 53 individuals
contained only 3 categories of 13 possible represented (an
unlikely finding if expression was random).
Neighbor-joining of the Pearson correlation coefficients
resulted in a dendrogram which groups brain regions and
gonads together and tissues rich in cells of the immune
system together. This dendrogram resembles similar constructs built from coding transcript expression data [31],
indicating that transcripts containing HERV-W gag elements vary between tissues similarly to such transcripts.
Due to the limited number of data points the tree structure is not stable and is hence only an indication of similarities. Previous studies on transcription in different
tissues, including different brain regions, suggest that
functional specialization is reflected at the level of transcription [32-34]. Based on the clustering of tissues in Figure 4, it appears as if this extends also to the transcription
of HERV-W elements.
We observed that the degree of differences in expression
patterns of HERV-W gag elements between individuals
was not constant across tissues and cells. Expression patterns of coding transcripts are known to vary in whole

Whether this tissue specific transcription is a consequence
of specific mechanisms or reflects transcriptional leakage
from transcription of coding regions remains to be established. Indeed, putative promoter structures (i.e. long terminal repeat regions) in the HERV-W and other families
are active in human cells [20,24]. Recent studies indicate
that tens of thousands of human transcripts are initiated
at retroviral promoters [38]. Furthermore, Gogvadze and
coworkers [39] recently reported functions of HERV-K
transcripts in regulation of gene expression.

Conclusion
Our current findings that human tissues harbor patterned
and extensive expression of genomic loci containing
HERV-W elements, suggests that functionality for such
transcripts cannot be ruled out. Finally, the methodological approach used here proves itself useful for detailed
analyses of transcripts originating from repetitive regions.
The potential applications for this method would be to
examine expression pattern alterations of repetitive
sequences in disease states. Detailed expression patterns
of repetitive elements have yet to be explored in cancers or
neurodegenerative diseases where specific or total expression changes have been documented. This methodological approach might be useful for determining whether
such quantitative changes originate from specific loci or
from global expression changes of repetitive elements.

Methods
Tissue isolation and culture
To establish fibroblast culture, one 2-mm diameter cutaneous biopsies were taken from five volunteers following
informed consent. Samples were ground and placed in a
6-well plate under a sterile glass cover slip. Fibroblasts
were subsequently cultured in DMEM/20% FCS/non
essential amino acids/penicillin/streptomycin/sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a humidified

37 C, 5% CO incubator. The study was approved by the
regional ethics committee (04-273/1; 2006/637-32).
Cells were used between passages 3 and 5.
RNA preparation and first strand synthesis
Human oligo d(T)-primed cDNA samples generated from
ovary, thymus, testis and placenta were purchased from
Ambion (Austin, TX, USA). Human whole blood samples
were volunteered anonymously from blood donors. Samples of human spleen, cerebellum, frontal, orbital, motor,
occipital and parietal cortices as well as cortex from the
medial temporal, superior temporal and cingulated gyri
from three anonymous donors were obtained from the
Stanley Brain Collection (Bethesda, MD, USA). Total RNA
from blood was prepared according to the manufacturer's
instructions using Qiazol and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). All other samples were prepared with
the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and prepared on a QIAcube
(Qiagen). Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using oligod(T)12-18 primers and Superscript II reagents (Invitrogen)
as previously described [29].
Real-time PCR and Tm analysis
Realtime PCR was run on an ABI Prism 7000 SDS
(Applied Biosystems) with a Precision Plate Holder
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), white
Thermo-Fast® 96 Detection Plates (ABgene, Epsom, UK)
and the version 1.2.3 SDS software package (Applied Biosystems). Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG
(Invitrogen) was used in each of the 25 μl reactions containing 250 nM of forward (TCAGGTCAACAATAGGATGACAACA)
and
reverse
(CAATGAGGGTCTACACTGGGAACT) primers (Invitrogen) directed at the HERV-W gag gene and 133 nM of the
Tm probe (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium) as previously
described [29]. Samples of cDNA were added in a dilution
containing approximately one template molecule per
reaction. Melting temperature profiles observed with
more than one peak, a broader peak than expected from
one sequence or no peaks were excluded. Tm data was
generated with GcTm http://www.neuro.ki.se/kristens
son/Tmanalysis.html as previously described [29]. Tm
data was analyzed by mixture models analysis as previously described [30].

Distances between tissues were calculated, based on variance in mixing proportions, as the sum of the square of
the difference, for every Tm category, of the mixing proportion between a tissue and the average of tissues.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/532

The neighbor joining method was used to group averages
of tissue samples based on pair-wise comparisons of (1-r).
Statistics
Data on frequency distributions into Tm categories (mixing proportions) in different tissues was compared by
Chi-squared tests (GraphPad Prism 3.02, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Differences between distances were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test, p <
0.01 was considered significant.
