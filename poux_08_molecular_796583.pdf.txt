Abstract
Background: Malagasy tenrecs belong to the Afrotherian clade of placental mammals and comprise three
subfamilies divided in eight genera (Tenrecinae: Tenrec, Echinops, Setifer and Hemicentetes; Oryzorictinae:
Oryzorictes, Limnogale and Microgale; Geogalinae:Geogale). The diversity of their morphology and incomplete taxon
sampling made it difficult until now to resolve phylogenies based on either morphology or molecular data for this
group. Therefore, in order to delineate the evolutionary history of this family, phylogenetic and dating analyses
were performed on a four nuclear genes dataset (ADRA2B, AR, GHR and vWF) including all Malagasy tenrec
genera. Moreover, the influence of both taxon sampling and data partitioning on the accuracy of the estimated
ages were assessed.
Results: Within Afrotheria the vast majority of the nodes received a high support, including the grouping of hyrax
with sea cow and the monophyly of both Afroinsectivora (Macroscelidea + Afrosoricida) and Afroinsectiphillia
(Tubulidentata + Afroinsectivora). Strongly supported relationships were also recovered among all tenrec genera,
allowing us to firmly establish the grouping of Geogale with Oryzorictinae, and to confirm the previously
hypothesized nesting of Limnogale within the genus Microgale. The timeline of Malagasy tenrec diversification does
not reflect a fast adaptive radiation after the arrival on Madagascar, indicating that morphological specializations
have appeared over the whole evolutionary history of the family, and not just in a short period after colonization.
In our analysis, age estimates at the root of a clade became older with increased taxon sampling of that clade.
Moreover an augmentation of data partitions resulted in older age estimates as well, whereas standard deviations
increased when more extreme partition schemes were used.
Conclusion: Our results provide as yet the best resolved gene tree comprising all Malagasy tenrec genera, and
may lead to a revision of tenrec taxonomy. A timeframe of tenrec evolution built on the basis of this solid
phylogenetic framework showed that morphological specializations of the tenrecs may have been affected by
environmental changes caused by climatic and/or subsequent colonization events. Analyses including various
taxon sampling and data partitions allow us to point out some possible pitfalls that may lead to biased results in
molecular dating; however, further analyses are needed to corroborate these observations.

Background
The Malagasy tenrecs belong to the Afrotheria, one of the
four basal clades of placental mammals which have
recently been recognized [1]. This ancient group of African origin is divided into two clades: the strongly supported Paenungulata, composed of the orders Sirenia (sea
cows), Proboscidea (elephants) and Hyracoidea
(hyraxes), and the Afroinsectiphillia [2], comprising the
orders Afrosoricida (golden moles and tenrecs), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews) and Tubulidentata (aardvark)
[3,4]. The tenrec family (Tenrecidae) comprises four subfamilies, the Potamogalinae from continental Africa, and
the Tenrecinae, Geogalinae and Oryzorictinae from
Madagascar. The Malagasy tenrecs are divided into eight
genera and 30 species [5-8]. Based on morphology, tenrecs were previously grouped in the insectivorous order
Lipotyphla, which has turned out to be biphyletic and
now is split into the orders Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs,
moles, shrews, solenodons) and Afrosoricida [9].
The Malagasy tenrecs have diversified into a spectacular
radiation in terms of morphology, behavior, physiology
and ecology. They show a high degree of adaptation to
their niches (terrestrial, semi-arboreal, fossorial and semiaquatic) and considerable convergence with other insectivores, notably shrews and hedgehogs. This made it difficult to understand the origin and phylogenetic
relationships of this group on a morphological basis. The
Tenrecinae (spiny tenrecs) include four genera (Hemicentetes, Tenrec, Setifer, Echinops), characterized by a spiny
pelage and a large body size compared to the other tenrecs. Their monophyly is well established, even at the
morphological level [10]. The branching of the four
remaining genera (Geogale, Oryzorictes, Limnogale and
Microgale), which share a shrew-like appearance and a
small size, remains more open. Most earlier, molecular
studies did not include more than five tenrec species [1115], while Poux et al. [16] missed the large-eared tenrec
(Geogale). Therefore, not all relations between and within
the three subfamilies of Malagasy tenrecs have yet been
firmly established. Only two recent studies, by Olson and
Goodman [17] and Asher and Hofreiter [18], included all
tenrec genera, but were unable to confidently resolve the
position of Geogale, which suggests the necessity to
expand the number of species and sequences for this family.
The island of Madagascar is a well-known biodiversity
hotspot, displaying diverse and highly endemic amphibian, reptilian and mammalian faunas. The level of endemism reaches 95% for the non-flying vertebrates, and this
level is mainly due to a few speciose endemic radiations
[19-21]. Four clades of terrestrial endemic mammals are
present, the lemuriform primates, the euplerine carnivores, the nesomyine rodents and the Malagasy tenrecs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/102

Each of these clades represents one unique event of colonization from continental Africa, followed by several
diversification events that gave rise to the actual Malagasy
diversity [16,22]. The colonization of a new environment
can be followed by an adaptive radiation, defined as a
rapid succession of speciation events leading to a high
ecological and phenotypic diversity within a lineage [23].
The study of adaptive radiations on islands or in lakes is
essential for understanding processes of speciation and
diversification [24-26]. Therefore, knowing the patterns
and timing of the successive diversification events within
endemic island clades, which, like tenrecs, display a broad
ecological and morphological diversity, might help to better understand this phenomenon.
Apart from Echinops telfairi, for which the genome
sequencing is in progress, there are only a limited number
of sequences available in public databases to reconstruct a
solid molecular phylogeny of the Malagasy tenrecs. In the
present study we therefore selected exons from four independent nuclear genes that are widely used in mammalian
phylogeny (ADRA2B, AR, GHR and vWF) in order to
resolve tenrec phylogeny. This study is especially focused
on understanding the phylogenetic position of the largeeared and the web-footed tenrecs, Geogale and Limnogale,
respectively. In addition, we used a relaxed molecular
clock timeframe to compare tenrec evolutionary patterns
with defined adaptive radiation characteristics. Moreover,
the influence of both taxon sampling and data partitioning on the accuracy of the estimated ages were assessed.

Results and Discussion
Afrotherian phylogeny
The overall phylogenetic relationships as deduced from
the concatenated dataset are consistent with the now
broadly accepted branching pattern of the mammalian
tree [1] (Figure 1). The superordinal clades Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria and Afrotheria are highly supported,
and within these clades most bootstrap percentages and
posterior probabilities are also high. Afrotheria is now
generally accepted as a natural group since molecular
studies unanimously support its monophyly, using various methods [1,4,27-29]. In contrast, until now only few
morphological synapomorphies, notably placental morphology [30], an increase in number of thoracolumbar
vertebrae [31], and testicondy [32], appear to support this
grouping. Afrotheria are divided into Paenungulata on
one hand and the three remaining afrotherian orders
(Afrosoricida, Macroscelidea and Tubulidentata) on the
other hand. The most probable hypothesis concerning
these remaining orders is their grouping within a clade
called Afroinsectiphillia [1,3,28] within which the internal relationships remain unclear.

Bayesian analyses result in an identical topology. Nodes receiving high support (BP ≥ 90% and PP ≥ 0.99) are marked with filled

Although the overall phylogenetic relationships as deduced from the present tree are consistent with the broadly accepted
branching pattern of the mammalian tree [1], the phylogenetic position of the Eulipotyphla, displaying a high PP node support
value, deviates from this consensus. The length of the branch connecting eutherians to the marsupial outgroup was reduced six
times. Taxa not indicated by species name are represented by different species in the concatenated dataset, and the higher taxonomic unit is indicated (Table 1).

Within the paenungulate clade the Tethytheria (elephants
+ sea cows) are strongly supported by morphological and
complete mitochondrial genome data [33,34]. Nuclear
genes are ambiguous about this relationship and left the
phylogenetic affinities between the three paenungulate
orders essentially unresolved [1,14,35,36]. Our concatenated tree shows for the first time, based on nuclear genes,
strong support for one of the three possible hypotheses:
the grouping of Hyracoidea with Sirenia (PP = 0.99 and
BP = 89). Bootstrap trees supporting alternative hypotheses exclusively group elephant with hyrax (BP = 11); Tethytheria is never recovered. All four genes independently
support this result; the high support for the sea cow +
hyrax grouping is therefore expectedly due to the synergy
of these non-conflicting informations. To test whether our
extensive taxon sampling within Tenrecidae may have
improved the phylogenetic accuracy [37,38], all tenrecs
but one (Tenrec ecaudatus) were removed from a new analysis. The results did not differ much; support for the Sirenia/Hyracoidea clade dropped negligibly in the
concatenated analyses (PP = 0.98 and BP = 86). Interestingly, in a retroposon insertion analysis, Nishihara et al.
[4] found one insertion supporting exclusively the grouping of hyrax with dugong. These authors dismissed the
apparent synapomorphous hyrax-sea cow insertion as
homoplastic, in favor of the morphological evidence for
Tethytheria.
Similarly, the relations between the afroinsectiphillian
orders have not yet been clarified, and conclusions vary in
different studies. Mitochondrial data give highly inconsistent results [34,39], while mixed data tend to group
golden moles and tenrecs with elephant shrews, together
being the sister group of aardvark, with rather strong support [1,35,40]. Our data also support these results, as the
Afrosoricida/Macroscelidea clade (= Afroinsectivora) is
displayed with high confidence (PP = 1.00 and BP = 93),
and Tubulidentata is found to be the sister group of this
clade (PP = 1.00 and BP = 95). With a smaller dataset
(only one tenrec) the support for the Afrosoricida/Macroscelidea clade slightly increased (PP = 1.00 and BP = 96).
Hence, enlarged taxon sampling cannot explain our
strong phylogenetic results within the afrotherian clade.
All four genes separately displayed Afroinsectiphillia
either as paraphyletic or weakly supported therefore the
present results are not due to gene sampling biases. The
retroposon analyses of Nishihara et al. [4] proposed the
grouping of golden moles, tenrecs and aardvark, to the
exclusion of elephant shrews, on the basis of two shared
retrotransposons.
Phylogenetic position of Geogale aurita
The large-eared tenrec (G. aurita) has been included until
now in only two molecular studies, by Olson and Goodman [17] and by Asher and Hofreiter [18]. These two stud-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/102

ies found two different results concerning its phylogenetic
position. The first study, comprising three mitochondrial
genes (ND2, 12s rRNA and tRNAvaline) and one nuclear
marker (vWF exon 28), displayed, in a parsimony framework, the large-eared tenrec as the most basal of all Malagasy tenrecs. This result was not influenced by the
inclusion of morphological characters in the analyses.
Asher and Hofreiter [18], using exon 10 of the GHR gene
and morphological data, found Geogale nested within the
Oryzorictinae, as sister group of the Microgale/Limnogale
clade.
In the present study we also sequenced GHR exon 10 and
vWF exon 28, and in addition the intronless gene for
ADRA2B and the first exon of AR. For all genes separately
the results were congruent in placing Geogale as sister
group of the Oryzorictinae (Figure 2), although not
always strongly supported: ADRA2B: PP = 1.00, BP = 96;
AR: PP = 0.77, BP = 86; GHR: PP = 0.64, BP = 59; vWF: PP
= 0.93, BP = 61. Concatenation of the four genes led to a
stronger support for this node: PP = 1.00 and BP = 93 (Figure 1). The position of G. aurita as sister group of the
Oryzorictinae (Oryzorictes, Limnogale, Microgale) seems
thus strongly supported. However, the KH- and SH-tests
(Table 1) did not completely confirm the strength of our
results, showing that placing Geogale as the most basal
Malagasy taxon (Olson and Goodman's hypothesis) was
indeed significantly worse than our best tree, but placing
it within the Oryzorictinae (Asher and Hofreiter's hypothesis) did not significantly change the likelihood of the
topology.
The differences with the results of Olson and Goodman
[17] probably stem from the fact that we did not use the
same phylogenetic methods and datasets, even though
one of our markers was in common (vWF exon 28). However, their vWF (exon 28) sequences are not yet available
in public sources like GenBank to be compared with ours.
The different position of Geogale in the tree of Asher and
Hofreiter [18] is more difficult to explain. Remarkably,
their Geogale GHR sequence (Acc. Nr.: DQ202287) displays 18 differences with ours (10 synonymous and 8
non-synonymous substitutions). No mutations leading to
unusual amino acid changes that might indicate sequencing errors could be detected. To try and explain the different Geogale GHR sequences we calculated Ka and Ks for
each sequence pair of Malagasy tenrecs. The results
showed that the sequence divergence between the two
Geogale specimens was greater than between some of the
other tenrec genera, like Echinops/Setifer and Limnogale/
Microgale (Table 2). Moreover, the new Geogale sequence
from this study was slightly more divergent in most comparisons than the one from the database (Table 2). This
genetic diversity within Geogale could reflect that this
genus might contain in fact more than one species. It may

also be mentioned that the museum specimen used by
Asher and Hofreiter [18] was collected at the southwest
coast of the island (Lamboharana, voucher number MCZ
45044), whereas our specimen (voucher number MVZ
mammal # 220648) was sampled in the central west in
the Menabe area. Considering photos of living Geogale

available to us from the south-west (by W. R. Branch) and
the central-west (by R. Nincheri and ourselves), the central western specimens appear to have a less goldencolored fur and in general a more gracile habitus, but it is
unclear whether this may reflect a difference between coloration of adults versus subadults. Clearly, a detailed tax-

onomic study is needed to confirm whether these
differences are constant and the populations may represent two distinct species. Furthermore, a single record of
Geogale exists also from the east coast near Fenoarivo. This
specimen has been described as subspecies Geogale aurita
orientalis by Grandidier and Petit [41], but the status of
this taxon has remained obscure. It may be a candidate
nomen to be elevated to species rank if Geogale aurita is
demonstrated to consist of more than one species.
Further phylogenetic analyses of the GHR dataset, including both Geogale sequences or removing all segregating
sites between the two sequences, led to the same result as
obtained by Asher and Hofreiter [18], i.e. Geogale nested
within the Oryzorictinae. The phylogenetic position of
Geogale as sister group of Oryzorictinae was only obtained
when our sequence alone was used. However, both
Geogale sequences always grouped together, confirming
the identity of our sequence. These results, in combination with the fact that the Oryzorictinae/Geogalinae clade
radiated very fast, might make it difficult to reach a final
consensus on the evolution of Geogale.
From a morphological point of view the phylogenetic
relation between Geogale and the Oryzorictinae has never
been clear. Although most studies gave unresolved results
[[10], Olson [1999] in [17,18]], two were concordant

with ours [42,43], while none has ever argued that Geogale
was either the sister group of all Malagasy tenrecs or the
sister group of the Limnogale/Microgale clade. Salton and
Szalay [43] reached the conclusion that the tarsal morphology of Geogale warrants its status as a separate subfamily, and suggested its closer affiliation with
Oryzorictinae than with Tenrecinae.
Three genera of fossil tenrecids – Erythrozootes, Protenrec
and Parageogale – from the Kenyan and Namibian
Miocene (16–24 Mya; Million years ago) have been discovered until now [44-46]. As Parageogale is thought to be
the sister group of the extant Geogale aurita [45], these data
would suggest a more complex dispersal history than the
"one time dispersal event" deduced from the monophyly
of Malagasy tenrecs. Asher and Hofreiter [18] were the
first to include these three fossil tenrecids in a phylogenetic framework. Their result confirmed the position of
the Kenyan fossils as Geogale's closest relatives. However,
alternative hypothesis (e.g., monophyly of the Malagasy
tenrecs) could not be ruled out indicating the uncertainty
of the Parageogale/Geogale affinity. Recent studies have
argued that the sweepstakes dispersal model (dispersal
with small and random probability of success) from
Africa to Madagascar suffers from many inconveniences,
among which the fact that prevailing winds and currents
between Africa and Madagascar would be much more

likely to favor transports from the island to the African
continent, rather than the reverse route [47,48]. Therefore, if a second dispersal event ever occurred it was most
probably from Madagascar to Africa. Olson and Goodman [17] suggested a basal position of Geogale among
Malagasy tenrecs and argued that, if true, this would only
imply a minimum of two dispersal events, whereas any
other scenario would require at least three. However, a
back dispersal of Parageogale from Madagascar to Africa
would only assume a second dispersal event, independent
of the phylogenetic position of Geogale.
Phylogenetic position of Limnogale mergulus
Due to its semi-aquatic life style, shared with the African
Potamogalinae, the determination of the phylogenetic
relationship of Limnogale, the web-footed tenrec, has led
to controversies. Its specialized morphological features
brought some authors to the conclusion that Limnogale
was either sister group of the Potamogalinae [10] or sister
group of all other Malagasy tenrecs [42], the semi-aquatic
behavior then being seen as an ancestral state and a key
element to facilitate over-water dispersal. In contrast,
other morphological studies challenged this view by
affirming that Limnogale had closer relationships to the
shrew tenrecs (Microgale), and that the semi-aquatic
behavior was an example of convergence acquired twice
during tenrec evolution [Guth et al.[1959] in [17], Olson
[1999] in [17]]. This strong affinity between Limnogale
and Microgale has recently also been supported by a study
of hind limb muscles [49]. These authors argue that Limnogale may have been derived from a Microgale-like terrestrial ancestor. Molecular studies have now confirmed this
last hypothesis [16-18]. Supporting the hypothesis of
Olson and Goodman [17], our study shows that the semiaquatic Limnogale is actually nested within the shrew tenrec genus and not a sister clade of it (Figure 1), now with
more elaborate analyses and strong support from four
nuclear genes.

pling broad enough to delineate the successive tenrec
speciation events. The study by Douady et al. [13] was
based on a linearized tree method and suggests an early
diversification of Tenrecs as compared to the other studies
(for the present study see Figure 3), which are based on
Bayesian methods and partially overlapping gene sampling (Table 3). Consequently, the results of the latter
three studies are, as can be expected, rather similar. The
present study, with the broadest taxon and gene sampling,
estimates the tenrecs/golden mole split at 69 ± 4 Mya, followed by the divergence between African and Malagasy
tenrecs at 47 ± 4 Mya. The Malagasy tenrec radiation
began 29 ± 3 Mya, and several diversification events
spread over time gave rise to the totality of Malagasy tenrec genera around between 20 ± 1 Mya and 7 ± 1 Mya
(Table 3 and Figure 3). These datings are slightly older
than previously calculated. The only gene difference
between this study and Poux et al. [16] is the inclusion of
the GHR gene. Removing it from the calculations led to
dates even a little older and with wider confidence intervals (Table 3).

The phylogenetic supports displayed in the present study
are quite low, even with the concatenated dataset (PP =
0.67 and BP = 59), probably due to the fact that the Microgale/Limnogale clade may have radiated very fast (Figure
1). Only one gene, GHR, presents a high PP of 0.99 for the
cluster of Microgale cf. parvula/Limnogale mergulus (Figure
2). The sequencing of more shrew tenrec species (a total
of 21 species has been recorded [5-8]) might help to
resolve this issue, and subsequently to understand the
morphological evolution of the aquatic specialization of
the web-footed tenrec.

Because the GHR influence on the dating was very small,
the difference in taxon sampling between the two studies
might be responsible for the different outcomes [50]. In
the present study carnivores and primates were less extensively sampled, whereas Afrosoricida were better represented than in Poux et al. [16]. We therefore compared for
these three clades the age inferences in Poux et al. [16] and
in the present study, with or without GHR (Table 4). The
conclusion is that the age of a given node tends to become
older when the taxon sampling around this node (or
descending from it) increases. This phenomenon has
already been described by Yoder and Yang [51] when
assessing the timing of evolution of mouse lemurs. They
suspected that these incongruences were due to the model
used [52], which breaks down the path from a tip of the
tree to the root (or ancestral node) into identically distributed segments. Such a prior would tend to push divergence time within the clade under study towards
unrealistically old ages. Comparing the priors of divergence times between both large and small datasets, they
reached the conclusion that the too old priors of the larger
dataset had influenced the posterior estimates, which
became older as well. This also is the pattern we can see
comparing the priors of Poux et al. [16] with the ones of
the present study (dataset without GHR). In both studies
the time estimate differences were not dramatic, but they
could have a problematic effect for studies requiring more
precise estimates.

Tenrec diversification timing
Only three studies have previously assessed the timing of
tenrec diversification, mainly to understand their colonization pattern [13,14,16]; none comprised a taxon sam-

The influence of data partitioning was tested as well. The
ages of the nodes in the phylogenetic tree increased with
the number of partitions (Figure 4A), and the smallest
standard deviations (and therefore confidence intervals)

were reached for the less extreme numbers of partitions
(Figure 4B). However, for the present study, differences in
taxon sampling or partitioning did not affect our conclusions, as the various analyses displayed fairly similar
results, showing reciprocal overlaps. This is to our knowledge the first time that the influence of data partitioning
on dating results has been empirically pointed out. More
investigations are needed to generalize and clearly understand the underlying causes of this result. One might however suppose that the differences between the various
partitions could increase with the number of genes
included in an analysis. Consequently, these results show
that it is important, in order to calculate datings as accurately as possible, to select the right manner of partitioning the data: too few or too many partitions might lead to
biased results.

To exclude the possibility that individual calibration constraints may bias our dating analyses, we repeated them
after removing each calibration point in turn following
[16]. Hereby we could check whether the excluded calibration constraint was accurately estimated by the
remaining ones. All datings remained highly congruent
when any of the six calibration points was removed. The
average percentage difference between the main analysis
and the ones with only 5 constrained nodes ranges
between 0.1 and 0.8 percent. Only the paenungulate calibration seems to have a somewhat larger impact on the
dating as its removal from the analysis increases the estimated node age by 4.8 percent. This influence is however
too slight to have an impact on our conclusions (Additional files 1 and 2). Moreover, the calibrations were
reciprocally compatible: the remaining five calibrations
always recovered a posterior estimate (± SD) for the

Since Geogale has been hypothesized by Olson and Goodman [17] to be the first Malagasy tenrec genus to have
diverged, its absence from Poux et al. [16] was a problem
for drawing final conclusions about tenrec colonization
timing. It now appears that Geogale is nested within the
Malagasy tenrec clade, and therefore plays no role when
estimating the period of colonization. Consequently, the
window of colonization of Madagascar by tenrecs could
not be narrowed. As previously concluded in Poux et al.
[16], the tenrec colonization time completely overlaps
with the hypothetical time of existence of a land bridge
crossing the Mozambican channel (26–45 Mya; [53])
(Figure 3), which however is highly controversial [54].
Adaptive radiation often occurs when a species is introduced into a new environment, such as an island. One
might therefore expect that the majority of the diversification events within the Malagasy tenrecs would have
occurred soon after colonization. However, no such pattern of a diversification burst can be seen at the root of the

Malagasy tenrecs, and speciation events seem to be spread
through time (Figure 3). This could result from two possible scenarios: either Malagasy tenrecs may actually have
experienced a fast adaptive radiation, but most of the
resulting taxa are now extinct, or all genera appeared
indeed at different periods as a result of a slower speciation rate than expected in case of adaptive radiations.
Morphologically, one might speak about adaptive radiation of Malagasy tenrecs, but these morphological adaptations do not seem to have developed within a short time
span just after the colonization of Madagascar. The most
striking example is the semi-aquatic specialization of the
genus Limnogale, which dates at most from 11 Mya, i.e.,
20–38 My after the colonization of the island. The genus
Microgale is by far the most speciose amongst tenrecs,
being represented by 21 species [5-8], while the remaining
genera may not comprise more than one species. The
acceleration of the molecular evolutionary rates on the
internal branches leading to and within this genus (calculated with MULTIDIVTIME on the tree presented in Figure
1), associated with both a poor phylogenetic resolution
between the few Microgale species (Figs 1 and 2) and its
recency among the tenrec genera (Figure 3 and Table 5),
suggests that there has been a fast radiation around 11

Mya that gave rise to the current diversity of Microgale. It is
interesting to note that the other two endemic mammalian Malagasy genera for which radiation times have been
assessed apparently diverged around the same time as
Microgale: Eulemur at 9.7 Mya and Microcebus at 8.7–12
Mya [51]. However, not enough data are yet available to
confirm this parallel radiation phenomenon.
Even though the colonization of Madagascar by tenrecs
might have taken place during the Eocene, the radiation of
the extant species started after Madagascar reached its current geographical subtropical location during the early
Oligocene [55], with warmer climatological conditions
probably similar to the actual ones [56]. The colonization
of Madagascar by carnivores and rodents took place at the
end or just after the Oligocene, around 20–23.5 Mya for
rodents, and 19–26 Mya for carnivores (data taken from
[16] in order to compare results inferred from similar
datasets and methods). These dates are quite close to the
periods of appearance of extant tenrec genera: the radiation of Tenrecinae and the split between Tenrec and Hemicentetes occurred 20 ± 2 Mya and 16 ± 2 Mya, respectively;
Geogale split from the Oryzorictinae 24 ± 3 Mya; and
Oryzorictes separated from Microgale 22 ± 3 Mya. So five
out of the seven tenrec genera (Limnogale is taken here as
a Microgale) diverged soon after the colonization of Madagascar by carnivores and rodents. These new colonizations
may have altered the ecological conditions, and thereby
induced speciation within tenrecs, either by predation
pressure (carnivores) or by interspecific niche competition (rodents).

Conclusion
The complete phylogeny of the Malagasy tenrec genera
has now been resolved with strong support. These results
should lead to a revision of the taxonomy with regard to
the genus Geogale (if it comprises more than one species)
and the Limnogale/Microgale clade (if this last genus is
truly paraphyletic). This solid phylogenetic and dating
framework shows that the major morphological specializations of the tenrecs are not the result of fast adaptive
radiations just after colonization, but would as well have
been affected by ecological changes caused by climatic
and/or subsequent colonization events; however, more
work is still needed to understand the role of possible
biotic interactions on the speciation processes of Malagasy tenrecs.

Methods
Sampling, DNA amplification and sequencing
Fragments of the intronless gene of the alpha 2B adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), of exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, of exon 10 of the growth hormone receptor
(GHR) gene, and of exon 28 of the von Willebrand factor
(vWF) gene were amplified and sequenced. These genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/102

were selected because (i) they are located in the nuclear
genome, as single-copy genes (in at least human and
mouse), (ii) a considerable number of sequences are
already available for all four genes and have been useful
in mammalian phylogeny, and (iii) they are functionally
and genetically unrelated. We selected for each of the four
genes 38 mammalian species to represent (i) all genera of
Malagasy tenrecs, and at least two species of the very
diverse genus Microgale, in order to assess the phylogenetic position of Limnogale, (ii) the continental African
sister group (Potamogalinae) of the Malagasy tenrecs, (iii)
groups needed for multiple calibrations of the molecular
clock, (iv) at least one species from each eutherian order
(but for Pholidota), and (v) appropriate marsupial outgroups. A total of 19 new sequences were obtained, and
complemented with 134 sequences from GenBank (Table
5).
Genomic DNA was isolated from ethanol-preserved tissue, following the protocols of the Wizard® SV Genomic
DNA Purification System (Promega). Fragments of the
ADRA2B and AR genes were amplified using previously
published primers [16,57]. New primers were designed
for vWF and GHR (see Additional file 3). For these last
genes PCR reactions were performed on 50–200 ng DNA
with Expand DNA polymerase (Expand High Fidelity PCR
system, Roche) using the following program: 2 min at
94°C; 30–35 cycles of 15 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C and
1 min 30 sec at 72°C; and a final step of 2–10 min at
72°C. DMSO (1.3 – 2.5%) and/or betaine (1 M) was
added for some samples. PCR products were purified
from a 1% agarose gel, using GFX™ PCR DNA & Gel Band
Purification Kit (GE Healthcare), and reamplified if necessary. Gel-extracted PCR products were sequenced directly
on a 3730 96-capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Internal primers were used to get complete sequences of
both strands.
Phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were assembled and aligned with the ED editor
of the MUST package [58], and manually adjusted taking
amino acid properties in consideration. Amino acid
repeats and sites not sequenced or gapped in more than
25% of the taxa were excluded from analysis. This resulted
in a dataset of 1,101 bp for ADRA2B, 1,161 bp for AR, 852
bp for GHR, and 1,173 bp for vWF. The full data matrix is
available from Treebase (accession number: M3679).
Phylogenetic reconstructions on each gene separately and
on the concatenated dataset were performed by maximum
likelihood (ML) with PAUP*, version 4b10 [59], and by
Bayesian analyses with MRBAYES, version 3.1.2 [60]. The
best fitting model under the ML criterion was selected
from the "Akaike Criterion" output of MODELTEST, version 3.7 [61]. The ML analysis was conducted using a loop
approach to estimate the best tree and the optimal likeli-

hood parameters. With this approach parameters and best
tree are re-estimated until they reach stability. Node stability was estimated by 100 non-parametric bootstrap replicates [62]. A major advantage of Bayesian phylogenetic
inference is the possibility of partitioning the data, giving
each partition its own best fitting model of sequence evolution. However, overpartitioning may introduce unnecessary sampling variances which could influence the
phylogenetic estimates. For the twelve possible codon partitions (each codon position of each gene) MODELTEST
was used to calculate the best fitting model of sequence
evolution. As further explained in Table 6, codon partitions with similar models and model parameters were
merged, resulting in nine partitions for the Bayesian analyses. Two runs of four Markov chains were calculated
simultaneously for 1,000,000 generations with initial
equal probabilities for all trees and starting with a random
tree. Tree sampling frequency was each 20 generations,
and the consensus tree with posterior probabilities was
calculated after removal of the first 25% of the total
number of trees generated, corresponding to 12,500 trees.
The average standard deviation of split frequencies
between the two independent runs was lower than 0.01.
To assess the stability of the phylogenetic position of
Geogale aurita, our result was compared, according to both
Kishino and Hasegawa [63] and Shimodaira and Hasegawa [64] (using RELL bootstrap as well as full optimiza-

tion methods), to the hypotheses of Olson and Goodman
[17] and Asher and Hofreiter [18]. Furthermore, Ka (i.e.,
number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site) and Ks (i.e., number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) of pairwise tenrec sequences
were calculated using the program CODEML from the
PAML package [65] in order to assess the molecular divergence between the two Geogale GHR sequences and compare it with the level of molecular divergence displayed
within the Malagasy tenrec clade.
Molecular dating
We used the Bayesian approach [66] as implemented in
the MULTIDIVTIME program package [52], which relaxes
the molecular clock by allowing continuous autocorrelation of substitution rates among the branches of the phylogenetic tree. The concatenated sequence dataset was
partitioned into the same nine categories as for the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, and branch lengths were calculated under the F84 + Γ model of sequence evolution,
which is the most complex model available in MULTIDIVTIME. Each of the described analyses was run twice in
order to assess the consistency of the results. The prior for
the root was set at 100 Mya, however, analyses with 65
Mya, 80 Mya and 120 Mya as prior age were also performed in order to estimate the impact of the root prior on
our results. For each node, we calculated the variance of
the estimated ages over all the runs. A maximal variance

Best models and parameters were found with the akaike criterion as implemented in MODELTEST 3.7 and with PAML, for each codon position of
the four gene fragments. Codon positions with similar model and model parameters were regrouped into the same partition, which resulted in nine
partitions when estimated by MODELTEST and five partitions when estimated by PAML. Codon positions were merged into the same partition
when none of their model parameters (e.g., TRatio of position 1 compared to TRatio of position 2, PInvar 1 to PInvar 2, etc.) differed by more than
100%. For the parameters estimated by PAML we took also into account, to define the partitions, the rate of the various gamma low categories;
these parameters are not included in this table. TRatio, transition/transversion ratio; Rmat, rate matrix; π, base frequency; PInvar, proportion of
invariable sites; alpha, shape of gamma distribution; kappa, value of the transition/transversion ratio under the F84 model. CP stands for codon
position and PN for partition number.

of 2*10-4 was found showing that changing the root prior
does not influence age estimates. Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analyses were run for 1,000,000 generations after a
"burn in" of 100,000 generations. The chains were sampled every 100 generations. To assess the influence of a
particular partitioning on the dating results, we performed
additional analyses using four partitioning schemes: without partitioning, with nine partitions following the results
of MODELTEST, with five partitions following the results
of ESTBRANCHES using the F84 + Γ model, and with a
maximum number of partitions (i.e., twelve). The results
of these analyses were close to each other. Notably, all datings for the nodes of interest remained within the 95%
credibility intervals of the datings obtained in the analysis
using five partitions.
Six well established fossil constraints on divergence times
were used: (i) a minimum of 54 and a maximum of 65
Mya for the base of Paenungulata [67]; (ii) a minimum of
50 and a maximum of 63 Mya for the split between feliform and caniform Carnivora [45,68]; (iii) a minimum of
54 and a maximum of 58 Mya for the split between hippomorph and ceratomorph Perissodactyla [69]; (iv) a
minimum of 55 and a maximum of 65 Mya for the base
of Cetartiodactyla [70]; (v) a minimum of 37 Mya for the
split between ochotonids and leporids [45]; (vi) a minimum of 60.5 and a maximum of 100.5 Mya for the divergence time between rodents and primates [71]. To assess
the reciprocal consistency of all calibration points we used
the cross-validation method described in [16]. In this
method each calibration point is removed in turn and the
remaining calibration points are used to estimate its age.
Calibration points, for which the estimated and paleontological dates are not congruent, are considered as inconsistent and are consequently removed from the analyses.

Authors' contributions
MV and WWdJ initiated the study. JG contributed to collect specimens in the field, CP obtained DNA sequences,
CP and OM assembled the data, designed and ran the calculations. CP wrote the manuscript and OM, WWdJ and
MV helped to improve it. All authors read and approved

Calibration points compatibility analysis. Posterior age estimates for all
nodes as numbered in additional file 3. The nine partitions were defined
as explained in Methods. All calibrations points were used in the first
result column whereas in the following ones calibration points were
removed in turn from the analyses in order to estimate their impact on
node ages. Standard deviations (SD) are given. a The mean percentage
difference represents the average, over all the tree nodes, of the percentage
difference between the posterior age estimate calculated with all the calibration points and the one calculated with one calibration point removed.
Bold numbers indicates the estimated age of a calibration point when its
age constraint was removed from the analyses.
