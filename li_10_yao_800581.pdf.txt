YAO is a nucleolar WD40-repeat protein critical
for embryogenesis and gametogenesis in
Arabidopsis

Abstract
Background: In flowering plants, gametogenesis generates multicellular male and female gametophytes. In the
model system Arabidopsis, the male gametophyte or pollen grain contains two sperm cells and a vegetative cell.
The female gametophyte or embryo sac contains seven cells, namely one egg, two synergids, one central cell and
three antipodal cells. Double fertilization of the central cell and egg produces respectively a triploid endosperm
and a diploid zygote that develops further into an embryo. The genetic control of the early embryo patterning,
especially the initiation of the first zygotic division and the positioning of the cell plate, is largely unknown.
Results: Here we report the characterization of a mutation, yaozhe (yao), that causes zygote arrest and
misplacement of cell plate of the zygote, leading to early embryo lethality. In addition, gametophyte development
is partially impaired. A small portion of the mutant embryo sacs are arrested at four-nucleate stage with aberrant
nuclear positioning. Furthermore, the competence of male gametophytes is also compromised. YAO encodes a
nucleolar protein with seven WD-repeats. Its homologues in human and yeast have been shown to be
components of the U3 snoRNP complex and function in 18S rRNA processing. YAO is expressed ubiquitously, with
high level of expression in tissues under active cell divisions, including embryo sacs, pollen, embryos, endosperms
and root tips.
Conclusions: Phenotypic analysis indicated that YAO is required for the correct positioning of the first zygotic
division plane and plays a critical role in gametogenesis in Arabidopsis. Since YAO is a nucleolar protein and its
counterparts in yeast and human are components of the U3 snoRNP complex, we therefore postulate that YAO is
most likely involved in rRNA processing in plants as well.

Background
The model plant Arabidopsis forms multicellular male
and female gametophytes, namely pollen grains and
embryo sacs that contain the sperm cells and egg cell
respectively. During embryo sac development, the functional megaspore, one of the four meiotic products,
undergoes three consecutive rounds of mitotic division
to produce an eight-nucleate embryo sac, which cellularizes simultaneously to form a seven-celled female
gametophyte composed of one egg, two synergids, three

antipodal cells and a diploid central cell [1-4]. The pollen grain in Arabidopsis is a tricellular structure that
contains two sperms and a large vegetative cell. The
vegetative cell germinates a pollen tube to deliver the
two sperms to the female gametophyte for double fertilization that ultimately results in the formation of an
embryo and endosperm.
Polarity and asymmetric cell division are a common
feature of many different cell types, including the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, the Drosophila oocyte and
mammalian epithelial cells [5]. In the model species
Arabidopsis, the fertilized egg or zygote undergoes a
polarized elongation process to achieve an approximately 3-fold increase in length and apical localization
of its nucleus prior to division. The first asymmetric
zygotic division yields two cell lineages, namely a

smaller apical and a larger basal cell, that adopt completely different developmental program. The apical cell
goes through two rounds of vertical divisions and a subsequent round of horizontal division to form an octant
embryo proper, but the basal cell undergoes repeatedly
transverse division to form a linear suspensor that contributes to the quiescent centre of the root tip and connects the embryo to the maternal tissue.
In past decades, significant progress has been made in
identifying genetic components controlling embryo
development. The SeedGenes Project (http://www.seedgenes.org) has collected a large number of seed mutants,
and provides phenotypic and molecular information on
the essential genes in Arabidopsis [6,7]. It sets up a
good foundation for large-scale and further analysis of
the essential genes. Our knowledge about the genetic
control of zygote development which establishes the apical and basal domain of the preglobular embryo is still
quite limited although several mutations have been
reported. In yoda (yda) mutant, the zygote fails to elongate properly and divides symmetrically resulting in
incorporation of the basal lineage into the embryo
proper. The gain-of-function mutation of YDA promotes
basal cell lineage fate. This indicates that YDA acts as a
switch between the two lineages [8]. YDA is a member
of the MAPKK kinase family, which suggests that a
MAP kinase signalling cascade is critical for the development of both apical and basal cell lineages. In gnom/
emb30 mutants, zygotes are shorter than the wild-type
and display aberrant zygotic division and also aberrant
development from the first division stage on [9]. GNOM
encodes an ARF GEF that controls endosomal trafficking and the polar secretion of auxin efflux carriers
[10,11]. EMBRYONIC FACTOR 1 (FAC1), encoding an
AMP deaminase, is essential for the zygote-to-embryo
transition. In the fac1 mutant, embryo development is
arrested at the single-celled zygote stage or the first
zygotic division stage, forming a larger apical cell compared to that of the wild-type [12]. Similarly, in rootshoot-hypocotyl-defective (rsh) mutants, the position of
the cell plate at the first division of the zygote results in
a larger apical cell relative to the wild-type [13]. RSH is
a hydroxyproline-rich cell wall glycoprotein essential for
the correct positioning of the cell plate during cytokinesis in cells of the developing embryo. In the ton/fass
mutants, occasionally the cell wall separating the apical
from the basal daughter cell was oriented obliquely,
instead of perpendicular to the axis [14]. All these findings suggest that a complicated gene regulatory network
is involved during the zygotic elongation and cell
division.
Recent studies revealed important roles of RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in development

including cell fate specification and cell cycle progression [15,16]. Proteomic analyses of human [17] and Arabidopsis [18] nucleoli revealed that there are many
proteins related to cell cycle regulation, DNA damage
repair and pre-mRNA processing present in the nucleolus. In Arabidopsis, several genes encoding nuclear spliceosome proteins were reported to play key roles in
gametogenesis and embryogenesis. LACHESIS (LIS),
GFA1/CLO/VAJ, and ATROPOS involved in mRNA
splicing, play very important roles in gametic cell specification during embryo sac development [19-22].
MAGATAMA3 (MAA3), homologous to yeast SPLICING ENDONUCLEASE1 (SEN1), is required for central cell development and pollen tube guidance [23].
SWA1 and SWA2, involved in rRNA processing and
ribosome biogenesis respectively, are required for cell
cycle progression during embryo sac development
[24,25]. DOMINO1 plays a role in ribosome biogenesis,
and its loss-of-function mutation caused arrest of
embryogenesis [26]. The recently reported AtRH36,
involved in 18S pre-rRNA processing controls the mitotic division during female gametogenesis [27] TORMOZ
(TOZ), a WD40 repeat domain-containing nucleolar
protein plays important roles in orientating the division
plane during early embryogenesis. In the toz mutant, the
first division of the zygote is normal, but the longitudinal division planes of the apical cell are generally
replaced by transverse divisions [28]. This is the first
report that a nucleolar protein is required for positioning the division plane during early embryogenesis in
Arabidopsis. It would be interesting to know whether
such nucleolar proteins also control the positioning of
the zygotic division plane.
Here, we describe a novel Arabidopsis mutant yao that
affects the positioning of the zygotic cell division plane
and gametophyte development. In yao mutant, zygote
elongation and the correct cell plate positioning during
early embryogenesis are impaired, a portion of the
mutant embryo sacs are arrested at four-nucleate stage,
furthermore, the competence of yao pollen is weaker
than the wild-type. Molecular analysis shows that YAO
encodes a conserved WD-repeat containing nucleolar
protein that is homologous to hU3-55K/Rrp9, a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
(snoRNP) in animals and yeasts. Our results indicate
that YAO plays a key role in controlling the elongation
and cell plane positioning of the zygote. It remains to be
investigated how a nucleolar protein like YAO is
involved in cell division plane of the zygote in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, this work supports the earlier findings
that RNA processing plays a critical role in embryo sac
development and gametic cell fate in plants [20-26],
although the precise mechanisms remain unknown.

Results
Genetic analysis of yao mutant

To understand the molecular mechanisms that control
gametophyte development in plants, we performed a
genetic screen for mutants with distorted Mendelian
segregation and reduced seed set in our gene/enhancer
trap lines generated by Ds insertion [29-31]. A gene-trap
line yao was isolated through this screen. Mutant plants,
heterozygous for the Ds insertion, showed reduced seed
set and displayed a kanamycin-resistant (KanR) to kanamycin-sensitive (Kan S ) ratio of 1.3:1 (Kan R /Kan S =
1156:885). Furthermore, these KanR progenies were also
defective in seed set. About 28% (n = 1637) ovules were
small, shrunken, and finally aborted in heterozygous
mutant plants. In contrast, full seed set was observed in
wild-type siliques when grown in the same conditions
(Fig. 1A and 1B). Together, the distorted Ds segregation
and reduced seed set are indicative of defects in gametophyte and/or embryo development.
To define the embryo defects, cleared ovules from the
same silique (Ds/+) were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope using differential interference contrast optics. The result showed that when the wild-type

Page 3 of 12

embryos reached the globular stage (Fig. 1C), the
mutant embryos were arrested at zygote, one- or twocelled embryo proper stage. 6.68% zygotes (n = 443)
were able to elongate but stopped developing further
(Fig. 1D and 1E). 20% zygotes divided once with either
symmetrical division plane resulting in two equally sized
cells (Fig. 1F and 1J), or asymmetrically with an enlarged
apical cell that could just enlarge but is unable to
undergo subsequent longitudinal division (Fig. 1H and
1I). In some cases, the cell division plane was not perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the zygote (Fig.
1G). And the apical cell was often ballooned with a
large nucleolus and finally degraded as ovule collapsed
(Fig. 1F, I, J and 1K). In a few cases (1.57%), the apical
cells were able to divide not vertically but transversely,
and the basal cell often went through one or two transverse cell divisions (Fig. 1K and 1L). In addition, it is
common that the arrest embryonic cells contain a rather
large nucleolus (Fig. 1E to 1L). Together, these observations showed that the mutation causes zygote arrest and
disrupts the positioning of the zygotic division plane,
suggesting that the gene disrupted by the Ds insertion
plays an essential role in zygotic development.

To further investigate whether the mutation also
affects male or female gametophyte function since the
segregation of KanR/KanS deviated from the expected
2:1 ratio, the transmission efficiency of the mutation
was determined by reciprocal crosses between the wildtype and the heterozygous mutant (Ds/+) plants. When
the wild-type plant was used as pollen donor to pollinate mutant pistils (Ds/+), the F1 progeny displayed a
KanR/KanS segregation ratio of 0.8:1 (361:450, n = 811,
c2 = 4.6, p < 0.05), significantly deviating from the 1:1
ratio. This indicates that the mutation transmits through
the female with a reduced transmission efficiency of
80%. When mutant plant was used as pollen donor to
pollinate wild-type pistils, the KanR/KanS ratio is 0.58:1
(123:211, n = 334, c2 = 11, p < 0.05), with a significantly
reduced transmission efficiency of 58% through the
male. The above transmission efficiency through male
and female predicted a 1.85:1 ratio of Kan R :Kan S in
selfed progenies, which deviated significantly with the
actual 1.3:1 ratio, suggesting that the mutation not only
affects gametophytes but also caused embryo lethality.
Consistently, mutant plants homozygous for the Ds
insertion were never recovered, which suggests that the
mutation caused embryo lethality.
To investigate the female gametophyte (FG) phenotype, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was
used to compare embryo sac development in wild-type
and the mutant as described previously [24,32]. In the
wild-type, FG4 embryo sac contains 4 nuclei (Fig. 2A)
and FG5 embryo sac contains two unfused polar nuclei
(Fig. 2B). Flowers from both wild-type and mutant were
emasculated at flower stage 12c [33], then the pistils
were processed for CLSM analysis after 24 hr. At this
time point, embryo sacs reached the seven-celled FG5
stage in the wild-type (Fig. 2B). In heterozygous mutant
pistils, about 5% ovules (n = 251) were arrested at the
four-nucleate FG4 stage (Fig. 2C and 2D), and 1% were
at the two-nucleate FG3 stage. And the majority of the
embryo sacs reached the FG5 stage, similar to that of
the wild-type. The mutant embryo sacs often contain
nuclei that are larger than that of the wild-type at the
same stage (Fig. 2E), a phenomenon called nucleolar
hypertrophy. Among the mutant embryo sacs arrested
at FG4 stage, 80% showed an aberrant nuclear position
at the micropylar pole (Fig. 2D) compared to the wildtype (Fig. 2A). These data showed that the majority of
the mutant ovules developed normally, only a small
fraction display arrested progression of the mitotic cycle.
To confirm whether the defect of the mutant embryo
sacs is caused by developmental arrest or delay, a
delayed fertilization experiment was performed. We pollinated the yao mutant pistils 72 hr after emasculation
with wild-type pollens, and the Kan R /KanS rose from
0.8 to 0.89 (n = 231, c2 = 0.138, p > 0.05), which is not

statistically significant. So the mutant embryo sacs were
developmentally arrested. To further investigate if the
mutant embryo sacs could be fertilized, mutant pistils
(Ds/+) as egg donor were pollinated with wild-type pollen grains, and checked for embryo development. As a
result, 94.4% (n = 500) ovules contained a zygote, and
this was consistent with the observed 6% embryo sac
arrest in the mutant. These data indicate that the mutation does have an impact on ovule development, but not
severe.
Genetic analysis indicated that the mutation reduced
pollen transmission significantly, however, no visible
defects on the pollen development and pollen germination were observed, suggesting that the reduced

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/169

transmission via male gametophytes was likely caused by
a defect in pollen competence. To investigate this, we
performed sparse pollination experiment where ovules
were in excess. A small amount of mutant (Ds/+) pollen
grains (< 30) were pollinated on wild-type pistils, and
the F 1 progenies were counted for Kan R /Kan S ratio.
Indeed, the KanR/KanS ratio rose from 0.58:1 to 0.85:1
(n = 1661, c2 = 8.9, p < 0.05), indicating that more yao
pollen can fertilize the ovule successfully when there is
no competition of the wild type pollen. This suggests
that YAO plays a role in pollen competence.
Together, these analyses indicate that the mutation
caused a partial arrest of embryo sac development and
reduced the competence of pollen. More importantly,
the mutation impaired cell elongation and the positioning of the division plane of the zygote, which led to
early embryo arrest.
The mutant phenotype is caused by the Ds insertion in
YAO gene

The genomic sequences flanking the Ds insertion was
amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR and
sequenced [34,35]. Analysis of the flanking sequences
revealed that the Ds element was inserted into the
fourth exon, 1395 bp downstream of the ATG initiation
codon of At4G05410 gene, a gene of unknown function.
The insertion resulted in 8 bp nucleotide duplication,
typical for Ds insertion, at the insertion site (Fig. 3A).
To further determine whether the fertility phenotype
that we observed is indeed the result of the Ds insertion
within At4G05410, genetic complementation was performed. A 4600 bp genomic DNA fragment of
At4G05410, including a 982 bp promoter region, 2293
bp coding region (including exons and introns) and
1325 bp 3’-UTR region, was amplified by PCR and
cloned into pCAMBIA1301. The 1325 bp 3’-UTR region
includes the minimal 3’-UTR region plus partial
sequence of intron region next to the 3’-UTR of the
next gene At4G05400. This construct was introduced
into plants heterozygous for the Ds insertion by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral dip method.
After transformation, 33 independent transgenic T 1
plants were obtained by double selection on Murashige
and Skoog (MS) medium plates containing hygromycin
and kanamycin. Among them, 30 transformants displayed obvious restoration of seed set, and five lines
were then randomly chosen for a more detailed statistical analysis. Analysis showed that the ratio of normal to
aborted seeds in T1 plants is close to 15:1 (n = 1197, c2
= 0.46, p > 0.49). In T2 generation, the KanR/KanS segregation ratio reached about 2.5:1, a significant increase
compared to the 1.3:1 ratio in self-pollinated mutant
plants. From four T1 transgenic lines, T2 plants homozygous for the Ds insertion, were recovered, indicating a

full complementation of the transmission defect. Taken
together, these data demonstrated that the genomic
fragment fully complemented the mutation.
YAO encodes a polypeptide of 504 amino acids with
an estimated molecular mass of 56.52 kDa, with seven
WD-repeats and two nuclear localization signals (NLS)
(Fig. 3B). A BLASTP search using the predicted YAO
amino acid sequence showed that there are homologous
sequences in other eukaryotic organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Xenopus laevis, Mus
musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, C. elegans and Homo sapiens. Notably,
YAO shares 63% identity and 75% similarity with
EMB2271 (EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2271, At4G21130) of
Arabidopsis, 52% identity and 71% similarity with
Os03G0625900 of rice, 37% identity and 56% similarity
with Rrp9 of yeast, and 36% identity and 56% similarity
with hU3-55K of human. Interestingly, a single copy of
YAO gene is present in other organisms, unlike that in
Arabidopsis where a twin homologue exists [36]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YAO is more close to
EMB2271 than others including the rice homologue
(Fig. 3C and 3D), suggesting that they may be functionally conserved.
Both yeast Rrp9 and human hU3-55K had been studied extensively and were shown to be localized in
nucleolus and play an essential role in 18S rRNA
maturation. Rrp9/hU3-55K protein is a component of
the U3 snoRNP complex that controls the early cleavages of the pre-rRNA transcripts at A 0 , A 1 , and A 2
sites [37]. The WD-40 repeat domain of Rrp9/hU3-55K
is involved in physical association with Snu13/15.5k and
the snoRNA box B/C motif, and the complex formed is
crucial for cell growth [37-39]. Rrp9/hU3-55K is an
essential protein for cell viability, so is YAO in Arabidopsis. These suggest that YAO may play a similar role
in rRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis.
YAO is a nucleolar protein

YAO is predicted to contain two N-terminal nuclear
localization signals. To define its precise subcellular
localization, a C-terminal translational fusion of YAO
with GFP driven by the YAO native promoter was
cloned into pCAMBIA1301. The pYAO::YAO-GFP construct was subsequently transformed into both wild-type
and mutant plants. The seed set was increased significantly in T 1 mutant plants transformed with pYAO::
YAO-GFP and the construct completely complemented
the mutant phenotype, indicating that the YAO-GFP
fusion protein is functional in planta. Then, confocal
laser scanning microscopy was performed on the wildtype plants expressing the pYAO::YAO-GFP fusion gene.
YAO-GFP fluorescence was detected in the nucleus of
pYAO::YAO-GFP transformed root cells and co-localized

with a nucleolar marker SWA2-DsRed (Fig. 4A-D) [25].
Consistent with the mutant phenotype, strong GFP signal was detected in megaspore mother cell, female
gametophytic cells, embryo and endosperm (Fig. 4E-H).
YAO-GFP can also be detected in the integument with
a relatively low level. These indicate that YAO is indeed
a nucleolar protein which is consistent with its putative
role in pre-rRNA processing.
The YAO gene is preferentially expressed in tissues
active in cell division

To investigate YAO cellular expression pattern, we used
a pYAO::GUS-3U to monitor expression in plant tissues.
A 982 bp fragment upstream from ATG start codon
plus 30 bp of the first exon of YAO was used to drive
the GUS reporter gene. In addition, the 1331 bp 3’-UTR

fragment immediately downstream of the stop codon
was also cloned behind the GUS coding sequence. Eight
independent transgenic lines were analyzed. In all cases,
high level of GUS activity was detected in tissues that
are active in cell division, including shoot apexes, root
tips and lateral root primordia, embryos and endosperm,
pollen grains, embryo sacs (Fig. 5A-F). GUS signal in
the integument is very low, which can only be detected
under dark field microscopy (not shown). This is consistent with the YAO-GFP data which show YAO expression in the integuments. GUS activity is dynamic during
embryogenesis, strong in early embryos, and very weak
in globular embryos and thereafter hardly detectable.
Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization with specific
probe of YAO gene showed that YAO is expressed in
early embryo and endosperm (Fig. 5G-I). The

microarray data available at the GENEVESTIGATOR
(http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) also confirmed the
expression profile revealed by the RNA in situ hybridization and promoter-GUS assay.
In summary, YAO is expressed preferentially in both
gametophytes and early embryos and endosperms during embryogenesis. This expression pattern is in agreement with its essential role during embryogenesis. In
addition, its high expression in tissues active in cell division suggests that YAO plays an important role in
actively dividing cells during vegetative development.

Discussion
YAO is critical for gametogenesis and early embryo
development

Genetic studies indicated that YAO plays an important
role for gametophyte development and is critical for the
division of zygote and the apical cell. Both male and
female gametophytes are partially affected by the yao
mutation. During early embryogenesis, the first division
of zygote and the apical cell lineage were impaired in
the mutant. This clearly indicates a critical role of YAO

function in zygotic development and the patterning of
the apical cell lineage, although the precise mechanism
remains to be revealed. A limited number of genes controlling zygotic division, especially the decision of cell
plate position are reported. In this aspect, yao is a novel
mutation that acts in early embryogenesis. The pleiotropic and partial developmental arrests of ovules and
embryos suggest that YAO may function at multiple
stages during plant reproduction. In yao/+ selfed progenies, 28% ovules were defective which include developmental arrests of embryo sac, zygote and the apical cell
lineage. Furthermore, the mutation did not affect pollen
development and pollen germination in vitro; rather it
impaired the competence of the male gametophyte. The
weak competence of yao pollen might be caused by
slow pollen tube growth.
The high level of sequence homolgy between YAO
and EMB2271 proteins suggests that they may be functionally homologues. However, loss of function of
EMB2271 displayed a late embryo-defective phenotype
(SeedGenes database: http://www.seedgenes.org/). This
could be simply caused by a difference in their temporal

expression pattern. Indeed, EMB2271 is expressed only
after globular stage, no expression could be detected
before globular stage when YAO is expressed (Additional file 1). Their complementary expression pattern
support the idea that YAO could function during early
embryogenesis and EMB2271 during late embryogenesis.
In yao mutant embryo sac and embryos, the nucleolus
is often larger than that in the wild-type, indicating they
may be defective in nucleolar structure. Nucleolar
hypertrophy has been reported in Arabidopsis
[26,40-42], and linked to defect in ribosome biogenesis.

Inactivation of nucleolus protein AtLA1 causes block of
embryogenesis at the globular stage with hypertrophic
cells [40]. Nucleolar machineries organize differently
when ribosome biogenesis is inhibited [43,44]. Therefore, the nucleolar hypertrophy in yao embryo sac,
zygote and preglobular embryos may imply a defect in
ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, Lee and colleagues
reported a subset of WD-repeat containing proteins
including YAO, in which, they confirmed 11 that interact with DDB1 and serve as substrate receptor of CUL4DDB1 machinery [45]. It would be interesting to

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/169

investigate whether YAO is also degraded by the CUL4DDB1 machinery; nevertheless, we did not detect direct
interaction between WD-repeat domain, full length
YAO and DDB1 (DDB1a and DDB1b) by yeast twohybrid assay. So YAO may not be component of CUL4DDB1 complex.
YAO is a nucleolar protein and likely involved in
18S pre-rRNA processing

Rrp9/hU3-55K is a non-ribosome nucleolar protein that
is present in 90S pre-ribosome essential for 18S rRNA
maturation and 40S subunit biogenesis [46]. The U3
snoRNP is composed of a small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) and other non-ribosome proteins. Binding of
Rrp9/hU3-55K to the U3 snoRNA B/C box is essential
for pre-rRNA processing and cell growth [47]. The WDrepeat domain of the hU3-55K protein is required for
its association with the U3 snoRNA and 15.5K protein
[48]. In Arabidopsis, YAO and EMB2271 are the two
proteins that are most homologous to hU3-55K and
Rrp9, and YAO is more similar to hU3-55K in amino
acid sequence. Its protein domain structure, nucleolar
localization, and homology to hU3-55K and Rrp9,
together make it likely that YAO is also a putative U3
snoRNP component involved in 18S pre-rRNA
processing.
To investigate the interaction between YAO and 15.5
K counterpart in Arabidopsis (At5G20160 and
At4G22380) using the yeast two-hybrid assay, no interaction between them was detected (data not shown).
Their physical interaction may need the U3 snoRNA or
a tethering factor as shown in human cells [38,39]. A
pull-down assay to check the physical interplay of YAO,
15.5 K counterpart and the U3 snoRNA in Arabidopsis
may help to elucidate the conserved function of YAO.
In addition, TOZ and SWA1 are the putative components of the U3 snoRNP complex involved in rRNA
processing in Arabidopsis. They are required for embryo
sac development [24] and the correct positioning of the
division plane during early embryogenesis [28], respectively. Although there is no direct physical interaction
between YAO, TOZ and SWA1 in the yeast two-hybrid
assay (data not shown), it is still possible that they share
the same core components of the U3 snoRNP complex.
In this respect, a proteomic approach would be useful
to identify the U3 snoRNP components as done in yeast
cells.
Nucleolus and reproductive development

Embryo sac development and embryogenesis in plants
require coordinated, rapid cell growth and proliferation,
therefore active transcription and translation would be
required to sustain rapid cell growth. In this respect,
ribosome biogenesis, a key function of the nucleolus, is

Page 9 of 12

vital to these processes. It may be not surprising those
mutations in genes that are involved in mRNA and prerRNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, cause developmental arrest of embryo sacs and embryos. These
include LIS, GFA1/CLO/VAJ, ATROPOS, and MAA3 in
mRNA splicing [19-22], SWA1 and AtRH36 in prerRNA processing [24,27], SWA2 and DOMINO1 in ribosome biogenesis [25,26]. TOZ, encoding a WD40 repeat
domain-containing nucleolar protein plays important
roles in orientating the division plane during early
embryogenesis [28]. Whether TOZ is also involved in
RNA processing or ribosome biogenesis is not known.
Here we show that YAO also encodes a nucleolar protein with seven WD40-repeats and likely involved in
rRNA processing as well. Loss of YAO function also
impairs the correct positioning of the cell division plane
in zygote and preglobular embryos. Are these just coincidences? Or they reflect a key role of the nucleolus in
cell growth and proliferation during reproductive development. Embryo sac development is a unique process in
which nuclear divisions are not immediately followed by
cytokinesis, instead cytokinesis takes place simultaneously only after the completion of three rounds of
nuclear division. In addition, the cytoplasm of the
embryo sac is more or less separated to two poles by a
large central vacuole and is a polar structure. These features may allow the embryo sac to use the nucleolus, i.e.
ribosome biogenesis, as a central controller for its rapid
growth and proliferation.
Another scenario may be that there is a regulatory
role of the nucleolus other than a site of ribosome biogenesis as conventionally thought. There are reports
that suggest nucleolar proteins play direct roles during
cell cycle. CDC14 is trapped to the nucleolus by Net1
during G1 phase of the cell cycle, and is released and
becomes active when cells enter into mitosis, leaving the
Net1 stays in the nucleolus [49,50]. Here, the nucleolus
acts as a sequestering compartment for regulatory complexes. The U3 complex-associated proteins shuttle
between the nucleus and cytoplasm provide them an
opportunity for their regulation and their interaction
with other regulatory proteins [51]. YAO-GFP fusion
protein is unevenly distributed in nucleolus, which is a
new discovery and may be clue to explore the molecular
and cellular function of YAO. Although a previous high
through-put study on Arabidopsis nucleolus proteins
showed that YAO is localized in nucleolus and small
nuclear bodies reminiscent of Cajal bodies and speckles
in Arabidopsis cultured cells [18]. But we never
observed the Cajal bodies or speckle-like localization of
YAO. In this report, the use of native promoter, fusion
construct and functional assay make the YAO-GFP localization more precise and closer to the native condition.
Further studies on the specific distribution of YAO in

Li et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/169

the nucleolus and the dynamic localization during cell
division may help to elucidate the function of nucleolus
in plant cell division.

Conclusions
In conclusion, YAO is a nucleolar protein with seven
WD40-repeats that plays a role in embryo sac development and is critical for the correct positioning of the
division plane of zygote and the apical cell lineage in
Arabidopsis. It is likely that YAO acts by modulating
nucleolar function, such as rRNA biogenesis during
gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. Further dissection of YAO function and the identification of its interacting proteins would shed light on how YAO regulates
cell divisions during early embryogenesis in plants.

For pYAO::GUS-3U construction, a 1331 bp fragment
from the stop codon TAA downstream is amplified with
primers YAO-3’UTR-F (5’-ATCGGAGCTCGCATAAGTATTTCATTGGG-3’) and YAO-3’UTR-R (5’-ACTGGAGCTCCCGGCGAATCGAGGTATGG-3’),
and
cloned into pBI101 to yield pBI101-3U. Then, a fragment including 1012 bp (-982 bp to +30 bp) was amplified and cloned into pBI101-3U to yield the pYAO::
GUS-3U construct.
Bioinformatic analysis

We used NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to analyze the cDNA and genomic sequence DNA and DNAMAN and MEGA2 software to perform the
phylogenetic analysis.

Methods

Microscopy

Plant material

To determine the embryo phenotype, siliques from
YAO/+ plants were dissected with hypodermic needles
and cleared in Herr’s solution containing lactic acid:
chloral hydrate:phenol:clove oil:xylene (2:2:2:2:1, w/w)
[53]. Embryo development was studied microscopically
with a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics.
GFP and DsRed [25] images are captured with a LSM510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss,
Yena, Germany). The GFP and DsRed were excited
using the 488 nm and 543 nm laser respectively.
For GUS staining assay, samples were stained in 100
mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X100, and 1 mg/mL X-Gluc, 2 mM potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide. The samples were
vacuum-infiltrated in X-Gluc solution for 10 min and
kept at 37°C for 4 hours, then cleared in 30% lactic acid
and 20% glycerol, and finally observed with a Zeiss
Axioskop II microscope.

Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta
were sterilized with 20% (v/v) bleach for 5-10 min, then
washed five times in sterilized water and germinated on
MS agar plates. For antibiotic selection, 50 mg/L kanamycin and/or 20 mg/L hygromycin were supplemented
as required. Plants were grown in growth room at 22 ±
2 under a 16-hr-light/8-hr-dark cycle. Arabidopsis transformation was performed via floral dip method [52].
Molecular analysis

The Ds flanking sequences were isolated by thermal
asymmetric interlaced PCR as described previously
[34,35]. To conduct the complementation experiment, A
4600 bp genomic DNA fragment encompassing from 982
bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon to 1325 bp
downstream of the TAA stop codon of At4G05410 was
amplified by KOD-plus polymerase (TOYOBO) using
primers YAO-F (5’-TCAGCTGCAGACAAATAGAGGTAGGGGGAGAGTT-3’), and YAO-R (5’-GACACTGCAGCCGGCGAATCGAGGTATGG-3’), and cloned
into pCAMBIA1301 (http://www.cambia.org.au).
For pYAO::YAO-GFP fusion construct, a 763 bp EGFP
coding sequence was obtained from pEGFP (Clontech)
by KpnI and XbaI digestion, and subsequently cloned
into pCAMBIA1301 to yield p1301-GFP construct. A
1325 bp fragment downstream the stop codon was first
amplified by PCR with primers YAO-3’UTR-F (5’ATCGTCTAGAGCATAAGTATTTCATTGGG-3’) and
YAO-3’UTR-R (5’-ACTGTCTAGACCGGCGAATCGAGGTATGG-3’), and subcloned into p1300-GFP to
obtain p1301-GFP-3’U construct. A 3275 bp fragment
containing a 982 bp promoter and the coding region
with the TAA stop codon deletion was cloned to p1301GFP-3’U, to give rise to the pYAO::YAO-GFP construct.

RNA in situ hybridization

For RNA labelling, YAO cDNA fragment was amplified using primer YAO-insitu-F (5’-GATGCGGAAGAGAACGGATTTA-3’) in combination with YAOinsitu-R (5’-CACTTGGCCATATGTATTTGTCAG-3’)
and cloned into PGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) to
produce pGEM-T Easy-YAO. It is linearized by NcoI
digestion for antisense RNA probes and by SalI digestion for sense RNA probes. Antisense and sense
probes were transcribed in vitro with SP6 and T7
RNA polymerase, respectively, and labelled using the
digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche). Prehybridization, hybridization, washing, antibody staining, and
signal detection were performed as described previously[24].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Comparison of YAO and EMB2271 expression in
Arabidopsis revealed by RT-PCR analysis. RNAs were extracted from
pistils before (P1) and 24 hr after pollination (P2), and siliques in which
the embryo is at globular (G), late globular (LG) or cotyledon (C1, C2)
stages, leaf (Lf) and inflorescences (In). RNAs were reverse-transcribed
and amplified by PCR with primer combinations YAO-F (5’CAGCTTCTTCCGTCGCCACTAAAC-3’)/YAO-R (5’CTCCCATCTTCATCTCCGCCAG-3’) and EMB2271-F (5’GAAGTTTTGAAGTCTCAC-3’)/EMB2271-R (5’-CGATAGATCAACCGAGTAG-3’),
respectively. Note: YAO is expressed in pistils before and shortly after
fertilization, but not in siliques at globular and cotyledon embryo stages,
while EMB2271 is only weakly expressed in siliques at globular and early
cotyledon embryo stages. eIF4A was used as an internal control. Genomic
DNA (Ck) was used as control to verify primer combination and PCR
amplification.
