Abstract
Background: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) constitute an important component in the heat shock
response of all living systems. Among the various plant Hsps (i.e. Hsp100, Hsp90, Hsp70 and
Hsp20), Hsp20 or small Hsps (sHsps) are expressed in maximal amounts under high temperature
stress. The characteristic feature of the sHsps is the presence of α-crystallin domain (ACD) at the
C-terminus. sHsps cooperate with Hsp100/Hsp70 and co-chaperones in ATP-dependent manner
in preventing aggregation of cellular proteins and in their subsequent refolding. Database search
was performed to investigate the sHsp gene family across rice genome sequence followed by
comprehensive expression analysis of these genes.
Results: We identified 40 α-crystallin domain containing genes in rice. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that 23 out of these 40 genes constitute sHsps. The additional 17 genes containing ACD
clustered with Acd proteins of Arabidopsis. Detailed scrutiny of 23 sHsp sequences enabled us to
categorize these proteins in a revised scheme of classification constituting of 16 cytoplasmic/
nuclear, 2 ER, 3 mitochondrial, 1 plastid and 1 peroxisomal genes. In the new classification
proposed herein nucleo-cytoplasmic class of sHsps with 9 subfamilies is more complex in rice than
in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, 17 of 23 rice sHsp genes were noted to be intronless. Expression analysis
based on microarray and RT-PCR showed that 19 sHsp genes were upregulated by high
temperature stress. Besides heat stress, expression of sHsp genes was up or downregulated by
other abiotic and biotic stresses. In addition to stress regulation, various sHsp genes were
differentially upregulated at different developmental stages of the rice plant. Majority of sHsp genes
were expressed in seed.
Conclusion: We identified twenty three sHsp genes and seventeen Acd genes in rice. Three
nucleocytoplasmic sHsp genes were found only in monocots. Analysis of expression profiling of
sHsp genes revealed that these genes are differentially expressed under stress and at different
stages in the life cycle of rice plant.

Background
Plants are challenged by fluctuations in environmental
factors specially temperature on almost daily basis. High

temperature (HT) exerts negative effect on growth and
yield of plants [1]. Heat shock response (HSR), defined as
sum total of cellular high temperature-related defense

activities, is induced upon exposure to HT. Induction of
an array of ubiquitous and evolutionary-conserved proteins known as heat shock proteins (Hsps) is one of the
main constituents of the HSR [2]. Hsps are divided into
high molecular mass proteins comprising of Hsp100,
Hsp90, Hsp70/DnaK, Hsp60/GroE and small molecular
mass proteins consisting of Hsp20 or small heat shock
proteins (sHsps) of 16–42 kDa. sHsps form large oligomeric complexes, ranging in size from 200–800 kDa both
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The characteristic feature of the sHsps is the presence of an evolutionarily-conserved sequence of 80–100 long amino acids called αcrystallin domain (ACD), located in the C-terminal
region. The N-terminal region preceding the ACD is variable in length and amino acid sequence and contributes
to a large extent towards the structural diversity amongst
different sHsps. Hsps generally function as molecular
chaperones that facilitate the native folding of proteins in
unstressed and stressed conditions and play an important
role during stress by preventing irreversible aggregation of
denatured proteins. sHsps are shown to be ATP-independent molecular chaperones. Experiments have shown that
sHsps form complexes with denatured proteins and prevent their aggregation. From these complexes, the target
proteins are subsequently refolded by Hsp100/Hsp70 and
co-chaperones in ATP-dependent manner during the
recovery phase [3-5]. Expression of Hsps is controlled by
heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) that bind to cisacting regulatory elements called heat shock element
(HSEs) in the promoter region of the Hsp genes.
In plants, sHsps are encoded by nuclear multigene families and localized in different cellular compartments.
Extensive analysis of Arabidopsis sHsp gene family revealed
that there are 19 genes coding for sHsps and 25 genes
encoding for Acd proteins [6]. In Arabidopsis, 13 sHsp
genes were categorized into CI, CII and CIII present in
cytosol/nucleus, while one each present in chloroplast,
endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion and peroxisome
and 5 sHsp genes were categorized as cytoplasm- related
or plastid- related [6,7]. Recently, two groups placed these
5 sHsps into new nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial
subfamilies that has led to the expansion of nucleocytoplasmic subfamily to 7 subfamilies (I, II, III, IV, V, VI and
VII) and mitochondrial subfamily to two subfamilies MI
and MII [8,9]. The sHsps gene family is not very complex
in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. E. coli and S. cerevisiae
have 2 sHsp each. In human, 10 sHsps have been reported
while zebra-fish has 13 sHsps [10]. The possible genes in
sHsp family in sugarcane are estimated to be 24 [11].
Higher diversification of plant sHsps may reflect an adaptation to stress conditions that is unique to plants; necessitated because plants being sessile can not escape stress
environment and hence may have evolved extended
mechanisms to overcome stress. Detailed studies have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/393

established that plant sHsps are produced in response to
a wide array of environmental insults e.g. heat, cold,
drought, high light, UV, osmotic stress, oxidative stress
and plant- pathogen interaction [12,13] and their concentration can go up to 1% of the total proteins under heat
stress [14]. Some sHsps are highly-expressed in embryogenic tissues and growing fruits [15,16]. Chloroplastic
and mitochondrial sHsps are considered to play an
important role in heat tolerance [17,18].
Rice is considered a model plant species of the group
monocots for its small genome size and availability of
large collection of full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) and for
the fact that its whole genome is completely sequenced
[19]. It is the major food crop being the staple food of
about half of the world's population. Spikelet fertility,
grain quality and yield processes in rice are challenged by
HT [20]. It is anticipated that rise in climate temperature
due to global warming would lead to decrease in rice yield
even in temperate regions [21]. The grain yield of rice is
reported to drop by 10% for every 1°C increase in growing period minimum temperature in the dry season [22].
This indicates that decreased rice yields are associated
with increased night time temperature which probably is
a result of global warming [22]. To overcome the HTinduced reduction in crop yield, breeding for HT-tolerant
crops is crucial [1]. While attempts have been made to
understand structural and functional aspects of rice
Hsp90 and Hsp100 families [23-27], no major study has
been undertaken to delineate the composition and
expression analysis of rice sHsp gene family. In rice, CI
subfamily, Hsp18.0 of CII subfamily and Hsp26.7-P have
been somewhat characterized previously [28-30]. Overexpression of rice Hsp16.9-CI was shown to provide
thermo-tolerance to E. coli cells [31]. By transgenic
approach it was shown that homologous expression of
Hsp17.7-CI provided heat tolerance, drought tolerance
and UV-B resistance [32,33]. To better understand the
potential functional relevance of the sHsps in rice, it is
important to understand their genomic complexity,
expression profiling and tissue distribution.
In this study, genome-wide analysis of rice α-crystallin
domain containing genes and their comprehensive
expression analysis was performed. To study the expression, analysis of EST database, FL-cDNA and publiclyavailable microarray data sets for vegetative stages, development and stress treatments was performed. For examining HT stress response of these genes, microarray of rice
leaf tissues was carried out. The microarray based expression was supported by RT-PCR analysis of 20 genes. Our
results show the complexity and diversity of sHsp gene
family of rice at structural and expression level. This is the
first report focusing on the comprehensive expression
profiles of the ACD containing genes in rice.

Results
Complexity and organellar localization of rice sHsp gene
family
Survey of rice genome at TIGR by keywords alpha crystallin protein, small heat shock protein and heat shock protein was performed to predict genes containing conserved
ACD region. Sequences obtained by keyword search were
used as query for BLAST in NCBI database and the output
sequences were screened for the presence of ACD in
PROSITE. After removing overlapping sequences, 40
sequences containing ACD in rice genome were retrieved.
Details of all the genes encoded by these sequences are
presented in Table 1. Phylogenetic tree constructed using
these 40 sequences and various sHsps and Acd proteins of
Arabidopsis revealed that 23 rice genes grouped with sHsps
and 17 genes with regions sharing homology to ACD,
diverged from sHsps and grouped with Acd proteins from
Arabidopsis (Figure 1). We however, noticed two exceptions in this clustering pattern: (1) Hsp22.3-CVI along
with recently categorized AtHsp21.7-CVI [8] was present
on the clade with Acd genes and (2) Acd19.1 of rice was
clustered with sHsps, showing their proximity to respective genes. Furthermore, 5 sHsp genes of rice (Hsp16.6CVIII, Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp18.8-CX, Hsp17.8-CXI and
Hsp21.8-ER) were not clustered with any of the sHsp
genes of Arabidopsis. A search in the EST database of other
plant species was further performed to check for
homologs of these genes. Subsequently, phylogenetic tree
generated by alignment of amino acid sequence of rice
sHsps and ESTs (Additional file 1) showed that these 5
sHsp genes grouped into distinct clusters on separate
clades with sHsps from other plant species, reflecting that
homologs of above mentioned genes were indeed present
in other plants (Figure 2). Based on the phylogenetic tree
and in silico localization analysis (Figure 2 and Additional
file 2), we identified rice sHsp members relating to previously defined subfamilies CI, CII, CIII, M, P, ER and Px as
well as recently identified subfamilies CV, CVI and MII [79]. In addition, we identified four additional nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in rice each represented by one sHsp
gene. These new subfamilies are CVIII (Hsp16.6), CIX
(Hsp17.9B), CX (Hsp18.8) and CXI (Hsp17.8) (Figure 2).
Considering that there are 7 nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in Arabidopsis we have numbered the newly identified subfamilies from VIII onwards. Homologous genes
for Hsp16.6-CVIII, Hsp17.9B-CIX and Hsp18.8-CX were
found only in monocots and Hsp17.8-CXI subfamily was
found to have homologous genes in dicots. Thus, the 23
sHsps of rice consist of 14 subfamilies distributed to various cellular organelles in the following manner: 16
nucleo-cytoplasmic (C) sHsps (9 subfamilies), 3 mitochondrial (M) sHsps (2 subfamilies), 2 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized sHsps, 1 plastidial (P) sHsp and 1
peroxisomal (Px) sHsp having 1 subfamily each. As
against our analysis, 22 genes are annotated as sHsps and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/393

8 genes as sHsp-like or ACD proteins in TIGR rice genome
annotation database. 22 sHsps genes in TIGR are further
annotated as 12 CI sHsps, 3 CII sHsps, 3 chloroplastic
sHsps and 2 each as ER and mitochondrial.
Among the 17 Acd genes in rice we identified one FLcDNA in KOME database (AK109077), whose conceptual
translation displayed that it has 2 ACDs arranged in tandem. Position of this full length clone in the genome
could not be mapped on chromosome. Two genes,
Acd52.9 and Acd50.5 were found to have ARID or bright
domain in addition to the ACD. The ARID containing
proteins from rice as well as Arabidopsis were found to be
chromatin-associated proteins http://www.chromdb.org
and are suggested to be involved in chromatin remodeling. Several Acd proteins were found to have predicted
transmembrane domain. Intracellular localization of
Acd19.1 (Os03g61940) is predicted to be ER in Predotar
and Acd38.4 (Os10g07200), Acd21 (Os10g07210) and
Acd21.5 (Os09g17660) show plastid localization. Nonetheless, these protein sequences do not show any consensus sequences which is present in ER localized proteins or
chloroplastic sHsps.
Sequence alignment of amino acids of sHsps showed that
members of different subfamilies do not share high
sequence similarity, yet the secondary structure is conserved across subfamilies. The 'GVL' residues which are
highly conserved in the consensus region I are variable in
Hsp17.9B-CIX and in Hsp22.3-CVI subfamily (Additional
file 3). The β6 strand was noted to be absent in CV sHsps
of dicots. The β10 strand which has conserved sequence
motif, basic-x-I/V-x-I/V, was absent in Hsp22.3-CVI subfamily. It is proposed that the amino acids from β10
strand facilitate inter-subunit linkage for oligomerization
of sHsps [34].
Twenty three sHsps and 16 Acd mapped genes (1 Acd gene
could not be mapped as stated above) are distributed over
all chromosomes, except on chromosome 8. Interestingly,
closely related sequences of CI subfamily that clustered
together in the phylogenetic tree are present on chromosome 1 and chromosome 3 suggesting that expansion of
this gene family may have occurred due to localized or
intra-chromosomal duplication. In addition, one sHsp
and two Acd genes showed segmental duplication: these
include genes present on duplicated chromosomal segments between chromosome 2 and 6 (Hsp24-MI and
Hsp26.2-MI), chromosome 3 and 10 (Acd22.6 and Acd18)
and chromosome 1 and 5 (Acd29.4 and Acd34.9). Alignment of available FL-cDNA and ESTs sequences with
respective genomic DNA revealed that 6 sHsp genes are
interrupted by one intron each and 17 sHsp genes have no
intron. On the contrary, the Acd genes were interrupted by
either single or multiple introns (Table 1). The diagram-

Diagramatic illustration of sHsp subfamilies of rice.
The conserved α- crystallin domain of sHsps is shown in
pink. The transit peptide (TP) of the organellar sHsps, the
NLS of CII and CIII sHsp, the methionine rich region (Metbristle) of plastidial sHsp and peroxisomal targeting signal
(PTS1; SKL) are marked. The position of the introns is indicated with black arrowhead. Description of sHsp subfamilies
is given in the text. Intron- exon structure of subfamilies
CVIII, CIX, CX and CXI is similar to CI subfamily.

matic representation of sHsp subfamilies showing ACD,
intron position and transit peptide is illustrated in
Figure 3.
Expression analysis of rice sHsp and Acd genes
The levels of expression of sHsp and Acd genes of rice were
investigated by two approaches. The first approach was
based on scrutiny of digital expression profile of ESTs
(TIGR, gene expression evidence), FL-cDNA (KOME database) and microarray data available at Genevestigator
[35]http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch. The latter source
facilitated the analysis of the whole genome microarray
based expression data for vegetative stage, developmental
stages as well as various environmental stresses excluding
heat stress. In the second approach, heat stress induced
expression analysis of sHsps and Acds genes was performed by analyzing whole genome microarray data of
leaf tissues of rice (Sarkar et al, unpublished data,).
Expression of sHsps was further analyzed by RT-PCR analysis.

The digital expression profiles derived from the abundance of ESTs in diverse libraries (nine non-stresses and
one UV-C stress library) for sHsps and Acds showed that all
sHsp genes except Hsp23.6-MII were expressed in various
libraries (Figure 4). Highest level of ESTs were observed in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/393

UV-C stress library for CI sHsps and a distinct induction
in the ESTs was noticed for CII, CIII, MI, P and Px sHsps
(Figure 4). ESTs for newly identified subfamilies
Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp18.8-CX, Hsp17.8-CXI, Hsp18.8-CV and
Hsp22.3-CVI were absent in UV-C stress library. Expression of most of the sHsp genes (except Hsp19.0-CII,
Hsp18.8-CX, Hsp23.5-MII and Hsp18.8-CV) was found in
mixed-library though the EST abundance was much lower
as compared to that in stress library. Expression of
Hsp18.8-CV was noted in flower and panicle while
Hsp19.0-CII was restricted to the embryo and pistil libraries suggesting that the expression of these sHsps may be
regulated in specific tissues or at developmental stages.
Expression of alternative splice variants of six sHsp genes
was observed in EST analysis (Figure 4). However, we
noted FL-cDNA and EST support for alternative spliced
variant of Hsp18.8-CV and Hsp17.8-CXI. (Table 1). No
expression evidence was found for one sHsp gene and 5
Acd genes in EST analysis. Expression of four sHsps and
seven Acd genes was not supported by FL-cDNAs
(Table 1).
Developmental stage specific expression of sHsps
Microarray based expression analysis of developmental
stages of rice plant showed that transcripts of most of the
sHsp genes were widely expressed although their expression levels varied at different developmental stages (Figure 5). Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp18.8-CX, Hsp23.6-MII, Hsp18.8CV and Hsp22.3-CVI were expressed constitutively in both
root and shoot. The latter two genes were expressed in
shoot, leaf and culm in moderately high levels. In stigma
and ovary, transcripts of seven sHsp genes (Hsp17.7-CI,
Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp18.0-CII, Hsp18.8-CV, Hsp17.9B-CIX,
Hsp26.2-MI and Hsp23.6-MII) were present in moderate
level. In various parts of panicle, eight sHsp genes
(Hsp16.9C-CI, Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp17.7-CI,
Hsp18.0-CII, Hsp18.8-CV, Hsp26.2-MI and Hsp23.6-MII)
displayed varied expression. We further noted that transcripts of CI sHsp genes located on chromosome 3
(Hsp17.4, Hsp17.7, Hsp17.9A and Hsp18.0), Hsp26.2-MI
and Hsp19.0-CII were present in high abundance during
early stages of development of pollen and tapetum as
shown by laser micro dissection microarray data analysis
of anther development [36] (Additional File 4). In contrast, during late stages of anther development (from uninuclear microspore to tricellular pollen) significant
expression of Hsp17.9A and Hsp19.0-CII was observed.
During various stages of seed development, sHsp genes
from most of the subfamilies exhibited differential expression.
Stress induced expression of sHsps
Microarray based analysis of 7 d old seedlings of rice
under LT stress (3 h, 4°C) revealed that except for
Hsp16.9C-CI, Hsp18.0-CI and Hsp23.6-MII which are

upregulated, expression of most of the sHsp genes is unaltered (Figure 6). Salt stress (3 h, 200 mM NaCl) caused
upregulation of ten genes and down regulation of three
genes. Under dehydration stress enhanced transcript level
of eight sHsp genes and reduced transcript of six genes was
observed. Five genes (Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp17.4CI, Hsp18.6CIII, Hsp24.0-MI and Hsp16.0-Px) showing upregulation
were common in salt and drought stress. Transcript level
of most of the sHsp genes was responsive to anoxia stress.
Anoxia stress caused drastic enhancement of the transcript
level (>10 fold) of Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp18.0-CI and Hsp24.0MI whereas transcript of Hsp17.4-Cl, Hsp18.0-CII,
Hsp19.0-CII, Hsp18.6-CIII, chloroplast and ER sHsps were
moderately up-regulated [37]. However, six genes
(Hsp22.3-CVI, Hsp16.6-CVIII, Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp18.8-CX,
Hsp17.8-CXI and Hsp23.6-MII) were down-regulated in
anoxia (Figure 6). In response to sodium arsenate stress in
roots of rice, nine genes (Hsp16.9A-CI, Hsp16.9B-CI,

Hsp16.9C-CI, Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp18.0-CI, Hsp18.6-CIII,
Hsp26.7-P, Hsp26.2-MI and Hsp21.8-ER) were shown to
be up-regulated [38]. In response to biotic stress [M. grisea, 4 days post infection (dpi)], Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp18.0-CI,
Hsp16.9A-CI, Hsp18.0-CII and both MI genes were upregulated and 4 genes (Hsp22.3-CVI, Hsp16.6-CVIII, Hsp18.8CX and Hsp17.8-CXI) were down regulated.
To get insight into the expression profiling of the sHsp
gene family under heat stress, microarray data of rice leaf
tissues was analyzed. The probes for Hsp21.8-ER and
Hsp23.6-MII were absent on the 60K chip used for expression analysis. In addition, there are two probes
(Os046986_01 and Os033333_01) on the chip showing
cross-reactivity with seven CI sHsps (Hsp17.9A-CI,
Hsp18.0-CI, Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp17.7-CI, Hsp16.9A-CI,
Hsp16.9B-CI and Hsp16.9C-CI). Hence, there were no specific probes for Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp18.0-CI, Hsp16.9A-CI

and Hsp16.9B-CI. The expression of sHsp genes belonging
to various subfamilies was highly up-regulated under HT
(Figure 7). Transcript level of 10 sHsp genes showed upregulation by more than 5 fold within 10 min at 42°C.
Overall, expression of sHsps under HT followed 3 types of
kinetics: Type I where expression was initially enhanced
after 10 min at 42°C, on further exposure for 1 h decrease
in the transcript level was registered (represented by
Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp23.2-ER, Hsp18.6-CIII,
Hsp24.0-MI, Hsp26.2-MI); Type II where up-regulation
within 10 min at 42°C was further enhanced upon
increasing the stress duration to 1 h (represented by
Hsp16.6-CVIII, Hsp16.9C-CI and Hsp18.0-CII); Type III
where there was no significant change in the expression of
sHsp genes till 10 min at 42°C but the transcript level was
upregulated drastically (more than 8 folds) after 1 h at
42°C (represented by Hsp26.7-P). No change in the transcript level of Hsp16.0-Px, Hsp22.3-CVI, Hsp18.8-CV,
Hsp17.8-CXI and Hsp18.8-CX was observed. Transcripts of
all the upregulated sHsp genes were retained after 30 min
of recovery, albeit a marginal decline in the level was
observed.

Subsequent expression analysis of sHsp genes by semiquantitative RT-PCR using RNA from root and shoot validated that transcript of most of the sHsp genes were upregulated in both the tissues under HT. The transcripts of
Hsp18.8-CV and Hsp22.3-CVI were constitutively present
and their level was unaltered under heat, cold, dehydration and salt stress (Figure 8). Constitutive expression of
Hsp18.8-CV and Hsp22.3-CVI and low transcript abundance of Hsp22.3-CVI in comparison to Hsp18.8-CV is
commensurate with the expression data from published
microarrays (Figure 5). At 37°C for 30 min, significant
levels of transcript were noted for eight genes (Hsp17.4-CI,
Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp18.0-CII, Hsp18.6-CIII, Hsp23.2-ER,
Hsp24.0-MI, Hsp23.6-MII and Hsp16.0-Px) whereas marginal increase in the transcript level of 5 genes (Hsp16.9ACI, Hsp21.8-ER, Hsp17.8-CXI, Hsp26.2-MI and Hsp26.7-P)
was observed. At temperatures higher than 37°C, further
increase in the transcript level of sHsps was observed. We
noted that the expression behavior of two sHsp genes in
semi-quantitative RT-PCR is not in agreement with the
results of microarray. Hsp16.0-Px and Hsp17.8-CXI did not
show HT inducibility in microarray; however, transcript

level of these two genes was upregulated under heat stress
conditions in RT-PCR. It was further noted that expression
of Hsp24.0-MI and Hsp18.6-CIII was in cold and dehydration stress (Figure 8). In panicle, feeble signal for expression of Hsp17.9A-CI, Hsp18.6-CIII, Hsp18.8-CV and
Hsp22.3-CVI was noticed. In mature seed, expression pattern of sHsp genes was concurrent with the microarray
based expression. No expression was seen for Hsp18.8-CX,
Hsp19.0-CII and Acd38.4 under the stress condition used
for RT-PCR, though the expression of latter two genes is
supported by FL-cDNA clones (Table 1).

were found to be constitutively expressed in root and
shoot. Acd50.4, Acd58.3, Acd19.1, Acd34.9 and Acd19.4
were expressed during developmental stages of rice plant
(Additional file 5). In general, expression of Acd genes
was not affected significantly by cold, salt, dehydration
and anoxia stress except Acd21.0 which showed upregulation under anoxia stress (Figure 6). Expression of Acd
genes was either unaffected or downregulated under heat
stress (Additional file 5). However, two Acd genes,
Acd21.0 and Acd30.2 showed upregulation under HT. RTPCR analysis showed that transcripts of Acd21.0, Acd18.0
and Acd50.4 genes displayed constitutive expression and
remained unaffected under stress conditions.
In silico analysis of promoter regions of sHsp genes
Expression of Hsp genes is regulated at transcriptional
level by binding of HSFs to HSEs. The analysis of promoter region of sHsp genes (1.2 kb upstream of ATG),

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:393

using PLACE database showed that HSEs were present
only in the promoters of Hsp17.4-CI and Hsp18.0-CI
genes. Further investigation showed that this database recognizes 5'-CTnGAAnnTTCnAG-3' as HSE module. As varied combinations of palindromic repeats of nGAAn are
considered functional HSEs [39], we subsequently followed manual inspection and motif-based sequence analysis tool MEME (multiple Em for motif elicitation) for
motif search. For the latter approach we opted to select 7
motifs (instead of default setting of 3 motifs). Out of these
7 different motifs (Additional file 6), 2 relevant motifs (#4
and #7, Figure 9) showed consensus sequences similar to
known palindromic nGAAn (perfect) and its variants
(imperfect) in many sHsp genes. From these analyses, it
emerged that promoters of seven sHsp genes (Hsp18.0-CI,
Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp17.4-CI, Hsp18.0-CII, Hsp26.7-P, Hsp24.0MI and Hsp16.0-Px) contained a perfect HSE module
(nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn or nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn or both).
Promoter regions of other sHsps showed imperfect HSE
module (Figure 9 and additional file 7). Majority of the
HSEs were located proximal to the ATG. Distal HSEs were
noticed in the promoters of Hsp16.0-Px, Hsp17.7-CI and
Hsp23.6-MII. None of the promoters of Acd genes were
found to have perfect HSEs. However, nnGAAnnTTC or
nnTTCnnGAAnn was present in Acd19.1, Acd21.5 and
Acd18.0 promoters (results not shown).

Discussion
Based on genome-wide analysis of ACD containing gene
family, this study shows that rice has 23 sHsp and 17 Acd
genes. In contrast, Arabidopsis has 19 sHsps and 25 Acd
proteins [6]. In earlier attempts on categorization of Arabidopsis sHsps, it was proposed that while 5 genes do not
fall in distinct subfamilies, rest of the sHsps can be placed
into 7 subfamilies (namely CI, CII, CIII, M, P, ER and Px)
[6,7]. In a more recent attempt, Arabidopsis sHsp gene family has been extended to 12 subfamilies by placing the 5
uncategorized sHsp genes into 4 new nucleocytoplasmic
subfamilies [namely CIV (AtHsp18.5), CV (AtHsp15.4),
CVI (AtHsp21.7) and CVII (AtHsp14.7)] and by adding a
new mitochondrial subfamily MII (AtHsp26.5) [8]. The
latter study further showed that homologous genes of Arabidopsis CIV and CVII subfamily are not present in rice [8].
Waters et al [9] performed comparative analysis of sHsp
gene family of Arabidopsis, Populus and rice and suggested
that the plant sHsp gene family may be categorized into
11 subfamilies. This group indicated that 5 sHsp genes of
rice namely Os16.9C
(Os02g48140), Os17.6A
(Os01g04340),
Os18
(Os11g13980),
Os18.2
(Os02g03570) and Os21.2 (Os02g10710) are so-called
orphan genes because their homologs are not found in
Populus and Arabidopsis. Our analysis shows that gene
entry corresponding to Os02g10710 (Hsp23.6-MII in this
study) has a definite homolog in Arabidopsis (Figure 1).
We further find that Hsp17.9B-CIX (Os01g04350) gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/393

also does not have homologous counterpart in Arabidopsis. We show that homologs of rice entries corresponding
to Os01g04340 (Hsp16.6-CVIII in this study),
Os01g04350 (Hsp17.9B-CIX) and Os02g03570 (Hsp18.8CX) are actually present in monocots, homologs of
Os02g48140 (Hsp17.8-CXI) are present in dicots and
homologs of Os11g13980 (Hsp21.8-ER) are present in
both monocots and dicots. These genes in bootstrap NJ
tree analysis segregated into separate clades which are supported by significant bootstrap score of 70% and above.
Based on comprehensive analysis done in this work, we
propose that sHsp gene family of rice is constituted of 14
subfamilies. We show that there are nine nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in rice and CI subfamily is the largest with
seven members.
This study highlights that 74% of rice sHsp genes are
intronless based on genomic organization data. In rice,
overall ~20% of the genes are intronless [40]. Importantly, the length of the introns in intron harboring sHsp
genes of rice is relatively short (Table 1). Intron length is
reported to be inversely proportional to gene expression
levels in humans and worms and positively associated
with expression level in plants [41,42]. There are indications that introns pose hindrance to rapid gene regulation
and are selected against in those genes which require
quick adjustment in transcript level to overcome the environmental challenges [43]. Incidentally, sHsp genes are
one of the rapidly expressed genes as sHsp transcripts are
observed within 10 min of HT in most cases. The absence
of introns or their presence with smaller size may thus
have correlation to rapid induction needs of sHsp genes.
Further, orthologous genes generally tend to maintain the
same exon-intron structure [44]. We observed an interesting point regarding intron in plastidial sHsp genes: the
plastidial sHsp gene of Arabidopsis has one intron while
the intron is absent in plastidial sHsp gene of rice. On further examination, we note that plastidial sHsp genes in
dicots like Populus, Vitis and G. arboreum also contain one
intron. Intron was noted to be present in chloroplast sHsp
gene of monocots like maize and bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera var. palustris) but absent in rice. Wild rice O. minuta
also has intronless chloroplastic sHsp gene. This may thus
suggest that intronloss feature in chloroplastic sHsp gene
of rice may have appeared after their divergence from
common ancestor into subfamily Erhartoideae (to which
rice belongs) and Panicoideae (to which maize belongs).
From the expression analysis, it is evident that there is spatio-temporal regulation of rice sHsp genes under stress
and developmental stages. An overview of sHsp expression under stress and development is presented in Figure
10 and Figure 11. It is evident from this presentation that
the expression of sHsp genes is mainly associated with
heat stress (and other stresses) as well as under unstressed

conditions in vegetative tissues, pollens and seeds. Various nucleocytoplasmic sHsps [sHsps of CI subfamily, one
of the CII sHsp (Hsp18.0) and CIII sHsp] followed this
typical expression pattern under HT and seed development. In an earlier study, sHsps of CI were shown to be
present in dry seeds of rice [29]. In pollens, all CI sHsps
were not expressed. This observation is in agreement with
the CI sHsp expression in Arabidopsis. Hsp19.0-CII gene
was not induced by HT and its transcript was barely
detectable in seed. In Arabidopsis, both the CII members
were shown to be induced by HT. Expression profile of CV
and CVI sHsps differed from CI, CII and CIII sHsps. These
genes were expressed constitutively in root, shoot and
leaf. Moreover, expression of genes from both CV and CVI
subfamilies was not altered by HT. The homologous genes
of rice Hsp18.8-CV and Hsp22.3-CVI in Arabidopsis
(namely Hsp15.4-CV and Hsp21.7-CVI, respectively) also
are expressed constitutively in vegetative tissues [8]. While
expression of AtHsp21.7-CVI was unaffected by HT,

expression of AtHsp15.4-CV was rather downregulated.
Expression behavior of CV and CVI sHsp genes differed
during developmental stages as well. Hsp18.8-CV was
expressed in all parts of panicle and showed feeble expression in seed, and Hsp22.3-CVI was moderately expressed
in seed only. In comparison, the homologous genes of
Arabidopsis were not expressed in seed. Amongst the
monocot specific sHsps, two genes (Hsp17.9B-CIX and
Hsp18.8-CX) were constitutively expressed in root, shoot
and leaf. The constitutive expression of sHsps in vegetative organs implies that these proteins may be involved in
house keeping activity of the cells. Overall, there is a considerable variation in the expression of sHsp genes under
HT and development. Though Hsp17.9B-CIX and
Hsp16.6-CVIII were induced by HT, the extent of induction was not as high as noted for CI sHsps. Expression of
Hsp18.8-CX was not responsive to HT. In seed, moderate
to negligible expression levels of Hsp17.9B-CIX, Hsp16.6CVIII and Hsp18.8-CX were observed. The transcript of
Hsp17.8-CXI was induced to a mild extent under HT. The
expression of this gene was not noticed in any other developmental stage except in seed (albeit to low level). Multiplicity of these genes in cytoplasm may suggest functional
redundancy of cytoplasmic sHsps. However, the expres-

sion profile results may also be considered as a support to
hypothesize that these proteins perform diverse functions
under stress and development.
All the organellar sHsps were induced by HT. Hsp23.6-MII
showed constitutive expression in root, shoot and leaf.
Differential expression of organellar sHsps was evident
during various stages of anther development (Additional
file 4) and seed. In Arabidopsis, peroxisomal and mitochondrial Hsp26.5-MII was expressed in seeds and none
of the organellar sHsps were reported in any other development stage. Under stress conditions, sHsps reportedly
function as chaperones protecting cellular proteins from
denaturation and maintaining the protein homeostasis of
the cells. Functional roles of sHsps under unstressed conditions have not been extensively worked out. Recently, it
is proposed that these proteins may perform non-chaperone functions under constitutive conditions [8].
Acd proteins which seem to have diverged from sHsps
during the course of evolution (Figure 1) showed expression patterns resembling CV and CVI sHsps. Most of the
Acd genes were constitutively expressed in vegetative
organs (Additional file 5). These genes were rather downregulated under HT. In this respect, Acd genes are similar
in expression to CV sHsps of Arabidopsis. Cellular roles of
Acd proteins are not very well established. OsAcd58
(OsSLT1) and its homologs in tobacco and Arabidopsis are
shown to be constitutively expressed [45,46]. The C-terminal-truncated OsSLT1 exhibited ATP-independent
chaperone activity and also provides enhanced thermotolerance to recombinant E. coli [45]. In contrast, AtSLT1 and
NtSLT1 are implicated in Na+ homeostasis [46]. Another
Acd gene, AtAcd32.1 (which does not have homolog in
rice) shows high level of constitutive expression and possesses chaperone activity in vivo [7]. Thus, it may appear
that functionally Acds have role similar to constitutive
sHsps or could be that these proteins are involved in specialized functions.
At the molecular level, it is proposed that the interplay of
HSEs with corresponding trans-regulatory HSFs regulates
the expression of Hsp genes. It is well documented that
variations in the configuration of HSEs have a profound
role in the expression of Hsp genes in stress and development [47]. The in silico analysis carried out in this study
showed that promoters of almost all the sHsp genes harbor minimum one module of putative HSE. Various modules of HSEs have been shown to be functional in the
promoters of sHsp genes in stress and embryogenesis
[47,48]. Analysis of stress inducibility of three sHsp genes
by promoter-GUS fusion revealed that promoter of
Hsp16.9A-CI with imperfect HSE was induced 6.2 times
and the promoters of Hsp18.0-CI and Hsp17.4-CI, both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/393

having perfect HSEs were induced 14.4 and 17.1 times,
respectively [29]. However, expression of Hsp16.9A-CI
was noted to be higher in comparison to Hsp18.0-CI and
Hsp17.4-CI under similar stress conditions [29]. Experimental verification of sHsp promoters by deletion analysis may reflect the relevance of these putative HSEs in
stress and development.

Conclusion
This study makes contributions towards the genomic
complexity and expression diversity of the sHsps gene
family of rice. Through global transcript profiling by
microarray and RT-PCR analysis, we have shown that
most of the sHsps genes are highly upregulated in
response to high temperature. We also noted that several
sHsp genes are expressed constitutively in vegetative tissues and during panicle or seed development. Thus, we
show that sHsps may be involved in cellular functions
under non-stress and stress conditions as well as during
developmental processes. It remains to be appreciated
how the individual members of the sHsp gene family
which have different pattern of expression depending on
the organ, tissue and stage of development, are important
in co-ordination of the overall heat shock response.

Methods
Screening of database and sequence analyses
Rice genome annotation database at TIGR was searched
by keyword alpha crystallin protein, small heat shock protein and heat shock protein to predict genes containing
conserved ACD region. Sequences obtained by keyword
search were used as query in NCBI BLAST. Additionally
the PS01031 domain containing entries of rice were
searched at http://www.expasy.org (using taxonomic tree
view of all Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL entries matching
PS01031). This search returned 64 entries. Subsequently,
the sequences were manually analyzed to identify and
exclude duplicated annotations or sequences with conflict
with genomic sequences in GenBank at the NCBI database. All predicted proteins were examined for Hsp20
domain in Prosite http://www.expasy.org. The full length
cDNA (FL-cDNA) of all predicted genes were searched at
KOME database (knowledge-based Oryza molecular biological
encyclopedia;
http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/
cDNA/). Duplications of sHsp genes were investigated at
TIGR by using segmental genome duplications page of
rice http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/segmental_dup/.
Specific targeting sequences were predicted with the
PSORT program http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/ and localization
was predicted by Predotar http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/
predotar/predotar.html and TargetP or manual scrutiny
for peroxisomal targeting. The prediction of transmembrane domains was performed with the TMHMM 2.0 proMultiple
sequence
gram

alignments were performed using the ClustalX1.83 http:/
/www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and the bootstrap test carried out with 1000 iterations. One gene
represented by Os05g23140 sequence was not included in
this analysis as it is a retrotransposon. Molecular weight of
the retrieved proteins was calculated using EditSeq of the
DNASTAR program.
1.2 kb upstream region of sHsp genes was identified by
BLAST in NCBI database and HSEs were searched in the
PLACE http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/htdocs/PLACE/. database. Further analysis to identify conserved motifs present
in the promoter regions was performed using expectation
maximization method MEME http://meme.sdsc.edu/
meme4/intro.html[49]. The program was set to output 7
motifs with minimum and maximum motif length of 10
and 25 bp, respectively. Distribution of motif occurrences
was allowed to any number of repetitions in the given
strand only. The MEME motifs were compared with the
defined HSEs.
Two entries retrieved in BLAST analysis in NCBI have conflicting sequences with genomic sequence of Hsp18.0
(Os03g16030). These entries code for Hsp18.0 (accession- U83670, ORF- 483 bp, direct submission Guan and
Lin, 1998) and Hsp17.8 (accession- X75616, ORF- 483
bp, direct submission Lin, 1996). Both these sequences
mapped to chromosome 3 corresponding to locus
Os03g16030 which codes for Hsp18 (161 aa) in rice
genome. However, both sequences code for 160 aa sHsp
because one amino acid at position 64 is missing compared to genomic sequence. Furthermore, both sequences
have substitution of S to T at position 35 as compared to
Hsp18 (161 aa). Similarly, for plastid Hsp there are 4 full
length cDNA clones in database. AK120045, AK120048
and AK063618 have 723 bp ORF coding for of 240 aa
whereas directly submitted clone AB020973 has an
mRNA of 720 bp coding for 239 aa protein [30].
AK120048 and AK063618 perfectly match with the
genomic sequence while AK120045 has one nucleotide
mismatch and the AB020973 has 3 gaps and 3 mismatches with the genomic sequence.
Digital expression analysis of sHsps and Acd genes was performed using gene expression evidence search tool against
the rice data available at TIGR http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/
osa1/locus expression_evidence.html for different tissues in
the following libraries: UV-C irradiated shoot (Acc#19038),
mixed shoot (normalized library) (Acc#19041), supermix
(Acc#19047), panicles mixture of one, two, three weeks after
flowering (Acc#19050), root of seedlings (Acc#19053),
flower (Acc#19057), callus (Acc#19058), after pollination
embryo (Acc#19099), 40 days after pollination pistil
(Acc#19121) and seed (Acc#19082).

Growth conditions and stress treatment
Rice seeds [O. sativa L; cultivar Pusa basmati 1 (PB1)
obtained from Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New
Delhi, India] were treated with 70% alcohol for 5 min followed by rinsing 5–6 times with water. Seeds were soaked
for two days in water and then grown on 1 cm layer of cotton in a tray. 7 d old seedlings were subjected to heat stress
at various temperatures and time periods by placing them
in beakers containing equal volume of water in water bath
maintained at requisite temperatures. For cold stress,
seedlings were placed for specified time in cold room
maintained at 6 ± 2°C.
RNA isolation and microarray
For analysis of transcript levels by RT-PCR, RNA was isolated from various tissues by TRI reagent (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA from dry seeds was
isolated according to Singh et al [50]. 5 μg of total RNA
was reverse transcribed with an oligo-dT primer using
MMLV reverse transcriptase first-strand synthesis system
for RT-PCR as recommended by the manufacturer (MBI,
Fermentas) in a 50 μl reaction. For PCR, 1 μl cDNA was
taken in a reaction volume of 25 μl using gene specific
primers for 25 cycles (List of primers in Additional file 2).

For microarray analysis, RNA was isolated from rice leaves
(control at 26°C, stressed at 42°C for 10 min, 1 h and 30
min recovery after 1 h stress) by RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity of RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis
and
quality
was
checked
spectrophotometrically. Expression profiling was conducted with the 60K Rice Whole Genome Microarray
(information available at http://www.ggbio.com; GreenGene Biotech). In total, 60,727 oligomers were designed
from gene-specific regions of both japonica and indica subspecies. These include 58,417 from known and predicted
genes and 66 randomized DNA oligomers. Oligomer
sequences were extracted by Qiagen-Operon based on rice
genome information from the Beijing Genomics Institute.
Oligomers were synthesized and purified by QiagenOperon and spotted on SuperAmine slides using the facilities of Dr. David Galbraith at the University of Arizona
http://ag.arizona.edu/microarray/deconvolution.html. A
set of two slides of the 60K microarray has 64,896 spot
addresses. Each slide is formatted with 48 (12 × 4) blocks
composed of 676 (26 × 26) spots. Blank spots (4099) were
also included for easy scanning of the alignment. Each oligomer 70 nucleotides long with an average Tm of 78°C was
printed in each spot address with a diameter of 100 μm.
Non-correlation of signal and background intensities was
confirmed by plotting base 2 log background intensity in
x-axis and base 2 log intensity subtracted from background intensity on the y-axis. Before normalization, the
normal distribution and linear relations of Cy3 and Cy5

intensities were tested by qqplot and a linear regression
model, respectively, in R statistical language. The spatial
effects on the chip during the hybridization process were
checked with spatial func in the sma package. The variance differences between Cy3 and Cy5 intensities within
the microarray were tested with the Student's t-test under
the assumption of both uniform and non-uniform variances. One- and two-way analyses of variance of the signal
intensity differences between microarrays were performed. Median pixel intensities were transformed as log
ratios with base 2 and then adjusted by block-by-block
Lowess normalization for each slide [51]. To improve the
specificity of statistical hypothesis in low-intensity
regions, following empirical criteria was adopted: a spot
was selected if it was not flagged for its morphology, the
diameter was larger than 51 pixels, and the intensities of
both signals were higher than 500. Data presented are
based on three biological replicates at indicated times.
