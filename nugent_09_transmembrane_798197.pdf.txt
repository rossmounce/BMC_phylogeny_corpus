Abstract
Background: Alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins are involved in a wide range of
important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable
molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion. Many are also prime drug
targets, and it has been estimated that more than half of all drugs currently on the market target
membrane proteins. However, due to the experimental difficulties involved in obtaining high quality
crystals, this class of protein is severely under-represented in structural databases. In the absence
of structural data, sequence-based prediction methods allow TM protein topology to be
investigated.
Results: We present a support vector machine-based (SVM) TM protein topology predictor that
integrates both signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction, benchmarked with full crossvalidation on a novel data set of 131 sequences with known crystal structures. The method achieves
topology prediction accuracy of 89%, while signal peptides and re-entrant helices are predicted
with 93% and 44% accuracy respectively. An additional SVM trained to discriminate between
globular and TM proteins detected zero false positives, with a low false negative rate of 0.4%. We
present the results of applying these tools to a number of complete genomes. Source code, data
sets and a web server are freely available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/.
Conclusion: The high accuracy of TM topology prediction which includes detection of both signal
peptides and re-entrant helices, combined with the ability to effectively discriminate between TM
and globular proteins, make this method ideally suited to whole genome annotation of alpha-helical
transmembrane proteins.

Background
Alpha-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins constitute
roughly 30% of a typical genome and are involved in a
wide variety of important biological processes including
cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules and cell recognition. However, due to the experimental difficulties involved in obtaining high quality

crystals, this class of protein is severely under represented
in structural databases, making up only 1.7% of known
structures in the PDB [1,2]. Given the biological and pharmacological importance of TM proteins, an understanding of their topology – the total number of TM helices,
their boundaries and in/out orientation relative to the
membrane – is essential for structural and functional

analysis, and directing further experimental work. In the
absence of structural data, sequence-based prediction
methods allow TM protein topology to be investigated.
Early prediction methods, based on the physicochemical
principle of a sliding window of hydrophobicity combined with the 'positive-inside' rule [3], have been superseded by machine learning approaches which prevail due
to their statistical formulation. These include Hidden
Markov models (HMMs), neural networks (NNs) and
more recently, support vector machines (SVMs). While
NNs and HMMs are capable of producing multiple outputs, SVMs are predominantly binary classifiers therefore
multiple SVMs must be employed to classify the numerous residue preferences before being combined into a
probabilistic framework. Like NNs and HMMs, SVMs are
capable of learning complex relationships among the
amino acids within a given window with which they are
trained, particularly when provided with evolutionary
information. However, they are considered more resilient
to the problem of over-training compared to other
machine learning methods.
One problem faced by modern topology predictors is the
discrimination between TM helices and other features
composed largely of hydrophobic residues. These include
targeting motifs such as signal peptides and signal
anchors, amphipathic helices, and re-entrant helices –
membrane penetrating helices that enter and exit the
membrane on the same side, common in many ion channel families. The high similarity between such features
and the hydrophobic profile of a TM helix frequently
leads to crosstalk between the different types of predictions. Should these elements be predicted as TM helices,
the ensuing topology prediction is likely to be corrupted.
Some prediction methods, such as SignalP [4] and TargetP
[5], are effective in identifying signal peptides, and may be
used as a pre-filter prior to analysis using a TM topology
predictor. Phobius [6] uses a HMM to successfully address
the problem of signal peptides in TM protein topology
prediction, while PolyPhobius [7] further increases accuracy by including homology information. Other methods
such as TMLOOP [8], TOP-MOD [9] and OCTOPUS [10]
have attempted to identify re-entrant regions, the latter
two in combination with a TM topology predictor, but
there is significant room for improvement.
TM topology predictors also exist that are able to use
experimentally derived information in order to guide
topology prediction. With reliable experimental data, prediction accuracy is likely to benefit substantially. Methods
include HMM-TM [11], HMMTOP [12] and TMHMMfix
[13]. Tools such as SOSUI [14] and PRED-CLASS [15] are
designed to discriminate between globular and TM proteins, while others such as PRED-TMBB [16] specialise in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/159

the discrimination and prediction of beta-barrel TM proteins.
A key element when constructing any prediction method
is the use of a high quality data set for both training and
validation purposes. Previously described TM data sets
such as the Möller set [17] have contained relatively few
sequences with structures available (33), but substantially
more with TM region annotation based on varying types
of biochemical characterisation (166). A number of experimental methods, including glycosylation analysis, insertion tags, antibody studies and fusion protein constructs,
allow the topological location of a region to be identified.
However, such studies are often conflicting [18,19] and
also risk upsetting the natural topology by altering the
protein sequence. As a result, orientation and helix
boundary errors in databases are not infrequent and add
an element of noise. While such noise is often well tolerated by machine learning methods, the problem is more
significant in smaller data sets. With a view to unifying,
updating and verifying existing resources while minimising topological error, a new TM data set has been created
containing protein sequences with topologies derived
solely from crystal structures.
We thus present a new TM topology predictor trained and
benchmarked with full cross-validation on a novel data
set of 131 sequences with crystal structures. The method
uses evolutionary information and four SVMs, combining
the outputs using a dynamic programming algorithm, to
return a list of predicted topologies ranked by overall likelihood, and incorporates signal peptide and re-entrant
helix prediction. Overall, the method predicted the correct
topology and location of TM helices for 89% of the test
set, a significant improvement on our previous NN-based
method MEMSAT3 [20]. An additional SVM has been
trained to discriminate between TM and globular proteins
with zero false positives and a low false negative rate of
0.4%, making this method highly suitable for whole
genome analysis.

Results and discussion
Support vector machine performance
Table 1 shows the per residue performance of each of the
five SVMs used by the method. The TM helix/¬TM helix
SVM performs significantly better than the re-entrant
helix/¬re-entrant helix and inside loop/outside loop
SVMs, and slightly better than the signal peptide/¬signal
peptide and TM protein/globular protein SVMs, reflecting
the relative ease with which the hydrophobic signal of a
TM helix is detected compared to sequence features within
the other topological regions. The Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) value of 0.80 compares favourably with
the equivalent value of 0.76 achieved by MEMSAT3 using
a NN when cross-validated against the same test set. We

found that the inclusion of unlabelled data for transductive learning led to a slightly lower MCC of 0.77, in addition to increasing training time, and thus parameter
optimisation time, substantially. As a result we excluded
unlabelled data when training the final model.
The inside loop/outside loop SVM was the only SVM to
perform optimally using a polynomial kernel, which justifies our use of multiple SVMs to classify each of the residue preferences rather than a single multiclass ranking
SVM. The highest MCC value we could achieve using a
radial basis function (RBF) kernel for this SVM was 0.35,
significantly lower than the value of 0.63 achieved using a
third-order polynomial kernel, therefore demonstrating
that no single kernel function is capable of optimally separating all the data classes and suggesting the structure of
loop data is strongly favoured by this kernel.
Detection of re-entrant helices remains challenging compared to other regions, with lack of training data a significant issue. Despite the addition of 64 proteins to the
training set, all were homologous to one of the original 11
re-entrant helix-containing proteins and were therefore
removed from the respective training files. Their contribution was therefore reflected by a low false positive rate of
0.008, but a low true positive rate of 0.478 owing to the
lack of positive training examples.
In contrast, the signal peptide/¬signal peptide and TM
protein/globular protein SVM performance was close to
that of the TM helix/¬TM helix SVM, aided by sufficient
quantities of training data. While largely driven by hydrophobicity, the signal peptide/¬signal peptide SVM must
accurately discriminate between signal peptides, which
contain a 7–15 residue long hydrophobic helix, and an
equally hydrophobic but slightly longer TM helix. For all
signal peptide-containing proteins, the residues ranked
highest by the SVM appear to be close to the C-terminal
end of the signal peptide region, suggesting the SVM is
efficiently detecting the polar and uncharged 3–8 amino
acid residue long C-region and the neutral residues that lie
adjacent to the cleavage point [21]. Similarly, the TM protein/globular protein SVM must discriminate between
hydrophobic residues that compose TM helices and those

that form the core of globular proteins, a challenge
reflected by the difference in MCC compared to the TM
helix/¬TM helix SVM.
Overall topology prediction accuracy
Table 2 shows the overall topology prediction accuracy
when applying the method to the test set of 131 TM proteins, alongside results for a number of other recent topology predictors. MEMSAT-SVM and MEMSAT3 results are
fully cross-validated as described above, with all proteins
homologous to the target being removed from training
sets, while results for the remaining methods were
obtained from their respective web servers and consequently are not cross-validated. OCTOPUS was also
trained exclusively using proteins with crystal structures
available, of which 121 sequences (92%) are present in
the test set, therefore results are likely to be significantly
overestimated.

To assess overall topology prediction accuracy, correct
prediction of 3 components were required: the N-terminal
location, number of TM helices and TM helix locations,
based on an overlap of at least 5 residues with boundary
definitions. Correct signal peptide and re-entrant helix
predictions were not required for a correct overall topology prediction, though failure to predict these features
was likely to result in an incorrect topology. Based on this
definition, MEMSAT-SVM correctly predicts topology in
89% (116 out of 131) of cases, a 10% improvement on
OCTOPUS which predicted 79% (103) of cases correctly
(column 10). Using a more stringent criterion of a 10-residue helix overlap, the margin increases to 11% (MEMSAT-SVM 87%, OCTOPUS 76%), suggesting good
segment end point prediction. In terms of the 3 individual
components, MEMSAT-SVM is consistently better than all
other methods (columns 3–5), and in particular performs
well at predicting the correct number of TM helices (95%
accuracy). MEMSAT-SVM also had a balanced number of
over- and under predictions (columns 6–7) which is
favourable to avoid bias towards either type of prediction,
and suggests good sensitivity while avoiding over predicting helices. Since this work was completed, an extension
to the OCTOPUS method which incorporates signal peptide prediction, SPOCTOPUS [22], has been released. This

method achieved 87% accuracy on the test set, largely
addressing the poor performance of OCTOPUS on
sequences containing signal peptides (column 8).
Signal peptide and re-entrant helix prediction
MEMSAT-SVM correctly predicts the topology of 93% (13
out of 14) of proteins which contain signal peptides, a
substantial improvement on the limited signal peptide
prediction capability of our previous method MEMSAT3.
In all 13 cases, signal peptides were also predicted. This
accuracy is matched by PHOBIUS, the only other method
that is specially trained to identify signal peptides in TM
proteins. Amongst proteins that did not contain signal
peptides, no false positive signal peptides were predicted.
Proteins containing re-entrant helices proved much
harder to predict, with only 64% (7 out of 11) correctly
predicted. This is matched by MEMSAT3 and HMMTOP,
though is slightly lower than the 73% (8) accuracy
achieved by OCTOPUS. However, this additional correct
prediction could well be attributed to the overlap between
the test and training sets, as, in the absence of cross-validation, MEMSAT-SVM is able to predict 82% (9) topologies correctly. In terms of predicting re-entrant helices,
MEMSAT-SVM identifies 44% (8 out of 18) with 2 false
positive predictions, which compares favourably with
OCTOPUS results of 22% (4) with 4 false positives. Since
the numbers of proteins containing re-entrant helices and
signal peptides are relatively small (14 and 11 respectively), care should be taken when interpreting these
results as a relatively large percentage difference in performance may only reflect the correct prediction of one
additional sequence.

Erroneous predictions
MEMSAT-SVM incorrectly predicts topologies in 15 cases.
Four of these correspond to proteins containing re-entrant
helices that are erroneously predicted as TM helices – ABC
transporter BtuCD, Proton Glutamate Symport protein,
Aquaporin Z and Clc chloride channel (PDB: 1l7vB,
1xfhA, 2abmH and 2feeB) – accounting for the majority
of over predicted TM helices. The remaining over prediction is due to a highly hydrophobic N-terminal region
within a chain from Cytochrome bc1 (PDB: 1sqxD).

In seven cases, incorrect topologies are a result of under
predicted TM helices – Photosystem I (chains A, L and K),
Steryl-sulfatase, Light-Harvesting Complex II, Particulate
Methane Monooxygenase and Sodium/proton antiporter
1 (PDB: 1jb0A, 1jb0L, 1jb0K, 1p49A, 1vcrA, 1yewB and
1zcdB). These under predictions fall into two categories;
weakly predicted helices (PDB: 1jb0A, 1jb0L, 1jb0K,
1p49A and 1vcrA) or prediction of one helix rather than
two shorter ones (PDB: 1yewB and 1zcdB). Of the weakly
predicted helix errors, sequence analysis indicates low
hydrophobicity for many of these helices, often due to a
large fraction of charged residues. Such helices are therefore extremely difficult to predict and suggest a novel
membrane insertion mechanism. Other helices appear
sufficiently hydrophobic to be detected; errors are possibly the results of PSI-BLAST alignment which reduce their
detectability.
The remaining three incorrect predictions are all single TM
helix proteins that are inverted – Photosystem I, Cytochrome bc1 and Cytochrome b6f (PDB: 1jb0I, 1p84I and

1q90N). In all three cases, the confidence of the prediction compared to the correct topology (measured by the
difference between the two scores) is extremely small.
With no clear signal to differentiate between either orientation, interplay with other chains from the same protein
may influence the final conformation.
Prediction accuracy using the Möller and TOPDB data sets
We additionally tested prediction performance using a
subset of 184 sequences from the Möller set, described in
[11,14], composed of sequences annotated using both
crystal structures and biochemical characterisation (Table
3). The Möller set consists of a significantly higher fraction
of eukaryotic sequences compared to the data set
described above. TM protein crystallisation techniques
usually involve over expression hosts, such as Escherichia
coli, which to date have worked mainly for prokaryotic TM
proteins since eukaryotic TM proteins are still very difficult to over express [23]. Crystal structure-based sets,
while providing more accurate TM helix boundary definitions, thus suffer from this bias towards prokaryotic
sequences, so methods trained exclusively using such data
sets run the risk of performing poorly when predicting the
topologies of eukaryotic sequences. Based on recent
updates to SWISS-PROT annotations and under full crossvalidation, MEMSAT-SVM achieved 78% accuracy and
MEMSAT3 achieved 77%. In the absence of cross-validation, SPOCTOPUS also achieved 77% accuracy, with
OCTOPUS the next best method scoring 69%. This performance suggests MEMSAT-SVM offers robust prediction
accuracy on proteins from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic domains.

We then tested performance using the TOPDB [24] data
set, a comprehensive collection of TM protein containing
experimentally derived topology information (Table 3). It
currently contains records for 1452 alpha-helical TM proteins. Using this data set, MEMSAT-SVM achieved 67%
accuracy, MEMSAT3 66%, OCTOPUS 64% and PHOBIUS

62%. The data set also contains 317 sequences containing
signal peptides. Of these, MEMSAT-SVM correctly predicted the topologies for 77% of cases. This value was
lower than that of PHOBIUS which achieved 85% accuracy. However, the MEMSAT-SVM false positive rate for
signal peptide prediction is 7%, half the PHOBIUS value
of 14%. These results show that on this data set, MEMSATSVM signal peptide performance is below that of PHOBIUS, though MEMSAT-SVM overall prediction accuracy
is 5% higher due to the relatively poor performance of
PHOBIUS on sequences that do not contain signal peptides (a substantially larger fraction) – 54% accuracy compared to 63% for MEMSAT-SVM. These results should
again be treated with caution as they were not cross-validated.
These results are clearly lower than those attained using
the crystal structure-based data set, and we believe this is
likely due to errors in TOPDB. We analysed sequences
from the original, uncorrected Möller set that at the time
did not have crystal structures. 55 of these sequences now
have a homologous PDB structure (E-value < 0.001), and
of these only 38 (69%) of the original Möller topologies
are correct based on current OPM definitions (taking into
account only the N-terminal location and TM helix
count). There is no reason to believe that the error rate in
other data sets such as TOPDB, composed predominantly
of sequences whose topologies were determined by biochemical means, should be significantly different. Perfect
prediction methods are therefore unlikely to be able to
achieve results higher than this, while older methods
trained on erroneous topologies have the potential to
achieve higher scores but may in reality be poorer predictors, a fact likely to be highlighted when tested against a
crystal structure-based set.
Discriminating between globular and transmembrane
proteins
Using the combined set of 2453 test cases, we assessed
performance in discriminating between globular and TM
proteins (Table 4). As a discrimination threshold, a
number of residues were required to be predicted as part
of a TM helix by the SVM in order to classify the protein as
TM. This threshold was adjusted in order to minimise the
margin between the false positive (FP) and false negative
(FN) rates, therefore avoiding bias towards either type of
prediction. A 0% FP rate and 0.4% FN rate was achieved
using only a single residue as the threshold, an improvement on the MEMSAT3 neural network-based approach
(0.5% FP, 0.5% FN) and SOSUI (0.3% FP, 1.1% FN).
OCTOPUS matched the FP rate but achieved a higher FN
rate, while PHOBIUS matched the FN rate but achieved a
higher FP rate. These low error rates suggest that MEMSATSVM is extremely well suited to whole genome analysis.

Application to a number of complete genomes
Table 5 shows the results of applying the TM/globular predictor to a number of complete genomes. We estimate
that a typical genome contains between 24% and 33% TM
proteins, which is slightly higher than previous estimates
of between 20% and 30% [32]. Two organisms that have
a noticeably higher fraction of TM proteins are Caenorhabditis elegans and Takifugu rubripes. Takifugu rubripes is
known to have extensive channel heterogeneity compared
to Homo sapiens, with 10 Homo sapiens voltage-gated calcium channel α1-subunit genes revealing 21 orthologous
genes in Takifugu rubripes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals
that this is due to fish lineage specific α1-subunit subtype
duplication [33]. Similar increased subtype diversity has
also been detected in the appetite receptor neuropeptide Y
GPCR family that may have arisen as a result of ray-finned
fish tetraploidization [34]. Caenorhabditis elegans is known
to have an exceptionally large number of 7 TM receptors
and rhodopsin-like membrane proteins [35], thought to
have been arisen through duplication events, that possibly imply functional relations between homologous 7 TM
domains [36]. Escherichia coli has the lowest fraction of
TM proteins of all the species we analysed, which may be
a consequence of the lack of internal membrane systems
in prokaryotes [37].

We then carried out full topology prediction on sequences
predicted to be TM proteins and analysed these for the
presence of re-entrant helices and signal peptides. In most

species, re-entrant helices were detected in at least 2% of
TM proteins, with more than 3% detected in Takifugu
rubripes which can be explained by the extensive channel
heterogeneity discussed above. However, given the low
true positive rate of 44%, this figure is likely to be an
underestimate. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.8
suggests a value in the range 3–4.5% is more realistic. This
range is close to one previous estimate of 5% [38] but
below another of 10% [8], although the latter was based
on a broader definition of re-entrant regions that did not
necessarily contain helical secondary structure.
Topology prediction results illustrate consistent trends
across all species, with significant peaks at 7 TM helices
representing GPCRs (in eukaryotes) and 12 TM helices
representing transporters proteins (Figure 1). A slight preference for even-numbered topologies (excluding GPCRs)
can be explained by the formation of 2 helix hairpins as
independent units during protein assembly, therefore
favouring topologies with even numbers of TM helices
[39]. In all species, the most dominant topology is a single
TM helix. These results are consistent with previous studies [40].

Conclusion
In this paper we have implemented a novel SVM-based
TM protein topology predictor, an area previously dominated by HMM and NN-based machine learning
approaches, and have shown that it outperforms a selec-

tion of the best performing prediction methods when
fully cross-validated on a novel high resolution data set of
131 protein sequences. This data set includes proteins
containing both re-entrant helices and signal peptides,
features that this method is also able to predict. The
method has also been benchmarked on the Möller data
set, which contains a higher fraction of eukaryotic
sequences, improving on the best current methods. And
we have achieved extremely low false positive and false
negative rates for TM/globular protein discrimination.
Using these tools, we have estimated the fraction of TM
proteins, re-entrant helices and signal peptides in a
number of complete genomes. Overall, our results suggest
that MEMSAT-SVM is ideally suited to whole genome
annotation of alpha-helical TM proteins.

Methods
Assembling a novel data set of transmembrane proteins
The novel data set was based solely on crystal structure
data. Additional information was collected from
MPTOPO [41], OPM [42], PDB_TM [43], SWISS-PROT
[44] and from the literature. SWISS-PROT files were

parsed for entries containing the keyword 'TRANSMEM'
in feature table (FT) lines. N-terminal data was also
extracted using keyword 'TOPO_DOM' where available.
To avoid partial sequences being included, any entries
containing keywords such as 'FRAGMENT' were excluded.
Sequences were then scanned against the PDB in order to
identify entries for which the TM region had complete
structural coverage. Alignments occasionally highlighted
chain breaks. In these cases, the sequence was excluded
unless a visual inspection ensured the topology could not
be cast in doubt by the break. This left a redundant data
set containing 944 sequences which was then homology
reduced at the 40% sequence identity level. A number of
sequences were then removed. These included colicins
(e.g. PDB: 1col) and bee venom (PDB: 2mlt) which are
bilayer disrupting and thus are not native integral membrane proteins, sequences labelled as 'secreted protein',
and sequences where the N-terminal location or topology
could not be verified.
OPM was then used to define TM helix boundaries, or in
the absence of an OPM entry, PDB_TM was used. OPM

uses a theoretical multi-feature approach to position proteins in a membrane which has been shown to be in good
agreement with experimental studies of 24 TM proteins.
In some cases where a visual inspection appeared to indicate an incorrect placement of the membrane, PDB_TM
helix boundary definitions were used instead. For example, OPM lists Mechanosensitive channel protein MscS
(PDB: 2oau) as having two TM helices, neither of which
fully cross the membrane, whereas the PDB_TM definition of 3 TM helices appears more plausible.
PDB_TM was also used to annotate proteins containing
re-entrant helices. A re-entrant helix was defined as a
helix-containing region that enters and exits the membrane on the same side, penetrating at least 6Å but not
more than 6Å from the opposite membrane face. Reentrant regions that did not contain a helix formed by at
least three contiguous amino acid residues were excluded.
Sequences containing signal peptides were then labelled
according to SWISS-PROT annotations.
The composition of the final data set containing 131
sequences, all with available crystal structures, verifiable
topology and N-terminal locations, is show in table 6.
Support vector machine training
As Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are binary classifiers
[45], we chose to combine multiple SVMs to classify each
of the residue preferences found in TM proteins. Although
multiclass ranking SVMs do exist, they are generally considered unreliable since in many cases no single mathematical function exists to separate all classes of data from
one another [46]. We therefore trained four SVMs to classify TM helix/¬TM helix, inside loop/outside loop, reentrant helix/¬re-entrant helix and signal peptide/¬signal
peptide. Residue labelling was performed according to
our data set definitions.

PSI-BLAST [47] was used to generate position-specific
scoring matrices for each of the proteins in the data set

using the UniRef 90 database. Two iterations were performed with a profile-inclusion E-value threshold of
0.001 in order to reduce false positive hits, to which TM
proteins are more prone than globular proteins [48]. For
each residue in a sequence, a sliding window approach
was used to create a feature vector of length 20 × W, where
W is the size of the window centred on the target residue.
Where the window extended beyond the protein termini,
empty feature values were set to zero. All values for each
feature position where then normalised by Z-score to enable faster SVM convergence. Initial attempts at scaling values between 0 and 1 had resulted in lower overall
prediction accuracy.

Z=

x is the raw score to be normalised. μ and σ are the mean
and standard deviation PSI-BLAST score for each of the 20
amino acid, generated using profiles for all 131
sequences.
In order to accentuate the contribution of re-entrant helices for which data is particularly sparse, the sequences of
64 proteins, all homologous to the 11 re-entrant helixcontaining sequences in our initial data set, were also used
to train the TM helix/¬TM helix and re-entrant helix/¬reentrant helix SVMs. Helix, loop and re-entrant helix
boundaries were determined by PDB_TM definitions.
We also attempted to train the TM helix/¬TM helix SVM
using unlabelled data via transduction. In transduction,
the learning task is to assign labels to unlabelled data as
accurately as possible [49]. SVMs can perform transduction by finding the hyperplane that maximises the margin
relative to both the labelled and unlabelled data, in order
to improve the generalisation performance. We selected
sequences from SWISS-PROT identified by the MEMSAT3
TM/globular protein discriminator as TM proteins.
Sequences with greater than 40% sequence identity to
sequences in the labelled data set were removed, as were
those with signal peptides predicted by SignalP. Of those
remaining, 135 sequences were used as unlabelled training data.
For training the signal peptide/¬signal peptide SVM, we
included data from the Phobius training set which contains 2654 well annotated examples of TM and globular
proteins, with and without signal peptides. This was supplemented by a search of SWISS-PROT for sequences
labelled with the keyword 'SIGNAL' (but excluding entries
labelled 'POTENTIAL' or 'BY SIMILARITY') to add to the
signal peptide set, and sequences without keyword 'SIGNAL' to add to the non-signal peptide set. The combined
set was then homology reduced at the 40% sequence iden-

tity level, leaving 3205 (1222 with signal peptides, 1983
without signal peptides) sequences for which PSI-BLAST
profiles were then generated as outlined above.
Stringent cross validation was performed using a jack
knife test (leave-one-out cross validation) for the TM
helix/¬TM helix, inside loop/outside loop and re-entrant
helix/¬re-entrant helix SVMs. In training, the target
sequence, along with any other sequences with greater
than 25% sequence identity, were excluded. For the signal
peptide/¬signal peptide SVM we used 10-fold cross validation, again excluding sequences from the training set
with greater than 25% sequence identity to any sequence
in the test set. For training and classification, SVM-Light
[50] was used. The performance of several kernels was
investigated in combination with a comprehensive grid
search of SVM parameters. To determine optimal windows sizes, the data set was split randomly into two and
the highest scoring window which ranked equally in each
split was selected, therefore demonstrating consistency
between data sets and reducing the risk of overfitting. We
used the MCC to optimise these values which is a more
robust measure than using recall or precision alone [51].
To calculate a list of topologies ranked by overall likelihood, the TM helix/¬TM helix, inside loop/outside loop
and signal peptide/¬signal peptide raw SVM outputs were
combined in a modified version of the dynamic programming algorithm used in the original MEMSAT method
[52]. The algorithm was simplified by treating TM helices
as discrete units, rather than separating them into inside,
outside and middle components, though a signal peptide
state was added. Loop regions between predicted TM helices were scanned for re-entrant helices using the reentrant helix/¬re-entrant helix raw SVM output and a simple scoring function. For evaluating signal peptide preference, residues with positive signal peptide scores up to
position 40 in a target sequence were added to the outside
loop score and subtracted from the inside loops score
where positive, in order to direct prediction towards a
non-cytoplasmic amino-terminus. The value was also
scaled by a factor of 10 and subtracted from the TM helix
SVM score to prevent TM helix prediction. Residues were
therefore predicted to lie in one of five different topological regions: inside loop, outside loop, TM helix, re-entrant
helix and signal peptide.

tors. For this method and MEMSAT3, the appropriate
cross-validated training data was used in assessing performance. Where equivalent data was unavailable for the
other methods, performance is likely to be overestimated
as it is likely that there is significant overlap between test
and training sets. We also assessed performance of the
method against proteins containing signal peptides and
re-entrant helices.
We also trained an additional SVM to discriminate
between TM and globular proteins, to be used as a pre-filter prior to TM topology prediction. For SVM training, we
used the data set of 131 TM proteins and 416 globular
proteins from non-redundant PDB chains as used by
MEMSAT3. To accurately compare with MEMSAT3 we
used exactly the same test set consisting of 184 TM proteins from the Möller data set and a separate set of 2269
non-redundant globular protein chains, giving a total of
2453 test cases. PSI-BLAST profiles were generated for all
sequences and 10-fold cross validation was used to assess
performance, again removing sequences from the training
fold with greater than 25% sequences identity to any
sequence in the test fold.
For whole genome analysis, ten genomes – nine eukaryotic and one prokaryotic – were downloaded from the
Ensembl [53] and NCBI [54] websites. Protein sequences
were extracted and PSI-BLAST profiles were generated
using the SWISS-PROT database. The TM/globular predictor was used to identify TM proteins, which were then subject to full topology prediction.

To evaluate performance, four metrics were used. Firstly,
correct location of the amino terminus; secondly, correct
number of TM helices; thirdly, correct number and location of TM helices (based on an overlap of at least five residues with the helix boundaries in our data set) and
fourthly, correct overall topology. For comparison, we
also evaluated a number of other leading topology predic-
