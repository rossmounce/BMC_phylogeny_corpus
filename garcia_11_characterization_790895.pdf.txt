Abstract
Background: Over recent years, a growing effort has been made to develop microsatellite markers for the
genomic analysis of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) to broaden the knowledge of the molecular genetic
basis of this species. The availability of large sets of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in public databases has given
rise to an expedient approach for the identification of SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats), specifically EST-derived
SSRs. In the present work, a battery of new microsatellite markers was obtained from a search of the Phaseolus
vulgaris EST database. The diversity, degree of transferability and polymorphism of these markers were tested.
Results: From 9,583 valid ESTs, 4,764 had microsatellite motifs, from which 377 were used to design primers, and
302 (80.11%) showed good amplification quality. To analyze transferability, a group of 167 SSRs were tested, and
the results showed that they were 82% transferable across at least one species. The highest amplification rates
were observed between the species from the Phaseolus (63.7%), Vigna (25.9%), Glycine (19.8%), Medicago (10.2%),
Dipterix (6%) and Arachis (1.8%) genera. The average PIC (Polymorphism Information Content) varied from 0.53 for
genomic SSRs to 0.47 for EST-SSRs, and the average number of alleles per locus was 4 and 3, respectively. Among
the 315 newly tested SSRs in the BJ (BAT93 X Jalo EEP558) population, 24% (76) were polymorphic. The integration
of these segregant loci into a framework map composed of 123 previously obtained SSR markers yielded a total of
199 segregant loci, of which 182 (91.5%) were mapped to 14 linkage groups, resulting in a map length of 1,157
cM.
Conclusions: A total of 302 newly developed EST-SSR markers, showing good amplification quality, are available
for the genetic analysis of Phaseolus vulgaris. These markers showed satisfactory rates of transferability, especially
between species that have great economic and genomic values. Their diversity was comparable to genomic SSRs,
and they were incorporated in the common bean reference genetic map, which constitutes an important
contribution to and advance in Phaseolus vulgaris genomic research.

Background
Since the beginning of civilization, the legumes, together
with the cereals, have been considered essential for the
development of modern agriculture, occupying the second rank in terms of planted area and production of
grains. In the human diet, they are a valuable source of

protein and are used as sources of edible oils and fodder
plants for animals [1]. The Leguminosae family, among
the superior plants, is considered the third largest
family. It is composed of approximately 700 genera and
20,000 described species, of which approximately 60 are
domesticated. The Phaseolus genus belongs to the subfamily Papilionoideae. It originates in the Americas and
is comprised of more than 30 species, whereas only
Phaseolus vulgaris, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus coccineus, Phaseolus acutifolius and Phaseolus polyanthus are

domesticated [2]. The Phaseolus vulgaris species (common bean) is cultivated and occupies 85% of the production area of all Phaseolus species in the world [3].
Among vegetables and grains, the common bean is the
most important for direct human consumption on all
continents [4].
The significant advances in the genomic resources of
the last two decades, including reduction of costs and
greater accessibility to molecular technologies, have
allowed for improvements in the knowledge regarding
the structure and organization of the genomes of different organisms [5]. Recently, important progress has
been made on the genome sequencing of the legumes,
including soybean (Glycine max), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus japonicus),
all of which are considered model organisms due to
their biological functions, reduced genome sizes and
economic importance [6]. Among these species, the soybean genome was the largest sequenced using a shotgun
approach, and the assembled sequences were integrated
in a genetic and physical map, allowing the investigation
of the genome composition, duplication, organization
and transcriptional factors [7]. As a result, there is a realistic possibility to apply the knowledge attained regarding the soybean genome to other economically
important legume species, particularly due to the synteny and collinearity among these plants. Phylogenetic
relationships within the legume family [8] are reflected
in relatively high similarity, or synteny, at the genome
level among the temperate climate legumes, including
Medicago sp. and pea [9], or between the tropical climate legumes, such as the common bean and soybean
[10].
Comparative genomic analyses are important strategies for attempting to understand the structural and
functional aspects of genomes and have contributed to
the elucidation of evolutionary and phylogenetic aspects
between species [5]. Macro-synteny studies have enabled
the investigation of gene order conservation through
comparative mapping or in silico sequence homology
analyses. The development of primers from expressed
sequences that are available in public databases have
made their use more accessible but are still restricted to
those species for which the genome sequence information is available. Among the legumes, microsatellites
have been developed for the lentil [11], common bean
[12-15], Vigna [16], chickpea [17], Medicago [18] and
soybean [19,20]. The transferability of these markers
between species from the same genus, and even across
genera in the same family, is possible in many cases.
The conservation of microsatellite loci has been
described for several plant species [21]. In legumes, studies have demonstrated that microsatellite markers were
successfully amplified between species in the genus

Medicago [22,18], and a high intra-specific transferability
rate was observed in the genus Vigna [23]. In the genus
Phaseolus, [24] a transferability rate of 50% in microsatellite markers was observed between the species P. coccineus, P. polyanthus, P. acutifolius and P. lunatus.
The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a predominantly self-pollinating diploid species with a genome
size estimated at 637 Mbp [25] that is distributed
among 22 chromosomes (n = 11). The first genetic map
developed for the common bean was derived from the
crossing of BAT93 × Jalo EEP558 (BJ), which was considered to be the core map for the common bean based
on 194 RFLP markers and is called the Map Davis [26].
Later, using the same BJ mapping population, a second
version of the map was developed that integrated RFLP
and RAPD markers [27], followed by a more complete
version that included 563 markers and covered 1,226
cM of genome length. In the present decade, with the
availability of microsatellite markers for the common
bean, an increasing set of these markers began to be
integrated into the core map [13,28], resulting in a linkage map based exclusively on microsatellite markers for
the BJ population [29]. More recently, a new, expanded
version of the core linkage map, also using the BJ population, was released and included markers with putative
gene functions [30].
The specific objectives of this work were the following:
(1) to characterize the common bean EST databases for
the presence and nature of microsatellites, (2) to develop
a battery of new microsatellite markers for Phaseolus
vulgaris from the in silico analysis, (3) to assess the
polymorphism, diversity and degree of transferability
across the Leguminosae family between a group of
genomic-SSRs and EST-SSRs to establish a comparison
among the results obtained and (4) to screen for polymorphic microsatellite markers in the BAT93 X Jalo
EEP558 population for their integration into the core
map.

Results
SSR amplification

A total of 9,583 valid ESTs corresponding to 3,281 contigs and 6,302 singletons were screened for the presence
of useful SSRs. Based on the criteria adopted, 4,764
SSRs with lengths of at least six repeat units were identified, including 1,950 in contigs and 2,814 in singletons.
The mononucleotide motifs were the most abundant
(80%), followed by mono-compounds (15%), which contained more than two repeat motifs, dinucleotides
(1.7%), trinucleotides (1.5%), di- (1.32%), tri-compounds
(0.38%), hexanucleotides (0.06%) and tetranucleotides
(0.04%). Among the dinucleotide sequences, the motif
AG/TC had the highest frequency, representing 71% of
the sampled sequences, followed by motifs AT/TA

(20%), TG/AC (8%) and GC/CG (1%). A set of 377 ESTSSR markers were developed. Primer sequences and
information on the SSRs derived from the EST GenBank
are available in Additional file 1, Table S1.
The first evaluation was performed to check for primer amplification quality and performance under the
same amplification conditions. The results demonstrated
that out of the 377 EST-SSRs, 281 (74.5%) primers generated a scorable amplification product, while 24
(6.37%) generated non-specific products and 72 (19.1%)
failed to amplify. In a second evaluation, after making
adjustments to the PCR conditions, 30 primers were
recovered, which increased the number of EST-SSRs
that generated satisfactory amplification products to 302
(80.1%) (Additional file 1, Table S1). Of these, 149
(49.3%) showed single bands and 153 (50.6%) showed
interpretable PCR products, although they contained
some nonspecific bands. The remaining 33 (8.75%) primers failed to produce bands with a scorable pattern,
even after adjustments to the PCR conditions, and were
not used in additional analyses. Regarding the efficiency
of amplification for each repeat motif, mononucleotides
(34.5%) had the highest rate of PCR amplification, followed by di- (31.3%), tri- (22.3%), hexa- (0.53%) and tetranucleotides (0.26%). Among the 302 useful EST-SSRs
markers, 232 (76.8%) generated amplification products
with the expected size, while 48 (15.9%) and 22 (7.28%)
markers generated products that were longer and smaller than the expected size, respectively.
From the 44 SSRs previously developed from genomic
libraries and based exclusively on dinucleotide repeats,
13 (29.5%) were successfully amplified with a clear and
specific band pattern, five (11.4%) with interpretable
PCR products but containing some stutter bands; the
remaining 26 (59.1%) failed to amplify and were not
used in further analyses. Thus, a total of 315 markers
(302 EST-derived and 13 genomic SSRs) that showed a
scorable pattern of amplification products were screened
for polymorphism in the BJ population.
Transferability across the Leguminosae and within the
genus Phaseolus

To assess the transferability of the SSR loci across
Legume species, the cross-amplification of 167 primers
(102 genomic SSRs, five previously developed ESTderived markers, and 60 newly developed EST-SSR markers that showed robust amplification products) were
tested against 20 genotypes, representing 11 species of
the Leguminosae family. These species included the following: Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago sativa, Phaseolus
lunatus, Phaseolus coccineus, Phaseolus acutifolius,
Vigna mungo, Vigna angularis, Vigna unguiculata, Glycine max, Arachis hypogaea and Dipteryx alata. The
resulting amplification profiles for each locus were

assigned individually for each species and are shown as
Additional file 2 (Table S2). From the 65 EST-SSRs, 61
(93.8%) amplified across at least one species, and only
four (6.15%) were species-specific. For the 102 markers
that were derived from genomic libraries, 76 (74.5%)
amplified across at least one species and 26 (25.5%)
failed to produce any cross-amplification product (Additional file 3, Figure S1). The number of transferable
markers across all species ranged from 119 (71.3%) to
three (1.79%) for Phaseolus acutifolius and Arachis
hypogaea, respectively, with an average cross-amplification ratio of 32%.
As expected, the highest ratio of interspecies crossamplification was observed for the species within the
genus Phaseolus (63.7%), followed by Vigna (25.9%),
Glycine (19.8%), Medicago (10.2%) and Dipterix (6%),
while the genus Arachis had a transferability ratio of
only 1.8%. Among the entire set of markers, 69 (41.3%)
were transferable across the three species within the
genus Phaseolus, from which 45 (69.2%) were ESTderived markers and 24 (23.5%) were genomic markers.
From the whole set of transferable SSRs, the best pattern of amplification was observed for those that were
transferred to the genus Phaseolus acutifolius (119 markers), of which 60 (50.4%) were EST-SSRs and 59
(49.6%) were genomic SSRs.
The molecular sizes of the alleles produced by each
SSR marker are shown in Additional file 2, Table S2.
Among the 137 transferable primer pairs, 108 produced
amplification products within the expected size range,
16 produced products that were considered longer than
expected and 13 produced products that were smaller
than expected. Markers PVEST112 and PVEST6 produced alleles that were 182 bp longer and 61 bp smaller,
respectively, than the expected size ranges.
Genetic diversity of EST and genomic SSRs

The genetic diversity of SSRs was assessed based on the
16 Phaseolus vulgaris genotypes, which represent six
commercial grain classes. Among the entire set of 167
SSRs tested, 121 (72.5%) detected allelic variation
between the genotyped samples, and the remaining 46
(27.5%) were monomorphic. Hence, the estimates
described below were obtained only for the polymorphic
markers, from which 53 were EST-SSRs and 68 were
genomic SSR markers. The average PIC value for the
complete set of markers was 0.50, with estimates ranging from 0.12 (PVEST203) to 0.89 (BM187). With
regard to the 68 genomic SSRs, the number of alleles
ranged from a minimum of two to a maximum of 11
alleles, with an average of four alleles per locus. The
PIC values ranged from 0.22 to 0.89, with an average of
0.53. Among the EST-SSRs, the minimum and maximum numbers of alleles were two and 11, respectively,

Linkage analysis

From the 315 new SSRs screened for polymorphism, 76
(24.1%) segregated in the BJ population, of which 72 were
EST-SSRs and four were genomic SSRs. Only a set of two
(2.63%) SSR markers could be easily interpretable in agarose gels (PVEST1 and PVEST279), while the remaining 74
(97.4%) were genotyped in polyacrylamide gels (Additional
file 4, Figure S2). As indicated by the c2 test, 54 (71.1%) of
the 76 SSRs segregated in accordance with the expected
Mendelian ratios, while 22 (28.9%) showed significant segregation distortion at p < 0.05. Using the FDR method to
correct for multiple comparisons by controlling the chance

Garcia et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/41

of a false positive, only 12 (15.9%) markers showed significant segregation distortion. Among these, four were
skewed towards the Andean parent, Jalo EEP558, and
eight were skewed towards the Mesoamerican parent,
BAT93. All loci with segregation distortions were ESTSSRs and were maintained in the linkage analysis because
no order alteration was observed when they were removed
from the analysis. The 12 distorted markers were mapped
across four linkage groups (chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 7),
and two clusters of four and three markers were observed
on chromosome 7B. All of the distorted markers that were
mapped to chromosome 7 showed distortions towards
BAT93, and three out four markers that were skewed
towards EEP558 were mapped to chromosome 1. Despite
the distortions, all mapped loci were placed with a minimum LOD score of 3.0.

Page 6 of 14

The integration of the SSRs into the BJ linkage map
resulted in a dataset of 199 polymorphic markers, from
which 117 were genomic SSRs and 82 were EST-SSRs.
A total of 182 (91.5%) markers could be mapped at an
LOD score ≥3.0 (θ = 0.30) and were distributed into 14
linkage groups. These groups represent the 11 chromosomes of the common bean and the three extra small
chromosome segments (Figure 1). The extra chromosomes (1A, 7A and 11B) had three markers each and
are unlinked segments mapped to the tip of chromosomes 1 and 7 and the end of chromosome 11. Chromosome assignments were performed according to [31].
Marker distribution along the chromosomes ranged
from 3 (chromosomes 1A, 7A and 11B) to 26 (chromosome 2), and chromosome sizes varied from 12.33 cM
(chromosome 1A) to 176.72 cM (chromosome 2) with

Figure 1 Common bean linkage map based on 182 SSR markers. The mapped markers include genomic and EST-derived SSR loci
segregating in the BAT93 × Jalo EEP558 population. Distances are indicated in cM Kosambi. Microsatellites were mapped with a minimum LOD
of 3.0. Markers that showed segregation distortions are starred (*; p < 0.05) and labeled with (B) or (J), indicating the predominance of alleles
from BAT93 or Jalo EEP558, respectively.

an average size of 88.82 ± 44.07 cM. The total map distance was estimated at 1,156.2 cM with an average marker distance of 6.65 ± 1.64 cM, and the maximum
distance between two markers was 26.0 cM (PVEST159
and AJ416391 on the end of chromosome 3). The distribution of the EST-SSRs appeared to be relatively random and dispersed throughout the Phaseolus genome.
Among the 72 polymorphic EST-SSRs, 65 were assigned
to 12 chromosomes with the number of markers ranging from 3 (chromosomes 11A, 11B, 5, 3, 8 and 9) to
11 (chromosome 2).
The comparative analysis was performed using the
current map and a previous map, which was also based
solely on SSR markers and on the same BJ population
developed by [29] and considering the chromosome
assignments as defined by Pedrosa-Harand et al. 2008
[31]. From a set of 123 SSR markers common to both
segregation analyses, 105 were mapped to the current
linkage analysis, while 106 were mapped to the previous
map. The marker BM152, which was mapped to chromosome 9 in the previous study, could not be mapped
in our study. Based on a visual comparison, it was
observed that all SSRs common to both maps maintained their positions in the same linkage group. However, order inversions were observed in almost all
chromosomes, except for chromosome 11. All inversions
observed were due to single marker rearrangements,
which accounted for 19 order inversions and resulted in
a marker order conservation of 81%.
To explore the potential of the EST-SSRs for use in
the structural genome exploitation of Phaseolus, a
search was performed in GenBank, using BLASTX,
against the sequences of the polymorphic markers. The
BLAST results showed that 44 (57.9%) of the 76 polymorphic EST-SSRs had similarity to GenBank
sequences, while the other 32 (42.1%) did not show any
significant matches (Table 3). Out of the 44 EST-SSRs,
13 (29.5%) showed homology with genes of known putative functions in the Legume family and 31 (70.5%) with
different organisms, predominantly with Arabidopsis
thaliana.

Discussion
In the present work, the distribution of repetitive
sequences, or microsatellites, formed by either one or
more base pairs of longer than six units, has been studied to develop a broad set of useful SSR markers for
the common bean derived from a public EST database.
The goal was to attribute a genetic value to the ESTSSRs to increase their potential use. In addition, the
relatively low cost to obtain these markers, when compared to the development of genomic libraries, is an
attractive choice. This choice is evident mainly in species with a narrow genetic base for which a high

Page 7 of 14

number of SSRs is necessary to detect polymorphism.
Currently, there are about 36,626 sequences in the Phaseolus EST data set, which accounts for an increase of
31% in the last six months and represents a new potential source of SSR markers for the common bean. Similar approaches for SSR mining in EST databases have
been applied for the common bean [13,15] as were used
for the other related species of the Legume family
[6,32]. From our data mining, the criteria established for
SSR identification was unusual and less stringent, leading to the identification of mononucleotide and compound repeats. As a consequence, mononucleotides
were the most frequent, followed by di- and trinucleotides. This result is in contrast with the previous observations for several species [33], but it is consistent with
the observations [34] for dicotyledons. The composite
motifs accounted for 30% of the SSRs identified, considering dinucleotide repeats or higher motifs, which was
similar to the findings reported by [15] that identified
34% of such motifs. A reduced set of available markers
would result from screening the non-redundant Phaseolus ESTs for SSRs, using the parameters of dinucleotide
or more repeats, limiting the length of SSRs and keeping
only the perfect repeats. Consequently, only 3.27% of the
sequences containing SSRs would be adequate for primer design, which translates to 156 EST-SSRs. Indeed,
in Arabidopsis and pepper, very close estimates were
obtained when the criteria of stringency was increased,
resulting in 3% and 3.6% of ESTs containing SSRs,
respectively [33,35].
Although most markers were based on mononucleotide repeats, they showed satisfactory levels of PCR
amplification that were even higher than those derived
from the genomic sequences of common beans. The
search for these repeats increased the number of SSR
markers available for genetic analysis with a broad spectrum of applications. The rates of SSR amplification
normally show a wide range in plants, such as those
reported for barley and tomato with 64% and 83%,
respectively [36,37]. In the present work, 80% of the
EST-SSRs were amplified. Similar levels of EST-SSR
amplification have been reported for the common bean
by [12] and [13]. These reports also found successful
amplification in 81% of the SSRs derived from the public
database GenBank. A slightly higher value of 87% was
reported by [15] using EST-SSRs derived from a private
database. These values are comparable to those reported
for SSRs derived from genomic libraries, which are
described by [29] and [38], who found amplification
rates of 86% and 81%, respectively. The high rate of success in the amplification of EST-SSRs in the common
bean may be the result of several factors, such as the
quality of the sequences from which the primers were
derived, the adequate criteria used for primer design

and the use of the same species for the design and
amplification of the primer set. Although EST-derived
SSR markers are generally less polymorphic than genomic SSRs, the value of EST-SSRs when compared to
genomic SSRs is enhanced by several factors. These

factors include their level of transferability, their potential to attribute function to genes affecting traits of
interest and the readiness in the identification of SSRs
by in silico data mining with reduced time, labor and
cost.

Garcia et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/41

Not surprisingly, the results presented in this work
indicate that the EST-SSRs showed higher rates of transferability across the Legume species than the genomic
SSRs. A total of 93.8% of the EST-SSRs were transferable for at least one species as compared with 74.5% of
the genomic SSRs. The higher transferability rate of
EST-SSRs can be explained by their correspondence to
the transcribed component of a gene unit, which confers
a high potential for inter-specific transferability [39].
The recent increase in the availability of the EST-SSRs
derived from public databases can be expected to provide an additional source of transferable markers among
less related species. Transferability of EST-SSRs has
been reported for several species [37,40]. Transferability
across the Legume family was lower than within Phaseolus genus, in which 64% of the markers produced amplification products in all tested species. These findings are
in accordance with the report by [32], which described
that a high degree of genome conservation has been
identified between the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus. However, genome conservation tends to be reduced as we move to the Phaseoloid
clades, such as soybean (G. max), common bean (P. vulgaris) and Vigna (including cowpea and Asian Vigna).
Generally, successful cross-amplification between the
genera appears to be lower than within the genera. In a
study with soybean, [41] found an amplification rate
that ranged from 3% to 13% among the Legume genera,
whereas for species within the genus, the level of transferability was up to 65%. As for the Medicago genus, a
rate of 81% of the SSR markers tested was found to be
transferable among M. sativa and M. truncatula [22].
Within the Vigna genus, [23] reported levels of SSR
transferability that reached 90% among V. umbellate
and V. angularis, whereas for the species V. mungo, V.
radiata and V. aconitifolia, the amplification decreased
to rates of 67% and 73%. In our study, the transferability
of SSR markers between P. vulgaris and G. max was
10%, whereas most of the transferred markers (70%)
were EST-SSRs. Because these two species are considered the most important cultivated legume in the world
with a wide volume of available genetic linkage map
information, the transferability of EST-SSRs may prove
very useful for studies involving comparative genomics
because of ability for information exchange.
Although the conserved nature of EST-SSRs facilitated
transferability, these markers are considered less polymorphic than other sources of SSRs. In the current
study, the level of polymorphism of the EST-SSRs (0.47)
was slightly lower than that of SSRs derived from genomic libraries (0.53), with a mean number of three and
four alleles, respectively. Similar results were found by
[15] who obtained a PIC value of 0.44 and an average
number of 2.7 alleles for EST-SSRs and a PIC value of

Page 9 of 14

0.45 and an average number of 2.4 alleles per locus for
genomic markers. High levels of polymorphism for
genomic and EST-SSRs have been reported, where these
markers were associated with an average number of 6
and 9.2 alleles per primer pair, respectively [28]. In the
present study, 34 of the 167 loci were previously characterized using a more diverse set of sampled individuals,
including accessions from Andean and Mesoamerican
gene pools [14,28], to determine genetic diversity. The
average PIC values, which reflect the allelic diversity and
frequencies among the sampled individuals, observed for
these markers were higher (0.70) than those found in
the present work (0.50); these data provides strong evidence that the number and genetic relationship of the
individuals used to access SSR genetic information
could influence the estimates obtained. The correlation
between PIC values and the index of transferability of
the SSR markers was not observed. The loci that
showed a greater rate of transferability were identified
as monomorphic or had low PIC values. These findings
are consistent with the theory that conserved genomic
sequences are less variable.
Despite the reduced level of polymorphism rates found
for the EST-SSRs, these markers were very useful for the
genetic mapping of the BJ population, helping to increase
the map coverage in the Phaseolus genome. Across the
entire set of EST-SSRs tested for polymorphism in
BAT93 and JALO EEP558, 24% segregated and were integrated into the BJ framework. Previous data indicated
that genomic SSRs were almost two-fold more polymorphic than the EST-SSRs [29]. In a similar study, also
using the BJ population, the polymorphism level of the
EST-SSRs was significantly higher (51%) than the ESTSSR markers developed in our study [13]. The level of
polymorphism of the EST-SSR markers could be attributed to the length and the number of repeat units and the
SSR position inside the transcribed sequence. There is
currently a great volume of genetic information derived
from genome sequencing, high coverage genetic maps,
BAC libraries and physical maps [42]. This increase in
genetic information has allowed for a better understanding and has provided new insights into the elucidation of
mechanisms involved in the expression of target traits
and the transfer of knowledge from one species to
another. Comparative genomics to assess synteny can
facilitate the reciprocal use of genomics resources
between different legume species, making the research
cost-effective, efficient and useful for crop breeding [43].
Regarding the segregation distortion, 12 markers
(15.9%) out of the 72 polymorphic EST-SSRs showed a
significant deviation from the expected Mendelian segregation as shown by the FDR analysis (p < 0.05). The
nature of the EST-SSRs could explain the high level of
segregation distortion found in our study. A more

Garcia et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/41

extreme deviation in coding regions is expected because
they are more susceptible to evolutionary pressures than
non-coding regions. These markers were preferentially
mapped on chromosomes 1 and 7 with a clear distinction between the markers that showed segregation distortions towards BAT93 or Jalo EEP558. The markers
that were skewed towards the parent BAT93 were
mapped on chromosome 7, whereas the markers that
were skewed towards Jalo EEP558 were mapped on
chromosome 1. The same pattern was observed in two
previous studies using the same BJ mapping population
[29,44]. The genes related to the domestication syndrome were mapped on chromosome 2 in two different
studies [45,46]. This result establishes the hypothesis
that the segregation distortion may have a biological
basis on these chromosomes, and the parents, BAT93
and Jalo EEP558, may have suffered preferential selection on the specific regions of chromosomes 1 and 7
that resulted in the observed segregation distortion [47].
In our study, all markers were placed into 14 linkage
groups, which exceeded the number of common bean
chromosomes by three (n = 11). An increase in the
number of markers and population size, which is currently formed by 76 individuals, would allow these three
small linkage groups to integrate into their respective
chromosomes. The total SSR map length (1,156.2 cM)
was consistent with previously developed maps. Freyre
et al. 1998 [44] reported a total map distance of 1,226
cM using the same BJ mapping population, and [48]
reported a map size of 1,401 cM using a mapping population derived from the parents “Carioca” and “Guanajuato 31”. However, an increase of almost 50% was
observed in the SSR map length when compared to the
SSR based map developed by [29] (606.8 cM). Because
the sample size and mapping generation were the same,
this variation in the estimation of the genome size can
obviously be attributed to the higher marker density of
the current map. In addition, [33] suggests that the
EST-SSR-based linkage maps are expected to be larger
than those based solely on anonymous SSRs because the
recombination event may be more frequent in gene-rich
regions than in non-coding regions. The genomic distribution of EST-SSR markers in this study was random
and quite similar to the genomic SSR markers, providing
a good coverage of all linkage groups.
A total of 207 SSR markers have been mapped on the
BJ population to date, including 15 mapped by [12], 22
by [13], 94 by [29] and a new set of 76 SSRs in the present study, of which 74 were EST-derived markers. An
additional effort was made in the last two years by
Embrapa Rice and Beans to increase and make available
the number of RILs derived form BJ population, which
presently has 75 individuals [26], to achieve higher precision in the clustering and order analysis. In addition,

Page 10 of 14

the number of mapped markers tends to rapidly
increase due to the continuously growing number of
EST sequences that are becoming available for the common bean on public databases; this increased availability
will contribute to the development of more EST-SSRbased markers and to the construction of more informative linkage maps. EST-SSR markers have the potential
to greatly increase the degree of information provided
by linkage maps because they can be readily associated
with genes of known or putative functions, allowing for
the direct association of markers in the map with quantitative traits of interest. Our results show that more
than half (57.9%) of the EST-SSRs sequences were associated with sequences of putative genes in the GenBank,
demonstrating the potential of these markers to be used
for the genomic exploitation of the common bean. In
addition, we demonstrated that EST-SSRs can be easily
transferable among the Legume genus with levels of
genetic information content comparable to those of
genomic SSRs, which will contribute to expand their use
in genetic analyses of Phaseolus vulgaris.

Conclusions
A set of 377 EST-SSR markers were developed, from
which 302 that showed good amplification quality are
available for genetic analysis of Phaseolus vulgaris.
These markers showed high rates of transferability, making them suitable for use in other economically important legume species. In addition, their genetic diversity
was comparable with genomic SSRs, showing that they
can be used in the genetic characterization of the common bean and related species. Finally, the newly developed EST-SSRs were incorporated into the BJ reference
map, bringing a great contribution to the genetic dissection of Phaseolus vulgaris.
Methods
Data mining for EST sequences containing SSRs

The EST sequences were obtained from the “Phaseolus
vulgaris EST Project site” (http://www.ccg.unam.mx/phaseolusest/), where a combined set of ESTs [49,50] was
assembled [51] and made available. A standard PC (Intel
P4 2 GHz processor, 512 KB cache, 512 MB RAM memory, 40 GB IDE hard disk) was used to process the data.
The sequences were processed according to the methodology described in [52]. This method involved a search for
SSRs using the TROLL [53] module with the Staden Package [54], followed by the use of a program that works with
Primer3 [55] to design primers flanking the SSRs that
were identified by the module. The TROLL module was
configured to find SSRs of mono-, di-, tri- tetra-, and pentanucleotides with lengths of at least six bases.
The list of SSRs produced by the TROLL module was
used as input in the Primer3 program, and a list of

Garcia et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/41

primer pairs for the amplification of the microsatellite
loci was returned. The following input parameters (e.g.,
GC content, TM, and primer length) for the Primer3
software were chosen to fine-tune the process and produce the best results: Product Size Range: 100-400; Max
3’ Stability: 250; Primer Size (Min, Opt, Max): 18, 22,
27; Primer Tm (Min, Opt, Max): 45, 60, 68; Max Tm
Difference: 1; Primer GC% (Min, Opt, Max): 30, 80;
Max Self Complementarity: 6; Max 3’ Self Complementarity: 3; Max #N’s: 0; Max Poly-X: 4. The other parameters were set at their default values. The program
ensures that groups consisting of adjacent SSRs are
flanked by only one primer pair, thus accounting for
non-exact repeats.
A total of 377 primers were synthesized and used in
the genetic analysis. The denomination “EST” was
added to the primers’ nomenclature to indicate their
origin. They were selected based on the presence of perfect and compound motifs containing hexa-, tetra-, tri-,
di- and mononucleotide repeats, with a minimum of 36,
49, 18, 12 and 11 repeat lengths, respectively.
DNA extraction and PCR conditions

Total DNA from the plant materials was extracted from
fresh young leaves following the procedure described by
[56]. The whole set of markers was initially tested using
the same amplification conditions and carried out in a
final volume of 15 μl, containing 15 ng of DNA, 0.3 μM
of each primer (Forward and Reverse), 0.25 mM of each
dNTP, 5% DMSO, 10 μM of Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM
of KCl, 1.5 mM of MgCl 2 and one unit of Taq DNA
polymerase. The reactions were amplified in a GeneAmp
9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems), programmed
for one pre-cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles at 94°C for 1 min, the specific annealing temperature of the primer for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and a
final step at 72°C for 7 min. Electrophoresis was conducted with silver stained 6% denaturing polyacrylamide
gels [57].
SSR marker analysis

The 377 primers were screened for amplification quality
using the 6 genotypes of P. vulgaris available at Embrapa
Rice and Beans. Four of these genotypes were parents of
two mapping populations: BAT93 X Jalo EEP558 and
CNFM7875 X “Laranja”. From the primers that showed
scorable amplification, those that also produced specific
amplification products and amplified consistently across
individuals were selected to be used in the transferability
analysis and genetic characterization of SSRs. The
annealing temperature was adjusted individually for
each primer pair.
The set of 107 SSR markers (102 genomic and five
EST-derived markers) that were previously developed

Page 11 of 14

[2,14,38] were also used in the transferability analysis
and genetic characterization of SSRs. These markers
reportedly produced specific and robust amplification
products when characterized by [29].
An additional set of 44 newly developed SSR markers
were tested for amplification quality and polymorphism
between the parents of the two mapping populations.
These markers were derived from the enriched genomic
libraries according to the procedure described by [14]
and were used only in the linkage analysis.
Cross-amplification of EST derived and genomic SSR
markers

A total of 167 SSRs that generated clear and specific
bands, of which 102 were previously published and 65
were newly synthesized EST-SSRs, were selected for the
transferability analysis. The selected set of SSRs were
screened for transferability across 11 species, representing
four important tribes and one subfamily of the Leguminosae. Two genotypes were taken from each of the species
P. vulgaris, Medicago sativa, P. lunatus, P. coccineus,
P. acutifolius, Vigna mungo, Vigna angularis, Vigna unguiculata, G. max, Arachis hypogaea, which is from the
Papilionoideae subfamily, and Dipteryx alata, which is a
more distantly related species from the Mimosoideae subfamily. PCR was conducted using the conditions described
above, and a cross-amplification that produced clear and
specific bands, as visualized on polyacrylamide gels, was
considered successful. Allele sizes were estimated by comparison with a 10 bp molecular weight ladder.
SSR genetic characterization

The entire set of 167 SSR markers that were used for the
cross-amplification analysis were characterized for the
polymorphic information content (PIC) number of alleles,
observed heterozygosity (Ho) and gene diversity using
PowerMarker [58]. The analysis was assessed in 16 common bean genotypes representing six different and commercially relevant grain classes, representative of the
Mesoamerican gene pool (genotypes with small seeds),
which included one accession of each of the grain types
“Carioca - Carioca bean”, “Roxo - Pink bean”, and “Rajado
- Pinto bean”, eight of the “Preto - Black bean”, and the
Andean (genotypes with medium and large size seeds)
represented by two accessions of “Branco - White bean”
and three accessions of “Mulatinho/Jalo - Jalo bean”.
Linkage analysis in the BAT93 × Jalo EEP558 population

A total of 315 SSR markers that were not previously
mapped in the common bean and produced scorable PCR
products (302 new EST-SSR and 13 new genomic SSR
markers) were used to screen for polymorphism between
the parental lines BAT93 and Jalo EEP558 (BJ). The polymorphic markers were genotyped in a progeny consisting

Garcia et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:41
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/41

of 74 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) in the F8 generation.
An entire set of new segregant markers was integrated into
a framework map composed of 123 SSR markers previously mapped in the BJ population [29]. The Chi-square
test (c2) was performed to test for deviations of genotypic
classes from the expected Mendelian inheritance ratios of
1:1 (p < 0.05) for each marker. The False Discovery Rate
(FDR) was determined for the c2 tests from the observed
p-value distribution and used to correct for multiple comparisons by controlling the probability of false positives
[59]. The polymorphic SSR markers were integrated in the
framework map through a linkage analysis performed
using Mapdisto version 1.7b (http://mapdisto.free.fr/).
Linked markers were first placed into linkage groups using
the “find group” command with a LOD score ranging from
3.0 to 5.0 and a maximum recombination fraction (theta)
of 0.30. The recombination fractions were converted into
map distances using the Kosambi mapping function. The
“order sequence” command was used to identify the most
probable marker order within a linkage group, and the
“ripple” command was used to return the best order.
Putative function of mapped EST-SSRs

The functions of the EST sequences containing SSRs
that were polymorphic between the parental lines
BAT93 and Jalo EEP558 were predicted through similarity searches from GenBank databases (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) using the BLASTX algorithms. The
greater E-value was considered to assign a putative function to the EST-SSR markers.
