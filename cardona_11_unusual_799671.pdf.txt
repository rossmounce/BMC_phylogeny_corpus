Abstract
Background: Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in
the absence of HBsAg in the serum of patients. The aim of this study was to characterize HBV infection among a
Piaroa community, an Amerindian group which exhibits significant evidence of exposure to HBV but relatively low
presence of HBsAg, and to explore the presence of OBI in this population.
Results: Of 150 sera, with 17% anti-HBc and 1.3% HBsAg prevalence, 70 were tested for the presence of HBV DNA.
From these, 25 (36%) were found positive for HBV DNA by PCR in the core region. Two of these 25 sera were
HBsAg positive, indicating an overt infection. Of the remaining 68 sera tested, 23 exhibited OBI. Of these, 13 were
HBV DNA out of 25 anti-HBc positive (52%) and 10 HBV DNA positive, out of 43 anti-HBc negative (23%), with a
statistical significance of p = 0.03. Viral DNA and HBsAg were present intermittently in follow up sera of 13
individuals. Sequence analysis in the core region of the amplified DNA products showed that all the strains
belonged to HBV genotype F3. The OBI isolates displayed 96-100% nucleotide identity between them. One isolate
exhibited the co-circulation of a wild type variant with a variant with a premature stop codon at the core protein,
and a variant exhibiting a deletion of 28 amino acids.
Conclusions: The frequency of OBI found in this Amerindian group warrants further studies in other communities
exhibiting different degrees of HBV exposure.
Keywords: Hepatitis B virus, Occult infection, Amerindians

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant health
concern among Amerindians in the Americas with high
exposure being documented in several Amerindian
groups [1]. However, the prevalence of active HBV
infection, defined as positivity for HBV surface antigen
(HBsAg) is variable among different Amerindian communities, coexisting in the same geographic environment [2]. In a recent study in the Venezuelan Amazon,
anti-HBc prevalence ranged from 17 to 70% [2].
Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is characterized by the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in

the absence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) [3,4]. OBI
can lead to severe chronic manifestations including
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [5,6]. OBI has not been
studied thoroughly in Amerindian populations and
could be present in Amerindian populations exhibiting
evidence of exposure to HBV without high prevalence
of active infection. Indeed, OBI has been already
described in Mexican Amerindians [7]. The aim of this
study was to characterize HBV infection among a Piaroa
community, an Amerindian group which exhibits significant evidence of exposure to HBV but relatively low
presence of HBsAg [2], and to explore the presence of
OBI in this population.

Results
A total of 150 sera from the Piaroa community Babilla
de Pintao were analyzed (Figure 1). Total anticore antibodies (anti-HBc) prevalence was 17% (26/150) in this
group and 31% (25/80) in individuals over 15 years of

age [2]. Only 2 sera (1.3%) were positive for HBsAg [2].
These 2 sera were negative for anti-HBc antibodies. A
subset of 70 sera was analyzed for the presence of HBV
DNA. Of these, 25 (36%) were positive for HBV DNA
by PCR in the core region (Figure 1). All individuals

showed normal ALT levels. The 2 HBsAg sera were
positive for HBV DNA. Of the remaining 23 sera, 13
were anti-HBc positive, and 10 were both anti-HBc and
HBsAg negative. Among the HBsAg negative sera, 52%
of the anti-HBc positive and 23% of the anti-HBc negative sera were HBV DNA positive, this difference being
statistically significant (p = 0.03). HBV DNA was found
even more frequently among anti-HBs positive individuals compared to anti-HBs negative ones (p = 0.01)
(Figure 1). No difference was observed in the prevalence
of OBI according to sex (9/25 of females and 16/41 of
males had HBV DNA in their sera, p = 0.99), or to age
(9/30 younger than 30 years vs. 12/25 older, p = 0.26).
Follow up sera were available for 13 individuals positive for HBV DNA. Viral DNA and HBsAg were present
intermittently, as shown in Table 1. The two individuals
presenting with an overt HBV infection at the beginning
of the study, developed OBI later, since they carried
HBV DNA in their sera for more than 2 years without
the presence of HBsAg. The HBV genomic region that
could readily be amplified was the core region, while the

S region could be amplified only in some sera (Table 1).
From the sera collected from vaccinated subjects in
2009, 34/36 showed levels of anti-HBs antibodies higher
than 10 mIU/ml.
Sequence analysis in the core region of the DNA
amplified products showed that all the strains belonged
to HBV genotype F3 (Figure 2). The OBI isolates displayed 96-100% nucleotide identity between them. The
isolates were also closely related to sequences from
HBV isolates circulating among other Piaroa, Yanomami
and Yucpa Amerindians exhibiting overt infections and
analyzed in previous studies [8]. One isolate, BP21,
exhibited co-circulation of a wild type virus along with a
variant harboring a premature stop codon at aa 42 of
the core protein, and a variant exhibiting a deletion of
28 aas (aa 78-105) (Figure 3). A partial S genomic
sequence was also available for 8 specimens. The
sequences in the S region indicate the presence of HBV
genotype F3, subtype adw4, although the length of the
genomic region analyzed did not permit firm subgenotyping. Mutations associated with escape from antibody

neutralization were not observed (data not shown). All
the OBI strains were genetically related (Figure 2). Interestingly, 19/25 specimens of OBI shared at least one
parent exhibiting OBI.

Discussion
HBV DNA was analyzed in an Amerindian population
exhibiting moderate prevalence of infection (17% anti-

HBc), compared to other Venezuelan Amerindian populations, such as that of the Yanomami (58% anti-HBc).
As described previously, this community showed a
lower rate of acquisition of anti-HBc antibodies (1.4% in
individuals less than 15 years old), compared to the
Yanomami for example (38% in individuals less than 15
years old) [2]. The lower prevalence of HBV exposure
and infection in this Amerindian community may be

due to its geographic location, since being located near
the main urban centre of the state, it is closer to health
services. In addition, a more frequent contact with other
civilizations may have modified some socio-cultural
practices, leading to a reduction in HBV transmission,
together with more effective accomplishment of vaccination programs. Despite the lower rate of HBV acquisition, this community still exhibited a 17% prevalence of
anti-HBc antibodies, with a low prevalence of HBsAg
positivity. OBI was shown in this Piaroa population,
both in individuals with HBV serological markers and,
with less frequency, in individuals with silent exposure
to infection. Follow-up analysis in 15 individuals confirmed the presence of OBI, since HBV DNA could be
detected in an intermittent form. The frequency of OBI
in this community is higher than that found previously
in blood donors from Caracas (4.3%) [9], and in Mexican and North American Amerindians (14.2% and 9.7%
respectively) [7,10], although the methods used to determine OBI are somehow different between these reports.
OBI is common among immunosuppressed individuals,
due either to HIV [11,12], or to other causes [13]. It is
important to note that Amerindians may be immunologically compromised due to multiple parasitic and

bacterial infections, to add to the high prevalence of
HBV exposure [14]. As expected, the prevalence of OBI
infection was also higher when HBV serological markers
of previous exposure (anti-HBc and/or anti-anti-HBs)
were present. In addition, this Piaroa population exhibited a good response to vaccination as evidenced by the
high frequency of seroconversion observed in 2009, after
vaccination.
As anticipated, phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of the HBV genotype F3, and no particular strain
was shown to be associated with OBI pattern, since the
isolates were closely related to HBV isolates circulating
in other Piaroa and Yanomami Venezuelan individuals
[8]. In a previous study of Venezuelan blood donors,
OBI was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of genotypes A and D (70%), while genotype F
was predominant in overt cases (76%) [9]. The present
study shows that OBI can also be very frequent among
individuals exclusively exposed to HBV genotype F. OBI
has been described recently in Nahuas and Huichol
native populations from Mexico, and HBV genotype H
was found in several cases [7]. Three studies have
reported a predominance of genotype A and particularly
D in cases of OBI [15-17], while in other studies,

Cardona et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:527
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/527

Page 6 of 7

genotype A was present at a similar prevalence in overt
and OBI infections [18]. Altogether, these studies suggest that OBI appears not to be restricted to a particular
genotype. In our study, one subject was infected by a
wild type virus with variants coding for core defective
proteins, a situation already described in Venezuelan
blood donors with OBI [9]. Most of the subjects with
OBI were related, suggesting than familiar transmission
might have played a role in this situation. However, the
number of samples analyzed and the short genomic
sequence available for study did not allow testing of this
hypothesis.
There is accumulating evidence of a pathogenic role
for OBI [19]. OBI may contribute to the progression of
liver fibrosis and HCC development [20], thus the
potential benefits of antiviral treatment is in debate
[6,21]. As shown in this study and in others, vaccination
of those populations at risk for OBI should be undertaken as it may bring some benefits to these communities
[22].

PCR and sequencing

Conclusions
A high frequency of unusual HBV presentation was
found in this Piaroa population. All the individuals were
infected with HBV genotype F3. The OBI isolates displayed a restrained variability and were similar to the
isolates causing overt HBV infection in other Venezuelan Amerindian groups. The frequency of OBI found in
this Piaroa population warrants further studies in other
Amerindian communities exhibiting different degrees of
HBV exposure.

Statistical analysis

Methods
Population group

The Piaroa community of Babilla de Pintao (Amazon
State, Venezuela) consists of 169 inhabitants, and 150
sera were analyzed for the presence of HBV serological
markers, with informed consent and under approval of
Bioethical Committees of CAICET and IVIC [2]. Individuals were also vaccinated during this period. Testing
was performed between 2002 and 2004, and a subset of
sera (n = 36) were collected in 2009 to evaluate antiHBs antibodies.
Serological assays

Sera were tested for HBV markers with commercial
assays: HBcAb DIMA™ (DIMA Diagnostika C.A., Venezuela), Murex HBsAg Version 3 (ABBOTT, Murex Biotech Limited, UK), Bioelisa anti-HBs (Biokit, S.A., Spain)
and IgM anti-HBc by ETI-CORE-IGMK-2 (DiaSorin
Ltda., Italy). A sample was considered anti-HBs positive
if the levels of anti-HBs antibodies were higher than 10
UI/ml. ALT were also determined with a commercial
assay (Wiener Lab, Argentina).

A total of 70 sera (2 HBsAg positive, 25 anti-HBc positive and 43 remaining randomly selected) were analyzed
by nested PCR of the core region [9]. A sample was
considered positive if it repeated positive after a second
extraction of viral DNA. When enough serum was available, samples were also amplified by nested PCR in the
S region [8]. Purified PCR fragments were sent to
CESAAN (Centro de Secuenciación y Análisis de Acidos
Nucleicos, IVIC, Caracas, Venezuela), for sequencing.
Sequences obtained from the Venezuelan isolates were
compared with different reference strains from GenBank
and used for phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignment
and phylogenetic analysis by the Neighbor Joining
method (1,000 bootstrap replicas, genetic distances evaluated with Kimura 2 parameters corrections) were conducted using DNAMAN 5.2.2 (Lynnon Bio Soft,
Canada). Nucleotide sequence data have been deposited
in GenBank database under the accession numbers
JN255220-JN255243.

Statistical differences were evaluated by the Chi-Squares
test with Yates correction, according to a computerized
Epi Info program, version 3.3.2 (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA).
