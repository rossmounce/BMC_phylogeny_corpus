Abstract
Background: The efficient conversion of ammonia, a potent neurotoxin, into non-toxic
metabolites was an essential adaptation that allowed animals to move from the aquatic to terrestrial
biosphere. The urea cycle converts ammonia into urea in mammals, amphibians, turtles, snails,
worms and many aquatic animals and requires N-acetylglutamate (NAG), an essential allosteric
activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase I (CPSI) in mammals and amphibians, and
carbamylphosphate synthetase III (CPSIII) in fish and invertebrates. NAG-dependent CPSI and
CPSIII catalyze the formation of carbamylphosphate in the first and rate limiting step of ureagenesis.
NAG is produced enzymatically by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), which is also found in
bacteria and plants as the first enzyme of arginine biosynthesis. Arginine is an allosteric inhibitor of
microbial and plant NAGS, and allosteric activator of mammalian NAGS.
Results: Information from mutagenesis studies of E. coli and P. aeruginosa NAGS was combined
with structural information from the related bacterial N-acetylglutamate kinases to identify four
residues in mammalian NAGS that interact with arginine. Substitutions of these four residues were
engineered in mouse NAGS and into the vertebrate-like N-acetylglutamate synthase-kinase
(NAGS-K) of Xanthomonas campestris, which is inhibited by arginine. All mutations resulted in
arginine losing the ability to activate mouse NAGS, and inhibit X. campestris NAGS-K. To examine
at what point in evolution inversion of arginine effect on NAGS occur, we cloned NAGS from fish
and frogs and examined the arginine response of their corresponding proteins. Fish NAGS were
partially inhibited by arginine and frog NAGS were activated by arginine.
Conclusion: Difference in arginine effect on bacterial and mammalian NAGS most likely stems
from the difference in the type of conformational change triggered by arginine binding to these
proteins. The change from arginine inhibition of NAGS to activation was gradual, from complete
inhibition of bacterial NAGS, to partial inhibition of fish NAGS, to activation of frog and mammalian
NAGS. This change also coincided with the conquest of land by amphibians and mammals.

Background
The efficient incorporation of ammonia nitrogen into
compounds that can be easily excreted was essential for
animals to move from the aquatic biosphere to land [1,2].
Ammonia is a waste product of nitrogen metabolism and
a potent neurotoxin. In mammals, blood ammonia levels
are maintained in the low micromolar range (< 50 μM), as
compared to other metabolites, such as lactate or ketone
bodies, that are tolerated in concentrations that are orders
of magnitude higher (1–2 mM) [3]. The threshold of tolerance for elevated blood ammonia levels is very low and
concentrations above 100 μM can cause signs of brain
dysfunction, and even higher levels can lead to coma and
death [3]. Therefore, the main function of ammonia disposal systems in animals is to protect their central nervous
systems from the harmful effects of ammonia [3,4]. The
direct excretion of ammonia, which at physiological pH is
predominantly in the form of the ammonium ion,
requires large quantities of water. Aquatic animals can
excrete ammonia directly into their environment due to
the large concentration gradient of ammonia between
their plasma and surrounding water [2]. However, the
efficient disposal of ammonia in a manner that does not
require as much water was essential for life on land and
adaptation of aquatic animals to the terrestrial biosphere
[5]. Effective ammonia disposal is also essential for life in
extreme aquatic environments such as high pH [6,7], or
upon occasional exposure to air during drought [8-11]
and low tides [12,13]. Two metabolic pathways, the urea
cycle and urate pathway function in the liver to efficiently
convert ammonia into urea and uric acid, which are nontoxic and easily excreted [14]. Based on the type of predominant nitrogen waste product, ammonia, urea or
urate, animals have been classified as ammonotelic, ureotelic and uricotelic [15]. However, this division is not
strict because many animals, such as snails, turtles and
fish, excrete more than one nitrogen waste product, and
the preference for specific nitrogen waste products
changes as the environment of the animal changes [811,16-24]. In mammals, amphibians, gastropods and
some turtles ammonia is detoxified through ureagenesis
(Figure 1) [3,14,16-18,20,25-33], while lizards, snakes,
birds, insects and terrestrial crustaceans use uric acid to
eliminate nitrogen waste [34-36]. Many aquatic animals
that are capable of ureagenesis do not use urea as the
major nitrogen waste product [12,13,21,29,37-43]. In
sharks, skates and rays, urea functions as an osmolyte
[38,44-50] but its function in bony fishes is not well
understood [2,39,51,52].
The first reaction of urea cycle is formation of carbamylphosphate (CP, Figure 1). In tetrapods, carbamylphosphate synthetase I (CPSI, EC 6.3.4.16) produces CP from
ammonia, bicarbonate and ATP [3]. In fish and invertebrates, the formation of CP is catalyzed by carbamylphos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/24

phate synthetase III (CPSIII; EC 6.3.3.5), which uses
glutamine, bicarbonate and ATP as substrates [53]. Nacetylglutamate (NAG), which is formed enzymatically by
N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS; EC 2.3.1.1) from
glutamate and acetyl coenzyme A (Figure 1), is an essential allosteric activator of CPSI, and deficiency of NAG
results in a block in ureagenesis [4,54]. NAG also activates
CPSIII, but the effect of NAG on the enzymatic activity of
CPSIII is more complex. At high glutamine concentrations, CPSIII is active even in the absence of NAG, while
at low glutamine concentrations, CPSIII requires NAG for
activity [41,44,55]. Some fish CPSIII have been shown to
also be capable of using ammonia as substrate, and in
these enzymes, NAG is required for the formation of CP
from ammonia, bicarbonate and ATP [41,44,55].
Sequence comparisons and mutagenesis studies suggest
that CPSI evolved from CPSIII as a consequence of losing
the ability to bind glutamine [56,57].
The urea cycle and the microbial arginine biosynthesis
pathway have six enzymes and intermediates in common,
leading to the hypothesis that the urea cycle evolved from
the arginine biosynthesis pathway [4,58]. Indeed,
sequences of all six enzymes of the urea cycle are similar
across phyla [59-62]. However, among these enzymes,
NAGS is the most diverse [63]. Phylogenetic analysis of
NAGS proteins indicated that they belong to two distinct
families. Bacterial and plant NAGS with sequences similar
to Escherichia coli NAGS are in one family, while the
bifunctional N-acetylglutamate synthase and kinase
(NAGS-K) from Xanthomonas campestris, together with
putative NAGS-K from several orders of gamma- and
alpha-proteobacteria, vertebrate and fungal NAGS, and
fungal N-acetylglutamate kinase belong to a family of vertebrate-like NAGS [62]. Sequence and structural alignments of vertebrate-like NAGS sequences reveal four
regions in these proteins. At the N-terminus of eukaryotic
NAGS is a mitochondrial targeting sequence [64]. Following it is a variable segment, a sequence that is poorly conserved in vertebrate NAGS [65]. The remainder of the
protein ("conserved segment") is conserved in vertebrates,
fungi and bacteria and it consists of N-terminal kinase and
C-terminal acetyltransferase domains [62,66]. The threedimensional structure of NAGS as well as mutations in
patients with NAGS deficiency indicate that the active site
of the NAGS is localized in the acetyltransferase domain
[54,66], while mutagenesis studies in NAGS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is similar to E. coli NAGS, indicate that the arginine binding site is localized in the kinase
domain [67]. Microbial and plant NAGS are inhibited by
arginine, as part of feedback regulation of arginine biosynthesis [58]. Mammalian NAGS is activated by arginine
[68-71].

Urea cycle in tetrapods, fish and invertebrates
Urea cycle in tetrapods, fish and invertebrates. The first three enzymes of the urea cycle are localized in the mitochondria; the remaining three enzymes are cytoplasmic. Mammals and amphibians (tetrapods) have CPSI, which catalyzes the formation of CP from ammonia, bicarbonate and ATP. NAG is an essential allosteric activator of CPSI. CPSIII catalyzes the formation
of CP from glutamine, bicarbonate and ATP in fish and invertebrates. The enzymatic activity of CPSIII increases in the presence
of NAG. Abbreviations: NAGS – N-acetylglutamate synthase; NAG – N-acetylglutamate; CPSI – carbamylphosphate synthetase
I; CPSIII – carbamylphosphate synthetase III; OTC – ornithine transcarbamylase; ASS – argininosuccinate synthase; ASL –
argininosuccinate lyase.

The goals of this study were to examine if differences in
arginine binding could explain inversion of the allosteric
effect of arginine on NAGS, and determine when during
evolution this inversion occurred. The results presented
herein imply that binding of arginine to a site conserved
in all vertebrate-like NAGS (bacterial and mammalian)
induces conformational changes, which exert an opposite
effect on enzymatic activity of bacterial and mammalian
NAGS. Furthermore, the results show that the allosteric
inversion of the effect of arginine occurred during evolution of amphibians and coincided with the conquest of
land by ureotelic tetrapods.

Results
Arginine Binding Site is Conserved in Mammalian and
Bacterial NAGS
We identified amino acids responsible for binding of
arginine to vertebrate-like NAGS based on the information from three dimensional structure of Thermotoga maritima N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK) protein liganded
with L-arginine [72] and mutagenesis studies in NAGS
from P. aeruginosa and E. coli [67,73]. Figure 2 shows an
alignment of NAGS proteins from 25 species of bacteria,
plants and vertebrates. Nine amino acids are invariant in
NAGS, eight of them are located in the kinase domain of

Conservation of amino acid sequences of NAGS from 25 organisms
Conservation of amino acid sequences of NAGS from 25 organisms. The sizes of letters indicate the degree of conservation. Residues that are important for arginine binding are highlighted in yellow. Invariant residues are shown in blue.
Asterisks indicate invariant residues that are mutated in arginine-insensitive NAGS from E. coli. Arrows indicate conserved

NAGS and also conserved in T. maritima NAGK [62] (Figure 2). Four of the invariant residues are important for
arginine binding; the corresponding residues of T. maritima NAGK are in direct contact with arginine [72]. In
addition to the four invariant residues, two more amino
acids in the region corresponding to the N-helix of T. maritima NAGK [72] are important for arginine binding;
large, aromatic residues are found in both positions in all
NAGS that were examined in this study. The four conserved residues important for arginine binding were also
found previously by our group to be mutated in arginine
insensitive NAGS from E. coli [73]; they are labeled with
asterisks in Figure 2. When three of the residues important
for binding of arginine were replaced with alanine in
NAGS from P. aeruginosa, an E. coli-like enzyme, it also
became insensitive to inhibition by arginine [67]. Figure
2 also shows four amino acids (arrows), which are conserved in NAGS and arginine-inhibited T. maritima
NAGK, and replaced by other residues or absent in E. coli
NAGK, which is not subject to arginine inhibition [74].
We engineered four amino acid substitutions in the
mouse NAGS (mNAGS) and in the vertebrate-like NAGSK from Xanthomonas campestris (XcNAGS-K). The E354A
and G360P amino acid substitutions in mNAGS, and
E280A and G286P replacements in XcNAGS-K were chosen based on the corresponding sequence changes in E.
coli NAGK, which is not inhibited by arginine [74]. The
G362S and F121C amino acid replacements in mNAGS
and the corresponding G288S and F35C mutations in
XcNAGS-K were among arginine resistant mutants of E.
coli NAGS [73]. After site directed mutagenesis, four
mutant and wild-type mNAGS proteins, as well as mutant
and wild-type XcNAGS-K were overexpressed in E. coli and
purified using nickel-affinity chromatography. Figure 3

Table 1 shows that in mouse NAGS, all four mutations
abolish arginine activation. The G362S mutant had lower
specific activity than wild-type NAGS, possibly due to an
additional effect of the replacement of a small glycine residue with bulky, polar serine on protein function and/or
stability. In the mutant XcNAGS-K enzymes, the effect of
arginine was tested on both the synthase and kinase activities. The synthase activity of all four mutant XcNAGS-K
proteins was lower than the specific activity of wild-type
enzyme (Table 2). The E280A mutation completely abolished inhibition of XcNAGS-K synthase and kinase activities by arginine, while both enzymatic activities of the
F35C mutant XcNAGS-K were only partially inhibited by
1 mM arginine. The synthase activities of the G286P and
G288S mutants were not inhibited by arginine, and the
kinase activity of these two XcNAGS-K mutants decreased
in the presence of arginine by 33% and 25%, respectively.
It is possible that G286P and G288S mutations severely
diminish, but not abolish, arginine binding to XcNAGS-K.
Therefore, in these two mutants, arginine may not be able
to affect the remote synthase catalytic site, but could still
have a weak effect on the kinase active site, which is in
close proximity to the arginine binding site [66,72]. These
results document elimination of arginine effect, caused by
the same mutations in both arginine activated and
arginine inhibited NAGS, strongly suggesting that the
arginine binding sites in these proteins are conserved.
Thus, differences in the conformational dynamics of
arginine activated and arginine inhibited NAGS proteins

Survey of Urea Cycle Genes in Animals
Sequenced genomes of animals were surveyed for the
presence of all six urea cycle genes. Human urea cycle
genes were used as queries in BLAST searches of genomes
from chicken (Gallus gallus), African clawed frog (Xenopus
laevis), western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), zebrafish
(Danio rerio), pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), freshwater
pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purputratus), sea squirts (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona
savignyi), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
pseudoobscura), honeybee (Apis mellifera), mosquito
(Anopheles gambiae) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggasae). The presence of all six
urea cycle gene in a genome would indicate that organism's potential to synthesize urea from ammonia. Figure
4 shows the cladogram of Deuterostomes in which the
ureogenic ability of each organism is indicated, together
with the type of CPS in organisms that were previously
studied: a starfish (Coscinasterias calamaria), sea squirt
(Pyura stolonifera) and several species of fish
[6,8,10,11,13,21,37,38,40-43,51,55,75-79]. Urea cycle
genes, including NAGS, were identified in frogs, all three
teleost fish and sea urchin, an invertebrate. Although

homologs of four urea cycle genes (CPSI, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthase and argininosuccinate lyase) were previously identified in the chicken
[80,81]; sequences similar to human NAGS and arginase I
were absent from the chicken genome. This is consistent
either with absence of NAGS and arginase I genes from the
chicken genome, or presence of these two genes in the
regions of genomes that have not been fully assembled at
the time of our survey. Only argininosuccinate synthase
and argininosuccinate lyase were found in sea squirts (Figure 4 and Additional File 1); however, a different species
of sea squirt, P. stolonifera, has been reported to be able to
synthesize urea [13]. The results of the survey of the insect
and nematode genomes are listed in Additional File 1. Figure 4 also indicates that invertebrates and fish have
CPSIII, while tetrapods have CPSI, suggesting that the
transition from CPSIII to CPSI coincided with the conquest of land by tetrapods, as noted previously [53].
Effect of Arginine on Enzymatic Activity of NAGS from
Different Organisms
The enzymatic activity of mammalian NAGS increases in
the presence of arginine [68-71], while microbial and
plant NAGS are inhibited by arginine [4,58]. To examine
when the effect of arginine changed from inhibition to
activation, we cloned and purified NAGS from X. laevis, X.
tropicalis, zebrafish, pufferfish, an alpha-proteobacterium
M. maris and arabidopsis, and examined their activity in
the presence and absence of 1 mM arginine. Human and
mouse NAGS were used as controls for enzyme activation,
and E. coli NAGS and X. campestris NAGS-K were used as
controls for NAGS inhibition. Bacterial expression plasmids containing human, mouse, X. laevis, X. tropicalis,
zebrafish, pufferfish, X. campestris, M. maris, arabidopsis
and E. coli NAGS were transformed into E. coli cells, and
the corresponding recombinant proteins were overexpressed and purified using nickel-affinity chromatography. Figure 5 shows that each recombinant protein was
purified to apparent homogeneity.

ther inhibition of zebrafish and pufferfish NAGS (data not
shown). As expected, NAGS from Arabidopsis, M. maris,
X. campestris and E. coli were inhibited by 1 mM arginine.
Table 3 shows that NAGS from E. coli was partially inhibited by 1 mM arginine. It was reported previously that
NAGS from E. coli enzyme had 15% residual enzymatic
activity in the presence of 1 mM arginine [82]. The difference between this study and our results may be due to differences in assay conditions and enzyme preparation
(partially purified vs. recombinant enzyme). Inhibition of
X. campestris NAGS-K and E. coli NAGS by arginine, as well
as activation of mammalian NAGS by arginine, have been
shown previously [62,68,69,82,83]. These results indicate
that the inversion of the arginine effect on NAGS enzymatic activity occurred in amphibians and coincided with
the transition from CPSIII to CPSI and evolution of tetrapods.

Discussion
This study revealed that allosteric inversion of the arginine
effect on enzymatic activity of NAGS occurred in amphibians. This change in biochemical properties of NAGS coincided with the transition from CPSIII to CPSI and the
conquest of land by amphibians and mammals. We have
shown that mouse NAGS and bacterial XcNAGS-K, both
members of vertebrate-like NAGS family, share a common arginine binding site.
The arginine binding site is conserved in NAGS that are
inhibited, as well as in those activated by this allosteric
cofactor. We used mutagenesis to show that replacement
of these conserved amino acids with the corresponding
residues from E. coli NAGS and NAGK, which do not
respond to arginine [73,74], abolishes inhibition of
XcNAGS-K and activation of mouse NAGS by arginine.
Therefore, the switch from inhibition to activation of
NAGS by arginine resulted from the differences in the type
of conformational change or altered protein dynamics
induced by the binding of arginine.
This difference in type of conformational change may
have been the result of a single amino acid replacement,
similar to allosteric inversions of the ATP effect on the
enzymatic activity of aspartate transcarbamylase [84], and
effect of N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate on the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase [85]. However, it is
more likely that it involved multiple amino acid replacements because of the gradual transition from complete
inhibition of bacterial NAGS to partial inhibition of fish
NAGS to 204–0% activation of frog NAGS to doubling of
enzymatic activity of mouse NAGS. This may explain the
lower conservation of NAGS across phyla compared to
other urea cycle enzymes [59-62]. Inversion of the allosteric effect has been shown to be triggered by temperature
change in some enzymes, revealing the thermodynamic

BMC Biochemistry 2008, 9:24

factors that govern ligand binding and ensuing conformational change [86]. Examination of the temperature
dependence of the allosteric effect of arginine on NAGS
from different organisms could yield insights into the
nature of conformation change that results from arginine
binding. In addition to this, differences in the threedimensional structures of bacterial and mammalian
NAGS liganded with arginine will also reveal differences
in the mechanisms of allosteric inhibition and activation
of NAGS by arginine.
Eight of the ten NAGS proteins that were examined in this
study belong to the vertebrate-like family of NAGS [62],
and their response to arginine ranged from complete inhibition (X. campestris NAGS-K, M. maris NAGS) to partial
inhibition (zebrafish and pufferfish NAGS) to activation
(amphibian and mammalian NAGS) (Table 3). Our
sequence alignment of NAGS from 25 organisms revealed
only nine invariant amino acids (Figure 2). Five invariant
amino acids are part of the NAGS hydrophobic core, as
they are all buried in the interior of Nisseria gonorrhoeae
NAGS [66]. Four invariant amino acids are responsible for
arginine binding. They are also conserved in the structurally related NAGK from T. maritima [62] and play a functional role in binding of arginine to NAGS from P.
aeruginosa [67]. Interestingly, none of the NAGS residues
known to bind substrates or catalyze NAG formation [66]
are conserved among the analyzed proteins.
Our survey of sequenced animal genomes and literature
revealed that the ability to produce urea is widely spread
in the animal kingdom (Figure 4 and Additional File 1).
For example, we identified a full set of urea cycle genes in
the sea urchin (Figure 4), and previous reports indicate
that other invertebrates, such as flatworms, annelids, gastropods and bivalves, also have the ability to convert
ammonia into urea [12,13,16,17,20,24-33]. Other invertebrates, like nematodes and arthropods, do not use urea
cycle for nitrogen waste disposal [35] (Additional File 1).
We found homologs of argininosuccinate synthase and
argininosuccinate lyase and no other urea cycle genes in
the genomes of sea squirts C. intestinalis and C. savignyi,
suggesting that these two aquatic organisms lost their ability to produce urea. However, another sea squirt, P. stolonifera, can produce urea [13], which may be advantageous
for the survival of this organism when exposed to air during low tides. The capacity of many invertebrates to synthesize urea, and the absence of a complete set of urea
cycle genes in nematodes, arthropods, and some sea
squirts is consistent with the presence of a urea cycle in the
common ancestor of animals and the subsequent loss of
ability to synthesize urea in some phyla.
All six urea cycle genes were identified in the genomes of
zebrafish, pufferfish and freshwater pufferfish. There are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/24

several fish species for which the need for a urea cycle can
be explained. Lungfish are periodically exposed to air and
use the urea cycle to dispose of ammonia [8,9,11,79].
Elasmobranches use urea as osmolyte [38,45,47-50], and
alkaline lake tilapia lives in lakes containing high concentrations of ammonia [6,7]. However, the function of urea
cycle in zebrafish, pufferfish and other teleosts that are not
exposed to these types of extreme environments is not
clear. In these fish, the urea cycle may be important for
embryonic development as developing rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and
Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) all express
CPSIII, ornithine transcarbamylase and arginase I during
embryogenesis [37,40,41,43].
In amphibians, we identified all six urea cycle genes in the
genomes of African and western clawed frogs, X. laevis and
X. tropicalis (Figure 4 and Additional File 1). X. laevis is
mostly aquatic and ammonotelic, but can produce urea
upon prolonged exposure to air [87], while the type of
main nitrogenous waste for X. tropicalis is not known.
Other adult amphibians, such as bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and Chinese fire-belly newt (Cynops orientalis) are
ureotelic and they have CPSI, which uses ammonia as a
substrate [56,57,88-90]. The CPSIII of ureotelic Mexican
axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum, can use both glutamine
and ammonia as substrates, and the latter is the preferred
substrate of this enzyme [91]. Urea cycle genes are also
present in genomes of birds and reptiles which are uricotelic. Four urea cycle genes were found in the genome of
chicken [80], and the ornithine transcarbamylase gene
has been identified in, and cloned from, the lizard Sceloporus undulatum, alligator Alligator missippiensis and ball
python Python regius (Additional File 1). Our BLAST query
of the chicken genome with human NAGS sequence
yielded no results, which is consistent with the requirement for dietary arginine in chickens [92,93]. Two urea
cycle genes, argininosuccinate synthase and lyase, have
been retained in the chicken because they also function in
nitric oxide signaling [94]. However, the presence of OTC
and CPSI genes in the chicken genome, as well as their
sporadic expression in various organs [80,81] appear to be
vestigial remnants from the tetrapod common ancestor,
that we believe was ureogenic.
Our survey of literature and sequence databases indicates
that all tetrapods have CPSI, whereas all other animals,
aquatic and terrestrial, if ureogenic, have the CPSIII gene
(Figure 4 and Additional File 1). NAG is an essential allosteric activator of CPSI in mammals and frogs [3,90]. NAG
also activates CPSIII from Atlantic halibut, spiny dogfish,
and largemouth bass [41,44,55], while CPSIII from alkaline lake tilapia does not require this cofactor for function
[6]. Because NAG is important for enzymatic activity of
both CPSI and CPSIII we wanted to examine when during

Page 9 of 15

BMC Biochemistry 2008, 9:24

evolution the allosteric inversion of arginine effect on
NAGS activity occurred. Our results indicate that the allosteric effect of arginine on NAGS activity changed during
evolution of amphibians, from partial inhibition in
zebrafish and pufferfish to activation in African and western clawed frogs (Table 3). Partial inhibition of zebrafish
and pufferfish NAGS by arginine was surprising since
NAG is expected to be an activator of CPSIII in these
organisms, similar to CPSIII from Atlantic halibut, spiny
dogfish and largemouth bass. However, under conditions
of elevated glutamine between 10 and 15 mM, the CPSIII
in these latter fish become less dependent on NAG
[41,44,55]. The concentration of glutamine in fish mitochondria is not known, but in the rat liver mitochondria
it is between 6.6 and 15 mM [95,96]. Assuming that the
metabolite concentrations in fish and mammalian mitochondria are similar, fish CPSIII would then be expected
to be saturated with glutamine, and NAG may be playing
a role in stabilization of CPSIII instead of its activation.
Fish CPSIII can also use ammonia as a substrate in vitro,
and NAG is essential for CPSIII activity under those conditions [41,44,55]. The transition between glutaminedependent CPSIII and ammonia-dependent CPSI
occurred in amphibians. CPSI from R. catesbeiana cannot
bind glutamine, and CPSI from X. laevis cannot catalyze
the glutaminase reaction due to a mutation of a cysteine
located in the active site of glutaminase domain
[56,57,97]. Our results indicated that NAGS from X. laevis
and X. tropicalis were both activated by arginine (Table 3).
Enzymatic activities of both frog enzymes were also about
one hundred-fold lower than enzymatic activities of other
enzymes we studied. This may have been due to either
lack of selective pressure to maintain high enzymatic
activity in mostly aquatic and ammonotelic frogs [87] or
presently unknown assay requirements. We expect that
NAGS activity of ureotelic bullfrog R. catesbeiana may be
higher; unfortunately, the genome and expressed genes of
this organism are not being sequenced, precluding ready
cloning and examination of the enzymatic activity and
response to arginine of bullfrog NAGS. Taken together,
these results indicate that the switch from arginine inhibition to arginine activation of NAGS occurred in amphibians, and was concurrent with the transition from CPSIII to
CPSI and the tetrapod conquest of land.
CPSI is the rate limiting enzyme of the mammalian urea
cycle because all CP produced by this enzyme is converted
into urea, and under normal physiological conditions
none of the urea cycle intermediates accumulate [98].
Because NAG is essential for the activity of CPSI, and
arginine activates mammalian NAGS, it has been proposed that arginine may play a role in regulation of ureagenesis [99-105]. Arginine is also an intermediate of urea
cycle [3] and the amino acid with the largest number of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/24

nitrogen atoms. Assuming that changes of intramitochondrial concentration of arginine indeed modulate enzymatic activity of NAGS, the activation of NAGS by
arginine in conjunction with the activation of CPSI by
NAG form a double positive feedback loop. This is similar
to double positive feedback loops found in calcium signaling cascades, polarization in budding yeast and cellcycle control in Xenopus oocytes, which are responsible for
rapid and robust regulation of signaling pathways [106].
This double positive feedback system appears to be absent
in fish, where NAGS is partially inhibited by arginine and
the enzymatic activity of CPSIII is not absolutely dependent on NAG. Therefore, while the fish urea cycle may be
capable of efficient conversion of ammonia into urea,
because direct ammonia clearance can occur, it does not
have to be as robust and sensitive to changes in the nitrogen load as the mammalian urea cycle. CPSI appears to
have evolved from CPSIII following the loss of its ability
to bind glutamine [56,57,97]. The resulting CPSI became
completely dependent on NAG, and together with the
inversion of the arginine effect on NAGS activity, have
resulted in a robust detoxification system that is more efficient at protecting the central nervous system from the
harmful effects of ammonia and provided a decisive selective advantage for the tetrapod terrestrial expansion.

Conclusion
The arginine binding site is conserved in vertebrate-like
NAGS, which are inhibited by arginine in bacteria and
fish, and activated by this cofactor in amphibians and
mammals. Therefore, the differences in allosteric effect of
arginine on NAGS result from different conformational
changes induced by binding of arginine to NAGS. The
change in arginine allosteric effect on NAGS coincided
with terrestrial conquest by tetrapods.

Methods
Site-directed Mutagenesis
Arginine-insensitive mutants of mouse NAGS and X.
campestris NAGS-K were generated using mutagenesis
primers listed in Table 1 of the Additional File 2, plasmids
pTOPOmNAGS-M [69] and pTOPOXcNAGS-K [62] as
templates, and the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The presence of each mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids harboring coding
sequences of mutant mNAGS and XcNAGS-K were
cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and inserts were subcloned
into pET15b expression plasmids.
Protein Expression and Purification
Expression plasmids were transformed into C41(DE3) E.
coli cells and overexpression of recombinant proteins was
induced using an Overnight Expression Autoinduction
System 1 (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were purified

with HandeeSpin columns (Pierce), as described previously
[69].
Plasmids
pET15bmNAGS-M
[69],
pET15bXcNAGS-K [62] and pET15bEcNAGS (generously
provided by Dr. Dashuang Shi, Research Center for
Genetic Medicine, Children's National Medical Center)
were used for overexpression and purification of recombinant mouse NAGS, X. campestris NAGS-K and E. coli
NAGS, respectively. NAGS from X. tropicalis and X. laevis
were purified as described previously [69], with some
modifications. Recombinant NAGS from X. laevis and X.
tropicalis were overexpressed in the Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) using induction with 0.1 mM IPTG for 4 hours at
37°C, and 10 mM glutamate was added to all buffers used
for cell lysis and protein purification to help stabilize the
recombinant proteins throughout the purification procedure. Recombinant NAGS from M. maris was overexpressed in Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) following overnight
induction of expression with 0.2 mM IPTG at room temperature. M. maris NAGS was purified, as described previously [107].
Expression plasmids harboring wild-type and arginineinsensitive mouse and X. campestris NAGS-K were transformed into C41(DE3) E. coli cells and overexpression of
recombinant proteins was induced using Overnight
Expression Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were purified using HandeeSpin columns
(Pierce), as described previously [69].
Enzyme Assays
Enzymatic activities of purified proteins were measured,
as described previously [108], with the exception of NAGS
from X. tropicalis and X laevis. Enzymatic activities of frog
NAGS were carried out at room temperature, and with 50
mM glutamate and 12.5 mM AcCoA, which is five-fold
higher than our standard assay conditions [108].
Identification of Urea Cycle Genes Across Phyla
Genomes of zebrafish (D. rerio), pufferfish (T. rubripes),
freshwater pufferfish (T. nigroviridis), African clawed frog
(X. laevis), Western clawed frog (X. tropicalis), sea urchin
(S. purpuratus), sea squirts (C. intestinalis and C. savygnii),
fruit flies (D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura), honeybee (A. mellifera), mosquito (A. gambiae) and roundworms (C. elegans and C. briggasae) were queried with the
human NAGS, CPSI, ornithine transcarbamylase,
argininosuccinate synthase, argininosuccinate lyase and
arginase 1 sequences. When sequences similar to the
query were not present, genomes were also queried with
the E. coli NAGS, CPS, ornithine transcarbamylase,
argininosuccinate synthetase, and argininosuccinate
lyase. Urea cycle genes that were identified are listed in
Table S1.

Identification and Cloning of the NAGS Genes from Fish,
Frogs, Plant and Bacteria
The plant NAGS genes were identified based on their similarity with NAGS from E. coli [62]. The expressed
sequence tag (EST) database was queried with the predicted Arabidopsis NAGS protein to identify clones that
contained full length cDNA for NAGS genes from plants.
A plasmid containing the full length sequence for the Arabidopsis NAGS (Accession# U20510) was identified and
obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource.
This plasmid was used as a template for amplification of
the coding sequence with primers 1 and 2 (Table 2 in
Additional File 2). The amplification conditions were: 3
min. initial denaturation at 95°C followed by 25 cycles of
30 s denaturation at 95°C, 30 s annealing at 55°C and 1.5
min. extension at 72°C, and 5 min. final extension at
72°C using Pfu Turbo Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplification product was subcloned into
pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) producing
pTOPOaNAGS. The correct amino acid sequence was confirmed by sequencing. pTOPOaNAGS was cleaved with
AseI and BamHI and Arabidopsis NAGS was cloned into
pET15b expression plasmid (Novagen), cleaved with NdeI
and BamHI. The AseI restriction endonuclease was used
because an NdeI site is present in the Arabidopsis NAGS
coding sequence and the two enzymes have compatible
cohesive ends. The resulting plasmid, called
pET15baNAGS, allows overexpression of the recombinant
protein with the N-terminal polyhistidine affinity tag.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes)
NAGS genes were identified based on their similarity with
mammalian NAGS [62]. The EST database was queried
with the predicted pufferfish NAGS protein sequence and
two plasmids containing full length sequence of the pufferfish NAGS were identified (Accession# CA846082 and
BU808158) and obtained from ATCC. The coding
sequence of pufferfish NAGS was amplified using EST
clones as template, primers 3 and 4 (Table 2 in Additional
File 2) and the same amplification conditions as for Arabidopsis NAGS coding sequence. The amplification product was subcloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid
(Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that it codes for
the correct amino acid sequence. The coding sequence for
pufferfish NAGS was excised with NdeI and BamHI from
the TOPO-plasmid and cloned into pET15b plasmid
resulting in pET15bfNAGS-M.
A query of the EST database with the predicted zebrafish
NAGS protein did not identify a plasmid containing the
full length coding sequence for zebrafish NAGS. A cDNA
library prepared form adult zebrafish mRNA and inserted
into pExpress-1 plasmid was obtained from Open Biosystems (cat# LDR1216) and used to clone zebrafish NAGS
coding sequence. The first round of amplification was

done with primers 5 and 6 (Table 2 in Additional File 2)
and 100 ng of plasmid cDNA library as the template and
the following conditions: 3 min. initial denaturation at
95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C,
30 s annealing at 55°C and 1.5 min extension at 72°C,
and 5 min. final extension at 72°C. The second round of
amplification was carried out with primers 7 and 8 (Table
2 in Additional File 2), 1 μl of amplification product from
the first round and the following conditions: 3 min. initial
denaturation at 95°C, followed by 20 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 30 s annealing at 55°C and 1.5 min
extension at 72°C, and 5 min. final extension at 72°C.
The amplification product was subcloned into
pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced to
confirm that it codes for the correct amino acid sequence.
The coding sequence for zebrafish NAGS was subcloned
into pET15b resulting in pET15bzfNAGS-M expression
plasmid.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/24

The coding sequence of M. maris NAGS gene was amplified from M. maris MCS10 genomic DNA (generously provided by Dr. Craig Stephens, Biology Department, Santa
Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA)
using Phusion™ polymerase (Finnzymes, New England
BioLabs) and the primers 13 and 14 (Table 2 in Additional File 2). Amplification conditions were: 30 s at 98°C
for the polymerase activation and 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 sec. at 98°C, annealing for 15 sec. at 60°C and
extension for 30 sec. at 72°C, followed by final extension
for 10 min. at 72°C, yielding a unique fragment of the
desired size. The PCR product was cloned into a TOPO
vector using a Zero-Blunt TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen).
NdeI and XhoI were used to move the M. maris NAGS coding sequence from the TOPO plasmid into bacterial
expression vector pET28a (Novagen), resulting in the
plasmid pET28aMmNAGS.

Abbreviations
A query of the EST database with predicted protein
sequences of NAGS from X. laevis and X. tropicalis identified two plasmids containing their full length coding
sequences. Plasmid containing the coding sequence of X.
tropicalis NAGS was obtained from ATCC (cat # 5592351)
and plasmid with X. laevis NAGS coding sequence was
obtained from Open Biosystems (cat# EXL10515611590). The coding sequence of X. laevis NAGS was
amplified using the EST clone as a template, primers 9 and
10 (Table 2 in Additional File 2) with the same amplification conditions used for the Arabidopsis NAGS coding
sequence. The amplification product was subcloned into
pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) producing
pTOPOXlNAGS-M. The correct amino acid sequence was
confirmed by sequencing. The pTOPOXlNAGS was
cleaved with AseI and BamHI and X. laevis NAGS was
cloned into pET15b expression plasmid (Novagen),
cleaved with NdeI and BamHI. The AseI restriction endonuclease was used because an NdeI site is present in the X.
laevis NAGS coding sequence and the two enzymes have
compatible cohesive ends. The resulting plasmid was
called pET15bXlNAGS-M. The coding sequence of X. tropicalis NAGS contained NdeI and BamHI restriction sites.
Site directed mutagenesis was used to introduce silent
mutations that remove NdeI and BamHI restriction sites
without affecting the amino acid sequence. Plasmid with
this modified coding sequence of X. tropicalis NAGS was
used as a template for amplification with primers 11 and
12 (Table 2 in Additional File 2) and the same conditions
as described for Arabidopsis NAGS. The amplification
product was subcloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid
(Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that it codes for
the correct amino acid sequence. The coding sequence for
X. tropicalis NAGS was subcloned into pET15b, resulting
in expression plasmid pET15bXtNAGS-M.
