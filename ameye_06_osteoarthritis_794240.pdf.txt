Abstract
The scientific and medical community remains skeptical
regarding the efficacy of nutrition for osteoarthritis despite their
broad acceptation by patients. In this context, this paper
systematically reviews human clinical trials evaluating the effects
of nutritional compounds on osteoarthritis. We searched the
Medline, Embase, and Biosis databases from their inception to
September 2005 using the terms random, double-blind method,
trial, study, placebo, and osteoarthritis. We selected all peerreviewed articles reporting the results of randomised human
clinical trials (RCTs) in osteoarthritis that investigated the effects
of oral interventions based on natural molecules. Studies on
glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were excluded. The quality
of the RCTs was assessed with an osteoarthritic-specific
standardised set of 12 criteria and a validated instrument. A
best-evidence synthesis was used to categorise the scientific

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent and disabling
chronic diseases affecting the elderly. Its most prominent feature is the progressive destruction of articular cartilage which
results in impaired joint motion, severe pain, and, ultimately,
disability. Its high prevalence and its moderate-to-severe
impact on daily life pose a significant public health problem
[1].
Today, a cure for OA remains elusive. The management of OA
is largely palliative, focusing on the alleviation of symptoms.
Current recommendations for the management of OA include
a combination of nonpharmacological interventions (weight

evidence behind each nutritional compound as good, moderate,
or limited. A summary of the most relevant in vitro and animal
studies is used to shed light on the potential mechanisms of
action. Inclusion criteria were met by 53 RCTs out of the 2,026
identified studies. Good evidence was found for avocado
soybean unsaponifiables. Moderate evidence was found for
methylsulfonylmethane and SKI306X, a cocktail of plant
extracts. Limited evidence was found for the Chinese plant
extract Duhuo Jisheng Wan, cetyl myristoleate, lipids from
green-lipped mussels, and plant extracts from Harpagophytum
procumbens. Overall, scientific evidence exists for some
specific nutritional interventions to provide symptom relief to
osteoarthritic patients. It remains to be investigated whether
nutritional compounds can have structure-modifying effects.

loss, education programs, exercise, and so on) and pharmacological treatments (paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and so on) [2]. Among these
pharmacological treatments, NSAIDs, despite serious adverse
effects associated with their long-term use, remain among the
most widely prescribed drugs for OA [3]. In this context, there
is a need for safe and effective alternative treatments while the
absence of any cure reinforces the importance of prevention.
Such prevention and alternative treatments could come from
nutrition. It is now increasingly recognised that, beyond meeting basic nutritional needs, nutrition may play a beneficial role
in some diseases [4]. OA as a chronic disease is the perfect
paradigm of a pathology the treatment of which could be

addressed by nutrition. By nature, nutrition is better positioned
to provide long-term rather than short-term health benefits.
This is because, in most cases, a nutritional compound has
only limited effects on its biological target and relevant and significant differences are reached only over time through a buildup effect in which daily benefits add up day after day. For this
reason, and because the time window for intervention is longer
in chronic diseases, such diseases should, in theory, benefit
more from nutrition than do acute diseases. In addition,
because the mechanisms of cartilage degradation in OA are
multifactorial and some nutritional compounds (such as plant
extracts) usually contain multiple active compounds that target
multiple pathways, nutrition could provide an alternative to
pharmacological interventions whose often monomodal mode
of action may explain their partial lack of clinical efficacy in OA.
The attractiveness of using nutrition for OA also lies in the detriments that it can prevent. Long-term pharmacological interventions in OA are often associated with significant adverse
effects. Nutraceuticals and functional foods could provide an
advantageous alternative because, by regulatory laws, they
have to be devoid of adverse effects.
There is no consensus on the definition of nutraceuticals and
functional foods. The term 'nutraceutical' was coined from
'nutrition' and 'pharmaceutical' in 1989 by DeFelice and was
originally defined as 'a food (or part of the food) that provides
medical or health benefits, including the prevention and/or
treatment of a disease' [5]. In a policy paper in 1999, Zeisel
distinguished whole foods from the natural bioactive chemical
compounds derived from them and available in a non-food
matrix by using the term 'functional foods' to describe the
former and nutraceuticals to describe the latter [6]. Under this
newer definition (which we will use in the rest of this paper),
nutraceuticals are thus functional ingredients sold as powders, pills, and other medicinal forms not generally associated
with food. The term nutraceutical has no regulatory definition
and is not recognised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which uses instead the term 'dietary supplements' [7].
Some functional ingredients are sold as nutraceuticals in
some countries but as drugs (that is, requiring medical prescription) in others. Compared with a nutraceutical/dietary
supplement, a functional food is a food or drink product consumed as part of the daily diet [7,8]. It can be distinguished
from a traditional food 'if it is satisfactorily demonstrated to
affect beneficially one or more target functions in the body,
beyond adequate nutritional effects in a way which is relevant
to either the state of well-being and health or the reduction of
the risk of a disease' [9]. A food product can be made functional by eliminating a deleterious ingredient, by adding a beneficial ingredient, by increasing the concentration of an
ingredient known to have beneficial effects, or by increasing
the bioavailability or stability of a beneficial ingredient [10]. In
this paper, the beneficial ingredient supposed to provide the
health benefit in a functional food or nutraceutical will be called
functional ingredient. The functional ingredient in a functional

Page 2 of 22

food or in a nutraceutical/dietary supplement can be a macronutrient (for example, n-3 fatty acids), a micronutrient (for
example, vitamins), or an ingredient with little or no nutritive
value (for example, phytochemicals) [10].
In this context, the public interest in the benefits that nutrition
could provide for OA is high. Numerous lay publications advertise the use of a whole range of nutraceuticals and functional
foods for OA, and up to one out of five patients with OA uses
such nonprescribed alternative medications [11], despite the
fact that the mechanism of action of these products is often
speculative and their efficacy not always supported by rigorous scientific studies. The aim of this paper was thus to review
the available scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of the
functional ingredients targeting OA and explaining their mechanism of action.

Materials and methods
Identification and selection of the literature
Systematic literature searches were performed to identify all
human randomised clinical trials (RCTs) related to nutrition
and OA. Computer databases used were Medline, Embase,
and Biosis (searched from their respective inceptions to September 2005). Preliminary trial searches targeting specifically
nutrition/nutraceuticals with lists of keywords such as 'food',
'supplements', 'plant', 'nutrition', 'vitamins', 'mineral', and
'nutraceuticals' performed poorly. Numerous valid trials that
were already known to us were not selected by such searches.
Hence, to be as exhaustive as possible, we changed our strategy and, instead of focusing on nutrition, devised a systematic
search aiming at selecting all clinical trials in OA. This search
of clinical trials in OA was fine-tuned for each database.
Medline was searched by using the following strategy: random* AND (double-blind method [mh] OR (trial? OR stud???
OR placebo)) AND osteoarthritis [mh]. Embase was searched
with the following keywords: (double near blind OR trial? OR
stud??? OR placebo) AND osteoarthritis. Biosis was
searched with the following keywords: random* AND (double
near blind OR trial? OR stud??? OR placebo) AND osteoarthritis. These searches generated 1,519, 324, and 678 studies, respectively.

After the identical studies in the three searches were eliminated, the 2,026 remaining studies were individually screened
based on their title and (if required) abstract or full content
(Table 1). To be eligible for inclusion, a study had to fulfil all the
following criteria: (a) to be a human RCT, (b) to investigate
solely OA or (if investigating OA with other diseases) to report
the results related to OA separately, (c) to be a peer-reviewed
full paper (no restrictions on language), and (d) to investigate
the effects of dietary/oral interventions focusing on natural
molecules (as opposed to synthetic molecules). This last criterion is somewhat arbitrary. Its purpose was to separate the
nutritional interventions from the pharmacological ones, a task
which is far from trivial. Functional nutrition is a recent rapidly

evolving field set at the border between foods and drugs,
which explains why some ingredients, such as glucosamine,
chondroitin sulphate, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), are
registered as drugs in some countries but used in functional
foods or as nutraceuticals in others. Because of this last criterion, studies focusing on SAMe were excluded from this
review. Indeed, although a natural physiologic precursor of
endogenous sulfated compounds, SAMe in its native form
degrades rapidly and only stabilised synthetic forms have
been used in scientific studies [12]. Studies dealing with glucosamine HCl, glucosamine sulphate, and chondroitin sulfate
were excluded because several high-quality meta-analyses on
these molecules have recently been published [13-16].
To look for further unidentified RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, a second search in PubMed was performed with OA and
the name of each ingredient found through the primary search
and also by screening the reference lists of all relevant articles
identified. Finally, for all ingredients used in the RCTs selected
that way, a systematic search limited to PubMed was performed to identify in vitro and animal studies related to this
ingredient and articular cartilage. Among these studies, the
most relevant ones were selected, and their results were
reported to shed light upon the potential mechanisms of
actions of these nutritional interventions.
Quality assessment
This systematic review focuses on statistical differences in primary endpoints between treatment groups and considers the
trials efficacious if the difference between groups was significant (P < 0.05) in placebo-controlled trials and not significant
in NSAID-controlled trials. When no primary endpoint was
mentioned, effects on visual analog scales (VASs), Lequesne
functional index (LFI), and Western Ontario and McMaster universities (WOMAC) index were preferentially reported if available and used for the evaluation of efficacy.

The quality of each RCT related to a functional ingredient the
efficacy of which was supported at least by one RCT was
scored according to a standard set of 12 criteria based on

published recommendations for the design of clinical trials in
patients with OA [17-20] (Table 2). One point was assigned
to each criterion that was met. If the criterion was not met or
was not described at all, no point was assigned. The points
were summed and divided by 12 in order to express the quality
score as a percentage. A minus was placed in front of the
score if the RCT did not support the efficacy of the intervention. Both authors scored the RCTs independently. Divergence was resolved by consensus after discussion. An RCT
was considered of high quality when its OA-specific score
was greater than or equal to 75%. Both authors also scored
the RCTs with the validated Jadad score [21]. To determine
and validate the robustness of our OA-specific score, the interindividual variabilities of the two scores were calculated on the
42 graded RCTs. The inter-individual variabilities of the two
scores were comparable and equaled 7% and 8%, respectively (that is, 7% to 8% of the individual criteria of the two
scores end up with a different point between the two authors
of this study).
Best-evidence synthesis
A global score was then calculated to summarise the strength
of evidence available for each functional ingredient (Table 3).
To take into account the quality and quantity of RCTs, the global score was calculated by adding a factor to the mean quality score of the RCTs (that is, 0.33 when two positive highquality RCTs were available, 0.66 when three positive highquality RCTs were available, and 1.00 when four positive highquality RCTs were available). Likewise, when two, three, or
four negative high-quality RCTs were available, 0.33, 0.66, or
1, respectively, was subtracted from the mean quality score of
the RCTs. Adding a factor gives more weight to the high-quality trials and helps to prevent the 'dilution' of the outcomes of
high-quality trials when numerous low-quality trials exist. It also
distinguishes the functional ingredients supported only by
one, two, three, or four high-quality trials, which would otherwise end up with the same global score.

Consequently, the scores range from -2 to +2:

Report of adverse effects

▪ A score below -0.5 corresponds to at least some evidence of
inefficacy.

▪ A score between 1.67 and 2.00 indicates very good evidence of efficacy because it requires four positive high-quality
trials in the absence of major conflicting evidence.

Historically, functional ingredients can be derived from primary
food sources, from secondary food sources, from traditional
medicinal products from all around the world, or from materials
with no history of human exposure (for example, stanols from
paper industry by-products for their cholesterol-lowering
effects) [22]. The situation regarding OA is no different. Some
ingredients included in this review are from primary food
sources (for example, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [n-3
PUFAs]), from secondary food sources (for example, ginger),
from traditional medicinal products (for example, cat's claw), or
from material with no history of human exposure as such (for
example, 'hyperimmune' milk). The investigated nutritional
interventions focused on lipids (avocado and soybean unsaponifiables [ASUs], n-3 PUFAs, lipid extracts from New Zealand green-lipped mussel, and cetyl myristoleate), on vitamins
and minerals (vitamins C, E, B3, and B12, boron, a cocktail of
vitamins and selenium, and a cocktail of minerals), on plant
extracts (bromelain, Rosa canina, Harpagophytum procumbens, Uncaria tomentosa, and Uncaria guianensis, Salix sp.,
ginger, turmerics, tipi tea, soy proteins, and Boswellia serrata),
on a cocktail of plant extracts (SKI306X, Gitadyl, Duhua Jushing Wan, and Articulin-F), and on a few other types of ingredients (methylsulfonlymethane, hyperimmune milk, and collagen
hydrolysate).

Results

Lipids

Out of the 2,026 identified studies, 52 RCTs that investigated
the effects of functional ingredients in OA and that had their
results reported in peer-reviewed full papers were identified.

Avocado/soybean unsaponifiables
The most thoroughly investigated lipid mixture is Piascledine
(Pharmascience, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Piascled-

▪ A score between -0.5 and +0.5 indicates a lack of evidence
of efficacy because it is obtained in case of conflicting evidence or when a majority of poor-quality trials are available.
▪ A score greater than 0.5 but less than or equal to 1 corresponds to limited evidence of efficacy because it is obtained
when a majority of medium-quality trials exist in the presence
of a maximum of one positive high-quality trial or when a single
positive high-quality trial is available.
▪ A score between 1.01 and 1.33 indicates moderate evidence of efficacy because it requires two positive high-quality
trials in the absence of major conflicting evidence.
▪ A score between 1.34 and 1.66 indicates good evidence of
efficacy because it requires three positive high-quality trials in
the absence of major conflicting evidence.

Each item of the osteoarthritis (OA) score was given 1 point when it met the specified criterion listed in Table 2. If it did not meet the criterion or was
not described at all, a score of 0 was assigned. For each trial, the sum of the individual scores was expressed as a percentage to give a relative total
quality score. aTo be included in this table, any functional ingredient had to have its efficacy supported at least by one trial. This was considered to
be the case when a statistical difference in the primary endpoint of a clinical trial was observed or, in the absence of a defined primary endpoint,
when statistical differences were observed in several of the reported endpoints. bRandomised human clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the structuremodifying effects of the functional ingredients. cCocktail of three plant extracts and zinc complex.dCocktail of five plant extracts among which one
extract from Salix sp.

ine is composed of one third avocado and two thirds soybean
unsaponifiables (ASUs), the oily fractions that, after hydrolysis,
do not produce soap [23].
Four double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs (Table 4) and one
systematic review evaluated ASUs on knee and hip OA [2428]. In two 3-month RCTs, one on knee and hip OA [24] and
one solely on knee OA [25], 300 mg once a day decreased
NSAID intake. No statistical difference in any primary or secondary endpoints was detected between 300 and 600 mg
once a day [25]. In a 6-month RCT on knee and hip OA, 300
mg once a day resulted in an improved LFI compared with placebo [26]. ASUs had a 2-month delayed onset of action as
well as residual symptomatic effects 2 months after the end of
treatment. In a 2-year RCT on hip OA, 300 mg once a day did
not slow down narrowing of joint space width [27]. In addition,
none of the secondary endpoints (LFI, VAS of pain, NSAID
intake, and patients' and investigators' global assessments)
was statistically different from placebo after 1 year. However,
a post hoc analysis suggested that ASUs might decrease narrowing of joint space width in patients with the most severe hip
OA. In summary, although ASUs might display medium-term
(several months') symptom-modifying effects on knee and hip
OA, their symptom-modifying effects in the long term (>1 year)
have not been confirmed. ASUs might slow down narrowing of
joint space width in patients with severe hip OA, but this
requires confirmation. Based on our best-evidence synthesis,
good evidence is provided by ASUs for symptom-modifying
effects in knee and hip OA but at the same time, there is some
evidence of absence of structure-modifying effects (Table 3).
A recent systematic review on ASUs recommended further
investigation because three of the four rigorous RCTs suggest
that ASUs is an effective symptomatic treatment, but the longterm study is largely negative [28]. However, the fact that this
long-term study was primarily aiming at demonstrating structure-modifying and not symptom-modifying effects might
explain why no symptomatic effects from ASUs were detected
in the long-term study. Indeed, symptoms and structural dam-

age are known to mildly correlate in OA, and the most appropriate patients to demonstrate a structure-modifying effect
might not be the most appropriate to demonstrate a symptommodifying effect. As for safety, none of the four RCTs reported
significant differences in adverse effects between ASUs and
placebo.
In sheep with lateral meniscectomy, 900 mg once a day for 6
months reduced the loss of toluidine blue stain in cartilage and
prevented subchondral sclerosis in the inner zone of the lateral
tibial plateau but not focal cartilage lesions [29].
In vitro, ASUs display anabolic, anticatabolic, and anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes. ASUs increased collagen
synthesis [30] and inhibited the spontaneous and interleukin
(IL)-1β-induced collagenase activity [23,31]. They increased
the basal synthesis of aggrecan and reversed the IL1βinduced reduction in aggrecan synthesis [32]. ASUs were
also shown to reduce the spontaneous and IL1β-induced production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, IL-6, IL-8, and
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) while weakly reversing the IL1βinduced decrease in TIMP (tissue inhibiting metalloproteinase)-1 production [23,30,32]. One study showed that ASUs
decreased the spontaneous production of nitric oxide (NO)
and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β [32] while stimulating the expression of transforming growth factor-β and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [33]. This stimulated production
of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 could decrease MMP
activation.
The effects of avocado unsaponifiables alone, of soybean
unsaponifiables alone, and of three mixtures of ASUs, were
compared [23,32]. The mixtures were A1S2 (Piascledine),
A2S1, and A1S1, with respective ratios of ASUs of 1:2, 2:1,
and 1:1. All mixtures significantly reduced the spontaneous
production of IL-6, IL-8, and PGE2 and the IL1β-induced production of PGE2. A1S2 and A1S1, but not A2S1, significantly
reduced the spontaneous and IL1β-induced production of

MMP-3 and the IL1β-induced increase in collagenase activity,
but only A1S2 inhibited the spontaneous collagenase activity.
For some parameters, avocado unsaponifiables or soybean
unsaponifiables alone were as potent as mixtures. In some
cases, a single source of unsaponifiables seemed to be active.
In other cases, both sources of unsaponifiables were active
with synergistic or counteracting effects. The superiority of
Piascledine over different ASU mixtures or over avocado or
soybean unsaponifiables alone thus remains to be
demonstrated.

Omega-3 PUFAs
PUFAs are classified as n-3, n-6, or n-9 depending on the
position of the last double bond along the fatty acid chain. In
n-3, this last double bond is located between the third and
fourth carbon atom from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain.
The main dietary PUFAs are n-3 (such as linolenic acid and
eicosapentenoic acid) and n-6 (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid). Omega-3 is found in soybean and canola oils,
flaxseeds, walnuts, and fish oils, whereas n-6 is found in safflower, corn, soybean, and sunflower oils as well as in meat.
The modern Western diet is relatively low in n-3 PUFAs and
relatively high in n-6 compared with the diet in Western preindustrialised societies or with the modern Eastern diet. The n6/n-3 ratio is 25:1 in the modern Western diet compared with
2:1 in Western pre-industrialised societies. A high n-3 intake
correlates with a low incidence of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases [34,35]. The utility of n-3 for OA remains to
be shown. In a 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled RCT,
10 ml of cod liver oil per day containing 786 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, in addition to treatment with NSAIDs, did not
decrease the VAS of pain or disability [36].

The articular cartilage content of arachidonic acid, a n-6 precursor of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid PGE2, correlates
with OA severity [37]. n-3 and n-6 are metabolised by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipo-oxygenases (LOXs) into distinct
eicosanoids. The n-6-derived eicosanoids tend to be proinflammatory, whereas the n-3-derived eicosanoids tend to be
anti-inflammatory. Hence, a high proportion of n-3 is supposed
to lead to a relative deficiency in pro-inflammatory n-6 metabolites [34]. Dietary lipid interventions in animals modified the
PUFA composition of articular cartilage [38], suggesting that
high n-3 intake could have a beneficial effect on cartilage
metabolism. In addition to eicosanoids, the anti-inflammatory
effect of n-3 could also be mediated by their newly discovered
oxygenated derivatives called resolvins, which through their
binding to G protein-coupled receptors act as potent antagonists of inflammation [39].
The in vitro effects of 10 to 100 µg/ml of n-3 (linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) on chondrocytes
have been investigated [40-42]. n-3 did not affect the spontaneous or the IL1-induced decrease in glycosaminoglycan
(GAG) synthesis, but dose-dependently inhibited the IL1induced GAG degradation. n-3 dose-dependently decreased
the IL1-induced aggrecanase activity and basal aggrecanase
and collagenase activity, whereas, in contrast, n-6 stimulated
the basal aggrecanase and collagenase activity. n-3 also
decreased the IL1-induced mRNA expression of ADAMTS-4
(aggrecanase), COX-2, 5-LOX, FLAP (5-LOX-activating protein), IL1α, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α and the basal
mRNA levels of these genes. Finally, n-3 decreased the basal
and IL1β-induced mRNA and protein levels of MMP-3 and
MMP-13. All these parameters were unaffected by n-6 PUFAs.
Taken together, these results indicate that n-3 PUFAs have
anticatabolic and anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless,

too low of an n-6/n-3 ratio can be detrimental. A diet with very
low levels of n-6 PUFAs induced occasional surface irregularities and localised proteoglycan depletion in cartilages in rats
[38].

Lipid extract from New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna
canaliculus)
The incidence of arthritis in coastal-dwelling Maoris is low,
possibly due to their high consumption of green-lipped mussels. The powder and lipid extracts from this mussel have been
investigated in OA (Table 4). These products contain n-3
PUFAs as well as vitamins associated or not associated with
chondroitin sulfate, amino acids, and minerals [43,44]. In a 6month double-blind placebo-controlled RCT on knee OA,
Seatone™ (McFarlane Laboratories, Auckland, New Zeland), a
mussel gonad extract, improved four endpoints (VAS of pain,
functional index, and patients' and physicians' overall assessments) out of 10 investigated but only in patients with mild to
moderate OA [45]. In a 3-month double-blind RCT, 350 mg of
Seatone™ three times a day improved VAS of pain in 40% of
patients versus 13% in placebo [46]. In a small 3-month double-blind RCT, 1,150 mg/day of a mussel powder and 210
mg/day of a lipid extract decreased the values of a VAS of pain
[47]. However, the small number of enrolled patients and the
absence of placebo group, complete blinding, and baseline
characteristics of the population seriously limit the relevance
of this trial. No serious adverse effects have been reported.
According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), there is
limited evidence of efficacy for green-lipped mussel in OA.
This is in agreement with a recent systematic review evaluating
the effectiveness of this ingredient for OA and rheumatoid
arthritis [48].
In a 6-week double-blind placebo-controlled RCT in dogs, 1 g
per day of a green-lipped mussel powder sprinkled on the food
or on semi-moist treats or directly incorporated as 0.3% in a
dry diet significantly improved total arthritic score, joint pain,
and joint swelling [44,49]. More than 50% of the dogs demonstrated a 30% or greater reduction in total arthritic score.
However, it is unclear whether these dogs suffered from OA
specifically, and the disease severity was not described.

Cetyl myristoleate
The oil cetyl myristoleate is the hexadecyl ester of the unsaturated fatty acid cis-9-tetradecenoic acid, commonly named
myristoleic acid. Whereas myristoleic acid is commonly found
in fish oils, whale oils, and dairy butter, cetyl myristoleate is
known to exist only naturally in sperm whale oil and in a small
gland in the male beaver. It can be synthesised by esterification of myristoleic acid. Although cetyl myristoleate is claimed
to be beneficial for OA, there is lack of scientific evidence to
support its efficacy. Nevertheless, a 68-day placebo-controlled single-blind RCT on severe knee OA (that is, LFI >14) concluded that three 500 mg capsules, containing 350 mg of a
blend of olive oil and various cetylated fatty acids, 50 mg of

Page 12 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

lecithin, and 75 mg of fish oil, twice a day, significantly
increased knee flexion compared with placebo [50] (Table 4).
According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), this lowquality RCT provides limited scientific evidence of efficacy for
cetyl myristoleate. Hence, further research is needed to evaluate the safety and potential benefits of cetyl myristoleate and
cetylated fatty acids in the treatment of OA.
Vitamins and minerals
Due to their antioxidant properties, vitamins could have beneficial effects in OA [51,52]. Usually, antioxidant defences neutralise most reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enzymes such
as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase or by small
antioxidant molecules. However, when ROS are produced in
increased amounts like in OA, the antioxidant capacity of cells
and tissues can become insufficient to detoxify the ROS,
which then contribute to cartilage degradation by inhibiting
matrix synthesis, directly degrading matrix molecules, or activating MMPs (reviewed in [53]).

The effects of vitamins C, E, and B on OA have been formally
investigated in RCTs (see below). One obvious candidate not
yet evaluated is vitamin D (vit D). Pathophysiological changes
in OA affect periarticular bone, and normal bone metabolism
requires vit D. Hence, suboptimal levels of vit D may impair
bone metabolism and predispose to OA. In addition, the
expression of vit D receptors is upregulated in human OA
chondrocytes [54]. The Framingham study found a threefold
increase in risk of OA progression for patients in the middle
and lowest tertiles of serum levels of 25-vit D [55]. Low serum
levels of vit D also predicted loss of joint space and osteophyte growth. The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures in women
found that the risk of incident hip OA defined by joint space
narrowing was increased for patients in the middle and lowest
tertiles of serum levels of 25-vit D3 [56]. Based on these data,
an RCT testing the efficacy of vit D may be required.

Vitamin C
Vitamin C (vit C) is a common term used for L-ascorbic acid,
dehydro-L-ascorbic acid (the oxidised from of L-ascorbic
acid), and L-ascorbic acid salts (sodium, potassium, and calcium L-ascorbate). L-ascorbic acid constitutes the majority
(80%-90%) of vit C in food. It is found in rose hips, blackcurrants, and citrus fruits but can also be synthesised from
glucose.
The Framingham epidemiological study found a threefold
reduction in risk of OA progression for both the middle and
highest tertiles of vit C intake and an inverse association
between vit C intake and cartilage loss [57]. No association
was found between vit C intake and osteophyte growth or rate
of apparition of the disease. In this study, vit C intake was
assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, which can
induce errors and bias. In a 14-day double-blind crossover
RCT on knee and hip OA, 1 g twice a day of calcium ascorbate

Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/8/4/R127

was more efficient than placebo in decreasing VAS of pain
[58] (Table 4). Although the quality of the RCT was high (Table
3), the measured effect was small (a 4.6-mm decrease from a
starting basal level of 50 mm) and obtained with a dose equal
to the upper tolerable intake level for adults (that is, the highest
level of daily intake from food, water, and supplements which
is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for almost all
individuals in the general population), well above the current
recommended daily allowances (RDAs) of 60 to 200 mg per
day. The long-term safety of such high doses of vit C in elderly
patients with OA needs to be evaluated, and efficacy needs to
be confirmed by longer RCTs.
Guinea pigs, like humans, possess a nonfunctional gene for Lgulono-γ-lactone oxidase, which makes them unable to synthesise ascorbic acid and dependent on dietary ascorbic acid to
prevent scurvy. In guinea pigs, a 'megadose' of 150 mg per
day of ascorbic acid decreased the severity of surgically
induced knee OA [59,60] but increased severity of spontaneous OA [61], despite the ability of ascorbic acid to increase
cartilage collagen content. A third guinea pig trial stated, on
the contrary, without providing any details, that a fivefold
increase of ascorbic acid to the drinking water (equivalent to
1 g per liter) had a slight chondroprotective effect on the
development of spontaneous lesions but not on surgically
induced OA [62]. In view of these conflicting results and in the
absence of strong evidence of efficacy in humans, it was
recommended that vit C intakes for OA not exceed the current
RDA [61].
Articular cartilage accumulates ascorbic acid [63]. In chondrocytes, ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbate are transported,
respectively, through the sodium-dependent vit C transporter
(SVCT)-2 [64] and the glucose transporter GLUT 1 [65]. In
OA, the majority of vit C is expected to be transported through
SVCT-2 [65]. Ascorbic acid serves as a cofactor for prolyl and
lysyl hydroxylases, enzymes crucial in collagen synthesis. In
vitro, ascorbate and ascorbic acid increased protein and proteoglycan synthesis by articular chondrocytes [64,66,67] and
increased the mRNA levels of type I and II collagen [64,68]
and aggrecan and α-prolyl 4-hydroxylase [64]. It decreased
the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced GAG release [69]. It
also affected the activities of lysosomal enzymes, decreasing
the activities of arylsulfatase A and arysulfatase B, an N-acetylgalactosaminidase-4-sulfatase, but increasing the activity of
acid phosphatase in normal and OA chondrocytes [66].
Ascorbic acid can cross-link collagen and other proteins by
non-enzymatic glycation, leading to the formation of advanced
glycation endproducts (AGEs). Threose, a metabolite of
ascorbic acid, increases the AGE content of articular cartilage
in vitro [70]. These cross-links increase the stiffness of the collagen network, which is hypothesised to increase cartilage
susceptibility to OA. High in vitro levels of ascorbic acid (756
µM) also increased protein carbonylation, one type of oxidative

damage [64]. However, when guinea pigs were fed with diets
containing different levels of ascorbic acid, no changes in the
AGE content of articular cartilage were detected [61].

Vitamin E
Natural vitamin E (vit E) comprises eight different forms, α-, β, γ-, and δ-tocopherol and α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienol, produced solely by plants. One of the richest food sources of vit
E is edible plant oils. Synthetic α-tocopherols (the eight other
possible side-chain stereoisomers besides the natural one)
and their esters (α-tocopherylsuccinate and α-tocopherylacetate) also exist. α-Tocopherylacetate is often used commercially because vit E esterification protects it from oxidation. In
the human body, the ester is rapidly cleaved by cellular esterases making natural vit E available.
Five RCTs have tested the natural form of vit E or α-tocopherylacetate. Two trials concluded that vit E was more efficient
than placebo in decreasing pain. In a small 10-day single-blind
crossover RCT on mainly spondylosis, 600 mg of vit E per day
was superior to placebo as assessed by a patient questionnaire [71], whereas in a 6-week double-blind RCT on OA, 400
IU of α-tocopherylacetate once a day was superior to placebo
as assessed by a joined patients' and doctors' global assessment of pain [72]. One trial suggested that vit E was no less
efficient than diclofenac in decreasing pain. In a 3-week double-blind RCT on OA, no significant difference was found
between 544 mg of α-tocopherylacetate three times a day and
50 mg diclofenac three times a day on VAS of pain [73]. However, the two most recent trials failed to show any benefit over
placebo on knee OA. In a 6-month double-blind RCT, 500 IU
of vit E a day showed no symptomatic benefit over placebo as
assessed by WOMAC [74], whereas in a 2-year double-blind
RCT, 500 IU of vit E a day showed no symptomatic or structure-modifying benefit over placebo as assessed by magnetic
resonance imaging or WOMAC, respectively [75]. Although
three out of the five RCTs concluded that vit E decreased pain,
the two longest, largest, and highest-quality trials (Table 3)
failed to detect any symptomatic or structural effects in knee
OA. This suggested that, at least for knee OA, vit E alone has
no medium-term beneficial effect. According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), there is no evidence of symptommodifying efficacy for vit E and some evidence of inefficacy
regarding structure-modifying effects. No significant adverse
event was reported.
Only a few papers investigated the in vitro effects of vit E on
chondrocytes. Tiku et al. [76] showed that when chondrocytes
were submitted to an oxidative burst, vit E reduced the catabolism of collagen by preventing the protein oxidation mediated
by aldehydic downproducts of lipid peroxidation. Vit E strongly
increased the sulfate incorporation while slightly reducing the
glucosamine incorporation [77], suggesting that it increased
GAG sulfatation or that it increased GAG synthesis while
reducing glycoproteins or glycolipids synthesis. Like vit C, vit

E affected the activities of lysosomal enzymes: it decreased
the activities of arylsulfatase A and of acid phosphatase in cultures of human articular chondrocytes [77]. However, vit E did
not affect the LPS-induced catabolism of GAGs [69] and did
not prevent synoviocyte apoptosis induced by superoxide anions [78].

Vitamins B
In a 3-month double-blind RCT of high quality (Table 3), a
megadose of niacinamide (vitamin B3, 500 mg six times per
day) was more efficient than placebo in reducing drug intake
and symptoms but not pain [79] (Table 4). Such a high dose
is 2 orders of magnitude above the upper tolerable intake level
and is of concern [80].
A 2-month double-blind crossover RCT in hand OA comparing
6,400 µg of folate with or without 20 µg of cobalamin (vitamin
B12) daily, to placebo, had no significant effects on mean hand
grip values [81].

Cocktail of vitamins and selenium
Two cocktails of vitamins with added selenium, a component
of the antioxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase, have been
investigated. In a small pilot 6-month double-blind placebocontrolled RCT, a mixture of vitamins A, C, and E (in undisclosed amounts) and 144 µg of selenium per day had no effect
on VAS of pain or stiffness [82]. Vitamins A, C, E, B2, and B6
and selenium decreased OA incidence and severity in STR/
1N mice, possibly through an antioxidant effect because the
expression of two antioxidative enzymes, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, was increased in cartilage
[83].
Boron
Femoral OA bone contains less boron, a nonmetallic trivalent
chemical element, than does normal bone [84], suggesting
that boron might have a beneficial effect in OA. A small 8-week
double-blind placebo-controlled RCT suggested that 6 mg/
day, taken as sodium tetraborate decahydrate, was more efficient than placebo in reducing a patients' assessment scale of
symptoms [85] (Table 4). This RCT, however, is of low quality
(Table 3); hence, longer and higher-quality RCTs are required
to evaluate thoroughly the benefits of boron for OA.
Cocktail of minerals
Sierrasil, a cocktail of 36 minerals from the Sierra Mountains in
the U.S., was tested at two doses (2 or 3 g/day) and at a dose
of 2 g/day with a cat's claw extract (100 mg/day) in an 8-week
double-blind placebo-controlled RCT on knee OA [86]. None
of these treatments was more effective at relieving symptoms
than placebo as assessed by WOMAC or VAS of pain.

Phytochemicals and plant extracts

Bromelain
Bromelain is a crude, aqueous extract obtained from both the
stems and immature fruits of the pineapple plant (Ananas
comosus Merr, mainly var Cayenne from the family of bromeliaceae), which contains a number of proteolytic enzymes. Bromelain was suggested to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
antioedematous, antithrombic, and fibrinolytic effects,
although many of the studies describing these properties were
of poor quality ([87], and reviewed in [88]). Three different
preparations containing bromelain mixed with diverse enzymes
have been tested in nine trials on knee OA ([87,89,90] for a
review and references therein). Bromelain was taken in tablets
coated to resist stomach digestion at a daily dose ranging
from 270 to 1,890 mg. All trials might have been insufficiently
powered, were of short duration (3 to 6 weeks), and enrolled
OA patients with flare-up episodes. Most used the LFI as a primary endpoint. Although bromelain was as effective or more
effective effective than 100 to 150 mg of diclofenac per day in
seven trials, it was also not more efficient than placebo in two
other trials. This absence of efficacy over placebo, coupled
with the fact that in some diclofenac-controlled trials the LFI or
other functional endpoints continued to decrease in both
groups even 4 weeks after the end of treatment [91,92], suggested a possible spontaneous resolution of the flare-up episode rather than a real efficacy of the treatment. Longer trials
of higher quality were advocated to confirm the efficacy of bromelain [87]. The best-evidence synthesis indicates a limited
evidence of efficacy based on five trials (Tables 3 and 4). Lack
of sufficiently detailed data prevented the inclusion of the four
other trials.
In one trial, a high dose of bromelain (945 mg/day) induced a
higher incidence of adverse effects and dropouts compared
with diclofenac [92], whereas in another trial, a lower dose
(270 mg/day) induced a higher dropout rate due to adverse
effects than diclofenac [90]. Together, these two reports
question the safety and tolerability of bromelain.

Rosa canina
A standardised rose-hip powder made from the seeds and
husks of the fruits from a subtype of R. canina (Hyben Vital™
produced by Hyben Vital International, Langeland, Denmark),
the common wild-briar rose of English hedgerows, was evaluated in three RCTs. In a 4-month double-blind RCT on hip and
knee OA, 2,500 mg of this powder twice a day did not improve
active or passive mobility (joint rotation, flexion, and extension)
more than placebo, except for passive hip flexion [93]. In a 3month crossover double-blind RCT, 2,500 mg of Rosa powder twice a day decreased pain (as measured by a categorical
scale) more efficiently than placebo when placebo was given
first but not when it was given second [94]. No pain difference
was found when the two groups were compared before crossover either. This RCT, which enrolled patients with OA in various joints, did not include any washout period. In a 3-month

Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/8/4/R127

crossover double-blind RCT on knee and hip OA which
included a 3-week washout period, 2,500 mg of Rosa powder
twice a day was more effective than placebo in decreasing
WOMAC pain after 3 weeks of treatment but not after 3
months [95]. The lack of significance after 3 months could
have been due to the decreased paracetamol consumption
observed when patients were under active treatment. At 3
months, the Rosa treatment decreased the WOMAC function
and stiffness subscales (secondary endpoints) more efficiently
than placebo. According to the best-evidence synthesis, there
is a lack of scientific evidence for R. canina extracts. However,
the last RCT suggests that R. canina powder might have some
efficacy. Hence, further research on this extract is required
before making any conclusion about its efficacy or lack of efficacy. No major side effects were reported in these three
RCTs.
Daily intake of 45 g of rose hip powder reduced chemotaxis of
peripheral blood neutrophils and serum creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy and OA subjects [96,97].

Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw)
H. procumbens, also called devil's claw, is a South African
plant that grows in regions bordering the Kalahari. Secondary
tuberous roots are used to prepare powders or extracts, which
were tested in several RCTs (reviewed in [98]). Product standardisation is based on the content of harpagoside, the principal compound found in the raw material. In all RCTs, the
harpagoside content was similar and greater than 50 mg/day.
In a 2-month double-blind RCT on spine and knee OA, 670 mg
of powder three times a day was more efficient than placebo
in reducing VAS of pain [99] (Table 4). In a 4-month doubleblind diacerhein-controlled RCT on hip and knee OA with
flare-up episodes at inclusion, 2.6 g of powder/day was no
less efficient than 200 mg of diacerhein per day in improving
VAS of pain [100,101]. Devil's claw was also better tolerated
than diacerhein. A systematic review of the efficacy of Harpagophytum for OA concluded that there is limited evidence of
efficacy for ethanolic extract when providing less than 30 mg
of harpagoside per day in the treatment of knee and hip OA
and moderate evidence of efficacy for the use of powder when
providing 60 mg of harpagoside daily in the treatment of spine,
hip, and knee OA [102]. The best-evidence synthesis used
here (Table 3) indicates a limited evidence of efficacy.
Whether the efficacy differs between patients with flare-up
episodes or without is currently not clear. The need for larger,
better designed RCTs with higher doses has been advocated
before making categorical recommendations for Harpagophytum [98]. No safety concerns appeared from the 4,300
patients, who received Harpagophytum products. In an uncontrolled surveillance study, 0.8 g of an aqueous extract three
times a day reduced blood sedimentation time and CRP levels
[103]. An extract reduced the IL1β-induced production of
MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins by chondrocytes [104].

Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis (cat's claw)
Cat's claw is a vine from the basin of the Amazon River. There
are two species, U. tomentosa and U. guianensis, that are traditionally used in South America for their anti-inflammatory
properties. The bark and the root are prepared as an extract in
hot water. Product standardisation is based on alkaloid content, although U. guianensis extracts are more potent than U.
tomentosa extracts in vitro despite a much lower alkaloid content [105]. Because numerous HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) fractions are biologically active in vitro, in
vivo efficacy might be due to multiple compounds.
In a small 4-week double-blind RCT on knee OA, 100 mg of
an extract from U. guianensis once a day was more efficient
than placebo in reducing pain associated with activity but not
pain at rest or at night [106] (Table 4). There was no statistical
difference between groups in reported adverse effects in this
trial, although cat's claw has been reported as nephrotoxic
[107]. According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), this
low-quality RCT does not provide scientific evidence of efficacy for cat's claw. If cat's claw is proven efficacious in the
future, a carefully controlled process of production will probably be required to prevent any nephrotoxicity.

Salix sp. (willow bark)
The anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects of willow bark have been known since antiquity. Willow bark contains salicin, which is rapidly metabolised into salicylic acid.
The acetylated derivative of salicylic acid is known as aspirin.
Willow bark extracts are usually standardised based on salicin
content even if salicin might not be the major active
compound.
In a 2-week double-blind RCT on knee and hip OA, an amount
of extract corresponding to 240 mg of salicin a day was more
efficient than placebo in reducing WOMAC pain subscore,
but the effect was small [108]. Another 6-week double-blind
RCT comparing the effects of another willow bark extract at
the same dose with placebo and diclofenac 50 mg twice a day
on knee and hip OA confirmed the efficacy of diclofenac but
failed to detect any significant difference between willow bark
and placebo on WOMAC pain subscore [109]. In another 2month RCT, a cocktail of five plants, which included 100 mg
of willow bark, failed to conclusively demonstrate an analgesic
effect [110]. Skin allergic reactions have been linked to Salix
ingestion in 3% to 11% of patients [111]. The best-evidence
synthesis (Table 3) indicates a lack of evidence of efficacy for
Salix extracts.

Ginger and turmeric
The Zingiberaceae family includes gingers and turmerics. Ginger is a very popular spice with a world production of 100,000
tons a year. It is used in traditional Japanese Kampo,
Ayurvedic, and Chinese medicine as an anti-inflammatory
agent for musculoskeletal diseases. Three RCTs evaluated

ginger extracts prepared from the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale and Alpinia galanga.
In a double-blind RCT on knee OA, after crossover at 6
months, but not at 3 months before crossover, 250 mg of an
extract of Z. officinale four times a day reduced VAS of pain
and handicap more efficiently than placebo [112]. In a 6-week
double-blind RCT on knee OA, 255 mg of an extract of Z. officinale and A. galanga twice a day was more efficient than placebo in reducing knee pain on standing up based on the
percentage of responders [113]. The RCT suffered from
incomplete blinding, and the beneficial effects were small and
not observed on WOMAC and quality of life [114]. Finally, a 3month three-way crossover double-blind RCT compared the
efficacy of another ginger extract with ibuprofen and placebo
in knee and hip OA but failed to demonstrate a difference
between placebo and ginger extract as assessed by VAS of
pain and LFI [115]. The best-evidence synthesis (Table 3) indicates a lack of evidence of efficacy. In two RCTs, a higher
number of adverse effects and higher dropout rates related to
adverse effects in ginger groups [112,113] question the
safety of these extracts.
In vitro, ginger extract decreased the IL1β- and LPS-induced
production of NO and PGE2 by OA cartilage [116]. In synoviocytes, it decreased the IL1β- or TNF-α-induced expression of
TNF-α mRNA and protein, the TNF-α-induced production of
COX2, and the TNF-α-induced activation of nuclear factor
(NF)-κB by reducing the protein level of the NF-κB inhibitor
IκB [117].
An extract prepared from the Indian and Javanese turmerics
Curcuma domestica and Curcuma xanthorriza, was tested on
hip and elbow OA in an 8-week double-blind randomised trial
in dogs [118]. No significant difference on the kinetic gait analysis was found between extract and placebo.

Flavonoids
Flavonoids, a group of polyphenolic compounds widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom, are thought to contribute
to the health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables. The
in vivo effects of several flavonoids (tea-containing catechins,
soy isoflavones) have been reported in the literature.
The effect of tipi tea (Petiveria alliacea), a tea used as an
antirheumatic medicine, on knee and hip OA was evaluated in
a small 1-week crossover double-blind RCT against a placebo
tea [119]. No significant differences as assessed in pain
scores or functional assessment were found.
Regarding isoflavones, a 3-month double-blind RCT on knee
OA failed to show that 40 g daily of soy protein, containing a
total of 88 mg of soy isoflavones, was more efficient than a
milk-based protein placebo in reducing symptoms as
assessed by questionnaires on pain and quality of life [120].

Page 16 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

Use of milk-based proteins as a placebo is confounding
because milk could be effective in OA (see 'Milk and hyperimmune milk' section). Soy but not milk proteins increased serum
levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, an anabolic factor for
chondrocytes.
Boswellia serrata
The gummy oleoresin from the bark of B. serrata, a tree from
northwest India, is used for inflammatory diseases in Ayurvedic
medicine. In an 8-week double-blind crossover RCT on knee
OA, 333 mg of the gum three times a day was more efficient
than placebo in reducing pain, loss of movement, and swelling
scores [121]. In a 3-month double-blind RCT, 500 mg three
times a day of a cocktail of B. serrata and turmeric (Curcuma
longa) decreased categorical scales of joint pain, tenderness,
and effusion [122]. According to the best-evidence synthesis,
these RCTs provide no evidence of efficacy (Table 3).

B. serrata in combination with an extract from the root of Withania somnifera, the oleoresin of C. longa, and a zinc complex
was tested in a 6-month double-blind crossover RCT [123];
650 mg twice a day of this cocktail, called Articulin-F, was
more efficient than placebo in reducing pain and disability
scores. According to the best-evidence synthesis, this RCT
indicates a lack of evidence of efficacy (Table 3).
Cocktails of plant extracts
SKI306X is a cocktail of extracts prepared from three plants
(dried roots from Clematis mandshurica and Trichosantes kirilowii and dried flower and stem from Prunella vulgaris) used
for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in Far East Asia. It
is clinically approved for the treatment of OA in Korea [124].
In a 4-week double-blind RCT on knee OA, 200, 400, and 600
mg three times a day were more efficient than placebo in
reducing VAS of pain, with no significant difference between
the three doses [125] (Table 4). In another 4-week doubleblind RCT on knee OA, 200 mg three times a day was not less
efficient than 100 mg of diclofenac (sustained release) once a
day in reducing VAS of pain [126]. According to the best-evidence synthesis, these two high-quality RCTs provide moderate evidence for the efficacy of SKI306X in OA. Although
generally well tolerated, three severe adverse events occurred
in the SKI306X group (compared with 11 for diclofenac).

In rats, SKI306X did not cause significant gastric damage up
to an oral dose of 2 g/kg and suppressed the diclofenac
induced gastric damage [124]. In rabbits, 200 mg/kg per day
reduced the OA-like histological changes in collagenaseinjected knees [127]. In vitro, SKI306X and the T. kirilowii
extract, but not the other two plant extracts, reduced the IL1αinduced GAG release [127]. Synergistic effects between the
three extracts present in SKI306X are suspected because the
proportion of T. kirilowii is insufficient to fully explain the product potency.

The effects of Gitadyl, an herbal formulation containing
extracts from feverfew, American aspen, and milfoil, at a dose
of 260 mg three times a day were compared with the effects
of 400 mg of ibuprofen three times a day in a 42-day doubleblind crossover RCT. Both treatments failed to significantly
change pain or the patients' ability to walk as assessed by four
point scales [128].
In a 4-week double-blind RCT on knee OA, 3 g three times a
day of Duhuo Jisheng Wan, a traditional Chinese cocktail of
15 plants, improved the LFI and multiple VAS of pain and stiffness as efficiently as 25 mg of diclofenac three times a day
[129] (Table 4). Duhuo Jisheng Wan had a slower onset of
action than diclofenac but an equal rate of adverse events, an
observation that questions its safety. According to the bestevidence synthesis, there is limited scientific evidence to support the efficacy of Duhuo Jisheng Wan (Table 3).

groups makes the placebo group of this RCT useless.
Because none of these trials used regular milk as placebo, it is
not known if hyperimmune milk has an effect different than regular milk. According to the best-evidence synthesis, there is a
lack of scientific evidence of efficacy for hyperimmune milk.
In an 8-week RCT on dogs with musculoskeletal impairment,
1 g twice a day was more efficient than placebo in improving
function as assessed by a newly developed questionnaire
addressed to the pet owners [136]. Veterinarians' examination
did not confirm these results. The absence of a precise diagnostic at enrolment and of any validation of the questionnaire
limits the relevance of this study.

Collagen hydrolysate
Collagen hydrolysate is produced by enzymatic digestion of
gelatin, which itself is produced by hydrolysis of collagen
extracted from animal bones and skin.

Others

Methylsulfonylmethane
Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is the oxidised form of dimethyl
sulfoxide. It is found in very low amounts in fruits, corn, tomatoes, tea, coffee, and milk. Two RCTs qualified to be evaluated
in this systematic review (Table 4). In a 12-week double-blind
placebo-controlled RCT on knee OA, 500 mg of MSM three
times a day, used alone or in combination with 500 mg of
glucosamine HCl three times a day, significantly improved a
Likert scale of pain and LFI [130]. The combination of both
ingredients was not more efficacious than each ingredient
used alone. In a second 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled RCT on knee OA, 3 g of MSM given twice daily was
more efficient than placebo in decreasing WOMAC pain and
functional scores [131]. According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), MSM provides moderate evidence of efficacy
for knee OA.
Milk and hyperimmune milk
A cross-sectional epidemiological study suggested that the
frequency of symptomatic knee OA was lower in milk consumers [132] but did not take into account body mass index, an
important potential confounding factor [133]. Although no trial
tested regular milk, one canine and two human double-blind
RCTs tested hyperimmune milk. This milk is produced by cows
that are immunised with intestinal bacteria antigens. It is
enriched in high-molecular weight immunoglobulins (IgG) and
is claimed to contain anti-inflammatory low-molecular weight
components. A concentrated form of this milk was used in the
RCTs. A 6-week human RCT failed to show that 355 ml a day
of a fruit-flavoured beverage fortified with hyperimmune milk,
vitamins B12, C, and E, and iron and zinc was more efficient
than placebo in improving WOMAC [134]. In a 6-week threearm RCT, 2 g twice a day of the milk preparation was not less
efficient than 500 mg three times a day of glucosamine sulfate
in improving WOMAC [135]. Unfortunately, a difference in
symptomatic basal levels between treatment and placebo

In a 24-week multi-country double-blind placebo-controlled
RCT on knee OA, 10 g/day did not improve the WOMAC
index [137]. The dropout rate was high. Post hoc analysis suggested that the hydrolysate could be more efficient in severe
OA. A 60-day double-blind crossover placebo-controlled RCT
on knee and hip OA compared 10 g/day of collagen hydrolysate, gelatin, gelatin + glycin + CaHPO4*2H2O, or egg albumin [138]. The gelatin preparations were not significantly
different from each other and were superior to egg albumin in
reducing pain as assessed by a patient questionnaire. According to the best-evidence synthesis (Table 3), these two RCTs
lack evidence of efficacy for collagen hydrolysate.
In vitro, type I or type II collagen hydrolysate dose-dependently
increased type II collagen synthesis by chondrocytes, whereas
native collagen and collagen-free hydrolysate did not [139].
The average molecular weight of collagen peptides in the
hydrolysate ranges from 2 to 6 kDa. Ex vivo intestinal sac
experiments suggested that peptides up to 15 kDa can be
absorbed. In mice, a significant and long-lasting (>96 hours)
accumulation of 14C-labeled collagen hydrolysate was
observed in articular cartilage compared with 14C-labeled proline [140].

Discussion
Fifty-three RCTs investigating the effects of functional ingredients in OA met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review.
The functional ingredients tested in these RCTs were lipids
(ASUs, n-3 PUFAs, lipid extracts from New Zealand greenlipped mussel, and cetyl myristoleate), vitamins and minerals
(vitamins C, E, B3, and B12, boron, a cocktail of vitamins and
selenium, and a cocktail of minerals), plant extracts (bromelain,
R. canina, H. procumbens, U. tomentosa and U. guianensis,
Salix sp., ginger, turmerics, tipi tea, soy proteins, and B. serrata), a cocktail of plant extracts (SKI306X, Gitadyl, Duhua
Jushing Wan, and Articulin-F), and a few other types of

ingredients (methylsulfonlymethane, hyperimmune milk, and
collagen hydrolysate). Eighteen of these functional ingredients
had their efficacy supported by at least one RCT (Table 3).
To summarise the strength of scientific evidence behind a
functional ingredient, we used a mathematically based bestevidence synthesis. This best-evidence synthesis allowed us
to categorise the functional ingredients as having a limited,
moderate, or good record of efficacy. According to this bestevidence synthesis (Table 3), good evidence exists for ASUs.
Moderate evidence exists for methylsulfonylmethane and
SKI306X, a cocktail of plant extracts. Limited evidence exists
for the Chinese cocktail of plant extracts Duhuo Jisheng Wan,
for cetyl myristoleate, for lipids from green-lipped mussels, and
for plant extracts from H. procumbens. Limited evidence also
exists for vitamins B3 and C and bromelain, but the small
effects obtained, the high doses used, or the experimental
design employed questions the clinical relevance and/or
safety of these functional ingredients. The other interventions
lacked scientific evidence either because of their rather poor
design or because of contradicting available evidence. Among
these interventions that lacked evidence of efficacy, vit E is
unique: it is the only nutritional intervention whose lack of
symptom-modifying and structure-modifying effects in knee
OA is reported in high-quality RCTs. Despite the fact that our
best-evidence synthesis considers each functional ingredient
as a single entity, the evidence of efficacy and the safety
record of plant extracts should be considered to be productspecific given that the composition of an extract from a same
plant can vary widely between manufacturers.
All 18 functional ingredients evaluated in Table 3 were tested
under a nutraceutical/dietary supplement form in the RCTs,
except for hyperimmune milk incorporated in a functional drink.
Depending on the regulatory laws of each country, these functional ingredients are sold as drugs, nutraceuticals (dietary
supplements), or functional foods in association with health
claims of variable strength. Although most ingredients are sold
mostly as nutraceuticals today, some such as SKI306X and
ASUs require a prescription and are sold as drugs, at least in
some countries (Korea for SKI306X and several European
countries for ASU). Similarly, the vitamins and some of the lipids reviewed here are sold mostly as nutraceuticals but can
also be incorporated in functional foods (up to a country-specific defined maximal dose) because they have GRAS (generally recognised as safe) status. Regarding collagen
hydrolysate specifically, its GRAS status and its advertised
therapeutic dose (10 g) make it more practical to be used in a
functional food than in a nutraceutical. Ideally, the efficacy of a
functional food should be directly evaluated in an RCT (by providing to the enrolled patients the final commercial product)
because the incorporation of a functional ingredient into a
complex food matrix could potentially modify its efficacy, either
by increasing or on the contrary by decreasing its
bioavailability.

Conclusion
In summary, this review demonstrates that nutrition can
improve the symptoms of declared OA. However, the role of
nutrition in slowing down progression of the disease remains
to be seen. The very few RCTs, which used structure-modifying variables as primary endpoints, were unable to demonstrate a benefit, but the area deserves further investigation. As
a whole, nutritional research in OA is only in its infancy. Only a
few ingredients have been tested, and research remains
based mainly on a pharmacological type of approach (one molecule/one target) rather than on a nutritional, more holistic type
of approach (multiple ingredients/multiple targets). The full
potency of nutrition for patients with declared OA thus remains
to be evaluated. In parallel, and except for a few longitudinal
epidemiological studies on vitamins, no study has evaluated
the value of nutrition in the prevention of OA. Although these
studies are of utmost importance, the size, the duration, and
hence the prohibitive cost of such studies, particularly in the
form of human intervention trials, keep them beyond our reach
for the time being. This situation will probably persist at least
until we considerably improve our prognostic tools to detect
those 'healthy' subjects at high risk of developing OA in their
near future.

Appendix
Comparative discussion on the value of the Jadad and
OA scores to evaluate the quality of clinical trials on OA
To evaluate the quality of the RCTs, we used two scores: the
previously validated Jadad score [21], which can be used to
score any type of clinical trials, and a new OA score designed
especially for this study and tailor-made for OA clinical trials.
According to these two scoring systems, the quality of the
RCTs was highly heterogeneous. Based on the OA score, the
quality of the trials ranged from 33% to 100% (with a mean of
65 and a median of 67) (Table 2). Based on the Jadad score,
the quality of the trials ranged from 20% (that is, a score of 1
out of a possible maximum of 5) to 100% (that is, a score of 5)
with an average and median score of 80%. Conceptual differences in design exist between the two scoring systems. The
Jadad score evaluates only the randomisation method, the
double-blinding method, and the report of dropouts, whereas
the OA score is more comprehensive. Between the two
authors, the reproducibilities of the two instruments were similar (approximately 92%–93%). Although the two scores were
overall quite consistent with each other, divergence sometimes emerged between them due to their different designs
([47,72,85,110,115,121,135]; Table 3). Due to its higher
complexity, the OA score was more powerful than the Jadad
score in discriminating the quality of the trials. Indeed, several
trials, despite a maximal Jadad score and 1 point allocated to
the three criteria of the OA score evaluated in the Jadad score
(that is, criteria numbers 4, 6, and 11), ended up with very different OA scores, ranging from 0.42 to 1 (compare, for example, the scores of [26] and [47] in Table 3). Based on this
observation and in agreement with published guidelines

Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/8/4/R127

recommending the development and use of disease-specific
scoring systems for systematic reviews [141], the OA score
seems more accurate than the Jadad score in evaluating the
quality of RCTs on OA.
