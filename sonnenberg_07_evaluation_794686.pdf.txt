Abstract
Background: Identification of species via DNA sequences is the basis for DNA taxonomy and
DNA barcoding. Currently there is a strong focus on using a mitochondrial marker for this
purpose, in particular a fragment from the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). While there is ample
evidence that this marker is indeed suitable across a broad taxonomic range to delineate species,
it has also become clear that a complementation by a nuclear marker system could be
advantageous. Ribosomal RNA genes could be suitable for this purpose, because of their global
occurrence and the possibility to design universal primers. However, it has so far been assumed
that these genes are too highly conserved to allow resolution at, or even beyond the species level.
On the other hand, it is known that ribosomal gene regions harbour also highly divergent parts.
We explore here the information content of two adjacent divergence regions of the large subunit
ribosomal gene, the D1-D2 region.
Results: Universal primers were designed to amplify the D1-D2 region from all metazoa. We show
that amplification products in the size between 800–1300 bp can be obtained across a broad range
of animal taxa, provided some optimizations of the PCR procedure are implemented. Although the
ribosomal genes occur in multiple copies in the genomes, we find generally very little intraindividual polymorphism (<< 0.1% on average) indicating that concerted evolution is very effective
in most cases. Studies in two fish taxa (genus Cottus and genus Aphyosemion) show that the D1-D2
LSU sequence can resolve even very closely related species with the same fidelity as COI
sequences. In one case we can even show that a mitochondrial transfer must have occurred, since
the nuclear sequence confirms the taxonomic assignment, while the mitochondrial sequence would
have led to the wrong classification. We have further explored whether hybrids between species
can be detected with the nuclear sequence and we show for a test case of natural hybrids among
cyprinid fish species (Alburnus alburnus and Rutilus rutilus) that this is indeed possible.
Conclusion: The D1-D2 LSU region is a suitable marker region for applications in DNA based
species identification and should be considered to be routinely used as a marker complementing
broad scale studies based on mitochondrial markers.

Background

Results

The use of DNA sequences as a tool for the identification
of species has been widely discussed in the past years [16]. One important step in implementing a DNA taxonomy or DNA barcoding system is the choice of appropriate markers. There is currently a preference for the COI
gene, a mitochondrial protein, as the marker of choice for
animals [1]. But other markers have also been suggested,
for example the nuclear rDNA [4,7,8] or the mitochondrial LSU gene (16S rDNA) [9]. It is generally expected
that mitochondrial markers could provide a better resolution, because their maternal inheritance results in a
smaller effective population size and hence a faster fixation of neutral mutations. However, mitochondrial markers might not always reflect the full history of a species
[10]. Nuclear markers, on the other hand, underlie recombination and are therefore less suitable to trace phylogenetic lineages within species.

Primer selection
For a survey of meiobenthos organisms we have previously used the D3-D5 expansion segment of the LSU as a
signature sequence [7], which has yielded good taxonomic resolution as well as reasonably good phylogenies.
However, the fragment includes relatively long highly
conserved stretches and we have therefore assessed here
the D1-D2 region as an alternative fragment that could
potentially yield an even higher resolution. Figure 1
shows a comparison of the relative conservation of the
different rRNA regions. It is evident that the D1-D2 region
belongs to the most divergent parts, although it contains
also some highly conserved stretches that allow the selection of universal primers.

Apart from the question of choosing the appropriate
marker type, there are also general problems with relying
on a single marker system only, most notably the possibility of hybridization among lineages. Contrary to a common perception of species being entirely independent
from one another, the units that are commonly considered 'species' hybridise frequently in nature [11-14]. Several model systems for interspecific hybridisation have
been studied using multiple genetic markers, which suggest that mitochondrial haplotypes and possibly also
nuclear genes can be exchanged between distinct species
in the course of hybridisation events [15-17]. Even in the
absence of hybridisation, incomplete lineage sorting can
result in shared ancestral haplotype lineages beyond speciation events [18]. The relevance of these problems in the
context of taxonomic applications has been well recognized [2,19], but has so far been very little addressed with
respect to developing appropriate comparative markers.
Here we evaluate the utility of the large subunit ribosomal
rRNA (LSU) as a potential marker for species identification. The LSU is part of the rDNA gene complex which
occurs in tandem repeats, arranged in ribosomal clusters
in the nuclear genome [20]. Ribosomal genes are generally considered to be highly conserved, but they are actually composed of a mixture of conserved and divergent
regions. These have been called "divergence regions – D"
and are numbered in 5'to 3'direction of the mature rRNA
[21]. In the present paper we report primers and protocols
that permit the amplification of a highly variable part of
the nuclear rDNA. We find that the variation in the LSU
D1-D2 fragment permits its use in DNA barcoding
approaches for a wide variety of metazoa. In addition to
this general utility, we explore the use of ribosomal genes
to directly identify hybrids, which would not be possible
with mitochondrial markers alone.

We have retrieved sequences spanning the D1-D2 region
of the LSU from diverse metazoan taxa from GenBank and
aligned them to identify sequence blocks that are suitable
for primer development. Primers were chosen for the
most conserved blocks, aiming to identify primers which
could be used in very broad range of taxa (with a focus on
metazoa, but may also work in all eukaryotes). A few such
truly universal primers were identified, but in some cases
we had to distinguish between vertebrate and invertebrate
primers (Figure 2). The primers were tested on a large
range of diverse animal taxa (Table 1) to verify their utility
and to find the range of fragment sizes that are to be
expected. The outer primers depicted in Figure 2 amplify
a fragment of 800–1300 bp, the inner primers can be used
for sequencing. Interestingly, the outer primer rev1, which
was designed for vertebrates works also with most invertebrates. For those cases where it did not work in invertebrates, we used rev2 as the outer primer.
Amplification efficiency
We found that the invertebrate sequences could generally
be amplified with standard protocols. However, vertebrate samples were generally more difficult to amplify,
which cannot only be ascribed to major size differences.
Interestingly, DNA traces originating from vertebrate
commensals or parasites in DNA extracts were sometimes
amplified, while the host sequences were not. We found
that residual ribosomal rRNA was a major inhibitor in
these cases, since extensive RNAseA digestion of the DNA
samples leads to a much better amplification success.
Since the same treatment leads also to improved results
with invertebrate samples, we have included this in the
recommended standard procedure.

Apart of the removal of rRNA we found that the addition
of PCR enhancer buffers (see Methods) leads to significantly improved amplification of many rDNA templates,
which is in agreement with the observations of Ralser et
al. [22]. This is most likely related to high GC content and

Figure organisation of eukaryotic ribosomal genes
General 1
General organisation of eukaryotic ribosomal genes. All eukaryotes show a stereotypic arrangement, with often hundreds of
tandemly repeated ribosomal transcription units. Each produces a large transcript which is processed into the small subunit,
the 5.8S subunit and the large subunit. The external transcribed spacer (ETS) and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and
ITS2) do not become part of the mature rRNA, but their sequences and structures are required for the correct processing.
The dot plot comparisons above the SSU and the LSU show the conservation profiles between a chordate and an arthropod
sequence. In this presentation, the sequences of two species (mouse and Drosophila) are compared and a dot is placed in the
diagram at each position where 10 consecutive nucleotides match. Conserved and divergent regions become thus directly
apparent. It is evident that the SSU is more conserved, interrupted by a few less conserved regions, while the LSU show larger
regions of divergence.
pronounced secondary structure of our target gene.
Finally, single strand binding (SSB)-protein was found to
further improve the quality of the PCR product but is not
a necessary additive in most reactions.
Further optimizations will still be necessary for some taxa.
Most notably, we found that samples from mammals,
birds and amphibians are difficult to amplify, i.e. the success rate is low.
Sequence polymorphisms
Ribosomal genes are subject to concerted evolution,
which ensures that the multiple copies present in the
genome retain more or less identical sequences [23,24].
Still, there may be concerns that the concerted evolution

process may not be sufficiently effective to ensure complete sequence homogeneity. We have therefore carefully
checked our sequence reads for signs of ambiguity, which
would be indicative of incomplete homogenization.
Among approx. 230 fragments analysed in this way, we
found 15 where a single ambiguous position was identified in both sequencing directions (compare Figure 3), six
where two such positions were found and four with three
ambiguities. In a few cases we found more ambiguities
(up to 9) [see additional file 1], but it is possible that these
samples were contaminated with DNA from closely
related species (nematodes). This implies that much less
than 0.1% of the sequence positions surveyed are polymorphic on average, although this may vary in some taxa.
Nonetheless, this number suggests that insufficient

homogenization is not a significant problem for D1-D2
sequences.
Taxon assignment
Information about the affinities of a given sequence was
obtained by conducting BLAST searches (blastn) [25]
against the GenBank database [26] and by using simple
neighbour joining clustering based on uncorrected p-distances with MEGA 3.1 [27]. We found that the phylogenetic signal in the data is sufficient to group most
sequences into taxa that are known to be monophyletic,
although deep phylogenetic relationships of this tree
appeared not to be very reliable (not shown). However,
given our focus on a highly variable part of the LSU, we
would not have expected to retrieve reliable deep level
phylogeny resolution from this anyway. Still, the information content of the D1-D2 region is sufficient to place new
sequences into the right phylogenetic context.
Species identification
The most important consideration for the utility of a
marker is its ability to discriminate between closely
related species. We have therefore obtained the D1-D2
LSU sequences from two taxonomically well studied fish
groups and compared these to mitochondrial COI
sequences from the same animals. The first group includes
species of the genus Cottus, which occur in streams
throughout the northern hemisphere. In a recent taxonomic survey of the species in Middle Europe, 15 species
were distinguished on the basis of diagnostic morphological and molecular characters [28]. Figure 4 shows a comparison between the LSU sequences and the
mitochondrial sequences for a subset of these species,
including several population samples from three of them.
It is evident that although the general level of divergence
is lower for the LSU sequences (note different scales), the
same species and the same populations are identified with
both markers in most cases. The only exception is the sam-

ple "RotesW", which is grouped with Cottus gobio for the
COI sequence and with Cottus rhenanus for the LSU
sequence. The origin of the sample, as well as additional
molecular markers [15] show that the respective specimen
belongs to Cottus rhenanus [28], i.e. this is a clear case
where a mitochondrial transfer has occurred in the past.
The phylogenetic relationships recovered by the two
markers show general congruence, but are not identical
for all nodes. We have so far no further markers, which
could be used to resolve these conflicts, i.e. it is not possible to say whether the LSU or the mtDNA sequences are
more reliable in this respect.
The second group is a monophyletic species group (Sonnenberg et al. in prep.) within the large genus Aphyosemion
sensu lato. These are small fish (ca. 4–5 cm standard
length) which live in little forest creeks in the coastal plain
from Benin to Cabinda (Angola). Currently nine species
and one subspecies are recognized based on diagnostic
characters of male colour patterns. Figure 5 shows a comparison between the LSU data and the mitochondrial
sequences of all nine recognized species. The sampling
contains several populations of species with larger distribution areas (A. ahli [Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea], A.
australe [Gabon to Cabinda (Angola)], A. calliurum [Benin
to Cameroon]). A. edeanum, A. festivum, A. heinemanni and
A. pascheni are represented by a single population. Especially the latter three are only known from small areas and
all four together with A. celiae and A. franzwerneri are
endemic to Cameroon [29]. Despite a lower sequence
divergence level, the LSU dataset shows the same clustering of species samples. Aphyosemion ahli and A. calliurum
are both paraphyletic with respect to A. edeanum for the
former and A. celiae for the latter species. As with the Cottus example, there are conflicts with the phylogenetic relationships between species for the two markers (e.g. A.
heinemanni, A. australe) but this depends on the method of
phylogenetic inference (NJ, exclusion of gaps and missing
data, model of sequence evolution, statistical tests etc.) or
insufficient phylogenetic signal and it is still open which
of them may be more accurate.
Evaluation of hybrids
To evaluate the performance of the LSU marker in cases of
hybrid animals, we have first generated artificial F1
hybrids between Cottus perifretum and Cottus rhenanus.
These two parental species show diagnostic differences in
the D1-D2 region. The electropherograms of the hybrid
animals were found to display double peaks at these positions (Figure 6), which reflect their hybrid status. Interestingly, however, the height of these double peaks differed
between the animals. This suggests that the rDNA repeat
units may not be inherited in simple Mendelian patterns,
at least not in hybrids between species. Although this
presents a complication which needs to be further stud-

cated by3a red for ambiguous sequence positions in the forward and reverse sequencing direction of the same fragment (indiTwo examples arrow)
Two examples for ambiguous sequence positions in the forward and reverse sequencing direction of the same fragment (indicated by a red arrow). We interpret these ambiguities as polymorphic positions among the rDNA repeat units within an animal. Given that these ambiguities are very rare (see text), one can conclude that homogenization is usually very efficient.

ied, the presence of such double peaks can indicate a
hybrid status, provided one finds the corresponding parent species that have fixed nucleotides at the respective
positions.
To assess this approach for a naturally occurring situation,
we have evaluated it for fish species pair, where the frequent occurrence of F1 hybrid animals has been previously suspected [30]. These are two Cyprinid fish species,
Rutilus rutilus and Alburnus alburnus, which occur in many
European streams. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the
phenotypes of the parental species and the possible
hybrid. The trace pictures of the LSU sequences at three
diagnostic sites are shown next to them. It is evident that
the suspected hybrid has indeed a mixture of both ribosomal types. This confirms the special utility of rRNA
sequences for detecting hybrids.

Discussion
Our data provide evidence that the D1-D2 region can be
readily amplified from a wide range of taxa and that it
contains sufficient phylogenetic information to allow

assignment to related taxa. At the same time the D1-D2
region appears to carry sufficient variability to distinguish
congeneric species although we have so far shown this
only for two fish groups. However, at least one of these
two groups may be considered as a taxonomic test case
because of their close relationships. The Cottus gobio complex has previously been considered to represent a single
pan-European species. Only a recent taxonomic revision
has challenged this view [28,41]. The D1-D2 LSU
sequence clusters correspond to the newly described species confirming that a high level resolution is indeed possible with this gene region.
It is noteworthy that much of the variation in the D1-D2
region is found in length variable parts. While such indels
cause a problem with alignments for deep phylogenetic
inferences, they should be considered as an advantage for
taxonomic purposes, since they add another character
state beyond transitions and transversions. Moreover,
indels may be particularly suitable for fast determination
assays independent of sequencing, such as microarrays
[7].

A comparison between LSU and mtDNA sequences with respect to species level resolution for the genus Cottus
A comparison between LSU and mtDNA sequences with respect to species level resolution for the genus Cottus. Twelve species of the genus Cottus were sequenced for both markers and trees were obtained via the neighbour joining algorithm in
MEGA 3.1. For three species, multiple animals from given populations were sequenced. Both markers detect the same groupings, with the exception of the animals from the population "RotesW", where COI sequences generate a different assignment.
Further analysis of this case has shown that this is due to mitochondrial transfer.

Potential problems associated with the use of ribosomal
genes
Ribosomal genes are organized in clusters that contain
hundreds of copies per haploid genome. It is generally
assumed that these evolve in concert [23,24]. Evidently,
intra-genomic variation among these copies could cause
problems. However, we have generally observed a low
level of ambiguities in our sequences.

Another potential problem in studies of rDNA genes is the
occurrence of pseudogenes. Recent studies show that this
is a particular problem for the ITS region in animals and
plants where it may confound phylogenetic inferences
[31,32]. Similarly, multiple variants for the SSU gene were
found in sturgeons [33,34], a Platyhelminth [35] and a
dinoflagellate [36]. However, both the study by Keller et
al. [31] and by Fuerst and Krieger [33] suggest that only
the functional variants are expressed at high levels and
that these are not polymorphic. Hence, in cases where evidence for pseudogenes is found, it may be useful to
directly sequence the ribosomal RNA to assess which of
the sequence variants is the functional one.
We note that both problems listed here apply in a similar
way also to mitochondrial markers. Insufficient homogenization of rDNA repeats can be compared to heteroplasmy of different mitochondrial haplotypes in a single

organism (reviewed in [37]) and rDNA pseudogenes can
be compared to nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes
(e.g. [38,39]). Thus, for either marker system one has to be
aware that complications can arise through these phenomena, although they are not so frequent that they
would seriously compromise their broad applicability.
rDNA variation and taxonomic group delimitation
Any new sequence variant in rDNA has to be homogenized across at least most of the other rDNA repeats before
it becomes detectable. This homogenization is most likely
achieved by a succession of many unequal cross-over
events within the rDNA cluster. Hence, new alleles should
only become visible after some time of genetic exchange
has passed in an interbreeding population. However, it is
currently not clear how long it takes to fix a new variant,
or even whether this occurs predominantly via intra- or
interchromosomal homogenization [40]. But in any case,
a new fixed variant can be seen as a reflection of an
extended history of interbreeding in a given population.
Accordingly, even a single mutational difference in rDNA
may be taken as an informative character that could
potentially delineate a new group.

For mitochondrial DNA analysis it was suggested that a
threshold level of intraspecies versus interspecies variance
is used as a proxy to identify groups or species [1]. How-

ever, species recognition (as well as the underlying concepts) is not only an issue of distances but also of
distinctness (e.g. [41]). Taxonomic resolution in the context of alpha taxonomy is either present or not and is basically given once a single diagnostic character can be
identified. In the case of Cottus, we found that the different
rDNA variants depicted in Fig. 4 correspond to animals
from different streams and that one usually finds only one
variant per stream, at least in the cases where the respective data are available. Thus, a separate group recognition
based on molecular differences as small as a single substitution is corroborated by their allopatric occurrence and
their presumably independent evolution since several
thousand years. Accordingly, single nucleotide differences
in rDNA genes may be considered as a first indicator of
genetic separation. In cases where the respective groups

occur under sympatric conditions, it may even be an indicator of incipient speciation. Clearly, this issue has to be
further explored, but these considerations show that the
collection of sequences from the coding parts of the ribosomal genes may provide an additional value for taxon
delimitation.

Conclusion
Our results show that the D1-D2 region of the LSU rDNA
gene has the potential to be developed as a taxonomic
marker. It can be amplified with truly universal primers
and shows a divergence rate, which is suitable to differentiate even closely related species. Because it is bi-parentally inherited, it can also be used for detecting hybrids
and their corresponding parental species. It appears therefore that it could be an ideal marker for complementing

sequences.

Materials and methods
Macrozoobenthos invertebrates were collected and determined by M. Hess (Munich), nematodes were obtained as
cultures from E. Schierenberg (Cologne), most fish material and some invertebrates were collected and/or determined by AN and RS, the Galaxias and Brachygalaxias
samples by K. Busse (Bonn). F1 Hybrids of Cottus were
produced in the aquarium as described in Stemshorn et al.
[42].
For most samples total DNA was extracted from ethanol
preserved or fresh material using a standard Proteinase-K
in SDS/EDTA buffer [tissue digestion in 500 µL HOM
buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 80 mM EDTA pH
8.0) and 5 µL Proteinase-K (20 mg/mL) for at least 3 h at
55°C; addition of 500 µL NaCl (4.5 M) and 300 µL Chloroform, gentle mixing for 15 min.; centrifugation for 10
min. at 10.000 rpm, transfer of upper phase (750 µL)
without interphase in new tube; precipitation with 750 µL
99% Ethanol, gentle mixing and incubation at room temperature for 5 min., centrifugation for 10 min. at 13.000
rpm, removal of supernatant; 2× washing of the pellet
with 500 µL 70% Ethanol, incubation at room temperature for 5 min., centrifugation for 10 min. at 13.000 rpm,
complete removal of supernatant; airdried pellet dissolved in 100 µL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM

EDTA pH8.0)]. Alternatively, we used a standard CTAB
buffer protocol [tissue digestion in 500 µL 2% CTAB
buffer (2 g/100 mL CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl,
20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and 15 µL Proteinase-K (20 mg/
mL) for 1 h – overnight at 64°C; 2× extraction with Chloroform/Isoamylalcohol (24:1), gentle mixing for 10 min.,
centrifugation for 10 min. at 13.000 rpm, transfer of
upper phase without interphase in new tube; precipitation
with 400 µL 98% Ethanol, incubation at room temperature for 1 h, centrifugation for 20 min. at 13.000 rpm,
removal of supernatant; 2× washing of the pellet with 500
µL 75% Ethanol, centrifugation for 10 min. at 13.000
rpm, complete removal of supernatant; airdried pellet
solved in 50–100 µL TE]. For some samples we used also
DNA isolated with a commercial kit (procedure according
to the manufacturer; Qiagen, Düsseldorf) or released the
DNA with a Chelex/Proteinase-K protocol (500 µL 5%
Chelex suspension, 10 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml]) incubation 1 h to overnight at 64°C, 15 min. 95°C denaturation of Proteinase-K (important for the following RNAseA
treatment). RNA was digested for all samples with RNAseA (10 mg/ml, Fermentas) before PCR reactions. We
added to 50 µL DNA solution 2 µl Fermentas RNAseA and
incubated for 1–3 h at room temperature.
Primers were designed according to partial or complete
LSU rDNA sequences from GenBank for a variety of taxa,
ranging from plathelminths, nematodes and arthropods
to vertebrates. Primer sequences are listed in Figure 2.

Hybrid status analysis in a natural case
Hybrid status analysis in a natural case. Samples were obtained from pure species of R. rutilus and A. alburnus, as well as from a
suspected hybrid animal. The sequence traces show diagnostic positions for the two species and confirm double peaks at the
respective positions for the apparent hybrid animal.

PCR conditions were tested with temperature and MgCl2
gradients. Amplification of LSU fragments were considerably enhanced by the addition of Q-solution (Qiagen,
Düsseldorf) and single strand binding Protein (SSB,
Sigma Aldrich). Final concentration of Q-solution is 1×
(from 5× stock) and 1 µg SSB protein in a 20 µl PCR reaction mix.
The following PCR program was used to amplify the D1D2 fragments: 4 min. at 94°C for initial denaturation; 45
cycles with 20 sec. 94°C, 20 sec. 52,5°C and 90 sec. 72°C,
followed by 8 min. at 72°C for final extension. For most
fragments we used the primer combination fw1 and rev1,
some invertebrates amplified better with the combination
fw1 and rev2.

In addition we amplified and sequenced a COI fragment
currently applied in DNA barcoding applications for a
sample of Cottus and the species of the Aphyosemion calliurum group (Cyprinodontiformes: Nothobranchiidae) for
comparison with the LSU fragment. PCR primer for the
amplification of the COI fragment for these taxa were
taken from the literature (HCO-2198 [1,43]) or designed
according to published complete mitochondrial
sequences and own data for the Cottus samples and the A.

All Aphyosemion and Cottus COI PCR reactions are done in
15 microliter reactions with the Qiagen Multiplex PCR
Kit, including 3 microliter Q-Solution and 0.5 microliter
of a 10 pmol solution of each primer. The following PCR
program was used to amplify the COI fragments: 15 min.
95°C for initial denaturation and activation of the
polymerase enzyme; 45 cycles with 20 sec. 94°C, 90 sec.
52°C and 90 sec. 72°C, followed by 8 min. at 72°C for
final extension.

PCR products were checked on a 1.5 % agarose gel with
ethidium bromide staining (130 V, 30–40 min.), cleaned
with Millipore PCR cleaning plates and sequenced according to the manual with ABI BigDye Terminator ver.3.1 in
both directions on an ABI 3700. Sequencing was done
with the same primers as used in the PCR reaction for
both gene fragments. Very long LSU sequences (> 1100
bp), especially if they contain GC rich stretches, were
sequenced in addition with the internal primers fw2 and
rev4. For sequencing it sometimes turned out to be helpful to increase the amount of template DNA to get better
reads in difficult sequence regions.
Contigs were assembled with Lasergene SeqMan II (DNAStar) and resulting sequences checked against GenBank
for contamination. All contigs were checked by eye for
ambiguous nucleotides in the regions sequenced for both
strands. We counted positions with double peaks from
one third up to same height in both strands to estimate
the occurrence of different alleles or copies in the rDNA
cluster.
The COI and LSU sequences for Cottus and Aphyosemion
were aligned with Clustal X [44] and checked by eye with
BioEdit 5.0.9 [45]. Aligned protein sequences were
checked for a functional coding sequence to test against
non-functional nuclear copies. A cluster analysis was done
with the neighbour joining algorithm (NJ) as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [27]. We employed no model of
sequence evolution and used p-distances to compare only
the raw data without any assumptions on sequence evolution. Missing data or gaps were deleted in the pairwise
comparison.
All sequences are deposited in Genbank under the accession numbers EF416965 – EF417284).
