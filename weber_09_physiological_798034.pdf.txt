Abstract
Background: Acidity exerts a determining influence on the composition and diversity of
freshwater faunas. While the physiological implications of freshwater acidification have been
intensively studied in teleost fish and crayfish, much less is known about the acid-stress physiology
of ecologically important groups such as cladoceran zooplankton. This study analyzed the
extracellular acid-base state and CO2 partial pressure (PCO2), circulation and ventilation, as well as
the respiration rate of Daphnia pulex acclimated to acidic (pH 5.5 and 6.0) and circumneutral (pH
7.8) conditions.
Results: D. pulex had a remarkably high extracellular pH of 8.33 and extracellular PCO2 of 0.56 kPa
under normal ambient conditions (pH 7.8 and normocapnia). The hemolymph had a high
bicarbonate concentration of 20.9 mM and a total buffer value of 51.5 meq L-1 pH-1. Bicarbonate
covered 93% of the total buffer value. Acidic conditions induced a slight acidosis (pH = 0.16–0.23),
a 30–65% bicarbonate loss, and elevated systemic activities (tachycardia, hyperventilation,
hypermetabolism). pH 6.0 animals partly compensated the bicarbonate loss by increasing the nonbicarbonate buffer value from 2.0 to 5.1 meq L-1 pH-1. The extracellular PCO2 of pH 5.5 animals was
significantly reduced to 0.33 kPa, and these animals showed the highest tolerance to a short-term
exposure to severe acid stress.
Conclusion: Chronic exposure to acidic conditions had a pervasive impact on Daphnia's
physiology including acid-base balance, extracellular PCO2, circulation and ventilation, and energy
metabolism. Compensatory changes in extracellular non-bicarbonate buffering capacity and the
improved tolerance to severe acid stress indicated the activation of defense mechanisms which may
result from gene-expression mediated adjustments in hemolymph buffer proteins and in epithelial
properties. Mechanistic analyses of the interdependence between extracellular acid-base balance
and CO2 transport raised the question of whether a carbonic anhydrase (CA) is involved in the
−
catalysis of the CO 2 -HCO 3 -H + reaction, which led to the discovery of 31 CA-genes in the

genome of D. pulex.

Background
Freshwater acidification is an important stressor that
affects the structure of zooplankton communities in lake
ecosystems. Acidification may arise from natural processes such as spring acid episodes [1,2], acid rock drainage
[3] and volcanism [4,5], or from anthropogenic activities
including fossil fuels burning [6,7], agriculture measures
[8], dredging of waterways [9,10] and mining-related
processes (e.g. acid mine drainage, recultivation and
flooding of former mining pits) [11,12]. pH levels below
5–6 generally decrease the zooplankton species richness
compared to circumneutral pH conditions [13-16].
Among the zooplankton, crustaceans of the genus Daphnia are usually less abundant in acidified lakes while other
(non-daphnid) cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and
insects (e.g. Chaoborus larvae and corixids) may increase in
importance or even become dominating [15,17]. The
mechanisms behind these changes in the zooplankton
community structure are manifold. They include a differential physiological sensitivity to acid stress [14,18,19], a
differential tolerance against toxic metal species [20-22],
which become more soluble under acidic conditions, as
well as altered biotic interactions arising from the effect of
pH on phytoplankton and planktivore communities
[14,23].
It is well-known that the physiological sensitivity of
aquatic animals to acidic conditions is associated with
iono- and osmoregulatory processes [24,25]. Faced with
the continuous diffusive gain of water and loss of ions,
freshwater animals generally have to minimize their
whole-body permeability to water and/or ions and additionally require compensatory uptake mechanisms for
sodium and chloride to maintain a steady-state ion balance [26]. While data on whole-body water permeability
of freshwater zooplankton are essentially lacking [27-29],
there is some information on sodium permeability. In
general, acid-tolerant species such as aquatic insects have
a relatively low sodium permeability in comparison to
cladocerans [18,30-32]. In the acid-sensitive daphnids,
the inability to survive long term below pH 5 is correlated
with the net loss of body sodium due to an accelerated
rate of Na+ loss and a reduced rate of Na+ uptake [33,34],
a process that is additionally influenced by the ambient
calcium concentration [35].
The acidification-induced impairment of sodium uptake
in daphnids suggests that the transport of sodium across
the epipodites – the so-called 'branchial sacs' [36] – is
linked with proton extrusion [33,35], as it is in the gills of
other freshwater animals such as fish and crayfish [37-40].
The protons arise from the catalyzed hydration of CO2 by
a cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase in the ionoregulatory
−
epithelia. This reaction produces HCO 3 which is then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/9

excreted in exchange for chloride [41]. The interdependence between ionoregulatory processes, acid-base balance, and CO2 transport explains the strong impact of acid
stress on the physiology of many freshwater animals.
However, in contrast to the detailed information on teleost fish [24] and crayfish [25], the physiological implications of acid stress in daphnids have remained largely
unexplored. Daphnids are important model organisms in
ecotoxicology, and there is a growing interest in establishing mechanistic links between molecular stress responses
and organismal stress responses [42-47]. Understanding
the specific physiology of Daphnia may help to elucidate
the modes of action of environmental toxicants [48,49].
The present study provides the experimental, methodical,
and conceptual framework to analyze the acid-stress physiology of daphnids. Preliminary tests with Daphnia pulex
yielded the appropriate acclimation conditions which
guaranteed the survival, growth, and reproduction under
acidic (pH 5.5 and 6.0) and circumneutral conditions (pH
7.8). Based on these stable laboratory populations, we
determined the buffer characteristics from microliter
hemolymph samples, analyzed the extracellular acid-base
state by microspectralfluorometry using the pH-sensitive
dye cSNARF-1, and studied the responses to a short-term
exposure to severe acid stress (pH 3–4). Circulation, ventilation and respiration were additionally analyzed and
served as diagnostic indicators for the interpretation of
acid-base disturbances. Moreover, reproduction was monitored to assess acidification-induced changes in maintenance costs and energy-and-mass budget. Finally, the
implications of the presence or absence of an extracellular
carbonic anhydrase for acid-base balance and circulatory
CO2 transport are discussed.

Results and discussion
Acid-base balance under normal conditions
A rather alkaline extracellular pH of 8.334 ± 0.006 (mean
± S.E., N = 4) was measured in the heart region of animals
which were raised and examined under normal conditions (i.e. ambient pH = 7.8, PCO2 = 0.035 kPa, and 20°C).

By taking the characteristics and the variability of the
hemolymph buffer curves (Table 1) into account, the
mean in vivo pH corresponded to an equilibrium PCO2 of
0.56 ± 0.02 kPa (means ± S.E., N = 3 buffer curves) and a
hemolymph bicarbonate concentration of 20.9 ± 0.7 mM
(Table 2 and Figure 1A, open triangle). The derived PCO2
value is a representative measure of the extracellular PCO2

be in equilibrium. The information on the hemolymph

the mean of a three-fold determination. The error in the
concentration of chemically bound CO2 arises from the
standard error in the calculation of CO2 partial pressure
(PCO2) for a given pH (Table 1). The solid lines were calculated using the equations 1–3 and the means of the individual
(curve-specific) parameter values given in Table 1. Dotted

buffer curves and the extracellular pH was used to assess
the capacity of the extracellular compartment to buffer
hydrogen ions of metabolic origin. The hemolymph had
a total buffer value (T) of 51.5 meq L-1 pH-1 (Table 2).
Bicarbonate covered 93% of T, and the non-bicarbonate
buffer value (A) was 2.0 meq L-1 pH-1.
Given the extracellular pH of 8.334, which is markedly
higher than the circumneutral values of other waterbreathing crustaceans (Table 3) [50-70], one is tempted to
assume that Daphnia pulex is in a state of permanent respi-

Buffer curves were obtained by measuring the pH of hemolymph
samples in dependence on CO2 partial pressure (PCO2). The three
buffer curves of each acclimation group were simultaneously fitted by
the binary buffer model (equation 1), using pK'A as a shared
parameter. This means that the value of this parameter was forced to
be the same for all three buffer curves. Given are the best-fit
parameter values (mean ± standard error) for the strong ion
difference (SID), the concentration (CA) and pK'A value of the nonbicarbonate buffer, and the the standard error of the fit (rmse, root
mean squared error). The number for the degrees of freedom (i.e.
the number of data points minus the number of fitted parameters)
was 8. The reverse determination of PCO2 from pH is exemplified as
follows. Given the in vivo pH of 8.334, the three calibration buffer
curves of the pH 7.8 acclimation group yielded PCO2 values of 0.519 ±
0.005 kPa, 0.573 ± 0.006 kPa, and 0.575 ± 0.005 kPa. These individual
means were finally averaged to yield an overall mean of 0.556 kPa
with a standard error of 0.018 kPa. This standard error therefore
reflects the variability among the buffer curves.

ratory alkalosis. Indeed, the filter-feeding mode of life of
daphnids is inevitably associated with high ventilation
rates (e.g. 0.75 mm3 s-1 [mm-3 body volume] for D. magna)
[71], which should favor the wash-out of carbon dioxide
from the hemolymph. However, the present study gave no
indication for a respiratory hypocapnia in D. pulex, since
the extracellular pH suggested an equilibrium PCO2 of 0.56
kPa, which is higher than the typical PCO2 values (0.2–0.5
kPa, Table 3) in the prebranchial and postbranchial
hemolymph of other water-breathing crustaceans. If the
equilibrium PCO2 in the postbranchial hemolymph of D.
pulex would approach the low value of, say, 0.2 kPa, an
extreme alkalosis (pH 8.75) would occur. Taking the scaling relationship between metabolic rate and body size
into account [72], the exceptional acid-base state of these
small crustaceans seems to be determined by two main
factors: (i) a high, specific metabolic rate, which contributes to the elevated PCO2 levels, and (ii) a high bicarbonate
buffer value, which might be a pre-adaptive feature to
cope with a highly variable, physiologically challenging
environment.
One may argue that the in vivo results are to some extent
influenced by the experimental procedures, which

required the microinjection of a pH-sensitive dye into the
circulatory system of immobilized animals. Previous studies [71,73-75] have shown that the immobilization does
not induce any noticable physiological disturbances, provided that the animals have the chance to acclimate to the
experimental conditions for at least 30 min. Immobilized
animals of D. magna, for example, exhibit the typical resting values in heart rate (fH) and appendage beating rate
(fA) and respond in a predictable manner to changes in
abiotic [73-75] and biotic factors [71]. The microinjection
procecure, however, is known to induce a bradycardia in
D. magna [76] and it did so in D. pulex. Our microinjected
control animals (pH 7.8 acclimation) had a fH of 205 ± 10
min-1 (N = 4), which was significantly lower than that of
non-injected animals (310 ± 28 min-1, N = 5; t-test: P =
0.01). In contrast, there was no significant effect on fA
(injected: 374 ± 32 min-1, non-injected: 352 ± 51 min-1; P
= 0.8). The slower fH was very likely caused by the increase
in hemolymph viscosity due to the injection of the dye-

coupled 70-kDa dextrans. Given the 34% reduction in fH,
one may suppose a pertubation in the hemolymph partial
pressures of respiratory gases including the PCO2. Theoretical analyses in terms of the CO2 transport model, which
is described below, revealed that the mean extracellular
PCO2 would be 8% smaller in the absence of a bradycardia.
An effect of this magnitude does not invalidate the findings about the exceptional acid-base state of D. pulex.

Animals raised and tested under acidic conditions (ambient pH 6.0 and pH 5.5) had extracellular pH values of

that of the control (pH 7.8 acclimated) animals. The differences in extracellular pH among the acclimation groups
were statistically significant (Table 2). The extracellular
PCO2 (0.56 ± 0.02 kPa) of the pH 6.0 acclimated animals

was virtually the same as that of the control group. In contrast, pH 5.5 animals had a significantly lower extracellular PCO2 of 0.33 ± 0.04 kPa (Table 2).
The slight acidosis in the extracellular fluid was associated
with a significant (30–65%) reduction in hemolymph
bicarbonate concentration to 14.6 ± 0.5 mM in pH 6.0
animals and 7.2 ± 0.9 mM in pH 5.5 animals (Table 2 and
Figure 1A, gray and black triangles). Reductions of similar
relative magnitude have been observed in freshwater crayfish [77-79]. This depletion in hemolymph bicarbonate,
by the entry of acidic equivalents from the ambient
medium (see below), caused a proportional reduction in
the bicarbonate buffer value (B). The pH 6.0 animals
partly compensated the 30% reduction in B by increasing
the non-bicarbonate buffer value (A) from 2.0 to 5.1 meq
L-1 pH-1, while pH 5.5 animals experienced a 65% loss in
B (Table 2). Although the compensatory increase in A
was almost negligible, the pH 5.5 animals still had significant reserves in A which are available in the case of a progressive acidosis (Figure 1B).
Heart rate (fH), ventilation rate (fA), and oxygen consump

posedly to meet the increased maintenance requirements
for ion regulation. These systemic adjustments had no
influence on extracellular PCO2. The acidosis of the pH 6.0
animals (pH = -0.16 units; Table 2) was therefore of metabolic rather than of respiratory origin. In agreement with
the convention in acid-stress physiology [80], the term
'metabolic acidosis' is used here irrespective of whether
the protons originate endogenously in connection with

lactic acid production or exogenously, by the influx of H+
down the large medium-to-hemolymph H+ gradient. The
metabolic acidosis was very likely caused by an influx of
acidic equivalents from the ambient medium, since the
sustained circulation and ventilation argue against the
possibility of an activation of anaerobic support mechanisms.
Compared to the control group, the pH 5.5 animals experienced a 0.23-unit decrease in extracellular pH (Table 2),
which can be characterized as metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation as indicated by the reduced extracellular PCO2. Since the oxygen consumption rate (and
consequently the CO2 production rate) did not change
significantly in comparison to the control animals (Table
2), the main reasons for the reduced extracellular PCO2 are
the 34–46% increased ventilation and perfusion rates
(Table 2) as well as an enhanced permeability of the integument for respiratory gases, probably due to a thinner carapace. The latter explanation is consistent with the
observation of the softer carapaces, which occurred only
in the pH 5.5 animals. As in acid-stressed freshwater crayfish [81-83], the softer (jelly-like) carapace of pH 5.5 animals may indicate a poor calcification resulting from
exoskeletal CaCO3 erosion and reduced calcium and basic
−
equivalent ( HCO 3 ) uptake during the postmoult stage.

as specific rate (nmol h-1 mm-3), which is normalized to
cubic body length rather than to body weight. It is common practice to estimate the body weight of daphnids
from body length using scaling relationships (e.g. [84]).

It is important to note that no diapausing eggs occurred in
pH 5.5 animals during the six-month experimental
period. Obviously, the physiologically demanding condition of pH 5.5 was either not associated with an activation
of the stress-signaling cascade responsible for production
of male offspring [92,93] or males did not survive until
maturity. The pH 6.0 animals, in contrast, were distinguished by the repeated occurrence of parthenogenic eggs
with a white cover layer which probably resulted from a
fungal infection. Although there are some reports on
increased fungal parasitism in daphnids [94,95] and crayfish [82,96] under various stress conditions, it remains to
be clarified whether acid stress leads to an increased susceptibility of daphnids to fungal parasites [97].
The role of acclimation in the tolerance to severe acid
stress
The tolerance to a short-term exposure to severe acid stress
(ambient pH 3–4) was examined in the control and acidacclimated animals. The animals were initially exposed to
their respective acclimation pH before the ambient pH

was set to pH 4.0 and then to pH 3.0 (Figure 2). Upon
exposure to ambient pH 4.0, all groups experienced an

However, we discarded this estimation because of the
uncertainty about the influence of acidification on the
relationship between body length and body weight. In the
pH 5.5 animals, a reduction in the amount of metabolically active biomass (per cubic body length) could have
masked the supposed extra costs for ion regulation. Evidence for this explanation comes from the comparison of
brood sizes of those animals which were analyzed in the
respiration experiment. The egg numbers of pH 5.5 animals (1.2 ± 0.6, range: 0–6, N = 12) were significantly
lower than those of the pH 6.0 animals (9.1 ± 0.6, N = 12)
and pH 7.8 animals (7.8 ± 1.0, N = 9) (Kruskal-Wallis test,
P < 0.001). All eggs were of early developmental stage and
accounted for very little respiration in the brooding
females [85]. Nevertheless, the reduced allocation of
resources into reproduction implies an acidificationinduced disturbance in the energy and mass budgets of
the pH 5.5 animals. Indeed, these animals showed the
highest degree of transparency owing to the decreased
appearance of orange-colored fat cells. Fat cells store carbohydrates and lipids [86-88], the latter in form of droplets which are usually colored, owing to the presence of
carotinoids [89]. In addition, fat cells produce hemoglobin [90] and are supposed to be involved in vitellogenin synthesis [91]. Whether the acidification-induced
disturbance in the energy and mass budgets results solely
from the increased maintenance costs for ion homeostasis
or, additionally, from a reduced assimilation rate (e.g. due
suboptimal pH conditions for enzymatic digestion of
food in the gut) needs further investigation.

acidosis, but were able to stabilize their extracellular pH at
a level 0.1–0.2 pH units below the respective pre-exposure
value (Figure 2A). This response was caused by a 'metabolic acid load' of 7.0 meq L-1 (pH 7.8 animals), 4.5 meq
L-1 (pH 6.0 animals), and 1.3 meq L-1 (pH 5.5 animals).
While the fH remained unaffected in all groups (Figure
2B), diverging responses were found in fA (Figure 2C). The
fA response spectrum comprised a transient depression in
pH 7.8 animals, an irregular beating behavior in pH 6.0
animals, and a sustained beating activity in pH 5.5 animals.
During the subsequent 18-min exposure to ambient pH
3.0, the pH homeostasis collapsed in all acclimation
groups. The extracellular pH showed a progressive decline
(Figure 2A), which corresponded to a net flux of acidic
equivalents from the ambient medium into the hemolymph of 32 meq L-1 h-1 (pH 7.8 animals), 46 meq L-1 h-1
(pH 6.0 animals), and 16 meq L-1 h-1 (pH 5.5 animals).
This massive net influx of acidic equivalents is in line with
reports on the breakdown of ion regulation
[34,35,98,99]. In D. magna, severe acid stress resulted in a
60–70% inhibition of the unidirectional sodium influx
and a 130% increase in sodium outflux [34]. Within one
hour, these animals lost 30–50% of their body sodium.
The whole-body sodium concentration of D. magna is 26–
41 mmol (kg wet mass)-1 [35,98,100,101], assuming a
wet-to-dry mass ratio of 10:1 [102]. This whole-body concentration is consistent with a hemolymph concentration
of 65 mM sodium [103], taking into account that the
hemolymph comprises 60% of the body volume [102]
and that the extracellular fluid contains the main portion
of whole-body sodium. The estimated net efflux of
sodium (20–30 mmol L-1 h-1) from the hemolymph of D.
magna compares well with the net influx of acidic equivalents into the hemolymph of D. pulex (32 meq L-1 h-1 in
control animals). This shows that the disturbance in acidbase balance mirrors the disturbance in ion regulation
and vice versa.
During the exposure to ambient pH 3.0, the fA decreased
strongly in all groups, whereas fH remained apparently
unaffected (Figure 2B, C). However, the subsequent recovery period revealed a (somewhat delayed) heart arrest and
a deformation of heart structure in the pH 7.8 and pH 6.0
animals. Their extracellular pH values during the recovery
period remained 0.55 pH units below initial (pre-acid
exposure) values. The pH 5.5 animals, in contrast, were
able to reduce the difference between the pre- and postexposure values to 0.16 units. This was the only group
which survived the severe-acid test.
Of all acclimation groups, the pH 5.5 animals had the
highest tolerance to severe acid stress as indicated by the
lowest net influx of acidic equivalents (16 meq L-1 h-1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/9/9

This implies a lower disturbance of extracellular ion regulation in the pH 5.5 animals compared to the other two
acclimation groups, which may explain the unique ability
to sustain heart-beating activity in the former and heart
arrest in the latter. The results of the severe-acid test further suggest that the acclimation to ambient pH 5.5
induced a compensatory increase in active ion transport
and/or a reduction in the epithelial permeability for
sodium and hydrogen ions. However, the suggested
reduction in epithelial ion permeability contrasts with the
increased integumental permeability for respiratory gases
arising from the impaired carapace formation. It therefore
seems that active compensation in ion transport is the
more likely defence mechanism.
Interdependence between acid-base balance and CO2
transport
Information on extracellular pH in the heart region and
on hemolymph bicarbonate concentration made it possible to determine the local PCO2 in the pericardial hemol-

ymph. In daphnids, the pericardial space receives
hemolymph from the carapace lacuna, which is an important site of gas exchange [36,76], and from the dorsal
lacuna, which is fed by the current leaving the intestinal
lacuna [36]. In the carapace lacuna, the PCO2 is low due to
the transintegumental diffusion of CO2 from the hemolymph into the ambient medium. In the intestinal lacuna
(which traverses the body core region), the PCO2 is high
because metabolically produced CO2 is released into the
hemolymph. The local PCO2 in the pericardial space therefore assumes an intermediate value that lies between the
two PCO2 extremes. The magnitude of the PCO2 differences
in the circulatory system strongly depends on the presence
or absence of a carbonic anhydrase (CA). In the absence
−
of a CA, the interconversion between CO2 and HCO 3

proceeds slowly [104]. For example, a 25 mM bicarbonate
solution with a non-bicarbonate buffer value of 2–10 meq
L-1 pH-1 needs 3–12 s for a half-change in hydrogen concentration following the abrupt increase in PCO2 from 5 to
11 kPa [105]. These half-equilibration times apply to
37°C, so even longer would be needed at 20°C. Given a
hemolymph circulation time of 21 s in a 2.5 mm D.
magna at 20°C (cardiac output: 32 nl s-1 [74], hemolymph
volume: 680 nl [102], it is clear that hemolymph passage
time from the tissues to the respiratory surfaces is too
−
short to bring the uncatalyzed CO2+H2OH++ HCO 3

reaction into full equilibrium. Under these circumstances,
the main share of metabolically produced CO2 would be
transported as physically dissolved gas rather than in the

the absence of a hemolymph CA. However, a screening of
the D. pulex genome database [116,117] unexpectedly
revealed 31 genes with CA-like coding sequences (Table
4). These genes belong to two evolutionarily unrelated CA
gene families (-CA and -CA) [118]. The derived aminoacid sequences were aligned with selected metazoan
sequences (Additional files 1 and 2) [119-122] and classified in terms of their putative destination (Figure 4A, B)
[123], based on sequence features and the known localization of CAs from crab [124], mosquito [125], and man
[118]. The phylogenetic analysis of -CA sequences
showed a distinct separation between mitochondrial and
cytoplasmic, CA-related, membrane-bound and transmembrane, and secretory proteins (Figure 4A). Among
the 30 -CAs from D. pulex were 25 sequences (CAA6A-H,
CAA7A-Q) with an N-terminal signal peptide for secretory
export. Seven of these putative extracellular isoforms are
currently supported by EST data. So far, nothing is is
known about the extracellular target sites. To account for
the possibility of CA secretion into the hemolymph, we
simulated a second scenario, in which a hemolymph CA

Knowledge about the presence or absence of a CA in the
circulatory fluid is therefore fundamental for the understanding of CO2 transport and acid-base balance in daphnids. The reported absence of CA activity in the
hemolymph of decapod crustaceans [106-109] prompted
us to analyse the physiological implications of circulatory
CO2 transport under uncatalyzed conditions in more
detail. Based on established concepts of compartment
modelling [110,111] and on own experiences in the simulation of whole-animal oxygen transport in daphnids
[71,112], we derived a multi-compartment model of the
CO2 diffusion-convection-reaction system (Figure 3C) to
simulate the transport of CO2 from the tissue via the
hemolymph to the ambient medium. To obtain a pH of
8.334 at the entrance of the inner hemolymph lacuna
(Figure 3C), the Krogh constant for the diffusion of CO2
in chitin (K) was set to 2.10 × 10-6 nmol s-1 mm-1 kPa-1. To
our knowledge, there are no experimental data in the literature on Krogh's diffusion constant for CO2 in chitin.
Nevertheless, the chosen K value is plausible insofar as it
is of the same order of magnitude as Krogh's diffusion
constant for O2 in chitin (0.95 × 10-6 nmol s-1 mm-1 kPa-1)
[113]. The similarity in both values seems to contradict
the well-known fact that Krogh's diffusion constant for
CO2 in water and aqueous tissues is 20–25 times higher
than that for O2, a phenomenon that is explained by the
higher capacitance (solubility) coefficient of CO2 in aqueous media [114]. The cuticle of arthropods, however, is
primarily composed of chitin fibers which are embedded
in a more or less hydrated protein matrix [115]. Among
the different layers (epicuticle, exocuticle, endocuticle),
the exocuticle is relatively dehydrated [115] and may therefore establish a similar diffusion barrier for O2 and CO2.

The CO2 transport model made it possible to follow the

solved gas. Instead, more CO2 is transported in the chem-

circulation cycle (Figure 3D, uncatalyzed case). The extracellular PCO2 in the three hemolymph compartments var-

of 8.25 (inner HL lacuna) and the 'postbranchial' value of

ies largely between 0.13–0.94 kPa, whereas the
extracellular pH remains confined to the narrow range of
pH 8.32–8.35. The small changes in bicarbonate concentration (< 0.01 mM) reflect the slow interconversion
−
between CO2 and HCO 3 . Compared to bicarbonate, the

carbonate and non-bicarbonate buffers show concentration changes in opposite direction as they are involved in
the buffering of hydrogen ions arising from the hydration
of CO2 and subsequent dissociation of carbonic acid.

accelerates the interconversion between CO2 and HCO 3

by a factor of 10000 [126], which is sufficiently large to
establish an equilibrium. Krogh's diffusion constant for
CO2 in chitin was slightly reduced to 1.30 × 10-6 nmol s-1
mm-1 kPa-1 to obtain a pH of 8.334 at the entrance of the
inner hemolymph lacuna (Figure 3C). Compared to the
uncatalyzed case, the catalyzed hydration/dehydration of
CO2 significantly reduced the variations in extracellular
indicating that less CO2 is transported as physically dis-

The two simulated scenarios represent a coherent description of the physiological implications arising from the
presence or absence of a CA in the hemolymph of D.
pulex. The selected values for the global adjustment
parameter K remain within reasonable bounds that made
it impossible to put more weight to one of the two models. Nevertheless, the predicted extracellular PCO2 and pH
gradients represent a working hypothesis that will be
tested in subsequent experiments. pH imaging techPage 10 of 25

Classification of CA-like amino acid sequences from Daphnia pulex
Figure 4 (see previous page)
Classification of CA-like amino acid sequences from Daphnia pulex. Phylogenetic trees for selected -carbonic anhydrases (-CAs) (A) and -CAs (B) based on multiple-sequence alignments (Additional files 1 and 2). D. pulex sequences are
shown in red; underlined labels indicate EST support. Three fragmentary sequences (CAA6A, CAA7B, CAA7L; Table 4) from
D. pulex were excluded from the alignment. Additionally included were related sequences from the blue crab Callinectes sapidus
(Cs), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Anopheles gambiae (Ag), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
(Sp), Homo sapiens (Hs), the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Nv), and Pisum sativum (Ps). -CAs were classified in terms of
their putative destination into mitochondrial and cytoplasmic, CA-related, membrane-bound and transmembrane, and secretory proteins. CA-related proteins have lost most of the highly conserved active-site residues. Membrane-associated -CAs
have a C-terminal attachment signal for a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor which tethers the extracellular protein to
the cell membrane [123]. The trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Bootstrap analysis was performed
with 1000 replicates (bootstrap values > 800 are indicated by filled circles). For sequence references, see Additional files 1 and
2.

niques, for example, should have the resolution power to
detect a spatial in vivo gradient as large as 0.1–0.2 pH units
to verify or falsify the assumption of CA activity in the circulatory system of D. pulex. Further in vivo experiments
may include the application of a strong diffusible CA
inhibitor or the microinjection of an exogenous CA [127].

Conclusion
Chronic acid exposure induced pronounced effects in
extracellular pH, bicarbonate concentration and CO2 partial pressure, as well as in circulation, ventilation and
energy metabolism. Compensatory changes in extracellular non-bicarbonate buffering capacity and the improved
tolerance to severe acid stress indicated the activation of
defense mechanisms. The physiological changes were
associated with an impairment of carapace formation and
with reductions in reserve materials and reproduction.
Mechanistic analyses of the interdependence between
extracellular acid-base balance and CO2 transport led to
the identification and classification of 31 carbonic anhydrase isoforms which are encoded in the genome of D.
pulex. The multitude of physiological information that can
be acquired from these transparent crustaceans via optical
techniques underlines the great advantage of Daphnia
pulex as a model system for environmental studies. Proteomic analyses are underway to identify the molecular
mechanisms and target genes involved in Daphnia's
responses to a variety of environmental stresses including
freshwater
acidification.

Methods
Acclimation conditions
Animals were raised at 20°C in aerated M4 medium [128]
under three different pH conditions at a 16 h:8 h L:D photoperiod. The control condition (7.8 ± 0.2, mean ± variation range) was manually adjusted twice a week using
0.005 M H2SO4 and 0.01 M NaOH. The pH 6.0 ± 0.1 condition was established by adding 5 mM MES buffer (2morpholinoethansulfonic acid) to the medium. pH 5.5 ±
0.05 was maintained by a pH-Stat, which was equipped

with a pH electrode (N 6000; Schott-Geräte GmbH,
Mainz, Germany) and which controlled the addition of
0.05 M H2SO4 delivered by a peristaltic pump (Gilson
ABIMED, Villiers, France).
The pH 7.8 and pH 6.0 animals were cultured in 2 L glass
beakers (containing 1.8 L medium) at a density of 25–50
individuals (juveniles plus adults) per vessel. The pH 5.5
animals were kept in a 20 L glass aquarium (containing 8
L medium) at a density of 100–200 individuals. Surplus
offspring were sorted out twice a week. Given the case of
appearance, females with ephippia and males were sorted
out, so that parthenogenesis and clonal reproduction was
maintained. Animals were fed ad libitum with Desmodesmus subspicatus (final concentration: 15.5 × 104 cells per
ml culturing medium) six times a week. To minimize the
influence of algae on medium pH [129], sedimented food
material was removed once (glass aquarium) or twice
(glass beaker) a week. During this procedure, any algal
surface buildup was removed by scrubbing the enclosures,
and at least half of the medium was exchanged by fresh
medium.
Analysis of hemolymph buffer curves
Hemolymph samples (0.2–1 l per animal) were drawn
as described elsewhere [73] and collected in ice-cooled
500 l reaction vials. The pooled hemolymph (30–100
l) was filtered (cellulose acetate syringe filters, 0.45 m
pore size; Nalgene, Rochester, NY), shortly centrifuged to
remove any air bubbles, and finally kept on ice. Hemolymph buffer curves were measured with a micro-pH-electrode (MI-4152; Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, U.S.A.) in
a gas diffusion chamber [130] at 20°C. The pH electrode
was linked to a pH-meter (MP 230, Mettler Toledo, Swiss)
which transferred the data to a computer. Traceable NIST
standard reference buffers (pH 6.88 and pH 9.23 at 20°C,
type number: L 4798; Schott-Geräte GmbH) were used for
calibration. Hemolymph samples of 5–10 l were equilibrated with humidified gas mixtures of different CO2 partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.135–5.50 kPa). The gas mixtures

Protein IDs indicate manually curated gene models that may differ from those contained in the 'Filtered Models v1.1' set (released by JGI in July
2007) [117]. The Reference ID can be used to retrieve the corresponding models from the Filtered Models set v1.1.

and carbon dioxide (99.995%; Air Liquide, Düsseldorf,
Germany) using a gas mixing pump (2 M 303/a-F
Wösthoff oHG Bochum, Germany).
For analysis, the hemolymph of Daphnia was considered
as a binary buffer system consisting of the carbonate system and a monoprotic non-bicarbonate buffer (HA  H+
+ A-). The dependence of pH on PCO2 for such a system is
described by the following balance equation [131]

(1)
where {H+} is 10-pH, K'w (= 10-14 M) is the dissociation
equilibrium constant of water, and SID represents the
strong ion difference [132]. CA and K'A are the concentration and dissociation equilibrium constants of the nonbicarbonate buffer, whereas K'1 and K'2 represent the first
and second dissociation equilibrium constants of the carbonate system. The physical solubility of CO2 in hemolymph (CO2 = 0.3682 mmol l-1 kPa-1) was calculated
according to a thermodynamic model [133,134], assuming a sodium concentration of 58 mM and a solution density of 1 g l-1. Operational pK'-values of the carbonate
system (pK'1 = 6.325 ± 0.002, pK'2 = 10.47 ± 0.09; means
± S.E.) were determined from standard bicarbonate solutions (4, 8, 16 mM NaHCO3 plus 50 mM NaCl) using
three equilibration steps (PCO2 = 0.13, 0.50, 2.0 kPa)
(Additional file 3). These standard bicarbonate solutions
were a valid representation of Daphnia hemolymph in
terms of ionic strength which, besides protein concentration, affects the CO2 and the pK'-values [131]. The influence of protein concentration on CO2 was negligible
because the proteins in Daphnia hemolymph occupy less
than 1% of hemolymph volume.
Given the PCO2-pH data, parameter values for SID, CA and
K'A were obtained by nonlinear least-squares data fitting.
The analytical procedure additionally contained a correction for incomplete hemolymph equilibration at the lowest PCO2 step (Additional file 3). The concentrations of
bicarbonate and carbonate are given by

The appropriateness of the operational parameter values
for the calculation of bicarbonate was validated by the
direct measurement of total CO2 in Triops cancriformis
hemolymph (R. Pirow, unpublished data), whose ionic
strength is comparable to that of Daphnia hemolymph.

The CO2 titration of a bicarbonate-buffered cSNARF-1
solution containing additionally 50 mM NaCl had the
advantage of calibrating the pH-sensitive dye in a chemical environment whose ionic composition is similar to
that of Daphnia hemolymph (see Discussion). However,
the chosen CO2 partial pressures were not sufficient to
achieve pH extremes which could shift the dye into the
fully protonated (acid) and deprotonated (base) forms
(Figure 5A). Reiterative least-squares spectral resolution
(Additional file 4) [137] was therefore employed to
recover the spectra of the acid/base forms (Figure 5B) and
the pK'a value of cSNARF-1. The calibration yielded a pK'a
of 7.624 (Figure 5D).
In vivo measurements
Adult females with a carapace length of 1.9–2.6 mm and
parthenogenetic embryos of developmental stage 2 [138]
were used. Animals were immobilized as described [73].
For cSNARF-1 microinjection, small glass capillaries (GB
120 F10, Science Products GmbH, Hofheim, Germany)
were thinly drawn out with a micropipette puller (model
77; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). 2 l cSNARF-1

Calibration of cSNARF-1
A stock solution of 70-kDa dextran-coupled cSNARF-1
(D-3304, Molecular Probes, Inc., Oregon, USA) was prepared by dissolving 5 mg lyophilized dye in 250 l sterilefiltered Milli-Q water (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).
The stock solution was 1:20 diluted with a 10 mM
NaHCO3 solution containing 50 mM NaCl. Given a conjugation ratio of 3–8 chromophore groups per dextran
particle (Molecular Probes product information, 2003),
the average concentration of cSNARF-1 in the calibration
solution was 80 M. Using the diffusion chamber and the
microfluorometric set-up described above, a 10 l sample
was equilibrated with gas mixtures of different PCO2
(0.135–5.50 kPa). At the end of each equilibration step, a
fluorescence spectrum and the sample pH were measured.

used for spectrum acquisition. Fluorescence emission
spectra were smoothed with a span of 30 nm.

Analysis of in vivo cSNARF-1 spectra
cSNARF-1 fluorescence spectra were obtained from the
hemolymph space around the heart region. Since all
tested animals were in a fasting state, the in vivo spectra
did not contain any noticeable contributions from
ingested autofluorescing algae which, if present, would
have seriously affected the pH determination. The excellent quality of the in vivo cSNARF-1 spectra (Figure 6A)
made it possible to determine the in vivo pH with high
precision using multicomponent analysis (Additional file
4) [139]. Since the in vivo spectra could not be fitted by the
calibration spectra (Figure 5B), probably due to a calibration-inherent distortion of the acid spectrum around
600–700 nm, new acid/base spectra of cSNARF-1 were
measured in Daphnia magna hemolymph. The hemolymph samples were acidified by equilibration with 100%
CO2 gas and basified by the addition of NaOH under
CO2-free gas conditions (100% N2). As a modification to
the calibration experiment, the micro-pH-electrode was
not inserted into the hemolymph samples to avoid any
optical interferences. The obtained acid/base spectra (Figure 6B) were finally scaled to the peak-to-peak ratio of the
calibration spectra (Figure 5B). The multicomponent
analysis determined the fractional contribution () of the
acid form of cSNARF-1 to the in vivo spectra. The pH was
finally calculated from  and the pK'a value of cSNARF-1
(Figure 6D) according to

medium corresponded to the acclimation pH of the animals. During the experiment, the animal was exposed to a
stepwise variation in ambient pH using the following
sequence: initial (acclimation) pH (33 min), pH 4.0 (35
min), pH 3.0 (18 min), and acclimation pH (34 min). All
perfusion media were buffered using 5 mM HEPES (pH
7.8), 5 mM MES (pH 6.0), or 5 mM citrate (pH 5.5, 4.0,
3.0). The medium pH was continuously controlled using
a pH electrode (N 6000). During the experiment, the fluorescence-spectrum acquisition alternated with the acquisition of video images of the animal under infrared
transillumination. From these video sequences, the heart
rate and appendage beating rate was determined by digital
motion analysis as described elsewhere [73].

known. The component spectra (B) comprised the in vitro
spectra of the acid/base forms of cSNARF-1 (measured in
Daphnia hemolymph), a reference (autofluorescence) spectrum from non-injected animals, and an offset (background)
spectrum. The multicomponent analysis yielded the fraction

Respiration measurements


The oxygen consumption rate ( MO 2 ) of a group of 3–4
animals (2.0–3.3 mm body length) carrying parthenogenetic embryos of developmental stage 1–2 [138] was
measured at 20°C as described elsewhere [74]. The respiratory medium consisted of M4 medium containing 10
mM buffer (HEPES: pH 7.8, MES: pH 6.0, citrate: pH 5.5).
Tetrazyclin and Streptomycin (12.5 mg l-1 each) was

added to reduce bacterial respiration. The specific oxygen
consumption rate was obtained by dividing the wholeanimal oxygen consumption rate by the cubic body
length.
Modelling of whole-animal CO2 transport
A topological model was derived from a geometric concept on convective-diffusive oxygen transport in daphnids
[71,112]. In this concept, the animal's complex body is
reduced to a cylindrical trunk which is wrapped by a holPage 16 of 25

low cylinder representing the carapace (Figure 3A). The
carapace is a double-walled, hollow structure that is perfused with hemolymph. The hollow-cylindric space
between the carapace and the trunk is occupied by the respiratory medium. As a simplification of the reference
model (Figure 3A), the present model is composed of
only five subdomains (Figure 3B). These are the inner
hemolymph lacuna, a single tissue layer, the outer hemolymph lacuna, the respiratory medium, and the carapace
hemolymph lacuna, as outlined in the conceptual overview of the compartment model (Figure 3C). Each subdomain has a total length L and is divided into N
compartments of length dL.
The processes operating within each compartment and in
between adjacent/connected compartments include (i)
the excretion of CO2 from tissue into hemolymph, (ii) the
CO2 hydration and acid-base reactions in hemolymph
and medium, (iii) the convective transport of reaction
species, and (iv) the diffusive transport of CO2 across
cuticular barriers. A mathematical formulation of the
physico-chemical processes is given for a single compartment of the outer hemolymph lacuna. For compartments
of other subdomains, equations can be derived in an analogous manner.

equilibrium in the CO2+H2OH++ HCO 3 reaction. The

protonation rate constant for the carbonate and the nonbicarbonate buffer was assumed to be of the magnitude of
1010 M-1 s-1 [111]. The dissociation equilibrium constants

ditions of the medium compartment were set to the
properties of the inspired medium (pH 8.06 and 0.035
kPa PCO2). A number of N = 50 compartments was chosen
per subdomain. Starting with the initial conditions, the
model status was allowed to evolve until quasi steadystate conditions (relative concentration changes < 10-6)
were reached.
Statistics and Numerics
If not stated otherwise, data are expressed as means ±
standard error, with N indicating the number of independent measurements. Differences in a physiological
variable among the acclimation groups were checked
using a one-way analysis on variance (ANOVA) or the
Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on whether the data passed
the normality test and the equal variance test. Statistical
differences were considered as significant at P < 0.05. Multiple pairwise comparisons against the control (pH 7.8)
group were performed using the Holm-Sidak test or
Dunn's method, using an experimentwise significance
level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using
SigmaStat (version 3.1; SPSS Inc.).

Numerical problems were solved in Matlab 7.0 (MathWorks, Inc.). The 'lsqnonlin' function (optimization toolbox) was used to fit the model in equation 1 to the PCO2pH data. The uncertainty in the calculation of PCO2, given
the pH and the calibration buffer curve, was determined
by a nonlinear algorithm [142,143]. The 'rlowess' function (curve-fitting toolbox) was applied for the smoothing

of spectra. In-built functions for matrix operations
(including that for the calculation of the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse) were used to implement the reiterative
least-squares spectral resolution [137] and the multicomponent analysis [139] (Additional file 4), whereas the
'fminsearch' function (optimization toolbox) provided
the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm [144]. The nonlinear
system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) was
numerically solved using the 'ode15s' solver for stiff problems.

Annotations, sequence alignments and phylogenetic
analysis
The D. pulex genome database was screened for carbonic
anhydrase-like sequences by a keyword search in the automatically-created annotations and by a 'blastp alignment
search' of the Dappu v1.1 gene builds (July, 2007) [117].
All gene models containing carbonic anhydrase-like
sequences were manually curated and annotated (Table
4). The derived amino-acid sequences were classified
using the conserved domain database (CDD) and search
engine v2.13 [145,146]. Homolog sequences from other
organisms were retrieved using the blastp algorithm
[147]. All sequences were checked for the presence of Nterminal signal peptides using the SignalP V3.0 server
[148-150]. Potential GPI-anchor sites were identified by
GPI-SOM [151,152], the big-PI Predictor [153,154] and
FragAnchor [155,156]. Multiple-sequence alignments
were performed using the T-Coffee algorithm [157-159]
and displayed with ESPript [160,161]. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm
[162] and a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Trees
were visualized using iTOL [163,164].

Multiple sequence alignment of -carbonic anhydrases. The -CA
sequences are divided into four groups according to similarity. Residues
strictly conserved have a red background, residues well conserved within a
group according to a Risler matrix [122] are indicated by red letters. Residues conserved between groups are boxed. Secondary structure elements
of three human -CAs are shown in blue on the top: helices with squiggles,
beta strands with arrows, alpha and beta turns with TTT and TT letters.
The numbering refers to HsCA2. Amino acid residues involved in zincbinding and in the hydrogen-bonding network are indicated by red triangles. Yellow and orange backgrounds indicate mitochondrial targeting
peptide or predicted signal peptides for secretory export. Pink and green
backgrounds signify a transmembrane domain or potential glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor sites. Daphnia pulex sequences are indicated by red labels. Additionally included were related sequences from the
blue crab Callinectes sapidus (Cs), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm),
Anopheles gambiae (Ag), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), the sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp), and Homo sapiens (Hs).
Sequences were aligned using the T-Coffee algorithm [158] and displayed
with ESPript [120,161]. Sequence references, protein data bank (PDB)
