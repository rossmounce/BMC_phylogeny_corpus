Chromosome spreading of associated
transposable elements and ribosomal DNA in the
fish Erythrinus erythrinus. Implications for
genome change and karyoevolution in fish
Marcelo B Cioffi1*, Cesar Martins2, Luiz AC Bertollo1

Abstract
Background: The fish, Erythrinus erythrinus, shows an interpopulation diversity, with four karyomorphs differing by
chromosomal number, chromosomal morphology and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Karyomorph A has a
diploid number of 2n = 54 and does not have differentiated sex chromosomes. Karyomorph D has 2n = 52
chromosomes in females and 2n = 51 in males, and it is most likely derived from karyomorph A by the
differentiation of a multiple X1X2Y sex chromosome system. In this study, we analyzed karyomorphs A and D by
means of cytogenetic approaches to evaluate their evolutionary relationship.
Results: Conspicuous differences in the distribution of the 5S rDNA and Rex3 non-LTR retrotransposon were found
between the two karyomorphs, while no changes in the heterochromatin and 18S rDNA patterns were found
between them. Rex3 was interstitially dispersed in most chromosomes. It had a compartmentalized distribution in
the centromeric regions of only two acrocentric chromosomes in karyomorph A. In comparison, in karyomorph D,
Rex3 was found in 22 acrocentric chromosomes in females and 21 in males. All 5S rDNA sites co-localized with
Rex3, suggesting that these are associated in the genome. In addition, the origin of the large metacentric Y
chromosome in karyomorph D by centric fusion was highlighted by the presence of internal telomeric sites and 5S
rDNA/Rex3 sites on this chromosome.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that some repetitive DNAs (5S rDNA, Rex3 retroelement and (TTAGGG)n telomeric
repeats) were crucial for the evolutionary divergence inside E. erythrinus. These elements were strongly associated
with the karyomorphic evolution of this species. Our results indicate that chromosomal rearrangements and
genomic modifications were significant events during the course of evolution of this fish. We detected centric
fusions that were associated with the differentiation of the multiple sex chromosomes in karyomorph D, as well as
a surprising increase of associated 5S rDNA/Rex3 loci, in contrast to karyomorph A. In this sense, E. erythrinus
emerges as an excellent model system for better understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the huge
genome diversity in fish. This organism can also contribute to understanding vertebrate genome evolution as a
whole.

Background
Repetitive DNA sequences include tandemly-arrayed
satellites, as well as minisatellites, microsatellites and
dispersed repeats such as transposable elements (TEs)
[1]. Satellite DNAs are organized as long arrays of head* Correspondence: mbello.ufscar@gmail.com

to-tail linked repeats. TEs are DNA segments capable of
integrating into new locations in the genome, and they
also mobilize non-autonomous sequences [2,3]. TEs and
satellite DNAs are some of the most important components of the genome that contribute to genetic variations within and between species [4]. The possible
functions of these repetitive DNAs have been the focus
of several studies, and there are indications that they

could play important roles at both the chromosomal and
nuclear levels [5-8].
Fish genomes contain all known types of transposable
elements: classical DNA transposons, miniature
inverted-repeat transposable elements and retroelements, which include long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons [9]. While
DNA transposons move directly as DNA molecules
from one genomic site to another, retroelements transpose via an RNA intermediate. Among retrotransposable
elements, Rex is comprised of various families of transposable elements that are abundant in teleosts. Rex3, the
first reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding retrotransposon
isolated from the melanoma fish model, Xiphophorus, is
a non-LTR element related to the RTE family that
shows wide distribution and different patterns of organization in the genomes of several fish species [10,11].
The molecular organization and cytogenetic locations
of repetitive DNAs, including rDNA repeats [12-18],
satellite DNAs [19,20], telomeric sequences [18,21,22]
and several classes of TEs [2,3,23,24], have been analyzed in a large number of fish species. These studies
have demonstrated the enormous potential that the
investigation of repetitive DNAs offers toward extending
our knowledge of karyotype differentiation and sex
chromosome evolution in fish [16,18,25-29]. These
genomic components are able to change the molecular
composition of sex chromosomes and reduce the rate of
recombination between them, which are crucial steps in
the differentiation of sex chromosomes [30-33].
Erythrinus is a cytogenetically poorly studied genus
inside the Erythrinidae family. Until now, classical cytogenetic analyses have only been conducted with the species, E. erythrinus. These have shown a karyotypic
diversity among populations, with four currently identified karyomorphs (A to D) [34]. Karyomorph A is comprised of populations with 2n = 54 chromosomes, which
have very similar karyotypic structures (6m + 2st + 46a)
and an absence of differentiated sex chromosomes. Karyomorphs B, C and D share an X1 X 1 X 2 X 2 /X 1 X 2 Y sex
chromosome system, but they differ in their diploid
number and chromosomal morphology. It has been proposed that a centric fusion between two non-homologous acrocentric chromosomes may have created the
specific Y chromosome and, consequently, the unpaired
X1 and X2 chromosomes in the male karyotypes. Karyomorph B has 2n = 54 (6m + 2st + 46a) chromosomes in
females and 2n = 53 (7m + 2st + 44a) in males. Both
karyomorphs C and D show 2n = 52/51 chromosomes
but differ in their karyotypic formula, i.e., 6m + 2sm +
6st + 38a in females and 7m + 2sm + 6st + 36a in
males of karyomorph C and 4m + 2sm + 2st + 44a in
females and 5m + 2sm + 2st + 42a in males of karyomorph D. The distinct chromosomal features found

among isolated populations suggest the occurrence of
several unnamed new species within this fish group [34].
In this report, new samples from allopatric populations of karyomorphs A and D were analyzed using new
methodological approaches and molecular cytogenetic
analyses to find useful new characteristics for comparative genomics at the chromosomal level and to provide
insights into the karyoevolutionary pathways in this fish
group. The results show that chromosomal rearrangements and genomic modifications were significant
events during the course of evolution of this fish. Centric fusions were found to be clearly associated with the
differentiation of the multiple sex chromosomes in karyomorph D. In addition, a surprising increase in the
number of associated 5S rDNA/Rex3 loci was found in
karyomorph D, in contrast to karyomorph A.

Results
Karyotyping and C-banding

The two populations showed evidence of the general
karyotypic structures of the Erythrinus species, with few
biarmed chromosomes and a large number of acrocentric ones (Fig. 1). The sample from Penápolis-SP
showed 2n = 54 chromosomes (6m + 2st + 46a) and
lacked morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes,
which is characteristic of karyomorph A. The samples
from Natal-RN showed 2n = 52 chromosomes (4m +
2sm + 2st + 42a) in females and 2n = 51 chromosomes
(5m + 2sm + 2st + 42a) in males, with a multiple
X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 /X 1 X 2 Y sex chromosome system, which is
characteristic of karyomorph D (Fig. 1). Conspicuous Cpositive bands were observed in the centromeric/pericentromeric region of several chromosomes, as well as
in the telomeric region of some pairs, in both karyomorphs. A small but significant heterochromatic block
was found in the interstitial region of the long arms of
the Y and X1 chromosomes of karyomorph D (Fig. 1).
Nucleotide sequences

Nucleotide sequences were determined for the Rex3
clones to confirm that the PCR-isolated DNA fragments
corresponded to copies of the retrotransposable element,
Rex3. One of these sequences was deposited in GenBank
under the accession number, GU989321. NCBI BlastN
searches identified a similarity between the E. erythrinus
Rex3 sequence and sequences found in fish from other
distinct orders, such as Anguilliformes, Perciformes,
Beloniformes,
Cyprinodontiformes
and
Tetraodontiformes.
Cytogenetic mapping of 18S and 5S rDNAs, Rex3 and
(TTAGGG)n telomeric repeats

Double-FISH with 5S and 18S rDNAs showed a similar
distribution pattern for the 18S rDNA sites in both the

analysis. Note the significant increase of 5S rDNA sites in karyomorph D. m, metacentric chromosomes; sm, submetacentric chromosomes; st,

A and D karyomorphs. Five acrocentric pairs with telomeric sites on the long or short arms were found. In
addition, bitelomeric sites were found on pair no. 14. In
contrast, a large difference was seen in 5S rDNA distribution. Karyomorph A showed only two 5S rDNA sites
in the centromeric region of acrocentric pair no. 8,
which also bears a telomeric 18S rDNA site on its long
arm. Although karyomorph D shared the syntenic condition seen in karyomorph A, it showed a surprising
increase in the number of 5S rDNA sites, with 22 in
females and 21 in males. These sites were all found in
the centromeric region of acrocentric chromosomes
except for a site in the metacentric Y chromosome in
males (Fig. 1).
Double-FISH with 5S rDNA and Rex3 probes showed
that Rex3 has an interstitial and dispersed distribution
pattern along most chromosomes in both karyomorphs.
In addition, Rex3 clusters were predominantly located in
the centromeric regions and co-localized with heterochromatic blocks in both karyomorphs, which matches
the 5S rDNA distribution pattern (Fig. 2).
Mapping of the (TTAGGG) n telomeric repeats in
males of karyomorph D showed the typically expected
telomeric signals on both telomeres of all chromosomes.
Interstitial telomeric sites (ITS) were located in the centromeric regions of the only submetacentric pair and on
the largest metacentric Y chromosome (Fig. 3).

Discussion
Among Characiformes fish, which include the Erythrinidae family, the most frequent chromosomal number
is 2n = 54, and this number may represent the basal
diploid number of this order [35]. In this context,
karyomorph A of E. erythrinus, which has a diploid

number of 2n = 54, may have the most primitive karyotype found in the Erythrinus genus. This finding
also takes into account the fact that differentiated sex
chromosomes are absent in this karyomorph. Similarly, karyomorph D, which is most likely derived
from karyomorph A, shows a smaller diploid number
due to chromosomal rearrangements and a well-differentiated multiple X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 /X 1 X 2 Y sex chromosome system. However, despite differences in diploid
numbers and the occurrence of differentiated sex
chromosomes, karyomorphs A and D share a relatively similar karyotypic structure formed by several
acrocentric and a few biarmed chromosomes with
similarly distributed C-bands and 18S rDNA sites.
However, the repetitive 5S rDNA and Rex3 sequences
have quite distinct distributions in the two
karyomorphs.
A reduction in chromosome numbers often results
from centric fusion rearrangements from acrocentric
chromosomes. Based only on classical cytogenetic data,
it was previously proposed that an initial centric fusion
gave rise to the X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y sex system found in
karyomorphs B, C and D of E. erythrinus. Also, it was
proposed that the differentiation of karyomorph D
resulted from another centric fusion between two nonhomologous acrocentric chromosomes, which was the
origin of the only submetacentric pair found in the karyotype. In addition, pericentric inversions completed
this karyotypic differentiation by decreasing the number
of metacentric chromosomes and increasing the number
of acrocentric chromosomes [34]. Indeed, this karyomorphic differentiation in E. erythrinus has now been
corroborated by our FISH mapping of repetitive DNA
sequences (Fig. 4).

Figure 2 Metaphase plates of karyomorphs A and D of Erythrinus erythrinus showing the locations of the 5S rDNA and the Rex3
retroelement on the chromosomes using double-FISH analysis. Note the dispersed interstitial pattern of Rex3 in both karyomorphs and its
co-localization with the 5S rDNA on the centromeric region of the chromosomes. The box indicates the clear aggregation of some acrocentric
chromosomes, which was seen in almost all chromosome preparations. The Y chromosome is indicated. Bar = 5 μm.

The chromosomal location of 5S rDNA, Rex3 and
telomeric repeats clearly corroborates the centric fusions
that occurred during the karyotypic differentiation of
karyomorph D. The mapping of ITS in the centromeric
region of the submetacentric pair highlights the centric
fusion that was involved in the origin of this chromosome pair, which is not found in karyomorph A. Similarly, our results support the proposed origin for the
largest metacentric Y chromosome from another centric
fusion. As expected, (TTAGGG) n repeats were also
found in the centromeric region of this chromosome
(Fig. 3). ITS have been found in the centromeric region
of a large number of vertebrate species, suggesting that
chromosomal rearrangements can occur without the
loss of these telomeric sequences [36]. The general
hypothesis that ITS may be remnants of chromosome
rearrangements that occurred during genome evolution
is supported by several investigations [37].
The location of 5SrDNA/Rex3 sequences at the centromeric position of the Y chromosome is of particular
relevance. These sequences were found in the centromeric region of several acrocentric chromosomes,
including the ones proposed as X1 (no. 5) and X2 (no.
12) in the karyotype. The mapping of 5S rDNA/Rex3
sites in the centromeric region of the Y chromosome
suggests that this chromosome was created from a centric fusion of acrocentric pairs (nos. 5 and 12), which
gave rise to the unpaired X 1 and X 2 chromosomes in
the male karyotype (Figs. 1 and 2). Although the

identification of the X2 chromosome remains unclear,
the X1 chromosome appears to be the first acrocentric
pair (no. 5) in this karyotype. This result is supported
by the C-banding pattern in which a faint but informative C-positive band occurs interstitially in corresponding regions of the X1 chromosome and the long arm of
the Y chromosome. It is probable that the same centric
fusion also gave rise to the X1X2Y sex system in karyomorphs B and C, since it appears to have originated
before the divergence of these three karyomorphs [34]
(Fig. 4).
The most remarkable difference between karyomorphs
A and D was the distribution of 5S rDNA/Rex3 sites
over the chromosomes. While only a single chromosome pair was found to bear these sites in karyomorph
A, a surprisingly large number of these sites were found
in karyomorph D, with 22 sites in females and 21 in
males. (Figs 2 and 4). Rex3, a non-LTR retrotransposon
first isolated from the platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus,
shows a wide distribution among teleost fishes, where it
appears to be associated with the evolution of different
lineages [10,11]. Although Rex3 shows a preferential
localization in the centromeric region of chromosomes
in some fishes [23,24,38-40], it is widely scattered over
all chromosomes in several Antarctic ice-fish species,
with intense hybridization signals in some specific chromosomal regions [3]. Since a large majority of fish species studied until now harbor a low number of 5S
rDNA sites, with a few exceptions [41,42], the high

number of 5S rDNA sites found in karyomorph D was
an intriguing feature. According to the most probable
hypothesis that karyomorph D represents a derivative
form compared to karyomorph A, our results clearly
show a huge dispersal of 5S rDNA/Rex3 elements
throughout the centromeric regions of the acrocentric
chromosomes. We hypothesize that Rex3 may have
inserted into 5S rDNA sequences and that the 5S
rDNA-Rex3 complex moved and dispersed in the karyotype, although this hypothesis deserves further investigation and a molecular characterization. The clear
association among the centromeric regions of the acrocentric chromosomes appears to be a favorable condition for this spreading (see details in Fig. 2).
Previous reports have suggested that the rDNA locus
can serve as an ideal niche for the long-term survival of
TEs [43], as seen in several organisms [44-46]. In situ
hybridization revealed permanent clustering of different
TEs in the NOR regions, as well as near or within clusters of 5S rDNA [45,47]. Hybridization on extended
DNA fibers identified insertions of TEs inside the rDNA
region, the overlap of rDNA and TE-enriched regions,
and small fragments of rDNA inside TE-enriched
regions. The presence of TEs in or around rDNA sites
increases the possibility for recombination, which
appears to be a common event in plant karyotype evolution [48]. In flowering plants, the distribution of 5S
rDNA genes is highly variable and may be partially
explained by the activity of small non-autonomous retrotransposons named Cassandra [49]. It is currently

Page 5 of 9

believed that TEs tend to accumulate in heterochromatic regions because there are fewer genes and a
weaker selection in the heterochromatin than in the
euchromatin [50]. Recent studies have proposed that the
activity of TEs is one possible source for rDNA movement [43,48]. Studies have also documented the ability
of some classes of transposons to capture entire genes
and move them to different parts of the genome [51,52].
Thus, considering the correlation between karyotype
rearrangement and retrotransposon activity [3], and that
rapid chromosomal evolution in some vertebrate
lineages may be driven by the activity of repetitive
sequences [53], we propose two probable alternatives
during the karyotypic diversification of E. erythrinus, i.e.,
(i) the chromosomes of this species have undergone
rearrangements during an evolutionary process mediated
by retrotransposon activity or (ii) rearrangement events,
including posterior mobilization of TEs, promoted the
karyotypic differentiation among populations. However,
it is difficult to state if a change in TE content or activity is the cause or the consequence of a speciation process because the true role of transposable elements in
speciation is still a subject of large debate [6].
The frequent switching between different sex determination systems and the rapid evolution of sex chromosomes in fishes may also be linked to the formation of
new species [54]. Recent comparative studies have
revealed that teleost genomes have experienced a higher
rate of gene-linkage disruption and chromosomal rearrangements compared to mammals, which may be
linked to the apparent plasticity of their genomes
[55,56]. Studies in fish models would therefore help in
better understanding the molecular and evolutionary
mechanisms underlying the huge genome diversity in
this group, and these studies would also contribute to
our understanding of vertebrate genome evolution.

Conclusion
Our in situ investigation of repetitive DNA sequences
resulted in useful new characteristics for comparative
genomics at the chromosomal level and provided
insights into the karyoevolutionary pathways in E. erythrinus fish. Chromosomal rearrangements and genomic
modifications were significant events during the course
of karyoevolution of this fish. The spreading of associated transposable elements and ribosomal DNA in the
genome and the differentiation of a multiple sex chromosome system was strongly associated with the evolution of karyomorph D. Considering the facts that fish
occupy the basal position in the phylogeny of vertebrates, that they have a diversity of sex determining
mechanisms and that many fish species lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes, E. erythrinus emerges as an
excellent model system for better understanding the

evolutionary mechanisms underlying the huge genome
diversity found among vertebrates.

Methods
Specimens, mitotic chromosome preparation,
chromosome staining and karyotyping

In this study, we analyzed new samples from populations of karyomorphs A and D of the fish, E. erythrinus.
We studied a total of 28 specimens (16 males and 12
females). Overall, 13 specimens (8 males and 5 females)
of karyomorph A were obtained from Penápolis - São
Paulo State, and 15 specimens (8 males and 7 females)
of karyomorph D were obtained from Natal - Rio
Grande do Norte State. These samples belong to distinct
Brazilian hydrographic basins, which are isolated by
thousands of kilometers.
Mitotic chromosomes were obtained from cell suspensions of the anterior kidney using the conventional airdrying method [57]. The experiments followed ethical
conducts, and anesthesia was used prior to sacrificing
the animals. The process was approved by the FAPESP
committee under no. 2009/14881-3. Chromosomes were
sequentially Giemsa-stained and C-banded using barium
hydroxide to detect the C-positive heterochromatin [58].

Approximately 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed per
specimen to determine the diploid chromosome number
and karyotype structure. Images were captured by the
CoolSNAP system software, Image Pro Plus, 4.1 (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), coupled to an
Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Ishikawa, Japan). The chromosomes were classified as metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), subtelocentric (st) or
acrocentric (a) according to the arm ratios [59].
Chromosome probes

Two tandemly-arrayed DNA sequences isolated from
the genome of another Erythrinidae species, Hoplias
malabaricus, were used. The first probe contained a 5S
rDNA repeat copy and included 120 base pairs (bp) of
the 5S rRNA transcribing gene and 200 bp of the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) [12]. The second probe corresponded to a 1,400-bp segment of the 18S rRNA gene
obtained via PCR from nuclear DNA [16]. The 5S and
18S rDNA probes were cloned into plasmid vectors and
propagated in DH5a E. coli competent cells (Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA, USA).
The retrotransposable element, Rex3, was obtained by
PCR directly from the genome of E. erythrinus using the

Cioffi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:271
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/271

primers Rex3f (5′-CGG TGA YAA AGG GCA GCC
CTG) and Rex3r (5′-TGG CAG ACN GGG GTG GTG
GT- 3′), as previously described [2,3]. The obtained
nucleotide segment of the Rex3 transposon corresponds
to the encoding domains 1, 2, 2A, A and B of the RT
gene [2]. A PCR-generated amplicon (~500 bp) was isolated from a gel, purified with the Sephaglas Band Prep
Kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) and ligated into
the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany).
This plasmid was used to transform DH5a E. coli competent cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The positive clones were sequenced on an ABI Prism 377 DNA
sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Branchburg, NJ, USA) with
the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer, Branchburg, NJ,
USA). The nucleotide sequence was subjected to Blastn
[60] searches at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/blast for the identification of any similarity of the
isolated sequences to any known sequences from the
nucleotide collection (nt/nr), whole-genome shotgun
reads (WGS), genomic survey sequences (GSS) and
high-throughput genomic sequences (HTGS) in
GenBank.
The 5S rDNA probe was labeled with biotin-14-dATP
by nick translation according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (BioNick™Labeling System; Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA, USA). The 18S rDNA and Rex3 probes
were labeled by nick translation with DIG-11-dUTP
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany).
A probe from the telomeric DNA sequence
(TTAGGG) n was generated by PCR (PCR DIG-Probe
Synthesis Kit, Roche) in the absence of a template using
(TTAGGG)5 and (CCCTAA)5 as primers [37].
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
under high stringency conditions on mitotic chromosome spreads [61]. The metaphase chromosome slides
were incubated with RNAse (40 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at 37°C.
After denaturation of chromosomal DNA in 70% formamide/2× SSC at 70°C, spreads were incubated in 2× SSC
for 4 min at 70°C. The hybridization mixture (2.5 ng/μl
probes, 2 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA, 50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulphate) was dropped on the
slides, and the hybridization was performed overnight at
37°C in a moist chamber containing 2× SSC. Two posthybridization washes were carried out on a shaker (150
rpm) at 37°C. The first wash was in 2× SSC, 50% formamide for 15 min, followed by a second wash in 2× SSC
for 15 min. A final wash was performed at room temperature in 4× SSC for 15 min. Avidin-FITC (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was used for signal detection of the 5S
rDNA probe and anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) for 18S rDNA, Rex3 and

Page 7 of 9

(TTAGGG)n probes. One-color FISH was performed to
detect (TTAGGG)n repeats, while 5S/18S rDNA and 5S
rDNA/Rex3 were detected by double-FISH. The chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI (1.2 μg/ml),
mounted in Antifade solution (Vector, Burlingame, CA,
USA) and analyzed in an epifluorescence microscope
