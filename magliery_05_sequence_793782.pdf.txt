Abstract
Background: The recent explosion in the availability of complete genome sequences has led to
the cataloging of tens of thousands of new proteins and putative proteins. Many of these proteins
can be structurally or functionally categorized from sequence conservation alone. In contrast, little
attention has been given to the meaning of poorly-conserved sites in families of proteins, which are
typically assumed to be of little structural or functional importance.
Results: Recently, using statistical free energy analysis of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains,
we observed that positions in contact with peptide ligands are more variable than surface positions
in general. Here we show that statistical analysis of TPRs, ankyrin repeats, Cys2His2 zinc fingers and
PDZ domains accurately identifies specificity-determining positions by their sequence variation.
Sequence variation is measured as deviation from a neutral reference state, and we present
probabilistic and information theory formalisms that improve upon recently suggested methods
such as statistical free energies and sequence entropies.
Conclusion: Sequence variation has been used to identify functionally-important residues in four
selected protein families. With TPRs and ankyrin repeats, protein families that bind highly diverse
ligands, the effect is so pronounced that sequence "hypervariation" alone can be used to predict
ligand binding sites.

Background
The central challenge of the post-genomic era is to determine the structures and functions of thousands of newlyidentified putative proteins [1,2]. Elucidating how proteins carry out their functions in diverse contexts and in
organisms from all three domains of life is both fundamentally important to understanding biological function
and critical for engineering new functions into novel proteins. Sequence conservation alone can be used to structurally categorize many proteins or putative proteins [3].
Additionally, catalytic sites in enzymes can sometimes be

identified from conserved surface motifs [4-8]. In contrast, sites with poor sequence conservation have been
largely ignored, because they are assumed to be of little
structural or functional importance [9].
Sequence alignment of proteins with similar structures
has shown that as sequence identity increases, average
backbone variation decreases [10]. Within a particular
protein family, residues in the hydrophobic core are the
most conserved, implying they play a key role in specifying the fold [11]. In contrast, solvent-exposed residues

tend to be variable, with mutations having little deleterious effect on overall structure or stability [12]. Consequently, conservation of surface residues is commonly
taken to be an indication of functional importance [13].
This idea can be used to identify active-site residues from
a collection of proteins that perform the same function,
but it is not applicable to families of proteins that use a
common scaffold to bind diverse ligands. Rather, we might
hypothesize that such binding sites will be composed of
positions that are variable.
Recently, we used a statistical free energy (SFE) approach
[14,15] to understand better the role of conserved residues in defining tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs,
which are thought to commonly mediate protein-protein
interactions [16]. Strikingly, we found that the ligandbinding site of the motif can readily be identified by
sequence hypervariation of positions proximal to the ligand, as evidenced by very low statistical free energies separating those positions from a position-independent
reference state. Here, we examine this observation in more
detail and demonstrate that specificity-determining residues in TPRs, ankyrin (Ank) repeats, Cys2His2 zinc fingers
(Zifs), and PDZ domains can be identified from sequence
variation.
By analyzing protein families with exceptional biochemical and biophysical characterization, we show that, when
the ligand repertoire is highly diverse for a particular family, the binding site can be identified from sequence
hypervariation alone. However, even when the ligands
have significant features in common, sequence variation
can be used to "dissect" binding sites to identify specificity-determining residues. We demonstrate this sequence
variation using probabilistic and information theory
approaches closely tied to the mathematics of covariation,
which are more suitable for this type of analysis than SFEs
or Shannon entropies. Statistical identification of specificity-determining residues will greatly facilitate the engineering proteins with novel functions and targets.

Results & discussion
The TPR binding site
The TPR is a common 34 amino-acid protein motif that
occurs in arrays, most frequently with three contiguous
repeats [17]. Although TPR domains are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions, only a few examples have
been well characterized. The large number of known TPR
sequences, nearly 10,000 in Pfam [18], makes this motif
an excellent target for statistical analysis. Using several
mathematical approaches, we calculated the separation of
the amino acid distribution at each position in TPRs from
a position-independent reference state, amino acid usage
in all proteins in yeast (Figure 1a). Note that we have performed this calculation on all of the 34 positions in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/240

TPR motif; TPR domains are made up of tandem repeats
of the TPR motif.
When relative entropy values are mapped onto the ligandbound co-crystal structures of two different three-TPR
domains (the TPR1 and TPR2A domains from HspOrganizing Protein, HOP [19]), it is immediately apparent that the concave, peptide-binding face of the TPR
domains is more variable (i.e., more like the reference
state) than the convex, solvent-exposed face (Figure 1b
and 1c). For clarity, the concave surfaces in Figure 1d are
depicted with coloration of only ligand-binding residues
independently identified from crystallographic analysis
[19]. For both TPR domains, every residue in contact with
the ligand peptide is in a position with a small relative
entropy (blue or green in the figures), indicating small differences from the reference distribution.
This hypervariation is a consequence of each TPR having
evolved to bind a different specific ligand (or portion of a
ligand). When TPR proteins are considered collectively,
the binding positions are statistically randomized to an
extent that is dictated by the repertoire of amino acids
required to perform the range of binding functions. In
contrast, solvent-exposed residues in general mutate in a
stochastic fashion throughout evolution, slowly reverting
or "drifting" toward a "neutral" distribution. The lack of
structural or functional importance of solvent-exposed
residues results in little selective pressure against mutation, but the extent of randomization is limited by evolutionary time and subtle factors such as overall protein
solubility. As a result of the high diversity of the ligands of
TPR repeats, the binding surface is more variable than the
solvent-exposed surface. Specifically, we predict that the
ligand-binding residues that show the most sequence variation are the positions that determine ligand specificity.
Positions 2, 5, 9, 12, 13, 33 and 34 show the most
sequence variation in TPRs (i.e., they have the lowest relative entropies, ≤ 0.30). These seven residues all lie on the
same face of the motif, and they are the residues that are
exposed on the concave face of TPR domains. In fact, the
TPR-peptide co-crystal structures show that residues in
positions 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 13 are used by HOP TPR1 and
TPR2A to bind their ligands [19]. Since few TPR-ligand
structures have been solved, it remains to be seen whether
or not other TPR domains utilize positions 33 and 34.
Their spatial proximity to the other binding residues suggests that this is likely.
It is not surprising that some of the positions in contact
with the ligand peptides are more biased than others
(such as position 6). Some positions used for binding
may also have other restrictions (such as structural restrictions) that limit the repertoire of amino acids allowed,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/240

and some positions may be important for binding affinity
but not for specificity (which is to say they may bind a feature that is common among all ligands). For example,
position 6 is modestly conserved in TPRs overall (it is frequently Asn) and is more buried than the other binding
positions. The position-6 residues make contacts to the
backbone of the ligand peptides here. It is worth noting
that a position-6 Asn in the PEX5 C-terminal TPR domain
also appears to make contact to the peptide backbone of
the unrelated peroxisomal targeting signal peptide [20].
Several of the spheres in TPR2A are grey, indicating that
they correspond to non-canonical positions and were
therefore not calculated. At present, our analysis does not
consider the effect of insertions and deletions. In the
future, one could imagine including "deletion" as another
"amino acid," so that site occupancy would contribute to
the variation score.
Measuring sequence variation
The use of metrics that measure the difference from a position-independent reference distribution is key to our
observation, because (1) it is not clear how mere lack of
conservation is related to variability, and (2) the likelihood of mutation from one residue to another is affected
by factors such as genetic code bias and the greater difficulty of accommodating bulky or reactive amino acids.
Here, we take the reference state to be amino acid usage in
all open reading frames in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [21],
which is independent of position but accounts for genetic
code bias and amino acid chemistry. Using SFE calculations, we have previously demonstrated that using this reference state gives virtually indistinguishable results from
other position-independent reference states such as
amino acid usage in all proteins in the Pfam database
[16].

We originally noted that the ligand binding site of TPRs
was identified by sequence variation using statistical free
energies [16]. SFEs are essentially a measure of the difference between amino acid distributions, relating the
"probability" of observing a particular distribution to
thermodynamic importance based on the exponential
relationship given by the Boltzmann law.

where Px is given by

Px =

N − nx
n
fx x ( 1 − fx )
n x !( N − n x ) !

[3]

Here, N is the total number of sequences, nx is the number
of sequences with amino acid x at the given position, and
fx is the expected frequency of x from the reference state.
This "vector" formalism for estimating the overall probability is empirically quite effective, but we speculated that
a metric more tied to the mathematics of covariation
would be more rigorous for our approach.
Since both of the following are true,

∑ nx = N

and

∑ fx = 1

the probability of observing a particular distribution is
simply given by the multinomial probability,

Pmult =

As expected, the ∆Gstat values are very closely related (R2 =
0.89) to the ln Pmult values for the 34 positions in the TPR
motif (Figure 2a). Note, however, that the values of ∆Gstat
and ln Pmult are dependent upon the total number of
sequences N (since it is much less likely to observe a particular amino acid 200 times out of 1000 than 20 out of
100, if you are expecting it only 5% of the time).

Recently, Dekker et al. suggested that SFEs are merely a
measure of sequence (Shannon) entropy (Hi), which
implicitly measures how a distribution varies from equal
usage [22]. (This is because the maximum entropy arises
from a distribution with equal usage.)

Hi = −∑ px ln px

[5]

x

Here, px is the proportion of sequences with amino acid x
at position i. While it is true that ∆Gstat is correlated with
Hi (Figure 2b), this correlation is a consequence of the reference state of ∆Gstat calculations being fairly close to
equal usage of amino acids. It is also affected by the fact

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:240

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/240

that ∆Gstat values are not based on a rigorous measure of
overall probability.
Plotting the multinomial probabilities associated with the
distributions at the 34 positions in TPRs against sequence
entropy and relative entropy clearly demonstrates that ln
Pmult measures the same thing as relative entropy, but something different from sequence entropy (Figure 2c). (The
difference becomes more dramatic the more the reference
state deviates from equal usage.) In fact, relative entropy
D(p||f) is an information theory approach to measuring
the "distance" between distributions, given by,

D(p || f ) = ∑ px ln
x

px
fx

[6]

It can be shown, using the Stirling approximation for factorials, that multinomial probability is in fact linearly
related to relative entropy by the number of sequences
(see Supplemental Material).
One significant advantage of relative entropy over multinomial probability and ∆Gstat is that relative entropy is
independent of the total number of sequences N. Since the
intention of the SFE approach is to estimate the significance associated with an amino acid distribution relative
to a reference state, we submit that relative entropies are
the most convenient way to do this. Relative entropies
combine the sample-size independence and ease of calculation of Shannon entropies with the reference-state correction of Lockess & Ranganathan's method, while at the
same time measuring that correction in a mathematicallyrigorous way.
Other methods, in addition to Shannon entropy and the
Lockless & Ranaganthan method, have been suggested for
scoring residue conservation, including metrics that
account for residue properties such as size or hydrophobicity [23]. There is evidence that binding sites have
unique compositional preferences, which may suggest
alternative reference states for our method [24]. It will be
interesting to examine how attention to property variation
may improve our method of dissecting binding sites in
structural families.
Effects of sample size
In order to determine how many sequences are required
to identify binding residues in TPRs by this method, subsets of various sizes were randomly selected from the
6,887 TPR sequences. In Figure 3a, the average relative
entropy values from subsets (5 each) with approximately
6887, 3444, 1722, 861, 430, 215 and 108 randomlyselected sequences are shown for all positions. The overall
pattern is evident with as few as about 100 sequences, and
there is virtually no difference between subsets with 400

861, 430, 215 and 108 sequences. Each bar is the average of
five subsets of the same size (except 6887, since there is only
one set this size – all sequences). (b) Relative entropies associated with five randomly chosen subsets of various sizes for

or more sequences. Values from the five random subsets
of each size are shown for the seven lowest relative
entropy positions in the full data set (Figure 3b). Again,
there is essentially no discernable difference down to as
few as 400 sequences, and there is not significant variability until one examines fewer than 200 sequences. We
therefore expect that this analysis is applicable to protein
families with as few as about 200–400 sequences.

Ankyrin repeats: comparison with experiment
A corresponding analysis of ankyrin (Ank) repeats,
another experimentally well-characterized protein-binding motif, clearly confirms our prediction that low relative
entropies can be used to identify specificity-determining
residues when the repertoire of ligand is highly variable.
Anks are helix-turn-helix-loop motifs, which bind their
ligands with residues in the loops and on the surface of
the helical array proximal to the loops [25]. Figure 4
shows the relative entropies from over 15,000 Ank repeats
mapped onto the co-crystal structure of mouse GA binding protein β1 with the GABPα ligand bound [26]. Again,
our analysis dramatically reveals that the residues known
to form the binding site are among the most variable; the
positions most like the reference state (relative entropy ≤
0.39) are 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 17, 32, and 33.

Significantly, the functional importance of the residues we
have identified has already been verified experimentally.
Plückthun and colleagues considered four Ank-ligand cocrystal structures and chose key interacting residues in Ank
repeats from those whose solvent accessibility was most
changed upon ligand binding: positions 2, 3, 5, 13, 14,
and 33. Ank repeat domains which bind to different ligands, for example maltose binding protein and two
kinases, have been selected from a library of Ank repeat
domains in which only these positions were randomized
[27,28]. This result confirms our proposal that these are
the specificity-determining residues. In fact, the crystal
structure of one of the selected ankyrin proteins that binds
MBP directly demonstrates the role of these residues in
binding. In addition, position 32 is close in space to these
residues, and may well participate in binding for some
Ank proteins. It is not clear why position 17, which lies in
the turn between the motif's helices, is more variable than
other non-binding surface-exposed positions.

Note that some non-binding surface-exposed positions, particularly turn residues, are conserved due to their importance in defining the Ank fold. Some positions in GABPβ1 do
not map onto the canonical Ank sequence and are colored
grey. Rendered using PyMOL from PDB entry 1AWC.

Dissecting binding sites when ligands have conserved
features
We also analyzed Cys2His2 zinc fingers (Zifs) in the same
way. In contrast to TPR and Ank repeats, which are stabilized by burial of hydrophobic residues, Zifs are mostly
stabilized by ligation of zinc(II) and binding to DNA. Not
surprisingly, then, positions that ligate the zinc ion (Cys10, Cys-7, His+7, His+11) and a subset of positions that contact the DNA (e.g., Tyr-12, Lys-5, Phe-3, Arg+9) are highly
biased (where -1 is the position immediately before the αhelix and the consensus residue is listed). Residues with
low relative entropy (≤0.5) are essentially in two patches,
near the end of the end of the helix buried in the major
groove and on the solvent-exposed surface distal to the
DNA. When one considers only the positions that are in
contact with the ligand DNA, the residues with the lowest
relative entropies (blue and green spheres in Figure 5) are
positions -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. Extensive phage-display

selection work has shown that positions -1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and
6 are critical to specificity for the target DNA sequences
studied [29,30]. In contrast, positions that contact the
DNA but have no effect on specificity, such as basic residues that make contacts to the phosphate backbone, are
essentially invariant (orange and red spheres in Figure 5).
Note that in this case the specificity-determining residues
are not necessarily the most variable residues in the motif;
they are the most variable residues in the motif that are in
contact with the ligand. Thus, for Zifs, sequence hypervariation is not sufficient to identify the binding site, but statistical analysis together with a sample structure reveals
specificity-determining positions without further characterization. Apparently, the repertoire of amino acids
needed to bind DNA in the major groove is less diverse
than that needed for the range of binding functions exhibited by TPR or Ank repeat domains.

into the major groove of the DNA, and conserved positions
that enhance affinity to DNA but do not affect specificity
(orange and red spheres). Rendered with PyMOL from PDB
entry 1A1I.

A similar phenomenon is observed for PDZ domains,
whose peptide ligands have highly conserved elements.
PDZ domains are ubiquitous globular protein-protein
interaction domains. It is thought that most PDZ domains
bind to the C-terminus of target proteins, typically making
contact to the carboxyl-terminal four to five residues. PDZ
domains can be categorized into two classes (I and II) that
bind to consensus sequences X-(S/T)-X-(V/I/L)-CO2- and
X-Φ-X-Φ-CO2-, respectively (where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue and X represents an arbitrary residue) [31].
Since our method identifies residues that vary with the
repertoire of ligands (i.e., specificity-determining residues), we would expect that positions that bind to the terminal carboxylate and C-terminal hydrophobic sidechain (P0) will be highly biased (i.e., conserved);
positions that bind to the alcohol or hydrophobic residue
at P-2 will be biased; and positions that bind to P-1 and P-3
will be highly variable. In Figure 6b, we have highlighted
the positions in the example PDZ domain 3 from PSD95
that have been identified from NMR studies and X-ray cocrystal structures to be involved in binding to the terminal
four residues of the ligand (323–328, 339, 340, 342, 372,
373, 376, 379 and 380) [32]. We also included positions
318, 322, 329 and 331, which are within 5 Å of the ligand
peptide (KQTSV-CO2-) in the example structure (computed with DeepView [33]).
The eight most variable residues in this group are 331,
342, 376, 373, 339, 328, 340 and 326. The most variable
residue, 331 (here, a glutamate), contacts the P-4 lysine,
which is variable among PDZ ligands and whose effect on
specificity has not been extensively examined. Positions
326, 328, 339, 340 and 342 interact with the variable P-1
and P-3 positions. Interestingly, computational redesign of
PDZ domain specificity confirms the central importance
of these residues in specificity determination. Reina et al.

Positions 373 and 376 contact the P-2 position, which is
either an alcohol or a hydrophobic residue depending
upon class. The identity of position 372 is known to be
highly correlated with the ligand class, because it is typically occupied by a polar residue (often histidine) for class
I ligands and by a hydrophobic residue for class II ligands
[31]. As expected, position 372 displays intermediate variability (yellow in the figure). We hypothesize that positions 373 and 376 are much more variable than 372 and
380 because they are further away from the P-2 threonine;
in fact, position 373 is farther than 5 Å away. These residues are likely more important for binding class II ligands
in which P-2 is hydrophobic and therefore generally larger.
P0 is a hydrophobic residue in virtually every known PDZ
ligand, and it invariantly presents the carboxylate terminus of the peptide. Not surprisingly, then, the residues
that it contacts (322–325, 327) are highly biased. In fact,
position 324 is a glycine in 97% of PDZ domains, and the
turn in which it lies hosts the carboxylate.

were able to change the specificity of PSD95-3 from
KQTSV to KITWV and KRTEV (retaining ligand class, since
P0 and P-2 are the same) [34]. In the first case, residues
326, 339, 340, 342, 380 and 397 were mutated. In the second case, residues 326, 328, 339, 340, 342 and 397 were
mutated. Note that position 397 is outside of the canonical PDZ domain, and so was not examined in our work;
position 380 was mutated to improve the stability of the
domain, not its binding specificity.

It is worth noting that, in contrast to the other three examples presented above, this calculation was carried out on a
whole domain instead of a repeat motif. It is also worth
noting that the binding site, as in the case of zinc fingers,
could not be easily predicted from relative variability of
sequence alone due to commonalities among the ligands
that result in conserved elements of the binding sites.
However, in combination with an example co-crystal
structure, the specificity-determining positions can again
be inferred from sequence variation, and the inference
matches closely what has been derived from extensive biochemical characterization and engineering.
The meaning of relative entropy values
In our previous study of TPRs by SFE analysis, we empirically demonstrated that for a particular sample size and
scaling, levels of sequence variation (∆Gstat) could be usefully grouped as such: 0–1.25, hypervariable or no bias;
1.25–2.5, slight bias; 2.5–5.0, significant bias; 5.0–10.0,
dramatic bias; 10+, restriction to a small subset of amino
acids [16]. Regression analysis between SFE and relative
entropy values for all TPR positions suggests that these
values correspond to relative entropies of approximately
0.3, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.5. For convenience, we therefore chose
0.0–0.3, 0.3–0.6, 0.6–0.9, 0.9–1.2 and 1.2+ as bins for
coloration of the figures in this publication. The examples
in this study suggest that "normal" surface positions typically exhibit relative entropies in the range of 0.3–0.6, and
that specificity-determining positions typically have relative entropies less than 0.5. The overlap of these values
highlights the difficulty in using this approach as a purely
predictive algorithm: only when the repertoire of ligands
is extremely diverse (as with TPRs and ankyrin repeats) is
there a clear distinction between ligand-binding residues
and surface residues in general. We are in the process of a

much broader application of this procedure to all of the
families in the Pfam database, which we will use to refine
the meaning of the relative entropy values in protein families overall (M. Gerstein, T. Gianoulis, T.J.M. and L.R.,
unpublished work).

Conclusion
The notion that positions that bind diverse ligands will be
variable among a family of proteins seems fairly obvious,
but this approach has not yet been utilized as a general
strategy. One notable precedent is seen in the original
studies of antigen-binding sites in antibodies, which were
identified as variable regions when the amino acid
sequences of antibodies were first determined [35]. Various family-based approaches have been applied to the
prediction of functional residues, typically analyzing
sequence variability from collections of proteins with similar function (and therefore emphasizing the functional
importance of conserved residues). For example, "evolutionary trace" and related methods divide multiplyaligned sequences into subfamilies, typically by phylogeny, comparing patterns of conservation among evolutionarily-related subfamilies and often mapping onto 3D
structure [13,36-42]. Basically, these methods posit that
positions that are conserved in all sequences are important for structure, and positions that are conserved within
subfamilies (but vary among the sub-types) are important
for function (i.e., the function of the proteins in the
subfamily).
Here we show how analysis of sequence variability can be
enlarged to understand functional variability in whole families of proteins with similar structures. If one collects proteins with the same structure and diverse functions, then
structural positions will be conserved and functional positions will vary, and the degree of variation will be related
to the degree of variation among the ligands or substrates.
In the case of repeat motifs such as TPRs and ankyrins,
where structural elements are further divorced from functional conservation by ignoring how the motifs are
arranged in domains, the degree of variability is sometimes so profound that it alone can be used to predict the
binding site. When the ligands have commonalities, then
it becomes more difficult to predict the binding site from
variation alone. In that case, as with PDZ domains and
Zifs, variation in combination with an example structure
still reveals specificity-determining binding positions,
which is critical information for re-engineering specificity.
(The corollary to this argument is that the pattern of variation of known binding residues will suggest the pattern
of variation in the ligands.)
Analysis of overall variance among structurally-related
families provides complementary information to methods that analyze variance among evolutionarily-related

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/240

subfamilies, which have proven very powerful in recent
years. A major challenge for these evolutionary trace
methods is accurate functional sub-typing, particularly
when family members have diverged very significantly.
Our method avoids functional sub-typing and, rather,
benefits from increased functional divergence of family
members (since it results in increased variation among
functional positions). Further attention to variable residues in families overall therefore stands to improve exiting methods of functional prediction.
There are hundreds of binding scaffolds with sufficient
examples known to permit this type of statistical analysis.
The use of rigorous measures of how amino acid distributions differ improves significantly upon conservation
alone as a means of identifying important residues within
a protein family (this has been reviewed recently [23]).
The rapid identification of specificity-determining positions will be useful for the design of proteins with altered
binding specificity. The predictions of specificity-determining residues in Ank repeat proteins, Zifs and PDZ
domains agree strikingly well with results from considerable structural and biochemical work, and therefore provide a guide for re-engineering binding specificity by
design even for protein families lacking extensive characterization. Moreover, knowledge of the specificity-determining residues can be incorporated into evolutionary
trace methods to develop a comprehensive view of residues critical for function.

Methods
Sequences
Aligned sequences of TPRs, Ank repeats, C2H2 Zifs and
PDZ domains were downloaded from Pfam http://
pfam.wustl.edu[18]. TPRs of non-canonical length (i.e.,
not 34 amino acids) were discarded, and only canonical
positions were considered with Ank repeats, Zifs and PDZ
domains (i.e., ignoring low-occupancy positions from
insertions and deletions). All calculations were carried out
in Microsoft Excel 2003 on a Dell Latitude C640 with a
2.2 GHz Intel Mobile Pentium 4 processor. Factorials
were computed from the Stirling approximation.
Statistical Free Energies
The SFEs associated with each amino acid were determined from application of the Boltzmann law [1], where
k is the Boltzmann constant, kT* is an arbitrary energy
unit (since the "temperature" of the ensemble T* is not
necessarily related to T for conventional systems), and Pref
is the probability associated with a hypothetical site with
amino acid usage as in the reference state. The binomial
probability Px of the observation of nx sequences with
amino acid x was calculated from [3], where fx is the frequency of the amino acid in a reference state, all ORFs in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The SFEs associated with the

observed frequencies of the 20 amino acids at each site
can be thought of as elements of a 20-dimensional vector.
The scalar length of this vector, the root-mean-square
average for all amino acids [2], is therefore taken to be the
statistical free energy, ∆Gstat, that separates the observed
positional amino acid distribution from the reference
state. For comparison to Lockless & Ranganathan [14], the
∆Gstat values were arbitrarily divided by 100. However, the
Ranganathan group normalizes the number of sequences
to 100, and we have shown that ∆Gstat is proportional to
N for large N. Therefore, the ∆Gstat values we calculate are
10-fold larger than those calculated by the Ranganathan
method for the same amino acid distribution, since we
have normalized to N = 1000.

Other metrics of distribution difference
Multinomial probabilities [4], sequence (Shannon)
entropies [5] and relative entropies [6] were calculated as
described above. For sequence and relative entropy calculations, the frequencies were calculated as:

px =

nx + 1
N +1

[7]

so that ln px was always defined (and is valid as long as N
is large). The values used for fx are listed in our previous
paper [16].
