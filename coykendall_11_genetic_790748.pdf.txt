Genetic diversity and demographic instability in
Riftia pachyptila tubeworms from eastern Pacific
hydrothermal vents

Abstract
Background: Deep-sea hydrothermal vent animals occupy patchy and ephemeral habitats supported by
chemosynthetic primary production. Volcanic and tectonic activities controlling the turnover of these habitats
contribute to demographic instability that erodes genetic variation within and among colonies of these animals.
We examined DNA sequences from one mitochondrial and three nuclear gene loci to assess genetic diversity in
the siboglinid tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila, a widely distributed constituent of vents along the East Pacific Rise and
Galápagos Rift.
Results: Genetic differentiation (FST) among populations increased with geographical distances, as expected under
a linear stepping-stone model of dispersal. Low levels of DNA sequence diversity occurred at all four loci, allowing
us to exclude the hypothesis that an idiosyncratic selective sweep eliminated mitochondrial diversity alone. Total
gene diversity declined with tectonic spreading rates. The southernmost populations, which are subjected to
superfast spreading rates and high probabilities of extinction, are relatively homogenous genetically.
Conclusions: Compared to other vent species, DNA sequence diversity is extremely low in R. pachyptila. Though
its dispersal abilities appear to be effective, the low diversity, particularly in southern hemisphere populations, is
consistent with frequent local extinction and (re)colonization events.
Keywords: Annelida Polychaeta, Siboglinidae, vent, metapopulations

Background
Demographic instability influences the distribution of
genetic diversity within and among discrete colonies of
a widely distributed species [1,2]. Local extinction and
(re)colonization events are expected to reduce the overall effective size of a metapopulation thereby limiting its
capacity to retain genetic variation [3]. Furthermore,
genetic drift contributes significantly less to geographical
differentiation if the average persistence time of colonies
is less than the time it takes to fix neutral alleles [4].
The number of colonists, their sources (i.e. migrant vs.
propagule pools), and ongoing rates of gene flow all
affect the degree to which demographic instability
affects geographical differentiation [5-7]. Yet, these parameters are rarely known; instead they are commonly

inferred from statistical analyses of genealogical variation that is assumed to be selectively neutral [8]. For a
variety of practical reasons, recent studies have relied
mostly on information from mitochondrial DNA variation, although the assumption of selective neutrality has
been debated [9-11]. Independent genealogies involving
nuclear genes are needed to distinguish the effects of
idiosyncratic processes such as mitochondrial selective
sweeps from demographic processes that leave genomewide signatures [12,13].
The communities of marine animals that occupy deepsea hydrothermal vents provide unusual opportunities to
study dynamic metapopulation processes [14-16]. Vent
communities are supported by chemosynthetic bacteria
that oxidize volcanic gases (e.g., H2S and CH4) concentrated in the hydrothermal effluents. Adults of the iconic
tubeworm Riftia pachyptila (Polychaeta: Siboglinidae),
for example, are nourished entirely by sulfur-oxidizing

endosymbiotic bacteria, linking their lives to the tempo
of disturbances that create and destroy their habitats
(Figure 1A-B). Eastern Pacific vents (Figure 1C) that
host R. pachyptila are particularly ephemeral, persisting
for a few years to several decades before fluid conduits

are blocked, magma supplies shift, or lava flows extirpate local communities [17]. Earthquakes can open fluid
conduits, re-activating old vents, and magmatic eruptions spawn new vents [18]. Studies of vent community
succession [18] revealed that R. pachyptila is among the

first species to colonize a new vent once suitable conditions are established. Within two years its numbers can
grow to several thousand adult individuals, but changes
in vent flow, or overgrowth by mytilids can lead to its
replacement as the dominant species – a process that
can take months to years depending on the location.
The frequency of habitat turnover varies with tectonic
spreading rates [19]. Tectonic spreading at Eastern Pacific vents (Figure 1C) varies from moderate rates (65
mm/yr) along the Galápagos Rift (GAR) to fast rates
(85-116 mm/yr) along the northern East Pacific Rise
(NEPR) and superfast rates (142-158 mm/yr) along the
southern EPR (SEPR). Cycles of habitat disturbance
associated with these events are expected to favor
organisms with rapid individual growth rates, early
reproduction, and effective dispersal capabilities [20].
Active vents along the EPR and GAR are restricted to
axial grabens (rift valleys) that are expected to function
as dispersal corridors for the larvae of species like R.
pachyptila [21]. The distances between active vents vary
from a few kilometers along a ridge segment to 100s of
kilometers between contiguous segments (Figure 1C). A
one-dimensional stepping-stone model [22] provides a
reasonable starting hypothesis for connectivity among
linear habitats such as these, but population genetic studies provide limited support for this configuration,
partly due to under-sampling of populations and insufficiently polymorphic genetic markers [23]. However, R.
pachyptila was first among the few species that exhibited evidence for stepping-stone dispersal [24]. Estimates
of gene flow (Nm), inferred from pairwise FST’s for allozyme differentiation, declined with geographical distances among NEPR and GAR populations. Based on
larval durations and predominant currents along the
NEPR, R. pachyptila is expected to have mean larval dispersal distances of 100 to 200 km [17,21]. A subsequent
phylogeographic survey examined additional samples
from the SEPR axis, but found no evidence for steppingstone dispersal due to a near absence of sequence variation in mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase I, (COI) [25].
A number of co-distributed species of annelids and mollusks have been similarly examined, and they all exhibit
substantial COI variation [25-27]. Their mitochondrial
haplotype diversities range from a minimum of 0.331 in
R. pachyptila to a maximum of 0.960 in another annelid,
with a mean of 0.615 across 11 species [summarized in
Figure five of reference 15]. Examinations of nuclear
allozymes, AFLPs and DNA microsatellites from limited
portions of R. pachyptila’s range [24,28,29] suggests that
its low COI variation may be anomalous, resulting perhaps from a mitochondrial selective sweep. Nevertheless,
allozymes, AFLPs and microsatellites exhibit mutation
rates that do not compare to mitochondrial DNA
sequences, and they might experience different selective

constraints. A study including nuclear DNA sequences
with sufficient numbers of individuals sampled from R.
pachyptila’s known geographic range has yet to be
performed.
Testing selective sweep versus population bottleneck
hypotheses requires an examination of multiple independent genetic markers [13]. To that end, we examined
DNA sequences from three independent nuclear loci
and another mitochondrial locus, Cytochrome b (Cytb),
from R. pachyptila. Samples were collected from known
vents along the GAR, NEPR and SEPR axes (Figure 1C).
First, we tested the selective sweep hypothesis by assessing whether mitochondrial diversity within and among
populations is idiosyncratically low. Second, we examined whether population structure is consistent with a
linear stepping stone model, or if more complex models
of subdivision are justified. Finally, we assessed whether
demographic instability associated with tectonic spreading is correlated with reduced levels of genetic diversity.

Methods
Samples

Expeditions conducted between 1998 and 2005 explored
and sampled hydrothermal vents at 19 locations along
the NEPR, SEPR and GAR axes (Figure 1C). The samples examined in this study were obtained from nine
locations (Table 1). Worms were harvested with robotic
manipulators on the human occupied vehicle (HOV)
Alvin (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, WHOI)
or the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Tiburon (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, MBARI). Samples were placed in an insulated container with ambient
seawater. Upon recovery at the surface, whole worms

were stored in 2°C filtered seawater prior to tissue sampling. A small sample of vestimentum, a tissue that is
normally devoid of endosymbiotic bacteria, was frozen
at -70°C or preserved in 95% EtOH.
DNA purification, PCR conditions and DNA sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy
kit, following manufacturer’s protocols (Qiagen, Inc.
Valencia, CA). The primers, optimal annealing temperatures, and PCR conditions are available in Additional
file 1. We used two PCR programs: (i) initial denaturation temperature of 94°C for 10 min followed by 35
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1
min with a single final extension of 72°C for 7 min; and
(ii) initial denaturation temperature of 94°C for 10 min
followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 2 min, 48°C for 2 min,
72°C for 2.5 min, and final extension of 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products from all loci were purified by gel excision
and cleaned with Montage filter units (Millipore Corp.,
Billerica, MA) or diluted in 50 μl sterile water and purified with Multiscreen HTS PCR 96 vacuum manifold
system (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Unless noted
(Additional file 1), DNA sequencing employed the same
PCR primers. Purified PCR products were sequenced
bidirectionally on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer using
BigDye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc.,
Foster, CA). Protein-coding sequences were checked for
stop codons.
Mitochondrial sequences

PCR mixtures for Cytb included 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μM
of each primer, 200 μM of each dNTP, 1.25 units of Taq
polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster, CA), 1x
PCR buffer (supplied by manufacturer), and 1 μL of DNA
template in a final volume of 25 μL. Cytb sequences were
amplified with previously published primer pairs [30] and
PCR program-i (Additional file 1). The 377 bp amplified
portion of Cytb corresponds to positions 10732-11108 in
the R. pachyptila mitochondrial genome [GenBank acc.
no. AY741662, deposited by 31].
Single-copy nuclear (scn) DNAs

One of us (SAK) previously generated a series of anonymous scnDNA sequences from R. pachyptila (unpublished, GenBank acc. nos. U68732-U68750). We designed
primers from these sequences following Karl et al. [methodological details in 32]. Briefly, purified total DNA from
a single R. pachyptila individual from the GAR was
digested with the restriction enzyme Sau3a. Fragments
were sorted by size, cloned, and screened to determine
genomic copy number. To design primers, we sequenced
each end of the low copy clone-inserts. Nine cloneinserts were tested for their potential utility in population
screening. Seven inserts generated products that could

Page 4 of 11

not be used because they included length variation (large
indels) that confounded our scoring of individual genotypes, or they lacked sufficient polymorphism. The
Rpt46.1 primers amplified predictable products, but
internal primers were required for Rpt84.1 to improve its
sequence quality (Additional file 1). PCR program-i was
used for both loci. Amplification with the Rpt46.1 primers generated two products; the larger band was used
as template for sequencing. After preliminary sequencing,
many genotypes contained two polymorphic sites. To
resolve the ambiguous haplotypes, we cloned the PCR
products from heterozygous individuals using the standard manufacturer’s protocol (Topo TA cloning kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Nuclear intron

Of seven primer pairs developed by Jarman et al. [33],
only the ATPSa primers amplified a polymorphic product that could be scored in R. pachyptila. To improve
its reliability, we designed non-degenerate internal primers (Additional file 1). The intron amplified using the
same PCR recipe as above and PCR program-ii. Initial
screening of the 473 bp product from ten individuals
from nine populations revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (A/G) at position 319 of the amplicon.
Because the SNP could be recognized by the restriction
enzyme NspI, population screening was based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Ten μl of
the amplicons were suspended in a cocktail containing 1
× NE buffer-2, 10 μg/μl bovine serum albumen, 3 units
of NspI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and sterile
water to a final volume of 15 μl, and the mix was incubated at 37°C for 1.5-11 hours. Products were separated
on 3% agarose gels at room temperature for 1.5-3 hrs at
65-80 volts. Positive controls of known genotypes (from
prior sequencing) were included with RFLP digestions
and all gel analyses.
Statistical analyses

We used the program Phase v. 2.1 [34,35] to reconstruct
allelic haplotypes for nuclear loci using the cloned haplotypes from the double heterozygotes as a baseline. We
also used the software to estimate background recombination rates per gene segment. Recombination rates
were low enough to assume no effective recombination
within each segment. Tcs v. 1.21 [36] was used to construct statistical parsimony networks for each locus.
Arlequin 3.5 [37] was also used to estimate molecular
diversity, θS [38], from the number of segregating sites,
and Fu’s Fs [39], and to estimate gene diversity (H),
adjusted for sample size according to Eq. 8.4 of Nei
[40]. Allelic richness (a’) estimates were obtained by the
rarefaction methods implemented in Hp-rare v. 1.0 [41].
Estimates of F IS and tests for Hardy Weinberg

equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium (LD)
were conducted with Genepop v. 3.4 [42].
The multi-locus genotypic assignment method
employed in Structure v. 2.2 [43] was used to estimate
the probable number of discrete population clusters (K)
represented by the data. We assumed correlated allele
frequencies between population samples and admixed
ancestries of populations. Parameter estimates for correlated allele frequencies and admixture were estimated by
averaging values from preliminary simulations that varied K from 1 to 8. Simulations were repeated at least
five times for each value of K (number of data partitions) and for two disparate values of l (0.731, 2.204), a
shape distribution parameter for allele frequencies,
based on initial simulations. Assuming a uniform prior
on K, we estimated a Bayes factor for each value of K
after averaging the ln Pr(X/K) values between simulations. All simulations employed a burn-in value of 105
with 106 subsequent steps in the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling process.
To assess evidence for isolation-by distance (IBD) we
used Arlequin 3.5 to obtain pairwise estimates of FST,
and the GeoDistances procedure in Le Progiciel R [44]
to estimate great arc distances from geographical coordinates for the sample locations (Table 1). The Mantel
test module implemented in Arlequin 3.5 was used to
assess correlations between the genetic (A) and geographical (B) distance matrices. To assess possible affects
of subdivision, we generated an assignment matrix (C)
with values that equaled zero (0) if populations belonged
to a cluster identified by Structure and one (1) if populations belonged to different clusters. The partial correlation (r AB|C ) of A and B after accounting for C was
obtained according to the methods of Smouse et al. [45]
as implemented in Arlequin 3.5.
The FST-outlier method [46] implemented in the program Lositan [47] was used to test for evidence of selection. The program uses empirical estimates of genic
heterozygosity to simulate neutral expectations for FST
under an island model of migration. An iterative bisection
algorithm is used to simulate data with a mean FST that
matches the empirical data, even when the data do not
strictly adhere to island model assumptions [i.e. FST ≈ 1/
(4Nm + 1)] for neutral genes [47]. Initial simulations were
conducted with 10,000 replications, assuming an infinite
allele mutation model. We then conducted simulations
with 40,000 replications and used the neutral mean for FST
to estimate its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Empirical
values were compared to this distribution and those significantly above or below the 95% CIs might be influenced by
selection. We attempted to use the program Sweep_Bott
[13] to distinguish population bottlenecks from a selective
sweeps, but the simple star phylogenies obtained for the
present genes prevented its execution.

Geographical and geophysical methods

Seafloor spreading rates (Figure 1C) were estimated by
the NUVEL-1A model implemented in the web-based
calculator <http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~menke/
plates2.html>. This kinematic plate-motion model uses
tables of Euler vectors previously estimated from geomagnetic reversals [48]. Space-based geodetic methods
were used to improve accuracy of the model [49]. The
NUVEL-1A estimates of spreading rates are highly correlated (r = 0.982) with empirical measurements based
on near-bottom surveys and space geodesy methods
[50].

Results
Distribution and abundance

We explored 19 active vent fields between 27°N and 38°
S latitude and obtained adequate samples of R. pachyptila from eight localities (Figure 1C, blue and red dots).
Robust populations were observed and sampled from
the NEPR localities. Northern SEPR localities S7, S11
and S17 also host robust R. pachyptila populations, but
only one specimen was observed and sampled from S23
on the NW flank of the Easter Microplate. Nine worms
were observed and sampled from S32 during four dives
in 1999, and none were found when we returned there
in 2005. We conducted five submersible dives at S38
and found a single individual living deeply within a
recess on the vertical wall of an active chimney, but it
could not be sampled before deteriorating weather conditions forced us to abandon this location.
Polymorphism

Twenty-five alleles were identified across four polymorphic loci (Additional file 2). Sequences associated
with these alleles were deposited with GenBank (acc.
Nos. HQ405793-6724). For each locus, parsimony analyses produced very simple star-like genealogies with
mostly one-step mutational differences from a primary
(most frequent) allele (Figure 1D and 1F). Widely distributed secondary (less frequent) alleles occurred at
three loci. The assignments of haplotype phases in double heterozygotes were resolved with 97% probability for
Rpt46.1 (5 individuals) and 89-96% probability for
Rpt84.1 (6 individuals) depending on the sample location. Haplotypes inferred with the program Phase were
used in all subsequent analyses. Sequence diversity was
very low in the samples for all four loci, with π values
ranging from 0 to 0.006 and θS values ranging from 0 to
0.004 (population values not reported).
Genotypic frequencies at the nuclear loci revealed no
evidence for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (FIS, Table 2). Multi-locus tests obtained by summing P-values for each locus (Fisher’s method) provided
no indication of significant heterozygote deficiencies

within population samples (8 tests, Prange: 0.169-1.000).
Furthermore, the grand total of these values obtained by
summing across all loci and samples was not significant
(P = 0.320). Tests for linkage disequilibrium between
pairs of polymorphic nuclear loci provided no evidence
for associations within populations (16 tests, P range :
0.085-1.000). Furthermore no associations existed when
P-values from the pairwise comparisons were summed
across populations (3 tests, Prange : 0.484-0.971). Similarly, tests for cytonuclear disequilibrium involving Cytb
and the three nuclear genes were non-significant within
populations (13 tests, Prange: 0.158-1.000) and globally
across populations (3 tests, Prange: 0.370-0.931).
Test of selection

Because overall differentiation, as estimated by FST, varied among the four loci (0.163 for Rpt46.1; 0.188 for
Rpt84.1; 0.269 for ATPSa; and 0.551 for Cytb), we used
Lositan to test for evidence of natural selection. First,
we determined the neutral expectation, FST(nuc) = 0.138,
for the nuclear loci alone. Though all the observed FST
(nuc) values were higher than the neutral mean, none fell
outside of the 95% CIs. Assuming an even sex ratio and
strictly maternal cytoplasmic inheritance, the neutral
expectation for a mitochondrial gene is FST(mt) = 4FST

(nuc)/(1 + 3FST(nuc)) [51,52]. The FST(mt) = 0.551 for Cytb
was only slightly greater than its neutral expectation
(0.533); thus, no evidence existed for directional or balancing selection having shaped geographical differentiation for these genetic markers.

Geographical structure

We used Structure to estimate the number of population clusters (K) represented among 192 multilocus genotypes. For each combination of priors, K = 2 provided
the greatest mean value for ln Pr(X|K). Bayes factors
were 0.368 for K = 2 and zero for K = 1 and K = 3. We
estimated Q, the probability of assignment of genotypes
to the northern cluster (NEPR/GAR), and represented
the mean of Q for each sample in Figure 1E. The means
exhibited a clinal pattern between N27 and GAR, and
are effectively homogeneous along the SEPR axis. A single individual sampled from S23 clustered with its
neighboring samples. Hierarchical AMOVA of the eight
population samples partitioned 18.8% of gene diversity
between the northern and southern clusters, 9.3% within
clusters, and 71.9% within samples.
Evidence also existed for isolation-by-distance, IBD
(Figure 2). Pairwise F ST ’s (Table 3) increased significantly with geographical distances (Mantel’s r = 0.709,

(Table 3) were set to zero prior to adjustment. Black dots denote

P = 0.003); however, the comparisons between northern
and southern clusters greatly influenced this relationship
(black dots in Figure 2). An IBD relationship remained
after exclusion of SEPR samples from the analysis (r =
0.896, P = 0.167), but the correlation was not significant.
To better assess how associations with the northern and
southern clusters (C) affected the relationship between
FST (A) and distance (B), we estimated the partial correlation of A on B after accounting for C. A marginally
significant relationship remained (r AB|C = 0.396, P =
0.069). It should be noted that the trans-Equatorial FST
between N9 and S7 (0.045) is smaller than the F ST ’s
between adjacent pairs of NEPR populations (range:
0.064-0.093). This trans-Equatorial FST also is smaller
than FST’s between other population pairs that are about
~2000 km apart (N27 vs. N9; N9 vs. GAR; S7 vs. GAR)
(Table 3).
Environmental correlates of gene diversity

Heterozygosity declined strongly with tectonic spreading
rate (Figure 3, r = -0.888), whether or not the off-axis
GAR sample was included in the analysis (Table 4).

Figure 3 Correlation of expected heterozygosity with tectonic
spreading rates (R2 = 0.788, P = 0.0032). Allelic richness exhibits
essentially the same relationship (R2 = 0.730, P = 0.0069). Black
squares are NEPR populations, white squares are SEPR samples and
the white circle is the GAR population.

Spreading rates are negatively correlated with latitude (r
= -0.78) and the relationship is stronger with removal of
the off-axis GAR sample (r = -0.98). Depth is relatively
monotonous along the EPR axis and uncorrelated with
the gene diversity indices. These correlations are clearly
reflected in differences in the gene diversities between
northern (NEPR/GAR) and southern (SEPR) populations, treated individually or as population clusters
(Tables 2 and 5).
Demographic tests were initially conducted separately
for each locus at each locality, but limited polymorphism
in each sample provided essentially no power to reject
null hypotheses. Subsequent tests were conducted for the
northern and southern population clusters (Table 5). Five
out of six values for Fu’s Fs were negative, though only
one was statistically significant. Mismatch distributions
were all unimodal, suggesting an expanding population
size, but the tests of demographic stability had very limited power due to low polymorphism.

Discussion
Riftia pachyptila exhibits the lowest mitochondrial COI
diversity observed to date among 14 species of invertebrates sampled from eastern Pacific hydrothermal vents
[reviewed in 15]. Yet, the present data were not consistent with the hypothesis that a selective sweep eliminated mitochondrial diversity alone. Levels of sequence
diversity were similarly low for three nuclear genes and
another mitochondrial gene, Cytb. The shallow star-like
haplotype networks exhibited by all four loci suggest
that demographic factors affecting the entire genome
were responsible for the reduced variation. Gene diversity indices (H and a’) for eight population samples were

inversely correlated with tectonic spreading rates (Figure
3), which can be taken as surrogates for rates of habitat
turnover. The lowest gene diversities occurred at southern (SEPR) localities, which are subjected to superfast
spreading rates of 142-156 mm/yr. Active vents are closely spaced along the southern SEPR axis (S14-S23), but
R. pachyptila colonies were spotty there and individuals
were scarce. In contrast, higher gene diversities occurred
among the northern (NEPR/GAR) localities, where
spreading rates are slower, 65-116 mm/yr. Active vents
are more distantly spaced along the NEPR axis, but
dense R. pachyptila colonies occupied nearly all the
active vents that we have explored along the NEPR during the past 22 years. These observations are consistent
with evidence from other vent species that gene diversity is correlated with vent “occupancy” [14,15]. Species
that occupy most of the active vent habitats in a region
have high gene diversities compared to species with
spottier distributions. Here we have found the same
relationship within a species. Northern R. pachyptila
have higher vent occupancy and gene diversity, whereas
southern populations have low occupancy and low
diversity. Frequent cycles of extinction and (re)colonization relative to time it takes to fix new mutations are
expected to produce spotty distributions and correspondingly low gene diversity [4]. Apparently, high rates

of population turnover along the southern SEPR axis
has led to rapid coalescence on a small number of founders, but the origin of these founders remains a mystery.
Population structure

Overall, differentiation among R. pachyptila populations
meets expectations for a linear stepping-stone model.
Pairwise estimates of differentiation, F ST /(1 - F ST ),
increased with geographical distances among the vent
localities (Figure 2), particularly among the NEPR/GAR
populations as previously reported for allozymes [24].
Large distances (≥2000 km) between the northern
(NEPR/GAR) and southern (SEPR) population clusters
greatly influenced the overall pattern, however. Hierarchical AMOVA attributed 18.8% of total gene diversity
to differences between the northern and southern clusters, but this evidence for subdivision may be an artifact
of sampling gaps between the two regions. Computer
simulations have revealed that sampling gaps in a linear
stepping-stone model can generate inflated pairwise
FST’s that may lead to incorrect inferences about population subdivision [23]. Here, the trans-equatorial FST =
0.045 between N9 and S7 (1957 km apart, Table 3) is
smaller than the FST = 0.271 between the N9 and N27
along the NEPR (2050 km apart), or between N9 and
GAR (2234 km apart). Even the F ST ’s between closer
pairs of NEPR samples (N27-N21 and N21-N9) were
greater than the trans-equatorial pair. Estimates of pairwise migration rates (Nm) between adjacent EPR samples were similar, ranging from 2.0 to 5.3 after
excluding the three southern SEPR samples for which
FST ≈ 0. Nonetheless, the existence of regional alleles
(blue and red in Figure 1D) suggests that dispersal
across the Equator might not have achieved equilibrium
with genetic drift (discussed below).
The NEPR, SEPR and GAR axes meet at the Galápagos
Triple Junction (Figure 1C), which plunges to 5400 m in
the 50-km wide Hess Deep. Active vents are not known
from the Hess Deep proper, but video surveys of the adjacent Hess Deep Rift Valley have identified vents that host
R. pachyptila, though they were not sampled (T. Shank

Coykendall et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:96

2009, pers. comm.). Further exploration of the equatorial
region is warranted because we do not know why it creates a variable dispersal filter for several vent taxa
[reviewed in 15]. Hurtado et al. [25] first noted that several
annelid species exhibit variable impedance to dispersal
across the Equator, and Plouviez et al. [26] reported that
one or more historical vicariance events might have separated NEPR and SEPR populations. The palm worm, Alvinella pompejana, and limpets of the Lepetodrilus elevatus
species complex exhibit evidence for isolation across the
Equator, but the elevated ST’s reported by Plouviez et al.
for other species may not be greater than expected from
the sampling gaps between these axes [23]. Variable impedance across such regions results from interactions
between taxon-specific dispersal modes and physical factors [15]. For example, strong deep-ocean currents sweep
eastward across the EPR axis near the Equator [53]. The
removal of dispersing larvae from axial troughs by these
currents and the apparent scarcity of vent habitats may
together impede the dispersal of some species.
Non-equilibrium processes

Inferences about isolation-by-distance or stepping-stone
models assume the constituent populations have achieved
equilibrium between gene flow and genetic drift, but nonequilibrium scenarios can generate similar patterns of population structure [54]. If the Equatorial region is a contact
zone between partially isolated NEPR and SEPR populations,
this too could produce differentiation that resembles the
product of stepping-stone dispersal, but this hypothesis fails
to explain the low gene diversity in SEPR populations of R.
pachyptila (discussed below). Magma supplies and associated tectonic and hydrothermal activities shift along ridge
axes; thus, populations may be variably interconnected and
disconnected by such shifts [17,55]. Numerous closely
spaced vents occur between 14°and 21°S latitude (diamonds
in Figure 1C), and they are very young as evidenced by
recent lava flows [56,57]. Many of these vents host colonies
of polychaetes, gastropods and bivalve mollusks [26,58,59],
but R. pachyptila was rare during the expeditions we
mounted between 1999 and 2005 to vents between 14°and
21°S along the SEPR. Genetic homogeneity among SEPR
samples spanning 2673 km suggests that genetic drift contributes very little to differentiation among these colonies, as
expected if their average persistence time is shorter than the
time it takes to fix neutral alleles [4]. These ephemeral vents
may offer no more than a demographic sink for R. pachyptila. Perhaps this region has been repeatedly colonized from
more stable R. pachyptila sources that remain undiscovered.
We searched for this species as far as 38°S latitude along a
contiguous extension of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR,
Figure 1C). This latitude near the “roaring 40’s” is the farthest south anyone has conducted operations with a human

Page 9 of 11

occupied research submersible. During five dives, we
observed only a single R. pachyptila individual that could
not be sampled before foul weather drove us from the location. If stable source populations exist elsewhere in this
southern region, they would be expected to seed ephemeral
SEPR vents with genetically diverse propagules, reversing
the observed cline in genic diversity. Alternatively, the existence of many small (and genetically homogeneous) source
populations seems unlikely given the high probability of
local extinctions. Although R. pachyptila might exist elsewhere along the Pacific Antarctic Ridge, the present genetic
evidence is consistent with colonization of the SEPR from
the NEPR or GAR axes.

Conclusion
Other studies of mitochondrial variation in vent species
have reported star-like genealogies that suggest recent
range expansions or demographic instability [reviewed
in [15]]. Yet, the nuclear and mitochondrial gene networks from R. pachyptila are simpler and shallower
than those found in all other vent annelids and mollusks
examined to date [e.g., [25,26,60-63]]. Estimates of
nucleotide diversity (π) for mitochondrial COI
sequences are smaller by an order of magnitude than
the nearest estimates from the other vent taxa. Comparable estimates do not exist for the present nuclear markers, but the π values were of the same order of
magnitude as mitochondrial Cytb (Table 5). Although
our attempts to examine indicators of demographic
expansion with mismatch distributions were frustrated
by the limited polymorphism, the overall lack of nuclear
and mitochondrial variation itself suggests that R.
pachyptila may be extraordinarily prone to population
turnover that leads to rapid coalescence. High rates of
local extinction coupled with relatively high rates of dispersal (colonization) from a limited number of source
populations (i.e. propagule pool) are expected to produce the observed pattern of reduced diversity within
and among disjunct colonies of a metapopulation [6,7].
Which demographic factors have helped to retain
genetic diversity in the co-distributed vent species, however, remain mysteries.
