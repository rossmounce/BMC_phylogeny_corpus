pathways using the Candida Gene Order Browser

Abstract
Background: Candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide. Recent
sequencing efforts have provided a wealth of Candida genomic data. We have developed the Candida Gene Order
Browser (CGOB), an online tool that aids comparative syntenic analyses of Candida species. CGOB incorporates all
available Candida clade genome sequences including two Candida albicans isolates (SC5314 and WO-1) and 8 closely
related species (Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Lodderomyces elongisporus, Debaryomyces
hansenii, Pichia stipitis, Candida guilliermondii and Candida lusitaniae). Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also included as a
reference genome.
Results: CGOB assignments of homology were manually curated based on sequence similarity and synteny. In total
CGOB includes 65617 genes arranged into 13625 homology columns. We have also generated improved Candida gene
sets by merging/removing partial genes in each genome. Interrogation of CGOB revealed that the majority of
tandemly duplicated genes are under strong purifying selection in all Candida species. We identified clusters of
adjacent genes involved in the same metabolic pathways (such as catabolism of biotin, galactose and N-acetyl
glucosamine) and we showed that some clusters are species or lineage-specific. We also identified one example of
intron gain in C. albicans.
Conclusions: Our analysis provides an important resource that is now available for the Candida community. CGOB is
available at http://cgob.ucd.ie.
Background
Fungal infections are the fourth most common nosocomial bloodstream infection in the United States. Candida
species account for approximately 10% of all bloodstream
infections [1] and worldwide are the most common cause
of opportunistic fungal infection [2]. Due to their increasing clinical importance, recent sequencing projects have
determined the complete sequence of ten Candida
genomes, including common pathogenic species and species rarely, if ever, associated with disease [3-7].
The term Candida was originally assigned to imperfect
yeast species, with no known sexual cycle. This term now
covers a variety of species of diverse origins (both sexual
and asexual), and provides little information regarding

evolutionary relationships. For example, Candida
glabrata is more closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae than it is to Candida albicans. Debaryomyces hansenii and Pichia stipitis are close relatives of Candida
species [8]. Some species, such as C. lusitaniae, were
assigned two names, one (Candida lusitaniae) referring
to the asexual (anamorph) form, and one (Clavispora lusitaniae) to the sexual (teleomorph) form. Similarly, Candida guilliermondii is also known as Pichia
guilliermondii, and Candida famata as D. hansenii. These
species share a relatively recent common ancestor (Figure
1), and in all cases the codon CUG is translated as serine
rather than leucine [9]. For brevity, we refer to the above
as Candida species that belong to the CTG clade [5,8,10].
Previous comparative analysis of eight Candida
genomes led to the identification of gene families that are
highly represented in strongly pathogenic species (such
as C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis), compared to
weak pathogens such as C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii, and very rare or non-pathogenic species such as D.

hansenii [5]. These include three cell wall families; the
ALS-like adhesins, which in C. albicans have been associated with virulence, biofilm development and acquisition
of iron from the host [11-13]; the Pga30-like family [14],
and the Hyr/Iff family [15]. Many families are highly
enriched for gene duplications [5].
There are currently two major browsers that display
Candida genomes, CandidaDB, which contains information for several Candida genomes, and the Candida
Genome Database, which predominantly describes C.
albicans [16,17]. The major disadvantage of these browsers is that it is difficult to compare genomes to each other.
They also display a to-scale representation of a chromosomal region, which is unsuitable for analysis of gene
order and evolution. To overcome these problems we
developed the Candida Gene Order Browser (CGOB
[18]).
CGOB incorporates all available genome sequences
from Candida species, including two isolates of C. albicans (SC5314 and WO-1), its close relative and minor
pathogen C. dubliniensis, the major pathogens C. tropi-

calis and C. parapsilosis, the minor pathogens L. elongisporus, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii, the marine
yeast D. hansenii, and P. stipitis, a xylose-digesting yeast
that is associated with beetles found in wood [3-7].
CGOB is based on the engine developed for the Yeast
Gene Order Browser (YGOB) [19,20], which has been
applied to the analysis of genome duplication in the Saccharomyces group. To construct CGOB, all assignments
of homology were manually curated, based on sequence
similarity and gene order (synteny). Partial genes in each
genome were identified and removed, leading to the generation of improved gene sets. CGOB was then used to
analyze gene duplication, intron localization and clustering of genes involved in metabolic pathways. We found
that the majority of tandemly duplicated genes are under
strong purifying selection and that there are both conserved and species-specific clusters of metabolically
related genes in Candida. CGOB is available at http://
cgob.ucd.ie.

Results and discussion
CGOB structure and Candida genome editing

Version 1 of CGOB includes ten Candida genomes
obtained from a variety of sequencing centers (Table 1),
together with the genome from S. cerevisiae. CGOB's
visual display consists of horizontal tracks representing
chromosomal segments and pillars (Figure 2). Pillars are
the core data structures used to store list of homologies
across all species represented in the gene order browser
[20]. Pillars contain vacant slots when homologous genes
cannot be found in a particular genome. Genes were initially added to pillars based on automated assignments
derived from best bidirectional BLASTP searches. The
CGOB pillar dataset was manually refined by examining
regions of dubious synteny and singleton genes. A combination of BLASTP scores, synteny and phylogenetic data
were used to confirm assignments to pillars.

relevant sequencing centers. The "b" button performs a BLASTP search against CGOB's sequence database. The "S" button displays all the protein sequences in a vertical pillar. The "+" button outputs CGOB pillar data in a tabulated format. The "T" button reconstructs phylogenies on the fly. The "i"
button retrieves functional data for C. albicans SC5314 and S. cerevisiae via the Candida Genome Database and the Saccharomyces genome database
respectively. Non-syntenic genes are colored in grey. Genes lying in close proximity are joined by connectors: a solid bar for adjacent genes, two narrow bars connect genes up to 5 genes apart (not shown) and one narrow bar connects genes up to 20 genes apart (not shown). Inversions are denoted by orange connectors.

Similar to YGOB, CGOB allows the user to focus the
screen display on a gene of interest and to view phylogenetic trees, sequences and BLASTP results (Figure 2).
Hyperlinks to functional data can also be accessed for C.
albicans SC5314 and S. cerevisiae via the Candida
Genome Database [17] and the Saccharomyces Genome
Database [21] respectively.
During manual editing of CGOB we observed that the
original genome annotations contained a substantial
number of apparently partial open reading frames, which
we merged into full-length gene models. For example,
LELG_01495 and LELG_1496 in L. elongisporus are both
similar to parts of C. albicans orf19.6045 (PSD1). Closer
inspection showed that LELG_1496 aligned with the Nterminus of orf19.6045 whereas LELG_1496 matches the
C-terminus (Additional file 1). In cases like this we
deleted the partial open reading frames from CGOB's
homology pillars and inserted a new "merged" gene
model. Overall, we identified 709 ORFs in 8 genomes that

were subsequently merged into 335 full-length genes
(Additional file 2). The L. elongisporus genome contained
the highest number of partial ORFs (173 in total), while
the highly curated genomes of C. albicans SC5314 and C.
dubliniensis contain none (Table 1). The corrected gene
sets are available for download from CGOB [18].
Tandem Gene Duplications

Tandem gene duplication is one mechanism by which
species acquire new genes, and by extrapolation, new
functions. We therefore used both similarity and synteny
measurements in CGOB to identify gene duplications in
all Candida genomes. We identified and numbered all
tandem clusters in each genome (Additional file 3). For
some rapidly evolving genes, sequence similarity is not
high enough to identify family members. For example,
our initial BLAST based approach suggested that
orf19.2508 (PRM9) and orf19.2509 in C. albicans are tandem duplicates (cluster 30, Additional file 3). Their

orthologs in C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis
and L. elongisporus are found adjacent to one another.
However, these genes were not initially identified as tandem duplicates in the other species because they do not
have a BLASTP E-value below our initial cut-off (See
Methods). Therefore, slower evolving tandem duplicates
in one Candida species (C. albicans SC5314 in this example) can be used to locate rapidly evolving tandems (or
tandems with low sequence complexity) in other Candida genomes.
Tandem duplicates that subsequently underwent chromosomal rearrangement are difficult to identify. However, the ancestral arrangement can be inferred from an
analysis of homologous genes in CGOB. For example, in
C. albicans SC5314, the duplicate genes orf19.7362
(SKN1) and orf19.7363 (KRE6) are located beside one
another on chromosome 3 (Figure 2, Additional file 3
(cluster 32)). Their orthologs in C. albicans WO-1, C.
dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, L. elongisporus
and D. hansenii are also adjacent (Figure 2). However in P.
stipitis, SKN1 (PICST_63619) is located on chromosome
7 while KRE6 (PICST_75745) is located on chromosome
2 (Figure 2). The most parsimonious explanation is that a
duplication of SKN1 or KRE6 occurred in an ancestor of
all the Candida species, and this has been conserved in
most. However, relocation of SKN1 has occurred exclusively in P. stipitis (Figure 2).
In total 901 tandem clusters were identified across all
the Candida genomes (Table 2, Additional file 3). C. lusitaniae has the smallest number of tandem clusters (44)
whereas C. parapsilosis has the highest number (139).
This is noticeably high, as the closest relative of C. parapsilosis, L. elongisporus (Figure 1), contains only 93 tandem
clusters (Table 2). The average number of genes per tandem cluster in all Candida species ranges is slightly
greater than 2 (Table 2).

We used CGOB to map species and lineage-specific
tandem duplications (Figure 1). For example, since they
last shared a common ancestor, C. albicans has undergone at least 21 species-specific tandem duplications
gaining 24 paralogs, while its close relative C. dubliniensis
has undergone a single tandem duplication (Cd36_11890,
Cd36_11900) gaining 1 additional gene (Additional file 3,
cluster 463). Similarly, C. parapsilosis has undergone 63
species-specific tandem duplications gaining 78 paralogs
since diverging from its closest relative, L. elongisporus,
which has undergone 33 tandem duplication gaining 41
paralogs in the same time (Additional file 3).
Cluster 22 (Additional file 3) illustrates an ancient
duplication, resulting in a family of peroxisomal acylCoA thioesterases that are present in 3-5 tandem copies
in all the Candida species. The cluster is particularly
large in the branch containing C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and L. elongisporus,
where 5 family members are immediately adjacent to
each other. The single homolog in S. cerevisiae is likely to
be involved in fatty acid oxidation [22]. There is significant up-regulation of fatty acid Î²-oxidation when C. albicans cells are engulfed by macrophages [23], although
this pathway does not appear to be essential for virulence
[24]. Many of the other tandem duplication clusters
include members of larger gene families, such as lipases
(cluster 10, Additional file 3), glucose transporters (cluster 15,61, Additional file 3) and ferric reductases (cluster
57, Additional file 3). Some clusters are lineage specific,
such as the triplication of the pirin-domain genes PRN2,
PRN3 and PRN4 (cluster 6, Additional file 3) in C. albicans, C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis. The function of
these genes in unknown, but they are likely to localize to
the nucleus. There is an amplification of the FRP6 family
in D. hansenii and P. stipitis; the S. cerevisiae orthologs
are required for export of ammonia [25] (cluster 497,
Additional file 3). Other clusters are species-specific,

such as the five adjacent 2' hydroxyisoflavone reductases
(CIP1) described by Jeffries and Van Vleet [26], which our
analysis confirms is unique to P. stipitis (cluster 228).
Most of the other species have a single copy, except for C.
parapsilosis, which has two. L. elongisporus contains 5
tandem repeats of a large family with up to 13 members
in this species, which is absent from all the other Candida genomes (cluster 280, Additional file 3). The function of this family is unclear but all members contain a
Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinase (PIPKc) domain.
We also determined whether tandem duplicates in individual Candida species are undergoing positive selection.
Recent genome wide studies have shown that positive
selection after tandem duplication can give rise to novel
gene functions [27], that may help pathogens evade the
human immune response [28]. At the DNA level, positive
selection may be detected by comparing the rate of amino
acid altering (nonsynonymous) nucleotide substitutions
with the rate of synonymous substitution (dN/dS). A dN/dS
ratio > 1 is indicative of positive selection. The average
dN/dS ratio for all tandem clusters was found to be 0.27
(not shown). Of the 901 Candida clusters examined, only
12 displayed a dN/dS ratio > 1 (Additional file 3). Five of
these are species-specific and have no homologs in any
other Candida species (or any species in GenBank). The
remaining 7 clusters under the influence of positive selection do not share homology with gene families (cell wall,
hyphal, pseudohyphal, filamentous growth and biofilm
functions) normally associated with pathogenicity in
Candida [5]. In P. stipitis, one cluster encodes putative
ubiquitin protein ligases, one encodes zinc finger-containing proteins, and one encodes potential siderophore

transporters (Additional file 3). In D. hansenii, one cluster
encodes orthologs of TFS1, whose expression is induced
during filamentation in C. albicans [29]. Overall our
results suggest that the majority of Candida tandem
duplicates are under the influence of strong purifying
selection, presumably to conserve gene function.
We have extended an earlier analysis of duplicate genes
in Candida genomes, which considered only members of
multigene families [5]. We also identified some clusters
by manual inspection. For example, we first identified 85
tandem clusters in C. albicans SC5314 using a simple
BLAST approach, and this was increased to 106 using
synteny information, whereas only 24 were reported in
Butler et al [5]. In some species (such as L.elongisporus
and C. guilliermondii) we identified a smaller number of
clusters than Butler et al [5], partly because we removed
partial ORFs from the gene sets.
The Candida Paranome

Using our reannotated Candida genomes we determined
the number of multigene families (the paranome [30]) for
each Candida species. C. tropicalis has the highest number (557), whereas C. lusitaniae (390) has the lowest
(Table 3). In contrast, C. parapsilosis has the lowest number (4377) of genes that do not belong to families,
whereas C. lusitaniae (4871) has the highest (Table 3).
The average number of genes per multigene family is
approximately 3 for all species, although all Candida species have larger gene families (Table 3).
The largest gene family shared by all species contains a
transporter (DIP5) annotated as a putative dicarboxylic
amino acid permease in CGD. This family was previously
suggested as a potential antifungal target, as there are no

homologs in humans [31]. All Candida species have at
least 20 members of this family (not shown). The MEP
family, encoding three ammonium permeases in C. albicans SC5314, has also suggested as an antifungal drug
target [31]. Three MEP genes are present in all Candida
species except for L. elongisporus, which is missing the
ortholog of one (orf19.4446, not shown). Drugs directed
against these families should therefore be of broad specificity and target all Candida species, and are likely to have
no undesired interactions with the human patient.
Approximately 20-25% of all Candida genes in CGOB
belong to a multigene family (Table 3), similar to what has
previously been reported for C. albicans SC5314 [31].
This figure is lower than what has been observed for S.
cerevisiae (~30%), which is unsurprising as S. cerevisiae
has undergone a whole genome duplication [32] while
Candida species have not [33].
Intron loss in Candida genes

Yeast genomes from the Saccharomycotina are known to
be intron poor; introns are found in fewer than 5% of
genes from most species [34]. The exact mechanisms of
intron loss are not fully elucidated, but it is likely to occur
via recombination of a chromosomal copy with a reverse
transcript [35,36]. Introns have been predicted with some
accuracy in only three of the sequenced Candida
genomes - C. albicans, C. dubliniensis and D. hansenii.
We therefore restricted our analysis to these species.
Where we observed differences in intron locations in tandem duplicates in any one species, the corresponding
genomic sequence of the other two was manually
inspected to confirm intron presence or absence.
C. albicans SC5314 has at least 381 genes containing
415 introns [37]. Of these genes, 79 (~21%) belong to a
multigene family, and five are located in tandem clusters.
Cluster 5 contains three paralogs in C. albicans
(orf19.5194.1, orf19.6837 (FMA1), and orf19.6838) (Additional file 3 and Figure 3A). The first two of these genes
contain introns, as do their orthologs in C. dubliniensis.
There is a single homolog in D. hansenii, which has
undergone an inversion relative to C. albicans, but still
contains an intron. However, the third gene (orf19.6838)
does not contain an intron in any of the species (Figure
3A). The most likely hypotheses are that either the progenitor copy contained an intron and was duplicated
twice, followed by intron loss in one copy, or that the progenitor was first duplicated to generate a second introncontaining copy, and then duplicated again in an RNAmediated event.
Cluster 144 (Additional file 3) contains members of a
family of glutathione-S-transferases that are present in
two adjacent copies in some species and three in others
(Figure 3B). Two genes in C. albicans, C. dubliniensis and
D. hansenii have introns, suggesting that they arose

Cluster 61

Figure 3 Gene order around tandem clusters 5, 144 and 61 (A, B,
C respectively). The diagram is re-drawn from CGOB with some species omitted for clarity. Homologs are organized in pillars. Intron containing genes are indicated with a tail. A) Cluster 5. D. hansenii does not
contain an ortholog of FMA1. B) Cluster 144 is represented by a broken
red line. GTT1 (orf19.6998) and Cd36_85600 from C. albicans and C.
dubliniensis are not part of this cluster, and are located elsewhere in the
genome. Diagonal lines indicate a gap of 2 and 4 genes in C. albicans
and C. dubliniensis respectively. C) Cluster 61. Diagonal lines indicate a

through tandem duplication (Figure 3B). However, a third
member of the family (GTT1) which lies within the cluster in C. parapsilosis, L. elongisporus and C. guilliermondii does not contain any introns in C. albicans or C.
dubliniensis (there is no ortholog in D. hansenii). GTT1
may therefore have arisen via an RNA intermediate in an
ancestral Candida species.
We also found evidence for a species-specific intron
gain in a tandem duplicate. Cluster 61 (Additional file 3)
contains two adjacent genes (HGT12 and HGT13) in C.
albicans, C. dubliniensis and P. stipitis that belong to a
large family of sugar transporters that have at least 20
members in Candida species [38] (Figure 3C). The
HGT13 homolog is not adjacent to HGT12 in the other
species (not shown). In C. albicans, HGT13 contains an
intron, whereas its paralog HGT12 does not. The HGT13
intron lies within the coding sequence, which makes it
easy to identify (Figure 3D). Interestingly, although this
intron is present in HGT13 from both C. albicans isolates, it is absent from all of the homologs in the other
species, whether syntenic or not (Figure 3C). Intron gain
is very rare [36,39], but it appears more likely that HGT13
in C. albicans gained an intron, rather than the intron was
independently lost from all the other species. At least one
other member of the HGT family (HGT9) also contains
introns in C. albicans, but these appear to be conserved
in C. dubliniensis only.

Superscript numerals in parenthesis refer to the numbers of genes that are either paralogs D or tandem duplicates T.

Other gene families that are not tandemly arranged are
also likely to have arisen through both DNA-based gene
duplication and via an RNA intermediate, possibly
including retrotransposition. For example in C. albicans,
the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell wall gene
ECM33 [40] has two paralogs orf19.4955 and orf19.4255
(ECM331) that are not adjacent to each other (not
shown). ECM33 and orf19.4955 both contain an intron,
as do their orthologs in C. dubliniensis and D. hansenii.
ECM331 does not contain an intron in any of the three
species. This suggests that ECM33 and orf19.4955 may
have arisen through duplication, and ECM331 is the
result of reverse transcription of one of the intron-containing paralogs, in an ancestor of the three species.
Clustering of adjacent genes in metabolic pathways

In bacteria the primary method of controlling gene
expression is the organization of genes into operons,

which are transcribed into a single mRNA. Bacterial
operons often contain genes from the same metabolic
pathway. Operons are not usually found in eukaryotes,
with the notable exception of nematodes [41-43]. However, there is evidence for clustering of genes at the same
genomic location belonging to the same metabolic pathways in fungi. For example, genes involved in secondary
metabolism are clustered in the genomes of filamentous
ascomycetes [44], and many of the genes involved in
metabolism of allantoin and galactose are clustered in the
genome of S. cerevisiae and related species [45,46]. Many
functionally-related genes are co-expressed, even when
they do not share sequence similarity [26]. Lee and Sonnhammer [47] found that there is significant tendency for
genes from the same metabolic pathway to cluster in the
genomes of fungi, and in other organisms. However, their
definition of proximity was very large, and included genes

Fitzpatrick et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:290
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/290

that were separated by up to 400 other genes. Our analysis had a more focused approach, as we searched for evidence of genes involved in the same metabolic pathway
lying up to 10 genes apart in Candida species.
Currently there are 155 metabolic pathways that have
been manually curated by the Candida Genome Database. However, 23 of these contain only one gene, and a
further 33 are redundant. For example, the list of genes
involved in the acrylonitrile and aldoxime degradation
pathways are identical. Similarly the tyrosol, tryptophan,
phenylalanine and chorismate biosynthesis are all subsets
of the superpathway of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. There are 99 unique pathways, containing 659 genes. There are 511 unique genes in total,
representing 8.2% of the C. albicans SC5314 gene set.
CGOB was interrogated for evidence of clustering of
genes (i.e. lying within 10 genes of one another on the
same chromosome) in the 99 nonredundant pathways.
We identified 21 pathways that display evidence of gene
clustering in at least one Candida species (Table 4 and
Additional file 4). Some metabolic pathway clusters result
from tandem duplication; for example, AOX1 and AOX2
(encoding cyanide insensitive enzymes required for an
alternative pathway of aerobic respiration) in C. albicans,
C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, were also
identified as tandem cluster 9 (Additional file 3). There is
evidence of species-specific clusters of unrelated genes,
such as lysine biosynthesis and glycine biosynthesis,
which are clustered in one species only (C. tropicalis and
C. parapsilosis respectively, Table 4, Additional file 4).
A high proportion (48%) of the clusters identified contain only two genes and may not be biologically significant, as they appear at a high frequency in randomized
data (see Methods). However, the metabolic clusters discussed here are highly significant, particularly for the
three pathways discussed below.

teria and BIO4 from Î±-proteobacteria, followed by gene
duplication and neofunctionalization.
We identified a biotin cluster of four genes (orthologs
of S. cerevisiae BIO2, BIO3, BIO4 and BIO5) in both C.
albicans strains (Figure 4). There is however an inversion
of the surrounding region between SC5314 and WO-1
(Figure 4); this appears to result from a rearrangement
between two members of the oligopeptide transporter
gene family, OPT9 (a pseudogene) and OPT1.
The cluster in C. albicans is larger than the equivalent
region in S. cerevisiae as it includes BIO2. BIO2 orthologs
are in the same chromosomal region in C. albicans, D.
hansenii, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (Figure 4).
BIO3, BIO4 and BIO5 are also adjacent to each other in C.
tropicalis, and they appear to have been recruited to the
BIO2 region in C. albicans. Almost the entire cluster,
together with an adjacent OPT gene, is missing from C.
dubliniensis. Only BIO2 remains, and this is located elsewhere in the genome. The absence of the biotin cluster in
C. dubliniensis has previously been reported, and it was
suggested that its presence in C. albicans may contribute
to increased prevalence and virulence [51]. The entire set
of BIO genes is also absent from C. parapsilosis and L.
elongisporus, and was probably lost in their last common
ancestor (not shown). There is some conservation of synteny of the surrounding genes (not shown), suggesting
the genes were lost together, as a cluster. Unlike S. cerevisiae, the biotin clusters in C. albicans and C. tropicalis are
not sub-telomeric.
The remaining Candida species contain some genes
involved in biotin synthesis. BIO2 is present in almost all
species, suggesting it may play a role independent of biotin synthesis. BIO4 and BIO5 are clustered in D. hansenii
with BIO2 elsewhere in the genome, whereas BIO2, BIO3
and BIO4 are present in P. stipitis, but are not clustered
(not shown). It is not clear why some components of the

(i) The biotin biosynthesis pathway

Biotin or vitamin H acts as a cofactor for a set of enzymes
that catalyze carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions in a number of crucial metabolic
processes [48]. Most multicellular eukaryotes (except for
plants) are biotin auxotrophs, whereas many bacterial
species and some fungi (including Aspergillus and Saccharomyces species) are biotin prototrophs [49,50].
In S. cerevisiae 6 genes are involved in the production
of biotin (BIO1-6). These are located in 2 clusters (BIO1/
BIO6 and BIO3/BIO4/BIO5, with BIO2 at a different location) [49]. Hall and Dietrich [49] showed that the original
eukaryotic biotin pathway was lost in the last common
ancestor of Candida and Saccharomyces species, but it
has been rebuilt through horizontal gene transfer from
bacterial species via transfers of BIO3 from Î´-proteobac-

pathway are retained in some species. However, it may
enable them to make biotin from some intermediates, as
was described for S. cerevisiae [52]. It is generally
assumed however that clustering of genes in biosynthetic
pathways is the result of selection against toxic intermediates produced by incomplete pathways [49]. It is likely
that the ancestral Candida species was able to synthesize
biotin, but there has been substantial gene loss in many
species.
In S. cerevisiae BIO6 is believed to have arisen through
gene duplication of BIO3 followed by subfunctionalization [49]. We cannot locate an ortholog of BIO6 in any
Candida species. Similarly we cannot locate any Candida
ortholog of BIO1 (pimeloyl-CoA synthetase), the first
enzyme involved in synthesizing biotin from pimelic acid.
In S. cerevisiae S288C, BIO1 and BIO6 are pseudogenes
[49], but there is no evidence of corresponding pseudogenes in any Candida species. It is therefore unlikely that
the genes are present in other unsequenced isolates of the
same species.
The CGD biotin pathway data suggests that orf19.3567
(BIO32) is involved in biotin synthesis. BIO32 has a top
BLASTP hit to BIO3 in S. cerevisiae. However, BIO3
belongs to a multigene family that also contains ARG8,
CAR2 and UGA1. To determine the origin of BIO32 we
reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using the same
sequences used by Hall and Dietrich [49], and included
ARG8, CAR2 and UGA1 from C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Our phylogeny places the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans BIO3 orthologs together with bacterial sequences,
indicating that they originated from horizontal gene
transfer as suggested by Hall and Dietrich [49]. S. cerevisiae BIO6 is also grouped in this clade, supporting the
hypothesis that it is a duplicate of BIO3. However, BIO32
from C. albicans is grouped with S. cerevisiae and C. albicans orthologs of ARG8, CAR2 and UGA1 in a separate
clade (not shown). BIO32 is therefore most likely a duplicate of one of these genes, and is more likely to be
involved in arginine or glutamate metabolism than in biotin synthesis.

Our clustering analysis shows that the Nag regulon is
conserved in all Candida species, with the exception of C.
lusitaniae (Figure 5, Additional file 4). In the latter species, there has been an insertion of 5 species-specific
genes in the region between HXK1 and NAG1, resulting
in a sequence of 19,931 basepairs (bp), whereas the intergenic region in the other species is less than 516 bp. Several of the inserted genes encode members of a family of
cell wall genes, related to Flo1 from S. cerevisiae. The Nag
cluster is sub-telomeric in many of the Candida species,
and repeats of cell wall genes are commonly found near
telomeres [55]. The conservation of the Nag regulon in
pathogens like C. albicans and nonpathogens such as P.
stipitis suggests that the ability to utilize Nag is not a virulence factor. NAG3, NAG4 and NAG6, which lie close to
the NAG cluster in many Candida species (Figure 5), are
not involved in the conversion of Nag, but are more likely
to encode drug efflux pumps [56,57]. NAG3 is a tandem
duplicate of NAG4 (Additional file 3, cluster 59), which
occurred in the ancestor of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C.
tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and L. elongisporus (Figure 1).

It has been proposed that the ability of pathogenic strains
of Candida to utilize sugars such as glucosamine and Nacetylglucosamine (Nag) as alternative carbon sources are
important virulence factors [53]. C. albicans mutants
incapable of utilizing Nag are less virulent in a murine
model of systemic candidiasis compared to wild type isolates [54]. The three genes involved in the conversion of
Nag to fructose-6-phosphate encode hexokinase kinase
(HXK1/orf19.2154),
Nag-6-phosphate
deaminase
(NAG1/orf19.2156) and Nag-6-phosphate deacetylase
(DAC1/orf19.2157). These act sequentially on Nag and
are present in C. albicans in a cluster termed the Nag regulon [53].

Fitzpatrick et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:290
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/290

The phylogenomic distribution of the Nag regulon is
intriguing. The cluster is found in the Candida species,
but NAG1 and DAC1 are missing in the Saccharomyces
lineage. Homologs are also absent from Ashbya gossypii
and Kluyveromyces waltii, suggesting the cluster is missing from the entire Saccharomycetes lineage. However,
the origin of the NAG cluster may be an ancient event.
DAC1 and NAG1 are in close proximity (within two
genes) in the Aspergilli and in Neurospora crassa, which
belong to the Pezizomycotina, a sister clade to the Saccharomycotina. DAC1 and NAG1 also lie within 2 genes
in the Basidiomycete, Ustilago maydis. If the cluster arose
in an ancestor of the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota,
it is very ancient, and the genes have been subsequently
lost from many species (including Schizosaccharomyces).

(iii) The Leloir galactose utilization pathway

Galactose is utilized by most organisms through its conversion to glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis [58]. The GAL pathway is composed of both
structural and regulator elements [59]. The galactose
metabolism structural genes of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans are well conserved, whereas their regulatory components are distinct [59]. In C. albicans the structural genes
(GAL1, GAL10 and GAL7) are arranged in a cluster close
to a hexose transporter HGT2 [59]. This cluster, together
with two additional uncharacterized genes which lie
between GAL10 and GAL7, is conserved in C. albicans,
C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis and D. hansenii [59]. We
show that the GAL pathway cluster is conserved in all
Candida species present in CGOB (Figure 6).
Both C. albicans strains and C. lusitaniae have a gene
insertion between GAL1 and GAL10 (not shown). The C.
albicans gene (orf19.3671) is designated "dubious " by
CGD, and is a pseudogene in WO-1, with no significant
similarity to any other gene known from any other organism. Similarly the C. lusitaniae gene (CLUG_02293) has
no significant homologs in either GenBank or CGOB
Blast databases. The intergenic regions between GAL1
and GAL10 are 490 and 1362 nucleotides in C. lusitaniae
and C. albicans, similar to the intergenic regions in all the
other Candida species. It is likely therefore that both
orf19.3671 and CLUG_02293 are errors in annotation,
rather than real genes and so are not shown in Figure 6.
Expression of the hexose transporter HGT2 is strongly
induced by galactose in C. albicans [59]. An ortholog of
HGT2 is also very close to GAL1 in C. dubliniensis, C.
tropicalis, C. guilliermondii and C. lusitaniae (Figure 6).
HGT2 belongs to a large gene family, and while multiple
homologs were located in many species, there is no family member adjacent to the GAL cluster in C. parapsilosis,
L. elongisporus and P. stipitis. A putative ortholog in D.
hansenii was identified, although it resides on a different
chromosome to the GAL genes (Figure 6). It is possible

and homologs are organized in pillars. Diagonal lines indicate local inversions. Genes shown in grey boxes are not adjacent to any other

that even though the relative position of the hexose transporter is not conserved, co-expression with the GAL
genes may be.
Interestingly, orf19.3674, which lies between GAL10
and GAL7, appears to be a paralog of GAL10, and is conserved in all the Candida species. This was also noted in
the P. stipitis genome [3]. Gal10 is more than twice the
size of orf19.3674 (675 vs. 320 amino acids), and contains
two recognized protein domains, an NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase domain and an aldose 1-epimerase
domain. Only the first domain is present in orf19.3674
and its orthologs. Expression of this gene is not influenced by galactose in C. albicans [59]. orf19.3674 may
therefore have undergone subfunctionalization after
duplication. Alternatively, recombination between a
GAL10 precursor and another gene may have led to gene
with a novel function. An ortholog of the adjacent conserved gene (orf19.3673) encodes a subunit of the transport protein particle (TRAPP) of the cis-Golgi in S.
cerevisiae [60] and is unlikely to be involved in galactose
metabolism.
KEGG Analysis

We also assigned genes in each Candida species to individual metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [61]. This approach permitted us to investigate species-specific metabolic pathways, as well as pathways that have been described only

in C. albicans SC5314. Approximately 200 metabolic
pathways were reconstructed for each Candida species
(Table 5). However, ~30% of these were redundant (Table
5). For example, in C. dubliniensis, the inferred components of the pathways for peptidoglycan and alkaloid biosynthesis are completely contained in the alanine,
aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway (not
shown). The number of gene assignments to the nonredundant pathways is approximately 2000 for each Candida species. On average close to 50% of these are represented in multiple pathways (Table 5). Therefore between
16-19% of genes from each Candida species have been
successfully assigned to a unique KEGG metabolic pathway (Table 5), equating to 17.8% of all Candida genes represented in CGOB.
We interrogated each Candida species in CGOB for
evidence of clustering in the non-redundant KEGG pathways (Table 5). In total we identified 62 pathways; (33-44
per species) that display some evidence of gene clustering
(Table 5). There are 767 KEGG clusters (KCs) shared
amongst all species, and of these 32 have arisen through
tandem duplication (Additional file 5). Most of the identified KCs are small, containing two or three genes. A high
proportion (75%) of these may not be biologically significant (Additional file 4), as they appear at a high frequency
in randomized data (see Methods).
Overall the observed KEGG metabolic pathway clusters
are generally distinct from those located using the CGD
pathways (Additional file 4 and Additional file 5). There is
a small degree of crossover, including the CGD tRNA
charging pathway, which is analogous to KEGG's aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway, the CGD aerobic respiration pathway which is equivalent to oxidative
phosphorylation in KEGG, and the galactose metabolism
and histidine metabolism pathways in both. Several pathways (such as clustering of histone protein genes
(ko05322) and ribosomal protein genes (ko03010) have
been described previously. It is likely that other clusters

will be identified when the assignments to pathways
improve. For example, Jeffries and Van Vleet [26] identified some small clusters of functionally-related genes in P.
stipitis by visual inspection. Our approach found some of
these, but not all.

Conclusions
We describe here a unique tool for studying evolution
and gene function in Candida species. During the development of CGOB we improved the existing annotations
for several species, by identifying and removing partial
open reading frames, and by manually assigning homology, based on sequence similarity and synteny. We also
provide a detailed analysis of gene clusters in Candida,
which will provide a basis for future investigation. We
identified many of the clusters described in only one species [3,4,26,53,59]. However, we have also shown the benefits of a comparative approach; some clusters (such as
NAG) although originally described in C. albicans only
are present in all Candida species, whereas others (such
as CIP) are unique to one (P. stiptis). Our analysis provides an important resource that is now available for the
Candida community.
Methods
Genome Data

The complete C. albicans (SC5314) genome (Assembly
21 [31]) was obtained from the Candida genome database (CGD) [62]. Gene sets for C. albicans WO-1, C.
tropicalis, L. elongisporus, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae [5] were obtained directly from the Broad Institute [63] and for C. dubliniensis [7] from GeneDB at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [64]. The first assembly
of the C. parapsilosis genome was downloaded from the
Sanger Institute [65] and in-house gene annotations were
called (as described in Fitzpatrick et al [8]). The resultant
gene set contains 5,809 protein-coding genes. The C.
parapsilosis genome was also automatically annotated by

the Broad Institute [5], and we use these gene names
where possible.
Phylogenetic relationships

Phylogenetic relationships were determined using a
supertree approach. All ten Candida genomes as well as
two outgroups (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida
glabrata) were merged into a local Blast database. For a
full descriptions of the methodology used please refer to
Fitzpatrick et al [8].
Homology pillars and genome editing

Sets of homologous genes are stored in CGOB's pillars
(Figure 2). Pillars are the core data structures used to
store homology assignments across all species [20]. All
genes were integrated into homology pillars by performing an automated bi-directional best BLASTP hit (Evalue cut-off of 10-5) strategy against C. albicans SC5314.
A second round of automated searching merged singleton pillars using a BLASTP hit (E- value cut-off of 10-5)
and synteny with at least one gene in an adjacent pillar.
We then systematically manually edited CGOB by browsing along each Candida chromosome validating and
refining homology pillars.
Several potential genes in the automatically called open
reading frames sets are incomplete or "partial". We
merged partial ORFs where possible, by aligning them
against their complete orthologs from the other Candida
genomes using Muscle [66]. The resultant alignments
were manually checked and where appropriate, partial
ORFs were merged and the resulting gene models were
renamed, and added to CGOB's pillars. For completeness
both the merged genes and the original partial ORFs have
been retained in the CGOB Blast sequence database.
Duplications

Genes that have arisen through tandem duplication were
located using bl2seq from the NCBI suite of Blast executables. A tandem repeat was defined as adjacent genes
with an E- value cut-off of 10-10 with a highest scoring
sequence pair (HSP) more than half the length of the
shortest sequence. This approach filters out genes with
similarity over short regions. Tandem genes that are
evolving rapidly or have low sequence complexity may
not be located using sequence similarity. We therefore
programmed CGOB to compare tandem duplicates in all
genomes, and used synteny to locate fast evolving tandems (or tandems with low complexity) in another
genome.
Synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates for genes located in tandem clusters were estimated using the methods of Yang and Nielsen [67] as
implemented in yn00 in the PAML suite [68].

Page 12 of 14

To identify multigene families, every gene in a particular Candida proteome was searched against every other
gene in its cognate genome. Genes with a BLASTP Evalue less than 10-30 and a HSP more than 60% the length
of the shortest sequence were considered to be members
of the same family, this is the same strategy used by Braun
et al [31].
Locating clusters of adjacent genes in metabolic pathways

Metabolic pathways for C. albicans SC5314 were downloaded from the Candida Genome Database [62]. The
gene identifiers for each enzymatic step were mapped on
CGOB. Clusters were defined as identifiers belonging to a
particular metabolic pathway that lie within a contiguous
window of 10 genes. The presence or absences of C. albicans SC5314 pathway homologs were then scored in the
remaining nine Candida genomes.
For completeness we automatically inferred individual
metabolic pathways for all Candida species using the
KEGG automatic annotation server (KAAS) [69]. KAAS
is based on reciprocally best BLAST similarity hits
against all KEGG orthology (KO) groups of functionally
related genes assigned in the KEGG GENES database.
KAAS assigned each Candida gene a KO number and
these were subsequently mapped to one of KEGG's reference metabolic pathways. All Candida KO identifiers
were mapped onto CGOB and we searched for metabolic
clusters as described above.
The significance of metabolic clusters was tested using
simulations where gene order was randomized to give
pseudogenomes. Both CGD and KEGG pathway components were mapped onto randomized genome data and
scored as described above. This process was repeated
10000 times for each pathway in each Candida genome.
Clusters are considered significant if the number of
linked genes in the pseudogenome is less than that
observed in the real genome 95% of the time.
