Abstract
Nucleic acid polymerases have similar structures and motifs. The function of an aspartic acid
(conserved in all classes of nucleic acid polymerases) in motif A remains poorly understood in
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. We mutated this residue to alanine in a poliovirus replicon.
The resulting mutant could still replicate, although at a reduced level. In addition, mutation A231C
(also in motif A) yielded high levels of replication. Taken together these results show that poliovirus
polymerase conserved residues D233 and A231 are not essential to poliovirus replicon function.

Background
Poliovirus is a member of the picornaviridae to which rhinovirus and hepatitis A virus also belong. Picornaviruses
share many replication strategies including cap-independent translation and a single polyprotein open reading
frame. However, central to these viruses are the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), responsible for replication of both strands of the viral RNA genome and
mRNA transcription. The structures of several RdRP have
been solved by X-ray crystallography [1-4]. These
polymerases retain the "right-hand" motif of other
polymerases, with finger, thumb and palm domains [5].
However, they differ in having a closed active site: it is
fully enclosed due to interactions between the fingers and
thumb domains.
Canonical motifs were originally recognized by phylogenetic sequence comparisons [6]. The crystal structures
have revealed that phylogenetically conserved motifs can
be structurally conserved. For RdRPs, these are A, B, C, D
and E (diagrammed in [7]). Except for motif E, which is

located between the palm and thumb domains, the motifs
are clustered in the palm, as suggested earlier [8]. Mutational and biochemical studies, in concert with structural
data, have led to hypotheses about the function of these
motifs in polymerase function. The function of motif C is
best understood, since it contains an absolutely conserved
aspartic acid. This aspartic acid is included in Gly-AspAsp, which is conserved in most known RdRPs. The function of the aspartic acids is believed to be coordination of
the magnesium metal ions, required for activation of the
3'OH of the primer.
The A motif consists of a beta strand, a beta turn and an
alpha helix. Although A motifs from the various classes of
polymerases differ, the aspartate corresponding to amino
acid position 233 in RdRP of poliovirus polymerase
(3Dpol) is conserved among the four classes. The homologous residue (D537) in T7 RNA polymerase is essential for
polymerase function and coordinates magnesium,
required at the active site [9,10]. In HIV reverse transcriptase the homologous residue (D110) is not essential

for RNase H activity, but is for RNA-dependent DNA
polymerase function [11] and pyrophosphorolysis [12].
In T7 DNA polymerase the homologous residue Asp-705
binds one metal ion in the crystal structure. However, the
function of this conserved residue in RdRP remains poorly
understood. Functions of some other conserved residues
have been delineated. Mutants in position D238 from
3Dpol have a low amount of in vitro polymerase activity
and render the virus temperature sensitive. Glutamine
710 in motif A in Klenow DdDP provides part of a steric
gating mechanism, preventing rNTPs from binding to the
polymerase [13].
Alanine 231 is conserved as well, in that the position is
valine or glycine among the enteroviruses) [14] and
hydrophobic or small residues (alanine, glycine, valine or
serine) among DNA polymerases [15].
The functions of motif B and D are not known; however,
each forms an alpha helix that may be responsible for
proper positioning of the other motifs.

Results
To determine the importance of residues A231 and D233
of 3Dpol, we constructed 3 mutant replicons: D233A,
A231C and the double mutant A231C/D233A (Figure 1).
The site and amino acid mutants we chose to study were

obtained during a ribavirin resistance screen (data not
shown). Moreover, we wished to determine the function
of the conserved D233.
Poliovirus luciferase replicons (kindly provided by R.
Andino) consist of a luciferase reporter gene (either firefly
or renilla) substituted, in frame, for the capsid region [16].
The renilla luciferase replicon was mutagenized 3 separate
times for this study and the firefly replicon once. For
mutagenesis, we used the Stratagene Quick Change Kit II.
Double stranded DNA encoding the replicon along with
the mutagenic primer pair was used as template and primers for pfu Ultra high fidelity enzyme. The mutagenic oligonucleotides consisted of a sense strand of 32–45 bases
flanking the mutations and the complimentary oligonucleotide.
For the mutagenesis reaction, target DNA and the mutagenic primers were thermocycled. In this strategy, both
strands of the target are synthesized. The first cycle was
95°C for 30 sec. The following 16 cycles were 95°C 30
sec, 55°C 1 min and 68°C for 9 1/2 min (1 minute/kb).
The products were then treat with Dpn I for 1 hr at 37°C
to remove the unmutagenized bacterial DNA. The reaction products were then transformed into XLI Blue supercompetent cells and plated in the presence of X-gal and
IPTG. A mutagenized β-galactosidase (Whitescript) was

used as a positive control for mutagenesis. DNA from
resulting colonies was sequenced at the LSUHSC sequencing core and proper mutant sequence confirmed. Appropriate plasmids were grown and isolated using qiagen kits.
For introduction of poliovirus replicons into cells, RNA is
required. The replicons have a built-in T7 promoter to
produce RNA in vitro. For RNA transcription, DNA samples were treated with RNase-free conditions, including
using DEPC-treated water. Plasmid DNA was first treated
with proteinase K in 0.5% SDS at 37°C for 30 min. Following the incubation, the DNA was extracted three times
phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform and ethanol precipitated. Then DNA was linearized with Pvu I or
Mlu I. After ethanol precipitation, samples were transcribed, using the Megascript T7 kit (Ambion). After add-

ing anti-RNase, the DNA was transcribed for 3 hours at
37°C. Following transcription, the samples were subjected to DNase treatment for 15 min at 37°C and Megaclear columns (Ambion). Samples were inspected on
agarose gel electrophoresis for intactness.
To assess the mutants' function, in vitro transcribed RNA
was electroporated into Hela cells. Hela cells were first
trypsinized, washed with PBS and resuspended at 2 × 107
cells/ml. 2 × 106 Hela cells were used per transfection. 2 μg
of RNA per 106 cells was added and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells and RNA were then aliquotted into 0.2 mm electroporation cuvettes and
electroporated at 120 V for 1 pulse and 50 milliseconds in
an Electro Square Porator ECM830. Samples were immediately put in warm DMEM + 10% FCS, Pen/Strep. One

sample was taken for "time zero" and the remaining cells
were split into dishes.
Upon electroporation, the replicons undergo a single
round of replication. Because the luciferase gene is in
frame with the genome, levels of luciferase reflect the levels of poliovirus replication. Following electroporation,
timepoint samples were assessed for luminescence. Cells
from each timepoint were scraped, centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl ProMega "Passive Lysis Buffer" or
"Renilla Lysis buffer." After a 15 min room temperature
incubation with gentle rocking, samples were centrifuged.
Supernatants were collected and stored at -70°C until
analysis. A Sealite Sciences luminometer was used to analyze the samples for 10 sec. A renilla and a firefly luciferase
assay system from Promega were used to provide the
luminescent substrates and diluents. Renilla (Chemicon)
and firefly (Promega) positive controls were used.
We found that the A231C mutant was almost as active as
wild type (Figure 2). The D233A mutant is about two
orders of magnitude less active than wild type, but still
two orders of magnitude above the "mock" sample. The
double mutant is very similar to D233A, suggesting that
its defect is primarily due to D233A, rather than A231C.
Similar results were obtained with D233A in the firefly
luciferase replicon.
Therefore, we conclude that A231 is not required for
poliovirus replicon replication. D233 is important for replicon function, but it is not essential. Whether this is true
for other RdRPs or polymerases in general, remains to be
seen. In 3Dpol, these two residues are positioned on the
same side of the beta strand, pointing slightly away from
the heart of the active site. It is noteworthy that in the
poliovirus A motif, there is another aspartic acid, at position 238, which points more directly towards the catalytic
aspartic acids, D328 and D329 in motif C. It is possible
that D238 participates in the hypothesized magnesium
coordination in conjunction with D238 and D239. We
cannot eliminate the possibility that this finding is peculiar to replicons and may not apply to virus. However,
other virus replicon systems have been successfully used
to identify functions that apply to virus [17,18].
