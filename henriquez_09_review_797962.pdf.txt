Review
There is an increasing interest and awareness of the freeliving amoeba, Acanthamoeba, over recent years as an
opportunistic pathogen of medical importance. The publication of this book is a timely reflection of this current
situation. The author is to be congratulated on the provision of such a comprehensive review of the literature concerning all aspects of Acanthamoeba research. The
intention of the author was to provide an essential reference for researchers of infectious diseases. This is achieved
and in addition, this book should also be beneficial to students at the university level with a specific interest in
microbiology.
The book is divided into nine sections: Biology and Phylogeny, Life Cycle and Genotyping, Acanthamoeba Infections, Pathogenesis, Immune Response, Strategies Against
Acanthamoeba Infections, Acanthamoeba: Trojan Horse of
the Microbial World, Conclusion and Future Studies, Bibliography. Each section is appropriately detailed, complete and subdivided into specific topics. One minor
criticism would be that the diagrams and illustrations are
not always clear, perhaps due to many having been reproduced from other sources.
The first two sections detail the cell biology and the habitat of the Acanthamoeba from its organelles to their functions, from its distribution to the relationship it has

developed with the environment. This section is very
informative on its life cycle and allows the reader to
understand how this organism is now known to be so versatile and adaptable. Interestingly, it also provides useful
information in culturing Acanthamoeba under laboratory
conditions, such as isolating Acanthamoeba from environmental samples and genotyping the species, successful
axenic cultivation, methods of encystation, storage and
determination of the viability of trophozoites and cysts.
These are essential tools for researchers working with this
organism.
This middle sections concern the increasing knowledge
we have acquired of the infections that Acanthamoeba can
cause as an opportunistic pathogen. The increase in incidence of Acanthamoeba keratitis with the use of contact
lenses has been a major contributing factor in the growing
awareness of this pathogen. The author details with clarity
how Acanthamoeba can bind to both worn and unworn
contact lenses, the impact of biofilm in contracting Acanthamoeba keratitis, the clinical outcome of infection and
diagnosis. A significant chapter is dedicated to Acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis (GAE) which,
although a rare disease, is often fatal. Major concerns
regard immunocompromised patients, who are rendered
more susceptible to this disease. A smaller section focuses
on cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, which is characterised by
nodules in the skin and ulcerations. For both GAE and
cutaneous acanthamoebiasis there is no recommended
treatment. This book raises awareness of these diseases
that often are misdiagnosed.
Attention is also paid to the different models used in
research to understand pathogenesis, from the in vivo

models for Acanthamoeba keratitis, which include the
Yucatan micropig and Chinese hamster to those for GAE,
which include the use of the African migratory locust.
However, many studies that dissect the host-pathogen
relationship have often used ex vivo and in vitro techniques
to understand pathogenesis at the molecular level. Hostpathogen interaction has been elaborately described in
this book from the crossing of the biological barriers to
direct virulence factors, including contact-dependent and
-independent mechanisms and indirect virulence factors,
such as temperature tolerance, osmotolerance and pH tolerance. This suitably introduces the section, which focuses
on the host's immune response to infection of this organism. The introduction to the immune system provided in
this text is simplistic, but it allows the reader to acquire to
the basic concepts necessary to understand the immune
response against Acanthamoeba infections and what mechanisms Acanthamoeba uses to evade immune responses.
The final sections focus on the strategies currently in place
against Acanthamoeba infections and the author provides
an excellent summary of a plethora of chemotherapeutic
agents that have been tested for anti-Acanthamoebic activity. These include membrane-acting agents, inhibitors of
DNA synthesis and polyamine metabolism, RNA synthesis inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, tricyclic neuroleptic agents and antimicrobial compounds from
natural products. Despite the large variety of anti-Acanthamoebic compounds, emerging drug resistance is a
problem and focus is moving towards prevention of infection with the use of disinfectants. This problem is dutifully highlighted in this book where the author also
describes future prospects for treatment and prevention.
Acanthamoeba is often referred to as the 'Trojan Horse' of
the microbial world. The significance of this is illustrated
very well in this book, as the author explains how Acanthamoeba can habour a diverse number of pathogens,
including viruses, bacteria, yeasts and Protozoa, thus making it not only an opportunistic pathogen, but also a vector for other important pathogens.
This book is certainly a 'must read' for all scientists interested in medical and environmental microbiology. It is a
very convincing overview and foundation of what is
already known about Acanthamoeba, but the literature is
constantly progressing rapidly and new information is
arising about this, until recently, understudied organism.
