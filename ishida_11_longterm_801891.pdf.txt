Abstract
Background: Ecological specializations such as antipredator defense can reinforce morphological and distributional
divergence within hybridizing species. Two hybridizing species of Daphnia (D. galeata and D. dentifera) are
distributed in both Japan and North America; however, these populations have a longer history in Japan than in
North America due to the differing impact of the last glaciation on these two regions. We tested the hypothesis
that this longer coexistence in Japan would lead to extensive genetic admixture in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
whilst the distinct morphological traits and distributional patterns would be maintained.
Results: The high level of correspondence among morphological traits, distribution, and mitochondrial and nuclear
DNA types for the specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA indicated that the species distinction has been maintained.
However, a discordance between mtDNA and nuclear ITS-1 types was observed for most specimens that had D.
galeata mtDNA, consistent with the pattern seen between the two species in North America. This observation
suggests nuclear introgression from D. dentifera into D. galeata without mitochondrial introgression.
Conclusions: The separation of morphological traits and distribution ranges of the two hybridizing species in
Japan, as well as in North America, has been maintained, despite large differences in climatic and geographical
histories of these two regions. Variations in environmental factors, such as predation pressure, might affect
maintenance of the distribution, although the further studies are needed to confirm this.

Background
The factors that determine the range and distribution
patterns of a species along latitudinal and altitudinal
gradients have gained significant interest with the recognition that global warming has the potential to cause
shifts in these patterns and change interactions among
species [1-3]. The range and distribution pattern of a
species can be limited by geographical barriers, interactions with other species, or failure to adapt at range
margins because of lack of genetic variation, dispersal
load, or stochastic extinction [4,5]. When the distribution patterns of two or more closely related species

overlap, these species may hybridize and produce hybrid
zones, which can affect species distribution [6]. The
consequences of hybridization on the distribution patterns depend on various environmental and genetic factors, including environmental selection, dispersal ability,
asymmetric hybridization, and fitness of hybrid offspring
[7]. It is important to consider how these factors affect
the range and distribution patterns of species under the
effect of frequent hybridization.
Members of the subgenus Hyalodaphnia inhabit freshwater lakes and ponds over a wide range of Holarctic
regions. Hybridization between species of Hyalodaphnia
with overlapping ranges has been observed in many dispersed locations [8]. Daphnia galeata, a species of Hyalodaphnia, has a wide Holarctic distribution [9], which
overlaps with that of all the other members of Hyalodaphnia, except Daphnia umbra [10-16]. In these overlapping
areas, local hybrids involving D. galeata are common and

often more abundant in lakes than the parental taxa
[8,17-19]. Daphnia dentifera, a vicariant taxon of Daphnia
longispina sensu Petrusek et al. [20], also has a wide distribution in North America and Japan [21], and hybridizes
with D. galeata in North America [15,22] (Figure 1).
Nuclear loci of D. dentifera were introduced into most
North American populations of D. galeata [14,15,21,23].
There are several morphological differences between
D. galeata and D. dentifera, including a dark ring on the
base of the distal segment of the swimming setae present
in D. dentifera and variations in the number of postabdominal claws [12]. The differences in phenotypic
adaptations as an antipredator defense are conspicuous.
Since carnivorous invertebrates (e.g., Chaoborus midge
larvae, Leptodora, Bythotreps, Cyclops) and gape-limited
young-of-the-year (YOY) fish selectively prey upon

Page 2 of 13

daphniids with a smaller body size, individuals with a
larger body size or with other defensive attributes are less
vulnerable to these predators. In response to chemical
cues from these predators, D. galeata often elongates its
head shape and forms a crest [24-29], whereas juveniles
and male D. dentifera occasionally develop neck teeth on
the dorsal margin of the helmet [12]. Both defensive
traits of the crest and neck teeth are beneficial against
these gape-limited predators [30,31]. However, planktivorous fish, with the exception of gape-limited fish, selectively prey upon daphniids with a larger body size [32].
Gelinas et al. [24] noted that the number of D. galeata
possessing a crest increased during and after the season
when YOY fish occurred, indicating that the head morphology of D. galeata is influenced at least in some ways
by the presence of planktivorous fish in these habitats.

D. galeata and D. dentifera are also ecologically distinct
in the range of vertical habitat use within lakes and habitat distribution among lakes of different sizes [22].
Because these two species and their hybrids exhibit a
stable co-existence in many lakes in North America, ecological specialization may reinforce the divergence within
these two species [22].
Recent phylogeographical studies indicated that
D. galeata and D. dentifera should have a longer history
of coexistence in Japan than in North America [21,33].
During the last Ice Age, an ice sheet covered the northern regions of North America [34]. Ishida and Taylor
[21,33] estimated that D. galeata and D. dentifera
should have expanded their ranges throughout North
America after the last deglaciation. On the other hand,
Japan was mostly unglaciated and unoccupied by permafrost during the last Ice Age [35]. Japan should have
functioned as a glacial refugium for temperate freshwater invertebrates during several glacial cycles. Indeed,
one of the oldest mitochondrial clades of D. galeata was
distributed only throughout Japan. Japanese populations
of D. dentifera also have much a higher genetic diversity
and a stronger regional structure than North American
populations, indicating that Japan has provided mature
habitats for the species. Consistently, recent phylogeographical studies have also indicated that Japan should
be rich in regional population structures and endemic
cryptic species of freshwater invertebrates [36-39].
A survey of the distribution, morphological variation,
and hybridization of D. galeata and D. dentifera in Japan
would provide an opportunity to test important hypotheses regarding hybridization and morphological evolution.
These two species can be taxonomically distinguished by
certain morphological characteristics in both Japan and
North America. However, since in Japan the two species
experienced different climate histories than they did in
North America, and since they have a longer history of
coexistence there, we hypothesised that this longer coexistence of the two species would lead to extensive genetic
admixture, whereas differences in morphological traits
related to ecological specialization such as an antipredation defense would be maintained. In addition, it is important to examine the environmental factors that affect the
distribution and maintenance of morphological traits that
characterize D. galeata and D. dentifera since this would
help to predict the distribution and biodiversity of Daphnia species under current and future environmental
changes such as global warming.
The purpose of this study is to test our hypothesis
regarding the consequences of the hybridization between
D. galeata and D. dentifera in Japan. We used 66 populations of D. galeata and D. dentifera distributed throughout
Japan, and analyzed the relationships among geographic
distribution patterns, morphological traits of head shape

Page 3 of 13

and body size, and genetic characteristics of mitochondrial
12SrRNA and nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers
(ITS-1 and ITS-2). In particular, we examined (1) to what
degree the morphological traits and the mitochondrial and
nuclear characteristics are correlated, how these traits and
characteristics are distributed in Japan; and (2) to what
degree introgression occurred between these species.

Results
Relationship among mitochondrial genealogy,
morphology, and geographic distributions

The mitochondrial 12SrRNA phylogeny revealed that
Japanese populations consisted of three major clades:
D. galeata, D. dentifera, and new species lineages
(Figure 2). The 12SrRNA alignment (432 bp) was composed of 74 unique haplotypes from 66 Japanese populations with 22 sequences deposited in GenBank [see
Additional file 1]. Seven indels were observed at the
sites 52, 56, 242, 332, 407, 408, and 413. The new species lineages were found in three populations: Nig14,
Ngn20, and Iwt42 (Figure 3).
Differences in head morphology were observed between
specimens with D. galeata mtDNA and those with
D. dentifera mtDNA. While head morphology of specimens with D. galeata mtDNA was various, that of specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA was characterized as
smaller and more ventrally located crest (Figure 4A).
Linear discriminant analysis was conducted using three
morphological variables: relative length of crest (CL1),
relative position of crest (CL2), and body size (BL)
(Figure 5). Because misclassification probability was
lower when using only CL1 and CL2, BL was not used
in this analysis. Scores of linear discriminators (LD1) of
specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA classified these specimens without error, whereas 19.5% of specimens with
D. galeata mtDNA were misallocated as those with
D. dentifera mtDNA (f LD1 = 3.636 × CL1 + 6.335 ×
CL2 - 1.619) [see Additional file 2]. These misallocated
specimens with D. galeata mtDNA were found, irrespective of latitude and altitude.
We identified a significant positive correlation between
CL1 and CL2 of both groups of specimens (specimens
with D. galeata mtDNA: r = 0.4244, P < 0.0064; specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA: r = 0.6759, P < 0.0001;
Figure 4A), and a significant negative correlation between
BL and CL2 of specimens with D. galeata mtDNA (r =
-0.571, P < 0.0002) [see Additional file 3].
Differences in geographical distribution were also
observed between the two groups of specimens (Figure 3).
Specimens with D. galeata mtDNA were distributed at
lower latitudes and altitudes, whereas those with D. dentifera mtDNA were predominately distributed at higher latitudes and altitudes (Figure 3B). Fish were present at 19
collecting sites where specimens with D. galeata mtDNA

occurred, and 18 sites where specimens with D. dentifera
mtDNA occurred, whereas fish were absent in only one
site (Myg31) where specimens with D. galeata mtDNA
occurred and 27 sites where specimens with D. dentifera
mtDNA occurred. Groups with both mtDNA types coexisted in two lakes: Hkd52 and Ygt27. The results of model
selection using GLM showed that the presence of specimens with D. galeata mtDNA at the collecting site was
best explained by the 3 parameters of latitude (L), altitude
(A), and fish presence (F) (best model, L + A + F, AIC =
54.33; second model, L + F, AIC = 55.60; third model, L +
A, AIC = 56.922), and that the presence of specimens with
D. dentifera mtDNA was also best explained by latitude

(L), altitude (A), and fish absence (F) (best model, L + A +
F, AIC = 50.98; second model, L + A, AIC = 51.021; third
model, L + F, AIC = 52.671). In the cases of both mtDNA
types, if we used only one variable (i.e., any of L, A or F),
ΔAIC (difference from the best model) values were larger
than 10. Thus, it can be reasonably concluded that latitude,
altitude, and the presence or absence of fishes affects the
distribution of D. galeata and D. dentifera mtDNA types.

CL1, and CL2 as the dependent variables, and latitude,
altitude, and the presence or absence of fish as the independent variables. The results indicated that the latitude
and the presence or absence of fish affected morphology

(Figure 4 B, C and 4D).
Nuclear ITS-1 phylogeny

Nuclear ITS-1 phylogeny revealed that the Japanese
populations of D. galeata and D. dentifera consisted of
two clades: the D. galeata clade and the D. dentifera
clade (Figure 6). This phylogeny is consistent with the
nuclear phylogeny of ITS-1 and ITS-2 of Taylor et al.
[23]. Since ITS-1 and ITS-2 have a close physical linkage, both phylogenies are expected to reflect the same
evolutionary histories. The ITS-1 alignment (675 bp)
consisted of 20 unique sequences from 15 populations
possessing D. galeata mtDNA, 46 unique sequences
from 37 populations possessing D. dentifera mtDNA,
and 15 sequences of D. galeata and D. dentifera deposited in GenBank [see Additional file 1]. A sequence of
an individual obtained from Hkd54 was found to have a
60 bp repeat fragment from position 375 to 435. We
removed this repeated fragment for the alignment. An
obvious difference between the clades of D. galeata and
D. dentifera was found in a segment between positions
195 and 268.
Recombination test supported the breakpoint at position 192. We compared a phylogeny based on positions
1 to 192 with one based on positions 193 to 675. A
sequence of an individual obtained from Amr39 was
found in lineage G4 (D. galeata clade, Figure 6) based
on positions 1 to 192, but matched the D. dentifera
clade in the phylogeny based on positions 193 to 675,
indicating a recombination event between the D. dentifera clade and lineage G4. None of the other sequences
was found to be recombinant.
The D. galeata clade consisted of three lineages: G1,
G2, and G3. Lineage G1 consisted of European D.
galeata and Japanese specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA. Lineage G2 consisted of Alaskan D. galeata.
Lineage G3 consisted of specimens with D. dentifera
mtDNA in Hokkaido Island and Aomori Prefecture,
which are the northernmost areas of Japan.
The phylogenetic relationship within the D. dentifera
clade was not well characterized by bootstrap tests and
clade credibility values, with the exception of lineage D4.
Alleles D1, D2, and D3 were shared between specimens
with D. galeata mtDNA and those with D. dentifera
mtDNA. Linage D4 consisted of North American D. dentifera and D. galeata and specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA in Tcg16. All specimens possessing D. galeata
mtDNA had alleles of the D. dentifera clade, except for
those of lineage G1 (Figure 3C), while all specimens possessing D. dentifera mtDNA had alleles of the D. dentifera
clade or lineage G3.

Nuclear ITS-2 RFLP and phylogeny

Five major RFLP patterns (C1, C1+C2, C2, C2+B, and
B) were found in the collected specimens of D. galeata
and D. dentifera in Japan. In addition, five minor patterns were found in specimens with D. galeata mtDNA
in Hyg5, Fsm25, and Myg29, and specimens with
D. dentifera mtDNA in Amr43 and Ngn9 [see Additional file 4].
We reconstructed ITS-2 phylogeny based on sequence
data of the major RFLP patterns from the collected specimens in Japan with sequence data of North American and
European specimens deposited in GenBank [see Additional file 5]. The alignment (1111 bp) consisted of 18
sequences from 6 populations possessing D. galeata
mtDNA, 24 sequences from 9 populations possessing
D. dentifera mtDNA, and 16 GenBank sequences.
Sequences of RFLP pattern B consisted of two clades: one
clade included D. galeata (i.e., European and North American D. galeata and Japanese specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA) and specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA in
Ygt27 and Ygt28; the other clade consisted of only Japanese specimens with D. galeata mtDNA. Consistent with
the assumption of Taylor et al. [23], alleles of RFLP pattern B should be indicative of those derived from
D. galeata except for the case of Ygt27 and Ygt28.
Sequences of RFLP patterns C1 and C2 formed polyphyletic clades. Although sequences of RFLP pattern C1
formed two divergent clades, both of the clades consisted
of only specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA, indicating
that alleles of RFLP pattern C1 should be indicative of
those derived from D. dentifera, again consistent with the
assumption of Taylor et al. (2005).
Allele frequency of RFLP pattern C2 was high in both
groups of specimens in Japan, while those of RFLP patterns B and C1 were quite different between the two
groups: specimens with D. galeata mtDNA (B: 23.4%,
C1: 0.8%, C2: 64.5%); specimens with D. dentifera
mtDNA (B: 13.4%, C1: 9.4%, C2: 73.5%). Specimens with
alleles of RFLP patterns C1 and C2 were broadly distributed, irrespective of the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in Japan.

Discussion
Phylogenetic differences in mitochondrial 12SrRNA
sequences corresponded, for the most part, with the morphological differences in head shape. Specimens with
D. dentifera mtDNA exhibited less morphological variation, and had either no crest or a smaller more ventrally
located crest, suggesting that individuals with D. dentifera
mtDNA would retain the typical head morphology of
D. dentifera. On the other hand, specimens with
D. galeata mtDNA exhibited considerably more variation.
Whereas most specimens with D. galeata mtDNA had
longer and more dorsally located crests, some were

Page 9 of 13

indistinguishable from D. dentifera due to a less developed
crest. The differences in mtDNA also corresponded to distributional differences; specimens with D. galeata mtDNA
were mostly distributed at lower latitudes and altitudes,
while specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA were mostly
distributed at higher latitudes and altitudes (Figure 3B).
The mitochondrial dichotomy between the two Daphnia
species corresponded well with morphological and distributional differences in Japan.
Morphological traits and geographical distribution patterns were related to the presence or absence of fish, and
to latitude. Specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA, or specimens with no crest or with smaller crests, were distributed
in lakes and ponds without fish predators, or located at
higher latitudes. In contrast, specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA, or specimens with longer and more dorsally
located crests, were distributed in lakes and ponds containing fish predators, or located at lower latitudes.
Although individuals with larger body size tended to be
distributed in lakes and ponds without fish predators, the
effect of the presence of fish on head shape was larger
than the effect on body size. Habitats located at higher
altitudes tend to have fewer fish due to the limited dispersal ability of fish species. They also tend to be lower in
temperature, thus regulating the feeding types and activities of predators. Because the differences in defensive strategies between D. dentifera and D. galeata can promote
morphological differentiation in head shape, body size,
and ecological differentiation in different habitat types
[22], the differences in predation pressures may relate to
the parapatric distribution of D. galeata and D. dentifera
into latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in Japan. Since
the presence of fish can be an important factor in determining the distributions of the two species, the introduction of fish might diminish the occurrence and diversity of
D. dentifera in lakes and ponds, particularly those located
at higher latitudes. Global warming would also be predicted to reduce the distribution ranges of organisms inhabiting lakes and ponds at higher altitudes, such as
D. dentifera in Japan.
The discordance between mtDNA and nuclear ITS-1
phylogenies is indicative of interspecific introgression and
hybridization between the two species. Specimens with
D. galeata mtDNA in Tcg16 were found unexpectedly in
lineage D4 of the D. dentifera ITS-1 clade, which consisted
of the alleles of North American D. dentifera and
D. galeata, except for the alleles of Tcg16 (Figure 6), indicating that the alleles of lineage D4 may have recently
been introduced from North American populations into
Tcg16. Likewise, Ishida & Taylor [33] argued that a mitochondrial haplotype of D. galeata in Tcg16 may have been
introduced from North America along with the introduction of certain species of fish, such as Oncorhynchus
mykiss and Salvelinus namaycush, which were introduced

Ishida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/209

into Tcg16 in 1877 for commercial and game fishing.
Lineage G3 of the D. galeata ITS-1 clade consisted of specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA in the northernmost
areas of Japan, and was more diverse than lineages G1 and
G2, indicating incomplete lineage sorting or introgression
of common ancestral alleles of lineage G3 from D. galeata
into D. dentifera in the distant past. Since all analyzed specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA had ITS-1 alleles of the
D. dentifera clade or lineage G3, we had no clear evidence
for introgression from D. galeata into D. dentifera in
Japan. This is consistent with the smaller amount of variation in head morphology of specimens with D. dentifera
mtDNA. On the other hand, a discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeny was frequently observed
for specimens with D. galeata mtDNA (Figure 3C and 6).
The same pattern was observed between these two species
in North America [16,23,33].
Nuclear ITS-2 phylogeny also suggested interspecific
introgression between the two species. A clade of the
alleles of RFLP pattern B (indicative of D. galeata) consisted of D. galeata (i.e., European and North American
D. galeata and Japanese specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA) and specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA in two
neighbouring ponds of Ygt27 and Ygt28, which are c. 600
meters distant. Although the population of Ygt28 possessed only D. dentifera mtDNA, the population of Ygt27
possessed both mtDNA types of D. galeata and D. dentifera, suggesting that hybridization or introgression
between the species should occur within the specific
region around Ygt27 and Ygt28.

Conclusion
We tested a hypothesis that the long history of coexistence
between D. galeata and D. dentifera in Japan has led to
extensive genetic admixture in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, despite the fact that differences in the morphological traits related to environmental factors, such as
predation pressure, have been maintained. In the present
study, the correspondence observed among morphology,
distribution, and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA types for
the specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA suggests that the
species distinction has been maintained for D. dentifera.
However, discordance between mtDNA and nuclear ITS-1
types was observed for most specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA, consistent with the pattern found in North America. This suggests nuclear introgression from D. dentifera
into D. galeata without mitochondrial introgression. The
results indicate that variations in environmental factors,
such as predation pressure and temperature, have maintained the separation of distributional ranges and morphological differences, such as head shape, between the two
species. However, we cannot rule out other factors, and
further studies are needed to verify the hypothesis that
selective pressure has maintained the morphological

Page 10 of 13

differences between the two species. We were unable to
estimate the frequency of the introgression, and we were
thus unable to conclude that the long history of coexistence between D. galeata and D. dentifera in Japan has
caused more frequent introgression between the two species than the frequency observed in the same species in
North America. However, even though climatic and geographical conditions have differed greatly between North
America and Japan, particularly during the ice ages, differences in the morphological traits related to environmental
factors, such as predation pressure, have been maintained
in both regions. The pattern of introgression was also consistent between the two regions. Since the present study
indicated that the presence of fish can be an important factor in determining the distributions of the two species, fish
introduction can also diminish the occurrence and diversity
of D. dentifera in lakes and ponds, particularly those
located at higher latitudes. Global warming would also be
likely to reduce the distribution ranges of organisms inhabiting lakes and ponds at high altitude, such as D. dentifera
in Japan,

Methods
Sample collection

Specimens of D. galeata and D. dentifera were collected
from 66 populations (lakes and ponds) in Japan [see Additional file 1]. Distribution of planktivorous fishes in given
ponds/lakes was examined by interviews for local peoples,
anglers and fishermen, and records in research and historical documents of local towns and villages. The planktivorous fishes we examined were cyprinids such as minnows
and crucian carps, salmonid and smelts which are known
to prey preferentially Daphnia species among zooplankton
(e.g., [40]). All samples were preserved in absolute ethanol
or methanol at 4°C. Mitochondrial phylogeny clearly
distinguished clades of D. galeata and D. dentifera
[8,14,21,23,33]. We analyzed mitochondrial 12S sequences
of two to four collected specimens from each population,
and confirmed that most of populations consisted of either
specimens with D. galeata mtDNA or those with D. dentifera mtDNA. Two populations consisted of both specimens with D. galeata mtDNA and with D. dentifera
mtDNA. We sequenced 9 to 10 specimens from each of
the two populations, and identified mtDNA types of each
specimen. Other three populations consisted of specimens
of new mitochondrial lineages, which are different from
any known lineages of the subgenus Hyalodaphnia. We
excluded the populations of the new species lineages from
the analyses. Then, we performed the analyses of nuclear
phylogeny, RFLP, and morphological traits. First, we compared morphologies between specimens with D. galeata
mtDNA and those with D. dentifera mtDNA (see the later
section of morphological measurements) to examine to
what extent the mtDNA types can be distinguished by

Ishida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/209

morphology. Then, linear discriminant analysis was also
performed to quantify whether and to what extent
morphologies determine the mtDNA types, with the aid of
the statistical software R 2.8.1 (R Development Core
Team).
We applied model selection using generalized linear
regression (GLM) to examine which variables (latitude,
altitude, presence/absence of fishes, and their interaction
terms) affect the presence or absence of D. dentifera or
D. galeata in the collecting site. Since the dependent
variable was binomial (i.e., presence or absence), we
used GLM with binominal distribution and logit link.
We explored the set of predictors of the independent
variables with a stepwise AIC procedure; independent
variables were removed and added to the models to
determine the set of predictors that yielded the lowest
AIC by using the software R.
DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted using a chelating
resin, Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad). Samples were incubated in
30 μL of 6% Chelex 100 at 60°C for 3 h, mixed for a
short period, incubated at 98°C for 10 min, centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 min, stored at RT overnight,
and diluted 10 times with TE buffer. We amplified a
fragment of mitochondrial 12SrRNA using the primers
5’- ATG CAC TTT CCA GTA CAT CTA C -3’ and 5’AAA TCG TGC CAG CCG TCG C -3’ [14], and a fragment of nuclear ITS-1 using the 18SD primer 5’ - CAC
ACC GCC CGT CGC TAC TAC CGA TTG -3’ and the
5.8BR primer 5’- TAG GAT TAG CGC ACT TTG
CTG C -3’ [23]. Each 50 μL of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture consisted of 5 μL of extracted DNA,
0.5 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 10 mM
of Tris HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mM of MgCl2, 50 mM of KCl,
and 0.25 units of rTaq (Takara). The PCR temperature
profile used for both the 12SrRNA and ITS-1 amplification reactions was as follows: 1 cycle of 94°C for 1 min,
10 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 53°C for 1 min, and 72°C
for 2 min, and 30 cycles of 92°C for 1 min, 53°C for
2 min, and 72°C for 1 min. After cycle-sequencing using
a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems), sequences were obtained using an ABI
PRISM 3130-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), aligned with Clustal X [41], and manually
adjusted with Se-Al 2.0 [42].
ITS-2 RFLP

We discriminated nuclear ITS-2 sequences of specimens
by using the RFLP method of Taylor et al. (2005). A
fragment of ITS-2 was amplified using the 5.8BF primer
5’- ACC CTG AAC GGT GGA TCA CTA GGC TC -3’
and the 28SD2BR primer 5’- TTA GAA GGA GTT
TAC CTC CCG CTT AGG -3’. Each 10 μL of the PCR

Page 11 of 13

mixture consisted of 5 μL of extracted DNA, 0.5 μM of
each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 10 mM of Tris
HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mM of MgCl2, 50 mM of KCl, and 0.25
units of rTaq (Takara). The PCR temperature profile for
the ITS-2 amplification reaction was: 40 cycles of 94°C
for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min, and final
extension at 72°C for 20 min. Next, 2.5 μL of PCR products were digested with RsaI (New England Biolabs) at
37°C for 3-6 h. Digested products were then electrophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide, and classified into five major RFLP
patterns (C1, C2, B, C1+C2, C2+B) and other minor
patterns, according to Taylor et al. (2005). The C1+C2
and C2+B patterns indicate the heterozygote of the C1
and C2 alleles and the heterozygote of the C2 and B
alleles, respectively. We analyzed 138 individuals from
43 populations possessing D. dentifera mtDNA, and 62
individuals from 20 populations possessing D. galeata
mtDNA [see Additional file 1]. Two or three individuals
of each major RFLP pattern, representing a total of 15
individuals from 15 populations, were cloned and
sequenced. Cloning was performed using a TOPO TA
Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Then, three cultured colonies
were used for sequencing. After cycle-sequencing with a
Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, sequences
were obtained using an ABI PRISM 3130-Avant Genetic
Analyzer, aligned with Clustal X, and manually adjusted
with Se-Al 2.0.
Reconstruction of phylogeny

We analyzed 205 individuals from 66 populations for
mitochondrial 12SrRNA phylogeny using sequences of the
subgenus Hyalodaphnia deposited in GenBank [see Additional file 1]. After we identified the specimens as either D.
galeata mtDNA type or D. dentifera mtDNA type on the
basis of 12SrRNA phylogeny, we directly sequenced and
analyzed the nuclear ITS-1 region of 31 individuals from
15 populations possessing D. galeata mtDNA type and 60
individuals from 37 populations possessing D. dentifera
mtDNA type. We also analyzed the cloned sequences of
the nuclear ITS-2 region of 15 individuals from 15 populations possessing either D. galeata mtDNA or D. dentifera
mtDNA. We reconstructed nuclear phylogenies of ITS-1
and ITS-2 with the sequences of D. galeata and D. dentifera deposited in GenBank using the methods of neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), maximum
likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI). NJ methods
were performed in the program MEGA 5 [43] employing
Kimura 2 parameters models (K80) of sequence evolution
[44], pairwise gap deletions, and 1000 bootstrap replicates.
MP methods were performed in the program MEGA 5
employing a close neighbour interchange as search option
(level = 1), complete gap deletions and 1000 bootstrap
replicates. ML analyses were performed in the program

Ishida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/209

RAxML [45] with the General Time Reversible (GTR) plus
gamma distributed model of sequence evolution and 1000
rapid bootstrap replicates [46]. BI analyses were performed
in the program MrBayes 3.1.2 [47] using models of
sequence evolution independently selected for 12S, ITS-1,
and ITS-2 data sets by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests in
MrModeltest 2.3 [48]. Selected models for 12S, ITS-1,
ITS-2 were GTR plus inverse gamma distribution, K80
plus inverse gamma distribution, K80 plus gamma distribution, respectively. Four Markov chains were started
from randomly chosen trees and run for 6,000,000 generations for 12S, for 17,500,000 generations for ITS-1, and for
2,000,000 generations for ITS-2 with sampling every 100
generations. We confirmed convergence of the Markov
chains by examining whether average standard deviation
of split frequencies was under 0.1 and whether potential
scale reduction factor was close to 1.0. Screening for
recombinant sequences in the nuclear ITS-1 and ITS-2
alignment was performed using single breakpoint algorithm [49].

credibility value of greater than 70%. Asterisks indicate values with less
than 50% bootstrap support values, less than 70% Bayesian support values,
or no support. We distinguished the color of the branch line based on the
ITS-1 RFLP patterns (B, C1, and C2). We used a red line for the sequences
of pattern B, a blue line for those of pattern C1, a gold line for those of
pattern C2, red characters for the specimens with D. galeata mtDNA, and
blue characters for those with D. dentifera mtDNA.

Morphological measurements

We measured head length (HL), crest height (CL1Ob),
and crest position (CL2Ob) (Figure 5) of 183 individuals
from 43 populations of D. dentifera mtDNA type and
108 individuals from 19 populations of D. galeata
mtDNA type [see Additional file 1]. In addition, we
measured body size (BL) of 41 individuals from 15
populations of D. dentifera mtDNA type and 40 individuals from 12 populations of D. galeata mtDNA type,
which are a subset of the samples measured for HL,
CL1Ob, and CL2Ob. Each individual was photographed
and measured using image J (NIH). The relative height
(CL1) and relative position (CL2) of the crest were computed using the following equation to eliminate the
effect of head length (HL) on the observed height
(CL1Ob) and the position (CL2Ob) of the crest:
CL1 = ln(CL1Ob /HL + 1)
CL2 = ln(CL2Ob /HL + 1)

A larger value of CL1 indicates that the crest is more
elongated, and a larger value of CL2 means that the
crest is located closer to the dorsal margin.
To address the effects of latitude, altitude and existence of fish predators on morphology and mtDNA
type, we performed multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) by designating the latitude, altitude, and
the existence of fish predators (1 or 0) as independent
variables and mtDNA types, CL1, CL2 and as dependent
variables. Each statistical analysis was performed using
the software R.
