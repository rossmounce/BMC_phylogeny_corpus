Abstract

Background

ability of such large datasets have added new dimensions to
the study of the human organism; not only are they useful in
elucidating the function of otherwise uncharacterized proteins, but they also provide information on the system-level
properties of the cell [7]. The reconstruction of the evolutionary histories of all genes encoded in a genome, the so-called
phylome [8], constitutes another source of genome-wide
information. Analyses of complete phylomes, however, have

information

The complete sequencing of the human genome represented
a major breakthrough for the genome era [1,2]. Since then, a
number of genome wide experimental and computational
analyses have been performed that capture different aspects
of the biology of the human cell. These analyses include,
among many others, those of the so-called transcriptome [3],
proteome [4], interactome [5] and metabolome [6]. The avail-

interactions

Conclusion: Topological variations among phylogenies for different genes are to be expected,
highlighting the danger of gene-sampling effects in phylogenomic analyses. Several links can be
established between the functions of gene families duplicated at certain phylogenetic splits and
major evolutionary transitions in those lineages. The pipeline implemented here can be easily
adapted for use in other organisms.

Results: We reconstruct here the human phylome, which includes the evolutionary relationships
of all human proteins and their homologs among 39 fully sequenced eukaryotes. Phylogenetic
techniques used include alignment trimming, branch length optimization, evolutionary model
testing and maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Although differences with alternative
topologies are minor, most of the trees support the Coelomata and Unikont hypotheses as well as
the grouping of primates with laurasatheria to the exclusion of rodents. We assess the extent of
gene duplication events and their relationship with the functional roles of the protein families
involved. We find support for at least one, and probably two, rounds of whole genome duplications
before vertebrate radiation. Using a novel algorithm that is independent from a species phylogeny,
we derive orthology and paralogy relationships of human proteins among eukaryotic genomes.

deposited research

Background: Phylogenomics analyses serve to establish evolutionary relationships among
organisms and their genes. A phylome, the complete collection of all gene phylogenies in a genome,
constitutes a valuable source of information, but its use in large genomes still constitutes a technical
challenge. The use of phylomes also requires the development of new methods that help us to
interpret them.

traditionally been prevented by their large demands on time
and computer power. Only recently have faster computers
and algorithms paved the way for the application of phylogenetics to whole genomes. Such analyses have proven to be a
very useful tool for the detection of specific evolutionary scenarios [9] and for the functional characterization of genes and
biological systems [10,11]. Other large-scale phylogenetic
analyses have focused on the establishment of orthology relationships among genes in model species. Most remarkably,
the Ensembl database now includes phylogenetic trees [12],
and the TreeFam [13] and HOVERGEN [14] databases provide automatically derived and curated phylogenies of animal
gene families. Other such databases focus on specific aspects
of the evolution of gene families, such as the detection of
adaptive events [15]. These databases follow a family-based
approach, since they first group the genes into families and
subsequently build a single phylogeny for each family.
Using a different, gene-based approach that aims at maximizing both the coverage over the human genome and the taxonsampling among fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, we
have developed a fully automated pipeline (Figure 1) to reconstruct the phylogenies of every protein encoded in the human
genome and its homologs in 39 eukaryotic species. Such a
pipeline aims at resembling, as much as possible, the manual
procedure used by phylogeneticists while remaining a fully
automated process. In the search for a compromise between
time and reliability, we always tried to adjust the balance
towards the latter, thus assuring high quality in the resulting
phylogenies. In contrast to the abovementioned TreeFam and
Ensembl phylogenetic pipelines, our approach includes evolutionary model testing using maximum likelihood (ML),
model parameter estimation and alignment trimming steps.
Moreover, besides using neighbor joining (NJ) and ML
approaches for phylogenetic reconstruction, our pipeline also
implements a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction
approach to provide posterior probabilities of every partition
in the tree. As a result, building the human phylome presented here took two months on a total of 140 64-bit processors, which is roughly equivalent to 23 years in a single
processor. To our knowledge, this represents the most sophisticated phylome reconstruction pipeline and the largest computing time investment for a single phylome reported to date.
The availability of such a comprehensive collection of evolutionary histories of protein-coding human genes constitutes a
valuable source of information that allows us to test several
evolutionary hypotheses. For this purpose, we investigated
the consistency of the individual phylogenies within the phylome with alternative evolutionary scenarios, namely those
involving the relative positions of rodents and primates,
amoebozoans and opisthokonts and, finally, insects, nematodes and chordates. We also scanned the human phylome for
cases of putative horizontally transferred genes and found
that such topologies are never highly supported, indicating
that they are rather the result of phylogenetic artifacts. More-

over, we provide estimates for the number of gene duplications that have occurred at different evolutionary stages in the
eukaryotic lineages leading to hominids and found several
over-represented functional classes in the different duplication events. Finally, we explored an alternative, fully automated algorithm to infer orthology relationships from
phylogenetic trees that does not require a fully resolved species phylogeny and, therefore, is less sensitive to topological
variations. The choice for this novel methodology for orthology prediction is based on the fact that alternative tree reconciliation methods have difficulties in accounting for inherent
phylogenetic noise, divergences in evolutionary histories for
different genes and the low resolution level of available species trees. As will be shown below, the high degree of topological variation found in the human phylome for all scenarios
considered also supports the choice of alternatives to classic
tree reconciliation methods. All in all, the results presented
here constitute a preliminary but broad overview of the evolutionary history of the human genome, which is not taken as
an average or represented by a limited number of genes, but
instead is regarded as a complex mosaic of thousands of individual phylogenies.

Results and discussion
Phylome scope and phylogenetic pipeline
The human phylome presented here is derived from the proteins encoded by 39 publicly available eukaryotic genomes
(Table 1). This set is particularly rich in metazoan species (19
species, 50%), including 14 chordates, 3 arthropods and 2
nematodes. The second largest group is that of fungi, comprising 11 species and thus making a total of 30 opisthokons.
The remaining group includes eight species from diverse
phyla, among which are one amoebozoan (Dictyostellum discoideum), two plants (Arabiopsis thaliana and
Chlamydomonas reinhardti), two apicomplexans (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium briggsae), and three excavates (the diplomonad Guillardia theta and the
kinetoplastids Leishmania major and Paramecium tetraurelia). This distribution of species makes our set especially suitable for addressing the evolution of protein families among
the opisthokonts. It covers, therefore, a period that is rich in
important evolutionary innovations, from the origin of apoptotic pathways [16] to the emergence of complex communication patterns [17].
To derive a phylome from the abovementioned proteome
database we applied a phylogenetic pipeline to each human
protein. This fully automated pipeline (described in more
detail in the Materials and methods section) emulates the
manual workflow used by phylogeneticists: from sequence,
through alignment, to phylogenetic reconstruction. It starts
with a sequence search against the proteome database to
retrieve groups of significantly similar proteins that are then
aligned. Alignments are automatically trimmed to remove
gap-rich
regions.

Firstly, a NJ tree is constructed with BioNJ [18], and secondly, this NJ tree is used as a seed in a ML analysis using
PhyML [19]. In the ML analysis, up to five different evolutionary models were tested for each tree (see below) using a discrete gamma-distribution model with four rate categories

used as a seed tree to perform a ML likelihood analysis as implemented in PhyML, using four different evolutionary models (five in the case of
mitochondrially encoded proteins). The ML tree with the maximum likelihood is further refined with a Bayesian analysis using MrBayes. Finally, different
algorithms are used to search for specific topologies in the phylome or to define orthology and paralogy relationships.

Evolutionary model selection

refereed research

A phylome represents a broader, yet more complex to interpret, reconstruction of the evolution of an organism, since it
comprises the phylogenies of all its genes. Most notably, the
availability of a phylome opens the possibility for studying the
relationships among species in a different way: that of quantifying the fraction of individual phylogenies whose topologies are consistent with a given hypothesis. Here we explored
this methodology by specifically contrasting a number of
evolutionary relationships that are controversial to some
extent. We chose three different scenarios for which there is
some level of controversy in the literature and that involve
three different depths of the eukaryotic tree (Figure 2).
Namely, the relative positions of nematodes, chordates and
arthropods, the relationships among rodents, primates and
laurasatherians, and, lastly, the grouping of opisthokonts
with amoebozoans. To scan for phylogenies compatible with
the different hypotheses, we adapted a previously described
algorithm [9] (see also Materials and methods).

information

Perhaps one of the most debated issues regarding the tree of
eukaryotes is the relative position of arthropods, nematodes
and chordates. Traditionally, comparative anatomy placed
arthropods and chordates in the coelomata clade, which contained animals with a true body cavity, while pseudocoelomates such as nematodes occupied a more basal position.
However, phylogenetic analyses of 18S and 28S rRNAs supported an alternative view that grouped nematodes and
arthropods, dubbed ecdysozoa, to the exclusion of chordates
[35]. Since then, numerous multi-gene phylogenetic studies
that support either of the hypotheses have been published
(see, among others, [36-39]).

interactions

To assess whether a tree produced by the NJ approach has
sufficient predictive value for the model selection step, we
compared the model chosen by the full ML approach (that is,
reconstructing a ML phylogeny for every model) to the model
selected when the likelihood of the seed NJ tree was assessed
under different models, allowing for branch-length optimization. In 86.7% of the cases the model chosen by both methods
was the same. This confirms and extends earlier results [23]
and, more importantly, suggests that the pipeline can be simplified by basing the model selection on the tree produced by
BioNJ.

Recent advances in resolving the tree of eukaryotes are converging into a model that comprises a few large super-groups
[31]. Despite the general agreement on the classification of
these major groups, several relationships, both among and
within the different groups, remain controversial. In recent
years, a number of large-scale approaches have been developed that combine the information obtained from several
genes to resolve evolutionary relationships. Among these, the
construction of super-trees and trees based on concatenated
alignments are among the most widely used [32]. These trees
are useful in that they constitute a straightforward way of visualizing the combined phylogenetic signal of genes that are
widespread in the species considered. However, it has been
claimed that these trees are representative of only a small
fraction of the genes encoded in a given genome, and that
gene-sampling effects might lead to biased results supporting
a specific species phylogeny [33,34].

reports

Among the models tested, JTT was chosen as the best fitting
model in a majority of the trees (14,683, 68.0%), followed by
WAG (6,388, 29.6%), Blosum62 (461, 2.1%) and VT (26,
0.1%). MtREV was chosen as the best model in ten out of the
thirteen mitochondrial-encoded human proteins. Surprisingly, the phylogenies of subunit 6 of NADH dehydrogenase
and subunits 1 and 2 of cytochrome oxidase were best fitted
by JTT, Blosum62 and WAG models, respectively.

reviews

Both ML and Bayesian analyses are model-based approaches
that can provide divergent results when different evolutionary models are assumed. Several authors have shown that the
use of an appropriate model is crucial for the reconstruction
of correct phylogenies and that the origin of the sequences
involved (that is, the range of organisms involved) is not
always a good predictor of the most appropriate model
[23,24]. Applying a wrong evolutionary model to a given dataset might even lead to the reconstruction of wrong phylogenies with a high support [25]. To avoid such pitfalls, we tested
using the ML approach several models that are complementary in their scope, namely: JTT [26], a general model for
globular, nuclear-encoded proteins; BLOSUM62 [27],
inferred from protein blocks of 62% sequence identity; WAG,
derived from a database of globular proteins with a broad
range of evolutionary distances [28]; and VT, based on amino
acid replacement rates suited for distantly related sequences
[29]. Additionally, phylogenies of the proteins encoded in the
mitochondrial genome were also reconstructed using mtREV,
a model that has been specifically designed for this kind of
data [30]. In all cases, a discrete gamma-distribution model
with four rate categories plus invariant positions was used.
The gamma parameter and the fraction of invariant positions
were estimated from the data.

Among the most difficult problems in the evolution of eukaryotes is resolving the relative branching order of the major
eukaryotic groups. The evolutionary distances and the level of
sequence divergence involved results in a star-like tree with
the major eukaryotic groups branching out in a poorly
defined order. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses have been
used to cluster some of the groups. One such case is the union
of amoebozoans and opisthokonts, dubbed the unikonts [47].
Evidence supporting this group comes from phylogenies
based on concatenated alignments of up to 149 genes [39] as
well as from morphological data. However, this grouping is
still not widely accepted among systematicists. In the present
analysis a single amoebozoan genome, that of Dictyostellum
discoideum, has been included, together with representatives
from three other major groups, including excavates (L.
major, P. tetraurelia, G. thetha), plants (A. thaliana, C. reinardthii) and chromoalveolates (P. falciparum, P. yoelii). We
scanned the phylome for trees supporting the grouping of
opisthokonts with each of the other major groups, provided
that at least four of the five major groups were represented in
the tree (Figure 2). Of the 165 trees in the human phylome
including at least four of the five major groups, 64 (39.5%)
supported the Unikont hypothesis. The alternative hypotheses of opisthokots being monophyletic with either plants,
chromoalveolates or excavates are supported by 58 (35.8%),
31 (19.1%) and 9 (5.6%) trees, respectively. However, differences between the Unikont and the alternative hypotheses are

The phylogenetic relationship among placental mammals has
attracted great interest in recent years [41]. A still open question is the relative grouping and branching order of the
groups rodentia, primates, lagomorpha, artyodactyla and carnivora. Four of these groups are represented in the present
phylome, namely primates (human, chimpanzee and
macaque), artyodactyla (cow), carnivora (dog) and rodents
(rat and mouse). While the monophily of artyodactyla and
carnivores, both belonging to laurasatheria, is largely undisputed, the crucial question is whether rodents have a basal

rodents, although the difference with the alternative hypothesis of a clade grouping rodents and primates is not great

show a topology in which rodents are basal, compared to
4,859 (32.6%) and 3,435 (23.1%) trees in which rodents are
monophyletic with primates and laurasatheria, respectively.
As in the case of arthropods, nematodes and chordates, all
possible topologies are fairly represented. Here too, differences in the relative evolutionary rates, and the possible longbranch attraction effect, might have an effect on the high proportion of trees showing rodents at a basal position, since
rodent sequences have been shown to have the highest rates
of substitutions when compared with primates and artiodactyls [45,46].

position relative to the other groups or whether they join primates on a common node. Analyses of concatenated alignments from nuclear genes are consistent with the rodents
being a basal group and primates being monophyletic with
laurasatheria [42,43]. However, phylogenies based on mitochondrial genes as well as the common presence of several
mutational events and the insertion of MLTA0 elements support the clustering of primates and rodents to the exclusion of
laurasatheria [41,44].

reviews

The finding that all three possible topologies, including the
one widely considered as wrong in the literature, are supported by a significant number of trees illustrates the inherent difficulty of resolving the species phylogeny from gene
phylogenies. We have found similar topological diversity in
the three scenarios considered (see below) and also, to
smaller degrees, in apparently undisputed evolutionary relationships (results not shown). Similar results showing variability in the relative positions of arthropods, nematodes and
chordates have also been found in topological analyses of the
phylogenies of 507 eukaryotic orthologous groups [38] and of
100 protein families [40]. These deviances from the species
phylogeny might be the result of different processes, including convergent evolution or varying evolutionary rates. In the
case of the Ecdysozoa and Coelomata hypotheses, the accelerated rate of evolution in the nematode sequences has been
proposed as the main cause preventing the acceptance of the
Ecdysozoa hypothesis. For instance, some studies have
shown that when fast evolving genes are removed from the
dataset, the ecdysozoa group is accepted with high confidence
[36,39]. Therefore, the relative abundance of the different
topologies should be considered with caution, since differences in evolutionary rates, if they are widespread, could
result in a majority of the gene trees supporting a wrong species phylogeny.

dates, respectively. The relative fraction of trees supporting
each topology is similar if we consider only the 5,230 trees
with the highest topology support (posterior probabilities
higher than 0.9 in the nodes grouping the considered taxa
(Figure 2). Since the algorithm treats each gene individually,
a certain level of redundancy exists because protein families
with many members in the human genome contribute more
trees to the phylome. These would affect the topological analysis if there are great differences in the distribution of family
sizes supporting each topology. To correct for this redundancy we grouped the individual gene-trees into families if
their seed sequences appeared together in a tree. Then each
family was considered to support a single topology. If more
than a single topology was supported, the one supported by a
majority of members was chosen. As shown in Figure 2 (bottom row), the percentage of families supporting each topology is similar to the results obtained when genes are treated
individually.

assume a high number of smaller scale duplications that
affected more than 50% of the genes. These duplication
events would have accumulated over the period of time
extending from the split of fungi and metazoans to the split of
chordates and other metazoans.

Lineage-specific gene duplication

Also remarkable is the relatively high duplication rates found
in the lineages leading to mammals, primates and hominids.
This suggests that duplications have played a major role in the
evolution of these groups, something that has already been
noted from comparisons of primate genomes [55].

During the course of evolution, gene families can increase
their size through events of gene duplication [48]. These
events may correspond to massive duplications affecting
many genes in the genome at the same time, such as in whole
genome duplications (WGDs) or may be restricted to chromosomal segments or specific genes. The idea that gene duplication has played a major role in evolution, acting as a source
for novel functions, was originally developed by Ohno [49].
Accumulating evidence now supports this idea. Not only
recent genomics surveys have provided evidence for the
abundance of duplicated genes in all organisms [50], but it
has also been observed that gene duplication is often associated with processes of neo-functionalization and/or subfunctionalization [51].
To quantify the extent of gene duplication that has occurred
in the lineages leading to human, we scanned the trees to find
duplication events (see Materials and methods) and subsequently mapped them onto a species phylogeny that marks
the major branching points in the lineage leading to hominids
(Figure 3). The relative number of duplication events per gene
at each branching point was estimated by dividing the
number of duplication events detected at that stage by the
number of trees rooted at a deeper branching point; for example, from a tree rooted on a fungal sequence, only duplications
following the split of fungi and metazoans were taken into
account.
The highest peak in gene duplication events corresponds to
the base of chordate evolution, after the split of urochordates
(Ciona intestinalis) and vertebrates. This observation is consistent with previous results supporting the existence of at
least one round, and probably two rounds, of whole genome
duplications before the radiation of vertebrates [52,53],
which could explain the increase in phenotypic complexity of
vertebrates relative to other chordates such as cephalochordates (amphioxus) and urochordates (Ciona). The second
largest peak appears at the base of the metazoans, after their
split with fungi. The relatively large duplication rate (0.58
duplications per tree) at this point could be interpreted as a
result of a WGD at the base of metazoan evolution or, alternatively, an accumulation of smaller scale duplications. To the
best of our knowledge, the possibility of a WGD at the base of
metazoan evolution has not been proposed in the literature
[54] and we believe it deserves some deeper consideration in
future analyses. If the WGD scenario is considered, then an
extensive gene loss should have followed it, since the
duplication rate here is lower than the one found at the base
of vertebrate evolution. The alternative scenario would

Functional trends among duplicated gene sets
The duplication of genes might result in the amplification
and/or diversification of the biological processes in which
they play a role; if this provides a selective advantage, the
duplicated copies will likely be retained. Therefore, inspecting the functions of gene families that have undergone duplication at different evolutionary stages may provide clues
about the processes that played roles in the major transitions
that occurred during those stages. To detect such functional
trends we searched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms that are
significantly over-represented in the set of genes that underwent duplications during the different stages of eukaryotic
evolution. We performed this analysis automatically with the
aid of the program Fatigo+, from the Babelomics suite [56].
At each evolutionary stage (Figure 3) we compared the
annotations of the duplicated human genes with those of the
rest of the human genome. We selected those terms whose
over-representation was significant based on a false discovery
rate test (adjusted p-value < 0.00001). Due to space limitations we represent only a fraction of the over-represented
terms for the category 'biological process' (Figure 3). A complete list of enriched terms in each stage is given in the supplementary material [22]. The present analysis detects overrepresented functional categories among genes duplicated at
different evolutionary periods. It is, therefore, different from
complementary analyses that detect functional shifts and different patterns of amino acid replacement among duplicated
pairs [57,58]. Interestingly, these complementary analyses
also show differences among functional classes.
In most evolutionary stages, we found several terms from different GO levels and categories that are significantly overrepresented. Of these, some are specific to a given evolutionary transition (for example, lipid metabolism in vertebrates),
while others are over-represented in a series of consecutive
stages (for example, small GTPase signaling cascade). Providing links between the over-represented terms and the
functional or morphological transitions characteristic of each
stage is not straightforward. Nevertheless, some terms do
suggest the expansion of some physiological processes at a
given evolutionary time. Terms related to maintenance of
complex cellular structures, such as 'organelle organization
and biogenesis', 'cytoskeleton', 'cellular organization' or
'cellular localization', are over-represented in genes dupli-

The specific association of terms such as 'transmission of
nerve pulse' or 'nervous system development' with families
duplicated just before the vertebrate expansion is consistent
with the development of a complex nervous system as compared to that of simpler chordates. Later on, the expansion of
'sensory perception' and related terms in the lineages leading
to amniota, mammals and primates indicates increasing
sophistication of the senses. Similarly, the term 'epidermis
development' is over-represented in genes duplicated in
tetrapods. This might be related to major skin modifications,
which potentially allowed the conquering of the terrestrial
environment by this group.

Absence of horizontal transfers of eukaryotic genes in
the human lineage
The extent and scope of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
events among organisms has been the subject of intense
debate [59]. The emerging view is that HGT constitutes an
important process of evolution in prokaryotes and that it is
more restricted, if not virtually absent, in eukaryotes. However, as more eukaryotic genomes are being sequenced, the
number of putative cases of gene transfers in eukaryotes is
growing. Reported cases include acquisition of prokaryotic
genes [60-62] and transfers of mitochondrial genes between
plants [63] and between animals [64]. Horizontal gene transfer in the human genome has been addressed in the past. For
instance, after the initial sequencing of the human genome
the claim was made that up to 223 bacterial genes, likely
acquired by HGT, could be found in the human genome [65].
This claim, however, was later rejected on the basis of phylogenetic analysis [66]. The existence of horizontally transferred genes from other eukaryotes in the human genome has
never been reported despite the fact that integrative viral
sequences can migrate between vertebrate species and that
these viruses can sometimes carry genes within their
sequences, making the hypothesis theoretically plausible
[67].
The species represented in our phylome include organisms
that are tightly linked to human, either because they are pathogens (plasmodium and several fungi), or used as a source of
food (cow, yeast). A recent transfer from any of these species
to the human genome could, in principle, be detected as a
human protein being placed in a 'wrong' phylogenetic context. However, caution must be taken when interpreting phylogenies, since such topologies can also be explained by
alternative processes such as multiple gene-loss or lack of
phylogenetic resolution.
To find such putative cases we scanned the human phylome
to detect trees in which the phylogenetic position of the
human seed protein could suggest a possible HGT event. For
this purpose we applied a series of increasingly stringent filters. These filters consisted in identifying trees in which: the
human seed protein has non-primate proteins as nearest phylogenetic neighbors; such topology cannot be explained sim-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R109

ply by the loss of the orthologous sequences in the other
primates or multiple losses in mammalian groups; the partition suggesting the HGT is supported by a high posterior
probability (>0.9) in the Bayesian analysis; and that partition
is also supported by ML analysis. This methodology bears
some similarity to that proposed by Hallet et al. [68] in that it
specifically defines possible scenarios for HGT.
A total of 99 trees (0.47%) passed the first two filters, thus
having a topology that could be explained by an HGT event.
However, only 8 of these trees had a posterior probability
supporting the HGT partition of 0.9 or higher in the Bayesian
analysis, and none of these was supported by the ML analyses, indicating that the partitions suggesting the horizontal
transfer are not strongly supported.
We interpret these results as a lack of evidence supporting the
existence of human genes originating from recent horizontal
transfers from the lineages considered and argue that the
observed HGT-like topologies are rather the result of phylogenetic artifacts. This interpretation is consistent with the
generally adopted view that horizontal gene transfers among
multi-cellular eukaryotes is virtually absent due to the existing natural barriers that prevent transferred genes from
reaching the germ-line [69].

Towards a complete catalogue of orthology and
paralogy relationships
Although an increasing number of genome-wide experimental datasets is becoming available for human, most experimental analyses are performed in model species such as
mouse, fruit fly, yeast and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, for historical or practical reasons, alternative model species are used to investigate specific systems or
pathways. Such is the case with the use of Neurospora crassa,
Yarrowia lipolytica and Bos taurus models in the characterization of the multiprotein enzyme NADH:Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), in which an intricate evolution and
the use of different naming schemas in the various species
complicate the transfer of knowledge among investigators
studying the different model species [70].
Comparative genomics can be used for transferring functional information across species, a process that requires the
establishment of evolutionary relationships among genes
encoded in the different genomes. Such relationships are best
established by means of detecting orthology, rather than just
homology. Orthologs are a special case of homologous genes
that diverged from a common ancestor through speciation
events, in contrast to paralogs, which originate from duplication events [71]. Since orthologs are, relative to paralogs,
more likely to share a common function, the correct determination of orthology has deep implications for the transfer of
functional information across organisms. This is not, however, the only application of orthology determination. For
instance, the establishment of equivalences among genes in

the results show that phylogeny-based orthology detection

We compared our predictions with those from other algorithms by using a recent reference dataset comprising 67
human-mouse and 45 human-worm orthologous pairs from
five multi-gene families [82]. Considering the size of the families and the intricate evolutionary histories involved, this reference set should be considered a highly stringent test. For
each of the methods compared we computed the sensitivity,

which is a measure of the coverage over the reference set, and
the positive predictive value, which is the proportion of correct orthology predictions, that is, the number of true positives over the sum of true positives and false negatives. The
results of the benchmark showed narrow differences in terms
of sensitivity (Figure 4). All methods are able to predict only
about half (40% to 66%) of the orthologous pairs in the reference set. Our method scores second best, with 61.6% sensitivity compared to 66.1% for the clusters of eukaryotic
orthologous genes (KOG) method; Ensembl reaches a coverage of 55.57%. As we noted before, this low coverage reflects
the inherent difficulty of the reference set, in which manual
orthology assignments have taken into account domain
organization analysis and other sources of information.

reports

Considering the high degree of topological diversity observed
in the human phylome (see above), we reasoned that any
algorithm based on reconciliation with a specific species tree
would inevitably infer false duplication events in the trees
showing topologies that depart from the canonical species
tree. Therefore, we decided to explore an alternative, fully
automated approach that does not require a fully resolved
species phylogeny and a reconciliation phase. The algorithm
(see Materials and methods) uses the level of overlap in the
species connected to two related nodes to decide whether
their parental node represents a duplication or speciation
event. The full list of predicted ortology and paralogy relationships is provided as supplementary material [22].

Huerta-Cepas et al. R109.11

reviews

The need for detecting orthology at a genome-scale has triggered the development of a variety of automatic approaches
that identify orthology relationships by means of similarity
searches. The first and still most widely used such method is
based on the detection of best reciprocal hits (BRHs), that is,
pairs of sequences from different species that are, reciprocally, the best hit of each other in a sequence search [73].
Extensions of the BRH approach include the definition of 'triangular' BRH relationships across a minimum of three species [48], and recent implementations thereof, such as Inparanoid [74] or OrthoMCL [75], that include closely related
paralogs in the orthologous groups. Although these methods
perform reasonably well in most cases, they have been shown
to present many drawbacks that can lead to annotation errors
or misinterpretation of data [76,77]. More recently, in an
attempt to approximate the classic, phylogeny-based
approach, several automatic methods have been proposed
that delineate orthology relationships from phylogenetic
trees. Generally, these methods rely on the detection of duplication and speciation events by comparing the gene tree with
the species tree [78]. Several databases have been developed
that employ such algorithms to derive orthology relationships
from automatically reconstructed trees [79-81]. However,
these methods are very sensitive to slight variations in the
topology of the gene tree and, when applied at a large-scale,
they may perform similarly or even worse than standard pairwise methods [82]. Some recent developments that use softparsimony [83] and model-based approaches [84] for treereconciliation allow some level of uncertainty in both the
gene-tree and the species-tree.

Conclusion

We have shown the feasibility of reconstructing complex phylomes, comprising the evolutionary histories of all genes from
a given species and their homologs in dozens of other
genomes. The pipeline and genome sampling is fully automated and can easily be tailored for specific needs, therefore
paving the way for the reconstructions of other phylomes
using different parameters or species sampling. Because of its
significance, we have initially applied this pipeline to the
human genome. The resulting phylome constitutes a valuable
dataset that can be explored by the research community. In
the near future we are planning to implement this and other
phylomes in a fully searchable database. To illustrate the
potential of the human phylome we have performed several
analyses, but many others can be envisaged. Overall, our
results indicate that there is a great topological diversity
affecting the three unresolved scenarios that we have discussed (ecdysozoa versus coelomata, relationships among
rodents, primates and laurasatheria and the unikont hypothesis). This and other recent findings [85] reinforce the older
view [86] that topological differences among phylogenies of
proteins are to be expected even in the absence of HGT and
underscore the danger of gene-sampling effects when combining the phylogenetic signals of several genes [34]. We
share the view of others [87] that there is an urgent need for
improved models of molecular evolution that account for the
inherent phylogenetic noise in the protein record and of new
genomic characters that are less prone to homoplastic effects.
We have found that such noise may eventually produce HGTlike topologies, highlighting the need for stringent cut-offs
and alternative tests before an HGT event is assumed.
Mapping speciation and duplication events on the complete
phylome has allowed us to derive a comprehensive set of
orthology and paralogy relationships among the genomes
involved. The results obtained in the benchmark analysis
show that although automatic methods for phylogeny-based
detection of orthology are progressing in the right direction,
there is still room for improvement both in the algorithms
and the quality of the trees. Taking into account the levels of
topological diversity mentioned above, it follows that the
algorithms for phylogeny-based orthology detection need to
cope with levels of topological uncertainty.
The results obtained in the present analysis are consistent
with the existence of at least one round of whole genome
duplication occurring before the radiation of verebrates [49].
If a relatively high level of gene loss in eukaryotic genomes is
assumed [88], the finding of an average level of duplication

Proteomes derived from 39 fully sequenced eukaryotic
genomes (Table 1) were downloaded from Ensembl v36 [12]
and the Integr8 database at EBI [89], except those of Candida
albicans [90]N. crassa [91] and C. reinhardtii [92]. Wherever mitochondrial proteins were not included in the gene set
per species, these were downloaded separately from the NCBI
eukaryotic organelles site. Mitochondrial genomes from
Caenorhabditis briggsae, Giberella zeae, Debaromyces
hansenii and Leishmania major have apparently not been
deposited in the public databases and, therefore, are missing
from this study. The final proteome database contains
542,423 unique protein sequences from 39 different genomes
(Table 1).

Database searches
For each human protein a Smith-Waterman [93] search was
performed against the above-mentioned proteome database
to retrieve a set of proteins with a significant similarity (Evalue < 10-3). Only sequences that aligned with a continuous
region longer than 50% of the query sequence were selected.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic
reconstructions
Sets of homologous protein sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE 3.6 [94]. Positions in the alignment with gaps in
more than 10% of the sequences were eliminated before the
phylogenetic analysis, unless this procedure removed more
than one-third of the positions in the alignment. In such cases
the percentage of sequences with gaps allowed was automatically increased until at least two-thirds of the initial positions
were conserved.
NJ trees were derived using scoredist distances as implemented in BioNJ [18]. ML trees were derived from the alignments using PhyML v2.4.4 [19]. For each protein family ML
trees were reconstructed with four different evolutionary
models (JTT, WAG, BLOSUM62 and VT), except for the 13
mitochondrially encoded proteins in which the mtREV model
was also used. In all cases a discrete gamma-distribution
model with four rate categories plus invariant positions was
used, the gamma parameter and the fraction of invariant
positions were estimated from the data. The evolutionary
model best fitting the data was determined by comparing the
likelihood of the used models according to the AIC criterion
[20].
To obtain support values of all tree partitions, the ML tree
produced by the best-fitting model was used as a seed for a
Bayesian analysis by running Mr Bayes [21] for 100,000 gen-

The duplication events detected by the algorithm described
above can be assigned to different evolutionary periods by
examining the species represented after the duplication
event. To do so we used as a reference a set of clearly defined
phylogenetic relationships that mark the major branching
points in the lineage leading to hominids (Figure 3). For each
duplication event, all the species represented after the duplication node are tracked and the duplication is assigned to the
deepest branching point in the reference tree that contains all
these species. For instance, if only sequences from mammals
and fishes are found after the duplication event, this duplication is assigned to the branching point that is at the base of
vertebrates.
The orthology detection algorithm can detect only duplications that occurred after the root of the tree; for example, if a
tree is rooted in a fungal sequence, only duplications that
occurred in the metazoan lineage could be detected. Therefore, to compare the results obtained at the different evolutionary stages we computed the relative number of
duplication events per gene at each branching point. This was
done by dividing the number of duplication events mapped at
a particular evolutionary stage by the number of trees rooted
at a deeper branching point; for example, duplications that
occurred at the base of metazoans were divided by the
number of trees rooted on either a fungal or a nonopisthokont sequence.

The algorithm used here to search for specific topologies
within the phylome is described elsewhere [9]. In brief, from
an un-rooted tree the algorithm generates all possible partitions that contain the seed sequence. That is, the algorithm
proceeds sequentially throughout all internal edges of the
tree. At each internal edge it generates two partitions, of
which only one contains the seed sequence. The species represented in each such partition are tracked and those trees
with a partition fulfilling a set of rules defined by the user are
selected. The set of rules defined by the user are defined as a
set of species that are allowed in a partition, and rules can be
combined so that specific evolutionary scenarios are defined.

refereed research

To map duplication and speciation events on an internal node
of the tree, the algorithm proceeds as follows. First, two tree
partitions are defined that contain the sequences connected
to each of the two children nodes. Second, a species-overlap
score is defined between the two partitions as follows: species
common to both partitions/species in any of the partitions.
Third, if the score is higher than a given threshold the node is
mapped as a duplication event, otherwise it is considered a
speciation event. In the present study the species-overlap
threshold was set to 0.0 - that is, no common species between
the two partitions were allowed - because this produced the
best results in the benchmark. The algorithm does so for all
internal nodes in the tree. Once all the nodes in the tree are
marked as a duplication or speciation event, the algorithm
establishes orthology relationships between the seed protein
and other proteins in the tree. For each protein, the algorithm
tracks the nodes that connect it to the seed protein and establishes an orthology relationship only if this connection proceeds exclusively through speciation nodes, disregarding

Assigning duplications to different evolutionary periods

deposited research

We used a phylogeny-based algorithm to detect duplication
and speciation events on the trees. In contrast to alternative
phylogeny-based methods that use reconciliation of the gene
tree with the species tree to infer duplication events, our
approach does not require any previous fully resolved species
topology. The only evolutionary information required is that
used to root the trees to define a polarity so each internal node
is connected to two children nodes. The orthology prediction
algorithm was run independently for each human gene using
the tree generated using its protein sequence as a seed. The
algorithm was implemented in a series of python scripts specifically developed for this project.

To root the trees the following procedure was used. The species present in the tree were grouped according to the branching pattern of the tree in Figure 3; thus, non-opisthokont
species constitute the deepest group, followed by 'fungi',
'other metazoans', 'urochordates', and so on. Among the
sequences belonging to the deepest group with representatives in the tree, the one with the longest distance to the seed
protein was chosen as the out-group.

Inference of duplication and speciation events and
orthology assignment using a novel algorithm
independent of species-tree reconciliation

intra-specific duplications. After mapping speciation and
duplication nodes onto the phylogeny, several situations may
arise in which orthology relationships are not one-to-one
relationships, but rather one-to-many or many-to-many.

reviews

A final tree produced by this Bayesian reconstruction consists
of a consensus phylogeny, using the 'halfcompat' option in
MrBayes, in which partitions with a posterior probability
lower than 0.5 are collapsed. The alignments and all trees
produced for each human protein are made available as supplemental information [22]. Unless stated otherwise the consensus tree produced by MrBayes analysis was used in all
analyses.

erations in two runs of two chains each, using the best-fitting
model, as determined in the ML analysis, but allowing branch
swapping and re-estimation of the gamma distribution
parameters. The posterior probability of each tree partition
was estimated by sampling the trees every 100 generations
after discarding the first 25%. This approach to obtain support values was faster than performing standard bootstrap
analysis with PhyML. Starting the MrBayes runs with an
already optimized tree resulted in fair levels of convergence
being reached after fewer generations than in standard
MrBayes analyses.

For instance, a partition supporting the grouping of rodents
and primates to the exclusion of laurasatherians can be
defined as a partition containing any sequence (s) from primates (Homo sapiens, Macacca mulata, Pan troglodites)
and any sequence (s) from rodents (Mus musculus, Rattus
norvergicus) within a larger partition that contains these
sequence plus any sequence (s) from Laurasatherians (Canis
familiaris, Bos taurus). Sequences from other species are not
allowed in the partition and the presence of the seed sequence
in the partition is required. This algorithm has been implemented in a series of Python scripts developed for this
project.
In the topology scanning analyses presented here we discarded the trees based on alignments in which less than 100
columns were left after applying the gap filter. This procedure
eliminated 1,714 (7.9%) from the total phylome.

Benchmarking
The reference set used in a recent benchmark of orthology
assignment methods [82] is used to compute the number of
true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs) and false negatives
(FNs) yielded by each method. For each method the sensitivity, S = TP/(TP + FN), and the positive predictive value, P =
TP/(TP + FP), were computed.
