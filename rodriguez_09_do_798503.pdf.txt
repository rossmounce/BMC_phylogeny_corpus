Abstract
Background: Phylogenies reconstructed with only one or a few independently inherited loci may be unresolved or
incongruent due to taxon and gene sampling, horizontal gene transfer, or differential selection and lineage sorting at
individual loci. In an effort to remedy this situation, we examined the utility of conserved orthologous set (COSII) nuclear
loci to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among 29 diploid Solanum species in the sister clades that include tomato
and potato, and in Datura inoxia as a far outgroup. We screened 40 COSII markers with intron content over 60% that
are mapped in different chromosomes; selected a subset of 19 by the presence of single band amplification of size mostly
between 600 and 1200 bp; sequenced these 19 COSII markers, and performed phylogenetic analyses with individual and
concatenated datasets. The present study attempts to provide a fully resolved phylogeny among the main clades in potato
and tomato that can help to identify the appropriate markers for future studies using additional species.
Results: Among potatoes, when total evidence is invoked, one single predominant history is highlighted with complete
resolution within and among the three main clades. It also supports the hypothesis of the North and Central American
B-genome origin of the tuber-bearing members of Solanum sect. Petota and shows a clear division between A genomes
in clades 3 and 4, and B genomes in clade 1+2. On the other hand, when a prior agreement approach is invoked other
potato evolutionary histories are revealed but with less support. These alternative histories could be explained by past
hybridization, or fast rates of speciation. In the case of tomato, the analyses with all sequence data completely resolved
19 of 21 clades, for the first time revealed the monophyly of five clades, and gave further support for the recent
segregation of new species from the former Solanum peruvianum. Concordance analyses revealed and summarized the
extensive discordance among COSII markers. Some potential reasons for discordance could be methodological, to
include systematic errors due to using a wrong model of sequence evolution, coupled with long branches, or mixtures
of branch lengths within COSII, or undetected paralogy or alignment bias. Other reasons could be biological processes
such as hybridization or lineage sorting.
Conclusion: This study confirms and quantifies the utility of using DNA sequences from different parts of the genome
in phylogenetic studies to avoid possible bias in the sampling. It shows that 11–18 loci are enough to get the dominant
history in this group of Solanum, but more loci would be needed to discern the distribution of gene genealogies in more
depth, and thus detect which mechanism most likely shaped the discordance.

Background
The basic chromosome number in potatoes (sect. Petota),
tomatoes (sect. Lycopersicum), and the most closely related
outgroups (sects. Etuberosum, Juglandifolium, and Lycopersicoides) is 2n = 2x = 24. Potatoes are alone in the group in
possessing polyploids. Approximately 70% of the over
100 potato species are diploids, with most of the rest tetraploids (2n = 4x = 48) and hexaploids (2n = 6x = 72), with
rare triploids and pentaploids [1].
Potatoes, tomatoes, and outgroups are characterized by
relatively small chromosomes. Karyotypic and genomic
analyses have included crossability success of interspecific
combinations, hybrid sterility, hybrid viability, pollen fertility and in the degree of chromosomal homology [2-9].
Chromosome pairing relationships in interspecific
hybrids and in polyploid potato species have been interpreted by genome formulae, although authors gave them
different symbols. According to these hypotheses, five
genomes (A, B, C, D and P) are recognized in the tuberbearing species of section Petota. Genome symbol E was
given to species of section Etuberosum based on the specificity of meiotic behavior and sterility of their diploid
hybrids with the A-genome tuber-bearing potato species
[7,10]. Symbol L was proposed for tomato (section Lycopersicon) on the bases of preferential chromosome pairing
and clear-cut parental genome discrimination by using
genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and LLEE or artificial amphidiploids of tomato and S. etuberosum [11].
Wild and cultivated potatoes (Solanum L. sect. Petota) (see
Additional file 1 for authors of taxa) grow from the southwestern United States to southern Chile. Hawkes [5] recognized 232 species in section Petota, and divided it into
19 tuber-bearing and two non-tuber-bearing series. He
further divided these 19 tuber-bearing series into two
superseries based on corolla morphology (superseries
Stellata with stellate corollas and superseries Rotata with
rotate corollas). He distinguished "primitive" and
"advanced" forms of each superseries and recognized four
groups based on morphological characters: primitive Stellata, advanced Stellata, primitive Rotata, and advanced
Rotata. He hypothesized the evolution of the advanced
Rotata morphology from primitive Stellata-like ancestors.
He postulated that the ancestral wild potato species were
diploid, possessed B genomes, produced white stellate
corollas, and originated in North or Central America in
the late Cretaceous to Eocene eras. Subsequent dispersal
of one or more of these species to South America took
place before the sinking of the Central American land
bridge during the mid-Eocene to Pliocene eras, gradually
leading to the evolution of species with A genomes and
rotate corollas. He also postulated that when the bridge
was restored in Pliocene times, a remigration of one or
more of these diverged A genome species back into North

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

and Central America allowed the hybridization and allopolyploidization with the native Mexican or Central
American B genome taxa. This produced the tetraploid
members of series Longipedicellata (AB). A second, comparatively recent migration of a second species (S. verrucosum, A genome) from South America formed the Demissa
hexaploids (A1A4 [B,C,D]) [5] by crossing with series Longipedicellata tetraploids and possibly other series. In North
and Central America are also another group of allopolyploids, members of series Conicibaccata (AC), but only
series Longipedicellata was designated AB, and the source
of the C and D genome donors of series Conicibaccata and
Demissa is unknown. However, recent molecular clock
data indicated that eggplant and tomato/potato shared a
common ancestor approximately 14 MYA and potato and
tomato 7 MYA [12]. So it seems unlikely that the timing
for the events proposed by Hawkes really took place in the
Cretaceous – Eocene eras but the events are still possible.
The latest taxonomic interpretation [13] recognized fewer
species (190) and predicted even further reductions in
species. Spooner et al. [14] used plastid DNA restriction
site data and morphological data to reinvestigate the relationships of potatoes, tomatoes (former genus Lycopersicon), farther outgroups in Solanum, and other genera of
the Solanaceae. Their results confirmed placement of all
members of Hawkes's [5] tuber-bearing species into sect.
Petota (90% bootstrap), but the non-tuber-bearing species
were shown to be outgroups although with very low support (68%). Yet other plastid DNA restriction site marker
data and DNA sequence data from plastids and singlecopy nuclear DNA supported these relationships [15-18].
Subsequent plastid DNA phylogenies documented section Petota (tuber-bearing) to be divided into four clades
that often showed little relationship to Hawkes's taxonomic series (Figure 1) [19-21]. These clades contain: 1)
North and Central American diploid species, with the
exception of S. bulbocastanum, S. cardiophyllum, and S. verrucosum; 2) S. bulbocastanum, and S. cardiophyllum; 3) all
examined members of series Piurana and some South
American species belonging to other series (S. andreanum,
S. chancayense, S. immite, S. mochiquense of ser. Tuberosa; S.
chomatophilum, S. colombianum, S. solisii, S. tundalomense of
ser. Conicibaccata; S. huancabambense of ser. Yungasensia; S.
sogarandinum of ser. Megistacroloba); 4) all remaining
South American species, S. verrucosum from Mexico, and
North and Central American polyploid species. Only two
clades were highly supported, clade 1 (100%) and clade 2
(88%), these clades contained all species with B genome,
but they did not resolve together and the monophyly of
the B genome was not supported. Clades 3 and 4 were
poorly supported (54 and 67% bootstrap respectively),
but their sister relationship was highly supported (96%).

waxy) [22] and nuclear nitrate reductase gene data (NIA)
[23] recovered the same four clades except united clades 1
and 2 as a single clade (72% in waxy and 92% in NIA), the
nuclear phylogenies recognized the monophyly of B
genome species (clade 1+2), and supported allopolyploid
origins for some of the polyploids with species from different clades. The main difference between the two
nuclear phylogenies was the relationship among main
clades; in NIA clade 1+2 and 3 were sister in the most parsimonious tree although with very low support (≤51%),
and waxy could not show any close relationships among
the clades.
Taxonomic interpretations in tomato (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon) differed widely depending upon whether morphological or biological species concepts were used [24].
Rick et al. [25] recognized nine species of tomatoes, based
mainly by their ability to intercross, and divided them
into two crossing groups. Peralta et al. [24] summarized
morphological studies of tomatoes [18,26-30], increased
the traditional nine species of Rick et al. [25] to 13 species,
and recognized tomatoes within Solanum. Tomato has
two endemic species in the Galápagos Islands, and weedy
escaped forms of S. lycopersicum are distributed worldwide. The remaining species and immediate tomato outgroup sections Juglandifolia (two species) and
Lycopersicoides (two species) are endemic to western South
America from Ecuador to northern Chile.
Peralta et al. [24] interpreted the many and sometimes
conflicting morphological and molecular data sets to rec-

ognize four informal "species groups" within sect. Lycopersicon: the "Lycopersicon species group" including the four
red to orange colored fruited species S. cheesmaniae, S.
galapagense, S. lycopersicum, and S. pimpinellifolium; the
"Neolycopersicon species group" containing only S. pennellii, the "Eriopersicon species group" containing S.
chilense, S. corneliomulleri, S. habrochaites, S. huaylasense, S.
peruvianum and, the "Arcanum species group" including S.
arcanum, S. chmielewskii, and S. neorickii. They recognized
sect. Juglandifolia as the sister group to sect. Lycopersicon.
In the past, comparative anatomy, cytogenetics, ecology
and morphology had been used to infer phylogenetic relationships among taxa. Lately, with the development of
molecular techniques, many fragments of the genome
have been used in phylogenetic inference and multiple
data sets have become available. As a result, phylogenetic
studies now usually involve data sets from different gene
regions, or different marker systems, or molecular and
morphological data sets. There has been an active and
controversial debate over the best ways to derive a phylogeny that incorporates all existing data. There are three different traditional approaches that have been used to
analyze data from different sources: taxonomic congruence, character congruence and the prior agreement
approach. They all seek to maximize evidence, the first
one from the relationships (cladograms) using the summaries of data as evidence, and the other two derived
directly from characters using data observation as evidence [31].

Proponents of the consensus approach argue that partitions should not be combined before estimating the phylogenetic tree; rather, the trees should be estimated
separately from each partition and combined using taxonomic congruence [32]. The decision to keep data sets
separate generally reflects a hypothesis that either 1) different evolutionary processes are acting on different data
sets, or 2) different data sets reflect different evolutionary
histories [33].
Character congruence, also known as the total evidence
approach, involves all the data available for a group of terminal taxa. The goal is to seek a single, best-fitting hypothesis, which in cladistics involves maximizing character
congruence [31]. The prior agreement approach or "conditional combination" tests for character incongruence
before analysis, and only combines the data when no significant character incongruence exists between partitions.
Farris et al. [34] proposed the Incongruence Length Difference (ILD) test that many researchers use to assess
whether or not data sets should be combined. The idea is
to determine if there is more incongruence between data
sets than is expected between similarly sized random partitions of a homogeneous data set.
Baum [35] proposed that the identification of the primary
concordance tree (PCT) could be a valuable summary of
the dominant phylogenetic history among a group of
organisms. The PCT is composed of clades with higher
concordance factors (CF, proportion of the genome for
which a given clade is true) than any contradictory clade.
Ané et al. [36] developed a Bayesian-based methodology
that estimates the distribution of evolutionary histories
within a multi-gene data set and summarizes the results
allowing genealogical information from one gene to
influence our estimates of another gene's genealogy. It
also allows the identification of genes with outlier genetree topologies that permits estimation of the proportion
of the genome that was transferred during a possible
introgression event. Baum [35] pointed out the possible
outcomes that can arise if reticulation events had happened during the evolutionary history of a group of organisms. If a single event of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
had occurred, one primary history and one minor history
are expected. Under lineage sorting or introgression, one
primary history and co-minor histories are expected. But,
if hybridization occurs two co-primary histories are
expected. Thus, the concordance approach is considered a
modified consensus tree method that allows the identification of different phylogenetic histories in the face of
reticulation, where estimated CFs are metrics that give an
indirect measure of reticulation. Furthermore, it can be
assumed that high CFs provide evidence that relationships
among the organisms under study have been mostly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

divergent, and that low CFs are indicative of reticulate
evolution. Baum [35] stressed that the acquisition of a
divergence structure increases gradually as a result of gene
lineage extinction in reproductively isolated populations
or demes. Thus, the speciation process reaches its ultimate
point when a CF of 1 is reached. Finally, he stated that a
clade which has a CF that is greater than all contradictory
clades has some genealogical unity that indicates a history
of genetic isolation and suggested that this clade can be
formally named.
Recently, single- to low-copy nuclear DNA markers have
been explored for phylogenetic reconstruction. Here we
test a specific subset of these markers called conserved
ortholog set II (COSII) markers in the sister clades potato
and tomato [37]. Orthologs are genes sharing a common
ancestor by descent, in contrast to paralogs that are duplicated copies within a genome through polyploidization
or tandem duplications [38,39].
The purpose of our study is to test a diverse range of COSII
markers and data analyses for phylogenetic reconstruction
in the sister clades tomato and potato. The phylogenetic
relationships between and among species from these two
groups have been the subject of study by many researchers, but these relationships remain unresolved because of
the use of a limited number of molecular markers. Our
study was greatly aided by COSII conversion into a set of
consensus PCR primers that amplify these orthologues in
the Solanaceae, referred to as universal primers for euasterid I (UPA) [37]. UPAs are designed to amplify either
intronic regions (iUPA primers) that provide the polymorphism needed for the proposed tomato and potato
study, or exonic regions (eUPA primers) that are more
appropriate for comparisons of more distantly related
species. Our study uses many more molecular markers
than prior phylogenetic studies in the tomato and potato
clades. It does not attempt to provide a definitive study of
the evolutionary relationships within these clades, but
rather to identify appropriate markers for future studies
that should incorporate a wider species sampling. Our
approach consists of examining 1) diverse markers on all
12 linkage groups, 2) amplification of a single band (in
diploids) of representative taxa, 3) markers with length
between 600–1200 bp that amplify with single pass
sequencing, and 4) markers with over 60% intron content
appropriate for this taxonomic level of closely related species.

Results
Allelic variation and sequence alignment
Of the 30 species analyzed, four tomato species had two
alleles: S. chilense and S. huaylasense in COS5c and
COS13b, S. peruvianum and S. habrochaites in COS7b, S.
huaylasense in COS10b, S. peruvianum in COSX2 and

COS11b, S. chilense in COS1b; S. chilense, S. peruvianum
and S. habrochaites in COS8b, and S. chilense, S. peruvianum and S. huaylasense in COS15b (16 cases in total). In
four of these 16 cases alleles from the same species form a
clade; in four cases alleles formed polytomies; and in eight
cases alleles from the same species formed a clade with
another species [40].
Complete sequences (total missing data less than 0.3%)
were generated for the 19 COSII. In general, the farthest
outgroups, Datura inoxia and S. dulcamara, showed the
longest sequence and the tomato species and their closest
outgroups showed more gaps in aligned sequences in
comparison with potato [40].
Model selection
In general, likelihood models that account for rate variation, allowing for gamma-distributed rate variation
among sites (Γ), resulted in the greatest increase in Maximum Likelihood (ML). In more than 90% of the cases the
HKY model that includes five parameters best fitted the
data [40]. In cases where the two criteria for selection
chose different models, the model that is implemented in
Mr. Bayes was preferred.
Phylogenetic analysis of individual loci
Analysis of individual COSII sometimes showed incongruent results. To illustrate this we discuss our data using
maximum parsimony analysis in potato and direct the
reader to [40] for details in the tomato and complete data
sets and with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. In the potato data set the number of parsimony
informative sites per individual COSII varied from 13 to
64; in tomato, from 20 to 286; and for the potato and
tomato data set from 46 to 317. All data sets showed high
consistency, retention and rescaled consistency indices,
with consistency indices ranging from 0.753 to 1.000, and
rescaled consistency indices ranging from 0.612 to 1.000.
There was a moderate level of homoplasy (calculated by H
= 1-CI) with less than 25% for all loci.

In the potato data set seven of the 12 COSII sequenced
supported the three main potato clades as a monophyletic
group. In eight of the 12 COSII clade 1+2 (S. bulbocastanum, S. polyadenium, S. stenophyllidium, S. trifidum) was
monophyletic with bootstrap support over 54%; in three
of the 12 COSII, clade 1+2 failed to resolve into a distinct
clade; one COSII placed S. polyadenium outside of clade
1+2. When we forced the monophyly of clade 1+2 for this
COSII, the shortest tree was ten steps longer than the
unconstrained tree, which was significant by the Templeton Test (p = 0.0016–0.0075) and the monophyly of this
clade was rejected [40].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

Clade 3 (S. albornozii, S. andreanum) had bootstrap support more than 50% in nine of the 12 COSII; one COSII
failed to group these species in their own clade, and two
COSII grouped one of the two species in clade 4. Forcing
these species to be monophyletic resulted in trees only
three and two steps longer than the unconstrained tree,
and the Templeton test failed to reject their monophyly (p
= 0.3657 and p = 1). Thus, stochastic noise alone can
explain the misplacement of these species.
Clade 4 (S. brevicaule, S. raphanifolium, S. verrucosum) had
bootstrap support more than 59% in ten of the 12 COSII;
in the remaining two COSII S. raphanifolium did not form
a clade with the other two species, and trees forcing all
three species to group together were only one and three
steps longer than the Maximum Parsimony (MP) unconstrained tree. The Templeton test failed to reject their
monophyly and revealed that the entire clade 4 became
unresolved in trees that were one and three steps longer
than the MP tree. This indicates that the observed nonmonophyly is not significant (p = 0.8635 and p = 0.0833–
0.3173 respectively) [40].
Regarding the relationships among the three main clades,
four of the 12 COSII supported clade 1+2 as sister to the
rest of potatoes, with bootstrap support ranging from 59–
100%. Three COSII placed clade 3 as sister to the rest of
potatoes and only two of these three COSII gave bootstrap
support of 69% and 90%. Two COSII placed clade 4 as sister to the rest of potatoes with a bootstrap support of 60%
and 100% respectively. The remaining three COSII did
not support any of the three basal relationship alternatives in their most parsimonious trees. Attempts to force
species to follow either of these three possibilities were
not rejected for COS2c, because constrained trees were
only four or five steps longer than the MP unconstrained
tree. In contrast, COS5 could not reject clade 1+2 as sister
to the other potatoes, and COS5c could not reject clade 3
species as sister to the others.
Combined data analyses
We explored three approaches to combine the data: total
evidence, prior agreement, and the consensus approach.
Total evidence, potato data set
We concatenated the 12 COSII of the potato data set into
a data matrix of 10,886 characters, with introns accounting for 85% of the total concatenated length. The concatenated alignment contained 1,219 (11.2%) variable sites,
of which 519 (4.8%) were parsimony informative. Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated sequence using MP,
ML and BI, all yielded a single fully resolved tree with high
bootstrap support and Bayesian posterior probability
(Figure 2a).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

Total evidence, tomato data set
Eighteen COSII were concatenated; the data matrix contained 15,709 characters, 82% of these representing
introns, with the total data set containing 4,022 variable
sites of which 1,910 (12.2%) were parsimony informative. MP, ML and BI supported at least the same 18 of 21
nodes as completely resolved with very high bootstrap
values (MP: 90–100%, ML: 99–100%) and posterior
probability (PP = 1) (Figure 3). Two nodes were not very
well supported in MP, ML and BI, one of them was the
placement of the clade formed by S. arcanum-S. chmielews-

a

kii-S. neorickii (51% in MP, < 51 in ML, and 0.55 in BI). In
MP and BI this clade was resolved with the red-orange
tomatoes (S. cheesmaniae, S. galapagense, S. lycopersicoides,
S. pimpinellifolium), and in ML it resolved as sister to a
clade containing the red-orange tomatoes and S. huaylasense. The second unresolved node was the placement of
the clade formed by S. chilense-S. corneliomulleri-S. peruvianum; ML and BI revealed that this clade was closer to the
red-orange tomatoes than the clade formed by S. habrochaites-S. pennellii (73% in ML and 0.80 in BI). On the
other hand, MP showed that S. habrochaites-S. pennellii

was closer to the red-orange clade than the clade S.
chilense-S. corneliomulleri-S. peruvianum (55%). Finally,
MP and ML resolved S. chmielewskii and S. neorickii with
very low support (< 51%). On the other hand, BI resolved
S. arcanum and S. chmielewskii with a posterior probability
of 0.91; the terminal branch that resolved S. arcanum-S.
chmielewskii-S. neorickii had 96%, 99% (bootstrap) and 1
(posterior probability) support in MP, ML and BI respectively.

Total evidence, potato and tomato data set
After the concatenation of 11 COSII, the matrix contained
11,566 characters; 3,006 were variable and 1,799 (15.6%)
were parsimony informative. Bayesian inference showed a
completely resolved phylogeny. On the other hand, both
MP and ML had two nodes with very low support (≤51%):
1) the placement of the clade with S. arcanum, S.
chmielewskii, and S. neorickii, and 2) the node that showed
relationships among these three species. Additionally, in

MP the potato clade had only 57% bootstrap support (Figure 4).
Prior agreement, potato data set
A prior agreement approach combines only congruent
data and excludes data partitions with a significant level of
incongruence, as they can introduce error that can obscure
reliable data and lead to erroneous topologies [41,42]. We
explored the congruence of the different gene phylogenies
in potato using ILD tests. From the 12 original COSII in
potatoes, 66 pairwise comparisons were made with a level
of significance of 0.00076 (= 0.05/66), and nine of them
showed a high level of discordance (p = 0.0006). Three of
these COSII (COS2c, COS5c and COS7b) counted for
eight of these nine discordances (p = 0.0004), and the last
one was between COS11 and COS10b (p = 0.0006).

Through reiterative analyses we proceeded to eliminate
discordant COSII and constructed a set of six COSII that
were highly congruent and produced highly resolved
topologies similar to the entire concatenated data set and
named this "6COScon" (COS 9, COS 9b, COS 11, COS 3,
COS 8 and COS 3c) Rodriguez [40]. MP, ML, and BI of
6COScon gave the same phylogeny as the 12 COSII combined with 100% of bootstrap in all nodes except one that
was supported at 99% (Figure 2b).
We further explored a minimum number of COSII to be
used in a large number of species without losing resolution by further reducing the "6COScon" to three COSII by
choosing the best three by two criteria: 1) length of the
sequence, and 2) number of parsimony informative sites
and called this "3COSa" (COS9, COS9b, COS11). MP,
ML, and Bayesian analyses produced phylogenetic results
almost identical to the 12 COSII set (Figure 2c).
Consensus approach, potato data set
Figure 5 shows the potato primary concordance trees and
Figure 6 shows the concordance factors of all three resolutions for the placement of the main potato clades. With all
three choices of prior (α = 1, 10 and infinite) there was
over 95% confidence that clade 1+2 (CF 10.16 = 85% of
COSII), clade 4 (CF 11 = 92%) and clade 3 (CF 10 = 83%)
formed clades for the majority of COSII. However, each of
the three resolutions for the placement of those clades
received concordance factors below 50% with over 95%
credibility: the discordance among COSII markers was
inferred to be real and strong. With all priors, the credibility intervals for the CF of all three resolutions (Figure 6)
overlapped, therefore, it is still uncertain which placement
is favored by the largest proportion of COSII.
Consensus approach, tomato data set
In the first concordance analysis performed with the
tomato data set, the tomato clade was supported as mono-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

phyletic for almost all COSII in all runs and with all α.
Results from α = 1 and 10 placed sect. Lycopersicoides as the
closest tomato outgroup to the tomato clade with just
50% of COSII supporting this relationship (9.31 and 9.22
COSII respectively); the other 50% of the COSII supported sect. Juglandifolia as the closest tomato outgroup.
On the other hand, for α infinite, which corresponds to
assuming that all gene trees are independent, and no concordance is assumed a priori, sect. Juglandifolia was placed
as the closest tomato outgroup for only 40% of the COSII
(7.21 COSII); sect. Lycopersicoides was supported as the
closest outgroup to tomato for 32.5% of COSII (5.85
COSII). Section Juglandifolia and Lycopersicoides resolved
together in only 9.3% of COSII, and the remaining 18%
of COSII supported other relationships that could be considered as noise. Even though sect. Lycopersicoides was supported by a little more than 50% of the COSII as the
closest outgroup to tomato with α = 1 and 10; and sect.
Juglandifolia was supported by at least 40% of the COSII
and by more COSII than any other contradictory clade
with α infinite, the confidence intervals for all these CF
overlapped. We conclude that sect. Juglandifolia and sect.
Lycopersicoides are the closest tomato outgroups but concordance analysis cannot distinguish which is sister to the
tomato clade for most of the COSII markers. Given that
we have two primary histories that have the support of
50% of the genes with α = 1 and 10, hybridization could
be invoked as the main driving force [35] but since more
than two histories are revealed with α infinite more testing of the concordance approach should be done and
more genes should be sampled before we can conclude
with confidence that hybridization or introgression was
the main driving force (Figure 7).
Results from the second tomato concordance analysis
placed the clade consisting of S. habrochaites and S. pennellii as sister to the rest of tomatoes, indicating that those are
the most divergent group; the CF was 30% (5.38 COSII)
with α infinite, 63% (11.34 COSII) for α = 10 and 66%
(12 COSII) for α = 1, and the credibility intervals for the
CF of conflicting clades did not overlap. Thus, we conclude that S. habrochaites and S. pennellii are the most
divergent tomatoes and are monophyletic (Figure 7). This
analysis also placed S. corneliomulleri with S. peruvianum in
all the runs with CF of 33% to 47% of COSII, and S.
chilense outside of the clade conformed by S. corneliomulleri-S. lycopersicum-S. peruvianum, with CF ranging from
18% to 32% (Figure 7).
In the last concordance analysis with the tomato data set,
all 18 COSII supported S. huaylasense as the sister to two
clades, one formed by the red-orange colored fruit tomatoes (S. cheesmaniae, S. galapagense, S. lycopersicoides, S.
pimpinellifolium) and the other formed by three species, S.
arcanum-S. chmielewskii-S. neorickii; it also resolved S.

Discussion
As was pointed out in the background, all three
approaches summarizing multiple data sets seek to maximize evidence, but there are questions about when each
approach should be applied. Combined analysis of multiple data sets is justified when each data set has evolved
under the same underlying history, in which differences in
the estimated tree are due only to sampling error or model
mis-specification [35]. Under this assumption, the combined phylogenetic analysis improves the signal to noise
ratio. It potentially allows for more accurate estimation of
the single shared genealogy. It also produces a more accu-

rate phylogeny than from a consensus approach. But, in
cases where genes have tracked more than one underlying
history, some of the differences among data sets would
not be due to sampling error, but to genealogical discordance. In this case we may wish to estimate the primary history with information quantifying the extent to which
different genes have followed that history. That primary
history can be obtained using a combined analysis if there
are similar amounts of phylogenetic signal in each sampled gene. But, because combined analysis assumes that
there is only one evolutionary history, the discordance is
assumed to be caused by homoplasy, and when reticulation has occurred the inferred tree may not resemble any
of the underlying histories. In such a case, Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA) would be a better procedure to

Page 11 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:191

use, because it does not assume one single evolutionary
history. Rather, it allows us to make statements of statistical confidence in the estimated concordance factors by
taking into account the prior evidence of discordance,
uncertainty in gene tree estimates, and the number of
genes sampled. It also allows the investigation of potentially interesting biological processes, such as incomplete
lineage sorting, hybridization, and lateral gene transfer
[36]. For this reason, BCA is becoming a tool to analyze
genealogies that are neither fully reticulate nor fully divergent [35]. Therefore, we followed all three approaches to
get insights into the evolutionary processes in tomato and
potato.
COSII analyses support many aspects of prior phylogenetic interpretations of potato and tomato, show some
new relationships, but most notably, when total evidence
is invoked, one single predominant history is highlighted
with complete resolution in potato (Figure 2a) and nearly
so in tomato (Figure 3). In potato, the four clades discovered from plastid DNA restriction site data [19,21] is supported except, like waxy sequence data [22] and NIA
sequence data [23] clades 1 and 2 are united into a single
clade. Results from total evidence highly support the
hypothesis of a North and Central American B-genome
origin of the tuber-bearing members of Solanum section
Petota, as it was shown to be sister of the rest of potatoes.
It resolves the controversy among all previous individual
gene sequencing studies that showed different relationships among main clades. On the other hand, when a
prior agreement or consensus approach was invoked,
other evolutionary histories in potatoes are revealed but
with less support (Fig 2d, 2e, Figures 6, 7). Of interest is
that the branches showing these two alternative histories
(Figure 2d, 2e) are shorter than the branch showing the
predominant evolutionary history (Figure 2a). These
alternative histories could be explained by past hybridization events or fast rates of speciation.
In tomato, 19 of the 21 nodes are completely resolved and
for the first time this study highly supports the monophyly of five clades: 1) a clade that includes S. arcanum-S.
chmielewskii-S. neorickii, 2) a clade conformed by S.
chilense-S. corneliomulleri-S. peruvianum, and the sister relationship between S. corneliomulleri and S. peruvianum; 3) a
clade formed by S. habrochaites-S. pennellii as basal in
tomatoes, 4) a clade that includes S. cheesmaniae and S.
galapagense, and 5) a clade formed by S. lycopersicum and
S. pimpinellifolium (Figure 3). COSII data also clearly support the segregation of S. peruvianum sensu lato into at
least three species, S. arcanum, S. huaylasense, S. peruvianum+S. corneliomulleri (on the same clade) as a possible
single species, or all four of these species, following Peralta et al. [43]. The data show S. arcanum and S. huaylasense to be very distinct from S. corneliomulleri and S.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

peruvianum that were on the same clade (Figure 3). The
two branches that remain unresolved are the placement of
the clade S. arcanum-S. chmielewskii-S. neorickii and the
relationship among these three species. Both of these
branches are very short (Figure 3), indicating the possible
need for additional markers as was pointed out by Zou et
al. [44], who showed the need for 142 gene sequences to
resolve two small branches in the phylogeny of rice. The
sister group relationships of sect. Lycopersicon to sect. Juglandifolia and to sect. Lycopersicoides were completely
resolved thereby clarifying ambiguities in previous studies.
Concordance analyses in tomatoes reveal the same relationships as total evidence, but the monophyly of the
clade with S. chilense-S. corneliomulleri-S. peruvianum is not
supported and the placement of sect. Juglandifolia or sect.
Lycopersicoides as the closest tomato outgroup remained
unresolved. Furthermore, concordance analyses reveal
and summarize the extensive discordance among COSII
markers. This discordance is precisely why a large sample
of nuclear loci was necessary for the reconstruction of a
robust phylogeny in potato and tomato. Some potential
reasons for discordance could be methodological, to
include systematic errors due to using a wrong model of
sequence evolution, coupled with long branches, or mixtures of branch lengths within COSII, or undetected paralogy or alignment bias. Other reasons could be
biological processes such as hybridization or lineage sorting or fast speciation.
In the complete data set, where potatoes and tomatoes are
analyzed together, the sister relationship between the
potato and tomato clades is highly supported in all analyses and sect. Etuberosum is supported as sister to both
(100%, 100% and 1), confirming these controversial relationships as was first shown by Spooner et al. [14]. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of high
intron content (more than 60% in this study), and PCR
amplification length between 600 and 1000 bp to be useful to investigate relationships among potato and potato.
It shows the importance of intensive screening of COSII
primers to maximize their utility in potato and tomato
and allows us to propose the use of a reduced set of COSII
primers for maximum efficiency. For example, for the
major clades of sect. Petota, three COSII (COS9, COS9b
and COS11) were enough to reveal the predominant history with high support, and we suggest beginning with
these COSII in future studies in potato. This suggestion
has to be taken with caution because when more taxa and
more accessions per taxon are sampled the resolution can
be reduced. Finally, the utility of gaps as additional characters in phylogenetic studies is not questionable but it is
advisable to use them when their inclusion does not

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:191

increase homoplasy. However, in this study, gap characters usually increased phylogenetic signal.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

conditions worked for most COSII but in some cases we
had to modify these PCR conditions (see Additional file
3).

Conclusion
COSII sequence data are useful for potato and tomato
phylogenetic studies. Intron contents more than 60%
were the best to investigate relationships within this group
of closely related species. When total evidence is invoked,
a well-supported predominant history is revealed in both
potato and tomato. In the case of potato, with the prior
agreement and consensus approaches, two additional
possible histories were revealed, although with less statistical support. We show that 11–18 loci are enough to get
the dominant history in potato and tomato respectively,
but a reduced set of three COSII provide the same phylogeny in potato. Finally, we determined that there is not a
single evolutionary history for potato and tomato, as at
least three different possible histories were revealed. More
loci would be needed to discern the distribution of gene
genealogies in more depth, and thus detect which mechanism most likely shaped discordance among individual
COSII.

Methods
Plant Materials and DNA Isolation
One diploid genotype from nine wild potato species (sect.
Petota) representing all four plastid clades, all 13 wild
tomato species (sect. Lycopersicon), both species of sect.
Juglandifolia, both species of sect. Lycopersicoides, two species of sect. Etuberosum, and two farthest outgroups, Datura inoxia and S. dulcamara were analyzed (30 species in
total; see Additional file 1). These species were chosen to
cover most of the genomic groups and clades in potato, all
of the species recognized in tomato [24], and appropriate
outgroups. Leaf total DNA from each species was isolated
using a standard CTAB protocol [45]. DNA quality and
quantity were estimated by comparison with CsCl-purified λ DNA digested with PstI on ethidium bromidestained agarose gels.
Choice, amplification, and sequencing of COSII
We tested 40 COSII loci that were putatively single copy
in tomato and potato, from all 12 tomato and potato
chromosomes (see Additional file 2). We screened these
40 COSII in genomic DNA of four tomato and four potato
species. PCR amplifications were performed using 20 μL
reactions consisting of 0.1 μM final concentration of each
primer (see Additional file 2) and 20 ng of template
genomic DNA. Amplifications were carried out in an MJ
Research DNA Engine Dyad® Peltier Thermal Cycler
(Watertown, Massachusetts) using an initial denaturation
at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min and with a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. The reactions were run on a 1.5%
agarose gel with 1× TBE buffer for 3 hours. The above PCR

We selected 19 of these 40 loci based on single band
amplification and length of the PCR product mostly
between 600–1200 bp and with more than 60% intron
content (see Additional file 3), and amplified DNA in all
30 species. To clean the product for sequencing the reaction was digested with EXO-SAP-IT® (USB Corp., Cleveland OH) following the manufacturer's instructions
except that reaction volumes were halved. One μL of this
product was sequenced with the same primers in a 5 μL
reaction using the ABI Big Dye dideoxynucelotide termination kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California).
Amplifications were carried out in an MJ Research DNA
Engine Dyad® Peltier Thermal Cycler (Watertown, Massachusetts) using an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min,
followed by 30 cycles of 96°C for 25 s, 50°C for 20 s,
60°C for 5 min and with a final elongation at 72°C for 7
min. Excess of dye terminators were removed using
CleanSeq magnetic bead sequencing reaction clean up kit
from Agencourt Biosciences (Beverly, MA). Sequences
were resolved on an ABI 3730xl capillary-based automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with 50 cm
POP-7 polymer capillaries at the Biotechnology Center of
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. When a faint second band appeared or when the sequence was unreadable, the PCR product was cloned and five positive colonies
were sequenced. Subsequently we learned that 18 of these
19 COSII are single copy on tomato, 12 in potato and 11
in both potato and tomato (see Additional file 3).
Sequence editing and alignment
Sequences were edited with Staden package version2003.0-beta [46] and aligned using ClustalX version 1.81
[47] at default parameters, except for the "percentage of
delay divergence sequences" which was set to 15% after
tests of various parameters. Further manual alignments
were done in MacClade 4.06 PPC [48] minimizing the
number of gaps and preferring transitions to transversions. Indels were scored by the simple gap scoring
method [49] using SeqState 1.40 [50]. DNA sequences
were deposited in GenBank (see Additional file 4).
Phylogenetic analyses
All analyses were conducted on three data sets: 1) a
"potato data set" of 12 COSII across 11 species, nine of
sect. Petota and two of sect. Etuberosum, 2) a "tomato data
set" of 18 COSII across 19 species that included all species
except members of sect. Petota and sect. Etuberosum, 3) the
"complete data set" of 11 COSII across all 30 species. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony were
performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 [51]. The most parsimonious trees were found by heuristic searches under Fitch

criteria and with equal weight for all characters. A heuristic search was performed using TBR branch swapping on
100,000 random taxon addition sequences. A rooted
strict-consensus tree was obtained using S. etuberosum and
S. palustre as outgroups for the potato data set, and Datura
inoxia and S. dulcamara for the other two data sets. Bootstrap support [52] was estimated with 10,000 bootstrap
replicates performing a TBR branch swapping on 100,000
random taxon addition sequences.
Maximum likelihood analysis was used to assess 56 models evaluated in Modeltest ver. 3.07 [53] using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) and hierarchical likelihood
ratio test (hLRT) at α = 0.01. ML phylogeny was estimated
using RAxML 7.0.3 [54] that allows each partition (each
COSII) to have its own model and parameters. To evaluate the stability of clades on the optimal tree, a bootstrap
analysis was performed with 100 bootstrap replicates.
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) phylogenetic analysis [55] also was performed using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [56,57]. Model parameters for DNA data were
chosen according to the criteria described above, they
were estimated separately for DNA and gaps; for gaps the
restriction site (binary) model was used (lset coding = variable) which accounts for the ascertainment bias produced by characters that are constant (either state 0 or 1)
in all taxa and are not observed. Tree searching using
MrBayes was performed by four runs of four linked chains
("temp" was empirically determined) for 1,100,000 or
2,200,000 generations with trees sampled every 100 generations. At the end of the analysis we checked that the
average standard deviation of split frequencies was below
0.01 to ensure that convergence occurred properly. A conservative burn-in period was determined, and only postburn-in trees were saved. The three sets of post-burn-in
trees were then combined to form a majority rule consensus tree, and this pool was taken as the best representation
of the posterior distribution of tree topology and model
parameters [56]. The proportion of searches in which any
given node is found during the post burn-in portion of the
chain constitutes the Bayesian posterior probability (PP)
for that node.
The ILD test [34] was used to explore the difference in
phylogenetic signal between and among data partitions,
and in the potato data set was used to implement the prior
agreement approach, as implemented through the partition homogeneity test in PAUP* 4.0b10 [51]. Multiple
ILD tests comparing all COSII sequenced in each data set
were performed and the sequential Bonferroni correction
was used to control for multiple comparisons [34,58].
First, we performed one ILD test to see if all COSII
sequenced in each data set can be combined together.
Given that they did not pass the test, we proceeded to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/191

make all the possible pairwise comparisons within each
data set to identify the COSII that were congruent. A total
of 66 pairwise comparisons were made for the potato data
set, 153 for the tomato data set and 55 for the potato and
tomato data set. The Templeton test [59] as implemented
in PAUP* 4.0b10 [51] was used to explore alternative
topologies in a parsimony framework.
To assess the total evidence approach we performed a single analysis with the concatenated data set. For the prior
agreement approach we were able to identify groups of
COSII that gave congruent results only with the potato
data set. For the consensus approach, Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA) [36] was performed in the potato and
tomato data sets separately, to identify the best estimate of
the phylogeny of each COSII and to create a consensus of
these separate point estimates. Three different prior levels
of discordance: α = 1, 10, and infinite were used. For
instance, an α value of zero corresponds to the total evidence approach that insists there is a single tree for all
genes, and an infinite α value corresponds to an assumption of independence between gene trees. With the potato
data set four independent runs with four linked chains
were performed for all three α values; in each run with
1,100,000 generations, 100,000 of which were discarded
as the burn-in period. For heating chains, the option used
was m = 50. Runs showed good mixing and converged to
the same results since the standard deviation of concordance factors was < 0.001 in all cases.
For tomato concordance analysis, it was impossible to
perform a single concordance analysis with all of the species because the trees sampled during the Bayesian analysis of four COSII (COS13b, COS1b, COS4 and COS8)
were all distinct, and it was necessary to prune some species to reduce the number of trees sampled in the Bayesian
analysis to assure convergence to stationary distribution
within an acceptable error. For this reason, we performed
three independent analyses: 1) to determine the placement of the sections that are sister to tomatoes, a concordance analysis was performed with sequence of 18 COSII in
12 OTUs that included species or allelic variants of Datura
inoxia, S. dulcamara, S. lycopersicoides, S. sitiens, S. juglandifolium, S. ochranthum, S. pennellii, S. corneliomulleri, S.
huaylasense-1, S. huaylasense-2, S. arcanum and S. lycopersicum. For all three α values, four independent runs with
four linked chains were performed. In each run of 22 million generations, 10% of the generations were discarded
as the burn-in period; and for heating chains we used the
option m = 50. Runs showed good mixing and converged
to the same results since the standard deviation of concordance factors was < 0.005 in each case. 2) The second
concordance analysis was conducted to determine if S.
habrochaites and S. pennellii are the most divergent tomato
species and to determine the placement of S. chilense, S.

corneliomulleri, and S. peruvianum. We conducted a concordance analysis with all 18 COSII and with ten OTUs (S.
juglandifolium, S. pennellii, S. habrochaites-1, S. habrochaites-2, S. chilense-1, S. chilense-2, S. corneliomulleri, S.
peruvianum-1, S. peruvianum-2, and S. lycopersicum) using
the same parameters that were used for the outgroups.
Runs showed good mixing (SD of concordance factors
was < 0.005 in each α) 3) The last concordance analysis
with the tomato data set with all 18 COSII was conducted
to determine the placement of S. huaylasense, and to determine relationships among S. arcanum, S. chmielewskii, and
S. neorickii. Four independent runs of four linked chains
were performed for each α with seven OTUs (S. pennellii,
S. huaylasense-1, S. huaylasense-2, S. neorickii, S. arcanum, S.
chmielewskii and S. lycopersicum).
