Abstract
Background: Recent studies have shown that the fecal microbiota is generally resilient to short-term antibiotic
administration, but some bacterial taxa may remain depressed for several months. Limited information is available
about the effect of antimicrobials on small intestinal microbiota, an important contributor to gastrointestinal
health. The antibiotic tylosin is often successfully used for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in dogs, but its exact
mode of action and its effect on the intestinal microbiota remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the effect of tylosin on canine jejunal microbiota. Tylosin was administered at 20 to 22 mg/kg q 24 hr for 14 days
to five healthy dogs, each with a pre-existing jejunal fistula. Jejunal brush samples were collected through the fistula
on days 0, 14, and 28 (14 days after withdrawal of tylosin). Bacterial diversity was characterized using massive
parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing.
Results: Pyrosequencing revealed a previously unrecognized species richness in the canine small intestine. Ten
bacterial phyla were identified. Microbial populations were phylogenetically more similar during tylosin treatment.
However, a remarkable inter-individual response was observed for specific taxa. Fusobacteria, Bacteroidales, and
Moraxella tended to decrease. The proportions of Enterococcus-like organisms, Pasteurella spp., and Dietzia spp.
increased significantly during tylosin administration (p < 0.05). The proportion of Escherichia coli-like organisms
increased by day 28 (p = 0.04). These changes were not accompanied by any obvious clinical effects. On day 28,
the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day 0 in only 2 of 5 dogs. Bacterial diversity
resembled the pre-treatment state in 3 of 5 dogs. Several bacterial taxa such as Spirochaetes, Streptomycetaceae,
and Prevotellaceae failed to recover at day 28 (p < 0.05). Several bacterial groups considered to be sensitive to
tylosin increased in their proportions.
Conclusion: Tylosin may lead to prolonged effects on the composition and diversity of jejunal microbiota.
However, these changes were not associated with any short-term clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease in
healthy dogs. Our results illustrate the complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the challenges associated with
evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and their potential interactions.

Background
The gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals is inhabitated by a specialized microbiota, but our understanding
of the composition and the dynamics of this intestinal
ecosystem is very rudimentary. Recent molecular methodologies, typically based on amplification and identification of 16S ribosomal RNA genes, have revealed highly
complex and diverse bacterial, fungal, and viral communities within the intestinal tract of mammals [1-4].
The composition of the intestinal microbial ecosystem
has a significant impact on the health status of an individual. The intestinal microbiota are a key player in the development of the host immune system, provide trophic
metabolites and energy to the host, and also aid in the
resistance against colonization of pathogens [5]. At the
same time, derangements of the intestinal microbiota or
the invasion with specific pathogens have been implicated
as a cause for gastrointestinal disease [6,7].
Nutritional or medical intervention, especially the use of
antimicrobials can lead to general alterations in intestinal
microbiota [8,9]. Tylosin, a member of the macrolide
class of antibiotics, is commonly recommended for the
treatment of chronic enteropathies in dogs. It is currently
unknown if tylosin at therapeutic doses has a direct effect
on intestinal pathogens or if it leads to a more general
modulation of the intestinal microbiota in dogs with
diarrhea, with a subsequent improvement of intestinal
digestion and absorption. For example, some known gastrointestinal pathogens, including Clostridium perfringens
and Campylobacter spp., are known to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of chronic or intermittent diarrhea in dogs,
and these bacteria are generally sensitive to tylosin [10].
Tylosin is also a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of canine small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
(SIBO) or antibiotic responsive diarrhea (ARD) [11].
Recently the term tylosin-responsive diarrhea has been
introduced, because tylosin treatment led to the best therapeutic response in a subpopulation of dogs with chronic
diarrhea [12]. Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) affects
typically middle-aged, large-breed dogs and clinical signs
indicate that TRD affects both the small and large intestine. The etiology of TRD is currently unknown. Diarrhea
usually improves within a few days, but often recurs
within a few weeks after cessation of tylosin administration and the majority of dogs require lifelong therapy
[12]. However, in addition to its antimicrobial effect, a
direct anti-inflammatory effect of tylosin has also been
proposed. This anti-inflammatory effect has been speculated to be due to the modulation of cyclooxygenase-2,
nitric oxidase synthase, and several cytokines [13]. In mice
and Rhesus Macaques with colitis, tylosin has also been
shown to reduce macroscopic lesion scores, and either a
direct immunomodulatory effect or an indirect effect due

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/210

to the modulation of the microbiota has been suggested
[14,15].
Antibiotic activity has a profound effect on the intestinal
microbiota [8,16], and it is important to characterize
changes in bacterial diversity, their magnitude and the
resilience of the intestinal microbiota against antibioticrelated modifications. Such an understanding could
potentially lead to the development of alternative treatment modalities that would allow therapeutic options
other than the use of antimicrobials. While recent studies
have shown that the fecal microbiota is generally resilient
to short-term antibiotic administration, some bacterial
taxa may remain depressed for several months [8,16].
Limited information concerning the effect of antimicrobials on small intestinal microbiota, an important contributor to gastrointestinal health, is available. Previous
studies have examined the effect of tylosin on intestinal
microbiota in pigs and chickens using culture based methods or molecular fingerprinting tools, but detailed
sequencing data have not been provided [17,18]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
tylosin on the jejunal microbiota by massive parallel 16S
rRNA gene pyrosequencing.
In this study we administered tylosin at therapeutic doses
to healthy dogs with a pre-existing jejunal fistula and analyzed changes in bacterial communities before, during,
and 14 days after cessation of tylosin by 16S rRNA gene
pyrosequencing. Our results indicate a previously uncharacterized high species richness in the canine jejunum.
Tylosin had a profound effect on the microbial composition in the small intestine of dogs. Furthermore, tylosin
had also a pervasive effect on specific bacterial taxa, which
failed to recover within 14 days. However, these changes
were not associated with any short-term clinical signs of
gastrointestinal disease in healthy dogs. Our results illustrate the complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the
challenges associated with evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and
their potential interactions. The results also suggest that
the proposed mode of action of an antibiotic on different
bacterial genera does not necessarily match the in vivo
effects, as several bacterial groups that are considered to be
sensitive to tylosin increased in their proportions.

Results
Animals
All dogs tolerated the course of antibiotics well and no
obvious side effects (e.g., clinical signs of gastrointestinal
disease such as diarrhea) were noted during the study
period. The body weights or body condition scores of the
dogs did not change during the study.

Characterization of the canine small intestinal microbiota
A total of 44,069 pyrosequencing tags were evaluated
across all 15 samples (mean ± SD: 3188 ± 1091 sequencing tags per sample). All dogs showed highly diverse
microbial communities within their small intestine. Table
1 lists the mean number of obtained and maximum predicted OTUs and richness estimators at strain (1% dissimilarity), species (3%), and genus (5%) level [19]. At day 0
and at 3% dissimilarity, which is commonly used to
describe the species level [19], a range of 25-453 OTUs
(mean: 218 OTUs) was observed, indicating strong interindividual differences in microbial diversity in the canine
jejunum. The Chao 1 and Ace richness estimators were
used to estimate the total number of OTUs in the canine
jejunum. On day 0 and at 3% dissimilarity, the Chao 1
estimated between 32 and 707 OTUs (mean: 342 OTUs)
per sample, and the Ace estimated between 32 and 721
OTUs (mean: 332 OTUs) per sample. To estimate the
maximum number of OTUs at various dissimilarities, a
Richards equation was fit to the obtained rarefaction
curves [20]. Table 1 shows the mean number of maximum
predicted OTUs in the canine jejunum: on day 0 (begin of
the study) and at 3% dissimilarity (species level), the maximum predicted number of OTUs ranged from 32 to 666
(mean: 293 OTUs). At 1% dissimilarity (strain level), a
mean of 950 OTUs (range: 183 to 1,789) was predicted.
Figure 1 illustrates that with the average number of
sequencing tags collected per dog in this study (mean ±
SD: 3188 ± 1091 sequencing tags), we underestimated the
maximum number of OTUs at 1% dissimilarity. However,
at 3% and 5% dissimilarity the rarefaction curves approximate a parallel line to the x-axis, suggesting that a reasonable coverage was obtained at the species and genus level.
Using the Richard's equation we calculated that approximately 38,000 sequences would need to be sampled to
identify 100% of the expected OTUs in the canine jejunum (Figure 1B). To obtain a complete coverage at 0%
dissimilarity, approx. 106,000 sequences would need to
be analyzed (data not shown).

On day 0, ten different bacterial phyla were identified. The
major bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (46.7% of all
sequences), Firmicutes (15.0%), Actinobacteria (11.2%),
Spirochaetes (14.2%), Bacteroidetes (6.2%), and Fusobacteria (5.4%). The phyla Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and Chloroflexi accounted for < 0.1% of all
obtained sequencing tags each (Figure 2).
Effect of tylosin on diversity indices and species richness
estimators
While tylosin administration led to a progressive decrease
in mean bacterial diversity and species richness estimators
over the three sampling periods (Table 1), this effect was
not consistent for all dogs. In fact, on day 14 (i.e., samples
collected at the end of tylosin administration) the Shan-

non-Weaver diversity index increased moderately in 2
dogs and markedly in 1 dog (Figure 3). Similar results
were obtained for OTUs and the Chao 1 and Ace estimators. On day 28 (14 days after cessation of tylosin administration), the diversity indices and richness estimators
were markedly decreased in 2 out of 5 dogs when compared to baseline.

This table shows the Shannon-Weaver bacterial diversity index, observed operative taxonomical units (OTU), the predicted maximum number of
OTUs in the canine jejunum, rarefaction, and species richness estimators (ACE and Chao 1) at strain (1% dissimilarity), species (3%), and genus (5%)
level across the three sampling periods. Tylosin administration led to a progressive decrease in mean indices, which were lowest on day 28 (14 days
after cessation of tylosin). However, a strong individual variation was observed among all dogs (see text).

Effect of tylosin on small intestinal microbial communities
Results of the UniFrac distance metric indicated that
tylosin led to a significant shift in microbial populations
(p < 0.05). Microbial communities tended to form a cluster during tylosin treatment (Figure 4). A PCA plot was
generated using the unweighted UniFrac distance metric,
which takes into account the presence or absence of different taxa without regard to their abundance (Figure 5).
Tylosin associated samples (green, day 14) were separated
from the non tylosin associated samples mostly along

PCA axis 2 (accounting for 13.5% of all variability
between samples). On day 28, the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day 0 in only 2 of 5
dogs (Figure 4). Bacterial diversity as measured by the
Shannon-Weaver diversity index resembled the pre-treatment state in 3 of 5 dogs (Figure 3). Several bacterial
groups changed in their proportions in response to
tylosin, but a high inter-individual response was observed
for various bacterial taxa. Proportions of Spirochaetes,

tylosin administration; day 28 = 2 weeks after cessation of tylosin therapy).

Fusobacteria, Bacteroidales, Moraxella, and Bacilli tended to
decrease during tylosin administration.
Spirochaetes
Spirochaetes were found in all 5 dogs at baseline (mean:
14.15%, range: 0.05% to 62.97% of all identified
sequences). On day 14, sequences of Spirochaetes were
found in 2 of 5 dogs, with a reduction of the mean to
0.02% (range 0.00% to 0.06%; p = 0.039). This bacterial
phylum was found on day 28 only in 3 of 5 dogs (mean
0.36%, range 0.00% to 1.48%). In the dog with the highest proportion of sequences belonging to Spirochaetes at
baseline (62.97%), no such sequences were identified on
days 14 or 28.
Fusobacteria
Fusobacteria were detected in 3 of 5 dogs at baseline, but
this bacterial phylum was a major constituent of the jejunal microbiota in only 1 dog (18.22% of all sequences).
In this dog, Fusobacteria decreased to 0.16% on day 14,
and rebounded to 27.98% on day 28. In the remaining
dogs, Fusobacteria were detected at low proportions (range
0.00% to 2.25%) at the three sampling points, and overall
no significant changes were observed for this phylum.
Bacteroidetes
Sequences belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes were
detected in all dogs at all 3 time points (mean 5.34% of
all sequences). This group showed marked inter-individual differences in the response to tylosin on the phylum
level. On day 14 the proportions of Bacteroidetes were
increased in 3 dogs, decreased in 1 dog, and unchanged in

1 dog. On day 28, there was a trend for the proportions of
Bacteroidetes to return to baseline values. Analysis on various phylogenetic levels revealed that the proportions of
Flavobacteriacae increased by day 14 (marked increase in 3
of 5 dogs) and returned to baseline by day 28 (p = 0.09).
In contrast, the order Bacteroidales decreased in proportions in all 5 dogs by day 14 (mean 5.95% on day 0 vs.
0.12% on day 14), and tended to return to baseline by day
28 (mean 1.63% on day 28; p = 0.09). This was predominantly due to a significant decrease in Prevotellaceae (mean
2.09% on day 0 vs. 0.03% on day 14; p = 0.039). Furthermore, Prevotellaceae did not recover by day 28 and were
not detected in any of the dogs at this time point. Bacteroidaceae decreased by day 14 (mean 1.71% on day 0 vs.
0.06% on day 14), but this effect was not significant (p =
0.49). Furthermore, Bacteroidaceae increased by day 28
(mean 0.42% of all sequences).
Firmicutes
The phylum Firmicutes was the second most abundant
bacterial group in the canine jejunum (Figure 2). On a
phylum level, no significant changes were observed across
the three time points for Firmicutes. Clostridiaceae
increased from 5.47% to 19.46% and decreased to
10.72% by day 28. However, this data was skewed due to
a marked shift of the microbiota observed in one dog,
where sequences belonging to C. perfringens-like organisms increased from 21.8% to 86.47% to 33.6% across the
three time points (Figure 6). In the remaining dogs,
Clostridium spp. showed only moderate changes by day 14
and 28, and overall no significant changes were observed
for this bacterial group (p = 0.52).

significant changes were observed at the phylum level. All
five classes of Proteobacteria were identified (Figure 7), but
they varied in their proportions and in their response to
treatment (Figure 8).

α-Proteobacteria were detected in all 5 dogs on days 0 and
14, and in 4 dogs on day 28. This bacterial group was
decreased in all dogs on day 14 and 28, mostly due to a
decrease in Sphingomonadaceae, but this effect was not significant (p = 0.12; Figure 8).
Individual differences were observed for β-Proteobacteria
with Alcaligenaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Neisseriaceae
being the most abundant representatives (Table 2). For
Neisseria spp. there was a moderate increase on day 14 and
a decrease on day 28, but overall these changes were not
significant (means: 0.24% on day 0, 0.37% on day 14,
and 0.08% on day 28; p = 0.12). δ-Proteobacteria were
observed in low abundance and no obvious changes were
observed.

γ-Proteobacteria were the most predominant group and

administration (day 14, in red) tended to form a cluster (Jackknife value > 70%).

Inter-individual differences were observed for Bacillales,
and their proportions increased in 2 dogs and decreased
in 3 dogs by day 14 (Figure 6). Lactobacillales decreased in
4 dogs, but increased in 1 dog by day 14, and tended to
return to baseline values by day 28 (p = 0.12). On a genus
level, inter-individual differences were observed for Lactobacillus-like organisms, which increased in 2 dogs,
remained stable in 2, and decreased in 1 dog by day 14,
and tended to return to baseline values by day 28 (p =
0.36). The proportions of Enterococcus-like organisms
increased from 0.3% to 1.1% to 0.1% by day 28 (p < 0.01)
(Figure 6). This increase was observed in 4 of 5 dogs,
whereas the proportions remained stable in the remaining
dog.
Proteobacteria
The phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant in the
canine jejunum at all three sampling points (Figure 2). No

were identified in all 5 dogs at all time points. Sequences
of Escherichia coli-like organisms increased significantly by
day 28 (p = 0.04) (Figure 3). This increase was observed in
3 dogs, where Escherichia coli-like organisms became the
predominant group by day 28. Pasteurella spp. increased
significantly (Table 2) by day 14, and returned to baseline
values on day 28 (p = 0.04). This increase on day 14 was
observed in 4 out of 5 dogs (Figure 2). Moraxallaceae
decreased in 4 of 5 dogs on day 14, but increased in the
remaining dog (Table 2, Figure 6).
A significant change was observed for ε-Proteobacteria (Figure 8; p = 0.039). Sequences belonging to this class were
observed in 5 dogs on day 0, but only in 1 dog each on
days 14 and 28 (p = 0.013). Decreases in Helicobacteariaceae and Campylobacteriaceae were both contributing to
this change in ε-Proteobacteria (Table 2).
Actinobacteria
Sequences belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria were
identified in all dogs at all time points. No consistent
changes in response to tylosin were observed on the phylum level. However, significant changes were observed for
some bacterial taxa within this phylum. Dietziaceae
increased significantly by day 14 (Figure 6; p = 0.03). This
group increased in 3 dogs, remained stable in 1 dog, and
was not detected in the remaining dog. Interestingly, no
sequences belonging to Dietziaceae were detectable on day
28. Streptomycetaceae were detected in 3 dogs on day 0, but
in none of the dogs on days 14 or 28 (Table 2; p = 0.039).
Actinomycetaceae decreased in 4 of 5 dogs, but increased in
the remaining dog on day 14. No Bifidobacterium spp.
were detected in any of the samples.

microbial communities in all dogs at the 3 treatment periods (yellow = day 0; green = after 14 days of tylosin treatment; blue =
day 28, 2 weeks after cessation of tylosin treatment). Tylosin associated samples (green, day 14) were separated from the non
tylosin associated samples mostly along PCA axis 2 (accounting for 13.5% of all variability between samples), indicating that
tylosin treatment had an effect on the microbial composition of the jejunal microbiota.

Discussion
Assessment of microbial diversity in the small intestine of
dogs remains challenging, because anesthesia is required
to obtain a sample, followed by either endoscopic or surgical collection of intestinal samples. Anesthesia may alter
intestinal motility, and also repeated endoscopy may lead
to perturbations of the intestinal microbiota. Therefore,
the response of the jejunal microbiota to tylosin was evaluated in healthy Beagle Dogs each with a pre-existing jeju-

nal fistula [21]. All dogs were accustomed to their fistula
for several years and it is, therefore, unlikely that the presence of this fistula has impacted the intestinal microbiota.
We collected samples using a sterile cytology brush that
was advanced through the fistula. This approach is easier,
faster, and more reproducible compared to the aspiration
of jejunal content. Furthermore, because an endoscope is
too large to advance through the small lumen of the fistula, intestinal biopsies would have to be collected in a

blinded fashion, which might have increased the variation
in the sampling procedure. In contrast, mucosal brushings
are technically easier to obtain and have been shown to be
highly reproducible [22]. We speculate that mucosal
brushings represent a mixture of luminal content and the
mucosa-adherent microbiota [23].
In this study, massive parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing proved to be a powerful and sensitive method
for the further characterization of canine small intestinal
microbiota. In previous studies using a comparative 16S
rRNA gene based approach, up to 6 different bacterial
phyla have been identified in the canine intestine [2,24]
We have identified 4 additional phyla that were not previously reported in dogs: Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi. These bacterial phyla were
present at low abundance, with less than 1% of all pyrosequencing tags. The ecological significance of these low

abundant bacterial phyla in the canine intestine remains
to be determined. Furthermore, due to their low abundance, it was not possible to appreciate any significant
effect due to tylosin treatment. While the overall composition of the small intestinal microbiota on a phylum
through genus level was similar as reported previously in
the canine duodenum using 16S rRNA gene analysis
[2,24], the pyrosequencing approach has revealed a much
higher richness on a species and strain level (Table 1). Rarefaction curves (Figure 1) revealed that with the number
of here obtained sequencing tags per sample (mean ± SD:
3188 ± 1091), we have underestimated the number of
OTUs at 1% dissimilarity, but obtained a reasonable coverage at 3% and 5% dissimilarity. Our calculations
revealed that the canine jejunum harbors between 32 and
666 (mean: 293) bacterial species and between 183 and
1,789 (mean: 950) bacterial strains. Approximately
38,000 sequence tags would need to be analyzed per jeju-

nal sample to cover 100% of the predicted maximum
OTUs present in the canine jejunum. Therefore, future
studies evaluating the small intestinal microbiota will
need to employ larger sequencing datasets to characterize
changes in low abundant bacterial groups.
By altering the intestinal microbiota, antibiotics can
exhibit either a deleterious or a beneficial effect on gastrointestinal health. In humans with antibiotic associated
diarrhea, a disruption of the intestinal ecosystem may predispose to an overgrowth of pathogenic species (e.g., C.
difficile) [25]. However, antimicrobials can also be useful
in the treatment of intestinal disorders. The macrolide
antibiotic tylosin is commonly used for the treatment of
dogs with chronic diarrhea, but the exact mode of action
of tylosin remains unclear [11,12]. Most dogs respond

favourably within 3-5 days, and stool consistency remains
normal during treatment. However, diarrhea often reappears within weeks after discontinuation of administration [12]. Tylosin belongs to the macrolide class of
antibiotics that is characterized by a multi-membered lactone ring [26]. Antibiotics of the macrolide class inhibit
bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the L27 protein
of the 50S ribosomal subunit. This inhibits the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the acceptor to the donor side
on the ribosome, as well as the initial steps of assembly of
the 50S subunit [26]. Macrolides are more effective in
crossing the cell membrane of gram-positive bacteria
compared to gram-negatives [27]. Therefore, the proposed antibiotic activity of tylosin is directed against
gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Stapylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Clostridium spp.) and also against some Myc-

oplasma and Chlamydia spp. While tylosin also has an
effect against some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Campylobacter spp., Helicobacter pylori, and Pasteurella spp.) it has
no apparent effect against members of the Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Escherichia coli) [27].
Antibiotics might exhibit their anti-diarrheal effect by
either reducing total bacterial load in the gut or by modulating the proportions of specific bacterial taxa and, therefore, altering bacterial metabolites that affect the
gastrointestinal tract. The here used pyrosequencing
approach does not allow us to draw conclusions about
changes in total bacteria within the intestine, as we did
not include any measure for total bacterial load in our
mucosal brushing samples. However, our approach
shows changes in relative proportions of specific bacterial
taxa in response to tylosin in a more comprehensive fashion than previously reported [9,18]. Recent studies in
humans have evaluated the response of intestinal microbiota to a short-course treatment with amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin on fecal microbiota [8,16]. Similar to our
results, antibiotic treatment led to major shifts in the
dominant fecal bacterial populations, starting within 24
hours of administration [16]. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin
affected the abundance of approximately one third of all
bacterial taxa [8]. The human fecal microbiota proved to
be generally resilient, and most taxa returned to baseline
within 30 days, but some bacterial taxa failed to recover
for up to 6 months [8,16].
In this study evaluating the small intestinal microbiota,
we observed significant changes in the canine small intestinal microbiota in response to tylosin. Results of the Unifrac distance metric indicated that the jejunal microbiota
of individual dogs were phylogentically more similar during tylosin administration. Samples tended to cluster during tylosin administration, indicating that such changes
were due to treatment effect rather than temporal variation. Furthermore, in previous studies, using either bacterial culture or DGGE analysis, it has been shown that the
major bacterial groups in the canine jejunum display temporal stability over time [22,28], further suggesting that
the observed changes were indeed caused by tylosin treatment.
In general, the observed microbial shifts occurred in three
major patterns: (a) bacterial groups that decreased in their
proportions by day 14 and rebounded by day 28, (b) bacterial groups that decreased in their proportions by day 14
and failed to recover by day 28, and (c) bacterial groups
that increased in their proportions by day 14 and returned
to baseline values by day 28. We also observed unexpected
highly individualized responses to tylosin treatment for
specific bacterial taxa in some dogs. For dogs with
diarrhea it is currently unknown if the effect of tylosin is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/210

mediated by a reduction in total bacterial load, by suppression of a single pathogen, or by an immunomodulatory effect [12]. Our findings show that tylosin affects the
proportion of various bacterial groups in the intestine. It
is, therefore, unlikely that tylosin would have solely an
effect on a single pathogen in clinical cases. It can be
hypothesized that some of the observed shifts in microbial populations might contribute to the beneficial effect
observed in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Examples of
the beneficial effect of antibiotics may include altered
concentrations of secreted metabolic products, decreased
competition for nutrients or vitamins, altered cross-talk
with the intestinal immune system, or a modification of
cellular metabolism [29-31]. To prove this hypothesis,
evaluation of these bacterial groups in clinical studies
involving diseased animals are required. Furthermore,
changes in bacterial populations will need to be correlated
with treatment outcome.
It is interesting that the proportions of Enterococcus-like
organisms, which are commonly used in probiotic formulations increased significantly during tylosin treatment.
Enterococcus spp. have been reported to be resistant to
tylosin in several animal studies [17,32], and suppression
of the commensal microbiota by antibiotic treatment may
have allowed the proliferation of this bacterial group. For
example, in one study using a continues flow culture
model, a tylosin-resistant exogenous E. faecium strain
could maintain itself only in the presence of tylosin [17].
These results support the concept that tylosin may promote the growth of potentially beneficial commensal bacteria such as Enterococcus spp., which may have probiotic
characteristics. A similar concept has also been suggested
for the effect for the antibiotic metronidazole, also commonly used for treatment of dogs with chronic enteropathies. In humans, metronidazole increased the
proportions of Bifidobacterium spp. [33]. However, it
remains unclear if a mere increase in the proportions of
specific bacterial genera is sufficient to exhibit a probiotic
effect. It is currently also unknown, if minor changes (i.e.,
less than 10-fold) as observed have any significant impact
on intestinal health. To prove the concept that antibiotics
may be able to promote proliferation of probiotic bacteria, it would be useful to isolate native Enterococcus strains
and evaluate their functional interactions with other
members of the intestinal microbiota and also evaluate
their probiotic properties in dogs with gastrointestinal
disease.
Tylosin is usually considered safe for long-term use in
dogs [34]. However, in this study we observed some unexpected microbial shifts, which may suggest that tylosin,
similar to other antibiotics, can lead to a disruption of the
intestinal ecosystem and also have potentially deleterious
effects on gastrointestinal health. We observed significant

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:210

increases for Pasteurella spp., E. coli-like organisms, and a
dramatic increase in C. perfringens-like organisms in one
dog. Tylosin is prescribed for the therapy of upper respiratory infections associated with Pasteurella multocida. However, this group increased significantly during the
treatment period. It remains unclear, if Pasteurella multocida has developed resistance to tylosin in the here studied
dogs, or if the intestinal phylotypes differ from those isolated from the lung. Tylosin appears to be an appropriate
antibiotic for the treatment of C. perfringens-associated
diarrhea in canine patients, although resistant strains have
been observed [10]. Similarly, in a chicken model of
necrotizing enteritis, tylosin quantitatively decreased the
proportion of mucolytic C. perfringens [18]. However in
this study, the percentage of C. perfringens-like organisms
increased from 21.8% on day 0 to 86.7% on day 14 in one
dog, suggesting that this dog harbored a resistant strain.
Our results also suggest that the proposed mode of action
of an antibiotic on different bacterial genera does not necessarily match the in vivo effects, as several bacterial
groups that are considered to be sensitive to tylosin
increased in their proportions. Because of the nature of an
ecosystem, the changes that are induced by an antibiotic
on one set of organisms will affect others, and this is not
necessarily predicted by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities.
E. coli-like organisms, a bacterial group that has also been
associated with a negative impact on gastrointestinal
health in dogs [24,35] increased significantly by day 28.
The enrichment of E. coli-like organisms is not surprising,
as this group is intrinsically resistant to tylosin, and similar increases have been observed in pigs after tylosin treatment [36]. However, we have no obvious explanation
why this effect was observed on day 28 rather than day 14,
the last day of tylosin administration. Also, based on the
techniques used, it is not possible to determine if a bacterial population proliferated or simply increased in proportion because other bacteria were affected (directly or
indirectly) by the antibiotic treatment.
While E. coli-like organisms and C. perfringens increased in
some of the dogs, this was not associated with any obvious clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. We speculate
that despite obvious changes in microbial populations,
the intestinal ecosystem has enough functional redundancy to maintain gastrointestinal health. Similar findings have also been reported in humans, where short-term
courses of antibiotics led to significant shifts in fecal
microbiota patterns, yet no obvious gastrointestinal signs
were observed [8,16]. However, all these studies, including the present one, have evaluated healthy individuals,
which may harbor a stable intestinal ecosystem that has
enough functional redundancy to withstand short-term
modulations. It is currently unknown how antibiotics
affect dogs with gastrointestinal disease that may be more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/210

susceptible to such treatments. Of interest would be also
to evaluate the long-term effects of antibiotics on the temporal stability of the intestinal microbiota and their influence on gastrointestinal health. It might be possible that
the microbiota in animals undergoing a course of antibiotic treatment is less stable and, therefore, at an increased
risk for gastrointestinal disease or infections. Follow up
studies over a period of years would be needed to answer
this question. In this study we have evaluated healthy
dogs, and it is possible that tylosin has a different effect on
the microbiota in dogs with signs of gastrointestinal disease. It is suspected that diseased dogs have an altered
microbial composition, and it is possible that tylosin
results in modulations in microbiota that differ from
those observed in the here evaluated healthy animals.
Evaluating endoscopically obtained pre- and post treatment samples from dogs with tylosin-responsive diarrhea
would be valuable. Future studies will need also to evaluate intestinal contents for changes in bacterial metabolites
or gene expression in response to antibiotic treatment as a
measure of functional redundancy of the intestinal microbiota.
Studies in humans have shown that the fecal microbiota
are generally resilient to short-term modulations by antibiotics, but pervasive effects might last for several months
for specific bacterial taxa [8,16]. The resilience of a microbial community reflects its capability to return to baseline
after disturbances to the community (i.e., antibiotic treatment) have ceased. Less is known about the resilience of
the small intestinal microbiota. Our results illustrate the
complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the challenges
associated with evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and their potential interactions. Our results indicate that tylosin may lead
to prolonged effects on the composition and diversity of
jejunal microbiota. On day 28, the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day 0 in only 2 of 5
dogs. Bacterial diversity as measured by the ShannonWeaver diversity index resembled the pre-treatment state
in 3 of 5 dogs. Several bacterial groups changed in their
proportions in response to tylosin. After cessation of
tylosin, the phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria tended to
return to pretreatment values within 14 days. Other phyla,
such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes did
not return to their pre-treatment proportions. Tylosin had
also a pervasive effect on several bacterial groups that
failed to recover by day 28 (i.e., 14 days after tylosin therapy had been completed). Those groups included Spirochaetes, Streptomycetaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and
Prevotellaceae. Tylosin has a known activity against Spirochaetes [37]. Spirochaetes have been associated with intestinal disease in chickens and pigs, but their pathogenic
role in dogs remains unclear, as they are commonly
observed in healthy dogs as well as dogs with diarrhea

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:210

[2,24,38]. The clinical significance of Sphingomonadaceae,
Prevotellaceae, and Streptomycetaceae in the small intestine
of dogs has, to our knowledge, not been evaluated to date.
Furthermore, future studies with longer follow-up periods
than 14 days after treatment cessation will be useful to
evaluate the long-term effect of tylosin on the jejunal
microbiota. Result of such studies may indicate the time
needed for the microbiota to return to its pre-treatment
state.

28 (14 days after withdrawal of tylosin). To ensure consistency in sample collection, the same person collected
all the samples during the whole study period. Furthermore, the samples were obtained according to a timetable
with each sample collected exactly at the same time after
feeding (i.e. dogs were fed consecutively, so that each sample could be collected in each dog at the same time after
feeding). Samples were homogenized, properly labeled,
and immediately frozen and stored at -80°C until further
analysis.

Conclusion
In conclusion, using deep massive parallel pyrosequencing we identified additional bacterial phyla and demonstrated the enormous species richness present in the small
intestine of healthy dogs. We have demonstrated a profound and pervasive effect of tylosin on microbial diversity and various bacterial groups. These bacterial groups
may represent candidates for exploration in clinical studies, and their changes will need to be correlated with clinical outcome, to further understand the effect of tylosin
on gastrointestinal health.

Methods
Animals
Five healthy dogs, each with a pre-existing jejunal fistula
inserted approximately 60 cm distal to the pylorus were
used in this study [21]. All dogs were considered healthy
and had no recent history of gastrointestinal disease. All
dogs were unrelated and approximately two years old.
Their body weights ranged from 12 to 19 kg, and their
body condition scores ranged between 3 and 4 (median
3) on a 5-point scale. The dogs received a commercial dry
dog food (Mastery Adult Essential Maintenance, Dog'n
Cat International, Vauvert, France) twice a day throughout
the study period. According to the manufacturer, the food
composition was 28% crude protein, 20% crude fat, 7%
crude ash, and 2.5% crude fibre. During the study period,
the dogs were cared for by the same personnel. All dogs
were housed at the same laboratory animal unit at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland. Dogs were housed in separate pens and treated
individually. All dogs were fed at the same time each day.

Tylosin was administered at 20 to 22 mg/kg q 24 hr for a
period of 14 consecutive days. This is the same dose that
has previously been recommended for the treatment of
tylosin-responsive diarrhea [34].
Sample collection
The study had been approved by the Finnish Ethical Committee with license number ESLH-2007-09833/Ym-23.
Mucosal brush samples were collected by advancing a
sterile cytology brush through the fistula as described previously [23]. Samples were collected on day 0 (baseline),
day 14 (after 14 days of tylosin administration), and day

DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was extracted individually from all jejunal
samples using a modified bead beating method followed
by phenol:chloroform:iso-amylalcohol extraction as
described previously for canine small intestinal brush
samples [23].
Massive parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing
Bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing
(bTEFAP) based upon the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA
gene was performed as described previously [39] at the
Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX.).
Sequence analysis
Following sequencing, all failed sequence reads, low quality sequence ends (Q20 based scores as determined by the
Roche base calling algorithm) and tags were removed.
Datasets were depleted of any non-bacterial ribosomal
sequences and chimeras using custom software described
previously [40] and the Black Box Chimera Check software B2C2 (Gontcharova et al 2009, in press, described
and freely available at http://www.researchandtest
ing.com/B2C2.html). Sequences less than 150 bp were
removed. To determine the identity of bacteria in the
remaining sequences, sequences were first compared
against a database of high confidence 16S rRNA gene
sequences derived from NCBI using a distributed BLASTn
.NET algorithm [41]. Database sequences were characterized as high quality based upon the criteria of RDP ver 9
[42]. Using a .NET and C# analysis pipeline, the resulting
BLASTn outputs were compiled, validated using taxonomic distance methods when necessary (multiple hits
with similar BLASTn statistics), and data reduction analysis was performed as described previously [20]. For distance method validation, the top 25 BLASTn hits were
automatically extracted, trimmed and aligned using MUSCLE, a distance matrix formed using PHYLIP, and the hits
ranked based upon distance scores and BLASTn statistics.
Identifications were resolved based upon a preference for
distance scoring. Rarefaction of 200 bp trimmed, nonribosomal sequence depleted, chimera depleted, high
quality reads was performed as described previously [20].
Based upon the BLASTn derived sequence identity (percentage of total length query sequence, which aligns with

Page 14 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:210

a given database sequence validated using distance methods), the bacteria were classified at the appropriate taxonomic levels based upon the following criteria: sequences
with identity scores to known or well characterized 16S
sequences greater than 97% were resolved at the species
level, between 95% and 97% at the genus level, between
90% and 95% at the family level, and between 80% and
90% at the order level [19]. After individually resolving
the sequences within each sample to its best hit, the
results were compiled to provide relative abundance estimations at each taxonomic level. Evaluations presented at
a given taxonomic level, except the species level, represent
all sequences resolved to their primary genera identification or their closest relative (where indicated).
Statistical analysis
To determine whether the bacterial communities were different between the treatment periods, the UniFrac distance metric was used [43]. This method measures the
phylogenetic distance among bacterial communities in a
phylogenetic tree [43], and provides a measure of similarity among communities in different samples. To compare
the similarity of the jejunal microbiota in all dogs at the
three time points, all the pair-wise distances between the
communities were computed. To visualize the clustering
of the samples along the first 3 axes of maximal variance,
Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCA) was used. PCA
allows visualization whether any environmental factors
(i.e., tylosin treatment) would group the communities
together (Figure 5).

Differences in bacterial groups between time points were
determined using repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman's test where appropriate (Prism5, GraphPad Software
Inc, San Diego, Calif). Fisher's exact tests were used to
compare proportions of dogs that harbor specific bacterial
taxa among time points. The data were used to calculate
the Shannon-Weaver bacterial diversity index, which
yields information about species diversity in bacterial
communities. The Shannon-Weaver index (Hs) was
defined as -∑piln(pi), where pi is the proportion of individual bacteria found in a certain species [44]. The Shannon-Weaver index takes into account the abundance and
the evenness of the species present within a community.
Microbial communities with higher species richness and
an even distribution (i.e., each species is present in similar
proportions) will have a higher Hs than communities
with a lower species richness, or communities with high
species richness but where a few species predominate. To
estimate the total number of OTUs present in each sample, the coverage-based nonparametric richness estimators Ace and Chao 1 were calculated. Rarefaction curves
were produced using the software program DOTUR [45].
Rarefaction analysis is used to estimate diversity and can
serve as an indicator for the completeness of sampling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/210

[46]. To predict the maximum number of OTUs present in
the canine jejunum, a Richards equation [47] was fit to
the rarefaction curves [20]. The Richards equation has
parameters C1 and C2 with the equation C1 = A × (1+(B 1) × EXP (-C × ((C2) - D)))(1/(1-B)), where C1 is the OTU
estimated and C2 is the number of sequences sampled
[20].
