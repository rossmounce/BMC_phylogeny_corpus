Abstract
Background: Mutations that impair mitochondrial functioning are associated with a variety of metabolic and
age-related disorders. A barrier to rigorous tests of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging processes has
been the lack of model systems with relevant, naturally occurring mitochondrial genetic variation. Toward the goal
of developing such a model system, we studied natural variation in life history, metabolic, and aging phenotypes
as it relates to levels of a naturally-occurring heteroplasmic mitochondrial ND5 deletion recently discovered to
segregate among wild populations of the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae. The normal product of ND5 is a
central component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and integral to cellular energy metabolism.
Results: We quantified significant variation among C. briggsae isolates for all phenotypes measured, only some of
which was statistically associated with isolate-specific ND5 deletion frequency. We found that fecundity-related
traits and pharyngeal pumping rate were strongly inversely related to ND5 deletion level and that C. briggsae
isolates with high ND5 deletion levels experienced a tradeoff between early fecundity and lifespan. Conversely,
oxidative stress resistance was only weakly associated with ND5 deletion level while ATP content was unrelated to
deletion level. Finally, mean levels of reactive oxygen species measured in vivo showed a significant non-linear
relationship with ND5 deletion level, a pattern that may be driven by among-isolate variation in antioxidant or
other compensatory mechanisms.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the ND5 deletion may adversely affect fitness and mitochondrial
functioning while promoting aging in natural populations, and help to further establish this species as a useful
model for explicit tests of hypotheses in aging biology and mitochondrial genetics.

Background
Caenorhabditis elegans has long been appreciated as a
useful model organism for developmental, molecular,
and aging biology. As molecular genetic and genomic
approaches have become increasingly available, nematode biologists have also become interested in explaining
and predicting natural patterns of phenotypic and genomic evolution. These interests have motivated recent
efforts to quantify natural phenotypic variation and
molecular population genetic structuring, and to characterize the ecology and natural history of nematode

species in order to interpret such findings within robust
population and ecological genetic contexts [e.g., [1-5]].
Caenorhabditis briggsae was until recently the closest
known relative of C. elegans and has therefore been the
subject of many different types of comparative analyses
[e.g., [6-9]]. Building upon previous discoveries of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation segregating among
natural populations [10,11], we sought to further
develop the C. briggsae system by quantifying the degree
to which this mtDNA diversity is associated with population-level variation in life-history, physiological, and
aging related phenotypes. This work will provide a foundation for generating and testing hypotheses in mitochondrial mutation biology and aging research.

Mutations that impair functioning of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) are associated with
a variety of human metabolic and age-related disorders
[12-14]. A barrier to in-depth studies of the inheritance,
population dynamics, and effects of clinically relevant
mtDNA mutations has been the lack of genetic model
systems that adequately represent the features of pathogenic mtDNA mutations [14]. Howe and Denver [10]
discovered a naturally occurring heteroplasmic mtDNA
deletion segregating among geographically distinct
populations of the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae. The deletion eliminates the 5’ end (first 786 bp) of
the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene, the
normal protein product of which is an essential and
highly conserved core subunit of mitochondrial ETC
complex I [10]. In humans, several neurodegenerative
disorders including Parkinson’s disease are associated
with heteroplasmic ND5 mutations [13].
The C. briggsae deletion occurs as a consequence of
directly repeated 21bp DNA sequence tracts in the ND5
gene and in an upstream pseudogene named ΨND5-2
(Figure 1A). The observed deletion is expected to
strongly and negatively affect ND5 protein-coding function as the deleted sequences encode more than
200 ND5 amino acids, 34 of which are conserved in
C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and humans. Two PCR
approaches showed that deletion-containing genomes
constitute from 0 to ~50% of total within-isolate mitochondrial populations (Figure 1B, Additional file 1,
Table S1).
Based on other studies of ETC complex I-deficient
genotypes [15-18], we hypothesized that expression of
truncated ND5 protein products would be associated
with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced fitness, and faster rates of aging. Higher rates of nuclear [6,19] and
mitochondrial [20] mutation in C. briggsae relative to
C. elegans and a negative correlation between ND5 deletion frequency and reproductive output in C. briggsae
[10] are consistent with this hypothesis, although it cannot yet be ruled out that nuclear-encoded genes are
responsible instead.
With the dual goals of further characterizing global phenotypic variation in C. briggsae and developing a novel
model system for mitochondrial mutation dynamics, ETC
dysfunction, and aging research, we performed a survey of
natural variation in fitness, physiological, and aging related
phenotypes among C. briggsae isolates containing different
proportions of ND5-deletion bearing mtDNA genomes.
We found significant among-isolate variation in all phenotypes studied, some of which was statistically associated
with isolate-specific ND5 deletion heteroplasmy level. Specifically, C. briggsae isolates containing a high proportion
of ND5 deletion genomes tended to have reduced

the same isolates did not differ consistently with respect to
lifespan, ATP content, or acute oxidative stress resistance.
Additionally, although the C. briggsae isolate with the

highest ND5 deletion frequency exhibited the highest
levels of ROS as expected, we found a non-linear relationship between ND5 deletion and ROS level. These patterns
may be explained by as yet unknown differences in physiological adaptations among C. briggsae isolates; e.g., ROS
detoxification mechanisms and reliance on anaerobic
energy metabolism.

Results and Discussion
We surveyed variation in life history, physiology, and
aging phenotypes among wild C. briggsae isolates that
represent the full spectrum of natural variation in ND5
deletion frequency (Figure 1B). We found strong and
significant negative correlations between ND5 deletion
level and both nematode fecundity and population
growth rate (r) (Table 1). These patterns are driven
entirely by two of the three high-deletion isolates as
compared to low and zero-deletion isolates (Figure 2A)
and may indicate that the ND5 deletion has a negative
effect on C. briggsae fitness only when its frequency
reaches a certain threshold [cf. [21]]. Specifically, when
isolates were subdivided into deletion frequency categories (Figure 1B legend), we found that high-ND5 deletion isolates had significantly reduced total fecundities
and r compared to either low or zero-deletion isolates
(Tukey HSD, a = 0.05; Figure 2A). We also found a significant negative correlation between ND5 deletion level
and lifespan (Table 1, Figure 2B), but the pattern is far
weaker than that for fecundity. Indeed, low-deletion
isolates were found to live longer than either high or
zero-deletion isolates (Tukey HSD, a = 0.05), a pattern
driven by the particularly long lifespan of low-deletion
isolate, PB800 (Ohio) (Figure 2B).
Consistent with findings from C. elegans [e.g., [22,23]],
we found little evidence for life history tradeoffs in
C. briggsae isolates; average correlations between all pairs
of reproduction and longevity traits were positive (Additional file 2, Table S2). However, we found one exception
to this trend for isolate-specific trait correlations: the three

high-ND5 deletion C. briggsae isolates are significantly
more likely to experience a tradeoff between early fecundity and longevity; i.e., animals that live long tend to have
reduced fecundity early in life (Figure 3) when such a
reduction will most negatively affect population growth
rates. These findings are reminiscent of those for

C. elegans long lived mutants assayed either under nutritional stress [22] or benign conditions [24] and are consistent with the idea that the tradeoffs predicted by life
history theory [25] may only manifest themselves in nematodes experiencing some form of stress - either exogenous
or endogenous stress (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction).
Because pharyngeal pumping rate is a reliable biomarker
of age in C. elegans [26,27], we hypothesized that highND5 deletion C. briggsae isolates would exhibit slower
pharyngeal pumping in non-aging individuals as well as
faster declines in pharyngeal pumping (i.e., increased
muscle deterioration) with age when compared to low
and zero-ND5 deletion isolates. In agreement with the
first expectation, we observed a striking negative relationship between ND5 deletion level and average pharyngeal pumping rates in non-aging worms (Table 1,
Figure 4). This trend persisted with increasing age; however, high deletion strains exhibited a somewhat slower
rate of decline in pharyngeal pumping rates compared
to low and zero-deletion isolates (Tukey HSD, a = 0.05,
based on the difference in average pumping rate
between days 2 and 20 post-L4; Figure 4). This may
mean that high deletion isolates experience late-life
reductions in their rates of aging compared to other isolates. Finally, we found significant natural variation in
adult pharyngeal pumping rates throughout early but

3 replicate counts for each of group of animals. Pumping rates were

not late life (F-tests, p < 0.05 for time points prior to 14
days post-L4; analyses stopped after L4 + 20 days due to
the reduction in statistical power caused by mortality).
The magnitude of among-isolate differences in pumping
rates was greatest during the young adult stage (Table 1;
Figure 4) and declined slightly over the lifespan of the
worms. Interestingly, the sharp decline in mean pumping rates at 4 days post-L4 coincided with the end of
the reproductive period; this pattern is not observed in
the congener, C. elegans [e.g., [26], pers. obs.].
To further quantify natural phenotypic variation and
to test whether the observed relationships between fitness-related life history traits and ND5 deletion levels
may be mediated by mitochondrial ETC functioning, we
quantified the relationship between ND5 deletion level
and several aspects of animal physiology. Our expectation was that, as a result of reduced mitochondrial ETC
efficiency, higher-ND5 deletion isolates would exhibit
reduced levels of ATP and oxidative stress resistance,
together with increased ROS production compared to
lower or zero-ND5 deletion isolates.
Only some of the above expectations were borne out
by the data. We found significant among-isolate variation in average ATP content of young adult animals;
however, there was only a weak, nonsignificant negative
relationship between ATP content and ND5 deletion
frequency (Table 1, Figure 5A). If high-ND5 deletion
isolate, VT847 (Hawaii), which produced 6.379 ± 0.164
nM ATP/mg protein, was removed from the analysis,

Bars show one standard error. A second order quadratic provided
the best fit to the relationship between relative superoxide level

the correlation became more strongly negative (Pearson
r = -0.370, p = 0.001). ATP production is known from
other studies to sometimes be robust to ETC dysfunction; however, these data highlight the need to understand the degree to which nematodes may rely on
alternate energy production pathways [28-30], which
could obfuscate any pattern between ATP level and
ND5 deletion frequency, for example.
We found significant among-isolate variation for oxidative stress resistance as measured by survival times of
worms during acute paraquat exposure (Table 1). We
predicted that, if higher-ND5 deletion isolates experience mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased
endogenous ROS levels, these isolates would be less able
to survive attack from exogenous sources of ROS.
A weak but significant negative relationship existed
between this form of oxidative stress resistance and

Page 5 of 8

ND5 deletion frequency (Table 1). This pattern was largely driven by two low-ND5 deletion isolates (PB800
and JU726) with high oxidative stress resistance (data
not shown). We currently have no information on
whether C. briggsae isolates vary in their expression of
antioxidant proteins and thus in their abilities to detoxify ROS, which would provide one possible explanation
for the weak relationship between paraquat-induced oxidative stress resistance and ND5 deletion heteroplasmy
level.
Finally, relative ROS levels measured for pharyngeal
bulbs also varied significantly among C. briggsae isolates
(Table 1; Figure 5B). We measured total levels of mitochondrial oxidants using MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen).
MitoSOX Red is preferentially taken up by actively
respiring mitochondria, and while it is nearly exclusively
oxidized by superoxide [31,32]–the most common form
of mitochondrially generated ROS–it is considered an
accurate and effective system for measuring total ROS
levels in vivo [32]. In contrast to our simple expectation
that a positive, linear relationship would exist between
ND5 deletion frequency and ROS level, we found a significant, non-linear relationship between these variables
such that zero and high deletion isolates tended to exhibit higher superoxide levels than low deletion isolates
(Figure 5B legend). The in vivo fluorogenic dye-based
method used here gives a view of net ROS level in living
tissue and therefore reflects both the rate at which ROS
are generated by cells and the rate at which they are
scavenged by superoxide dismutases and other antioxidant systems. Consequently, we do not yet know which
of these sources of variability explain more of the variance in net ROS levels among isolates, which was considerable despite modest sample sizes (Table 1). This
variation suggests that C. briggsae may provide a useful
system in which to test whether endogenous ROS have
a role in generating variability in spontaneous mutation
rates [33].
Thus, while more work is required to understand
whether and how the ND5 deletion directly affects mitochondrial functioning in C. briggsae, it is clear that there
is no simple relationship between isolate-specific net
ROS production and the detrimental phenotypes associated with high ND5 deletion heteroplasmy levels in
nature. For example, both Japanese isolates, HK104 and
HK105, exhibit low fitness (Figure 2) and pharyngeal
pumping rates (Figure 4), but their relative levels of
superoxide (and ATP) are quite different from one
another (Figure 5). These results may indicate that
C. briggsae isolates experience different forms of mitochondrial dysfunction [Figure 3 in [34]] that may or
may not be related directly to the ND5 deletion.
The limited molecular population genetic structuring
of C. briggsae [[35], but see [5]] belies the striking

Estes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/11

phenotypic variation among isolates reported here, the
latter of which suggests an immense capacity for evolution of aging and life-history phenotypes. Together with
previous findings of geographic variation in mitochondrial genome content among C. briggsae isolates [10]
and of elevated spontaneous mutation rates in some isolates relative to the C. elegans N2 lab strain [6,19,20],
the findings from this paper suggest that C. briggsae will
provide an opportunity to understand the linkages
between mitochondrial function (e.g., ROS production),
mutation processes, and aging. And importantly, because
C. briggsae contains naturally-occurring mtDNA variation that is likely to affect organismal fitness, this system
offers a major advantage for studying the evolutionary
dynamics of mtDNA mutations over C. elegans where
the majority of mtDNA mutant strains have been isolated
from laboratory mutagenesis screens.

Conclusions
Although we found no straightforward relationship
between ND5 deletion frequency and relative ROS
levels, our accumulated findings are consistent with the
notion that the natural mitochondrial genetic variation
observed among C. briggsae isolates is detrimental to
the organism. This is particularly true in light of recent
studies that show high mutation rates in high-ND5
C. briggsae isolates [6,19,20], Nevertheless, two issues
prevent us from demonstrating that the ND5 deletion is
the root cause of the detrimental phenotypes: 1) ND5
deletion level is clearly confounded with phylogenetic
relationship (e.g., two of our three “high-deletion” isolates are sister taxa from Japan; Figure 1), and 2) we
cannot disentangle the effects of among-isolate variation
in ND5 deletion level from among-isolate nuclear variation on the phenotypes studied here. However, the ability to generate inbred lines and mitochondrial-nuclear
hybrid strains in which mitochondria from natural
C. briggsae isolates with different ND5 deletion heteroplasmy levels may be evaluated on uniform nuclear
genetic backgrounds [36] will be a major advantage of
this nematode system. (A large-scale analysis of
such hybrid strains will be reported elsewhere.) A congener of the well-known model nematode, C. elegans, C. briggsae has a similar life-history and mating
system, and offers many of the same advantages as
C. elegans as an animal genetic model system [37].
Together with the ample among-isolate variation in
ND5 deletion heteroplasmy level (Figure 1B) [10] and
aging-related phenotypes, we contend that the C. briggsae system offers a powerful and versatile model for
understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and aging in an evolutionary context, as well as
the basic biology underlying mtDNA deletion genetics.
This study lays the necessary groundwork to rigorously

test these and other questions in aging biology and life
history theory [e.g., [38]].

Methods
Nematode strains and culture conditions

As described in [10], the ΨND5-2 pseudogene directly
upstream of ND5 (Figure 1A) is required for the ND5
deletions to occur within C. briggsae. Directly repeated
nucleotide sequences occur within ND5 and ΨND5-2
that promote direct repeat-associated deletion events.
Isolates in the “Kenya” clade (Figure 1B) provide natural
outgroup controls because they lack ΨND5-2 and are
thus inherently unable to experience the ND5 deletions.
The among-isolate variability in average heteroplasmy
level is thought to also be partly accounted for by the
presence of compensatory sequences within the mtDNA
of certain populations (Figure 1B legend). These
sequences, present at the ΨND5-2 direct repeat associated with the deletions, appear to prevent the deletion
by reducing sequence homology between ΨND5-2 and
ND5 and to thereby place an upper limit on the proportion of ND5-deletion bearing genomes able to accumulate within individuals [10]. We chose to use a subset of
nine natural C. briggsae isolates studied by [10] that captured the full range of ND5 deletion heteroplasmy level
(Figure 1, Additional file 1, Table S1). All nematodes
were grown under standard laboratory conditions on 15
mm plates with NGM and Escherichia coli strain
HB101. All nine natural isolates were included in each
analysis.
Life-history assays

Isolate-specific fecundities were estimated for each natural isolate following [39]. ‘’Early fecundity’’ is the number of offspring produced on the first two days of
reproduction combined; ‘’late fecundity’’ is the number
of offspring produced on the third and fourth days of
reproduction. We also calculated total lifespan as the
number of days lived from the egg stage. We calculated
intrinsic rate of increase, r, for each natural isolate by
solving Σe*** l(x) m(x) for r, where l(x) is the proportion
of worms surviving to day x and m(x) is the fecundity
on day x. We also quantified average correlations
among life history traits across C. briggsae isolates to
investigate whether the magnitude or pattern of these
trait associations would change with increasing ND5
deletion frequency.
Pharyngeal pumping

We measured the decline of pharyngeal pumping rate
with age among C. briggsae isolates. Caenorhabditid
nematodes ingest soil bacteria using rhythmic contractions of the pharynx - a neuromuscular organ comprising 20 muscle cells and 20 neurons. As in humans,

Estes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/11

muscle organization and function in nematodes deteriorates with chronological age. The rate of pharyngeal
pumping is known to decline steadily with age in
C. elegans as a result of contraction-related cellular injury
[27,40]. Pharyngeal pumping was quantified for the same
10 to 20 individuals per isolate beginning two days after
the L4 stage, and every other day until death. Daily pharyngeal pumping rates were taken as the average of three
5-second counts, converted to pumps per minute.
ATP content

ATP content was measured using a protocol adapted
from [[41], B. Braeckman, pers. comm.] for 8-10 independent, age-synchronous samples of young adult nematodes from each isolate. ATP content was determined
for 50 uL of supernatant using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. ATP measurements were
standardized by total protein content using a BCA Kit
(Pierce).
Oxidative stress resistance

We measured resistance of C. briggsae to acute paraquat
exposure following [42]. Age-synchronized populations
of post-reproductive (8 day old) worms were generated
for each natural isolate. Sixteen individuals per isolate
were exposed to 300 mM paraquat in S-basal and
scored for survival every 5 minutes. Worms that
remained completely unresponsive after three taps with
a glass prod were scored as dead.

Although the use of mitochondria-specific dyes has
become a widely used and accepted method for measuring
a variety of mitochondrial traits in vivo, a caveat is that differential dye uptake between samples could lead to inaccurate interpretation of fluorescence differences. There is
currently no means of determining the extent to which
this occurs [31]. However, great care was taken to minimize all other sources of error. For example, we exposed
only one sample at a time to the microscope light source
and used the shortest exposure time possible to avoid
introducing variation due to breakdown of the dye.
Statistical analyses

We analyzed among-isolate variation using separate
one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) for each phenotype measured. To test for differences between pairs of
isolates, least-squares contrasts (Tukey’s HSD for all
pairwise comparisons; [43]) were performed on the data
for each trait. To test for associations between traits and
ND5 deletion levels, we calculated Pearson correlation
coefficients between trait values and isolate-specific ND5
deletion percentages, and applied one-way ANOVA to
data categorized as being from high, low, or zero-ND5
deletion isolates (see Figure 1B legend). Finally, we characterized correlations among life-history characters measured on the same individuals by calculating Spearman
rank correlation coefficients between each pair of traits
following [26].

We followed the basic approach of [31] to quantify relative ROS levels among C. briggsae isolates. Briefly, agesynchronized worms were incubated for 24 hours in 10
uM MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen) before being transferred
as young adults to fresh NGM plates seeded with nonlabeled HB101 E. coli. They were allowed to feed for 1
hour, and paralyzed using a drop of 5M levamisole prior
to imaging. Images were acquired using a high resolution wide field Core DV system (Applied Precision™),
equipped with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope
mounted with a Nikon Coolsnap ES2 HQ camera
(Advanced Light Microscopy Core Facility, Oregon
Health and Science University, Portland, OR). Fluorescent, z-stack images of the mitochondrial-rich pharynx
with a 1.0 second exposure time were captured at 60X
magnification. Images were deconvolved prior to analysis. Terminal pharyngeal bulbs were manually circled to
quantify mean fluorescence intensity of the area in
exposed and unexposed (control) animals for each strain
using ImageJ software (NIH). The final pharyngeal bulb
intensity values were calculated as the difference
between intensity values for exposed and control worms.
