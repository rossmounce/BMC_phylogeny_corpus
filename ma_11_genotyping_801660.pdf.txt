of the HBV DNA polymerase gene in Shenyang,
China

Abstract
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been classified into eight genotypes (A-H) based on intergenotypic divergence of at
least 8% in the complete nucleotide sequence or more than 4% in the S gene. To facilitate the investigation of the
relationship between the efficacy of drug treatment and the mutation with specific genotype of HBV, we have
established a new genotyping strategy based on a fragment of the HBV DNA polymerase gene. Pairwise sequence
and phylogenetic analyses were performed using CLUSTAL V (DNASTAR) on the eight (A-H) standard full-length
nucleotide sequences of HBV DNA from GenBank (NCBI) and the corresponding semi-nested PCR products from
the HBV DNA polymerase gene. The differences in the semi-nested PCR fragments of the polymerase genes
among genotypes A through F were greater than 4%, which is consistent with the intergenotypic divergence of at
least 4% in HBV DNA S gene sequences. Genotyping using the semi-nested PCR products of the DNA polymerase
genes revealed that only genotypes B, C, and D were present in the 50 cases, from Shenyang, China, with a
distribution of 11 cases (22%), 25 cases (50%), and 14 cases (28%) respectively. These results demonstrate that our
new genotyping method utilizing a fragment of the HBV DNA polymerase gene is valid and can be employed as a
general genotyping strategy in areas with prevalent HBV genotypes A through F. In Shenyang, China, genotypes C,
B, and D were identified with this new genotyping method, and genotype C was demonstrated to be the
dominant genotype.
Keywords: Hepatitis B virus, polymerase gene, mutation, genotype

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a substantial public
health problem, with approximately 400 million virus
carriers worldwide [1]. The infection can cause acute
and chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. HBV has been classified
into eight genotyped, designated as A-H, based on intergenotypic divergence of at least 8% in the complete
nucleotide sequence or more than 4% in the S gene
[2-8]. HBV genotypes have distinct geographical distributions and correlate with the severity of liver diseases.
HBV genotype C is associated with more severe liver
diseases than genotype B [9-11], and patients infected

with genotype D appear to have a higher incidence of
HCC [12], a higher risk for HBV recurrence, and a
higher mortality rate after liver transplantation [13] than
patients with genotype A. In addition, patients with
HBV genotypes C and D have a lower response rate to
treatment with IFN-a compared to those with genotypes
A and B [9]. Genotype may also influence the emergence of lamivudine resistance mutations, which appear
to be more strongly associated with genotype A than
genotype D [14,15]. Therefore, HBV genotyping is of
great importance in guiding treatment, improving vaccination, and controlling liver diseases.
In the past, genotyping was mostly performed on the
full-length nucleotide sequence or the S gene sequence
[2-8]. In order to facilitate the study of drug treatments,
particularly how lamivudine resistance develops from
polymerase gene mutations [14,15], we established a
new genotyping method using a fragment of the HBV

DNA polymerase gene that also slightly overlaps with
the S gene. This genotyping method differs from past
methods and aids in investigating the relationship
between the efficacy of drug treatment and muations in
specific genotypes of HBV.

Methods
Serum sample collection

Serum samples were collected with consent from
patients and in accordance with Chinese State Ethics
Regulation. This study included 33 patients with chronic
hepatitis B with clinical symptoms (22 males, 11
females, mean age 31.79 years) that were to receive antivirus treatment of lamivudine and 20 asymptomatic carriers (12 males, 8 females, mean age 29.5 years) that
were enrolled as a control group. Chronic infection was
defined as the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) for at least 6 months. Among these samples,
we found no co-infections with either human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus. All patients were
born in Shenyang, China. The serum samples were collected and stored at -70°C.
Primer design

The genome of HBV consists of four open reading
frames, including the envelope gene (PreS/S), the core
gene (PreC/C), the polymerase gene, and the gene
encoding the transactivating protein X (X). Because of
the compact organization of the genome, the complete
PreS/S gene, part of the PreC/C gene and the X gene
overlap with the polymerase gene. The S gene (nucleotides 155 to 833) encodes the major envelope proteins
[16,17].
With the aid of DNASTAR software, we designed
three primers to the sequence of the HBV DNA polymerase gene (accession number AF100309), named
HBV381 (nt381-402), HBV840 (nt840-861), and
HBV801 (nt801-822). The primers were synthesized
(TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) with the
sequences of 5"-TGCGGCGTTTTATCATCTTCCT-3”,
5"-GTTTAAATGTATACCCAAAGAC-3”, and 5"CAGCGGCATAAAGGGACTCAAG-3”, respectively.
Two pairs of semi-nested polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) primers (HBV381/HBV840 and HBV381/
HBV801) were utilized in the amplification reaction
while primer HBV381 was used in the sequencing reaction. The amplified fragment of the polymerase gene
overlaps slightly with the S gene.
Polymerase gene fragment amplification and sequencing

HBV DNA was extracted from 55 serum samples
obtained from infected patients. The fragment of the
polymerase gene was amplified by semi-nested PCR
with two rounds of amplification. The reaction volume

Page 2 of 6

was 50 μl. The first round of amplification was performed with an initial 5 min denaturing step at 94°C,
followed by 30 cycles of denaturing for 45 s at 94°C,
annealing for 30 s at 50°C, and elongation for 90 s at
72°C, with a final extension period of 10 min at 72°C
using primers HBV381 and HBV840. The second round
of amplification was performed with an initial 5 min
denaturing step at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing for 45 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 55°C, and
elongation for 60 s at 72°C, with a final extension period
of 10 min at 72°C using primers HBV381 and HBV801.
The reaction products of the semi-nested PCR were
visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium
bromide. The semi-nested PCR reaction products were
subjected to purification and sequencing using the
HBV381 primer through a commercial company
(Shanghai GeneCore Bio Technologies Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) on an ABI sequencing system.
Homology and phylogenetic analyses

The eight standard full-length nucleotide sequences of
HBV DNA were obtained from GenBank (NCBI),
including genotypes A (accession number AY128092), B
(AB073858), C (AF461359), D (AY090453), E (X75664),
F (X75663), G (AF405706), and H (AY090460). Nucleotide sequences of approximately 262 base pairs (bp)
from the primer HBV381 were used for homology and
phylogenic analysis. The eight standard nucleotide
sequences of the HBV DNA genotypes, the predicted
sequence of the semi-nested PCR products, and the
actual sequences of the products were analyzed in pairs
using CLUSTAL V (DNASTAR).
Statistical analysis

The genotyping data were analyzed using a c2 test (SAS
software, Cary, NC).

Results
Most HBV patients screen positive for the HBV
polymerase gene by semi-nested PCR

The purpose of the semi-nested PCR was to screen for
polymerase gene-positive patients. The PCR reaction
products were the expected size (415 bp, Figure 1). In
total, 50 samples (91%) were positive for polymerase
gene fragments, 17 (85%) of which were from asymptomatic carriers and 33 (100%) of which were from
patients with chronic hepatitis B. All the positive seminested PCR reaction products were then sequenced.

which was the smallest among all the genotypic differences. The largest difference in nucleotide sequence was
found between genotypes B and H and between genotypes G and H, both of which were 15.9% (Figure 2a,
Table 1). The results were consistent with an intergenotypic divergence of at least 8% in the complete nucleotide sequence [2-7]. Homology and phylogenetic analysis
of the semi-nested PCR fragments (262 bp) from the
DNA polymerase genes of the standard strains revealed

that the differences between genotypes A and G, B and
G, and F and H were 3.5%, 3.1%, and 3.1%, respectively
(Figure 2b, Table 2). However, all the other differences
between pairs of genotypes (A-F), such as between genotypes A and B, A and C, B and C, etc., were greater
than 4%, consistent with an intergenotypic divergence of
at least 4% in HBV DNA S gene sequences [8].

HBV genome have been developed, including restriction
fragment length polymorphism [18], multiplex PCR with
type-specific primers [19-21], and others. However, most
of these newer methods are based on analyzing the S gene.
Here we have developed a novel genotyping method based
on a segment of the HBV DNA polymerase gene. Using
CLUSTAL V, we demonstrated that the eight standard
genotypes selected from the GenBank (NCBI) had intergenotypic divergence of at least 8% in their complete nucleotide sequences [2-7]. We then confirmed that the seminested PCR products from the DNA polymerase gene had
intergenotypic divergence of at least 4%, which is in accordance with the HBV DNA S gene sequence [8], except
between genotypes A and G, B and G, and F and H. However, the intergenotypic divergence among genotypes A
through F were higher than 4% in our selected region.
Genotypes F and H have only been detected in Central
and South America, and genotype G has been identified in
France, Germany, Mexico, and the United States. Genotype A is more prevalent in northwestern Europe, North
America, India, and sub-Saharan Africa. Only genotypes
B, C, D, and A have been found in China [22-30]. Therefore, the fragment of HBV DNA polymerase gene can be
used for genotyping hepatitis B in China. This genotyping
method can also be used to predict antiviral therapeutic
response among HBV genotypes and the development of
drug resistant due to mutations. It is a valuable tool for
guiding the treatment of lamivudine-resistant HBV in the
clinical setting [27-30].
We analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the seminested PCR products of the HBV DNA polymerase gene
in the 50 patient samples using CLUSTAL V. Genotypes
C, B and D were detected while genotypes A, E, F, G,
and H were not. Half of the HBV DNA polymerasepositive samples were genotype C, making it the dominant genotype. It was also the major genotype (55%) in
the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis B. The differences
in the proportions of genotypes B, C, and D were not
significant in the 17 asymptomatic carriers of HBV. The
proportion of genotype D was similar to genotype B,
and its proportion in asymptomatic carriers of HBV was
slightly, but not significantly (p = 0.410), higher than

that in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Our results
suggest that genotype C is the dominant genotype
among asymptomatic carriers and that genotype D may
be more frequent in asymptomatic carriers than in
patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Conclusions
A new method of genotyping HBV via sequencing a fragment of its DNA polymerase gene is a valid strategy for
genotyping hepatitis B in areas with a high prevalence of
genotypes A through F. It provides a novel alternative to
complete sequencing of the HBV genome and allows the
study of the relationship between genotype and mutations of HBV DNA polymerase gene induced by antiviral
therapy. Using this method, genotypes C, B, and D were
identified in patients from Shenyang, China, and genotype C was demonstrated to be the dominant genotype.
However, analysis of the difference in the proportions of
the genotypes between asymptomatic carriers of HBV
and patients with chronic hepatitis B, as well as the
impact of genotype on therapeutic response and virus
mutation, require further study.
