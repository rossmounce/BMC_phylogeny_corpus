Abstract
Background: Most of the existing RNA structure prediction programs fold a completely
synthesized RNA molecule. However, within the cell, RNA molecules emerge sequentially during
the directed process of transcription. Dedicated experiments with individual RNA molecules have
shown that RNA folds while it is being transcribed and that its correct folding can also depend on
the proper speed of transcription.
Methods: The main aim of this work is to study if and how co-transcriptional folding is encoded
within the primary and secondary structure of RNA genes. In order to achieve this, we study the
known primary and secondary structures of a comprehensive data set of 361 RNA genes as well
as a set of 48 RNA sequences that are known to differ from the originally transcribed sequence
units. We detect co-transcriptional folding by defining two measures of directedness which quantify
the extend of asymmetry between alternative helices that lie 5' and those that lie 3' of the known
helices with which they compete.
Results: We show with statistical significance that co-transcriptional folding strongly influences
RNA sequences in two ways: (1) alternative helices that would compete with the formation of the
functional structure during co-transcriptional folding are suppressed and (2) the formation of
transient structures which may serve as guidelines for the co-transcriptional folding pathway is
encouraged.
Conclusions: These findings have a number of implications for RNA secondary structure
prediction methods and the detection of RNA genes.

Background
Most of the existing computational methods for RNA secondary structure prediction fold an already completely
synthesized RNA molecule. This is done either by minimizing its free energy (e.g. done by MFOLD [1-3] and by
the programs of the VIENNA package [4-8]) or by maximizing the probability under a model whose parameters
can incorporate a variety of different sources of information, e.g. comparative information, free energy and evolu-

tionary information (e.g. [9], TRNASCAN-SE [10], PFOLD
[11,12] and QRNA [13]). All of these programs, including
those that predict folding pathways by folding an already
synthesized RNA sequence [14,15], therefore disregard
the effects that co-transcriptional folding may have on the
RNA's functional secondary structure. They essentially
aim to predict the thermodynamic RNA structure, i.e. the
secondary structure that minimizes the free energy of the
molecule. However, theoretical studies of RNA molecules

[16] indicate that the thermodynamic structure of even
moderately long RNA molecules need not necessarily correspond to the functional structure which confers the
desired functionality within the organism to the RNA
molecule.
RNA molecules are known to fold as they emerge during
transcription [17,18]. Transcription is a directed process
of variable speed, during which the 5' end of the RNA
molecule is synthesized before its 3' end. Hydrogenbonds at the 5' end of the RNA molecule can thus form
earlier in time than hydrogen-bonds involving the 3' end
of the molecule. The thus emerging secondary structure
elements can be transient or not, depending on their stability, their formation times and the availability and stability of competing alternative pairing partners. The
directedness and also the speed of transcription can influence both the folding pathway and the functional secondary structure of the RNA molecule. We call this
phenomenon sequential or co-transcriptional folding and
call the resulting secondary structure the kinetic structure of
the RNA molecule.
Co-transcriptional folding leads to the formation of temporary secondary structure elements [18,19]. The time
that it takes to form and replace these transitory structure
elements may successively narrow down the set of accessible folding pathways and may thereby guide the folding
towards an ensemble of secondary structures which contains the desired functional secondary structure. However,
these temporary secondary structure elements can also
have distinct biological functions, e.g. in viroids [19] and
as initial sites for protein anchoring during pre-mRNA
transcription [20]. Based on experimental and theoretical
investigations, Harlepp et. al. [21] and Isambert et. al. [22]
found that temporary structures may form during transcription. All these results suggest that temporary secondary structure elements may play an important role in the
correct folding of RNA sequences.
The speed of transcription also has an effect on folding
which can be investigated by varying the nucleoside triphosphate concentration [19] or by transcribing RNA
genes with viral polymerase T7 which has faster elongation during transcription than bacterial polymerases
[23,24]. Both decreasing and increasing the natural speed
of transcription can yield inactive transcripts [23,24].
Recent in vitro investigations of the Tetrahymena ribozyme
[25] show that its co-transcriptional folding in vitro is
twice as fast as the refolding of the entire RNA molecule
under the same conditions and that both lead to the same
functional folding. Moreover, they find that the co-transcriptional folding in vitro is still much slower than in vivo.

Among the multitude of biochemical processes which are
known to occur transcriptionally [26,27], some processes
act in order to prevent the mis-folding of RNA molecules.
RNA chaperones are proteins which are believed to help
refold mis-folded RNA structures by promoting intermolecular RNA-RNA annealing through non-specific interaction [28]. Without RNA chaperones, moderately long GCrich helices have dissociation half-times of up to 100 years
[29]. This time can be significantly reduced by RNA chaperones, which preferentially bind stretches of unfolded
RNA and thereby decrease the kinetic barrier between the
correct and incorrect secondary structure elements [28].
Specific RNA-binding proteins are also known to promote
RNA folding by either guiding its folding or stabilizing its
correct structure [30,31]. The hnRNP proteins non-specifically bind pre-messenger RNA and help in the splicing
process [32].
RNA sequences can also promote the proper folding of
other RNA sequences. It is known, for example, that the
temporary interaction with highly conserved leader
sequences of bacterial rRNA-operons is needed for the
proper formation of 30S ribosomal subunits and the maturation of 16S rRNA [33,34].
All these experimental and the few theoretical findings
suggest that co-transcriptional folding may play an important role in the correct folding of RNA molecules. They
also show that the functional structure may only be a transient one which is available during a certain time span and
that the functional structure need not correspond to the
structure which would dominate the ensemble of structures after an infinite time span.
Little is known whether co-transcriptional folding is
mainly governed by the specific or non-specific binding of
proteins (or other molecules) which target the emerging
RNA or whether the primary structure of the RNA molecule itself conveys the desired properties to guide its own
correct co-transcriptional folding.
In this paper, we propose several statistics in order to
detect, if and how co-transcriptional folding influences
RNA sequences. Using these statistics, we show that the
effects of co-transcriptional folding are widespread in
RNA genes.

Methods
Theory
We want to show that an RNA sequence is organized in
such a way to help the formation of the functional secondary structure during transcription. We aim to support this
hypothesis by detecting two different features:

Page 2 of 10

BMC Molecular Biology 2004, 5:10

• Possible competitors of helices in the functional
structure are suppressed. When the 3' end of a helix that
is part of the final secondary structure emerges during
transcription, the number of possible competitors for the
5' part of the helix should be as low as possible in order to
promote the formation of the correct helix.
• The folding pathway is engineered. During transcription, several temporary helices are formed which may
guide the folding process.
We investigate these features using several statistics which
are based on the known primary and secondary structures
of our RNA sequences. A crucial point in investigating
these features is to define a set of statistics that have expectation of zero in the H0 case, when we suppose no co-transcriptional folding. However, verifying that these statistics
have an expectation value of zero in the H0 case cannot
simply be achieved by analyzing random sequences.
Indeed, even generating random sequences is not trivial.
First, it is hard to reliably predict the minimum free energy
structure for the randomized sequences as most secondary
structure prediction algorithms discard pseudo-knots and,
even without pseudo-knots, predict only on average about
70 % of the base-pairs correctly. In addition, there is no
guarantee that the secondary structure with the lowest free
energy would correspond to the functional one. Second,
even if the random sequences are generated by a shuffling
algorithm which keeps the given secondary structure
fixed, it cannot be guaranteed that the fixed structure
remains the correct one for the new primary sequence.
Generating random sequences therefore provides no
straightforward solution for obtaining a H0 statistics with
expectation value zero.
We circumvent this problem by studying pairs of statistics,
where both statistics have the same, unknown expectation
value in the H0 case and where one statistics has a bias
away from the H0 expectation value in case of co-transcriptional folding, while the other statistics is not affected by
co-transcriptional folding. By studying the difference of
these two statistics, we thus gain a new statistics with
expectation value zero in the case of no co-transcriptional
folding and an expectation value larger or smaller than
zero in the case of co-transcriptional folding.
The statistics (which we will define in detail below) measure the presence of alternative helices which compete for
at least one base-pair with the helices of the known secondary structure. These competing alternative helices are
required to consists of at least minstem = 9 consecutive basepairs of type {G - C, C - G, A - U, U - A, G - U, U - G} and
are calculated by a dynamic programming procedure in
which the known primary and secondary structure of the
RNA is fixed, see Figure 1 for the definition of a compet-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/5/10

ing, alternative helix. We checked that we obtain qualitatively similar results for smaller and larger minstem values
(data not shown). While calculating all helices of at least
minstem length, we test which of these helices constitute
competing alternatives to helices of the known secondary
structure and record each such competing case in one of
our statistics. These alternative helices may be part of a
pseudo-knotted structure and we do not discard them. As
each of the two bases i and i of a base-pair in a known
helix can have a competing alternative base-pairing partner within an alternative helix and as this alternative partner can either be found 5' (before), 3' (behind) or
between the two strands of the known helix, all cases can
be classified into six different classes. Of these six, we discard the two classes where the alternative helix falls
between the two strands of the known helix as this unpaired loop region is typically too short to accommodate
an alternative helix of at least minstem length. The remaining four classes, see Figure 2, can be sub-divided into two
cis- and two trans- alternative classes, depending on
whether the known base-pairing partners lie between the
alternative base-pairing partners (trans) or not (cis). The
four statistics 3'cis, 3'trans, 5'cis and 5'trans that we use correspond to these four classes.
It is important to note that even without co-transcriptional folding, the destabilizing effects of competing cisand trans-alternative helices are not necessarily the same
as the stacking energies are not symmetric with respect to
the 5' → 3' direction of the RNA sequence [3]. In addition,
alternative cis-pairing partners are closer to the known
pairing partners than trans-pairing partners and may thus
lead more easily to incorrect helices. We may therefore
compare only cis-competitors with other cis-competitors
and trans-competitors with other trans-competitors. This
yields two possible comparisons: 3'trans versus 5'trans and
5'cis versus 3'cis, see Figure 2, with which we can measure
the effects of co-transcriptional folding.
We proceed as follows to detect if co-transcriptional folding takes place: For every RNA sequence of the data set, we
detect events of type 3'cis, 3'trans, 5'cis and 5'trans, where
an alternative helix competes with a known helix. Each
such event is given two different weights, see Table 1 for
an overview of definitions: (1) a weight of 1/ (d·log(l)),
where d is the distance between the two competing helices
and l is the length of the sub-sequence 5' or 3' of the
known helix on which the competing helix falls, or (2) a
weight of |G| / (d·log(l)), where the former weight is multiplied by the absolute value of the free energy G of the
competing, alternative helix. The factor 1/d gives alternative helices that are far away from the known helix a
smaller weight than closer ones. The factor 1/log (l)
accounts for the fact that log (l) is proportional to the
expected sum of 1/d statistics for a sub-sequence of length

G in the second type of weights gives stable alternative
helices which have a larger impact on the folding pathway
a greater weight than helices which are easily unfolded.
Statistics derived from weights of type 1/(d log(l)) are
denoted by an index p (for plain) and those of type |G| /
(d·log(l)) by an index g (for free energy). By summing the
weighted counts for each of the four classes of events, we
thus arrive at eight different scalar values which characterize each RNA sequence: 3'Transx, 3'Cisx, 5'Transx and 5'Cisx
for x ∈ {p,g}.
We can now define the two statistics which are capable of
measuring the two main types of asymmetry within each
RNA sequence:

effects are indicated by an expectation value larger than
zero for the respective statistics.
Without co-transcriptional folding, the introduced statistics have an expectation of zero, moreover, the distributions should be symmetric. The number of positive cases
(pos) thus follows a binomial distribution with parameter
p = 0.5 and the statistic

pos − 0.5 ⋅ n
0.5 ⋅ 0.5 ⋅ n
where n is the number of all cases, approximately follows
a standard normal distribution. If this value is sufficiently
positive, we have to reject the hypothesis that co-transcriptional folding is not encoded within RNA genes.

Cis := 5'Cis - 3'Cis
Trans := 3'Trans - 5'Trans
which can calculate for both types of weights. Without cotranscriptional folding, the expectation value of these two
statistics is zero. Co-transcriptional folding induces two
types of asymmetries by suppressing the number of alternative helices which compete with the final helices (indicated by an increased number of iic configurations, see
Figure 2) and by promoting the formation of transient
helices which guide the correct folding (indicated by an
increased number of cii configurations). Both types of

intron [37]. Other species only rarely have introns in
rRNA genes, however, some 16S rRNA introns are known
[38].
rRNA genes in bacteria are encoded in the so-called rrnoperon (see for example [39]). The canonical order of
rRNA genes in the rrn-operon is 16S-23S-5S, but some
exceptions to this rule are known. In Vibrio harvey, the
order is 23S-16S-5S [40], but not in Vibrio cholerae [41]
and Vibrio parahaemolyticus [42], whose 16S rRNA
sequences were downloaded from the Comparative RNA
Web Site.
We divided the gathered sequences into two sets: data set
A which consists of all RNA sequences that are thought to
correspond to the originally transcribed sequence units
and data set B which contains all those RNA sequences
that are known to differ from the originally transcribed
sequence units. Data set B thus contains the Group I and

II intron sequences, organellar and hyperthermophilic
bacteria 23S RNA sequences. As we neither know the
sequence nor the secondary structure of the original transcript units from which the sequences of data set B were
derived, we are limited to detecting the effects of co-transcriptional folding within these shorter sequences. We
expect this to be much more difficult than in sequences
that correspond to the originally transcribed sequence
units as co-transcriptional folding introduces long range
effects which are harder to detect the shorter the investigated sub-sequence gets. See Table 2 for a detailed overview of the composition of each data set.

Results
We calculated the 3'Cisx, 3'Transx, 5'Cisx and 5'Transx values for both types of weights, i.e. x ∈ {p,g}, for each
sequence in the two data sets. From these values we then
derived each sequence's Cisx and Transx values, again for

A Cis value larger zero means that configurations of type

cii outnumber those of type iic , see Figure 2. The formation of potential transient helices involving base-pairs
between c and i that can later yield to the final secondary
structure element containing the base-pair between i and
i thus seems to be encouraged. However, these transient
Page 7 of 10

BMC Molecular Biology 2004, 5:10

structure elements may not be too stable if they are to
guide rather than impede the proper folding. The presence
of transient helices could thus be further substantiated by
showing that these transient helices are less stable than
the final helix. In contrast to the cii configuration, the
competing ic helices in the iic case are suppressed as they
lie 3' of the final ii helix and thus emerge later in time
during co-transcriptional folding. A Cis value larger than
zero can therefore be explained by the presence of temporary helices which may guide the formation of the final,
functional secondary structure during co-transcriptional
folding.
A Trans value larger than zero means that cii configurations are less frequent than iic configurations, see Figure
2. In the cii configuration, both c and i are competing
pairing partners for i as they both emerge before i during
transcription. This may lead to the formation of wrong ci
helices, whereas the order of pairing partners in the iic
configuration has a lower risk of mis-folding due the c
emerging only after the i and thus only after the ii helix
could have already formed.
In addition, 3'Trans > 3'Cis in Table 3 can be interpreted
as a stabilization of the final, functional secondary structure. Imagine that the hydrogen bounds of the ii or ii
helix temporarily break up. In the case of the 3'Trans configuration, the pairing partners come in the order iic
along the RNA sequence, whereas they come in the order

iic in the 3'Cis configuration. In the iic order, the c part
is in vicinity to the i part, so the possibility of ending up
with a wrong refolding due to a ic helix is larger than in
the iic case.
Overall, we can thus conclude from the average values in
Table 3, that the sequences of data set A are tailored
towards co-transcriptional folding, whereas we cannot
reliably detect the effects of co-transcriptional folding
within data set B. We detected co-transcriptional folding
in data set A by showing that the final secondary structure
is actively stabilized (3'Trans > 3'Cis), that the formation
of temporary helices may guide the structure formation
and that these helices may thus be used to actively engineer a folding pathway (Cis >0) and that secondary structure elements which may interfere with the formation of
the final, functional secondary structure during co-transcriptional folding are suppressed (Trans >0).
In order to quantify the influence of co-transcriptional
folding further, we calculated two statistics, a t-test for the
hypothesis that the given statistics have an expectation

value of zero as well as the p-value of the number of positive cases for our two co-transcriptional folding indicators, see Table 4. The high p-values for data set B imply
that the presence of co-transcriptional folding is not well
supported in this data set. However, the corresponding
indicators strongly support co-transcriptional folding
within data set A.

Discussion
Recent experimental studies [23,24,19] have shown that
the proper speed of transcription helps the correct folding
of RNA molecules. In addition, theoretical studies [16]
indicate that the functional structure of an RNA need not
correspond to the minimum free energy structure, even
for moderately long RNA molecules. These findings suggest that co-transcriptional folding may play a decisive
role in the formation of functional RNA structures.
Although our statistics are able to reveal two general
effects of co-transcriptional folding within data set A, we
cannot conclude that they would be powerful enough to
serve as a reliable indicator of co-transcriptional folding
for single RNA sequences, as some of the sequences in
data set A may not correspond to the originally transcribed sequence units. In addition, all of our statistics
consider only a first order effect of co-transcriptional folding by studying alternative helices for the known helices,
but do not take higher order effects into account as e.g.
alternative helices of alternative helices etc.
Based on computer simulations, H. Isambert et. al. [43]
conjecture that pseudo-knotted motifs are common in cotranscriptional folding. Pseudo-knotted structures are
explicitly included in our statistics, as the corresponding
calculations naturally allow for alternative helices which
are part of a pseudo-knot and as we do not reject them.

Conclusions
To summarize, our findings show that co-transcriptional
folding is a guiding principle in the formation of functional RNA structure and that it can influence both the primary and potential secondary structures of an RNA
molecule. This has several implications. Current algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction can probably be improved by adopting co-transcriptional folding as
a guiding principle rather than only free energy minimization. This may hopefully provide the extra information
needed to be able to reliably detect RNA genes [44]. Several groups have already come up with computer algorithms which attempt to fold an RNA sequence cotranscriptionally [45-48,22]. These findings also have
implications for computational methods which infer the
phylogeny of RNA sequences, as these consider only coevolution within the base-pairs of the functional helices,
but discard any information due to the conservation of

folding pathways and may hence mis-estimate evolutionary times. Similar arguments hold for all comparative
studies that aim to detect functional secondary structure
elements, since co-evolution of nucleic acids does not necessarily imply that these nucleic acids are base-paired in
the final functional secondary structure. As evolution
probably not only selects for the correct functional secondary structure, but also for a suitable folding pathway,
it should be possible to detect the effects of co-transcriptional folding also in a comparative way.
Most importantly, co-transcriptional folding should lead
to a better understanding of how RNA sequences fold. This
should in turn enable us to also understand why some
RNA sequences mis-fold and fail to function properly in
the organism. Even though protein folding is known to
differ in many respects from RNA folding, they also have
some features in common [49]. One of the obvious similarities is that both proteins and RNA sequences are synthesized in a directional process. It would thus be
interesting to investigate if protein folding is also influenced by co-translational folding.
In this study, we neither attempted to study the effects that
co-transcriptional folding may have on sequences that are
transcribed together (e.g. genes in an operon) nor to study
the influence that the binding by proteins or RNA
sequences or RNA editing may have on the co-transcriptional folding pathway and the final, functional RNA
structure. This will almost certainly require more refined
investigation methods, but we hope that this study provides enough insight and motivation to start to tackle
these exciting questions.
