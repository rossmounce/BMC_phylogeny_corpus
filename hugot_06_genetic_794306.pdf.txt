Abstract
Sixty one tissue samples from several rodent species trapped in five provinces of Thailand were
examined for the presence of hantaviral markers by enzyme-immunoassay and immunoblotting.
Four samples, all from the great bandicoot rat Bandicota indica, were confirmed positive for the
hantaviral N-antigen. Two of them were trapped in Nakhon Pathom province, the other two in
Nakhon Ratchasima province, approximately 250 km from the other trapping site. When analysed
by RT-nested PCR, all four rodents were found positive for the hantaviral S- and M-segment
nucleotide sequences. Genetic analysis revealed that the four newly described wild-type strains
belong to Thailand hantavirus. On the phylogenetic trees they formed a well-supported cluster
within the group of Murinae-associated hantaviruses and shared a recent common ancestor with
Seoul virus.

Background
Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) are
robo (from rodent-borne) viruses that cause hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus (cardio)pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas
[1-3]. In nature, hantaviruses are carried by rodents of
family Muridae, and each hantavirus species is predominantly associated with a unique rodent host species.
Transmission of the virus to humans occurs by inhalation
of virus-infected aerosols from excreta of persistently
infected animals. Currently three groups of hantavirus

species are recognized [3-5]. The first group is associated
with Murinae rodents (mice and rats of the Old World).
The hantaviruses that belonged to the second group are
carried by Sigmodontinae rodents (mice and rats of the
New World). The third group is associated with Arvicolinae rodents (voles and lemmings of the north hemisphere) and includes viruses from Europe, Asia and North
America. In addition to these three groups, the list of
hantaviral species includes Thottapalayam, so far the only
hantavirus found in association with a shrew, Suncus murinus [6].

Since hantaviruses have been isolated from Murinae
rodents in North Asia and Europe, the association with
this particular group of hosts questions the presence of
hantaviruses in other parts of the World, and particularly
in South East Asia from where murine rodents are considered to originate and where more than 35 species of Murinae rodents are living [7]. Several hantaviruses have been
recorded from South-East Asia, particularly: THAIV discovered in 1994 [8] in Thailand from a great bandicoot
rat, Bandicota indica; and several hantavirus like isolated in
Cambodia from Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus [9]. Also,
serological surveys carried out to detect evidence of hantavirus in human populations or in wild rodents, revealed
positive samples in Thailand and Cambodia [9-12]. From
these preliminary results and after confirmation of a first
human case in Thailand [13] several questions arise: What
is the genetic diversity of the hantaviruses in South-East
Asia? What are the relationships of the South Asian hantaviruses with the others? What is the real importance of
hantaviruses for human health in this part of the World?
The answers to these questions clearly deal with the hantavirus biodiversity and phylogeny [4,5,14]. They also suppose that coordinated investigations might relate the
distribution of the hantaviruses in human populations
and in different rodent species.
The first aim of this study was to examine a set of tissue
samples from several rodent species trapped in Thailand,
for the presence of hantaviral markers. Since the hantaviral N-protein antigen was detected in samples from B.
indica, it was decided to attempt a recovery of viral
genome sequences (S and M segments) from the antigenpositive tissue samples and to perform a (phylo)genetic
analysis using these new data. So far, no complete THAIV
S-sequence has been described in the literature [1] but
while this work was in progress a complete THAIV Ssequence was deposited to Genbank. This sequence
belongs to a cell culture isolate 741, originating from
Thailand. Thus, our data presented an opportunity to
compare the newly recovered sequences of the wild-type
THAIV strains with that of a regular THAI isolate.

Materials and methods
Trapping/collection
Rodents were collected since 2004 during several field
studies in the following provinces of Thailand: Nakhon
Ratchasima, Sakhon Nakhon, Phrae, Nakhon Pathom
and Loei. Trapping was focused on species living in proximity to humans: domestic and peridomestic species, Rattus exulans, R. rattus, R. norvegicus, and the main wild
species occurring in agricultural areas, Bandicota indica
and B. savilei. The study was conducted in agricultural
areas including rice-growing rural villages either in seasonally flooded or non-flooded lands. Trapping and
processing were performed according to established safety

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/72

recommendations [15]. Animals were collected early in
the morning and transferred to a field laboratory. Geographical coordinates of the trapping places were systematically recorded. Species identification was done using a
regional taxonomic identification key [7]. Animals were
measured, weighted and pictured. Serum samples and
organs were stored in cryovials at -70°C.
Screening of rodent samples
Rodent lung tissue samples were screened by immunoblotting, for the presence of hantaviral N-antigen as
described earlier [16]. In brief, small chips of tissue
(approximately 100 mg) were placed into 500 mkl of Laemmli sample buffer and homogenized by sonication.
Aliquots of 10 mkl were separated by electrophoresis in
10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels and
blotted with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against
Dobrava virus. Goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated
with the horse radish peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used as secondary antibodies. A confirmatory
immunoblotting was performed with the rat anti-SEOV
antiserum [17]; in this case, rabbit anti-rat antibodies conjugated with the horseraddish peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used as secondary antibodies.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing
RNA was purified from N antigen- positive samples with
the TriPure reagent (Behringer Maannheim) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 100 mg- piece
of each lung tissue sample was ground in 1 ml of the
TriPure reagent and subjected to RNA extraction. RT-PCR
of the entire hantaviral S segment was performed essentially as described previously [18,19]. Partial sequences of
the S segment (nt 389–946) and the M segment (nt 2021–
2303) from wild-type THAIV strains were obtained by RTnested PCRs (sequences of primers are available upon
request). PCR-amplicons were gel-purified using
QIAquick Gel Extraction -kit (QIAGEN). PCR-amplicon
containing the entire S-sequences was cloned using the
pGEM-T cloning kit (Promega) and the plasmids were
purified with the QIAprep kit (QIAgen). PCR-amplicons
containing the partial S- and M-sequences were gel-purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction -kit (QIAGEN). The
plasmids and PCR-amplicons were sequenced automatically using either ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator or ABI
PRISM™ M13F and M13R Dye Primer sequencing kits
(Perkin Elmer/ABI, NJ). Multiple nucleotide and amino
sequence alignments were prepared manually using
SeqApp 1.9a169 sequence editing program. Hantavirus
sequences used for comparison were recovered from the
Gene Bank.

Phylogenetic analysis
To infer phylogenies, the PHYLIP program package [20]
was used first. 500 bootstrap replicates generated for complete coding sequences of the S segment, as well as partial
sequences of the S segment and the M segments (Seqboot
program) were fed to the distance matrice algorithm
(Dnadist program, with the F84-model for nucleotide
substitution). Distance matrices were analysed with the
Fitch-Margoliash tree-fitting algorithm (Fitch program);
the bootstrap support values were calculated with the
Consense program. The nucleotide sequence data were
also analysed with the Tree-Puzzle program [21]. The program implements a fast tree-searching algorithm (quartet
puzzling) that allows reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
by maximum likelihood. All trees were calculated with
10000 puzzling steps using Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
model of nucleotide substitutions. The transition/transversion ratio and the nucleotide frequencies were estimated from the data set. Uniformal model of rate
heterogeneity across sites was applied.

Results
Screening of rodents for the presence of hantaviral
markers
Altogether 61 rodents were trapped: 7 B. indica, 27 B.
savilei, 24 Rattus exulans, 1 R. argentiventer, 1 R. rattus, and
1 R. norvegicus. 53 lung tissue samples and 8 liver tissue
samples have been collected and stored frozen until analysis. Screening by immunoblotting for the presence of
hantaviral N-antigen using immunoblotting with antiDobrava virus antiserum revealed that 12 samples were
considered positive or probably positive. A confirmatory
immunoblotting was done with the anti-SEOV antiserum
collected from R. norvegicus trapped in Indonesia [17].
Eight rodents were not confirmed as N-antigen-positive;
these samples were subjected to the RT-PCR but none was
found positive. Other four samples, all from B. indica,
were confirmed positive for the hantaviral N-antigen. Two
were trapped in Nakhon Pathom province, the other two
in Nakhon Ratchasima province. The four N-antigen- positive rodents were analysed by RT-nested PCR and all were
found positive for the hantaviral S- and M-segment nucleotide sequences.

Corresponding wild-type THAIV strains were designated
as:
THAIV/NakhonPathom/Bi0016/2004,
THAIV/
NakhonPathom/Bi0067/2004,
THAIV/NakhonRatchasima/Bi0024/2004, and THAIV/NakhonRatchasima/
Bi0017/2004. In the following: our wild-type strains refer
to Thai0016, Thai0067, Thai0024, and Thai0017, respectively.
Genetic analysis
Partial M segment sequences (nt 2021–2303) recovered
from samples Thai0016 and Thai0067 were identical.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/72

Other three sequences differed at 3–7 positions, i.e.
shown 1.1–2.4% diversity. Notably, all but one mutation
were silent; strain Thai0067 had a homologous substitution of isoleucine to valine at pos 110 of the deduced
sequence of the GnGc protein. This suggested a strong stabilising selection operating on the protein level. The M
segment sequences of strains Thai0016 (Thai0067),
Thai0024, and Thai0017 were most closely related to Msequences of other hantaviruses carried by Murinae
rodents. As expected, the highest level of identity was
observed to the published M segment sequence of the
THAIV isolate 749 originated from B. indica trapped in
Thailand [8], 96–98%. The sequence identity to SEOV Msequences was a bit lower, 73–78%, and the sequence
identity to HTNV, DOBV and SAAV M-sequences was even
lower, 68–74%. The M segment sequences of hantaviruses
associated with Arvicolinae or Sigmodontinae rodents
were most distant (identity of 59–68%).
Partial S segment sequences (nt 389–946) of four wildtype THAIV strains differed at 2–10 positions, i.e. showed
0.4–1.8% diversity. All nucleotide susbtitutions were
silent suggesting, again, a strong stabilising selective pressure applied on the encoded part of the N protein (aa residues 110–300). The S-sequences of strains Thai0016 and
Thai0067 differed at three positions thus confirming that
the two strains are distinct. Four THAIV S-sequences
showed high level of identity to SEOV, HTNV (also the
HTNV-like DBSV and AMRV), DOBV, and SAAV Ssequences, 69%–75%. The S segment sequences recovered
from R. rattus, which were trapped in Cambodia, showed
the highest level of identity, 83–84%, with the newly
recovered THAIV S-sequences.
From the rodent sample Thai0017 we were able to RTamplify complete S segment sequence. It appeared to be
1882 nt in length (the first and the last 22 nucleotides
from the complete S-amplicons originated from the PCR
primer and therefore were not determined directly). The
sequence consists of the 5'- (positive sense) non-coding
region (NCR) of 46nt, the open reading frame of 1290 nt
for the N protein (429 aa residues), and the 3'NCR of 546
nt. The deduced aa sequence of the THAIV N protein
showed the highest identity (87%) to the N protein of
SEOV. The N protein sequences of other Murinae-associated hantaviruses were less related: HTNV- 85%, DOBV –
83%, and SAAV – 82% while the N protein sequences of
Arvicolinae- and Signodontinae- associated hantaviruses
showed the lowest level of sequence identity: e.g., PUUV64% and SNV – 64%.
A comparison of our newly recovered wild-type THAIV Ssequence (Thai0017) and the sequence from the cell culture isolate 741 (Thai741) recently deposited to GenBank
(Acc. number AB186420), showed that they are almost

Virology Journal 2006, 3:72

identical in length (1882 vs 1884 nt) and exhibit an overall diversity of 3.5%. The 5'-NCR of the Thai0017 strain is
one nt longer while the 3'-NCR is 2 nt shorter than the
corresponding regions of the Thai741 strain. The coding
regions if the two strains show 3.2% diversity and the
NCRs show 3.8% diversity. Deduced N protein sequences
are 98.8% identical and all five substitutions, L39F, R41K,
R73K, M226V, and I322V are homologous. This once
again stresses the point that the N protein sequence is
highly conserved within a given hantavirus type due to
functional constrains (see, e.g., [22,23]).
Phylogenetic analysis
On the phylogenetic trees constructed for complete and
partial S segment sequences and also for partial M-segment sequences THAIV strains clustered together and
formed a well supported group. Same branching pattern
was seen on the trees calculated using different algorithms; the ML-Puzzle-trees are shown on Figures 1 to 3.
Not surprisingly, THAIV sequences were placed within the
group of Murinae-associated hantaviruses and shared a
recent common ancestor with SEOV reflecting a close relationships between Bandicota and Rattus genera. These two
hantavirus species formed a sister taxa to another group
that included hantaviruses associated with Apodemus
mice: DOBV, SAAV, HTNV and also HTNV-like viruses Da
Bie Sha, and Amur/Soochong. Within the group of THAIV
strains, some signs of geographical clustering were seen.
On the partial M-segment tree, the sequences of wt-strains
from Nakhon Ratchasima province (Thai0024 and
Thai0017) were separated from the sequence of Thai0016
and Thai0067 strains (Nakhon Pathom province). On
both partial S- and partial M- segment trees the wt-strains
from Nakhon Pathom and Nakhon Ratchasima were separated from the isolates Thai741 and Thai749.

Most notably, the phylogenies inferred for the partial S
segment sequences revealed a well-supported monophily
of THAIV strains and wt-strains associated with R. rattus in
Cambodia [described by Reynes et al., 2003 [9]]. These
two clusters of strains were clearly separated from the
major cluster of SEOV strains including R. rattus-associated strain Gou originated from Zhejiang (China) [24].
This result suggested that there are two distinct hantaviral
types found in R. rattus: "Cambodia-like" (a close relative
of THAIV) and "China-like" (Gou, a close relative of bona
fide SEOV).

Discussion
Rodent hosts for hantaviruses in Thailand
Our data confirmed hantavirus circulation in at least two
provinces of Thailand: Nakhon Pathom and Nakhon
Ratchasima. Notably, four B. indica rodents were found
hantavirus-positive but none of B. salivei suggesting B.
indica as a primary host for THAIV. Rattus species were all

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/72

found hantavirus-negative during this study. However
previous serological investigations of hantaviruses in
Thailand have shown other rodents as possible vectors:
Rattus rattus [12,25,26], R. exulans [11,26,27]; R. norvegicus [11,12,27] and R. losea [26]. A more intensive study is
needed to clarify this issue.
Results of (phylo)genetic analyses of THAIV and related
viruses
In this paper, for the first time, the complete S segment
sequence of THAI virus is described. The new genetic
information is in line with our previous knowledge based
on the complete M segment sequence: THAIV is a distinct
hantavirus species that shows a substantial genetic diversity from other members of the Hantavirus genus and
shares the most recent common ancestor with SEOV and
the more ancient common ancestor with other Murinaeassociated viruses. Four newly described wt- strains of
THAIV showed decent genetic diversity between themselves, 0.4–2.4%, and also to the previously described
THAIV isolate (2–4%, in the partial M.-segment
sequence). Interestingly, these wt strains, which originated from two trapping areas 250 km apart, showed
some signs of geographical clustering, the feature shared
by all known hantaviruses except the "cosmopolitan"
SEOV associated with R. norvegicus [4,5].

When analysing the partial S segment sequences we
observed that the newly described THAIV strains are
monophyletic with the wt hantavirus strains associated
with R. rattus in Cambodia. These two sister taxa are separated from SEOV strains associated with R. norvegicus
worldwide but also from the R. rattus-associated strain
Gou originated from China. This phylogeny is different
from the phylogeny inferred by Reynes et al [9] for partial
S segment sequence (nt 370–970): in the later, the THAIV
sequence (Thai749) is not monophyletic with any Rattusassociated virus but instead occupies the most ancestral
node in the THAIV-HTNV-DOBV-SAAV-SEOV clade.
Reynes and co-authors [9] suggested that at least two subtypes of SEOV carried by R. rattus circulate in Asia. Phylogeny presented in this paper (Fig. 2) suggests that there
might be two distinct hantaviruses associated with R. rattus. The first of them, Gou virus, is either a subtype of
SEOV or a closely related to SEOV but distinct hantavirus.
The second hantavirus, which was found in Cambodia, is
a relative of THAIV but a distinct entity as well. Further
investigation is needed to unwrap this intriguing story.
For instance, it might be worth studying whether the
"Cambodia virus" is a product of a host-switch of preTHAI from Bandicota to Rattus.
The results of previous studies suggested that new viruses,
different hosts and different human syndromes may be

expected to be discovered in the future in Southeastern
Asia where Muridae rodents are endemic and highly diversified and where the human population is regularly
exposed to them. The recent discovery of a new hantavirus
in Guinea [28] demonstrate that hantaviruses have to be
tracked wherever Muridae rodents are living. Further studies are needed to assess the reality of an endemic Southeast Asian group of hantaviruses and to understand their
particularities, their current distribution among rodents in
different areas and in different landscapes and finally their
potential dangerousness for humans. This also supposes
the improvement of our knowledge of the ecology and
biogeography of the hantavirus natural reservoirs in
Southeast Asia. Thailand, which health system is strongly
organized and possesses important and detailed archives
has all the necessary resources to organize such a program.
The results may be of interest for all the surrounding
countries and give rise to a regional cooperation in this
field of study.

Most recently we became aware of the manuscript of S.
Pattamadilok and co-authors [29] in which they characterized the S segment sequence recovered from the THAIV
isolate and also performed antigenic cross-reactivity studies of rodent and human sera collected in Thailand. Their
observations on THAIV-positive bandicoot rats as well as
results of the phylogenetic analyses are nicely in line with
our data reported here. Most interestingly, the serum of
one patient with the HFRS symptoms showed high titers
of THAIV-neutralisiung antibodies suggesting that this
hantavirus is a human pathogen.
