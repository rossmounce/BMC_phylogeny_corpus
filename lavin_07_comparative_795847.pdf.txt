Abstract
Background: Pseudomonas syringae is a widespread bacterial plant pathogen, and strains of P.
syringae may be assigned to different pathovars based on host specificity among different plant
species. The genomes of P. syringae pv. syringae (Psy) B728a, pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 and pv.
phaseolicola (Pph) 1448A have been recently sequenced providing a major resource for comparative
genomic analysis. A mechanism commonly found in bacteria for signal transduction is the twocomponent system (TCS), which typically consists of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response
regulator (RR). P. syringae requires a complex array of TCS proteins to cope with diverse plant
hosts, host responses, and environmental conditions.
Results: Based on the genomic data, pattern searches with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles
have been used to identify putative HKs and RRs. The genomes of Psy B728a, Pto DC3000 and Pph
1448A were found to contain a large number of genes encoding TCS proteins, and a core of
complete TCS proteins were shared between these genomes: 30 putative TCS clusters, 11 orphan
HKs, 33 orphan RRs, and 16 hybrid HKs. A close analysis of the distribution of genes encoding TCS
proteins revealed important differences in TCS proteins among the three P. syringae pathovars.
Conclusion: In this article we present a thorough analysis of the identification and distribution of
TCS proteins among the sequenced genomes of P. syringae. We have identified differences in TCS
proteins among the three P. syringae pathovars that may contribute to their diverse host ranges and
association with plant hosts. The identification and analysis of the repertoire of TCS proteins in the
genomes of P. syringae pathovars constitute a basis for future functional genomic studies of the
signal transduction pathways in this important bacterial phytopathogen.

Background
Bacterial signal transduction pathways sense the cellular
external environment and regulate cellular functions in
response to environmental signals. A mechanism com-

monly found in bacteria for signal transduction is the twocomponent system (TCS). Bacterial TCSs are common
components of complex regulatory networks and cascades, often associated with global regulation as well as

with regulation of virulence. TCS genes are typically
located within the same operon encoding two signalling
proteins: a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase (HK)
and a cytoplasmic response regulator (RR), which may
sometimes be carried by a single polypeptide to form the
hybrid HKs [1]. The mechanism of signal transduction by
TCS proteins is based on phosphotransfer reactions
between histidine (H) and aspartate (D) residues in
highly conserved signalling domains of the HKs and their
cognate RRs. TCS proteins have a modular organization,
which may give rise to highly complex structures, but the
core structures and activities are maintained [2]. HKs are
typically organized as homodimers with two functionally
and structurally distinct domains: a highly variable N-terminal extracytoplasmic sensory domain, and a more conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic transmitter domain, also
known as the dimerization/phosphoacceptor domain
[2,3]. The sensor domain varies in length and amino acid
sequence from one HK to another, conferring specificity
for different environmental stimuli. In most HKs, the
transmitter domain shows high sequence conservation,
especially within a set of six recognizable motifs or boxes
designated H, N, F, G1, G2, and G3. In particular, the H
box contains an invariant H residue that is autophosphorylated in an ATP-dependent manner [4]. In contrast,
CheA-like HKs that function in chemotaxis lack the sensor
domain and differ from other HKs in their domain constitution and organization, where the H box of the transmitter domain resides at the N-terminal end of the protein [58]. LytS-like HKs also differ significantly in their domain
architecture from other HKs [9-11]. RRs generally contain
at least two functional domains: a conserved N-terminal
receiver domain (REC domain) that is phosphorylated by
the HK at a strictly conserved D residue, and one or more
variable C-terminal output domains [12]. Modulation of
the phosphorylated state of the RR controls either expression of the target genes or cellular behaviour. The principal type of bacterial RRs are transcription factors that
regulate gene-expression with DNA-binding helix-turnhelix (HTH) output domains [1,3,12,13]. Hybrid HKs
contain both a HK transmitter domain and a REC domain
in a single large polypeptide, and are characterized by
multi-step phosphotransfer reactions [1,7,14].
The availability of complete genome sequences for a continually growing number of bacteria has allowed the
definitive assessment that TCS proteins are present in
almost all bacterial species [1,8,12]. Genomic analyses
demonstrate the enormous impact of TCSs on environmental adaptation of bacteria, and reveal a wide variation
of HK and RR numbers between different bacterial species
[7,8,12,15-20].
The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae causes
disease on a variety of plant species, and strains of P.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/397

syringae have been classified into different pathovars
depending on their host range among different plant species [21]. Infection of host plants by P. syringae involves
growth on leaf surfaces as an epiphyte, that enters plant
leaves through stomata, multiplies to large populations in
the apoplast and produces disease symptoms [21,22]. P.
syringae injects effector proteins into the cytoplasm of
plant cells by means of the Hrp type III secretion system
[21]. Genome comparisons indicate that P. syringae is significantly different from other Pseudomonas species
[23,24], suggesting that in the adaptation to the phytopathogenic lifestyle its genome must have undergone
fundamental changes without a reduction in size. The
complete genomic sequences of three economically
important pathovars of this plant pathogenic bacteria
have been determined: P. syringae pv. tomato (Pto)
DC3000, pv. syringae (Psy) B728a and pv. phaseolicola
(Pph) 1448A [25-27]. In these genomes, over 10 to 12 %
of the genes are dedicated to regulation, which may reflect
the need for rapid adaptation to the diverse environments
encountered during epiphytic growth, plant colonization
and pathogenesis [25-27]. Genome analyses of these P.
syringae pathovars revealed fewer extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors (10 ECF sigma factors) than in
related Pseudomonas with different lifestyles [24].
Recently, analysis of the Pto DC3000 genome sequence
allowed the identification of 69 HKs [28,29] and 71 RRs,
21 of which were hybrid HKs [12]. In a different study not
including CheA-like HKs, 64 HKs were identified in Pto
DC3000, 20 of which were hybrid HKs [30]. Hence, P.
syringae requires a complex array of TCS proteins to cope
with diverse plant hosts, host responses, and environmental conditions. The availability of complete genomic
sequences of three different P. syringae pathovars makes it
possible to conduct this comparative genomic study to
identify and analyse the TCS proteins of P. syringae.

Results and Discussion
Distribution of TCS proteins in P. syringae
The putative HKs and RRs in Psy B728a, Pto DC3000 and
Pph 1448A were identified by searching the complete
genome sequences for proteins containing HK and RR
domains using Pfam HMM profiles. Four CheA-like HKs
in each P. syringae genome were identified in BLASTP
searches using as template the CheA HK of E. coli [31]
(Table 1). In addition, BLASTP searches of the HKs and
RRs found in each P. syringae pathovar against the
genomes of the other two pathovars allowed the identification of additional HKs and RRs. The genomes of P. syringae pathovars were found to contain large numbers of
genes encoding TCS proteins: 68 HKs and 93 RRs in Psy
B728a, 69 HKs and 95 RRs in Pto DC3000, and 70 HKs
and 92 RRs in Pph 1448A (Table 1; see Additional File 1
and 2). The number of genes encoding hybrid HKs (RECHKs) was 20 in Psy B728a, 22 in Pto DC3000 and 24 in

Pph 1448A (Tables 1 and 4). The HMM search method
used in this work retrieved hybrid HKs as well as RRs
(Table 1). No TCS proteins were identified on any of the
plasmids of Pto DC3000 and Pph 1448A. In recent studies,
similar numbers of TCS proteins for Pto DC3000 have
been reported: 69 HKs [28,29] and 71 RRs, 21 of which
were hybrid HKs [12]; or 64 HKs in a study not including
CheA-like HKs, 20 of which where hybrid HKs [30].
Although the number of ECF sigma factors in all three P.
syringae genomes (10 ECF sigma factors) is only about half
that found in other Pseudomonas species [24,32], the
number of TCS proteins is close to that found in other
Pseudomonas genomes [33].
HK and RR genes were scattered over the entire chromosomes of the three P. syringae pathovars. Conservation of
the genetic organization between HK and RR genes was
analysed in the genomes of Psy B728a, Pto DC3000 and
Pph 1448A allowing the identification of gene clusters
containing HKs and RRs that constitute putative TCSs
(Table 2). Like in other bacterial species, many P. syringae
HKs and RRs were encoded by clusters of adjacent genes:
37 putative clusters of complete TCS genes in Psy B728a,
34 in Pto DC3000, and 33 in Pph 1448A (Table 2). For the
remaining HK or RR genes, their partner genes could not

be predicted from genetic organization and, therefore,
they were considered as orphan HKs or RRs. The orphan
HKs were 11 in each P. syringae genome, and the number
of genes encoding orphan RRs was very high: 36 in Psy
B728a, 38 in Pto DC3000 and 35 in Pph 1448A (Table 3).
Finally, the comparative genomic analysis allowed the
identification of a core of complete TCS protein orthologues among the three P. syringae pathovars, that is composed by 30 putative TCS clusters (HK and RR) (Table 2),
11 orphan HKs, 33 orphan RRs (Table 3), and 16 hybrid
HKs (Table 4).
Classification of HKs
HKs have been classified on the basis of phylogenetic
analyses and the sequence relationships of the residues
surrounding the H-box [7,8,17,34]. Furthermore, several
new domains with putative biological functions have
been described in HKs, and domain architecture has
proven particularly informative for analysing multidomain proteins involved in signal transduction
[2,11,12,35]. The phylogenetic analysis and examination
of the region around the H box of P. syringae HKs showed
that three of the five major HK types found in E. coli [8]
were present in P. syringae: Type I (IA, IB, IC), III, and
CheA-like HKs (Table 1; see Additional File 1). In contrast,

a Whenever a HK or RR of P. syringae has been assigned a function in the literature and/or an annotation in databases, the corresponding protein
name is mentioned; borganization of each TCS on P. syringae genomes (HR, 5' histidine kinase-3' response regulator; RH, 5' response regulator-3'
histidine kinase); c an additional gene is located in between the RR and HK genes; d HR in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A; e genes with disrupted
reading frames.

Type II and IV HKs were totally absent from P. syringae.
However, the LytS-like HK FimS/AlgZ and HKs containing
GAF domains did not cluster within any of the defined HK
types of E. coli [8], and formed two separate HK groups:
LytS-like HKs and GAF-HKs. GAF sensor domains are
commonly found cytoplasmic signalling domains in the
N-terminal region of HKs [2,34], and appear to act as
binding sites for small ligands, such as cyclic nucleotides
(cAMP and cGMP) and small molecules, which modulate

the catalytic activity of the target protein [36,37]. In addition, analysis of domain architecture of P. syringae HKs
showed a conserved core structure for each HK type in P.
syringae (Figure 1). The conserved core of Type III HKs and
LytS-like HKs only had a HK-like ATPase (HATPase_c) catalytic domain and a His_kinase domain, respectively.
The conserved core of CheA-like HKs contained a C-terminal CheA regulatory domain but lacked the HisKA
domain. The conserved core of Type I HKs and GAF-HKs

had a central region with HisKA and HATPase_c domains
fused to additional domains on the N-terminal end: a
HAMP domain in Type IA, a PAS domain in Type IC, and
GAF plus phytochrome (PHY) binding domains in GAFHKs (Figure 1).
Orphan HKs fell into two HK types: Type I (IA, IB and IC),
and GAF-HKs (Table 3); and hybrid HKs of P. syringae
belong either to the Type I (IB and IC) or CheA-like HKs
(Table 4). PSYR3504 (BphP1) and PSYR2385 (BphP2)
HKs have been previously described as bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) that belong to the HWE_HK family
[4,38]. Similar to other BphPs, the bphP1 (PSYR3504)
gene of P. syringae pathovars is located in an operon
downstream from a bphO gene, encoding a putative heme
oxigenase.
Classification of RRs
RRs show a great variety of output domains and domain
combinations. Recently, bacterial and archaeal RRs have
been classified into families based in their domain architectures [12]. RRs typically consist of an N-terminal REC
domain fused to a C-terminal HTH DNA-binding output
domain (OmpR, NarL, NtrC, LytR, AraC, Spo0A, Fis,
YcbB, RpoE, and MerR) that activates or represses

transcription of specific target genes [2,12]. In addition,
prokaryotic genomes encode a variety of RRs with unusual
domain organization: RRs with enzymatic output
domains (GGDEF, EAL, HD-GYP, CheB, CheC, PP2C, and
HisKA), RRs with RNA-binding output domains (ANTAR
and CsrA), RRs with protein- or ligand-binding output
domains (CheW, PAS, GAF, TPR, CAP_ED, and Hpt), RRs
with the REC domain as a stand-alone module, and RRs
with domains of unknown function [12]. The RRs identified from the genomes of P. syringae pathovars were
assigned to these different RR families [12] according to
the domain architecture and phylogenetic analysis (Table
1; see Additional File 2).
Bacterial RRs without a REC domain are extremely rare,
but a number of enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs) lack
the REC domain and normally function as RRs [39]. EBPs
are involved in the activation of the bacterial transcription
by interaction with the sigma-54 RNA polymerase
holoenzyme [40]. In P. syringae, the HrpR and HrpS proteins show a high sequence similarity to the NtrC family
of transcriptional RRs and have been previously identified
as unusual EBPs lacking the N-terminal REC domain;
however, similar to other EBPs, they retain the domain
that interacts with the sigma-54 RNA polymerase

holoenzyme plus the C-terminal DNA-binding domain
[39-42]. In addition, the NarL-like RR CorP of Pto
DC3000 that is involved in the regulation of coronatine
biosynthesis [43,44] also lacks the REC domain. Thus,
HrpR, HrpS and CorP proteins were not identified during
the search of RRs in P. syringae genomes with the HMM
profile that targets the RR REC domain, nevertheless these
proteins were considered orphan RRs (Table 3).
Differences in TCS genes among pathovars that may
contribute to plant host specificity
A close analysis of the distribution of genes encoding TCS
proteins revealed that there are important differences in
TCS proteins among the three pathovars of P. syringae that
may contribute to their diverse host ranges and association with particular host plants. A number of the identified TCS genes were unique to each P. syringae pathovar
without counterparts in the other two pathovars. The
corRSP regulatory region (PSPTO4704-4706) of coronatine biosynthesis and the copRS TCS (PSYR1497/1498)
regulating copper resistance were only present in Pto
DC3000 and Psy B728a, respectively. Other TCS genes
unique to each P. syringae pathovar were: PSYR2114,
PSYR2939, PSYR2940 and PSYR3084 in Psy B728a;
PSPTO0785/0786,
PSPTO2329,
PSPTO4079,
PSPTO4080 and PSPTO5573/5574 in Pto DC3000;
PSPPH0770, PSPPH0778, PSPPH0944 and PSPPH1261
in Pph 1448A. The unique hybrid HKs PSPPH0770 and
PSPPH0944 were flanked by transposases. However, the
unique RRs PSPTO2329 and PSPTO5574 were disrupted
by transposases [25,27], and it is unlikely that these genes
encode functional products. Finally, 11 TCS proteins were
only shared between two of these P. syringae pathovars.

Variations among P. syringae pathovars were also produced by the insertion of mobile genetic elements or
point mutations in TCS genes resulting in disrupted reading frames. PSPTO2326 and PSPPH2083 encoded truncated hybrid HKs by comparison with the length of their
orthologue PSYR2113 (Table 4) that is located next to the
unique RR PSYR2114. PSPTO2326 and PSPPH2083 were
located adjacent to a transposase and to a site-specific
recombinase, respectively. Probably these elements
caused the disrupted hybrid HKs and the lack of
PSYR2114 orthologues in Pto DC3000 and Pph 1448A.
Similarly, PSPTO2983 (baeS2) and PSPPH2510 encoded
truncated HKs compared to the length of their P. syringae
orthologues, and PSPPH2980 was interrupted by an
ISPsy18 transposase. PSPTO2983, PSPPH2510 and
PSPPH2980 HKs were unpaired without a RR gene in its
vicinity, whereas their P. syringae orthologues are located
on TCS gene clusters with adjacent RRs (Table 2).
Although the PSPPH1362 gene was disrupted by an
authentic frameshift, Psy B728a (PSYR1292) and Pto

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/397

DC3000 (PSPTO1482) orthologues encoded intact
hybrid HKs with similarity to BvgS of Bordetella species
that controls the regulation of many virulence factors
[45]. In each pathovar, these hybrid HK genes were adjacent to orphan RR genes transcribed in the same direction
(PSYR1293, PSPTO1482 and PSPPH1363), and their
encoded proteins exhibited significant homology to the
PvrR RR of P. aeruginosa PA14 which controls antibiotic
susceptibility and biofilm formation [46], and to the virulence related protein VieA of Vibrio cholerae [47].

Conclusion
In this article we present a thorough analysis of the identification and distribution of TCS proteins among the
sequenced genomes of P. syringae. A large set of TCS proteins is required for the capacity of P. syringae to detect and
adapt to changing environments during plant association
and pathogenesis. Moreover, P. syringae has been isolated
from non-plant environments such as river epilithon
(rock-attached biofilms) [48] in which TCS proteins may
have also important regulatory roles. P. syringae pathovars
posses between 68–70 HKs and 92–95 RRs (Table 1),
however there is little information describing their regulatory functions and the major part of these TCS proteins is
uncharacterized. Many of the TCS proteins investigated so
far in P. syringae have been shown to be involved in plant
pathogenicity and association with host plants. The
orphan RRs HrpR and HrpS are involved in a complex regulatory cascade that activates the transcription of the Hrp
type III secretion genes and all known effector genes
[42,49]. Expression of the type III secretion genes and
effector genes is also regulated by the particular TCS GacA/
GacS [50] and the RhpRS system [51]. Furthermore, the
GacA/GacS system controls the expression of a variety of
virulence factors, including protease and syringomycin
biosynthesis [52]. The TCS CopRS and the modified
CorRSP system regulate resistance to copper [53] and coronatine synthesis [43,44], respectively. Finally, the hybrid
HK PSPTO2896 contains an N-terminal LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domain and is blue-light-activated [54].
Bacteria with large genomes are disproportionately
enriched in regulatory proteins involved in transcription
control and signal transduction compared to medium and
small-size genomes, and typically have complex regulatory networks relative to bacteria with smaller genomes
[55-57]. The existence of large numbers of HKs and RRs in
P. syringae strongly suggests that TCS proteins play important regulatory roles in the adaptation of this bacterium to
different plant and non-plant environments. Comparative
genomics of closely related species of pathogenic bacteria
represents a powerful tool for the identification of genes
potentially involved in host specificity and pathogenesis.
The availability of the genome sequences of Pto DC3000,
Psy B728a and Pph 1448A provides us with the unique

capability of comparing the complement of TCS proteins
in these P. syringae pathovars that differ in host range and
other interactions with plants. This comparative genomic
analysis reveals a core of orthologues and important differences in TCS genes between P. syringae pathovars. It is
especially worth noting the high number of genes encoding orphan HKs and RRs in these genomes. Moreover, differences in the repertoires of TCS proteins are likely to
facilitate the adaptation of P. syringae pathovars to different plant hosts and/or could be responsible for the different disease characteristics induced. Consequently, the TCS
proteins unique to each P. syringae pathovar are interesting targets for future investigations to identify TCS proteins involved in the different host ranges and/or plant
pathogenesis. However, the challenge remains to associate these differences in TCS proteins to specific traits of P.
syringae pathovars. Additionally, pathovar-specific differences in gene content might be used to design targeted
approaches for disease control and could allow the precise
PCR-based diagnosis of bacterial diseases [58].
Analysis of the regulatory functions, molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways of TCS proteins
should contribute to the understanding of the complex
events that occur in P. syringae during pathogenesis and
adaptation to different plant hosts and different nonplant environments. Rapid progress in the study of TCS
proteins is being made by the combination of molecular
genetic approaches with genome-scale analysis [59].
Genetic and biochemical studies are necessary to further
explore the signal transduction pathways mediated by
some of these TCS proteins at the molecular level: construction and analysis of deletion mutants in TCS genes in
order to determine the signals sensed by the HK and the
targets for the RR of each system. In addition, the application of more extensive analysis with global methods, such
as DNA microarray studies reported for B. subtilis [60] and
S. pneumoniae [61], might allow defining the regulons and
the potential regulatory functions of TCS proteins in
response to environmental signals. Furthermore, unravelling these signal transduction pathways could potentially
lead to the design of innovative strategies to control P.
syringae. In conclusion, this comparative genomic analysis
constitutes a basis for future functional genomic analysis
of P. syringae to establish which TCS proteins participate
in the pathogenesis and the adaptation to different plant
and non-plant environments.

[33] with slight modification. Briefly, five different HMM
profiles (accession numbers PF00512, PF07568,
PF07730, PF07536 and PF06580) were found in Pfam
database that target different families of HKs (HisKA,
HisKA_2, HisKA_3, HWE_HK and His_kinase). The
HWE_HK domain is defined by the absence of a recognizable F box, and the presence of a highly conserved H residue and a WxE motif within the N and G1 boxes of the Cterminal transmitter domain, respectively [4]. These five
different HMM profiles were used to recognize the different HKs in the P. syringae genomes, and hits with a E-value
below a selected cut-off (10-6) were extracted. A profile
HMM downloaded from Pfam protein families database
[62], which targets the RR REC domain (accession
number PF00072), was used to recognize the RRs in each
P. syringae genome. Hits with an E-value below a selected
cut-off (10-12) were extracted. Additionally, the CheA HK
of Escherichia coli [31] was used as template in BLASTP
searches to identify CheA-like HKs in the P. syringae
genomes and hits with an E-value below a selected cut-off
(10-10) were extracted. Hybrid HKs (REC-HKs) were determined by the presence of complete HK transmitter and
REC domains in a single protein. Detection of orthologues of the identified HKs and RRs between the
genomes of Psy B728a, Pto DC3000 and Pph 1448A was
determined by BLASTP [63] based on the reciprocal best
hits of each P. syringae genome against each other
genome, completed by the phylogenetic analyses. Finally,
functional domains of the HKs and RRs were identified by
search the Conserved Domain Databases (CDD) with
Reverse Specific Position BLAST [64].
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees of
HKs and RRs were constructed using the ClustalW program [65], and aligned sequences were imported into the
MEGA 3.1 program [66] where phylogenetic trees were
inferred. Default parameters were used. Phylogenetic trees
were subdivided into groups of orthologues, and co-clustering with members of specific TCS proteins allowed a
definitive assignation to a given HK type or RR family.
