Abstract
Background: Public databases now contain multitude of complete bacterial genomes, including
several genomes of the same species. The available data offers new opportunities to address
questions about bacterial genome evolution, a task that requires reliable fine comparison data of
closely related genomes. Recent analyses have shown, using pairwise whole genome alignments,
that it is possible to segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved backbone and strainspecific sequences called loops.
Results: Here, we generalize this approach and propose a strategy that allows systematic and nonbiased genome segmentation based on multiple genome alignments. Segmentation analyses, as
applied to 13 different bacterial species, confirmed the feasibility of our approach to discern the
'mosaic' organization of bacterial genomes. Segmentation results are available through a Web
interface permitting functional analysis, extraction and visualization of the backbone/loops
structure of documented genomes. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we performed a
precise analysis of the mosaic organization of three E. coli strains and functional characterization of
the loops.
Conclusion: The segmentation results including the backbone/loops structure of 13 bacterial
species genomes are new and available for use by the scientific community at the URL: http://
genome.jouy.inra.fr/mosaic.

Background
Systematic genome comparisons play an increasingly
important role in genome analysis and annotation. There
are mainly two kinds of approaches used for whole
genome comparisons: whole proteome comparison studies and whole genomic sequence alignment studies. Both
approaches are powerful tools to study genome organiza-

tion and evolution rules with different time scale considerations. These approaches have been employed with
success in a recent study comparing the genome of yeast S.
cerevisiae to three related yeast species genomes [1,2].
Genomewide comparative analysis of the yeast chromosomes has considerably improved gene annotation and
has permitted the prediction of new motifs conserved in

intergenic regions that act potentially as regulatory elements of gene expression [1].
Whole genome-alignments tools have shown important
developments in the last years. It is now possible to align
rapidly two or more long genomic DNA sequences with
several tools like MultiPipMaker [3], Vista [4], Mummer
[5-7] and MGA [8]. Some of them include graphical interfaces to display and browse genome alignments [3,4,7].
Other resources provide precomputed alignments for
genome of related species, such as EnteriX or Colibase for
enterobacteria [9,10].
Here we focus on whole genomic sequence alignments in
the particular case of strains of single bacterial species.
Since the publication of a second strain of Helicobacter
pylori in 1999 [11], sequence data on closely related bacterial genomes has rapidly accumulated in public databases. The availability of complete genome sequences for
multiple strains of numerous species opens up new perspectives for studying short term evolutionary processes.
For example pairwise alignment of the complete genomes
of the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0157:H7 strains
(Sakaï or EDL 933) with the E. coli K-12 laboratory strain,
allowed the definition of a 4.1 Mb sequence that was
highly conserved between the two strains [12,13]. It was
proposed that this common sequence corresponds to the
conserved backbone of the E. coli chromosome, which is
interrupted by numerous DNA segments called strain-specific loops, distributed throughout the backbone [12].
Examination of "mosaic" structures of backbones and
loops offers a potential approach to trace the dynamics of
genome evolution at the bacterial species level. The backbone, conserved in all aligned genomes of the species,
probably corresponds in large part to the common ancestral strain and is the part of the genome under vertical
selective pressure. As such, the backbone is also likely to
be the most adapted part of the genome, which could be
relevant when studying essential functional elements of
the cell (such as genes, motifs or signals). Loops differ
among strains. Some may correspond to mobile elements,
like prophage [14] and insertion sequences [15], and may
be associated with strain-specific pathogenicity. However
little is known about functional elements associated with
small loops.
Up to now, no systematic strategy for backbone/loop segmentation has been proposed for closely related bacterial
genomes. The existing studies are either limited to pairwise comparisons or choose a reference genome which is
compared to several related genomes. Precomputed alignments are often limited to a subgroup of species and use
different softwares and parameters, making results generally non-reproducible or non-comparable.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/171

In this paper we address the problem of defining a strategy
to obtain a backbone/loop segmentation of bacterial
genomes at the intraspecies level. This approach is based
on two recent genome aligners: Mummer3 [7] and MGA
[8]. Using a validated benchmark dataset, we developed a
simple treatment of alignment results which permits a
robust definition of the mosaic structure. Our approach
does not take any genome as a reference and has no
restriction for the number of genomes to align. We used
our method to define this segmentation for 13 bacterial
species. Validated backbone/loop segmentation results
are stored in the MOSAIC database and are freely accessible through a user friendly Web interface. The backbone/
loop segmentation determined using three E. coli
genomes illustrates important properties of this structure,
and indicates that intraspecies segmentation is a useful
mean of enhancing bacterial genome annotation.

Results
The global strategy of genome segmentation and database
integration used in this study is outlined Figure 1. A reference set, consisting in a manually verified genome alignment, was used to set appropriate segmentation
parameters. Using this strategy, alignments and segmentations were performed systematically for 13 bacterial species, for which at least two genomes have been sequenced.
Loop and backbone coordinates were then integrated in
the MOSAIC database together with NCBI genome
annotations.
Validation of segmentation parameters
The loop coordinates of the E. coli K-12 and O157:H7
Sakai genomes validated by Hayashi et al. [16] (see Methods) were used as a basis to define an alignment strategy
and to develop a treatment of alignment results adapted
to bacterial backbone/loop segmentations. These strains
are known to belong to distantly related E. coli lineages
[17] and their genomes are more distantly related
between each other compared with genomes within other
species [18]. Parameters allowing a pertinent alignment of
such different genomes were therefore expected to produce reliable results for more closely related strains. The
K-12/Sakai comparisons were performed using different
parameters of the MGA software, and those leading to the
best results, as compared to coordinates obtained by Hayashi et al., were chosen. This set was used to produce alignments for all species so that results may be compared.

MGA software provides three types of results: matches
(anchored MEMs of a minimal given length), aligned gaps
(segments between anchored MEMs, shorter than a userdefined size and aligned with ClustalW) and unaligned
gaps. Matches were computed using an iterative process
on MEM size: MEM of at least 50 bp were used for the first
MGA step and MEM of at least 20 bp were computed in

the second recursive step. These two kinds of MEM were
included into the backbone of the segmented genomes.
The gaps were then treated as follows : gaps longer than
3000 bp (unaligned MGA gaps) were considered as loops,
and gaps shorter than 3000 bp were aligned with ClustalW. Aligned gaps with more than 76 % identity were
considered as backbone, others, as loops. Minimal size of
loops and backbone segments was set to 20 nucleotides
each. This strategy generated a backbone/loop profile of
the K-12/Sakai alignment that differed by around 2400 nt
(0,1 %) from that validated by Hayashi et al. [16].

rangements. The second category includes genomes that
can be aligned after minor correction of their sequences
(Reverse complement and Translation operators, see
Material & Methods section). This second category concerns 5 genomes (4 species). The last category corresponds
to 17 genomes belonging to 8 species: Neisseria meningitis,
Prochlorococcus marinus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella
flexneri, Streptococcus pyogenes, Tropheryma whipplei, Xylella
fastidiosa and Yersinia pestis. These genomes were excluded
because Mummerplot results revealed rearrangements
covering a large part of the genome.

Genome selection for the backbone/loop segmentation
In order to select a subset of genomes for which backbone/loop segmentation makes sense, an analysis using
the Mummer package was performed (see Methods).
Three categories of results we obtained. The first category
includes 33 genomes for which MGA alignments and
backbone/loop segmentations are feasible, as they have
not been submitted to numerous and important rear-

Genome alignments and backbone/loop segmentation
Twenty four genome alignments were generated and
treated for backbone/loop segmentation using MGA and
our defined set of parameters. These included two quadruple alignments (E. coli, C. pneumoniae), four triple alignments (C. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, S. pyogenes) and
eigthteen pairwise alignments. For one species, Buchnera
aphidicola, segmentation results were not exploited due to

too low coverage (this value estimates the percentage of
total genome length included in the backbone, in this case
40 %, see Discussion).
Validated segmentation results including backbone size,
loop size, loop number and genome coverage are
described in Table 1. The coverage ranged from 68 % for
E. coli quadruple alignment to 99 % for C. pneumoniae
strains. Species comparisons giving high coverage values
may be a consequence of to the choice of closely related
strains for sequencing, but may also indicate that overall
horizontal transfer is less important in some species than
in others.

The number of loops in a segmented genome appeared to
be also highly variable among bacterial species, ranging
from 6 (Chlamydophila pneumoniae strain CWL29 compared to strain TW183) to 2878 (Bacillus cereus, strain
ATCC14579 compared to ARCC10987). Results of table 1
revealed two extremes situations. Some species have few
very long loops, as Agrobacterium tumefaciens (24/25 loops
for the circular chromosome, mean length of loops
around 28 kilobases). Others (Bacillus cereus) contain a
large number of short loops (mean length around 400
bases). These differences will need to be further examined
in details, in relation with genome annotations.

Database integration and web interface
Alignments were integrated into the MOSAIC database
and are accessible through the Web interface. Access to the
mosaic structure of genomes is made by species selection
or gene name selection. For each segmented genome, a
local view of the physical map of the segmented genome
is available, using MuGeN software [19] (see Figure 2).
This graphical visualization of loop and backbone structures is associated with Genbank/NCBI genome annotations. In addition, an overall graphical view of backbone
and loops structure is presented using EMBOSS cirdna
program. Finally, lists of loop and backbone segments can
also be inspected and downloaded according to different
criteria like size, genome position or functional
characterization.
In depth analysis of the backbone/loop structure of three
E. coli genomes
A more precise analysis of the segmentation results from
the comparison of E. coli strains K-12 [20], O157:H7 Sakai
[12] (named Sakai below) and CFT073 [21] (named CFT
below) was performed. A 3.73 Mb length backbone
(exhibiting more than 97 % identity between the three
strains) and three sets of strain-specific loops (of very different total length) were identified. The K-12 genome
included 827 K-12 loops (total length 0.9 Mb, 20 % of the
K-12 genome), the Sakai genome, 795 Sakai loops (total
length 1.8 Mb, 33 % of the Sakai genome) and the CFT
genome, 770 CFT loops (total length 1.5 Mb, 29 % of the
CFT genome). The differences in total loop sizes are in
keeping with the different total genome size of the three
strains (K-12: 4.6 Mb ; Sakai: 5.5 Mb ; CFT: 5.2 Mb).
A large proportion of short loops in the E. coli genome
Basic statistics concerning the size distribution of the three
loop sets are described in Table 2 and Figure 3. Results of
Table 2 show a remarkable number of short loops for the
three species: three quarters of the K-12 loops are shorter
than 486 nucleotides (respectively 863 and 314 for Sakai
and CFT). The histogram of loop size distribution for the
three E. coli strains (Figure 3) reveals that the loop population is heterogeneous. Interestingly it appears that the
loop populations exhibit roughly the same profile in the
three strains, which may comprise three sub-populations:
numerous very short loops (length around 100 bp),
medium-size loops (length around 1–2 kb) and a few very
long loops (length > 10 kb). This may reflect a wide diversity of functional properties conferred by loops: the longer
loops probably encode several genes (and correspond for
example to bacteriophage or pathogenicity islands). The
shorter ones might have regulatory roles or affect gene
expression.

Functional elements associated with backbone and loops
The distribution of functional elements in the backbone/
loop structure was analyzed. Functions identified by classical annotations of bacterial genomes i.e. genes, tRNA,
rRNA, phages and Insertion Sequences (IS) were first considered. As expected tRNA and rRNA were mainly present
in the backbone. One exception concerns a rather large
proportion of tRNA present in the Sakai loops (27 %)
compared to K-12 (9%) and CFT (13 %) loops. The Sakai
strain contains 18 specific tRNAs not present in K-12 [12],
Hayashi et al. observed that these tRNAs recognize codons
which are used with an increased frequency in Sakai
loops. Not surprisingly, we observed that phages and IS
are quasi-totally included in loops (>98%). The ten longest loops of K-12 correspond systematically to known
phages, or phage remnants of the E. coli genome.
One hundred E. coli K-12 loops are associated with BIME
To refine functional categorization of smaller loops we
examined the correspondence between loops and Bacterial Interpersed Mosaic Element (BIME). BIME are short
palindromic repetitive DNA elements found in the
genomes of E. coli and other enterobacteria [22], and are
present exclusively in intergenic regions. BIME are composed of three types of palindromic units (Y, Z1 and Z2).
Three sub-families of BIME have been described: BIME-1,
which are composed of one Y and one Z1; BIME-2 ("composite" BIME) which contain two to twelve Y and Z2; and
a third category ("atypical BIME"), which refers to all
other palindromic units associations. BIME sizes range
from 140 bp for BIME-1 to several kb for BIME-2 or atypical BIME. BIME are reported to have several functions:
mRNA stabilization, transcription termination, translational control and genomic rearrangements [22]. Using
the MOSAIC database we identified 100 loops associated
with BIME. BIME coordinates were obtained from the
"short repeated palindromes in enterobacteria" Web site
[23]. They are distributed as follows: in 31 cases, a BIME
was present within the loop. In 29 cases, the BIME covered
the entire loop region and extended into flanking
backbone sequences. In 40 cases, the BIME accounted for
more than 50% of the loop length and extended over to
one side of the backbone. Results concerning BIME distribution in backbone and loops on the K-12 genome (Table
3) clearly indicate that loops are enriched in BIME elements: in particular 2/3 of the DNA regions associated to
BIME are located on the loops. This tendency is particularly striking for BIME-1, for which 71 % of the cumulated
length is associated with loops. Interestingly, BIME-2 are
quasi equally distributed between backbone and loops.
This result is a generalization to all K-12 BIMEs of a result
observed in a previous work [24]. PCR analysis of 3 BIME1 and 3 BIME-2 loci in 51 E. coli and Shigella isolates
showed that BIME-1 are either present or absent among
isolates whereas BIME-2 are generally present in the same

set of isolates but exhibit a high level of length polymorphism [24]. Figure 2 illustrates two examples of loops
associated with BIME-1 and BIME-2, as visible with
MuGeN through the MOSAIC Web interface. This association of loops with BIME is a first clue in characterizing
the functionality of short loops in E. coli strains.

Backbone/loop segmentation as a step towers analysis of
genome evolution
Studying backbone and loops of bacterial genomes is an
efficient way to distinguish the two major modes of evolution acting on bacterial genomes. The backbone may be
considered as the part of the genome susceptible to vertical long-term evolution. Backbones are very similar for
closely related strains and variability comes mainly from
punctual mutations or insertions/deletions of oligonucleotides. The loop population (defined in MOSAIC as variable regions of 21 bp or more) is more heterogeneous : the
number of loops and the average loops length varies
greatly from one species to another (Table 1). Loops can
be viewed as elements issued from short-term evolution
processes. One such process is horizontal transfer. For
example acquisition/loss of distinct prophage sets seems
to be a rapid process, which can be observed between
closely related strains [25]. Significantly, for some
genomes, phages are the major contributors to loop
length [14]. Eleven loops of E. coli K-12 are associated
with phages and constitute 24 % of the total E. coli K-12
loop length. A contrasting example is found in H. pylori:
this species does not contain prophage, although it contains large loops that may be associated with pathogenicity islands [11]. Our results indicate that medium-size
loops (scale of the gene size) are constituted, at least in
part, from known variable elements of bacterial genomes
like Insertion Sequences. The relatively large number of
short loops found in some species (E. coli, B. cereus) is
quite surprising. Such small loops may be due to replication errors ('copy-choice' of DNA polymerase, slippage
mechanism), which can generate small insertions or deletions [26] or may correspond to highly polymorphic
regions. As opposed to large or medium size loops it is
likely that these shorter loops arose from non-horizontal
transfer events.

Consequences of segmentation from multiple alignments
Alignments including more than two genomes generally
yield a more robust but smaller backbone than pairwise
alignments. This is due to the fact that a larger set of
genome variations is taken into account. In the future,
about ten or more genomes will be available for some species. One possible consequence is that the backbone
length will shrink steadily with new strain genomes. In
that case, the backbone may rather be redefined as, for
example, the subset of chromosomal regions present in at
least half of the strains. Alternatively, the backbone size
may decrease but rapidly reach a minimal size, which will
be stable even when new strain genomes will be added for
alignment.

As a consequence of multiple comparisons, loop populations are greater and more heterogeneous. They include
for example elements present in only one genome (which
may correspond to acquisition of a very specific characteristic by one strain), elements present in a subset of strains
or elements present in all genomes but one (which may
correspond to a deletion in one strain). It will be
important to systematically classify loops obtained from
multiple comparisons in order to facilitate their identification through the MOSAIC interface.
To estimate the importance of loops corresponding to
DNA present in the common ancestor but lost in one of
the compared strains a preliminary study was performed:
all sequences present in the K-12 loops (from the triple
alignment) were blasted against the Salmonella
typhimurium genome (considered as the outgroup), and
matching sequences present in the same genome environment were considered as "ancestral loops". Ten loops, corresponding to a total length of 3658 bp, matched this
criterium. This suggests that only a minor subset of the
loops correspond to deletions that occurred in either E.
coli Sakai or CFT genomes.
Backbone/loops segmentation for divergent or rearranged
genomes
Some genomes of species like Buchnera aphidicola were too
divergent to be segmented with our procedure. In fact,
these genomes are clearly atypical in terms of evolutionary
distance within a species: despite complete colinearity of
their genomes, B. aphidicola Sg and Ap genomes display a
high degree of divergence at the nucleotide level, making
them as different as E. coli/S. typhimurium genomes [27].
Comparison of Sg and Ap genomes is thus almost the
same situation as comparing different species, but would
be possible by adapting the alignment parameters. This
raises the question of bacterial species definition: the evolutionary distances within a species and between species
are very heterogeneous. For example, it has recently been
confirmed that Shigella is phylogenetically indistinguisha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/171

ble from E. coli [28]. Our method will also be easily
extended to bacterial species where numerous chromosomal rearrangements have occurred, using recently
developed genome aligners such as MAUVE [29]. Intraspecies comparison of divergent and/or rearranged
genomes will open the way to segmentation of genomes
from different, but closely related species.
A new category of genome annotation
To our knowledge, this work is the first study allowing systematic mosaic genome segmentation of all available
strains (ranging from two to four) in 13 bacterial species.
Examination of the backbone of a bacterial species should
greatly facilitate refinement of gene annotation and prediction of conserved sites with potential regulatory roles.
Examination of the gene content in loops is important for
identification of putative horizontally transferred genes.
Genes adapted to specific ecological environments or
involved in pathogenicity of a specific strain should also
be found in the strain-specific loops. Indeed, the ASAP
database (A Systematic Annotation Package for community analysis of genomes) [30] recently added the features
type 'island' and 'conserved_segments' in order to provide
lists of regions that are specific or common to the two E.
coli K-12 and O157:H7 genomes.

Conclusion
Genome aligners were used to build a robust strategy for
bacterial genome segmentation. Backbone/loops structures were systematically determined for 38 bacterial
genomes. The MOSAIC resource makes it easy to visualize, annotate, and analyse loops and backbone segments
of these genomes. First analyses reveal a surprising diversity in the number of loops from one species to another.
In addition some species accumulate a large number of
short loops, unsuspected previously.

Methods
Species selection
Complete bacterial genomes were downloaded from the
NCBI
microbial
genome
database:
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi?view=1, version of 06/24/2004. Twenty one species (55 genomes) for
which genome sequences of at least two different strains
are available were selected for analysis: Agrobacterium
tumefaciens, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Buchnera
aphidicola, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Escherichia coli,
Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, Prochlorococcus marinus,
Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus,
Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Tropheryma whipplei, Vibrio vulnificus,
Xylella fastidiosa, and Yersinia pestis [see Additional file 1].

Segmentation strategy
Backbone/loop segmentations were determined using a
simple procedure based on Mummer3 [7] and MGA [8]
results (see figure 1).
Selection of genomes without rearrangement
In the first step, the subset of genomes for which it is possible to define a reliable backbone was identified using
mummer and mummerplot scripts of the Mummer3
package. First, all Maximal Exact Matches (MEM, not necessarily unique) of at least 20 bp in both forward and
reverse strands of the compared genomes were computed
using the mummer program. Visualization of results
between each pair of sequences was then performed using
the mummerplot program. This graphical visualization
was used to decide whether a common backbone could be
defined for the considered genomes. In several cases, this
step led us to adjust one of the genomes before the segmentation step. Two operators were defined: the reverse
complement operator, named RC, and the translation
operator, named TRx, where x indicates that bases from
position 1 to x were transferred to the end of the genome.
This number x of bases shifted to the end of the genome
was determined by the position of the first aligned MEM
detected by MGA between the two genomes. These operators allowed us to assign the same strand and the same
start position to all compared genomes. They were
applied to a subset of genomes before alignment with
MGA software. Genomes where rearrangements covering
more than half of the total length were detected by mummerplot and excluded at this step. They can not be handled properly by MGA and would therefore lead to
inaccurate segmentation.
Backbone/loop segmentation
The second step was to use the MGA software to perform
whole genome alignments on the subset of selected
genomes and to define backbone and loops. MGA is a
powerful multiple genome aligner which presents two
major advantages. First, it performs simultaneous multiple alignments based on MEM (Maximal Exact Matches
present in all aligned genomes) selection, without considering any genome as the reference. Second, a consistent
and robust backbone for the aligned genomes can be
defined using its MEM anchoring algorithm followed by
treatment of gaps (i.e. regions between the anchored
MEM). Parameters used in MGA were adjusted by comparison with a manually curated reference set of loops of
two E. coli strains: K-12 and O157:H7 Sakai [16]. After
Mummer 1 alignment, backbone/loop junctions were
extracted and systematically aligned using the fasta3 algorithm. Each alignment was checked by eye inspection and
in many cases, the backbone sequence was extended by a
few to several base pair [Pr. T. Hayashi, personal communication]. Further analysis using whole genome PCR scan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/171

ning confirmed that the loops longer than 500 pb are
indeed variable elements [31]. A simple treatment of
MGA alignment results was developed to define the
boundaries of loops and to enhance their concordance
with this manually determined pairwise reference dataset
[see 'Results' section, 'Validation of segmentation parameters' subsection]
Coverage calculation and database integration
Results of MGA alignments were generated in XML format. Backbone/loop segmentations were processed with a
Perl script using the SAX module for XML parsing. For
each aligned genome, backbone and loop coordinates
were computed and coverage (length of the backbone
divided by total length of the genome) was calculated.
Results were then integrated into the MOSAIC relational
database. The database was implemented using the PostgreSQL relational database system. The MOSAIC relational model is generic and not dedicated to any
alignment tool or genome species. The Web interface was
also written in Perl language using standard modules for
database access (DBI module for DataBase Interface) and
dynamic pages (CGI module for Common Gateway Interface). Different graphical visualizations of the backbone/
loop structure were developed using the MuGeN software
[19] and the cirdna program which is part of the EMBOSS
package [32].
