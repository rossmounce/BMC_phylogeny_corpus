Abstract
Background: Cervical carcinoma (CC) is a leading cause of death among women worldwide.
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a major etiological factor in CC and HPV 16 is the more frequent
viral type present. Our aim was to characterize metabolic pathways altered in HPV 16 tumor
samples by means of transcriptome wide analysis and bioinformatics tools for visualizing expression
data in the context of KEGG biological pathways.
Results: We found 2,067 genes significantly up or down-modulated (at least 2-fold) in tumor
clinical samples compared to normal tissues, representing ~3.7% of analyzed genes. Cervical
carcinoma was associated with an important up-regulation of Wnt signaling pathway, which was
validated by in situ hybridization in clinical samples. Other up-regulated pathways were those of
calcium signaling and MAPK signaling, as well as cell cycle-related genes. There was down-regulation
of focal adhesion, TGF-β signaling, among other metabolic pathways.
Conclusion: This analysis of HPV 16 tumors transcriptome could be useful for the identification
of genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma. Understanding
the possible role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of CC deserves further studies.

Background
Cervical carcinoma (CC) is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Epidemiologic and experimental studies have
identified a causal role of high risk HPV types in cervical
carcinogenesis [1,2]. HPV 16 is the predominant type with
prevalence ranging from 43.9% to 72.4%, followed by
HPV 18 with 15% of the CC cases [3]. Persistent viral

infection in combination with strong, constitutive expression of E6 and E7 viral oncogenes is a necessary step for
malignant transformation because these proteins interact
with p53 and pRB proteins leading to their degradation
and deregulation of the cell cycle [4,5]. Moreover, E6 and
E7 target additional cellular proteins and transcriptional
regulators [reviewed in [6,7]], cellular targets of E6 and E7
includes several cellular transcription regulators [8,9].

Finally, at DNA level E6 and E7 deregulate cell proliferation and induce genetic instability, which promote the
accumulation of mutations and aneuploidy [10]. In conclusion, viral oncoproteins have a profound impact in
global profile of expressed genes, which could be analyzed by transcriptome wide analysis methodologies. One
of these techniques is DNA oligonucleotide-based microarray technology, which allows a rapid and high throughput detection of thousands of transcripts simultaneously
[11-13].
There are several studies published related to gene expression profiles in HPV infected cells, which have mainly
addressed gene expression levels in cultured keratinocytes
[14-19]; these studies explain several aspects concerned to
molecular mechanisms induced or modified by E6 and E7
viral oncoproteins. Regarding changes in gene expression
in CC clinical samples, there are a few papers comparing
normal cervical expressed genes versus tumor samples
[20-23], with the major aim to find potential tumour
markers of clinical value none of them has examined
whole genome expression. Hence, to further identify
genes and molecular pathways associated with HPV16CC, we performed a whole genome expression profile of
primary tumors and normal cervical tissues.
Our results identified novel deregulated genes and candidate regulatory pathways in CC tissues. The altered regulatory pathways identified were: focal adhesion MAPK,
calcium signaling and Wnt. This last one is involved in
various differentiation events during embryonic development in mammals leading to tumor formation when is
aberrantly activated [24,25]. Overexpression of four genes
of the Wnt signaling pathway was validated by in situ
hybridization on Tissue Microarrays (TMAs). These results
improve our knowledge about molecular alterations in
CC pathogenesis.

Results
Gene expression profile of HPV 16 squamous cervical
carcinoma
Our major aim was to identify the gene expression profile
in HPV 16 positive CC by wide genome analysis. Therefore, we used the Human Whole Genome CodeLink
microarrays, which have the enough sensitivity to detect
as little as one transcript per cell and the specificity to distinguish among highly homologous sequences. This array
contains a broad range of genes derived from publicly
available mRNA sequences (over 55,000 genes and ESTs
probes) [26]. After cluster filtering was done (see Methods), 6,007 probes corresponding to 3,248 characterized
transcripts were obtained. We reanalyzed this data set
using a supervised approach with Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM) [27]; obtaining 1,007 and 1,060 genes

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/16

that were significantly up and down-regulated, respectively with a false discovery rate <10% (Additional file 1).
Cluster Analysis
To obtain a graphical representation of the differences
between normal and tumor tissues, cluster analysis was
performed on all samples. The phylogenetic tree resulting
from the hierarchical complete linkage clustering algorithm is shown in figure 1b. In this method of clustering,
relationships among objects (genes or samples) are represented by a tree whose branch lengths reflect the degree of
similarity between the objects, as assessed by a pairwise
similarity function. The computed trees can be used to
arrange individual samples in the original data table, this
allows the samples or groups of samples with similar
expression patterns to be shown adjacent to each other. In
general, tumor samples showed a higher grade of homology among them compared with normal samples which
had a more heterogeneous gene expression profile. This
observation suggests that although HPV infection is associated with several changes in the host cell, in late stages
of the carcinogenesis process the pattern of gene expression induced by HPV 16 infection is very similar. However, it is also possible that the similarities observed in
tumor samples were due to the rigorous procedure used to
select our patients that included age, clinical stage, and
contraceptive oral status.
Pathway Analysis
In order to identify the biological meaning of changes in
gene expression, genes examined by significance analysis
of microarrays (SAM) were submitted to the visualization
tool Pathway Express (PE, a component of Onto-Tools
suite). This recently developed bioinformatic tool is
employed for visualizing expression data in the context of
KEGG biological pathways, the importance PE is that
retrieves an impact factor (IF) of the entire pathway
involved, which can help to obtain a clearer notion of the
alteration level in each biological pathway [28]. We
imported a list of significantly up and down regulated
genes into the program to convert the expression data into
illustrations in an attempt to explore altered mechanisms
in CC (additional file 1). To overcome any possible incorrect IF in altered pathways due to different size of samples,
we submitted a similar quantity of up and down regulated
genes onto PE. This allowed confirming that genes
involved in several metabolic pathways were altered in
HPV16+ CC (Figure 2). As seen, cellular pathways altered
in CC are related to the maintenance of malignant process
such as decrease in focal adhesion, overexpression in Wntsignalling and cell cycle pathways (Figures 2, 3 and 4).

One of the most altered cellular pathways in CC was focal
adhesion. We were able to identify a reduced expression
of many of genes of this pathway, especially those coding

for extracellular matrix in tumor samples. Nevertheless,
some of them, such as laminins were slightly up-regulated
(Additional file 2).
In this work we analyzed squamous CC with clinical stage
IIB (according to FIGO nomenclature); this kind of
tumours are highly invasive, hence the down modulation
of some genes related to focal adhesion is an important
step that could precede the highly metastatic grade in
more advanced clinical stages IIIA and IIIB.
An important gene linked to this process is PTEN (Figure
3), which is considered to be a candidate tumour suppressor gene and has been frequently found mutated in several
types of human tumors including cervical carcinomas

[29]. Concordantly, this gene was down regulated in CC
(Additional file 2).
Of the up-regulated pathways found, we focused on the
Wnt signalling pathway. A connection between Wnt signaling and human disease has been established by findings
in malignancies such as colorectal [30], gastric [31], CC
[32] and hepatocellular carcinomas [33]. The common
mechanism altered in those examples is the activation of
gene transcription by an accumulation of β-catenin in the
nucleus, with recent evidence of an aberrant nuclear and
cytoplasmic expression of β-catenin in CC cells [34], indicating a possible role in cervical carcinoma development.
Genes of this pathway up-regulated in CC tumor cells
were JUN, MYC, FZD2, RAC1, GSK3B and CTNNB1, and

pathways reported here could reflect not only alterations
induced by this viral type but also with other high risk
HPVs. In this regard, some of genes mentioned here have
been previously reported as typically altered in CC or
involved in the process of carcinogenesis. These include cmyc, ras, fos, NF-κB, EGFR, β-catenin, etc. [35-38] (Additional file 2). Strong evidence in the literature indicates a
determinant role of these genes in cervical carcinogenesis
and this validates the approach employed here.

a few others (Additional file 2). Because of the possible
relevance of this pathway, we validated these findings by
in situ hybridization of four of its genes.
In situ hybridization (ISH)
We selected four genes (FZD2, GSK3β, PPARδ and CMYC) of the Wnt signaling pathway to validate the overexpression found in the microarray assay in CC samples.

Normal cervical tissues showed a dull staining for FZD2,
C-MYC and PPARδ in majority of the cells and layers of
the epithelium, whereas GSK3β stained bright and strong
in the cytoplasm in the middle layers of the epithelium.
The staining was also observed in the adjacent stroma. All
high grade precancerous cervical lesions (HGSIL) showed
numerous FZD2, GSK3β, C-MYC and PPARδ positive
cells. The percentage of FZD2, GSK3β, C-MYC and PPARδ
positive cells, was higher in HGSIL than in normal cervical
epithelium. Even a strong staining was observed in the
adjacent stroma compared to the reaction present in normal cervical epithelium surrounding stroma. In general,
the intensity of reaction and the number of FZD2, GSK3β,
C-MYC and PPARδ positive cells in CC were slightly but
stronger than HGSIL and normal samples (Figure 5).

Discussion
In the present work, we identified genes that were up-regulated in HPV16 CC by means of whole genome microarrays in relation to normal cervical HPV negative cells.
Although we did not compare different tissue samples
infected with distinct HPV types, the gene list and cellular

The protein network in KEGG is an abstract graphical representation of gene products, that include not just the
pathway resulting from direct protein-protein interactions, but also the metabolic network viewed as a framework of enzymes and the regulatory gene network viewed
at the level of interaction between transcription factors
and target products. The "PATHWAY" database is a collection of manually drawn diagrams called the KEGG reference pathway diagrams (maps), each corresponding to a
known network of functional significance [39].
Thus, a systematic evaluation of differential regulation in
metabolic pathways is shown in Figure 2. Some of these
biological pathways have an important role in the carcinogenesis process in several models meaning that could
have it also in CC. In this context, Wnt pathway has been
proposed as a promoter of HPV-induced human keratinocyte transformation, also promotes activation of the cell
cycle, following the initiation of frizzled cascade, a rise in
the level and accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus
induces transcriptionally active products of the Tcf family
of transcription factors, which target positive regulators of
cell cycle, such as c-myc, cyclin D and c-jun [40,41] all of
them over-expressed in our analysis.
As seen in (figures 2 and 6), TGF-β pathway was down regulated in CC. This pathway is critical for maintaining
homeostatic of growth control not only in premalignant
cells but also in cells progressing through the early stages
of carcinogenesis. Central to its growth inhibitory effects,
at least in vitro, is its ability to suppress expression of cMyc and to enhance expression of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p15INK4b and p21CIP1. Effects of TGFβ on genomic stability, replicative senescence, and apoptosis also come into play in particular cell types [reviewed
in [42]]. Consistently, in the present analysis we found a
down regulation in TGF-β signalling pathway in cervical
tumours. A previous report by Nees et al. has shown a
TGF-β strong down modulation by HPV-16 E6 and E7
viral oncoproteins. They also demonstrated that many of
the genes that were perturbed by E6 and E7 in differentiating keratinocytes were TGF-β-responsive [43].
Smad proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling
of TGF-β. Upon TGF-β receptor activation, Smad2 and

Smad3 become phosphorylated and form heteromeric
complexes with Smad4. These complexes translocate to
the nucleus where they control expression of target genes.
Lee et al have shown that HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein blocks
TGF-β signaling by blocking binding of the Smad complex
to its target DNA sequence. E7 binds to Smad2, Smad3,
and Smad4, and blocks binding of Smad3 to its DNA
binding site [44]. Moreover, at transcriptional level loss of
Smad 2 and 4 expressions in human cervical carcinomas
has been observed [45]. We showed in the present analysis a down regulation of Smad's expression in cervical
tumours (Additional file 2). These observations could
support the function of TGF-β as tumor suppressors in cervical epithelia and also confirm that loss of TGF-β expression in HPV-infected keratinocytes is not restricted to cell
cultures. Thus, down-regulation of TGF-β and its signaling
pathway by HPV could represent an important mechanism contributing to growth stimulation, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.
Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal intracellular second messenger that activates many cellular functions, such as gene

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/16

expression, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
aging, cell adhesion, cell migration, etc. An increase in
cytosolic calcium concentration has been related to oncogene activation [46], wound repair as well as in the initiation and promotion of tumors [47]. A key element of
calcium-dependent cell activation is the release of calcium
ions into the cytosol from the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) through calcium channels activated by the
second messenger myo-D-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
(IP3R) and ryanodine (RyR)-dependent Ca2+ channel
[48]. In the present work, we found up-regulation of both
calcium channels suggesting an increase of Ca2+ in CC
cells (Additional file 2 and figure 7) [49]. IP3R overexpression in cultures of gastric cancer cells correlated with peritoneal dissemination [50]. Meanwhile activation of
ryanodine receptors was shown in a neuroblastoma cell
line [51]. Although we found co expression of SERCA
genes, which are involved in decrease levels of cytosolic
calcium [reviewed in [47]], there was also an-up regulation of ryanodine and IP3 receptors; which are involved in
raising calcium levels. Therefore, regulation of Ca2+ levels
in cancer cells appear to be more complex and subsequent
studies are needed to clarify it.

Conclusion
Previous expression profiling studies have been limited to
the identification of genes aberrantly expressed in CC that
could be used as molecular markers. We combined wide
transcriptome analysis and biological pathway characterization to identify cellular pathways with an aberrant
expression of a significant proportion of genes in CC. This
allowed us to confirm aberrations in molecular pathways
known to be important in cervical cancer such as Wnt and
TGF-β signaling, and cell cycle regulation with validation
of over-expression of genes of the Wnt-signalling pathway. The importance of this work is that it defines new
altered metabolic pathways, such as calcium signaling,
and genes involved improving our knowledge of the
molecular alterations in CC pathogenesis. The meaning of
the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of CC
deserves further studies.

Methods
Tissues for array hybridization
Eight fresh biopsies of Invasive squamous CC Stage IIB
HPV16, were taken during colposcopy. Three normal cervixes from women who had been subjected to hysterectomy due to uterine myomatosis were obtained; these
were also verified to be negative with Pap smears and also
confirmed by histopathological analysis. All samples were
taken from the Dysplasia Clinic at General Hospital of
Mexico, SS and all patients were in reproductive age and
none of them had received hormonal therapy or contraceptives. The described procedures were evaluated and
approved by the local ethics committee of the Mexican

Institute of Social Security and written informed consent
was obtained from patients.
All tissue samples were longitudinally divided in three
sections, the central part was snapped frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70°C until nucleic acid extraction,
and the other two parts were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol and paraffin embedded at the Department of Pathology, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center SXXI,
Mexico. Serial sections from these fractions were stained
by Haematoxilin/Eosin and inspected to confirm the presence of at least 70% of tumoral cells in the tissue. Multiple
step sections were made and classified according to the
International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(FIGO). Normal tissue samples were considered as such
when at least 80% of the sample consisted of epithelial
ectocervical normal tissue and HPV infection absence.
Tissue samples for ISH
Fifteen LSILS paraffin blocks were used to obtain the normal cervical tissue samples which were adjacent to the low
grade lesions, and also 50 paraffin blocks: 25 CC and 25
HGSIL were randomly collected from the files of the
National Center of Dysplasias in Mexico City. The tissue
microarrays were constructed as previously described
[52]. One of the TMAs contained the 25 HGSIL tissues,
another one contained all the CC samples and finally a
"normal tissue microarray" was elaborated.
HPV detection and typing
Genomic DNA was extracted from the phenol phase left
by TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL, USA) and amplified by
PCR specific primers for HPV 16 [53]. PCR products were
separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Only
dysplastic lesions with HPV 16 infection were included in
this study. PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer Thermal cycler 480, with the following conditions, after an initial 5-min denaturing step at 95°C, the following 35
cycles were at 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C
for 1 min.; followed by a single step of 72°C for 5 min.
PCR mix without DNA was used as negative control.
In Situ Hybridization (ISH)
Briefly, five-micron tissue sections were obtained from
TMA paraffin blocks, deparaffinized and rehydrated in a
graded ethanol series and transferred to PBS solution. Tissues were digested with DNase solution (1 µg/ml) for 10
min at 37°C. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by
incubation in hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 3%.
Sense and antisense probes for FZD2, GSK3β, PPARδ and
c-myc genes were generated by single-strand PCR using
specific cDNA obtained from SiHa cells RNA as template
and labeled with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche). Hybridization
was carried out for 14 hrs at 37°C. After hybridization,
stringent wash in Tris-buffered saline with Tween buffer

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/16

1× (TBST 10×: 500 nmol/L TrisHCL, pH 7.6, 3 mol/L
NaCl, 1% Tween 20), at 55°C for 20 min was done.
Finally the signal was developed using GenPoint System
(DAKO, Glonstrup Denmark) according to manufacturer.
Finally, the slides were hematoxylin counterstained, dehydrated in graded ethanol and mounted. Negative controls
for ISH were carried out with the sense probes or with a
treatment with RNAse solution (100 mg/ml for 30 min at
37°C) prior ISH.
Interpretation and quantification
Cells were noted as positive for FZD2 when the staining
was confined to the plasma membrane, while GSK3β, CMYC and PPARδ were expressed in the cytoplasm. Only
the neoplastic region or the epithelium of each tissue section was evaluated. Two slides were analyzed for each
sample. To asses the stained cytoplasm the slides were
reviewed at ×40 magnification. The percentage of positive
cells in each tissue section was estimated based on a semiquantitative scale where: 0% (absent), 1–5% (sporadic),
6–25% (local), 26–50% (occasional), 51–75% (majority), 76–100% (large majority of the tumoral area or epithelium). After the examination of the slides by three
independent observers, a global agreement was reached.
Regarding staining, only those with an intensity of: +
(dull), ++ (clear) or +++ (bright) were scored.
