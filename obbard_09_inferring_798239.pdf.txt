Abstract
Background: Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex are the primary vectors of
human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Many host genes have been shown to affect Plasmodium
development in the mosquito, and so are expected to engage in an evolutionary arms race with the
pathogen. However, there is little conclusive evidence that any of these mosquito genes evolve
rapidly, or show other signatures of adaptive evolution.
Methods: Three serine protease inhibitors have previously been identified as candidate immune
system genes mediating mosquito-Plasmodium interaction, and serine protease inhibitors have
been identified as hot-spots of adaptive evolution in other taxa. Population-genetic tests for
selection, including a recent multi-gene extension of the McDonald-Kreitman test, were applied to
16 serine protease inhibitors and 16 other genes sampled from the An. gambiae species complex in
both East and West Africa.
Results: Serine protease inhibitors were found to show a marginally significant trend towards
higher levels of amino acid diversity than other genes, and display extensive genetic structuring
associated with the 2La chromosomal inversion. However, although serpins are candidate targets
for strong parasite-mediated selection, no evidence was found for rapid adaptive evolution in these
genes.
Conclusion: It is well known that phylogenetic and population history in the An. gambiae complex
can present special problems for the application of standard population-genetic tests for selection,
and this may explain the failure of this study to detect selection acting on serine protease inhibitors.
The pitfalls of uncritically applying these tests in this species complex are highlighted, and the future
prospects for detecting selection acting on the An. gambiae genome are discussed.

Background
By vectoring Plasmodium parasites, Anopheles mosquitoes
are a central component of the Malaria crisis. Consequently, there has been a substantial effort to identify the
genes involved in the mosquito immune response against
Plasmodium, including studies to identify genes associated

with variation in vector competence [1-4]. It has been
widely hypothesized that these immune response genes
may be subject to strong parasite-mediated selection, such
as that which occurs in a coevolutionary 'arms-race' [5,6].
Such arms-races involve strong reciprocally-antagonistic
selection, leading to the frequent and rapid fixation of

new alleles. This reduces within-species diversity, while
driving between-species protein divergence, and leaves a
genomic signature of past selection that can be identified
through DNA sequence analysis [7,8]. Thus, DNA
sequence analysis and the tools of population genetics can
augment understanding of immune gene function in
host-parasite interaction by identifying genes that are the
target of parasite adaptation, and even distinguish
between forms of parasite-mediated selection [5,6,9].
Population genetic methods have previously shed light on
the nature and intensity of selection in both mammalian
and Drosophila immune systems. For example, Drosophila
studies have suggested that pathogens which manipulate
signal transduction pathways or the antiviral RNAi pathway have been a major selective force [10,11]. In Anopheles
mosquitoes, the potential for immune-related genes to
determine vector competence provides a clear incentive to
elucidate the selective forces that drive evolution. Serine
protease inhibitors (serpins, or SRPNs) are prime candidates for such parasite-mediated selection in Anopheles
mosquitoes. Serpins comprise a large and rapidly evolving

super-family of proteins (reviewed in [12,13]) with key
roles in the immune systems of vertebrates [14] and invertebrates [15]. In particular, Drosophila serpins, such as Nec
and SRPN27A, modulate two of the most important
defense pathways: the Toll-pathway [16,17], and the melanization cascade [18,19], and many are up-regulated on
septic injury (Spn28D, SRPN27A, Spn5, CG6687 and
Spn4, see [20]). Moreover, some Drosophila serpins display very high rates of amino acid substitution, and/or
other signatures of adaptive evolution, e.g. [21-23].
Three Anopheles serpins have been experimentally associated with Plasmodium-interaction phenotypes (see Table
1). In Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi SRPN10 is
expressed in the mosquito midgut and in haemocytes
[24], and during Plasmodium berghei (a rodent parasite)
invasion of the midgut epithelium SRPN10 moves from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and its expression is strongly
induced [25]. SRPN6 is also expressed in infected midgut
epithelial cells and in haemocytes, and again its expression is strongly induced by P. berghei invasion in both An.
gambiae and An. stephensi. The expression of SRPN6 is also

induced by the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum
[26]. RNAi knockdown of SRPN6 in An. stephensi resulted
in a significant increase in the number of developing P.
berghei oocysts, and although knockdown had no effect
on oocyst numbers in susceptible strains of An. gambiae,
in a resistant strain, the number of melanized P. berghei
ookinetes was significantly increased [26]. More recently
it has also been shown that SRPN6 is induced in the salivary glands of An. gambiae in response to P. berghei sporozoite invasion, and knock-down of SRPN6 by RNAi
significantly increases the number of sprozoites reaching
the salivary glands [27]. Finally, knockdown of SRPN2 in
P. berghei-susceptible An. gambiae has a broadly opposite
effect, resulting in a 97% decrease in oocyst formation
through increased lysis and melanization, following midgut invasion [28].
Here, population-genetic approaches are used to search
for evidence of natural selection acting on 16 serpin genes
in the An. gambiae species complex, including those implicated in immune function. First, by comparing serpins to
other nearby genes, patterns of genetic diversity within
and between populations of An. gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, and Anopheles melas are used to identify loci that
deviate strongly from neutral predictions. Second, a recent
extension of the McDonald-Kreitman test is used to test
for evidence of adaptive substitution between species
[29,30]. The data are then discussed in terms of on-going
population processes in the An. gambiae complex, many
of which have important implications for the robust inference of selection.
Serpins were found to have slightly higher levels of amino
acid diversity than other genes, consistent with either
reduced constraint, or potentially with balancing selection. In common with previous analyses. [31], considerable structuring of genetic diversity in the SRPN1-2-3
cluster was found in association with the 2La chromosomal inversion. However, although serpins are good a
priori candidates as targets for strong 'arms-race' selection,
as with similar studies on other Anopheles gambiae
immune-related genes (e.g. [6,32-34]), the tests for adaptive evolution presented here are largely inconclusive. The
results show how standard population-genetic tests for
selection may be difficult to apply in the An. gambiae species complex; this is due to for both demographic and
phylogenetic factors that are already widely known, and
further supported by the present data.

Methods
Samples
Anopheles gambiae individuals were collected from West
Africa ('BK': Burkina Faso, Koubri village, 12°11'54 N;
1°23'43W) and East Africa ('KY': Kenya, Mbita, Suba District). Anopheles arabiensis individuals were also collected

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

from West Africa ('BK', in the same collections as An. gambiae, above) and East Africa ('TZ', Tanzania, Ifakara). All
An. gambiae and An. arabiensis used in this study were provided by H. M. Ferguson (University of Glasgow, UK).
Anopheles melas individuals were collected from Coastal
Ghana (Ghana, Essiama, 4°57.4 N; 2°24.1W) by N. Tuno
(Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University,
Japan). Anopheles merus and Anopheles quadriannulatus species A (hereafter An. quadriannulatus) were both obtained
from laboratory colonies, maintained by the Medical
Research Council of South Africa (provided by R. Maharaj; MRC, Durban, South Africa) and the University of
Wageningen (Strain 'Sangqua', Zimbabwe, provided by
W. Takken), respectively.
The species identity of all gambiae complex members was
verified by diagnostic PCR [35], and the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae were distinguished by PCR-RFLP
[e.g. [36]]. As expected from their known geographic distributions [37], all KY An. gambiae individuals were S
form, and all but two of the BK An. gambiae sample were
M-form. All An. gambiae individuals were also surveyed
for 2La/+ chromosomal inversion status, using the PCR
assay of White et al [38], derived from the sequenced
breakpoints [39]. As reported previously, in addition to
the expected diagnostic 207 bp and 492 bp fragment
lengths, these primers were found to amplify fragments of
lengths ca. 687 bp, 672 bp, 760 bp and 1020 bp in some
individuals [32]. Direct sequencing of these fragments
from a subset of individuals suggest they are insertion/
deletion derivatives of expected assay products [32,40],
and within the polymorphic KY population the 2La/2L+a
amplification fragments were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (51 individuals, χ2 = 0.44, 1df., p = 0.51), allowing
us to tentatively assign 2La/2L+a inversion status to all
individuals [32].
Loci
Thirty-two loci were selected for sequencing and analysis,
including 16 of the 18 serpins currently identified in the
An. gambiae genome (M. Kanost and K. Michel, pers.
comm.), and 16 other protein-coding loci chosen to
match the genomic position of the serpins without regard
to function. SRPN19 (a non-inhibitory serpin with 1:1:1
orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti and An.
gambiae) and SRPN13, which does not appear in the current An. gambiae assembly, were not sequenced. The total
sequenced length was ~19 Kbp of coding sequence per
individual (i.e. approximately 600 bp from each locus;
range 240 bp–800 bp). Not all loci were sequenced from
the same individuals within populations, and not all loci
were amplified from An. melas. A full summary of gene
names, locations, and classification is presented in Table
1.

The 'control' loci should represent an unbiased sample of
Anopheles genes, to which serpins can be compared.
Because these control genes are position-matched, each
lying ~90 Kbp (range 40–125 Kbp) from a 'partner' serpin, they should control for the effects of large-scale position-based variation in recombination and mutation
rates. Note that improvements to the An. gambiae annotation have subsequently identified control locus 5 (previously annotated as ENSANGG000008091) as deriving
from a retrotransposon (AgamP3.4, July, 2007).
PCR and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from single mosquitoes
using DNeasy kits (QIAgen). PCR primers were designed
from the published An. gambiae genome sequence [41],
and the final primer sequences selected after troubleshooting (sequences are given in Additional file 1). Only
one PCR amplicon was used per locus, thus sequences do
not represent entire genes. Following PCR, unincorporated primers and dNTPs were removed using exonuclease
I (New England BioLabs) and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham). PCR products were sequenced in
both directions using BigDye™ reagents (v3.1, Applied
BioSystems) and an ABI capillary sequencer. In some
amplicons, indel polymorphism required the use of additional sequencing primers. The sequence chromatograms
were assembled using SeqManII (DNAstar Inc., Madison
USA) then inspected by eye to confirm the validity of all
differences within and between species and all heterozygous base-calls. The heterozygous sequence from each
diploid individual was decomposed into two pseudohaplotypes for analysis using PHASE [42,43]. However, the
presented analyses should be highly robust to any errors
in phase assignment, as only explicitly tree-based results,
such as Hudson's nearest neighbour statistic (Snn), are
affected by allelic phase. All unphased sequences have
been submitted to GenBank as population sets, using
ambiguity codes to indicate heterozygous sites. Sequence
accession numbers span the range GQ146469–
GQ148534.
Divergence, diversity and differentiation
The number of synonymous and non-synonymous polymorphisms and substitutions, and the average pairwise
genetic diversity (π) were calculated using DnaSP [version
4.50.3, ref [44]]. Diversity was calculated separately for
synonymous (πs) and non-synonymous (πa) sites, and
used a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple substitutions,
as implemented in DnaSP. Departures from the allele frequency spectrum expected under the standard neutral
model were quantified using Tajima's D statistic [45], also
calculated using DnaSP. Tajima's D (which measures
departures from the expected allele frequency distribution
under a standard neutral model) was calculated using synonymous sites only, and was calculated separately for

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

both populations of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis (but
not for An. melas, where sample sizes were too small to
give meaningful results). The significance of departures
from the expected allele frequency distribution were
tested using 10,000 rounds of coalescent simulation (as
implemented in DnaSP) conditional on the number of
segregating sites and conservatively assuming no recombination within loci.
Genetic differentiation between populations was quantified in DnaSP using Hudson's KST statistic [equations 7 to
9 in reference 46] which is calculated from the average
number of pairwise differences between sequences taken
within populations and between all populations, and is
identical to Nei's γST [47] except for the population-size
weighting scheme [see [46]]. Significant departures from
zero population differentiation were inferred by permuting sequences between populations to create a null distribution of KST values. All non-parametric statistical tests on
diversity and differentiation were performed using the R
statistical language (R Development Core Team, 2008
http://www.R-project.org). Although non-parametric tests
(Spearman's rank correlation, paired Wilcoxon tests) are
presented below, except where noted explicitly, parametric equivalents (Pearson's correlation, paired t-tests) gave
qualitatively identical results.
The proportion of adaptive substitutions
If it is assumed that synonymous mutations are effectively
neutral, and that the fixation or loss of selected aminoacid variants is so rapid that the vast majority of non-synonymous polymorphisms are also effectively neutral,
then the relative numbers of polymorphisms (P, within
species) and fixed differences (D, between species) at synonymous and non-synonymous sites can be used to identify the action of selection [see [7] for an introduction].
This forms the basis of the McDonald-Kreitman test [MK
test, [29]], which seeks to detect a departure from independence in a simple 2 × 2 contingency table of polymorphisms (PN and PS) and fixed differences (DN and DS). For
a single gene, the departure from neutrality can easily be
quantified by summary statistic such as the neutrality
index (N.I.= (PN/PS)/(DN/DS) [48]), or by the estimated
proportion of adaptive substitutions (α = 1 - (DSPN)/
(DNPS) = 1 - N.I., [49]). This approach can be extended to
multiple genes using DS, PN, DN and PS averaged across
genes [49], or using a more sophisticated maximum-likelihood estimator of α, such as that of Bierne and EyreWalker [50].

Here, an extension of the maximum-likelihood method of
Welch [30] was used. This method is very closely related
to that of Bierne and Eyre-Walker [50], but additionally
allows for the possibility that some apparent fixed differences may actually be polymorphisms that only appear

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:117

fixed due to small sample size [51]. The method was
extended to include polymorphism values from two species simultaneously e.g. [29,51]. Using this approach,
models were fitted in which expected neutral divergence,
λ = μt, took a single value at all loci; expected neutral
diversity, θ = 4Neμ, was also shared between all loci, but
free to vary between species; and selective constraint, f,
was free to vary between loci [see [30] for other details of
the model]. Three nested models were fitted, in which (1)
α was constrained to zero at all loci, i.e. no adaptive evolution, (2) a single α was shared by all genes, and (3) α
was free to differ between serpins and 'control' genes. In
this way, it was possible to test both for evidence of adaptive evolution, and whether serpins have a different rate of
adaptive evolution to other genes. Model fit was tested
using both likelihood ratio tests and Akaike weighting
(derived from the Akaike information criterion) [52].
Confidence intervals on α were obtained by adjusting α
away from its maximum likelihood value, and allowing
the other parameters to take their maximum likelihood
value, conditional on that α, until log likelihood
decreased by 2 units [50]. C code to fit these models is
available on request from the authors, or from [53].

Results
Synonymous site diversity
Across all 32 loci, average pairwise genetic diversity at synonymous sites (πs) was highest in An. gambiae (πs = 2.82%,
95% bootstrap interval 2.25–3.41%), lowest in An. melas
(πs = 0.86%, 0.53–1.19%), and intermediate in An. arabiensis (πs = 1.97%, [1.50, 2.46]; Figure 1a). The difference
in πs between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis was highly
significant (Paired Wilcox test using 32 loci, V = 444, p =
0.0004), and πs correlated strongly between these species
(Spearman's rho = 0.72, S = 1504, p < 6 × 10-6, Additional
file 2). Diversity in An. gambiae and An. arabiensis did not
correlate with diversity in An. melas (p > 0.5 in both cases,
26 loci). For a full summary of synonymous diversity, and
all other summary stats that follow, see Additional file 3.

For An. gambiae, genetic diversity was slightly higher in
West Africa (πs = 2.74%; BK M-form) than in East Africa
(πs = 2.17%; KY S-form), and although the effect was
small, it was statistically significant (Paired Wilcox V =
380, p = 0.03, Figure 1a). Diversity was also highly correlated between East- and West-African populations (Spearman's rho = 0.72, S = 1520, p = 3 × 10-6). Although only
two S-form individuals were sampled from West Africa,
they displayed higher diversity than the either of the other
two An. gambiae populations (BK S-form; πs = 2.98%).
For An. arabiensis, diversity correlated even more strongly
between East and West Africa (rho = 0.87, S = 729, p < 2 ×
10-10) and did not differ significantly between the populations (πs = 1.96% in BK vs. πs = 1.79% in TZ, Paired Wilcoxon test V = 316, p = 0.19).

Figure diversity at synonymous and non-synonymous sites
Genetic 1
Genetic diversity at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. Genetic diversity (the percentage of sites that
differ on average between haplotypes) at synonymous (πs)
and nonsynonymous (πa) sites measured at 32 loci in populations of An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and An. melas. Diversity is
shown separately for control loci (dark bars) and serpins
(pale bars), and is shown for the species as a whole, and for
each population separately. Note that although only two individuals (4 haplotypes) were sampled for S-form An. gambiae
in population BK, ~19 Kbp of sequence will provide a good
estimate of π if mating within the population is random.
Diversity was significantly higher in An. gambiae than in An.
arabiensis, and significantly lower in An. melas. For non-synonymous sites, serpins had significantly higher diversity than
control loci, but this trend was non-significant at synonymous
sites. See main text for details, and Additional File 1 for the
raw data.

Synonymous site diversity did not differ significantly
between serpins and other genes in either An. gambiae
(3.10% vs. 2.53%, Paired Wilcoxon V = 48, p = 0.32, Figure 1a) or An. arabiensis (2.00% vs. 1.93%, Paired Wilcox
V = 60, p = 0.71). Although position-matched, no correlation in diversity could be detected between serpins and
their corresponding control genes (p > 0.1 in both cases),
suggesting that the effect of genomic location on neutral
diversity was relatively weak.
Non-synonymous site diversity
Non-synonymous diversity (πa) was very similar between
An. gambiae (πa = 0.22%; 95% bootstrap interval 0.13–
0.31%) and An. arabiensis (πa = 0.18%; bootstrap interval:
0.12–0.24%, Figure 1b), and did not differ significantly
between the species (Paired Wilcoxon test V = 285, p =
0.29). Although πa did not correlate significantly with πs in
either An. gambiae or An. arabiensis (correlation coeffi-

cients were 0.17 and 0.07 respectively, p > 0.3 in both
cases), there was a strong correlation in πa between the
two species (rho = 0.81, S = 1037, p = 2 × 10-8, Additional
file 2). East and West African populations did not differ
significantly in πa for either An. gambiae or An. arabiensis (p
> 0.1 in both cases), but πa did correlate very highly
between East and West African populations (rho = 0.80 p
= 6. × 10-8, and rho = 0.88, p = 2 × 10-11, respectively).
Interestingly, πa was higher for serpins than for other
genes in both An. gambiae and An. arabiensis (πa = 0.30%
vs. 0.13%, and πa = 0.25% vs. 0.11%), although statistical
significance was marginal for An. gambiae (Paired Wilcoxon V = 30 p = 0.051, and V = 24, p = 0.024 for An. gambiae and An. arabiensis respectively, Figure 1b). Despite
fewer loci being sequenced, this effect could also be

Tajima's D statistic for synonymous sites was negative in
both populations of An. arabiensis (D = -0.29 and D = 0.38, averages across loci in TZ and BK respectively) and
in An. gambiae BK (D = -0.71, M-form individuals only),
and did not differ between serpins and other genes (Wilcoxon tests, p > 0.5 in all cases). Tajima's D did not differ
significantly between the two populations of An. arabiensis (Paired Wilcoxon V = 193, p = 0.42), but did correlate
between the populations (rho = 0.43 S = 2543.131, p =
0.017). In population BK, Tajima's D was correlated
between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis (rho = 0.490 S =
2293, p = 0.006), but was significantly more negative in
An. gambiae (Paired Wilcoxon V = 115, p = 0.015). Strikingly, Tajima's D was generally positive in An. gambiae
population KY (mean across loci 0.77, 22 out of the 28
genes with non-zero diversity had D > 0, with overall 95%
bootstrap interval [0.40, 1.15]). This was significantly
higher than in BK (Paired Wilcoxon test V = 15, p = 1 × 106).

In An. arabiensis, five genes had individually significantly
negative Tajima's D statistics (p < 0.05 in all cases, no correction for multiple tests): control loci 1 (BK and TZ) and
5 (BK), and serpins 10 (BK), 6 and 7 (TZ). In An. gambiae
population BK (M-form only) 7 genes had significantly
negative D values: serpins 7, 9 and 14, and control loci 5,
6, 10 and 11 (p < 0.05 in all cases).
Genetic differentiation between populations
In An. arabiensis, differentiation between East and West
Africa was very low (KST = 0.08) and not significantly different from zero at 15 of the 32 loci examined. In An. gambiae, differentiation between East and West Africa was
much higher (KST = 0.14; all loci except control locus 9
were individually significantly differentiated) and this difference between the species was statistically significant

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

(paired Wilcoxon test V = 392, p = 0.016). Note that this
differentiation reflects not only geographic separation,
but also differentiation between M and S molecular forms
of An. gambiae. In West Africa (BK) differentiation
between M- and S-form was very low (KST = 0.016), and
significantly lower than differentiation between S-form
sampled from East Africa and S-form sampled from West
Africa (KST = 0.073, paired Wilcoxon test V = 442, p =
0.0005). Only two S-form An. gambiae individuals were
sampled from BK, making estimates of differentiation
potentially poor and reducing the power of the test. However, assuming random mating, the estimates should not
be biased by the small number of individuals sampled,
and the large number of loci (32, ~19 Kbp of sequence)
will reduce sampling error. For an overview of genetic differentiation see Figure 2.
The 2La chromosomal inversion
Anopheles gambiae population KY was highly polymorphic
for the 2La/+ chromosomal inversion, allowing us to test
for differentiation between the two inversion states.
Dividing population KY into two groups on the basis of
on inversion status (2La homozygotes versus 2L+a
homozygotes, heterozygotes excluded) identified very
strong population structure associated with the inversion.

inversion-groups was KST = 0.25 (all six loci were signifi-

for serpins than for control loci (KST = 0.14 vs. KST = 0.25,
paired Wilcox test V = 113, p = 0.02). However, although
the trend was in the same direction in East and West
Africa, this effect was only significant in West Africa (V =

Inference of adaptive substitutions
Due to the lack of fixed differences between An. gambiae,
An. arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus, McDonald-Kreitman based approaches were not applied to these data (see
Discussion). However, it was possible to apply the
method of Welch [30] using An. gambiae/An. arabiensis,
and their divergence from An. melas and/or An. merus.
According to the likelihood ratio test, neither analysis
using An. melas provided any evidence supporting adaptive substitutions between the lineages (there was no significant improvement in model fit between fixing α = 0
and allowing α to take its maximum likelihood value; p >

αa and αb are estimates of the proportion of adaptive substitutions in each of the two classes of gene (control/serpin or non-immune/immune,
respectively), Par is the number of parameters in the model. Where the value of α is constrained by the model it is marked in square brackets.
Negative values arise from an 'excess' of non-synonymous polymorphism, and could represent sampling error, or mildly deleterious polymorphisms

between Plasmodium-related serpins and all other loci.
This suggests that approximately 8–53% of amino-acid
substitutions between An. arabiensis and An. merus were
adaptive, but this value did not differ significantly
between serpins and the control loci. Analysis of Akaike
weights gives a qualitatively identical result: in each species-pair no model is strongly preferred, but in the merusarabiensis comparison, α = 0 receives relatively little
weight. Full results of the McDonald-Kreitman analysis
are presented in table 2, and raw data are given in Additional file 4.

Discussion
Population history and speciation in Anopheles
The An. gambiae complex falls within the Pyretophorus
series of the subgenus Cellia, and comprises a closelyrelated group of approximately eight species (An. gambiae
s.s., An. arabiensis, Anopheles bwambae, An. quadriannulatus
A and B, An. merus, An. melas and Anopheles comorensis)
[55-57], plus at least one case of incipient speciation (M
and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. [37,58-60]).
Because lineages within the complex differ in their importance as Plasmodium vectors [e.g., [61]], in their ecological
preferences [62,63], and in their resistance to pesticides

[e.g. [63]], there is considerable value in understanding
both species relationships and how populations are structured. This may be of particular consequence if any
attempt is ever made to genetically modify wild Anopheles
populations to block or reduce Plasmodium transmission
[64,65]. However, in addition to having important implications for vector control, as discussed below, understanding phylogeny and population history are also essential to
the robust inference of selection.
Previous analyses suggest that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis are sister taxa, and the data presented here from five
of the eight species are in strong agreement, placing An.
gambiae and An. arabiensis as the most closely related species pair, with greater divergence to An. merus and An.
melas (Figure 3a; note that the tree is unrooted). However,
in common with previous studies [e.g. [33,66,67]], these
data suggest extensive shared polymorphism (Figure 3)
and very low differentiation between An. gambiae and An.
arabiensis (KST = 0.19). The inter-species differentiation
between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis is approximately
the same as inter-population differentiation between African and European D. melanogaster (KST = 0.16 to 0.24,
depending on population; pers. comm. P. R. Haddrill,
data from [68]), and is lower than inter-population differ-

entiation in the predominantly selfing nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans (KST = 0.38, pers. com. A. D. Cutter,
data from [69]). Thus, although An. gambiae and An. arabiensis are largely reproductively isolated and significantly
differentiated [70,71], these data confirm that either they
share extensive ancestral polymorphism, or that there is
considerable introgression between them [see also
[67,72,73]]. This is further supported by the very high correlation in neutral diversity across genes, between these
two species (Additional file 2).
Given a particular divergence time, effective population
size is the primary determinant of the amount of shared
ancestral polymorphism between taxa, because drift (and
therefore lineage-sorting) is faster in small populations
[e.g. [74]]. Thus, although it is likely that An. gambiae and
An. arabiensis share a more recent common ancestor that
either does with An. melas, the lower differentiation
between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis could also be
explained (at least in part) by differences in effective population size within the complex. Since πs is an estimator of
4Neμ, differences in neutral diversity imply that An. gambiae and An. arabiensis have larger effective population
sizes than An. merus, consistent both with their wider geographic range, and with potentially higher levels of shared
ancestral polymorphism (see above: πs~2.8%, 2.0%, and
0.9% for An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and An. melas, respectively). Diversity in An. gambiae and An. arabiensis is similar to that seen in African populations of Drosophila
simulans and D. melanogaster (πs = 3.2% and πs = 1.7%,
respectively) [e.g. [75]], and assuming the mutation rate
(μ) is similar between mosquitoes and Drosophila, this
also suggests a long-term effective population size for An.
gambiae that is about 70% larger than D. melanogaster
[76], i.e. well in excess of 1 million. This is broadly consistent with previous estimates from mitochondrial
sequence, but is much larger than estimates based on microsatellites and allozyme variants [reviewed in [77]].
Incipient speciation between the M and S molecular
forms of An. gambiae is a major focus of ongoing research
[37,58-60], culminating in the recently completed
sequencing of the M and S molecular-form genomes [78].
Although differentiation between the M and S form of An.
gambiae in West Africa is extremely low (KST = 0.02; Figure
2), it is consistently non-zero at some loci, even where the
lineages are sympatric (see e.g. [6]). This unambiguously
identifies M and S form An. gambiae as being (at least
partly) reproductively isolated [58], and it has been
argued that different M and S-form niches may be distinguishable [37]. Moreover, differentiation is variable
around the genome, being higher at so-called 'islands of
speciation', potentially associated with adaptive differences [58,59]. However, other studies have shown that in
some geographic regions microclimate is a better predic-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

tor of population divergence than is molecular form [79],
and it is clear that the S-form of An. gambiae is not a single
homogenous lineage [66,80]. Indeed, it is well-established that there is extensive genetic differentiation associated with the Great Rift Valley [80], and consistent with
this, the data presented here not only identify considerable differentiation between East and West Africa (KY Sform versus BK M-form, KST = 0.12), but also show that
West African M-form and S-form are less differentiated
from each other than either is from East African S-form
(Figure 2). This suggests either that the West African M
and S lineages share a more recent common ancestor, or
alternatively that they have experienced considerable
recent gene flow [[37], e.g. [80], but see also [81]]. For An.
arabiensis, differentiation across the width of the continent
is only KST = 0.08, which is very similar to that between
Eastern and Western S-form An. gambiae (KST = 0.07; Figure 2), and approximately twice that between D. melanogaster populations sampled across a similar geographic
range (Gabon vs. Kenya or Zimbabwe, KST = 0.04) [P. R.
Haddrill pers. comm., data from [68]].
Most populations showed a slight skew in the allele-frequency spectrum toward low-frequency variants (i.e.,
average Tajima's D was negative), consistent either with
population growth, or with weak selection against some
synonymous variants. In contrast, however, the data presented here also identify a strong skew toward intermediate frequency alleles in An. gambiae population KY (i.e., a
positive Tajima's D, 0.77 averaged across loci, 95% bootstrap interval 0.40–1.15). One potential explanation for
this is that population KY is admixed or contains cryptic
population structure, for example as would be the case if
two divergent lineages of S-form are coexisting there.
Alternatively, a positive Tajima's D could also result from
a recent decrease in effective population size.
The phylogenetic and phylogeographic complexity of the
An. gambiae species group means that inferences drawn
from single individuals should be treated with caution, as
the low differentiation between species and high diversity
within species means that any one individual is not necessarily typical or representative [e.g. [66]]. For example, the
recently sequenced M and S-form genomes [78] were both
obtained from mosquitoes sampled in Mali, but S-form
divergence between East and West Africa is considerably
greater than M-S divergence within West Africa (see Figure
2 above, and [66,80], cf. [81]). It is therefore not clear that
any conclusions regarding M - S genome divergence will
generalize to S-form individuals from the east African
coast. The same issue arises with inter-species comparisons. For example, the divergence between two randomly
sampled An. gambiae genomes is KS~3%, and that
between one randomly selected An. gambiae genome and
one randomly selected An. quadriannulatus genome is

Page 9 of 15

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:117

only KS~4% (above, and Figure 3). This means that a single inbred strain of An. quadriannulatus is only marginally
more informative about An. quadriannulatus than it is
about An. gambiae, and without more extensive sampling
it cannot reliably be used to identify genetic differences
between the species [cf. [61]]. These issues will be of paramount importance in analysing the recently approved
complete genomes of An. arabiensis, An. quadriannulatus
and An. merus [82].
Evidence for adaptive evolution in Anopheles serpins
There is considerable evidence from other taxa that serpins are an evolutionarily dynamic gene family, with high
turnover between lineages and occasional lineage-specific
expansions (e.g. [23], see [13] for a review). For example,
although most Anopheles and Aedes serpins have 1:1
orthologs, there are 29 serpins in D. melanogaster but only
18 in An. gambiae, and very few mosquito serpins have 1:1
orthologs in Drosophila [83]. Some serpins also show very
high rates of adaptive evolution, such as Drosophila
Spn28D [CG7219 in ref. [21]], and it has been suggested
that, in general, rapid turnover and strong selection in serpins may be associated with serpin immune function, and
could be driven by an evolutionary 'arms-race' [13]. In An.
gambiae, three serpins are known to have immune-related
function in response to Plasmodium infection (SRPN2,
SRPN6 and SRPN10 in [24,26,28]).

Strong selection can affect patterns of genetic diversity,
both between populations, and between chromosomal
inversions. In An. gambiae population KY, considerable
differentiation was identified between 2La and 2L+a
homozygotes around the SRPN1, 2 and 3 cluster (and
control loci 1, 2 and 3). For these loci KST = 0.25 between
inversion states, which is actually higher than the overall
differentiation between An. gambiae and An. arabiensis,
and twice as high as the differentiation between M-form
and S-form An. gambiae. No such differentiation was seen
for other loci on chromosome arm 2L, indicating that this
is strongly associated with the inversion. Although chromosomal inversions are in general expected to suppress
recombination, especially near breakpoints, this is
unlikely to lead to extreme or long-term differentiation
unless maintained by selection [e.g. [84,85]]. In particular, despite recombination being suppressed in heterozygous individuals, genetic exchange (including
recombination and gene-conversion) within the region of
the 2La/+ inversion is not zero [86], and this should allow
such differentiation to break down rapidly if it is not selectively maintained. The finding of elevated differentiation
around these loci agrees with previous analyses, which
found the SRPN1-3 cluster to be close to the region of
highest differentiation between 2La and 2L+a. [31]. While
this doesn't provide strong evidence that any of these serpins are being directly selected, it is interesting to note that

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

SRPN2 is required for successful infection of An. gambiae
by P. berghei [28], and that 2La inversion-status was identified with vector-competence in some early studies
[87,88]. Thus it is possible that genetic structuring in serpins 1–3, introduced and maintained by the 2La inversion, may affect variation in vector competence, even if
the underlying cause of 2La/+ differentiation is elsewhere.
In contrast, using a McDonald-Kreitman based approach
to detecting adaptive substitutions [29,30], no strong or
consistent evidence of selection could be detected, nor
could differences in the rate of adaptive evolution
between serpins and other genes (or between immune serpins and other genes; Table 2). Specifically, in three of the
four species pairings that were analysed, the rate of adaptive evolution could not be distinguished from zero
(Table 2). This may indicate that neither Anopheles
immune-related serpins, nor Anopheles serpins as a family,
are subject to selection for rapid change, and consequently that all selection acting on these genes is purifying. However, it may also be an artefactual result arising
either from limitations of the McDonald-Kreitman framework, or from issues specific to the gambiae species complex (see next section). In particular, the McDonaldKreitman approach assumes that non-synonymous substitutions can be divided into three classes: strongly
advantageous mutations that fix rapidly, strongly deleterious mutations that are rapidly lost, and effectively neutral
mutations that drift in frequency [50]. If there is also a
large class of weakly deleterious mutations that remain
polymorphic for an extended period, but are lost by selection in the long term, then this will reduce estimates of α
[50].
In agreement with this, a trend toward higher amino-acid
diversity was found in serpins, as compared to other
genes, in all three species (An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and
An. melas; Figure 1b). This could suggest that purifying
selection on serpins is weak or intermittent (as compared
to purifying selection on other genes), or that there is
selection favouring diversity in serpins, such as balancing
selection [89]. However, if the latter were the case, then
one might also expect to find an increase in diversity at
linked synonymous sites, and although slightly higher,
synonymous diversity in serpins did not differ significantly from other genes (Figure 1a), suggesting that they
neither experience long-term selection for increased polymorphism, nor undergo more frequent selective sweeps
[e.g. [8]]. Moreover, in no population or species did a serpin display the highest or lowest neutral genetic diversity,
and there was no clear pattern in the allele frequency spectrum (as measured by Tajima's D statistic) or inter-population differentiation (measured by KST) that supports the
notion of strong selection acting on Anopheles serpins.
These data therefore fail to identify any serpins as candi-

dates for recent strong selection within the gambiae complex.
Prospects and pitfalls in inferring adaptive evolution in
Anopheles
A null result in tests for selection may also result from low
power or model violations associated with the phylogenetic and population history in the An. gambiae complex.
Motivated by an interest in identifying targets of pathogen-mediated selection, several studies have now
attempted to identify adaptive evolution in immunerelated genes from the Anopheles gambiae species complex
[5,6,32-34,90-92]. However, in stark contrast to almost
identical studies in taxa such as Drosophila [for example
[10,11,21,93-95]], to date there is very little clear evidence
supporting adaptive evolution in the An. gambiae complex
[but see [90,92]].

One likely reason for the difference between Anopheles
and Drosophila studies is the dearth of suitable outgroups
for An. gambiae [e.g. [32]]. First, well-studied Anopheles
species outside of the gambiae complex appear to be too
distantly related to reliably infer the divergence between
them. For example, the An. stephensi SRPN6 cDNA
sequence [26] suggests that KS between with An. stephensi
and An. gambiae is ~1.33 (± 0.157) substitutions per site
when estimated by maximum likelihood [96], or 0.92 (±
0.117) by the method of Li [97]. Second, low divergence
within the complex means there is little power to infer the
substitution rate between them [6,32,33]. For example,
across all 8 serpins appearing in the extensive survey of
Cohuet et al. [6], there are only two fixed amino acid differences between An. arabiensis and An. gambiae. Similarly,
the present study found no fixed differences at all in the
same genes, probably because wider geographic sampling
provided greater power to distinguish between polymorphisms and fixed differences. The stochastic errors
involved here mean that estimates of substitution rate are
likely to be wildly variable, reducing the power to estimate
the fraction of adaptive substitutions using a McDonaldKreitman framework (Figure 4).
In principle, other species from within the gambiae complex might be informative outgroups for An. gambiae and
An. arabiensis: although divergence is small (1 to 5%; Figure 3a), this may be sufficient in other taxa, such as the
human-chimp comparison [e.g. [98]]. However, unlike
the human-chimp case, diversity in Anopheles is very high
compared to humans (πs~3% in An. gambiae, ~2% in An.
arabiensis, Figure 1, c.f. ~0.1% in humans, e.g. [99]), and
this leads to two potential problems. First, a large proportion of apparent substitutions will in reality be polymorphisms [30,51], and although this effect is small enough
to be negligible for pairs of species in which KS >> πS, it
becomes a concern when comparing An. gambiae to An.

The power to estimate α using An. gambiae and An. arabiensis
Figure 4
The power to estimate α using An. gambiae and An.
arabiensis. The relative log-likelihood of α (the proportion
of amino-acid substitutions that are adaptive) estimated using
the modified McDonald-Kreitman approach [30]. The grey
curve is calculated from all 102 genes for which both An. arabiensis and An. gambiae population samples were available in
the dataset of Cohuet et al. [6]. The black curve shows an
equivalent dataset of 102 genes from Drosophila melanogaster
and D. simulans, with genes selected to be the same average
length as those in the Cohuet dataset (D. J. Obbard, J. J.
Welch and F. M. Jiggins, unpublished data). Despite both pairs
of species having similar levels of diversity (πs from 1.6% to
2.9%), for the Anopheles dataset the bounds (2 units of log
Likelihood) stretch from -0.33 to 0.32 (and include zero)
while for Drosophila the bounds only stretch from 0.26 to
0.44, and the maximum-likelihood estimate of α is 35%. The
low precision in the second estimate reflects the very low
power available due to the low divergence in An. gambiae-An.
arabiensis comparisons
arabiensis, for which KS <πS (Figure 3). However, as here,
this effect can be accounted for using models which
include the sample size and diversity, and thereby infer
the 'true' number of substitutions [30,51]. Second, and
potentially more serious, is the opportunity for extensive
shared polymorphism. The McDonald-Kreitman framework uses information from current diversity (i.e. πs and
πa) to infer whether some proportion of historic substitutions (KA) cannot be explained by purely neutral processes. This model implicitly assumes a time period when
the two lineages were diverging from their common
ancestor, during which selection (that is to be detected)
was able to act. If there is extensive shared polymorphism
between the species, for example if gene trees are rarely
reciprocally monophyletic (as is the case with An. gambiae
and An. arabiensis; see Figure 3b–d and e.g. [33]), then it
is hard to see how the McDonald-Kreitman approach can
ever be usefully applied. In other words, unlike the
straight-forward cases where divergence is too high (the
branch is too long) or divergence is too low (the branch is

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:117

too short), for An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, in effect
there is no branch at all (Figure 3b–d).
Unfortunately, for similar reasons, there are also serious
concerns about the application of other selection-inference methods to the gambiae complex, such as the phylogenetic methods implemented in PAML [96] and HyPhy
[100]. These methods use multiple sequences related by a
gene (or species) tree to infer relative rates of synonymous
and non-synonymous substitution, allowing variable
rates at different sites or in different parts of the gene.
Most phylogenetic methods assume there is no recombination within loci [but see OmegaMap, [101]], and simulation suggests false positives can reach >50% when 2Ner
> 0.01 [102]. Because 2Ner (i.e: 2 × effective population
size × recombination rate per codon per generation) in
An. gambiae is likely to be of the order 0.01 – 0.1 or higher
– primarily due to the large effective population size –
such phylogenetic approaches cannot be applied reliably
to within-species Anopheles data.
Additionally, where the McDonald-Kreitman framework
assumes that between-species KA results from the joint
action of selection and drift, and within-species πa results
only from drift, the phylogenetic approaches (as they are
most commonly applied) assume either that all amino
acid variants have the same cause (i.e. KA and πa do not
provide independent information about selection and
drift) or that most differences are fixed between species,
(i.e. KA >> πa, such that πa is negligible). Thus the phylogenetic and McDonald-Kreitman approaches constitute very
different models that lend themselves to different datasets, and it is not clear that any single dataset can reasonably be analysed using both. Instead, to analyse a dataset
that includes substantial within-species sampling using a
phylogenetic approach, it may be more rational to fit a
model which allows the relative rates of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution to differ between withinand between-species branches [e.g. [103]]. However, in
the case of the gambiae complex, the low power associated
with the low inter-species divergence will then be encountered again.
If McDonald-Kreitman tests have relatively low power
within the gambiae complex, and phylogenetic methods
cannot easily be applied to within-species data, how can
selection be inferred from Anopheles population genetic
data? One possibility is to use approaches based solely on
within-population diversity to identify recent selective
sweeps or regions of elevated polymorphism, and this will
work for some loci [e.g. TEP1, [92]], though the possibility of introgression, and/or chromosomal inversions that
might affect the distribution of diversity, should then be
taken into account. Nevertheless, at present it seems the
best options for outgroup-based analyses are An. merus

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/117

and/or An. melas, and both the data presented here (Figure
3) and previous studies [e.g. [33,66]] suggest that their
divergence from the An. gambiae/An. arabiensis clade
should be sufficient in the case of genes evolving under
very strong selection. However, the recently approved
genome sequences from 13 more species of Anopheles
mosquitoes [82] may hold the solution, and particularly
the complete genome sequence of Anopheles sundaicus
(also subgenus Cellia, Pyretophorous series).
