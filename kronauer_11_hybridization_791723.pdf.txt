Hybridization in East African swarm-raiding army
ants
Daniel JC Kronauer1,2*†, Marcell K Peters3,4†, Caspar Schöning1,5 and Jacobus J Boomsma1

Abstract
Background: Hybridization can have complex effects on evolutionary dynamics in ants because of the
combination of haplodiploid sex-determination and eusociality. While hybrid non-reproductive workers have been
found in a range of species, examples of gene-flow via hybrid queens and males are rare. We studied hybridization
in East African army ants (Dorylus subgenus Anomma) using morphology, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and
nuclear microsatellites.
Results: While the mitochondrial phylogeny had a strong geographic signal, different species were not recovered
as monophyletic. At our main study site at Kakamega Forest, a mitochondrial haplotype was shared between a
“Dorylus molestus-like” and a “Dorylus wilverthi-like” form. This pattern is best explained by introgression following
hybridization between D. molestus and D. wilverthi. Microsatellite data from workers showed that the two
morphological forms correspond to two distinct genetic clusters, with a significant proportion of individuals being
classified as hybrids.
Conclusions: We conclude that hybridization and gene-flow between the two army ant species D. molestus and D.
wilverthi has occurred, and that mating between the two forms continues to regularly produce hybrid workers.
Hybridization is particularly surprising in army ants because workers have control over which males are allowed to
mate with a young virgin queen inside the colony.

Background
While botanists have long accepted that hybridization
plays an important role in plant evolution and regularly
leads to the emergence of new species [1], zoologists
have traditionally regarded hybridization and interspecific gene flow as rare exceptions [2]. However, the advent
of molecular genetic markers has changed this view during the last decade and it is now widely accepted that
hybridization between closely related species is also
common in animals [3-5]. Hybrids are often non-viable
or sterile due to negative epistasis and therefore tend to
be rather efficiently removed from the population by
natural selection [6]. However, in situations where this
is not the case, hybridization can lead to the collapse of
closely related species into a single panmictic population

[e.g. [7]], or to speciation events when some form of
reproductive isolation between parental species and
hybrids emerges [3-5].
In haplodiploid eusocial animals such as ants, the consequences of hybridization can be strikingly different
from those in other organisms. First, a diploid queen
that has mated with a heterospecific haploid male will
still produce purebred sons via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, so that hybrid males will only be produced in
the F2 generation. Second, potentially negative consequences of hybrid sterility can be mitigated or even
avoided when hybrid individuals mostly or exclusively
become non-reproductive workers [8,9]. Hybrid workers
do indeed regularly occur in a variety of ant species,
whereas hybrid queens and males are normally not
observed [10-12]. Hybridization in ants can therefore
lead to interesting evolutionary novelties, such as genetic
caste determination in interdependent lineages of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants, where purebred females
become queens and interlineage hybrids become

workers [13,14]. Another recent example is a population
of Formica wood ants with two clearly distinct male
genepools and hybrid queens [15]. This stable system is
maintained by strong transmission ratio distortion with
respect to the sex of the offspring. In both cases there is
no gene flow between the parental populations.
In the present study we investigated possible hybridization between different species of African swarm-raiding army ants, with particular focus on Kakamega
Forest, Kenya, which is one of the few sites where the
two closely related species, Dorylus (Anomma) molestus
and Dorylus (Anomma) wilverthi, occur in sympatry.
African swarm-raiding army ants (the “driver ants”) are
a prominent feature in afrotropical forests, where they
are prime invertebrate predators with colony sizes of
over ten million individuals. They form a well-supported
clade within the Dorylus subgenus Anomma [16]. Like
in other Hymenoptera, females (queens and workers)
are diploid, while males are haploid and are produced
by arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. Army ant queens,
unlike the queens of most other ants, are permanently
wingless, never go on a mating flight, and do not found
new colonies independently. Instead, large colonies produce a reproductive brood of several thousand winged
males and just a few virgin queens. Colony fission
occurs when the mother queen and a large fraction of
the worker-force emigrate from the nest and leave the
developing reproductive brood and the remaining workers behind. All but one of the virgin queens are eliminated in yet unknown ways. After the males have
eclosed, they disperse on the wing to mate with a young
queen in another colony. Virgin queens, on the other
hand, never leave their natal colony and mate with typically 10 - 30 foreign males that enter the colony from
outside [17]. Because colonies and their queens only disperse on foot, gene flow is highly male-biased [18,19].
An interesting consequence of this idiosyncratic
reproductive system is that males have to “run the
gauntlet of the workers” before they can mate, so that
workers have ample opportunities to choose the mates
of their queen-sister [20]. If her later breeding success
is affected by some of her many matings being heterospecific, the workers are under selection to influence
the outcome of this mating process because the result
affects their inclusive fitness. This implies that documentation of hybridization and introgression in army
ants provides direct working hypotheses about the fitness of mixed genotypes. Dorylus colonies are headed
by a single queen (monogynous), but due to the high
queen-mating frequency, most workers in a colony are
half-sisters, i.e. they have the same mother queen but
different fathers [17].
Previous work showed that the two species at Kakamega occupy clearly distinct ecological niches, with D.

wilverthi being essentially restricted to intact rainforest,
while D. molestus also occurs in savannah habitats and
open agricultural landscapes [21-23]. Our preliminary
morphological assessments suggested that both populations at Kakamega are aberrant when compared to allopatric populations of the same species, indicating that
hybridization and introgression may have taken place.
That hybridization between closely related army ants
may occur is also consistent with the observation that
heterospecific males are occasionally found in Dorylus
(Anomma) colonies [24], and with the description of the
“hybrid variety” D. sjoestedti var. sjoestedti-wilverthi [25].
Here we use a combination of morphological, mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data to show that hybridization and introgression have occurred historically
between different species of swarm-raiding army ants at
a large geographic scale in East Africa, and that ongoing
hybridization can be detected in Dorylus workers from
Kakamega. Our results allow novel inferences about the
evolutionary relevance of hybridization in social insects.

Results
(a) Morphological Analysis

The D. wilverthi-like workers from Kakamega (see Figure 1 for geographic positions of study sites) had the
posterior angles of the head prolonged into a raised
point, but not recurved outwards as in specimens from
more western populations (Figure 2a). More than half of
the examined D. molestus-like workers lacked the characteristic petiolar tubercles. Workers of both forms at
Kakamega had relatively shorter antennal scapes than
the workers from the respective “pure” allopatric populations (Figure 2b). The best common regression model
for the morphometric data combined was SL = 0.3039 *
HW + 0.6994 (SL = antennal scape length, HW = maximum head width). Differences between the relative residuals between all four groups were highly significant
(Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 280.7, p < 0.0001, Dunn’s
Multiple Comparison Test in all comparisons p < 0.01).
(b) Phylogeographic Analysis

The phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial haplotypes
resolved several well supported clades (Figures 3 and 4,
Table 1). Most strikingly, neither D. molestus nor D. wilverthi were resolved as monophyletic. Instead, the mitochondrial phylogeny reflects geographical patterns rather
than species affiliations: all samples from the coastal
area of Kenya and Tanzania south of the Lower Tana
River form a well-supported clade, extending inland to
the southern slope of Mt. Kenya (clade 3 in Figures 3
and 4). The same is true for samples from Ethiopia and
two of the more northern samples from Kenya and
Uganda (clade 4). Samples north of and around Lake
Victoria form another big clade (clade 2), which includes

haplotypes from all three species that occur in the area.
All common haplotypes from Kakamega form a monophyletic group (clade 1), which is nested within the larger Lake Victoria group (clade 2).
(c) Population Structure and Divergence

We assessed the population structure and divergence
among three populations of D. molestus (Tana River,
Mt. Kenya, Kakamega Forest) and one D. wilverthi
population (Kakamega Forest). None of the pair-wise
tests for genotypic disequilibrium between microsatellite
markers was significant (all p > 0.05). Pair-wise estimates of genetic differentiation between four analysed
populations at nuclear microsatellites (FST) are given in
Table 2. Estimates of FST between the D. wilverthi-like
and the D. molestus populations were slightly but consistently higher than estimates between the different D.
molestus populations (Table 2; one-tailed t-test: t =
-2.33, df = 4, p = 0.04).

Page 3 of 13

The mitochondrial haplotype diversity was much
lower in the D. wilverthi-like population (Na = 2; Rs =
1.55; N = 34) than in the D. molestus populations (Kakamega: Na = 7; Rs = 6.24; N = 42; Mt. Kenya: Na = 8; Rs
= 6.94; N = 29; Tana River: Na = 5; Rs = 5.00; N = 11).
Interestingly, the D. wilverthi-like population was close
to fixation (allele frequency = 0.97) for a haplotype that
was also common in the sympatric D. molestus-like
population at Kakamega (allele frequency = 0.19) and
was closely related to the other local D. molestus haplotypes (Figures 3 and 4). At the same time this is the
only haplotype that is shared between any of the four
populations. The second rare haplotype found in D. wilverthi from Kakamega is closely related to the common
haplotype and differs only by a single base-pair (Figure
4).
Replicate runs in STRUCTURE were highly consistent
in every analysis. The highest likelihood scores were
associated with a model with four subdivisions (k = 4,
mean ln L over five replicate runs = -3185.36; 0.23 SD;
for comparison: k = 2, -3409.86; 0.11 SD; k = 3,
-3245.90; 0.28 SD; all k > 4 had lower average likelihoods than k = 4), although a model with five subdivisions had very similar likelihood scores (k = 5, -3185.56;
0.81 SD). The four clusters corresponded well to the
four populations, although a significant proportion of
individuals had reasonably high likelihoods of ancestry
in a population other than their source population (Figure 5; Table 2). By far the strongest uncertainty over
individual assignments was found between the D. wilverthi-like and D. molestus-like populations at Kakamega
Forest, as well as between the Mt. Kenya and Tana River
populations of D. molestus. When set to divide the samples in two groups (k = 2), STRUCTURE consistently
recovered one cluster consisting of the two Kakamega
populations and another cluster consisting of D. molestus samples from Tana River and Mt. Kenya, rather
than combining the three D. molestus populations. At k
= 3, STRUCTURE split the two Kakamega populations,
and at k = 5 the Tana River + Mt. Kenya samples generally formed three clusters, while the two Kakamega clusters were retained (results not shown).
To quantify the proportion of hybrid workers at Kakamega, we arbitrarily classified individuals with an
inferred proportion of ancestry < 0.9 in the correct
source population as hybrids. Each hybrid individual
was then determined to be “shared” between its source
population and the population in which it had the highest proportion of ancestry among the non-source populations. The proportions of individuals that are “shared”
between each pair of populations are given in Table 2.
According to this estimate, 18.2% of the genotyped
workers from Kakamega Forest were hybrids. If we
lower the cut-off value for the inferred proportion of

Figure 4 Parsimony network of all East African haplotypes of
D. molestus, D. wilverthi and D. terrificus. A connecting line
between haplotypes represents one mutation and small open
circles represent missing (inferred) haplotypes. Green haploytypes
are from D. molestus, blue haplotypes from D. wilverthi, and grey
haplotypes from D. terrificus. Size of haplotype disks is proportional
to their frequencies. Boxes with numbers indicate the same
haplotype clusters as shown in Figure 3.

The morphological and morphometric data show that
two forms of swarm-raiding army ants can be distinguished at Kakamega Forest. These two forms strongly
resemble D. molestus and D. wilverthi from allopatric
populations, but are also significantly different from
“pure” D. molestus and D. wilverthi with intermediate
phenotypes for several key characters (Figure 2). This
suggests that both forms have arisen from hybridization
between D. molestus and D. wilverthi at Kakamega Forest. At the same time, gene-flow has not been sufficient
to completely collapse the two species into a single
homogeneous hybrid population.
(b) Mitochondrial phylogeny and introgression

While mitochondrial haplotypes are clearly structured
according to geographic origin (Figures 3 and 4), different Dorylus (Anomma) species are not generally recovered as monophyletic. Below we argue that this finding
is best explained by the combined effects of unrecognized cryptic diversity within D. molestus and a complex
history of mitochondrial introgression in the Lake Victoria region. D. molestus haplotypes tend to cluster into
several well supported shallow clades, which are connected to other such clades by deeper branches (Figure
3). Furthermore, the Central African D. sjoestedti samples cluster with D. molestus samples from coastal
Kenya and Tanzania, a finding that cannot be explained
by introgression due to the large geographic distances
and the fact that more western samples of D. molestus
do not have haplotypes similar to those of D. sjoestedti.
Incomplete lineage sorting seems similarly unlikely as
an explanation (see below), so that this overall pattern is
suggestive of unrecognized cryptic diversity within D.
molestus.
The fact that identical or very similar haplotypes are
shared between different species in spatially close populations around Lake Victoria, on the other hand, points
towards a complex history of mitochondrial introgression in this narrower geographic area. The most striking
example is found at Kakamega Forest, where the D. wilverthi-like form is close to fixation for a haplotype that
is also frequent in the D. molestus-like form. This haplotype is nested within the clade of Kakamega D. molestus
haplotypes (clade 1 in Figure 3). The clade of mitochondrial haplotypes from Kakamega Forest is in turn nested

within a larger clade of haplotypes from the Lake Victoria region (clade 2 in Figure 3), which contains additional haplotypes from D. molestus, D. terrificus, and D.
wilverthi. This pattern indicates a complex history of
repeated mitochondrial introgression between different
pairs of species.
The combination of two main factors makes it difficult
to determine the original source species of the Lake Victoria haplotypes: 1. We presently lack haplotype information for populations of D. wilverthi and D. terrificus
that have clearly not undergone mitochondrial introgression, i.e. we are missing “true” D. wilverthi and D.
terrificus haplotypes in our analysis. 2. Mitochondrial
DNA undergoes frequent selective sweeps, and recurrent
sweeps are likely to mask previous introgression events
[26,27].
During Pleistocene and Holocene glacial cycles
[28,29], the Lake Victoria region has seen recurrent
expansions and retractions of forest and savannah habitat [30-32], so it is safe to assume that the distributional
ranges of rainforest specialists like D. wilverthi and

savannah/forest generalists like D. molestus have changed accordingly. The two species probably broadly overlapped during glacial periods of maximum forest
expansion, when Kakamega Forest was connected to
Ugandan rainforests [30], while D. wilverthi has been
restricted to forest islands during interglacial periods as
is the case at present. Given this complex recent biogeographic history, it will also be challenging to associate
the observed cases of introgressive hybridization with
discrete historic events.
It is interesting to note that only a single mitochondrial haplotype is shared between the two forms at
Kakamega, while essentially all other haplotypes are
restricted to the D. molestus-like form. One possible
explanation is that mitochondrial gene-flow at Kakamega goes back to a single or very few events, which by
chance involved only that particular haplotype. Alternatively, the pattern could be explained by selection. For
example, all other D. molestus-like haplotypes, or potential cytoplasmic factors coupled to those haplotypes (like
Wolbachia infections [33]), might have epistatic incompatibilities with parts of the D. wilverthi nuclear genome. That the reduced mitochondrial diversity in the D.
wilverthi-like form at Kakamega is simply due to a
recent genetic bottleneck seems unlikely because diversity at nuclear microsatellite loci is not reduced compared to other populations (Table 3).
Another noteworthy case of apparent mitochondrial
introgression was found in the population from Tana
River, where haplotypes from both sides of the river
tend to cluster in clearly distinct clades (Figures 3 and
4) although, according to microsatellite data (see below),
all samples belong to a single population. This suggests
that at least one side of the river has captured haplotypes from a more distantly related D. molestus clade.
This strong genetic structure at the maternally inherited
mitochondrial locus, and a lack thereof at biparentally

inherited nuclear loci, stems from the fact that the permanently wingless army ant queens cannot cross water
barriers, while the winged males readily do so [18].
Alternative explanations for a lack of monophyly
between closely related species usually involve the retention of ancestral polymorphisms or incomplete lineage
sorting. However, these mechanisms are less likely to
apply to mtDNA as compared to nuclear DNA because
ancestral polymorphisms will be lost more quickly due
to genetic drift given the smaller effective population
size of mtDNA and because mtDNA in insects evolves
significantly faster than nuclear DNA (e.g. [34]). On the
other hand, mtDNA seems to be particularly prone to
introgression, at least in species where males are the
heterogametic or haploid sex (e.g. [34-37]). One reason
for this is that in such species males tend to suffer more
from hybridization than females (Haldane’s rule; [38]),
so that gene-flow will be more restricted at nuclear loci
relative to maternally inherited mitochondrial loci.
Furthermore, if incomplete lineage sorting occurs at
random it should not produce an obvious correlation
with geographic distribution (e.g. [39]), as we observed
in East African Dorylus (Anomma) species. Under
incomplete lineage sorting, the minimum divergence
time between sequences is given by the time elapsed
since speciation [40]. In the absence of gene flow, mutations should therefore accumulate quickly in cytochrome
oxidase II haplotypes, which have high mutation rates of
ca. 1.5% per million years in insects (e.g. [41]). Given
the strong geographic signal in our mtDNA phylogeny
(Figures 3 and 4), the general lack of overlapping haplotypes between neighbouring conspecific populations,
and the fact that sympatric species at Kakamega share
identical haplotypes for fast evolving mitochondrial
genes, we conclude that introgressive hybridization
between army ant species is clearly the best explanation
for the observed haplotype distribution in the Lake Victoria area.
(c) Differentiation and hybridization at nuclear DNA

The two morphological forms at Kakamega Forest can
be clearly distinguished based on the nuclear microsatellite loci. This again shows that species boundaries have
not become completely blurred, which would be
expected if gene flow had been significant over extended
periods of time. On the other hand, despite genetic differentiation among species being consistently higher
than between conspecific populations (Table 2), a large
proportion of workers at Kakamega could not be
unequivocally assigned to one of the two forms by either
STRUCTURE or GENECLASS2 (Figure 5). At the same
time, pair-wise assignments between populations were
far less problematic, even in conspecific comparisons.
The only exception was the Tana River/Mt. Kenya

Page 9 of 13

comparison, which showed very weak differentiation
making assignments difficult. The reason for this genetic
similarity may well be that these two populations were
connected via contiguous gallery forests along the Tana
River until the recent past. Overall, this implies that a
considerable proportion of workers at Kakamega Forest
are hybrids between D. molestus and D. wilverthi.

Conclusions
This study provides conclusive evidence that introgressive hybridization has occurred between different Dorylus (Anomma) species. This is one of the few cases of
documented gene flow between species of eusocial
Hymentoptera ([11]; but see [42,43] for other recent
examples) and shows that reproductive isolation
between species of East African swarm-raiding army
ants is incomplete. The frequent occurrence of hybrid
workers at Kakamega means that the two local forms
still mate regularly today. However, it is important to
keep in mind that hybrid workers do not necessarily
translate into gene flow, because social insect workers
normally do not reproduce. This also applies to Dorylus
(Anomma) [19,44]. The general notion that hybrid
workers are common between several pairs of closely
related ant species, while hybrid queens and males are
extremely uncommon [11], might explain why the two
forms at Kakamega have retained their distinct morphology and ecological niche space, instead of having
collapsed into a single homogeneous hybrid population.
Hybridization in army ants is particularly surprising
because, unlike in most social insects where mating
occurs outside the nest, workers have control over
which males obtain access to a virgin queen. Therefore,
if hybridization would imply reduced colony fitness,
workers should be under strong selection to recognize
heterospecific males and prevent them from mating.
This suggests that hybridization in army ants entails little or no fitness costs or might even be adaptive under
certain circumstances. Future work will have to investigate the stability of the hybrid zone at Kakamega over
time, and the effects of hybridization on the actual genotypes of Dorylus queens and males, to clarify the precise pattern of hybridization and the amount of ongoing
gene-flow between the two sympatric forms.
Materials and methods
(a) Sampling and morphological analysis

To study patterns of mitochondrial differentiation
between species and populations of East African Dorylus
(Anomma) army ants, we collected 151 colony samples
(one individual per colony) for mitochondrial DNA
sequencing from 24 localities, representing four morphologically distinguishable species, D. molestus, Dorylus
sjoestedti, Dorylus terrificus, and D. wilverthi (Figure 1;

Kronauer et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:20
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/20

Table 1). A single West African sample of Dorylus nigricans was also included. A haplotype of the West African
species Dorylus emeryi served as outgroup, as this species belongs to the sister clade of the swarm-hunting
Anomma “driver ants” [16].
Samples for microsatellite genotyping (one worker per
colony) were collected from four populations at three
different sites in Kenya: Kakamega Forest (where D.
molestus-like and D. wilverthi-like forms are sympatric;
N = 55 each), the eastern slope of Mt. Kenya (D. molestus; N = 50), and Lower Tana River (D. molestus; N =
42). Subsets of these samples were also sequenced for
mitochondrial DNA (see Table 1). The Mt. Kenya population is geographically situated halfway in between the
two other populations (Figure 1). All samples were collected and stored in ethanol.
We identified samples morphologically using the diagnostic criteria given in the original species descriptions
and in [45]. Furthermore, samples were directly compared with type specimens. D. molestus, D. terrificus,
and D. sjoestedti, which currently have the status of subspecies of D. nigricans, were treated as species according
to [45,46], and the results of an ongoing taxonomic revision of the Dorylus (Anomma) swarm-raiding army ants
(C. Schöning et al. unpublished). Importantly, D. wilverthi and D. molestus workers are easily distinguished:
D. wilverthi workers have the posterior angles of the
head uniquely prolonged into a raised, slightly outwardly
recurved point ("horns"; Figure 2a), while D. molestus
workers have posteroventral extensions ("tubercles”) on
the petiole (Figure 2a) and significantly shorter appendages than D. wilverthi [47,48]. To quantify morphological variation we measured antennal scape length (SL) in
relation to maximum head width (HW) for large workers (HW > 1.5 mm) in four groups: D. molestus-like
individuals from Kakamega (N = 54 workers from 10
colonies), D. wilverthi-like individuals from Kakamega
(N = 45 workers from nine colonies), “pure” allopatric
D. molestus (N = 157 workers from 31 colonies belonging to 20 populations across the species’ range), and
“pure” allopatric D. wilverthi (N = 85 workers from 16
colonies belonging to 10 populations across the species’
range). Measurements were taken with a MS5 Leica
stereomicroscope fitted with an ocular micrometer. Data
were analysed following Schöning et al. [47].
(b) DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, and
microsatellite genotyping

DNA for sequencing was extracted from 1-2 worker legs
using standard QIAGEN® (DNeasy®) and MACHEREYNAGEL (Nucleo Spin ® Tissue) kits. A mitochondrial
fragment of the cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene was
amplified and sequenced using primers tRNALeu [16]
and Barbara [49] as has been described earlier [16].

Page 10 of 13

Sequencing reactions were either performed in house or
purified PCR products were sent to a commercial
sequencing facility (Macrogen, Korea). The final alignment used in this study consisted of 548 bp of COII
sequence. GenBank accession numbers and details for
sequenced samples are given in Table 1.
DNA for microsatellite genotyping was extracted by
boiling 1-2 worker legs in 100 μl of 5% Chelex 100 (BioRad). A total of 202 individuals were genotyped at five
microsatellite loci (DmoB, DmoC, DmoD, DmoG,
DmoO) as has been described previously [50].
(c) Phylogeographic Analyses

Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences were
conducted in a Bayesian framework using the program
MrBayes 3.1.2 [51,52], and in a maximum likelihood framework using the program GARLI 0.96 [53]. We implemented a general time reversible model with gammadistributed rate heterogeneity (GTR+G), which was
selected as the most appropriate model for our data by
both hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Tests and the Akaike
Information Criterion in MrModeltest 2.3 [54].
To assure convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
runs in MrBayes we repeated the analysis from two
independent starting trees. One cold and three heated
chains were run in parallel for 20*106 generations and
trees were sampled every 100 generations. Average standard deviations of split frequencies were consistently <
0.01 after 13*106 generations, indicating that the independent runs had converged. Accordingly, the first
130,000 trees from each run were discarded as burn-in.
Based on this sample of 140,002 trees from both runs
combined, all potential scale reduction factors for model
parameters were < 1.02, indicating effective sampling
from the posterior probability distribution. A consensus
phylogram with posterior probabilities based on both
runs was calculated in MrBayes.
We initially performed three independent runs in
GARLI setting the number of generations after which
the run is terminated if no new significantly better scoring topology has been found to 30,000, and otherwise
using default parameter settings. We then performed a
run with 1,000 bootstrap replicates setting the above
parameter at 10,000.
A mitochondrial haplotype network for all East African haplotypes of D. molestus, D. wilverthi and D. terrificus was constructed using a statistical parsimony
approach [55] implemented in TCS version 1.21 [56].
The connection limit in the TCS program was set at
unlimited.

for sample size (Rs), and the inbreeding coefficient FIS
were estimated for each population using the program
FSTAT 2.9.3.2 [57]. FIS was tested for significant deviation from zero using 400 randomisations to assess
Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The same program was
used to test for genotypic disequilibrium between all
pairs of microsatellite loci within each population
(Table 3). Furthermore, we used FSTAT to calculate
pair-wise FST as an estimate of genetic differentiation at
microsatellite loci between populations and species.
FSTAT was also used to calculate Na and Rs for mitochondrial haplotypes.
We used two different model-based Bayesian methods
to study hybridization between D. molestus and D. wilverthi at Kakamega. First, the clustering method of the
program STRUCTURE 2.2 [58] was used to infer population structure at microsatellite loci without prior information on species assignments based on sample locality and
morphology. The data from all four populations were
combined in this analysis. To assure convergence and consistency of results, we conducted five replicate runs with
different random seeds for each k, the number of subdivisions, ranging from one to 10, under an admixture model
with correlated allele frequencies [59]. Markov chains
were run for 106 generations and the first 105 generations
were discarded as burn-in. Estimates of hybrid frequencies
were based on individual probabilities of having ancestry
in populations other than the source population. The
comparisons between conspecific populations were used
as a control to assure that the analyses had sufficient
power in assigning individuals to different clusters given
the observed levels of genetic differentiation between
populations. More recent and potentially ongoing geneflow between conspecific populations should generally
result in more ambiguous assignments of individuals to
populations as compared to genetically isolated heterospecific populations, irrespective of whether these occur in
sympatry or not. We used the program DISTRUCT 1.1
[60] to graphically display STRUCTURE results (Figure 4).

Second, we used the assignment methods in the program GENECLASS2 [61] to estimate the likelihood of
origin for each individual in each potential source population. All four populations were analyzed in a single
dataset. To calculate likelihoods, we chose a Bayesian
criterion with a Dirichlet prior distribution for allele frequencies [62] using the resampling method of Paetkau
et al. [63]. The number of simulated individuals for
probability computation was set at 10,000.
