Abstract
Background: The human psoriasin (S100A7) gene has been implicated in inflammation and tumor
progression. Implementation of a mouse model would facilitate further investigation of its function,
however little is known of the murine psoriasin gene. In this study we have cloned the cDNA and
characterized the expression of the potential murine ortholog of human S100A7/psoriasin in skin
inflammation and mammary tumorigenesis.
Methods: On the basis of chromosomal location, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence similarity,
conservation of a putative Jab1-binding motif, and similarities of the patterns of mouse S100A7/psoriasin
gene expression (measured by RT-PCR and in-situ hybridization) with those of human S100A7/psoriasin,
we propose that mouse S100A7/psoriasin is the murine ortholog of human psoriasin/S100A7.
Results: Although mouse S100A7/psoriasin is poorly conserved relative to other S100 family members,
its pattern of expression parallels that of the human psoriasin gene. In murine skin S100A7/psoriasin was
significantly upregulated in relation to inflammation. In murine mammary gland expression is also
upregulated in mammary tumors, where it is localized to areas of squamous differentiation. This mirrors
the context of expression in human tumor types where both squamous and glandular differentiation occur,
including cervical and lung carcinomas. Additionally, mouse S100A7/psoriasin possesses a putative Jab1
binding motif that mediates many downstream functions of the human S100A7 gene.
Conclusion: These observations and results support the hypothesis that the mouse S100A7 gene is
structurally and functionally similar to human S100A7 and may offer a relevant model system for studying
its normal biological function and putative role in tumor progression.

Background
Human S100A7 or psoriasin was first identified as an
over-expressed secreted protein in psoriatic skin[1]. More
recently its expression in both pre-invasive (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) and invasive human breast cancer was
demonstrated [2]. Although highly expressed in DCIS and
generally down-regulated in invasive breast cancer, the
expression of psoriasin/S100A7 in both in-situ and invasive breast cancer is correlated with markers of poor prognosis [3,4] and in invasive carcinoma also with poor
clinical outcome [5]. Support for psoriasin/S100A7 having a functional role in this aggressive phenotype is shown
by the observation of increased growth and tumorigenesis
when breast cancer cells over-expressing psoriasin/
S100A7 are grown as xenografts in nude mice [6]. This
activity may in part be mediated by the ability of psoriasin/S100A7 to interact with c-Jun activation domainbinding protein 1 (Jab1) [6] and enhance pro-survival
pathways [7] and protect against anoikis in human breast
and head and neck squamous cancer cells [8]. However,
further investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological function of psoriasin/S100A7 can only be effectively undertaken using genetic manipulation of an
animal model. To undertake such studies we need to characterize and clone the mouse psoriasin gene. Interestingly,
during the preparation of this manuscript Marenholz etal.,
[9] have argued that the possible ancestral homolog of the
human S100A7 paralogs [10] has been identified in the
mouse on the basis of genome sequence analysis and gene
orientation, but has not been characterized fully as yet.
The following study provides evidence of the cloning of a
cDNA of the putative mouse ortholog of human psoriasin/S100A7, investigates its expression under conditions
of mouse mammary tumorigenesis and skin inflammation, and confirms that the factors involved in its regulation are comparable to those involved in regulation of the
human counterpart.

4, 8, 16, and 24 hours. At each time-point, the mice were
sacrificed. The tail-skins were harvested and paired specimens of normal and inflamed skin tissue were fixed in
3.7% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline
for 16–18 hours, followed by paraffin embedding.
Sections from the above blocks were used for preparation
of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections for light
microscopic examination, in situ hybridization (ISH), and
immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Human tumor tissues were obtained from the Department of Pathology, University of Manitoba. All cases were
coded and therefore anonymous and prior approval was
obtained from the University of Manitoba Research Ethics
Board and the Pathology Access to Tissue Committee. Different cervical tumor pathologies (total n = 39 cases)
including in-situ adenocarcinoma (n = 10) and squamous
cell carcinoma (n = 9), as well as invasive adenocarcinoma
(n = 10) and squamous carcinoma (n = 10) were selected
for one cohort study. In addition, different invasive lung
tumor types (total n = 78 cases) including mesothelioma
(n = 10), small cell carcinoma (n = 15), adenocarcinoma
(n = 28), and squamous carcinoma (n = 25) were selected
to form another study cohort. Squamous differentiation
within both murine and human tumors was determined
by standard morphological criteria including cytoplasmic
keratinization and cellular stratification relative to keratin
pearls.

Tissues
Murine studies were conducted in accordance with the
principles and procedures recommended and approved
by the University of Manitoba Animal Care Review Board.
Mammary tumors in CD1 mice were generated chemically
using 7, 12-dimethylbenz anthracine (DMBA) as previously described [11]. Freshly dissected mouse tissues were
either stored frozen at -70°C, or processed to generate formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.

In-situ hybridization
Paraffin embedded 5 µm tissue sections were analyzed by
in-situ hybridization according to a previously described
protocol [13]. The plasmid pCR4-TOPO-mPsor-ORF,
consisted of pCR4-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen Canada
Inc, Burlington, ON) containing a 344 base pair insert of
the mouse psoriasin cDNA, also known as mouse
S100A15 (from nucleotide 94 to 437 as numbered in
AY465109, and from 1 to 344 as numbered in
AY582964). One microgram of linearized template DNA
was used to generate 35S-UTP-labeled sense and antisense
cRNA probes using the Riboprobe System (Promega,
Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sense probes were used as controls. In-situ hybridization and washing conditions were as previously
described[2]. Sections were developed using Kodak NTB2 photographic emulsion and counter-stained with Lee's
stain after 2–6 weeks.

Acute dermatitis in C57/B6 mice was induced by the topical application of 20% croton oil (dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide) to a 1 cm length mid-tail portion [12]. The tail
skins were stimulated continuously with croton oil every
4 hours for 24 hours. Mice were divided into five timegroups (each containing 3 mice) that were designated 0,

Levels of mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA expression were
assessed by microscopic examination at low power magnification and with reference to the negative sense control.
This was done by scoring the estimated average signal
intensity (on a scale of 0 to 3), where 0 is no expression
and 3 is a high proportion of strong focal expression.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on serial 5
µm sections from a representative, formalin fixed paraffin
embedded tissue block from each tumor. For human
tumor blocks, psoriasin/S100A7 IHC was performed
essentially as described [5] and human psoriasin/S100A7
was detected using a previsouly characterized rabbit polyclonal antibody [3,5]. For murine tumors estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) was detected using an affinity purified
rabbit polyclonal antibody, MC-20, raised against a C-terminal peptide of mouse ERα (#sc-542, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, CA). Antibodies were applied using an
automated tissue immunostainer (Discovery module,
Ventana Medical System), 3, 3-diaminobenzidine IHC kit
and bulk reagents were supplied by the manufacturer.
Briefly, the Discovery staining protocol was set to "Standard Cell Conditioning", followed by 60 minutes incubation at 42°C with primary antibody and 30 minutes
incubation at 42°C with secondary antibody (goat antirabbit-IgG-HRP, Jackson Immuno Research Labs Inc). Primary antibody concentrations initially applied to the Ventana instrument were 1:200 for ERα and 1:200 for the
secondary antibody translating into final dilutions of
1:600 after 1:3 dilution with buffer dispensed onto the
slide with the primary antibody. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Levels of psoriasin/S100A7 and ERα expression were
scored semi-quantitatively in tissue sections, under the
light microscope. Scores were obtained by estimating
average signal intensity (scale of 0 to 3) and the proportion of epithelial cells showing a positive signal (0–
100%). The intensity and proportion scores were then
multiplied to give an overall IHC-score.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription
Total mouse RNA was extracted using Trizol™ reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions,
and the integrity of the RNA was confirmed by denaturing
gel electrophoresis as previously described [14]. RNAs
from the various frozen tissues were reverse transcribed.
One µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 30 µl composed of 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3), 75
mM KC1, 3 mM MgC12, 0.5 µM random hexamers (Invitrogen) 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.01 mM DTT in the presence of
300 units of MMLV-RT (Invitrogen), and 4 units RNase
inhibitor at 37°C for 1 hour, followed by 5 minutes at
95°C and kept at -20°C until used.
PCR conditions
The primer pairs used were as follows;
Mouse S100A7/psoriasin C-terminus
5'-ATG CCA GAC ACA CCA GTG GAG-3' (sense; nucleotides 111–131 in GenBank acc. AY465109) and 5'-GGT

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/17

AGT CCT TCA CCA GCT TGC-3' (antisense; nucleotides
358–378).
Mouse S100A7/psoriasin open reading frame
5'-TGA AGG GTC CAT CAG TCA-3' (sense; nucleotides
94–111 in GenBank acc. AY465109) and 5'-CTA GTA
GAG GCT GTG CT-3' (antisense; nucleotides 421–437).
Mouse β-actin
Primers were designed according to the mRNA sequence
(GenBank acc. NM_007393): 5'-TCT ACG AGG GCT ATG
CTC TCC-3' (sense; nucleotides 574–594) and 5'-GGA
TGC CAC AGG ATT CCA TAC-3' (antisense; nucleotides
883–903). According to the chromosome 5 genomic contig sequence (GenBank acc. NT_039324), these primers
span an 87-bp intron with the antisense primer binding
across the intron-exon boundary.

PCR reactions were performed essentially as previously
described [3]. To amplify cDNA corresponding to mouse
S100A7/psoriasin, an initial 2 minutes at 94°C was followed by 36 cycles (30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at
56°C, 30 seconds at 72°C). Twenty six cycles were used to
amplify β-actin cDNA (30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at
58°C, 30 seconds at 72°C). PCR products were separated
on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.1
µg/ml) as previously described [13]. Identity of the 344 bp
product corresponding to mouse S100A7/psoriasin and
the 330 bp product corresponding to β-actin were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing as described previously [13].
Semi-quantitative PCR analyses were performed using
three independent PCRs for each sample for both mouse
S100A7/psoriasin and β-actin. Signals visualized with UV
irradiation on a GelDoc2000/ChemiDoc System (BioRad), were quantified by densitometry using the Quantity
One software (version 4.2; Bio-Rad). Mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression was standardized to β-actin expression
assessed from the same cDNA in separate PCR reactions
and run in parallel on separate gels. The standardized
mean of each triplicate PCR was then expressed relative to
the levels in a "moderately expressing" sample selected for
each batch of cDNAs to be analyzed.
Phylogenetic analysis
Amino acid sequences of S100 family genes were aligned
using Clustal X [15]. This alignment was used to construct
a phylogenetic tree based on a Poisson corrected neighbour-joining distance method [16] available in the computer software package MEGA v3.0 [17]. The reliability of
the phylogeny's interior branches was tested by a bootstrap test with 1000 replications [18]. The human
sequences used, were GenBank Accession numbers:

Results
Identification and cloning of mouse S100A7/psoriasin
cDNA
A BLASTP search of mouse sequence databases was performed using the human psoriasin (S100A7) amino acid
sequence and identified a mouse sequence highly similar
to human S100A7, which had been previously predicted
by automated computational analysis (GenBank acc.
XM_143311, later replaced by AY465109). Using this predicted sequence in a BLASTN search, a mouse skin
expressed sequence tag (EST) (GenBank acc. AA792680)
containing a highly similar sequence was identified. A
pair of mouse "psoriasin"-specific PCR primers was
designed that would only amplify a sequence of mouse
psoriasin contained within the EST. According to the
recently posted genomic sequence (GenBank acc.
AY465110) these primers span a 1992-bp intron, thus the
potential amplification of contaminating genomic DNA is
minimized (Figure 1). An additional set of mouse psoriasin primers ("psoriasin-ORF") was later designed to
amplify the entire predicted open reading frame (Figure
1). These primers also span the 1992-bp intron. Both sets
of putative mouse psoriasin primers were used for RT-PCR
and semi-quantitatively measure the potential expression
of the putative mouse psoriasin in mouse skin, mammary
gland and mouse mammary tumors. These tissues were
chosen because the human psoriasin/S100A7 was
described as differentially expressed in skin and breast.
The results, using primers that amplified the entire predicted ORF of the putative mouse psoriasin, are shown in
Figure 2, with β-actin as a control in parallel. A 344 bp
PCR product was amplified from cDNA derived from normal mouse skin and mammary gland using mouse psoriasin primers (see above for description). Based on our PCR
results, mouse psoriasin mRNA is expressed in skin as well
as in mammary gland where it is more highly expressed in
mammary tumors than in normal mammary gland (Figure 2a). The psoriasin RT-PCR product and the 330 bp
product generated using the mouse β-actin primers were
both cloned and sequenced to confirm their identities.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/17

The nucleotide sequence of the putative mouse psoriasin
RT-PCR product (GenBank acc. AY582964) was 100%
identical to the coding sequence of the putative mRNA in
the GenBank sequence database (GenBank acc.
XM_143311). Start/stop codons, PCR primer binding
sites, and intron/exon boundaries are indicated in Figure
1. However, during the course of this study the predicted
mRNA sequence of GenBank acc. XM_143311, named as
'similar to the S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (psoriasin)' was removed and apparently replaced by another
entry GenBank acc. XM_356221 for a predicted mRNA
that was named as 'similar to the S100 calcium-binding
proteins A15'. GenBank acc. AY465109 then appeared as
a cDNA cloned from mouse skin and was named as 'Mus
musculus S100 calcium-binding protein A15 mRNA'. The
amino acid sequences of the various Genbank entries
believed to describe the mouse psoriasin are aligned in
Figure 3 to illustrate that the amino acid sequences of the
ORF from each entry are identical. From here on, we will
refer to this gene as mouse S100A7/psoriasin. In addition,
according to the recently posted genomic sequence (GenBank acc. AY465110 and NT_078386), the mouse
S100A7/psoriasin gene maps within the murine S100
cluster on chromosome 3 (LOC381493, NCBI Map
Viewer Link), in a region similar to the human S100 cluster on chromosome 1q21 [10,19]. Our sequence database
searches and RT-PCR experiments demonstrate a putative
mouse ortholog of the human psoriasin gene exists and
like human psoriasin, it is expressed in skin and mammary tissue.
Phylogenetic analysis
The putative mouse psoriasin gene (originally "Similar to
S100A7") has been renamed "mouse S100A15" in Genbank (AY465110) [20]. This name implies higher homology to human S100A15 than to human psoriasin/
S100A7. However, it has been shown that human S100A7
and S100A15 diverged sometime during primate evolution [10]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine
the evolutionary relationships between the mouse and
human S100 genes (Figure 4). The results are consistent
with the divergence of human S100A7 and S100A15
occurring by duplication after the human/mouse split in
evolution, and thus the mouse gene is likely ancestral to
both human paralogs.
Presence of putative Jab1 binding motif in mouse S100A7/
psoriasin
A notable structural feature of the human psoriasin/
S100A7 gene is a consensus Jab1-binding domain
sequence that we have speculated may confer the ability of
human psoriasin/S100A7 to interact with Jab1 and so
play an important role in the mechanism by which
human psoriasin/S100A7 medicates its action [6]. Jab1
was originally identified as a factor influencing c-Jun

transcription of AP-1 regulated genes [21]. It is now
known that Jab1 is a component of a multimeric protein
complex (the CSN/COP9 signalosome) and that Jab1
interacts with many components of cell signalling pathways [22]. This may be in the context of either phosphorylation or proteasomal activities as Jab1 is also the only
known deneddylating protein active in control of the SCFcullin ubiquitin ligases [23].
A putative Jab1-binding motif is also present in the
murine S100A7/psoriasin sequence but is absent from the
human S100A15 sequence (Figure 5). Of the three amino
acid residues known to be conserved in the Jab-1 binding
motif of Jab-1 binding proteins (see highlighted residues
in Figure 5), one is different in the mouse S100A7/psoriasin. However, the change from aspartic acid in the human
S100A7 to a glutamic acid in mouse S100A7/psoriasin is
a conservative change and the residue remains acidic. In
contrast, the equivalent residue in human S100A15 is
threonine, a neutral residue containing an hydroxyl group

in its aliphatic side chain, and also having the potential to
be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation.
These observations support further our hypothesis that
the so-called mouse S100A15/psoriasin gene encodes a
product that is functionally more similar to human psoriasin/S100A7 than human S100A15. Since the human
and mouse Jab1 proteins are 99% identical (Genbank
accession number, mouse Jab1 AAC33900; human Jab1
NP_00364) we speculate that conservation of the Jab1binding domain in the mouse protein results in conservation of the interaction as well.
Expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin during mouse
mammary tumorigenesis
Our initial results shown in Figure 2 suggest that the
expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin may be upregulated during mammary tumorigenesis. This was of interest
since we and others have previously found that human
psoriasin/S100A7 expression is highly up-regulated in
human breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue

Conservation of the Jab1 binding motif in human psoriasin/S100A7 and mouse S100A7/psoriasin
Conservation of the Jab1 binding motif in human psoriasin/S100A7 and mouse S100A7/psoriasin Human psoriasin/S100A7 contains a Jab1 binding domain identified previously in p27 and LFA-1. Mouse S100A7/psoriasin also contains the Jab1 binding motif
but human S100A15 does not. Note that human S100A15 has a significant change, from a charged (D) to a neutral (T) amino
acid, in the first of the essential amino acids (color coded) required for Jab1 binding. The change seen in this residue in the
mouse S100A7/psoriasin protein is a conservative change and the residue (E) remains negatively charged. Amino acid colorcoding: non-polar (yellow), neutral polar (green), negatively charged (red). Hs = homo sapiens, Mm = Mus musculus. Adapted

Table 1: Correlation of mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression using RT-PCR and in situ hydridization in normal mammary gland and

matched normal mammary gland and DMBA-induced mammary tumors (n = 6) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described in
Materials and Methods. Sections from the corresponding adjacent tissue samples which had been formalin fixed and paraffinembedded, where used for in situ hybridization (ISH) with 35S-labelled antisense mouse S100A7/psoriasin probes. Specific
hybridization was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 as described in Materials and Methods. Results of the two analyses were correlated using
Spearmans test (r = 0.63, p < 0.02).

[2,24]. To confirm and extend this observation, further
analysis of murine mammary tumors was conducted by
both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization.
cDNAs were generated from matched normal mammary
gland and mammary gland tumors from DMBA-treated
CD1 wild-type mice (n = 6, same as in Figure 2A). Semi-

increased expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin mRNA
in mammary gland tumors relative to matched normal
mammary gland (p < 0.05) by Wilcoxon signed-rank test,

ing mouse S100A7/psoriasin, in situ hybridization was
performed on sections from paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks corresponding to the fresh frozen samples from
which RNA was extracted to generate cDNAs used for RTPCR analysis. A strong but focal signal was observed in all
six mammary gland tumors while the signal was weak or
undetectable in all of the matched normal mammary
gland tissues (Table 1, Figure 6). Assessment of the sections at high magnification and correlation with serial sections stained only by H&E, revealed that the S100A7/
psoriasin expression was usually confined to a subset of
epithelial tumor cells that showed morphological features
of squamous differentiation (Figure 6). Within these
regions of squamous differentiation expression was usually decreased with proximity to the squamous surface.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization results
showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient r = 0.63, p < 0.02) (Table 1).

inflammation, ISH was performed on sections from normal mouse tissues (see Figure 2A) as well as tissue from a
model of mouse skin inflammation. As seen in mammary
tumor tissues, a strong but focal signal was observed in
some samples and assessment of the sections at high magnification revealed that the mouse S100A7/psoriasin
expression was confined to a subset of epithelial cells surrounding hair shafts (Figure 7A) consistent with the localization of human psoriasin/S100A7 in normal human
skin [3]. No signal was observed using a mouse S100A7/
psoriasin sense probe. In addition we have speculated that
mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression would mimic its
human counterpart and be upregulated under conditions
of skin inflammation. A significant increase in mouse
S100A7/psoriasin RNA expression is seen at 24 hrs after
croton oil application correlating with the development
of inflammation characterized by leucocytic inflammation, (Figure 7B, Table 2).

Although up-regulation of mouse S100A7/psoriasin
expression occurred in DMBA induced tumors compared
to adjacent normal mammary gland tissue, expression levels showed a wide-scatter amongst the mammary tumors
(Figure 2). This was of interest since ERα has been
reported to have variable expression in chemical carcinogen induced tumors [25-27] and we have previously
shown an inverse association of human psoriasin/S100A7
expression with ERα in breast cancer [3,5]. We therefore
compared the expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin as
determined by in situ hydridization with ERα expression
assessed by IHC in adjacent sections from the same
tumors. An inverse association between mouse S100A7/
psoriasin and ERα expression was clearly evident but categorical contingency analysis did not reach statistical significance (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.073), likely due to
small numbers. However detailed comparison within
tumors showed that in tumors that expressed both genes,
mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression was restricted to
areas within heterogeneously positive ERα tumors that
lacked ERα expression. Interestingly, mouse mammary
tumors that develop due to targeting of the neu oncogene
to the mouse mammary gland (MMTV-neu) did not
express mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA nor ERα (data not
shown).

Expression of human psoriasin/S100A7 in relation to
differentiation in human tumors
The pattern of mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression
observed in mouse tumors and skin suggested an association of expression with the process of squamous differentiation. Studies of human psoriasin /S100A7 support a
similar association in skin and bladder cancer [28,29]. To
determine further the relation between psoriasin and different pathways of epithelial differentiation we therefore
examined human psoriasin expression relative to different
human tumor types in the cervix and lung, since overt
squamous differentiation is rare in human breast cancer.
In tumors in both cervix and lung, psoriasin expression
was significantly correlated with squamous differentiation (p < 0.0001). Expression was observed in over 90%
of squamous carcinomas in both organs, but was a rare
occurrence (<10%) in adenocarcinomas and absent in
other tumor types in the lung (Figure 8). As we have previously observed in both breast and skin, psoriasin
expression in the cervix was also most highly expressed in
squamous carcinoma-in-situ with lower levels in invasive
squamous carcinoma (p = 0.0013).

Expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin in a model of skin
inflammation
Human psoriasin/S100A7 was originally cloned from
psoriatic skin, an inflammatory skin disease [1]. Mouse
S100A7/psoriasin was however first identified in an
expression library constructed from normal mouse skin
(Genbank Acc AA792680 and AY465109) and our data
have confirmed mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA expression
in normal mouse skin (see Figure 2A). To determine if
mouse S100A7/psoriasin expression is upregulated in

Discussion
We have used structural and expression analysis to show
that a gene currently classified as mouse S100A15 (GenBank acc. AY465110) which maps within the murine
S100 cluster on chromosome 3 (see acc. NT_078386,
NCBI Map View Link and LOC381493) [10] should be
reclassified as mouse S100A17/psoriasin, as suggested by
Marenholz et al. [9]. This gene is not highly conserved relative to other members of the S100 family (~40% amino
acid sequence similarity of mouse S100A7 with either
human S100A7 and/or human S100A15, compared to
>60% amino acid sequence similarity of most other
known mouse S100A proteins to their human counter-

characteristic "pearling" pattern where epithelial tumor cells (purple) differentiate into keratinocytes (pink) before denucleating
and sloughing off into the inner lumen (white). Thus cells on the outer margin of the pearled area are undergoing squamous differentiation, and those correspond to cells expressing mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA, in A, B, and C.

parts, unpublished data) [10]. However, phylogenetic
analysis shows that while mouse retained an ancestral
S100A7/psoriasin gene, the human ortholog underwent
duplication and functional differentiation making the
assignment of orthology/paralogy only on the basis of
phyogenetic information uncertain.
In the human, the closely related psoriasin/S100A7 and
S100A15 appear to be functionally distinct. Although
both were isolated as overexpressed genes in human
psoriatic skin [1,20], we have previously identified
S100A7 to be differentially expressed in neoplastic
mammary gland [30]. Neither gene is substantially detectable in database analysis of the available normal human
mammary gland libraries, and only psoriasin/S100A7 is
present at high copy numbers (up to 2,300 tags per
200,000) in several mammary gland neoplasia libraries,
whereas S100A15 is absent or rarely detectable (<10 tags
per 200,000) [30]. Additionally, psoriasin/S100A7 is
expressed in several SAGE database libraries representing
human skin neoplasia, while S100A15 is not detected
(data not shown). Thus, despite some similarities in their
occurrence and expression in association with psoriasis
[20] these closely related human genes show dissimilar
expression patterns in mammary tumors suggesting distinct functional roles. In contrast, our studies show that
the pattern of gene expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin
during mammary tumorigenesis and skin inflammation
occurs in a similar pattern to that seen with human psoriasin/S100A7 [2,3]. Furthermore, while mouse S100A7/
psoriasin shows approximately equivalent amino acid
sequence similarity to both human S100A7 and human
S100A15 proteins, both mouse S100A7/psoriasin and
human psoriasin/S100A7 contain a putative Jab1-binding
motif that is functionally significant in the human at least
[6,7] but this motif is not found in human S100A15. We
conclude on the basis of chromosomal location, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence similarity,
conservation of a putative Jab1-binding motif, and similarities in patterns of expression, that mouse S100A7/ psoriasin is the murine ortholog of human psoriasin/S100A7.

Expression of human psoriasin/S100A7 was originally
attributed to skin pathologies where abnormal squamous
differentiation occurs [1]. In breast tumors where psoriasin/S100A7 is also expressed, overt squamous differentiation is rare. However it has been detected and suggested as
a marker of squamous differentiation in a subtype of bladder cancer [29]. Extending the latter finding our data here
shows that in cervix and lung, two tissues where squamous and glandular differentiation are both common differentiation pathways for carcinomas, psoriasin/S100A7
is commonly expressed and almost exclusively associated
with squamous tumor subtypes. The parallel finding that
mouse S100A7/psoriasin was distinctively associated with
areas of squamous differentiation within murine breast
adenocarcinomas suggests that similar factors are
involved in the regulation of both psoriasin/S100A7 and
murine S100A7/psoriasin genes, and is in keeping with a
similar role for the murine gene.
A role for human psoriasin/S100A7 in inflammation has
been suggested, since psoriasin/S100A7 can be secreted
and was shown to be chemotactic for neutrophils and
CD4+ T-cells in vitro [31]. Our current data from a model
of mouse skin inflammation is also consistent with such a
role, since a significant upregulation in mouse S100A7/
psoriasin expression occurs simultaneously with the acute
phase of skin inflammation after application of croton oil
to the mouse tail skin. The role for psoriasin/S100A7 in
tumorigenesis may be related to the activity of pro-survival pathways [7] and acquisition of apoptosis resistance
[8]. Our results here also provide indirect support for this
hypothesis, as mouse S100A7/psoriasin RNA was
expressed in keratinocytes at the margin of squamous
differentiation, where resistance to apoptotic stimuli may
be an important component of the sequence of differentiation and to allow time for production of large amounts
of keratin before finally undergoing desquamation, denucleation and cell death [32].
Finally, psoriasin has been implicated in human breast
cancer progression. Specifically, psoriasin/S100A7 has
been associated with the pre-invasive DCIS phenotype
[2], augmentation of several characteristics of malignancy

in vitro and in vivo [4,6] and with poor outcome in invasive estrogen receptor-negative tumors [3,5]. Our current
results also support the involvement of S100A7/psoriasin
in murine mammary tumorigenesis. Additionally, differential expression of mouse S100A7/psoriasin was
observed between DMBA and MMTV-neu induced mammary tumors, and a strong trend towards a negative correlation between mouse S100A7/psoriasin and estrogen
receptor alpha expression emerged in the DMBA induced
mammary tumors. Such data are consistent with the pattern of expression of human psoriasin/S100A7 in human
breast tumors, and are consistent with the view that
mouse S100A7/psoriasin subserves similar roles to
human psoriasin/S100A7 in mammary tumorigenesis
and breast cancer progression. It is nevertheless possible
that human psoriasin/S100A7 and mouse S100A7/psoriasin have several functions, depending on cellular context.
This is reflected by differences already observed in localization of expression in different cell types within a tissue
or subcellular localization, since psoriasin has been found
in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, at the cell periphery/
plasma membrane and it can also be secreted [33,34].

Conclusion
S100 proteins have been known to be differentially
expressed during tumorigenesis as well as other disease
states for some time. However, the functional roles they
may play in disease processes are poorly understood
[33,34]. In breast cancer, psoriasin/S100A7 is associated
with important biological and clinical aspects of the disease [30] and the identification of its potential ortholog in
the mouse is an important step to facilitate understanding
of its function and mechanism of action. The results
presented in this study strongly support the hypothesis
that mouse S100A7 is the murine ortholog of human psoriasin/S100A7, and provide a rationale for the manipulation of mouse S100A7/psoriasin in mice to gain
important insights into the function of human psoriasin/
S100A7.
