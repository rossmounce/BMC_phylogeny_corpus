Abstract
Background: There is no effective method to obtain genome information from single-celled
unculturable organisms such as radiolarians. Even worse, such organisms are often very difficult to
collect. Sequence analysis of 18S rDNA has been carried out, but obtaining the data has been
difficult and it has provided a rather limited amount of genome information. In this paper, we have
developed a method which provides a sufficient amount of data from an unculturable organism. The
effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by applying it to the provisional classification of a
set of unculturable organisms (radiolarians).
Results: Dendrogram was drawn regarding the single-celled unculturable species based on the
similarity score termed PaSS, offering a consistent result with the conventional taxonomy of them
built up based on phenotypes. This fact has shown that genome profiling-based technology
developed here can obtain genome information being sufficient for identifying and classifying species
from a single-celled organism.
Conclusion: Since this method is so simple, general, and yet powerful, it can be applied to various
organisms and cells, especially single-celled, uncluturable ones, for their genome analysis.

Background
Even in the post-genomic era, genome information is
often difficult to obtain. This is especially true for organisms that are difficult to collect due to the extremes of
their living environment. Radiolaria are protozoa used in
the study of geology and environmental and ecological
sciences because they leave a fossil of hard skeletal material that can provide a record of more than 500 million
years. Studies on Radiolaria have progressed since the
early work by Haeckel [1,2], which was based on phenotypic analysis. The diverse shapes of their skeletons have
been useful characteristics for the identification of species.

However, there is a need to obtain genomic information
about these organisms in order to more fully understand
their diversity and phylogeny. Recently, the gene encoding
a small subunit of ribosomal RNA (18S rDNA) has been
used for classifying species of Radiolaria, which are taxonomically controversial [3-5]. This is by no means an easy
task not only because of the difficulty in collecting samples, but also the additional complication that each
organism is composed of only a single cell, and methods
for culturing Radiolaria in the laboratory are not available. This means that only a single set of genomic DNA
molecules can be obtained for experiments such as PCR.

Species identification and/or classification from a single
cell has an ultimate value for various purposes: genome
analysis of precious specimens using only a minute fraction of the available sample or tracing alterations in the
genome of somatic cells (e.g., differences between the
genomes of the cells from the brain and heart). It will be
also useful for settling controversial classification problems regarding Radiolarian [6]. The sequence information
obtained from 18 S rDNA is often insufficient to identify
and classify species in detail, wanting a method which can
provide a more amount of information. This challenge is
addressed in this paper: the authors developed a general
way to obtain genome information from a single cell. For
this purpose, a triple-session of random PCR was successfully employed. The experimental results obtained by
genome profiling (GP) [7-10] of a group of Radiolaria
gave consistent data from a taxonomical viewpoint. The
authenticity of the results, including sequence analysis
data, is extensively discussed.

Results and discussion
Experimental materials and genome profiling
Three sessions of random PCR (70 cycles in all) enabled
us to obtain DNA fragments from single-celled organisms.
The DNA fragments were subjected to micro-TGGE [11],
providing genome profiles as shown in Fig. 1b. In this
series of experiments, currently unculturable and difficultto-collect species of Haeckel's Radiolaria and related
organisms (C and E in Table 1) were collected in the field
and examined (Fig. 1). The genome profiles of these
organisms were processed to generate species identification dots (spiddos) as shown in Fig. 1c. Since these dots
were obtained after standardization and normalization by
utilizing the internal reference (see Materials and Methods), the coordinates of these spiddos can be regarded as
sufficiently reproducible, intrinsic properties of each
genome without the influence of environmental factors
[12,13]. The visual pattern of spiddos of an organism on
the plane tells us roughly which type of family it belongs
to. On the other hand, phenotypes of organisms such as
those shown in Fig. 1a provide abundant information
about the environment that must have affected the formation of the detailed shape and size. Therefore, spiddos can
be used to assign the species and measure the difference
(distance) between two organisms at the genome level.
PaSS and clustering analyses
Quantitative analysis of spiddos has been established as
PaSS (pattern similarity score) analysis [13]. In preceding
studies, the reproducibility of this method has been thoroughly examined and established to be within 1% of
errors as PaSS values for a moderately trained person of
this technology, which were obtained by measuring the
self-PaSS, i.e., the PaSS value for the same genome (operationally, this is obtained based on two genome profiles

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/135

through two independent trials beginning with the same
culture (clone) or with the same tissue of an organism). In
other words, the same sample usually provides the PaSS
value of 0.986 ± 0.003, if compared with each other [13].
As shown in Fig. 2, PaSS values for each pair of Polycystinea are significantly larger (c.f., PaSS value of 1 indicates a complete match and 0.435 ± 0.091 for non-related
two genomes [13]) in comparison to those of the other
pairs. In contrast, pairs composed of a radiolarian and a
bacterium or a bacterium and a fungus gave significantly
lower PaSS values, which is clearly shown in the lower left
triangle of Fig. 2. To evaluate the PaSS values obtained
here, we can refer to a list of PaSS made for all organisms
so far examined (Table 2). Although these values were statistically obtained based on GP data of more than 100
species and they may change depending on the number
and the species of organisms analyzed, they can be used
with a finite reliability as a reference to estimate the difference between two genomes at a particular level of taxon.
According to Table 2, the values presented in Fig. 2
(~0.85) seem relatively high (almost the level of genus),
and this result may indicate the degree of similarity of
genomes in Haeckel's Radiolaria.
Phenotype tree is drawn in Fig. 3a. On the other hand, we
employed a clustering analysis (group average
method)[14] to the PaSS scores and obtained the results
shown in Fig. 3b. A reasonable result was obtained at a
distance for clustering of 0.149 where all of the members
of Polycystinea (A1~A5) were integrated in the same cluster though it includes Foraminiferida (C) as a unique
stranger, and there are some rearrangements in branches
among the species of Polycystinea. At the same time,
mutually distant species such as diatom, bacteria, and
fungus (E~H) were separate. At the distance of 0.163, all
of the Rhizaria (A1~A5, B~D) were combined into a cluster
while the other mutually-distant species (E~H) were still
isolated, conforming to the concept of traditional taxonomy. If we consider that the classification of Polycystinea
is under construction and there is generally an experimental error in the PaSS values of approximately 1 % [13] and
that Some Radiolaria, such as the groups Polycystinea A1
and A3 are well known to have symbiotic algae within the
cell [15], while other Polycystinea (A2, A4, A5) do not, the
apparent minor differences may be insignificant (in other
words, beyond the resolution of the current approach)
and as a whole, the entire clustering seems rational. Therefore, these results strongly indicate that the method
applied here, i.e., random PCR-based genome profiling,
could provide the sufficient amount of genomic information from a single cell. The GP method supported the classical Haeckel's view of Radiolaria as monophyletic group,
and remained in opposition to the polyphyly of Radiolaria suggested by rRNA and actin phylogenies [6,16]
although the results obtained here are provisional.

spiddos of panels Fig. 1c-F and -G were published in refs 13 and 19, respectively, newly processed to spiddos here. The sample
for the panel Fig. 1c-H is newly reported.

Reliability tested by sequencing
Since there are no published genome sequences for any
radiolarians or related organisms, the results obtained
here must be critically evaluated based on other available
information. Currently, the most common approach is to
sequence the 18S rDNA; however, it is very difficult to
carry out both GP and 18S rDNA sequencing experiments
with single-celled and unculturable organisms (only a single copy of each DNA molecule is available). However,
anyhow, we tried to amplify the 18S rDNA genes with specific PCR primers (see Materials and Methods) using the
template DNA used for GP as the template (which, naturally, contations random PCR products also). We were not
always able to amplify the target molecule (18S rDNA).
This may be due to a stochastic or inevitable loss of the
template DNA when dealing with a single copy. Though

we can expect least to obtain 18S rDNA from the mixture
of DNAs obtains after genome profiling, DNA molecules
amplified using the primers designed for 18S rDNA from
the genome of one sample (Dictyocoryne profunda) happened to have around the expected molecular size (200
bp) and were sequenced. After searching the database
(DDBJ) with FASTA, the sequence obtained was found not
to be the same as any of those reported to date (data not
shown). Sequences currently in the database included
Didymocyrtis tetrathalamus, Dictyocoryne profunda, and Dictyocoryne truncatum. In addition to these, Acantharea (11
entries), Phaeodarea (3 entries), Polycystinea (20 entries)
have been reported. The results of our analysis are as follows: i) the sequence obtained was so novel that it had not
been reported previously, ii) it had the highest similarity
(66.7 %) with partial 18S rDNA of a protozoan, Euglena

spathirhyncha, iii) none of the small subunit ribosomal
DNA sequences of organisms that might be expected as
contaminants, such as algae, planktonic organisms, fungi
or bacteria were highly ranked within the top 200
sequences. Therefore, although the result could not be
reproducibly tested, as the same genome cannot be
obtained again, it is very plausible that the DNA sequence
we obtained and used for GP analysis was that of a Radiolarian 18S rDNA that had never been sequenced. At the
same time, we also sequenced the random PCR products
of samples A2, A3-1, 2, B, D-1 and others (70 reads in total,
305 nucleotides on average; data not shown) and found
that: i) the sequences obtained were quite novel with no
registered sequences having more than 70 % similarity
except one E. coli sequence (99 % similarity) and two
algae sequences (81 % and 77 % similarities), and ii)

according to the FASTA search, sequences with the highest
similarity with the query sequences were not those of
probable contaminants but those of protozoa, which are
related to Radiolaria. According to the first finding, an
accidental contamination of E. coli DNA must have happened during the experiment. It may also mean that some
of our samples were contaminated with algae. However,
since they are not major representatives in the sequencing
results for 70 clones, they must not have contributed significantly to the spiddos generated in the GP experiments.
It is already known that a minor population of DNAs can
not be represented in GP unless they have exceptionally
strong binding sites for a primer or highly repetitive
sequences that can be amplified by random PCR. Therefore, these findings provide supporting evidence that the

random PCR products were derived from the genomes of
Radiolaria.
In conclusion, the results presented here, including the
data indicating that GPs of Radiolarians provided a taxonomically-consistent clustering result (Figs. 2 and 3),
indicate that genome profiles for Radiolarians can be
obtained from a single cell. Here, we need to recall the fact
that GPs obtained here may consist of composite
genomes, e.g., those of host and parasitic/symbiotic
organisms which can not be observed by the conventional
microscopic techniques (though employing more sophisticated technologies such as SEM will make it possible). In
other words, some of GPs reported here may represent a
metagenome, or 'an ensemble of genomes' (originally, GP
was developed based on the idea that the genome is the
whole ensemble of DNAs contained in a cell [17]). If so,
it is reasonable to register such GPs as being representative
of Radiolaria since we cannot separate the symbiotic

genomes effectively, and this type of partnership is often
permanent. We think this fact dose not devaluate the
methodology established here.

Conclusion
In this paper we developed a potent method to obtain
genome information from unculturable and single-celled
organisms. This was demonstrated by the experiments
applied to radiolarians sampled in the field. Final confirmation can only be obtained by the repeating similar
experiments using other fresh experimental materials.
Therefore, the classification reported here should be considered to be rather tentative, but the GP method shows
promise for solving controversial classification problems.
We believe this is the first success in which the genomes of
unculturable, single-celled organisms were treated quantitatively and systematically to extract genomic information
for comparison.

Methods
DNA of radiolarians and the other organisms
The samples of protozoa were collected from surface seawater during 2003–2005. Protozoa, such as species
belonging to Phaeodaria and Acantharia, Foraminifera,
and Diatomophyceae were obtained from the shores off
of Sado Island, Japan. Radiolarians, including Dictyocoryne
truncatum, Dictyocoryne profunda, Didymocyrtis tetrathala-

mus, Spongaster tetras, Dictyocoryne truncatum, Eucyrtidium
hexasticum, Hymeniastrum euclidis were from the shores off
of Okinawa Island, Japan. The collected organisms are
listed in Table 1 with their taxonomical classification and
sampling date and location. Photomicrographs of some
of the organisms are shown in Fig. 1a. The plankton-net
collected microbes were dissolved in sterile water. Then
we prepared each organism as a single cell by sucking it

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:135

together with a small aliquot(less than 1 µl including a
cell) under the microscopic view without contaminating
the other visible organisms and diluted it with pure alcohol of more than 1 ml. An aliquot (1 µl) of this solution
which contains the cell was used for PCR. Thus, the sample cells used here were microscopically pure but it can
not rule out the possibility of being contaminated with
intracellular organisms (symbionts) or externally invisible virus-like organisms (though its probability is less
than a millionth of that of finding in the original sea water
due to the repeated dilution). The other organisms dealt
here (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus
subtilis) were reported previously [10,13].
DNA preparation
Each sample was purified by picking up a single-cell in an
aliquot. Preparation of DNA was carried out by the alkaline extraction method [18]. Briefly, the procedures
adopted here are as follows: 1) An aliquot containing a
single cell which had been identified by phenotype under
the microscope was transferred into an Eppendorf tube; 2)
After adding 3 µl of 0.5 M NaOH, the sample solution was
incubated at 94°C for 5 min and then at 64°C for 60 min;
3) the sample solution was neutralized with 5 µl of 200
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and incubated at 65°C.
Genome profiling (GP)
GP is composed of two major steps: random PCR and
temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)(Fig. 4).
Random PCR was performed using a single primer of
dodeca-nucleotides (pfM12, dAGAACGCGCCTG) with
the 5'-end Cy3-labeled. This primer sequence has been
recommended for general use including the application to
animal cells [7]. As one round of PCR amplification of
DNA from a single cell does not produce a sufficient
amount of DNA, three rounds were employed. The first
PCR reaction (50 µl) contained 200 µM dNTPs (N=
G,A,T,C), 0.5 µM primer, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50
mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.02 unit/µl Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and a particular amount of
template DNA. In the random PCR experiments, special
cares were taken as follows ; i) The reaction mixtures just
before adding template DNA were UV irradiated. ii) the
third session of random PCR was stopped sufficiently
before the consumption of the primers so as to keep the
products in the double stranded state. Random PCR was
carried out with 30 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s),
annealing (26°C, 2 min) and extension (47°C, 2 min)
using a PTC-100TM PCR machine (MJ Research, Inc.,
Massachusetts, USA). The second random PCR (50 µl)
contained 5 µl of the first PCR products as template and
the same concentrations of the other constituents, and the
reaction was run for 30 cycles under the same conditions.
The third round of random PCR (25 µl) contained 1 µl of
the second round products as template. The third round

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/135

of PCR was stopped after 10 cycles in order to produce as
much double-stranded DNA as possible. The DNA samples were subjected to µ-TGGE [11], which adopts a tiny
slab gel of 24 × 16 × 1 mm3 for electrophoresis using a
temperature-gradient generator, µ-TG (Taitec, Saitama,
Japan). In each run of electrophoresis, an internal reference DNA was co-migrated. The 200-bp reference DNA
(the 191-bp bacteriophage fd gene VIII, sites 1350~1540
attached to a 9-bp sequence, CTACGTCTC, at the 3'-end)
is experimentally determined to have a melting temperature of 60°C under standard conditions. The gel used was
6% acrylamide (acrylamide:bis = 19:1) containing 90 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA and 8
M urea. The linear temperature gradient was run from
15°C to 60°C. After electrophoresis, DNA bands were
detected with a fluorescence imager (Molecular Imager
FX, Biorad, Hercules, CA) or by silver staining [11].
Spiddos and PaSS
Genome profiles obtained by GP are highly informative
but difficult to manage due to their complexity. However,
this inconvenience was overcome by introducing the featuring points, designated as spiddos (species identification
dots), which can represent genome profiles compactly
[13]. The featuring points, or spiddos, correspond to the
points where structural transitions of DNA occur, such as
double-stranded to single-stranded DNA [19]. Spiddos can
be used to provide a sufficient amount of information for
identifying species [13]. One can easily increase the
amount of information about the genome by adding spiddos obtained by another GP operated with a different
primer. Because the number of possible primers is so large
(1.6 × 107 for dodecanucleotides), many GPs (thus, spiddos) can be obtained if necessary. Using spiddos, we can
define the pattern similarity score (PaSS) of the genomes
between two species as follows:

PaSS = 1 −

1 n Pi − Pi′
∑
n i =1 Pi + Pi′

0ϹPass Ϲ 1

(1)

where Pi and Pi′ correspond to the normalized positional
vectors (composed of two elements, mobility and temperature) for spiddos Pi and Pi' collected from two genome
profiles (discriminated with or without a prime), respectively, and i denotes the serial number of spiddos. A database site has been constructed (On-web GP [20]) in order
to provide semi-automatic data processing [21]. The PaSS
value thus obtained is empirically known to be a good
measure to quantify the closeness between two species (or
cells) [13].

Where pass (i, j ; A, B) means the PaSS elementary value
between the i-th element of the genome profile of an
organism A and j-th element of the genome profile of an
organism B ; PaSSP,Q means the PaSS value between the
spiddos for organisms, P and Q ; NA and NB, stand for the
number of spiddos belong to A and B, respectively ; and ν
stands for the number of species (Fig.5).
Clustering analysis
The group average method [14] was used for the clustering
analysis of the genomes of the organisms examined here.
With this method, a separate element is integrated into a
cluster if the distance is smaller than or equal to a finite
value between the element and at least one member of the
cluster.

Reduction of genome information from a single cell into a
Reduction of genome information from a single cell
into a genome profile. Successive random PCR, in which
the product of one round of random PCR was used as the
template for the next session of random PCR, was carried
out. Note that primer binding occurs in a mismatch-containing structure in this relaxed mode of PCR (random PCR),
thus enabling us to sample DNA fragments from various sites
of the genome. In TGGE, DNA fragments layered on the top
of a slab gel migrate downward in a horizontal line with a
characteristic curvature caused by the temperature gradient.
Featuring point(s) of each DNA fragment are assigned and
processed to generate species identification dots (spiddos) with
a computer. The PaSS (pattern similarity score) calculation is
performed as described in the text.

Sequencing and FASTA analysis
Some of the random PCR products (DNA) were cloned
and analyzed by sequencing. In addition, a part of the 18S
rDNA was subjected to sequencing. This product was
obtained by PCR-amplification using the mixture of random PCR products plus the template genome DNA as a
template source and the primers, F (GAGGGCAAGTCTGGT) and R (ACGACGGTATCTGAT), which were
designed as in the preceding study [20]. The sequencing
was done by adopting the TA cloning method (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California, USA). The DNA sequencer, DSQ2000L (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for this purpose. Experimentally obtained DNA sequences were analyzed with FASTA against all of the genomes and genes in
the database. DNA segments of more than 55 % similarity
were carefully analyzed based on their annotations so as
to determine the source of the DNA sequences.
