Abstract
Background: The genetic background of Argentineans is a mosaic of different continental ancestries. From
colonial to present times, the genetic contribution of Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans has superposed to or
replaced the indigenous genetic ‘stratum’. A sample of 384 individuals representing different Argentinean provinces
was collected and genotyped for the first and the second mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable regions, and
selectively genotyped for mtDNA SNPs. This data was analyzed together with additional 440 profiles from rural and
urban populations plus 304 from Native American Argentineans, all available from the literature. A worldwide
database was used for phylogeographic inferences, inter-population comparisons, and admixture analysis. Samples
identified as belonging to hg (hg) H2a5 were sequenced for the entire mtDNA genome.
Results: Phylogenetic and admixture analyses indicate that only half of the Native American component in urban
Argentineans might be attributed to the legacy of extinct ancestral Argentineans and that the Spanish genetic
contribution is slightly higher than the Italian one. Entire H2a5 genomes linked these Argentinean mtDNAs to the
Basque Country and improved the phylogeny of this Basque autochthonous clade. The fingerprint of African slaves
in urban Argentinean mtDNAs was low and it can be phylogeographically attributed predominantly to western
African. The European component is significantly more prevalent in the Buenos Aires province, the main gate of
entrance for Atlantic immigration to Argentina, while the Native American component is larger in North and South
Argentina. AMOVA, Principal Component Analysis and hgs/haplotype patterns in Argentina revealed an important
level of genetic sub-structure in the country.
Conclusions: Studies aimed to compare mtDNA frequency profiles from different Argentinean geographical regions (e.
g., forensic and case-control studies) should take into account the important genetic heterogeneity of the country in
order to prevent false positive claims of association in disease studies or inadequate evaluation of forensic evidence.

Background
The inhabitation of the Americas took place with the
passage of people from northeast Asia to North America, who then rapidly moved southwards along the continent [1-4]. The first human settlements in Argentina
were found in the Patagonia and dated to ~13,000 years

ago (y.a.) [5]. The colonial period (roughly 1550-1810)
began with the arrival of Spanish conquerors, and their
domination lasted until the independence wars. During
the colonial era, the Spaniards entered Argentina from
Peru and Bolivia mainly through the northern ‘Camino
Real’ and by the Río de la Plata, and they established a
permanent colony on the site of what would later
become Buenos Aires. Río de la Plata was also one of
the main gates of entrance for other trans-Atlantic
immigrants, such as African slaves. Indigenous people
were under the domination of Spanish colonizers and
many of these groups were exterminated or progressively admixed with the colonizers. Only natives

inhabiting the mountainous north-western and southern
Argentina survived the repression. At the end of the
19th century, the Native populations were exterminated
in the central region and upper Patagonia. The Argentinean National Constitution of 1853 promoted immigration from Europe, and the country received large waves
of European immigrants, predominantly Italians (e.g.,
from South Italy) and Spanish (e.g., Galicia in northwest
Spain [6]). In about 100 years, the census of Argentina
increased by one order of magnitude to about 20 million
people in 1960. Internal demographic movements were
also important in Argentina during the industrialization
period (1930-1950). Thus, waves of Native Americans
moved from northern Native Argentinean enclaves to
the largest cities of the country. In the seventies, massive numbers of immigrants would also arrive to the
main cities coming from bordering countries (Bolivia,
Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Peru) [7-9].
Argentina is a melting pot of people with different
continental ancestries but a majority of the citizens are
descendents of colonial-era settlers and of the late19th
and early20th century European immigrants. The official
census in Argentina, INDEC (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos; http://www.indec.gov.ar/), indicates
that the country is populated by more than 40 million
people, of which only about 600,000 (~1.7%) considered
themselves as belonging to or descending from indigenous groups. About 30 officially recognized indigenous
populations survived the colonial and post-colonial period up to the present and nowadays there are more than
25 Native speaking live languages [10]. The most important ones in terms of population size are the Mapuches
in the South, and the Collas (also spelled Kollas), Tobas,
Wichí and Guaraní in the North.
It is difficult to determine the real impact of the different demographic changes occurred in Argentina during the last few centuries. From a genetic point of view,
one could indirectly predict the impact of the different
contributors by looking at the census; however, the census can be somehow misleading for several reasons.
Thus, the INDEC indicates that the proportion of Italians arriving to Argentina in the 1980 and 1991 was
~47% and ~51% involving about 236,467 and 167,977
individuals, respectively; while the Spaniards were 41%
and 38% involving about 202,523 and 124,667 individuals, respectively. However, historical sources [7-9]
indicate that Spain contributed more significantly to the
Argentinean pool in several periods of the last 150 years
(Table 1). On the other hand, the ‘masculinity index’ (as
the amount of male immigrants each 100 female immigrants [8]) was larger for Italians than for Spaniards [8],
which would contribute e.g. to inflating the signal left
by Spaniards on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of
contemporary Argentineans.

The study of mtDNA data has been demonstrated to
be very useful in unraveling the patterns of human
worldwide migrations, in particular, those occurred in
America [1-3,11-15]. Several studies have been devoted
to the analysis of mtDNA in Argentinean populations.
Ginther et al. [16] analyzed the first hypervariable region
(HVS-I) in a sample of indigenous Mapuches (South);
the study revealed the predominant Native American
nature of this population. Cabana et al. [17] analyzed
the HVS-I of individuals belonging to different ethnic
groups from Gran Chaco (North), and focused on the
historical events occurring in this northern Argentinean
region. Álvarez-Iglesias et al. [18] showed a SNP-based
methodological approach to allocate Native American
mtDNAs into hgs [18]. A sample from Córdoba (Argentina) was also analyzed by Salas et al. [19]; a high proportion of the Native American component was
observed in the mtDNA lineages (~41%) but not on the
Y-chromosome (~2%). Martínez-Marignac et al. [20]
analyzed a sample from the city of La Plata (Central
Argentina); the results corroborated the hg distribution
observed in previous studies. In a sample from Argentina, the results of Bobillo et al. [21] showed that Amerindian hgs were most frequent in North and South
(60%) and decreased to less than 50% in Central. García
and Demarchi [22] reported hg frequencies in nine villages from central Argentina, indicating that ~80% of
the lineages belonged to native American hgs. In a congress report, Catelli et al. [23] presented broad hg frequencies of a subset of the sample used in the present
study. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were also investigated in six Mbyá-Guaraní villages (northeastern) [24],
being A2 and D1 the ones exhibiting the highest frequencies (~41% and ~36%, respectively). Most recently,
Corach et al. [25] investigated the genetic admixture of
unrelated male individuals from eight different provinces
using different sets of markers; the results showed that
different ancestry components were detectable in contemporary Argentineans, the amounts depending on the
genetic system applied, exhibiting large inter-individual
heterogeneity.
The present study has been motivated by the following reasons: (i) although several Argentinean populations have been analyzed to date, Argentina has not
been analyzed from a global perspective (with the exception of the [25] study which however focus on a different sampling strategy, different methodology and aims),
and several regions still remain uncharacterized, (ii)
there is a need to explore the levels of population stratification within the Argentinean country since this could
have important consequences in different biomedical
studies, (iii) a comprehensive and comparative analysis
of the mtDNA patterns observed in Native communities
versus rural and urban population is still lacking, and

Inter-census period

The percentages in the census indicate the approximate contribution regarding to the total immigrants. *1 Lattes and Sautu [8] defines the ‘masculinity index’
(here denote as M) as the amount of man immigrants per 100 woman immigrants. Here, we define MIT/MSP as the quotient of the M value in Italians divided by
the M value in Spaniards.

(iv) while Native American lineages in Argentina have
been analyzed with certain resolution, the provenience
of the trans-Atlantic immigration has been poorly
inferred from control region sequences.

Methods
DNA samples

A total of 384 blood samples were collected from unrelated donors by the Equipo Argentino de Antropología
Forense, and the Laboratorio de Inmunogenética y Diagnóstico Molecular de Córdoba representing different

regions in Argentina (Figure 1). All the participants
have permanent residence in Argentina. An undetermined proportion of them could descent from nonArgentinean parents or great-parents but this information was not recruited. One of the aims of the present
study was to evaluate the proportion of Native American component that is autochthonous versus non-autochthonous in people that have permanent residence in
the country. The analysis provides therefore a rough
estimate of the amount of autochthonous lineages that
are among present-day Argentineans. On the other

hand, since we have carried out a meta-analysis of
Argentinean mtDNA profiles adding to our set of
lineages those collected from the literature, uncertainty
exists concerning the characterization of many donors
(see discussion below).
The geographic origin and sizes of the samples analyzed in the present study are summarized in Additional
file 1: Table S1. Broad hg frequencies of a subset of
these samples have been summarized in a previous congress report [23].
DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform standard
procedures. Written informed consent was obtained in
Argentina from all the participants. In addition, an Institutional Ethical approval to carry out this study was
obtained from the Equipo Argentino de Antropología
Forense (EAAF) and the University of Santiago de
Compostela.
PCR, sequencing and minisequencing analysis

Samples were PCR amplified and sequenced for HVS-I
and HVS-II regions as described previously [23]. In addition, all the profiles were contrasted with the phylogeny
in order to detect potential artifacts e.g. [26]. In order to
increase the phylogenetic resolution, most of the samples
were genotyped for sets of diagnostic SNPs mainly
located in the coding region (mtSNPs). For the samples
belonging to R0 (European ancestry), a set of 71 mtSNPs
were genotyped as described previously [27] whereas
samples belonging to Native American hgs were additionally genotyped for 31 mtSNPs as described in [18].
The full set of results for the control region sequences
and the mtSNPs are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2.
Population database

A database of mtDNA profiles of rural and urban populations (referred to in this article as the admixed group/
population) and indigenous Argentineans has been compiled from the literature. Together with the samples
analyzed here, the Argentinean database contains 824
mtDNAs representing 24 different populations. The
Native American groups were collected from (a) North
Argentina (n = 265), and includes Coyas (n = 61) from
the provinces of Jujuy and Salta [18], Pilagá (n = 38)
and Toba (n = 24) from Gran Chaco (Formosa), Toba
(n = 43) from Chaco (Formosa), and Wichí or Mataco
(n = 99) from Gran Chaco [17], and (b) South Argentina, represented by 39 Mapuches [16]. The admixed
populations were collected from: (a) North Argentina (n
= 98), including Formosa (n = 19), Chaco (n = 5), Misiones (n = 48) and Corrientes (n = 26) [21]; (b) Central
Argentina (n = 295) from Santa Fe (n = 6) and Buenos
Aires (n = 187) [21] and Córdoba (n = 102) [19]; and
(c) South Argentina (n = 47) from Río Negro (n = 46)
and Chubut (n = 1) [21].

In addition, data from ancient DNA studies [28] or
other studies aimed to target specific mtDNA lineages
(such as [1]) were also used for database searching.
A database of European (Italian and Spanish) and
other Argentinean neighboring populations (including
Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Chile) were additionally
used for the admixture analysis. Details on the samples
used in this study are provided in Additional file 1:
Table S1.
Admixture analysis

Here, we are interested in separately analyzing the origin
of the European and the Native American component of
urban Argentineans. It was known from the Argentinean
census that Spain and Italy were the two main countries
in supplying European immigrants to Argentina. In
modern times, Argentina has been also the destination
of thousands of immigrants coming from neighboring
countries that have a predominant Native American
component. A premise of admixture analysis is that the
source populations considered in the model are genetically different. Figure 2 indicates this feature by way of
exploring the number of sharing haplotypes between the
population groups involved in the admixture analysis.
Differences between Italy and Spain are small and cannot be detected when looking at statistical tests of population differentiation (yielding non-significant statistical
differences; data not shown) or examining genetic distances (FST = 0.0022); an issue that could be improved
in the future if adding more molecular information to
the statistical model (e.g. entire genomes and larger
sample sizes). Although FST is not informative at indicating differences between Spain and Italy, and given
the fact that one of the admixed analysis carried out in
the present study (see below) relies on haplotype sharing, we have carried out a simulation analysis in order
to test if the two populations are sufficiently different in
terms of haplotype sharing in order to support the
results yielded by the admixture analysis. We performed
a simulation that consists of (i) randomly distributing in
10,000 iterations the total number of individuals (from
Spain and Italy jointly considered) in two groups (with
samples sizes as in the original samples), (ii) compute
the proportion of shared haplotypes each time, and (iii)
reconstruct the distribution of this statistics under the
null hypothesis of no differentiation. Clearly, the
observed haplotype sharing is significantly smaller than
5th percentile of this distribution (see Additional file 3:
Figure S1). This allowed to conclude that haplotype
sharing contains enough information to discriminate
Spain and Italy and therefore to compute admixture
proportions of Argentineans from Europe.
The first admixture model was undertaken as
described by Salas et al. [29]; see also [30]. Since this

model is based on hg frequencies, it was only applied to
infer the contribution of the European countries to the
population of Argentina. This is because the Native
American component was too homogeneous and the
phylogenetic hg resolution was too low (at the control
region level) to yield meaningful results.
The second admixed model was applied as described
previously [14], but with an extension of the original
model that is detailed below. The probability of origin
of each of the sub-continental region can be computed

regional datasets (e.g., Spain and Italy); and pic, the frequency of the sequence i in the whole database. The
same analysis was carried out independently considering
n to be the number of Argentinean sequences that have
cero, one or two mutational differences from the
sequences contained in the database. We will refer to
P 0 , P 1 , and P 2 , for the admixture components of
sequences that match perfectly, differ by one mutational
step, or two, respectively. In order to account for different sample sizes in the source populations, admixed
components (and their 95% C.I.) were built by way of
bootstrapping, taken 1000 re-samples of the source
populations of size 300 each (other sample sizes yielded
consistent results; data not shown).

mean number of pairwise differences (M). AMOVA
(Analysis of Molecular Variance) and the significance of
the covariance components associated with different
levels of genetic structure were tested on haplotypes and
haplogroup frequencies applying a non-parametric permutation procedure. The latter analyses and population
pairwise FST values, between/within population average
nucleotide pairwise differences, and Nei’s inter-population distances, were computed using Arlequin 3.5.1.2
[32]. Diversity indices, phylogeographic inferences and
inter-population comparisons were carried out using the
sequence range 16090 to 16365, since this is the common segment reported in the literature. Problematic
variation located around 16189 usually associated to
length heteroplasmy, e.g., 16182C or 16183C, was
ignored. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out on population hg frequencies using R http://
www.r-project.org/. AMOVA and PCA were performed
on Argentinean samples of sample sizes ≥ 20 (see Additional file 1: Table S1).
Fisher’s exact test and Pearson’s chi-square test were
undertaken using the R package http://www.r-project.
org/, a significant value of a = 0.05 was considered.
Finally, estimation of the time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA) and SDs of hg H2a5 were
carried out according to Saillard et al. [33]and using an
evolutionary rate estimate for the entire mtDNA molecule as reported by Soares et al. [34].

sample (Table 2). The analysis was also carried out
separately for the the Native American and the European components (Table 2). The Native American
component of the admixed populations has higher
diversity values than the one of the indigenous groups
(Table 2) for all the indices computed. Within the
admixed groups, there is more sequence diversity in
Central and South while nucleotide diversity is higher in
Argentina.
The diversity of European lineages in the admixed
group is higher in the North (Table 2). As expected, the
European component is more diverse than the Native
American one (Table 2) for the haplotype diversity, corresponding with their demographic histories, which is
about four times older for the Europeans than for the
Native Americans with the latter suffering strong bottlenecks at the time of entrance through the Bering Strait
[1-4]; nucleotide diversity shows the opposite pattern
which in this case most likely mirrors the low resolution
of the HVS-I in a high proportion of European lineages
(e.g. macro-hgs R0). Finally, admixed groups are genetically more diverse than the Native American ones
(Table 2).
Phylogeography of mtDNA lineages in Argentina

The Native American component observed in the urban
populations was 66%, 41%, and 70% in South, Central,
and North, respectively (Figure 1) and it was virtually
100% in most Native American groups. The distribution
of Native American hgs was substantially different in

the main Argentinean regions especially when looking at
urban populations (Figure 1A); for instance, hg A2 constitutes 30% in North admixed populations but only
17% in South admixed populations (Figure 1A) (Pearson’s c2 test; un-adjusted P-value = 0.00561). Moreover,
the percentages of the different Native American hgs
significantly differ when comparing admixed with native
populations (Figure 1A vs Figure 1B), even when comparing samples from the same geographical location;
thus, for example, when considering only the Native
American component of the urban populations, hg B2 is
19% in North admixed populations versus 38% in North
Natives (Pearson’s c 2 test; un-adjusted P-value =
0.01808), or hgs B2 and D1 have frequencies of 11% versus 46% (hg B2; Pearson’s c2 test; un-adjusted P-value <
0.0000) and 46% versus 23% (hg D1; Pearson’s c2 test;
un-adjusted P-value = 0.00334) in South admixed populations versus South Natives.
The lower prevalence of Native American hgs
observed in Central Argentina coincides with the high
proportion of European lineages in this region, mirroring the fact that this was the main European settlement
area in the country; e.g. the European component is significantly more predominant in Central (56%) than in
North (29%; Pearson’s c 2 test; un-adjusted P-value <

African slaves were brought to Argentina by Europeans during the period of the Atlantic slave trade

impact of this process in the mtDNA pool of Argentina
was much lower than in other American regions
[11,14,37,38]. Sub-Saharan lineages represent only 1-3%
of the total mtDNA component observed in Argentina..
The most prevalent sub-Saharan HVS-I mtDNAs in
Argentina are: (i) the L2c2 profile C16223T C16264T
C16278T T16311C, which also appears in Brazil [38,39]
and other American locations [40]; exact matches of
this mtDNA profile were found in Gabon [41], Cabinda
[42], Mozambique [43] and some other South African
locations; and (ii) the L3f1a mtDNA G16129A T16209C
C16223T C16292T C16295T T16311C that also
appeared in Brazil [39,44] and in US ‘African Americans’
[40,45]; this hg has a likely origin in East Africa [43] but
probably arrived in America via West-Central Africa
[41] or Southwest Africa [42]; see also [36]. Other typical North African profiles belonging to hg U6 reached
Argentina via Portugal or Madeira (such as T16172C
C16174T C16188T A16219G T16311C; hg U6b) [46,47],
Canary islands (G16129A C16169T T16172C T16189C
[48]) or directly from Morocco (T16172C A16183C
T16189C A16219G C16239T C16278T T16362C [49]).
Only two Argentinean mtDNAs belong to hg M1, the
hg that is prevalent in the Middle East and East Africa
and with a wide distribution in several African regions.
For instance, matches for G16129A T16189C C16223T
T16249C T16311C T16359C were observed in the Chad
Basin [50], Ethiopia [51] and Egypt [52] while profile
G16129A T16189C T16249C T16311C is present only
in the Arabs in Chad [50] and outside Africa in Spain
[53,54].

Finally, it is also interesting to note that haplotype frequencies vary substantially between populations (Additional file 4: Figure S2). For instance, Native American
groups have several haplotypes at high frequencies
(probably due to historical bottlenecks).
Admixture analysis and the mtDNA indigenous legacy in
present-day Argentina

Admixture analysis, as carried out here, considers two
potential source populations: (i) the Native American
component of the available indigenous Argentinean
populations, and (ii) the Native American component of
neighboring countries as a proxy for the Native American component that has been introduced into Argentina
through recent immigration. The model of admixture
(Table 3) indicates that about half of the Native American component in the urban populations most likely
comes from immigration arriving from neighboring
countries, while the rest most likely corresponds with
the indigenous inhabitants living in those regions before
European colonization or arriving from rural Argentinean Native American enclaves. The data is roughly
consistent when executing admixture analysis either
looking at full HVS-I matches (P0) or considering one
or two mutational steps (P1 and P2).
Characterizing the most likely origin of the European
component in present-day Argentina

The models employed here considers only the two main
historical contributors to the European immigration in
Argentina, namely Italy and Spain (representing > 80%

main components of the urban mtDNAs (Native American and European) and the number of haplotypes (h) in the corresponding source populations. Note that
these values can be > 1 because the same haplotype in the source population can count more than once for HS1 and HS2. The amount n indicates sample size.
P0, P1, and P2, are the admixture components referring to sequences that match perfectly, differ by one mutational step, or two, respectively, in the database;
standard deviations are in round brackets.

of immigrants coming from Europe in the last 150 years;
Table 1).
The mathematical admixed model based on hg frequencies indicates that Italy most likely contributed 33%
(95% SD: 9.2) of the European mtDNA hgs to the
Argentinean genome versus 67% (95% SD: 8.1) from
Spain. The admixed model based on haplotype sharing
yielded slightly different but quite consistent results,
roughly indicating that Spain and Italy contributed
almost similarly to the European component in Argentina (Table 3), although there are slight differences
when considering perfect haplotype matches (P0; indicating ~55% contribution from Spain) versus considering
one or two mutational step differences between HVS-I
profiles (P1 and P2, indicating about equal contribution
from Spain and Italy). The haplotype shared between
Argentina and Europe seems to favor the hypothesis
that the Spanish legacy in Argentina is slightly larger
than the one from Italy (Table 3), either when looking
at perfect haplotype matches (HS0) or one (HS1) or two
(HS2) mutational step differences.
AMOVA analysis of Argentinean populations

When applying AMOVA on haplotypes, variance within
populations accounts for ~84% of the total variance
(Table 4) Grouping populations by geographic region or
by Native American versus Admixed populations add little to the proportion of variance among groups (~1;
Table 4); probably indicating that the HVS-I alone does
not provide enough molecular information for the computation of FST based on molecular distances (pairwise
differences). However, when applying AMOVA on haplogroup frequencies, among groups variance, by geography or by admixed vs Native groups, increases
substantially to ~4 and ~6%, respectively. The figures are
however not very high given that about half of the component of the admixed populations is Native American.

Additional file 5: Figure S3A displays population pairwise FST values, indicating that the highest figures occur

Population structure is also reveled when observing that
values of the average number of nucleotide differences

comparisons (Additional file 5: Figure S3B).
Principal component analysis of Argentinean populations

PCA was carried out on hgs frequencies for Argentinean
samples with sizes > 20 (Figure 3). PC1 accounts for
74% of the variation; it clearly separates Mapuches and
Coyas to one side of the plot, from an amalgam of other
population samples in the opposite side; Buenos Aires
and Córdoba occupy an intermediate position. PC2
(13%) is clear at showing an important separation
between the two admixed populations of Buenos Aires
and Córdoba; the rest of the populations are located in
between. The most important feature of PC3 (7%) is
that it separates populations by geographic regions, with
South being more distant from Central and North
(Argentina). It is important to highlight that the merged
groups of admixed and Native American populations
are located very proximal in the plot (Figure 3) in agreement with AMOVA results.
Complete H2a5 genomes

Three entire genomes belonging to the recently
described lineage, H2a5, have been completely
sequenced. One of the entire Argentinean genomes
belongs to the H2a5a1 branch (previously H2a5 [27])
defined by the transition T4592C (Figure 4). This clade
has only been observed in the Basque country where it
is supposed to be autochthonous [27]. The other two
entire H2a5 genomes analyzed from Argentina are
identical and belong to a new branch (defined by a
synonymous transition at position T11233C), H2a5a2.
The only known member belonging to this clade was
observed by Achilli et al. [55]. The geographical location of its donor is unknown although his surnames
(A. Achilli, personal communication) suggest a Galician origin (a region located in the westernmost corner
of the Cantabrian region [6]); one of the main Spanish
source populations to Argentina. The age of H2a5 is
approximately 5.4 thousand years (kya) (95% C.I.:
0-12.9 kya) but the Basque autochthonous sub-clade
H2a5a1 is much younger (~0.6 kys; 95% C.I.: 0.4-0.7
kya).
Finally, there is another entire genome sharing the
same features as H2a5. It does not carry private mutations, lacks transition A1842G and was observed outside
the Iberian Peninsula in the Czech Republic [56].

three, respectively.

Discussion
Admixed Argentineans have an important Native American background. Admixture models indicated that
about half of this Native American component could be
non-autochthonous. The exact figures are only tentative
given a main limitation of the present study, namely, we
did not collect bio-geographic information for most of
the donors of our samples, and this is information was
not available for most of the data collected from the literature; therefore, some donors could be in reality
Native American immigrants (or descents form parents)
from neighboring countries. Given the results of admixture analysis, one could tentatively hypothesize an
important demographic influence coming from neighboring countries that have a predominantly Native
American background and where massive immigrations

to Argentina have come from in recent times (such as
Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia). There are several other
pieces of evidence that would further support this
hypothesis. Firstly, the Native American component in
the urban admixed populations differs very significantly
from the Native American component of the indigenous
populations from North and South Argentina (Figure 1).
A simple process of (recent) admixture of Europeans
with indigenous peoples would tend to keep the same
hg frequencies in admixed and indigenous people, which
is not the case here. Secondly, several diversity indices
are significantly higher in the Native American component of admixed Argentineans than in the indigenous
groups (see above and Table 2). This could be easily
explained if one assumes that the Native American component in the admixed populations has being

Figure 4 Phylogeny of hg H2a5 based on complete genome sequences.

Catelli et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:77

continuously enriched with the arrival of a different
Native American component coming from recent neighboring immigrants together with migrants arriving from
rural Argentinean regions with large Native American
components (from northeast and northwest Argentina).
On the contrary the indigenous groups would tend to
reduce its genetic diversity with time due to drift (smaller effective population size) and isolation from Europeans and other immigrants. The data therefore
indicates that the Native American component observed
in the urban groups only partially mirrors the populations that inhabited the regions in colonial times. An
important proportion of the autochthonous Argentinean
Native American component could have arrived to rural
and urban cities in modern times. For instance, after the
economical crisis suffered in the country in the 1930’s,
waves of people from rural areas with high Native
American component moved to industrialized cities
[7-9].
From the different analyses carried out, the contribution of Spain in the present Argentineans seems to be
slightly higher than that of Italy, although the estimates
vary significantly depending on the admixture model.
The results agree quite well with the historical records
(Table 1). Thus, until 1850 almost all immigrants came
from Spain. From 1850 onwards, thousand of Spaniards
and Italians left their countries with final destiny in
Argentina; but Spaniards were generally more prevalent
than Italians [7-9]. Moreover, ‘Spanish ancestry’ could
have enriched the Argentinean European component
through immigrants coming from neighboring countries,
where Spaniards contributed significantly more than Italians (Uruguay, Chile, etc).
Some caveats should be added concerning admixture
analysis. Computations are based on a meta-analysis by
way of collecting samples that did not necessarily follow
the same sampling criteria. Thus, for instance, samples
from Argentina were collected in different forensic,
anthropological or clinical laboratories, using different
sampling criteria; a meta-analysis could contribute in
the direction of balancing different sampling strategies
or the opposite in case e.g. of some sample being much
larger than others. Moreover, it is well-known from the
census that some regions in some (European/American)
countries contributed more than others to Argentina;
but it is not possible to determine how the different
regions should be represented in the source meta-populations; a reasonable solution seems to merge all the
available data from each country without any a priori
regarding sampling origin or institution involved (as
done in the present study).
Admixture analysis as carried out in the present study
only provides a view of the female historical and contemporary demography (as inferred from the mtDNA);

Page 10 of 13

there are however indications showing that the ancestral
proportions inferred from other markers are different
[19,25], indicating for instance a sex bias in the contribution coming from the different source populations (at
least from Europe).
It is also interesting to note that the genetic diversity
of European lineages in the admixed groups is higher in
the North than in the other regions, independently to
the fact that the proportion of European in higher in
Central Argentina. This is consistent with the historical
documentation indicating that the ‘Camino Real’ to
Potosí (Bolivia) and Lima (Peru) was by far the most
important trade route during colonial times. Thus, Río
de la Plata was the main gate for European immigrants
into Argentina in modern times, but contributing less
mtDNA diversity than the northern ‘Camino Real’.
The impact of the African slave trade on present day
Argentineans seems minimal compared to other South
American locations (e.g., Brazil and Colombia), and
comes most likely from West-central Africa, but also
from Angola and Mozambique (see [30]).

Conclusion
The issue of population stratification in Argentina has
stimulated an intense debate concerning the use of
autosomal markers in forensic casework and paternity
tests. While some hold a position that stratification is an
issue of little interest in forensic databases [57], others
claim a more important role in both forensic and clinical genetics [19,58-61,19,21]. The present study certainly
indicates the existence of a clear-cut sub-structure in
the country; this is shown by the differences observed in
hg distributions, AMOVA analysis, population differentiation tests, statistical hypothesis testing on hg frequencies, and PCA. Population stratification could have
obvious implications in different biomedical applications
in Argentina. This would not only be in forensic genetics (where inter-population haplotype differences can
have important consequences for the weight of the evidence) but also in other population-based studies (e.g.,
case-control studies) dealing with the analysis of the
potential role of mtDNA variants in common diseases,
where false positives are unfortunately higher than desirable [62-64]. By extrapolation, and given the important
ancestral components and regional differences observed
in the mtDNA variation, stratification should also be a
matter of interest when using autosomal SNPs. The forensic field should not ignore forensic stratification in
their routine casework [60,65], especially if one takes
into account that local databases do not exist in Argentina and that most of the forensic casework is carried
out in the largest cities under the risk of using a single
database for cases arriving from any province in the
country.
