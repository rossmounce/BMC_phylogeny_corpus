We describe domain pair exclusion analysis (DPEA), a method for inferring domain interactions
from databases of interacting proteins. DPEA features a log odds score, Eij, reflecting confidence
that domains i and j interact. We analyzed 177,233 potential domain interactions underlying 26,032
protein interactions. In total, 3,005 high-confidence domain interactions were inferred, and were
evaluated using known domain interactions in the Protein Data Bank. DPEA may prove useful in
guiding experiment-based discovery of previously unrecognized domain interactions.

Post-genomic biological discoveries have confirmed that proteins function in extended networks [1,2]. In particular, many
proteins must physically bind to other proteins, either stably
or transiently, to perform their functions. The functions of
proteins are therefore inseparable from their interactions.

High-throughput protein interaction studies and databases of
protein interactions [8-12,20,21] present an opportunity to

information

Protein-protein interactions can be determined experimentally [8-12]. However, the specific domain interactions are
usually not detected, and require further analysis to determine. It is therefore difficult to know which segment of a protein, often just a fraction of its total length, interacts directly
with its biological partners. As most proteins consist of multiple domains [13], the underlying domain interactions are a
largely unknown factor in the majority of known protein-protein interactions. Understanding domain recognition patterns would aid in understanding networks of proteins [14],
and in applications such as predicting the effects of mutations
[15] and alternative splicing events [16] that affect interaction
domains, developing drugs to inhibit pathological protein
interactions [17,18], and designing novel protein interactions
from appropriate domain scaffolds [19].

interactions

For each protein to interact with its appropriate network
neighbors, highly specific recognition events must occur.
Interaction specificity results from the binding of a modular
domain to another domain or smaller peptide motif in the target protein [3]. For example, some cytoskeletal proteins bind
to actin through their modular gelsolin repeat domains [4],
and Src-homology 3 domains (SH3) bind to proline rich peptides that have a PxxP consensus sequence [5]. In the context
of protein interaction, such domains and peptides act as recognition elements; we refer to these simply as 'domains'. Patterns of domain interactions are repeated within organisms
and across taxa, suggesting that recognition patterns are conserved throughout biology [6]. Such patterns constitute a

'protein recognition code' [7], and it may be that many of
these recognition patterns remain to be discovered.

discover domain interaction patterns through statistical analysis of domain co-occurrence in interacting proteins. The idea
is to find pairs of domains that co-occur significantly more
often in interacting protein pairs than in non-interacting
pairs.
However, such bioinformatic discovery of domain interaction
patterns is complicated by the lack of data on which protein
pairs interact and which do not. Previously described [22-25]
work in correlating domain or motif pairs with the interaction
of proteins have analyzed data from genome-scale interaction
assays of a single organism, usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Such exhaustive assays measure which protein pairs
interact, and which do not; rigorous statistical methods to
analyze these datasets have been described [24,25]. These
methods can be extended beyond the scope of single proteomes to infer domain interactions from the incompletely
mapped interactomes of multiple organisms such as those
described in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)
[20,26]. Databases such as DIP are appealing because they
record information from many species (DIP describes 46,000
protein interactions from over 100 organisms). Extensions to
existing computational methods are therefore needed to
incorporate the available wealth of evidence for domain interactions, without being unduly hindered by the limited data
from proteome-wide interaction screens.
Another problem in inferring domain interactions from protein interaction data is that the most probable domain interactions tend to be the most promiscuous, or least specific,
interactions. Previous methods correlated pairs of domains
by their frequency of co-occurrence in interacting protein
pairs [23,27,28], or by their probability of interaction [24].
However, such methods may preferentially identify promiscuous domain interactions because they screen for those that
occur with the highest frequency. For an arbitrary domain i,
many paralogs are typically found within the proteome of an
organism; each may interact with a specific paralog of domain
j. Because of the need for fidelity in cellular circuitry, members of domain families i and j do not interact promiscuously.
In such cases the propensity of interaction between domain
families is expected to be low, as a random member of domain
family i will be unlikely to interact with a random member of
domain family j. Such a domain interaction, while of obvious
biological importance, will be assigned a low score by methods that detect domain interactions by their probability of
interaction. Methods are therefore needed to detect these
low-propensity, high-specificity domain interactions.
We describe a statistical approach called domain pair exclusion analysis (DPEA) (Figure 1) to infer domain interactions
from the incomplete interactomes of multiple organisms.
DPEA extends earlier related methods [23,24,27,28], and
adds a likelihood ratio test to assess the contribution of each
potential domain interaction to the likelihood of a set of
observed protein interactions. DPEA consists of three steps:

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/10/R89

(i) compile protein interaction data and compute Sij the frequency of interaction of each domain pair i and j, relative to
the abundance of domains i and j in the data [23,27,28], (ii)
using Sij as an initial guess, apply the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [29] to obtain a maximum likelihood
estimate of θij, the probability of interaction of each potentially interacting domain pair i and j evaluated in the context
of any other domains occurring in the same proteins as
domains i and j [24], and (iii) exclude all possible interactions
of domains i and j from the mixture of competing hypotheses,
rerun EM, evaluate the change in likelihood, and express this
as a log odds score, Eij, reflecting confidence that domains i
and j interact. A high Eij indicates that there is extensive evidence in protein interaction data supporting the hypothesis
that domains i and j interact; a low Eij suggests that competing
hypotheses (other potential domain interactions) are roughly
as good at explaining the observed protein interactions.
Application of DPEA to a small hypothetical protein interaction network is illustrated in Figure 1.
We show that domain pairs inferred to interact with high E
are significantly enriched among domain pairs known to
interact in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [30,31], demonstrating DPEA's ability to identify physically interacting domain
pairs. DPEA can also infer highly specific domain interactions
by screening for domain pairs with a low θ and high E. Lastly,
we explored DPEA's ability to discover previously unrecognized domain interactions by screening for interactions with
high E involving domains with unknown function. Two examples supported by experimental evidence from the literature,
involving G-protein complexes and Ran signaling complexes,
are presented. These results suggest that DPEA can be used to
mine protein interaction databases for evidence of conserved,
highly specific domain interactions.

Results

In total, 177,233 potential domain interactions were defined
from the July 2004 release of DIP. We used the description of
domain families in the Pfam database of Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) profiles [32]. All DIP proteins were annotated
with Pfam-A and Pfam-B domains (see Materials and methods). Proteins that could not be mapped to at least one Pfam
domain, and any interactions involving such proteins, were
discarded. This resulted in a dataset of 26,032 protein-protein interactions among 11,403 proteins from 68 different
organisms. Our data has 12,455 distinct kinds of Pfam
domains, 79% of which are of unknown function (either
Pfam-B, DUF or UPF domains [32]), yielding 177,233 possible kinds of domain-domain interactions from co-occurrence
of domain pairs in pairs of interacting proteins. The numbers
of proteins and interactions used per organism are given in
Additional data file 1; proteins and their interactions are
given in Additional data files 2 and 3, respectively; protein-todomain mappings are given in Additional data file 4.

information

The interactomes of only three organisms (yeast, fly and
worm) had been probed by genomewide experiments documented in the July 2004 release of DIP [8-11]. Thus the interactomes of most of the organisms documented in DIP are
highly incomplete. Also, DIP does not record negative interactions, which play an important role in statistical methods
for inferring domain interaction propensities [24,25]. To
overcome this limitation, we made the simplifying assump-

tion that any given pair of proteins among those in our study
does not interact unless such an interaction is documented in
DIP. Because all existing protein interactions are obviously
not yet documented in DIP, this assumption is incorrect in
some cases. However, these cases can safely be considered a
small minority: the probability of two random proteins in a
proteome interacting is quite small. For example, in an organism with 6,000 proteins, each with an average of four interacting partners, the probability of interaction for a random
pair of proteins would be around 10-3. Thus in roughly 1 out of
1,000 cases, we incorrectly assume that an unreported interaction is a true negative. In summary, we assumed that: (i)
observed protein interactions are true positives, (ii) unobserved protein interactions are true negatives, and (iii) any

interactions

In analyzing data from 68 organisms we assumed that pairs
of domain families have the same interaction propensity
across all of the organisms in which they are found. This
assumption allowed us to pool multi-species interaction data
for simultaneous analysis.

domain content of each protein is known, and domain interactions are unknown. Any pair of domains that co-occur in a pair of interacting proteins is
considered a potentially interacting domain pair. (b) The frequency of proteins with domain i interacting with proteins with domain j, Sij is computed. (c)
Using Sij as an initial guess, the propensity, θij, of each kind of potential domain interaction is estimated by EM. (d) The evidence, Eij, for each inferred
domain interaction is then assessed by calculating the change in likelihood when a given type of domain interaction is excluded.

The 50 domain pairs with the highest E scores are shown in
Table 1. Table 1 also shows statistics on the average modularity (m) and number of occurrences (n) of each kind of domain
in DIP. In particular, modular domains are of considerable
interest for their role in protein interactions [3]. Assessment
of domain modularity therefore allows distinction of the
interactions of modular domains from the interactions of

DPEA preferentially assigns high E scores to physically interacting domains. This was determined by training DPEA on
the multispecies DIP dataset with all 230 interactions solely
derived from X-ray diffraction experiments removed, and
validating with the set of Pfam-A domains known to directly
interact in experimentally determined structures of protein
complexes in the PDB [30] as defined in the iPfam database
[33]. There was no significant enrichment for PDB complexes
among domain pairs ranked by their S score at any percentile
rank. EM optimization enriches for known structural complexes in the top pairs ranked by θ (a 1.4-fold increase over
random in the top 10%, P value < 0.001), confirming that the
θ is a more accurate measure of domain interaction propensities than S. Ranking by E increased the enrichment of PDBconfirmed complexes further (2.9-fold enrichment in the top
10%, P-value << 0.001) (Figure 2a). PDB complexes were 12
times more abundant among the 2,920 domain pairs inferred
to interact with E scores > 3.0 (P value << 0.001) compared
with random. We also analyzed a yeast-only subset of this
data, and found a significant enrichment of PDB complexes
when ranked by E (2.8-fold enrichment in the top 10%, P
value << 0.001), but no enrichment when domain pairs were
ranked by S or θ. We conclude that the E score output by
DPEA is a better indicator of domain interaction, in both single and multispecies protein interaction datasets, than either
θ or S.

reports

The DPEA algorithm was applied to evaluate the evidence for
each of the 177,233 potential domain interactions. All species
for which we had domain and interaction information in DIP
were analyzed simultaneously. Previous methods [23,27,28]
suggested measures of domain-domain correlation based on
domain pairs' frequency of co-occurrence in interacting protein pairs. We calculated a similar measure here, and called it
Sij, an estimate of the probability of interaction between
domains i and j. From Sij and the domain content of all interacting proteins, we estimated the likelihood of the set of
observed protein interactions (see Materials and methods).
We used the numerical method of EM [29], in a manner similar to [24] to maximize this likelihood and thus refine our
estimate of the probability that domain i interacts with
domain j, which we denote as θij, the propensity of interaction
of domain i with domain j. We then performed a likelihood
ratio test for each kind of domain pair by rerunning EM with
all instances of that potentially interacting pair given a θij of
zero, thus excluding it from the mixture of competing hypotheses. We call this score Eij, a measure of the evidence that
domain i interacts with domain j. In total, 3,005 domain pairs
had E scores >3.0 (Additional data file 5), corresponding to
an approximate 20-fold drop in probability upon exclusion of
all possible instances of the domain interaction from the set
of observed protein interactions. Likelihoods in the E score
were calculated only from positive interactions: negative or
unknown interactions were not considered.

domains that only occur as single-domain proteins (which
DPEA assigns a high E score due to the lack of competing
domain interactions). Of the 3,005 inferred domain interactions with E score >3.0, 1,510 or about 50% involve domains
with m ≥ 2.0. Table 1 suggests that the inferred domain interactions with the highest E score typically occur between
domain families that are present in multiple occurrences in
DIP. In fact, a high Eij correlates with an increase in the minimum number of occurrences of domains i or j (correlation
coefficient = 0.019, P value << 0.001).

Domain pairs are ranked by their E score. For domain i, ni is the number of DIP proteins that contain domain i; mi is the average number of domains in
a protein that contains domain i. Domain pairs known to interact in PDB complexes are marked with an 'x'. Organisms whose protein interaction data

Enrichment of PDB complexes in highest-ranking domain pairs predicted to interact
Enrichment of PDB complexes in highest-ranking domain pairs predicted to interact. Ratio of observed/expected PDB complexes in each sample of domain
pairs is plotted against cumulative rank. For example, the top 100 domain pairs ranked by E have 71-fold more PDB complexes than would be expected in
100 randomly chosen potentially interacting domain pairs in DIP. Potentially interacting domain pairs were ranked by each of three measures: S, θ and E.
(a) Ranking all domain pairs by their frequency of co-occurrence in interacting protein pairs, S, yielded no significant enrichment of PDB complexes at any
rank cutoff. A significant enrichment of PDB complexes was seen when domain pairs were ranked by θ, and even more so ranked by E, as shown by the
successive increase in observed/expected PDB complexes at each cumulative rank. The ratio using all three measures approaches 1.0 as the number of
ranked complexes approaches total number of predictions in the dataset. Our results suggest that the E score output by DPEA performs better than S or
θ at identifying physically interacting domain pairs. (b) Ranking interactions of modular domains by E reveals enrichment of PDB complexes. No
enrichment is found when interactions are ranked by θ or S.

Many of the domains in Table 1 have an average modularity
(m) of around 1.0, suggesting that these domains tend to
occur as the only domain in a protein. To ensure that DPEA
doesn't simply assign high E scores to the interactions of nonmodular domains, we performed the same PDB validation
test on a set of inferred domain interactions from which
inferred domain interactions not involving a modular domain
were excluded. We defined a modularity threshold of mi ≥ 2,
implying that domain i usually occurs in combination with
other domains in the same protein. Validating the filtered set
of domain interactions using the iPfam database of domaindomain interactions in the PDB confirmed that DPEA assigns
high E scores and low S and θ scores to the interactions of
modular domains in DIP (Figure 2b). This trend is even more
pronounced than in Figure 2a; this demonstrates that E is the
parameter of choice for identifying modular domain interactions, and that many high-θ complexes are derived from the
interactions of single-domain proteins.
As a control, we defined sets of known interacting and putative non-interacting domain pairs to test whether DPEA also
assigns high E scores to domain pairs that co-occur in interacting PDB complexes, but which do not directly interact.
iPfam tables were used to define 295 directly interacting
domain pairs and 265 non-interacting domain pairs (see
Materials and methods). While it is impossible to say that our
defined set of non-interacting domain pairs never interact in
nature, it is likely that this set consists of domain pairs not

functionally linked via their interaction. We therefore consider these domain pairs a putative set of negatives.
Direct interaction correlates with a high E score (correlation
coefficient = 0.023, P value << 0.001). No significant
correlation was observed between non-interaction and high E
score (correlation coefficient = 0.0014, P value = 0.56). We
found a significant enrichment of interacting domain pairs
among those with E > 3.0 (3.6-fold relative to random, P
value << 0.001). Non-interacting domain pairs were 1.6-fold
enriched among domain pairs with E > 3.0 relative to randomly ordered domain pairs. The enrichment of the noninteracting set was not significant, however (P value = 0.15).
DPEA therefore assigns high E scores to directly interacting
domain pairs at roughly 2.3 (3.6/1.6) times the rate for noninteracting domain pairs. From these rates we estimate a positive predictive value of 3.6/(3.6 + 1.6) or about 70%. We
therefore conclude that around 70% or approximately 2,100
of our 3,005 high-confidence predictions are probable true
positives and that around 30% or approximately 900 may be
false positives. Of the 1,510 predictions involving modular
domains, we estimate around 1,060 true positives and around
450 false positives.
We found that inferred domain interactions with high E
scores are likely to be derived from multiple observed protein
interactions. Of the 177,233 potentially interacting domain
pairs in DIP, 88% derive evidence from only a single protein

To assess the ability of DPEA to identify novel domain interactions, we analyzed inferred domain interactions that
involve at least one Pfam domain of uncharacterized function.
The Pfam 14.0 database contains 7,459 curated, manually
annotated 'Pfam-A' domains, and 107,460 automatically generated, unannotated 'Pfam-B' domains. Because Pfam-B
domains are automatically generated, and are not manually
annotated, they are considered of lower information content
than Pfam-A domains. In addition to Pfam-B domains, 1,503
domains in the Pfam 14.0 release begin with the prefix 'DUF'
or 'UPF', signifying domains of uncharacterized function.
Thus, about 95% of the domains in the combined Pfam-A and
-B databases are of uncharacterized function. Many of these
domains probably participate in protein-protein interactions.
Of the potentially interacting domain pairs we analyzed in
DIP, 1,294 involve at least one Pfam-B, DUF or UPF domain
and have E scores greater than the significance threshold of
3.0. Because PDB complexes, when available, provide an
unambiguous validation of domain interactions, we again

We find that highly specific domain interactions can be
detected by screening for low θ and high E. Of the 3,005 highconfidence domain interactions (those with E > 3.0) we predict the 10% with highest θ to be promiscuous interactions;
these have θ > 0.67. We predict the 10% with lowest θ to be
specific; these have θ < 0.033. Table 1 shows several examples
of inferred domain interactions with high E and low θ. For
example, the known interaction of the modular RING ubiquitin ligase domains [Pfam:PF00097, zf-C3HC4] with
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes [Pfam:PF00179, UQ_con]
[34] has a θ well below median (θ = 0.011, bottom 2% of highconfidence interactions), but has the eighth-highest E score of
all potentially interacting domains in DIP (E = 29, Table 1). As
another
example,
Cyclin
N-terminal
domains
[Pfam:PF00134, Cyclin_N] are known from structural studies [PDB:1QMZ] [35] to interact with protein kinase domains
[Pfam:PF00069, Pkinase]. This interaction has a θ of 0.006
(in the bottom 1% of high-confidence interactions) and an E
score of 23 (13th highest, Table 1). For both zf-C3HC4 ↔
UQ_con and Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interactions, members of
these families are expected to interact specifically to maintain
fidelity of intra- and extracellular signaling. Thus our results
are consistent with biological intuition. These biologically
important domain interactions would not have been detected
by screening for high θ, as the θ for these interactions are well
below the average values for all potentially interacting
domains. We therefore conclude that DPEA detects highly
specific domain interactions, by high E and low θ, that are lost
when domain-domain correlations are expressed as
probabilities.

reports

The evidence measure, E, detects specific domain interactions that are not detected by screening for the most probable
domain interactions [23,24,27,28]. We consider θij roughly
equivalent to the probability of interaction of domains i and j.
If many members of domain family i interact non-specifically
with many members of domain family j, we would expect a
high θij, and these interactions should be easily detected by
screening for those with the highest θ. On the other hand, if
members of family i interact only with specific members of
family j, we would expect a low θij (Figure 3a). Methods that
screen for the most probable domain interactions therefore
fail to detect highly specific domain interactions.

A potential problem in using low θ and high E to identify specific domain interactions may arise from high false negative
rates of interaction datasets. Von Mering et al. estimated that
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of known interactions may be only a third of the number of true interactions
[36]. We define specificity using non-interactions; however
some of these may be false negatives. To assess how false negatives might affect our inference of specific domain interactions, we ran DPEA on a yeast-only DIP dataset (Additional
data file 6), and an 'augmented' yeast dataset with randomly
assigned additional interactions between proteins with
Cyclin_N domains and proteins with Pkinase domains (Additional data file 7). Using the estimate of von Mering et al. as a
guideline, we augmented the number of interactions between
these two classes of proteins from 26 up to 78, thus tripling
the number of potential Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interactions.
We then ran DPEA on the unmodified yeast set and the augmented yeast set to estimate θ and E for the Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interaction. This resulted in an increase from θ = 0.015
(bottom 9%) in the augmented set up from θ = 0.008 (bottom
4%) in the unmodified yeast set. This suggests that, while
adding missing interactions may increase θ for some domain
interactions, for the Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interaction, θ
remains low. E increased from 18 in the yeast reference set to
34 in the augmented set, implying that our confidence in the
Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase domain interaction would be increased
by additional evidence in the form of as-yet unknown protein
interactions. Additionally, 22 of 26 (85%) of the DIP interactions between proteins with these two kinds of domains have
been reported in small-scale experiments, suggesting that
yeast cyclins and the kinases they interact with have been relatively well-studied by experiment, and that the fraction of
unknown interactions among this group of proteins may be
somewhat less than for less-studied proteins. We conclude
that DPEA can identify specific domain interactions even in
the case of incompletely probed interactomes.

interaction. The other 12% are inferred from multiple protein
interactions. A high E score correlated with a domain interaction being derived from multiple (at least two) protein interactions (correlation coefficient = 0.057, P value << 0.001). In
fact, 100% of domain interactions with E > 7.0 were derived
from multiple observations (P value << 0.001). Thus, E
scores tend to increase with the amount of evidence supporting a given domain interaction.

DPEA detects high-specificity domain interactions
DPEA detects high-specificity domain interactions. (a) Interactions between domain families, such as the hypothetical red and blue domain families, whose
members interact specifically are expected to have a low propensity, θ, because the number of interactions occurring between the domain families is a
small fraction of the possible interactions (four out of 16 for two domain families of four members each). Conversely, domain interactions with a high θ
will typically be between families whose members interact promiscuously. Because high-specificity domain interactions are of obvious interest to biologists,
screening for domain interactions by their θ values fails to detect many important domain interactions. (b) Specific interactions of RING ubiquitin ligase
domains [Pfam:PF00097, zf-C3HC4] with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes [Pfam:PF00179, UQ_con] [32] in a fly protein network. The inferred domain
interaction has a low θ (θ = 0.011, bottom 10%) and high E (E = 29, Table 1). This reflects the abundant evidence that the domains zf-C3HC4 and UQ_con
interact, despite the low probability of interaction between any pair of these domains. (c) Specific interactions of Cyclin N-terminal domains
[Pfam:PF00134, Cyclin_N] and protein kinase domains [Pfam:PF00069, Pkinase]. This interaction has a θ of 0.006, which is in the bottom 6% of θ for all
domain pairs, suggesting the low propensity of interaction among members of these two domain families. However, the E score of 23 (the 13th highest
score in the database) reveals the high degree of evidence for the Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interaction. These results show that DPEA identifies high-specificity
domain interactions not detected by screening for the most probable domain interactions.

co-occurrence was found, the structures were individually
inspected to identify the physically interacting protein
regions. Where domains were found to interact physically,
the published biochemical literature was searched further to
verify the biological significance of the domain interaction.

DPEA identified domain interactions important for the
assembly of G-protein βγ complexes. DIP describes the interactions of G-γ and G-β subunits in human, mouse and yeast
(Figure 4a). G-γ proteins belong to the G-gamma domain
family [Pfam:PF00631]. The G-β proteins in DIP consist
mainly of WD40 domains [Pfam:PF00400] with varying
Pfam-B domains as their N-terminal segments
[Pfam:PB002804, PB092195, PB017462]. The possible Pfam

Because DPEA detects only the domain interactions best supported by multiple observed protein interactions, we expect
low sensitivity and high specificity in our predictions. DPEA's
sensitivity may be impaired by the high rate of false negatives
in existing interaction datasets, particularly in those organisms that have not been probed by high-throughput methods.
Indeed, using the defined set of known positive and putative
negative domain interactions in the PDB, we obtain a sensitivity of 6%. However, the specificity of 97% in the same test
underscores the stringency of the E score. A more informative
measure of DPEA's accuracy may be its positive predictive
value of 70%, implying that roughly 2/3 of the high-confi-

deposited research

However, the current implementation of DPEA probably has
some robustness to experimental error. We demonstrated
that our estimates of θ and E would be minimally perturbed,
even if the known number of protein interactions potentially
occurring through the interaction of the Cyclin_N and Pkinase domains is one third the true number. DPEA may also be
resilient to false positive protein interactions. False positive
protein interaction data probably result from experimental
artifacts, not from biologically relevant domain-domain or
domain-peptide interactions. False positives will therefore
tend to occur among random pairs of proteins whose constituent domains do not normally interact. High E scores for
inferred domain interactions depend on evidence from multiple observed protein interactions. Assuming that false positives occur randomly, it is unlikely that several instances of a
protein with domain i interacting with a protein with domain
j would result from false positives. Obtaining the multiple
observations required for a high E score of erroneously
inferred interacting domains will therefore be unlikely to
occur by random experimental error.

reports

A future implementation of DPEA could aim to characterize
rigorously the false positive and negative rates inherent in
protein interaction data. In particular, the data in DIP could
be used to model a coverage probability, that is, the probability that an existing protein interaction is reported, across
organisms. A false positive rate that differs across experimental methods could also be modeled. Modeling error rates in
protein interaction data is of clear importance for the purpose
of inferring domain interactions [24,25]. Given the computational burden posed by modeling experimental error, we
chose to carry out a simpler investigation to assess the
information content in DIP, and its potential for inferring
domain interactions.

reviews

DPEA is also able to identify domain interactions important
for the association of Ran signaling proteins with Ran-binding proteins. Ran proteins are members of the Ras family of
GTPases [Pfam:PF00071] [41], are conserved in eukaryotes,
and are important for protein transport in and out of nuclei
[42]. DIP documents the interactions of yeast and worm Ran
homologs with several proteins that contain a Ran-binding
domain [Pfam:PF00638, Ran_BP1] (Figure 5a). The
potential domain interactions underlying these protein interactions are listed in Table 3. Because of the heterogeneous
domain composition of proteins that contain Ran_BP1
domains, many domain interactions are possible in this subnetwork of proteins. From among these possibilities, DPEA
only detects significant evidence for the interaction of a PfamB domain [Pfam:PB001470] with the Ran_BP1 domain (E =
3.6, Figure 5b). PB001470 is unique to the Ran subfamily of
Ras homologs, and is found C-terminal to the conserved Ras
GTPase domain. The Ran_BP1 domain is typically found in
multidomain nuclear pore complex components. The structure of human Ran complexed with the Ran-binding domain
of the nuclear pore protein RanBP2 [PDB:1RRP] [43] provides unambiguous structural evidence that PB001470 interacts directly with Ran_BP1 (Figure 5c). Additional evidence
for this domain interaction comes from biochemical studies
showing that deletion of Ran C-terminal residues abolishes
the interaction of Ran with RanBP1, a Ran effector that is
homologous to the Ran-binding domain [Pfam:Ran_BP1] of
RanBP2 [44]. The evidence used to infer the PB001470 ↔
Ran_BP1 interaction comes from yeast and worm protein
interactions, whereas the structural and biochemical confir-

domain interactions in these βγ complexes are shown in Table
2. Of these, only the interaction of G-gamma and PB002804
(E = 12) is predicted with high confidence to occur in the analyzed βγ complexes (Figure 4b). This is the highest propensity
domain interaction (θ = 0.83) of the 177,233 potential domain
interactions defined in DIP. To confirm that G-gamma and
PB002804 do interact, we looked for co-occurrence of these
domains in PDB complexes, and found that these domains
interact in the bovine G-αβγ complex [PDB:1GP2] [37] (Figure 4c). Additionally, the G-gamma ↔ PB002804 domain
interaction is supported by experimental studies demonstrating that the N-terminal peptides of G-β proteins are essential
for their interactions with G-γ proteins [38,39], and that
mutations or deletions in these regions abolish the formation
of βγ complexes. The structure of the bovine complex shows
that the WD40 domains also contact the G-gamma domains;
our method does not detect this domain interaction, probably
because of the large number of proteins that contain WD40
domains but do not interact with G-γ proteins. The high θ of
this domain interaction suggests that G-β and G-γ subunits
that have these domains may interact promiscuously; indeed,
cross-reactivity of G-β and G-γ proteins has been demonstrated [40]. We conclude that DPEA identified a domain
interaction, involving an uncharacterized domain, important
for the association of G-β and G-γ proteins.

dence domain interactions inferred by DPEA are true positives; the remaining 1/3 are likely false positives. As
interaction datasets become more complete, we expect the
performance of DPEA to improve accordingly.
DPEA can be used to find domain interactions among families whose members interact highly specifically by screening
for interactions with a low θ and a high E. This is in contrast
to previously explored measures of domain-domain correlation, which were based on domains' inferred probability of
interaction [23,24,27,28], and which are most likely to

reward promiscuous, or low-specificity interactions (Figure
3a). Specificity is imperative for maintaining the fidelity of
cellular signaling pathways in networks containing homologous interaction domains [45], and thus is of clear biological
importance. DPEA is thus an extension of previous measures
of domain-domain correlation in identifying highly specific
domain interactions.
Our analysis of recurring domain interaction preferences in
the multi-species data in the Database of Interacting Proteins
suggests conserved patterns of domain interaction [6]. We

In a network of interacting G-γ and G-β proteins, the interaction of domains G-gamma [Pfam:PF00631] and a Pfam-B domain found at the Nterminus of some G-β proteins [Pfam:PB002804] is the only domain interaction out of several possibilities with an E score > 3.0. This inferred
domain interaction is consistent with structural [37] and biochemical [38,39] evidence that the G-β N-terminal region corresponding to PB002804 is
important for the formation of G-βγ complexes, and with the observation that many other proteins with WD40 domains do not interact with
proteins of the G-gamma domain family (data not shown). Apparently DPEA identifies domain interactions in G-βγ complexes.

Several domain interactions are possible in the interactions of yeast and worm Ran signal-transducing proteins with some Ran-binding proteins. Of
these possible domain interactions, DPEA predicts the interaction (E = 3.6) of a Pfam-B domain [Pfam:PB001470] found at the C-termini of Ran
homologs but not in other Ras family members [Pfam:PF00071] with Ran-binding domains [Pfam:PF00638, Ran_BP1]. Structural [43] and biochemical
[44] studies confirm this interaction. We conclude that DPEA identified, from among several possibilities, an important domain interaction for the
interaction of Ran homologs with a subset of Ran-binding proteins.

have presented a method for extracting evidence of phylogenetically conserved domain interaction preferences from the
incompletely mapped interactomes of multiple organisms,
thus adding value to these datasets. Further high-throughput
interaction studies and continued mining of the literature for
protein interactions should continue to identify previously
unrecognized domain interactions.

Materials and methods
Defining domains and their interactions
The July 2004 DIP full multispecies dataset was used. The
DIP database represents protein interaction networks as a
graph structure: proteins are nodes, and interactions between
proteins are edges connecting the nodes (DIP proteins and
their interactions are in Additional data files 2 and 3, respectively). For the 68 organisms we analyzed in DIP, a protein
interaction network was defined consisting of all of each
organism's proteins known to participate in an interaction
with another protein also in that same organism, and the
interactions between them. For simplicity, we did not include
the 396 cross-species interactions in DIP.
For each organism, τ, that organism's observed network of
interactions is defined as:

r
 1 if an interaction between proteins x and y is reported in DIP
Oτ ,y = 
x
 0 otherwise

If we do not have experimental information demonstrating
that two proteins interact, we assume that they do not interact. Therefore, for all taxa, τ, the interaction network is
assumed to be incomplete: many biologically relevant interactions are surely unknown, and unreported in DIP. For simplicity in incorporating protein interaction data from
multiple species, a pair of proteins is defined as potentially
interacting if the proteins belong to the same organism. Thus,

Oτ ,y is only defined when proteins x and y both belong to
x
organism τ. All proteins x belong to one and only one organism, τ.
We then define the domains of each DIP protein (Additional
data file 4). Pfam-A and -B domains were defined on DIP
sequences in two ways. First, the DIP protein's SwissProt
accession number, if available, was mapped to the domain
annotations in the Pfam 14.0 version of the swisspfam file
[46]. Second, DIP protein sequences were mapped to SwissProt [47] sequences using a BLAST search [48] with an Evalue threshold of 10-4. Then, if an aligned segment of a
SwissProt protein completely encompassed a Pfam domain as
defined in the swisspfam file, the domain annotation was

α and β are pseudocounts of arbitrary value, which in the
present work were set to 1. The effect of the pseudocounts is
to prevent θij from being exactly zero or one in the case of few
instances of domains i and j in the data. Extremely high or low
θij can therefore arise only from large numbers of observations pertaining to the potential interaction of domains i and
j.

interactions

We augment our observed data (protein-protein interactions
and the domains on the proteins) with missing data (the
unobserved domain-domain interactions) to obtain what is
known in EM as the 'complete data'. To do this we iterate over
all observed interacting protein pairs x,y in all organisms, and
define all potential domain interactions underlying each
observed protein interaction. The hidden domain interactions are represented in a data structure, C:

refereed research

We first obtain an estimate of θij, the multi-species probability of domains i and j interacting, that maximizes the likelihood of the observed protein interaction data. In our model,
a given θij is the same for all species. This simplifies our computation, although it may not always be correct, as different
organisms may use a given domain interaction to different
extents.

EM [29] is a numerical method for obtaining a maximumlikelihood estimate of some parameters of a model given
incomplete data. The application of EM to inferring domain
interactions from yeast two-hybrid protein interaction data
has been explored previously by Deng et al. [24]. Here we
extend the use of EM for estimating probabilities of each kind
of potential domain interaction as a starting point for our
analysis of the change in likelihood of a set of observed protein interactions, when a potential underlying domain interaction is excluded from the model.

In our model, we use the indices i and j to indicate domains
and the indices x and y to indicate proteins. We define D(x) as
an unordered collection of one or more domains on protein x.
We do not consider multiple instances of a kind of domain on
a protein, as in the case of WD40 domains; such a domain is
only present once per protein in our model. Domains i and j
are defined as potentially interacting if there exists at least
one pair of interacting proteins x and y such that i ∈ D(x) and
j ∈ D(y).

allowed to overlap. By these two methods of domain mapping, 74% of amino acids in DIP proteins were assigned to an
interval corresponding to a Pfam domain. The remaining 26%
of amino acids remained unannotated, even though it is possible that some of these amino acids contain protein interaction sites.

4. Repeat until the likelihood, given by equation (1) no longer
increases appreciably. 100 iterations of EM increased the loglikelihood function from -3.6 × 106 to -6.8 × 105, showing the
improved fit of our model to the data given the optimized values of θ.
In summary, the observed protein interactions in DIP are
held constant while the unobserved domain interactions are
allowed to vary so as to maximize the likelihood of the
observations, given in equation (1). This gives us θ, a matrix
of probabilities of domain interactions.

Computing E scores
A measure of the evidence that domain i interacts with
domain j is given by:
Eij =

∑ ∑

τ x ,y:
i∈D( x )
j∈D( y )

log

actions of domains i and j are excluded (given a probability of
0), and which allows us to compute the denominator in (3).

Eij =

3. Use the expected values of Mij, and Nij to re-estimate all θij:

θˆij =

Pr(Oτ ,y = 1 i, j can interact)
x
Pr(Oτ ,y = 1 i, j do not interact)

(2)

The numerator in the ratio in (2) is the probability that proteins m and n interact given that domains i and j might interact. The denominator is the probability that proteins m and n
interact given that domains i and j do not interact. Eij is
therefore a measure of the evidence that domains i and j ever
interact.
To calculate Eij, we first compute the numerator in (3) using
the maximum likelihood estimate of θ from EM. Then, to
ij

compute the denominator, we define θ , a new matrix of
domain interaction probabilities with the same dimensions as
θ, representing the same set of potential domain interactions.
However, in θ ij , we set the probability of domains i and j
ij
interacting ( θ ij ) to 0, then holding it at 0, rerun EM to allow

competing domain interactions to maximize the likelihood of
the observations in O, under the model that domains i and j
do not interact. This yields a maximum likelihood estimate of
all possible domain interactions, in which all potential inter-

1 − ∏ k∈D( x),l∈D( y ) ( 1 − θ kl )

(

1 − ∏ k∈D( x),l∈D( y ) 1 − θ kl

)

(3)

The log of the resulting ratio is then summed across all organisms τ and all observed interacting protein pairs x and y
potentially interacting through the domains i and j. If i and j
are the only domains in proteins x and y, respectively, then
the denominator is set to ρ, the background probability of any
two proteins interacting, to prevent zero-division errors. ρ
was set to 0.001 in this study.
An important feature of the E score is that more instances of
domains i and j potentially interacting results in a higher Eij,
consistent with the intuition that more observations of a kind
of potential domain-domain interaction should increase the
confidence in that interaction. Also, even for cases of low θij, a
high Eij can result if θij is nonetheless high relative to competij
ing θ kl .

The E score is calculated using only information on recorded
interactions, hence it is not exactly equivalent to a standard
likelihood ratio test, which would also consider unobserved
interactions. The rationale behind this decision is that we do
not wish to give excessive weight to negative interactions, as
they are not documented in DIP. The E score instead aims to
explain observed protein interactions in terms of the relative
contributions of domain interactions to the likelihood of the
observations.

Validating inferred domain interactions
We confirmed inferred domain interactions using examples
of interacting Pfam-A domains in the iPfam database [33].
Because we are validating domain interactions inferred from
inter-chain protein interactions, only domain interactions
that occur between chains in iPfam were used; domain interactions that only occur within chains were excluded.
To validate inferred domain interactions we first defined a
DIP training set with the 230 protein interactions derived
solely from X-ray diffraction experiments removed. We ran
DPEA on this training set to analyze the evidence for 176,621
potentially interacting domain pairs. Mappings of Pfam-A
domains to PDB structures, and the interactions of Pfam-A
domains, were derived directly from the iPfam database
tables. Potentially interacting domain pairs were ranked by
three measures: S, θ and E. At various rank cutoffs the
number of domain pairs known to interact in a protein complex in the PDB was counted. If a potentially interacting
domain pair was found to interact in the PDB, it was considered a positive result. Because structural studies have

We mapped DIP proteins to both Pfam-A and -B domains, the
latter of which are often short peptide motifs rather than
proper domains in the classical sense. Therefore, some
domains that occur as single-domain proteins, such as IL8
[Pfam:PF00048] [49,50] and Ras [Pfam:PF00071] [41] have
a mi > 1.0, due to short Pfam-B domains occurring on the
same protein as Pfam-A domains.

Hypothetical protein network
We arbitrarily defined a hypothetical protein interaction network of appropriate format to analyze by DPEA (Additional
data file 8). Possible domains were defined as a list of colors:
red, violet, blue, azure, green, yellow, and orange. Proteins
were initially defined as objects containing at least one
domain. Proteins were then arbitrarily linked subject to the
constraint that any interacting pair of proteins must contain
a red domain in one protein and a blue domain in the other.
We thus defined red ↔ blue as the underlying domain interaction in the network. This process was repeated for three
organisms, arbitrarily chosen to be yeast, worm and human,
with 5, 4 and 3 hypothetical proteins defined for each organism, respectively. DPEA was then applied to compute S, θ and
E for all possible domain interactions in the network. Of these
three scores, only E unambiguously identifies red ↔ blue as
the underlying domain interaction in the hypothetical network (Figure 1).

Augmenting yeast Cyclin_N ↔ Pkinase interactions
Our DIP dataset contains 11,593 interactions of yeast proteins. Of these, 26 are between proteins with Cyclin_N
domains [Pfam:PF00134] and proteins with Pkinase
domains [Pfam:PF00069]. To increase the number of interactions between these two classes of proteins by a factor of 3,
we picked random pairs of proteins consisting of one member
of each class and assigned an interaction if the interaction was

Using a prediction threshold of E > 3.0 we defined interacting
and putative non-interacting sets contain 18 true positives
(TP), 7 false positives (FP), 258 true negatives (TN), and 277
false negatives (FN). Sensitivity and specificity of our predictions are calculated as follows: sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN);
specificity = TN/(TN + FP). Positive predictive value is TP/
(TP + FP) and can also be estimated from the relative enrichments of interacting and non-interacting domains in high-

Domains typically occur in proteins in combinations with
other domains. Many modular domains are known to have a
role in protein interactions [3]. It is therefore of interest to
know which inferred interacting domains are modular, and
which tend to occur as the only domain in a protein. To quantify the modularity of domain i, we calculated mi, the average
number of domains occurring in proteins that contain
domain i:

refereed research

To define sets of known interacting and putative non-interacting domain pairs, we used the iPfam [33] tables to extract
domain pairs that occur on separate chains in the same PDB
complex. We excluded cases of two instances of the same
domain interacting, and domain pairs that always occur as
the only two domains in a PDB structure. We then separated
the resulting domain pairs into two groups: those defined as
interacting in the iPfam table int_pfamAs, and those not
defined as interacting. This yielded a set of 295 known interacting and a set of 265 putative non-interacting domain pairs.
Although the absence of an observed interaction between any
pair of putative non-interacting domains does not mean that
they never interact in nature, we assume that this set contains
primarily domain pairs which do not interact.

Defining domain modularity

deposited research

To define a set of modular domain interactions, we filtered
the set of domain interactions derived from DPEA of the DIP
dataset with X-ray diffraction data to exclude any domain
pair in which neither domain had m ≥ 2. Thus, all domain
pairs involved at least one modular domain. In total, 13% of
the domains in DIP have m < 2.0 and the 2,157 interactions
among any two of these domains were excluded. In all, the filtered set of inferred domain interactions included 174,464
domain pairs.

The same binomial significance test described above was used
to assess enrichment of non-interacting domain pairs with
high E scores.

comment

sampled only a small fraction of biologically occurring
domain interactions, the lack of a domain interaction in the
PDB by itself cannot be taken to mean that a domain pair does
not interact. Nevertheless, a reasonable domain-domain
scoring strategy should include more structural interacting
pairs in the highest ranked predictions than expected at random. Of the potentially interacting domain pairs in DIP, 0.4%
also interacted in the PDB. Thus if, at a given rank cutoff, significantly more than 0.4% of the domain pairs interacted in
the PDB, the method should be enriching for physically interacting domain pairs.
