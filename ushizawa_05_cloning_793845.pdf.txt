Abstract
Background: Prolactin-related proteins (PRPs) are specific proteins of the growth hormone/
prolactin (GH/PRL) family in bovine placenta. This study reports the identification and sequencing
of a full-length cDNA for two new members of bovine PRPs, bPRP-VIII and -IX, and their
localization and quantitative expression in bovine placenta.
Methods: New bPRP-VIII and -IX were identified from bovine placentome. Localization and
quantitative gene expression in the placenta were respectively investigated by in situ hybridization
and real-time RT-PCR methods. Recombinant proteins of these genes were produced by a
mammalian HEK293 cell expression system.
Results: Full-length bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA were respectively cloned with 909 and 910
nucleotide open-reading-frames corresponding to proteins of 236 and 238 amino acids. The
predicted bPRP-VIII amino acid sequence shared about 40 to 70% homology with other bPRPs, and
bPRP-IX had about 50 to 80 % homology of others. The two new bPRPs were detected only in the
placenta by RT-PCR. mRNA was primarily expressed in the cotyledon and intercotyledonary
tissues throughout gestation. An in situ hybridization analysis revealed the presence of bPRP-VIII
and -IX mRNA in the trophoblastic binucleate and/or trinucleate cells. bPRP-VIII mRNA was
observed in the extra-embryonic membrane on Day 27 of gestation, however, no bPRP-IX mRNA
was observed in the extra-embryonic membrane in the same stage of pregnancy by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR analysis. Both new bPRP genes were possible to translate a mature protein in a
mammalian cell expression system with approximately 28 kDa in bPRP-VIII and 38 kDa in bPRP-IX.
Conclusion: We identified the new members of bovine prolactin-related protein, bPRP-VIII and IX. Localization and quantitative expression were confirmed in bovine placenta by in situ
hybridization or real-time PCR. Their different temporal and spatial expressions suggest a different
role for these genes in bovine placenta during gestation.

Background
Prolactin-related proteins (PRPs) are members of the
growth hormone/prolactin (GH/PRL) family [1]. PRPs are
highly expressed in binucleate cells of bovine trophoblasts, although their function is still obscure. No new
member had been identified between early 1990 and this
year [2]. We recently found a new PRP member through a
comprehensive analysis using a bovine utero-placental
cDNA microarray [3]. Seven bovine PRP (bPRP) genes
have been identified in placentomal tissues, whereas only
two of those genes have been shown to be translated. The
expression pattern of these genes is spatially and temporally different. bPRP-I indicates the considerable importance of regulation of implantation and formation of the
placentome in bovines [4,5]. However, bPRP-VII was
expressed in intercotyledon and cotyledon with rather
weak compare to those of bPRP-I during the gestation [6].
Placental lactogens (PLs) are known as classical members
and PRPs are categorized as the non-classical members of
the GH/PRL family in bovine [7]. Various non-classical
members are common in rodents, such as mice and rats,
and some of them exhibit known biological functions,
such as proliferin and prolactin-like protein-A (PLP-A) [712]. However, as a whole the biological function of Prolactin-related genes is still not known in various species
including bovine. Two research groups identified bovine
PRPs mRNA individually; bPRP-I to -III were identified by
the Schuler group [13,14], and bPRP-IV to -VI were identified by the Nakashima group [15-17]. We recently identified another one named as bPRP-VII [6]. Our previous
study suggested our bovine placental cDNA library contained other bPRP genes [3]. We reveal here the full-length
sequences of two new members of bPRPs, bPRP-VIII and IX, and their localization and quantitative expression. We
confirmed the possibility of translation of them and the
accuracy of these gene sequences to produce a recombinant protein using the HEK293 cell-transfecting system.

Materials and methods
Animals and tissues
Placental tissues for cDNA cloning and mRNA expression
were collected from Japanese Black cows. The extraembryonic tissues, placenta, and endometrium were collected at a local slaughterhouse on days 27 to 28, 56 to 64,
144 to 149, and 245 to 258 after artificial insemination
(day 1). The tissues were separated into four portions: the
cotyledon (COT); intercotyledon (the area between the
cotyledonary villous (ICOT)); the caruncle area, including
the maternal placentomal septa in the endometrium
(CAR); and the intercaruncle area (ICAR). It was difficult
to divide the COT and ICOT on days 27 to 28, and thus
the COT contained very few villi. Tissues from two different cows on day 27 and one cow on day 28 of gestation (n
= 3) were used as Day 27 extra-embryonic membrane

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/68

(Day 27EEM), Day 27 caruncle (Day 27CAR), and Day 27
intercaruncular endometrium (Day 27ICAR). Placentomal tissues were collected on days 56, 58, and 64 (in
total, n = 3) and designated as Day 60COT, CAR, ICOT,
and ICAR. Sample materials from days 144, 148, and 149
(n = 3) and days 245 (two samples) and 252 (one sample)
were marked as Day 150COT, CAR, ICOT, ICAR, Day
250COT, CAR, ICOT, and ICAR. The cotyledonary and
caruncular part was separated mechanically, and each part
may contained a counter part of tissue. The collected samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. The placentomes of day 60 were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde PBS
at pH 7.4 and then embedded in paraffin wax and stored
at 4°C until in situ hybridization. All procedures for these
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with
the guidelines and ethics approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences for the use of animals.
Cloning of full-length bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA
The new full-length bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA were isolated
from bovine cotyledonary tissue by the 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. In brief, a complete
RNA was isolated from a bovine placentome on day 60 of
gestation using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan).
We performed 3'-RACE using a 3'-full RACE core set
(Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with bPRP-VIII-specific forward
primer (5'-CCACAGTCAACAGGAGTCCTCA-3') and
bPRP-IX-specific forward primer (5'-CCAACAGAGAGTCCTCACCCTGCGA-3'). The bPRP-VIII and -IX primer was
designed from bovine EST accession number AW464912
and BP108069, respectively. The 3'-RACE products were
sequenced using an ABI Prism 370 automatic sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after cloning
into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignments of deduced protein sequences were performed
with the multiple alignment software Clustal W 1.83 on
the DDBJ web site. Clustal W was also employed to calculate trees using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [18].
TreeView was used to display the phylogenetic tree [19].
The values represent bootstrap scores for 1,000 trials, indicating the credibility of each branch. Except the bPRP-VIII
and -IX sequences, all the bPRPs and bPLs protein
sequences were obtained from GenBank. Their GenBank
accession numbers are: bPRP-I (J02944), bPRP-II
(M27239), bPRP-III (M27240), bPRP-IV (M33269),
bPRP-V (AB239755), bPRP-VI (X59504), bPRP-VII
(AB187564), bPL-Ala (J02840), and bPL-Val (M33268).
Three-dimensional structure prediction by FAMS
We predicted the three-dimensional (3D) structure of
bPRP-VIII and -IX by using the FAMS (Fully automated
homology modeling system; http://www.pharm.kitasato-

u.ac.jp/fams/index.html) [20]. FAMS is the software
which predicts 3D model of the target protein from the
structural known protein of high homology. In case of
bPRP-VIII and -IX, the 3D structure was constructed based
on the human prolactin (hPRL) 3D structure (Protein
Data Bank ID: 1N9D) in the element. FAMS program only
requires an amino acids sequence as input, and constructs
3D model structures automatically. Visualization of the
3D structure was performed using the RasMol 2.7.3 software http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/ras
mol/[21].
RT-PCR
Tissue distribution of bPRP-VIII and -IX expression was
studied by RT-PCR. Bovine GAPDH was used as a positive
control for the PCR. Details of the RT-PCR method were
described in previous reports [6,22]. The total RNA in a
total reaction mixture was used for reverse transcription
and template cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primer and
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) at 42°C for 50 min. Each PCR contained the
cDNA template, primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphate
mixture (dNTP), MgCl2, 10 × PCR buffer II, autoclaved
milliQ water, and AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions included
denaturation at 95°C for 30 sec and extension at 72°C for
1 min. Twenty-seven cycles were performed for all samples. The annealing temperature was set at 60°C for 30
sec. A single denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min before
the first PCR cycle and a final extension step at 72°C for
10 min after the last PCR cycle were also performed. The
PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The
primers encoding for the bPRP-VIII and -IX sequences
were designed using the sequence illustrated in Fig. 1. The
primer sequence was selected to include a mismatch for
other bPRPs. The designated primers are listed in Table 1.
All the primers were commercially synthesized (Espec
Oligo Service, Tsukuba, Japan).
In situ hybridization
Full-length cDNA of bPRP-VIII and -IX was used as a template for hybridization probe synthesis. Digoxigenin
(DIG)-labeled antisense and sense-complementary RNA

probes were prepared as described in previous studies
[6,23]. The placentomes were sectioned into 7 µm-thick
sections for hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using automated Ventana HX System Discovery
with a RiboMapKit and BlueMapKit (Ventana, Tucson,
AZ, USA) [6]. Briefly, sections were hybridized with DIGlabeled probes in RiboHybe (Ventana) hybridization
solution at 65°C for 6 hours. The sections were washed
three times in RiboWash (Ventana) (65°C, 6 min) after
hybridization and were fixed in RiboFix (Ventana) (37°C,
10 min). The hybridization signals were then detected
with monoclonal-anti-digoxin biotin conjugate (Sigma,
Saint Louis, MI, USA). The hybridized glasses were
observed after preparation with a Nikon ECLIPSE E800
photomicroscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Real-time RT-PCR
Gene expression of bPRP-VIII and -IX was confirmed
quantitatively at each stage of gestation (Days 27FM,
27CAR, 27ICAR, 60COT, 60CAR, 60ICOT, 60ICAR,
150COT, 150CAR, 150ICOT, 150ICAR, 250COT,
250CAR, 250ICOT, and 250ICAR) by real-time RT-PCR
analysis. Details of the real-time RT-PCR procedures have
been described in previous reports [6,24]. Briefly, fifty ng
of the total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA for 30
min at 48°C by MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase with an
Oligo dT primer, dNTP mixture, MgCl2 and RNase inhibitor. Primer pairs and oligonucleotide probes labeled with
a reporter fluorescent dye at the 5'-end and a quencher fluorescent dye at the 3'-end were designed using the Primer
Express computer software program (Applied Biosystems). The primers and probes for each gene are listed in
Table 2. The thermal-cycling conditions included initial
sample incubation at 50°C for 2 min and at 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and at 60°C
for 1 min. The cycle threshold values (CT) indicate the
quantity of the target gene in each sample and were determined in real time using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence
detector (Applied Biosystems). The relative difference in
the initial amount of each mRNA species (or cDNA) was
determined by comparing the CT values. The standard
curves for each gene were generated by serial dilution of
plasmid containing bPRP-VIII, -IX, or GAPDH cDNA to
quantify the mRNA concentrations. The ratio of bPRP-VIII

presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by the TukeyKramer multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
Production of recombinant proteins
The bPRP-I, -VIII, -IX, and bPL sequences encoding the
mature protein region, which combined the FLAG and 6 ×
His epitope tag sequences, were inserted into the pFLAGCMV-3 vector (Sigma). The constructed plasmid was
transfected into HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for transient transfection.
Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were adapted to the suspension culture in a spinner flask using 293 SFM II
medium (Invitrogen, Gibco) and cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37°C for 3 days. The medium
was separated by centrifugation and stored at -30°C.
Western blot analysis
The 10 µg of proteins from the HEK293 cell conditioned
media were loaded on each lane, separated by SDS-PAGE,
and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane [25]. Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. [26]. Briefly, the
membrane was blocked in 10% skim milk overnight,
incubated with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) for 1 h at room
temperature, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG
conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) (diluted
1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunopositive
bands were stained using NBT (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) and BCIP (Bio-Rad).

Results
Sequences of bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA
Full-length bPRP-VIII and -IX were cloned from bovine
placentome. The 906- and 910-nucleotide sequences were
isolated in bPRP-VIII and -IX, respectively (Fig. 1 and 2).
The protein sequence regions (CDSs) were composed of

711 nucleotides in bPRP-VIII and 717 nucleotides in
bPRP-IX. The 3'-untranslated region contains one AATAAA
polyadenylation signal start 20 and 26 bases upstream
from the poly (A) addition site in bPRP-VIII and -IX,
respectively. The amino acid sequences deduced from fulllength bPRP-VIII and bPRP-IX cDNA are amino acids 236
and 238. The homology of predicted amino acid
sequences of bPRP-VIII and -IX protein were shown in Fig.
3. The predicted sequence of bPRP-VIII protein was 69%
homologous to that of bPRP-VI, 66% homologous to that
of bPRP-VII, 61% homologous to that of bPRP-I and -III,
58% homologous to that of bPRP-IV and -V, 57% homologous to that of bPRP-IX, 42% homologous to that of
bPRP-II, and 39% homologous to that of bPL-Ala (Fig. 3).
The predicted sequence of bPRP-IX protein was 81%
homologous to that of bPRP-IV, 76% homologous to that
of bPRP-I, 70% homologous to that of bPRP-II, 60%
homologous to that of bPRP-VII, 57% homologous to
that of bPRP-VI and -VIII, 53% homologous to that of
bPRP-III and -V, and 40% homologous to that of bPL-Ala
(Fig. 3). In the phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that
bPRP-VIII was close to bPRP-III, bPRP-VI, and bPRP-VII
sides in the phylogenetic tree and bPRP-IX was close to
bPRP-II and bPRP-IV sides in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.
4). The N-terminal regions of the bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins were rich in hydrophobic amino acid residue, which
is characteristic of the signal peptide. bPRP-VIII had two
consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and Asn-X-Ser/
Thr at the positions of 60 to 62 and 233 to 235 (Fig. 1).
bPRP-IX also had four consensus sequences for N-glycosylation at the positions of 70 to 72, 92 to 94, 146 to 148,
and 160 to 162 (Fig. 2). Another atypical N-glycosylation
site, Asn-X-Cys was found in only bPRP-IX at the position
of 95 to 97, and this region is identified in bPLs. The TAA
stop codon was used in both bPRP-VIII and -IX, and
appeared after the sequence TGC, which was present in
other bPRPs except for bPRP-VI and bPLs that encode Cterminal cysteine residue [17]. The predicted 3D structures of bPRP-VIII and -IX mature region are shown in Fig.
5. The structural differences of N-glycosylation site,

Expression of bPRP-VIII and -IX mRNA in bovine placenta
The distribution of bPRP-VIII and -IX mRNA was examined in various bovine tissues by RT-PCR. Both bPRP
mRNAs appeared only in the placental tissue (Fig. 6).

bPRP-VIII and -IX mRNA localization was determined by
in situ hybridization in the bovine placentome on day 60
of gestation (Fig. 7). DIG-labeled bPRP-VIII and -IX antisense RNA probes specifically detected the mRNA transcript in the placentome and intercotyledonary membrane. Both bPRPs appeared in the binucleate cells in the
cotyledon and intercotyledonary membrane, and bPRP-IX
mRNA was also detected in trinucleate cells (Figs. 7D and
7F). No significant signals were detected with sense
probes in any genes (Fig. 7B and 7E).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that
bPRP-VIII mRNA appeared primarily in the extra-embryonic membrane of Day 27, cotyledon and intercotyledonary membrane of Day 60 to 250 (Fig. 8). The expression
intensity increased approximately four-fold in the cotyledon from Day 27 to Day 60, and then slightly decreased
until Day 250 (approximately 0.6-fold). The expression
intensity increased approximately three-fold in the intercotyledon from Day 27 to Day 60 and was maintained
from Day 60 to Day 150. Then it then decreased slightly
until Day 250 (approximately 0.7-fold). In the caruncular
area, the expression increased by about four to five times
by Day 60, and the expression level was maintained to late
gestation. However no significant expression was detected
in the intercaruncle. bPRP-IX mRNA was also detected in
the cotyledonary placentome and intercotyledonary
membrane after Day 60 of gestation, but it did not appear
in the extra-embryonic membrane on Day 27 of gestation.
The mRNA expression intensity increased approximately
1.2-fold from Day 60 to Day 150 in the cotyledon and
approximately 1.9-fold the intercotyledon, and then those
values were maintained until Day 250. No expression of
bPRP-IX was observed in the caruncular area on Day 27,
but stable expression intensities were detected from Day
60 to Day 250. These expression intensities were rather
strong compared to the intercotyledonary and cotyledonary areas, even though the sources for this gene may be
binucleate and trinucleate cells.
The recombinant proteins of bPRP-VIII and -IX raised
with HEK293 cell were detected by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 9). The intense bands of bPRP-VIII with a FLAG
epitope tag migrated to approximately 28 kDa molecular
weight, while those of bPRP-IX with a FLAG epitope tag
migrated to 38 kDa, 34 kDa and 26 kDa (Fig. 9).

Discussion
In the present study, we identified two new members of
bPRP cDNAs, bPRP-VIII and -IX. Totally nine bPRP genes
have been identified at this moment in bovine.
bPRP-VIII and -IX cDNA sequences had following features,
respectively. The position of the polyadenylation signal
(AATAAA) in the bPRP-VIII started 20 bases upstream
from the poly(A) additional site. This configuration is specific to bPRP-VIII. The number of bases in bPRP-VIII from
the polyadenylation signal to poly(A) site are the fewest in
known bPRPs. The position of the polyadenylation signal
in the bPRP-IX started 26 bases upstream from the poly(A)
additional site. This position coincides with those in
bPRP-II and bPRP-IV [14,15]. The signal peptide
sequences in the N-terminal regions of both bPRP-VIII
and -IX were conserved similarly to those in other bPRPs/
bPLs (Fig. 3). The signal cleavage site was predicted to be
between the Glu-36 and Arg-37 in bPRP-VIII, and

between Glu-36 and Asn-37 in bPRP-IX by homology to
the N-terminal regions of the bPRPs/bPLs (Fig. 3). As a
result, bPRP-VIII is predicted to be a mature protein composed of 200 amino acids, while bPRP-IX has 202 amino
acids. bPRP-VIII lacked two amino acids (positions 94
and 183), which is a sequence characteristic, since other
known bPRPs have 202 amino acids. bPRP-VIII had two
potential N-glycosylation sites (amino acid portions 60 to
62 and 233 to 235, Figs. 1, 3 and 5). The position of 60 to
62 coincided with those of bPRP-III, -VI, and -VII
[6,14,17], however, the second N-glycosylation site was
found at 233 to 235 in amino acids. In contrast, bPRP-IX
had four potential typical N-glycosylation sites of Asn-XSer/Thr (amino acid portions 70 to 72, 92 to 94, 146 to
148, and 160 to 162, Figs. 2, 3 and 5). All these configurations of Asn-X-Ser/Thr coincide with those of bPRP-II
and -IV [14,15]. However, it is characteristic that only the
bPRP-IX have atypical N-glycosylation site of Asn-X-Cys
(amino acid portions 95 to 97). The conserved domains
(LD1 to LD4, Fig. 3) were suggested by Yamakawa et al.
[15] in other prolactin-related genes. The bPRP-VIII and IX sequences also revealed these LD domains. Cysteine
residues (PRP-VIII positions 96, 213, and 230, and PRP-IX
positions 97, 215, and 232) in the LD1 and LD4 domains
were conserved in bPRPs/bPLs, except for bPRP-VI. bPRP-

Localization of bPRP-VIII and -IX in the bovine placentome on day 60 of gestation
Figure 7
Localization of bPRP-VIII and -IX in the bovine placentome on day 60 of gestation. (A, B, C) bPRP-VIII and (D, E, F, G)
bPRP-IX mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization. (A, C, D, F, G) DIG-labeled anti-sense cRNA probes were used. (B, E)
DIG-labeled sense cRNA probes were used. Seven-microgram sections of bovine placentome were hybridized with each
probes. Scale bar = 100 µm on the (A, B, D, E) and 20 µm on the (C, F, G).

These configurations indicate common features in bPRPs/
bPLs. In particular, the configuration of the cysteine residue in bPRP-VIII coincided exactly with that of bPRP-III in
the mature sequence region. The cysteine residue in bPRPIX was also the same as that in bPRP-I, -II, and -IV in the
mature sequence region. Therefore, both bPRP-VIII and IX may have three disulfide bonds similar to those of
other bPRPs, except for bPRP-VII [6].
The primary mRNA expression of bPRP-VIII and -IX was
observed in the binucleate cells (Fig. 7). Both genes could
independently produce mature recombinant proteins in
the mammalian cell expression system (Fig. 9). The binucleate cells may have produced the bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins simultaneously because bPRP-VIII and -IX mRNA
expressed in the binucleate cells, and HEK293 cells translated these mRNA to each protein individually. Binucleate
cells are also primary expression cells for bPRP-I and bPL
[27,28] and may have a specific function for implantation
in the fetomaternal interface [11,29]. bPRP-VIII mRNA
was also expressed in the extra-embryonic membrane just
after the implantation period in the present study (Day 27
of gestation) (Fig. 8). bPRP-VIII may also be related to the

implantation process like bPRP-I and -VII since bPRP-I
was expressed during early gestation. Compare to these
expression, no bPRP-IX was present in the extra-embryonic membrane on Day 27 of gestation (Fig. 8). This
mRNA expression pattern implies that bPRP-IX has a different role from bPRP-I and bPL in placental formation
[6]. bPRP-IX mRNA was also detected in the trinucleate
cells. A trinucleate cell is generated by migration of a binucleate cell to an endometrial epithelial cell with the
progress of the pregnancy [30]. bPRP-IX may be a necessary molecule during middle to late gestation. Although
both bPRP-VIII and -IX may be necessary molecules for
gestation, in situ hybridization demonstrated that both
genes were primarily expressed in binucleate and trinucleate cells. This means both genes derive from fetal side origin, but both were stably contained in the caruncular area
throughout gestation, except bPRP-IX in early gestation.
There are two potential causes of this result. One is contamination after separation. A second possibility is cell
migration [30]. The present study and our previous study
suggest that binucleate and trinucleate cells may migrate
deeply into the endometrium after implantation and
maintain their functions, which may be related to immu-

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of (A) bPRP-VIII and (B) bPRP-IX mRNA in bovine placenta

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of (A) bPRP-VIII and (B) bPRP-IX mRNA in bovine placenta. The total
RNA was extracted from cotyledons containing extra-embryonic membrane (EEM), cotyledonary placenta (COT), intercotyledonary fetal membrane (ICOT), caruncular placenta (CAR), and intercaruncular endometrium (ICAR) on Day 27, Day 60, Day
150, and Day 250 of gestation. The expressions of these mRNAs were normalized to the expression of GAPDH measured in

nomodulation or stress during bovine gestation
[6,7,30,31]. The molecular size of the recombinant proteins completely differed between bPRP-VIII and -IX.
Transcripted bPRP-VIII protein is of relatively smaller size
in the known bPRP family members, and the bPRP-IX
protein is among the largest members [6,32,33]. The sugar
chain addition in post-translational modification will
give large effect in the difference of both molecular
weights. It was found that the predicted 3D structure differed clearly in both molecules, because configuration of
disulfide bonds and sugar chain addition dynamics are
different. The tertiary structure of bPRP-VIII and -IX are
similar to that of hPRL, so they may share the same receptor. However there is no information and the other evidence may not support this speculation. Only the bPRP-I
gene has been known to produce protein in the placenta,
however, the protein bound to the alpha2-macroglobulin
[32], so it might have a biological function in paracrine
status. Since all other bPRPs have a similar characteristic,
it is difficult to say bPRPs are hormones secreted into circulation from the placenta, such as bPRL and bPL. It was
possible to predict a part of their functions from the
molecular weight, 3D structure, and post-translational
modification. bPRP-VIII and -IX proteins may have different functions, since their temporal and special expressions
were different. Various difficulties remain for understanding PRP functions, however, many of the same genes and
molecules are expressed in bovine placenta as in rodent
placenta [7].

Recently, bovine genome projects have addressed various
shotgun sequence data and five known bPRPs, bPL, and
bPRL, a total of seven prolactin related genes, hit in the
NCBI genome database. They are located in Bos taurus
chromosomes 12 and/or 23. bPRP-III, -VII and bPL were
detected on chromosome 23 with bPRL. On the other
hand, bPRP-I, -V, and -VI are placed on chromosome 12.
Rodents such as mice and rats also have various PLPs
[7,34], and they have been clustered on one chromosome,
number 13 in mice and number 17 in rats [34,35]. bPRPIII and -VII were in comparatively close positions on the
phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4, and they are clustered in the
same chromosome 23. bPRP-VIII may be placed on chromosome 23 because bPRP-VIII was close to bPRP-III or VII on the phylogenetic tree, although the bootstrap value
is low between bPRP-VIII and bPRP-III/-VII. bPRP-I, -V,
and -VI, however, were comparatively close on the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4; these genes were clustered on chromosome 12. bPRP-IX may be placed on chromosome 12
because bPRP-IX was close to bPRP-I on the phylogenetic
tree. The actual configuration of the bPRP-VIII and -IX
genome will be addressed in the future. Therefore, prolactin-related genes in mammals may have similar roles for
placental function, but they may evolve through different
phylogenetic processes, may be two separate pathways.
For example, GH and PRL functions are different in various species, namely, GH uses the PRL receptor in some
species, but not in others [7,36].
In conclusion, we identified two new members of bPRPs,
bPRP-VIII and -IX. bPRP-VIII was expressed in binucleate

expression appeared as well in bPRP-I, -VII, and bPL, and
it expressed from the implantation period to late in gestation. bPRP-IX was expressed in binucleate cells and trinucleate cells, and was expressed somewhat late in gestation
compared to other PRPs. These data indicate that various
PRP genes in bovine placenta have coordination roles for
gestation as evidenced in rodents.
