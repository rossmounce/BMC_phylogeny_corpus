Abstract
Background: Annotating genomes remains an hazardous task. Mistakes or gaps in such a complex
process may occur when relevant knowledge is ignored, whether lost, forgotten or overlooked.
This paper exemplifies an approach which could help to ressucitate such meaningful data.
Results: We show that a set of closely related sequences which have been annotated as ornithine
carbamoyltransferases are actually putrescine carbamoyltransferases. This demonstration is based
on the following points : (i) use of enzymatic data which had been overlooked, (ii) rediscovery of a
short NH2-terminal sequence allowing to reannotate a wrongly annotated ornithine
carbamoyltransferase as a putrescine carbamoyltransferase, (iii) identification of conserved motifs
allowing to distinguish unambiguously between the two kinds of carbamoyltransferases, and (iv)
comparative study of the gene context of these different sequences.
Conclusions: We explain why this specific case of misannotation had not yet been described and
draw attention to the fact that analogous instances must be rather frequent. We urge to be
especially cautious when high sequence similarity is coupled with an apparent lack of biochemical
information. Moreover, from the point of view of genome annotation, proteins which have been
studied experimentally but are not correlated with sequence data in current databases qualify as
"orphans", just as unassigned genomic open reading frames do. The strategy we used in this paper
to bridge such gaps in knowledge could work whenever it is possible to collect a body of facts about
experimental data, homology, unnoticed sequence data, and accurate informations about gene
context.

Background
As a consequence of the deluge of completely sequenced
genomes belonging to a large array of species, one can
expect to identify many homologues of enzymes which
have been previously well studied at the experimental

level. This seems to be the general rule and the public
sequence databanks (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) are now
inundated by putative amino acid sequences which have
been annotated uniquely by the widely used two-step
process : (1) detection of a homologous relationship by a

pairwise sequence similarity search at the level of primary
structure and (2) inference of functional similarity from
this detected homology.
However, the opposite might be true. For various reasons
one can either miss or misinterpret the actual function of
a putative protein when annotating by homology, resulting in a wrong function transfer. Several studies have
already emphasized this point (see, for example, [1-3]).
On the other hand, beside these now well identified errors
which are often due to automatic processes, more subtle
mistakes may occur when some of the numerous effects of
divergent evolution are overlooked. In particular, one of
the insufficiently appreciated problems of functional
assignment is that homologous proteins might catalyse
different biochemical reactions. Here, we discuss an
instance of erroneous annotation (misannotation) in
genes of nitrogen metabolism which to our knowledge
has not yet been brought up. We explain why this is so
and draw attention to the fact that similar cases must actually be rather frequent.

Results and Discussion
Annotating distant carbamoyltransferases
Our group ([4,5]) is presently involved in deciphering the
evolutionary relationships between two ubiquitous and
essential proteins, aspartate carbamoyltransferase
(ATCase, EC 2.1.3.2) which catalyses the first committed
step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase, EC 2.1.3.3) which plays a
crucial role in both anabolism and catabolism of arginine.

In a recent study of the phylogeny of the 245 available
OTCases (paper in preparation), we confirmed the existence of two families, OTC alpha and OTC beta, previously
proposed on the basis of phylogenetic studies [4]. However, the advent of many new sequences further led to a
more complex topology of the distance tree schematized
on Fig. 1. It appears now that a significant number of
sequences which have been annotated as OTCases are distantly related to either family as outlined on Fig. 1. These
sequences, which are forming several clusters emerging in
different locations between the root and the two families
OTC alpha and OTC beta, have been provisionally annotated as UTC (unknown carbamoyltransferases). Indeed,
among these UTC we found two sequences which do not
correspond to classical OTCases.
The YgeW protein encoded by Escherichia coli and its close
homologue from Clostridium botulinum are both located
on a long branch emerging at the basis of this OTCases
tree. YgeW is annotated as belonging to the ATCase/
OTCase family (see, for example, the SwissProt knowledgebase [6]). On the branch which is next to the root we
find the sequence of a protein which has been reported to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/52

be essential for arginine biosynthesis in the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis [7]. This protein has been crystallized and characterized as a carbamoyltransferase-like
protein since it does not display OTCase activity in vitro
[7]. Indeed, several of its residues have been substituted in
sites which are viewed as crucial for OTCase activity.
Moreover, Dashuang et al. [7] indicated that a similar protein has been found in Xylella fastidiosa. Our phylogenetic
data are in agreement with this observation since the protein annotated as OTCases in two strains of X. fastidiosa
and its close relative present in two species of the Xanthomonas genus are found to branch close to that of B. fragilis. Therefore, the functional identification of these
different UTC is certainly not straightforward and requires
further investigations.
Furthermore, it occurred to us that, more than thirty years
ago, another carbamoyltransferase was discovered by
Roon and Barker [8]. A putrescine carbamoyltransferase
(PTCase, EC 2.1.3.6) was found to be synthesized by the
Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus (now Enterococcus)
faecalis when it was grown on agmatine but not arginine
as primary energy source. This PTCase was easily separated from the OTCase synthesized by the same organism
grown on arginine [8]. This putrescine carbamoyltransferase had further been studied by V. Stalon's group ([912]). Two features of this study – which had apparently
been overlooked in recent genome annotations – appear
now to be crucial for the interpretation of the data shown
on Fig. 1. (1) Wargnies et al. [9] showed that the
putrescine carbamoyltransferase of E. faecalis had a weak
but unambiguous OTCase activity (7.4% in terms of
Vmax, with KM for putrescine and L-ornithine of 0.029
mM and 13.0 mM respectively); (2) A short NH2-terminal
sequence (29 residues) was published ten years later [13].
Since the complete genome of E. faecalis has now been
sequenced [14], we could identify that one of the three
putative ornithine carbamoyltransferases encoded by this
genome, the open reading frame EF0732 annotated as
ArgF-2 [14], is actually the putrescine carbamoyltransferase previously studied by the group of Stalon.
A family of putrescine carbamoyltransferases
In a second step, we extended this reannotation of a
wrong OTCase as a PTCase to six other sequences encoded
by Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis (and a very close partial
sequence in Lactobacillus sakei) , Listeria monocytogenes and
Mycoplasma mycoides, respectively. Indeed, these eight
sequences, which have been annotated as either ArgF or
ArcB (Table 1), (i) share high identity at the level of their
amino acid sequence; (ii) they form a monophyletic
group (Fig. 1) and (iii) they match the previously published E. faecalis NH2-terminal 29 residues sequence [13].
Moreover, as shown on Fig. 2, these sequences share

A schematic evolutionary tree of carbamoyltransferases
A schematic evolutionary tree of carbamoyltransferases. A distance tree of the 245 available ornithine carbamoyltransferases has been obtained using the PhyloTree programme [33]. This tree was rooted by a few paralogous aspartate carbamoyltransferases belonging to either family ATC I or ATC II ([4], [5]). The root is indicated by a closed circle. The two
families OTC alpha and OTC beta are schematized as triangles. The homologous carbamoyltransferases which are branching
far from these ATC or OTC families are labelled as unknown (UTC) even if some of them have been annotated as ornithine
carbamoyltransferases (see text). The few UTC sequences which have been annotated as carbamoyltransferase-like are
enclosed in ovals. The clade of reannotated putrescine carbamoyltransferases is framed in red.

several specific motifs which are not found in the homologous OTCases. These motifs, especially the five longer
ones, are well conserved, even in M. mycoides which is
however more distant. When these motifs are used
together to query either the UniProt knowledgebase [15]
or the nr (non-redundant) database using the PHI-Blast
programme, we obtain only these putative PTCase
sequences (including that of M. mycoides) to the exclusion
of any other carbamoyltransferase.

Gene context, another tool for gene reannotation
In a third step, the reannotation of this clade of OTCase
sequences as PTCases was confirmed by a comparative
study of the neighbourhood of their encoding genes
present in the four genomes completely sequenced and
published (E. faecalis, Lc. lactis, S. mutans and L. monocytogenes). As shown on Fig. 3, the same set of neighbouring
genes were present in these four species. We have successively a transcriptional regulator, the reannotated PTCase,

an amino acid permease (probably an antiporter), a conserved hypothetical protein and finally the carbamate
kinase ArcC-3 (EC 2.7.2.2). In a next step, we found that
the so-called conserved hypothetical protein is homologous to the agmatine deiminase (or agmatine iminohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.12) of Bacillus cereus [15]. Fig. 3 further
shows that the gene order found in E. faecalis, is completely conserved in Lc. lactis and S. mutans and slightly
modified in L. monocytogenes.

microbial genomes (see [20-22]), we observe a very similar distribution, namely a transcriptional regulator, the
arginine deiminase (EC 3.5.3.6), an arginine/ornithine
antiporter and a (sometimes two) carbamate kinase.
There is thus a very close analogy between the set of genes
encoding the enzymes catalyzing the different steps of the
agmatine deiminase pathway found in these different Firmicutes and that encoding the enzymes catalyzing the different steps of the arginine deiminase pathway.

Thus, these four clusters of genes appear to encode the full
set of enzymes which are expected to form the catabolic
agmatine deiminase pathway [10]. Agmatine deiminase,
PTCase and carbamate kinase were already known to
become coinduced by agmatine in E. faecalis when it is
used as sole energy source [10], strongly suggesting that
these gene clusters are functional operons. In Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO1, the homologous agmatine deiminase is
encoded by the gene aguA belonging to an operon aguBA
induced by agmatine and N-carbamoylputrescine
([16,17]) but in this species N-carbamoylputrescine is
converted by a N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase
(EC 3.5.1.53, the aguB product) into putrescine and CO2
+ ammonium rather than into putrescine and carbamoylphosphate. More recently, a similar pathway for
polyamine biosynthesis has been identified by homology
in higher plants [18]. In the alternative pathway corresponding to the analogous sets of genes shown on Fig. 3,
it is thus a PTCase which catalyzes the second step and catabolically converts N-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine
and carbamoylphosphate which can further be used to
synthesize ATP via carbamate kinase [19].

Conclusions

Furthermore, when we compare the clusters of genes
shown in Fig. 3 to those surrounding gene argF or arcB,
encoding the catabolic OTCase functioning in the
arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway present in many

Genome annotation requires both reliable tools for identifying gene function and manual expertise. The frustration due to the high percentage of orphan genes found in
all genomes is often compounded with another – more
vicious – problem which may occur when a very strong
sequence similarity is obscuring the actual functional
identity of another kind of orphan. The analysis described
in this paper illustrates the difficulty in identifying such a
potential source of misannotation and delineates at least
two fundamental parameters which must be considered
especially when the results appear to be straightforward.
First, one must keep in mind that proteins sharing a high
level of identical residues may have different functions. A
routine step for challenging the functional annotation of
any putative coding sequence should be a phylogenetic
analysis. Any CDS found to branch far from its homologues in an evolutionary tree, as observed in the case of
the carbamoyltransferases (Fig. 1), should be examined
with caution before assigning it a putative function.
Another example of the usefulness of the phylogenetic
approach to correct misannotations can be found in a
comparative analysis of ureohydrolases [20].
The second parameter which must be considered is the
striking lack of information in the various public databases. For example, in the case studied here (the

Long motifs specific of putrescine carbamoyltransferases
Long motifs specific of putrescine carbamoyltransferases. The amino acid sequence of the open reading frame EF0732
of E. faecalis annotated as ArgF-2 [14] but now reannotated as putrescine carbamoyltransferase is shown. The NH2-terminal 29
residues sequence [13] which helped to this reannotation is indicated by a red bar above the respective residues. The amino
acids which are specifically conserved in putrescine carbamoyltransferases and not in ornithine carbamoyltransferases are
printed in bold. Inside the long motifs (> 15 residues) found along the whole sequence and numbered as "Motif 1" to Motif
5"are indicated the few substitutions present in the other sequences (lines above the E. faecalis sequence) including those of M.
mycoides which is more distant (line in italic below the E. faecalis sequence). The residues forming the respective binding sites of
carbamoylphosphate and of either putrescine or ornithine are also in bold and framed.

putrescine carbamoyltransferase EC 2.1.3.6) it is reported
that there is no sequence available in various first-rate
databases specialized in enzymatic and/or metabolic data
such as ENZYME [23], BRENDA [24], KEGG [25], BIOCYC [26], etc...as well as in the Gene Ontology
(GO:0050231) Consortium [27]. A significant part of this
deficit of information appears to be due to not correlating
biochemical data [8-11] previously published and well
recorded in BRENDA [24], for example, with the

incomplete amino acid sequence which was not taken
into account although it had been published by the same
group [13] who studied this enzyme.
The specific point we would like to stress in this paper
reflects a more general gap – which is widely ignored –
between the enormous quantity of information buried in
the sequence data and the refined knowledge built up
over several decades of studies on gene regulation and

Conservation of the gene context of putrescine carbamoyltransferases

faecalis is shown with neighbouring ORFs. Under each numbered ORF (EF0731 to EF0735) is indicated the putative function
proposed by the annotators of this complete genome [14]. Below is the reannotation we are proposing. This schematic representation is repeated for the similar genomic regions present in three other completely sequenced genomes, those of Lc. lactis,

protein biochemistry (recorded in [23] to [27]). In this
respect, experimentally studied proteins not correlated
with sequence data also qualify as "orphans". In the
present case, such a resulting gap in knowledge could be
bridged only because we used the experimental approach
detailed in this paper. After being alerted by the unusual
topology of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) and the rediscovery of the partial sequence [13], a confirmation of the
reannotation as PTCases was obtained when considering
their signature (Fig. 2) and the gene context (Fig. 3) which
differentiate them clearly from their OTCase homologues.

The strategy we used to identify such orphan sequences
could work in any other case where it is possible to collect
a body of facts about experimental data, homology, unnoticed sequence data, and accurate informations about
gene context. Note that we incidentally used such a
strategy to annotate the genes encoding a putative agmatine deiminase in the genomes listed in Fig. 3. It is highly
probable that this approach can be applied to many similar cases. Therefore, our community should feel encouraged to dig in old lab books, unpublished data buried in
doctoral thesis and similar documents, in order to retrieve
information crucial for correct genome annotation. More-

over, it becomes urgent to design new approaches in order
to efficiently explore what has been called the "bibliome"
[28]. This could help to bridge important gaps in knowledge – such as exemplified in this paper- which lead to
numerous errors in genome annotation. Accordingly, it
would become possible to (re)annotate conserved hypothetical proteins for which there is an apparent lack of
information in the various public databases.

Methods
Collecting sequences
Near 450 carbamoyltransferases (ATCases and OTCases)
sequences were collected from the public databases SwissProt, TREMBL and TREMBLNEW [15]. To facilitate the
management of these data which are continuously growing up with the onset of new completely sequenced
genomes, we assemble them in a relational database
(available on request). Moreover, in the case of unpublished but completely sequenced genomes, it was often
possible to recover bona fide sequences from specific
sequencing groups sites (Joint Genome Institute [29] and
Sanger Institute [30]) using either BlastP or tBlastN queries. We retained only unpublished sequences aligning
along their whole length with bona fide carbamoyltransferases and sharing no less than 30% identity with it,
using at least two distantly related seeds.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/52

distances are weighted by computing their variance when
reconstructing the tree.

Authors' contributions
NG dug up the "ancient" data on putrescine carbamoyltransferase, contributed his knowledge about carbamoyltransferases and made important additions to the
manuscript. YX brought essential informations about the
genetics and biochemistry of the enzymes involved in
arginine metabolism and their evolution. DGN participated in the collection of new carbamoyltransferase
sequences and their manual alignment and identified
which sequence of E. faecalis is the putrescine carbamoyltransferase. BL carried out the phylogenetic analyses, the
gene context study and drafted the manuscript which was
further improved (and approved) by all authors.

Reconstructing phylogenetic trees
Rooted phylogenetic trees were derived from multiple
alignements of ATCases and OTCases using two different
approaches. (1) New sequences were manually added and
aligned to the previously published [4] multiple alignement using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor [31].
These additions were made effortless by introducing each
new sequence near its closest partner (the first hit in a routine BlastP check). This processive approach minimized
the risk of introducing any bias when adding numerous
new sequences. However, the soundness of this manual
alignement was routinely checked using automatic programmes (both ClustalX and DARWIN, see below) to verify that we did not miss any conserved motifs. We further
ascertained this multiple alignement (especially the introduction of gaps) by using the informations available from
the known 3D structures of ATCases and OTCases. Maximum parsimony and distance trees were derived from this
alignment using the PROTPARS and NEIGHBOR programmes of the PHYLIP package [32], respectively. This
PHYLIP package was further used to derive confidence
limits for each node of either parsimony or distance trees
using a bootstrap approach (programmes SEQBOOT and
CONSENSE). (2) The PhyloTree programme of the DARWIN package [33] allows to build a multiple alignement
and to derive a distance tree which is an approximation to
maximum likelihood tree since the deduced evolutionary
