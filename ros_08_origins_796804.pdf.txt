Abstract
Background: Obligate asexual reproduction is rare in the animal kingdom. Generally, asexuals are
considered evolutionary dead ends that are unable to radiate. The phytophagous mite genus Bryobia
contains a large number of asexual species. In this study, we investigate the origin and evolution of
asexuality using samples from 111 populations in Europe, South Africa and the United States,
belonging to eleven Bryobia species. We also examine intraspecific clonal diversity for one species,
B. kissophila, by genotyping individuals from 61 different populations. Knowledge on the origin of
asexuality and on clonal diversity can contribute to our understanding of the paradox of sex.
Results: The majority (94%) of 111 sampled populations reproduces asexually. Analysis of part of
nuclear 28S rDNA shows that these asexuals do not form a monophyletic clade. Analysis of the
mitochondrial COI region shows that intraspecific variation is extensive (up to 8.8%). Within B.
kissophila, distinct clades are found, which are absent at the nuclear 28S rDNA level. Moreover,
paraphyletic patterns are found at the mitochondrial DNA.
Conclusion: Asexuality is widespread in the genus Bryobia, signifying that some animal taxa do
contain a high number of asexuals. We argue that asexuality originated multiple times within
Bryobia. Wolbachia bacteria cause asexuality in at least two Bryobia species and may have infected
different species independently. The high intraspecific clonal diversity and the patterns of paraphyly
at the mitochondrial DNA in B. kissophila might be explained by a high mutation fixation rate and
past hybridization events. Reproductive parasites like Wolbachia and Cardinium might influence
these processes. We discuss the role these bacteria could play in the evolutionary success of
asexual species.

Background
Asexual taxa are found across the eukaryotic tree of life:
many plant, fungal, and animal taxa contain asexual lineages. In most cases however, this asexuality is facultative:
apparent asexual species do have sex now and then. Obligate
less than 1% of all species reproduce strictly asexually [1].
The distribution of these asexuals is 'tippy': most asexuals

are found as single branches on the tips of the tree,
branching off from closely related sexual species [1,2].
Fully asexual taxa contain few species. Apparently, asexual
species can survive in the short-term, but are doomed to
extinction in the long-term.
Asexual reproduction has short-term advantages compared to sexual reproduction. In a sexual population

females will produce both sons and daughters, but in an
asexual population females will produce only daughters.
An asexual population has therefore twice the growth rate
of a sexual population (assuming a sexually reproducing
population with an equal sex ratio and with males contributing nothing but gametes to the offspring). In other
words, there is a two-fold cost of sexual reproduction
[3,4]. Besides this two-fold cost, there are other costs
related to sexual reproduction: costs of finding a mate, of
sexually transmitted diseases or selfish genetic elements,
or of the act of sex itself [5]. Despite these costs, sex is
widespread (the 'paradox of sex'). General explanations
for this paradox refer to the long-term disadvantages of
asexual reproduction: asexuals are less able to adapt to
novel environments and are exposed to accumulation of
deleterious mutations (reviewed in [1,6-10]). This is why
asexuals are considered short-lived evolutionary 'dead
ends' with limited adaptive potential [1,11,12]. It also
explains the sporadic and low-level phylogenetic distribution of obligate asexual lineages. An exception to this pattern are a few groups that have been reproducing
exclusively asexually for a long evolutionary time, like the
bdelloid rotifers [13], darwinulid ostracods ([14]; but see
[15]), and oribatid mites [16,17].
The phytophagous spider mite genus Bryobia (Acari:
Tetranychidae) contains both asexually (thelytokous) and
sexually (arrhenotokous) reproducing species. The genus
is poorly studied and phylogenetic relationships are
unknown. Species are described on the basis of morphology and host plant associations [18,19]. However, suitable morphological characters are rare in these tiny mites
and this severely limits identification. In addition, host
plant associations are generally considered unsuitable as
primary input for species identification [20]. Bolland et al.
[21] list over 130 species names, but these are likely to
include synonyms and overlapping species descriptions,
as such descriptions are often based on morphological
descriptions of quantitative characters (e.g., body size,
number and length of setae) in single, locally occurring
mites. Nonetheless, for the majority of described species,
no males have been reported and females reproduce asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis [22], indicating that asexuality is widespread in this genus.
Parthenogenesis in at least two asexual Bryobia species is
caused by the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia [23].
Wolbachia are reproductive parasites that enhance their
own transmission by manipulating the reproduction of
their host, resulting in an increased number of infected
females (see [24] for a review). Wolbachia were detected in
four additional asexual Bryobia species, but the causal
effect was not established [23]. In addition, Weeks and
Breeuwer [23] showed that the parthenogenesis is functionally apomictic, as heterozygosity is maintained.

The occurrence of many asexuals in one genus is rare and
raises questions about the origin and evolution of the
asexual lineages. One way to address such questions is
using a phylogenetic approach [25]. Suppose a phylogeny
shows that asexuals occur as single lineages among sexual
sister groups, indicating that they are 'evolutionary dead
ends' that are unable to radiate. Then, the most likely
explanation is multiple (and recent) origins of asexuality.
On the contrary, if all asexuals form a monophyletic
group, the most likely explanation would be a single and
older origin with subsequent radiation of asexuals, a phenomenon that has rarely been found for asexuals [2].
In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic history of
asexual reproduction in the genus Bryobia. Also, we examine intraspecific clonal variation by analyzing samples
collected on a large geographic scale. Generally, clonal
species are thought to harbor little genetic diversity. This
approach provides the framework for investigating the
evolution of asexuality and host plant specificity across
the genus. We use a combination of mitochondrial (the
cytochrome oxidase c subunit I gene, COI) and nuclear
(the 28S rDNA gene) sequence data for inferring species
relationships. Combining nuclear and mitochondrial
data is desirable for detecting processes such as hybridization and hitchhiking.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
We sampled Bryobia mites from 111 different locations
(populations) between May 2000 and September 2006
(see Additional file 1 and 2 for details on Bryobia samples). This collection comprised samples from a wide
range of host plant species (at least 12 different host plant
genera in six families) in 14 different countries in Europe.
We investigated intraspecific variation in one species (B.
kissophila) by analyzing 61 populations across 12 different
European countries. Additionally, we included samples
from South Africa (one population) and the United States
(two populations). As an outgroup reference, we sampled
ten European and two Chinese Petrobia spp. (Acari:
Tetranychidae) populations. Bryobia and Petrobia both
belong to the subfamily Bryobiinae of the Tetranychidae
[21]. Mites were either directly used or stored in 96% ethanol until DNA extraction. Mites were morphologically
identified by Dr. F. Faraji (Mitox, Amsterdam) and Dr. E.
Ueckerman (PPRI, Pretoria, South Africa). However, not
all samples could be identified morphologically. Currently, few morphological keys for distinguishing Bryobia
species exist, but none of these includes all described species and all are developed for identifying locally occurring
mites only ([19,26] (South Africa); [27] (Greece); [28]
(New Zealand); [29] (United States)). Voucher specimens
will be stored at the Zoological Museum of the University
of Amsterdam (ZMA). DNA was extracted from single

described [30]. Adult females as well as males, if present,
were used.

assessed (Table 1). If males were encountered, the clade
was considered to reproduce sexually; if not, the clade was
classified as asexual.

Species identification
Samples were identified to the species level using morphological keys. Bryobia sarothamni Geijskes, B. rubrioculus
(Scheuten), B. berlesei van Eyndhoven, B. praetiosa Koch,
and B. kissophila van Eyndhoven were identified based on
morphology. Samples that could not be morphologically
identified were a posteriori named B. spec. I-VII, based on
molecular phylogenetic analysis. The latter designations
will be maintained throughout the article, although the
exact species status remains to be determined (see discussion). In addition, we sampled mites from the related
genus Petrobia. These were identified as Petrobia tunisea
and P. harti. Other Petrobia samples were a posteriori
named P. spec. I and P. spec. II.

PCR amplification and sequencing
Part of the mitochondrial COI gene was amplified using
various primer combinations (as individual primer sets
did not work for all species) (Table 2). Two primers were
adjusted based on sequences form other tetranychid taxa
available from GenBank (Table 2). Depending on the
primer combination, a fragment of 410–867 basepairs
(bp) was obtained. A fragment of 410 bp, amplified by the
primers COI_F1 and COI_R1 (Table 2; [31]), was used in
subsequent analyses. PCR conditions for COI were as
described in Ros and Breeuwer [30]. For one individual of
each COI haplotype, the 5' end of the nuclear 28S rDNA
(the D1 region) was amplified (see Additional file 1 and
2). This region is generally less variable than the mitochondrial COI region [32] and therefore, samples with
identical COI haplotypes were assumed to have an identical 28S haplotype. However, several processes might violate this assumption (see discussion). The validity of the
assumption was therefore investigated by sequencing
more than one individual per COI haplotype in several
cases (see Additional file 1 and 2). PCR reaction mix was
the same as for COI [30], except that no additional MgCl2
was added. PCR cycling conditions for 28S were 2 min. at
94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 40 sec. at 94°C, 40 sec. at
48°C, and 90 sec. at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C
for 5 min. A negative control in which water was added
instead of DNA was included in all PCR reactions. Products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris base,
45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0).

(A)sexuality of species
Where possible, field-collected females were reared as isofemale lines in the laboratory. In this way the reproductive
mode could be assessed. Strains, in which males were neither observed in the cultures, nor encountered in the field,
were classified as asexual. Males are easily recognized by
their smaller body size and extremely long front legs (up
to two times their body size) compared to females, and by
their mating behavior [22]. Additionally, the lower part of
the abdomen is V-shaped in males, while it is circular in
females. For those species that were not reared in the lab,
the occurrence of males in the collected field samples was

A = asexual, S = sexual. Reproductive mode was assessed by
determining the presence of males directly in field samples only (field),
or in combination with laboratory cultures initiated with field samples
(culture). N indicates the total number of individuals investigated (in
cases where males were counted from field samples only). * = mode

PCR products were purified using a DNA extraction kit
(Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The purified products were directly sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye
Terminator Sequence Kit (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions but diluted 16 times. Both strands of
the products were sequenced using the same primers as in
the PCR amplification. Sequences were run on an ABI
3700 automated DNA sequencer. Sequences were checked
visually for ambiguous nucleotides (double peaks) and
the presence of stop codons. Sequences of representatives
of all haplotypes were submitted to GenBank (see Additional file 1 and 2 for GenBank accession numbers).
Data analysis
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1.8.0 with
default settings [33]. Analyses were performed for the 28S
and COI datasets separately. PAUP* version 4.0b10 [34]
and DAMBE version 4.1.15 [35] were used to calculate
numbers of variable sites, uncorrected pairwise diver-

gences, nucleotide composition, and transition and transversion ratios. PAUP was used to perform a chi-square test
of base frequency homogeneity across all taxa.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using NeighbourJoining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Bayesian
methods. Both PAUP and Modeltest 3.6 [36] were used to
select the optimal evolution model. The selected model
was further optimized by critically evaluating the selected
parameters [37] using the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC; [38]). For 28S, a submodel of the GTR+G (General
Time Reversible model with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity among sites) with a rateclass 'a b c a b d' had
the highest likelihood score (i.e., the lowest -ln likelihood
score) (AIC). Because COI is a protein coding gene, we
tested if the likelihood of models could be further
improved by incorporating specific rates for each codon
position [39]. Using this approach, the Transition model
(TIM) with site specific rates for the three codon position
was selected for COI. Under the selected models, parameters and tree topology were optimized using the successive
approximations approach [40]. NJ analyses (p-distances)
and ML analyses (heuristic search, random addition of
sequences with five replicates, TBR branch swapping, and
a reconnection limit of 10 for COI analysis) were performed in PAUP. Robustness of nodes was assessed with
1,000 NJ- resp ML-bootstrap replicates. However, as PAUP
does not allow for site-specific rates in bootstrap analysis,
ML bootstrapping for COI was performed with gamma
distributed rates, with 100 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap
values were then plotted on the phylogeny obtained with
the TIM model with site specific rates. Bayesian analyses
were performed as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 [41].
For 28S we used a GTR+G model; for COI we used a GTR
model with separate rates for each codon position. Analyses were initiated form random starting trees. Two separate MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) runs, each
composed of four chains (one cold and three heated),
were run for 2 million generations. The cold chain was
sampled every 100 generations, the first 5,000 generations

were discarded afterwards (burn-in of 25%). Posterior
probabilities were computed from the remaining trees.
We checked whether the MCMC analyses ran long enough
using the program AWTY (Are We There Yet?) [42]. Stationarity was assumed when there was convergence
between the two MCMC runs and when the cumulative
posterior probabilities of splits stabilized; in both analyses 2 million generations proofed sufficient. The final
trees were rooted using four species of the genus Petrobia
as outgroup.
Test of monophyly
The COI phylogeny depicts B. kissophila as a paraphyletic
species (see results). We tested if a phylogeny with B. kissophila as a monophyletic group is significantly less likely
than the presented phylogeny by performing a KishinoHasegawa test (KH-test; [43]) and a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH-test; [44]) as implemented in PAUP. First, we
performed a constrained heuristic search (B. kissophila as a
monophyletic clade; search settings same as without constraint). The KH- and SH-test were used to test for significant differences between the likelihood scores of the trees
(unconstrained and constrained). We used a one-sided
KH-test to correct for comparing an a priori-specified phylogeny (the constrained tree) with an a posteriori-specified
phylogeny (the ML tree) [45]. We also tested for monophyly of all asexual respectively sexual species using the
same approach (constrained search with asexuals resp.
sexuals as a monophyletic clade).

Results
Patterns of molecular evolution
The 28S D1 fragment
The 28S D1 fragment could be amplified in all but one
Bryobia species (amplification in B. spec. II failed). No
signs of ambiguity were found and intraspecific variation
was absent or very low (0–1%), indicating that intra-individual variation is absent for 28S D1 (which is a multiple
copy gene). Therefore, it was decided not to clone the PCR
products before sequencing. The length of the amplified

28S fragment was 356 bp. This included the D1 region
(168 bp) and its flanking regions (79 bp before and 109
bp after the D1 region) [46]. Of the 356 sites, 60 sites were
phylogenetically informative, 20 sites variable but uninformative, and 276 sites were constant. In two species (B.
sarothamni and B. spec. VI) an insert of one bp was found.
All sequences could be unambiguously aligned. On average, across all Bryobia taxa, the AT content was 54% (33%
A, 21% T, 19% C, and 27% G), i.e., an unbiased basepair
composition. A chi-square test of base frequency homogeneity revealed no significant differences in basepair composition across taxa (Figure 1a). The extent of saturation
was assessed by plotting the transition and transversion
rates against the uncorrected p-distance divergences (Figure 2a). Transitions outnumbered transversions as the
divergence time increased and both did not reach a plateau. This observation, plus the fact that the basepair composition was unbiased, indicates that saturation is absent
and that this fragment can be used for phylogeny reconstruction.
The COI fragment
The length of the amplified COI region ranged from 410
to 867 bp (depending on the choice of primer combinations); a homologous 410 bp fragment (Table 2) was used
for subsequent analyses. All sequences could be unambiguously aligned; no insertions or deletions were found.
Translation of the sequences into amino acids revealed no
stop codons. Of the 410 sites, 142 sites were phylogenetically informative, 10 sites were variable but uninformative, and 258 sites were constant. On average, across all
Bryobia taxa, the AT content was 73% (29% A, 44% T, 12%
C, and 15% G). This AT bias is comparable to that found
for other Tetranychidae [30] or for insects [47]. However,
the bias in base composition was not uniformly distributed over codon positions (Figure 1b). First, second, and
third codon positions showed AT biases of 65, 63, and
91%, respectively. In some haplotypes, the G base was
entirely absent at the third codon position. A chi-square
test of base frequency homogeneity revealed no significant differences across taxa for the overall data set or for
the three base positions separately (Figure 1b). Transversions outnumbered transitions as the divergence time
increased, predominantly at the third codon position
(Figure 2b and 2c). This indicates saturation, although the
transversion rate did not reach a plateau yet. The
extremely biased base composition combined with saturation at the third codon position severely limits the use
of this COI region for resolving phylogenetic relationships, especially at deeper nodes. Exclusion of the third
codon position did not result in a better resolution
because variation at the first and second codon position
was very low. A high AT content and the resulting limited
phylogenetic resolution for the COI region was also found

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/153

for other tetranychid mites [30] as well as for parasitengona mites [48] and velvet worms (Onychophora) [49].
28S phylogeny
Figure 3 shows the ML phylogeny reconstructed from the
28S D1 fragment, with ML bootstrap values and Bayesian
posterior probabilities. Identical topologies were
obtained from the different analyses (NJ, ML and Bayesian). The resulting phylogeny is well-resolved. Populations belonging to a single lineage have different
geographic origins and are invariably found on the same
host plant species or group of host plant species. This indicates that each species has a strong host plant association.
Certain species group together, and this grouping is again
linked to related host plant species. Bryobia berlesei, B.
sarothamni, B. spec. III, and B. spec. VI form a monophyletic group (bootstrap value 77%) and are all found
on host plant species of the Fabaceae, tribe Genisteae. Bryobia species found on host plant species of the tribe Genisteae have been named the Berlesei group [18]. Closely
related to this group are B. kissophila and B. praetiosa,
although exact relationships remain unresolved (low
bootstrap values). Bryobia kissophila is restricted to Hedera
helix (Ivy), whereas B. praetiosa is found on grasses and
herbaceous plant species growing along road sides. Samples from rosaceous fruit tree species also form a monophyletic group (bootstrap value 100%). Here, three
haplotypes are distinguished. The p-distances between
these haplotypes are low (0.6–1.0%) and these haplotypes most likely all concern B. rubrioculus. All aforementioned species group together (bootstrap value 64%) and
are clearly separated from another group of species collected from grasses and herbs (B. spec. I, B. spec. V, and B.
spec. VII) and Malva spec. (B. spec. IV). Average distances
between Bryobia species range from 1.7 to 11.5%.
COI phylogeny
Figure 4 shows the ML phylogeny reconstructed from the
COI fragment, with ML bootstrap values and Bayesian
posterior probabilities. NJ, ML, and Bayesian analyses
show identical topologies. The COI region is more variable than the 28S D1 region, with interspecific distances
ranging from 7.5 to 16.8%. The ML phylogeny reconstructed from COI sequences shows clustering of haplotypes into distinct clades (Figure 4), which in most cases
correspond to the 28S lineages found. Clades found for
COI are well supported; however, the phylogenetic relationships between these clades remain largely unresolved.
Therefore, higher-level groupings (e.g., the Berlesei group)
are less pronounced than for 28S. The wide sampling of B.
kissophila revealed a large amount of intraspecific variation. Samples from 61 populations cluster into four different clades (named A-D in Figure 4). Average pairwise
distances between these clades range from 5.5 to 8.8%.
Clade B is the largest, covering samples from all over

range of clade B (clade A contains one French and two
Dutch populations). Clade C is comprised of populations
from the United States and clade D of populations from
Spain and Portugal (note however that the sampling
intensity in clade C is low).

B. praetiosa forms a monophyletic group, which is nested
within the B. kissophila clades. The same topology is supported by the NJ and Bayesian analysis (data not shown).
However, the KH-test and SH-test do not reject a topology
with a monophyletic B. kissophila clade (p = 0.51 for both
tests), so paraphyly of B. kissophila is not well supported.
All B. kissophila COI clades share the same 28S haplotype,
which differs 1.7% from B. praetiosa. Nucleotide differences between B. praetiosa and the four B. kissophila clades
range from 5.1 to 5.9% and are thus smaller than those
among B. kissophila clades (5.5 to 8.8%).
For all species except B. rubrioculus, all COI haplotypes
found within the various species clades share an identical
28S haplotype. The assumption that samples with identical COI haplotypes have an identical 28S haplotype
proved also to be true in cases where this was tested. In B.
rubrioculus, however, this assumption was violated, as two
samples sharing the same COI haplotype (NL16 and
GR5) have different 28S haplotypes (distances between
0.6 and 1.0%).
Phylogenetic distribution of asexuality
Despite extensive sampling, from different host plant species in various countries, only seven out of 111 sampled
populations contained males (6%). These samples concern two species: B. spec. IV and B. sarothamni. All other
populations reproduced asexually, indicating that asexuality is widespread in the genus Bryobia (Table 1). In the
28S phylogeny, the asexual species do not form a monophyletic clade. This is supported by the KH- and SH-test: a
phylogeny enforcing asexuals as a monophyletic clade is
significantly different from the maximum likelihood phylogeny (p = 0.002 for both tests). The two sexual species
form two apical branches within different asexual clades.
This pattern does not support the general observation that
each asexual species forms a single apical branch with a
sexual sister species. The observed patterns indicate either
a single origin of asexuality with subsequent reversals to
sexuality or multiple origins of asexuality. Unfortunately,
the observed patterns in the 28S phylogeny could not be
confirmed by the COI phylogeny, which is unresolved at
deeper branching patterns due to saturation.

Discussion
We present a detailed study of the genus Bryobia, using
samples collected from a wide range of host plants across

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/153

Europe. Our phylogenetic approach shows several distinct
clades or lineages, supported by both nuclear 28S and
mitochondrial COI data. For those species that could be
morphologically identified, these clades are consistent
with morphological data. Other clades are tentatively
named B. spec. I-VII. Except for B. spec. IV these species all
reproduce asexually. The assessment of species in asexual
taxa is problematic, as the biological species concept is not
applicable and each clonal lineage can be considered as a
single species. However, Fontaneto et al. [50] showed that
even in ancient asexual bdelloid rotifers, well-separated
genetic clusters are found. In the genus Bryobia we find
distinct phylogenetic entities, here tentatively labeled
with different species names. Most species are restricted to
a single host plant species (Figure 3 and 4). Bryobia kissophila, B. spec. III, B. berlesei, B. sarothamni, and B. spec.
IV are each restricted to a specific host plant species and
are thus true specialists. Furthermore, B. rubrioculus is
restricted to rosaceous fruit tree species. However, different species may co-occur on a single host plant species.
For example, both B. sarothamni and B. berlesei are found
on common broom (Cytisus scoparius). Also B. spec II and
B. spec VI are found on broom-like species, although they
might each be restricted to a different broom species [18].
Finally, four species (B. praetiosa, B. spec. I, spec. V, and B.
spec. VII) are more generalistic, feeding on several host
plant species belonging to different families. The high
level of specificity found for most Bryobia species contrasts
with findings of Groot [51], who showed that three asexual species of Brevipalpus mites were host plant generalists,
found on over 30 different host plant species with several
host plant species shared among species. With an intensive sampling effort, including samples form a wide geographic area and a variety of host plants, we sampled 12
Bryobia species. This is in contrast with the total number
of described species (see compilation by Bolland et al.
[21]). We think that the number of species listed might be
an overestimation due to the general lack of informative
morphological characters for reliable species identification and the existence of synonymous species names –
similar individuals collected from different geographic
areas or host plants have been given different species
names.
Below, we will first discuss the high levels of intraspecific
clonal diversity found for B. kissophila and subsequently
we will focus on the origin and evolution of asexuality
within the genus Bryobia.
Clonal diversity
Extensive sampling of B. kissophila shows that intraspecific
diversity at COI is very large. Four clades (A-D) are distinguished, with interclade distances ranging from 5.5 to
8.8%. Clade (B) is the largest clade and comprises populations from all over Europe. Two other clades (C and D)

are linked to geographically different areas (United States
and Iberian Peninsula, respectively). The fourth clade (A)
contains three populations from areas within clade B.
Intraspecific COI differences between some B. kissophila
clades are larger than interspecific distances between B.
kissophila and B. praetiosa. In the phylogenetic tree (NJ,
ML, and Bayesian analyses) B. kissophila, which is only
found on Hedera helix, forms a paraphyletic species: B. praetiosa falls within the B. kissophila clade. However, bootstrap support is not very high and a KH- and SH-tests do
not exclude monophyly of B. kissophila. Still, the overlapping range of inter- and intraspecific divergence is remarkable. Intraspecific differences are much higher than values
found in for example asexual Brevipalpus mites (Acari:
Tenuipalpidae). In this mite genus intraspecific ML distances range between 1.9 to 4.3% for the same COI region
[51]. Extremely high intraspecific differences (up to
20.9%) were found between sexual and asexual lineages
of the ostracod Eucypris virens [52].
There are several hypotheses that could explain this high
level of intraspecific diversity in asexual species. Clonal
diversity can originate in at least three different ways [53]:
1) through separate and recurrent origin of clones from a
sexual ancestor, 2) through hybridization between asexual females with males (either from the same or from
other species), or 3) through mutation. Separate origins of
clones from a sexual ancestor is often found in species
with mixed reproduction (sexual as well as asexual lineages), where asexual clones are continuously formed over
time [52]. Mixed reproduction is absent in B. kissophila,
because the whole species is asexual. It is still possible that
the different asexual clones independently originated
from a highly variable sexual ancestor [54] and that ancestral mitochondrial polymorphism is maintained. This
would, however, result in a correlation between the
nuclear and mitochondrial phylogeny. The fact that the
distinction between B. kissophila and B. praetiosa (1.7%
difference) at the nuclear 28S locus is not supported by
the mitochondrial COI phylogeny is not consistent with
the above expectation.
Hybridization as a current source of clonal diversity, is not
very likely because males are completely absent in B. kissophila as well as in B. praetiosa. Males have never been
observed in cultures or in the field. Moreover, Weeks and
Breeuwer [23] showed that males obtained after antibiotic
treatment do not successfully mate with females. Furthermore, although males do exist in other species, these species are restricted to very different host plant species. On
the other hand, hybridization might have occurred in the
past before the origin or fixation of asexuality. Then, the
phylogenetic pattern we currently observe is simply a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/153

reflection of the relatively recent fixation of asexual reproduction in different lineages.
Finally, mutations could explain part of the clonal diversity. We observed high levels of intraspecific diversity at
the mitochondrial level, but almost none at the nuclear
level. High levels of intraspecific mitochondrial COI
diversity either signify a long history of asexuality or an
elevated rate of mutations at the mitochondrial DNA. In
the case of a long asexual history, divergence at nuclear
genes is also expected, and alleles within an individual
would eventually diverge over time (Meselson effect;
[13]). However, if gene conversion occurs during meiosis,
divergence at nuclear genes can be reduced or absent.
Although heterozygosity is maintained in Bryobia, indicating that parthenogenesis is functionally apomictic [23],
the mechanism of parthenogenesis is unknown. Maintenance of heterozygosity can be achieved by strictly
apomictic parthenogenesis (no meiosis) or by premeiotic
doubling. Only in the latter case, meiosis is present, and
gene conversion can take place. It is unclear whether parthenogenesis in Bryobia involves meiosis, and at this
moment we can not distinguish between the alternative
explanations.
Reproductive parasites like Wolbachia and Cardinium can
influence processes like hybridization and fixation of
mutations and can therefore have a large impact on clonal
diversity. They can cause selective sweeps of mitochondrial DNA, which increase the rate of fixation of mutations.
Selective
sweeps
can
either
decrease
(homogenization of mitochondrial variation in a population) or increase (when a species is infected with different
bacterial strains each linked to a mitochondrial haplotype) genetic variation [55]. The pattern we found for B.
kissophila, with distinct mitochondrial clades with high
interclade divergence, was also found in Drosophila simulans [56,57]. In D. simulans these mitochondrial clades
were most likely associated with different Wolbachia
strains. Selective sweeps combined with hybridization
between different species can also cause homogenization
of species after a hybridization event, when the parasites
spread and drag along the associated mitochondrial haplotype. This can result in paraphyletic patterns at the mitochondrial DNA. Such mitochondrial introgression
patterns have indeed been found in several closely related
species of Drosophila [58,59] and in species of the blowfly
genus Protocalliphora [60]. Wolbachia are present in both B.
kissophila and B. praetiosa [23]. It is possible that the different haplotypes observed within B. kissophila are a consequence of selective sweeps caused by different Wolbachia
strains. Additionally, interspecific transfer of mitochondrial DNA from B. kissophila to B. praetiosa could also
explain the paraphyly observed for B. kissophila and B. praetiosa.

In conclusion, both mutations and hybridization can
explain the clonal diversity and paraphyletic patterns in B.
kissophila and B. praetiosa and both processes are possibly
driven by reproductive parasites. These processes might
cause similar divergence patterns in other Bryobia species
and explain incongruencies between 28S and COI phylogenies for B. rubrioculus as well.
The observed high levels of intraspecific variation at the
COI gene have serious consequences for the use of COI as
a tool for identifying species (DNA barcoding; [61,62]).
Although the region we investigated is a different COI
fragment than is usually used in barcoding studies (the
Folmer fragment; [63]), a similar pattern may be expected
for the total COI gene [30]. DNA barcoding assumes that
intraspecific variation is lower than interspecific variation.
A standard threshold of 2% divergence for identifying species has been proposed [61]. With intensive intraspecific
sampling over a wide geographic range we demonstrated
that intraspecific variation can be extensive and easily
exceeds interspecific differences, thus undermining current barcoding assumptions. Similar high levels of
intraspecific variation are not restricted to Bryobia mites
but were also observed in other tetranychid mites [30].
Origin of asexuality
The 28S phylogeny shows that the asexual Bryobia species
do not form a monophyletic clade (Figure 5). This implies
two possible scenarios for the origin of asexuality in the
genus: 1) asexuality originated once, with subsequent
radiation of asexuals and at least two independent reversals to sexuality or 2) asexuality originated multiple times
(at least seven times; Figure 5). The first scenario is the
most parsimonious, because only three transitions (one
from sexual to asexual, and two from asexual to sexual)
are needed instead of seven (sexual to asexual) to explain
the observed phylogenetic pattern. However, there are
several arguments against this scenario.

First, reversals to sexuality are less likely than origins of
asexuality. Once a species becomes strictly asexual, mutations are expected to accumulate in traits involved in sexual reproduction [2,64,65] and the capacity to produce
sexually is lost very quickly. This process will also operate
in species where asexuality is caused by bacteria. In species
with bacterial-induced asexuality, including B. praetiosa,
experiments have shown that females fail to reproduce
sexually after removal of the bacteria [23,51,66-68]. Moreover, Groot and Breeuwer [69] showed that in Brevipalpus
mites where Cardinium causes asexual reproduction, some
strains lost the Cardinium bacteria but still reproduced
asexually. Apparently, loss of Cardinium did not result in
a reversal to sexuality. Although we can not exclude the
possibility of reversal to sexuality [25], the aforementioned studies suggest that it is not likely.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/153

Second, although we performed an extensive geographic
sampling of species, sampling of the genus is not complete. For example, van Eyndhoven [18] described thirteen species as members of the 'Berlesei' group, three of
which are sexual. We have only sampled four species of
this group, one of which reproduces sexually. If more sexual species belong to this group, we need to invoke more
reversals to sexuality in order to maintain the hypothesis
that asexuality has a single origin in Bryobia (Figure 5).
Third, several independent infections with Wolbachia
could explain independent origins of asexuality. Asexuality in B. praetiosa is caused by Wolbachia [23]. It is possible
that Wolbachia or other reproductive parasites are widespread in this genus, causing asexuality in all asexual species. Wolbachia strain diversity and abundance in Bryobia
has not been studied so far.
The above arguments suggest that multiple origins of asexuality are likely. At least seven independent origins of
asexuality are required based on our current phylogenetic
information (Figure 5). Radiation of asexuals within particular clades remains a possibility, especially because sexual species seem rare within the genus. The general
thought that asexuals are always single lineages branching
off from closely related sexual relatives is certainly not
valid within Bryobia. Asexuality seems evolutionary successful, at least in the short term. Asexuality in Bryobia is
functionally apomictic, resulting in the maintenance of
heterozygosity [23]. This may contribute to the success of
asexual Bryobia species, as high levels of heterozygosity are
assumed to be advantageous (heterosis or overdominance; [70]). In other haplodiploid systems parthenogenesis leads to complete homozygosity [71-73].
Additionally, bacterial parasites can play a role in the
adaptive success of asexuals. Wolbachia has been found in
six Bryobia species so far [23]. Generally, asexual clones are
considered genetically identical if they are identical at
their own genomic DNA. However, such genetically identical clones may harbor different bacterial strains. Differences in bacterial composition can influence the fitness of
clones, as bacterial symbionts may play a role in protection against parasitoid attack [74] or against fungal pathogens [75]. These differences, and also changes in
bacterial composition through occasional horizontal
transfers, could play a role in the adaptive success of asexual Bryobia species, and of asexuals in general. Furthermore, bacterial genes can be transferred to the host DNA.
Recently, Dunning Hotopp et al. [76] showed that an
almost complete Wolbachia genome was transferred to
genome of its host, Drosophila ananassae. Other arthropod
and nematode species also contained fragments of Wolbachia DNA in their genome, indicating that lateral gene
transfers occur more often [76]. If occurring in asexuals,

such transfers undermine the strict clonality of these asexuals and may play a crucial role in their long term evolutionary success.

Conclusion
Asexuality is widespread in the genus Bryobia. The hypothesis that asexuality originated multiple times is the most
plausible, given the fact that reversals to sexuality are
unlikely and that more sexual species might be found. A
likely explanation is that Wolbachia, which causes asexuality in at least two Bryobia species [23], has independently
infected different Bryobia species. The high prevalence of
asexual species is in contradiction with the general idea
that asexuals are single lineages among sexual sister species. Clonal diversity within the asexual species B. kissophila is very high at the mitochondrial DNA. Several
distinct clades are found that are paraphyletic to B. praetiosa. Past hybridization events and an elevated fixation rate
of mutations are possible causes for this high clonal diversity. Reproductive parasites like Wolbachia can influence
these processes. Moreover, such parasites may play an
important role in the evolutionary success of asexuals.
