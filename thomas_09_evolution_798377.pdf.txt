Abstract
Background: Senescence is integral to the flowering plant life-cycle. Senescence-like processes
occur also in non-angiosperm land plants, algae and photosynthetic prokaryotes. Increasing
numbers of genes have been assigned functions in the regulation and execution of angiosperm
senescence. At the same time there has been a large expansion in the number and taxonomic
spread of plant sequences in the genome databases. The present paper uses these resources to
make a study of the evolutionary origins of angiosperm senescence based on a survey of the
distribution, across plant and microbial taxa, and expression of senescence-related genes.
Results: Phylogeny analyses were carried out on protein sequences corresponding to genes with
demonstrated functions in angiosperm senescence. They include proteins involved in chlorophyll
catabolism and its control, homeoprotein transcription factors, metabolite transporters, enzymes
and regulators of carotenoid metabolism and of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Evolutionary timelines
for the origins and functions of particular genes were inferred from the taxonomic distribution of
sequences homologous to those of angiosperm senescence-related proteins. Turnover of the light
energy transduction apparatus is the most ancient element in the senescence syndrome. By
contrast, the association of phenylpropanoid metabolism with senescence, and integration of
senescence with development and adaptation mediated by transcription factors, are relatively
recent innovations of land plants. An extended range of senescence-related genes of Arabidopsis was
profiled for coexpression patterns and developmental relationships and revealed a clear carotenoid
metabolism grouping, coordinated expression of genes for anthocyanin and flavonoid enzymes and
regulators and a cluster pattern of genes for chlorophyll catabolism consistent with functional and
evolutionary features of the pathway.
Conclusion: The expression and phylogenetic characteristics of senescence-related genes allow a
framework to be constructed of decisive events in the evolution of the senescence syndrome of
modern land-plants. Combining phylogenetic, comparative sequence, gene expression and
morphogenetic information leads to the conclusion that biochemical, cellular, integrative and
adaptive systems were progressively added to the ancient primary core process of senescence as
the evolving plant encountered new environmental and developmental contexts.

Background
We present evidence that the genes and metabolism representing the core of the process of senescence in modern
land-plants can be traced back to primaeval unicellular
photoautotrophs and that specific elaborations and regulatory mechanisms have been progressively added to the
senescence program at decisive points during plant evolution. Senescence is a prominent characteristic of
angiosperm morphogenesis and ecology. The term is
applied at all levels of plant biology, from processes at the
biome-wide scale that define the season of autumn in
temperate climates [1,2] through to the cellular dimension in the terminal development of individual tissues
and organs [3,4]. Plant senescence is commonly considered to be programmed [5] and several genes have been
identified as essential for normal initiation and/or execution of the syndrome [6,7]. Here we focus particularly on
the metabolism of pigments in green tissues and the
colorful lateral organs and structures of angiosperms [8,9]
and, based on comparative cell biology and protein
sequence relationships across the evolutionary range of
plants and their phototrophic ancestors, we reconstruct a
progression of genetic events leading to the establishment
of senescence as an essential element in the terrestrial
plant life-cycle.
Evolutionary origin of photosynthetic pigments
A challenging question sometimes asked of biologists by
children and physicists is: if leaves are solar panels, why
are they green and not black [10-12]? This query in turn
implies further questions about the nature of the earliest
life-forms, how they used light as an energy-source, how
the photosynthetic apparatus became organised and reorganised during evolution and (of particular relevance to
the present paper) the evolutionary origin of pigment
metabolism and its control in plant development. The
light absorption profile of chlorophyll-based green membranes is characterised by a broad gap in the middle of the
visible wavelength range. It has been proposed that the
earliest phototrophs had light receptors that occupied the
centre of the spectrum between the red and blue peaks of
chlorophyll-based green membranes, and that chlorophyll evolved as a complementary pigment, filling in the
missing wavelengths at the edges of the spectrum. According to this hypothesis the earliest photoautotrophs may
have been similar to purple bacteria in using bacteriorhodopsin as the light-intercepting pigment-protein and bacteriochlorophyll at the reaction centre, driving a proton
pump coupled to ATPase [10,13,14]. Phylogenetic analyses based on genes for photosynthesis as well as other
markers such as rRNA and heat shock proteins are suggesting a number of alternative trajectories for the early evolution of pigment metabolism and organisation, but the
widespread prevalence of horizontal gene transfer makes
it difficult to agree the definitive scenario [13,15]. We can
be certain, however, that isoprenoid-derived pigments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/163

continued to carry out the function of intercepting light in
the middle of the visible spectrum while chlorophyll
adopted an increasingly prominent role in light harvesting as well as charge separation, leading to modern streptophytes including land plants.
Phylogenetic analysis of genes for Mg-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis indicates that anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms
are ancestral to oxygen-evolving cyanobacteria and that
the pathway in purple bacteria may be closest to that of
the most ancient phototrophs [16]. By contrast to chlorophyll synthesis, the catabolic side of chlorophyll metabolism has not hitherto been examined in molecular
phylogenetic terms, though a detailed survey of the enzymological properties of RCC reductase (RCCR) in a range
of terrestrial species carried out by Hörtensteiner et al.
[17] allowed some inferences to be drawn about the evolution of the pigment breakdown pathway in land plants.
In the present paper we analyse the occurrence of genes
for two key enzymes of chlorophyll catabolism (phaeophorbide a oxygenase – PaO – and RCCR; [18]), one posttranslational regulator (Sgr; [19]) and two catabolite
transporters (WBC23 and MRP2; [20]) in the lineages
leading to modern angiosperms.
From photosynthetic eukaryotes to the invasion of land by
plants
The significant early events in the evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus comprised diversification of reaction
centre and antenna structure, based on chlorophyll and
isoprenoids, and organisation and delineation of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. According to
Strother [21] 'the endosymbiotic origin of plastids...indicates that perhaps all of the original host cell lineages for
the algae were phagotrophic...' Based on nutrient conditions and the evolution of food webs in the Palaeo- and
Meso-proterozoic ocean [21,22], it is reasonable to suppose that facultative autotrophy would have been the rule
in early photosynthetic organisms. The formation of
endosymbiotic relationships resulting in the evolution of
plastid-containing eukaryotic cells probably occurred just
once in the lineage, although there is evidence of several
secondary events, including horizontal gene transfer, too
[23-25]. It seems likely that the foundation endosymbiont
was mixotrophic in character and that the earliest green
eukaryotes were facultatively autotrophic [21,26]. This is
significant for the origin of plant senescence because
aspects of the biochemistry and cell biology of plastids in
terrestrial plants suggest that the transition from chloroplast to the plastids of senescing leaves (gerontoplasts) or
fruit and floral parts (chromoplasts) is a change in status
from auto- to hetero-trophy [27]. A strikingly senescencelike response during the change of trophic condition on
removal of light and nitrogen source is seen in cultures of
Auxenochlorella (formerly Chlorella) protothecoides. Cells

enzyme activities that resemble those of senescing mesophyll cells [28], and a red pigment is secreted into the
medium [29-31]. Chemical analysis shows the pigment to
be a bilin derived from chlorophyll by removal of phytol
and Mg and by oxygenolysis of the methine bridge
between pyrrole groups A and B [32]. This structure and
its biochemical origin relate directly to the metabolic
sequence for chlorophyll catabolism in angiosperms [33].
Similar production of chlorophyll catabolites has been
reported in a Chlamydomonas mutant [34]. The luciferin of
the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula is also
a bilin degradation product of chlorophyll, though in this
case the chlorin macrocycle is opened between rings A and
D [35]. A luciferin of similar structure is found in the krill
organism Euphausia pacifica [35,36], presumably originating in ingested phytoplankton. We conclude that at least
part of the enzymic pathway of chlorophyll catabolism
was present during the aquatic phase of plant evolution
and this has led us to seek phylogenetic continuity
between genes for trophic responses and pigment catabolism from unicellular algae to angiosperms.

vated during plant senescence are transcription factors of
the Wrky family. Sequence analysis of Wrky53, the most
intensively studied of the senescence-related signal-transduction components [44], suggests the point during evolution at which such factors may have became available
for networking with the core senescence program.

Amongst the genes expressed during the auto- to heterotrophic transition in Auxenochlorella is an amino acid permease, dee4 [28]. Transcripts of the Arabidopsis homologue of dee4, At1g44100, were identified in isolated
nuclei of Arabidopsis phloem cells, suggesting a role in
nitrogen translocation from sources to sinks [37]. Bleecker
[38] considered nutrient salvage to be a driving force in
the evolution of the plant senescence program. Nutrient
recovery implies structural differentiation into source and
destination tissues, with a transport system between them
[39,40]. To assess their relevance to the evolution of nutrient relations during senescence, we carried out protein
sequence tree and expression analyses of dee4 and
At1g44100 respectively. We also analysed a NAC gene
with a regulatory function in organ development and
senescence. Uauy et al. [41] isolated NAM-2, a NAC transcription factor, by positional cloning and demonstrated
a regulatory role in nutrient redistribution from senescing
leaves to developing grain in cereals. AtNAP, a NAM-like
factor, expression of which is closely associated with the
senescence process of Arabidopsis rosette leaves [42], was
included in our analyses of expression and taxonomic distribution.

Appearance of coloured organs in land-plants driven by
coevolution
As well as promoting diversification of structure, and
adaptation to terrestrial ecological niches, achieving landfall eventually exposed plants to new biotic and abiotic
interactions. The ancient role of carotenoids as quenchers
of excess light energy intercepted by photosystems [45]
acquired new significance in environments where mismatch between photon flux, temperature and the availability of water and nutrients is the rule and a strongly
oxidising atmosphere supports the uncontrolled propagation of damage by reactive chemical species. Coevolution
between plant pigments and the visual systems of insects
and other animals introduced a new role for carotenoids
as signalling molecules, advertising to pollinators, to dispersers or to herbivores and other predators [46,47].
Investigations of the phylogenetic origin of carotenoids in
relation to colour changes in senescence and ripening are
frustrated by the ubiquity and antiquity of the corresponding genes and the inordinate degree of horizontal
gene transfer apparent in the evolutionary record [48,49].
Nevertheless, we have identified four genes associated
with the subcellular organisation and developmental regulation of carotenoid metabolism in senescing and ripening tissues that provide insights into how this aspect of
senescence may have evolved. Lipid bodies (plastoglobules) accumulate during the transition from chloroplast to
gerontoplast or chromoplast [50]. They have been
observed in the plastids of Auxenochlorella during the
switch from auto- to hetero-trophy [51]. Plastoglobulelike lipid bodies are very widely distributed amongst
prokaryotes [52]. Existing and newly-synthesised carotenoids concentrated in plastoglobules are responsible for
the colours of fruits and senescing leaves in some species
[8,53,54]. We examined the distribution of sequences
similar to PAP-Fibrillin, a plastoglobule protein with
functions in plastid development and stress responses
[55].

From endosymbiont origins of photosynthetic eukaryotes
to angiosperms is a sequence of major events including
differentiation of two- and three-dimensional body plans
and emergence from the aquatic environment onto land
[43]. Cell specialisation, intra- and inter-cellular signalling and elaboration of body plan are regulated by homeoprotein transcription factors and the integration of
senescence into morphogenetic and adaptive programs is
likely to be apparent in the phylogenetic record. Prominent amongst the regulators of signalling networks acti-

Carotenoid metabolism in senescence and ripening is
closely integrated with the transdifferentiation of chloroplasts into gerontoplasts and chromoplasts. Chromoplast
development is regulated by Or (dnaJ-type) chaperone/
transcription factors [56], two of which we included in
our analyses. Carotenoid derivatives also have hormonal
and cell signalling roles in plants. Genes of the Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase (CCD) group are known to participate in regulation of a number of aspects of
development, including leaf senescence [57]. Accordingly,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:163

we carried out an analysis of the protein sequences related
to that of senescence-associated CCD8.
Another major class of pigments in land-plants comprises
products of phenylpropanoid metabolism [58]. Anthocyanins are considered to have adaptive value both in stress
responses and in signalling to beneficial or predatory animals, and there is an extensive literature on the significance of the range of possible anthocyanin functions in
senescing leaves [8,59]. By contrast with carotenoids,
which are highly hydrophobic and confined to the
lipophilic environment of plastid membranes and plastoglobules, anthocyanins are water-soluble and accumulate in the cell vacuole [60]. The behaviour of the two
classes of pigment during senescence is indicative of the
state of their respective subcellular compartments. The
anthocyanin responsible for the red colour of autumn
leaves is commonly cyanidin-3-glucoside. The final step
in its synthesis is catalysed by anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase, encoded by the Bronze1 (Bz1) gene [61]. A
myb transcription factor C1 regulates expression of the
anthocyanin pathway [62]. We included Bz1 and C1 in
our evolutionary survey of senescence-associated genes.
As a senescence-related marker for the evolution of specific tonoplast membrane functions we also selected
MRP2, a chlorophyll catabolite transporter [63]. The proteome of the vegetative plant cell vacuole is consistent
with a lytic role in defence and tissue differentiation [64].
Transposon insertional mutagenesis of See2, a gene of
maize encoding a vacuolar processing endopeptidase
(VPE) has a range of effects on plant development, including delay of senescence [65]. We carried out an evolutionary survey of See2 and confirmed senescence-related
expression of the Arabidopsis homologue At4g32940.
Relationships between the ontogeny and phylogeny of
plant senescence
As well as analysing the distribution across plant and
microbial taxa of the selection of senescence-related protein sequences described above, we applied the clustering
tools in Genevestigator to an extended group of Arabidopsis genes with likely functions in senescence, with the
object of identifying common regulatory units. It is also of
interest to seek evidence for homologies between terminal
physiological changes in different organs, which in turn
would begin to answer the question as to whether there is
a common senescence program which operates, with variations, in all plant cells, tissues and organs.

Results
Gene expression profiles, protein structures and molecular phylogenies are discussed in relation to chlorophyll
catabolism and its control, homeoprotein transcription
factors with known functions in senescence, metabolite
transporters, carotenoid metabolism and anthocyanin
biosynthesis (Table 1). Many senescence-associated genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/163

have been described but the physiological functions of
relatively few of them have been established, and fewer
still have been demonstrated to be necessary for initiation
or execution of the syndrome [6,7,9]. Those listed in Table
1 have been shown, by mutation, transgenic manipulation or biochemical analysis, to have defined roles in
senescence. The tools of phylogenetic analysis were
applied to amino acid rather than nucleotide sequences to
avoid difficulties with codon usage across the very wide
taxonomic scale considered in this study, though where a
particular taxon yielded no hit when a critical protein was
BLASTed, we checked for the existence of corresponding
pseudogenes or other untranslated nucleotide sequence.
Since we are principally interested in the first detectable
occurrence and subsequent evolutionary continuity of
particular protein sequences, we have not explicitly distinguished between orthologues and paralogues, a known
issue when establishing phylogenetic and functional relationships [66]. The relative paucity of sequence data for
many of the species examined is an acknowledged limitation in this study but, with a few exceptions discussed in
detail, the analyses reported here make a consistent and
biologically plausible picture.
In most cases the trees are presented in unrooted radial
form and are based on global alignments of protein
sequences from one or two representative genera of each
major taxon. Tree topologies for individual proteins often
deviated from those predicted by the evolutionary relationships between the corresponding taxa. The non-congruence of gene and species trees is a well-described
feature of molecular phylogenies and indeed is statistically to be expected [67]. Bootstrap values and branch
lengths with their error estimations are presented in Additional Files 1 and 2 respectively. The range of senescencerelated sequences (Table 1) is subsequently extended (Figure 1) for cluster analysis to reveal units of coexpression
and developmental relationships amongst plant structures with respect to their senescence programs.
Chlorophyll catabolism
The observation of bilin products of chlorophyll catabolism in unicellular algae focuses attention on the enzymes
responsible for opening the chlorin macrocycle, namely
PaO and RCCR. Figure 2 is a Genevestigator heat map representation of the relative expression of all the Arabidopsis
genes whose protein trees are reported in the present
paper, including RCCR and PaO (AGI accession numbers
respectively At4g37000 and At3g44880). Expression of
RCCR is not particularly strong in senescing leaves. It gives
a noticeably weak signal in roots and other non-green
structures like pollen. PaO is also largely undetectable in
non-green tissues but exhibits clear differential expression
during development, being most prominent in senescing
leaf, cauline leaf and sepal.

Sequence similarities to the protein corresponding to
RCCR gene At4g37000 (UniProt accession number for the
barley sequence Q8LDU4; [68]) were analysed. Figure 3
shows the relationships between these proteins from representative genera in tree form. Three major groupings are
apparent. Angiosperms form one clade, with monocots
and dicots resolved within it. Non-angiosperm land
plants are grouped together. Cyanobacteria form a third
clade, characterised by relatively high E scores, although
examination of the sequences for conserved domains
identified these cyanobacterial proteins as members of the
RCCR family. For example SMART analysis recognised the
RCCR conserved domain in the Anabaena protein, recording an extremely low E score of 4.80e-159. Protein and
DNA BLAST searches, both of general databases and of the
JGI Chlamydomonas reinhardtii site, failed to record a single
hit within the green algae. The significance of the discontinuity in the distribution of RCCR across phyla is considered in the Discussion section.

The tree representation of proteins similar to the Arabidopsis PaO gene At3g44880 (UniProt accession number
NP_190074; Figure 4) reveals that the land plants form a
group of closely related sequences (E value of 0). The
cyanobacteria, represented by Cyanothece and Lyngbya,
make a distinct cluster, the green algae Chlamydomonas
and Ostreococcus make another and the proteobacteria
Phenylobacterium and Ralstonia are more remotely related.
The protein sequences of eukaryotes and cyanobacterial
species include conserved Rieske Fe-S and PaO motifs
(Figure 5). The Ralstonia sequence has a Rieske Fe-S
domain near the N terminus but no PaO motif (Figure
5c). This is generally true of bacterial sequences with similarity to PaO. The Ralstonia protein is recognised as a
member of the HcaE phenylpropionate dioxygenase
multidomain group, which may be close to the evolutionary source of the PaO gene of phototrophs. It is striking
that the cyanobacterial branch has a higher support value
and their sequences have a higher similarity to those of

land plants than do those of the eukaryotic green algae
(Figure 4).
Stay-green (Sgr) is a post-translational regulator of chlorophyll-protein complex degradation [19,69,70]. The Genevestigator profile shows a tightly-specified expression
pattern, with highest transcript abundance in senescent
leaf and significant signal in floral parts (Figure 2). The
sequence of the protein corresponding to Arabidopsis Sgr1
gene At4g22920 (UniProt accession number NP_567673)
was aligned with similar proteins from other species and
the results were used to generate the tree shown in Figure
6. Dicots, monocots and non-flowering land plants form
three distinct groupings, with low E values that gradually
increase with evolutionary distance from the reference
species. Between the land plant and green algal clades
there is a marked step up in E value. Grouped with the
algae is a well-supported outlying clade, comprising a
number of firmicutes (clostridia and bacilli). We further
analysed the features of the Sgr-like genes in these species
to determine whether Sgr may be indicative of a photosynthetic Clostridium ancestor, possibly something like the
firmicute Heliobacterium. The rRNA [71,72] and Sgr trees

are similar (Figure 7), but not congruent, and only 14 out
of a total of 283 genomes searched (BLASTP at the JGI
IMG site) contained genes encoding Sgr homologues.
These were restricted to the genera Clostridium (11 of 44
genomes) and Bacillus (3 of 41 genomes) and there was
no obvious conservation of genome context of Sgr
between these organisms. We therefore conclude that Sgr
is either an ancestral feature, which has been lost in all but
a few remaining lineages; or, more likely, a feature that
has been acquired more than once via horizontal gene
transfer (Figure 7).
Aubry [20] identified WBC23, a transporter in the plastid
envelope responsible for removing the linear tetrapyrrole
product of the PaO-RCCR reaction. The corresponding
gene, At5g06530, is strongly expressed in senescing leaves
(Figure 2). ATP-dependent membrane transporters are
very widely distributed across all eukaryotes [73], as evidenced by hits, with low E values, on the cnidarian Nematostella and the choanoflagellate Monosiga when BLASTed
against Arabidopsis WBC23 (UniProt code NP_850781;
Figure 8). Land plants group together, with clear discrimination
into
monocots,
dicots
and
mosses.

Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus are associated at some
distance from the land plants and each other. At higher E
values, but still significantly less than chance, BLAST also
identifies alignments with proteins from representatives
of various insect groups.
Cell and tissue specialisation
In a study of genes expressed during Arabidopsis leaf senescence, Hinderhofer and Zentgraf [44] identified Wrky53
as a transcription factor with a major coordinating role in
senescence regulation. Phylogenetic analysis of the Wrky
family by Zhang and Wang [74] established that Wrky53
is a member of Group 3 that appeared before divergence
of monocots and dicots but later than diversification of
the bryophytes 160 – 330 million years ago (mya).
Wrky53 is expressed exclusively in mature and senescing
leaves (Figure 2), suggesting a role beginning in the earliest phase of senescence. Sequence similarities to the protein corresponding to Wrky53 gene At4g23810 (UniProt
accession number NP_194112) were analysed and the
resulting tree topology was in agreement with that of
Zhang and Wang [74], with the exception of the appearance of a single hit in Chlamydomonas (Figure 9). The E
score for this protein is 2e-11 and analysis of conserved
domains reveals two Wrky superfamily sequences with Evalues of 9.7e-33 and 1.26e-35 respectively (Figure 9). We
conclude that this represents a true algal Wrky53 homologue and is evidence that the appearance of Group 3

Wrkys may have been significantly earlier than the 330
mya originally inferred.
During senescence metabolites are relocated within the
cell, from tissue to tissue and from source to sink organs.
Uauy et al. [41] isolated a NAC transcription factor that
corresponded to a major QTL for nutrient mobilisation
from vegetative tissues during cereal grain-fill. Guo and
Gan [42] also identified a senescence-associated NAC factor (AtNAP, AGI At1g69490) in Arabidopsis. Figure 2 reiterates the expression patterns reported by Guo and Gan
[42], confirming strong upregulation in senescing leaves
and high levels in cauline leaf, sepal and petal. Alignment
of the AtNAP protein (UniProt NP_564966) showed similarity to the cereal sequence. The tree based on protein
sequence alignments is presented in Figure 10. Exhaustive
protein and nucleotide BLAST searches support the conclusion that NAP- and NAM-like proteins are exclusively
found in land plants.
A gene encoding an amino acid permease (dee4, UniProt
Q9XFY8) is upregulated when Auxenochlorella protothecoides is transferred from auto- to hetero-trophic culture
conditions; the Arabidopsis homologue (At1g44100) is
also upregulated in senescing leaves (Figure 2) and has
been identified in phloem [37]. Similar proteins to dee4
occur in angiosperms, mosses and conifers but are not
present in taxa that diverged before the appearance of
green algae (Figure 11).

Gerontoplasts and chromoplasts
Plastids differentiate, dedifferentiate and morph from one
type to another in a network of developmental transitions
(Figure 12; [75-78]). Orange and red carotenoids are
unmasked, concentrated or synthesised de novo in gerontoplasts and chromoplasts during senescence and ripening [8] and are sequestered in plastoglobules that become
abundant as chloroplasts transdifferentiate [55,79]. We
examined the expression and sequence relationships of
Arabidopsis PAP-Fibrillin (UniProt NP_192311, AGI
At4g04020), a plastoglobule-associated protein [55].
Genevestigator profiling shows expression to be absent
from roots and to be prominent in cotyledons, floral parts
and leaves (Figure 2). The protein tree for Fibrillin (Figure
13) reveals dicot and monocot clusters and a conifer
branch with a comparatively low bootstrap value. Eukaryotic unicellular green algae and cyanobacteria make a distinct separate group. The Ostreococcus sequence with a
high E score appears to be a chimeric protein comprising
two additional FHA (forkhead-associated, putative
nuclear-signalling) domains, separated from each other
and the Fibrillin domain by regions of low complexity
(Figure 13).

The gene Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase8 (CCD8;
UniProt NP_195007, AGI At4g32810) has a regulatory
function in branch production, root growth, flower development and leaf senescence [57]. It is mostly expressed in
shoots, particularly hypocotyl tissues, stem, node and
senescent leaf (Figure 2). The protein is highly conserved
from proteobacteria (eg Coxiella) to angiosperms (Figure
14) and a search for conserved domains establishes that
CCD8 and its homologues are members of the RPE65 retinal pigment epithelial membrane protein superfamily
which includes neoxanthin cleavage enzymes in plants
and lignostilbene-α, β-dioxygenase in bacteria.
The Or genes of Brassica encode proteins of the dnaJ chaperone class that play an important role in the differentiation of chromoplasts [56,80]. At5g61670 is the Arabidopsis
gene corresponding to the cauliflower Or protein
ABH07405 (UniProt), and is referred to here as OrI. It is
expressed in floral parts, cotyledons and in cauline and
senescent leaves (Figure 2). At5g06130 and NP_851031
are the AGI and UniProt codes for a second Arabidopsis Orlike dnaJ gene and protein respectively, designated OrII.
The expression profile of this gene is broadly similar to
that of At5g61670 (Figure 2), with somewhat stronger

expression in senescing leaf, petal, stamen and pedicel.
Trees of sequence relationships for OrI and OrII are presented in Figure 15. Both proteins are highly conserved
from prasinophyceans to angiosperms. Prokaryotes gave
no significant BLAST hit. The occurrence of Or-like genes
in plants that do not differentiate chromoplasts, and their
upregulation in a range of tissues including floral parts
and senescing leaves (Figure 2), suggest that they may
have a more generic function in plastid transdifferentiation.
Vacuoles
Anthocyanin production and leaf yellowing are associated
with senescence responses to nitrogen limitation, but are
genetically independent [81]. We analysed the expression
and protein sequence relationships of two genes with

functions in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Bronze1 (Bz1)
encodes the glycosyl transferase that synthesises the red
vacuolar pigment cyanidin-3-glucoside. Zea Bz1 (UniProt
P16167) was aligned with similar sequences; the homologous Arabidopsis gene is AGI At5g17050. The anthocyanin pathway is under the control of myb transcription
factor C1 (UniProt accession number of Zea C1 P10290;
AGI code of the homologous Arabidopsis gene
At4g34990). Both genes are widely expressed in different
organs and tissues (Figure 2). Bz1 is most prominent in
senescing leaf. C1 is also expressed in senescing leaf but is
most strongly represented in stigma and hypocotyl tissues. The Bz1 tree reveals the occurrence of homologues
in angiosperms, conifers and mosses (Figure 16). At an E
value of 1e-08, only a single BLAST hit was recorded for a
non-tracheophyte. The Chlamydomonas protein has a UDP

glycosyl transferase region towards the C terminal end but
low similarity to Bz1 elsewhere in the polypeptide. A
BLAST search against the Chlamydomonas protein identifies other plant UDP glycosyl transferases, but E scores are
high, and the algal protein aligns more closely with a
range of nucleoside glycosyl transferases from metazoa.
We conclude that this algal protein has a distant structural
relationship to tracheophyte Bz1-like sequences but functions as a transferase in a different metabolic pathway
from that leading to anthocyanin synthesis. It follows that
the anthocyanin pathway appeared relatively late in the
evolution of senescence processes, around the time of
cryptogam diversification. By contrast, genes related to
C1, the myb transcription factor responsible for regulating
expression of anthocyanin synthesis, are well represented
throughout plant taxa, from Zea to Ostreococcus (Figure
17). BLAST also identifies similar genes in the actinomycete Frankia and other bacteria.
The final products of chlorophyll catabolism are deposited in the vacuole. They are moved across the tonoplast
membrane by ATP mediated transporters of the MRP type
[63]. MRP2 (AGI At2g34660) is expressed in senescent
and cauline leaves as well as sepal, stamen and root tissues
(Figure 2). Multidrug-resistance transporter proteins like

AtMRP2 are very widely distributed across plants and animals. The tree of the corresponding protein (UniProt
NP_181013) identifies a group of closely-related structures within angiosperms, mosses and green algae. Interestingly the MRP2-like protein of the predatory bacterium
Bdellovibrio aligns to Arabidopsis with a lower E score than
the cyanobacterial homologue (Figure 18a). BLAST also
identifies a more distantly-diverged, but still highly similar, branch consisting of protozoa (Placozoa, Choanocyte) and vertebrates. The algal and angiosperm MRP2like sequences have similar domain structures (Figure
18b, c).
As well as representing a destination for pigments and
their catabolites, the vacuole has complex functions in
intracellular turnover, lytic processes and defence against
biotic invasion. See2 (UniProt CAB64545) is the product
of a Zea gene originally identified amongst those upregulated during flag leaf senescence [82]. It is a representative
of the VPE group of protein-processing legumains and
may function as part of a proteolytic cascade, rather in the
manner of the caspases involved in apoptosis [83]. The
Arabidopsis homologue (At4g32940) is most strongly
expressed in senescent and cauline leaf, with some significant signal in petal, sepal, xylem and cork (Figure 2).

indicates an unknown, unclassifiable or hypothetical protein). The Genevestigator heat map shown in Figure 20
clusters these genes according to profile and tissue, in the
order left to right in which they are listed in Figure 1. The
distribution of colour codes indicates blocks of genes with
common functions and coordinated expression patterns.
Tissues with similar complements of expressed genes are
hierarchically arranged close to each other. The gene and
tissue associations presented in Figure 20 are suggestive of
developmental and evolutionary relationships that are
considered further in the Discussion section below.

Discussion
BLAST identified similar proteins in angiosperms, conifers, mosses and green algae (Figure 19). A distantly
diverged group comprises marine myxobacteria, diverse
vertebrate and invertebrate taxa.
Cluster analysis of senescence-related genes
In the evolution of the senescence program, genes would
be expected to show a degree of coordinate expression in
groupings that reflect phylogenetic trends. Similarly, a
consequence of the differentiation of plant tissues and
organs from ancestral structures is the sharing of common
senescence programs. We used the Genevestigator Clustering Analysis tool to look for relationships between a collection of Arabidopsis genes comprising those listed in
Table 1 and a further group that includes the results of a
search of the TAIR database for senescence-related genes.
Figure 1 lists a total of 63 genes, each of which is assigned

The present account of the evolutionary origins of plant
senescence seeks to follow the major features of the syndrome in angiosperms through the lineage of organisms
leading from the earliest phototrophs, as revealed by analysing sequence relationships among key proteins. Additional File 3 summarises innovations in the evolutionary
time-line that are relevant to the construction of a senescence program integrated into plant development and
adaptation, and represents a framework for the discussion
that follows. Figure 21 relates this time-line to the phylogenetic origins of the senescence-related genes analysed in
the present paper. The foundation of the argument developed here is that a core of primary metabolic processes
concerned with building and maintaining the photoreceptors of the earliest prokaryotes has been invested with
successive layers of adaptive metabolic and regulatory circuitry as factors in the evolution of complexity in trophic

status, life-cycle, anatomy, morphology, adaptation to
new environments and biotic and abiotic challenges.
Pre-endosymbiotic phase
The Archaeozoic and Mesoproterozoic eons lasted from
3800-1000 mya. Although the detailed phylogeny of this
period is difficult to infer from molecular analysis of contemporary prokaryotes [84], it is probable that the fundamental design of the photosynthetic apparatus was
established early, in the form of pigment-protein photoreceptors driving an ATP-generating proton pump [13]. The
ubiquity of genes for isoprenoid synthesis [49] is evidence
of their ancient and fundamental role in light interception
and photochemical quenching [45,85,86]. Genes for
(bacterio)chlorophyll biosynthesis have been used to create well-rooted trees leading back to the putative earliest
photosynthetic organisms [15]. Assembling complexes
requires translational regulation [87] and efficient facilitated shape-matching [88], to coordinate the supply of
structural elements. In modern autotrophs a major factor
in achieving stoichiometry is post-transcriptional culling
of excess unmatched components [89-91]. Thus in
mutants deficient in pigment or protein components of

photosystems, most of the genes responsible for building
the complexes are transcribed and translated normally,
but because they cannot make stable assemblages the proteins are degraded by fidelity-testing peptide hydrolases.
For example, Fu et al. [92] showed that the cyclophilin
AtCYP38 is required to stabilise thylakoid complexes in
Arabidopsis: mutants deficient in CYP38 make normal
amounts of photosystem structural components but these
fail to assemble correctly and are turned over. Significantly, the CYP38 gene (At3g01480) is strongly down-regulated in senescing compared with mature and juvenile
Arabidopsis leaves (data not shown). Xiong [15] described
how a functional photosynthetic apparatus could have
evolved in the earliest prokaryotes by multi-staged recruitment of reaction centre and antenna proteins with previously diverse evolutionary histories and functions. We
consider that disassembly of complexes is correspondingly hierarchical in origin. Phylogenetic analyses of plant
proteases [93] and of proteasome components and organisation [94] shows convincingly that the catabolic
machinery for protein turnover is as ancient as the Chlorobacteria and Proteobacteria at the base of the evolutionary tree.

Charge-separation is hazardous for pigment-protein reaction centres and here again there will be a requirement for
turnover systems to maintain functioning structures [95].
Genes specifying cellular systems for turning over photoreceptor complexes may therefore be expected to be
ancient and we hypothesise that the distribution of protein sequences implicated in some features of angiosperm
senescence represents evidence for continuity back to the
pre-endosymbiotic origins of green plants. Studies of their
function in chloroplast senescence suggest that Sgr and
PaO are components of a machine that destabilises thylakoid pigment-proteolipid complexes by removing chlorophyll and exposing the associated proteins to attack by
peptide hydrolases [19,65,96]. Plastoglobules play a part
in this process, receiving hydrophobic products released
from dismantled membranes, including carotenoids, phytol from chlorophyll and products of lipolysis [55,97].
The structural similarity between the PaO- and Fibrillinlike proteins of prokaryotic phototrophs and the corresponding proteins of angiosperms (Figures 4, 13) supports the proposition that these components of the
machinery for unpacking pigment-protein complexes are
ancient.

Endosymbiotic associations in the origin of eukaryotic
plants
The origin of the chloroplast as a cyanobacterium-protozoan symbiosis occurred, according to most estimates,
around 1500 mya or earlier [98], though there is an alternative view placing it as late as 600 mya [23]. The primary
event soon gave rise to two lineages, the glaucophytes and
the green plant/red algal group. Mixotrophy and opportunist organotrophy were probably well established in the
earliest phototrophic prokaryotes and, in response to
increasing competition for nutrients, vestiges of facultative trophic behaviour have persisted throughout the
period from the enslavement of the endosymbiotic ancestors of eukaryote organelles to the plastid differentiation
network of modern angiosperms (Figure 12; [24]). The
metabolism of green cells of angiosperms changes from
auto- to hetero-trophic as the photosynthetic apparatus is
remodelled during the transdifferentiation of chloroplasts
into chromoplasts or gerontoplasts. Light is a declining
source of energy in these cells and respiratory processes
become increasingly significant [99]. Fruit ripening in
many species, and leaf senescence in a few, is accompanied by a respiratory burst (climacteric; [100]). The amino
acid products of protein recycling are subjected to

transamination, deamination and amide synthesis to provide carbon skeletons for respiration while salvaging
nitrogen in a transportable form [101]. A gene encoding
an amino acid permease is upregulated when Auxenochlorella protothecoides is transferred from auto- to heterotrophic culture conditions; the Arabidopsis homologue is
also upregulated in senescing leaves (Figure 2). The exact
identity of the protease(s) responsible for releasing amino
acids from photosynthetic proteins is not agreed [102]. A
number of plastid-located proteases are known [90],
amongst which at least four (ClpP3, ClpD, FtsH7 and
FtsH8) are upregulated in senescence (Figure 20). BLAST
searches show that highly homologous sequences to all
four proteins are widely distributed across taxa including
phototrophic and non-phototrophic bacteria. There is evidence that Sgr is essential for making chlorophyll-binding
proteins available to proteases [9,69,89]. Sgr is not detectable in photosynthetic prokaryotes, although Sgr-like
sequences are present in some firmicutes, possibly as the
result of horizontal transfer (Figures 6, 7). We suggest that
Sgr was recruited to the system for dismantling pigmentproteolipid complexes when subcellular topology became
more complex with the appearance of the eukaryotic condition. This in turn suggests that protein mobilisation and

colour change in tracheophyte senescence have their origins in the intraplastidic turnover of pigment-proteins
related to regulated assembly of macromolecular complexes and trophic flexibility.
An alternative, or additional, mechanism for proteolysis
in senescence involves exchange of protein substrates
and/or proteases between plastids and vacuoles in as-yet
uncharacterised vesicles [103-105]. This would assign a
role in senescence to vacuolar proteases such as SAG12
([106]; Figure 20) and to components such as See2 (Figures 2, 19) that may trigger proteolytic cascades [83,107].
Martinez and Diaz [93] have studied the evolution in
plants of C1A papain-like cysteine endopeptidases

alignment with See2 is better than 1e-13 and for the C13
peptidase superfamily conserved domain E scores were of
the order of 1e-80. We conclude that VPE-like proteases are
present in Ostreococcus (Figure 19).
An ancient function of the cell vacuole is to act as an autolytic body in cell death. 'Metacaspases' (a name for vacuolar proteases that may function like the caspases of
apoptotic animal cells but which have little or no homology to them) have been implicated in a cell death program
in diatoms [109]. It is doubtful that autolysis plays a part
in the initiation and execution of the senescence program
in angiosperms [110] but it may be critical in the terminal
phase of tissue development when senescence is ending –
for example in vascular tissue where the cells are dead at
maturity [111,112] or as a cauterisation measure in senescent mesophyll [106,110]. We speculate that the progression from Ostreococcus to Volvox to Chlamydomonas shown
in Figure 19 may signify the appearance and development
of a capacity for proteolytic processing by See2-like VPEs
during the period of green alga evolution associated with
a new role for the vacuole in organelle protein turnover.
The auto- to hetero-trophic switch induced in Auxenochlorella protothecoides by light and nitrogen limitation is associated with excretion of bilin products of chlorophyll
catabolism [28]. It is not known whether such catabolites

have antibiotic or allelopathic properties, though they are
certainly highly photodynamic. Also unknown is the
transporter that moves bilins across the cell membrane.
ATP-dependent transporters that export chlorophyll catabolites from plastids to cytosol and from cytosol to vacuole have been identified in Arabidopsis and the
corresponding genes (At5g06530 encoding the plastid
envelope transporter, At2g34660 encoding one of the tonoplast MRP2 transporters) are upregulated during senescence (Figure 2). BLAST identifies algal sequences with
similarity to AtMRP2, and comparisons of domain structure suggest common functions (Figure 18). However the
sequence of the AtMRP2 protein has higher similarity to
that of AtMRP4 than to its Ostreococcus homologue. Both
AtMRP2 and AtMRP4 proteins have the conserved
domain structure of full-molecule ABC transporters, but
the former is located in the tonoplast whereas the latter is
a plasmalemma component [73]. Such an MRP in algae,
with similarities to both MRP2 and MRP4, would have the
expected properties of the transporter responsible for
ejecting chlorophyll catabolites from the cell. Subsequently, it is conceivable that tonoplast and plasmalemma transporter localisations and functions diverged as
the participation of the vacuole in chlorophyll catabolism
became established as part of a novel physiological module added downstream of bilin formation when multicellular plants emerged onto the land [113].

Development of multicellularity
The Ordovician-Silurian period (450-410 mya) saw the
rise of the charophytes, which are considered to link the
unicellular chlorophytes with the first land-plants. The
lack of sequence data for members of the Charophyta is a
major gap in the phylogenetic record, but it is possible to
identify features within charophyte algae likely to be relevant to senescence evolution, notably the elaboration of
multicellular morphology, branching, 3-D cell division
and interconnection of cells by plasmodesmata [43]. A
key genus is Coleochaete, which includes branching filaments and thallus-like parenchymatous forms. Molecular
phylogenies based on chloroplast and ribosomal
sequences put this group close to the evolutionary line
between unicellular chlorophyceans and bryophytes
[114].

The presence of lignin-like compounds in Coleochaete
[115] is evidence of a capacity for phenylpropanoid
metabolism which would have been the ancestral basis
for the elaboration of lignified vascular and mechanical
issues, and later the rise of flavonoid pigmentation, in the
land flora. Long-distance symplastic transport was already
well established in green algae, including charophytes,
and is observed in bryophytes alongside the beginnings of

vascular translocation structures [40]. Long-range nutrient
redistribution, from green cells in which the balance of
turnover favours net dismantling of macromolecules and
cell structures, is thus anatomically feasible in the charophytes.
The development of multicellular two- and three-dimensional forms changes the relationship between the plant
body and the external medium. Direct exchange of materials across the plasmalemma has to be subordinated to
the structural and physiological requirements of the tissue. It seems likely that this was the impetus for the evolution of more complex roles for the cell vacuole, which
took on the status of 'inner space', in a sense adopting the
role of a remnant of the ancestral aquatic milieu inside
each vegetative cell. Extensive studies of the vacuoles of
Chara and Nitella show them to perform sophisticated
functions in ionic regulation, hydraulic maintenance of
tissue morphology and turgor-driven cell wall growth
[116-118]. They are also highly lytic, sequestering a range
of proteases and other acid hydrolases [119-121]. The vacuole of charophytes thus possesses, or is en route to developing, most of the characteristics of the subcellular
compartment that functions in angiosperm growth and
senescence [122].

Plants invade the land
Green plants made landfall in the Silurian-Jurassic period,
more than 410 mya. In this new and hostile environment,
desiccation was avoided and ionic homeostasis maintained by the early development of an all-enveloping epidermal and cuticular 'space suit' [123] and a watertransport system [40,124]. The capacity for lysigeny and
schizogeny was established in the first land plants, in connection with both the differentiation of vascular systems
and the shedding of parts [124,125]. Along with mechanisms for smoothing out extreme variations in water-supply, it was necessary to establish physiological and
developmental adaptations to deal with wide fluctuations
in the inputs to photosynthesis. Many of the adjustments
to the primary events of light capture and CO2 assimilation within chloroplasts are regulated by systems present
in Chlamydomonas and other unicellular chlorophyceans
[45]. Atmospheric CO2 concentration 410 mya is believed
to have been around 3000 to 4000 ppmv [126]. This,
combined with exposure to light fluxes no longer attenu-

ated by the water-column, has led to the suggestion that
the move to the terrestrial environment stimulated carbon
fixation and utilisation to the point of incontinence – in
the words of Harper [127] 'the green plant may indeed be
a pathological overproducer of carbohydrates'. It allowed
plants to develop profligate, throw-away lifestyles based
on lysigeny and schizogeny on a vast scale. For example,
primitive trees such as Archaeopteris (359-349 mya) probably controlled canopy morphology through abscission
of lower megaphylls [128]. Abscission may have also been
important in dehiscence of sporangia even before it
became significant in vegetative shaping of plants [128],
and a deciduous Glossopteris flora was already well established in Gondwanaland during the Carboniferous era
[129]. Preserved senescent plastids have distinctive features that enable them to be identified in fossilised material [130]. Thomas and Sadras [131] discussed senescence
as a strategy evolved by early land plants to deal with the
promiscuous productivity of a photosynthetic machinery

a detoxification pathway to redirect the products of chlorophyll catabolism to the cell vacuole. The two activities
that make the link between the evolutionarily ancient first
section of the catabolic pathway and the cytosolic-vacuolar steps are RCCR and the envelope transporter WBC23.
The presence of the latter in Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus is identified by BLAST; BLAST analysis also records hits
on similar choanoflagellate and cnidarian sequences (Figure 8), suggesting that an ABC transporter similar to that
which moves straight-chain bilins across the plastid envelope was present at or before the evolution of the chloroplastic endosymbiont.

optimised for the relatively stable ancestral aquatic environment.
By leaving the water, plants lost the option of expelling
unwanted or aggressive metabolites directly from individual cells into the outside environment. To a great degree
the cell vacuole has taken over as the destination for such
compounds. Chlorophyll degradation during the
transdifferentiation of chloroplasts to gerontoplasts (Figure 12) illustrates this change in the relationship between
cells and their environment. The catabolic pathway of
chlorophyll in land plants is organised so as to limit photodynamic damage by free pigments. Chlorophylls and
their coloured derivatives must be moved around and
interconverted within strongly quenching microenvironments inside the plastid until the risk of photodamage is
finally removed by opening the tetrapyrrole ring [9]. Sgr,
PaO and Fibrillin are important participants in this phase
of the process. Algae like Auxenochlorella expel RCC, the
product of the PaO reaction, directly into the medium,
possibly via an MRP2/4-like transporter as discussed
above. Land plants, on the other hand, have requisitioned

Using site-specific mutagenesis methods, Pružinská et al.
[132] have shown unequivocally the in vivo role of RCCR
in chlorophyll catabolism; but the enzyme appears to
have some other function too, concerned with mitochondrial participation in programmed cell death [133]. The
occurrence of RCCR-like sequences is consistent with the
appearance of this enzyme at the point of land plant evolution [17], though there are BLAST hits in the cyanobacteria (Figure 3). Why is there a discontinuity in the
distribution of RCCR? Although there is a considerable
step up in E value between the land plants and cyanobacteria, the Nostoc and Anabaena proteins have all the structural features of RCCR when examined by the conserved
domain tools of NCBI BLAST and Pfam. BLASTing against
CYANOBASE (the Cyanobacteria genome database)
revealed weak similarity with phycoerythrobilin ferredoxin oxidoreductases, which may conceivably have been
the distant ancestral sources of plant RCCRs. BLASTing
the Nostoc punctiforme genome database reveals two genes
located side-by-side (Npun_R3279 and Npun_R3277).
They are highly similar and may represent a duplication.
Pfam recognises both proteins as possessing the conserved
domains of RCCR. Global transcription data are available
for Nostoc and show that 3277 is strongly expressed during
hormogonia differentiation but not in other developmental stages. By contrast 3279 was down-regulated during
hormogonia differentiation [134]. Nostoc is an extracellular symbiont or endophyte in the hornwort Anthoceros
[135], but an intracellular symbiont in the angiosperm
Gunnera [136]. The hormogonium phase is the one that
colonises the host. The available Anabaena genome (A variabilis) has only one RCCR-homologous sequence. Anabaena is symbiotic with the water fern Azolla [137].
It is significant that the only cyanobacteria known to have
RCCR homologues (functional at the transcript level in
the case of Nostoc at least) are those that form symbioses
with green plants in tissues which are exposed to light. In
these associations (especially the intracellular symbiosis),
the normal option of excreting RCC into an aqueous
medium would not be available. We speculate that this is
the reason for the anomalous occurrence of RCCR genes

in symbiotic Nostoc and Anabaena. The source of these
genes remains problematical. Did land plants acquire
RCCR by gene transfer between a cyanobacterium and a
hornwort-like early colonizer host; or (more likely, since
there is no obvious trace of the gene in other cyanobacteria) did a cyanobacterial symbiont pick up the gene from
its host? The possibility of gene transfer between hosts
and symbionts as a factor in the adaptation of early land
plants to the new environment merits further study.
RCCR converts the phototoxic chlorophyll catabolite RCC
into pFCC, which the envelope transporter WBC23
exports to the cytosol. The subsequent reaction sequence

– conjugation followed by sequestration in the vacuole –
is the usual means by which intracellular waste products
or xenobiotics are detoxified [138,139]. The tonoplast
transporter MRP2 was discussed above.
Beerling [140] has proposed that the high atmospheric
CO2 concentrations at the time when plants invaded the
land persisted for 40–50 my, until the late Devonian,
when a steep fall in CO2 drove the evolutionary transition
from microphyllous plants (psilopsids, lycopsids, bryophytes) to the macrophyllous and euphyllous ferns, conifers and angiosperms. Beerling points out that the genes
for leaf morphogenesis were to a large extent already

present in clubmosses, spikemosses and quillworts and
proposes that high CO2 constrained the expression of this
morphogenetic potential. The elaboration of megaphyllous laterals from the Carboniferous onward led directly
to the evolution of the specialised reproductive and propagative structures of the angiosperms according to longestablished ontogenetic principles [39,141]. Although
light, carbon and (with qualifications) water may have
been superabundant, mineral nutrients are likely to have
been a limiting factor in early terrestrial ecosystems.
Nitrogen in particular is released in only very small
amounts from the weathering of rocks, though it is possible that biological N2 fixation by (cyano)bacteria and
archea and nitrogen oxide fertilization by electrical storms
could have contributed to the formation of skeletal oligotrophic soils as far back as 1200 mya [142]. The requirement for parsimony in the internal nitrogen economy of
early land plants would have favoured the development
of a number of structural, developmental and physiological traits contributing to the adoption of an integrated
senescence program [38,142].
Efficient internal nitrogen recycling requires cell integrity
and metabolic regulation in the senescing source tissue, a
directional translocation system connecting the source to
the developing sink, means of signalling supply and

demand status between the different regions of the plant
body and a morphogenetic context that maintains structural and functional fitness [40,143,144]. Development
of the thalli of liverworts clearly includes the capacity for
senescence-like terminal changes (see, for example, Koeberl and Maravolo; [145]). Eckstein and Karlsson [146]
showed the recycling of nitrogen from senescing to young
ramets in mosses lacking a specialised vascular system.
This suggests that source-sink integration of senescence
into development was well established before the evolution of tracheophytes [40]. A search of the JGI Physcomitrella patens online database at the time of writing
yields more than 330 hits with high sequence similarity to
senescence-related genes in Arabidopsis, rice and Medicago,
and proteomics studies, such as the analysis of responses
of the P patens phosphoproteome to cytokinin treatment
described by Heintz et al. [147], also identify gene products that may have a function in the developmental integration of senescence in this species. Highly similar
homologues of all the representative senescence-related
proteins analysed in the present study have been identified within the bryophytes by sequence-based analysis
(Figure 21). We conclude that the genetic potential for
expressing and regulating the senescence syndrome and
deploying it as an adaptation to oligotrophic conditions
was well established in the earliest land plants.

The senescence program is integral to strategies for dealing
with the biotic and abiotic stresses of the terrestrial environment. Wrky53, member of a family of regulatory genes
that diversified greatly with the evolution of the tracheophytes ([74]; Figure 9), encodes a transcription factor that
functions both in senescence pathways and in a network
of stress responses [148]. Wrky53 interacts with more
than 60 genes of various kinds, including those for other
transcription factors and for the senescence-related
cysteine endopeptidase SAG12 [149]. Wrky53 is induced
by H2O2, and autoregulates its own synthesis by feedback
inhibition. Salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, via the regulatory protein ESR, control Wrky53 functions in senescence and resistance responses to pathogens [150].
Acclimation and adaptation to environmental stresses is
often mediated by redox sensing. The stress-activated transcriptional cofactor NPR1 exists in the cytoplasm in the
form of disulfide-bonded oligomers. A change in redox
conditions results in reduction of the intermolecular
disulfide bonds and relocation of monomeric NPR1 to
the nucleus where it activates genes [151]. Miao et al.
[149] reported that At4g26120, a gene encoding an NPR1like protein, is a target for Wrky53 binding. The corresponding protein sequence shows better than 99% identity with that encoded by At1g64280, transcription of
which is enhanced in senescence (Figure 20). Other genes
listed in Figure 1 and profiled in Figure 20 with which
Wrky53 interacts include At4g33030 (sulpholipid synthase), At5g45890 (SAG12 protease) and At5g14930
(SAG 101 lipase). It may be significant that the latter gene
clusters immediately adjacent to Wrky53 in the Genevestigator diagram (Figure 20).
Tracheophytes, angiosperms and co-evolution
Angiosperms appeared in the Jurassic period, 150 mya.
Carpels, flowers and tectate pollen occur in the fossil
record at around this time and within 30 my angiosperms
had become the dominant component of global floras.
Before evolution of the angiosperms the colour world of
vegetation would have consisted largely of greens, yellows
and browns, much as it does in modern conifer-dominated forest ecosystems. A rapid increase in the profusion
of natural pigmentation accompanied the Cretaceous
explosion in angiosperm evolution and was likely to have
been an adaptive response to a combination of abiotic
and biotic factors [152,153]. Radiation of the first
angiosperms into a wide range of new and often hostile
environments was made possible by physiological and
morphogenetic innovations or consolidations including,
for example, the development of flexible photosynthetic
mechanisms and the proliferation of architectures and
life-forms [152,154]. Climate change may also have been
a driving force at the onset of angiosperm diversification,
since a transition between icehouse and greenhouse conditions occurred at this time [155].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/163

Photoinhibition and the damaging effect of excess light
energy within assimilatory tissues is a common factor in
the experience of abiotic stresses [95,156]. The ancient
role of carotenoids in the dissipation of excess light energy
within the photosynthetic apparatus [45] assumed new
significance in land plants as they moved out into ecological niches in which the abiotic environment was increasingly subject to wide fluctuations that differentially
affected the capture and utilisation of light energy
[157,158]. Amongst the carotenoid-related stress
responses shared with senescence is the photoprotection
role of Fibrillin [159]. Upregulation of Fibrillin expression in senescence (Figure 2) is consistent with the
requirement for the maintenance of photoprotection during chlorophyll catabolism and protein mobilisation
within the transdifferentiating plastid [9].
Coevolution with pollinators and dispersers is an important
factor in establishing carotenoid- and phenylpropanoidbased pigmentation of floral organs and propagating structures such as seeds and fruits [153,160-163]. The interaction
between the colours of plant parts and the animal visual system is an example of extreme convergence in evolution, in
the sense that the isoprenoid-protein light receptor structures
and metabolic systems in the earliest photoautotrophs
(evolved to exploit the main central part of the visible spectrum) show remarkable gene and protein sequence conservation through to both the carotenoid biochemistry of
angiosperm organs and the eyes of the animals that interact
with them. For example the highly conserved carotenoidmetabolising enzyme CCD8 (Figure 14) is a member of the
same superfamily (RPE65) as the membrane proteins that
bind retinal pigments in the eye. In contrast with the
extremely ancient biochemistry and functions of isoprenoids, molecular phylogeny identifies flavonoids, including
the hydrophilic vacuolar pigments of leaves, flowers and
fruits, as innovations of the land plants (Figure 16, Figure 21;
[164]), and their diversification as a factor in angiosperm
radiation [153,162,165]. The evolutionary origin and significance of red anthocyanin coloration in senescing leaves are
subjects of much current debate [8,59,166]. Modelling, and
some experimental evidence, supports the idea of coevolution with herbivores, in which foliar anthocyanins act as signals to insects and other predators [167]. Alternatively, or
additionally, anthocyanin accumulation may be a plant
response to, or insurance against the effects of, abiotic
stresses such as extremes of, or imbalances in, light, temperature, water availability or nutrient status [168]. We shall
return to the question of the evolutionary relationship
between the pigments of senescing foliage and the colours of
flowers and fruits.
According to Ruddiman [169] the present era is the
Anthropocene (a term coined by Crutzen and Stoermer;
[170]) and dates from the origins of agriculture in human

evolution, more than 8000 years ago. Human activity has
intruded on plant evolution during the Anthropocene not
only by subjecting it to environmental and climatic perturbations but also, and more directly, through selection,
crop improvement and biotechnology. The domestication
syndrome comprises, amongst a range of traits, annual
growth habit, hypertrophied grains and foliage, rapid
seedling establishment and high harvest-index [171]: all
of which are influenced by, and influence, the timing and
execution of senescence programs [172]. The senescenceassociated NAC transcription factors ([41]; Figure 10)
illustrate the point. Ooka et al. [173] analysed the NAC
family of Arabidopsis and rice and placed At1g69490 and
three other closely related sequences (At1g61110,
At3g15510, At1g52880) in the NAP subgroup of Group I.
Genevestigator expression profiling shows that each of the
four AtNAPs in this family has a distinctly different tissue
specificity: highest abundance of At1g69490 transcripts is
in senescing leaves, with petals and sepals also giving a
strong signal (Figure 2). At1g52880 expression is most
intense in seed and fruit tissues, with some signal in
senescing leaves; At3g15510 transcripts are most abundant in cork and xylem; whereas At1g61110 expression is
confined to flowers and stamens (data not shown).
At1g69490 is the top hit when the Hordeum senescenceassociated NAM protein sequence is BLASTed against the
TAIR8 protein dataset. Sequence alignment also places
rice ONAC010 in the NAP subgroup, and BLASTing the
rice sequence hits both the Hordeum and Triticum senescence-related NAM proteins with E values of better than
3e-100. A transcriptomic study by Hirose et al. [174]
showed that ONAC010 expression in rice leaves is suppressed by treatment with the anti-senescence hormone
zeatin. Divergence of function and structure is evidence of
the plasticity of genes of the NAP/NAM family under natural and, potentially, human-mediated selection. Functional alleles of the NAM-B1 gene, encoding a
transcription factor that accelerates senescence and
increases nutrient remobilization, occur in ancestral wild
wheat. Modern wheat varieties have been selected for
delayed senescence, a trait correlated with enhanced grain
yield [172]. They carry a non-functional allele of NAM-B1
[41]. Many further examples of human intervention to
alter the senescence and ripening patterns of domesticated
plants (with consequences for pigmentation or productivity or both) are discussed in [175-177].
Relationship of ontogeny and phylogeny in the evolution
of senescence
During the present discussion we have moved freely
across the full evolutionary range of taxonomic groupings
and between cells, tissues and organs and their genes, regulators, enzymes, transporters, pigments and metabolites.
To justify treating processes and structures, as well as
genes and proteins, as homologues, we propose here a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/163

simple unifying developmental scheme. Following the
principles of morphological and allometric transformation first described in 1917 by d'Arcy Thompson (revised
edition 1992; [178]), a linear branch- or microphyll-like
structure may evolve by 'rubber sheet' distortion into a
two-dimensional lamina (a leaf or floral part for example), which in turn can be expanded in a third dimension
to produce a fleshy spheroidal structure – a fruit, say (Figure 22). By adding a developmental time dimension to
this figure, the progress of senescence may be represented
by a sequence of pigmentation changes, green through
yellow to red and finally the post-senescence transition to
cell death accompanied by non-physiological darkening
or bleaching. The result (Figure 22) is a spatial-temporal
grid across which the aerial structures of multicellular
green plants may travel freely during development or evolution. The grid itself is plastic and deformable so that particular structural or temporal stages are curtailed,
extended or even subject to reversion, thereby giving rise
to the profusion of forms and senescence behaviours seen
in the land flora.
This schematic description of the homologous interrelationships of organ senescence has important implications
when considered together with the molecular relationships described in the present study. It is clear that the
competence to transdifferentiate chloroplasts into gerontoplasts was already well established in the bryophytes
and ferns, whereas chromoplasts appeared later when
coevolution with the visual systems of interacting animals
began to drive diversification of the colours and morphologies of reproductive structures (Additional File 3, Figure
22). In this regard it is significant that genes for Fibrillin,

OrI and OrII, which originated phylogenetically long
before chromoplasts had evolved (Figures 13, 15, are
close to each other when clustered by expression profile
(Figure 20, tracks 32, 27, 28). We argue, therefore, that
there is a direct relationship between the phylogenetic
precedence of gerontoplasts over chromoplasts on the one
hand and their corresponding ontogenies on the other
[113]. This implies that leaves which lose their chlorophyll and reveal and/or accumulate non-green pigments
(carotenoids in all groups, anthocyanins arising with the
cryptogams and angiosperms – Figure 21) are the evolutionary progenitors of the highly coloured flowers, fruits
and seeds of dicots and monocots. It means that, phylogenetically and ontogenetically, the pigmented sepals, petals and dispersal structures of angiosperms are essentially
heterochronic senescing leaves [110].
Moreover, if the developmental sequence of the twodimensional structure in Figure 22 represents the ontogeny of a leaf and a homologous perianth structure such as
a petal, then it is formation and pigmentation of the floral
organ rather than the subsequent fading and death of the
structure that expresses the modified senescence program.
This view is not widely accepted (see [3,179]), but receives
some support from the literature (for example [180-182])
as well as from genomics. When senescence-related transcription profiles are used to cluster tissues and organs
according to similarity of expressed gene complement
(Figure 20), senescent leaf, petal, sepal and other floral
parts form a clear grouping. On the other hand xylem and
cork, tissues in which developmental cell death is an
essential part of the differentiation program, are relatively
distant from the leaf and floral clades (Figure 20), which
is consistent with the argument that foliar senescence and
homologous processes such as perianth development
should be classed as transdifferentiation phenomena distinct from terminal cell death events [110].
The clustering patterns of Figure 20 provide further
insights into the possible nature and origins of plant
senescence and its regulation. It is striking that 11 of the
14 genes for isoprenoid metabolism analysed form a
group between tracks 21 and 34. A coordinated unit of
genes determining carotenoid functions in transdifferentiating plastids is suggested. Similarly, of 9 phenylpropanoid genes, 8 cluster between columns 49 and 61,
indicating an integrated regulatory grouping. PaO, chlorophyll b reductase and Sgr are immediately adjacent to
each other (tracks 37–39) and near to WBC23 (track 43).
The remoteness of chlorophyllase from this cluster (column 13) may reflect growing opinion that the enzyme
product of the corresponding gene (At5g43860) may not
function in chlorophyll degradation in vivo [183]. The
status of phaeophorbidase (column 20) in physiological

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/163

chlorophyll catabolism is also uncertain. Like RCCR,
which is nearby (track 23), no algal homologue has been
detected [33], suggesting it too may be a relatively recent
recruit to the pathway. The isolation of MRP2 (track 1)
from other components of the chlorophyll breakdown
pathway may reflect its variety of functions and ancient
evolutionary origins. The associations revealed by cluster
analysis (Figure 20) and the phylogenetic diversity of
senescence-related genes (Figure 21) are consistent with
the proposition that senescence is more a timetabled network than a single executable program [5]. Senescence has
its evolutionary origin in a core of metabolic processes
concerned with building and rebuilding photosynthetic
complexes. Other biochemical, cellular, integrative and
adaptive systems became accreted on this armature as the
evolving plant encountered new environmental and
developmental contexts. Current systems biology
approaches [184] are leading towards the idea of senescence as a complex of reticulated gene interactions with
nodes and hubs and away from the older conception of a
master switch from which subsequent events propagated
[5]. The evolutionary perspective is entirely consistent
with such a system network model of plant senescence
and its control.

Conclusion
In recent times the quantity and quality of DNA sequence
information from plants across the taxonomic and evolutionary range has increased greatly. At the same time our
understanding of the molecular and cell biology of plant
senescence has developed to the point where we can
assign functions to some enzymes and regulatory proteins. In the present paper we have taken the first steps
towards a synthesis that allows us to frame, and begin to
test, hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of
angiosperm senescence, its control and integration into
plant development and adaptation. Because major gaps
remain in the taxonomic spread of sequenced species, and
the assignment of functions to senescence-associated
genes, the arguments presented here include a number of
conjectural interpolations and extrapolations. For example, it is something of an article of faith for molecular evolution studies to consider a modern member of an ancient
phylum (the lycopod Selaginella, for example) as representative of the genomic status of its newly-evolved ancestral form. Many more sequences from many more species,
particularly covering the span between the cyanobacteria
and the angiosperms, are needed before this belief can be
held with full confidence. For the specific case of plant
senescence, the scarcity of sequences from ferns and charophytes is a particular limitation. Even so, the present
study has allowed a feasible scheme to be proposed that
accounts for much of the available information on senescence-related genes, their functions and interactions.

Creating and displaying protein sequence trees
All protein trees reported here were generated using, as
appropriate, BLASTP and FASTA for local alignments,
ClustalW2 for global alignment, and TREE-PUZZLE, PUZZLEBOOT and the PHYLIP Phylogeny Inference Package
[185,186] for phylogeny and bootstrap analysis.

Protein sequence trees were constructed from amino acid
sequence data using PROML (Protein Maximum Likelihood Program) in PHYLIP 3.62 for inferring evolutionary
trees. PHYLIP (current version 3.68, released in August
2008) is distributed by the author, J Felsenstein, Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington,
Seattle.
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/
phylip.html. Input files for PROML, consisting of multiple sequence alignments, were created using ClustalW2.
The Jones-Taylor-Thornton model was used to compute
probabilities of changes between amino acid sequences.
For all amino acid sequence data sets, PROML was run
with three different settings for the R (rate variation
among sites) parameter: Gamma distribution [187], Hidden Markov Model (HMM [188]) and constant rate of
change. The Log Likelihood (Ln) values of these three
approaches for each set of protein sequences studied are
summarised in Additional File 4. Although there were
some minor variations in Ln values using the different
approaches for estimating the among-site rate heterogeneity, the final tree conformations were the same regardless
of which approach was used. Thus the among-site rate variation did not have significant influence on the topology
of trees produced in this study.

final manuscript.

Additional material
To estimate the degree of rate heterogeneity, TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [189,190]http://www.tree-puzzle.de/ was run,
using alignments created in ClustalW2, to generate the
parameters such as the alpha (Gamma rate heterogeneity
parameter) values, number of rate categories, individual
rates and their respective probabilities to specify, as
appropriate, coefficient of variation for a Gamma distribution model and how many categories of substitution
rate there would be in a HMM of rate variation.
Protein trees were displayed using the TreeView visualisation tool:
http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html
Genevestigator
We profiled the expression of senescence-related genes in
Arabidopsis using the Genevestigator reference expression
database and meta-analysis system for Affymetrix® expression arrays [191]. Figure 2 presents output in heat-map
format from the Meta-profile analysis tool based on
screening of the ATH1 22 k array source for strength of
expression categorised by Anatomy. Use of the Clustering
analysis tool is shown in Figure 20. Both Anatomy and
Gene categories were subjected to Hierarchical Clustering.
Genevestigator displays absolute values either as MAS5normalized signal values, or as MAS5 normalized values
relative to the expression potential of each gene. The
MAS5 normalization algorithm implemented by Genevestigator is described by Gentleman et al. [192]. The
expression potential of a given gene is defined as the average of the top 1% signal values of a probe set across all
arrays in the database. Its value is represented by the darkest blue colour, against which other levels of expression
are normalised.
