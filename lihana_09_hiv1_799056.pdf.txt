Abstract
Background: Infection with HIV-1 is characterized by genetic diversity such that specific viral subtypes
are predominant in specific geographical areas. The genetic variation in HIV-1 pol and env genes is
responsible for rapid development of resistance to current drugs. This variation has influenced disease
progression among the infected and necessitated the search for alternative drugs with novel targets.
Though successfully used in developed countries, these novel drugs are still limited in resource-poor
countries. The aim of this study was to determine HIV-1 subtypes, recombination, dual infections and viral
tropism of HIV-1 among Kenyan patients prior to widespread use of antiretroviral drugs.
Methods: Remnant blood samples from consenting sexually transmitted infection (STI) patients in Nairobi
were collected between February and May 2001 and stored. Polymerase chain reaction and cloning of
portions of HIV-1 gag, pol and env genes was carried out followed by automated DNA sequencing.
Results: Twenty HIV-1 positive samples (from 11 females and 9 males) were analyzed. The average age
of males (32.5 years) and females (26.5 years) was significantly different (p value < 0.0001). Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that 90% (18/20) were concordant HIV-1 subtypes: 12 were subtype A1; 2, A2; 3, D and
1, C. Two samples (10%) were discordant showing different subtypes in the three regions. Of 19 samples
checked for co-receptor usage, 14 (73.7%) were chemokine co-receptor 5 (CCR5) variants while three
(15.8%) were CXCR4 variants. Two had dual/mixed co-receptor use with X4 variants being minor
population.
Conclusion: HIV-1 subtype A accounted for majority of the infections. Though perceived to be a high
risk population, the prevalence of recombination in this sample was low with no dual infections detected.
Genotypic co-receptor analysis showed that most patients harbored viruses that are predicted to use
CCR5.

Background
The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a major global public health
crisis. Currently, an estimated 33 million people worldwide are living with HIV-1 infection. The majority of cases
(67%) are in sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. Evolution of HIV-1
has assumed multiple guises which differ in geographic
distribution [3]. Three groups of HIV-1 have developed
across the globe: M (major), O (outlying) and N (new)
[4]. Majority of HIV-1 subtypes responsible for the AIDS
pandemic belong to group M and phylogenetic analysis
has further classified them into 11 pure HIV-1 subtypes
[5,6] and 43 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)[7]. In
Kenya, reports of diverse HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants abound [8-10]. Subtype A1 and its recombinants
are the most prevalent and responsible for majority of
AIDS cases [11], their presence in other regions of the
world not withstanding [12].
HIV requires a co-receptor [initially chemokine (C-C
motif) receptor5 (CCR5)] for entry into its host to facilitate primary infection irrespective of the transmission
route and the predominant viral tropism present in the
donor [13]. Most HIV variants isolated from drug-naive,
chronically-infected individuals use CCR5 along with
CD4 to gain entry into cells - hence referred to as R5tropic. On the other hand viruses able to use CXCR4 coreceptors (X4-tropic) tend to emerge later over the course
of HIV infection, being recognized in nearly half of
patients in advanced disease stages. Under drug therapy,
consequent switches back and forth between both coreceptors may occur[14].
Studies have shown that AIDS progression differs as a
function of the infecting subtype and viral tropism
[15,16]. Studies assessing the effect of co-receptor usage
on current antiretrovirals and drug resistance mutations
are particularly needed since novel compounds would be
used in antiretroviral-experienced patients or in subjects
with drug-resistant viruses. Furthermore, HIV diversity is
important for viral load testing in clinical settings as this
has an impact on virus quantification[17], especially in
resource-poor settings whose populations are apparently
infected with diverse subtypes.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) using nucleoside- and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and
NNRTIs) as well as protease inhibitors (PIs) has sharply
reduced HIV morbidity and mortality in developed countries but has created the problem of drug resistance. Drug
resistance mutations associated with most regimens have
previously been described [18-21]. The emergence of
resistance has fuelled the search for new drug classes with
novel mechanisms of action. Different classes of entry
inhibitors have been developed as alternatives for those
failing therapy. Enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor, was the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/215

first molecule to obtain approval [22]. The approval of
Maraviroc (a CCR5 antagonist) is promising and evidence
of its success has been reported [23,24]. Thus, the use of
co-receptor antagonists among patients failing ART has
been successful in industrialised countries, but has yet to
reach patients in resource-poor countries.
The aim of this study was to determine HIV-1 subtypes,
recombination and dual infections among Kenyan
patients before antiretroviral therapy became widely available. We further investigated co-receptor use among common infecting subtypes for alternative therapy with
envisaged treatment failure.

Methods
Study site, population and samples
The study was carried out at the special treatment center in
Nairobi. The center has been specially established to offer
subsidized health services to individuals with sexually
transmitted infections (STIs). After informed consent and
ethical approval from the National ethical committee
through Kenya Medical Research Institute, sociodemographic data (age and gender) were obtained for each
individual using a self-reporting questionnaire. Three
mililiters of remnant blood samples from volunteer
patients, aged 18 years and above, were collected and
shipped to the laboratory. The patients were not followed
up after the initial sample collection. At the laboratory,
the samples were tested for HIV antibodies by ImmunocombII HIV1 & 2 Bispot (Orgenics, Israel) and confirmed
using an enzyme immunosorbent assay (Enzygnost,
Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany). Confirmed positive
samples were separated into plasma and lymphocytes by
density gradient centrifugation. Plasma and buffy coats
were stored at -80°C until use. Genomic DNA was
extracted from buffy coats using DNAzol (Invitrogen, Life
technologies, USA) lysis and ethanol precipitation.
Polymerase chain reaction, Cloning and Sequencing
A portion of the HIV-1 gag gene (covering amino acid 132
of p24 to amino acid 20 of p7) was amplified as previously described [9]. Portions of the HIV-1 pol and envC2V3 regions were amplified using gene specific primers
as previously described [18].

Cloning of amplified DNA fragments was performed as
described before [18]. Sequencing was done on an automated ABI 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
city, USA). At least 5 clones from each sample were analyzed to explore the possibility of dual infections. Generated sequences were aligned with subtype reference
sequences from Los Alamos database using Clustal W
(version 1.83) and phylogenetic trees infered by the
neighbor-joining method as described [18,25]. Sequences
with premature stop codons were excluded from final

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/215

analyses. Profile of trees was inferred using Tree View (version 1.6.6) [26]. Bootstrap re-sampling (1,000 data sets)
of multiple alignments was performed to test the statistical robustness of the trees.
Genotypic prediction of co-receptor usage
Genotypic predictions of co-receptor usage take the relevant parts of the viral genome - V3-loop - which is a third
highly variable loop of gp120. Even though other parts of
the genome seem to influence co-receptor usage, this has
remained more reliable in resource-poor settings where
phenotypic assays are expensive. Genotypic methods use
simple rules, such as the 11/25 rule which predicts X4
merely on the basis of the presence of basic side chains in
residues 11 or 25 of the V3-loop (35 amino acids). This
method also uses the overall net charge of the 35 amino
acids in the V3 loop; showing R5 viruses with a net charge
of 5 or less and X4 viruses with a net charge of more than
5 [13]. Based on this, classification into CCR5 users (R5),
CXCR4 users (X4) or dual/mixed tropic (R5X4) is possible. Dual classification into X4 and non-X4 is also possible and most useful as it closely reflects the clinically
relevant problem [14]. To improve on sensitivity, multiple clones from each sample were analyzed.

Results
Study population and samples
Twenty HIV-1 positive blood samples were analyzed in
this study. Of these, nine were from males and 11 from
females. The age difference between males (32.5 years)
and females (26.5 years) was highly significant (p value <
0.0001). Study patients' characteristics are shown in table
1.
HIV-1 Subtypes
The sample sequences were assigned to subtypes if at least
two gene fragments were successfully amplified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 18 (90%) were concordant
subtypes (12 subtype A1, 2 subtype A2, 3 subtype D and
1 subtype C) and clustered together with respective reference sequences from the HIV database. However, one
sample did not amplify in the env gene but was classified

as a pure subtype A1 since it amplified in pol and gag.
Sequences from two samples (10%) were discordant,
showing different subtypes in the analyzed regions. No
dual infections were observed. All male patients were
infected with concordant subtypes (7 had subtype A1;
One had subtype C and another subtype A2). The two
samples with discordant subtypes (C/C/A2 and D/A/A in
gag, pol and env, respectively) and three with subtype D
were found in females' blood samples. Table 2 shows the
subtypes determined in the analyzed gene fragments of
each patient's virus. Phylogenetic trees for gag, pol and env
are shown in figures 1, 2 and 3, respectivesly.
HIV-1 co-receptor usage
Nineteen samples were checked for viral tropism; one
sample could not be successfully amplified and cloned in
the env gene despite having been amplified in the other
two genes. In this region 11 were subtype A1, 3 were subtype A2, 2 were subtype C and 3 were subtype D. Fourteen
samples (73.7%) were R5 variants, while three were X4
variants. One sample among subtype A1 had mixed coreceptor usage. One sample among subtype A2 had X4
using virus while another had mixed co-receptor usage.
Among subtype D, 2 samples had X4 and one sample had
R5 variants, respectively. All subtype C sequences were R5
variants (Table 2).

Discussion
In the current study, 20 samples were studied and found
to habour diverse HIV-1 subtypes. Majority of sequences
were subtype A1. This is in agreement with previous
reports that have also shown continuous evolution of
HIV-1 subtype A to form sub-subtypes which have been
reported in different continents [8,27,28]. The increased
diversity pose complexities in management of drug resistant variants. Currently, ART is being scaled up in Kenya
[29]. The consequences of this upscaling is yet to be evaluated. Although we did not test for HIV drug resistance in
this population, the rapid scale up of ART is expected to
lead to an increase in drug resistant strains among drugnaïve patients. This is likely to result in increased prevalence of resistance.

in the three gene fragments that were analyzed does not
exclude the possibility of recombination elsewhere. Furthermore, our sample size was small. Nonetheless, the
possibility of recombination and emergence of newer
strains is likely as infected populations move from areas
with high prevalence into Nairobi in search of better living standards. From our observation of gender and age,
the likelihood that our patients were primarily female
prostitutes and their male customers cannot be ruled out.
Since our sample population was a self selected type, it
may not reflect HIV dynamics in the general population at
the time of sampling. This calls for continued monitoring
of circulating HIV-1 subtypes and drug resistance in the
general population as treatment options become increasingly available in resource-poor settings. This will eventually help in understanding the dynamics of HIV strains
locally and in the region for better management of the
infected.
Co-receptor tropism of any given HIV isolate is closely
associated with disease progression. HIV-1 co-receptor use
in this study was predicted based on the amino acid composition of the V3 loop. Though this genotypic assay is
less sensitive and need validation, it is relatively fast and
less expensive especially in resource-poor settings. However, the use of this method to check for co-receptor usage
might have affected the outcome. A more sensitive and
reliable phenotyping assay would be ideal to elucidate
this.

In this study, prevalence of recombination among STI
patients was comparatively low despite the fact that STI
patients are considered to be a high risk population.
Although we employed a commonly used subtyping
methodology, the absence or presence of recombination

When using entry inhibitors in therapy, monitoring viral
tropism will allow prediction of drug efficacy to avoid
treatment failure [30,31]. Even in patients with a dominant non-X4 virus, minorities of X4 variants exist [32].
This means that detection of X4 minorities is of clinical
value [33]. Therefore, time-saving, reliable and widely
available methods for prediction of viral tropism are
required. This is essential in guiding the use of entry
inhibitors in resource-poor settings since patients are
increasingly presenting with strains that are resistant to
available NRTI, NNRTI and PIs. New studies on co-receptor use before and during antiretroviral treatment are
required to address issues surrounding viral tropism in
HIV variants among patients in whom conventional therapy has failed.

Conclusion
HIV-1 diversity and viral tropism have emerged as major
aspects in HIV therapy. Since different quasispecies can be
present in patients, some are likely to outgrow others
when subjected to non suppressive therapy leading to
resistance and treatment failure. This is bound to complicate treatment options with the upscaling of ART in
resource-poor settings. In Kenya, this is expected to lead to
increased drug resistance among drug-naïve patients
hence requirements for alternative drugs. Entry of new

Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 env-C2V3 region
Figure 3
Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 env-C2V3 region. Clones generated from each patient sample were aligned and compared
with reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos HIV database. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed by neighbor-joining method and rooted with SIVcpzGAB. The bootstrap values (of 1000 replicates) above 70% are indicated next to
the node. Brackets on the right indicate the subtype clusters.

drugs with novel targets into the market will require that
subtype and viral tropism determination be done before
start of treatment. This, along with proper laboratory
monitoring, will help in deciding best options for those
infected with mixed viral populations at a time when
more patients are presenting with HIV-1 subtypes that are
resistant to available drugs.
