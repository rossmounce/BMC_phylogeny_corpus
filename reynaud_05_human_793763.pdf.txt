Abstract
Background: Compartmentalization is a key feature of eukaryotic cells, but its evolution remains
poorly understood. GTPases are the oldest enzymes that use nucleotides as substrates and they
participate in a wide range of cellular processes. Therefore, they are ideal tools for comparative
genomic studies aimed at understanding how aspects of biological complexity such as cellular
compartmentalization evolved.
Results: We describe the identification and characterization of a unique family of circularly
permuted GTPases represented by the human orthologue of yeast Lsg1p. We placed the members
of this family in the phylogenetic context of the YlqF Related GTPase (YRG) family, which are
present in Eukarya, Bacteria and Archea and include the stem cell regulator Nucleostemin. To
extend the computational analysis, we showed that hLsg1 is an essential GTPase predominantly
located in the endoplasmic reticulum and, in some cells, in Cajal bodies in the nucleus. Comparison
of localization and siRNA datasets suggests that all members of the family are essential GTPases
that have increased in number as the compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell and the ribosome
biogenesis pathway have evolved.
Conclusion: We propose a scenario, consistent with our data, for the evolution of this family:
cytoplasmic components were first acquired, followed by nuclear components, and finally the
mitochondrial and chloroplast elements were derived from different bacterial species, in parallel
with the formation of the nucleolus and the specialization of nuclear components.

Background
Comparative genomics is a powerful method for identifying the potential functions of previously uncharacterized
genes, allowing their distribution among the kingdoms of
life to be characterized, and the changes in sequence and
regulation underpinning their conserved or divergent

functions to be tracked [1]. Comparative genomics has
been enormously facilitated by progress in bioinformatics
tools, comprising the enormous amount of information
available from databases concerning protein localization
[2,3], viability [4,5], protein expression [6], genetic interactions [7] and protein-protein interactions [8]. These

resources are usually focused on one particular organism
(S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster or B. subtilis) and
are therefore mainly used by the small part of the scientific
community working with this organism and able to handle the outcome and limitations. Attempts have been
made to correlate large datasets across species, for example in the case of protein-protein interactions [9]. These
cross-correlation analyses are based on the presumption
that sequence and structural similarities between gene
products can be used to assess functional similarities
[10,11] and could in principle be extended to protein
localization, viability or partners.
Genomics should be particularly powerful in the case of
GTP binding proteins (or GTPases), which despite
extraordinary functional diversity are all believed to have
evolved from a single common ancestor [12]. As a result,
all known GTPases have a conserved switch mechanism of
action, core structure and sequence motifs. These proteins
are found in all domains of life and are involved in such
essential processes as vesicular trafficking, protein translation, intracellular signal transduction and cell cycle progression [12-14]. GTP binding proteins are often
described as molecular switch proteins because of their
particular mode of action. Binding and hydrolysis of GTP
results in conformational changes in the so-called switch
regions of the protein, which define the active GTP- and
the inactive GDP-bound forms; these are used, for
instance, for regulating receptor activation and cargo
recruitment to membranes [12].
We have used comparative genomics to identify and characterize the human homologue of the yeast protein Lsg1.
Here, we describe a novel family of GTP binding proteins,
which we have named YRG (YlqF Related GTPases). Members of this family contain a central GTPase domain showing a unique circular permutation of the known G motifs
of the GTP binding proteins. A phylogenetic analysis was
used for cross-species comparisons, focusing on sub-cellular localization, cell viability and the known functions of
each subfamily member. This analysis showed that YRG
family members are essential, have increased in eukaryotes as cell compartmentalizationhas evolved, and show
functional conservation in relation to rRNA maturation.

Results
Recently, we have localized more than 800 human proteins in living cells with the aim of gaining preliminary
functional data [3]. Analysis of these proteins for
sequences exhibiting characteristic GTPase motifs such as
the P-loop [18] allowed us to identify a subset of proteins
as putative GTPases.

Human Lsg1p defines a highly conserved GTPase protein
family
One of these proteins possesses a central GTPase domain
defined in the PFAM database of protein domains [19] as
the MMR/HSR1 domain, a coiled coil, and a potential
nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Figure 1A). No additional structural or enzymatic domains could be identified in the protein sequence using the SMART domain
research server [20]. Interestingly, this GTPase domain is
circularly permuted [21], in contrast to the canonical
organization of GTPases based on the small GTPase Ras
[12,22]. This circular permutation is unique, and it is surprising in view of the structure of the GTPase P-loop
domain [22,23]. It implies that the four highly conserved
elements of the GTPase that mediate interactions with the
guanine nucleotides and effector proteins, known as the
G1, G2, G3 and G4 motifs, are circularly permuted and
reorganized, since G4 is followed by G1, G2 and G3
[12,22] (Figure 1A).

A BLAST search for similar protein sequences [15] shows
that this unusual GTPase is present as a single copy per
genome [22] (Figure 1B [see Additional file 1]). Only one
member of the family has so far been experimentally
defined, namely the Lsg1 protein in S. cerevisiae [24].
Accordingly, we named the human protein hLsg1 (human
orthologue of Lsg1). All orthologues of hLsg1 possess a
central MMR/HSR1 domain belonging to KOG1424 in
the database of clusters of orthologous genes [25]. The
identity between aligned sequences ranges from 31% to
88%. Interestingly, except in the E. cuniculi member, the
GTPase domain contains an unusual insertion in comparison to the canonical GTPase structure. This insertion separates the G4 element from the remaining GTPase
elements (G1, G2 and G3) (Figure 1A).
In order to elucidate the potential function of hLsg1, we
extended our phylogenetic analysis. Owing to their
unique structure, circularly permuted GTPases have previously been reported [22,23] and partially grouped into
the Yawg/YlqF family (COG1160) [26], which is mainly
restricted to prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae, E. cuniculi). This family contains five subfamilies:
YjeQ (YloQ), MJ1464, YqeH, YlqF and Yawg. The latter
three branches have eukaryotic members, YlqF representing the ancestor of hLsg1. Interestingly, while the YqeH
subfamily is limited to only one member per species (also
labeled as Euk-porin in sequence database), and the YjeQ
subfamily is mainly restricted to bacteria [22], the YlqF
subfamily shows a large expansion of this gene family in
eukarya (Figure 1C). The YlqF subfamily can be further
subdivided into five clades: YlqF (bacterial), MTG1
(KOG2485), LSG1 (KOG1424), NOG2 (Yawg,
KOG2423), and NUG1 (KOG2484) according to the S.
cerevisiae nomenclature. The YlqF family expands further

Figure member of a large circularly permuted GTPase family
hLsg1 is 1
hLsg1 is member of a large circularly permuted GTPase family. (A) Schematic representation of hLsg1 – hLsg1
encodes a protein of 658 amino acids comprising a central MMR/HSR1 GTPase domain (black box, 151–500), a coiled-coil
domain (Hatched box, 126–151) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS, grey box, 638–654). Domain organization of the
GTPase is indicated as well as the insertion (white box inside the black box, 220–320) separating the G4 motif from the G1
motif. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the YRG superfamily. We constructed a multiple alignment of representative sequences
from the YqeH, YjeQ, EngA, and YlqF families. The alignment was produced using ClustalW followed by manual editing [16].
The tree was generated from the alignment using MrBayes v3 [45] (100000 generations with parameter n chains = 4; convergence occurred after 33600 generations; the tree is the consensus of 664 trees computed using MrBayes. No molecular clock
was assumed and therefore the branch lengths have no meaning. The numbers indicate the fraction of trees displaying the
grouping given by the branch). The root of the tree is the one given by the MrBayes output. (C) Distribution of YRG members in cellular compartments in different organisms.

in Coelomates [GNL1, 23] and in Deuterostomia (Nucleostemin [27]) (Figure 1B [see Additional file 2]).
Next, we exploited the experimental data from a comprehensive large-scale localization screen in yeast [2] and we
conducted literature searches to deduce the possible cellular localizations of the different family members, ranging
from the nucleolus to the mitochondria. The nucleolus is
the compartment in which the large ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) is synthesized, processed into the
mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs and assembled with
proteins to form ribosomal subunits that move to the
nucleoplasm and are finally exported to the cytoplasm.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts also possess a set of ribosomes. All yeast members (LSG1, NOG2, NUG1 and
MTG1) are involved in ribosome biogenesis [24,28-30],
and YjeQ binds to the ribosome in E. coli [31]. Finally,
using ChloroP [32] to predict proteins localized to the
chloroplast, we detected a sixth subfamily in YlqF, called
ChYlqF (for Chloroplast YlqF), and a second subfamily in
YqeH, called ChYqeH (for chloroplast YqeH). These are
only found in plant genomes and group in the phylogenetic tree with the cyanobacteria YRG and YqeH members
(Figure 1B [see Additional files 1 and 2]).
Nucleotide binding and GTPase activity of hLsg1
Lsg1-related proteins contain motifs that have been found
to be important for guanine nucleotide binding and
GTPase activity in a variety of cellular proteins [33]. Lsg1related proteins contain the G1-4 motifs typical of
GTPases (Figure 1A), suggesting that members of this family are likely to exhibit guanine nucleotide binding and
GTPase activity. However, direct experimental evidence
for this has been lacking so far, except for the distantly
related bacterial homologues YjeQ [31], YlqF and YqeH
[34]. To test this function in human Lsg1, we examined
the binding of [32P] GTP to purified His tagged-hLsg1
using as control a His-tagged Sar1p, a well characterized
GTPase regulating the vesicular coat complex COPII
[35,36]. As shown in Figure 2A, hLsg1 binds to [32P] GTP,
although more weakly than Sar1p. However, hLsg1 did
not bind GDP under those experimental conditions (data
not shown), which may reflect weak binding. To determine the GTPase activity of hLsg1, we performed a GTPase
assay using an HPLC system as previously described [17].
In this assay, purified recombinant hLsg1 showed a low
GTPase activity that proceeded to GMP and induced the
further hydrolysis of GDP through GMP to guanosine.
Such low GTPase activities have previously been observed
in the distantly related bacterial homolog YjeQ [21], but
also in GTPases in general, since their activities rely heavily on co-factors such as GAPs (GTPase Activating Proteins) [41] or GEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange
Factors) [37]. Moreover, other GTPases such as the interferon-induced 67-kDa guanylate-binding protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/21

(hGBP1) have been shown not to limit their hydrolysis to
GDP [42]. To confirm our observations indicating that
hLsg1 has GTPase activity, we immunoprecipitated
endogenous hLsg1 from a HeLa cell extract using a polyclonal antibody raised against purified hLsg1, and analyzed the GTPase activity of the precipitate (Figure 2B).
The GTPase activity was four times higher (incubation
time 4 h compared to 18 h required for completion of
GTP hydrolysis) than that of in vitro purified recombinant
hLsg1 and GDP was the only final product (Figure 2B,
lower panel). These data demonstrate GTPase activity in a
eukaryotic member of the YlqF family for the first time.
hLsg1 is an essential protein, a characteristic of YRG family
members
Yeast Lsg1, like the yeast YRG homologues NUG1, NOG2
and MTG1, is an essential protein [4]. To confirm the consequences of loss of hLsg1, we transfected siRNAs targeted
against hLsg1 into HeLa cells, confirming the efficiency of
the siRNA treatment by western blot analysis (Figure 3A).
After 24 h, Lsg1 expression showed a drastic decrease in
cells treated with Lsg1 siRNA compared to cells treated
with a negative control siRNA. Moreover, hLsg1 expression in control cells or cells transfected with the negative
control shows a band shift that increases with time, as
observed in proteins post-translationally modified e.g. by
phosphorylation. The increase in intensity could indicate
that the polyclonal antibody has a higher affinity for the
modified form. There was no significant change in actin
expression in control cells, or in cells treated with either
random siRNA or a specific hLsg1 siRNA (Figure 3A).
However, microscopic observations during the course of
the experiment showed that HeLa cell cultures exhibiting
hLsg1 knockdown were less dense than control cells. In
addition, hLsg1 knockdowns contained more apoptotic
cells (not shown), suggesting a lethal effect. We confirmed
this by immunostaining hLsg1-specific siRNA-treated
cells with a polyclonal anti-hLsg1 antibody and staining
the cell nuclei with DAPI at different times after transfection of the siRNA (Figure 3B). Cell numbers decreased
rapidly after treatment with the specific hLsg1 siRNA in
comparison to cells treated with oligofectamine alone or
with control siRNA.

We used the large datasets from gene viability screens of
bacteria, worms and flies to compare our observations
with data about other YRG family members. YjeQ was
shown to be indispensable for the growth of E. coli and B.
subtilis [38]. In C. elegans, YRG orthologues are non-viable
(t19a6.2a, t19a6.2b, k01c8.9, C53H9) (Figure 3C). Since
large human RNAi screens are only now in progress, no
data were available for other YRG human genes. However,
interestingly, overexpression of nucleostemin was shown
to be lethal [27].

According to our results, hLsg1 is essential, like its yeast
counterpart, and this characteristic seems to be common
to the YRG family members. This implies that each YRG
protein fulfils essential functions.
hLsg1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and to
discrete nuclear structures
Compartmentalization of the human cell allows better
control of function and reactions steps in many pathways,
including ribosome assembly. Cellular localization is a
key to defining protein function. Using large-scale localization screens, we previously identified hLsg1 as an endoplasmic reticulum localized protein [3], in contrast to
yeast Lsg1, which is proposed to localize specifically to the
cytosol [24].

We decided to confirm our preliminary data on hLsg1
localization in humans using GFP-fused constructs as well
as specific polyclonal antibodies. When expressed as a Cterminally tagged YFP fusion protein, hLsg1 localized to
the ER in most cells (Figure 4A, 1). In 10% of the transfected cells, however, discrete structures in the nucleus
were observed and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum was decreased or even absent (Figure 4A, 2). An N-terminally tagged CFP-hLsg1 fusion protein was also
localized to the ER and nuclear envelope, but more of the
protein was cytosolic than in the case of the C-terminal
hLsg1-YFP fusion (Figure 4A, 3). A truncated hLsg1 version (480 to 658aa) fused to the YFP, containing the
potential NLS, accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus
(Figure 4A, 4). Collectively, these data indicate that the
NLS present in the C-terminus of hLsg1 is functional, in
contrast to the putative NLS in yeast Lsg1, which is reportedly restricted to the cytosol [24].
Immunostaining with an antibody against the entire protein showed that the endogenous protein also localized to
reticular membranes, and in a fraction of the cells to a
number of small punctuate nuclear structures. These
results are very similar to those obtained with the hLsg1YFP fusion protein (Figure 4A, 2). Double staining
showed that hLsg1 partially co-localized with an ectopically expressed FP (fluorescent protein) used to mark the
ER (Clontech ER marker) (Figure 4B, bottom row), as well
as with the nuclear envelope marker lamin B1 (Figure 4B,
top row). However, hLsg1 was largely absent from the
Golgi complex, which was labeled with antibodies against
the Golgi membrane protein golgin97, and from mitochondria, marked by antibodies against HSP60 (data not
shown). Moreover, the small hLsg1-positive nuclear structures observed in a fraction of the cells co-localized with
coilin, a typical marker of Cajal bodies (CBs) (indicated
by arrowheads in Figure 4B, middle row). The CBs are functionally linked to the nucleolus and play a major role in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/21

the maturation of RNP, acting on the mRNA as well as the
rRNA pathway [44].
These data demonstrate that in contrast to its yeast counterpart, hLsg1 localizes to the ER and to Cajal bodies in
the nucleus.
hLsg1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol
The dual localization of hLsg1 in the cytosol and nucleus
suggests nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the protein, possibly in relation to rRNA maturation. We constructed
hLsg1 deletion mutants containing or excluding the putative the C-terminal NLS (YFP-hLsg1-1-600 and YFPhLsg1-480-658) and transfected them into Hela cells (Figure 5A). While YFP-hLsg1-480-658 clearly localized in the
nucleus, YFP-hLsg1-1-600, which contains no NLS, was
excluded from the nucleus. Moreover, YFP-hLsg1-480658 colocalized in the nucleus with SRP19-MRFP, a nucleolar marker [46], indicating that it sublocalizes to the
nucleolus.

To determine whether hLsg1 shuttled between nucleus
and cytosol via a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway, we transfected Vero cells with either hLsg1-YFP or
hLsg1 deletion mutants and compared the localization of
the fusion proteins after treatment with the CRM-1
nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) (Figure 5B).
Full-length hLsg1 (YFP-hLsg1) is LMB-sensitive (Figure
5B); so is its C-terminal counterpart hLsg1-CFP (data not
shown). To confirm this, we performed the same experiment using the deletion mutants YFP-hLsg1-1-600 and
YFP-hLsg1-480-658 as well as the full length YFP-hLsg1.
We also took intermediate time points (3 h and 5 h) to
obtain insights into the kinetics of hLsg1 shuttling. Interestingly, YFP-hLsg1 accumulates in the nucleus over an 8
h period, and at 5 h most of the transfected cells showed
punctate labeling in the nucleus reminiscent of Cajal bodies. YFP-hLsg1-480-658 showed a permanent nuclear
location and YFP-hLsg1-1-600 was constantly in the
cytosol.
These data suggest that hLsg1 shuttles between the cytosol
and Cajal bodies via a CRM1-dependent export
mechanism.

Discussion
Using database sequence similarity searches coupled with
phylogenetic analysis, we were able to unite the circularly
permuted GTPases into a family that we have named YRG
for YlqF Related GTPases [see Additional files 1 and 2].
The YlqF protein family represents the largest subfamily of
YRG expansion in eukarya, which is potentially involved
in ribosome biogenesis.

Phylogenetic analysis defines ten GTPase subfamilies with
a global phyletic distribution compatible with their presence in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of
extant life forms [22]. An emerging concept suggests that
these universal GTPases are necessary either for ribosome
function or for transmitting information from the ribosome to downstream targets to generate specific cellular
responses. These are associated with translation and
include four translation factors, two OBG-like GTPases,
the two signal-recognition-associated GTPases, the MRP
subfamily of MinD-like ATPases and the YRG family. Here
we have defined the YRG family for the first time as a
eukaryotic expansion of the original Yawg/YlqF family
[22]
tightly
coupled
to
the
evolution
of
compartmentalization.
The YRG family was originally defined as a particular class
of GTPases showing a circularly permuted structure, with
the four GTPase motifs reorganized as G4 followed by G1,
G2 and G3 (Figure 1A). This circular permutation is
unique in the GTPase superfamily. However, we have
shown that this inverted structure does not seem to affect
GTPase activity or folding, in agreement with other studies [31,39]. Moreover, regarding the potential function of
this family, it has been pointed out that most YRG members bind to the ribosome [YjeQ, [31]], are involved in the
maturation of ribosomes or mitoribosomes [24,28,29,2],
localize to compartments related to rRNA maturation
[NGP, [1,39]], and are essential proteins (see Figure 3C
and Additional file 2). Altogether, this indicates that YRG
members have an essential role in ribosomal assembly.
Strikingly, we could find a member of the YRG family for
every cellular compartment linked to ribosomes, including the chloroplast (Figure 1C), correlating with the
expansion of the eukaryotic cell (Figure 1C). According to
the phylogenetic tree of the family, the cytosolic form
block (LSG1) is distinct from the nuclear form blocks
(NOG2, NGP1, YawG), which later expanded into a
nucleolar form (NUG1), in parallel with the incorporation of members upon engulfment of the future mitochondria (MTG1) that cluster within the YlqF branch as
well as the future chloroplast (ChYlqF). Other events
within the YlqF family included the appearance of a second cytosolic form upon speciation of the coelomates
(GNL1), which may have had an equivalent in the plant
lineage, since we observed a form of Lsg1 in A. thaliana
(Figure 1B). Moreover, we observed the appearance of a
second nucleolar form (Nucleostemin) upon speciation
of the deuterostomes. Since Nucleostemin is involved in
cell-cycle regulation in stem cells, we can hypothesize a
direct mechanism of rRNA maturation in those highly
specialized animal cells. We propose the following scenario for the evolution of the YRG family. First, a cytosolic
founding member was duplicated upon the formation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/21

a proto-nucleus, allowing the rRNA maturation pathway
to be maintained (Figure 6). The second step included the
engulfment of mitochondria and chloroplasts containing
specific YRG forms involved in rRNA maturation in these
compartments. The final step(s) involved the evolution of
the cytosolic and nuclear members upon the specialization of the eukaryotic cell (nucleolus etc). This scenario
accords with the work of Mans et al. [47], which showed
by comparative genomics that a large set of proteins was
involved in the formation and structure of the nuclear
envelope and the pore complex: the nucleus evolved from
a primordial prekaryote compartment and a primitive
nuclear pore complex dependent on Ran and on Nug1p/
Nug2p, a nucleolar YRG member.
Interestingly, hLsg1 is the only member of this family that
shows a dual localization (cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum
and Cajal Bodies). The cytosol contains huge numbers of
ribosomes freely diffusing or bound to the endoplasmic
reticulum, and is the main transit pathway for rRNA en
route to the mitochondria or the chloroplast. Cajal Bodies
are spherical nuclear bodies containing a variety of
components including nucleolar proteins, snRNPs and
SMN. They are dynamic structures functionally linked to
the nucleolus, presumably involved in RNP maturation
and related to gene expression [43,44]. Consistent with
these data, one could hypothesize that hLsg1 is a regulator
of the rRNA pathway that can relocate to Cajal Bodies and
interact with specific factors such as nucleolar proteins.
The observation that Leptomycin B treatment leads to
accumulation of hLsg1 in the nucleus clearly indicates
shuttling via a CRM1-dependent export pathway. We
hypothesized that hLsg1 relocalizes from the cytosol to
the nucleus in response to internal (e.g. cell cycle) or external (e.g. growth factor) stimuli. In this way, hLsg1 would
act on the control of rRNA biosynthesis at its source: the
nucleolus. In the future, these hypotheses will be tested
for hLsg1 and for the other YRG family members to elucidate their role in rRNA biosynthesis and maturation.

Conclusion
Using comparative genomics, we defined the YRG family
as a unique group of circularly permuted GTPases. We
suggest a potential function for this family, as well as a
potential pathway by which the family members may act
sequentially, following an evolutionary process linked to
compartimentalization (Figure 6). A future goal will be to
test this hypothesis experimentally and to dissect the
molecular mechanisms of action of each member of the
pathway.

Methods
Analysis of Lsg1p protein family
Database similarity searches
The translated sequence of the Homo sapiens gene
FLJ11301 (GenBank accession no. NP_060855) was used
to search the non-redundant protein database at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information using the
PSI-BLASTP program (15). Homologues were identified
in Homo sapiens (GenBank accession identifier
BAA92116), Mus musculus (XP_148574), Danio rerio
(AAH66695), Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_490904),
Drosophila
Caenorhabditis
briggsae
(CAE74467),
Anopheles
gambiae
melanogaster
(NP_569915),
(EAA13064), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP_011416),

Schizosaccaromyces pombe (NP_593948), Arabidopsis thaliana (NP_172317), Zea mays (AAD41267), Encephalitozoon cuniculi (CAD26329), Eremothecium gossypii
(NP_985506) and Plasmodium falciparum (NP_702181).
The sequence corresponding to Rattus norvegicus had to be
reconstructed using an insertion from Mus musculus, probably owing to an incorrect gene prediction (XP_213604).
Phylogenetic analysis
The 14 orthologous sequences were aligned using the
ClustalW program [16]. PSI-BLAST searches on the NCBI
protein database were performed using different representatives of the YRG family as seed, according to the bibliography, and were iterated until members of the closest

Page 11 of 14

BMC Biology 2005, 3:21

subfamily were found in the list of hits. The sets of orthologous sequences were manually checked for sequence
integrity and to clarify subfamily definitions. Progressively larger multiple sequence alignments were built by
constructing multiple sequence alignments of each subfamily, which were manually polished and added
together stepwise. At each step, the parts outside the central GTPase domain, which often showed no homology
across subfamilies (and therefore should not be aligned),
were trimmed to facilitate the production of the next multiple sequence alignment. The final multiple sequence
alignment was used to produce the corresponding phylogenetic tree (excluding the non-aligned regions) using
ClustalW. The full list of sequences used for the tree and
their database identifiers are given as supplementary
material [see Additional file 1].
Cell culture, transfections, immunostaining and
fluorescence microscopy
HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) and Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/
streptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells
were seeded on to glass coverslips, Nunc plates or LabTek
dishes and were transfected using Fugene6 (Roche)
according to the manufacturer's protocols. For immunocytochemistry, transiently transfected HeLa cells were
grown on coverslips and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5
min at -20°C. The cells were then washed again and incubated in PBS for 20 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS. The cells were incubated with
primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies for
intervals of 30 min with three washing steps in between.
The coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol on glass
slides. Images of the stained cells were acquired using
either a Zeiss Cell Observer System or a Leica AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope.
GTP binding and GTPase activity measurements
Nucleotide binding was measured by the filtration
method. Recombinant proteins were incubated in 20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA,
0.5 g/l bovine serum albumin, (3H)GTP or (3H)GDP (7,7
Ci/mmol, Amersham-Pharmacia-Biotech) and cold 30
µM GTP or GDP. After incubation at 30°C for the indicated times, samples were diluted in 500 µl of ice-cold
washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM MgCl2
and 100 mM NaCl) and applied to a nitrocellulose filter
(0.45 µm, Millipore). The filters were rinsed with 4 × 4ml
ice-cold washing buffer and the radioactivity retained on
the filters was determined by scintillation counting.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/21

siRNAs transfection and western blotting
siRNA sequences were BLAST searched against the human
genome to ensure that they were specific for hLsg1. The
hLsg1 siRNA sequence showed no exact or near exact
matches to any other sequence in the human genome and
are therefore hLsg1-specific. siRNAs were synthesized by
EUROGENTEC. hLsg1 siRNA (5'-UGGAGAGAAACUGCAAGACTT-3') targets nucleotides 506–524 of human
hLsg1 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon.

Cells were seeded into 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours
later, they were transfected with 1.68 µg of siRNA per well
(unless otherwise noted). Transfections were as described
[28] with the following modifications. Additional OptiMEM (Invitrogen) was not added, and medium was
removed before transfection and replaced with 400 µl of
OptiMEM. Full-serum medium (unless otherwise noted)
was added 4 h post-transfection. At the indicated times
post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS
and detached from the plate with PBS EDTA. Whole cell
extract was obtained by lysing the cells with RIPA buffer
containing protease inhibitors and DTT. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay. Extracts
were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels (12% for actin) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were blocked overnight at 4°C in 1% non-fat dry milk (1
h at room temperature in 5% non-fat dry milk for actin),
then probed with either rabbit polyclonal anti-hLsg1 or
anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 1 h at
room temperature (overnight at 4°C for actin), washed,
and probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Signals
were detected using the ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham
Biosciences).
