Genomic profiling of plastid DNA variation in
the Mediterranean olive tree
Guillaume Besnard1,2*, Pilar Hernández3, Bouchaib Khadari4, Gabriel Dorado5 and Vincent Savolainen1,6

Abstract
Background: Characterisation of plastid genome (or cpDNA) polymorphisms is commonly used for
phylogeographic, population genetic and forensic analyses in plants, but detecting cpDNA variation is sometimes
challenging, limiting the applications of such an approach. In the present study, we screened cpDNA
polymorphism in the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) by sequencing the complete plastid genome of trees with a
distinct cpDNA lineage. Our objective was to develop new markers for a rapid genomic profiling (by Multiplex
PCRs) of cpDNA haplotypes in the Mediterranean olive tree.
Results: Eight complete cpDNA genomes of Olea were sequenced de novo. The nucleotide divergence between
olive cpDNA lineages was low and not exceeding 0.07%. Based on these sequences, markers were developed for
studying two single nucleotide substitutions and length polymorphism of 62 regions (with variable microsatellite
motifs or other indels). They were then used to genotype the cpDNA variation in cultivated and wild
Mediterranean olive trees (315 individuals). Forty polymorphic loci were detected on this sample, allowing the
distinction of 22 haplotypes belonging to the three Mediterranean cpDNA lineages known as E1, E2 and E3. The
discriminating power of cpDNA variation was particularly low for the cultivated olive tree with one predominating
haplotype, but more diversity was detected in wild populations.
Conclusions: We propose a method for a rapid characterisation of the Mediterranean olive germplasm. The low
variation in the cultivated olive tree indicated that the utility of cpDNA variation for forensic analyses is limited to
rare haplotypes. In contrast, the high cpDNA variation in wild populations demonstrated that our markers may be
useful for phylogeographic and populations genetic studies in O. europaea.

Background
In the last decades, major technical innovations have
allowed a rapid development of various methods for
genomic analysis. These have led to applications ranging
from phylogeographical reconstructions to forensic analyses and species identification [1,2]. In plants, many
studies have focused on the organelle genomes (i.e.,
plastid DNA - cpDNA - and mitochondrial DNA mtDNA) for six major reasons: (i) these genomes are
usually uniparentally inherited (either from the mother
or the father) and thus allow for investigations of gene
dispersal by seeds or pollen without recombination
effect [3]; (ii) their haploid nature facilitates their
sequencing and usually does not require cloning; (iii)

such genomes are more prone to stochastic events
because their effective population size is half that of
diploid genomes, allowing a more accurate detection of
evolutionary events such as a long persistence of relict
populations in refuge zones during last glaciations [4].
In addition the dispersion of maternally inherited genomes (due to the seed dissemination only) occurs at
shorter geographic distances than for nuclear genomes.
The consequence of a reduced gene dispersal and high
genetic drift in organelle genomes is a generally pronounced geographic structure, which facilitates phylogeographic analyses as well as tracing the origins of
cultivated species or invasive populations [3]; (iv) they
exhibit a high number of identical copies per cell [5],
which may represent a significant advantage for forensic
analyses; (v) they are circular and protected by a doublemembrane envelope, which makes them resistant to exonucleases and less prone to endonuclease degradation

(another advantage for forensics; [6]); and (vi) they exhibit a lower mutation rate than nuclear genomes [7,8],
and such stability is generally required for traceability
analyses (although see below).
The olive tree (Olea europaea, Oleaceae) is among the
oldest woody crops, and nowadays represents one of the
major cultivated species in the Mediterranean area [9].
The origins of this species have been recently investigated using different molecular techniques, including
looking at organelle variation [10-15]. These previous
studies allowed the detection of seven main cpDNA
lineages in the O. europaea complex (for the olive tree
classification see [16]): lineage E1 was detected in the
Mediterranean area and Saharan Mountains, lineages E2
and E3 were specific to the Western Mediterranean
area, lineage M was only detected in Macaronesia,
lineages C1 and C2 were observed from Southern Asia
to Eastern Africa, and lineage A was characteristic of
Tropical African olives [15]. One limitation encountered
during these studies was the particularly low level of
cpDNA and mtDNA polymorphism in the Mediterranean olive tree. Until now only seven haplotypes have
been detected with different combinations of loci
[17,18]. These haplotypes belong to lineages E1, E2 and
E3 (i.e., two or three haplotypes per lineage [15]).
Recently, the first olive plastid genome (cpDNA) was
released [18]. For detecting polymorphism in the cultivated olive tree, Mariotti and co-workers analysed
sequence variation in 21 cpDNA fragments [18]. Variable microsatellites (also known as simple sequence
repeats; SSR), insertions/deletions (indels) in repeated or
non-repeated regions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and allowed for the identification of six cpDNA haplotypes (or chlorotypes) on a
set of 30 cultivated olive trees, but they did not find
new variants compared to previous studies [17]. The
low cpDNA variation detected in the Mediterranean
lineages hampered any applications of these markers,
particularly for traceability or authenticity of olive oils
[17]. Such a low level of cpDNA polymorphism has
already been observed for other cultivated woody species
such as Prunus avium [19], Vitis vinifera [20] and Pinus
pinea [21]. This is probably due to human dispersal of
cultivated genotypes originating from a reduced gene
pool. In addition, low cpDNA polymorphism has also
been reported in forest trees and this may also stem
from low mutation rate in long-living organisms
[22-24]. However, higher cpDNA variation has been
detected in wild olives than in cultivars, and this allowed
some population genetic analyses, for instance in the
laperrinei and guanchica subspecies from Saharan
Mountains and Canary Islands, respectively [25-27].
Additional investigations are needed to maximise the
cpDNA haplotype identification in olive trees by testing

new markers (especially multiallelic microsatellites [28])
on representatives of both cultivated and wild pools.
Here, we address this challenge. Firstly, we sequenced
the complete plastid genomes of seven O. europaea
accessions, including one Spanish cultivar (’Manzanilla
de Sevilla’) and six wild olive trees. These taxa were
chosen to represent the seven lineages previously
reported in the olive tree complex [15]. We also report
the complete plastid genome of O. woodiana, a taxon
belonging to sect. Ligustroides, which is the sister
clade to O. europaea [29]. Secondly, based on these
genome sequences, we developed a method for a rapid
and routine characterisation of length variation in 62
regions plus two cleaved amplified polymorphism
sequence loci (CAPS). A set of 186 cultivars (including
both major varieties and local types) as well as five
distant wild olive tree populations (129 individuals)
were characterised using this approach. Based on the
observed polymorphism, we propose an optimised set
of primers to detect Mediterranean haplotypes. We
also discuss the utility of this approach for forensic
analysis as well as for phylogeographic analyses of the
olive tree complex.

Results and Discussion
In this study, eight complete olive tree plastid genomes
were sequenced and deposited in GenBank/EMBL under
the accession numbers FN650747, FN996943, FN996944,
FN996972, FN997650, FN997651, FN998900 and
FN998901. Polymorphisms were used for the development of new markers to scan cpDNA variation. These
loci were used to characterise both cultivated and wild
olive trees to assess their utility for forensic and phylogeographic studies. Our general approach is summarised
in Figure 1.
Variation in olive tree chloroplast genomes

The cpDNA genome sizes vary between 155,531 base
pairs (bp; lineage C2; Almhiwit 5.1) and 155,896 bp
(lineage M; Imouzzer S1). As suspected by Besnard &
Bervillé [30] based on RFLPs, two long indels were
observed in the seven olive tree cpDNA genomes: a
342-bp deletion (in the ycf1 gene) was observed in lineage E3 (Gué de Constantine 20), while a 225-bp deletion
(in the trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacer) was detected in
both individuals from South Asia (lineages C1 and C2).
In addition, 15 smaller indels (i.e., inferior or equal to
12 bp, excluding microsatellite motifs) were also
detected. Five of these indels correspond to the presence/absence of a repeated motif of seven to 12 bp
(i.e., composed of one or two motifs; located at nucleotide 7,328, 9,526, 14,693, 83,196 and 85,059 in the ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ sequence; see GenBank/EMBL
accession no FN996972).

Sequence variation was low, with a total of 218 substitutions on the seven olive plastid genomes. A maximum
of 106 substitutions (0.07%) was detected between Gué
de Constantine 20 (Algeria) and Almhiwit 5.1 (Yemen),
while cpDNA genomes of Guangzhou 1 (China) and
Almhiwit 5.1 (Yemen) only showed 34 substitutions
(Additional file 1). The plastid genome of O. woodiana
displays between 417 and 432 substitutions (< 0.28%)
when compared to the seven O. europaea genomes.
Again, this level of variation is surprisingly low if we
consider that the divergence between sections Olea
(O. europaea) and Ligustroides (O. woodiana) is estimated to be between 14 and 22 million years (My; [29]).
Based on these results, the cpDNA substitution rate was
estimated to be between 1.2 × 10-10 and 2 × 10-10 in the
Olea subgenus, which is about ten times lower than the
typical mutation rate reported for the plastid genome
[7]. This slow molecular evolution might be related to
the long generation time of the olive tree [23,24].
Twelve differences (i.e., three length polymorphisms
and nine SNPs, of which one is located in the inverted
repeat) were observed between the genomes of ‘Frantoio’ (GenBank/EMBL accession GU931818; Italy; [18])
and ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ (Spain; this study). According
to our approach, we re-sequenced the variable regions
in ‘Frantoio’, from the Olive World Germplasm Bank
(OWGB) at Córdoba, Spain (GenBank/EMBL accessions
no. FR754486 to FR754495), but these polymorphisms
were not confirmed. These 12 differences are not
located in the cpDNA regions screened for sequence
variation by Mariotti et al. [18] and may be seen as
putative sequencing mistakes in accession GU931818.

Considering this fact, our analyses indicate that ‘Frantoio’ and ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ display the same plastid
genome, supporting a common maternal origin for
these two cultivars.
Based only on nucleotide substitutions (i.e., only 65
out of 218 substitutions were parsimony-informative in
the olive tree complex), phylogenetic relationships were
depicted from the complete cpDNA genomes using
both maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) techniques (Figure 2). The resulting topologies confirm results from Besnard et al. [15,29] through
the recovery of two main clades: a Mediterranean/North
African clade (clade Cp-II) including lineages E1, E2, E3
and M, and a cuspidata clade (clade Cp-I) including
lineages C1, C2 and A. In clade Cp-II, moderate bootstrap support for an early-diverging position of lineage
E3 (Gué de Constantine 20) agrees with results based
on a few cpDNA microsatellites, indels and CAPS [15].
A moderate level of support was also recovered for the
clustering of lineages E1 and E2. Only nine informative
substitutions were detected in clade Cp-II, three of
them being non-synonymous (Table 1). The information
brought by these sites does not strongly support any
relationship, suggesting that some sites may be homoplastic. Indeed, two of the three non-synonymous substitutions (52,165 and 83,304) are polymorphic in both
clades Cp-I and Cp-II, suggesting that these sites could
be under selective pressures, either maintaining polymorphism or contributing to the recurrent appearance
of the same substitution (see also [18]). Understanding
the molecular variation at these non-synonymous sites
would deserve the design of an experiment to test their
origin and their adaptive significance.
Development of cpDNA markers

The low cpDNA substitution rate combined with possible selective effects (which can be problematic for phylogenetic reconstructions [31]) led us to focus on
“length polymorphisms”. Such polymorphisms were
either the result of a variable number of repeats in a
microsatellite motif (referred as “microsatellites”), or
another type of insertion/deletion (referred as “indel”).
Sixty-two regions, of which 51 display variable microsatellite motifs, were investigated (Additional file 2). These
sites are located in non-coding regions (except for loci
61 in ycf1) and can thus be considered as mostly neutral. The list of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers
to amplify the 62 regions is given in Additional file 2.
Two CAPS loci (located in rpl14 and the petA-psbJ
intergenic spacer) were also characterised to allow the
distinction of new haplotypes in lineage E1 (see Methods). After the characterisation of 315 cultivated and
wild trees, a multilocus profile (or cpDNA haplotype)
was defined for each individual (Additional file 3a).

genomes. The same topology was obtained with maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood (GTR+I+G) analyses. The bootstrap values are
given on each branch (when superior to 50%), the first corresponding to the MP analysis and the second (in brackets) to the ML analysis. The
Forsythia europaea and Olea woodiana sequences were used as outgroups. The tree was rooted with the Forsythia sequence. The two clades CpI and Cp-II are indicated according to Besnard et al. [15].

Therefore, they may be granted a label of protected designation of origin (PDO; a European Union label referring to food products specific to a particular region or
town, conveying a particular quality or characteristic of
the specified area). Our markers could find some applications in the traceability of such high quality olive oils,
but their discriminating power needs to be determined
for assessing their putative utility. Using our cpDNA
loci, 12 haplotypes were detected in cultivars (Table 2,
Figure 3a and Additional file 3): hence our approach
permitted a two-fold increase of the number of detected
variants compared to previous studies [17,18]. The most
frequent haplotype (E1.1) was detected in 77% of cultivars, including ‘Frantoio’ and ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’.
Two other haplotypes (E1.2 and E3.2) displayed a frequency superior to 5%, but the remaining haplotypes

Also, an 88-year old herbarium leaf sample was successfully characterised, suggesting that our method is appropriate for investigating cpDNA variation even on poorly
preserved DNA. A total of 40 loci were polymorphic in
the Mediterranean/North African olive tree (Additional
file 3b). We hope that data generated using this method
by different laboratories could be compared to generate
a reference dataset for the Mediterranean olive tree. In
this way, it should be possible to reconstruct a detailed
phylogeography of the species based on a large number
of populations, as has been done, for instance, for the
European white oaks [32].

Some olive tree varieties are used to produce high-quality (and thus more expensive) extra virgin olive oil.

Previous cpDNA phylogeographic studies of the Mediterranean olive tree have been limited due to the low
number of haplotypes detected [17,18]. Here, we
demonstrate that a genomic profiling approach of the
plastid DNA mostly based on microsatellites and indels
can solve this problem. The high variation detected in
five distant wild populations indicates a high potential
of our approach for resolving the Mediterranean olive
tree history. One putative limitation is the level of
homoplasy on microsatellite motifs, reported by different authors [39-42], and which could prove problematic
when accurately identifying evolutionary relationships
between haplotypes. We reconstructed a reduced median network based on molecular markers (Figure 3c).
The Mediterranean haplotypes clustered into three
lineages (E1, E2 and E3), while the haplotype of subsp.
maroccana formed a fourth lineage (M) in northern
Africa. This topology is fully congruent with Besnard et
al. [15,29], who used different cpDNA data (i.e., microsatellites, indels and CAPS, or nucleotides). Each lineage
displays at least one specific indel, with the exception of
lineage M (Figure 3c). Phylogenetic relationships remain
unresolved at the base of lineages E1 and E2, as well as
in the centre of the network, as a consequence of homoplasy between haplotypes belonging to different lineages
(e.g., shared length polymorphisms between clades Cp-I
and Cp-II at loci 1, 2, 9, 17, 25, 38, 47, 48, 49, 50 and
58; Additional file 3). Such a difficulty for determining
the ancestral state hampers the correct identification of
historical links between divergent lineages. In contrast,
we expect that homoplasy will not be a serious limitation to resolve phylogenetic relationships among
lineages, since their haplotypes have diverged more
recently [42]. In any case, for an optimal analysis of the
cpDNA variation at the population level, possible length
homoplasy will need to be considered and the use of
appropriate models will be necessary [41,43].

individuals may reveal nucleotide substitutions that

were rare, and sometimes detected only once (i.e., L1.1,
E2.3, E2.5 and E2.6) or twice (i.e., E1.3, E2.2 and E3.1).
Several of these rare haplotypes were detected in local
cultivars with a limited economic importance (e.g., E2.5,
E2.6 and L1.1). The probability that two samples chosen
at random display a different haplotype was low (D =
0.40) when compared to nuclear markers, especially
nuclear microsatellites for which the discriminating
power per locus generally exceeds 0.70 [33-35]. This indicates that the utility of the cpDNA variation for forensic
analysis is restricted to rare haplotypes such as the ones
detected for ‘Picholine’ (E2.1) and ‘Olivière’ (E3.1) in
France, ‘Villalonga’-’Blanqueta’ (E1.3), ‘Farga’ (E3.1) and
‘Lechín de Sevilla’ (E2.3) in Spain, or ‘Megaritiki’ (E2.2) in
Greece. These varieties are used to produce high quality
extra virgin olive oil (e.g., for Spanish cultivars see [36]).
The cpDNA variation, which is a priori easily analysable
compared to nuclear single-copy genes, should thus be
helpful to complement other procedures for olive traceability based on nuclear polymorphisms [e.g., [37]].
In the five populations of oleasters, 18 cpDNA haplotypes were detected, ten of which were shared with
cultivars (Table 2, Figure 3b and Additional file 3).

would be of interest [18] for the development of new
molecular markers like SNPs (or CAPS). Such SNPs
could be used to improve our approach. Nevertheless,
the homoplasy is not restricted to repetitive sequences
as illustrated with non-synonymous sites in genes under
selection, such as the polymorphism detected at the
CAPS-XapI locus (in rpl14; Table 1). In the present
study, we found restriction polymorphism at this locus
in lineages E1 and E2 (clade Cp-II) and also in clade
Cp-I (for which we analysed only three accessions;
Figure 3c) indicating that this site is highly homoplastic
(see also Mariotti et al. [18]). Thus, this site should be
used with caution for phylogeographic purposes. Nevertheless, we consider that it could bring potentially
important information at the lineage level, particularly
to solve the origin of haplotype E1.2 in the cultivated
gene pool (7% of cultivars).

Conclusions
A set of 40 polymorphic loci (including 35 with microsatellite motifs) is released for a rapid cpDNA characterization of the Mediterranean olive tree germplasm (see
Methods, and Table 3). We expect that, besides their
potential forensics application, their use will be important for phylogeographic analyses. Particularly, such studies should allow testing for the persistence of relict
populations in the Mediterranean Basin [44], as well as
to test the hypotheses about their post-glacial expansion
and subsequent domestication [15,45]. In addition, the
identification of genuinely wild populations may represent a significant evolutionary heritage for the conservation of the Mediterranean olive tree diversity. Lastly, the
combined use of both nuclear and cpDNA resources

genetic diversity. For example, our cpDNA markers will
have applications for a comparative study of the
dynamic of wild olive tree populations in different environments, such as archipelagos and Saharan mountains
[25,26]. Such information may be relevant for defining
appropriate strategies of prospection and in situ conservation of the wild olive tree.

Methods
The general approach is summarised in Figure 1.
Chloroplast genome sequencing

In order to maximize polymorphism detection, the analysis focused on seven individuals of O. europaea L.
(subgenus Olea sect. Olea, or olive tree complex), which
were chosen to represent one haplotype of each previously described lineage [15]. The following genotypes
were thus investigated: ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ (Spanish
cultivar; lineage E1), oleaster “Haut Atlas 1” (Morocco;
lineage E2), oleaster “Gué de Constantine 20” (Algeria;
lineage E3), subsp. maroccana “Imouzzer S1” (Morocco;
lineage M), subsp. cuspidata “Maui 1” (Hawaii; lineage
A), subsp. cuspidata “Guangzhou CH1” (China; lineage
C1), and subsp. cuspidata “Almhiwit C5.1” (Yemen;
lineage C2). In addition, we characterised one outgroup
species [O. woodiana Knobl. subsp. woodiana (South
Africa); sect. Ligustroides Benth. & Hook.], which
belongs to the sister group of O. europaea [16,29].

Appropriate PCR primers were designed to amplify 105
overlapping cpDNA fragments (Additional file 4). Each
PCR reaction (25 μl) contained 10 ng DNA template, 1×
reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μmol
of each primer, and 0.75 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The reaction mixtures
were incubated in a thermocycler (T1; Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 36 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C (denaturing), 30 s at the annealing temperature (Additional file 4), and 2 min at 72°C (extension). The last cycle was followed by a 10-min extension
at 72°C. Direct sequencing of PCR amplicons was performed with an ABI Prism 3100xl Genetic Analyzer,
using the Big Dye v3.1 Terminator cycle-sequencing kit,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Additionally, nested
(internal) primers were also designed to complete the
sequencing of each fragment (Additional file 4). The
eight Olea genomes were thus reconstructed using a
similar approach to the one used by Mariotti et al. [18].
Characterisation of cpDNA polymorphisms in the
Mediterranean olive tree

Based on the seven O. europaea sequences, length polymorphism was detected in 62 regions. These polymorphisms were either due to a variable number of
repeats in a microsatellite motif or another type of indel
(Additional file 2). The PCR primers were designed in

Besnard et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:80
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/80

flanking regions to specifically amplify short segments
(generally inferior to 240 bp). For locus multiplexing,
the annealing temperature of all these primers needed
to be similar, while the size of PCR products of each
locus should be as different as possible. Finally, these
primers were also designed to allow amplification of
short DNA segments for characterization of poorly preserved material and highly degraded DNAs from herbarium samples. Additionally, the 5’ end of the reverse
primer of locus 19 was tagged with the sequence
GTGTCTT to minimize band stuttering. All primer
pairs and specific characteristics of generated fragments
are given in Additional file 2. To reduce the cost of the
PCR characterization (i.e., time and costs), we used the
method described by Schuelke [46]. For each locus
(except loci 8, 10, and 61), an 18-bp tail of M13 was
added on the forward primer (Additional file 2). When
each locus was amplified separately, each PCR reaction
(25 μl) contained 10 ng DNA template, 1× reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μmol of one
universal fluorescent-labelled M13(-21) primer (5’TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3’; labelled with one of
the three following fluorochromes: HEX, 6-FAM or
NED), 0.2 μmol of the reverse primer, 0.05 μmol of the
forward primer, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega). The reaction mixtures were incubated in a
T1 thermocycler for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 28 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 57°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and
then by 8 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 51.5°C, and 1
min at 72°C. The last cycle was followed by a 20-min
extension at 72°C. Usually, we amplified five or six loci
in the same reaction, but in this case, the MgCl2 concentration was increased to 5 mM, and the concentration of primers (except the labelled M13 primer) was
decreased by five or six. Loci 8, 10, and 61 (without the
M13 tail) were amplified separately with the following
conditions: each PCR reaction (25 μl) contained 10 ng
DNA template, 1× reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 0.2 μmol of each primer, and 0.75 U of Taq DNA
polymerase. The reaction mixtures were incubated in a T1
thermocycler for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 36 cycles of
30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 53°C, and 2 min at 72°C. The last
cycle was followed by a 10-min extension at 72°C.
The PCR products labelled with a fluorochrome were
mixed together with GeneScan-500 ROX as internal
standard to run the maximum of loci at the same time
(considering the colour and the expected allele size
range). They were separated on an ABI Prism 3100xl
Genetic Analyzer and the fragment size was determined
with GeneMapper version 4.0. For the two non-labelled
loci 8 and 61, indels of 342 and 225 bp were revealed
under UV after migration on a 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA,
USA).

We also focused on the characterisation of two substitutions, which were detected by Mariotti et al. [18] in
lineage E1 (the most frequent one in cultivated olive
trees; see [13,17]) and may be potentially useful for forensic analyses and the study of olive tree domestication.
We chose to develop two Cleaved Amplified Polymorphism Site (CAPS) loci as in Besnard et al. [47], in
order to rapidly characterise a high number of individuals. The PCR primers are given in Additional file 2.
The two loci were amplified following the same PCR
conditions as for microsatellites. The PCR products
were digested with a restriction enzyme (EcoRI or XapI)
according to the manufacturer recommendations. The
restricted fragments of the two loci were then mixed
(with the internal standard ROX 500) and separated on
an ABI Prism 3100 xl Genetic Analyzer. The polymorphism for the presence/absence of a restriction site
was scored for each genotype. The possibility of multiplexing three different colours (e.g., NED, FAM and
HEX) allows the characterisation of 288 (96 × 3) samples per run.
We then characterised 186 cultivated olive tree accessions from different areas with the 64 loci (Table 2, Figure 3a and Additional file 5). The analyzed germplasm
includes 106 cultivars from the OWGB Córdoba [48].
These cultivars represent major cultivars from all Mediterranean countries. A few local cultivars from different
places were also included in our study for a better
representativeness of the cultivated gene pool. First, we
characterized 55 cultivated local forms from Morocco
(41) and Corsica-Sardinia (14) previously genotyped
with nuclear markers [49,50]. In addition, cultivated
trees with or without known denominations from
Algeria-Tunisia (6), Italy (6), France (2), Greece-Turkey
(3), the Levantine region (5), Libya-Egypt-Sudan (2) and
South Africa (1) were added to this study. Beforehand,
we tested with nuclear microsatellites that these latter
accessions were genetically different (G. Besnard,
unpubl. data), except for one herbarium leaf sample
from Kufra, Libya (Newberry, sn; 1933 - Kew Herbarium). In addition, to assess the cpDNA variation in the
wild Mediterranean olive trees, 129 individuals from five
distant populations (Figure 3b) were also characterized:
Rajo (Syria; 36°43’50’’N, 36°40’00’’E), Gialova (Greece;
36°55’12’’N, 21°42’42’’E), Pugnochiuso (Italy; 41°47’46’’N,
16°10’05’’E), Minorca (Spain; 39°56’52’’N, 04°14’42’’E)
and Bin El Ouidane (Morocco; 32°03’00’’N, 06°35’00’’W).
To test the reproducibility of the method, the characterisation of ten accessions (i.e., ‘Picholine Marocaine’,
‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’, ‘Frantoio’, ‘Moraiolo’, ‘Ciarasina’,
‘Confetto’, ‘Itrana’, ‘Giaraffa’, ‘Kalamon’ and ‘Souri’) were
repeated three times at random.
Based on this analysis of wild and cultivated accessions,
40 polymorphic loci were detected in the Mediterranean

Besnard et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:80

olive trees (Additional file 3). We first proposed to combine 36 of these loci for a rapid characterisation of Mediterranean olive tree germplasm. The multiplex PCRs of
five or six loci are proposed in Table 3, but this can be
easily modified. The PCR conditions are those previously
reported (with the M13 primer). After PCR, these products are mixed together (with no overlap for allele size
between loci in a given colour). The locus 10, which
needs to be amplified separately, is combined with these
multiplex PCRs. Second, when amplified in a multiplex
PCR, we encountered some difficulties with locus 19 (not
reported in Table 3), and we thus recommend to use it
separately and to combine it with the two CAPS (CAPSXapI and CAPS-EcoRI) for a second combination of
three loci. Lastly, the locus 61 is independently characterised on 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.

not for indels versus microsatellites did not affect the
topology. In addition, for loci combining indels and
microsatellite motifs (loci 10, 11, 54 and 57), we separately coded the two types of characters based on available sequences for these loci. The matrix used for the
analysis is given in Additional file 6.
The probability that two individuals taken at random
display a different haplotype was computed as D = 1 - Σ
pi2 , where p i is the frequency of the haplotype i. This
parameter was calculated separately on cultivated and
wild olive trees, but also on sub-samples or populations.
The groups of cultivated olive trees were defined
according to their geographic origin.

Data analysis

A phylogenetic tree based on the complete plastid genomes was constructed. A partial cpDNA sequence of
Forsythia (DQ673256; [51]) was used as an outgroup to
root the tree. Sequences were aligned with the application MEGA v4.1 [52]. The alignment was manually
refined. Firstly, a maximum parsimony analysis was performed. All characters were equally weighted. The gaps
were treated as missing data. A heuristic search was
used to find the most parsimonious trees. The closeneighbor-interchange algorithm was used with a search
level of 3, as recommended and implemented in the
software [52]. The searches included 100 replications of
random addition sequences. All the best trees were
retained. A strict consensus tree was generated from the
equally most-parsimonious trees. The bootstrap values
were computed using 10,000 replicates. Secondly, the
tree inference was made under a maximum likelihood
criterion, using the application PHYML v3.0 [53]. The
best-fit substitution model, determined through hierarchical likelihood ratio tests, was the GTR model, with
invariable sites and a gamma shape parameter estimated
from the data. Support values were obtained by 1,000
bootstrap replicates. Based on fragment genotyping (i.e.,
microsatellites and indels), the relationships among
cpDNA haplotypes were visualized by constructing a
reduced median network implemented in the application
NETWORK v4.112 [54]. Multi-state microsatellites were
treated as ordered alleles and coded by the number of
repeated motifs for each allele (e.g., number of T or A;
see also [15]) whereas the presence or absence of other
indels was coded as 1 and 0, respectively. Basically, this
coding strategy assumes that variation at cpDNA microsatellites is mainly due to single-step mutations (e.g.,
[15,18]), while allowing consideration of length polymorphisms (microsatellites or indels) with similar
weight. However, whether we used different weights or
