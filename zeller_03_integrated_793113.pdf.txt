binds DNA sites that vary from this palindromic hexanucleotide canonical sequence [3]. DNA microarrays, as well as
other methods for detecting differential gene expression,
have led to the discovery of a vast new collection of Mycresponsive genes. These responsive genes are probably clustered into distinct transcriptomes that are cell-type and species specific, and can be further distinguished by whether they
are directly or indirectly regulated by Myc. Only through the
collective examination of the responsive genes will these transcriptomes become apparent. As such, we launched a Myc
Target Gene database to begin to assemble and annotate individual Myc-responsive genes [1].

information

The MYC proto-oncogene encodes a prototypical oncogenic
transcription factor that plays a central role in the genesis of
many different human cancers [1,2]. MYC belongs to the family of myc genes that also includes Bmyc, MYCL and MYCN.
First identified as the cellular homolog of the oncogenic retroviral v-myc oncogene, the MYC gene was then found to be
altered by chromosomal translocation or amplification in
human cancers. More recently, the deregulated expression of
MYC in a wide variety of human cancers has become more
apparent with the emergence of DNA microarray gene
expression profiles.

subtractive hybridization [6]. Most of these putative targets
exhibit no other evidence suggesting that they are directly
responsive to c-Myc alone or to both c-Myc and other transcription factors which work coordinately with Myc. It has
become a challenge to decipher which genetic targets, and
thus which cellular pathways, are directly influenced by Myc
in specific experimental systems. Various strategies have
been utilized to provide additional evidence for direct Myc
regulation of a small number of target genes. These include
regulation by the Myc-estrogen receptor (MycER) chimeric
protein (either in the presence or absence of cycloheximide),
promoter reporter assays, expression following serum stimulation and correlation of expression with that of Myc in various cell systems. However, none of these approaches provide
definitive evidence that a gene is a direct transcriptional target of Myc. One method, chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), identifies genomic sequences that are bound by Myc
in vivo, and provides substantial evidence that a gene is
directly regulated by Myc [7].
Recently, we determined that bona fide c-Myc-binding sites
that have been experimentally verified by ChIP, could be predicted from interspecies genomic sequence comparisons [8].
Most of the c-Myc targets we analyzed comprised one class of
genes in which the canonical 5'-CACGTG-3' E-box, shown to
be bound by c-Myc in vivo, is conserved between human and
one or more rodent sequences. We sought to expand this
analysis to genes for which there is a fair amount of evidence
of direct regulation by Myc but which have not been analyzed
by ChIP. The Myc Target Gene database [1] is the ideal starting point for this analysis. Here, we describe this database
and the Myc Cancer Gene website [9]. Since this database
allows for the prioritization of Myc-responsive genes according to the level of experimental evidence, we have applied the
findings from the database to the identification of bona fide
Myc target genes via phylogenetic sequence comparisons and
the use of ChIP assays.

Myc Cancer Gene website and Target Gene
database

The Myc website was designed to be a warehouse for information about Myc-responsive genes, altered MYC in human cancers and Myc protein-protein interactions. The website has an
introduction to cancer genes for the lay public. The first of
three databases is the Myc Target Gene database that includes
all Myc-responsive genes reported in the literature. An international advisory board provides oversight of the content of
the database and advises on references that may have been
missed. In addition, the website provides a means for users to
communicate with the advisory board and the website organizer. The database is updated quarterly unless a new, significant publication requires more immediate attention. The
website also provides information and references on alterations of MYC genes in human cancers and links to a c-Myc
protein-protein interaction database.

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R69

The Myc Target Gene database is searchable and provides an
ability to prioritize the putative target genes according to the
experimental evidence supporting the validity of the gene in
question as an authentic target gene. The genes are listed with
names given in the literature with priority given to official
names in the LocusLink database, to which each entry is
linked [10]. The 'description' of the gene is that given in
LocusLink unless there is no official entry, in which case the
best literature description is entered. Each gene, where possible, is characterized by the function of its product. The terms
used are similar to those used for the Gene Ontology consortium [11]. However, we have simplified the functions and they
are listed in a pull-down menu that facilitates the search function. Each gene is annotated as to whether it is upregulated
(U) or downregulated (D) in response to Myc induction or
overexpression. In cases where different studies reported different responses, for example upregulated in one study but
downregulated in another, the entry of the gene is duplicated
with the specific references cited at the end of the row of the
table. References are provided as direct links to PubMed [12].
The level of experimental evidence for each gene is tabulated
according to the technique used (M, microarray; D, differential cloning; S, SAGE; G, guess) as well as other specific experimental outcomes. An approach using the Myc-estrogen
receptor hormone-binding domain allows investigators to
determine whether a Myc-responsive gene behaves as a direct
target gene [13]. A direct target is considered to be one for
which c-Myc by itself is sufficient for its induction without an
intermediate that requires new protein synthesis. In this system, the chimeric MycER protein is constitutively expressed
and bound to the chaperone HSP90. Upon binding estrogenic
compounds, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the chimeric protein alters its conformation, disengages from the chaperone
and translocates into the nucleus. The translocated MycER
protein recognizes genomic targets and initiates transcription
of target genes without requiring newly-synthesized proteins.
On the basis of this concept, it is assumed that genes responding to ligand-stimulated MycER in the presence of cycloheximide are direct target genes. Two columns in the Myc
database highlight the evidence, if any, from experiments
with the inducible MycER system. The MycER system, however, would not identify a hypothetical class of target genes
that requires both c-Myc and a target of c-Myc that encodes a
transcription factor. This factor, in turn, cooperates with cMyc in a feed-forward loop to induce the expression of yet
another c-Myc target gene.
More fundamental observations are also annotated such as
whether nuclear run-on studies were performed to support
the hypothesis that a candidate gene is upregulated at the
transcriptional level. Only a minority of the putative targets
has been studied using nuclear run-on experiments. Another
consideration is the time course of response to serum or
growth stimulation (induction kinetics), which induces c-Myc
expression followed rapidly by expression of c-Myc

responsive and other genes. With the availability of the Rat1
fibroblast cell lines that lack both copies of c-myc through
homologous recombination, Myc-responsive genes are
characterized according to their expression in wild-type versus Myc null fibroblasts [14]. The database also notes whether
a specific study surveyed different cell lines with varied Myc
expression for the corresponding expression of a target gene
in question. A column is dedicated to acknowledge target
gene studies that used primary cells and vectors that force the
expression of Myc in these non-immortalized, non-transformed cells.

information

To determine whether c-Myc could directly bind conserved Eboxes, ChIP was performed with anti-Myc antibody, a control
anti-hepatic growth factor (HGF) antibody, or no antibody
using the human P493 B-cell line. PCR primers were designed
to amplify two distinct regions, A and B, from each target
locus. For each gene, fragment A contains or lies within 100
bp of the conserved binding sites whereas fragment B represents a negative control sequence up to 10 kb away from

interactions

Taken in aggregate, the Myc-responsive genes cluster into
distinct functional groups. The largest group, with 120
entries, involves metabolism followed by protein synthesis
with 82 entries. Twenty-five entries involve cell-cycle control
and five are important for DNA replication. Fifteen, which are
downregulated, involve cell adhesion. Interestingly, 24
entries involve chaperonins. This comprehensive view of
Myc-responsive genes suggests that Myc affects gene expression globally. This view is compatible with a recent ChIP
study suggesting that Myc may play a more general role in
transcription [15].

Figure 2 presents regulograms, graphical representations of
the number of shared transcription factor binding sites in the
context of high sequence conservation between two
sequences, of six of the candidate genes plus NPM1. The regulograms are from the TraFaC database [18] and include the
regions from each target gene that were analyzed by ChIP.
The colored regions represent sequences that are at least 50%
identical between human and mouse. All of these targets contain one or more conserved canonical Myc-binding sites in
genomic regions exhibiting high levels of sequence identity.
For instance, the entire APEX1 locus, which contains five
exons and spans roughly 3 kb of sequence, is highly conserved. Within this locus, we identified three conserved
canonical E-boxes, one in the promoter and two in exon 1 of
the human gene.

refereed research

The database (13 April 2003) contains 647 entries from a total
of 117 references. Out of 647 entries 42 have three or more different references supporting them as Myc-responsive genes
(Table 1). PTMA, ODC1, LDHA, NCL and NPM1 are highest
on the list for the number of references. The vast majority of
the entries represent only a more broad-based individual
study using DNA microarray or SAGE. Comparison of SAGE
data with the database reveals 61 out of 91 SAGE entries
match with genes from other studies.

The cell system chosen for subsequent validation of these
genes is the human B-cell line P493 that carries a tet-repressible exogenous MYC construct [16]. Untreated, exponentially
growing P493 cells express roughly 30-fold higher MYC
mRNA and protein levels than cells exposed to tetracycline
for 72 hours (Figure 1a). As measured by quantitative realtime PCR, all candidate Myc target genes, with the exception
of BAX, showed a significant (greater than 3.5-fold) elevation
in mRNA levels in the untreated versus tet-treated B cells
(Figure 1b). NPM1, which we previously identified as a direct
Myc target, was used here as a positive control for both the
gene expression and ChIP experiments [17].

Features of Myc-responsive genes

The Myc Target Gene database allows for the prioritization of
putative target genes according to the level of experimental
evidence that supports the candidacy of a specific gene as
being a direct Myc target. While chromatin immunoprecipitation provides the best evidence for direct target genes, many
of the genes identified by differential gene expression analysis
have not been validated by ChIP. From this database, we
sought to identify candidate-direct Myc target genes that
exhibit positive data in at least four supportive experimental
categories but, as yet, have not been validated by chromatin
immunoprecipitation. From this list of 12 candidate genes, we
identified, by phylogenetic sequence analysis, one or more
conserved E-boxes in either the promoter or intron 1 of
APEX1, BAX, DDX18, CDC25A, EIF4E, TOB3 and RCL.
These seven genes were chosen for further analysis.

reports

Another feature of the database that is of fundamental importance is the annotation of the approaches taken to establish
the interaction of Myc with the genomic locus of a target gene.
The use of chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter assays
in transient transfection experiments, gel mobility shift
assays and other techniques are shown in the database, when
available. A number of columns are searchable for prioritization. For example, the database is able to prioritize according
to whether genes have been validated by ChIP assays.

Given that there is a wide range of experimental models, the
database gives the cell type and species used in the collective
studies for any specific gene. It is likely that patterns will
emerge demonstrating a universal effect of Myc on a subset of
genes independent of cell type. The patterns will also reveal
tissue-specific effects of Myc when the database is further
enriched.

It is notable that the DDX18 gene was originally identified as
a c-Myc target by a chromatin immunoprecipitation screen
with anti-Myc and anti-Max antibodies [21]. However, the
initial precipitated cloned sequence was from a processed
pseudogene segment corresponding to exon 6 of the functional gene. The identification of this pseudogene segment led

Our studies reported here combine a Myc-responsive gene
database with phylogenetic footprinting and chromatin
immunoprecipitation to validate a small set of candidate
genes as direct c-Myc targets. We provide proof-of-concept
that the use of phylogenetic footprinting is effective in predicting genomic Myc-binding sites. We found no evidence for
the association of c-Myc to a canonical E-box found in a pseudogene, which has a corresponding authentic c-Myc target
expressed gene, DDX18. Despite the elevated amounts of cMyc protein in this B-cell model, we did not find promiscuous
association of c-Myc to the DDX pseudogene or to other nonconserved canonical E-boxes found in the control B regions of
NPM1 and CDC25A. The CDC25A gene was found to be associated with c-Myc through an evolutionarily conserved noncanonical (5'-CACATG-3') E-box indicating that broadening
of the phylogenetic footprinting to non-canonical c-Mycbinding sites may be fruitful in the validation of direct Myc

region A. It should be noted in Figure 3 that all predicted evolutionarily conserved E-box-containing DNA regions A were
precipitated specifically with anti-Myc in the ChIP experiments. Glucokinase, which contains a promoter E-box but is
not expressed in B cells, and all B fragments displayed only a
background signal in the ChIP experiments. These findings
provide proof-of-concept for the use of the database and phylogenetic footprinting and validate APEX1, BAX, DDX18,
EIF4E, RCL and TOB3 as direct c-Myc target genes. Since we
began these studies, two recent publications reporting
genomic targets of c-Myc provide further evidence for the
direct binding of c-Myc to APEX1, BAX, EIF4E and TOB3
[19,20]. Taken together, these studies support the strategy
that we describe in this paper for the identification of candidate direct c-Myc target genes through the use of the Myc target gene database, phylogenetic footprinting and ChIP. The
CDC25A gene does not contain an evolutionarily conserved
canonical E-box and was investigated further as described
below.

Evidence for CDC25A as a c-Myc target was provided primarily by promoter-reporter assays, which do not reflect in situ
binding of c-Myc to its target genomic sites [22]. Whilst we
did not find a conserved canonical E-box (5'-CACGTG-3') we
did find four non-canonical (5'-CATGTG-3') intron 1 E-boxes
of which one is evolutionarily conserved (Figure 4). ChIP
demonstrates that region A (conserved E-box) and region B
(three E-boxes) were both significantly associated with c-Myc
whereas the promoter region (Pr) and region C, corresponding to a region of intron 2, are not associated with c-Myc. Our
ChIP findings contrast with the promoter-reporter assays,
which showed high promoter-reporter activities for the
intron 2 canonical Myc E-box region and lower activities for
the intron 1 regions. Our findings do not support the association of c-Myc with the canonical intron 2 E-box. Furthermore,
the intron 2 E-box lies within an Alu repeat element and it is
unknown what, if any, role these sequences play in the regulation of gene expression. We surmise from these
observations that reporter-promoter assays have grave limitations since they do not reflect the in situ status of the
genomic sequences. Here, however, we provide the first evidence that conserved non-canonical E-boxes are bound by
cMyc in vivo and may play a significant role in the regulation
of direct Myc target genes.

to the identification of DDX18 as an authentic c-Myc target
gene. This observation raises the important question of
whether c-Myc is able to bind to E-boxes found in the pseudogene and exon 6 of the functional gene versus the phylogenetically-conserved E-box we mapped in the DDX18 promoter.
To address this specifically, we examined the relative
recovery of the DDX18 promoter versus exon 6 sequences in
our ChIP experiments. As seen in Figure 3, no significant
immunoprecipitated exon 6 sequences, represented by fragment B, were present in any of our ChIP samples. We surmise
from these observations that c-Myc does not bind to the pseudogene sequence, but rather to the expressed DDX18 gene in
the promoter region bearing a conserved Myc E-box.

In conclusion, we provide proof-of-concept that a publiclyaccessible database can be combined with sequence analysis
and ChIP to begin to establish the transcriptional regulatory
network underlying the ability of c-Myc to manifest its oncogenic properties in cancer cells. The future challenge is to
exploit the database to identify transcription factors that

cooperate with c-Myc to regulate subsets of functionally similar genes or functional transcriptomes (in the same metabolic pathway, for example) and transcriptional regulatory
loops involved in c-Myc mediated phenotypes.

target genes by ChIP. It is notable that we have demonstrated
previously another class (Class II) of genomic c-Myc-binding
sites that may have drifted during evolution and hence are not
conserved between species [8].

Figure 2
Regulogr (continued from previous page)
Regulograms of Myc targets analyzed by genomic sequence comparison and ChIP. Human and mouse sequences are aligned in each regulogram which
depicts in colored regions the sequences with greater than 50% identity. Within these regions, the percentage of sequence identity is represented on the
top line and the number of conserved transcription factor binding site 'hits' is represented by the bottom line. The genomic region analyzed by ChIP is
mapped below each regulogram. Red boxes represent exons, with the first box always being exon 1. Vertical bars with asterisks indicate locations of
conserved canonical E-boxes (5'-CACGTG-3'). Blue bars under each map represent fragments analyzed by ChIP. Ex, exon.

differential gene expression), from publication files kept by
the website organizer and suggestions from the website advisory board. Information on each putative target gene was
extracted from the publications using a worksheet that is also
provided, when possible, to the authors of the publications for
data verification. Information from the worksheets is entered
into an Excel spreadsheet database that is designed for direct
implementation as a searchable database on the website. For
recent publications with extensive microarray data, data
spreadsheets were requested from the authors and the gene
entries were transferred to the database directly. Each gene
entry was annotated according to the design of the Excel
spreadsheet database, which is available upon request for
non-profit uses. In some instances, authors have provided the
organizer with preprints of their publications. To ensure that
current and future publications on Myc target genes are
included, abstracts of publications on Myc found in PubMed
[12] are surveyed weekly by the website organizer and

colleagues. In addition, the website provides a means for
users to directly deposit unpublished data or to call attention
to recently published results.

Phylogenetic comparisons
Human and rodent genomic sequences are available from the
UCSC Genome Bioinformatics site [23] or TraFaC website
[24,18]. The sequences analyzed included two kilobases
upstream of the transcriptional start site through to the final
exon for each target gene. The transcriptional start site and
intron-exon boundaries were determined from the TraFaC
alignments (regulograms) or by direct comparison of mRNA
and genomic DNA. In order to find putative c-Myc-binding
sites, sequences were searched using the nucleic acid motifs
feature of the OMIGA software (Oxford Molecular Limited,
Oxford, UK). The search parameters were user defined as the
canonical (5'-CACGTG-3') or noncanonical (5'-CATGTG-3',
5'-CACGAG-3', 5'-CACGCG-3', 5'-CATGCG-3', 5'-CACGTTG-3')

information

For real-time PCR, a SYBR green core reagents kit (Applied
Biosystems) or the Failsafe Real-time PCR PreMix selection
kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) were utilized. Known quantities
of total input DNA were used to generate a standard curve for
determining the percentage of total input for each ChIP sample. All amplifications were carried out in the linear range of
standard curves.

interactions

The cell line used for all ChIP analyses was the human B-cell
line P493 carrying a conditional, tetracycline-regulated cmyc [16]. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. To
repress c-myc expression, cells were exposed to 0.1 µg/ml tetracycline (tet) for 72 hours. Both untreated and tet-treated
P493 cells were formaldehyde cross-linked and chromatin
was precipitated as described previously [25]. The rabbit polyclonal c-Myc and HGF antibodies (anti-Myc sc-764 and antiHGF sc-7949 [Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz,
CA]) were each used to precipitate chromatin from 2 × 107
cells.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

deposited research

First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg total RNA using
TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems,
Branchburg, NJ). PCR primers were designed to amplify fragments that span intron/exon boundaries in the human cDNA
sequences using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed in the linear range
using the SYBR Green Core Reagents kit on a 7700 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

reports

Twenty micrograms total protein from cell lysates of both
treated and untreated P493 cells were separated on a 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblots were probed with the
9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and anti-α-tubulin
(CP06, Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA).
