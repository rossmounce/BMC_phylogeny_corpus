Abstract
Background: Influenza A virus infects not only humans, but also other species including avian and
swine. If a novel influenza A subtype acquires the ability to spread between humans efficiently, it
could cause the next pandemic. Therefore it is necessary to understand the evolutionary processes
of influenza A viruses in various hosts in order to gain better knowledge about the emergence of
pandemic virus. The virus has segmented RNA genome and 7th segment, M gene, encodes 2
proteins. M1 is a matrix protein and M2 is a membrane protein. The M gene may be involved in
determining host tropism. Besides, novel vaccines targeting M1 or M2 protein to confer cross
subtype protection have been under development. We conducted the present study to investigate
the evolution of the M gene by analyzing its sequence in different species.
Results: Phylogenetic tree revealed host-specific lineages and evolution rates were different
among species. Selective pressure on M2 was stronger than that on M1. Selective pressure on M1
for human influenza was stronger than that for avian influenza, as well as M2. Site-by-site analyses
identified one site (amino acid position 219) in M1 as positively selected in human. Positions 115
and 121 in M1, at which consensus amino acids were different between human and avian, were
under negative selection in both hosts. As to M2, 10 sites were under positive selection in human.
Seven sites locate in extracellular domain. That might be due to host's immune pressure. One site
(position 27) positively selected in transmembrane domain is known to be associated with drug
resistance. And, two sites (positions 57 and 89) locate in cytoplasmic domain. The sites are involved
in several functions.
Conclusion: The M gene of influenza A virus has evolved independently, under different selective
pressure on M1 and M2 among different hosts. We found potentially important sites that may be
related to host tropism and immune responses. These sites may be important for evolutional
process in different hosts and host adaptation.

Background
The influenza virus is a common cause of respiratory
infection all over the world. The influenza A virus can
infect not only humans but also avian, swine, and equine

species. The virus has a negative single-stranded RNA with
eight gene segments, namely PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA,
M, and NS. The subtype of influenza A virus is determined
by the antigenicity of two surface glycoproteins, hemagluPage 1 of 13

tinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The subtypes currently circulating in the human population are H1N1 and
H3N2. Influenza A viruses cause epidemics and pandemics by antigenic drift and antigenic shift, respectively [1].
Antigenic drift is an accumulation of point mutations
leading minor and gradual antigenic changes. Antigenic
shift involves major antigenic changes by introduction of
new HA and/or NA subtype into human population.
All known HA and NA subtypes are maintained in avian
species, and all mammalian influenza A viruses are
thought to be derived from the avian influenza A virus
pool [1]. In avian species, influenza A viruses are in an
evolutionary stasis [1]. In contrast, all gene segments of
mammalian viruses continue to accumulate amino acid
substitutions [1]. Today, the emergence of an influenza
pandemic is of great global concern. If a novel influenza A
subtype acquires the ability to spread between humans
efficiently, it could cause the next pandemic [1]. This ability is acquired by reassortment between human and nonhuman influenza A viruses or by the accumulation of
mutations in the non-human influenza virus. It is necessary to understand the evolutionary processes of influenza
A viruses in various hosts so that we have better knowledge about the emergence of this pandemic virus. We conducted the present study to investigate the evolution of
the M gene among different species. Although there are
numerous studies on the evolution of the HA gene [2-7],
only a few studies on the evolution of the M gene have
been conducted [8].
The M gene is intriguing because it encodes both matrix
and membrane proteins, and has multiple functions. The
M gene (1027 bps) encodes two proteins, namely M1 (at
nucleotide position 26 to 784) and M2 (at nucleotide
position 26 to 51 and 740 to 1007) [9]. M1 is a matrix
protein that lies just beneath the viral envelope in the
form of dimers and interacts with viral ribonucleoprotein
(vRNP) complex, forming a bridge between the inner core
components and the membrane proteins [10-13]. vRNPs
harbor the determinants for host range [1,14,15]. M1 contacts with both viral RNA and NP, promoting the formation of RNP complexes and causing the dissociation of
RNP from the nuclear matrix [16-21]. M1 plays a vital role
in assembly by recruiting the viral components to the site
of assembly and essential role in the budding process
including formation of viral particles [22,23]. M2 is a
membrane protein which is inserted into the viral envelope and projects from the surface of the virus as tetramers
[24,25]. The M2 protein comprises 97 amino acids – 24 in
the extracellular domain, 19 in the transmembrane
domain, and 54 in the cytoplasmic domain. Extracellular
domain of M2 is recognized by hosts' immune system
[26-28]. Transmembrane domain of M2 has ion channel
activity, which involved in uncoating process of the virus

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/67

in cell [29]. Amantadine inhibits virus replication by
blocking the acid-activated ion channel. The cytoplasmic
domain of M2 interacts with M1 and is required for
genome packaging and formation of virus particles [3036].
The molecular mechanism of how the host range of influenza A viruses is determined is still not fully understood.
The M gene may be involved in determining host tropism.
Besides, novel vaccines targeting M1 or M2 proteins to
confer cross-subtype protection have been shown to be
promising [37-43]. Therefore, understanding of evolution
of the M gene is of great importance and practical relevance.

Results
Phylogenetic Tree
The phylogenetic trees for the M gene of all the sequence
data we analyzed are shown in Figure 1. We defined "lineage" as an aggregate of large branches. The phylogenetic
analysis revealed seven host-specific lineages: 1) human
lineage (Hu1) consisting of H1N1 between 1918 and
1954 (Spanish Flu and its progeny viruses), H2N2
between 1957 and 1967 (Asian Flu and its progeny
viruses), and H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu and its progeny
viruses) after 1968; 2) another human lineage (Hu2) consisting of H1N1 (Russian Flu) after 1977; 3) avian lineage
(Av1) including viruses mainly from Asia but also from
other regions; 4) another avian lineage (Av 2) including
viruses mostly from North America; 5) swine lineage
(Sw1), located between human and avian lineages,
mainly from North America; 6) another swine lineage
(Sw2) diverging from Av1 and consisting of swine viruses
after 1980, mainly from Europe; and 7) canine/equine
lineage (CE) diverging from the root of Av2.

The M gene of all known human influenza A viruses, i.e.,
H1N1 between 1918 and 1957, H2N2 between 1957 and
1968, H3N2 after 1968, and H1N1 after 1977 was derived
from that of the 1918 Spanish Flu. One lineage (Hu1)
included three different subtypes (H1N1 between 1918
and 1957, H2N2 between 1957 and 1968, and H3N2
after 1968), which means that the same M gene was maintained in human influenza even after two antigenic shifts
in 1957 and 1968. Another lineage (Hu2) included H1N1
after 1977. This M gene was also derived from Spanish
Flu, but underwent different evolutionary processes and
formed another lineage. Since H1N1 re-emerged in 1977
as Russian Flu, the two subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) have
been co-circulating in human populations and have
formed two distinct lineages (Hu1 and Hu2). However,
Hu2 exclusively includes H1N1 viruses and all human
H3N2 are included in Hu1 (Figure 1B). On the other
hand, both avian influenza lineages (Av1 and Av2) did
not show any subtype specificity, and included many dif-

ferent subtypes (Figure 1A and 1B). In avian lineages, even
small branches of the phylogenetic tree are shared by different subtypes.
Although strains with the M gene in both avian lineages
(Av1 and Av2) have been seen sporadically in humans,
they have not been maintained in the population (blue
characters in Av1 and Av2, Figure 1A and 1F). Strains with
the M gene in swine lineages also infect humans, but these
swine viruses have not been established in human populations (blue characters in Sw1 and Sw2, Figure 1A and
1F). All H5N1 viruses that infected humans as well as the
H5N1 virus that infected swine possessed share the M
gene of the avian influenza lineage (Av1, (Figure 1E).
Evolutionary Rate
For evolutionary rate analysis, we included the sequences
of only host-specific lineages and excluded other
sequences such as those of the H5N1 influenza in humans
(Figure 1F. See "Materials and methods"). The profile of
the sequences analyzed is shown in Table 1. Evolutionary
rates were estimated for each lineage (Figure 2).

Av2 of avian influenza A viruses showed the slowest evolutionary rate (1.63 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year).
All human and swine Influenza A viruses had a signifi-

cantly faster evolutionary rate than avian viruses (Table
2). In addition, evolutionary rates were significantly different even between lineages of same host. Hu2 has
evolved more rapidly than Hu1, and Sw2 has evolved
more rapidly than Sw1 (Figure 2 and Table 2).
Selective Pressures
The selective pressures for the entire sequence (we defined
the magnitude of the pressure as "ω") were 0.13 for the
entire coding region of the M gene, 0.06 for M1, and 0.45
for M2 (Figure 3). A higher selective pressure indicates
that the gene (or the site) is under stronger selection (positive selection) for amino acid substitution. Lower selective pressure indicates that the gene (or the site) is under
stronger negative selection to retain the same amino
acid(s) because changes may lead to incompetence or
abortion [44,45]. Selective pressure was statistically
stronger in M2 than that in M1 for all hosts.

ω of the entire coding region of the M gene for human and
swine influenza was significantly higher (no overlap of
95% confidence intervals) than that for the avian influenza (Figure 3). ω for both M1 and M2 of human influenza are also significantly larger than that for avian
influenza (Figure 3).

Figure 2
Evolutionary rate
Evolutionary rate. Number of nucleotide substitutions compared to the oldest strain in each lineage is plotted. Evolutionary
rates are calculated from the slope of the tangent of a simple regression line (number of substitutions/site/year), for canine/
equine (A), swine (B), avian (C), and human (D). Correlation coefficient (r) was estimated using the Pearson correlation. Reference strains are A/chicken/Brescia/1902(H7N7) for Av1, A/turkey/Massachusetts/3740/1965(H6N2) for Av2, A/equine/Miami/
1/1963(H3N8) for CE, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918(H1N1) for Hu1 and Hu2, A/swine/Iowa/15/1930(H1N1) for Sw1, and A/swine/
Netherlands/25/80(H1N1) for Sw2. Mean and 95% confidence interval (shown in parentheses) are calculated by SPSS.
Site-by-site Analyses
Site-by-site (by each codon) analyses for human influenza
were conducted by SLAC (the entire tree [eSLAC], internal
branches [iSLAC], and terminal branches [tSLAC]), and
FEL (the entire tree [eFEL] and internal branches [iFEL])
methods [45]. We conducted the analyses by testing
hypotheses for the entire tree, internal branches, and terminal branches (See "Materials and methods").

"dN/dS" indicates the magnitude of selective pressure on
each codon. When dN/dS on a certain codon is significantly greater than 1, the site is considered to be under significant positive selection. When dN/dS on a certain

codon is significantly smaller than 1, the site is considered
to be under significant negative selection. Figure 4 shows
P-values calculated by eSLAC and eFEL for each codon,
indicating negative or positive selection. eSLAC and eFEL
gave similar results. The sites under significant negative
selection for human influenza were found in 159 out of
252 codons (63.1%) in M1 and 26 out of 97 (26.8%) in
M2. Only one codon (0.4%) in M1 and eight codons
(8.2%) in M2 were under significant positive selection by
eFEL for human influenza. The sites under positive selection identified by at least one test are listed in Table 3. The
site in M1 under significant positive selection was position 219 (from here, "position" indicates the amino acid

located at the edge of the structure and is a part of a T-cell
and MHC cell epitope. Of ten sites positively selected in
M2, seven sites are in the extracellular domain (positions
11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 21, and 23), one site is in the transmembrane domain (position 27), and two sites in the
cytoplasmic domain (positions 57 and 89, Table 3).
To define the evolutionary difference for each codon in
human and avian influenza, we also calculated site-by-site
selective pressures for avian influenza by eFEL. Consensus

sequences of human and avian viruses were compared to
identify major differences between these two hosts. We
identified the sites at which consensus amino acids were
different between the human and avian viruses and
showed selective pressures (Figure 6 and Table 4). A summary of the site-by-site analyses including positive and
negative selection for human and avian influenza, and
differences in the consensus sequences are shown in Figure 7. Position 219 in M1, which is under significant positive selection in the human virus, is under significant
negative selection in the avian virus. Positions 115 and

Discussion
The phylogenetic tree showed that the M gene of influenza A viruses has evolved independently in each host. It
revealed host-specific lineages, which were compatible
with other reports. In previous reports, Av1, Av2, Sw1,
Sw2, and CE were named as Eurasian (Old World) avian,
North American (New World) avian, classic (old) swine,
European (avian-like) swine, and recent (avian-like)
canine lineages, respectively [1,8,46,47]. Since the emer-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/67

gence of the Russian Flu, both H1N1 and H3N2 have
been co-circulating in human populations and undergoing different evolutionary processes, which have resulted
in two distinct human influenza lineages, Hu1 and Hu2
(Figure 1A, B, and 1F). Although reassortment of human
influenza A viruses between the same subtype (intratypic
recombination) has occurred frequently [48-51], we
found only a few strains that seemed to be generated by
reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 human influenza, including H1N2 strains. These strains were not
maintained in human populations. When the H3N2 virus
with the M gene in Hu1 acquires the M gene from H1N1
in Hu2, such a virus might not replicate and/or transmit
effectively. On the other hand, M genes of avian influenza
are frequently shifted between subtypes as shown in Figure 1A and 1B. This suggests that reassortment between
subtypes (intertypic recombination) is common in avian
influenza. This result is compatible with the study by
Dugan et al., which showed a high rate of gene reassortment among avian influenza A viruses [52]. It is still
unclear why the M gene of avian influenza is interchangeable among subtypes, while the M gene of human influenza is not. Further experiments in vitro are necessary to
answer this question.
After Spanish Flu, the same M gene has been maintained
in human influenza, even after two pandemics (Asian Flu
and Hong Kong Flu) that were thought to have been generated by reassortment between avian and human influenza A viruses [1] (Figure 1A and 1C). In the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 1A), Spanish Flu is located at the root of a
human lineage and close to a swine lineage; there is a
greater distance between Spanish Flu and the avian influenza A viruses identified around 1918. This result supports the hypothesis that an ancestral virus of Spanish Flu
had entered the mammalian population before 1918
[53,54]. It remains to be seen whether this M gene will be
retained after further pandemics. It was shown that the M
gene of recent human influenza cannot incorporate the
HA segment of avian influenza in vitro [55].

There have been several sporadic infections with viruses
from non-human lineages to humans, including the
recent H5N1 infections in humans. However, these
viruses were not maintained, and therefore, they disappeared from the human population without efficient
transmission from human to human. In addition, it is
implied that swine can be a "mixing vessel" in which
human and avian viruses are reassorted to generate a
human pandemic strain [1,56]. However, infections of
strains with avian or human M genes in swine were also

rare, and most of these viruses were not maintained in the
swine population, except for the Sw2 lineage, in which
viruses with the avian lineage M gene became established
in the swine population.
Our phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses were clustered in host-specific lineages. This suggests that the M
gene may be host specific and viruses with an M gene from
other hosts are difficult to replicate. It is possible that the
M gene determines the host range through the interaction
between M1 and vRNPs [13,14,57]. An M gene that can
match with host-specific vRNPs may be needed to replicate and transmit in a certain host. In addition, many
studies have shown the interaction between M1 protein
and host proteins, such as RACK1, MAPK, and core histone [13,58-60]. The M gene may be directly and/or indirectly linked to host tropism of the virus.
The evolutionary rate of the M gene was low in avian
viruses compared to human and swine viruses (Figure 2
and Table 2). This result is rational because birds are considered to be a natural host for the influenza A virus [1].
The avian influenza A virus may have already been
adapted to the host and not subject to pressure to induce
further amino acid changes. This is also supported by the
result showing that ω of the M gene was the lowest in
avian influenza (Figure 3). Additional amino acid changes
might be required in mammalian hosts to allow the
viruses to adapt to these relatively new hosts. This stronger
selective pressure on human and swine influenza may
make human and swine influenza evolve more rapidly
than avian influenza (Figures 2 and 3).
Interestingly, evolutionary rates were significantly different between lineages of the same host (Table 2). The evo-

lutionary rates of Hu2 and Sw2 were faster than Hu1 and
Sw1, respectively. The evolution of the M gene might not
only be controlled by host species. One possible explanation is that strains in a lineage that appeared more recently
such as Hu2 or Sw2, have to evolve more rapidly in order
to be adapted better to the host than strains in other preexisting lineages (Hu1 or Sw1), which have already
adapted to some extent. Social factors at the time when
new lineages appeared such as the growth of the population and globalization may also facilitate a faster evolution. This may be the reason why the evolutionary rates of
Hu2 and Sw2 are higher than those of Hu1 and Sw1,
respectively (Figure 2). However, reason of difference
between evolutionary rates of Av1 and Av2 is unclear.
The selective pressure is stronger in M2 than in M1 (Figure
3) and more sites under positive selection were identified
in M2 than in M1 (Table 3 and Figure 7). Among them,
most of the sites (7 out of 10) under positive selection in
M2 are located in the extracellular domain (Table 3 and
Figure 7). Infection of influenza A virus induces the host's
immune response to M2, especially to the extracellular
domain [26-28]. It has been shown that antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain including the sites under
positive selection confer protective immunity [37-39].
The host's immune response may make stronger selective
pressure on M2 than that on M1. However, of course,
selective pressure is much higher in the HA segment, the
major antigenic component, than in the M2 gene [61],
and this M2 gene is thus more conserved than the HA
gene [42].
M1 is thought to play a vital role in the assembly and budding process [12,22,23]. Even minor mutations in M1
may cause a critical deficiency in virus replication. This
could also explain why M1 is under strong negative pressure and why the selective pressure on M1 is smaller than
that on M2 (Figure 3). Nevertheless, the selective pressure
on M1 of the human influenza was stronger than that of
the avian influenza (Figure 3). M1 of human influenza
should be under stronger selective pressure than that of
avian influenza to be better adapted.
Position 219 in M1 is under positive selection in human
influenza. It was also reported that this site was positively
selected using a different method of calculation [62].
However, this site is under negative selection in avian
influenza (Figure 7). M1 is recognized by cytotoxic T cells
[40,63,64] and the C-terminal of M1 determines antigenicity [65,66]. The site, located at the edge of structure
(Figure 5), is part of the T-cell and MHC epitope. M1 may
also be under selective pressure from the host's immune
response, although this is weaker than M2. Besides, the Cterminal of M1 is important for binding to vRNPs [16].
This site might play an important role in the interaction

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/67

with vRNPs, being associated with host range. Therefore,
it is under positive selection only in the human and not in
avian influenza virus.
Positions 115 and 121 in M1, which are under significant
negative selection in both human and avian influenza,
had different consensus amino acids between these two
hosts (Figure 7). These results indicate that these sites may
be important for host tropism and are therefore under
negative selection. In addition, position 137 also has different consensus amino acids between the hosts, though
this site is not under significant negative selection in
human influenza (the site is under negative selection in
avian influenza). The two domains in M1 have been
reported to affect the disposition of viral RNA. One
domain resides in a palindromic stretch of basic amino
acids (position 101 to 105) [17,18] and the other domain
is located at position 148 to 162 containing a zinc finger
motif [19,20]. The three sites (positions 115, 121, and
137) are located between these two domains. These sites
might affect the disposition of viral RNA and be involved
in the determination of host range.
Position 27, which is a site in the transmembrane
domain, is positively selected in M2. This site is associated
with amantadine resistance [67]. The selective pressure on
the site may be due to drug pressure. However, we could
not show any positive pressure on position 31, which is
associated with the recent spread of amantadine resistance
[68]. Details on drug pressure and possible mechanism
for recent surge of amantadine-resistant strains will be
described in another manuscript (in preparation).
The cytoplasmic domain of M2 is important for interaction with M1, genome packaging, and formation of virus
particles [33-36]. Two sites are under positive selection in
the cytoplasmic domain of M2 (positions 57 and 89,
Table 3). In particular, position 57 showed different consensus amino acids between human and avian influenza
(Figure 7). These results indicate that the amino acids in
these sites have frequently changed, and these sites are
likely to be involved in several functions of M2. The M2
cytoplasmic tail (position 45 to 69) has been shown to be
a binding domain for M1 [35]. Position 82 to 89 is important for infectious virus production [35]. Another study
showed that vRNP packaging is mediated by amino acids
at position 70 to 89 of the M2 gene [69]. The M2 gene
must, therefore, have evolved with several functions.
In conclusion, the M gene of the influenza A virus has
evolved with different selective pressures on M1 and M2
among different hosts. We found potentially important
sites that may be related to host tropism and immune
responses. These sites may be important for evolutionary
processes in different hosts and host adaptation. How-

ever, Dunham et al. concluded that it is difficult to predict
what specific genetic changes are needed for mammalian
adaptation by comparing evolution of avian and swine
influenza A viruses [47]. Further studies to clarify the specific role of each site identified in the present study are
needed.

Methods
Sequence Data
All data were obtained from the influenza sequence database
(Influenza
Virus
Resource
on:
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html,
accessed on July 21, 2008) [70]. All sequencing data for
the strains with a full-length M gene of any subtypes of
influenza A from different host species including avian,
canine, equine, human, and swine were included.
Sequences derived from laboratory strains and duplicate
strains verified by the strain name were excluded. A total
of 5489 sequences were obtained [accession numbers are
listed in additional file 1]. After excluding sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides, minor insertions, minor
deletions (data for full length of coding region were used)
or premature termination codons, a total of 5060
sequences were used in the analysis. Sequencing data were
obtained together with information of the host, subtype,
isolation year, and isolation place. The sequencing numbers for the influenza of each host are listed in Table 1. A
multiple alignment of the nucleotide sequences, which
did not contain any gaps, was constructed using ClustalW.
Phylogenetic Tree Analysis
A phylogenetic tree was inferred by RAxML [71]. The
sequences data only for the coding region were used; i.e.,
at nucleotide position 26 to 1007. The basic sequential
algorithm of RAxML is described elsewhere [72]. RAxML
is one of the fastest and most accurate sequential phylogeny programs [73]. In this method, a rapid bootstrap
search is combined with a rapid maximum likelihood
search on the original alignment. The tree was constructed
using Web-servers, RAxML BlackBox: "http://phy
lobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/" [71]. The tree is colorcoded according to hosts, subtypes, geographical information, or temporal information using FigTree (ver.1.1.2).
Dataset of Influenza for Each Host
Datasets for each host (avian, canine/equine, human, and
swine hosts) were constructed. Sequences only from the
host-specific lineage in the phylogenetic tree were used.
For example, the H5N1 influenza A viruses that had
infected humans were excluded from the analyses because
humans were accidental hosts infected with the viruses of
an avian lineage. Identical nucleotide sequences in the
same dataset were removed before further analyses.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/67

The number of base substitutions per site from an average
of all sequence pairs was calculated to define the diversity
of sequences in each dataset (Table 1) using the maximum
composite likelihood method in MEGA (ver. 4) [74].
Evolutionary Rate
The evolutionary rate of each lineage was calculated. To
calculate the rate, at least one sequence of each subtype in
each year was selected from each dataset. Evolutionary
rate was analyzed for the selected sequences as the
number of substitutions per site per year compared to the
oldest strain in each lineage with a linear regression
model. The significance of the correlations was estimated
using the Pearson correlation. Differential between slopes
of the tangent of simple regression lines were tested by
analysis of covariance. The analyses were conducted using
SPSS (ver.17).
Consensus Sequence
Consensus amino acid sequences were determined as the
sequence of amino acids that were identified most frequently at each position in a dataset, for human and avian
influenza. Amino acid substitutions that were identified
in more than 10% of the strains were regarded as major
variants.
Evaluation of Pressure (ω)
Phylogenetic trees for each dataset by hosts were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method implemented in PhyML-aLRT [75] with the GTR model (four
rate categories, all parameters estimated from the data).

Selective pressure for each host population was calculated
using the trees. Selective pressure was analyzed by HyPhy
[76]. All analyses in HyPhy were conducted after identifying the best fit model from every possible time-reversible
model (e.g., F81 and HKY85) according to Akaike's information criterion [45,77].
Global estimates (ω) of relative rates of non-synonymous
(dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions averaged over
the entire alignment were compared to calculate the overall strength of selection [45].
Site-by-site Selective Pressure (dN/dS)
Positive selection sites for human influenza were detected
using two methods: single likelihood ancestor counting
(SLAC) and fixed-effects likelihood (FEL). FEL was also
conducted for avian influenza. The relative rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions were compared. Sites where dN/dS > 1 and dN/dS < 1 were inferred
as positively and negatively selected, respectively. The
details of the two methods is described elsewhere
[45,78,79]. It was shown that many recent non-synonymous substitutions, i.e., those in the terminal branches of

Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

Virology Journal 2009, 6:67

the tree, were not represented on internal branches [80].
At codons where internal substitutions are seen, the
strength of selection along the terminal branches is high.
Analyses were conducted exclusively by testing hypotheses for the entire tree, internal branches, and terminal
branches.
Briefly, in the SLAC method, the nucleotide and codon
model parameter estimates are used to reconstruct the
ancestral codon sequences at the internal nodes of the
tree. The single most likely ancestral sequences are then
fixed as known variables, and applied to infer the expected
number of non-synonymous or synonymous substitutions that have occurred along each branch, for each
codon position. SLAC is a substantially modified and
improved derivative of the Suzuki-Gojobori method [44].
The FEL method is based on maximum-likelihood estimates. The FEL method estimates the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions on a site-by-site basis
for the entire tree (eFEL) or only the interior branches
(iFEL). iFEL is essentially the same as eFEL, except that
selection is only tested along the internal branches of the
phylogeny [80].
Uniprot ("http://www.uniprot.org/") and BioHealthBase
("http://www.biohealthbase.org/GSearch/home.do?dec
orator=influenza") were used to generate 3D crystal structures and to determine the location of epitope sites. Accession numbers: [GeneBank protein GI 89779323, strain A/
Puerto Rico/8/34, PDB ID 1AA7, GeneBank sequence
accession CY009445].
In the present study, we used a newly developed softwares
RAxML [71] and HyPhy [76] for phylogenetic analyses.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and PhyML are
widely used and are considered useful for manipulating
data sets (hundreds) [2,81-84]. However, they cannot
process huge data sets in order of thousands on an ordinary desktop computer. Therefore, we used a PC with
Windows operating system and 3 GB RAM). PAML, which
is a common software package for phylogenetic analyses
such as the calculation of selective pressure using maximum likelihood [85], also failed occasionaly in analyzing
large data sets. We therefore used the recently developed
software, which overcomes these problems. The accuracy
of this software has been confirmed [73,79,86]. Through
site-by-site analyses, we identified more sites negatively or
positively selected than those in a study by Suzuki [61].
This was ascribed to a difference in the number of data sets
and/or algorithms, as we analyzed ten times more than
the number analyzed in his study.
