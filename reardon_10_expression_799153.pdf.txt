Abstract
Background: Some organisms can survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of suspended animation known
as anhydrobiosis. The free-living mycophagous nematode Aphelenchus avenae can be induced to enter
anhydrobiosis by pre-exposure to moderate reductions in relative humidity (RH) prior to extreme desiccation. This
preconditioning phase is thought to allow modification of the transcriptome by activation of genes required for
desiccation tolerance.
Results: To identify such genes, a panel of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) enriched for sequences upregulated in
A. avenae during preconditioning was created. A subset of 30 genes with significant matches in databases,
together with a number of apparently novel sequences, were chosen for further study. Several of the recognisable
genes are associated with water stress, encoding, for example, two new hydrophilic proteins related to the late
embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein family. Expression studies confirmed EST panel members to be upregulated
by evaporative water loss, and the majority of genes was also induced by osmotic stress and cold, but rather fewer
by heat. We attempted to use RNA interference (RNAi) to demonstrate the importance of this gene set for
anhydrobiosis, but found A. avenae to be recalcitrant with the techniques used. Instead, therefore, we developed a
cross-species RNAi procedure using A. avenae sequences in another anhydrobiotic nematode, Panagrolaimus
superbus, which is amenable to gene silencing. Of 20 A. avenae ESTs screened, a significant reduction in survival of
desiccation in treated P. superbus populations was observed with two sequences, one of which was novel, while
the other encoded a glutathione peroxidase. To confirm a role for glutathione peroxidases in anhydrobiosis, RNAi
with cognate sequences from P. superbus was performed and was also shown to reduce desiccation tolerance in
this species.
Conclusions: This study has identified and characterised the expression profiles of members of the anhydrobiotic
gene set in A. avenae. It also demonstrates the potential of RNAi for the analysis of anhydrobiosis and provides the
first genetic data to underline the importance of effective antioxidant systems in metazoan desiccation tolerance.

Background
Water is essential for life, but some organisms have the
ability to survive extreme desiccation by entering a state
of suspended animation in a process known as anhydrobiosis ("life without water”) [1]. In the dry state, metabolism and life processes come to a halt. Anhydrobiotic
organisms are capable of surviving in this state for an
indefinite period of time after which, when environmental conditions become favourable, the organism can
resume normal metabolic activity [2,3]. These organisms
are widespread throughout nature and include yeasts,
bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, plants and nematodes. For
example, the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum can recover from loss of most of its cellular fluid
within 24 h of contact with water [4,5]. Many nematode
species are also able to enter anhydrobiosis, for example,
Aphelenchus avenae and Panagrolaimus superbus [6,7].
Some steinernemitid species also exhibit partial desiccation tolerance [8,9].
Anhydrobiosis is often associated with the accumulation of disaccharides and other oligosaccharides, chiefly
trehalose in animals and yeasts, and sucrose in plants
[1,4,10]. These sugars have been suggested to play a role
in protecting membranes and proteins by replacing
structural water or by forming a stabilising intracellular
glass that would inhibit membrane fusion and protein
denaturation; they might also be involved in maintaining
membrane fluidity [11,12]. However, it has been shown
in A. avenae, one of the best-characterised anhydrobiotic nematodes, that while it accumulates trehalose prior
to anhydrobiosis, probably at least partly due to upregulation of trehalose synthase genes [13], this alone is not
sufficient [14]. In other desiccation-tolerant invertebrates, such as bdelloid rotifers [15-17] and some tardigrades [18], disaccharide accumulation is not detectable.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose biosynthesis can be abolished by mutation while retaining
50-100% capacity to survive desiccation, depending on
the strain [19]. This suggests that while trehalose might
play a role in anhydrobiosis, at least in some species,
there must be other important biological processes
involved [20]. These processes might include changes in
primary metabolism; alterations to cell membranes; the
accumulation of compatible solutes and hydrophilic proteins; and activation of antioxidant and molecular chaperone systems.
One group of proteins receiving increasing attention is
the LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins. These
were first associated with desiccation tolerance in plant
seeds and resurrection plants (reviewed in [21]), but
recently homologues of Group 3 LEA proteins have
been linked to anhydrobiosis in certain nematodes
[22-25] and other invertebrates [17,26-29]. Group 3 LEA

proteins are characterized by extreme hydrophilicity and
11-amino acid periodicity; they have relatively little secondary structure in the hydrated state, but can become
more structured on drying [21,30]. A nematode Group
3 LEA protein from A. avenae, AavLEA1, has been
shown to function as a protein anti-aggregant both in
vitro and in vivo [31,32]. It has therefore been postulated that many LEA proteins possess a molecular shield
activity whereby they reduce inappropriate interactions
between other proteins by an electrosteric mechanism
[31,33]. LEA proteins also exhibit other activities consistent with a role in protection of cells against abiotic
stress, including membrane protection, ion binding,
antioxidant functions, hydration buffering and nucleic
acid binding (references in [21] and [34]).
In this study we have constructed an EST (expressed
sequence tag) library of genes upregulated on desiccation in the free-living mycophagous nematode A. avenae
and have investigated their expression profiles under
various stress conditions. We have identified a new LEA
protein gene, as well as other stress response genes, and
have used a cross-species gene silencing approach to
assess the importance of a subset of the EST panel for
anhydrobiosis. Our findings indicate that glutathione
peroxidases represent a key class of enzymes required
for desiccation tolerance in the nematodes tested and
emphasise the need for redox balancing in
anhydrobiosis.

Results
An EST dataset from A. avenae enriched for dehydrationinduced sequences

A 5’ oligo capping method was used to construct an
EST library of genes enriched in those upregulated on
drying in A. avenae: an initial screen of 984 clones by
reverse Northern dot blots, using cDNA from both
dried and control nematodes in parallel experiments,
yielded 88 ESTs which appeared to be induced by desiccation. From these, a subset of 30 ESTs showing significant BLAST matches to sequences from other
organisms, and 12 ESTs representing apparently novel
sequences, were selected for further study (Table 1).
The ESTs include a novel homologue of known Group
3 LEA protein genes: this cDNA sequence (accession
number EF026241) is full length, as indicated by the
presence of a spliced leader sequence (SL1c) at its 5’
end and a polyA tail at the 3’ end. The cDNA is 405 bp
long, excluding the polyA tail, and its longest open reading frame predicts a protein of 85 amino acids with Mr
9990 and pI 6.4. The closest BLASTX match is with
lea-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans and, although the
BLAST score is not highly significant (0.001), other features of the predicted protein sequence identify it as a

Group 3 LEA protein. For example, the predicted protein sequence has a section of K11 periodicity, with two
interlaced runs of three lysines at residues 38, 40, 49,
51, 60 and 62; POPP analysis [35] places it cleanly
within the Group 3 LEA protein cluster; it lacks cysteine
and tryptophan residues; it is hydrophilic along its entire
length according to a hydropathy plot based on the
Eisenberg Consensus scale, with a grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) score of -1.83 indicating extreme hydrophilicity (the average score for Group 3 LEA proteins is
-0.97; [36]). Predictors of protein disorder suggest the
protein is natively unfolded: the VL-XT algorithm at

pondr.com indicates 95% disorder, while Foldindex and
IUPred both return predictions of 100% disorder; and a
Uversky plot of mean net charge against mean scaled
hydropathy places the protein firmly among the set of
intrinsically disordered proteins (Figure 1). All the above
properties are consistent with this example being a new
Group 3 LEA protein and therefore we designate it AavLEA2 (as the second such protein from A. avenae after
AavLEA1; [24]) and its gene Aav-lea-2.
A second example from the EST dataset, EF026240,
also encodes a hydrophilic protein but it is less clearly
identifiable as an LEA protein. The cDNA is again full

protein structure. Predicted protein sequences corresponding to AavLEA2 (EF026241) and LEA-like protein (EF026240) were analysed at http://
www.pondr.com. The positions of test sequences are shown by a green diamond and a yellow triangle, respectively, in comparison to a set of
disordered proteins (red circles) and a set of ordered proteins (blue squares). The boundary line shown between unfolded and folded space is

length, with spliced leader (SL1a) and polyA tail, whose
464 bp insert encodes a protein of 102 amino acids in
its longest open reading frame, with Mr 11656 and pI
6.53. The protein has a GRAVY score of -1.38, and a
hydropathy plot shows it to be hydrophilic along almost
its entire length. Disorder prediction algorithms are consistent with it being unfolded - VL-XT, Foldindex and
IUPred predict 78%, 100% and 100% disorder respectively - and the Uversky plot positions the protein
within natively unfolded space (Figure 1). POPP analysis
shows clustering with Group 2 and Group 3 LEA proteins, but only at the level of band 3, indicating that this
association is rather weak. Furthermore, there is no K11,
and limited A11, periodicity and the predicted protein
sequence includes one cysteine and one tryptophan,
which it is unusual to find in Group 3 LEA proteins. A
BLASTX run against the C. elegans genome returns lea1 as the top hit, although the score is weak (0.002); a
BLAST enquiry against the whole sequence collection
returns as best hit (0.029) an LEA-like sequence from
the Antarctic bacterium Polaromonas sp. JS666. Intriguingly, though, using BLAST to compare the EF026240
protein against AavLEA2, described above, gives a score
of 5E-14, indicating a match of respectable significance.
When aligned, the two predicted protein sequences are
given as 34.3% identical with the ALIGN algorithm. In
summary, the bioinformatics are consistent with this
example being a hydrophilic, intrinsically disordered
protein which probably has a distant evolutionary relationship to the Group 3 LEA proteins. For the moment,
therefore, we consider it to be an LEA-like hypothetical
protein.

While the presence of LEA and LEA-like protein gene
sequences among the dehydration-induced EST dataset
is in line with a presumed role for these polypeptides in
the response to water stress, several other genes associated with stress responses were also found. For example, genes encoding: myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase
which controls synthesis of an osmolyte, myo-inositol,
implicated in desiccation tolerance [37,38]; AHA-1, a
stress-regulated activator of the ATPase activity of molecular chaperone Hsp90 [39]; and glutathione peroxidase,
which catalyses the reduction of hydroxyperoxides by
glutathione and is important in the response to oxidative stress (reviewed in [40]).
The control of the response to desiccation is very
poorly understood and therefore it is of interest that a
number of genes involved in signal transduction and the
regulation of gene activity were recovered from the
screen. For example, three zinc finger protein genes
were identified (Table 1), encoding a C2H2 zinc finger
family member (GR463901), a GATA-type zinc finger
(GR463910), and a RING finger domain protein
(DR121009). The latter is most likely involved in the
regulation of protein activity, rather than gene regulation directly; it gives a best BLAST hit with mnat-1, a
C. elegans gene whose protein is probably involved in
the ubiquitination pathway as an E3-type ubiquitin
ligase. It is also implicated in stabilising the CDK-activating kinase intrinsic to cell cycle progression through
its MAT1 domain and is functionally associated with
TFII, the transcription/DNA repair factor (http://www.
wormbase.org; [41]). The zinc finger proteins represented by GR463901 and GR463910 would merit further

investigation as candidate anhydrobiotic gene set regulators: several transcription factors were found to be upregulated by water loss in Steinernema feltiae [8], S.
carpocapsae [9] and Plectus murrayi [25], and a GATAtype transcription factor (ELT-2) has been found to regulate C. elegans transcription during the innate immune
response and osmotic stress [42]; in plants, many gene
regulators have been characterised in the response to
drought (e.g. reviewed in [43]). Another gene, represented by GR463906, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase able to hydrolyse phosphate from Tyr and Ser/
Thr residues; such phosphatases are key players in signal
transduction, for example, in MAPK pathways, and in
cell cycle regulation [44]. DR121003 encodes a homologue of C. elegans UNC-16 which is primarily involved in
vesicle transport, but whose protein is also known to
interact with the MAPK, JNK, and also with JNK
kinases; it thus functionally intersects with signal transduction pathways. Further investigation of these genes
could therefore lead to improved understanding of the
dehydration stress response in nematodes.
Twelve of the selected ESTs encode novel proteins
that have no matches in the GenBank or WormPep
databases (Table 2). Six of these are predicted to be
unusually hydrophilic (hydropathy scores <-0.43, the
GRAVY score of bovine serum albumin) or largely disordered (>50%) or both, and all are predicted to be
charged at physiological pH. (The pHi of resting intestinal cells of C. elegans has been determined to be 7.53;
[45].) Although they are clearly not LEA proteins, these
novel proteins are reminiscent of anhydrin, another
highly hydrophilic, disordered protein previously

described in A. avenae, whose gene expression is
induced by drying [24]. The prevalence of such proteins,
albeit from a very limited sample, is intriguing and
invites further investigation in the context of desiccation
tolerance.
Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in A. avenae

Homologues of two polygalacturonase genes in the fungi
Aspergillus awamori and Penicillium griseoroseum
[46,47] were found in the A. avenae EST set. These
genes seem to be derived from the A. avenae genome
and are not a result of fungal contamination since preliminary Southern hybridisation experiments show they
are not present in Rhizoctonia solani, the food source
used (data not shown). Polygalacturonases (EC:3.2.1.15)
hydrolyse 1,4-alpha-D-galactosiduronic linkages in pectin, a major component of the cell walls of plants [48].
Plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi secrete hydrolytic
enzymes such as polygalacturonases and cellulases to
degrade plant cell walls. Plant parasitic nematodes also
secrete a great diversity of plant cell-wall degrading
enzymes including cellulases and galacturonases. Phylogenetic analyses support the interpretation that the cellulases and polygalacturonases present in cyst and rootknot nematodes have been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer from bacteria [49-53]. In contrast, the polygalacturonase genes of A. avenae appear to be derived by
horizontal transfer from fungi (Additional File 1; Table
1). Interestingly a polygalacturonase gene found in the
genome of the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae also appears
to have been incorporated into the genome of this insect
by horizontal gene transfer from a fungal source [54].
While the cellulase and polygalacturonase genes of the

root-knot nematode M. incognita are most closely
related to bacterial sequences, genome-wide analysis
indicates that three other plant-cell wall degrading/modifying enzymes in this nematode (pectate lyase, arabinase
and expansin) may be of fungal origin [52], and it has
also been shown that the cellulases of the pine wood
nematode are most similar to cellulases from fungi [55].
A. avenae is routinely cultured in the laboratory on
fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani or Botrytus cinerea, but
A. avenae is also capable of growing and reproducing in
vitro on tissue cultures prepared from several plant species [56] and it has also been shown that A. avenae will
feed and multiply on plant roots, and suppress growth
[57]. The occurrence of a plant cell wall degrading
enzyme in A. avenae provides further evidence that in
addition to feeding on fungi A. avenae might also utilise
plant tissues as a food source in nature.

Multiple variant spliced leaders in A. avenae mRNAs

Spliced leaders derive from specific snRNAs and are
coupled to pre-mRNAs through a trans-splicing
mechanism during mRNA maturation [58,59]. Previously, 22-nucleotide spliced leader sequences representing four variants of the SL1 sequence characterised
in C. elegans have been described at the 5’ ends of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (tps) mRNAs in A. avenae
[13]. All four of these SL1 sequences were found in the
ESTs described here, together with eight additional variants (Table 3). Uncovering a total of 12 different
sequences from a relatively small sample of mRNA
sequences suggests a degree of spliced leader polymorphism in A. avenae similar to that reported for Trichinella spiralis [60]. Interestingly, four variants (5, 6, 7
and 8) show striking similarity to SL2, the second main
form of spliced leader found in C. elegans, which is
associated with the resolution of polycistronic premRNAs resulting from operon transcription. SL2 is postulated to have first evolved in the rhabditine lineage
which includes C. elegans [59], but the data of Table 3
suggest that this family of spliced leaders is also present
in the Tylenchina, which includes A. avenae, and therefore must have arisen no later than the common ancestor of the two sister groups within Nematoda. It will be
interesting therefore to investigate whether SL2-like
trans-splicing is used for processing of operon transcripts in A. avenae, like C. elegans, instead of SL1, as
found in all other nematodes to date outside the Rhabditina [59].
Regulation of gene expression after exposure to
environmental stress

The expression of 42 A. avenae genes in response to
evaporative water loss (90% RH, 24 h), increased osmotic potential (1 M sucrose, 24 h), cold (4°C, 24 h) and
heat (32°C, 24 h) was evaluated by quantitative PCR
(Table 1; Table 2). Two thirds of the recognisable genes

GGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG

SL1a to SL1d are described in ref. [13]. The two canonical spliced leader
sequences from C. elegans are listed for comparison. In cases where A. avenae
ESTs are not listed, the respective cDNAs are incomplete at the 5’ end and
cannot be assessed for spliced leader use.

were found to be upregulated by drying, thus validating
the selection procedure and implicating the EST set in
anhydrobiosis. Interestingly, the large majority of genes
analysed were also responsive to osmotic stress and cold
(83% and 77%, respectively), probably reflecting similar
effects on water activity and overlapping stress
responses to all three environmental conditions. In contrast, heat stress caused relatively few genes to be
induced, with 30% responding to elevated temperature,
implicating a rather different response mechanism.
The degree of expression varied widely between genes
although ANOVA analysis showed that, in most cases, a
1.5-fold increase in expression levels was significant
(Table 1). Nevertheless, some genes were highly upregulated: the LEA protein and LEA-like genes (EF026241
and EF026240) showed a 43-fold and 36-fold increase in
expression level, respectively, in response to desiccation,
and a response to osmotic stress in excess of 20-fold.
These genes were also substantially upregulated on
exposure to low temperature (8-fold and 47-fold respectively). Other genes were not induced to the same levels
in most cases, but notable results include that of a glutathione peroxidase (GR463914) whose mRNA concentration increased 32- and 14-fold in response to
desiccation and osmotic stress, respectively; a DJ-1-like
gene (GR463903) showed a 10-fold induction on desiccation; and an AHA1 activator gene (GR463897) also
showed high relative expression levels following

Reardon et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/6

exposure to desiccation and osmotic stress. The above
results are consistent with a requirement for increased
antioxidant and molecular shield/chaperone activity during water stress, as has been noted previously (e.g. [4]).
Of the novel genes (Table 2), four showed more than
10-fold upregulation on osmotic stress and two displayed over five-fold induction in response to
desiccation.
A. avenae is recalcitrant to RNA interference

Although the selective cloning procedure and the
expression data of Tables 1 and 2 implicate the large
majority of the gene set in anhydrobiosis, it would be
desirable to obtain more direct evidence that they are
required for survival of the dry state. To this end, we
sought to establish RNA interference (RNAi) in A. avenae as a tool to selectively eliminate or reduce gene
activity. Populations of A. avenae in which expression of
particular genes had been reduced by gene silencing
could then be assessed for desiccation tolerance; where
survival was compromised, the respective genes would
be strongly implicated in anhydrobiosis. RNAi occurs in
C. elegans after injection of double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) corresponding to the target gene into worms
[61], after soaking nematodes in a dsRNA solution [62]
or after feeding nematodes on bacteria expressing
dsRNA [63]. The last of these methods is not available
to us since A. avenae do not feed on bacteria. Therefore,
attempts were made at injecting dsRNA into A. avenae
but these were unsuccessful due to technical difficulties
relating to the small size of the worms. The injection
method is also laborious and is not amenable to studies
at the population level, which is usually required for
assessment of desiccation tolerance. A soaking method
was therefore attempted using dsRNA corresponding to
the RNA polymerase II large (a) subunit gene, ama-1,
which is known to give a lethal phenotype when
silenced in C. elegans and other nematodes such as the
human parasitic species Brugia malayi [64]. Two cDNA
sequences corresponding to the A. avenae ama-1 transcript were cloned using primers directed against conserved peptide sequences identified in an alignment of
nematode and other RNA polymerase II large subunit
genes [65]. Soaking of A. avenae for 24 h in 1 mg/ml
ama-1 dsRNA did not, however, show a phenotype
compared to negative control experiments (data not
shown). Positive technical controls were performed
using C. elegans and cognate ama-1 sequences, resulting
in sick animals within 24 h. Further controls were also
carried out using unc-22 and GFP dsRNA on wild-type
and GFP-expressing C. elegans (PD4251) to confirm the
effectiveness of RNAi.
To determine whether dsRNA molecules were taken
up by A. avenae, nematodes were soaked in fluorescently-labeled dsRNA (GFP sequence) for a period of

Page 7 of 18

approximately 24 h. Wild type C. elegans was used as a
positive control. Fluorescence was observed in the gut
of C. elegans by confocal microscopy but no signal was
observed in A. avenae, suggesting that dsRNA is not
ingested efficiently in this species (Figure 2). Addition of
the neuromodulator, octopamine, at concentrations up
to 50 mM, which has been reported to improve dsRNA
uptake in some parasitic nematodes [66,67], did not stimulate ingestion in A. avenae. Therefore, perhaps due
to its feeding mechanism which involves stylet puncture
of target fungal or plant tissues [68], it is likely that A.
avenae is not readily amenable to RNAi by the soaking
method.
Cross-species RNAi of anhydrobiosis genes

One strategy which might partially circumvent difficulties with RNAi in A. avenae is cross-species gene silencing using A. avenae sequences to reduce expression of
homologous transcripts in another anhydrobiotic nematode. Cross-species RNAi has been shown using
sequences from the animal parasitic nematode, Ascaris
suum, in C. elegans, for example [69]. Recent work by
one of our groups (AMB) has demonstrated efficient
systemic RNAi in Panagrolaimus superbus, a nematode
in the same phylogenetic group as A. avenae with a
marked resistance to desiccation. Indeed, since P.
superbus is a bacterivore, it is susceptible to large scale
RNAi in nematode populations using a feeding method
very similar to that used routinely in C. elegans [70].
From the A. avenae EST set, 20 candidates (indicated
in bold in Tables 1 and 2) were selected for RNAi in P
superbus. The majority of these were chosen because
they showed a high degree of similarity to sequences in
C. elegans and/or Caenorhabditis briggsae, the rationale
being that they were then more likely to have similar
counterparts in P. superbus: both P. superbus and A.
avenae are tylenchid nematodes, and thus more closely
related in evolutionary terms than either is to the genus
Caenorhabditis [70]. For comparison, three of the 20
ESTs chosen were novel sequences (GR463919,
GR463921, GR463927).
P. superbus were fed bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to individual A. avenae sequences, after which
worms were first pre-conditioned at 90% RH for 24 h
followed by 24 h desiccation at 10% RH. The worms
were then rehydrated overnight in buffer before scoring
for survival. Worms fed dsRNA corresponding to GFP
and treated similarly were taken as negative controls.
Prior to desiccation, nematodes were also subjected to
phenotypic analysis, but none of the experiments performed revealed any extraordinary change in morphology or behaviour, either of adults, larvae or embryos
(Additional File 2).
This first drying experiment was used as a preliminary
screen; four candidates which showed a reduction in

desiccation tolerance of at least 10% compared to controls
were chosen for a second round of RNAi and desiccation:
GR463899 (ggr-3, a predicted member of the GABA family
of ligand-gated chloride channels); GR463913 (col-14, a
collagen structural gene); GR463914 (a glutathione peroxidase); and GR463921 (unknown function). Survival of P.
superbus after RNAi treatment and desiccation was compared to nematode viability after mock desiccation, in
which worms were subjected to 100% RH; as previously, a
GFP negative control was also performed (Figure 3). In
this experiment, RNAi treatment with both GR463899

and GR463913 resulted in no significant reduction in survival following desiccation compared to non-dried and
GFP controls. Therefore, neither was considered to have a
measurable RNAi effect. However, GR463914 and
GR463921 did show significant (P < 0.01) reduction in
survival of drying after RNAi to 66% and 59%, compared
to 84% and 75%, respectively, without desiccation. These
results therefore suggest that glutathione peroxidase and
an additional uncharacterised gene (GR463921) are contributors to desiccation tolerance in P. superbus, and by
extension in A. avenae.

identified in a preliminary screen. GFP was taken as a negative control for RNAi. The resulting mixed stage worms were subjected to desiccation

(white bars). Mean values of triplicates, together with standard deviations, are shown; a one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was
performed on GR463914 and GR463921: *, significance at P < 0.05; **, significance at P < 0.01; ***, significance at P < 0.001; ns, not significant.

Glutathione peroxidase gene activity contributes to
anhydrobiosis in P. superbus

If the cross-species strategy used above is valid, then
genes that are upregulated in response to desiccation in
A. avenae, and that have well-conserved sequence counterparts in P. superbus, should be part of an anhydrobiotic gene set in both nematodes. Therefore, we attempted
to identify genes in P. superbus which were homologues
or paralogues of the two genes indicated by the crossspecies RNAi experiments, in order to carry out similar
experiments with cognate P. superbus sequences. Consequently, an EST library of ~9,000 P. superbus cDNAs
(Tyson et al., in preparation) was searched for sequences
corresponding to A. avenae GR463914 and GR463921.
Although no matches were found for the novel sequence
represented by GR463921, two different sequences
showing similarity to GR463914 were obtained, Ps92
(accession number GR881192) and Ps114 (accession
number GR881191), both of which are similar to glutathione peroxidase sequences in GenBank and other
databases. For example, both Ps92 and Ps114 gave
highly significant matches with the C. elegans glutathione peroxidase gene C11E4.1, showing BLASTX
scores of 2E-97 and 1E-86, respectively. The ESTs probably represent different genes in P. superbus since they
are only 66% identical using the ALIGN tool.
RNAi experiments were therefore carried out in P.
superbus with these sequences, together with A. avenae
GR463914 (glutathione peroxidase) and GFP sequences

as positive and negative controls, respectively. Figure 4
confirms that RNAi using the A. avenae glutathione peroxidase sequence reduces desiccation tolerance in P.
superbus. Moreover, the two glutathione peroxidase
sequences from the P. superbus EST library also showed
a pronounced RNAi effect on survival after drying.
These results strongly implicate a role for glutathione
peroxidases in nematode anhydrobiosis and provide the
first genetic evidence for the importance of antioxidants
in metazoan desiccation tolerance.

Discussion
Anhydrobiosis is one of the most fascinating biological
phenomena, yet the molecular mechanisms involved are
still relatively poorly understood. The application of
recently-developed molecular techniques to the study of
anhydrobiosis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable desiccation-tolerant model organism, certainly
among the metazoans, for which genome sequence and
genetic tools are not yet available. Perhaps the bestcharacterised metazoan example is the nematode, A.
avenae, in which the physiology and biochemistry of
anhydrobiosis has been studied since the 1970s (e.g. [6]).
To gain insight into the set of genes employed by A.
avenae to achieve the anhydrobiotic state, which can be
termed the anhydrobiotic gene set, or the desiccome
[71], we have used a selective cloning technique to identify genes that are upregulated by evaporative water loss.
The majority of genes identified were confirmed as

Figure 4 RNAi of cognate glutathione peroxidase transcripts in P. superbus reduces desiccation tolerance. Feeding of P. superbus with
bacteria expressing dsRNA corresponding to A. avenae glutathione peroxidase sequence, GR463914, and P. superbus glutathione peroxidase
sequences, GR881191 and GR881192, followed by assessment of desiccation tolerance. A bacterial feeder strain expressing dsRNA corresponding
to GFP was used as a negative control. Mixed stage worms were subjected to desiccation at 10% RH for 24 h (negative control - black bar; other
samples - grey bars). All samples were also subjected to mock desiccation at 100% RH (white bars). Mean values of triplicates, together with
standard deviations, are shown; a one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was performed: *, significance at P < 0.05; **, significance at P <

desiccation-inducible using real-time qPCR, thus validating the cloning procedure; many examples of this gene
set were also found to be responsive to osmotic stress
and reduced temperature, possibly due to a common
effect on water activity in all three stress conditions.
Relatively few members of the EST set were responsive
to elevated temperature, however. This fits with general
observations in other invertebrates and plants where a
large overlap in the stress responses to dehydration,
osmotic stress and cold is observed, but where heat
stress activates a different response pathway [72]. The
complexity of the response to water loss is illustrated by
the involvement of molecular chaperone/shield proteins,
redox balancing systems, osmolyte biosynthetic enzymes,
C-type lectins, protein and polysaccharide metabolic
enzymes, as well as genes controlling gene transcription
and signal transduction pathways. In particular, new
LEA and LEA-like protein genes were identified suggesting that several proteins of this type are involved in the
response to water stress in invertebrates, as in plants. It
seems unlikely, however, that the diversity of the LEA
proteome in invertebrates will rival that of plants, where
>50 LEA protein genes can be found in a single organism [73,74]; in C. elegans, for example, only three such
genes have been noted [24].

While such information on transcriptional stress
responses can be extremely useful in assessing which
genes and regulatory systems are involved in combating
the stress imposed, it is becoming clear, at least in some
organisms such as yeast, that not all stress-induced
genes are essential for stress tolerance. Thus, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, very few genes
required for DNA repair were induced by DNA-damaging agents [75]. Other researchers report similar conclusions for yeast subjected to osmotic stress [76],
oxidative stress [77], and anaerobic growth conditions
[78]. It is therefore important, if possible, to go beyond
a purely correlative study, where stress-induced genes
are catalogued, to experiments where genes of interest
can be mutated or silenced and the effect of this on
stress tolerance determined.
Silencing of specific gene targets by RNAi has been
invaluable in nematodes, in particular C. elegans, as an
alternative to mutagenesis that allows gene function to
be probed on a large scale [79,80]. Such high throughput functional genomics would be ideal for identifying
the anhydrobiotic gene set in a nematode such as A.
avenae. Unfortunately, attempts to perform RNAi on A.
avenae by microinjection, or by soaking in dsRNA corresponding to the gene target, were not successful. This

Reardon et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/6

might be due to resistance or partial resistance to RNAi
in this species, as has been found in some animal parasitic nematodes [81]. However, with the soaking method,
recalcitrance might simply reflect poor ingestion of surrounding medium by A. avenae, since fluorescently
labelled dsRNA was not visible in its intestine. Alternative RNAi strategies might be to attempt a biolistic
delivery method, as recently demonstrated in dehydration-stressed barley leaves [82], or to introduce dsRNA
by electroporation, as described for the gastrointestinal
parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis [83]. However,
such RNAi techniques would be difficult to adapt for a
high throughput screening experiment.
The cross-species method developed here, which
exploits the relative ease with which RNAi can be performed in P. superbus [70], was extremely useful in
allowing a limited screen of A. avenae sequences. Only
two out of 20 A. avenae ESTs tested gave a marked
reduction in P. superbus desiccation tolerance, but this
probably reflects a requirement by the RNAi machinery
for precise sequence matching between the short interfering RNAs generated from dsRNA and the target
mRNA [84]; sequence divergence of homologous RNA
targets will reduce the efficacy of RNAi across species. It
is also formally possible that, as in yeast, many genes
induced by water stress in A. avenae are not required
for stress tolerance in P. superbus, or indeed in A. avenae. Nevertheless, the observation that silencing of two
particular transcripts reduces survival of drying in P.
superbus is the first such demonstration in any desiccation-tolerant organism and demonstrates the potential
for RNAi in dissecting anhydrobiosis and determining
the desiccome. This result also demonstrates the advantage of P. superbus as a model anhydrobiote. Accordingly, a large cognate EST dataset has already been
assembled for high throughput screening by RNAi for
genes required in anhydrobiosis in this nematode; a
number of interesting candidates have been identified
and are currently being characterised (Tyson et al.,
unpublished). The availability of a panel of other Panagrolaimus species of varying degrees of desiccation tolerance will also be useful for comparative studies of the
phenomenon [7].
Of the two A. avenae ESTs that gave a phenotype in
the cross-species RNAi desiccation experiments, one
was a novel sequence not represented in sequence collections. This EST, GR463921, is only 350 bp in length
and is not full length, since it lacks clearly defined 5’
and 3’ ends, as would be signified by a spliced leader
and polyA tail, respectively (although a proportion of
nematode mRNAs lack spliced leaders; [59]). Nevertheless, it shows modest upregulation during desiccation
and osmotic stress, and merits further investigation by
isolation of full length cDNA clones from A. avenae and

Page 11 of 18

a search for cognate sequences in P. superbus; the latter
must exist for the cross-species RNAi to have been successful. However, an alternative role for GR463921
might be as a non-coding RNA involved in regulating
anhydrobiosis in nematodes. A precedent for this exists
in the desiccation-tolerant resurrection plant, C. plantagineum, where an abundant, small non-coding RNA
(CDT-1) is able to induce tolerance in callus tissue [85].
CDT-1 is a member of a family of retroelements which
govern synthesis of siRNA involved in control of desiccation tolerance pathways [86]. Formation of dsRNA is
probably important for CDT-1 function and, intriguingly, the GR463921 sequence is predicted to form a
high degree of secondary structure (Additional File 3) by
the RNAfold algorithm ([87]; http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at).
It will therefore be of interest to investigate this transcript further with a view to understanding its precise
role in nematode anhydrobiosis.
The second EST giving an RNAi phenotype on desiccation, which matches glutathione peroxidase sequences
in GenBank and other sequence collections, was a full
length cDNA of 649 bp including its spliced leader
(SL1a) but excluding its polyA tail. It appears to contain
an open reading frame of 151 amino acids (Mr 17480)
bounded by a UGA stop codon. However, some glutathione peroxidases are known to contain selenocysteine [88,89] which is not directly represented in the
genetic code, but is incorporated into nascent protein
when the ribosome reads UGA in the presence of a selenocysteine insertion element in the mRNA [90]. Therefore, the predicted open reading frame might be shorter
than the actual protein length; indeed, there are two inframe UGA codons before a third, TAA, stop codon is
encountered, consistent with up to two selenocysteines
being incorporated into the A. avenae glutathione peroxidase. The two P. superbus glutathione peroxidase
ESTs, GR881191 (Ps114) and GR881192 (Ps92), are
somewhat longer than the A. avenae example, at 735 bp
and 808 bp, respectively. Ps114 does not quite extend to
the 3’ end, since its open reading frame of 230 amino
acids lacks a stop codon, while the reading frame of
Ps92 is likely complete at 228 residues. Interestingly,
both predicted proteins from P. superbus have a hydrophobic sequence of about 20 amino acids at their Nterminal ends consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum
translocation signal. Both proteins are therefore probably secreted; indeed, the best BLAST matches are with
cuticular glutathione peroxidases from other nematodes.
For example, the Ps114 protein gives a score of 7E-70
with the cuticular glutathione peroxidase from Brugia
pahangi, also known as its major surface antigen gp29.
In contrast, the A. avenae protein does not contain a
signal peptide and therefore is probably intracellular. As
such, the A. avenae and P. superbus glutathione

Reardon et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/6

peroxidases described are likely to have different locations within each nematode, and to have different substrate preferences, with the secreted P. superbus
examples not metabolising hydrogen peroxide but
instead larger hydroperoxide substrates such as lipid
peroxides. The fact that both types of enzyme are implicated in anhydrobiosis is consistent with the need to
protect both intracellular and membrane targets from
oxidative stress during desiccation.
To further investigate the role of antioxidants in
nematode anhydrobiosis, we also identified a third P.
superbus EST, Ps41 (accession number GR881190),
which is likely to encode a peroxiredoxin (also called
thioredoxin peroxidase) since it gave a highly significant
BLASTX match (6E-47) with the C. elegans prdx-6 gene.
Like glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins are also
thiol peroxidases involved in the control of cellular peroxide levels, and both classes of enzyme are evolutionarily related [91]. Preliminary, unpublished results
suggest that RNAi treatment with peroxiredoxin dsRNA
also reduces survival of desiccation in P. superbus, consistent with a role for a second type of thiol peroxidase
in nematode anhydrobiosis.
Oxidative stress is experienced by organisms undergoing a wide range of abiotic stress conditions, probably
due to malfunction of mitochondria (and chloroplasts in
plants) resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species
[92]. Accordingly, an oxidative stress response forms
part of the environmental stress response defined by
Gasch et al. [93] in yeast and is part of the minimal
stress response described by Kültz [94]. Desiccation
stress is no exception and it has long been recognised
that antioxidants are likely to play a role in desiccation
tolerance (reviewed in [95-97]). Recent global studies in
plants have reinforced this perception (reviewed in [98])
and, for example, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase, amongst other antioxidants, are induced by dehydration in desiccation-tolerant resurrection plants
[99,100].
The demonstration of a role for glutathione peroxidase in nematode anhydrobiosis is consistent with, and
validates, the many correlative studies which have previously implicated antioxidants. In nematodes, for
instance, three studies have identified dehydrationinduced genes encoding antioxidant enzymes: Gal et al.
[8] described a number of ESTs from S. feltiae, a desiccation-resistant entomopathogenic species, including a
glutathione peroxidase; in A. avenae, a glutaredoxin
gene was induced by drying, together with an LEA protein gene and a gene encoding another hydrophilic protein, anhydrin [24]; and, in a recent large-scale study of
the Antarctic nematode P. murrayi by Adhikari et al.
([25]; and see review by Wharton and Marshall [101]),
genes encoding glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide

Page 12 of 18

dismutase, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase
were included in a dehydration-induced EST panel. The
present study takes our understanding of anhydrobiosis
a step further by showing a reduced level of desiccation
tolerance after silencing glutathione peroxidase transcripts, thus clearly demonstrating a stress-combative
role for antioxidants. Further work will explore gene
silencing more extensively in P. superbus to determine
the desiccome in this species in more detail.

Conclusions
Using a combination of differential cloning, expression
profiling and cross-species RNAi, we have identified a
panel of genes implicated in the response to desiccation in the anhydrobiotic nematode, A. avenae. The
gene set includes novel hydrophilic proteins, one of
which is a previously-undescribed LEA protein, and
other stress response genes controlling synthesis of
compatible solutes, chaperone systems and antioxidants. The large majority of these genes were upregulated by evaporative water loss, and many also by
osmotic upshift and low temperature, conditions which
also involve water stress. We also presented evidence
for RNAi recalcitrance in A. avenae, but were able to
show cross-species RNAi of two A. avenae sequences
in another anhydrobiotic nematode, P. superbus. One
of these was a novel sequence, which is potentially a
non-coding regulatory RNA, and the second encoded
an intracellular glutathione peroxidase: both reduced
survival of desiccation of P. superbus after RNAi treatment. Two cognate glutathione peroxidase sequences
from P. superbus were also identified and, when used
for RNAi, were shown to have a similar effect on
desiccation tolerance. These results therefore demonstrate the complex nature of desiccation tolerance and
emphasise the need for effective antioxidant systems in
anhydrobiosis.
Methods
Culture, desiccation and stress treatment of nematodes

Aphelenchus avenae was grown in the dark at 20°C on
the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, itself grown on a substrate of wheat [102]. After a growth period of 2-3
weeks (before swarming of the nematodes in the jars),
nematodes were rinsed with tap water and brought to a
concentration of approximately 3,300 worms per ml.
Nematodes were cleaned in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution,
followed by three washes in tap water and the nematodes were transferred to 25 mm Supor® Membrane
Disc Filters (0.45 μm, Pall Corporation, Michigan, USA;
30,000 nematodes per filter) by vacuum filtration. These
were placed in a desiccation chamber at 20°C for 24 h
over a saturated solution of MgSO4.7H2O (90% RH), or
over a saturated solution of KCl (85% RH) [103].

For the qPCR experiments the nematodes were grown
and harvested as described above but they were cleaned
by placing the nematode pellet in a sieve containing a
layer of Kleenex® allowing them to crawl through the
paper (for 2-3 h) into the water filled dish in which the
sieve had been placed. A. avenae populations were
exposed to individual stresses as follows. Heat stress:
one replicate consisted of 1 ml of the above worm suspension placed in a 30 mm Petri dish incubated at 32°C
for 24 h. Cold stress: one replicate consisted of 1 ml of
worm suspension in a 30 mm Petri dish incubated at 4°
C for 24 h. Desiccation: one replicate consisted of 1 ml
of worm suspension vacuum filtered onto a 25 mm
Supor® membrane disc and placed in a desiccation
chamber set at 90% RH (using a saturated solution of
MgSO 4 .7H2 O) for 24 h. Osmotic stress: one replicate
consisted of 1 ml of worm suspension added to 1 ml of
1 M sucrose solution in a 30 mm Petri dish and placed
at 20°C for 24 h. Control nematodes consisted of 1 ml
of worm suspension in 30 mm Petri dishes incubated at
20°C for 24 h. Three biological replicates were set up
for each stress and for control worms. These stress conditions yielded an 80% survival rate for each stress compared to a 90% survival rate for the control worms.
P. superbus and C. elegans were grown on NGM
plates and fed Escherichia coli strain OP50, or strain
HT115 carrying an empty L4440 plasmid, in the dark at
25°C.
Construction of a desiccation induced EST library

Total RNA was extracted from desiccated and control
nematodes using TRI® Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich GmbH,
Steinheim, Germany). Total RNA from desiccated
nematodes was converted to 5’-oligo-capped cDNA
using the GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The GeneRacer™ Oligo dT primer was used in the
reverse transcription reaction. PCR was carried out on
the 5’-oligo-capped cDNA with the GeneRacer™ 5’-primer (CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA) and the
GeneRacer™ 3’-primer (GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACG) using Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase
(Invitrogen). The product of this reaction was cloned
into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector using a TOPO-TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen).
Reverse Northern hybridization

Recombinant clones were PCR amplified in a 96 well
plate using standard M13 forward and reverse primers
and the presence of an insert was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were
denatured by adding NaOH to a total concentration of
0.4 M and EDTA to a total concentration of 0.04 M and
heating at 99°C for 10 min. The denatured DNA was
blotted onto Hybond™-N+ transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) in duplicate

Page 13 of 18

using a SRC 60-D Dot Blot Minifold (Schleicher &
Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were air
dried at 55°C for 30 min and UV-crosslinked using a
UV Stratalinker® 1800 (1200 mJ; Stratagene, California,
USA).
Screening the EST library

Total RNA was extracted from desiccated (90% RH for
24 h) and control nematodes as before [24]. The RNA
was resuspended in 30 μl DEPC-treated H2O, concentration determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm
and adjusted to 1 μg/μl. 5 μg of RNA was converted to
cDNA using the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen). Experimental (desiccated) and control probes were constructed by radiolabelling this
cDNA with [32P]-dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene® Labelling System (Promega, Southampton, UK) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. One replicate of
each dot blot membrane was hybridized with the experimental probe and the corresponding replicate was hybridized with the control probe. Hybridisation was carried
out in hybridisation buffer (5% dextran sulfate, 1 M
NaCl, 1% SDS in water) at 60°C for 18 h in glass tubes
with gentle rotation. The membranes were washed twice
in wash buffer (10× SSC, 0.5% SDS in water) for 4 min
at room temperature followed by two washes for 15 min
at 60°C. The membranes were then exposed on XOMAT AR photography paper (Kodak, New York,
USA) for 24 h. The control and experimental dot blots
were digitally scanned and analyzed using the ImageQuant TL Array Analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Clones considered to be upregulated in
response to desiccation were selected for sequencing
and sent to Agowa GmbH (Berlin, Germany). The
resulting sequences were assembled into contigs using
the online sequence assembly program CAP3 http://pbil.
univ-lyon1.fr/cap3.php, yielding a dataset of 88 unique
ESTs, enriched in those upregulated in response to
desiccation.
Bioinformatics

The POPPs [35] is a suite of applications, one of which
clusters protein sequences based on similarities in their
peptide compositions, in this case to see whether the
input sequence clusters with any of the LEA protein
groups and, if so, which. The GRAVY calculation was
undertaken by a small Python application which uses
the Eisenberg Consensus scale [104] in preference to the
Kyte-Doolittle scale [105], which has well known
anomalies. Three predictors of unfolded proteins were
used in this study: Foldindex ([106]; http://bip.weizmann.ac.il/fldbin/findex/, VL-XT ([107]; http://www.
pondr.com) and IUPred ([108]; http://iupred.enzim.hu).
Uversky plots [109] of charge vs. hydropathy were performed at pondr.com and raw data downloaded to construct graphical output in GraphPad Prism version 4.0b

Reardon et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/6

(GraphPad Software, California, USA). An application
called Perdix was used to search the input sequences for
amino acid periodicity, i.e. amino acids that recur every
N amino acids. So, for example, in the peptide GAGPG
the G recurs with period 2. The application Perdix, and
the earlier application for computing hydrophobicity
and other peptide statistics, both currently unpublished,
can be obtained from Wise. The pairwise sequence
alignment application ALIGN [110] is part of the San
Diego Supercomputer Workbench http://workbench.
sdsc.edu.
Quantitative real time PCR

The replicate worm samples from each individual stress
treatment were pooled and RNA was extracted using
Trizol reagent for each stressed and control worms followed by treatment with DNAse I (RNase free, Invitrogen). The concentration and quality of RNA was
determined using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop Spectrophotometer. Total RNA (1 μg per reaction) was converted to cDNA using the Roche Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. Primers were designed for
each gene to amplify a fragment of approximately 125
bp (see Additional File 4). Real time qPCR reactions
were carried out with a Roche LightCycler 480 thermocycler using Roche SYBR I Master Mix with 0.0025
pmol primers (each), 500 ng of sample cDNA template
and 0.5 U heat-labile uracil-N-glycosolase per reaction.
Relative expressions were calculated using the second
derivative maximum method with A. avenae 5.8S rRNA
and ama-1 genes as reference genes. Statistically significant differences in expression levels were confirmed
using ANOVA with a confidence level of 99.9% and
Dunnett’s comparison test with a = 1.
Assessing A. avenae for RNAi capability

Two ama-1 cDNA fragments were obtained from A.
avenae by RT-PCR. The short fragment (322 bp), was
obtained with the primers AaAMA1s (5’-TTTTTCATGCAATGGGCGGTC-3’; forward) and AaAMA1as (5’ACATAAACCTCTCTCACGACG-3’; reverse). Reverse
transcription was performed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and
the PCR was done under the following conditions: 95°C
5 min; then 35 cycles of 95 C 30 s, 57°C 30 s and 72°C
1 min; with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. A
longer version of ama-1 cDNA (800 bp) was cloned
using the same RT-PCR conditions with primers Aa.
AMA1.s2 (5’-ACGTCGACTGATTAAGGCCAT-3’; forward) and Aa.AMA1.as3 (5’-TGATGATCTCCTTCAGACGAG-3’; reverse). PCR products underwent a
second amplification round using T7-tagged primers.
These new amplicons were then used for in vitro transcription using Ampliscribe T7 Flash Transcription Kit
(Epicentre) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For
RNAi attempts, worms were soaked in 20 μl soaking

Page 14 of 18

buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH7.0) containing dsRNA (1 μg/
μl) for 24 h and then plated on LB agar plates (50 μg/
ml carbenicillin). Worms were placed over a small spot
of fungus (Botrytis cinerea) previously grown on the LB
agar plate for 24 h. Survival analysis was performed by
observation under a microscope. C. elegans was treated
in a similar fashion except worms were incubated with
GFP and unc-22 dsRNA for 24 h at ambient temperature and recovered on E. coli-seeded NGM plates until
phenotypes were observed. For dsRNA uptake analysis,
dsRNA molecules were first synthesised by in vitro transcription from undigested L4440-GFP plasmids. Then 5
μg dsRNA was labelled using Label IT CX-rhodamine
Nucleic Acid Labeling Kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Mirus/Cambridge Bioscience). Worms
were soaked in 20 μl soaking buffer for 22 h at 15°C in
the dark. Uptake efficiency was assessed using a confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM510 META).
Cross-species RNA interference and desiccation tolerance

Plasmid DNA of selected A. avenae EST clones (in
TOPO vector; Invitrogen) were digested using Sac I
(NEB) and Xho I (NEB), inserts were gel-purified and
ligated into Sac I/Xho I -digested L4440 feeding vector
[80]. Competent HT115 cells were transformed with
ligation products and selected on LB ampicillin (100 μg/
mL). Subcloning was confirmed by digesting L4440 plasmids with Sac I/Xho I. Transformed HT115 clones containing individual plasmids for RNAi were each grown
in 10 ml LB ampicillin (50 μg/mL) overnight, recovered
by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 μl plain LB
medium. Bacteria were transferred to Petri dish plates (9
cm diameter) containing NGM agar plus IPTG (240 μg/
ml) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Plates were left for 24 h
at ambient temperature to allow dsRNA induction. P.
superbus was prepared for RNAi as follows: a large (140
mm) NGM plate containing mixed stage animals with
many gravid adults was harvested, worms washed 3× in
M9 buffer and synchronised by bleaching (3 min in 1%
NaOCl, 0.5 M NaOH). After bleaching, worms were
washed 3× in M9 and left to hatch in M9 on a shaker
for 48 h. Approximately 1500 worms were placed onto
each feeding plate (three per test gene) where they
remained for approximately 12 days in the dark at 25°C
before desiccation. Worms were then collected, washed
3× in M9 buffer, counted and placed onto three 25 mm
Supor® Membrane Disc Filters by vacuum filtration
(approximately 300 RNAi-treated worms per filter) and
processed as follows: 24 h at 90% RH (saturated BaCl2);
24 h at 10% RH (dry silica gel) and overnight in M9
buffer. Non-desiccated control worms were processed as
follows: 48 h at 100% RH (UHP H2O) and 24 h in M9
buffer. All treatments were in 350 ml sealed plastic
boxes. After rehydration, viability was assessed under
the microscope, where 80 worms were randomly chosen

Reardon et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/6

for analysis from each filter (spontaneously moving
worms were considered alive). C. elegans fed with a
clone expressing unc-22 dsRNA was used as a positive
control of RNAi treatment (twitching phenotype). Negative controls consisted of P. superbus and C. elegans
worms fed with a clone expressing GFP (green fluorescent protein) dsRNA. Statistical relevance was determined by one-way ANOVA and a Tukey post hoc test
using InStat3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Additional file 1: The molecular phylogeny of representative
polygalacturonase protein sequences from bacteria, fungi and plants. The
phylogenetic positions of the nematode and insect polygalacturonase
sequences, postulated to have been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer, are indicated in blue. Sequence alignments were constructed
using Clustal W1 and the unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed
using the Neighbor-Joining Method2 as implemented by MEGA (version
3.1)3. All sites containing alignment gaps and missing information were
removed from the analysis. The Poisson correction distance for multiple
substitutions at the same site was used and substitution rates among
sites were considered to be different (the gamma shape parameter was
set at a = 2). The accession numbers of the polygalacturonase
