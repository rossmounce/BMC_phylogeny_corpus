microbial consortia enriched from a non
acclimated, complex source of microorganisms

Abstract
Background: The bioremediation of soils impacted by diesel fuels is very often limited by the lack of indigenous
microflora with the required broad substrate specificity. In such cases, the soil inoculation with cultures with the
desired catabolic capabilities (bioaugmentation) is an essential option. The use of consortia of microorganisms
obtained from rich sources of microbes (e.g., sludges, composts, manure) via enrichment (i.e., serial growth
transfers) on the polluting hydrocarbons would provide bioremediation enhancements more robust and
reproducible than those achieved with specialized pure cultures or tailored combinations (co-cultures) of them,
together with none or minor risks of soil loading with unrelated or pathogenic allocthonous microorganisms.
Results: In this work, two microbial consortia, i.e., ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, were enriched from ENZYVEBA (a complex
commercial source of microorganisms) on Diesel (G1) and HiQ Diesel (G2), respectively, and characterized in terms
of microbial composition and hydrocarbon biodegradation capability and specificity.
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 exhibited a comparable and remarkable biodegradation capability and specificity towards nC10 to n-C24 linear paraffins by removing about 90% of 1 g l-1 of diesel fuel applied after 10 days of aerobic shaken flask batch culture incubation at 30°C. Cultivation dependent and independent approaches evidenced that
both consortia consist of bacteria belonging to the genera Chryseobacterium, Acinetobacter, Psudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes and Gordonia along with the fungus Trametes gibbosa. However, only the fungus was found
to grow and remarkably biodegrade G1 and G2 hydrocarbons under the same conditions. The biodegradation
activity and specificity and the microbial composition of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 did not significantly change after
cryopreservation and storage at -20°C for several months.
Conclusions: ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 are very similar highly enriched consortia of bacteria and a fungus capable of
extensively degrading a broad range of the hydrocarbons mainly composing diesel fuels. Given their remarkable
biodegradation potential, stability and resistance to cryopreservation, both consortia appear very interesting
candidates for bioaugmentation operations on Diesel fuel impacted soils and sites.

Background
Diesel fuels are complex mixtures of saturated hydrocarbons (primarily paraffins including n, iso, and cycloparaffins), and aromatic hydrocarbons (including
naphthalenes and alkylbenzenes) obtained from the middle-distillate, gas-oil fraction during petroleum separation. Due to their massive production and use as fuels
for transportation, they are among the most common
sources of organic pollutants for the surface soil. They

also impact the subsurface soil through leaking from
underground storage tanks and pipelines. Due to their
mobility in soil, such released diesel fuel hydrocarbons
can reach water intakes and/or groundwater reservoirs,
thus generating relevant risks for humans and other living organisms [1].
The majority of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons can
be biodegraded by several microbial strains each however capable of breaking down a specific group of molecules; the biodegradation potential generally decreases
by moving from n-alkanes to branched alkanes, lowmolecular weight n-alkyl aromatics, monoaromatics,

cyclic alkanes and polynuclear aromatics [2-4]. However,
the mineralization of complex hydrocarbon mixtures
such as those composing diesel fuels, usually requires
the co-existence and effective cooperation of several
specialized microorganisms with complementary substrate specificity [5-7]. Microbial consortia with such
physiological and metabolic features might not exist in a
soil, in particular if only recently impacted by a diesel
fuel release, and this is often the main cause of the poor
bio-treatability of diesel fuel contaminated soils and
sites. In such cases, the inoculation of the impacted soil
with high concentrations of characterized cultures of
highly specialized microbes (bioaugmentation) is one of
the most promising options for getting its sustainable
remediation.
The use of pure cultures and co-cultures of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms has been tested with
interesting results on hydrocarbons contaminated soils;
however, the behaviour and metabolic activity of the
applied cultures are very often not those expected and
they are often not reproducible [8-11]. Recently, the use
of complex microbial sources, such as those occurring
in sludge, manure or compost, has been proposed. They
generally carry a high diversity of bacteria and fungi
with a high genetic and metabolic diversity, along with a
variety of essential nutrients that might remarkably contribute to sustain the survival and colonization of
allocthonous microbes in the inoculated biotope [12-19].
However, some of such complex microbial sources contain remarkable loads of non-necessary biotope extraneous microbes, along with pathogenic bacteria, such as
Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter
coli and C. jejuni [20,21], and therefore their application
in bioaugmentation strategies might provide environmental risks that should be carefully evaluated. On the
contrary, the use of the specialized portion of microflora
of such sources would provide higher and more reproducible pollutant mineralization rates and extents with
respect to those achievable with pure or tailored mixed
cultures of specialized microorganisms [7,9,22]. This is
mostly due to the ability of the members of enriched
consortia to retain their native ability to cooperate with
each other, also with strains apparently without biodegradation capabilities, that might contribute to the
growth and activity of those in charge for the final pollutant mineralization [6]. However, the stability of such
complex microbial populations in terms of microbial
composition and growth and biodegradation behaviour
in the contaminated matrices needs to be determined
and assessed, also after prolonged maintenance under
both growing and storage conditions [7,23,24].
ENZYVEBA, a partially characterized complex consortium of not-adapted microorganisms developed through
prolonged stabilization of cow manure [25-28], was

recently applied in bioaugmentation studies [15,16] and
found capable of intensifying the aerobic remediation of
a soil freshly contaminated by two different diesel fuels,
i.e. regular diesel fuel (G1) and HiQ diesel fuel (G2), by
acting as a source of both exogenous specialized microorganisms and nutrients [16]. Thus, it was of interest to
obtain and characterize its native microbial population
capable of diesel fuel hydrocarbon degradation. Two
highly enriched microbial populations were obtained
from ENZYVEBA through 5 sequential transfers in
mineral minimal medium with G1 or G2 as growth substrates. They were then characterized in terms of biodegradation extents, rates and specificity, microbial
composition and stability upon cryopreservation, in
order to determine their actual potential to be applied
in bioaugmentation procedures for diesel fuel contaminated sites. This study is one of the few in which two
highly performing diesel fuel mineralizing consortia are
obtained from composted related matrices and are
described; further it is the first one in which the presence and the key role of a fungus in consortia obtained
through conventional enrichment procedures for bacteria is documented and characterized.

Results
Diesel fuel-degrading consortia obtained from ENZYVEBA

The two microbial consortia ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 were
obtained from ENZYVEBA through 5 consecutive culture transfers (2% v/v) on minimum mineral medium
(MMM) for bacteria amended with Diesel (G1) and HiQ
Diesel (G2) respectively applied at 1 g l -1 as the main
carbon and energy source. Once inoculated in duplicated sterile cultures of MMM with their own diesel
fuel at 1 g l -1 in the presence of 20 mg l -1 of yeast
extract and incubated at 30°C under shaken flask conditions, both ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 degraded rapidly and
extensively G1 and G2 hydrocarbons, respectively, with
rates which were in average, during the first four days of
incubation, 160.9 ± 7.9 and 175.7 ± 3.1 mg of overall
hydrocarbons depleted l-1 day-1, respectively. The hydrocarbon degradation then proceeded slowly up to the
tenth day of incubation, when the initial amount of
overall applied hydrocarbons resulted to be removed by
90.8 ± 1.2% and 89.4 ± 0.1% in ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2,
respectively (Figure 1A). The activity of both consortia
was mainly directed towards linear C10-C24 paraffins;
among these, medium-high MW n-alkanes (C18-C24)
were in general degraded more extensively than medium-low MW n-alkanes during the first days of incubation (Figure 2, Table 1). In particular, depletions around
70% and 60% were detected for C18-C24 and C12-C16
n-paraffins, respectively, after 1 day of incubation in
ENZ-G1 culture and after 2 days of incubation in ENZG2 culture, whereas degradation of 21%-22% was

observed for n-decane after two days of incubation
(Table 1). However, comparable final depletions of 94%100% were achieved for all n-paraffines in both cultures
at the end of incubation (10 days) (Figure 2, Table 1).
No GC-FID detectable intermediates were observed to
accumulate in the ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 cultures
throughout the 10 days of incubation. The bacterial biomass able to grow on TSA medium grew rapidly during
the first 3 days of incubation by increasing from 5.4 ×
10 6 ± 7.5 × 10 4 and 6.9 × 10 6 ± 6.0 × 10 5 CFU ml -1
observed at the beginning of incubation in ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 cultures, respectively, to values of 1.0 × 109 ±
1.5 × 107 and 1.3 × 109 ± 1.8 × 108 CFU ml-1, respectively (Figure 1B).
After cryopreservation and storage at -20°C for 6
months, ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 displayed G1 and G2
hydrocarbon biodegradation rates, extents and specificity
as well as cultivable bacterial biomass growth profiles
comparable to those observed for the same consortia
under the same culture conditions before storage (Figure 1). In particular, average degradation rates of 143.9
± 6.4 and 162.7 ± 2.2 mg of overall hydrocarbons
depleted l-1 day-1 were detected after four days of incubation in ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 cultures, respectively,
and final depletions of overall applied hydrocarbons of
90.7 ± 0.6% (ENZ-G1) and 88.2 ± 0.4% (ENZ-G2) were
observed at the end of incubation (Figure 1A). In addition, the concentration of the bacterial biomass able to
grow on TSA medium increased from 7.6 × 106 ± 1.8 ×
106 to 5.2 × 108 ± 4.4 × 107 CFU ml-1 and from 1.2 ×
107 ± 3.2 × 105 to 5.7 × 108 ± 3.6 × 107 CFU ml-1 during the first 3 days of incubation in ENZ-G1 and ENZG2 cultures, respectively (Figure 1B). A careful observation of the morphology of colonies grown on TSA plates
after 5 days of incubation indicated that both consortia
were composed by seven bacterial components, two of
which were numerically predominant on the others.
Characterization of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2

The bacterial composition of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 was
characterized after the 5 th enrichment cycle by using

two cultivation-independent methods based on 16S
rRNA genes screening, i.e. 16S rDNA clonal libraries
and PCR-DGGE fingerprinting of community 16S
rDNA. Only three different OTUs were detected in each
clonal library. Both clonal libraries from ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 cultures were dominated by OTU1, that represented 96% of screened clones and was 99% identical to
16S rRNA gene sequence of Acinetobacter baumannii
strain NBRAJG89. OTU2 and OTU3 showed their highest sequence similarity to a Paracoccus versutus strain
and represented 2% each of ENZ-G1 clones. On the
contrary, 4% of ENZ-G2 clones were equally represented
by OTU4, having 95% sequence identity with an uncultured Gammaproteobacterium, and by OTU5, having
99% sequence similarity with an uncultured Achromobacter sp. clone (Table 2).
On the other hand, according to DGGE analysis 7
main phylotypes apparently occurred in ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 cultures (Figure 3, lanes 1 and 3). ENZ-G1
consisted of phylotypes 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, whereas ENZG2 comprised all the 7 phylotypes. Band excision and
sequencing revealed that phylotype 1 belonged to Chryseobacterium genus of Bacteroidetes, phylotypes 2, 3
and 6 to the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and
Stenotrophomonas of Gammaproteobacteria, respectively, phylotype 4 to the Sphingopyxis genus of Alphaproteobacteria and phylotype 5 to the genus
Achromobacter of Betaproteobacteria (Table 2).
Repeated attempts to PCR-amplify and sequence the
DGGE band corresponding to phylotype 7 were
unsuccessful.
DGGE analysis repeated on ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2
after cryotreatment and storage at -20°C evidenced the
persistence of almost all the major components of the
consortium (Figure 3). Only phylotypes 1 and 3 became
undetectable in DGGE profiles of ENZ-G2 after storage
and three sub-culturing steps (Figure 3, lane 4). On the
other hand, phylotypes 2, 5 and 6 exhibited the highest
relative band intensity in all profiles of both ENZ-G1
and ENZ-G2, thus suggesting they were the dominant
members of both communities. Remarkably, the

enrichment steps; hollow symbols refer to ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2
cultures after cryopreservation and storage at -20°C for six months
followed by three additional sub-culturing cycles.

Acinetobacter genus represented by DGGE phylotype 2
was also the most abundant according to clone library
screening (OTU1).
Isolation of cultivable members of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2
consortia

ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 plated on TSA displayed 6 and 7
different types of bacterial colonies, respectively. Over
forty isolates were obtained from plates of ENZ-G1 or
ENZ-G2. Those having the same colony morphology
generated the same ARDRA profile. Thus 16S rRNA
gene of one isolate for each unique restriction profile
was sequenced for phylogenetic identification. Six pure
cultures of bacteria, namely ENZ1 to ENZ6, were thus
obtained from both ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 plated on
TSA medium, and a seventh isolate (ENZ7) was
obtained only from ENZ-G2; each isolate was

transferred at least twice in liquid MMM with G1 or G2
at 1 g l-1. One isolate, i.e. ENZ5, obtained from either
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, failed to grow at the second
transfer. All the others bacterial isolates grew very
poorly and slowly. Isolates ENZ1, ENZ4 and ENZ6 were
placed in the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and
Stenotrophomonas of Gammaproteobacteria, isolate
ENZ3 in the genus Achromobacter of Betaproteobacteria, isolate ENZ2 into the genus Chryseobacterium of
Bacteroidetes and isolate ENZ7 in the genus Gordonia
of Actinobacteria (Table 3). Remarkably, 16S RNA gene
sequence of isolate ENZ1 (Acinetobacter baumannii)
was highly similar to that of DGGE phylotype 2 and to
OTU 1 identified in clonal libraries; whereas isolate
ENZ2 (Chryseobacterium taichungense) was highly similar to DGGE phylotype 1, isolate ENZ3 (Alcaligenes sp.)
to DGGE phylotype 5, isolate ENZ4 (Pseudomonas stutzeri) to DGGE band 3 and isolate ENZ6 (Stenotrophomonas acidiminiphila) to DGGE phylotype 6 (Figure 4).
Conversely, 16S rRNA sequence of isolate ENZ7 did not
correspond to any of the phylotypes detected by DGGE
or in clonal libraries of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2.
None of the characterized isolates degraded efficiently
and in a reproducible manner G1 or G2 hydrocarbons
under the liquid culture conditions described above
adopted for determining ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 biodegradation potential (data not shown). No fungal colonies
were observed to grow on TSA plates inoculated with
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 after 10 days of incubation. However, the use of MEA plates evidenced that both consortia contained fungi which displayed the same colony
morphology (hyaline sterile mycelium). Some fungal isolates were obtained from ENZ-G1 or ENZ-G2 inoculated MEA plates but all of them were 100% identical to
ITS gene sequences of several Trametes gibbosa strains.
One of the fungal isolates, designated as ENZ8, was
assayed for its ability to degrade G1 and G2 under the
shaken flask batch conditions adopted for determining
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 biodegradation potential. It was
found to remove 60% and 66% of overall applied G1
and G2 hydrocarbons, respectively, in 20 days of incubation (Figure 5). No GC-FID detectable intermediates
were observed to accumulate in the cultures throughout
their incubation. The fungal biomass grew rapidly during the first 5 days of incubation on G1 and G2 hydrocarbons, by increasing from 0.01 to about 0.40 g of dry
biomass per 20 ml of culture medium (Figure 5). Extracellular ligninolytic enzyme activities were detected
throughout the experiment, although generally at concentrations which were low and changed with the sampling time. A comparable laccase activity was detected
in the culture medium throughout incubation on both
G1 and G2, with a maximum activity of 14.0 and 12.5
Ul-1, respectively, at the 10th day of incubation (Figure

ENZ8 was grown on G2 hydrocarbons, in particular
after 5 days on incubation (19.2 Ul -1 , Figure 5B),
whereas the same enzymatic activity remained below 2.5

Discussion
Despite the majority of hydrocarbon constituents of diesel fuels are biodegraded by several microorganisms
commonly occurring in soil each capable of breaking
down a specific group of molecules [1], the bioremediation of soils and sites contaminated by diesel fuels is
often limited by the poor biodiversity of indigenous
microflora and/or the scarcity of indigenous specialized
microbes with the complementary substrate specificity
required to degrade the different hydrocarbons occurring at the contaminated site [7,29]. ENZYVEBA, a

complex source of bacteria and fungi obtained through
the prolonged stabilization of high quality organic
wastes, was recently found capable of enhancing the
aerobic bioremediation of a pristine soil freshly contaminated by diesel fuels, by providing both exogenous specialized microorganisms and nutrients [16]. In the
present work, two microbial consortia, i.e., ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2, able to grow on G1 or G2 in the absence of
other carbon and energy sources, were obtained from
ENZYVEBA through a conventional enrichment procedure and deeply characterized. In the view of employing
them in bioaugmentation strategies of diesel fuels
impacted sites, their ability to retain their biodegradation potential and community composition after cryopreservation was also investigated.
Both ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 exhibited high diesel fuel
hydrocarbons biodegradation rates and yields, being able
to remove about 90% of the applied 1 g l -1 of G1 and
G2, respectively, in 10 days of shaken batch aerobic

culture incubation (Figure 1A). A comparable hydrocarbons biodegradation activity was displayed by both
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 after cryopreservation and storage
at -20°C for six months (Figure 1A). The two consortia
also displayed a similar biodegradation specificity
towards G1 and G2 hydrocarbons, which were biodegraded simultaneously and with rates and extents which
were only slightly dependent on the hydrocarbon molecular weight (Figure 2, Table 1). No GC-FID detectable
intermediates were observed in the culture medium and
this suggests that the depleted hydrocarbons underwent
mineralization. These findings are in substantial agreement with those already reported in the literature for
aerobic bacteria growing on complex mixtures of aliphatic hydrocarbons [30-32]. Slightly higher biodegradation
rates were observed in ENZ-G2 cultures, probably for
the G2 content of chemical additives with detergent
properties able to increase, as already hypothesized by
Di Toro et al. [16], the bioavailability and, in turn, the
biodegradation of G2 hydrocarbons. However, such a
finding might also be ascribed to the slightly higher biodiversity of ENZ-G2 consortium with respect to ENZG1 (Figure 3). Indeed, ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 display a
similar but not identical community structure. Both cultures include members of Bacteriodetes (Chryseobacterium taichungense), Gammaproteobacteria (Acinetobacter
baumannii, Psudomonas stutzeri and Stenotrophomonas
acidaminiphila), Betaproteobacteria (Alcaligenes sp.),
Actinomycetes (Gordonia amicalis) and Alphaproteobacteria; however, the latter group is represented by
Paracoccus versutus in ENZ-G1, and by Sphingopyxis

taejonensis in ENZ-G2 (Tables 2 and 3). With the
exception of the Alphaproteobacteria strains, all members of the two microbial consortia identified with cultivation-independent techniques could be isolated from
the same consortia and cultivated on mineral medium
with G1 or G2. On the contrary, Paracoccus and Sphingopyxis strains were never isolated in pure culture under
the same conditions probably because of their poor cultivability [33] or/and low occurrence in ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 consortia. Differently, the Gordonia strain isolated from both consortia was not detected via 16S
rRNA gene clone library and DGGE analysis, probably
because of the difficulties to brake up cells and obtain
DNA from Actinomycetes with the DNA extraction protocol employed in this study relying on freeze and thaw
cell lysis [34]. Several strains of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2
belong to bacterial species already reported in the literature for their ability to degrade aliphatic hydrocarbons.
Indeed, several Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes, and Gordonia strains have been
reported to grow on and/or degrade aliphatic and/or
aromatic hydrocarbons or to enrich in diesel- and oilysludge-contaminated soils [6,9,12,35-40]. However,
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 bacterial biodiversity is higher
than that displayed by any other hydrocarbon-degrading
mixed culture reported so far in literature. Further, to
our knowledge, this is the first study in which Paracoccus and Sphingopyxis strains are reported as members of
aliphatic hydrocarbon-biodegrading consortia. The composition of ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 did not change significantly after cryopreservation. However, importantly,

none of the bacterial isolates were able to stably and
remarkably grow on G1 or G2 hydrocarbons in liquid
cultures of MMM supplemented with G1 or G2 at 1 g l1
. This was quite surprising and can be ascribed to the
inability of isolates to singly face the toxicity of the complex hydrocarbons mixture occurring in diesel fuel [41].
Such an unexpected finding induced new investigations addressed to search for the occurrence of fungi in
the two consortia and fungal strains belonging to the
Trametes gibbosa species able to grow on G1 and G2
hydrocarbons in shaken cultures of MMM were
obtained from both ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2. This was a
quite surprising evidence as the enrichment procedure
adopted for obtaining the two consortia was specific for
bacteria, in terms of medium composition, mixing and
incubation conditions adopted, and one of the most
commonly applied for the selection of prominent hydrocarbon degrading mixed cultures described in the literature during the last two decades [22,42-45]. Several
fungi are known to have the capability of degrading persistent pollutants. The microbial degradation of hydrocarbons by ligninolytic fungi has been intensively
studied during the past few years [46] because they produce extracellular enzymes with very low substrate specificity, making them suitable for degradation of
different compounds. The genus Trametes is probably
the most actively investigated in the phylum of Basidiomycota for ligninolytic enzyme formation and use in a
wide range of analytical, industrial, and environmental
applications [47]. Trametes spp. are well known degraders of different organopollutants and T. gibbosa in particular has already been reported for its ability to
degrade different dyes [48].
The co-presence of bacteria and fungi appear essential
for the functionality of the consortium, as demonstrated
by our data and confirm what already stated by other
authors that showed that the mineralization of hydrocarbons in nature may require the combined efforts of both
fungi and bacteria [49].
Thus, ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 display an overall biodiversity higher than those of other diesel fuel mineralizing aerobic consortia already reported in the literature
and are the first ones consisting of stable consortium of
bacteria and the fungus Trametes gibbosa, and probably
for this ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 are the consortia with the
broadest specificity and highest biodegradation potential
among the diesel fuel biodegrading cultures reported so
far in the literature.

Conclusions
ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2 are two new aerobic microbial
consortia capable of rapidly and extensively degrading
linear paraffins from n-C10 to n-C24 of two different
commercial largely used diesel fuels under well defined

laboratory conditions and this thanks to their richness
of quite diverse microbes, such as bacteria and the fungus Trametes gibbosa. Their remarkable and reproducible biodegradation potential together with their
resistance to chryopreservation make ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 consortia very interesting candidates for
bioaugmentation operations on diesel fuels impacted
sites. Given their very similar composition and biodegradation activity both these mixed cultures are equally
promising in the bioaugmentation practice of soils contaminated by diesel fuels. Laboratory scale studies
addressed to test both cultures on actual site soils are
currently in progress. However, the main lesson learnt

in this study is that fungi can be enriched together with
bacteria through the enrichment procedures conventionally adopted for obtaining consortia of highly specialized
aerobic bacteria. Thus, the occurrence of fungi in mixed
bacterial cultures previously obtained with the same
procedure cannot be excluded.

by MARCOPOLO ENGINEERING S.p.A. (Italy) from
selected organic matter through a twenty-years culture
enrichment process (MPE Mesen Patented - No.
01286120) and was partially characterized through conventional and molecular procedures [25,28]. A 30% w/v
suspension of ENZYVEBA in sterile water was incubated at 37°C and 100 rpm for 24 hrs and used to
inoculate the first enrichment culture.
Solvents and chemical reagents were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich and Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) whereas the
components of media used for growing microorganisms,
i.e., mineral minimal medium (MMM), Tryptic Soy
Agar (TSA); and Malt Extract Agar (MEA) and glycerol,
were purchased from Biolife Italia (Milan, Italy). The
piperacillin/tazobactam combination and gentamicin
sulfate were purchased at pharmacies. Molecular biology
reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Milan, Italy).
Diesel fuels employed

Two different types of commercially available diesel
fuels taken from a Petroleum gas station, i.e. Diesel and
HiQ Diesel, herewith designated as G1 and G2 respectively, were employed as the sole source of carbon and
energy for enriching two distinct diesel fuel-degrading
microbial populations from ENZYVEBA.

Two parallel consortia of aerobic microbes able to grow
on G1 or G2 diesel hydrocarbons were enriched from
ENZYVEBA by using 1.0 l baffled Erlenmeyer flasks
equipped with Teflon-coated screw caps containing 0.3 l
of minimal mineral medium (MMM) amended with 20
mg l-1 yeast extract (as a source of vitamins) and 1 g l-1
G1 (or G2) as the main energy and carbon source. In a
first phase, 2 identical flasks, one with G1 and the other
with G2, were inoculated at 2% (v/v) with the water suspension of ENZYVEBA prepared as mentioned above
and incubated at 30°C and 150 rpm for 10 days. The
flasks were opened daily for 30 minutes to provide O2
by reducing hydrocarbons losses due to volatilization. At
the end of the 10-days incubation, each culture was
transferred at 2% v/v in a sterile flask containing, as
before, 0.3 l of MMM with 20 mg l-1 yeast extract and 1
g l -1 G1 (or G2) and incubated for 10 days under the
same conditions. Three other identical sequential transfers were performed of each of the two cultures, thus
obtaining, after 5 culture enrichment cycles, two microbial consortia capable of growing on G1 and G2 diesel
fuels, designated as ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, respectively.
To characterize the main microbial features of the two
consortia and assay their biodegradation potential, ENZG1 and ENZ-G2 were inoculated in duplicate into sterile MMM with their own diesel fuel and managed as follows. Seventeen 0.1 l baffled Erlenmeyer flasks,
containing 20.0 ml of MMM medium amended with 20
mg l-1 yeast extract and 1 g l-1 G1 or G2 were inoculated with ENZ-G1 or ENZ-G2, respectively, and incubated at 30°C and 150 rpm for 10 days. On days 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 and 10, two flasks per each enriched culture
were subjected to sampling (1.0 ml aliquot) for the analysis of total viable biomass concentration, and the
remaining culture broth was extracted for qualitative
and quantitative analysis of diesel fuel hydrocarbons. On
day 10, an additional flask of each grown mixed culture
was used for community DNA extraction and to prepare
culture stocks in glycerol (20% v/v in MMM medium)
that were frozen in liquid nitrogen and chryopreserved
at -20°C. Sixteen controls were also set up according to
the same procedure for ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, sterilized
after inoculation and used to measure possible abiotic

Zanaroli et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:10

losses of hydrocarbons all along the experiment. After a
six-month period of storage at -20°C, ENZ-G1 and
ENZ-G2 were re-inoculated in MMM amended with 20
mg l-1 yeast extract and 1 g l-1 of their own diesel fuel
and further sub-cultured for additional 3 cycles, as
described above, in order to remove glycerol traces from
the culture, and analyzed for hydrocarbon biodegradation and microbial community composition.
Bacterial isolates capable of growing on G1 and G2
were obtained from ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, respectively,
by growing the two cultures on TSA agar plates, toothpicking single colonies having different morphology and
transferring them into liquid MMM supplemented with
20 mg l -1 yeast extract and 1.0 g l -1 G1 or G2 as the
sole carbon and energy source. Each isolate was sub-cultured at least two times in the same medium under the
same conditions. Purity of isolates was verified by
streaking their liquid cultures on TSA plates. Isolates
were grouped into ARDRA (Amplified Ribosomal DNA
Restriction Analysis) Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs) and phylogenetically identified as described
below.
Fungi were also obtained from MEA agar plates supplemented with antibiotics (gentamicine 40 mg l-1 and
piperacilline plus tazobactam 100 mg l-1) and inoculated
with ENZ-G1 and ENZ-G2, respectively. The fungal isolates were characterized via genetic analysis as reported
below.
The ability of the bacterial isolates to grow on and
biodegrade the diesel fuel used for their selection was
studied by inoculating a cell suspension of each of them
prepared in MMM in duplicate MMM cultures with 20
mg l-1 yeast extract and 1 g l-1 G1 (or G2) incubated at
30°C and 150 rpm for 10 days according to the
approach adopted for quantifying the activity of ENZG1 and ENZ-G2 described above. To determine the diesel fuel biodegradation capability of fungal isolates, the
same approach was used with the following modifications. Twenty-two 0.1 l baffled Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 20.0 ml of MMM medium amended with 20 mg
l-1 yeast extract and 1 g l-1 G1 or G2, were inoculated
with a cell suspension of the fungal isolate prepared in
MMM and incubated at 30°C and 150 rpm for 20 days.
On days 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20, two flasks were used to
extract and analyse qualitatively and quantitatively diesel
fuel hydrocarbons. On days 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20, two
additional flasks were subjected to sampling of a 0.5 ml
aliquot for the analysis of ligninolitic enzyme activities
and the remaining culture broth was used for fungal
biomass dry weight determination. Killed controls were
also set up and sacrificed on days 0 and 20 to measure
possible abiotic losses of hydrocarbons.

Analytical procedures

G1 and G2 hydrocarbons were batch extracted from
MMM liquid cultures of both enriched and pure cultures with 1 volume of a mixture of hexane:acetone
(9:1) and sonication for 10 min. The qualitative and
quantitative analysis of G1 and G2 hydrocarbons occurring in the organic extracts were performed with a gas
chromatograph (5890 series II), equipped with a HP-5
capillary column (30 m by 0.25 mm) and a flame ionization detector (FID) (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto,
CA, USA). All runs were conducted under the following
conditions: initial temperature, 60°C; isothermal for 1
min; temperature rate, 10°C min -1 ; final temperature,
320°C; isothermal for 5 min. The injector (splitless
mode) was at 270°C, FID at 320°C; carrier gas (N2) flow
rate was 60 ml min-1 and the injected sample volume of
1 μl. GC peaks were characterized by injecting standards
of target n-paraffins under the same conditions. Quantitative analysis of G1 and G2 linear hydrocarbons as well
as of the overall G1 and G2 hydrocarbons was performed by running five-points linear calibrations of target n-paraffins (UltraScientific, N. Kingstown, RI, USA)
and of both diesel fuels in the concentration range of
50-1000 mg l -1 under the same analytical conditions.
The biodegradation of G1 and G2 hydrocarbons was
determined by performing duplicate analyses of the
organic extracts obtained from each culture sacrificed at
each sampling time and subtracting the abiotic losses
quantified in the parallel sterile controls.
The concentration of the total aerobic cultivable bacteria was determined through the colony counting technique on TSA plates. It was expressed as the mean of
colony forming units per ml counted on duplicate samples collected from the two duplicate flasks at each sampling time.
The fungal growth was evaluated as dried weight at
each sampling time when the biomasses were filtered on
filter paper (Whatman type 1), placed in an oven and
dried at a temperature of 65°C for 24 h; then they were
weighed and the dry weight of the fungal biomass was
calculated.
Laccase activity was assayed at 25°C using 2.2’-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as
substrate [50]. Mn- peroxidase and Mn-independent
peroxidase activities were measured at 25°C using
DMAB/MBTH [3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid/3-methyl2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride] as substrates [51]. Lignino-peroxidase activity was assayed at
35°C using veratryl alcohol as substrate [52]. All the
enzyme activities were expressed in International Units
(IU), where 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme
that oxidize 1 μmole of substrate in 1 minute.

Genomic DNA extraction from mixed and pure cultures
and bacterial and fungal gene amplification

Genomic DNA was extracted from the pellets resulting
from centrifugation of 2.0 ml active mixed and pure
bacterial cultures using a procedure modified from Kerkhof and Ward [53]. Cell pellets were suspended in 0.3
ml of a buffer solution containing 25 mM TRIS pH 8.0,
10 mM EDTA and 50 mM glucose. DNA extraction
consisted of 8 freeze and thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen/
water bath (37°C) followed by addition of 0.1 ml of the
same buffer solution containing 5 mg ml-1 of lysozyme
and of 50 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, and by incubation on a
rotary shaker at 37°C for 30 min. Fifty μl of 10% (w/v)
SDS were then added and samples were immediately
extracted twice with TRIS (pH 8.0) saturated phenol:
chlorophorm:isoamylalcol (25:24:1). The mixture was
vortexed vigorously to form an emulsion and centrifuged at 12500 × g for 3 min before removing the nonaqueous phase. DNA was then precipitated with 0.1
volumes sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.2 and 2 volumes
100% cold ethanol, pelleted at 12500 × g for 20 min and
washed twice with 0.25 ml 70% cold ethanol at 12500 ×
g for 10 min. DNA pellets were air dried and resuspended in 50 μl deionized water. 16S rRNA gene PCR
amplification was performed with a T-gradient Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Amplification
reaction mixtures contained 1 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM
MgCl 2 , a 0.2 mM concentration of each dNTP, a 0.4
mM concentration of each primer, 2.0 U of Taq polymerase, and 2.0 μl of template DNA in a final volume of
50 μl. The primers pairs used were 27f (5’-AGA GTT
TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3’) - 1495r (5’-GTT TAC
CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3’) [54] and GC-357f, containing a 40 bp GC-clamp, (5’-CGC CCG CCG CGC CCC
GCG CCC GGC CCG CCG CCC CCG CCC CCC
TAC GGG AGG CAG CAG-3’) - 907r (5’-CCG TCA
ATT CCT TTG AGT TT-3’) [55], depending on the following processing of the PCR-amplified product. Reaction mixtures were held at 94°C for 2 min, followed by
30 cycles of amplification at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30
s, and 72°C for 45 s and a final extension of 72°C for 10
min. Amplification products were analyzed in 1.0% (w/
v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
Genomic DNA of fungal isolates was extracted using
the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ITS region of
the nuclear ribosomal DNA (5.8S) was amplified using
the forward primer ITS1F (5’ CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA 3’) [56] and the reverse primer ITS4 (5’
TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC 3’) [57]. The PCR reactions were performed in 50 μl volume. The DNA concentration was 30 ng ml -1 . PCR took place under the
following conditions: 95°C for 5 min; 94°C for 45 sec,
56°C for 45 sec, 72°C for 45 sec (35 cycles); 72°C for 7

min. The reaction was then maintained at 4°C. The
resulting amplification products were analyzed by 1%
(w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.
16S rRNA genes clonal libraries

PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes obtained from genomic
DNA of mixed cultures with the primer pair 27F-1495r
were cloned in pCR®4-TOPO® cloning vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and the resulting plasmids were
inserted in chemically competent One Shot® TOP10 E.
coli cells (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transformed cells were plated
on LB agar plates containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin and
incubated overnight at 37°C. Fifty colonies from each
clonal library were tooth-picked and grown overnight in
liquid LB medium with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin. Library
screening used plasmid extraction, PCR amplification of
insert and digestion with the restriction enzyme AluI to
identify unique banding patterns. Plasmids extractions
used a modified alkaline lysis miniprep protocol [58].
PCR amplification of inserts was performed with primer
pair 27f-1495r as described above in a final volume of
25 μl. Restriction reaction mixtures contained 1 ×
REact® 1 buffer (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), approximately
0.5 μg of DNA and 2 U of AluI in a final volume of 20
μl. Restriction digestion was performed at 37°C for 6 hrs
followed by enzyme inactivation at 65°C for 10 min.
The restriction digests were separated in 2% (w/v) agarose gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. Amplified inserts bearing a
unique restriction banding pattern were sequenced with
primer 27f as described below.
DGGE analysis

PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes obtained from genomic
DNA of mixed cultures with the primer pair GC357f 907r were separated on the basis of their melting behaviour by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE). DGGE fingerprint was performed with a DCode apparatus (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) in a 7% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide-N, N’-methylenebisacrylamide, 37:1) in 1 × TAE with a denaturing gradient of
40% (top) to 55% (bottom) denaturant, where 100%
denaturant is 7 M urea and 40% (v/v) formamide. The
electrophoresis was run at 55 V for 16 hrs at 60°C. The
gel was stained in a solution of 1 × SYBR-Green in 1 ×
TAE for 30 min and its image captured in UV transillumination with a digital camera supported by a Gel Doc
apparatus (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). Bands were cut from
the gel with a sterile scalpel and DNA was eluted by
incubating the gel fragments for 16 hrs in 50 μl of sterile deionized water at 4°C. Two μl of the solution were
then used as template to re-amplify the band fragment
using the same primers without the GC-clamp (357f907r) and the same PCR conditions described above.

Competing interests
SDT, DT and AB received their salary from MARCOPOLO ENGINEERING Spa,
which also provided ENZYVEBA and partially financed the research. The
other authors declare that they have no competing interests.

16S rRNA genes of pure cultures amplified with the primer pair 27f - 1495r were digested with the restriction
enzyme AluI to identify unique restriction patterns as
described for the clonal library screening. The restriction digests were separated in 2% (w/v) agarose gels in
0.5 × TBE buffer and isolates were grouped into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) having unique restriction patterns. The PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene of one
representative of each OTU was sequenced with primer
27f as described below.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons was performed after purification with EXOSAP (USB Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, US) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing reactions and
runs were performed by BMR Genomics (Padova, Italy).
For each 16S rDNA sequence, the most closely related
sequence and the sequence of the most closely related
cultured bacterial strain were retrieved from the GenBank database by using MEGABLAST and from the
Ribosomal Database Project-II by using the SEQUENCE
MATCH tool. The sequences were aligned with the
CLUSTAL W program and phylogenetic trees were calculated with the neighbour-joining method. Bootstrap
values were determined from 1000 iterations. The fungal
ITS region was sequenced in both strands using the primers ITS1F and ITS4. Sequences were obtained with a
rapid (24 h) automated capillary electrophoresis system
CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter, USA). The ITS sequences
were compared to the GenBank (NCBI) database by
BlastN algorithm BLASTN 2.2.18+ (September-26-2008)
to identify the isolate or reveal the closest known
analogue.
