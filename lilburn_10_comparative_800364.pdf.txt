reveals the wide distribution of genes encoding
virulence-associated proteins

Abstract
Background: Species of the family Vibrionaceae are ubiquitous in marine environments. Several of these species are
important pathogens of humans and marine species. Evidence indicates that genetic exchange plays an important
role in the emergence of new pathogenic strains within this family. Data from the sequenced genomes of strains in this
family could show how the genes encoded by all these strains, known as the pangenome, are distributed. Information
about the core, accessory and panproteome of this family can show how, for example, genes encoding virulenceassociated proteins are distributed and help us understand how virulence emerges.
Results: We deduced the complete set of orthologs for eleven strains from this family. The core proteome consists of
1,882 orthologous groups, which is 28% of the 6,629 orthologous groups in this family. There were 4,411 accessory
orthologous groups (i.e., proteins that occurred in from 2 to 10 proteomes) and 5,584 unique proteins (encoded once
on only one of the eleven genomes). Proteins that have been associated with virulence in V. cholerae were widely
distributed across the eleven genomes, but the majority was found only on the genomes of the two V. cholerae strains
examined.
Conclusions: The proteomes are reflective of the differing evolutionary trajectories followed by different strains to
similar phenotypes. The composition of the proteomes supports the notion that genetic exchange among species of
the Vibrionaceae is widespread and that this exchange aids these species in adapting to their environments.
Background
Genomic comparisons among multiple strains of the
same species have revealed that the overlap in gene content of any two strains is not complete, that is, the
genomic resources of a species are not represented by the
genome sequence of a single strain. In 2005 Tettelin et al.
showed that the number of unique genes in seven
genome sequences from Streptococcus agalacticae, which
was termed the pangenome, far exceeded the number of
genes found in any one strain and that this pangenomic
repertoire would increase by at least 30 genes for every
new genome of this species that was sequenced. Furthermore, it appeared that this increase would go on indefi* Correspondence: tlilburn@atcc.org, jianying.gu@csi.cuny.edu,

nitely [1]. The "infinite genome" phenomenon was not
universal, for example, sequencing more than four
genomes of Bacillus anthracis does not add any more
genes to its pangenome. A terminology for classification
of the genes found on sets of related genomes has been
developed. As mentioned above the set of genes from all
the genomes is called the pangenome (and the set of all
encoded proteins is called the panproteome). The subset
of these genes that is found on all the genomes is called
the core genome and the set of genes that is found on
more than one but not all genomes is called the accessory
(or distributed) genome.
One of the original motivations for characterizing the
pangenome was to understand what constitutes a bacterial species, but the value of such studies extends to
understanding adaptation and evolution in the prokaryotes. Several studies have looked at pathogenic species
and their non-pathogenic relatives in an effort to discover, for example, which genes might be unique to the

pathogen and therefore drive pathogenesis (for example,
see [2-6]. Few studies have looked at non-pathogenic relatives that lie outside the genus of the pathogen. Here we
define a panproteome for the Vibrionaceae, a family containing several well-known human pathogens and species
that play important roles in the marine ecosystem as
nutrient cyclers, as partners in symbioses and as pathogens of fish and shellfish [7].
The most recent edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [8], divides the family Vibrionaceae into
three genera encompassing 51 species. Since the appearance of that volume, several species of Vibrio have been
moved into a new genus, Aliivibrio, and in 2006 Thompson and Swings estimated that the family included over
80 species [9]. This family provides a unique framework
for examining the emergence of pathogenesis and the
causes of virulence because of the combination of taxa it
contains. Genome sequences from this family represent
three species of human pathogen each with a different
modality of infection and clinical manifestation: Vibrio
cholerae, V. vulnificusand V. parahaemolyticus. Two of
the genomes are from strains of V. cholerae that are both
agents of pandemic cholera (strains O395 and N16961).
The biotype represented by N16961, El Tor, is a so-called
seventh pandemic strain. The El Tor biotype recently
supplanted the sixth pandemic strains (represented by
the classical biotype O395 strain) as the primary cause of
pandemic cholera. Two more genomes represent V. vulnificus (strains CMCP6 and YJ016). This organism causes
septicemia and the infections are rapidly fatal in persons
having high levels of iron in their serum. A fifth genome
represents V. parahaemolyticus, which causes gastroenteritis. Infection is usually associated with the ingestion
of raw or undercooked seafood. Three more genomes
represent strains pathogenic to marine organisms. V. harveyi has been identified as a pathogen of coral and shrimp
[10], V. splendidus is a pathogen of oysters, mussels and
scallops [11] and Aliivibrio salmonicida is the causative
agent of Hitra disease in salmonid species [12]. Marine
pathogens from the Vibrionaceae can have a serious
impact on aquaculture operations [7]. The remaining
three genomes are all non-pathogenic strains. Two
genomes represent A. fischeri (strains ES114 and MJ11), a
species that, like other Vibrionaceae, forms commensal
relationships with fish and squid [13]. ES114 was isolated
from squid, where it colonizes a specialized light organ,
while MJ11 was isolated from a fish [14]. Finally, the eleventh genome represents a species that is not known to be
either pathogenic or host-associated - Photobacterium
profundum strain SS9. This species is notable for its ability to thrive at high pressure [15].
Although notable for the characteristics mentioned in
the previous paragraph, many members of the Vibrionaceae can be isolated from more than one niche; often

Page 2 of 13

they are free-living as well as associated with one or more
hosts. For example, V. cholerae is free-living, but can form
biofilms on the exoskeletons of marine invertebrates such
as shrimp, or colonize the trophozoites of amoeba [7,16],
or, of course, it can survive and grow in the human intestine. Moving between these niches requires physiological
adaptability and it is clear that this adaptability involves
the sharing of genetic material among strains. For example, although V. cholerae is known as a disease-causing
bacterium, only about 0.6% of the V. cholerae strains that
can be detected in the environment are capable of producing the cholera toxin [17]. Similarly, a survey by Rahman et al. indicated that only a relatively small fraction of
V. cholerae strains in the environment have all the genes
needed for the pandemic strain phenotype, but relatively
large numbers of strains have some of the genes that drive
this phenotype [18]. For example, 79% of the environmental strains and all the clinical strains examined in
their study carried the hylA gene, which encodes hemolysin, an accessory virulence factor. One of the most common carbon sources in the marine environment, chitin,
also induces the uptake of extracellular DNA by V. cholerae, adding support to the notion that genetic exchange
is part of the adaptive strategy of the Vibrionaceae [19,20]
and Udden et al. have demonstrated the transfer of the
CTX phage genome from a non-toxigenic environmental
strain to an O1 El Tor strain in the presence of chitin [21].
Gene flow within the species V. cholerae was recently
examined by Chun et al. who found that the pangenome
contains 2,432 orthologs shared by all 23 V. cholerae
strains examined and 6,953 non-redundant genes in total
[22]. They identified 12 lineages and propose that horizontal gene transfer largely drives diversification. A
recent report indicating that a more virulent form of
cholera is emerging and is caused by a recombinant O1 El
Tor strain [23] underscores the need to explore the nature
of the genetic pool available to the Vibrionaceae beyond a
single species or genus. This knowledge will help us to
better understand how and perhaps when, such new
threats can arise. Here, we define and explore the panproteome of the family Vibrionaceae.
Within the context of the family-level panproteome, we
examine how virulence-associated proteins from V. cholerae N16961 are partitioned among members of the family. We find that many of the proteins are widely
distributed across the family, leading us to hypothesize
that members of this family represent a resource for the
genetic diversity of V. cholerae and the other pathogens.
We also find genes that are unique to V. cholerae and
examine their evolutionary history. Using these
approaches we can better understand the evolutionary
forces driving the emergence of pathogenic strains. On a
practical level, in order to control or eliminate pathogenic
strains, the genomic repertoire available to a species must

be defined so that any measures devised towards these
ends are effective against all the strains in a species [24].

Results and Discussion
The core, accessory, and panproteome of the Vibrionaceae

Previously, we generated a complete set of orthologous
proteins from the eleven strains of Vibrionaceae mentioned above [25]. In that study, we identified and evaluated instances of lineage-specific expansion within this
family. Here, we evaluate this set of orthologs in the context of the pangenome of the family in terms of the distribution and function of the orthologs. The pangenome
contained 49,588 protein coding sequences (CDS). 44,004
(88.7%) of the CDS fell into 6,629 orthologous groups (see
Additional file 1 Table S1). A strain-by-strain breakdown
of orthologous groups and CDS is given in Table 1. 1,882
of these orthologous groups were found in all 11 genomes
studied and thus constitute the core proteome of the family Vibrionaceae. The accessory proteome consisted of
4,411 orthologous groups. The set of strain-specific proteins included 5,584 unique CDS plus 336 orthologous
groups that each occurred in only a single genome. Overall, the panproteome consisted of 12,213 orthologous or
unique sequences. There are few studies of the core and
panproteomes of taxa at the genus or family levels. An
analysis of 26 strains from the genus Streptococcus
showed the core genome of this genus to be 611 orthologs

[26]. Although this seems to be a small number it actually
represents 26 to 36% of any one of the 26 genomes and
therefore quite consistent with our results. A study of the
core proteome of two families, the Bacillales and the
Enterobacteriaceae, used a method for identifying core
genome elements that incorporates genomic structure
(gene order) as well as gene conservation [27]. The Enterobacteriaceae core proteome was estimated at 2,125
orthologous groups, or from 43 to 88% of any one of the 6
genomes analyzed. The Enterobacteriaceae are closely
related to the Vibrionaceae but appear to have a more
conserved set of proteins. The more distantly related
Bacillales seem to have a more diverse set of proteins
encoded in the pangenome, but the number of genomes
included in this study may be too small to accurately estimate the true range of diversity in the two families. For
the Vibrionaceae, the percentage of CDSs in each genome
that was non-orthologous ranged from 5 to 21%. As each
of these non-orthologous proteins could represent a different function, it is likely that these proteins represent a
large part - 48.5% - of the functional diversity in the panproteome. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the
distribution of the orthologous groups among the 11
genomes. The largest group of orthologs is shared by all
11 genomes, but the potential functional diversity of the
unique strain-specific CDS is equal to the functional
diversity represented in the core proteome.

Figure 1 Frequency distribution of orthologous groups in the
eleven genomes examined. The grey bars represent orthologous
groups, while the white bar represents strain-unique proteins. 1,882 of
the 6,629 orthologous groups are found in each of the 11 genomes.
Only 336 of the orthologous groups are found in individual genomes.
In addition to the orthologous groups, the pangenome contains 5,584
proteins that occur only once in one of the genomes.

Functional classification of orthologous groups

The functions of the proteins in the 6,629 orthologous
groups were estimated by classifying them into COG
classes [28]. Figure 2 shows how orthologs in each class
are divided between the core and accessory proteomes.
Both core and accessory orthologs occasionally appear in
more than one COG class. Over 93% of the core
orthologs could be placed in COG classes. Some of these
COG classes are disproportionately represented in the
core proteome, including the so-called house-keeping
proteins in COG classes J (Translation and associated
functions), L (DNA replication, recombination and
repair), U (Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport), and O (Posttranslational modification,
protein turnover, chaperones), as well as proteins
involved in central metabolism like classes E (Amino acid
transport and metabolism), F (Nucleotide transport and
metabolism), H (Coenzyme metabolism), and I (Lipid
metabolism). The over-represented COG classes in the
core proteome comprise the functionalities essential to
the survival of the organisms.

Page 4 of 13

Of the accessory orthologs, less than 24% could be classified successfully. This is to be expected since members
of this set of proteins are taxon-specific and therefore
more likely to be little known. Relative to the core proteome, the accessory proteome was enriched for only one
COG class, T (Signal transduction mechanisms). Signal
transduction enables each strain to sense and adapt to its
environment. One class of such proteins, the methyl
accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), is known to be
over-represented in the proteomes of the Vibrionaceae.
The Microbial Signaling Database [29] contains information on 777 prokaryotes and the median number of
MCPs per strain is three; if we consider only the 485
prokaryotes that have at least one MCP, the median number per strain is 12; in the Vibrionaceae the number of
MCPs per genome ranges from 17 to 52.
We did not attempt to place the single copy CDS into
COG groups, and only one of the 336 orthologous groups
that were strain-specific could be placed in a COG class.
When the annotations for proteins unique to V. cholerae
N16961, which is the best studied of the strains in the
Vibrionaceae, were retrieved from NCBI, only about 5%
of the unique CDS had been placed in a COG class. The
functionalities of the 5,584 strain-specific CDS from the
other strains are likely to be equally obscure.
Distribution of orthologous groups across the eleven
genomes

Treating the presence or absence of an orthologous group
from the accessory proteome in the genome of each
strain as a binary character state and using these data as
input to the dollop program from PHYLIP [30], we
deduced the evolutionary relationships between the
strains. The results are shown in Figure 3. The tree is consistent with evolutionary trees estimated using various
conserved genes from the Vibrionaceae [31]. The distribution of the orthologous groups across the 11 proteomes, in the context of the V. cholerae proteome, is also
shown in Figure 3. By arranging the strains according to
their phylogeny, we can see the distribution of the
orthologs in an evolutionary context.
It is obvious from Figure 3 that the distribution pattern
of the orthologs does not always follow the path of vertical descent - clearly horizontal gene transfer has
occurred. Several surveys of the genetic make-up of environmental and clinical strains of V. cholerae have shown
that most of the genetic variability is found on genomic
islands (see, for example, [22,32]). Figure 3 highlights the
genomic islands, and the relative paucity of orthologs for
proteins found encoded on these islands underscores
their unusual nature; proteins encoded on the more "stable" regions of the large chromosome are more widely
distributed. Genomic islands VSP-I and VSP-II are the
Vibrio seventh pandemic regions and are found in the

serotype O1 El Tor strains like N16961, but not on the
sixth pandemic O1 strains like O395, although the insertion sites for the islands do exist on this strain. The
absence of these elements is evidence that the proteins
encoded on these elements are not required for the epidemic phenotype. Interestingly, all four of these genomic
islands can excise from the genome and form circular
intermediates [33,34]. Furthermore, the insertion site for
these genomic islands can be found on other species of
the Vibrionaceae [35]. The VSP-II insertion site, for
example, brackets a much larger genomic island found in
V. vulnificus YJ016 (where it is known as VVI-I, see Additional file 4 Figure S3) [36]. The VPI-1 insertion site,
which brackets genes relevant to TCP expression,
encloses completely different sets of genes in V. vulnificus
strains YJ016 and CMCP6, in V. parahaemolyticus strain
RIMD2210633, in A. fischeri E114 and in P. profundum
SS9 [35].
While in the large chromosome the genomic islands
appear to contain most of the genomic diversity, the small
chromosome is more uniformly mixed, as reflected by the
mosaic of colors. On this chromosome we observe that
the pattern expected from vertical descent, an ortholog
gradient from V. cholerae N16961 through to A. salmonicida, is more obvious, although the superintegron stands
out as a region of intense diversification.
Virulence-associated orthologous groups

We have published lists of virulence-associated genes and
candidate virulence associated genes from V. cholerae
N16961 [37]. We identified 526 virulence-associated pro-

teins in this strain from the literature and databases. A
further 463 proteins were identified as candidate virulence-associated proteins via a protein-protein association network analysis. As some of these proteins were
found in orthologous groups, the total number of unique
proteins and orthologs was 913; the distribution of this
set of virulence-associated proteins across the 11 Vibrionaceae genomes is visualized as a heat map in Figure 4.
As in Figure 3, arranging the orthologs according to the
sequence of one of the strains eliminates visualization
problems caused by genome rearrangements (synteny). It
is easy to score the presence or absence of all the virulence-associated orthologs from V. cholerae N16961 in
this way. One hundred and eighty-six of the virulenceassociated proteins are in the core proteome of the Vibrionaceae and 295 are in the accessory proteome. Only 22
proteins are unique to V. cholerae N16961. Among the
candidate virulence-associated proteins, 247 are in the
core proteome, 185 are in the accessory proteome and 23
are unique to V. cholerae N16961.
Aside from the recognized genomic islands marked in
Figure 4, we can recognize at least three other regions on
the large chromosome, marked A, B, and C, that encode
virulence proteins that are unique to V. cholerae. Regions
A and B are associated with cell-surface polysaccharides.
Region A (VC0245-VC0250) encodes gene products
required for the synthesis of the O-type antigens, which
give the two strains of V. cholerae their O1 serotype. Loss
of the ability to synthesize an O-antigen, for example, by
disruption of VC0249 (rfbL), has been shown to severely
impair V. cholerae's ability to establish an infection in

Vertical blue or yellow bars represent the presence or absence, respectively, of each orthologous group in each genome. Vertical black bars represent proteins that are unique to V. cholerae N16961. The orthologous groups are arranged according to the encoding gene order on the V. cholerae N16961 chromosomes. Previously characterized genomic
islands and the superintegron region are highlighted. The genomes are ordered top to bottom according to their phylogenetic relationships as shown

mice [38]. A search for homologs of the six region A proteins in the UniRef50 database [39], which clusters proteins on the basis of a sequence identity of 50% or greater,
revealed that for all six proteins the other members of
their respective clusters were all from other serotype O1
strains of V. cholerae and had a sequence identity of <
99%. A more extensive search in the IMG database [40]
showed that the best match homologs with less than 50%
identity were from outside the family Vibrionaceae.
Region B (VC0926-VC0933) includes proteins involved
in biofilm formation. Loci VC0926 and VC0927 are part
of the vpsI cluster (Vibrio polysaccharide synthesis) [41].
Loci VC0928 through VC0933 (also known as rmbA
through F [42]) are interposed between vpsI and a second
vps cluster, vpsII. Biofilm formation is a regulated
response to environmental conditions and the rmb genes
are all expressed when the vpsI and vpsII clusters are upregulated [43]. Deletion of any of them suppresses the
formation of the biofilms associated with vps gene

expression [42]. Expression of the Vibrio polysaccharide
(VPS) genes has been linked to increased survival of toxigenic strains challenged with chlorine (and is thus an
important trait for survival in municipal water supplies)
[44], changes in osmotic pressure and pH and oxidative
stress [41,45,46]. Furthermore, in vivo experiments have
linked the biofilm formation associated with the VPS
protein expression to virulence [47,48]. All of the most
similar orthologs to VC0926 and VC0927 are found in
various serotypes of V. cholerae; outside this species, the
genus Burkholderia has homologs with over 60% identity,
but there are no orthologs in any other Vibrionaceae.
Orthologs of VC0928 appear to be restricted to V. cholerae. Orthologs of VC0930, a putative hemolysin do not
occur in any other Vibrionaceae species, although some
strains of V. cholerae have more than one ortholog.
VC0931, VC0932 and VC0933 are confined to Vibrio species, but low-identity orthologs of VC0931 and VC0932
are seen in many genera. Like the O-antigen, the proteins

Figure 4 Distribution of virulence-associated orthologous groups across eleven Vibrionaceae genomes. The presentation is as in Figure 3, except the dendrogram is eliminated to save space and virulence-associated proteins (both unique and orthologous) are shown as vertical red bars. In
addition to the well-known genomic islands, three regions (A, B, and C) that were identified in this study and are discussed in the text are shown, along
with the Che Cluster II and III regions. These regions are marked Che II and Che III respectively. Che Cluster I is within region C.

encoded by vpsI and by the rbm genes appears to be
unique to V. cholerae, but not only in strains with the virulent, toxigenic phenotype. Thus, these proteins count
among the accessory virulence proteins and play a dual
role, as they also help V. cholerae survive outside the host.
Interestingly, the genes encoded on the vpsII cluster are
found in other members of the Vibrionaceae, including A.
fischeri, V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus. In the latter species, three of the vspII genes
(orthologs of VC0934, VC0936, and VC0937) are duplicated, a lineage specific expansion that we speculate was
mediated via horizontal gene transfer [25].
Region C (VC1394-VC1406) encloses one of three clusters of genes on the V. cholerae chromosomes that are
paradigmatically involved in chemotaxis. The clusters are
designated clusters I through III [49] and region C
includes the cluster I chemotaxis genes. Clusters II and
III are found on chromosomes 1 and 2 respectively (Figure 4). Only the proteins encoded in cluster II (VC2059VC2065) can be shown to be involved in chemotactic signaling in vitro [50,51]. Although the histidine kinase
(CheA-1) and response regulators (CheY-1 and CheY-2)
encoded in region C are homologous to the cognate pro-

teins in cluster II, they cannot complement cluster II
deletion mutants. CheY-1 and CheY-2 are each missing
amino acid residues involved in the interaction between
CheY and FliM [51,52]. FliM is part of the flagellar assembly and mediates a change in rotational direction of the
flagellum, which is important to chemotaxis. Phylogenetic analysis of the Che cluster I proteins shows that,
within the Vibrionaceae, they are exclusively found in V.
cholerae strains (Additional file 2 Figure S1). In addition,
with the exception of CheA, they are more similar to the
Che proteins encoded in cluster III than to those encoded
on cluster II. Gene neighborhood analysis using the IMG
resource [40] shows that the cluster I homologs always
group together on the large chromosome. Interestingly,
the four MCP homologs flanking the Che homologs in
region C are, like the CheY-1 and -2 homologs, unusual.
While 38 of the 45 the MCPs found in V. cholerae are
members of the 40H group, as classified by Alexander
and Zhulin [29,53], only one of the four MCPs in region C
is a member of this class. The two MCPs (the VC1394
and VC1403 orthologs) immediately flanking region C
each have unusual domain architectures. VC1394
orthologs are classified as Unaligned Membrane-bound

Lilburn et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/369

(UM) MCPs, indicating that they are membrane bound
but lack an identifiable sensory domain. UM MCPs are
found in many strains, but their function is not known.
VC1403 homologs are from group 44H and have two
MCP signal domains; there is only one 44H MCP in each
V. cholerae genome. The expression of the MCP encoded
by VC1403 appears to be enhanced under anaerobic conditions [54] similar to those found in the intestine. The
last protein in region C, VC1406, is a 24H MCP. This
group has no obvious methyl binding sites, sites that are
important for signal transduction. One possibility is that
this type of MCP modulates signal amplification within
MCP arrays. The unusual nature of the MCPs and Che
proteins found in region C hints at functions other than
chemosensing-driven motility. Their potential involvement in virulence is indicated by at least two studies. In
the first, transcription of genes in this region was shown
to be increased under conditions designed to induce
expression of virulence genes [55] and in the second
VC1397 and VC1399 were shown to be expressed in the
course of human infections [56].
Region C is part of a 168 kb cluster identified using MGCAT [57] (Additional file 3 Figure S2). Alignment of
this cluster using the MUSCLE algorithm [58] bundled
with M-GCAT showed that there was 99.5% identity
among the sequences from all the complete V. cholerae
genomes currently available. Region C is also conserved
in the draft V. cholerae genomes available through IMG.
Recently, Chun et al. identified the region spanning loci
VC1393 to VC1405 as a genomic island [22] and it largely
overlaps region C of Figure 4. Their analysis of the distribution of this region is consistent with ours. Like other
putative genomic islands, it does not partition among
strains of V. cholerae strictly according to pathogenicity.
Nonetheless, it is invariably present in seventh pandemic
strains and is in fact only absent from a single strain that
has a CTXphi region, that is, V51, a clinical isolate from
the United States. This supports the idea that the region
C orthologs have a role in epidemic virulence.
Functions of virulence-associated orthologs

The two V. cholerae strains share 319 orthologous groups
that are not found in the other strains. Only 62 of these
orthologs are classified as virulence proteins and most of
them are found in the regions marked in Figure 4. The
fact that so few putative virulence genes are unique to
these two strains testifies to the wide distribution of virulence-associated genes among the Vibrionaceae. Just over
one third of the shared virulence-associated orthologs
were placed in a COG functional group. COG classes T
and N are over-represented in this set. Of course, the
orthologs encoded in region C are members of these
COG classes and exemplify some of the signaling and
regulatory processes that are doubtless required for successful colonization of the human host. The high propor-

Page 8 of 13

tion of unclassified orthologous groups in the set of
virulence-associated orthologs unique to V. cholerae represents a pool of unrecognized functionalities that may
equip the species to survive and flourish in the environments it faces. For example, there are four hypothetical
proteins, loci VCA0881 through VCA0884 in strain
N16961, that appear to form an operon [59]. When a
search of the National Microbial Pathogens Data
Resource (NMPDR) was done, two of these proteins were
found to be annotated as non-hemolytic enterotoxin lytic
components. These proteins are found in other strains of
V. cholerae, but not in any other species of Vibrionaceae.
The most similar proteins outside this species are the
non-hemolytic enterotoxins encoded by some Bacillus
species, and are known to contribute to the pathogenic
effects of these species.
It is surprising that these two strains of V. cholerae do
not share more virulence proteins. One possible explanation is that their virulence, while employing the same
CTXphi and toxin co-regulated pilus genes, are built on
different underlying adaptations to human host-associated selective pressures. Both are O1 serotype strains, but
O395 is a Classical biotype strain (also known as a sixth
pandemic strain) while N16961 is an El Tor biotype strain
(also known as a seventh pandemic strain). The two
strains appear to have arisen independently. A recent
analysis by Feng et al. [60] suggests that the mutation rate
in Vibrio species is much higher than originally thought
and that the El Tor biotype acquired its capability to
become a pandemic strain independently of O395. The
adaptations that arose in N16961 on its evolutionary path
to virulence have allowed it to displace O395 as the causative agent of cholera around the world. A similar situation has been inferred in Escherichia coli, pathogenic
strains of which are thought to have arisen more than
once [3]. Thus the complete set of genes involved in the
cholera virulence phenotype may be quite different in the
two strains, with only a subset of the potential virulence
factors used in each strain.
Looking more widely at the Vibrionaceae we find there
are 943 orthologous groups that contain only proteins
from human pathogens (V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V.
parahaemolyticus) and 1,907 orthologous groups that
contain only proteins from pathogenic strains (the
human pathogens plus V. harveyi, V. splendidus and A.
salmonicida). It would be misleading to assess these
shared sets of genes in terms of virulence potential as
these species have different modalities of infection and
virulence. However, rearranging our core and accessory
set of orthologs in the context of, for example, the
genome of V. vulnificus YJ016 immediately reveals sets of
orthologs that are unique to the species.
Twelve genomic islands have been defined for V. vulnificus YJ016 and they are shown in Additional file 4 Figure S3 [35,36,61]. Orthologs to the proteins encoded on

Lilburn et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/369

these genomic islands exist on other strains (See Additional file 4 Figure S3), but, as discussed above, frequently
the insertion site containing a genomic island in V. vulnificus YJ016 will enclose a different set of genes in
another species. Regions VVI-I through VVI-IX meet the
canonical requirements for genomic islands as defined in
the literature [62] and six of them were found to be
unique to strain YJ016 [35]. The regions VVI-X through
VVI-XII are found in strains YJ016 and CMCP6, but not
in other species. These regions do not have all the features normally associated with genomic islands, but they
do seem to show a presence/absence pattern across
strains of V. vulnificus that indicates they are mobile. The
presence of region VVI-XII was found to correlate with
strains of V. vulnificus that were, or had the genetic
potential to be, clinical isolates [61]. Scanning Additional
file 4 Figure S3, we can see other regions containing
strings of orthologs unique to V. vulnificus. The orthologs
encoded on loci VV1999 to VV2015 (YJ016 loci numbering) and marked as region A in Additional file 4 Figure S3
are a good example. The orthologs in this region span
15.6 kb. They include VV2003 to VV2012. Experiments
examining the effect of changes in environmental concentrations of iron on transcription showed that these
loci were induced under iron-limiting conditions and that
they form an operon [63,64]. Miyamoto et al. also showed
that the Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein regulates the
expression of these genes. Iron availability is known to
play a major role in the virulence of V. vulnificus [65], but
Alice et al. were not able to link these genes to virulence.
Other experiments designed to elucidate the role of the
AphB regulatory protein in V. vulnificus showed that
AphB regulates the expression of the genes in region A,
along with many others. AphB mutants are less virulent
than wild-type strains [66], and show a reduced ability to
adhere to host cells. Interestingly, VV2003 to VV 2012
encode protein domains associated with the formation of
pili thought to be involved in adherence. With the exception of VV2007 (Flp pilus assembly protein TadA), the
encoded proteins do not have over 30% identity with
other proteins containing similar domains and may carry
out novel adherence functions associated with iron-poor
environments such as those usually found in human
serum. We feel these orthologs merit further investigation, as they are unique to V. vulnificus, and may contribute to functions that make this species one of the
deadliest food-borne pathogens known.

Conclusions
The panproteome of the Vibrionaceae consists of 12,213
unique groups. 1,882 (15%) of these groups form the core
proteome and 4,411 groups (36%) form the accessory
proteome. These numbers are consistent with those
reported for analyses of related groups at the species

[22,67] and family levels [27] and are similar to a genuslevel study from a more distantly related taxon [26]. This
rather high level of sequence conservation is reflected in
the conservation of so many virulence-related proteins
from V. cholerae across the Vibrionaceae. It has been
observed that the size (and potential size) of the panproteome, which is directly related to sequence diversity,
appears to correlate with the life-style of the bacterium
rather than with its taxonomic classification [68]. In the
species V. cholerae, Keymer et al. [67] have shown that the
non-homogenous marine environment drives the formation of diverse populations of V. cholerae strains, each
influenced by the environment in which it lives. Similarly,
V. splendidus has been shown to form distinct populations within different ecological niches in the marine
environment [69]. Hence, although apparent nichedriven generation of diversity may oppose it, many of the
genes associated with the virulence of V. cholerae are
widely distributed within the Vibrionaceae. This conservation may not be a response to the need to survive in the
human intestine, which many strain from this family
never see, but a sign that the virulence-associated proteins are fitness factors required by V. cholerae and other
Vibrionaceae to ensure their physiological flexibility. The
marine environment allows niche specialization and the
coexistence of a variety of genotypes, but it is also
dynamic, and the barriers to genetic exchange among the
genotypes are occasionally removed. V. cholerae can
exchange genetic material via phage-mediated mechanisms, conjugation and chitin-induced natural competence [19]. The latter mechanism does not require special
sequence elements or dedicated enzymology to achieve
integration of donor DNA, and much of the necessary
machinery is conserved not only with in the species V.
cholerae, but across the Vibrionaceae (see Additional file
1 Table S1). We observed above that some genomic
islands appear to move across the species boundary and
we believe that movement across the genus boundary
also occurs. High rates of genetic exchange can help species survive environmental challenges, as has been
observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae [70] and this
principle may operate for the Vibrionaceae, but presumably the high rates of recombination, which, in principle,
should lead to genomic homogenization, are balanced by
forces that ensure the species within the Vibrionaceae
remain distinct [71]. Interestingly, Stine et al. recently
showed that concurrent outbreaks of cholera in Bangladesh were caused by different genotypes of epidemic V.
cholerae [72]. This supports the idea that the gene pool
sustained by the Vibrionaceae aids in the emergence of
multiple epidemic strains when conditions are favorable.
Other species within the Vibrionaceae have their own
unique sets of proteins, which can contribute to the
pathogenic phenotype. Our approach facilitates the iden-

tification of such sets, highlighting proteins that, like the
signal transduction systems discussed above, may play
key roles in virulence.

Additional annotation for individual strains was
retrieved from the National Microbial Pathogen Data
Resource (NMPDR) [81] The UCSC Archaeal Genome
Browser [82] the Integrated Microbial Genomes system
[40] and from UniProt [83].
Identification of orthologous groups

The procedure is described in Gu et al. [25]. Open reading frames from the genome sequences were analyzed
using OrthoMCL [84] to detect and group the orthologous proteins in the 11 strains of Vibrionaceae.
OrthoMCL is a good choice for ortholog detection as it
has reasonably low false positive and false negative detection rates and can detect orthologs across a group of
genomes [85]. From the results we identified three sets of
proteins: (i) those that were encoded by all 11 strains, and
which we call the core proteome of the Vibrionaceae, (ii)
those encoded on two or more, but less than eleven of,
the genomes. We refer to these as the accessory proteome, and (iii) those that were encoded on only one
genome, which we refer to as the strain-unique proteome.
Together these three sets compose the panproteome of
the Vibrionaceae. A hierarchical functional classification
of the proteins that fell into OrthoMCL groups was performed by searching against the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups (COG) database [86].

Phylogenetic analysis

We scored the presence or absence of all orthologs in
each of the eleven genomes and used the accessory proteome to calculate the phylogenetic relationships among
the 11 strains using the program dollop from the PHYLIP
package [30]. Huson and Steel have demonstrated the
superiority of Dollo parsimony over distance-based
methods for the deduction of phylogenetic trees based on
gene content [87]. The tree was drawn using Dendroscope [88]. The presence and absence of each ortholog in
each genome was visualized using the R statistical package and the gplots library. Orthologs were ordered in the
plots according to their occurrence in the genome of
interest.
Phylogenetic analysis of the CheA, CheB, CheY and
CheZ orthologs of the V. cholerae proteins was done as
follows. First, the sequences of the orthologs were collected in fasta format from the UniProt database. Alignments were carried out using the L-INS-I method of the
MAFFT software, version 6.713 [89] and evaluated using
pfaat [90]. Maximum likelihood trees were inferred using
the Treefinder software [91]. The Whelan and Goldman
substitution model [92] was used.
