Abstract
Background: Hybridization events are relatively common in vascular plants. However, the frequency of
these events is unevenly distributed across the plant phylogeny. Plant families in which individual species
are pollinated by specific pollinator species are predicted to be less prone to hybridization than other
families. However, exceptions may occur within these families, when pollinators shift host-plant species.
Indeed, host shifts are expected to increase the rate of hybridization events. Pollinators of Ficus section
Galoglychia are suspected to have changed host repeatedly, based on several cases of incongruence
between plant phylogeny and taxonomy, and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. We tracked cyto-nuclear
discordance across section Galoglychia as evidence for hybridization. To achieve a proper global view, we
first clarified the monophyly of section Galoglychia as it had been questioned by recent phylogenetic studies.
Moreover, we investigated if fig size could be a factor facilitating host shifts.
Results: Phylogenetic chloroplast and nuclear results demonstrated the monophyly of section Galoglychia.
Within section Galoglychia, we detected several cases of statistically significant cyto-nuclear discordance.
Discordances concern both terminal nodes of the phylogenetic trees and one deep node defining
relationships between subsections. Because nuclear phylogeny is congruent with morphological taxonomy,
discordances were caused by the chloroplast phylogeny. Introgressive hybridization was the most likely
explanation for these discordances. We also detected that subsections pollinated by several wasp genera
had smaller figs and were pollinated by smaller wasps than subsections pollinated by a single wasp genus.
Conclusion: As hypothesized, we discovered evidences of past hybridization in Ficus section Galoglychia.
Further, introgression was only detected in subsections presenting incongruence between plant and
pollinator phylogenies and taxonomy. This supports the hypothesis that host shift is the cause for plantpollinator incongruence. Moreover, small fig size could facilitate host shifts. Eventually, this study
demonstrates that non-coding chloroplast markers are valuable to resolve deep nodes in Ficus phylogeny.

Background
Frequent natural hybridization events in vascular plants
were documented by early biologists (e.g. [1,2]). However, the prevalence of hybridization events is unevenly
distributed across the plant phylogeny and seems to be
concentrated within a small fraction of families and genera [3]. Grant [4] pointed out that the frequency of natural
hybridizations varies with factors such as life history,
breeding system, environmental disturbance, genetic predisposition, and eventually pollination syndrome. In this
context, plant species pollinated by specific pollinator
species are predicted to present almost no hybridization
events. Indeed, in specific mutualisms as plant-pollinator
associations, the associated species usually present coadaptations involved in attraction, recognition and physical compatibility with the other species. Such adaptations
can be viewed as pre-zygotic barriers limiting interspecific
hybridization [5-7].
Host shift is one of the main ecological processes that can
break patterns of strict cospeciation between tightly
bound interacting species [8-11], as observed in some
cases affecting postulated strict co-evolutionary pattern in
specific pollination mutualisms [12]. When associated
with a transitional use of two hosts by the pollinator, a
host shift may allow plant hybridization and hence leave
a signature of genetic introgression in the plant genome.
Following such hybridization, recurrent backcrosses of
offspring with one parent may also allow the introgression of a limited set of foreign alleles into a plant species
[13]. Hence, plant lineages in which pollinators have
jumped from one host to another are more likely to
exhibit signs of introgression than other lineages.
Detecting past events of host shifts requires tracking
incongruence between phylogenetic trees of interacting
taxa [8,14,15]. However, pollinator species duplication in
the absence of host speciation, followed by cospeciation
and subsequent asymmetric extinction, a phenomenon
we will call duplication/extinction hereafter, is another
mechanism that can cause incongruence between host
phylogeny and partner phylogeny [16]. Although different in essence, these phenomena lead to similar patterns
of phylogenetic incongruence, and discriminating
between them is often largely speculative [17]. Nevertheless, and contrary to host shift, duplication/extinction
does not involve plant hybridization. Consequently,
detecting introgressed genes in a plant lineage for which
there is incongruence between plant and pollinator phylogenies would support the host shift hypothesis.
Fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps
(Agaonidae, Chalcidoidae) constitute one of the wellknown cases of species-specific pollination mutualism. In
this system, the rule is that a wasp species generally polli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

nates a single host species [18,19]. Further Ficus and Agaonid wasp morphological taxonomy and molecular
phylogenies are steadily improving, providing a unique
set of information to infer past history of the association
on a broad set of species. Based on phylogenetic data, several authors have suggested parallel diversification of host
and associated pollinating wasps [5,20-23]. Moreover, fig
tree sections or subsections appear to be generally monophyletic and pollinated by a single wasp genus or by a few
genera. Nevertheless, exceptions to the rule of a single
agaonid wasp species associated with a single Ficus species
are quite frequent and rather well documented based on
morphology [24,25] as well as on molecular methods
[12,26-28]. Indeed, Rasplus et al. [29] estimated for
Africa, on the basis of morphology, that 17% of fig species
were pollinated by more than one wasp species and that
15% of fig pollinator wasps used two or more hosts. However, molecular data on Australian pollinators suggest that
when two or more wasps pollinate the same host they
seem to often be sister species [30].
Within this general context, species of section Galoglychia
show an unusual pattern of association with their pollinating wasps within genus Ficus. The 77 described species
of section Galoglychia are distributed into six subsections
[18,31], several of which are unambiguously defined.
Seven morphologically unambiguous genera of fig wasps
are known to pollinate section Galoglychia (Figure 1).
Some genera are both subsection specific and the sole pollinators of the subsection. Other genera pollinate fig trees
from different subsections and some subsections are pollinated by several wasp genera. Further some individual
Ficus species may be pollinated by wasps belonging to different genera (e.g. Ficus natalensis pollinated by Alfonsiella
and Elisabethiella) and one wasp species may pollinate several Ficus species (e.g. Elisabethiella stuckenbergii pollinates
F. burkei, F. natalensis, F. petersii and F. lingua depauperata
[32]).
Recent molecular phylogenies supported, with some caveats, the monophyly of subsections within section Galoglychia [33] and that of wasp genera [26]. Hence the
interactions between figs of section Galoglychia and their
pollinating wasps present us with a series of instances of
lack of strict specificity, and lack of congruence between
fine wasp and Ficus taxonomy and phylogeny [18,34].
Comparing the phylogenies of trees and insects suggests
additional lack of congruence, with respect to the order of
branching of Ficus subsections and wasp genera (Figure
1). In the plant phylogeny [33], based on ITS and ETS
nuclear markers, subsections Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae are grouped with subsections Galoglychia and Caulocarpae within a clade, while the remaining subsections are
clustered together into a second clade. In the wasp pollinator phylogeny [26], based on 28S and ITS markers, sub-

section Galoglychia
pollinators and Caulocarpae
pollinators constitute the outgroups of a clade including
the pollinators of the remaining subsections. Fig tree phylogeny is thus incongruent with pollinating wasp phylogeny with respect to the branching of subsections
Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae versus Chlamydodorae and
their pollinators. An additional finding of the molecular
phylogeny of section Galoglychia is a suggestion that neotropical species of section Americana could be enclosed
within section Galoglychia, although this result was only
weakly supported by the various node validation methods
[33]. If section Galoglychia is really paraphyletic to section
Americana, pollinators of this last section could provide an
example, pending phylogenetic and taxonomic re-evaluation, of discrepancy between the phylogenetic histories of
Ficus and their pollinating wasps as the pollinators of section Americana and of section Galoglychia have been classified into different subfamilies (Agaoninae and
Blastophaginae) [19].
Incongruence between pollinator and host phylogenies
has been traditionally attributed to host shifts [12,35].
However, ancient pollinator species duplication events
could also have lead to different wasp pollinator genera
pollinating the same host figs. Subsequent cospeciation
and asymmetric extinction could be responsible of the
apparently haphazard host association exhibited by Alfonsiella and Elisabethiella pollinators [26,36].

The goal of this contribution is to study introgression
events in the phylogeny of section Galoglychia. If host
shifts and not duplications/extinctions are effectively
responsible for plant-pollinator taxonomic and phylogenetic incongruence, then we expect to detect introgression
events, especially in the plant lineages implied in this
incongruence. We compared nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies to detect cases of genetic introgression between
Ficus species, because the chloroplast genome of vascular
plants possesses several features that facilitate its introgression into a new plant species after hybridization compared to the nuclear genome [13,37,38], as illustrated by
the numerous cases of chloroplast introgression documented in the literature [37,39,40]. Our working hypothesis is that the current complex pattern of host association
of genera Elisabethiella, Nigeriella and Alfonsiella result
from host shifts. The prediction is that we may detect evidence for cytoplasm transfer between species of subsection Chlamydodorae, Platyphyllae and Crassicostae. We will
also search for other potential cases of genetic introgression and especially for subsection Cyathistipulae for which
available data suggests mismatch between the phylogenetic position of the subsection [33] and the phylogenetic
position of its pollinators, namely genus Agaon [26]. To
do so, we first developed specific chloroplast markers for
Ficus and sequenced them in 58 individuals representing
38 species of section Galoglychia and 10 species of section
Americana. We also sequenced ITS and ETS markers on
these same individuals. Second, we searched for cases of
discordance between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies

and tested their significance. Third, we showed that
genetic introgression was the most likely mechanism to
explain the cases of discordance. Besides, because section
Galoglychia is the sole Ficus section subdivided into six
subsections all of which are well defined (pending revision of the taxonomic position of some species assigned
to subsection Platyphyllae, see discussion) and the sole section pollinated by six monophyletic agaonid wasp genera,
this section offers a unique opportunity to investigate host
shifts and their determinants. Within the section, known
and suspected examples of pollinators using several hosts
seem to involve host species presenting rather small figs,
such as F. burkei, F. natalensis, F. petersii and F. lingua depauperata [32]. Therefore we investigated whether the fig
subsections involved effectively presented small figs and
whether their pollinator genera presented small body size.

Results
Data set partitioning
Chloroplast marker development allowed producing
fourteen pairs of primer specifically developed for Ficus
(see Additional file 1). Five of them - atpB-rbcL, FcB, FcJ,
FcL and trnL-trnF - were selected for this analysis based on
the phylogenetic information provided by a subsample of
the final data set used in this study. The final combined
chloroplast matrix contained 58 accessions and 3,604
base pairs (see Additional file 2; TreeBASE accession
number: SN4278). One hundred and twenty-two sites
were variable and 52 (1.5%) were potentially parsimony
informative. The model of sequence evolution varied
across chloroplast partitions (Table 1). We used arithmetic mean -lnL of Bayesian posterior topologies to measure
the ability of data partitioning to explain the entire data
set. The analysis separating non-coding and coding
regions (strategy S3) of the chloroplast data set returned a
decisively better description of the data than the other two
analyses according to Bayes factors (Table 2).

The combined ITS and ETS matrix contained 1,320 base
pairs of which 348 were variable and 158 (12%) were
potentially parsimony informative. The model of
sequence evolution differed between the ITS and ETS partitions (Table 1). The strategy individualizing each of
these partitions (S5) was decisively better than the strategy
combining the entire nuclear data set (S4) (Table 2). In the
following we will only present the results obtained using
the best strategy for each data set.
Chloroplast phylogeny of section Galoglychia
The combined chloroplast matrix produced twelve most
parsimonious trees of length 141. Consistency and Retention Indexes (CI = 0.88; RI = 0.93) suggested the presence
of a single island of trees [41]. The strict consensus of all
most parsimonious trees (SCMP) is shown in Figure 2A
with bootstrap percentages (MP_BS). The two different
runs during the BI analysis with partitioning strategy S3
reached model parameter convergence and generated a
similar tree. This tree is shown in Figure 3 with the posterior probabilities (PP) indicated for each node. ML analysis produced one most likely tree (-lnL = 5960.04; not
shown), slightly less well resolved than the Bayesian tree.
Bootstrap percentages (ML_BS) are indicated over the
Bayesian tree in Figure 3.

The SCMP tree, the ML and the Bayesian trees were all
similar in their overall topology. The monophyly of secTable 2: Arithmetic mean -LnL for each partition strategy (Si)
and 2ln Bayes factors results of comparisons between the
strategies with the highest likelihood and alternative strategies.

tion Americana was strongly supported (91;89;1 for
%MP_BS, %ML_BS and PP respectively; node supports are
given in a similar order in the following) and formed a sister clade to section Galoglychia which was monophyletic
(88;92;1). Subsections Galoglychia and Caulocarpae constituted monophyletic groups (80;90;1 and 86;93;1, respectively) and were basal within section Galoglychia. A third
well supported clade was composed by species belonging
to subsections Cyathistipulae, Crassicostae, Chlamydodorae
and Platyphyllae (94;96;1; CCCP clade hereafter). However and contrary to the previous subsections, clade subsections did not form monophyletic groups within the
CCCP. For example, the two accessions of F. trichopoda
branched within distinct clades, as did the two accessions

of F. craterostoma, and F. densistipulata (subsection Cyathistipulae) branched within a clade only composed of taxa of
subsection Chlamydodorae.
One hundred and four distinct gaps were coded for the
chloroplast data set. Five insertions and eight deletions
were synapomorphic (Figure 3; see Additional file 3). A 10
bp insertion (chloroplast indel n°4) supported the monophyly of section Galoglychia since it was found neither in
the outgroup nor in section Americana. A 7 bp deletion
(n°6) supported the CCCP clade.

Figure 3(left) and chloroplast (right) phylogenetic trees obtained with the Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses
ITS+ETS
ITS+ETS (left) and chloroplast (right) phylogenetic trees obtained with the Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses.
Values above and under branches indicate posterior probability of BI and bootstrap support performed with the Maximum
Likelihood analysis, respectively. Synapomorphic indels of each data set are mapped and numbered onto the corresponding
tree (details about indels are given in Additional file 3). Genera of wasps known to pollinate a subsection are indicated between
brackets.

Nuclear phylogeny of section Galoglychia
The combined nuclear matrix produced 15,000 most parsimony informative trees of length 521 (RI = 0.84; CI =
0.75). The SCMP of all 15,000 trees is shown in Figure 2B.
Figure 3 illustrates the unique Bayesian tree produced by
the two different runs during the analysis and using the S5
partitioning strategy. Only one most likely tree (-lnL =
5150.78; not shown) was produced by the ML analysis. As
with the chloroplast data, it differed from the Bayesian
tree only in being slightly less resolved.

Here again, the SCMP, the ML and the Bayesian trees were
all similar in their overall topology. A basal trichotomy
divided the ingroup into three clades. The first one was the
strongly supported section Americana (91;99;1). The second grouped subsection Chlamydodorae and part of subsection Platyphyllae (Clade A). Although it was not
strongly supported by bootstraps (55;55), this clade was
found in the 15,000 most parsimonious trees, and had a
Bayesian posterior probability of one. The third clade
grouped accessions from subsections Caulocarpae, Galoglychia, Cyathistipulae, Crassicostae and part of Platyphyllae

(Clade B). It was not strongly supported by the bootstrap
distribution (71;72) but it was present in every most parsimonious trees and is maximally supported by the BI
analysis.
Sixty five indels were coded for the nuclear data set and 10
of them were synapomorphic (Figure 3; see Additional file
3). The ingroup is supported by one deletion and one
insertion. Inside the ingroup, all accessions of section
Americana presented a 3 bp deletion in their ETS sequence
while all accessions of section Galoglychia shared a one
base pair insertion in the ITS sequence.
Investigation of the cyto-nuclear discordance
While different phylogenetic reconstruction methods gave
rise to similar topologies for a given data set, chloroplast
and nuclear phylogenies appeared discordant for several
internal and external nodes. Templeton tests applied to
MP trees, and SH tests to ML trees always returned congruent results (Table 3). Both SCMP and ML trees explained
significantly better the data set used to reconstruct these
trees than the rival data set, demonstrating the overall dis-

cordance between nuclear and chloroplast topologies. We
then tested the significance of local discordances involving F. trichopoda, F. craterostoma and F. densistipulata accessions. The original chloroplast topology in which both
accessions of F. trichopoda are paraphyletic explained significantly better the chloroplast data than a modified
topology in which these accessions were branched to form
a monophyletic relationship. The same was true with the
F. craterostoma chloroplast accessions. However, the original chloroplast topology was not significantly better than
the topology in which F. densistipulata was branched with
other Cyathistipulae taxa to make this subsection monophyletic. Alternatively, modifying the nuclear topology to
branch one of the two F. trichopoda and one of the two F.
craterostoma accessions with Chlamydodorae and with Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae accessions respectively, as in
the chloroplast topology, produced significantly worse
topologies than the unmodified nuclear topologies for the
nuclear dataset. The same was true when F. densistipulata
was branched with the Chlamydodorae species as in the
chloroplast topology. For these last tests, it was possible to
artificially reconstruct several alternative topologies. Table
3 gives results only for possibilities giving the highest Pvalue.
Besides the terminal cases of discordance tested above, a
cyto-nuclear discordance was generated by the branching

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

of subsections Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae. To avoid
interference due to cases of terminal discordance, we
tested the significance of this deep discordance by comparing topologies differing only by the branching of these
two subsections (Table 3). Therefore, branching was left
unresolved (i.e. with a polytomy) inside subsections
Galoglychia and Caulocarpae for the chloroplast topology,
and inside the CCCP clade, Clade A and Clade B (see Figure 3). Both Templeton and SH tests showed that the position of subsections Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae
obtained in trees reconstructed using one data set (nuclear
or cytoplasmic) produced a significantly better topology
than the rival topology for that set of data.
The Bayesian approach used to statistically evaluate discordances gave similar results (not shown). For each Bayesian analysis, we did not find any branching supporting a
rival phylogenetic hypothesis in any tree of the 95% credible set sampled once stationarity was reached. The sole
exception was constituted by F. densistipulata in the chloroplast data set analysis, which branched with other Cyatistipulae species in 17% of the trees of the 95% credible set.
To check that apparent cyto-nuclear incongruence was not
an artefact due to saturation by mutations, we plotted the
estimated number of transitions and transversions against
the TN93 [42] genetic distances (see Additional file 4). For

all three analyses, transitions outnumber transversions
indicating that substitutions are not saturated in the three
types of data (chloroplast, ETS and ITS). Finally, considering ITS plus ETS as a single nuclear unit, a scenario based
on gene duplication without genetic introgression and
explaining the deep node discordance between nuclear
and cytoplasmic phylogenies requires one duplication
event at the base of section Galoglychia followed by three
extinction events, each at the base of a group of subsections (Figure 4).
Fig and pollinator size
We investigated if fig and pollinator size were morphological traits associated at the subsection/genus level with
plant-pollinator phylogenetic incongruence. Indeed,
because of the as yet limited number of documented cases
of incongruence, we limited our investigation to crude
comparisons. Dry fig diameter of species belonging to section Galoglychia was distributed into two size categories
(Figure 5A). Species belonging to subsections pollinated
by a single pollinator genus (subsections Cyathistipulae,
Caulocarpae and Galoglychia) presented significantly larger
figs than species belonging to sections pollinated by at
least two pollinator genera (t = 7.63; p < 10-3; not cor-

rected for phylogenetic correlations). Similarly, body
length of pollinating wasps was distributed into two size
categories (Figure 5B): wasp genera that pollinated fig
trees from a single subsection (i.e. Agaon, Paragaon, Courtella and Allotriozon) were significantly larger than genera
pollinating several plant subsections (t = 7.43; p < 10-3;
not corrected for phylogenetic correlations). Graphically,
genus Paragaon presented small-sized wasps and therefore
escapes this pattern. However, this genus includes only
two species and for only one of them is the host known.
Wasp size in this genus is thus little informative.

Discussion
The monophyly of section Galoglychia
Rønsted et al. [33] did not demonstrate the monophyly of
the African section Galoglychia. Based on ITS+ETS data,
they suggested that section Galoglychia might be paraphyletic to the American section Americana, although this
result was ambiguously supported. With our ITS+ETS data
set, all three types of analysis (MP, ML and BI) also failed
to resolve the placement of section Americana relative to
section Galoglychia, although a 3 bp deletion in the ETS
sequence characterises section Americana and a 1 bp insertion in the ITS sequence characterises section Galoglychia.
However, the chloroplast phylogeny provides strong support for the monophyly of section Galoglychia with each of
the three methods. Moreover, a 10 bp insertion and a 1 bp
deletion in fragment FcL characterise species of section
Americana and a 10 bp insertion in the same gene characterises species of section Galoglychia. Hence the phylogeny
based on chloroplast data enables to resolve the trifurcation of the phylogeny based on ITS+ETS data and the
result is further supported by insertion-deletion data
which were not taken into account in the phylogenetic
reconstructions. Eventually, our chloroplast data set provided less information on terminal nodes, but offered better resolution for deeper nodes. Because chloroplast genes
overall evolve more slowly than nuclear genes do [43],
they are less prone to homoplasy and are therefore usually
recommended for deep phylogenies [44-46].

Morphologically, sections Galoglychia and Americana
share the presence of two bracts subtending the figs as
opposed to generally three in genus Ficus. Section Galoglychia is characterised by all the bracts of the ostiole (the
passage leading into the fig) turned inward, the orifice of
the ostiole forming a bilabiate slit. In section Americana,
the bracts of the ostiole are imbricate so that generally
three bracts are visible as closing the ostiole. The monophyly of section Galoglychia, as recognized by botanists
since the major revision of African figs ([47]; recognized
as subgenus Bibracteatae at that time), is hence most probably correct.

The infrasectional classification of section Galoglychia
The nuclear phylogeny proposes the division of section
Galoglychia into two clades that do not include the same
subsections as the two clades evidenced by the chloroplast
analyses. Although the two nuclear clades are weakly supported (as previously observed by Rønsted et al. [33], several features suggest that this phylogeny is reliable. First,

the alternative topology suggested by the chloroplast data
set was demonstrated to be significantly less likely than
the nuclear topology. Second, although 35% of our taxa
were different from those used by Rønsted et al., we found
a similar topology with similar values of bootstrap supports. It is thus unlikely that the sampling composition
(which covers half of the species of section Galoglychia)
biased the phylogenetic reconstruction. Third, the position of most species remains consistent with classical taxonomy [18]. A pattern seems to appear in the taxonomic
modifications revealed by molecular phylogenies in Ficus,
suggesting that they do not result from identification/
manipulation errors or from limiting phylogenetic information. Indeed, within subsection Platyphyllae, F. platyphylla and F. jansii both present clusters of small figs at the
axils of the leaves or just below, a trait they share with a
number of species of subsection Crassicostae, with which
they are grouped in the phylogenetic tree. Conversely, F.
glumosa and F. stuhlmannii only present two figs at the
axils of the leaves and are grouped with species from subsection Chlamydodorae, which all have figs in pairs at the
axils of the leaves. Preliminary data on some other species
of subsection Platyphyllae seem to support this splitting of
the species into two different units, mainly according to
this trait. Fourth, a potential source of error using ITS and
ETS could be the amplification of paralogous copies of ITS
and ETS leading to an incorrect phylogenetic reconstruction [48-50]. However, here again, the monophyly of each
subsection is hardly compatible with the amplification of
paralogous copies of ITS and ETS that generally evolve
independently [51]. Four events of extinction following
the duplication would have to be hypothesised to obtain
an observed nuclear topology corresponding to the chloroplast topology (Figure 4). Although this number of
duplication-extinctions can reasonably occur given the
considered time lapse [39], these four events would have
had to occur in the ancestor of each of the four extant subsections and not within the subsections, a pattern which
is unlikely. Last, the separation of section Galoglychia into
two nuclear clades is supported by ecological and biogeographical arguments [33]. All these lines of evidence lead
us to conclude that subsections Galoglychia, Cyathistipulae,
Crassicostae, Caulocarpae and part of Platyphyllae on one
hand, and subsection Chlamydodorae and part of Platyphyllae on the other hand, form two monophyletic clusters.
A discordant chloroplast topology
Our investigation of the overall discordance between the
chloroplast and the nuclear topology revealed two types
of discordances occurring at two taxonomic levels. The
first type concerns phylogenetic relationships between
subsections: subsections Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae
branch with subsections Chlamydodorae and Platyphyllae in
the chloroplast topology, and with subsections Galoglychia and Caulocarpae in the nuclear topology. As high-

Page 9 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:248

lighted above, the nuclear topology is consistent with
morphological and biogeographical data. We can thus
confidently assume that it is the chloroplast and not the
nuclear topology that is discordant with the species tree.
The second type of discordance concerns the monophyly
of subsections: Chlamydodorae and Platyphyllae are paraphyletic in the chloroplast phylogeny (at least for F. craterostoma and F. trichopoda), and monophyletic in the
nuclear phylogeny. The monophyly of subsections found
in the nuclear tree is consistent with the morphological
traits that led botanists to recognize these subsections for
a century [47], meaning that here again, the nuclear but
not the chloroplast phylogeny is more likely to reflect the
species tree.
Examples of cyto-nuclear discordance are rather common
in plants [52-57] and a limited number of causes leading
to such discordances has been identified. Discordance
between cytoplasmic and nuclear phylogenetic trees may
either be artefactual or evidence distinct evolutionary histories followed by cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes [39].
Long Branch Attraction (LBA hereafter; [58]) is a source of
artefact that may generate cyto-nuclear discordance
[59,60]. Several arguments allow us to exclude LBA artefacts for our data set. First, the branches leading to discordance are not the longest branches of the tree, while
some longer branches do not have unexpected positions
in the tree. Further, the molecular data sets are not saturated which means that our markers did not evolve rapidly enough for phylogenetic signals to be lost. Finally, the
discordance was the same whatever the phylogenetic
reconstruction method employed. Although methodological concordance does not rule out LBA [61], parsimony
has a stronger bias towards grouping long branches
together than ML and BI which take into account unequal
rates or branch lengths [62,63]. It is therefore unlikely that
the observed cases of discordance resulted from LBA.
The cyto-nuclear discordance has therefore to be
explained in terms of difference between species and chloroplast history. Two mechanisms may be involved:
incomplete chloroplast lineage sorting and introgression.
Differentiating between hypotheses of introgression and
lineage sorting is difficult because both processes can generate very similar phylogenetic patterns [64]. Ancestral
polymorphism is expected to be completely sorted out
with a high probability approximately 4Ne generations
(Ne = effective population size) after the separation [65].
The branch supporting the CCCP clade (BL = 0.1774) is
longer than the branch supporting clades in which reciprocal monophyly has been reached, like the Caulocarpae
clade (BL = 0.1699), the Galoglychia clade (BL = 0.1269)
and section Americana (BL = 0.1756). Hence, this branch
is expected to be long enough to have allowed chloroplast
genes to reach reciprocal monophyly as well and hence to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

complete allele sorting. However, the sorting depends on
Ne and not on branch length directly. Therefore, any variation in Ne over time and across species would alter conclusions based on relative branch length comparison.
Methods based on coalescent simulations to calculate the
probability of observing lineage sorting are also based on
Ne remaining constant over time and among species [66]
and both hypotheses are not realistic when comparing
savannah and forest lineages over longer periods of time.
Moreover, they require estimating ancestral population
sizes that can only be obtained by intensive intraspecific
sampling and this is not compatible with the phylogenetic
approach used here. Eventually, these methods require
generation time to be known and do not allow this
parameter to vary across the phylogeny. Ficus lineages
included in our phylogeny are highly different in term of
height and life forms, with some lineages represented
mainly by canopy emergent trees (e.g. subsection Caulocarpae) and other mainly by small shrubs and trees in
open habitats (e.g., subsection Chlamydodorae). Because
the generation time is known to vary with life form and
height in trees [67], substantial variation in the generation
time across the Galoglychia phylogeny would generate
strong uncertainty for results based on coalescent methods. In conclusion, because of too many uncertainties in
the inputs required for more subtle models, we assess that
the method based on relative branch lengths, although
not optimal, is appropriate to discuss lineage sorting with
the current data set. Although we are not able to fully
exclude it, the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis thus
does not appear a likely explanation for the observed cytonuclear discordance.
Host shift mediated introgression as the cause of
phylogenetic discordance
Introgressive hybridization, i.e. the introduction of an
allele inside the genome of a foreign taxon after hybridization [13], could explain the observed pattern. Introgressive hybridization in Ficus necessitates that a pollinating
wasp fertilizes two hosts. Hybridization may result from
sporadic visitation of an alternative host by a wasp, and
may in that case not require successful development of
wasp offspring. However, it may also result from transient
or even stabilised utilisation of two hosts by a pollinating
wasp species, and could result in subsequent speciation of
the wasps on the new host. Thus, pollinator taxonomy
and phylogeny may be informative to analyse whether
introgressive hybridization could account for discrepancies between markers in the Ficus phylogeny.

Subsections Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae present discordant positions between the chloroplast and nuclear
phylogenies. Subsection Cyathistipulae is strictly associated with genus Agaon. The phylogenetic analysis concludes to nuclear monophyly and does not reject

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:248

cytoplasmic monophyly. On the other hand subsection
Crassicostae is pollinated by what could be its own genus
of pollinators, Paragaon (two species known, and host
association only known for one species) but also more frequently by Elisabethiella and in one case by Nigeriella, i.e.
genera also associated with subsections Chlamidodorae
and Platyphyllae. Hence this part of the cyto-nuclear mismatch could be associated with repeated pollinator host
shifts. Erasmus et al. [26] published a phylogeny of wasps
pollinating Ficus species of section Galoglychia that may
shed light on the origin of genera Agaon (the exclusive pollinators of subsection Cyathistipulae) and Paragaon (pollinating some species of Crassicostae). Based on a combined
ITS/28S data set, they found the following topology:
(((Agaon &Paragaon), (Alfonsiella &Nigeriella), Elisabethiella), Courtella, Allotriozoon). Hence, the cytoplasmic
CCCP clade is exclusively pollinated by the Agaon, Paragaon, Alfonsiella, Nigeriella and Elisabethiella clade. One
may therefore suggest that a first host shift of a pollinator
from an ancestor of the Chlamydodorae to an ancestor of
the Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae may have given rise to
the Agaon-Paragaon lineage (detailed in Figure 6). This
would be the first and major event bringing about the
cyto-nuclear discordance. Then we need to hypothesize a
second wasp transfer between these two large clades, from
Chlamydodorae to Crassicostae. In this scenario, the pollina-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

tors bring with them the cytoplasm of their original host.
A simple way to achieve such an a priori unexpected cytoplasm transfer is the stabilised occurrence of a species of
fig pollinating wasps using two host species. Such a situation allows backcrosses of hybrids with both parental species. Indeed field observations report several cases of two
Ficus species being pollinated by the same wasp species
[26]. For instance Elisabethiella stuckenbergii is known to
pollinate F. burkei, F. natalensis natalensis, F. lingua depauperata and F. petersii [32], a feature which could potentially allow cytoplasm transfer in any direction
independently of which of these Ficus species, if any, was
the original host of the wasp.
The scenario presented above hinges on the relative phylogenetic position of the different genera pollinating section Galoglychia. A recently published pollinator
phylogeny [68] proposed that pollinators of subsections
Chlamydodorae, Platyphyllae, Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae
are monophyletic, as in the phylogeny of Erasmus et al.
[26], and thus does not contradict the scenario proposed
above. This new phylogeny did not include Allotriozoon
and Paragaon and did not fully resolve the position of the
different genera.

Figure 6
Comparative phylogeny and the host shift scenario
Comparative phylogeny and the host shift scenario. If we accept current phylogenies, then a pollinating wasp of an
ancestor of Chlamydodorae and Platyphyllae must have shifted to an ancestor of Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae, an event required
to explain the discrepancy between ITS+ETS (left) and pollinator (right) phylogenies. However, under the hypothesis of a wasp
suddenly changing host (grey arrows), there is no cytoplasm transfer and the Ficus lineage resulting from the hybridization necessary bears a chloroplast related to the Caulocarpae and Galoglychia lineages (middle bottom), a feature which is not observed
in the cytoplasm phylogeny. On the contrary, if a wasp uses two hosts for a prolonged period of time (black arrows), repeated
backcrosses may allow the introduction of a chloroplast originating in the Chlamydodorae plus Platyphyllae lineage inside the
ancestor of Cyathistipulae and Crassicostae (middle top), as observed in the data set. The set of phylogenetic trees therefore
support the role of an intermediate stage in which a pollinating wasp has consistently used two host species.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:248

The second type of discordance, concerning the monophyly of subsections, suggests that introgressive hybridization has occurred inside the CCCP clade, with at least
two evidenced instances. Both cases concerned species
from subsections that are pollinated by several wasp genera. All wasp phylogenies demonstrated the monophyly
of wasp genera [26,68]. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that hosts shift could
account for several wasp genera pollinating a single Ficus
subsection. Erasmus et al. [26] and Jousselin et al. [36]
recently suggested that original pollinator species duplication followed by more recent extinction of one or other of
the lineages in host figs, rather than host shifts, could
explain this unusual association pattern. Beyond evidence
for cytoplasmic gene transfers in our phylogenies, there
are two reasons that do not favour this hypothesis. First
we would need to apply this line of reasoning to subsection Crassicostae which is pollinated by three wasp genera
(Paragaon, Elisabethiella, Nigeriella). As Elisabethiella and
Nigeriella also pollinate subsection Chlamydodorae, these
genera should then have differentiated into well defined
genera very early in section Galoglychia history and only
much later would one genus have become extinct in some
species or even subspecies and survived in other species or
even subspecies. The second reason is that Erasmus et al.
[26] provided direct evidence of ongoing local pollinator
exchange between Ficus species. Indeed Alfonsiella binghami samples from Nelspruit (South Africa), formed a single genetic group whether collected on F. petersii or on F.
sthulmannii comparatively to samples of A. binghami also
collected on F. sthulmannii but in Lekgalameetse (South
Africa) and in Amani (Tanzania). Finally, recovering a
phylogenetic signal suggesting some amount of parallel
cladogenesis is not sufficient to infer that parallel cladogenesis is relevant within these taxonomic groups. Indeed,
if host shifts preferentially occur between closely related
hosts [69], then the limited amount of evidence suggesting host-pollinator co-cladogenesis in section Chlamydodorae [36] could easily result from host shifts. Hence the
evidence in favour of the occurrence of host shifts within
the pollinators of part of section Galoglychia is overwhelming.
Fig size: a factor facilitating host shifts?
Although we statistically demonstrated only three
instances of cyto-nuclear discordance, it is remarkable
that these signs of introgressive hybridization were only
found in subsections that are implied in the incongruence
between plant and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. If
these results strongly supports the hypothesis that host
shift is the cause of this incongruence, it also stresses the
fact that host shifts have occurred preferentially in some
particular lineages of section Galoglychia. Hence, host shift
could have been facilitated by particular phenotypic traits
in wasps or host plants rather than resulting from purely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

stochastic processes. When we compare the six subsections of section Galoglychia, a striking pattern emerges. All
subsections that share pollinator genera and present cytoplasmic introgression also present, on average, small figs
and are pollinated by small wasps. Conversely all subsections that have their own chloroplast lineage (or for which
cytoplasm monophyly cannot be ruled out) and are pollinated by their own genus of agaonid wasps produce large
figs and are pollinated by large wasps. Among pollinators
of section Galoglychia, large wasp species seem therefore to
be more host-specific than small wasp species, a pattern of
association that could correlate with a simpler and shorter
ostiole passages into small figs of section Galoglychia.
Indeed, in Gabon, Michaloud [70] showed that Courtella
sp. pollinating Ficus ottoniifolia (subsection Caulocarpae)
looses its wings and antennae on entering the tight ostiole
of the fig, while Alfonsiella fimbriata pollinating F. natalensis leprieuri (section Chlamydodorae) only looses its wings
and retains its antennae, going through an ostiole that
Michaloud describes as a simple slit.

Conclusion
As predicted by the hypothesis that host shifts are responsible for the lack of congruence between insect and plant
phylogeny and taxonomy in section Galoglychia, we found
evidence for several cases of chloroplast genetic introgression events. The alternative to host shifts would be duplication of insect taxa on a host followed by later extinction.
Separating these two hypotheses is extremely difficult
[69,71]. However, in our case, because two genetically
independent markers, nuclear DNA carried by insects and
chloroplasts, tell the same story, the hypothesis of host
shifts becomes much more likely. Knowing which lineages are involved in host shifts within a Ficus section
allowed us to infer that a facilitating factor for host shift
could be small fig size. Detecting identical or analogous
patterns to those described here in other sections of the
genus will constitute the real test of their generality.
Finally, while chloroplast DNA presents limited variability in Ficus [72], our initial screening of markers allowed
increasing the number of polymorphic sites. We were
eventually able to resolve deep nodes in the Ficus phylogeny for which ITS and ETS nuclear markers were not sufficiently informative. Non-coding chloroplast markers
could thus be very helpful to resolve basal branching
inside the Ficus phylogeny; a necessary step for an in
depth analysis of the history of the coevolution between
figs and their pollinating wasps.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Forty four specimens belonging to 38 species of Ficus out
of 77 from the section Galoglychia were analysed in addition to 10 species from section Americana. Ficus carica, F.
ingens, F. variegata and F. orthoneura were chosen as out-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:248

groups because they belong to distinct sections originating from Asia. This sampling encompasses all six
subsections of section Galoglychia sensu Berg [31] and
confirmed by Rønsted et al. [33]. For six species, two specimens from different locations were collected and used for
validation. Most of the material consisted of dried leaves
collected during field work mainly by FK, from herbaria
and from living collections. Forty-one ITS and 33 ETS
accessions were retrieved from GenBank (following previously published papers [5,22,33]). We chose to acquire
our own set of nuclear sequences for species for which
available sequences came from individuals of unknown
geographic origin and belonging to species with large panafrican distribution ranges, or for species recognized to
include several subspecies or morphotypes. This procedure allowed us to be confident that we were comparing
chloroplast and nuclear genes of the same taxa. A list of
taxa with origin and GenBank accession numbers is provided in Additional file 2.
Chloroplast DNA laboratory work
Although chloroplast markers were used in early Ficus
phylogenetic studies [20], their low level of polymorphism and the associate difficulty to obtain resolved phylogenies down to genus level excluded them from
subsequent studies [72]. We therefore developed our own
chloroplast primer pairs. We focused on non-coding to
select informative sequences. The detailed protocols used
during molecular laboratory works are provided in Additional file 5. We designed primer pairs in Ficus using the
Oligo4 software. The Staden Package was used to compile
contiguous sequences of each accession and all polymorphic sites were checked against the original electrophoregrams. They were re-examined and adjusted manually
using BioEdit [73]. To identify the position of Ficus
sequences, they were blasted with the completely
sequenced chloroplast genome, phylogenetically closest
to Ficus, namely that of Morus indica [74]. Pairwise P-distance and average value with standard error estimated by
500 bootstraps were computed using the MEGA software
version 3.1 [75].

Using universal primers developed by Grivet et al. [76] in
the large single copy (LSC) region of chloroplast genome,
we tested 25 amplifying DNA fragments smaller than 3 Kb
on a sub-sample of 9 species (see Additional file 6) representing genus Ficus diversity with 6 sections and 3 species
within section Galoglychia. We also tested two previously
described sequences, atpB-rbcL [77] and trnL
(UAA)3'exon-trnF(GAA) [78]. Based on the resulting
sequences and their polymorphism, we selected 10 primer
pairs and defined new primer pairs to amplify potentially
informative sequences shorter than 1 kb (see Additional
file 1). For the 3 fragments longer than 1 kb, we designed
2 to 3 primer pairs focusing on the most informative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

sequences with 6 to 15 substitutions. These 14 amplified
sequences were distributed throughout the LSC chloroplast genome. We examined the amount of phylogenetic
information conveyed by each marker on 33 Ficus species
including 19 from sections Galoglychia and Americana.
Finally, we eventually selected five markers on the basis of
the phylogenetic information they conveyed: atpB-rbcL,
FcB, FcL, FcJ and trnL-trnF.
ITS and ETS laboratory work
Based on 100 ITS sequences previously published
[5,22,33], we designed new primer pairs specifically
defined in Ficus using the Oligo4 software. The primers
ITSF1 (ACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGA) and ITSF4 (GTATAGTTATTCGCCTCCT) were defined as forward and
reverse primers in 18S and 26S ribosomal RNA genes,
respectively. An additional reverse primer ITSF5 (CGGAGGTTACGCTGGGGTC) was defined in the zone at the
junction between ITS2 and 26S conferring a high specificity in Ficus species. Indeed, ITS amplification using the
ITSF1-ITSF5 primer pair was selective and successful for
some samples producing a single, clearly defined, DNA
fragment. For the remaining samples, we used the ITSF1ITSF4 primer pair that amplified several bands since they
were defined on conserved sequences. For samples which
produced several amplified DNA fragments, we selected
the one presenting the expected size based on previous
published ITS sequences [22,72] by isolating it from the
agarose gel following a long electrophoresis migration.
We then performed a second PCR on this isolated DNA
fragment for sequencing. ETS amplification was performed using the ETS-Hel-1/18S-ETS primer pair [79].
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Sequence alignment was performed using the program
Clustal X [80] with manual adjustment and excluding
ambiguous alignment positions (0.2% and 3.5% of the
original chloroplast and nuclear data sets, respectively).
All analyses with the chloroplast genes were performed
with the five markers combined into a single matrix. This
concatenation is not expected to modify the inference of
the chloroplast history since this organelle is not known
to recombine in wild Angiosperms [81]. For nuclear analyses, we followed previous studies that demonstrated that
ITS and ETS sequences could be combined into a single
matrix in Ficus [5,22]. In maximum parsimony (MP) analyses, all characters were equally weighted and treated as
unordered. Heuristic searches using PAUP* 4b10 [82]
were started with 1000 stepwise random addition
sequence replicates, holding 10 trees at each step, followed by tree bisection-reconnection branch (TBR) swapping, saving maximally 100 most parsimonious trees. All
shortest trees retained in memory were used as starting
trees for a second round of searching using TBR branch
swapping until all trees were found or a pre-set maximum

of 15,000 trees were found. We eventually computed the
strict consensus of the most parsimonious trees (SCMP).
Relative levels of homoplasy in both nuclear and chloroplast data sets were assessed from all characters using the
consistency index (CI) and the retention index (RI) as
implemented in PAUP. Bootstrap support was assessed
using 1000 replicates each consisting of 10 random addition sequence replicates with TBR swapping and no limits
on the number of trees saved.
Bayesian inferences (BI) were performed with several partitioning strategies for each data matrix. Three strategies
were tested with the chloroplast matrix: all chloroplast
data combined (P1 in Table 1), one partition each for the
five markers (P2-P6) and one partition each for the coding
and non-coding DNA (P7-P8). Two strategies were tested
with the nuclear matrix: all chloroplast data combined
(P9) and one partition each for ITS and ETS (P10-P11). The
appropriate model of sequence evolution for each partition was determined using the likelihood ratio test (LRT)
implemented with MrModeltest [83].
We tested every partitioning strategy with BI with the program MrBayes 3.1.2 [84]. Model parameters were always
taken as unlinked and the rate multipliers set as variable
across partitions. Initial runs were conducted starting with
random neighbour joining trees to check the number of
simultaneous Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
chains necessary not to get caught on local optima. A
Dirichlet distribution was assumed for the rate matrix and
base frequency and every tree topology was assumed to be
equally probable. The MCMC process was set so that two
simultaneous independent analyses starting from different random trees with four chains (three heated) ran
simultaneously over 4,000,000 generations, and every
200th tree saved into a file. Variation in likelihood scores
was examined graphically to determine apparent stationarity for each independent run resulting in a burnin of
10% trees. MCMC convergence was also explored by
examining the Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF)
convergence diagnostics for all parameters in the model.
Finally, we determined posterior probabilities of the phylogenies and associated branches based on the stationary
trees pooled from the two runs for each analysis.
The results for each partitioning strategy were compared
to the strategy with the best arithmetic mean of the likelihoods (-lnL; sampled from the posterior) using Bayes factors (see [85] for details). Bayes factors were
approximated by the ratio of the harmonic means of the
likelihoods of the two strategies being tested [86]. Arithmetic and harmonic means were calculated using the
sump command of MrBayes. In this study, we used the traditional cutoff criterion of 2ln Bayes factor of  10 as very
strong evidence against the compared strategy [87].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/248

Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed with
RaxML [88] which offers the possibility to partition data.
For each data set, we therefore ran analyses using the best
partitioning strategy and model of sequence evolution
calculated with MrModeltest. We replicated 200 heuristic
searches using a randomized maximum parsimony tree as
starting tree. The confidence of branching was assessed
using 1000 non-parametric bootstrap resamplings generated as heuristic searches. The information from the 1000
bootstrapped trees was drawn on the best-scoring ML tree
from the 200 runs.
Gap characters representing mainly deletions were studied separately from the nucleotide matrices. Gaps were
coded for each data set using SeqState [89] with the Simple Indel Coding approach (SIC) [90]. This method scores
all gaps, regardless of length, as separate presence/absence
characters. Sequences with gaps that extend beyond both
the 5'- and 3'-termini of the gap being coded, as well as
sequences with gaps that extend beyond one terminus and
to the other terminus, are scored as missing data for that
character. We used preferentially the SIC approach
because it has been demonstrated to outperform the classical method consisting in coding gaps as 5th states for
each and every nucleotide position regardless of length
[91]. We eventually mapped gaps onto the topologies
resulting from the analyses of the respective data sets.
Because of limited space along branches, we mapped only
synapomorphic gaps.
Analyses of cyto-nuclear discordances
Chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies appeared discordant
for several internal and external nodes. The nested pattern
of the discordances prevented us from testing their individual significance by using the classical method of
removing all discordant taxa and then adding them individually in comparative tests (see [39] for an example).
Instead, we used Templeton tests [92] with trees modified
from the SCMPs, and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests (SH;
[93]) with trees modified from the ML trees. SH tests were
implemented in PAUP, using the REEL approximation
with 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Because PAUP cannot
account for partitions, models of sequence evolution
specified in SH tests were those calculated with all data
combined for each data set. Basically, for two phylogenetic hypotheses to be discordant, a topology A must
explain significantly better a data set A than a topology B
does it, and a topology B must explain significantly better
a data set B than a topology A does it. Both conditions
need to be full-filled to be able to assess the significance
of a given discordance. For example, the global discordance between nuclear and chloroplast topology was tested
by comparing the length of the SCMP of the chloroplast
trees with the length of the nuclear SCMP, based on the
chloroplast data set. The test was then repeated based on

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:248

the nuclear data set. Similarly, we tested several local discordances individually by comparing a SCMP topology
with the same SCMP topology in which only one discordant accession was moved manually in the position as
found in the rival topology; each time duplicating the test
with both data sets. Last, we tested discordances with a
Bayesian approach [85]. This was achieved by first building 95% credible sets of unique trees (sampled at stationarity) with the sumt command in MrBayes for each the
chloroplast and nuclear analysis. Then, we used the SumTrees [94] software to check for the presence of alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses in the 95% credible set. If they
were absent, these hypotheses could be rejected statistically.
Because saturation in substitutions can lead to incorrect
phylogenetic inferences [95], we plotted the estimated
number of transitions and transversions against the
genetic distance using DAMBE V 4.5.32 [96]. In an
unsaturated data set, transitions and transversions are
both expected to increase linearly with the genetic distance, with a steeper slope for transitions than for transversions. Analyses were conducted with chloroplast, ITS
and ETS sequence matrixes separately.
We investigated the hypothesis of amplifying paralogous
copies of nuclear genes by assessing the minimum
number of gene duplications and extinctions that are
required to generate the observed discordant pattern with
the help of the GeneTree 1.3.0 software [97,98]. This procedure was only done for the nuclear genes because gene
duplication has not been documented for plastid loci
[99]. Because ITS and ETS belong to the same unit of transcription, we did not separate them for this analysis.
Fig and pollinator size
Data on fig and pollinator size were retrieved from Berg &
Wiebes [18]. As the data were collected by the same
observers, the values were comparable. Dry fig diameter
was averaged for each subsection of section Galoglychia.
We used diameter of dry figs because it was the sole figsize measure available for all species. We also used body
length for each pollinator wasp species. Body length
included head, thorax and gaster but excluded the ovipositor. Simple mean comparison tests were performed to
compare fig/wasp size between subsections/genera
involved in strict association with their partners and subsections/genera involved in multiple associations.
