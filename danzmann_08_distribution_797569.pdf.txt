Abstract
Background: Comparative genomic studies suggest that the modern day assemblage of ray-finned
fishes have descended from an ancestral grouping of fishes that possessed 12–13 linkage groups. All
jawed vertebrates are postulated to have experienced two whole genome duplications (WGD) in
their ancestry (2R duplication). Salmonids have experienced one additional WGD (4R duplication
event) compared to most extant teleosts which underwent a further 3R WGD compared to other
vertebrates. We describe the organization of the 4R chromosomal segments of the proto-rayfinned fish karyotype in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout based upon their comparative syntenies
with two model species of 3R ray-finned fishes.
Results: Evidence is presented for the retention of large whole-arm affinities between the
ancestral linkage groups of the ray-finned fishes, and the 50 homeologous chromosomal segments
in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. In the comparisons between the two salmonid species, there
is also evidence for the retention of large whole-arm homeologous affinities that are associated
with the retention of duplicated markers. Five of the 7 pairs of chromosomal arm regions
expressing the highest level of duplicate gene expression in rainbow trout share homologous
synteny to the 5 pairs of homeologs with the greatest duplicate gene expression in Atlantic salmon.
These regions are derived from proto-Actinopterygian linkage groups B, C, E, J and K.
Conclusion: Two chromosome arms in Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes (descendants of the 3R
duplication) can, in most instances be related to at least 4 whole or partial chromosomal arms in

the salmonid species. Multiple arm assignments in the two salmonid species do not clearly support
a 13 proto-linkage group model, and suggest that a 12 proto-linkage group arrangement (i.e., a
separate single chromosome duplication and ancestral fusion/fissions/recombination within the
putative G/H/I groupings) may have occurred in the more basal soft-rayed fishes. We also found
evidence supporting the model that ancestral linkage group M underwent a single chromosome
duplication following the 3R duplication. In the salmonids, the M ancestral linkage groups are
localized to 5 whole arm, and 3 partial arm regions (i.e., 6 whole arm regions expected). Thus, 3
distinct ancestral linkage groups are postulated to have existed in the G/H and M lineage
chromosomes in the ancestor of the salmonids.

Introduction
Salmonid fishes are known to have descended from an
autopolyploidization event that occurred within the
ancestral grouping that gave rise to the Salmoniformes
sometime within the early Tertiary or late Cretaceous periods [1]. Supporting evidence for this event is both karyotypic and genomic, in that salmonids still retain a large
amount of duplicate gene expression within their
genome. This is evidenced by the fact that essentially identical DNA sequence tracts are retained within their
genomes which map to unlinked chromosomal arms (i.e.,
detection of several duplicated SSR and EST markers in
their genome)[2-4]. Furthermore, quadrivalent meiotic
configurations are often observed within male-specific
meioses involving a portion of the available chromosome
arms. These pairings always appear to involve metacentric
chromosomes that may or may not include an acrocentric
pair [5]. Segregation ratios consistent with tetrasomic
inheritance or partial tetrasomic ratios are also observed
following male meioses [6] indicating that the genomes of
salmonids have not completely returned to disomy which
would be expected following the complete divergence of
duplicated chromosomal regions. Additionally, the
modal range of chromosome arms in salmonids is
between 96 – 104, whereas most teleost species, especially
freshwater groups, have modal diploid chromosome
numbers ranging from 48 – 52 [7,8]. This observation is
strong supporting evidence that the salmonid genome
underwent a whole genome duplication (WGD) from a
freshwater ancestral lineage.
Actinopterygians are also now largely recognized as being
descended from ancestral forms that underwent a WGD
event. Two current models exist, which suggest that the
ray-finned fishes arose from an ancestral form possessing
either 12 [9] or 13 ancestral linkage groups [10]. Supporting evidence for the WGD event can be obtained from
phylogenetic data on a large number of gene duplicates
which estimate the divergence times for these genes somewhere between 275 – 350 MYA [9-13]. This 'burst' of gene
duplication overlays data that demonstrates continuous
levels of genomic duplication events throughout the evolutionary history of the group. Additional support comes

from examining the number and distribution of functional gene copies that are retained in the genome of modern teleosts within highly conserved multi-gene families.
Hox genes are a classic example of the postulated WGD
event that occurred in the ray-finned fish lineage. All the
teleost species that have been extensively studied at the
DNA sequence level, retain 7 ancestrally derived Hox clusters (8 are expected) at different chromosomal locations,
each with up to 13 genes, whereas invertebrate species
typically contain only a single Hox cluster or separate
genes interspersed throughout their genome [14,15]. The
organization of the central 13 Hox paralogs into multiple
syntenic clusters is strong evidence that Actinopterygians
have experienced 3 WGD events in their evolutionary history. In the Sarcopterygian lineage that led to the tetrapods, only 4 extant Hox clusters are evident, suggesting that
two rounds of WGD may have led to the formation of the
lobe-finned clade (i.e., 2R duplication model). This 2R
duplication is postulated to have occurred prior to the origin of the gnathostomes [11-13,15]. Actinopterygians,
then are seen as 3R WGD descendants (i.e., having experienced 3 rounds of WGD in their evolutionary past). Support for this model comes from the fact that a vast
majority of the 3R gene duplicates fall within large syntenic blocks that can be assigned to a pair of linkage
groups or haploid chromosome sets within the genomes
of extant teleost species. Within two salmonid species,
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar) up to 14 Hox paralogons or chromosomal
locations (up to 16 are expected) have been identified
supporting the model that salmonids are 4R derivative
lineages [16,17]. Thus, investigations within this more
recent teleost polyploid lineage may provide important
insights into the organization and distribution of ancient
synteny blocks that gave rise to the modern day vertebrate
lineages.
The most recent model on vertebrate evolution postulates
that 10 different linkage group blocks existed in a protochordate ancestral form [10], that may be designated A' –
J'. Following two rounds of WGD, involving multiple single chromosome duplications within the A', B', and F' lineages, (that gave rise to 17 chromosomes), and multiple

chromosome loss or fusion events in the G', H', I', and J'
lineages (that resulted in 11 chromosomes), a 40 chromosome ancestral form arose at the base of the gnathostome
lineage. Extensive chromosomal fusions, and in some
instances fissions within the ancestral gnathostome segments, were postulated to have led to a 13 chromosome
proto-Actinopterygian karyotype composed of 52 A'-J'
segments as follows: A' = 8 segments; B' = 10 segments; C'
= 6 segments; D' = 5 segments; E' = 5 segments; F' = 6 segments; G' = 4 segments; H' = 3 segments; I' = 3 segments;
and J' = 2 segments [10]. In most instances these blocks
became mosaically arrayed within the 13 chromosome
proto-Actinopterygian karyotype (designated A – M), with
the exception of the 3 group I' blocks that appear to have
been arrayed tandemly towards one end of the E chromosome in the proto-Actinopterygian karyotype, and the K
chromosome which was composed entirely from a single
block within the D' lineage. These arrangements are of
interest due to the fact that herein we report that synteny
blocks derived from the E and K ancestral chromosomes
along with three other ancestral linkage groups appear to
retain a high degree of duplicate sequence expression
within the genomes of both rainbow trout and Atlantic
salmon. The current dataset also suggests that large tracts
of extensive synteny appear to exist between the salmonids and model teleost test species such as the zebrafish
(Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes), and thus, comparative synteny analyses may be extremely valuable in
identifying genes of importance regulating physiological,
developmental, and behavioural modalities in salmonid
fishes.

Results
Genetic maps
Currently there are 1855 markers located onto the L25
and L44 rainbow trout mapping panels. These include:
727 AFLP markers; 102 Type I genes; 337 EST markers;
665 SSR markers; 21 BAC-end sequence markers; and the
phenotypic marker SEX. There are presently 1671 markers
localized to the Br5 and Br6 Atlantic salmon mapping
panels. These markers are distributed as: 275 AFLP markers; 43 Type I genes; 174 Type I-SNP markers; 187 EST
markers; 410 SSR markers; 582 BAC-end sequence markers; and the phenotypic marker SEX. Information on the
distribution of variation in these markers within the four
mapping parents used for each species is given in Additional File 1 and Additional File 2. The genetic maps for
the four rainbow trout mapping parents are provided in
Additional Files 3, 4, 5, 6, while the respective maps for
the four Atlantic salmon parents are provided in Additional Files 7, 8, 9, 10. Additional File 11 depicts the combined rainbow trout female map aligned with the
homologous Atlantic salmon linkage groups, while Additional File 12 depicts the reciprocal associations. In both
species maps, linkage group 1 represents the sex-linkage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/557

group. Given the large recombination differences between
the sexes in salmonid species [2,18,19], female maps were
deemed the most representative of true gene marker
orders within each species, and merged female maps were
constructed for all comparative analyses.
4R versus 3R homologies
As expected, the assignment of linkage groups within the
two salmonid species to the ancestral ray-finned fish karyotype indicates that most ancestrally derived 3R linkage
groups are represented by approximately 4 whole or partial arm affinities in the salmonids (Table 1 and Figures 1,
2 and 3). Both the G/H and M ancestral linkage groups
have the highest number of detected salmonid arm
homologies across all linkage groups, with 5 whole arm,
and 3–4 partial arm affinities in both sets. Linkage group
M is postulated to have undergone a single chromosome
duplication event that gave rise to 3 linkage groups shortly
after the origin of the ray-finned fish lineage [10,20]. Following a WGD six linkage group affinities would be
expected in a 4R lineage which is consistent with the
empirical data within archetype group M. For linkage
group G/H, the current data is compatible with an interpretation that this assemblage could have arisen from two
ancestral linkage groups. According to the Kasahara et al.
model [20], linkage group G primarily composes Dr14
and Olat10/14, with minor contributions to Dr15, and
linkage group H contributes primarily to Dr10/15/21 and
Olat13. This would then be compatible with the interpretation that all of, or portions of linkage group arms RT1/
AS9qa, RT7q/AS31, RT9p/AS5qb, RT11/AS25qb, RT12q/
AS32, and RT26/AS10qc descended from basal group H,
while RT1/AS9qa, RT9p/AS5qb, RT3q/AS10qb, RT3q/
AS12p, RT20p/AS28q, and RT25p/AS10qb are most likely
to have descended from group G. Because of the shared
affinities among these three putative ancestral linkage
groups (i.e., G, H, I), it is currently unclear in the salmonids whether these groupings arose from WGD events in
three separate proto-Actinopterygian linkage groups, or
whether one or more of the single linkage groups within
this set underwent a single chromosome doubling followed by genomic re-arrangements within this set of
genomic segments. This would suggest that these genomic
regions were derived from only two ancestral groupings
(i.e., a 12 chromosome proto-Actinopterygian model; see
Discussion for explanation).

Although many large synteny blocks were detected in the
salmonids among the various 3R teleost linkage groups
(i.e., within zebrafish and medaka) (Figures 2 and 3, and
Additional File 13 (rainbow trout synteny blocks), and
Additional File 14 (Atlantic salmon synteny blocks)),
many ancestral affinities were not readily apparent until
linkage group blocks were assembled according to their
ancestral homologies (e.g., compare RT9p, RT12p and

model [20] within the rainbow trout genome. Composite female map lengths are given in centiMorgans (cM) according to the
scale shown in the bottom left-hand corner of the figure. In some instances female linkage groups are depicted as multiple separate LOD = 4.0 clusters. Centromeric locations within each linkage group [38] are shown as horizontal line segments and are
indicated with a 'c' to the right of the linkage group. For certain linkage group arms, it is currently not possible to distinguish D
and/or E ancestral affinities, or J and/or K ancestral affinities. These arm segments are indicated as D/E, and J/K regions on the
figure and are indicated via diagonal cross-hatching. Short p arms are oriented towards the top of the figure according to [22].

shown in Additional File 13 with the ancestral homologies in Figure 2). Additionally, within salmonid linkage
group arms retaining major synteny to whole 3R teleost
chromosome arms (e.g., RT9q with Dr3 and Olat8 – Figure 2 and Additional File 13), marker positions according
to the 3R species database assemblies in ENSEMBL were
not linear, suggesting major internal re-arrangement and
inversions have occurred within the homologous chromosomes among these species. Within several arms,
homologies were also detected to multiple ancestral linkage groups (e.g., RT6p, RT7q, RT9p, RT12p, RT17p, RT24p
and their respective Atlantic salmon homologues), and

single-marker assignments to additional groupings are
also evident, suggesting certain linkage group arms in the
salmonid genome may even be more mosaic than currently depicted.
4R homeologies within Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout
Given the fact that salmonids have undergone a more
recent WGD compared to most extant teleosts, it is
expected that whole chromosome arms should retain
duplicated marker signatures of this event. The fact that
most salmonid species retain between 96 to 104 chromosome arms is also strong support that a WGD has occurred
within this lineage given the observation that the modal

model [20] within the Atlantic salmon genome. Composite female map lengths are given in centiMorgans (cM) according to the
scale shown in the bottom left-hand corner of the figure. In some instances female linkage groups are depicted as multiple separate LOD = 4.0 clusters. For certain linkage group arms, it is currently not possible to distinguish D and/or E ancestral affinities, or J and/or K ancestral affinities. These arm segments are indicated as D/E, and J/K regions on the figure and are indicated
via diagonal cross-hatching. Short p arms are oriented towards the top of the figure according to [21].

chromosome number in teleosts is 48–50 acrocentric
based chromosomes yielding 24–25 linkage groups. Thus,
in salmonids we might expect a similar number of homeologous affinities to be observed (i.e., 24 up to a maximum of 27 homeologs [= pairs of chromosome arms
derived from the most recent WGD]), dependent upon
the number of extant chromosome arms in the species
and whether individual chromosome arms may have
experienced pericentric inversions during their evolutionary history. Multiple arm re-arrangements and translocations may also increase the number of arm homeologies
observed, as a single chromosome arm may have affinities
to more than one other chromosome arm in the genome.
Such a situation is evident for the 9p arm and centromeric

region of RT9, wherein multiple single marker putative
homeologies have been observed. When considering syntenic block homeologies within rainbow trout, 20 linkage
group arm pairs have been observed to possess either
more than one duplicated marker, or in the case where
only a single duplicated marker has been observed there is
supporting evidence from the 3R syntenic blocks that
these regions are homeologous (Figure 4). Five additional
homeologues are inferred from the ancestral 3R synteny
blocks. However, for two of these putative homeologues
(i.e., RT8/24 and RT23/24), the marker affinities may lie
with the same region on RT24p possessing ancestral M
homology. Also, for the affinities inferred between RT1/8
and RT8/9, it cannot be discounted that RT1/9 may also

1 Linkage group arm affinities within zebrafish and medaka to their ancestral origins are from the model presented by Nakatani et al. 2007 [10], and
data from the current study. The number of whole and partial arm affinities to these chromosomal regions in the two salmonid species are
indicated in the last 3 columns.
2 RT-5 represents a putative whole arm inversion (i.e., 2 of the whole arms indicated may only represent one ancestral arm).

share homeologies, and therefore, these putative blocks
may only represent a single homeologous grouping.
Therefore only 23 homeologies can be inferred. We have
not yet detected affinities to ancestral homologies within
four linkage group arms in rainbow trout (21q, 22q, 23p,
and 24q), and thus the final expected minimum number
of homeologues should be 25. Also RT5 appears to represent a pericentric inversion represented entirely by ancestral linkage group C.
The homeologies within Atlantic salmon are dependent
both upon single arm affinities as well as partial arm affinities due to the whole arm fusions that have occurred
within this species. Thirteen linkage groups within this
species possess whole arm fusions of at least two chromosome arms [20], with two of these linkage groups possessing 3 whole arm affinities to rainbow trout. Atlantic
salmon possess far fewer duplicated genetic markers compared to rainbow trout. The lack of duplicated polymorphisms within this species makes it difficult to detect
homeologies. Only 5 homeologs were detected with an
abundance of duplicates (≥ 5) (Figure 5), and in total,
only 19 homeologies are described, with 6 of these putative homeologs based upon inferences from the ancestral
linkage group affinities. Furthermore, AS5qb/AS9qa and
AS17qb/9qa represent possible partial arm homeologies,
as do the associations between AS24q/8qa and 8qa/9qa.
Therefore only 17–18 homeologies can be inferred given
that affinities within AS8qa and AS9qa appear to represent partial arm homeologies. Homeologous affinities for
AS1qb, 2qb, 4p, 5qa, 6qb, 8qb, 10qb, 12p, 13qa, 16qb,
18, 24q, 28p, 25qa, and a portion of 31 could not be

inferred based upon larger synteny blocks. Thus, similar
to rainbow trout, it is expected that at least 25 homeologs
should eventually be identified, once the 7–8 homeologous affinities represented by these unassigned chromosome arms can be identified.

Discussion
Salmonid genomes have an architecture that is largely
reflective of WGD events in their evolutionary past. When
considering only the larger synteny blocks that have been
tentatively identified within rainbow trout and Atlantic
salmon genomes, all ancestral linkage groups with the
exceptions of group A align with whole or partial arm
affinities representing 4 or more arms. Following two
rounds of WGD, four homologous affinities would be
expected across the salmonid chromosome arms each
possessing homology to a single pre-3R ancestral region.
Regions homologous to ancestral grouping A have only
been detected within 2 apparent whole arms (i.e., RT14q
and RT24q), and one partial arm (RT25q). A fourth region
of homology may reside on RT24p, but this has not been
confirmed through synteny mapping within the medaka
genome. Greater than 4 whole arm affinities exist for
homologies detected with ancestral groupings G/H and
M. If G/H do in fact represent two separate ancestral linkage groups as postulated by the Kasahara et al. [20] model
then 8 arm affinities should exist in salmonids for these
linkage groups. We cannot exclude this possibility with
the current dataset, given the fact that 5 whole-arm and 2–
4 partial-arm syntenies were identified as being derived
from the G/H cluster. However, the comparative homologies with zebrafish chromosomes derived from G/H/I

Putative 4R homeologous linkage group affinities within the rainbow trout (Figure 4) and Atlantic salmon (Figure 5) genome based upon duplicated marker distributions. Acrocentric linkage groups composed of only a single
ancestral arm are depicted in yellow background on the Oxford grid axes. Acrocentric linkage groups are expected to only
possess a single 4R homeologous affinity while metacentric linkage groups should possess at least two 4R affinities. Several arm
fusions have occurred in Atlantic salmon resulting in the expectation that metacentric chromosomes such as AS-17 possess 3
whole-arm affinities, while acrocentric chromosomes AS-2, -3, -5, -6, -8, -9, -13, -16, -22, -23, and -25 will have two whole-arm
affinities. For AS-10, three whole-arm affinities are expected within this large acrocentric chromosome [21]. Homeologies
based upon only a single duplicated marker are in some instances supported by the mapping of single non-duplicated markers
in alternate mapping parents to either of the putative duplicated homeologous linkage groups. Inferred homeologies based
upon the comparative synteny mapping with zebrafish and medaka (Figures 1 – 3) are indicated as orange blocks in the Oxford
grids.

ancestral groupings represent a mosaic pattern across the
salmonid genome, which may also be compatible with
the model whereby a single chromosome within either
the ancestral putative G/H grouping or I grouping underwent a duplication followed by reticulate exchange of segments between all the chromosomes in these two (i.e., G/
H vs I) lineages (see details below). This same scenario
appears to account for the three M lineage derived chromosomes within both the medaka and zebrafish genomes

[10], and is supported by the data within the salmonids,
given that 5 whole-arm and 3 partial-arm affinities exist
for M lineage markers. Finally, the assignment of 3 wholearm, and 5–6 partial-arm affinities to D lineage derived
chromosomes within salmonids is more a reflection of
the very incomplete information contained within certain
salmonid linkage group arms. For example, while both
comparative synteny mapping and duplicated marker
expression support the homeologies between RT6q/RT30,

Putative 4R homeologous linkage group affinities within the rainbow trout (Figure 4) and Atlantic salmon (Figure 5) genome based upon duplicated marker distributions. Acrocentric linkage groups composed of only a single
ancestral arm are depicted in yellow background on the Oxford grid axes. Acrocentric linkage groups are expected to only
possess a single 4R homeologous affinity while metacentric linkage groups should possess at least two 4R affinities. Several arm
fusions have occurred in Atlantic salmon resulting in the expectation that metacentric chromosomes such as AS-17 possess 3
whole-arm affinities, while acrocentric chromosomes AS-2, -3, -5, -6, -8, -9, -13, -16, -22, -23, and -25 will have two whole-arm
affinities. For AS-10, three whole-arm affinities are expected within this large acrocentric chromosome [21]. Homeologies
based upon only a single duplicated marker are in some instances supported by the mapping of single non-duplicated markers
in alternate mapping parents to either of the putative duplicated homeologous linkage groups. Inferred homeologies based
upon the comparative synteny mapping with zebrafish and medaka (Figures 1 – 3) are indicated as orange blocks in the Oxford

the region within RT6q possessing homology to ancestral
region D is currently very small. RT6 is the largest physical
chromosome in the genome [21,22], and it would not be
surprising to find other partial-arm affinities within RT6q.
Multiple partial arm affinities may be expected through
time, following translocation and genome re-arrangement
events within each species. While it can be postulated that
as more comparative data is accumulated the chromo-

some arm affinities currently assigned to an ancestral
grouping will be represented by a more mosaic association pattern among chromosome arms, the current data
allows us to observe certain whole arm affinities within
linkage groups that appear to have arisen by the fusion of
arms within the same ancestral groupings. For example,
RT30 and its homologous region AS17qa show extensive
homology to group D throughout the length of the currently identified linkage group markers. Using the com-

parative medaka genome as a template, it can be observed
that both Olat15 and Olat19 markers form two large synteny blocks within RT30, suggesting a possible fusion of
group D 3R duplicates within this region of the salmonid
genome. Conversely, Olat19 contributes most extensively
to the RT9p/RT17q/RT22p affinities, while Olat15 underlies the RT6q and RT17p affinities (Figure 1). Similarly,
AS33 also appears to represent a fusion of group D segments as the largest portion of the acrocentric chromosome is derived from Olat19 (with affinities to RT22p/
RT17q), with a smaller terminal region distal to
BX075694 (see Table 1 and Additional File 13 and Additional File 14) derived from Olat15, and sharing homology with RT17q. Both these regions on AS33 are divided
by a smaller synteny block derived from group E.
Two ancestral linkage groups (H and I) appear to share a
propensity in forming adjacent synteny blocks within
chromosome arms, as indicated by their partial arm affinities within RT1/AS9qa, RT9p/AS5qb, and the whole arm
fusions represented by AS25qa and AS25qb. A small
region near the centromere on RT12q also possesses a synteny block derived from ancestral grouping H. These
observations are of interest given the finding by Kasahara
et al. [20] that ancestral groupings H and I have contributed extensively to chromosome re-arrangements within
zebrafish linkage groups Dr14, Dr15, Dr10, Dr21, Dr5,
and Dr8. Conversely, linkage groups derived from the
ancestral H/I groups were not suggestive of rearrangements within either medaka or the greed-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigriviridis) genomes [20]. This
observation suggests that chromosomal re-arrangements
in these two ancestral groupings may have been more
extensive within at least some of the more basal Malcopterygian (soft-rayed) teleosts.
Similar to the single ancestral chromosome doubling
within the M linkage group that was postulated to account
for the retention of large synteny blocks among 3 modern
day teleost linkage groups [10,20], the current data
obtained from the salmonids, in combination with the
genomic arrangements detected in zebrafish, suggests that
one of the chromosomes within the G/H/I linkage groups
underwent a single chromosome doubling event. Following this single duplication, it is unclear whether two of
these chromosomes may have undergone fission events to
generate 4 new chromosomes, or whether only 1 of the
newly formed chromosomes may have undergone a fission event. With the former scenario, following extensive
meiotic exchange among these regions, a subsequent
fusion event may have occurred between a pair of these
chromosomes. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is
obtained using comparative syntenies within salmonids is
as follows: Within the salmonids the following zebrafish
and medaka homology pairings were observed within

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/557

linkage group arms: Dr8 with Olat9, 2×; Dr5/10/21 with
Olat12, 3×, Dr5/10/15 with Olat13, 1×; Dr5/10/21 with
Olat14, 2×; Dr14 with Olat10, 2×. The observation of
associations within linkage groups derived from the I cluster within medaka (i.e., Olat12), and the G/H cluster (i.e.,
Olat14/13), with segments derived from Dr5/10/21, and
Dr15 with Olat13, suggests that extensive homology exists
among all these regions.
Ancestral groupings G/H/I share segments from 3 (i.e., C',
F', and H') of the 10 linkage group blocks of the postulated proto-chordate genome clusters [10]. From this
model, it is most likely that a chromosome within the H
cluster underwent a single duplication and consequent
fission, as this may have generated segments sharing
homology among proto-chordate C'/F' blocks among the
G/H groups, and proto-chordate C'/H' blocks between the
H/I groups. There appears to have been a high degree of
exchange between these regions and one of the duplicated
chromosomes in the I Group (homologous to Olat12).
Presumably one of the derived chromosomes in each
grouping (presumptive Dr8 and Dr14, respectively) were
under greater evolutionary constraint, which limited (or
selected against) exchanges within these blocks. However,
exchanges appear to have been prevalent among one
chromosome from each of the ancestral (G/H)/I pairs, as
evidenced by their mosaic distributions across the salmonid and zebrafish genomes (see Figure 6 and Additional
File 15 for a further explanation of the model). Thus, the
current dataset suggests that a 12 linkage group protokaryotype proposed for the Actinopterygian fishes [9],
may be more consistent with the observed distribution of
linkage group affinities within the lower teleost species
currently studied.
Distribution of duplicated markers
Far fewer duplicated markers were identified in Atlantic
salmon (9.5%) compared to rainbow trout (26%),
despite both genetic maps currently having approximately
the same number of informative type I and type II marker
distributions (i.e., 1125 and 1222 potentially informative
markers in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon, respectively, excluding SNP markers which were pre-screened to
remove duplicates). A greater percentage of type I gene
and EST-based markers were analyzed in rainbow trout,
however, compared to Atlantic salmon which may indicate that duplicate expression is retained to a greater
degree within coding vs. anonymous DNA. Another complementary explanation for this phenomenon may be the
lack of recombination experienced within the Atlantic
salmon genome (i.e., males have dramatically reduced
recombination rates compared to females [18,19,23]).
Within the current dataset, the female : male recombination ratios based upon all pairwise associations of genetic
markers within linkage groups ranged from 7.050:1 to

Model of ancestral linkage group re-arrangements among G/H/I lineage chromosomes
Model of ancestral linkage group re-arrangements among G/H/I lineage chromosomes. Extensive cross syntenies
among zebrafish chromosomes 5, 10, 15, and 21 suggest that a duplication and subsequent fission of one of the two 3R chromosomes in either the I, or presumptive G/H lineage may have occurred. This fission would give the appearance of extra
ancestral groupings (i.e., greater than 4 linkage group arm homologies to either the G/H or the I lineage chromosomes). Reticulate exchange among segments from both ancestral groupings may also have occurred as evidenced by the retention of G/H/I
synteny blocks within rainbow trout arms 1 and 9p. Rainbow trout chromosome arms possessing multiple affinities to zebrafish
linkage groups 5/10/15/21 (i.e, suggestive of greater re-arrangements), are indicated in red font in the centre of the table.

7.234:1 in the two Atlantic salmon mapping families, and
2.567:1 to 2.624:1 in the two rainbow trout mapping
families. Although recombination levels are generally
suppressed in all male salmonids, the degree of recombination suppression appears most extensive within Atlantic salmon, a species that has undergone extensive
genome re-arrangements involving the production of
metacentric chromosomes and large acrocentric chromosomes created via whole arm chromosomal fusions, in
comparison to other salmonid species which have experienced more moderate rearrangements (i.e., rainbow trout
possessing multiple metacentric chromosomes, or Arctic
charr (Salvelinus alpinus) possessing a few metacentric

chromosomes) [7]. While chromosome structure partially
accounts for the large differences observed in female :
male recombination ratios, with lower ratios observed
within acrocentric-based chromosome lineages [23] (i.e.,
more uniform male and female recombination rates),
physical chromosome structure may not entirely define
the degree of retention of duplicated gene expression and
differential sex-specific recombination rates. Other factors
such as gene arrangements within chromosome arms, and
DNA structure motifs contributing to the formation of
chiasmata points [24], or even sex-specific regulation of
cross-over foci [25] may also be contributing factors that
are currently poorly understood in these fishes.

Within Atlantic salmon, the five homeologous pairs of
linkage groups exhibiting the highest level of duplicated
marker expression (≥ 5 pairs) (i.e., AS1/6; AS1/12; AS4/
11; AS22/23; AS22/24) are all localized within either metacentric or larger fused acrocentric chromosomes [21].
Similarly, in rainbow trout, there are 7 homeologous pairings (i.e., RT2q/RT9q; RT27p/RT31p; RT2p/RT29q; RT7p/
RT15p; RT12p/RT16p; RT14p/RT20q; and RT10q/RT18)
that are represented by even greater numbers of duplicated marker affinities, and all of these regions, with the
exception of RT18, fall within metacentric type chromosomes. We suggest that these regions may retain a higher
percentage of duplicated marker expression due to the fact
that both intra-homologous and inter-homeologous
recombination levels may be increased among these linkage groups. The distribution of recombination nodes
within these linkage groups will, however, require additional cytogenetic investigation.
Increased recombination among homeologs will lead to
increased frequencies of multivalent formation during
meiosis which often generates pseudolinkage affinities
among ancestral homeologues involved in the pairing [5].
Interestingly, in our mapping panels, some of the homeologous linkage groups that exhibit the highest retention
of duplicate marker expression have also been detected
forming putative pseudolinkage affinities within rainbow
trout mapping parents (i.e., RT2/29; RT2/RT9; RT12/
RT16; RT27/31) [[23]; unpublished data ], although pseudolinkage affinities have also been observed between
homeologous pairs with lower levels of duplicate gene
expression (i.e., RT6/30; RT5/31). Conservation of pseudolinkage affinities is apparent across salmonid species in
that 5 pseudolinkage groupings have been identified in
brown trout (i.e., BT1/8; BT5/15; BT3/10; BT11/12; and
BT4/34) [4] that can be assigned to homologous chromosomal regions (i.e., RT29/2; RT15/7; RT12/16; RT31/27;
and RT14/unknown, respectively) in rainbow trout. Thus,
all 4 of the linkage group pairs with ascertained arm
assignments between rainbow trout and brown trout correspond to rainbow trout linkage groups with a high
degree of duplicate gene expression. In contrast, pseudolinkage occurrence appears to be more minimal in
Atlantic salmon. One of our mapping panel males has a
pseudolinkage grouping between AS5/18 at a LOD 4.0
clustering level, which appears to be homologous to a
RT9/24 region (i.e., is supported by evidence for a couple
of duplicated markers).
More extensive arm re-arrangements within the genome
of Atlantic salmon may limit the occurrence of multivalents in this species. Strain background may also influence
the propensity to express pseudolinkage given that recombination rates appear more elevated in inter-strain hybrid
versus pure strain genomic backgrounds [26]. Therefore,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/557

the probability of detecting pseudolinkage affinities in
Atlantic salmon may be decreased due to the fact that all
four Atlantic salmon parents used in this study are of pure
strain origin, while two of the four rainbow trout parents
used were of inter-strain origin, and one male was derived
from an intra-strain cross involving a mating between
temporally divergent spawning families (i.e., using cryopreserved sperm).
The concept that the surrounding genetic structure within
an ancestral genomic region may be extremely important
in defining the propensity to retain duplicated gene copies
can be observed within the current dataset. All five of the
regions retaining duplicate gene expression patterns in
Atlantic salmon, share affinity to the same ancestral teleost regions within rainbow trout genome, and are syntenic with the same chromosome arm in rainbow trout
(i.e., RT2q/RT9q & AS4q/AS11q = group E affinity;
RT27p/RT31p & AS1p/AS12q = group B affinity; RT2p/
RT29q & AS1q/AS6qb = group D affinity; RT7p/RT15p &
AS22qa/AS24p = group K affinity; and RT12p/RT16p &
AS22qb/AS23qb = group C, J affinity. While further
research is clearly needed to understand the underlying
nature of these enhanced duplicated gene regions, there
are several factors that may contribute to the observed distributions. One explanation is related to transposable element clusters that have been reported to be associated
with recombination 'hot-spots' in that region-specific
cross-over frequencies appear to be negatively correlated
with the occurrence of transposable elements in these
regions [27-29]. These elements have ubiquitous effects
on underlying genomic structure, including alterations in
the rates of recombination, production of genomic rearrangements, and production of pseudogenization following insertion into gene coding sequences [30]. Therefore, regions replete with these elements may experience
enhanced levels of gene silencing through one or more of
the processes involved with transposition.
Transposons are also non-randomly arrayed within larger
chromosomal regions that may share fairly similar recombination levels as it has been shown that large transposonfree regions (TFR) spanning several kb often surround
important regulatory gene regions in the genome such as
early development regulating genes [31,32]. Strong constraints likely exist on silencing of important early development genes thus purging trasnspositional inserts from
these locations. These regions do not appear to be localized in particular lower frequency transposon regions of
the genome, as the occurrence of transposable elements in
the vicinities surrounding these transposon-free regions
may be quite high, and they have been observed to be
scattered throughout the length of chromosomes [31,32].
However, for the two-classes of TFR that have been categorized (i.e., high and low GC content TFR), it has been

reported that high GC content TFR appear to localize
more towards the telomeric regions of human chromosomes [31], which may in turn suggest that these regions
may be surrounded with a higher than average density of
transposable elements in heterochromatin tracts.

of duplicated genes in the genomes of rainbow trout and
Atlantic salmon is mosaic, and it is postulated that their
retention will be negatively correlated with distribution of
transposable elements within the genomes of these fishes.

Methods
To investigate if the comparative homology regions
within medaka or zebrafish may possess differential distributions of the most common transposon (i.e., Tc1/mariner) families in salmonids, a BLASTN search was
performed using the recently documented sequences from
several family members in this grouping from Atlantic
salmon [33] and rainbow trout NCBI accessions (see
Additional Files 16, 17). The ENSEMBL 'distant homologies' default configuration was used, with an arbitrary
acceptance cut-off e-value of 10-6, and bp length of ≥ 100.
The first 50 highest ranked fragments meeting or exceeding these criteria, for each family member were retained
for the analysis. While the results for zebrafish were mixed
with respect to the distribution of Tc1 elements across
chromosomes, within the medaka genome, there was evidence that chromosomes belonging to ancestral groupings B, C, D, E, and K, had somewhat lower distributions
of Tc1-like fragments scattered throughout their length
(see Additional File 18). The distribution of Tc1-element
hits to the medaka genome also paralleled the distribution of DNA family, SINE, LINE and LTR transposable elements identified within medaka chromosomes [34] given
that the number of salmonid Tc1 elements assigned to a
given medaka chromosome were inversely related to the
average distance (bp) between medaka transposable element sites within each chromosome (see Additional File
19). In other words, medaka chromosomes that possessed
a higher density of transposable elements also received a
higher frequency of salmonid Tc1 element hits. Whether
regions retaining higher levels of duplicate gene expression do in fact possess lower levels of interspaced transpositional elements within the salmonid genome will be an
area of future research interest.

Conclusion
Salmonids, due to their 4R polyploid ancestry retain the
genetic signatures of past gene duplication events. Most
extant duplicated DNA copies map to the chromosome
arms that are immediate descendants of the 4R duplication. However, up to 4 different chromosomal arms in
their genome can be related through comparative synteny
searches, to two different chromosome arms in model teleost fishes such as zebrafish and medaka (i.e., representatives of the 3R WGD). Based upon models of vertebrate
chromosome evolution [10,20], we may infer that two
sets of the ancestral teleost-specific linkage groups may
actually have undergone a triplication (i.e., doubling of
one of the two chromosomes in the linkage group set)
prior to radiation in the soft-rayed fishes. The distribution

Descriptions and characteristics of the two rainbow trout
mapping panels, and two Atlantic salmon mapping panels used for the comparative studies have previously been
provided [23]. Genetic map construction and comparative analyses among maps were performed using various
modules within the software package LINKMFEX [35].
Synteny blocks were defined as regions containing two or
more adjacent markers from a comparison species aligning within the same linkage group or chromosomal
region within the source species. In instances where a single marker from an unrelated linkage group in the comparison species was located within the synteny block, the
region was still considered to be uninterrupted. However,
localization of two or more unrelated linkage group markers within the region denoted a discontinuity. Synteny
block assignments were assessed using BLOCKON within
the LINKMFEX package. All graphical depictions of linkage group affinities were constructed using MAPCHART
[36].
Primer sequences for the rainbow trout and Atlantic
salmon type I markers, SSR and EST markers can be found
at the cGRASP websites: http://www.asalbase.org/ and
http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rdanzman/appendices/ with
BAC end primer sequence information located exclusively
at the former website. Information on the majority of the
markers used in this study can also be obtained directly
from the NCBI website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. All
SNP genotyping was performed using the MassARRAY system from Sequenom (San Diego, CA, USA), and details
on the protocol, EST sequences, and SNP polymorphisms
are given in Moen et al. [19].
Comparative analyses
Homology assignments to the 3R teleost genomes were
performed using the Distant Homologies BLASTN default
options in ENSEMBL http://www.ensembl.org v47 – v49.
The most recent assemblies for the zebrafish genome
(Zv7, July 2007) and medaka (MEDAKA1, October 2005)
were the subjects of query searches using the various type
I, SSR, EST, and BAC end sequences from the salmonids.
Sequences having expectation values lower than 10-6 and
identity values greater than 70% were accepted as possessing acceptable homology matches to the salmonid
genomes. In instances where multiple matches to several
different linkage groups were detected, all with relatively
low e-values, the marker assignments were ignored. In
many instances, however, matches to only 1 or a few alternate linkage groups were evident in the subject searches. If

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/557

the identified linkage groups were consistent with
expected duplicated 3R linkage group affinities, the
marker assignments were reported in Additional Files 13
and 14. EST and type I gene markers that did not find an
acceptable homology match following BLASTN searches
were further queried to subject model genome databases
using TBLASTX. Criteria similar to the BLASTN searches
were adopted. Matches obtained with this search parameter were, however, in many instances non-confirmatory
(i.e., homology assignments for the query sequence
would often be made to a linkage group other than the
linkage group composing the surrounding synteny block
assignment for multiple additional BLASTN assigned
markers). This is most likely due to the fact that many of
the query genes belong to gene families possessing many
multiple closely related gene copies. Hence assignments
to alternate linkage groups may be an expectation when
using translated amino acid string queries.

were downloaded from the UCSC website [34]. The
number of hits reported within each chromosome was
simply added across all annotation classes of DNA, LINE,
SINE and LTR. The total sequence length of each medaka
chromosome was then divided by the total number of
transposable element assignments to obtain an overall
chromosome estimate of the average bp interval between
site insertions.

Information on the assignment of ancestral proto-Actinopterygian linkage groups within the genomes of
zebrafish and medaka were obtained from the Kasahara et
al. study [20]. Thirteen putative ancestral linkage groups
were postulated to have given rise all the extant teleost
genome structures, with the 13th linkage group (M)
present in triplicate (following a single chromosome
duplication) shortly following the origin of the ray-finned
fishes. Each ancestral grouping should exhibit extensive
homology to a minimum of two linkage groups within
extant 3R derivative teleosts. Due to rearrangements
within the genomes of these species, multiple smaller
linkage group affinities are also evident for certain ancestral groups. The available data summarized in Table 1
shows the affinities of these ancestral groupings within
zebrafish and medaka chromosomes. Doubly conserved
synteny blocks with the 3R species were used to infer
homology blocks to the ancestral chromosomes using
either rainbow trout or Atlantic salmon as the reference
species. Cross-referencing of the reciprocal salmonid linkage group homology blocks were also used to help reciprocally verify the ancestral assignments (see Table 1,
Figure 1, Additional File 13, and Additional File 14). In
other words, if an ancestral assignment to a particular
rainbow trout linkage group arm was given, and this arm
demonstrated extensive homology to an Atlantic salmon
arm segment, the assignment of the Atlantic salmon arm
segment to the same ancestral grouping was verified.

Authors' contributions

Transposon analysis
Data for the salmonid Tc1/Mariner elements were
obtained from the de Boer et al. study [33] along with
sequence information downloaded from the NCBI website using key word searches filtered according to salmonid-specific sequences. Repeat Masker [37] data files
specific for a search within each medaka chromosome

Designation of chromosome arms
Within metacentric chromosomes we adopt the notation
that short arms are designated as 'p' arms, while the long
arm within each chromosome is designated as the 'q' arm.
For fused Atlantic salmon chromosome arms, the segment
closest to the centromere is designated as 'a' and more distal segments are designated as 'b' and 'c' [21]. These occur
within the long arm of each linkage group and thus the
segments are designated qa, qb, and in one instance qc.

RGD carried out the bioinformatics analysis and wrote the
manuscript, and along with MMF and WSD helped organize the conceptual framework of the manuscript. EAD,
KG, KL, HKM and JP helped with development and genotyping of EST and BAC-end sequence markers, along with
BH for many of the SSR markers. RBP helped with the
interpretation of chromosome arm assignments related to
short/long arm designations. BFK and SL contributed
information on the Atlantic salmon SNP markers. All
authors read and commented on the manuscript.
