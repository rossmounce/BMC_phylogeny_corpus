Abstract
Background: The genomes of an increasing number of species are being investigated through
generation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). However, ESTs are prone to sequencing errors and
typically define incomplete transcripts, making downstream annotation difficult. Annotation would
be greatly improved with robust polypeptide translations. Many current solutions for EST
translation require a large number of full-length gene sequences for training purposes, a resource
that is not available for the majority of EST projects.
Results: As part of our ongoing EST programs investigating these "neglected" genomes, we have
developed a polypeptide prediction pipeline, prot4EST. It incorporates freely available software to
produce final translations that are more accurate than those derived from any single method. We
show that this integrated approach goes a long way to overcoming the deficit in training data.
Conclusions: prot4EST provides a portable EST translation solution and can be usefully applied
to >95% of EST projects to improve downstream annotation. It is freely available from http://
www.nematodes.org/PartiGene.

Background
The need for more sequence
Complete genome sequencing is a major investment and
is unlikely to be applied to the vast majority of organisms,
whatever their importance in terms of evolution, health or
ecology. Complete genome sequences are available for
only a few eukaryote genomes, most of which are model
organisms. The focus of eukaryote genome sequencing
has been on a restricted subset of known diversity, with,
for example, nearly half of the completed or draft stage
genomes being from vertebrates. While Arthropoda and
Nematoda have two completed genomes each, with a
dozen others in progress, compared to predicted diversity
(over a million species each) current genome sequencing
illuminates only small parts of even these phyla. The dis-

parity between sequence data and motivation for biological study is significant. Allied to this bias in genome
sequence is a bias in functional annotation for the derived
proteomes: a vertebrate gene is more likely to have been
assigned a function due to the focus of biomedical
research on humans and closely related model species
such as mouse [1].
Shotgun sample sequencing of additional genomes
through expressed sequence tags (EST) or genome survey
sequences (GSS) has proved to be a cost-effective and
rapid method of identifying a significant proportion of
the genes of a target organism. Thus many genome initiatives on non-traditional model organisms have utilised
EST and GSS strategies to gain an insight into "wild"

biology. An EST strategy does not yield sequence for all of
the expressed genes of an organism, because some genes
may not be expressed under the conditions sampled, and
others may be expressed at very low levels and missed
through the random sampling that underlies the strategy.
However the creation of EST libraries from a range of conditions, such as different developmental stages or environmental exposures, promotes a closer examination of
the biology of these species.
The well documented phylogenetic sequence deficit [2]
has led us to coin the term "neglected genomes". Cur-

rently many groups are sequencing ESTs from their chosen species to perform studies in a wide-range of
disciplines, from comparative ecotoxicology [3] to highthroughput detection of sequence polymorphisms [4,5].
The contribution of EST projects for neglected but biologically relevant organisms is highlighted in Figure 1. As
with all sequence data, obtaining high quality annotation
requires prior information and is labour intensive. The
"partial genome" information that results from EST datasets presents special problems for annotation, and we are
developing tools for this task.

The need for high quality translation
The PartiGene software suite [6] simplifies the analysis of
partial genomes. ESTs are clustered into putative genes
and consensuses determined. All the data is stored in a
relational database, allowing it to be searched easily.
While preliminary annotation based on BLAST analysis of
nucleotide sequence can be performed, more robust
methods are needed to allow high-quality analysis. The
error-prone nature of ESTs makes application of most
annotation tools difficult. To improve annotation, and
facilitate further exploitation, a crucial step is the robust
translation of the EST or consensus to yield predicted
polypeptides. The polypeptide sequences present a better
template for almost all annotation, including InterPro [7]
and Pfam [8], as well as the construction of more accurate
multiple sequence alignments, and the creation of protein-mass fingerprint libraries for proteomics exploitation. High quality polypeptide predictions can be applied
to functional annotation and post-genomic study in a
similar way to those available for completed genomes.
Translating Expressed Sequence Tags
Prediction of the correct polypeptide from ESTs is not
trivial:

1. The inherent low quality of EST sequences may result in
shifts in the reading frame (missing or inserted bases) or
ambiguous bases. These errors impede the correct recognition of coding regions. The initiation site may be lost, or
an erroneous stop codon introduced to the putative
translation.
2. ESTs are often partial segments of a mRNA, and as most
cloning technology biases representation to the internal
parts of genes, the initiation methionine codon may be
missed. This is a problem for some of the de novo programs which use the initiation methionine to identify the
coding region (described below).
Sequence quality can be improved by clustering the
sequences based on identity. For each cluster a consensus
can be determined [9]. This approach, however, will not
address the whole problem as poor quality EST sequences
may not yield high quality consensuses and for smaller
volume projects, most genes have a single EST representative. Therefore additional methods must be applied to
provide accurate polypeptide predictions.
Similarity-based methods
A robust method to determine the correct encoded
polypeptide is to map a nucleotide sequence onto a
known protein. This concept is the basis for BLASTX [10],
FASTX [11] and ProtEST [12]. BLASTX and FASTX use the
six frame translation of a nucleotide sequence to seed a
search of a protein database. The alignments generated for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/187

each significant hit provide an accurately translated region
of the EST. BLASTX is extremely rapid, but the presence of
a frameshift terminates each individual local alignment,
ending the polypeptide prematurely. FASTX is able to
identify possible frameshifts, but its dynamic programming approach is significantly slower than BLASTX. These
methods require that the nucleotide sequence shares
detectable similarity with a protein in the selected database. Many genes from both well studied and neglected
genomes do not share detectable similarity to other
known proteins. For example, the latest analysis of the
Caenorhabditis elegans proteome shows that only ~50% of
the 22000 predictions contain Pfam-annotated protein
domains [8,13], and 40% share no significant similarity
with non-nematode proteins in the SwissProt/trEMBL
database [14]. This feature is not unique to the phylum
Nematoda, and is likely perhaps to be more extreme for
neglected genomes, given the phylogenetic bias of most
protein databases.
ProtEST uses a slightly different similarity-based approach
[12]. A protein sequence is compared to an EST database.
phrap [9] is used to construct a consensus sequence from
the ESTs found to have significant similarity. These consensuses are then compared to the original sequence using
ESTWISE (E. Birney, unpublished [15]) giving a maximum likelihood position for possible frameshifts. The
system is accurate but is not readily adaptable to the highthroughput approach necessary when dealing with very
large numbers of ESTs. More crucially, an EST that does
not show significant similarity to a known protein is not
translated.
'de novo' predictions
To overcome the reliance upon sequence similarity, de
novo approaches based on recognition of potential coding
regions within poor quality sequences, reconstruction of
the coding regions in their correct frame, and discrimination between ESTs with coding potential and those
derived from non-coding regions have been developed
[16-18].

DIANA-EST [16], combines three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), developed to identify the transcription initiation site and the coding region with potential
frameshifts. ESTScan2 [18] combines three hidden
Markov models trained to be error tolerant in their representations of mRNA structure (modelling the 5' and 3'
untranslated regions, initiation methionine and coding
region). DECODER [17] uses an essentially rule-based
method for identifying possible insertions and deletions
in the nucleotide sequence, as well as the most likely initiation site, and was developed for complete cDNA
sequence translation.

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:187

Each of these methods has different strengths in their
attempt to identify the precise coding region; all require
prior data to train their models. Published descriptions of
their utility are based on training with human full length
coding sequences (mRNAs), and thus tens of thousands of
training sequences (many million coding nucleotides)
were used to achieve optimum results. As stressed above,
this amount of prior data is not available for the vast
majority of EST project species (Figure 1).
New solution â prot4EST
Prior to this project, nematode ESTs available through
NEMBASE [19] had been translated using DECODER, as a
preliminary study had suggested that it outperformed the
other available methods (DIANA-EST and ESTScan1 [20])
(Parkinson pers. com.). 7388 out of the 40000 resulting
predicted polypeptides were likely to be poorly translated
(<30 amino acids), and we suspected many more contained errors. This motivated the creation of a solution
using several methods to enhance the quality of the
polypeptide predictions, exploiting their strengths while
recognising their short-comings. prot4EST is an EST translation pipeline, written in Perl, with a user-friendly interface, that links some of these described methods together.
It carries out retrieval and formatting of files from online
databases for the user. It has been designed to be used as
a stand-alone tool, or as an integral part of the PartiGene
process [6].

Implementation
DECODER
The DECODER program [17] was developed to define
start codons and open reading frames in full-length cDNA
sequences. It exploits the quality scores for the sequence
produced from base-calling software, such as phred
[21,22], and additional text-based information to identify
all possible coding regions. In regions of low sequence
quality up to 2 nucleotides are removed or inserted, representing possible frameshifts. A likelihood score is calculated for each possible coding sequence (CDS), and the
one with the lowest score is chosen as the correct CDS.
The score is computed from the probability of generating
a random sequence with a better Kozak consensus (the
nucleotide sequence surrounding the initiation codon of
a eukaryotic mRNA), ATG position and codon usage.
DECODER requires a codon bias table, which is used to
determine the putative coding regions optimal codon
usage. A penalty term limits the number of insertions/
deletions in the corrected CDS.
ESTScan2.0
Hidden Markov models (HMM) can represent known
sequence composition in a probabilistic manner [23].
This has been exploited recently in applications to find
genes in genomic sequence [24,25], predict domain com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/187

position in protein sequences [26], and align multiple
sequences [27]. ESTScan [18] exploits the predictive
power of Hidden Markov models by combining three
models:
1. Modeling mRNA structure: ESTScan separates the probable CDS from the untranslated regions (UTRs). The core
of the coding sequence is represented by a 3-periodic
inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. Flanking this
core model are start and stop profiles for the codons
observed at these positions. The profiles for untranslated
regions flank the start and stop states.
2. Error tolerance: ESTScan allows insertions and deletions (indels) in the EST sequence. For example, if it is
more probable that a particular nucleotide is the result of
an insertion event then it is omitted from the 'corrected'
sequence. Conversely, if the HMM probability scores suggest that a nucleotide has been deleted then the model
inserts an X into the 'corrected' sequence to denote this
prediction.
3. EST structure: ESTScan recognises that the EST may be
composed of a combination of 5' UTR, CDS and 3' UTR.
ESTScan's hidden Markov models are trained using complete CDS entries from either the EMBL or RefSeq databases. Scripts included with the distribution parse the data
files, extracting the necessary sequence information to
produce the model files. The major issue considered at
this point is redundancy. If the training data is internally
redundant then the resultant model will be fully successful only in finding what is known and will have reduced
power in detecting novel transcripts. Default parameters
were used in ESTScan for building the HMM and in predicting polypeptides.
HSP tiling
The BLASTX program [10] allows a nucleotide sequence to
be searched against a protein database. The nucleotide
query is translated in all six frames and these are used as
the query sequences for a BLASTP search. High scoring
segment pairs (HSP) are identified that maximise a bit
score derived from an amino acid similarity matrix. If a
single indel occurs in the nucleotide sequence, causing a
frameshift, the HSP is either terminated at this position or
continues out of frame. Downstream of this frameshift the
query sequence may be long enough to result in another
significant HSP to the same protein sequence, this time in
a different frame. Simple extraction of the best BLAST HSP
will miss such features. prot4EST implements a rule-based
method that considers all the HSPs for a match to a database sequence and considers whether a frameshift can be
identified. Where a frameshift is identified the HSPs are

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:187

joined. Where two HSPs overlap the sequence with the
better bit score is used.
The prot4EST pipeline
prot4EST is an integrated pipeline utilising freely available
software in a tiered, rule-based system (Figure 2).
Tier 1: Identification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes
The protein databases contain (probably spurious) translations of ribosomal RNA genes and gene fragments, and
thus it is important to identify and remove putative rRNA
derived sequences before further processing. A BLASTN
search is performed against a database of rRNA sequences
obtained from the Ribosomal Database II (Table 1; [28]).
A BLAST expect value cutoff of e-65 is used to identify
matches. The cutoff is a conservative one to reduce the
number of false positives. Those nucleotide sequences
with significant matches are annotated as rRNA genes and
take no further part in the translation process.
Tiers 2 and 3: Similarity search
The second and third stages are similar. First a BLASTX
search is performed against proteins encoded by mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial protein database
is obtained from the NCBI ftp site (Table 1). Any
sequences with significant hits (cutoff e-8) are annotated
as mitochondrion-encoded genes for the remainder of the
process, and the relevant mitochondrial genetic code is
used for translation. Sequences that do not have significant similarity to mitochondrial proteins are compared
using BLASTX to the SwissProt database [14]. Sequences
that yield no significant similarity are moved onto tier 4
of the process.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/187

Tier 5: DECODER prediction
The DECODER program is used to predict CDS and thus
polypeptide translations for the remaining nucleotide
sequences. For each sequence a quality file in phrap format is required. When a quality file is unavailable a file
with quality values of 15 is generated for each sequence.
The codon usage table required by DECODER can be
specified by the user or downloaded from CUTG, the
codon usage table database [29]. By default DECODER
only processes the forward strand of each sequence, and
therefore the reverse complement of each sequence is
taken and processed through DECODER. Two putative
polypeptides are generated for each nucleotide sequence.
The longer polypeptide is selected as the more probable
translation. The polypeptide predictions are checked
using the same length threshold criteria as for ESTScan
(above).
Tier 6: Longest ORF
This last attempt to provide a putative polypeptide translation determines the longest string of amino acids uninterrupted by stop codons from a six-frame translation of
the sequence. If a methionine is present in this string it is
flagged as a potential initiation site.

Output
The primary output from prot4EST consists of the putative
polypeptides in FASTA format, complemented with files
containing information describing the translated
sequences. This information includes:
position of the translation with respect to the nucleotide
sequence, the genetic code used for translation,

For those sequences that show significant similarity to a
protein sequence from either database a HSP tile path is
constructed. prot4EST then considers whether the nascent
translation can be extended at either end in the same reading frame.

position and BLAST statistics of HSPs used in the tile path.

Tier 4: ESTScan prediction
The hidden Markov models used by ESTScan to identify
the coding region are constructed from EMBL format files
for complete CDS using scripts supplied with the package.
Preprocessing is integrated within prot4EST, including the
downloading of the EMBL files. A pair of length threshold
criteria are applied to each putative polypeptide before it
is accepted. The open reading frame must be at least 30
codons in length, and cover at least 10% of the input
sequence. Polypeptides that satisfy these criteria undergo
the extension process described above, sequences that fail
any of the criteria are passed onto the next tier. The extension process is carried out on those sequences that exceed
the thresholds.

Speed

All this additional information is stored in two CSV format files, permitting parsing and simple insertion into a
database.

This is highly dependent upon the composition and size
of the dataset. As a guide, each prot4EST run carried out in
the benchmarking (below), took less than an hour for a
2316-sequence input with an Athlon 1400 Mhz processor.
The BLASTX searches were carried out separately and used
as input to prot4EST (for details see the userguide, availabile from the program web page).

Benchmarking EST translation methods
We benchmarked five translation methods to test their relative performance. DECODER is designed to consider
only the forward strand of the nucleotide sequence, as it
was originally designed for full-length CDSs. When
applied to ESTs it is imperative that both strands are

the reverse complement of each nucleotide consensus was
also analysed. DECODER_default (1) considers only the

whilst
DECODER_best (2) uses the more accurate prediction.
ESTScan (3) considers both strands of the nucleotide
sequence, and was run as a stand-alone process with

Two arrangements of components within prot4EST were
tested. prot4EST_ed (4) implements ESTScan before using
DECODER on any remaining untranslated sequences.
Conversely, prot4EST_de (5) uses DECODER first followed by ESTScan. The DECODER module in prot4EST
considers translations on both the foward and reverse
strands of the query sequence.
1 Data Sets
Test EST dataset for translation
We randomly selected 4000 Caenorhabditis elegans ESTs
from dbEST [30]. To reduce redundancy, the ESTs were
clustered using CLOBB [31]. phrap [9] was then used to
derive a consensus sequence for each cluster. This resulted
in 2899 nucleotide sequences. To ensure that the
consensuses corresponded to a coding region, we carried
out a BLASTN search for each consensus against the complete C. elegans cDNA dataset available from Wormbase
(version 117) [32]. Significant matches were found for
2372 consensuses. Finally, this set was used to query the
C. elegans protein dataset (Wormpep version 117), thus
associating each nucleotide sequence with a corresponding reference polypeptide. A final test set of 2316 consensus sequences was produced.
Training datasets
1: Caenorhabditis elegans
Both ESTScan and DECODER require prior gene
sequence. The C. elegans RefSeq collection was obtained,
comprising 21033 entries (December 2003; [33]). A Perl
script constructed random training sets giving differing
totals of coding nucleotides from 10000 to 350000. Four
sets were assembled for each level. The build_tables script
(part of the ESTScan package) was used to filter out
sequences [18].

We used the same training sets to build the codon usage
tables required by DECODER. CUSP from EMBOSS [34]
was used to build the tables, and a separate Perl script
written to convert the output to that required by
DECODER. For any given run of prot4EST the ESTScan
HMM training set and codon usage table used were
derived from the same training set of C. elegans cDNAs.
2: Prokaryote genomes
GenBank entries from 167 complete prokaryote genomes
were obtained (May 2004). A Perl script was written to
extract the CDS entries and construct a RefSeq-style
resource for each prokaryote species (available upon
request). If a taxon's genome consisted of more than one
megaplasmid the sequences were combined. CDS annotation was not available for 11 genomes. We used the CDS
collections for the 156 taxa to determine AT content, construct hidden Markov models and codon usage tables.
3: Arabidopsis thaliana
28960 complete CDS entries for A. thaliana were obtained
from the RefSeq database [35].
4: Spirurida (Nematoda)
We queried GenBank for all complete CDS entries from
species in the nematode order Spirurida.
BLAST databases
SwissProt (release 42.7) and TrEMBL (release 25.7) [14]
were combined to give a SwissAll database. To recreate the
situation facing neglected genome analysis, the accession
numbers for all proteins from species in the nematode
orderRhabditida were retrieved from the NEWT taxonomic database [36] and these entries (~23000) were
removed from SwissAll.
2 Data collection and analysis
Comparison of predicted polypeptides to the 'true' polypeptide
We compared each putative polypeptide predicted from
the C. elegans test dataset to its cognate reference protein
using bl2seq from the NCBI distribution. Default parameters were used except for the theoretical database size (d), set to 130000, the size of SwissProt. The blast reports
were parsed using BioPerl modules [37]. Each C. elegans

Page 7 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:187

reference protein sequence was also compared to itself
using bl2seq with default parameters. The raw and bit
scores were recorded.
Calculation of comparison statistics
The raw and bit scores were normalised for length and
against their theoretical maximum using equation 1,
where:

BITlocal is the bit score of the local alignment between the
predicted polypeptide and its cognate reference protein,
BITmax is the bit score for the alignment between the reference protein and its self,
WPlength is the length of the wormpep protein that is the
reference of the nucleotide consensus translated,
ESTlength is the length of the nucleotide consensus that
has been translated.

Normalised Bit Score =

BITlocal 3 Ã WPlength
Ã(
)
BITmax
ESTlength

(equation 1)

Results and discussion
To measure the accuracy of translation two statistics were
derived from the comparison of the predicted and reference polypeptides. The coverage is the percentage of the
predicted polypeptide that aligns with the reference. The
bit score represents the total of the alignment's pair-wise
scores, normalised with respect to the substitution matrix
used to calculate these scores. In this study the bit score
was itself normalised to compensate for EST length and
the maximum possible bit score for each comparison (see
Methods, equation 1). The number of consensuses translated that had a significant match to their cognate reference C. elegans protein was also recorded for each run.
The influence of number of training codons
Both variants of DECODER were unable to produce
robust translations for over half the nucleotide sequences
no matter how many nucleotides were in the training set
(Figure 3). As expected, the inclusion of the reverse complement in the DECODER analysis improved its performance. The inability of DECODER to translate more than
50% of the polypeptides can be traced to its core assumptions. One criterion used is the determination of the most
likely initiation methionine. While this is almost always
present in full length cDNAs (for which it was designed),
the occurrence of any ATG codon in EST consensuses is
less certain. We noted that DECODER will try any ATG
codon to start its prediction, even if this results in a
polypeptide of 2 amino acids in length.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/187

The effect of the number of training nucleotides on ESTScan performance is pronounced. For the majority of the
replicates, at each training set size the fraction of predictions that have significant matches to their reference
sequence was around 75%, but the number of translations dropped significantly below 250000 training nucleotides. However, for 10000 coding nucleotides or less no
robust translations are produced. Additionally, there was
variance in the performance of ESTScan when there were
between 20000 and 50000 training nucleotides. Examination of these training sets showed no difference in AT content compared to larger training sets, but did suggest that
fluctuations in codon usage bias might be involved. The
replicates that performed less well comprised sequences
with shorter mean length, and had codon biases that were
at the extremes of the distribution (not shown). This variation in sequence composition clearly has an effect on the
probabilities that populate the HMM used by ESTScan.
We suspect that the ability of ESTScan to predict robust
translations when trained by datasets of 150000 to
200000 coding nucleotides is inflated as a consequence of
the random selection of the training set from the complete
C. elegans transcriptome. In a genuine situation, when
only a small number of full-length CDS exist in the public
databases, a significant number will be from highly
expressed genes with atypical codon bias and structure.
This bias will be evident in real-world CDS sets with fewer
than
200
members
(150000â200000
coding
nucleotides).
When the training sets contained a large number of nonredundant coding nucleotides (> 150000), prot4EST_ed
and ESTScan performed equally well (Figure 3a). When
the number of coding nucleotides available for training
and codon bias determination were reduced, prot4EST
translations still showed significant similarity to the correct protein in at least 80% of instances.
The translations produced by prot4EST_ed were the most
robust across all totals of coding nucleotides, for both coverage and bit score (Figures 3b & 3c). As the number of
coding nucleotides used in training decreased, both measures showed slight reductions.
Performance of alternative prot4EST architectures
prot4EST_ed produced more robust translations for
higher numbers of training sequences. However when
smaller totals of training nucleotides were used the translations produced by the alternative architecture,
prot4EST_de, were slightly better (Figure 3c), although a
smaller proportion of translations were produced with
this setup (Figure 3a).

Performance of polypeptide prediction methods under different training regimes
Performance of polypeptide prediction methods under different training regimes. Predicted polypeptides were compared to
their reference. Four independent replicates of each training set size were used. a) Proportion of predicted polypeptide peptides having a significant BLASTP match to their reference protein. b) The mean proportion of each sequence covered by a
predicted polypeptide. c) The mean relative bit score of each predicted polypeptide compared to its reference protein. The
scores in b) and c) are the mean of the sequences translated by each method. The high scores shown by ESTScan at 5000 and
10000 non-redundant coding nucleotides is due to the method returning at most one polypeptide out of the 2316 nucleotides
provided.

DECODER translations were used in preference to those from ESTScan.

The better performance of prot4EST_ed was examined by
following the fate of individual test sequences through the
prot4EST pipeline. By employing ESTScan before
DECODER, larger training sets allowed the deployment of
well trained HMMs (Figure 4). All predictions satisfied
length and quality filters, and so were accepted as robust.
The corresponding DECODER predictions, while satisfying length filters, were not as robust. As the training sets
decreased in size, the ESTScan predictions failed the filters
and so were ignored, and DECODER used instead.
Performance of similarity search
Seven sequences out of 2316 were identified as rRNA in
tier 1. Tiers 2 and 3 of the prot4EST pipeline exploit any
significant sequence similarity between the query

sequence and known proteins for coding region determination. This approach identified coding regions from just
under half of the consensuses, 1131. Nineteen were identified as mitochondrial genome derived. To benchmark
the similarity approach against the other probabilistic
methods, the accuracy of predictions from 1131 consensuses were compared. Translations derived from prot4EST
tiers 2 and 3 were more robust than those from ESTScan
or DECODER (Figure 5).
Given that an increase in the number of non-redundant
coding nucleotides used to train ESTScan produces more
robust translations, we attempted to use coding regions
determined thus far to create larger training sets, with the
expectation of improved translations. The results from the

BLASTX search against the SwissAll database were checked
for matches where the alignment included the start of the
protein sequence. These results contained the information
required to construct pseudo-CDS entries which can be
added to the training set for populating the HMMs of ESTScan. In this study there were only six BLASTX alignments
that provided suitable pseudo-CDS, failing to provide any
significant increase in the level of non-redundant coding
nucleotides. However other species we study have produced higher numbers of pseudo-CDS which prot4EST
uses to give improved translations (data not shown).
Effect of training set and target set sequence composition
As a significant proportion of any EST set will not share
similarity with known sequences, de novo translation
methods need to be trained to as high a level as possible.
The question is how this should be done, given the pau-

city of prior sequence data for individual species. Should
CDS from species considered phylogenetically related be
combined or should a large set from a model organism be
used? A recent study of gene finding in novel genomes has
shown a significant effect of sequence composition upon
gene structure prediction, with more closely related model
genomes providing poor training if the codon bias differs
significantly from the genome of interest [25]. The performance of ESTScan was affected by even slight fluctuations in sequence composition. We examined the effect of
AT content on the accuracy of translation. The complete
CDS complements of 156 prokaryotes were assembled as
described in the Methods. This gave a range of AT contents
from 28% (Streptomyces coelicolor) to 78% (Wigglesworthia
glossinidia), independent of any bias due the organisms'
relatedness to C. elegans. The lowest number of nonredundant coding nucleotides was 461,299, in excess of

the minimum number suggested for robust training. To
explore datasets from more closely related sources all
available CDS entries for the nematode order Spirurida
(last common ancestor with C. elegans was 475â500 MYA
[38]), and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana [39] were
obtained.
There was a significant correlation between AT content of
the training set and the coverage by the putative
polypeptides of their reference C. elegans proteins (r =
0.49 P > 0.001) (Figure 6). The most robust predictions
were produced by HMMs trained on datasets with an AT
content similar to that of C. elegans. For the prokaryote

training sets, the number of nucleotides used had no significant effect upon performance (data not shown). We
note that some prokaryote training sets with AT contents
close to C. elegans performed poorly: homogeneity of AT
content is thus not a panacea. The best performance was
obtained using the A. thaliana training set, with significantly better coverage than achieved with the more closely
related Spirurida. As the plant dataset contained 130
times as many coding nucleotides as did the Spirurida
training set, four random A. thaliana training sets of comparable size to the Spirurida were built. These smaller
training sets still performed better than the Spirurida
training set, though not as well as the full CDS collection.

Conclusions
prot4EST is a protein translation pipeline that utilises the
advantages of a number of publicly available tools. We
have shown that it produces significantly more robust
translations than single methods for species with little or
no prior sequence data. Around three quarters of current
EST projects are associated with training sets of < 50000
coding nucleotides (Figure 1). Thus prot4EST offers significant improvement in this real world situation. Even with
substantial numbers of coding nucleotides, the use of similarity searches means prot4EST is able to outperform the
best de novo methods. Given the increase in protein
sequences submitted to SwissProt/TrEMBL, prot4EST's
ability and accuracy can only increase over time. These
more accurate translations provide the platform for more
rigorous down-stream annotation. Currently we are using
the prot4EST pipeline to translate ~95000 nematode consensus sequences from 30 species. These translations will
then be passed onto other tools we are developing for EST
analysis and annotation (see http://www.nematodes.org/
PartiGene).
