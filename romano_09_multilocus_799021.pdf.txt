Abstract
Background: Ochrobactrum anthropi is a versatile bacterial species with strains living in very
diverse habitats. It is increasingly recognized as opportunistic pathogen in hospitalized patients. The
population biology of the species particularly with regard to the characteristics of the human
isolates is being investigated. To address this issue, we proposed a polyphasic approach consisting
in Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), multi-locus phylogeny, genomic-based fingerprinting by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antibiotyping.
Results: We tested a population of 70 O. anthropi clinical (n = 43) and environmental (n = 24)
isolates as well as the type strain O. anthropi ATCC49188T and 2 strains of Ochrobactrum lupini and
Ochrobactrum cytisi isolated from plant nodules. A Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme for
O. anthropi is proposed here for the first time. It was based on 7 genes (3490 nucleotides) evolving
mostly by neutral mutations. The MLST approach suggested an epidemic population structure. A
major clonal complex corresponded to a human-associated lineage since it exclusively contained
clinical isolates. Genomic fingerprinting separated isolates displaying the same sequence type but it
did not detect a population structure that could be related to the origin of the strains. None of the
molecular method allowed the definition of particular lineages associated to the host-bacteria
relationship (carriage, colonisation or infection). Antibiotyping was the least discriminative method.
Conclusion: The results reveal a human-associated subpopulation in our collection of strains. The
emergence of this clonal complex was probably not driven by the antibiotic selective pressure.
Therefore, we hypothesise that the versatile species O. anthropi could be considered as a humanspecialized opportunistic pathogen.

Background
Ochrobactrum anthropi is a highly versatile alphaproteobacterium with ability to colonize an exceptionally wide
variety of habitats, from hostile environments such as polluted soil [1,2], to plants [2], nematodes [3], insects [4],
animals [5] and man [6]. Two other species, Ochrobactrum
lupini and Ochrobactrum cytisi, have been isolated from
leguminosae nodules [7,8] and were genetically undistinguishable from O. anthropi [9,10]. The 10 other species of
the genus Ochrobactrum [11] could be discriminated on
the basis of 16S rDNA sequences but this marker was too
conserved to allow a study of interrelationships among
each species [9]. According to their habitat and/or to the
relationships with their host, the population structure of
O. anthropi varied. For example, biological and genomic
microdiversity was higher in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere [12,13]. Authors related this difference in diversity
level to the expansion of clones adapted to metabolites
produced by rhizoredeposition [13]. Human clinical isolates of O. anthropi appeared diverse when analyzed by
Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) [14], rep-PCR
[13] and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing
[15].
Opportunistic infections and nosocomial outbreaks due
to O. anthropi have been increasingly reported during the
last decade, particularly in patients with indwelling
devices [16], in dialysis [17] or after surgery [18]. O.
anthropi was described as one of the Gram-negative rods
most resistant to common antibiotics. It resists particularly to all β-lactams, except imipenem by production of
an AmpC β-lactamase, OCH-1, described as chromosomal, inducible, and resistant to inhibition by clavulanic
acid [19]. As the virulence of O. anthropi appeared to be
low, its resistance to antimicrobial agents could be the
major feature explaining its increasing role in human
infectious diseases. However, some case reports suggested
higher virulence for some strains, which are capable of
producing pyogenic monomicrobial infections [20] or
life-threatening infections such as endocarditis [21]. In
addition, the genome of the type strain O. anthropi ATCC
49188T has been recently sequenced and contains a com-

plete homolog of the virB operon (accession number:
CP000758) on the large chromosome of the bipartite
genome. This operon is the major determinant of the virulence of alpha-proteobacteriarelated to the genus Ochrobactrum. In Brucella spp., it allows the intra-macrophagic
survival and multiplication of the bacterium [22]. It is also
the main support for DNA transfer and for phytopathogenicity in Agrobacterium tumefaciens [23]. In the case of
opportunistic pathogens, which generally do not fully
respond to Koch's postulate, the link between virulencerelated genes and infection is not clearly established. For
example, opportunistic Escherichia coli involved in bacteremia showed a different content of virulence genes
between strains, and the distribution of the virulencerelated genes was independent of the host [24]. In contrast, MLST based on sequences of housekeeping genes
sequences provides evidence for positive correlation
between virulence, invasiveness and clonal origin of the E.
coli strains [24]. Therefore, the behaviour of opportunistic
pathogens could be considered as a clonal adaptation to
human ecology. There is evidence that sequence clusters
for a given gene can correspond to ecologically distinct
populations, even for genes not related to the adaptative
divergence between populations [25,26].
We investigated the existence of human-adapted subpopulations of O. anthropi by the study of its population structure using multi-locus housekeeping genotyping. We used
genomic fingerprinting by PFGE and antibiotyping to provide complementary data to support MLST interpretation.

Methods
Bacterial strains
The 70 strains studied were described in Table 1 and Table
2. Fourty-three strains were clinical isolates. Among them
33 were obtained from patients hospitalized in 5 French
hospitals in Montpellier, Nîmes (south-eastern France),
Clermont-Ferrand (central France), Nancy (north-eastern
France) and Toulouse (south-central France) from 1998
to 2007 and in Denmark. Ten collection strains isolated
from man in Europe and the United States were also
included as well as O. anthropi ATCC 49188T. The isolates

were representative of different host-bacteria relationships, carriage or colonization without clinical symptoms
or infection. Twenty-four environmental strains were
from diverse origins, including water, soil, rhizophere,
nematodes and industrial processes. The type strain of the
species O. cytisi and a reference strain of O. lupini were also
included. The affiliation of the isolates to O. anthropi was
assessed as previously described [6]. Briefly, urease production and colistin, tobramicin and netilmicin susceptibility determined by disk diffusion assay gave
presumptive identification of the species O. anthropi. The
identification was confirmed by rrs (16S rDNA) [10] and
recA sequencing [9].
Antibiotyping
The antimicrobial susceptibility profile was determined
by the disk-diffusion assay on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar
and interpreted according to the guidelines of the Comité
de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologie [27]. Antibiotics disks used (BioRad, Marne-laCoquette, France) were as follows: amoxicillin (25 μg),
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 μg/10 μg), ticarcillin (75
μg), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (75 μg/10 μg), piperacillin
(75 μg), piperacillin/tazobactam (75 μg/10 μg), imipenem (10 μg), cefalotin (30 μg), cefoxitine (30 μg), cefpodoxime (30 μg), cefotaxime (30 μg), ceftazidime (30

μg), cefpirome (30 μg), cefepime (30 μg), moxalactam
(30 μg), aztreonam (30 μg), gentamicin (10 UI), tobramycin (10 μg), netilmicin (30 μg), amikacin (30 μg), isepamicin (30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), levofloxacin (30 μg),
ofloxacin (5 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), tetracycline (30
μg), fosfomycin (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25 μg/23.75 μg).
PFGE-RFLP (Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis - RFLP)
Genomic DNA was prepared in agarose plugs as previously described [28] and digested at 37°C with 40 U of
SpeI (New England Biolabs). SpeI fragments were separated by PFGE using a CHEF-DRII apparatus (Bio-Rad,
Laboratories) in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-BorateEDTA buffer (TBE) at 150 V and at 10°C. Pulse ramps
were 5 to 35 s for 35 h followed by 2 to 10 s for 10 h.
Molecular weight marker was a concatemer of phage l
(New England Biolabs). The strains were randomly distributed among the different gels. SpeI-digested DNAs
from strains ADV48 and ADV90 were respectively loaded
in the first and the last well on each gel in order to standardize the migration patterns. Fingerprinting profiles generated by PFGE were standardized with PhotoCapt®
software (Vilbert Lourmat). The automated band detection was visually checked. The profiles were scored for the
presence or absence of DNA bands. Restriction fragment

variability was determined by the Nei and Li distance
method modified by using the RESTDIST program in the
Phylip package v.3.66 [29]. Clustering was predicated by
the unweighted pair group average method (UPGMA)
using the SplitsTree v4.0 [30,31].
Gene amplification and sequencing
Genomic DNA was obtained using the Aquapure DNA
extraction kit (EpiCentre). Seven genes (dnaK, recA, rpoB,
trpE, aroC, omp25 and gap) were amplified using the primers shown in Table 3. PCR was carried out in 50 μL of reaction mixture containing 200 nM (each) primer (Sigma
Genosys), 200 μM (each) desoxy-nucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) (Euromedex), 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in the appropriate reaction buffer and 50
ng of genomic DNA as the template. Amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation of 3 min at
95°C followed by 35-cycles with 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at
60°C (for dnaK, rpoB recA and gap fragments) or 1 min at
65°C (for trpE, aroC and omp25 fragments) and 2 min 30
s at 72°C. The final extension was carried out at 72°C during 10 min. PCR products and molecular weight marker
(phage phiX DNA digested with HaeIII, New England
Biolabs) were separated in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5×
TBE buffer. Amplification products were sequenced in
both direction using forward and reverse sequencing
primers (Table 3) on an ABI 3730xl automatic sequencer
(Cogenics, France). The sequences were deposited to GenBank database with accession numbers: GQ429327 to
GQ429816.
Phylogenetic analysis
Gene sequences were codon-aligned using ClustalX after
translation with TRANSLATE http://www.expasy.org. The
size of the codon-aligned sequences used for further analyses is indicated in Table 3. For phylogenetic analysis,
concatenated sequences were re-aligned using ClustalW.
Evolutionary distance was analyzed using Phylip package
v3.66 [29] by Neighbor-Joining after distance matrix construction using DNADIST (F84 as substitution model).
Bootstrap values were calculated using SEQBOOT and
CONSENSE after 1000 reiterations. For Maximum likelihood (ML), the most appropriate substitution model
determined according to Akaike information criterion calculated with Modeltest (v3.7) [32] was GTR plus gamma
distribution and invariant sites. When gamma shape
parameters were estimated from the dataset, ML phylogenetic analysis was performed using PHYML v2.4.6 [33].
ML bootstrap support was computed using PhyML after
100 reiterations. The sequence of Brucella suis 1330T was
included in each phylogenetic analysis in order to place
an artificial tree root.
Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST)
The alignment obtained for phylogenetic treeing was used
for assigning the isolates to a sequence type (ST) number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/267

according to their allelic profiles with the help of the nonredundant databases program http://linux.mlst.net/nrdb/
nrdb.htm. A Minimum Spanning (MS) tree was constructed using Prim's algorithm to determine the links
among STs http://www.pubmlst.org. MS clonal complexes included STs that differed by 2 or less alleles. Allele
profiles were analysed using eBURST v3 software [34] to
determine clonal complexes defined as sets of related
strains that share at least five identical alleles at the 7 loci.
MS clonal complexes were named MSCC followed by the
ST number of the central ST in the tree. eBurst clonal complexes were named eBCC followed by the number of the
predicted founder ST. When the founder is unpredicted or
when the complex contained only 2 STs, the complex was
named by the most represented ST or by default by the ST
with the lower numbering. In both MS and eBURST analyses, the singleton (S) STs corresponded to STs differing
from every other ST at 3 or more of the 7 loci. A distance
matrix in nexus format was generated from the set of
allelic profiles and then used for decomposition analyses
with SplitsTree 4.0 software [30]. Program LIAN 3.1 [35]
was used to calculate the standardized IA (sIA) and to test
the null hypothesis of linkage disequilibrium as well as to
determine mean genetic diversity (H) and genetic diversity at each locus (h). The number of synonymous (dS)
and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions per site was
determined on codon-aligned sequences using SNAP software [36].

Results
Development of a MLST scheme for O. anthropi typing
Since MLST approaches have never been performed for
bacteria of the genus Ochrobactrum, we developed an original MLST scheme in this study. The choice of the seven
loci was done on the basis of the complete genome
sequence of O. anthropi ATCC 49188T (accession number:
CP000758). Amplification primers (Table 3) were
designed using the alignment of genes from O. anthropi
ATCC 49188T and its closest totally sequenced relatives
Brucella suis 1330T, Brucella melitensis 16M and Brucella
abortus 2308. We selected 6 genes encoding housekeeping
products involved in transcription (rpoB), DNA repair
(recA), stress response (dnaK), amino-acid biosynthesis
(aroC and trpE) and the glycolytic pathway (gap) (Table
3). They were frequently used in MLST because mutations
occurred slowly and were believed to be mostly neutral
[37]. The seventh gene, omp25, encoding an outer membrane protein, was supposed to be a more variable
marker. The selected loci were distributed as much as possible across the large chromosome of the bipartite genome
of O. anthropi to ensure the absence of physical links
between loci (Table 3). The MLST scheme showed
between 4.5% to 13.7% of polymorphic sites among
genes and a total of 235 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the 7 loci (Table 4). The mean genetic diversity
(H) among strains was 0.7083 +/- 0.0506 and the genetic

diversity at each locus (h) is given in Table 4. H in the clinical strains population (0.5959 +/- 0.0572) did not differ
significantly from H in the environmental population
(0.7301 +/- 0.0286), p = 0.11.
All gene fragments had equivalent mol% G+C contents
from 56.7% to 61.4% with a mean value of 58.9% that
was similar to the mean mol% G+C contents of the O.
anthropi chromosomes (56.1%). The genes involved in
amino-acid biosynthesis (aroC and trpE) appeared the
most polymorphic. The gene omp25 that codes for an antigenic surface protein displayed a relatively low level of
polymorphic sites (6.6%) but the highest genetic diversity
level (0.8327). The majority of SNPs in all loci were synonymous (Table 4). However, the omp25 locus displayed
the higher rate of non-synonymous SNPs versus synonymous SNPs. The non-synonymous mutations did not correspond to any premature stop codon.

MLST revealed a human-associated clonal complex
The MLST data set for the 70 strains contained 44 genotypes or sequences types (STs) (Tables 1 and 2). The largest ST were ST1, ST3, ST4, ST5 and ST32, which contained
7, 6, 6, 3 and 4 isolates, respectively. All the strains
belonging to ST3, ST4 and ST5 were clinical isolates
whereas ST1 and ST32 grouped strains from man and
environment. ST21, ST27 and ST35 corresponded to pairs
of geographically unrelated environmental strains, ST7
and ST15 to pairs of clinical strains and the remaining 34
STs corresponded to clinical (n = 22) and environmental
(n = 12) unique strains. The number of STs per strain did
not vary between the clinical (0.64) and the environmental population (0.61).

We constructed a minimum-spanning (MS) tree based on
clustering of the MLST profiles as a graphic representation
of the population structure (Fig. 1, Tables 1 and 2). In the

Most of the human clinical isolates (26/43) belonged to
MSCC4/eBCC4 that exclusively contained human strains
(Table 1; Fig. 1). The type strain of O. anthropi, for which
the human clinical origin is highly probable albeit
unproved [38], also belonged to this complex. The 17
other clinical strains were scattered in MSCC1/eBCC1
beside environmental strains or corresponded to MSCC11
or to singleton STs.

deposited twice on the gel to check reproducibility and to
help profiles comparison.

MS tree, strains formed two major MS clonal complexes
MSCC1 (19 strains of both human and environmental
origin, 9 STs) and MSCC4 (27 human strains, 13 STs) as
well as two minor complexes, MSCC11 (3 human strains,
3 STs) and MSCC33 (2 environmental strains, 2 STs).
Using eBURST software [34], the 44 STs were divided into
2 major clonal complexes, eBCC1 (23 strains of both
human and environmental origin; 13 STs; ST1 as predicted founder) and eBCC4 (27 human strains; 13 STs;
ST4 as predicted founder), 3 minor clonal complexes
eBCC31, eBCC21 and eBCC35 each including 3 strains
and 11 singleton STs (Tables 1 and 2).
MSCC4 and eBCC4 grouped the same strains and STs
(Table 1). MSCC1 grouped 18 strains out of the 23 associated to eBCC1. By MS analysis, the five remaining STs
grouped in eBCC1 belonged to MSCC11 (3 human
strains; ST2, ST11, ST40) or were singleton STs (ST12,
ST29). Other incongruence was observed between minor
clonal complexes detected by eBURST and MS treeing.
eBCC21 and eBCC35 were split in singleton STs in the MS
tree. MSCC33 grouped 2 strains out of the 3 forming
eBCC31.

The strains belonging to MSCC4/eBCC4 colonized or
infected diverse clinical sites. They were isolated in France
(different distant hospitals), Denmark, Sweden, United
Kingdom and USA between 1971 and 2007, suggesting
that their clustering in the same complex did not reflect
cross contamination or spread among a restricted population of patients. Of note, strains isolated at the same
period and in the same hospital could belong to different
STs and complexes (Tables 1 and 2). For instance, the
strains ADV88, ADV90 and ADV91 isolated from the
digestive tract of patients hospitalized in Montpellier
(France) in May 2007 belonged to different clonal complexes or to singletons. Moreover, the strains CLF18,
CLF19 and CLF20 were isolated in throat samples of the
same patient but presented different STs.
No differences were observed regarding geographic origin,
clinical site isolation or clinical situation between
MSCC4/eBCC4 strains and other human strains.
Among environmental isolates, no relationships between
STs or complexes and habitats, geographic origins or year
of isolation could be established (Tables 2). For instance,
the 6 strains isolated in association with Photorhabdus
luminescens from the nematode Heterorhabditis indica,
including two Italian strains (2006) and two Guadeloupian strains (1996), belonged to diverse STs and/or complexes. Conversely, MSCC1 grouped a strain isolated in
2006 in Argentina and a strain from Sweden isolated in
1978. The reference strain of the species O. lupini shared
its ST, ST35, with a strain of O. anthropi isolated in a denitrification reactor. O. cytisi was represented by a singleton
ST.
Finally, the structure of the population tested herein, particularly the existence of a human-associated clonal complex (MSCC4/eBCC4) suggested difference in the
propensity of O. anthropi to live in association with
human beings.
Multi-locus sequence-based phylogeny
We applied distance and ML phylogenetic approaches to
the concatenated sequences (3490 nucleotides) of the
seven loci from all STs. The two methods gave congruent
trees and the ML tree is presented in Fig. 2. The topology
of the trees confirmed the population structure deter-

mined by MS treeing and eBURST. A large and robust
clade grouped 27 strains from human origin and corresponded to the major clonal complex MSCC4/eBCC4.
The clade corresponding to eBCC1 contained 23 strains
from different origins. In this clade, the relationships
between environmental and clinical strains could not be
established due to the weak robustness of the branching
order.
The sequences of each of the seven loci were used in the
ML analysis of congruence where each ML tree was compared to the ML tree reconstructed from the seven concatenated sequences. We observed conflicting topologies
regarding the tree based on concatenated sequences suggesting recombination events, particularly for the aroCand omp25-based trees (data not shown). The dnak-, recAand rpoB-based trees were more congruent. They affiliated
the isolates to only 2 to 3 large clades but they failed to
establish relationships inside the clades. However, the
combination of the 3 markers gave a tree showing polymorphism inside each clade. Particularly, the strains
belonging to eBCC1 and MSCC4/eBCC4 formed two
independent robust lineages (data not shown). The gapand trpE-based trees were globally congruent with the tree
based on concatenated sequences. The gene trpE appeared
to be a good marker for studying the phylogenetic relationships among isolates in the species O. anthropi (Fig.
3).

tion studied displayed linkage disequilibrium suggesting
a low rate of recombination. However, linkage disequilibrium could be present into long-term recombining populations where adaptative clones emerge over the shortterm [39]. To explore this hypothesis, we performed
decomposition analysis that depicts all the shortest pathways linking sequences, including those that produce an
interconnected network [30]. A network-like graph indicates recombination events. The split graph (NeighborNet) of all seven loci displayed a network-like structure,
with parallel paths. However, the network generated clusters consistent with MLST major clonal complexes and
phylogenetic lineages (Fig. 4). Recombination events
appeared more frequently inside each major and minor
clonal complex. O. cytisi LMG 22713T as well as strains
CCM 999, DSM 20150 and ADV90 corresponding to singleton STs, ST34, ST18, ST28 and ST14, respectively, were
less subject to recombination events with other strains.
On the contrary, the strains in singleton STs ADV40 (ST6),
CLF19 (ST24), FRG19/sat (ST30), CCUG1235 (ST22),
TOUL59 (ST44) and NCCB 90045 (ST39) were suspect to
recombination (Fig. 4). The positions of these strains in
the phylogenetic trees varied according to the markers, as
shown before and in Fig. 2 and 3.

Strain CCM 999 generally branched out of the other
strains of O. anthropi suggesting that this strain could
belong to another Ochrobactrum species. The phylogenetic
positions of the clinical strains CLF19 and ADV40 significantly varied according the markers, suggesting important
recombination events. For instance, in the aroC-based
tree, CLF19, ADV40, NIM123 and the atypical strain CCM
999 grouped together since the four strains shared exactly
the same aroC locus. The position of O. cytisi LMG 22713T
varied according to the marker, an external position to O.
anthropi was only observed in aroC, rpoB and omp25-based
trees. O. lupini LMG 22727 with two environmental O.
anthropi strains formed a clade branching inside O.
anthropi in all trees (Fig 2 and 3).

High diversity of PFGE genomotypes
The genomic DNA of 56 O. anthropi strains (32 human
and 24 environmental) were analysed by PFGE. At a 100%
similarity level, PFGE discriminated all the strains except
LR1 and LR2, which came from the same environmental
sample. The pulsotypes were highly diverse even among
strains belonging to the same clonal complex and/or sharing the same ST. The clinical strains originating from a
same French hospital were epidemiologically unrelated
by PFGE analysis (Fig. 5). PFGE clusters appeared only
below a 60% similarity level (Tables 1 and 2), suggesting
that PFGE was unable to structure the population studied.
Members of the different clonal complexes appeared
intermingled among the PFGE clusters (Tables 1 and 2).
The PFGE clusters defined at 60% similarity level could
not be related to any characteristic of the strains such as
isolation niche, geography, lifestyle, date of isolation, or
antibiotype.

Recombination in Ochrobactrum anthropi
We assessed the linkage between alleles from the 7 loci by
determination of sIA value. sIA value is expected to be zero
when a population is at linkage equilibrium, i.e., that free
recombination occurs. Analyses were carried out using
either all isolates or all STs (i.e. one isolate from each ST)
in order to minimize a bias due to a possible epidemic
population structure. sIA was significantly different from
zero when all isolates were included in the analysis (sIA =
0.3447; p = 0.0041) or when only one isolate from each
ST was included (sIA = 0.2402; p = 0.0031). The popula-

Antibiotypes of O. anthropi clinical and environmental
strains
Both clinical and environmental strains appeared highly
resistant to all β-lactams, but imipenem. We observed a
general susceptibility to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and an
overall resistance to chloramphenicol and fosfomycin.
The strains isolated from hospitalized patients did not
show particular resistance characteristics when compared
to environmental strains. This suggested that the high
level of resistance observed in O. anthropi is a natural trait

of the species mostly unrelated to the medical use of antibiotics.

order to solve conflicting taxonomic positions in the family Brucellaceae [9].

Discussion

The population of 70 strains of O. anthropi appeared structured in 2 major and 3 minor clonal complexes. The calculation of standardized IA indicated a linkage
disequilibrium that also evoked a clonal population structure. However, split decomposition analysis resulted in a
network-like graph indicating a significant level of recombination mostly inside clonal complexes. Moreover, phylogenetic conflicts were observed when the trees based on
different markers were compared. The persistence of a
linkage disequilibrium in populations in which recombination is frequent could be due to an epidemic population structure or to a mix of ecologically separated
subpopulations [39]. Our results were compatible with an
epidemic population structure composed of a limited
number of clones originating from a background of unrelated genotypes recombining frequently. Our results were
also compatible with a mix of ecologically separated populations i.e. environmental and clinical strains. These two
hypotheses fitted with the existence of a human-associated subpopulation that either emerged as an epidemic
clonal complex or encountered limited genetic exchanges
with other populations. Testing a larger collection of
strains from diverse origins could address this question.
Diverse methods have been proposed for the molecular
typing of bacteria in the genus Ochrobactrum. ITS1
sequencing and rep-PCR have been successfully used to
assess the level of microdiversity in the genus as well as to
cluster the strains according to the species [12,13]. However, within the species O. anthropi there was no correlation between rep- or ITS1-based clusters and origin of the
strains. In the collection tested, MLST data and multilocus-based phylogeny provided evidence of a clonal
complex associated to human beings.

We proposed here the first application of MLST to O.
anthropi. Our MLST scheme contains 6 housekeeping and
1 outer-membrane protein (omp25) genes, scattered on
the large chromosome of strain ATCC 49188T. The
sequences of bipartite genomes in alphaproteobacteria
suggested the plasmidic origin of the smaller chromosome [40]. In this MLST scheme, no loci were chosen on
the small chromosome to avoid bias due to the potential
difference in the evolution history of the two chromosomes. The construction of another complete MLST
scheme based on genes carried by this second chromosome would be of great interest to assess the emergence
and the evolution of the complex genome in O. anthropi.
At each locus examined by MLST, even at omp25, genetic
variation appears to be mostly neutral. The 7 loci had
mol%G+C contents similar to that of the rest of the
genome. This suggests that these genes were not recently
acquired through horizontal gene transfer. ST diversity in
O. anthropi appeared similar to that of a significant
number of bacteria (0.63 ST per isolate); see [37] for a
review. This level of STs diversity allowed a wide range of
applications from strain characterisation to population
structure analysis and to evolutionary studies [37]. A
MLST scheme has been recently proposed for Brucella
spp., the genus phylogenetically most related to Ochrobactrum [41]. The genes dnaK, gap, omp25 and trpE were analysed for both Brucella spp. and O. anthropi. Considering
these 4 loci, genetic diversity in O. anthropi (6.6 polymorphic nucleotides per 100) appeared 5-fold higher than
observed in the genus Brucella (1.4%). This difference in
genetic diversity could reflect differences in lifestyles,
qualifying O. anthropi as a versatile generalist and Brucella
as a narrow niche-specialist. The recA gene displayed the
lower genetic diversity in our scheme. It was previously
used for studying the phylogenetic interrelationships
among members of the family Brucellaceae and appeared
also unable to distinguish between some species in the
genus Ochrobactrum [9]. We confirm here the high conservation of this marker and its inefficiency to explore the
interrelationships in the species O. anthropi. The rpoB and
dnaK sequences were also conserved among strains of O.
anthropi. These results justified multi-locus approaches
rather than single target-based analyses for sub-typing O.
anthropi. However, in our MLST study, two markers
reflected the overall diversity determined by the 7 loci.
This was the case for trpE and to a lesser extent for the gap
gene. Differing from rrs and recA, trpE and gap were less
conserved and gave a tree with robust phylogenetic interrelationships at the sub-species level. These two markers
could be tested at the intra- and the inter-genus level in

To strengthen this evidence, the question of the representativeness of the human strains included in the MLST analysis should be addressed. Most clinical strains originated
from France (n = 34) but they have been isolated in
diverse regions and at different times from 1998 to 2007.
We also included 9 geographically unrelated clinical
strains isolated in Scandinavia, United Kingdom or Louisiana (USA) from 1971 to 1995. Seven of them belonged
to the major complex MSCC4/eBCC4 beside most of the
French clinical isolates. This indicated that MSCC4/
eBCC4 could be considered as a human-adapted subpopulation rather than a geographic subpopulation. The
mean genetic diversity calculated from the seven loci
showed no significant differences between clinical isolates
and isolates from all other various origins. This is also the
case for the number of STs per strain. The genetic diversity
of the clinical population was confirmed at the genomic
level since all the clinical strains displayed different pulso-

types indicating that they were epidemiologically unrelated. Therefore, epidemiological, genetic and genomic
data exclude a bias in strain sampling and enhance the
robustness of the human-associated subpopulation
described herein.
PFGE typing appeared highly discriminative in the species
O. anthropi since only 2 strains originating from the same
environmental sample displayed the same pulsotype.
None of the isolates originating from one hospital displayed the same pulsotype. This wide genomotype diversity observed here confirmed previous data showing the
genomic plasticity of O. anthropi [28]. Genomic rearrangements in plastic genomes are considered as rapid evolution mechanisms, named micro-evolution with respect to
the time-scale, that could be involved in rapid adaptation
processes to a particular niche [42]. Restriction fragment
length polymorphism in PFGE detected genomic modifications such as rearrangements and horizontal genetic
transfer events rather than single nucleotide polymorphisms [43]. The higher discriminative power of PFGE
suggested that large rearrangements occurred at higher
rates than intragenic point mutations in housekeeping
genes in O. anthropi. Despite its discriminative ability,
genomotyping failed to structure the bacterial population
with respect to the habitat or the origin of the strains,
probably due to the lack of close relationships among the
strains. The same results were obtained in previous studies
based on rep-PCR where clinical, soil and rhizosphere isolates of O. anthropi appeared intermingled in a defined
genomotype [13,15]. Finally, genomotyping methods
appeared to be the most suitable to identify a particular O.
anthropi clone but should be applied to cross-contamination or to outbreak tracing rather than to population
structure assessment.
The emergence of clinical-encountered subpopulations
could be caused by the acquisition of genes involved in
antimicrobial resistance that conferred a strong selective
advantage in the hospital environment. In the case of O.
anthropi, we observed no differences in antimicrobial
resistance patterns between hospital-acquired and environmental strains. Moreover, most of the genes analysed
were not affected by the antibiotic selective pressure. The
rpoB gene could be object of Darwinian selection by antibiotics since RNA polymerase is the target for rifampicin.
This is also the case for the omp25 gene that could be
involved in the resistance to a range of antibiotics. However, dN/dS showed that rpoB and omp25 modifications
corresponded to neutral rather than to Darwinianselected mutations in the population studied. Therefore,
resistance to antimicrobial agents could not explain the
selection of the human-associated complex MSCC4/
eBCC4 in the population of O. anthropi studied here.
Beside, even if the apparition of MSCC4/eBCC4 clonal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/267

complex was not dated, one can hypothesize from the
slow evolution rate of the investigated genes that it probably emerged a long time ago before being submitted to
antibiotic pressure.
The existence of human-associated subpopulation unrelated to antibiotic selective pressure, in a natural population of O. anthropi, suggested that a subpopulation of this
bacterium could be considered as "specialized opportunistic" pathogen. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
another versatile bacterium, the clinical isolates are not
specialists since P. aeruginosa environmental isolates are
indistinguishable from clinical isolates [44]. The same situation was observed here for O. anthropi grouped in the
clonal complex eBCC1. One could consider that the virulence traits of P. aeruginosa reflect characters acquired by
the species to survive in the environment. Analysis of the
complete genome sequence of O. anthropi showed a complete virB operon, which codes for a putative type IV secretion system known to be the major virulence factor in
Brucella spp. and in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, two phylogenetic neighbours of Ochrobactrum spp. [23]. Analysis of
virB polymorphism in the O. anthropi population will be
of great interest. However, O. anthropi is a mild pathogen
that generally causes diseases in immunocompromised
patients. It probably does not display typical virulence factors but rather "human-adaptation" traits. These traits
might be non-equally distributed in the population and
could explain the emergence of human-adapted lineages.
The detection of a human-specialized lineage in our collection of O. anthropi suggests that this versatile bacterium
could be a good model to better understand the emergence of phylogenetically related strict pathogens of animals and plants, such as Brucella, Bartonella and
Agrobacterium.

Conclusion
We confirmed the high discriminative power of PFGE for
subtyping O. anthropi. However, this method failed to
structure the population and should be reserved to investigation of epidemiologically closely related strains. The
MLST scheme gave preliminary results, which could be
emended after enrichment of the STs database. For this
purpose, the MLST scheme and data will be deposited to
the website MLST http://www.mlst.net. MLST on O.
anthropi allowed for the first time (1) to identify a humanspecialized subpopulation, (2) to show an epidemic population structure, (3) to evaluate the recombination rate.
Moreover, we showed that our MLST scheme could be
useful for a taxonomic purpose in order to clarify systematics in the Brucellaceae.
Evidence of a human-associated clonal complex suggested
a specialized opportunistic behaviour for O. anthropi. This
study underlines the interest of studying the housekeep-

which specific virulence traits remain unknown.
