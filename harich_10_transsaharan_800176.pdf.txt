Abstract
Background: A proportion of 1/4 to 1/2 of North African female pool is made of typical sub-Saharan lineages, in
higher frequencies as geographic proximity to sub-Saharan Africa increases. The Sahara was a strong geographical
barrier against gene flow, at least since 5,000 years ago, when desertification affected a larger region, but the Arab
trans-Saharan slave trade could have facilitate enormously this migration of lineages. Till now, the genetic
consequences of these forced trans-Saharan movements of people have not been ascertained.
Results: The distribution of the main L haplogroups in North Africa clearly reflects the known trans-Saharan slave
routes: West is dominated by L1b, L2b, L2c, L2d, L3b and L3d; the Center by L3e and some L3f and L3w; the East
by L0a, L3h, L3i, L3x and, in common with the Center, L3f and L3w; while, L2a is almost everywhere. Ages for the
haplogroups observed in both sides of the Saharan desert testify the recent origin (holocenic) of these
haplogroups in sub-Saharan Africa, claiming a recent introduction in North Africa, further strengthened by the no
detection of local expansions.
Conclusions: The interpolation analyses and complete sequencing of present mtDNA sub-Saharan lineages
observed in North Africa support the genetic impact of recent trans-Saharan migrations, namely the slave trade
initiated by the Arab conquest of North Africa in the seventh century. Sub-Saharan people did not leave traces in
the North African maternal gene pool for the time of its settlement, some 40,000 years ago.

Background
The recent high-resolution mtDNA studies are offering
the possibility of shedding light on ancient and recent
human migration events, allowing to inferring more precisely about the geographical origin of lineages observed
nowadays in a certain region. In fact, the characterization of the full mtDNA sequence is being used to investigate local events as the Chadic expansion from East
Africa towards Chad Basin in the last 8,000 years [1] or
historic movements as the diaspora of Jews [2,3], which
could not be approached in previous more limited
mtDNA surveys.
This approach is being applied to the long-enduring
discussion about pre-historic migrations across the

Mediterranean Sea, leading to exchange of lineages
between Iberia and Maghreb [4,5]. Recently, the subcharacterization of H-lineages observed in several North
African populations revealed its affiliation within Iberian
expanded lineages, after the Last-Glacial Maximum
[6,7], being the same observed in Tuareg living in the
Sahel [8]. The Near Eastern contribution to the pool of
H lineages in North Africa was minimal, indicating that
a pre-historic European lineage input occurred in elevated frequencies enriching the ancient Near Eastern
background of North African populations mainly constituted by the low frequent haplogroups U6 and M1 [9].
Another major contribution to the pool of North African populations was the sub-Saharan one. It is known
that a proportion of 1/4 to 1/2 of North African female
pool is made of typical sub-Saharan lineages (designated
as haplogroups L0-L6), in higher frequencies as geographic proximity to sub-Saharan Africa increases [4,5].

Nevertheless, the Sahara is a strong geographical barrier
against gene flow, at least since 5,000 years ago, when
desertification affected a larger region, ending up the
humid and greening conditions established by around
10,000 years ago, in the so called Holocene Climatic
Optimum [10].
But, if geographical and climatic conditions have not
been favorable to sub-Saharan gene flow to North Africa
in the last 5,000 years, the Arab trans-Saharan slave
trade could have facilitate enormously this migration of
lineages. Till now, the genetic consequences of these
forced trans-Saharan movements of people have not
been ascertained, being over-shadowed by the Atlantic
slave trade towards the New World. In fact, the huge
number of sub-Saharan people introduced in the New
World from the 16th century onwards allowed to investigating in great detail the genetic consequences of this
historical event [11-13], and the complete sequencing of
L-lineages is indicating very precisely about the origin of
lineages observed nowadays in America [14]. Nonetheless, some authors affirm [15] that the Arab slave trade
of black slaves was much the same in total to the Atlantic slave trade, and interestingly far longer in the time
scale. It began in the middle of the seventh century (650
A.D.) and survives still today in Mauritania and Sudan,
summing up 14 centuries rather than four as for the
Atlantic slave trade. Although estimates are very rough,
figures are of 4,820,000 for the Saharan trade between
650 and 1600 A.D., and, for comparison purposes, of

2,400,000 for the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean trade
between 800 and 1600 A.D. [16]. Notwithstanding the
thousands of kilometers along the edge of the Sahara,
the Red sea and the East African coast, from where
slave exports came, there were relatively few export
points, concentrating geographically the impact of the
trade. Black slaves were brought by Berber and Arab
merchants mainly to actual Morocco, Algeria, Libya and
Egypt through six main routes that crossed the desert
(Figure 1): one went north to Morocco from ancient
Ghana (at present southeastern Mauritania and Western
Mali); a second brought slaves to Tuwat (southern
Algeria) from ancient Timbutku (Mali); a third passed
from the Niger valley and the Hausa towns through the
Air Massif to Ghat and Ghadames; a central route
linked Lake Chad region to actual Libya (Murzuk),
being one of the most important in slave commerce as
it offered oases at regular intervals that could satisfy the
caravan’s needs; in East Africa, the slave caravan followed mainly the Nile River from actual Sudan (Dar
Fur) to Egypt (Assiout); and a sixth passed north from
the confluence of the Blue and the White Nile to Egypt.
Some of these routes were interconnected: the routes
north from Timbuktu went to Morocco, Algeria, and
Libya; while the Dar Fur-Egypt route connected with
the route north from the upper Nile valley.
Males were sought for a variety of functions: doorkeepers, secretaries, militaries or eunuchs. Black soldiers
were seen from Islamic Spain to Egypt, and in Morocco

a whole generation of black young boys were bought at
the age of 10 or 11 and trained to become its army.
However, the bulk of the trade was in females, as
domestic servants, entertainers and/or concubines: two
females for every male overall, in contrast to the ratio of
two males for every female overall in the Atlantic trade
[15]. Some harems could be enormous, reaching even
the extravagating number of 14,000 concubines. Young
female slaves were instructed in household crafts and
were then provided with resources to buy a home and
get married.
The Eastern sub-Saharan slave trade towards Arabia
was investigated through mtDNA hypervariable region I
(HVRI) diversity [17], leading to concluding that higher
frequencies of L lineages are observed in Arab comparatively with non-Arab populations in the Near East, having been introduced in the last 2,500 years. These
conclusions were supported afterwards by other studies
[18,19]. This Eastern sub-Saharan slave trade involved
mainly maritime routes across the Red Sea, which was
dominated by the Southern Arabs, already around the
12th century BC.
The Western trans-Saharan slave trade deserves a more
careful genetic investigation. In this work we will present
the results of mtDNA haplogroup affiliation of El Jadida
population, approximately 100 km south of Casablanca,
in the Moroccan Atlantic coast. We performed highresolution screening of selected haplogroups in this Moroccan sample: haplogroup H, in order to get more
evidence on North Mediterranean influence; and haplogroup L3, one of the most geographically diversified
sub-Saharan haplogroup. For the L3 haplogroup, we conducted the complete mtDNA sequencing of 8 L3 haplotypes from El Jadida, and compared the complete North
African L3 sequences which have been described
[14,20-22] with the many other known sub-Saharan
sequences (summed up in [23]). We also performed analyses of geographical interpolation for sub-Saharan haplogroup frequencies across Africa, by using an extended
database summing up 4908 individuals.

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction

Blood samples were collected from 81 unrelated people
from El Jadida, Morocco, nearly 100 km south of Casablanca. Appropriate informed consent was obtained
from all individuals and total DNA was extracted from
blood using a standard Chelex 100 protocol.
mtDNA amplification and sequencing

The mtDNA hypervariable regions I and II (HVRI and
HVRII) were amplified as described elsewhere [24], in
both forward and reverse directions. The amplified

samples were purified with Microspin S-300 HR columns (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and automated
sequencing was carried out in an ABI Prism 3100 (AB
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the kit
Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
(AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Temperatures profile for sequencing reactions consisted in
denaturation at 96°C for 4 min and 35 cycles of 96°C
for 15 s, 50°C for 9 s and 60°C for 2 min, followed by
60°C for 10 min. Sequence editing was performed both
by using the BioEdit version 7.0.4.1 [25] and by manually checking the electropherograms, tasks performed by
two independent investigators.
Haplogroup H variation was dissected in a total of 14
samples according to [26], which basically consisted in
sequencing four mtDNA coding-region segments
encompassing the principal diagnostic positions in haplogroup H samples: 3001-3360, 3661-4050, 4281-4820,
and 6761-7050 (a total of 1580 base pairs). Furthermore,
haplogroup L3 variation was investigated in 8 samples
by performing complete sequence of the molecule
(~16,569 bp) as described in [27], in a total of 32 overlapping segments of around 600 bp each. The 8 complete mtDNA sequences are deposited in GenBank
database with accession numbers: GU455415-GU455422.
Haplogroup affiliation

Mutations were scored relatively to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS; [28]), and its positions numbered from 1 to 16569. For haplogroup
affiliation, the most recent phylogenetic data, including
information from complete sequencing, were followed:
for H [29]; for K [2]; for J, R, T, and V [30]; for
U [30,31]; for I and M1 [32]; for X [33]; and for L [14].
Statistical analyses

Analysis of population structure, molecular diversity
measures, and tests of selective neutrality were executed
in the software Arlequin version 3.0 [34].
Phylogenetic reconstruction of mtDNA sequences was
based on HVRI and complete sequence. A preliminary
network analysis [35] led to a suggested branching order
for the tree and the L3 tree published in [14] was used as
reference tree. The dates of the most recent common
ancestor of specific subclusters in the phylogeny were
estimated using r, the average number of transitions from
the ancestral sequence type to all sequences in the cluster,
based in the recently updated mutation rate published by
[36] for the entire molecule (1 mutation in every 3624
years), and by using the calculator provided in the paper.
The highly variable position 16519 was not considered for
the time estimates. Each tip node of the phylogenetic tree
was counted as one event if shared by a few samples.

To determine and visualize the geographical distribution of haplogroups L interpolation maps were drawn by
using the “Spatial Analyst Extension” of ArcView version 3.2 http://www.esri.com/software/arcview/. The
“Inverse Distance Weighted” (IDW) option with a
power of two was used for the interpolation of the surface. IDW assumes that each input point has a local
influence that decreases with distance. The geographic
location used is the centre of the distribution area, from
where the individual samples of each population were
collected. Data for other populations were taken from
several publications and are summed up in Additional
File 1 and displayed in Figure 2A.
Correlograms for Morans I indices versus distances were
obtained for the total L in the populations and for L0,
L1, L2 and L3 proportions of the sub-Saharan pool in
the samples by using the PaSSAGE software v 1.0 [37].
The existence of a cline is assumed when a continuous
decline trend composed of statistical significant points is
observed.

East, U6 and M1, were observed with frequencies of
2.47% and 6.17% in El Jadida.
Clearly, the main component of the West Eurasian
lineages was made of possible Iberian expanded lineages
following the post-glacial climate improvement: H1
(12.35%), V (9.88%) and U5b (1.23%). There were low
frequent lineages belonging to the HV branch of the
maternal tree which could have come to El Jadida from
the Near East, (H* - 3.70%; H7 - 1.23%; HV1 - 1.23%) as
well as R0a (3.70%), X (1.23%), N1b (1.23%), J (7.41%),
T (2.47%). There was also a considerable amount of
U/K lineages, besides the already referred U6 and U5a:
K (9.88%), U* (3.70%) and U4 (1.23%). Curiously, five
out of eight K individuals in El Jadida presented a substitution on position 16287 (besides the haplogroup
defining 16224-16311 polymorphisms); this haplotype
was so far observed in 1 Italian (belonging to sub-haplogroup K1a4) and two Moroccan individuals (sub-haplogroup K1a2) out of 789 K sequences in [2] and absent
in other North African populations [6].

Results and Discussion

Sub-Saharan haplogroups across North Africa

mtDNA diversity and haplogroup affiliation in El Jadida
sample

Based on a database summing up 4908 African and
2178 Near Eastern/Arabian Peninsula individuals (Figure
2A shows sample locations, further indicated in Additional File 1) we assayed interpolation analyses of L haplogroup frequencies. As can be seen in Figure 2B, the
north to south increase of frequency across North Africa
and the Sahara is visible. In the East of the African continent, the highest L frequencies are attained in more
southern latitudes than in the rest of the continent, due
to presence of M and some N (R0a and U6) lineages,
especially high in Ethiopia.
We then focused attention in the region across Sahara,
for each of the main L haplogroups. When interpolation
analyses are performed for the frequencies in total
population, any sign of gradient across the Sahara is
lost, as differences between L frequencies southern and
northern of the desert are high. For this reason, interpolation analyses were performed for the frequencies of
each haplogroup in the L pool, enhancing the possibility
of detecting gradients across the Sahara.
L0 (Figure 3) attains the higher proportion inside L
pool in East Africa, including the Near East and Arabian
Peninsula, following a decreasing frequency from south
towards north. This pattern is coincident with the one
for haplogroup L0a, while L0d and L0f are almost
restricted to the south.
L1 total (Figure 4) attains the highest proportions in
the L pool in central Africa, in Pygmy populations, followed by some of the north-west populations. This presence of L1 in north-west African samples is mainly due
to L1b sub-haplogroup, while L1c is quite restricted to

The characterization of HVRI and HVRII diversities in
the 81 individuals from El Jadida led to the identification of the haplotypes reported in Table 1. The HVRI
mtDNA diversity observed (Table 2) was, in general, as
high as observed in other North African populations
[4-6] and the Fu’s Fs values for the neutrality tests were
significantly negative, in accordance with populations in
expansion, except, notoriously for the Libyan Tuaregs
reported by [38].
The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was
performed in order to evaluate genetic structure within
North Africa, revealing a residual 3% variation between
populations. Relatively to pairwise FST genetic distances
(not shown), the only significant values after Bonferroni’s correction were between El Jadida-Algeria (0.061;
p value = 0.000 ± 0.000), El Jadida-Tuaregs from Libya
(0.022; p = 0.000 ± 0.000), El Jadida-Morocco-Berbers
(0.027; p = 0.000 ± 0.000) and El Jadida-El Alia from
Tunisia (0.024; p = 0.000 ± 0.000).
When analyzing the proportions of sub-Saharan and
West Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups (Table 1) in El
Jadida population, the characteristic mixed pool was
observed, with frequencies of 30.86% and 69.14%, respectively. The sub-Saharan pool presented the branches L1,
L2 and L3, in the following frequencies: 24%, 28% and
48% of the sub-Saharan pool. The basal haplogroup L0
was absent. In the West Eurasian pool, the haplogroups
said to have been introduced into North and East Africa
as result of a Back-to-Africa migration from the Near

Central Africa. The presence of this haplogroup in Near
East and Arabian Peninsula is quite limited.
L2 total (Figure 5) is one of the two dominant haplogroups in the L pool, in many regions across Africa,
namely in central-west and south-east regions, most
probably due to Bantu expansion [11,12] and towards
north-west, potentially due to the trans-Saharan slave
trade. The very central African populations, mostly
Pygmy groups, present low proportions of L2 lineages in
its pool. This pattern is caused mainly by sub-haplogroup

L2a, the most frequent lineage in L2, while L2b, L2c and
L2d attain highest proportions in the west coast between
Senegal and Mauritania.
L3 total (Figure 6) reaches the highest proportions in
North and then east Africa. The sub-haplogroups L3b
and L3d clearly dominate in the west, as known before,
as well as in North Africa. L3e has a more central dispersion across Sahara, being also frequent in South
Africa. L3f has an eastern localization across the Sahara,
with some foci in Central Africa southern of Sahara,

due to high frequencies of L3f3 in Chadic-speaking
groups [1]. L3h, L3i, L3w and L3x (Figure 7) are rare
and clearly limited to East Africa.
When the spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied
to the total L frequency in the populations, and to the
L0, L1, L2 and L3 proportions of the sub-Saharan pools
in the samples, signs of cline were evident for all them
(Figure 8). The positive values at small distances indicate that individuals from the same population are more
similar to each other; while the negative values at the
largest distances (not so clear for L1 and L2) suggest a
marked genetic differentiation across the African continent and Arabian Peninsula.

Complete L3 sequences

We performed the complete sequencing of 8 L3 different
haplotypes observed in El Jadida. This haplogroup was
selected because it is the most diversified sub-Saharan
haplogroup in El Jadida and some of its lineages could
have been inputted in North Africa from East Africa. The
complete sequencing allowed the fine characterization of
these samples as follows (Figure 9): one L3b1, two
L3d1’2’3, one L3e2b, one L3f1a, two L3f1b and one L3h1b.
Joining these 8 complete L3 sequences to 236 previously published ones (the ones summed up in
[1,14,20-22]), a good resolution of L3(xM, N) tree is
obtained (Additional File 2; information for samples

used is listed in Additional File 3). There are 39
sequences from North Africa, representing 16% of the
complete L3 dataset, being 10 from Morocco, one from
Algeria, four from Libya, 11 from Tunisia, and 13 from
Egypt. So this work raised the homogeneity of complete
L3 sequences across North Africa.
Most of these North African sequences share a recent
ancestry with sequences observed in other parts of
Africa, in the Holocene period (Table 3). This seems to
point to a recent introduction of these lineages in North
Africa from the original locations in sub-Saharan and
East Africa. Namely, one Moroccan and one Libyan
sequences belong to sub-haplogroup L3b1b, together
with two West African sequences from Burkina, with a
coalescence age of 9,926 ± 2,555 years. Three Egyptian,

four Tunisian, one Libyan and one Moroccan sequences
share a most recent common ancestor of 13,537 ± 1,058
years old with seven West African, two South African,
six Americans (most probably African-descents), two
East Africans, two Central Africans, five Near Eastern
and two South Asians, being affiliated in haplogroup
L3b1a. A Moroccan sequence shares an ancestry with
one sequence from Guinea-Bissau of around 13,370 ±
4,205 years old, inside haplogroup L3b2. One Tunisian
L3d1c sequences share an ancestor with one American
African-descent at 9,246 ± 3,444 years ago. One Tunisian shares an ancestor at around 6,549 ± 2,883 years
ago with one Syrian inside L3d1’2’3 haplogroup. One
Tunisian and one Egyptian together with four individuals from Burkina, one from Guinea Bissau and two

Americans share an ancestor at 14,179 ± 2,352 years
ago, belonging to the haplogroup L3e2a. In haplogroup
L3e2b, two Egyptians and one Moroccan share a most
recent common ancestor at 11,985 ± 1,529 years ago
with one Ethiopian, one Zaire, three West Africans and
five Americans (with an younger co-ancestry between
the Egyptian and one American at around 1,287 ± 1,278
years ago inside L3e2b2). One Egyptian, one Libyan and
one Tunisian L3e5 sequences share an ancestor of
11,516 ± 2,264 years with one Burkina, one Ethiopian,
one Sudanese and one American (with a somewhat
younger co-ancestry between the Tunisian and
the Ethiopian at around 10,610 ± 3,704 years ago).
A Moroccan L3f1a shares a common ancestor with one
Chadic sample at 14,766 ± 4,448 years ago. L3f1b haplogroup, having a most recent common ancestor of
14,710 ± 1,227 years old, bears some sequences from
North Africa (two Egyptians and two Moroccan), and
many other from other African locations and Near

Eastern, with one Egyptian sample having an younger
co-ancestor, at 4,343 ± 2,388 years ago, with one Jordanian and one American.
A few L3 sequences observed in North Africa have
older co-ancestry with other sub-Saharan regions, but as
this occurs in the rarer haplogroups (almost restricted
to East Africa), most probably the scenario will change
as these become better characterized. This is the case
for one L3 × 2 sequence observed in Algeria, which
shares an older most recent common ancestor with two
Ethiopian, one Israeli and one Kuwait, at 33,165 ± 4,499
years ago, but one Ethiopian and the Israeli and Kuwait
sequences share a younger ancestor at 19,012 ± 4,200.
Also, one Egyptian L3f2b sequence shares an ancestor
with a Chadic one at around 24,809 ± 5,935 years ago.
For L3 h1a2 haplogroup, one Egyptian and one Lebanese sequences share a coalescence age of 26,281 ±
6,139 years old. And for L3 h1b, with an age of
36,827 ± 3,772 years, one of the North African

sequences (one Tunisian and one Moroccan) has a most
recent common ancestor of 14,766 ± 4,448 years old
with a sequence from Guinea Bissau.
So far, the two only complete published samples
belonging to haplogroup L3k have a North African origin, one from Libya and one from Tunisia. This haplogroup has a coalescent age of around 29,251 ± 6,524
years old. As it is impossible to identify this haplogroup
based only in control region information (only through
HVRII polymorphism at position 235), it is impossible
to add additional information about this haplogroup.

Conclusions
The genetic information testifies that recent migrations
were the main events leading to the mtDNA pool
observed nowadays in Maghreb populations. The

ancestral Near Eastern pool, remnant of the ancient
Back-to-Africa migration through the Levant around
40,000 years ago [9] is very restricted. Values for these
haplogroups are around 8.6% in El Jadida and 10% in
Tunisia [6]. A bulk of the West Eurasian lineages present in Maghreb populations is constituted by the typical Iberian sub-haplogroups H and V (12.3% and 9.9%,
respectively, in El Jadida). It is highly probable that
these lineages did expand towards North Africa when
they expanded to the rest of the European continent,
from Iberia, around 14,000 years ago, as they are present
in all North African populations, even in those not
known as directly historically related with Iberia [6].
Recent mtDNA data have shown that considerable
local population expansions occurred in Sahel nomadic
populations around 4,000 years ago, following important

movements of northern and eastern African people
towards the recently formed Sahel region. These local
expansions were revealed in one branch of the typical
East African haplogroups L3f, the L3f3 almost restricted
to the Chadic-speaking nomadic groups [1] and in one
branch of the typical Iberian haplogroup V in southern
Tuareg populations [8]. Thus, the emergence of the
modern Sahara, beginning some 4,000 years ago, hardened existing geographical divisions and separated peoples, forcing the black Saharans into the oases or
southwards into the more attractive lands of the Sahel.
This barrier in gene flow is evident when attending to
the global L haplogroup frequencies in African populations. There is a clear horizontal gradient across the
continent, attaining values of 95% and higher in
the Sahel region in West and Central Africa, but not in
the Eastern African coast where those values are only
reached around the border between Tanzania and
Mozambique. The lower values for L frequencies in the
eastern African coast are due to the southern migration
of the Eurasian haplogroup M1, which is typical of East
Africa. North Africa reaches L frequencies of 20-40%,
while the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East have
around 20-30% (only higher in Yemen).

The coalescence ages for the L sequences observed
nowadays in North Africa shows the young ancestry of
these lineages, which were originated in sub-Saharan
Africa in the Holocene. This proves that sub-Saharan
people did not leave traces in the maternal gene pool
for the time of settlement of North Africa, some 40,000
years ago. And for sure, the continuous publishing of
complete L sequences across Africa will reveal still
younger ancestors between L sequences observed in
both sides of the Saharan desert, bringing its introduction into North Africa to more recent/historical times.
It is also relevant that the interpolation analyses of
haplogroups inside the L pool across the Sahara revealed
horizontal gradients, matching in a high extent the
known trans-Saharan routes. The West is dominated by
L1b, L2b, L2c, L2d, L3b and L3d. The Center has L3e
and some L3f and L3w. The East bears L0a, L3h, L3i,
L3x and, in common with the Center, L3f and L3w. L2a
is almost everywhere, strengthening its dominance in
the slave package, not only towards the New World, but
also in the trans-Saharan trade.
Both these genetic evidences agree with historical data
that the introduction of the Asiatic horse into North
Africa around 2,000 years ago lengthened the reach of
desert nomads’ raiding and trading. Before this period,
the few black slaves taken from time to time across the
Sahara would have been seen on the far side of the
Mediterranean as mere exotic household ornaments.
But, it may be argued that there was no regular transSaharan trade system before the rise of the camelmounted Berber nomad, in the first Christian centuries,
and perhaps not even until after the arrival of the first
camel-riding Muslim Arabs in North Africa, in the
seventh century [39].
