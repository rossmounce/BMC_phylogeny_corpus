Convergent evolution of RFX transcription factors
and ciliary genes predated the origin of metazoans
Research article

Jeffrey SC Chu, David L Baillie and Nansheng Chen*

Abstract
Background: Intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes, which are critical for the development and function of cilia and
flagella in metazoans, are tightly regulated by the Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcription factors (TFs). However, how
and when their evolutionary relationship was established remains unknown.
Results: We have identified evidence suggesting that RFX TFs and IFT genes evolved independently and their
evolution converged before the first appearance of metazoans. Both ciliary genes and RFX TFs exist in all metazoans as
well as some unicellular eukaryotes. However, while RFX TFs and IFT genes are found simultaneously in all sequenced
metazoan genomes, RFX TFs do not co-exist with IFT genes in most pre-metazoans and thus do not regulate them in
these organisms. For example, neither the budding yeast nor the fission yeast possesses cilia although both have welldefined RFX TFs. Conversely, most unicellular eukaryotes, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have
typical cilia and well conserved IFT genes but lack RFX TFs. Outside of metazoans, RFX TFs and IFT genes co-exist only
in choanoflagellates including M. brevicollis, and only one fungus Allomyces macrogynus of the 51 sequenced fungus
genomes. M. brevicollis has two putative RFX genes and a full complement of ciliary genes.
Conclusions: The evolution of RFX TFs and IFT genes were independent in pre-metazoans. We propose that their
convergence in evolution, or the acquired transcriptional regulation of IFT genes by RFX TFs, played a pivotal role in the
establishment of metazoan.
Background
All metazoans and many unicellular eukaryotes have
functional cilia (also known as flagella) [1]. Both motile
and immotile cilia (also known as sensory or primary
cilia) hold many receptors for sensing environmental signals. Cilia may offer competitive advantages to ciliated
organisms by allowing them to avoid predation and also
to track nutritionally rich resources [2]. It is thus not surprising that cilia and most ciliary genes are deeply conserved, both in structure and function, in the "tree of life".
Such high levels of conservation suggest a common evolutionary origin [1]. Ciliary defects have been associated
with defective development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [3] as well as a growing list of devastating
human genetic disease conditions collectively called ciliopathies, including polycystic kidney disease (PKD),
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Alstrome syndrome, Jou* Correspondence: chenn@sfu.ca

bert syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and primary
ciliary dyskinesia [4,5]. In mammals, cilia are found on
essentially all cell types, highlighting the critical role cilia
play [6]. One essential cellular process in cilia is the intraflagellar transport (IFT) that is responsible for the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia. The IFT
machinery consists of four basic molecular modules: (a)
motors, (b) Complex A, (c) Complex B, and (d) BBS complex [7,8].
How IFT genes are regulated at the transcriptional level
remained largely unknown until this century when Swoboda and colleagues discovered in C. elegans that many
IFT genes are regulated by DAF-19, a RFX type transcription factor [3]. Mutations in daf-19 resulted in defects in
cilia development and constitutive dauer formation [3].
DAF-19 binds to X-box motif, which is a highly conserved cis-regulatory element first discovered in mammals [3,9]. Ciliary genes in C. elegans often contain one or
more putative X-box motifs 100 bp - 250 bp upstream of
the coding sequences [3,4,10,11]. In addition, ciliary
genes and cilia development in the fruit fly Drosophila

melanogaster were also suggested to be regulated by RFX
TFs [12]. Two RFX genes dRFX[13] and dRFX2 [14] have
been identified in D. melanogaster. dRFX was identified
through a homology search for the RFX DNA binding
domain (DBD) and dRFX2 was identified through yeastone-hybrid (Y1H) screening for transcription factors that
bind to a putative promoter sequence [13,14]. Notably,
dRFX2 has not been found in the D. melanogaster
genome sequences, suggesting that it is likely located
within the heterochromatin regions (William Gelbart,
personal communication).
RFX TFs were first identified in mammals as binding
proteins of the X-box motif [15]. Through bioinformatics
searches and molecular characterization, seven RFX
genes--RFX1-7 have been found in mammals [16,17].
Different mammalian RFX genes show differential but
overlapping expression patterns [16], suggesting that they
have complementary and cooperative roles in regulating
genes in many different biological pathways. Indeed,
mammalian RFX TFs have been shown to interact with
each other and with many additional co-factors [16].
Accumulating evidence confirms that RFX genes regulate
development and function of cilia in mammals as well.
For instance, RFX3 knockout in mice led to abnormal
cilia development in both brain [18] and pancreas [19].
Outside of metazoans, however, there is no evidence
suggesting that IFT genes are regulated by RFX TFs. No
RFX TFs have been reported in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a popular model organism for
studying cilia biology. Conversely, RFX TFs exist in
organisms including the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe that do not have cilia [17], suggesting that RFX
TFs do not regulate ciliary genes in these organisms.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that IFT
genes and RFX TFs evolved independently and that their
evolution converged at some point. To test this hypothesis, we have identified and examined IFT genes and RFX
TFs in hundreds of fully sequence genomes that have
become available recently.

Results
Molecular evolution of ciliary genes

Cilia have been observed to exist in many organisms
including mammals, fruit flies, and C. elegans. Here, we
examine the conservation of cilia by examining the ciliary
components identified through searches for human
orthologs. In total, we have examined the sequenced
genomes of 153 species ranging from metazoans to fungi
and plants. The ciliary components examined here
include: (1) Five genes from the Motor module
(DYNC2H1, K1FAP3, KIF17, KIF3B, and KIF3A); (2)
Four from the Complex A module (IFT122, IFT140,
WDR35, and WDR19); (3) Nine from the Complex B

module (IFT88, IFT80, IFT172, IFT57, CLUAP1, IFT52,
IFT20, IFT81, and IFT74); (4) Six from the BBS complex
(BBS5, TTC8, BBS2, ARL6, BBS1, and BBS7) [7,8] (Figure
1). We present results from 31 representative species in
Figure 1. Most of the ciliary genes examined are strongly
conserved in all metazoans ranging from the sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) to human (Homo sapiens)
(Figure 1). The unicellular choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis, which have been regarded as the closest extant
relative of the last unicellular ancestor of metazoans [20],
also have well conserved ciliary genes. Many ciliated protists, including Paramecium tetraurelia, Tetrahymena
thermophila, and Phytophthora ramorum have most of
the ciliary genes, consistent with previous reports [21].
Also in agreement with previous reports [22,23], we have
identified conserved ciliary genes in the unicellular algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its closely related multicellular organism Volvox carteri. Protists Giardia lamblia
and Physarum polycephalum have ciliary features that are
similar to cilia development in mammals [24-27]. However, we observe reduced similarity for all ciliary genes in
these two species, suggesting that these ciliary genes in
protozoa are fast evolving [28]. The apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum lacks many ciliary genes,
consistent to the idea that the apicomplexan parasites
may have an entirely different ciliary assembly mechanism [29]. Among the 51 sequenced fungi, we found only
two species, Allomyces macrogynus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, have conserved IFT genes (Figure
1). Interestingly, both species lack most components of
the BBS complex. These observations are consistent with
previous proposal that cilia were lost independently in
many fungal species in evolution [30,31]. Taken together,
our comparative identification and analysis of IFT genes
suggest that IFT genes are deeply conserved and can be
found in all metazoans, most unicellular eukaryotes, and
some fungi, but they do not exist in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and prokaryotes [1,21] (Figure 1).
Molecular evolution of RFX TFs

Using well defined RFX DBD peptide sequences (76
amino acids long) (Figure 2) from human [16], C. elegans
[3], D. Melanogaster [13], and S. Cerevisae [32] as queries,
we searched the genomes of the same 153 species for RFX
TFs. Because the known RFX DBDs in yeast as well as
humans show very high similarity, we used very stringent
criteria to look for new RFX TFs. We only consider proteins whose putative RFX DBD show at least 40% percentage identity (PID) to the queries (see Methods). RFX
DBD has been shown to contain nine residues that have
direct contact with DNA sequences (X-box motifs) [33].
All nine residues are highly conserved in all known RFX
DBDs (Figure 2). Therefore we also required that the

Figure 1 The conservation of RFX TFs and ciliary IFT components in selected species. These species were selected to provide a wide sampling
of the "tree of life". The phylogenetic relationship between each species was derived from the "Tree of Life Web Project" [44]. Species indicated with
"*" have ciliated cells based on published evidence. The 'RFX #' column shows the number of putative RFX TFs identified in this project or reported
previously. The grey scale table shows the sequence conservation of individual ciliary components in each species. Darker shade represents higher
sequence similarity and conservation. The numbers in each box indicate the percent identity revealed by the alignments between IFT genes and their
corresponding human orthologs.

DBDs of candidate RFX TFs contain all of these nine conserved residues.
We found candidate RFX TFs in all sequenced metazoan genomes (Figure 1). In addition to the RFX TFs that
have been reported previously, including seven RFX TFs
found in mammals [16], DAF-19 in C. elegans [3], and
dRFX [13], we found many RFX genes that have not been
described previously. We have identified seven RFX genes
(RFX1-7) in all vertebrate genomes except fish genomes,

Figure 2 DBDs of RFX TFs are highly conserved. Representative DBDs from humans (hRFX1-7), C. elegans (DAF-19), D. melanogaster (dRFX), S. serevisiae (sRFX1), and M. brevicollis (Mbre_cRFX1 and Mbre_cRFX2). DBDs from different species show high similarity at the peptide level. Nine residues
of DBD that directly contact DNA (indicated by arrows) are essentially identical for all RFX TFs.

including C. elegans are the only organisms that possess
just one RFX gene.
RFX TFs are also found in some non-metazoans. Of the
51 fungus species examined, we identified single RFX TFs
in 44 species, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, as previously reported [17], as well as a ciliated
fungus Allomyces macrogynus, whose genome was
recently sequenced by the Fungal Genome Initiative of
the Broad Institute http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/fungi/fgi/. All unicellular organisms we have
examined possess either one RFX gene (fungi) or none
except for the choanoflagellates. For example, M. brevicollis, which was recently sequenced [20], contain two
genes (Mbre_cRFX1 and Mbre_cRFX2) with well-defined
RFX DBDs.
RFX DBD sequences are the defining features of all
known RFXs and show high similarity (>40% PID) to each
other. However, there are a small number of additional
proteins that contain domains that show weaker similarity (<30% PID) to known RFX DBDs. In particular, a gene
(ARID2) in the human genome contains a RFX-like
domain that shows 29% PID to the human RFX1 DBD.
Among the nine residues that have direct contact with
DNA sequences, five can be found in the RFX-like
domain found in ARID2. ARID2, whose function as a
transcription factor has not been well studied, has
orthologs in all mammals as well as other vertebrates
(data not shown). Additionally, a gene in M. brevicollis
also shows weak similarity (27%) to known RFX DBDs
(five of the nine residues that have direct contact with
DNA are conserved). We name this novel gene
Mbre_cRFX3. Because of their low similarity to known
RFX DBDs, these RFX like genes--ARID2 and
Mbre_cRFX3--are not regarded as RFX TFs in this project and thus are not examined further. No RFX genes
have been found in any bacteria, ancient bacteria, or
plants (Figure 1).
DBDs in the two putative RFX TFs in M. brevicollis are
essentially indistinguishable from the DBDs in previously
characterized RFX TFs with ~70% PID at the peptide
level. All nine residues that make direct contacts with Xbox motifs are conserved [33] (Figure 2, residues indicated with arrows). In addition to the DBDs,
Mbre_cRFX1 also shares other functional domains within
known RFX TFs including the dimerization domains
(DD), and the extended dimerization domains (B and C
domains), which exist in all mammalian RFX TFs except
RFX5 and RFX7 [16,17] (Figure 3). Aligning Mbre_cRFX1
to human RFX1-3 shows clear alignment for conserved
DBD, DD, and extended dimerization domains (B and C
domains) (Figure 4). None of the M. brevicollis RFX TFs
have readily identifiable activation domains (AD). The
lack of typical AD in RFX TFs in M. brevicollis, C. elegans,

Page 4 of 10

D. melanogaster, and sea anemone (Figure 3) suggests
that AD might have been acquired later in metazoan evolution. Alternatively, their ADs have yet to be identified
and characterized. Mbre_cRFX2 has a readily identifiable
DBD but lacks other conserved domains, which is similar
to the human RFX5 and RFX7 that lack other domains
(Figure 3). The presence of DBD (in both Mbre_cRFX1
and Mbre_cRFX2) and other conserved protein domains
(in Mbre_cRFX1) suggest that they may function in transcriptional regulation of gene expression in M. brevicollis.
However, their target genes remain to be identified.
To further examine the relationship between the M.
brevicollis RFX TFs and those identified in mammals and
other species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree that
contains all known and putative RFX TFs based on the
similarity between the DBD domains (Figure 5).
Sequences outside of the DBDs are excluded from analysis since they are often very diverse and are not readily
alignable. Previous analysis of mammalian RFX TFs
revealed three groups: RFX1-3, RFX4-RFX6, and RFX5RFX7 groups [16], which is generally consistent with this
phylogenetic tree with newly identified members (Figure
5). The tree shown in Figure 5 contains an additional
clade (shown in black), which contains RFX TFs identified in fungal genomes and, interestingly, dRFX2 in D.
melanogaster [14]. Fungus RFX RFs (members in the
Fungus clade) and RFX5-RFX7 TFs show similar domain
compositions with all members lacking B, C, and D
domains, which are found in the RFX1-3 and RFX4-RFX6
TFs (Figure 3). The inferred phylogenetic tree clearly
shows that the Mbre_cRFX1 fits into the RFX1-3 group,
while Mbre_cRFX2 fits into the RFX4-6 group.
Mbre_cRFX3, which show weaker similarity to known
DBDs, clusters closer to DBDs of the RFX5-7 groups.
However, as mentioned before, we did not include
Mbre_cRFX3 in the phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic
relationship between M. brevicollis and previously identified RFX TFs suggest that these three RFX TFs families
were established before the split between choanoflagellates and metazoans.
In the inferred phylogenetic tree, the nematodes are the
only metazoans that have only one RFX TF--DAF-19,
which groups together with the mammalian RFX1-3
group (Figure 5). It was proposed previously that prior to
the complete sequencing of the C. elegans genome, more
RFX TFs should exist in C. elegans [17]. However, exhaustive searches of the completed C. elegans genome
revealed no traces of additional RFX genes, suggesting
that RFX genes corresponding to other RFX groups
(RFX4-6 and RFX5-7) were lost in the last common
ancestor of the nematode species. In fact, none of the
seven sequenced nematode genomes have more than one
RFX TF (Additional file 1).

Evolutionary relationship between ciliary genes and RFX
TFs

The above comprehensive identification of IFT genes and
RFX TFs shows clearly that all metazoans have both ciliary genes and RFX genes. Since IFT genes have been

demonstrated to be regulated by RFX TFs in C. elegans,
D. melanogaster, and humans, IFT genes in all metazoans
are likely regulated by RFX TFs. Our analysis strongly
suggests that IFT genes and RFX TFs evolved independently. In addition to the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) and

Figure 5 The phylogenetic tree of all RFX DBDs found in this study. Each distinct group of RFX is labeled. Labels for each putative RFX refer to
records in Additional file 1. The colored branches indicate three major groups of RFX TFs: RFX1-3 in red, RFX4-6 in green, and RFX5-7 in blue. The fish
RFX8 TFs cluster with the RFX1-3 group, while the fish RFX9 TFs cluster with the RFX5-7 group. All nematodes are grouped together (labeled DAF-19)
with the RFX1-3 group. Some insects RFX TFs (labeled as dRFX) group with RFX1-3, while others (labeled dRFX1) with RFX5-7. M. brevicollis (cRFX1 and
cRFX2) are shown in open squares (ᮀ). Drosophila dRFX2 [14] is shown in the tree but it is not found in the sequenced D. melanogaster genome nor
any sequenced Drosophila genome. It is likely located in the heterochromatic region (William Gelbart, personal communication). The phylogenetic tree
was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [45]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA4 [46].

fission yeast (S. pombe), we have identified 41 fungus species that have single RFX genes but no IFT genes, thus
RFX genes in these species do not regulate ciliary genes
expression. Indeed, Crt1/RFX in the budding yeast plays
a role in DNA damage response [34]. Outside of metazoans, only two sequenced genomes have both IFT and RFX
genes, the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis and the fungus
A. macrogynus. Outside of metazoans, choanoflagellates,

and fungi, none of the sequenced genomes possess a single RFX gene, regardless of the possession of IFT genes.

Discussion
This is the first project to comprehensively identify and
compare RFX TFs in the entire "tree of life" since Emery
and colleagues described RFXs in humans (RFX1-5),
mice (RFX1-3 and RFX5), C. elegans, and the budding

Chu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:130

and fission yeasts domains more than a decade ago [17].
In this paper, we identified for the first time (1) nine RFX
genes in all sequenced fish genomes; (2) two RFX genes in
the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis genome; (3) single
RFX genes in many fungus genomes. Additionally, we
have identified RFX genes in many vertebrates. Furthermore, we have identified a third RFX (dRFX1) in the fruit
fly D. melanogaster. Based on our phylogenetic analysis of
all RFX TFs identified in the "tree of life", we have confirmed the hypothesis proposed by Emery and colleagues
that C. elegans has lost RFX genes as it evolved [17].
More importantly, comparative analysis of the molecular evolution of IFT genes and RFX genes revealed a compelling converging relationship between these two gene
groups, which is summarized in a model illustrated in
Figure 6. We propose that the common ancestor of metazoans, choanoflagellates, and fungi was ciliated and had
one RFX gene. Even though the common ancestor of all
fungus species was ciliated and had one RFX gene in
some fungus species, including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, inherited cilia but lost RFX, while other species, including budding yeast and fission yeast, lost their
cilia but retained RFX, and some species, including Cryptococcus neoformans grubii, lost both cilia and RFX TFs,
leaving only a few fungal species, including Allomyces

Figure 6 RFX TF-mediated transcription and the origin of metazoans. The common ancestor of metazoans, choanoflagellates, and
fungi was likely a ciliated unicellular eukaryote with a single RFX TF.
Over the course of evolution, some fungi lost RFX TFs while preserving
cilia, some lost cilia but kept RFX, and some lost both. Only a few fungi
kept both cilia and RFX. The last common ancestor (LCA) of Monosiga
and metazoans preserved both cilia and RFX.

macrogynus, that retain both RFX TFs and cilia (Figure 1
and Figure 6). In ciliated fungus species, which do not
have RFX genes, ciliary genes are likely regulated by factors other than RFX TFs. In contrast, the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates was ciliated and
had multiple RFX genes. The plurality of RFX genes was
probably due to gene duplication (Figure 6). The expansion of the RFX gene family, in the common ancestor of
metazoans and choanoflagellates, might have provided a
platform for the development of interactions between
RFX TFs and IFT genes and the establishment of transcriptional regulatory relationships between RFX TFs and
IFT genes in metazoans. The convergent molecular evolution of IFT genes and RFX TFs might have provided a
pivotal driving force in the emergence and evolution of
metazoans.
The evolution of multicellular metazoans from a unicellular protozoan ancestor represents a major and what
we consider to be the most spectacular transition in the
"history of life". This transition is demonstrated by the
abrupt appearance of a huge variety of metazoans in the
fossil record approximately 560 million years ago during
the Cambrian explosion [35]. Many environmental, ecological, and other evolutionary factors have been proposed to have contributed to this transition [36,37]. Great
efforts have been made to understand this transition by
studying protein-coding regions of numerous genes and
gene families that are ubiquitous in and limited to metazoans. Findings obtained in these studies showed that
many genes and gene families previously found to be
expressed only in metazoans are also found in choanoflagellates giving evidence that metazoans arose from choanoflagellates. For example, work by King and colleagues
clearly demonstrated that choanoflagellates have a receptor tyrosine kinase that is found in metazoans but not in
other eukaryotes [35]. Manning and colleagues searched
the sequenced choanoflagellates M. brevicollis genome
[20], and identified a highly elaborate tyrosine kinase signaling network [38]. Many additional genes are shared by
M. brevicollis and metazoans, including cadherin, which
are essential for metazoan development [39], and transcription factors such as P53 and Myc [20]. These findings encouraged additional large scale searches, including
the UNICORN (unicellular opisthokont research initiative) project [36], for genes and gene families critical for
the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity.
However, accumulating evidence is showing that these
genes predated the origin of metazoans and played different roles from their counterparts in metazoans. Thus
these genes, even though some have been co-opted to
perform novel functions in metazoans, are probably not
be the main driving force underlying the transition from
unicellular protozoans to multicelluar metazoans.

Chu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/130

What then was the main factor driving this transition?
In contrast to coding sequences of genes, which are usually under strong purifying selection, regulatory
sequences show much more rapid evolution. Compelling
evidence suggests that changes in cis-regulatory
sequences and transcriptional regulation in general play a
pivotal role in evolution [37,40]. Kingsley and colleagues
recently identified changes in cis-regulatory modules that
dictate dramatic changes in pigmentation in sticklebacks
and humans [41]. Thus the transition from unicellular
flagellates to multicellular metazoans may have been
driven by innovations at the transcriptional level. The
convergent evolution of RFX TFs and ciliary genes (IFT
genes in particular) in the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates prompt us to propose that the
acquired tight control of ciliary genes at the transcription
level by RFX TFs served as one of the critical driving
forces in the establishment of multicellularity and the rise
of metazoans.

Conclusion
RFX TFs and IFT genes evolved independently in premetazoans and their convergence, or the acquired transcriptional regulation of IFT genes by RFX TFs, may have
played a pivotal role in the establishment of metazoan.
Methods
Data sources

All sequence data (both genomic DNA sequences and
gene annotation data including cDNA and protein
sequences) were downloaded from public databases. The
list of genomes and the data source are described in
Additional file 2. The initial set of DNA binding domains
that were used as queries for BLAST searches were taken
from Human RFX1-7 [16], C. elegans DAF-19 [3], D. melanogaster dRFX [13], and yeast RFX1 [32].
Identification of RFX TFs

We carried out similarity searches using WU-BLAST
(version 2.2.6; http://blast.wustl.edu) with e-value 0.01
and without sequence filter (option -F). The initial set of
DBDs was used as query to search against all the mammalian proteomes (entire collection of protein peptides).
The resulting DBDs were added to the query list and used
to search against arthropods. The iteration of adding
DBD and blasting continues until all species have been
searched. A hit is accepted as a candidate DBD if the corrected percent identity over the entire domain length is
>= 40%. The corrected percent identity was calculated as
the number of identical positions divided by total length
of the query. We also searched for candidate RFX TFs in
genome sequences (DNA sequences) to ensure that no
RFX TFs have been missed in the gene annotations.

and without sequence filter (without -F). Human protein
sequences were taken from NCBI and used as queries
(See accession number in Additional file 3). PID was calculated as the number of identical amino acids reported
by WU-BLAST over the entire length of the query.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis was done using MEGA4 [42]. Multiple sequence alignment was done using CLUSTALW
(included in META4) with default settings. Phylogenetic
trees were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method.
Functional domain identification and analysis

Sequences for activation, B, C, and D domains were taken
from previous publications. The multiple sequence alignment was performed for each domain and used as input
for hmmbuild to generate a HMM profile for each
domain. hmmsearch was used to scan the proteome of
selected species to find regions of similar profile. Both
hmmbuild and hmmsearch are part of the HMMER suite
[43]http://hmmer.janelia.org.

Additional material
Additional file 1 List of all putative RFX genes. All RFX TF genes identified and shown in Figure 5 are included in the table contained in this file.
For each RFX gene, the table provides an ID (shown in the first and second
columns) that is used for display in Figure 5, species name, common name
of the species, phylum, proposed gene name, chromosomal coordinates, as
well as the sequence of the RFX DBD identified in the gene.
Additional file 2 List of genomes processed in this project. This file lists
genomes that are found to contain RFX TF genes. For each genome, the file
provides the species name, database from which the genome is downloaded and the version of the database.
Additional file 3 Database information of the IFT genes used as queries. List of IFT genes and their corresponding NCBI accession numbers.
