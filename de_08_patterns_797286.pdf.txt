Abstract
Background: Different regions in a genome evolve at different rates depending on structural and
functional constraints. Some genomic regions are highly conserved during metazoan evolution,
while other regions may evolve rapidly, either in all species or in a lineage-specific manner. A strong
or even moderate change in constraints in functional regions, for example in coding regions, can
have significant evolutionary consequences.
Results: Here we discuss a novel framework, 'BaseDiver', to classify groups of genes in humans
based on the patterns of evolutionary constraints on polymorphic positions in their coding regions.
Comparing the nucleotide-level divergence among mammals with the extent of deviation from the
ancestral base in the human lineage, we identify patterns of evolutionary pressure on
nonsynonymous base-positions in groups of genes belonging to the same functional category.
Focussing on groups of genes in functional categories, we find that transcription factors contain a
significant excess of nonsynonymous base-positions that are conserved in other mammals but
changed in human, while immunity related genes harbour mutations at base-positions that evolve
rapidly in all mammals including humans due to strong preference for advantageous alleles. Genes
involved in olfaction also evolve rapidly in all mammals, and in humans this appears to be due to
weak negative selection.
Conclusion: While recent studies have identified genes under positive selection in humans, our
approach identifies evolutionary constraints on Gene Ontology groups identifying changes in
humans relative to some of the other mammals.

Background
Evolution of eukaryotic genomes is predominantly driven
by sequence divergence, insertion, deletion, duplication
and recombination, which have introduced enormous
diversity into eukaryotic genome architecture. Different
regions of a genome evolve at different rates depending on
structural and functional constraints [1-3]. Interestingly
some regions evolve rapidly only in a given species due to

a lineage-specific change in constraints which may affect
phenotype [4,5].
The temporal and functional character of evolutionary
constraints across genomes, especially in the human lineage, has been of considerable interest recently. Much of
this has revolved around non-coding regions. For example, highly conserved elements between human and

fugu [6] and between human, mouse and rat [7] have
been identified. Pollard et al [4] identified genomic
regions that are highly conserved over large evolutionary
distance between chicken and chimpanzee but have
undergone accelerated evolution specifically in the
human lineage.
There have been studies of individual coding regions of
the human genome, such as the MHC locus [8], which has
a high degree of diversity in the human population. In
coding regions, even a moderate change can have a significant consequence, such as the allelic variants of the mu
opioid receptor (OPRM1) that is responsible for perception of pain and addiction to drugs in human subjects [9].
A change in constraint on a single locus can influence
other genes and have significant phenotypic effects. One
classic example is the FOXP2 gene, which is required for
brain development associated with motor control of the
larynx and mouth, and crucial for developing the articulate speech characteristic of humans [10]. Although the
gene is highly conserved within mammals, two of the
three amino-acid differences between humans and mice
appeared in the human lineage after the separation from
the common ancestor with chimpanzee, showing that
even small sequence changes can have significant functional consequences [11]. These observations motivated
us to focus on the evolutionary patterns in coding regions
where most of the base positions are under functional
constraints.
Patterns of conservation of genes of different functions are
well studied over long evolutionary timescales (reviewed
in [12]). For example, different protein families show
characteristic patterns of expansion with organismic complexity and genome size [13,14]. Genes involved in core
metabolic processes are more conserved [15] while those
involved in regulatory [16,17] and peripheral processes
like immune response [18] or receptors evolve rapidly.
Genes involved in development and organogenesis are
fairly conserved in mammals but are quite divergent
between vertebrates and invertebrates [12].
At the same time, shorter evolutionary timescales are
addressed by comparative genomics and population
genetics based studies that scan for genes under recent
positive selection in the human genome [19-22]. Several
studies have developed methods to incorporate functional information on codon and amino acid substitution
to provide a more integrated prediction of selection
(reviewed in [23]). Kim and colleagues have studied relationship between positive selection and protein interaction network topology in human and found that proteins
located at the periphery of the network and cellular
periphery are subject to increased adaptive evolution [24].
Although long-term divergence patterns have been stud-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/275

ied in great detail, the patterns of recent evolution of
human genes in different functional categories and their
effects on selection have not been combined. The classic
McDonald-Kreitman test identifies signatures of natural
selection by comparing the density of between-species
fixed differences (dN/dS) with that of within-species polymorphisms (pN/pS) in coding regions [18]. However,
resequencing data for many individuals is needed to do
this, and this is still much less common at present than
genotyping data. Recently in the targeted analysis of 1% of
the human genome as part of the ENCODE Project (pilot
phase), the ENCODE consortium compared human polymorphism data (DAF) and comparative genomics data
(GERP score), and found significant negative correlation
([25], Supplementary Figure 40). Here we have developed
a novel method in order to harness the potential of the
flood of human genotyping data as well as the complete
mammalian genome sequences.
We call our novel method 'BaseDiver', and use it to identify sets of genes based on patterns of evolutionary constraints on nonsynonymous coding positions in them.
Focussing on genes grouped according to function, we ask
whether a functional category harbours an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphic coding positions showing specific signatures of constraints, and more interestingly
recent changes in evolutionary constraints specifically in
the human lineage. Integrating our findings with reports
on natural selection on human genes we investigate what
evolutionary trends are associated with natural selection
on genes, and pinpoint cases where humans accumulate
mutations at positions that are conserved in several other
mammals.

Results
In our analysis, we integrate short and long term evolution at nonsynonymous coding base positions to capture
patterns of evolutionary constraints at the level of functional categories of genes. At a polymorphic nonsynonymous base position we study two parameters, (a) longterm evolution: the extent of divergence at that base position among mammals, measured by the GERP (Genome
Evolutionary Rate Profiling) score [26] and (b) short-term
evolution: the deviation from the base present in the common ancestor of the hominoids in the human lineage,
measured by derived allele frequency (DAF) [27] (Figure
1A). The GERP score reflects the average degree of conservation of a nucleotide position among mammals. The
derived allele frequency quantifies the extent humans
have diverged away from the base present in the common
ancestor of the hominoids. The distributions of DAF and
GERP scores for nonsynonymous SNPs are shown in
Additional File 1 and 2, respectively.

Patterns of evolutionary constraints in the human genome. (A) An example is shown where two statistics are studied
at a polymorphic coding nucleotide position. The first is short term evolution as derived allele frequency (DAF), reflecting the
of drift from the base present in the common ancestor of human and chimpanzee towards a new base in the human lineage.
The second is long term evolution (GERP) or the extent of divergence of that base across the mammals considered. Please
note that only a few mammals are shown to maintain clarity. (B) At a polymorphic position, integrating short and long term
evolution, four basic patterns of evolutionary constraints are possible. Divergence at a base-position among mammals is estimated by the GERP (Genome Evolutionary Rate Profiling) score.

Integrating recent (DAF) and long-term (GERP) evolution
we categorise the trend at base-position into four basic
patterns as shown in Figure 1B, and capture the landscape
of evolutionary dynamics at those positions. By considering all nonsynonymous coding base positions of genes in
a functional category, we ask whether the category harbours a significant excess of polymorphic nonsynonymous base-positions compared to the background of all
nonsynonmous polymorphic positions in genes. If there
is a significant difference compared to the whole genome,
we categorise it according to the trends shown in Figure
1B. The complete pipeline of this method, that we call
BaseDiver, is shown in Figure 2.
Based on the GERP score, we bin the extent of long-term
evolution among mammals of a nucleotide position as
conserved (<-1), intermediate (between -1 and 1) and divergent (>1). At the same time, we group the short-term pattern of evolution measured by DAF as low
(0.05<DAF<0.33), intermediate (0.33≤DAF≤0.67) and
high (0.95>DAF>0.67). Accordingly we construct a 3 × 3
divergence-DAF matrix and place SNPs in appropriate
bins based on their GERP score and derived allele frequency as shown in Figure 2B and Additional File 3.
We define the background distribution as the GERP-DAF
distribution calculated from all polymorphic nonsynonymous coding base-positions in the human genome and
compare the relative abundance of SNPs in different bins
of the matrix in a given functional category of genes with
the background (see Figure 2C and Methods for details).
Thus our null hypothesis is all polymorphic nonsynonymous coding positions in a functional category have a
similar GERP-DAF distribution as the background. Our
null model is simple and avoided explicit assignment of
values for parameters associated with neutral evolution,
many of which can be assigned only empirically. We compare this null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis, that the GERP-DAF distribution of a functional
category is different from the background, using a chisquare test (8 degrees of freedom) and assess its significance. Focussing on genes grouped by Gene Ontology
(GO) functional categories, we are able to identify functional categories that have a significant excess of polymorphic nonsynonymous base-positions that show specific
signatures of evolutionary constraints in the human lineage. We flag a functional category as significant if the
divergence-DAF pattern is significantly different from that
of the background in at least three out of the four HapMap
populations (p-value < 0.05 without Bonferroni correction) [28]. Categories significantly different from the
genomic background are shown in Additional File 4. In all
cases studied, the signature was significant even after Bonferroni correction in at least one HapMap population. To
summarize our observations, we grouped the functional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/275

categories by their divergence-DAF pattern using a hierarchical clustering method (please refer to Methods for
details). Four clusters emerge, each of which is homogeneous in terms of biological function. The clusters of significant categories are shown in Figure 3, and the
characteristics of the clusters are described below. We
identified the evolutionary trends associated with each
cluster by considering the patterns of constraints on polymorphic base positions from the GERP-DAF distribution
as well as the GERP distribution of all coding positions,
and information available from the literature, as discussed
below.
BaseDiver Cluster I (Human-specific mutation)
Categories in this cluster are listed in the top left panel of
Figure 3. In these categories, the GERP-only distribution
of all coding bases of genes in the category exhibits more
conservation across mammals than the background of all
coding bases in the genome. At the same time, the GERPDAF distribution shows that there is an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphic positions with high conservation
in mammals and high derived allele frequency in
humans, suggesting the positions are evolving in a manner unique to humans. All the categories in this cluster
revolve around regulation of transcription. While a recent
study reports positive selection on transcription factors by
considering about 10,000 genes [20], our work at the
whole-genome scale shows that transcriptional regulation-related categories are enriched in nonsynonymous
positions that have on average high evolutionary conservation in the other mammals but also high derived allele
frequency in human. This observation correlates well with
the recent finding that primate promoters show accelerated evolution [29] and that human transcription factors
have accelerated evolution in terms of expression pattern
[30]. Although many such genes or functional categories
as a whole may be under positive selection simultaneously in human and other mammals [31], the functional
consequences of the mutated base-positions in humans
are likely to be unique.

Note that it is less likely that the other mammalian species
are polymorphic at same conserved nonsynonymous
positions, and it is even more unlikely that the base in the
reference sequence corresponds to minor allele. That
means our overall interpretation will not be influenced by
polymorphism at the same position in other mammalian
species.
Lineage-specific changes in constraints on functionally
important positions may have a significant impact, which
may not always be identified by a conventional scan for
positive selection. While, for the majority of the proteins,
a lack of structural data prevents us from identifying the
physicochemical consequences of individual polymor-

Patterns3of altered evolutionary constraints on different functional categories
Figure
Patterns of altered evolutionary constraints on different functional categories. Four clusters of functional categories obtained by hierarchical clustering with characteristic deviations from the genome-wide divergence-DAF distributions are
shown. For each cluster, a representative 3 × 3 normalized divergence-DAF matrix (left), 3 × 1 coding GERP matrix (middle)
and signature of constraints (right) are provided. Representative matrices are the average of the patterns of all functional categories within the cluster, across all populations. The colour codes of the divergence-DAF matrix and coding GERP matrix are
same as in Figure 2C. Signatures of constraints are as in Figure 1. Only functional categories for which signatures are significant
in at least three out of four HapMap populations (without Bonferroni correction) are shown. Individual patterns of divergenceDAF matrices for all these functional categories in each population are shown in Additional File 4.

phisms, we can highlight several potentially interesting
instances. For example, ZNF228 (ENSP00000346305) a
Kruppel-like C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor
expressed mainly in heart and haematopoietic tissue has a
low (<1) dN/dS ratio with chimpanzee, but harbours
three SNPs in the DNA binding domain. One of them
(rs2722722: H484Y) is probably in contact with DNA, as
an equivalent residue in a homologous structure shares a
large interface area with DNA (1MEY:C19; area = 47.1 Å2)
as shown in Figure 4A. The nucleotide position is fairly
conserved in mammals (GERP score: -0.81) but has been
subject to selection in humans as apparent from the high
derived allele frequency (DAF ∈ 0.5 – 0.75) in all four
HapMap populations and high linkage disequilibrium
(LD) value (>1.4) in Asian and European populations
[22]. A list of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in DNAbinding domains of genes in Cluster I, which can potentially influence DNA-binding properties, is given in Figure
4B. Experimental characterization could reveal the functional consequences of these polymorphisms in humans.

In this analysis we were restricted to using only common
SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05) from the HapMap
project, and this increased the proportion of SNPs with
intermediate and high allele frequency in the background
distribution as compared to those expected under a neutral model. In addition, several functional categories did
not have a sufficient number of SNPs to perform statistical
analysis. Therefore it is likely that, when resequencing
based dense genotype data is available we will gain
increased power to detect many more functional categories that contain an excess of mutations with derived allele
frequency higher than the background, and in particular,
those with the signature of Cluster I.
BaseDiver Cluster II (Diversifying selection)
Adaptive processes such as those involved in defense and
immune response evolve rapidly in mammals. In these
categories, we find an overrepresentation of SNPs with
either high or low DAF, while SNPs with intermediate
DAF are underrepresented (Figure 3). This means that the
adaptive advantage of either allele has lead to its near fixation. One classic example that illustrates this trend

within a single locus in two populations is the FY*O allele
at the Duffy locus that is well known for association with
malaria resistance and sickle cell anaemia. The derived
allele is near fixation in sub-Saharan Africa but is rare in
other parts of the world [32,33]. Large divergence of coding bases in mammals and a strong tendency for rapid fixation of one allele is characteristic of this cluster. Due to
the strong signature they leave on the genome, such loci
are often identified in scans for positive selection [20-22].
We found several cases where the derived allele frequency
differs widely between populations. Some of the genes are
associated with immunity. For example, KLRD2 is
expressed in NK cells and participate in immune response.
A list of the common nonsynonymous SNPs whose DAF
between HapMap populations differ by >0.75 are listed in
Additional File 5. Function of many of the genes is
unknown, and our dataset provides an attractive set of
candidates to investigate further.
BaseDiver Cluster III (Reduced constraints)
In this cluster, which contains genes involved in perception
of smell, the coding bases evolve rapidly in mammals suggesting reduced constraints on coding base-positions. In
addition, there is an excess of nonsynonymous SNPs with
intermediate DAF showing relaxed constraints in humans
as well. A recent study shows that olfactory receptors are
significantly over-represented in human-specific pseudogenes [34], providing further evidence of reduced constraints. Intermediate allele frequency can also arise
through balancing selection, where hemizygotes have a
selective advantage, thus increasing diversity in a population. However, we infer that an abundance of nonsynonymous SNPs with intermediate DAF, high divergence
among mammals and a large number of human pseudogenes points to reduced constraints on these genes in
humans. Nevertheless, lineage-specific expansion of these
genes makes ortholog detection unreliable and may complicate the patterns of segregation of SNPs therein. So one
must be cautious about inferring selection and signatures
of constraints on these genes.
BaseDiver Cluster IV (Strong negative selection)
In this cluster, the coding bases are highly conserved in
mammals as shown by the GERP distribution. Polymorphisms occur primarily at bases with a divergent history,
and get fixed relatively rapidly, as we observe an excess of
SNPs with high GERP score and high or low DAF. Thus,
overall there are strong constraints on coding bases both
in mammals and in the human lineage. There is only one
category in this cluster: Hydrolase activity. This cluster is
small, because the genomewide constraint on coding
bases is generally negative selection, and few categories
are constrained significantly beyond this background.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/275

These patterns of evolutionary constraints are consistent
across the four HapMap populations (see Additional File
4). To check if the parent-child relationship among GO
categories [35,36] bias our observation, we repeated the
analysis using the PANTHER classification scheme [37]
(see Additional File 6) and found consistent results.
Comparison with other studies and integration of evolutionary
constraints and natural selection
Several recent studies have used various genomic features
to identify genes under positive selection in the human
lineage. Here we attempt to gain new insights into patterns of evolutionary constraints associated with selection
by integrating findings of BaseDiver with signatures of
positive selection on human genes from three large-scale
studies that use different genomic features to infer selection and focus on different timescale. Briefly, Nielsen et al
[21] used fixed differences between orthologous human
and chimpanzee genes and identified selection that is primarily 2–6 million years old. Bustamante et al [20] use a
modified McDonald Kreitman test using both fixed differences between human-chimpanzee and polymorphism
data within the human lineage to infer strongly selected
genes over a similar timeframe. Both these works used resequencing of protein-coding regions to identify variation
within and between species. Voight et al [22] used linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimated by iHS statistic to identify
loci which have been under selection in the last
45,000–70,000 years. Using the HapMap data, they identified signatures of positive selection on one allele over
another in recent evolutionary time. In contrast to the previous two methods, the analysis depends on tag-SNPs and
does not involve re-sequencing.

These studies use various different approaches to identify
signatures of selection. Unlike these approaches, our
method does not use a neutral model and therefore is not
an explicit test for natural selection. BaseDiver identifies
patterns of evolutionary constraints on base-positions
polymorphic in a lineage by comparing to a background
dataset that is itself under purifying selection (all nsSNPs).
This provides insights complementary to those in the previous studies. Here we qualitatively compare our results
with the findings of three studies on selection at the level
of functional categories. The functional categories in our
Clusters I, II and III are repeatedly identified as being
under positive selection in previous work (Table 1). By
inspecting the difference between the patterns in the three
Clusters, our results provide information about the evolution of these categories beyond positive selection, as
explained in the following paragraphs. Using BaseDiver
we can further differentiate functional categories of genes,
which are classified as being under positive selection in
the three studies, based on the patterns of evolutionary

constraints on the mutated base-positions on genes in
those categories.
The studies by Bustamante et al. and Voight et al. identify
significant signatures of selection on genes involved in
transcription (Cluster I) while our findings highlight that
these categories harbour an excess of polymorphic bases
are likely to be unique to humans. Taken together, our
results suggest that, although transcription factors may
also be under selection in other primates [31], positive
selection on transcription factors has unique consequences in human.

The genes involved in defense and immunity (Cluster II),
evolve rapidly under strong selection pressure both within
and between species. Previous work (Table 1) shows that
these genes are under positive selection between species.
We find that these genes diverge quickly in mammals and
in human contain an excess of polymorphic loci that
show strong preference for one allele over the other, suggesting diversifying selection. Strong selection pressure on
the immune system to cope with changing environment
and disease, and response to stress, drive the selection on
these genes over a broad evolutionary time-spectrum.
Cluster III represents genes involved in perception of
smell. We see rapid evolution of these genes in mammals,

and our finding of intermediate allele frequency for
mutated nonsynonymous bases in these genes in human,
suggest that positive selection on these genes is not driven
by the same evolutionary forces as in the case of Cluster I
& II. Taking our results together with the finding that a
large number of remnants of olfactory receptors in the
pool of human pseudogenes [34], we conclude that these
genes are under reduced constraints in human. However,
lineage-specific expansion and copy number variation of
gene families involved in olfaction [38] may complicate
the orthology detection and influence the signature of
selection detected.
While the recent studies including the three mentioned
above identify signatures of natural selection on proteincoding genes, our approach adds value by providing information about how instances of positive selection can have
different evolutionary footprints, and possibly have different functional implications. The above comparison of
different studies highlights that although genes involved
in diverse biological processes like transcription, defense
and immunity have all been subject to positive selection
in the human lineage, our results show that there are differences in the patterns of evolutionary constraints
between these functional categories. Some of these
changes are unique to humans, and may make a significant contribution towards the difference between us and
other mammals.

Discussion
Genotyping and sequencing of a number of eukaryotic
genomes provide us with an opportunity to study the temporal and functional character of evolutionary changes in
metazoans. Here we provide a framework for identifying
changes in evolutionary constraints on mutated positions
in the human genome. Due to lack of SNP data, in the current analysis we captured only higher order patterns at the
level of functional categories. But upon availability of
resequencing data, using BaseDiver it is possible to
achieve higher resolution. In this work we restricted the
use of BaseDiver to coding regions only, where most of
the base positions are under selection and the effects of
hitchhiking are small, it can be used to identify changes in
constraints in non-coding regions as well.
Recently outliers of evolutionary patterns like ultra-conserved elements in higher eukaryotes and highly accelerated regions in humans have been identified [4,7]; here
we attempt to capture the comprehensive spectrum of
evolution of coding regions using BaseDiver. We study the
tempo of recent patterns of constraints on human genes
grouped by their functional categories and identify which
categories are under altered constraints in humans only
and which are evolving rapidly in related species. While
recent studies have reported several functional categories

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/275

under positive selection in the human lineage, we go further by characterising the particular evolutionary pattern
of altered constraints in each category. Our study uncovers
that different functional categories under positive selection during human evolution are under different evolutionary constraints, and some of them (e.g. transcription
factors) are accumulating an excess of nonsynonymous
mutations in humans at positions that are conserved in
other mammals.
As Zhang and colleagues report [31], we agree that many
genes and functional categories may also be under altered
constraints in chimpanzee or other mammals, but the
mutated base positions and hence functional consequences are likely to be different from those in human.
Summarizing our observations and putting them in the
context of recent work, we find that:
(1) Transcription factors show a significant excess of nonsynonymous positions under accelerated evolution specifically in humans. Changes in evolutionary constraints on
some of the loci in transcription factors may have a significant functional consequence, as in the case of ZNF228.
Such small-scale changes on transcription factors in turn
can introduce large-scale transcriptome-level changes via
downstream target genes. In 1975, King and Wilson
observed that the sequence-level difference between
human and chimpanzee is small and proposed that regulatory changes may be important for the difference
between human and primates [39]. Consistent with the
hypothesis, several recent independent studies including
ours show that elevated cis- and trans-regulatory changes,
many of which are unique to humans, may have driven
the transcriptome evolution leading to humans [30,40].
(2) Immunity related genes evolve rapidly in mammals
including humans. Pressure to survive against pathogens
and environmental changes has imposed strong selection
on polymorphic positions, driving fixation of one allele
over another. Many of the loci showing strong signatures
of recent selection in the study by Voight et al. [22] are
involved in immune response.
(3) We also find that the genes involved in perception of
smell evolve rapidly in all mammals as well as in humans
suggesting that their evolution at a rate higher than the
neutral rate is not specific to humans. In our BaseDiver
analysis we find very few categories (e.g. Hydrolase activity)
showing signatures of strong constraints. Given that the
vast majority of coding regions are under some negative
selection, regions under very strong negative selection relative to the genomic background are rare. In addition,
these regions are less likely to harbour many polymorphic
loci and thus would remain undetected in a sparsely gen-

otyped human genome by our approach. BaseDiver will
be more effective in a densely genotyped map of the
human genome when it becomes available.

taurus – Btau_2.0), oppossum (Monodelphis domestica –
BROAD02). The results were also calculated using
Ensembl v. 42 and were consistent with Ensembl v.37.

The extent of evolutionary conservation of loci in coding
regions can be studied at various levels of granularity
when resequencing based polymorphism data will be
available for human.

Orthology detection
Orthologs of the human genes in these mammals were
taken from Ensembl-Compara v. 37 which used the bidirectional best-hit method to identify orthology. We considered only orthologs that were >100 amino acid long
aligned over at least 70% of the human protein. The conclusions in this work are consistent when we re-calculated
all results using Ensembl v. 42 which uses maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for orthology detection (data
not shown).

We wish to highlight two points. First, in this study we
have grouped genes based on semiautomated Gene
Ontology classification, and some of the categories are
very broad (e.g. metabolism contains genes that can be further sub-classified into finer categories). Therefore, our
observations depend on the accuracy with which genes are
assigned to GO ontology groups as well as the appropriateness of the ontology itself. Second, while integration of
data in a bottom-up approach helps us see overall constraints, imposed by functional categories for example, at
certain instances individual loci may be subject to different constraints. For example, categories involved in primary metabolism are under strong negative selection. But
the LCT locus, the functionality of which is responsible for
lactase persistence, has been under positive selection in
the European population [41]. It is likely that when several mutated nonsynonymous coding positions in a functional category are under similar constraints, they
cumulatively confer an overall characteristic signature of
evolutionary constraints on the functional category.
In this analysis, we were limited to using only the common SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) from the HapMap project. Upon availability of re-sequencing based
polymorphism data it will be possible to increase the
power of our method to detect more subtle patterns. In
addition, in a more densely genotyped map of the human
(or other species) genome, it will be possible to control
the level of granularity using BaseDiver and identify
changes in constraints at different levels. While other
methods identify signatures of selection in a genome
using different genomic features, our method provides a
complementary view identifying whether changes are specific to the reference organism. Availability of high quality
genome-wide polymorphism data in non-human species
will help us in the future to distinguish the patterns
observed in human from those in other species.

Methods
Mammalian genomes used
In the current analysis, coding sequences from eight mammalian genomes were taken from Ensembl v. 37: Human
(Homo sapiens – NCBI36), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes –
CHIMP1A), monkey (Macaca mulatta – MMUL_0_1),
mouse (Mus musculus – NCBIM34), rat (Rattus norvegicus
– RGSC3), dog (Canis familiaris – BROADD1), cow (Bos

Functional categories
Genes were grouped based on their involvement in Biological Processes and Molecular Functions according to
the Gene Ontology classification. If there were at least 100
SNPs in genes in a functional category, the category was
considered for BaseDiver analysis. 146 Biological Process
and 76 Molecular Function categories met this criterion.
The analysis was also performed using functional categories based on the PANTHER classification scheme [37]
(see Additional File 6).
Short-term evolution within human populations
To study the extent of short term evolution at the base
level in the human genome, we considered the nonsynonymous coding SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05
from the HapMap project [28] that has systematically genotyped 269 individuals in total from (i) a Chinese Han
population in Beijing (CHB), (ii) a Japanese population
from Tokyo (JPT), (iii) an African Yoruba population
from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) and (iv) a Caucasian European people from Utah (CEU). The CHB and JPT populations are 45 unrelated individuals each, and the YRI and
CEU populations are 30 parent-offspring trios. Data were
taken from the ENSEMBL repository http://
www.ensembl.org. There were about 10,000 SNPs in this
dataset.

By restricting ourselves to common nonsynonymous
SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05), we lose information
about rare SNPs, but avoid the problem of ascertainment
bias that is particularly relevant for these SNPs [42]. In
order to verify that the frequencies and coverage of the
common SNPs is good, we carried out comparisons with
Perlegen and ENCODE data (see Additional File 7).
To identify the ancestral state of the nondsynonymous
coding SNPs in human we aligned orthologus DNA
sequences based on the corresponding protein sequence
alignment between human and chimpanzee, and compared the human SNP with the base at that position in

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:275

chimpanzee. The allele matching the chimpanzee base
was considered as the ancestral allele, and the other allele
is taken as the derived allele (Figure 2A). It is possible that
(i) a SNP is older than speciation and exists both in
human and chimpanzee lineage or (ii) both human and
chimpanzee develop SNPs at same position independently. In both these cases ancestral allele determination is
difficult taking only chimpanzee base position as a reference, and a three-way analysis including macaque
genome can resolve the ambiguity [43].
For several reasons, we chose to determine the ancestral
allele by two-way and not three-way comparison. First,
limited genotyping found a very small number of polymorphic positions shared between human and chimpanzee (<0.4%) [44]. In nonsynonymous coding positions,
which are under constraints, the number of cases, where
both human and chimpanzee have accumulated mutations towards the same derived base (thus giving rise to
mis-prediction of the ancestral state) would be even
lower. Secondly, incorporation of the macaque genome
reduces the coverage significantly due to (i) presence of
gaps and (ii) different nucleotides at aligned positions, or
(iii) simply absence of orthologous genes. Thus, in coding
nonsynonymous positions, inclusion of the macaque
genome could contribute to a small increase in accuracy
(<0.5%) at the cost of a relatively large decrease (>20%)
in the size of the dataset we used. Thus we determined the
ancestral state using the chimpanzee genome alone.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/275

DNA level multiple alignment of orthologus coding
regions was performed using Dialign [45]. The phylogenetic tree of the mammalian genomes was constructed by
eliminating nodes that were not present in our study from
the tree provided by Cooper et al http://mendel.stan
ford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/gerp/index.html. From
the tree, the average neutral rate of substitution for the
mammalian genomes included in the analysis was taken
as 1.93 substitutions per base. Semphy [46] was used by
GERP to calculate the observed rate of divergence on a
base-by-base basis. The score for evolutionary divergence
was calculated as: GERP score = Observed- Expected Rate.
Around 15000 genes that had orthologs in 4 or more
mammalian genomes were subject to GERP analysis. A
GERP score could be calculated for 7414 SNPs (92%) in
our dataset. GERP score distribution of coding SNP and
non-SNP positions are shown in Additional File 2.
SNPs in other species could potentially complicate estimation of the GERP score. Unfortunately, high quality
genome-wide polymorphism data is not available for
non-human species. On the other hand, patterns of allele
frequencies in the HapMap populations show that very
few nonsynonymous SNPs have derived allele frequency
greater than ancestral allele frequency (see Additional File
1). Hence, in this work we follow an assumption that reference sequences for non-human species always contain
the major allele.

We were able to identify the ancestral allele identified for
~80% of the SNPs in our initial dataset (7896 SNPs).
Ancestral state prediction for ~30% of the SNPs in our
dataset was available at from the dbSNP repository ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/database/b124/mssql/data/
SNPAncestralAllele.bcp.gz and ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/
database/b124/mssql/data/Allele.bcp.gz (May'06). We
used ancestral allele information provided by dbSNP to
benchmark our approach. Agreement between dbSNP
and our predictions for the overlapping entries was ~89%.
While dbSNP assigns the ancestral state of SNPs from
information provided by depositors based on small and
large-scale studies, we used rigorous human-chimpanzee
coding region alignment, which is highly accurate but can
be applied to orthologus coding regions only. Correlation
of derived allele frequency for four HapMap populations
is shown in Additional File 1.

Divergence-DAF joint distribution
Polymorphic loci in our dataset had two statisticss, DAF
for the extent of recent evolution, and the GERP score for
the extent of long-term evolution. DAFs were binned into
three ranges: low (DAF: 0.05 – 0.33),intermediate (DAF:
0.33 – 0.67) and high (DAF: 0.67 – 0.95). GERP scores
were binned into conserved (GERP score < -1),intermediate
(GERP score: -1.0 – 1.0) and divergent (GERP score: >1.0).
Any SNP in the dataset was placed into the appropriate
bin of the 3 × 3 'divergence-DAF matrix' according to its
GERP score and DAF in a given HapMap population. As
an estimate for the background divergence pattern, all
coding (synonymous and nonsynonymous) bases were
placed in 3 × 1 'coding GERP matrix' which was binned as
conserved (GERP score < -1),intermediate (GERP score: -1.0
– 1.0) and divergent (GERP score: >1.0) (Figure 2B). Divergence-diversity matrices for synonymous and nonsynonymous SNP positions are shown in Additional File 3.

Long-term evolution across mammals
To study the nucleotide-level divergence profile of orthologus regions across mammals we used the GERP
(Genome Evolutionary Rate Profiling) method by Cooper
and colleagues [26] (Figure 2A). The GERP score at a baseposition quantifies the conservation of a base position
across the mammals considered.

We define the background distribution as the GERP-DAF
distribution calculated from all polymorphic nonsynonymous coding base-positions in the human genome and
compare the relative abundance of SNPs in different bins
of the matrix in a functional category of genes with the
background (see Figure 2C). The intensity of red colour
over yellow colour in the normalized GERP-DAF matrix

and coding GERP matrix for a functional category shows
the extent of over-representation in respective bins over
the genome-wide background. We ask whether the GERPDAF matrix of a functional category is different from that
of the background, and assess the statistical significance of
this using a chi-square test with 8 degrees of freedom. Any
functional category with chi square p-value < 0.05 without Bonferroni correction relative to the genome-wide distribution was considered significantly different. The
analyses were repeated using Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing. Most of the functional categories (>85%)
that were significant in at least three out of four populations were also significant (p-value < 0.05) in at least one
population after Bonferroni correction. The patterns were
broadly consistent for different choices of boundary of the
bins in the GERP-DAF matrices (data not shown).

homologus structure, the area in contact with DNA for the
residue corresponding to the allelic position was calculated using NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton 1993).

Clustering functional categories
In order to summarize our results, we decided to cluster
the significant functional categories. We computed two
sets of pair-wise Euclidean distances of the functional categories based on their extent of over-representation in the
bins of 3 × 1 coding GERP matrix (3 elements) and 3 × 3
divergence-DAF matrix (9 elements) respectively. Let the
distance matrix based on the 3 × 1 coding GERP matrix
and the 3 × 3 divergence-DAF matrix be D1 and D2
respectively. The final matrix, D, satisfies the following
boundary conditions: (i) The closeness (C) between pairs
of functional categories depends on D1 when other factors remain unchanged. (ii) Since the distances in D1 and
D2 are not directly comparable (non-metric) as they are in
different scales, D should not depend on the choice of
scale for D1 or D2 (iii) If two functional categories are
very similar in both their coding GERP matrix and divergence-DAF matrix (i.e. have small distances in D1 and
D2), they have a small distance in D. If, on the other hand,
a pair of functional categories is dissimilar both in coding
GERP matrix and GERP-DAF matrix, they will have a large
distance in D. We obtained a combined distance matrix,
D, by multiplying pair-wise distances between functional
categories in D1 and D2 and clustered the functional categories using unsupervised hierarchical complete linkage
clustering based on the matrix D. Although clustering
could be performed using several other methods, the clustering described above satisfied all boundary conditions
and the result was consistent with our biological understanding that similar functional categories were clustered
together.
