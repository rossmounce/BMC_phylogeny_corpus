Abstract
Background: The freshwater snail Indoplanorbis exustus is found across India, Southeast Asia, central Asia (Afghanistan),
Arabia and Africa. Indoplanorbis is of economic importance in that it is responsible for the transmission of several
species of the genus Schistosoma which infect cattle and cause reduced livestock productivity. The snail is also of
medical importance as a source of cercarial dermatitis among rural workers, particularly in India. In spite of its long
history and wide geographical range, it is thought that Indoplanorbis includes only a single species. The aims of the
present study were to date the radiation of Indoplanorbis across Asia so that the factors involved in its dispersal in the
region could be tested, to reveal potential historical biogeographical events shaping the phylogeny of the snail, and to
look for signs that I. exustus might be polyphyletic.
Results: The results indicated a radiation beginning in the late Miocene with a divergence of an ancestral bulinine
lineage into Assam and peninsular India clades. A Southeast Asian clade diverged from the peninsular India clade latePliocene; this clade then radiated at a much more rapid pace to colonize all of the sampled range of Indoplanorbis in
the mid-Pleistocene.
Conclusions: The phylogenetic depth of divergences between the Indian clades and Southeast Asian clades, together
with habitat and parasitological differences suggest that I. exustus may comprise more than one species. The timescale
estimated for the radiation suggests that the dispersal to Arabia and to Southeast Asia was facilitated by
palaeogeographical events and climate change, and did not require human involvement. Further samples from
Afghanistan, Africa and western India are required to refine the phylogeographical hypothesis and to include the
African Recent dispersal.
Background
The medical importance of Indoplanorbis

The freshwater snail Indoplanorbis exustus (Deshayes,
1834) (Planorbidae: Bulininae) is the sole member of its
genus and is widely distributed across the tropics as an
important intermediate host for several trematode parasites (Trematoda: Digenea). I. exustus is best known as
the intermediate host responsible for the transmision of
Schistosoma nasale Rao, 1933 and Schistosoma spindale
(Montgomery, 1906), as well as other trematodes such as
Echinostoma spp. and some spirorchids (Digenea:
Spirorchiidae)[1,2]. A third species of Schistosoma, Schistosoma indicum (Montgomery, 1906) is also transmitted

by I. exustus. Although other snails have been implicated
in transmission of these three Schistosoma spp. (e.g., Lymnaea luteola, S. indicum and S. nasale and Lymnaea
acuminata, S. nasale and S. spindale), I. exustus is the
most important host for S. nasale and S. spindale, as well
as for S. indicum in certain regions. Indeed I. exustus may
be the sole natural intermediate host for these three
Schistosoma species on the Indian sub-continent[3]. The
three Schistosoma species are parasites of Artiodactyla, in
particular of buffaloes, cows, goats pigs and sheep. Two
of the species cause intestinal schistosomiasis, whilst S.
nasale inhabits blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and
causes "snoring disease" in cattle[4]. Surveillance for cattle schistosomiasis is generally inadequate and the literature is limited, but some idea of the problem can be
gained from past small scale studies. Surveys in Sri Lanka
revealed a prevalence of S. spindale of 31.2% (of 901 cat-

tle)[5], whilst in Bangladesh a similarly high prevalence of
36% has been reported[6]. More recently, in Kerala South
India, prevalences have been reported of up to 57.3% in
cattle, 50% in buffalo and 4.7% in goats[3].
In addition to causing disease in cattle, I. exustus has
been implicated in outbeaks of cercarial dermatitis in
human populations in India[7,8], Laos[9], Malaysia[10]
and Thailand[11,12]. Cercarial dermatitis results from
the cutaneous allergic reaction in people exposed to larval schistosomes (cercariae) shed by infected snails into
freshwater bodies such as lakes, ponds, and paddy fields.
The cercariae cause pruritis and papular eruptions, with
often severe secondary infections, as they attempt to
infect a non-permissive definitive host and die in the
skin[13].
Indoplanorbis exustus (see Additional file 1) is a common snail across Southeast Asia and the Indian sub-continent, where it often acts as intermediate host for S.
spindale. The snail is also found in the Middle East
(Oman and Socotra) and Nigeria and the Ivory Coast;
these findings were attributed by Brandt[14] to recent
introductions by human activities (Brandt's view has
been frequently cited in the literature on Indoplanorbis[15-17]). In view of the wide geographical range of this
snail and its importance as a host for several species of
Schistosoma, there is a need to understand the phylogenetics and dispersal history of Indoplanorbis. In contrast
to Asia, the well documented appearance of the snail in
Africa (e.g., Nigeria[18] and Ivory Coast[19]) and more
recently (2002) in the Lesser Antilles[16], is almost certainly the result of introductions through human activities over the last 50-100 years.
Indoplanorbis exustus is a hermaphroditic invasive
snail species with high fecundity. Within one year of
introduction the snail is able to colonize habitats with
well established populations of other pulmonate and
prosobranch snails[16]. The snail requires a water temperature in excess of 15°C for maturation. At the optimum temperature of 30°C each snail can lay up to 800
eggs[20]. The capacity for self-fertilization and high
fecundity probably underlies the invasive potential of the
species. The snail is found in small ponds, pools and less
commonly in rice paddy fields. The snail may also occur
in semi-permanent pools formed in flooded areas of
fields, where it can survive the dry season buried in mud.
Consequently, dispersal may occur in clumps of mud
adhered to the bodies of cattle or across water in flotsam
(vegetation mats), and possibly also attached to migratory
birds (although this has not been observed for I. exustus).
In Northeast Thailand, where I. exustus is very common,
the annual rainfall is 1541 mm. In Assam, in the region
where the snails were sampled for this study, the annual
rainfall is much higher at around 4200 mm (data recorded
1982-2002)[21]. The current rainfall in Arabia is 340 mm

Page 2 of 18

per year; however, in Plio-Pleistocene humid periods this
has risen to 630 mm or more[22]. It has been recognized
that it is the length and severity of the dry season that
influences vegetation type (savanna, rain forest, monsoon
forest, etc) rather than the annual rainfall[23]. The rainfall in the dry season of Assam is approximately 250 mm,
whereas that in Northeast Thailand is only 30-40
mm[21]. These observations suggest that the Assam/Bangladesh populations are subject to different ecological
conditions than those of the Southeast Asian mainland
(SEAM); these observations support the need to question
the monophyly of Indoplanorbis. The invasive nature and
ecological tolerance of the snails adds to their importance
in veterinary and medical science.
The historical biogeography of Indoplanorbis

The Lymnaeae and Planorbidae appear to share a common ancestor in the Permian (c.a. 250 Ma (Mega annum
or million years ago)) fossil record[24]. Fossil Planorbinae
and Bulininae are known from the mid to upper Cretaceous of Africa and India[25]. The Tethys sea separated
Africa and Laurasia until 10-5 Ma[26]. Consequently,
Meier-Brook 1984[27] adopted an African (Gondwanan)
origin for Indoplanorbis with rafting to Asia since the
Cretaceous on the northward migrating Indian craton;
this author also considered a Europe to Southwest Asia
tract or an Africa to South India dispersal. Morgan et al.
2002 attributed the occurrence of Indoplanorbis in India
to colonization (from Africa) via the Middle East land
connection[28]. Similarly, Attwood et al. 2007 described a
Sinai-Levant dispersal tract, from Africa to central Asia,
for Schistosoma spindale during the early Pleistocene[29].
Clearly the two different dispersal mechanisms imply
very different chronologies; the Gondwanan vicariance
hypothesis implies that proto-Indoplanorbis has been
present in India since the late Eocene (35 Ma; India: Asia
collision[30]), whereas dispersal via the Sinai-Levant suggests a Plio-Pleistocene arrival.
The assumption that the Indoplanorbis lineage has
been represented on the Indian craton since the Cretaceous is difficult justify in palaeogeographic terms. There
would have been numerous opportunities for dispersal of
Gondwanan taxa off India and into Asia throughout the
Cenozoic. For example, during the middle Eocene (45
Ma) the northern corner of greater India came into contact with western Indonesia and subsequently with
Sumatra and Myanmar[30]. Even prior to the true (hard)
collison of India with Asia (i.e., between the Indian craton
and the Lhasa block at 35 Ma), faunal exchange was possible via volcanic arc terranes (some forming exposed plateaus) in the oceanic crust subducting at the collision
zone (c.a. 130 Ma onwards)[31]. Thus the absence of a
fossil record for Indoplanorbis or bulinine taxa from the
Southeast Asian Palaeocene or Eocene argues against a

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

Gonwanan-India rafting hypothesis for Indoplanorbis
and favors a post-Miocene Sinai-Levant dispersal tract to
India.
Earlier studies on I. exustus provide some DNA
sequence data (cox1[32,33], nuclear 18S rRNA
gene[32,33], mitochondrial (mt) 16S rRNA gene[32], and
nuclear 28S rRNA gene[28]); however, these studies considered only one population, and in most cases did not
report the location of the collecting site. In view of this,
no population phylogenetic study had been possible prior
to the present work. Collection site details were reported
for one data set[33], which was recorded as being sampled from Loei Province northern Thailand[34]; these
data were for the 18S gene and cox1, but did not include
the 16S gene and were geographically close to the sample
from Phitsanulok taken in the present study. Consequently, the Loei data were not added to the present analysis.
Aims of the study

The palaeogeographic, fossil and biogeographical dispersal data described above imply a Miocene origin for the
radiation of Indoplanorbis across Asia. Under such a
model, colonization of India could have been followed
almost immediately, by radiation across Southeast Asia
through land bridges created by low eustatic sea levels
during Pleistocene glacial excursions. The aim of this
study was therefore to collect DNA sequence data for
populations of the snails across the known range. These
data could then be used to address three main questions.
Firstly, the timescale for the dispersal and diversification
of these snails across Asia; the time of arrival of taxa in
various geographical regions is important because it
sheds light on how long different host:parasite assemblages have been in contact and facilitates studies on phylogenetic tracking or co-evolution. Secondly, the work
aimed to determine the historical events (climatic, tectonic or palaeogeogaphical) that may have influenced the
phylogeography of these taxa. Thirdly, the taxonomic status of Indoplanorbis was considered. It seems improbable
that only a single species of the genus has arisen if its
radiation dates from the Miocene.
In order to answer the above questions, a population
phylogeny for Indoplanorbis was first estimated and then
used to elucidate major dispersal tracts and confirm the
taxonomy of the genus (i.e., that only one species has
arisen). Molecular clock methods were then used to date
the radiation of these taxa so that the cladogenic events
and dispersal tracts inferred could be related to any major
historical environmental changes.

Results
Sequence data

Of the 15 taxa included in the analysis (see Table 1), 9 distinct haplotypes were found at the mitochondrial (mt)

Page 3 of 18

rrnL locus and 11 at the mt cox1 locus; there were 13 distinct haplotypes in the combined data set, with the taxa
from Laos, Luzon and Thailand (Phitsanulok) being
indistinguishable. The aligned cox1 data comprised 619
bps and the rrnL data 454 sites (396 bps without alignment gaps); the total aligned data set was therefore 1073
sites. The PTP-test indicated that the data showed significantly more structure than randomized data (P =
0.0002). The ILD-test was also significant, indicating that
the two data partitions (cox1 and rrnL) should be modeled separately (P = 0.0203). Tests for deviations from
neutrality were not significant: cox1 Fu * Li's D* -0.87029
(P > 0.10), F* -1.10963 (P > 0.10); rrnL D* -1.29227 (P >
0.10), F* -1.58492 (P > 0.10), all calculations were based
on total number of mutations. Tajima's D: cox1 -1.23388
(P > 0.10); rrnL -1.63067 (P > 0.05). The test of Xia et
al.[35] suggested that there were no significant levels of
substitution saturation at either locus (ISS < ISS.C, P <
0.0001, a lack of statistical significance here would imply
a poor phylogenetic signal).
Uncorrected p distances were obtained from PAUP*
and transformed to percentage sequence divergence estimates. The use of this simple (there was no correction for
transitional bias) distance measure was to afford comparison with other studies on inter and intraspecific variation among freshwater pond snails. The average
divergence among ingroup taxa was 3.123% (range from
0.095 to 8.385%). The largest divergence was observed
between the Bangladesh population and the other
ingroup populations (excluding Assam), average 7.871%
(range from 7.617 to 8.385%). This was followed by the
divergences between the Assam population and the other
ingroup populations (excluding Bangladesh), average
6.546% (range from 6.345 to 6.724%). In contrast, the
divergence between the Assam and Bangladesh populations was only 4.16%. The divergence between
Biomphalaria glabrata and Radix a. rubiginosa was
16.9%.
Phylogeny reconstruction
Maximum likelihood (ML) method

A phylogeny was estimated for all taxa (with unique haplotypes) using PAUP*. An LRT comparing the TIM + G
and TIM + ss models for the cox1 data indicated a significant difference between them (χ2 = 336.627 P < 0.0001,
d.f. = 2) favouring TIM + ss, consequently this model was
used for the cox1 partition. Here ss refers to the estimation of codon position specific rates. An LRT of the
molecular clock hypothesis failed to support the hypothesis that the different lineages had been evolving at the
same rate (-ln likelihood with a clock enforced 3218.4030,
without clock 3207.4237; χ2 = 21.96, P = 0.0247). Figure
1A shows the phylogeny estimated by direct ML for these
taxa. The most basal taxa are the northern India populations (Assam and Bangladesh), followed by South Indian

(Sri Lanka). From this "Indian" root, a SEAM clade arises;
this clade is not fully resolved and comprises a trichotomy formed by a Oman/Malaysia clade (Malay-Occidental, MO), a Sundaland (Sundaic) island clade (Indonesia
and Borneo) and a "ubiquitous" clade (including Laos,
both Thai populations, the Philippine population and
Nepal). Here we define Sundaland as the islands, which
rest on Asia's shallow continental shelf, namely the Malay
Peninsula and maritime Sundaic islands of Sumatra, Java,
Borneo, and the surrounding smaller islands. Aside from
the placing of 2 taxa (Malaysia and Sri Lanka), this phylogeny is consistent with the a priori hypothesis for a
radiation out of central Asia via India, and driven by
solely geophysical factors. The occurrence of Nepal in the
"ubiquitous" clade with Thai taxa was unexpected. We
doubt that this was an error, as the Nepal samples were
processed almost a year apart from the Thai and Philippine samples, also the sequences were not identical to any
other taxon in that clade (and no other taxon showed
intra-population variation).

Bayesian method with P4

Initial runs with a burnin of up to 2.3 million generations,
up to 12 million sampled generations, and with TrN+I,
F81, HKY, HKY + G and F81 models specified for codon
positions 1, 2 and 3, rrnL and gaps, respectively, indicated
a possible burnout problem (the likelihood reached a
peak, then fell and then plateaued) with failure to reach
true convergence. Burnout can be a sign that the Markov
chain has been distracted from the ML region by regions
of lower likelihood but higher posterior probability mass.
The result of this can be apparent exclusion of unbiased
tree lengths from the 99% credible interval, where this
interval becomes so wide that the chain is unlikely to
sample it evenly[36]. This problem is often caused by
issues related to model specification, such as the use of
overly complex models. To overcome problems with convergence and burnout the following changes were made.
The chain temperature was lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 (thus
making cold and heated chains more able to exchange
states, thus increasing acceptance rates of proposals); the
model was simplified by substitution of TrN (BIC

1050.244) for TrN + I (BIC 1057.008) (a move also possibly reducing Long-Tree (LT) error); and a user starting
tree was specified (again potentially reducing LT error).
The starting tree was based on the tree in file R1 (see
Additional file 2) but with all non-Indian taxa (and Nepal)
in one unresolved clade, branch lengths were otherwise
taken from the PAUP ML tree. The starting tree was
edited to have a non-bifurcating root.
After implementing the above moves apparent convergence was achieved with a burnin of 4 million generations. Posterior probabilities were then estimated over 10
million generations beyond the assumed point of stationarity. The final polytomy prior was set to 3.038 (varying
the prior from e to e2 had no significant effect on the phylogeny). The relative rates of the 3 codon positions were
0.253479, 0.283483 and 2.5462; the latter value was the
highest rate of any partition and corresponded to the
third codons, consequently there was no indication of LT
error. The resulting phylogeny (see Figure 1B) was identical to that of the ML method except that the ubiquitous
clade was resolved (Thai, (Luzon, Nepal)).
MrBayes

The final run conditions were: GTR, F81, HKY, HKY + G
and F81 (for the cox1 codons and the rrnL partition,
respectively); the chain temperature was 0.1; the covarion
model was applied to the first 4 partitions (invoking + I)
the BF comparing this move with the simpler model was
183.46 in favour of the covarion model; the ASPSD was
0.005028; the PSRF values ranged from 1.000 to 1.009
(mode 1.003); the burnin was 2.7 million generations,
with 10 million generations sampled post burnin; a random starting tree was used. GTR was used for the first
partition because of the limited range of models specifiable in MrBayes 3. The topology of the estimated phylogeny was identical to that of the ML method, with almost
identical relative branch lengths.
Parsimony method

POY4 was used to implement a parsimony method using
dynamic homology characters with direct optimization
(i.e., no a priori multiple sequence alignment was
required). In the initial sensitivity analyses the Navajo
Rug indicated that no partition was overly sensitive to
variations in weighting model over the range tested (see
Additional file 3), and that, whilst the cox1 data appeared
best for resolving more recent radiations, the rrnL data
appeared best for recovering the deeper phylogenetic
divisions. The maximum MRI values were obtained for
schemes with gap cost = 1 and did not decline with Tv
cost until costs exceeded 32. The maximum MRI for cox1
and rrnL was greater than that seen when the cox1 first
and second codon positions were partitioned separately
from the third positions (0.45 vs 0.41; see Additional file
4). As the Tv cost weighting schemes 2, 4, 16, and 32 were
equivalent in the MRI testing, the POY tree searches were

Page 6 of 18

repeated with gap cost = 1 and all 4 of the Tv weightings
in turn. The cox1 and rrnL loci were input as two separate
partitions. The Radix sequences were set as the outgroup.
A single most parsimonious tree was found. The resulting
cladogram was identical in topology to the phylogeny
estimated by the ML method. The same tree was chosen
either with or without the iterative pass search.
Clade posterior probabilities estimated using MrBayes
were all high; bootstrap support values from the direct
ML method were high (>70%) for all clades except for the
Malay-Occidental (MO) clade (53-67%), the SEAM-Sundaic clade (47%) and the Sri Lanka-SEAM-Sundaic clade
(61%). Posterior probabilities for clades recovered using
P4 were also high except for MO (50%) and Luzon/Nepal
(50%); this was with a polytomy prior set, with polytomies excluded (as in MrBayes) clade support increased
(all above 70%) (see Figure 1). Jackknife support on the
maximum parsimony tree showed a similar pattern to the
Mr Bayes tree.
Hypothesis testing
Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH-test) and topological method
(TM) tests

A constraint tree was first drawn to describe a plausible
hypothesis for the radiation of Indoplanorbis based only
on palaeogeographical and climatological events (see
Additional file 2). This tree assumes a central Asian origin for the genus, with colonization of India and then
SEAM and finally the Sundaic islands. The events used to
shape this tree were: 25 Ma Arabia-Africa separation
(Indoplanorbis diverges from other bulinines)[37]; 20 Ma
orginally Indian taxa enter Sundaland via extended Brahmaputra-Irrawaddy and become isolated there[38]; 3 Ma
taxa isolated on Borneo/Indonesia as these terrains separate from Malaysia[39]; <0.5 Ma SEAM taxa isolated at
end of Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT)[40]. The end of
the Arabian humid interval (3.5 - 1.2 Ma[37]) was used to
date the Oman radiation. The branch lengths of these
trees were then rescaled to within the range of those
found in the ML tree from the PAUP* analysis. The Nepal
taxon was moved from the Indian clade to the Sundaland
clade to follow the indications of the (unconstrained) ML
tree search.
The log likelihood for the geophysical hypothesis (tree)
was -3218.32 P = 0.358, indicating that it is an equally
likely explanation of the data as the unconstrained tree
(all other "best" trees were significantly worse). In TM
test (using the same hypothesis tree) the posterior probability of the geophysical hypothesis was 533/47779 trees,
i.e., P = 0.0112. These results suggested that the true phylogeography might not differ significantly from the a priori hypothesis, but that trees of exactly that topology
were not well represented in the posterior (i.e., the phylogeography indicated by the data is significantly different

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57

from that of the central Asia-Brahmaputra-SEAM
hypothesis).
Estimation of divergence times with BEAST

For these estimates all 15 taxa were included but gaps
were excluded (as missing data). Initial runs with a Yule
tree prior and an uncorrelated log-normal (relaxed) clock
model showed that the ucld.stdev was >1.0 and its confidence interval did not come close to zero (mean 2.84816
HPSD ranged from 1.80335 to 3.7994); this suggested that
the data were not sufficiently clock like for analyses using
a strict molecular clock. A 2 partition model (by locus)
with TIM + G and HKY + G was compared with a by
codon model (TrN, F81, HKY, HKY + G) the latter
appeared preferable (BF 87.88). Other moves, such as
TrN+I or HKY, HKY did not result in significant
improvement. Consequently, TrN, F81, HKY, HKY + G
was used in the main analyses. The prior on the mean
rate was a normal prior with mean equal to the average of
published rrnL (one rate) and cox1 (2 rates) clock rates for
freshwater snails and S.D. Set such that the 95% confidence interval spanned twice the range of these 3 values.
The 3 rates were as follows (in substitutions per site per
year × 10-8): 1.097 for rrnL, triculine snails (Gastropda:
Pomatiopsidae) over the early Pleistocene[41]; 1.83 for
early Pliocene Hydrobiidae[42]; and 1.62 also for Hydrobiidae[43]. These rates were estimated following the simple point estimation method of Edwards and Beerli[44],
but are useful as a prior in this study. The other initial
empirical prior was one on the height of the tree; this was
a 100 to 350 Ma uniform prior. A more informative normal prior of 200 Ma S.D. 30 Ma was also used, but there
was no marked difference on the estimation of mean rate
or other TMRCAs (Time to Most Recent Common
Ancestor). The informative prior was based on a Triassic/
Jurassic boundary date for the divergence of the Planorbidae and Lymnaeidae[24]. Runs were also performed using
an NPRS-transformation of the ML tree from PAUP as a
starting tree (scaled to a height of 250 Ma), but, as this
had little effect on run performance, the final runs used
random starting trees. Runs using only a prior on tree
height or on mean rate (but not both) gave implausible
results. Sampling from the prior only (with conditions
otherwise set to those of the final runs) also resulted in
implausible results and TMRCA estimates very different
from those obtained after observing the data. Each run
was repeated with 3 different starting random number
seeds the results of each run were compared and then
combined for parameter estimation from the posterior
distribution.
The final runs used a coalescent model, with the prior
assumption of constant population size (throughout the
genealogy), for the starting-tree prior and an uncorrelated log normal relaxed clock model. TMRCAs were
estimated for the most basal divergences first, with a

Page 7 of 18

prior on the TMRCA of the outgroup as described above.
The outgroup was then removed and the more recent
divergences were estimated with a prior on the TMRCA
of the Sri Lanka population and all of the SEAM-Sundaic
populations (this was the split subsequent to the outgroup); this prior was the estimated value from the first
runs (with all 15 taxa). The outgroup was removed
because its inclusion results in undesirable time depth of
the phylogeny; this led to underestimation of the overall
mean rate and inflated time estimates for the more recent
divergences among the ingroup. The McMC was 10 million generations each run (3 runs were combined), with a
burnin of 10%. All ESS values were >500. The posterior
distributions were examined using Tracer[45] and no distribution was seen to be cut off by its prior or show signs
of failure to converge (rising likelihood). The estimated
TMRCA values are given in Table 2. TMRCA estimates
for an exponential distribution clock model were also
examined to ensure they agreed with those in Table 2;
this was because BF comparisons of the two models indicated they were equally fitting (BF 0.16 in favour of the
log normal model. It was found that simpler tree priors
(Yule and Birth-Death models) gave implausible TMRCAs, with coalescent priors performing better. The wide
range of the HPDs in for the divergence time estimates in
Table 2 reflects the uncertainty inherent in all molecular
date estimates; this is not unusual and is a realistic feature
of this method of analysis.

Discussion
Phylogenetics

The topological-method hypothesis test rejected the a
priori (central Asia-Brahmaputra-SEAM) model; this
suggested that the phylogeography of these snails differed
significantly from the history of other snails such as the
Triculinae[46], which are also found in India and the
SEAM. The phylogenies estimated for Indoplanorbis
exustus offer strong and concerted support for an origin
of the South and Southeast Asian radiation in Northern
India; the Assamese and Bangladeshi populations form a
robust basal clade. The cratonic Indian (or at least South
Indian/Sri Lankan) populations radiated later. Sri Lanka
was intermittently linked to mainland India by extensive
land bridges until about 165 Ka[47], consequently the Sri
Lankan population is considered as phylogeographically
South Indian. The most recent radiation could only be
partially resolved by the present data, resulting in a trichotomy of Malay-Occidental (MO), Sundaic and ubiquitous clades. The ubiquitous clade had representatives on
Thailand and Laos (SEAM), Luzon (Philippines) and
Nepal (Himalayan frontal ranges). The colonization of
Arabia (and probably also Africa) appears to be most
recent and this agrees with earlier assumptions based on
biogeography only[17,18,48]. The suggestion of an Indian

origin also agrees with earlier biogeographical hypotheses[48]. The derivation of the Luzon/Nepal clade from
the SEAM element of the ubiquitous clade was less well
supported; this clade was only supported by the P4 analysis; however, it is reasonable to accept that the extralimital taxa originated on the SEAM.
The relative depths of divergences in the phylogeny
suggest that Indoplanorbis comprises a single species,
save for possibly the northern India lineage, which forms
a cohesive basal clade. If the Assam/Bangladesh taxon is a
distinct species this may explain the apparent stasis in the
northern Indian radiation for a relatively long period, followed by a more recent and sudden radiation of Indoplanorbis outside India. Also worthy of note in this
context is the observation that infection prevalences in
natural populations (with Schistosoma spindale) were
always >8% in samples (of over 200) of snails collected in
Thailand and Laos (this study), but are reportedly much
lower in Indoplanorbis sampled in Assam (2.2% [8]) and
prevalences of under 1% seem typical in India[4]. In addition, the Assam/Bangladesh taxa exist in a region of current (and historically) higher rainfall than other parts of

India (except for the Ghats) and Southeast Asia where the
samples were taken (see Background, first section).
Although the concept of critical levels of sequence divergence (genetic distances) that can be used to delimit species boundaries is generally inappropriate, such data can
be used to differentiate species in combination with other
kinds of observations. Typical interspecific divergences of
1.9-6.9% have been reported for Biomphalaria[49] (for
the mt 16S and nuclear ITS loci) and, as these snails have
similar ecologies to I. exustus, these values could be used
as indicators in the present study. Genetic distances for
the related snail Bulinus have been reported for the cox1
locus. The mean distance within B. forskalii from different countries was 4.2% and for B. senegalensis 1.7%. The
divergence between two closely related Bulinus species,
B. camerunensis and B. forskalii, was 3.96%[50]. In view
of these reports, and considering the differences between
those and the present study, a divergence greater than
6.5% might be considered suggestive of polyphyly in the
present data. In the present study only the Assam and
Bangladesh taxa showed such high divergences from
other ingroup taxa. Such observations, taken together,

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

may be sufficient to warrant a detailed morphological
comparison of the Assamese (and cratonic India) and
SEAM taxa in order to confirm their conspecific status.
In the present work morphological study was restricted
to only that sufficient to be sure that the snails collected
were no other known species aside from I. exustus.
The occurrence of the Nepal sample in the SEAM
clade, and Sri Lanka in the SEAM-Sundaic clade is similar
to other disjunct distributions reported for a variety of
early Pleistocene organisms, where certain Indian taxa
show greater affinity with Southeast Asian taxa than with
neighboring Indian forms. The Asian langurs[51], certain
bird species[52] and Macaca spp.[53] show such disjunct
distributions. The phylogeny of the snail Paracrostoma
Cossmann, 1900 (Caenogastropoda: Pachychilidae) and
other pachychilids shows a similar disjunction between
Indian and the SEAM[54]. Although these authors
advanced a slightly different phylogeographical hypothesis for this taxon, Paracrostoma showed similar disjunct
India-Southeast Asia affinities in their study as observed
for I. exustus in the present study . These disjunct distributions are proposed to have arisen following Plio-Pleistocene (5.1-1.6 Ma) aridification of southern India with a
shift in the predominant vegetation cover type from tropical forest to Savannah, with "wet-zone" species becoming
confined to and migrating along refugia of tropical forest
in the Western and Eastern Ghats and Sri Lanka[52] (Figure 2). Wet-zone is defined as regions with annual precipitation of >250 cm and dry-zone as areas with 50-100 cm
or less, the SEAM is wet-zone. This "dry-zone refugia"
hypothesis would allow migration of (wet-zone) taxa
from Southeast Asia, via Myanmar and into Sri Lanka
and mainland India. Such migration would be facilitated
by Quaternary glacial eustasy, as lowered sea levels
exposed continental shelf areas providing terranes of low
relief and suitable dispersal corridors. For snails radiating
in the early Pleistocene such a disjunct distribution would
be correlated with fluctuations in sea level during glaciations around MIS22 (Marine Isotope Stage 22)[55].
Molecular dating

The results of molecular dating using the present data
and a Bayesian approach with a relaxed clock model are
given in Table 2. The mean substitution rate of 1.37 × 10-8
substitutions/site/million years agrees well with published estimates for freshwater snails at these loci[43].
The divergence of the ingroup is dated at around 7 Ma.
This date corresponds with accelerated Himalayan uplift
(at 8 Ma) and the associated establishment of a monsoon
climate in Asia[56]. Consquently a major climatic change
occurred in northern India at this time, with the appearance and dominance of C4 plants in the flora and associated deforestation[57]. Indoplanorbis requires humid
tropical environments and Indian populations could have

Page 9 of 18

been fragmented into refugia at this time. Assam is
regarded as a distinct from the drier Sikkim Himalaya
(which includes Nepal)[58]. In view of this it is plausible
that the initiation of a monsoon dominated climate triggered the divergence of the Assam/Bangladesh (Table 2,
North India) and the cratonic Indian and SEAM-Sundaland clades at 7 Ma. The dating suggests that proto-Indoplanorbis remained unchanged on the Indian craton for
almost 100 Ma; thus the divergence at 7 Ma may have
been a result of some adaptation to more arid conditions,
such as the appearance of a new ecological race (if not
species) adapted to drier conditions. As mentioned
above, the Assam region, and the part of Bangladesh
where the samples were taken, has a year round more
humid climate than the areas of SEAM that experience an
annual dry season. The divergence of the Assam and Bangladesh populations after 2.84 Ma could be attributed to
mid-Pleistocene changes in river courses associated with
rapid uplift of the frontal range of the Himalaya[59] and
uplift of the Silong Plateau and parts of the Meghalaya
Plateau and Khasi hills which separate these regions
today[60].
The next major divergence event is the divergence of
the cratonic India clade (Sri Lanka) from the Sundaland
clades; this is dated at around 2.5 Ma. It is known that significant Asian monsoon intensification occurred prior to
the major glaciation at around 2.7 Ma; this triggered an
extremely arid 1.4 Ma interval[61]. This dry period is
likely to have forced Southern Indian and SEAM populations further into dry-zone refugia, thereby promoting
additional divergence. The end of the arid period may
then have led to the explosive radiation of the SEAM and
Sundaic taxa at 960 Ka. Note that by 900 Ka sea levels
were again quite high[62] and this would prevent back
migration after range expansion (thus further facilitating
divergence). The next dated event is the divergence of the
MO clade at 450 Ka, with the Arabian populations
diverging from a Sundaic (Malaysian) ancestral form.
This interval (PL4) is associated with very low sea levels[63], milder interglacials (with more extensive wetlands) after 430 Ka, and maximum vegetation cover in
Arabia around 500 Ka (MIS13)[64]. These events could
facilitate migration of Sundaic taxa, from the western rim
of the Sunda shelf (Sumatra), across exposed regions of
the Indian Ocean, then around the exposed Indus fan and
into Arabia or Africa (Figure 2). A Makran coast tract,
however, raises the question as to why the Sundaic lineage did not establish in southern India or Pakistan/Iran,
as it would have passed through these regions. The
absence from southern India may be explained by ecological adaptation of the Sundaic form to SEAM habitats.
The fact that the migration would have been across low
lying wetland regions that were later below sea level may
explain the absence from Pakistan/Iran. When these ter-

Figure 2 Semi-schematic summarizing a phylogeography for Indoplanorbis. The radiation is assumed to have originated in the Assam region of

ranes were next exposed winter conditions were much
colder than prior to the Mid-Pleistocene-Transition
(MPT)[64]. In addition, after 500 Ka sea levels were never
as low for such sustained intervals[65]. The MO clade is
then dated as further diverging at 180 Ka into two clades
in Oman, which were represented by two populations in
different wadi systems, separated by 30 km of extremely
arid mountains. The date 180 Ka coincides with the end
of the longest Pleistocene humid period in southern Arabia (200-180 Ka)[66]. It is possible that the return to
much drier conditions and contraction of vegetation
cover blocked further immigration of snails to the region
and thereby isolated the coastal (Wadi Qab) population
from the more interior (Wadi Bani Khaled) population.
Humid periods also appear to have occurred at 160-130
Ka, 82-78 Ka and [67]10-6 Ka[68], but these were a series
of shorter lived wet periods. The mountains between the
two Oman populations suggest that the two sites were
colonized via different tracts, that probably originated
from the same source in Makran Iran (across the exposed
Oman and Persian gulfs), one passing inland and one
coastal.

The most recent radiations appear to be the Sundaic
additions to the range; these being almost isochronous at
around 165 Ka. This interval corresponds to the MIS6
glacial at 195-130 Ka during which sea levels reached
minima of around 120 m below present levels (c.a. 140
Ka)[65]. At such times of eustatic minima the Sunda shelf
between the SEAM and Java and Borneo was exposed
(see Figure 2) and island arcs (volcanic) provided land
bridges towards the Philippines, such that rafting and
transport by birds could bridge the shorter stretches of
sea separating these islands. The presence of the Nepal
taxon in the SEAM clade rather than the Indian clade
could be explained by glaciation, and or hyper-aridity
eliminating snail populations in Nepal. There is some evidence for late Pleistocene glaciation in southern Nepal,
but the Brahmaputra valley and areas South of the Nepal:
Assam border appear to have remained unglaciated[69].
There is also evidence for a hyper-arid climate in West
India 18-13 Ka, but Assam appears to have provided a
more humid refugium[70]. If snail populations became
extinct in Nepal they could have been replenished by colonization from the SEAM by populations which were not

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

sampled in the present study (e.g., from Myanmar). As
mentioned above the SEAM lineage contains the most
widely dispersed taxa and this suggest some adaptation in
this clade which makes it more invasive and possibly able
to out compete Indian clade taxa.

Conclusions
The findings of the study suggest an Indian origin for the
Indoplanorbis radiation at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. The radiation appears to have been triggered by the
switch of the Asian climate from a planetary to a monsoonal climate. The antecedent taxa were probably
adapted to life in humid and partially forested tropical to
sub-tropical environments, and now appear restricted to
refugia in Assam and Bangladesh. Further intensification
of the Asian monsoon at 2.5 Ma appears to have triggered
divergence of a peninsular Indian taxon; this taxon may
have been better adapted to the savanna habitats that
replaced rain forest as the dominant vegetation type in
cratonic India at that time. Indoplanorbis then appears to
have entered the Southeast Asian Mainland (SEAM) by 1
Ma. The end of a very arid period then triggered divergence of the snail on the SEAM at 960 Ka, but the SEAM
lineage may already have acquired additional adaptations
to aridity which allowed it to colonize new areas more
effectively and to live in regions with pronounced dry and
wet seasons more readily than the original Indian taxa.
The SEAM lineage first colonized Arabia (possibly via
Sumatra, island chains and the exposed Indus fan and
Oman gulf during periods of low sea level) at around 500
Ka and then the Sundaic islands. Severe tradewinds in
MIS6 could have facilitated this westward migration[71].
It is possible that there have been multiple colonization
events, out of the SEAM, over the Pleistocene glacial
cycles, with replacement of ancestral forms by ever better
adapted (to dry conditions) forms; such loss of ancestral
polymorphism could make the colonization of Arabia
from the SEAM appear to predate that of the Sundaic
islands, when the Sundaic islands may have been colonized first. The phylogeography hypothesized here is not
proposed as a definitive explanation, but only to demonstrate that the major relationships, tracts of dispersal and
timescale are plausible. No doubt alternative palaeogeographical and climatic events could be put forward to
explain the same phylogeny.
The low eustatic sea levels of the Würm glacial maximum allowed human migration from central Asia, across
northern India and into Myanmar and the SEAM via
Assam (130-70 ka). Inter pluvial low sea levels could have
permitted colonization of Indonesia and Borneo, even as
far south as Australia[72]. Recent studies on the evolution
of human mtDNA haplogroups suggests that Sundaland
was colonized by humans (possibly from northeast
SEAM) over 50 Ka[73]. Humans did not develop a signifi-

Page 11 of 18

cant maritime technology until 60 Ka[74]; this would
have made the colonization of the Philippines possible.
Although such human migrations are recorded for the
middle palaeolithic, the domestication of livestock, and
their subsequent trade, did not begin until around 10
Ka[75]. Consequently, an anthropogenic radiation of
Indoplanorbis would be expected to accelerate and diversify mostly in the last 10 Ka and a human-mediated dispersal would be expected to show a phylogeny with less
phylogenetic depth than one driven by geophysical
events.
The timescale of the radiation, which is estimated to be
Pliocene to late Pleistocene, entirely predates the radiation of the genus Homo in Asia and the human maritime
culture. Consequently, the results of this study support
geophysical and climatic forces, rather than human activity, as drivers of the dispersal of Indoplanorbis across Asia
and its arrival in Arabia. In contrast, the results could not
distinguish an Indian rafting hypothesis from an Africa to
India migration via central Asia (because the phylogeny
shows a complex migration out of India, rather than an
informative tract such as Assam-SEAM-Sri Lanka). Interestingly, the radiation of Indoplanorbis does not appear to
track that of Schistosoma spindale, which has been dated
at 0.25 Ma for the divergence of Bangladesh, Thai and Sri
Lankan populations[29] this suggests that the host-parasite association here is not tightly co-evolved. As indicated by the phylogeny, Indoplanorbis exustus appears to
comprise two or three ecological races or ecotypes. These
races show different habitat requirements (the SEAM lineage appears to have a wider ecological tolerance) and
some parasitological differences (the SEAM lineage
shows higher prevalences with S. spindale). The high levels of sequence divergence between the Northeast India
populations and the other ingroup taxa also suggest that
these taxa may be a different species from I. exusutus.
Consequently, there is a case for a detailed morphological
study to confirm that Indoplanorbis is truly monospecific. This is in addition to the need for additional sampling of Indoplanorbis from Afghanistan, Myanmar and
western India - to distinguish an Indian rafting hypothesis from a central Asian tract from Africa, to test theories
on the origin of the Nepal population, and to confirm that
the inclusion of only a Sri Lankan population correctly
represents the cratonic Indian lineage. Under the proposed phylogeography it is conceivable that southern
peninsular India could have been colonized by snails with
SEAM clade adaptations distinct from that of the wetter
more forested Sri Lanka.

Methods
Sampling

Samples were taken in 10 countries so as to cover most of
the range of Indoplanorbis exustus (see Table 1 for details

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

of taxa and sampling). No samples were taken in Africa,
as these populations were assumed to be represented by
the samples from Arabia. Identification of taxa followed
published accounts[17]. Whole snails were fixed in 10%
ethanol directly in the field. A small subsample of each
population was taken in 1% neutral formalin to aid identification. DNA was extracted from individual snails by a
standard method[76]. Sequence variation was assessed at
two loci, being partial sequences of the mitochondrial
(mt) cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) and the mt
large ribosomal-RNA gene (rrnL or 16S). Sequences of
the oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR for the
amplification of these loci are published elsewhere, for
the cox1 amplifications the primers HCO-2198 and LCO1490 were used[77]. For the rrnL locus the primers of
Palumbi et al. (1991) were used[78]. 2 to 8 snails were
sequenced for each locus/population (mode 4 rrnL and 2
cox1). Mitochondrial loci were chosen because with their
maternal pattern of inheritance and therefore smaller
effective population size, these loci may be expected to
evolve more rapidly and be better suited to estimation of
intraspecific phylogenies and more recent (i.e., post-Miocene radiations). In addition, these loci have proven useful in such studies of gastropods and molecular clock rate
data are available[24,42,43,46,79,80]. Total genomic DNA
was used as a template for PCR amplification on a Progene thermal cycler (MWG) employing standard PCR
conditions[81]. Unincorporated primers and nucleotides
were removed from PCR products using the QIAQuick
PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). Sequences were determined bidirectionally, directly from the products by thermal- cycle-sequencing using Big Dye fluorescent dye
terminators and an ABI 377 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer), following procedures recommended by the
manufacturers. Sequences were assembled and aligned
using Sequencher (version 3.1 Gene Codes Corp. Ann
Arbor, Michigan). DNA sequences for both strands were
aligned and compared to verify accuracy. Controls without DNA template were included in all PCR runs to
exclude any cross-over contamination.
A multiple sequence alignment was generated for all
taxa for each locus and the cox1 and rrnL sequences were
then concatenated to form a combined data set. No
intrapopulation variation was found. Corresponding
sequences were obtained for Radix auricularia rubiginosa (Michelin, 1831) (Lymnaeoidea: Lymnaeidae) in this
laboratory, as outgroup sequences. Additional outgroup
data were obtained for Biomphalaria glabrata (Say, 1818)
(Planorbidae: Planorbinae) from the GenBank [GenBank:NC_005439][82].

on the ingroup. Although often criticised for being too
liberal[85], the PTP-test is useful as a first step in phylogenetic analysis[86], as rejection of the null hypothesis
here suggests that the real data may be better than randomly permuted (phylogenetically uninformative) data.
In addition Tajima's test for neutrality (based on the total
number of mutations) was performed using DNAsp (v.
5.10.01)[87]. The data were tested for substitution saturation using plots of the numbers of transitions (Ts) and
transversions (Tv) against the maximum likelihood (ML)
genetic distance[88]. The indications of these plots were
further evaluated using the entropy-based test[35] as
found in the DAMBE (v. 4.5.20) software package[89],
which provides a statistical test for saturation. Aside from
the parsimony analyses, gaps were coded as a binary
matrix, and all characters were run unordered and
equally weighted. Indels for the sequence alignment
appeared to be homologous (they were short and of equal
length in all taxa) and alignment errors were unlikely (the
sequences aligned readily in Sequencer under stringent
parameters). In addition, recurrent mutation is less likely
to significantly affect the analysis of intraspecific phylogenies and there was no reliably tested approach for choosing a particular model. Consequently, gaps were coded
simply in a binary, presence/absence, manner rather than
using SIC or other more complex coding methods[90].
Choice of substitution model and data partitioning scheme

The incongruence length-difference (ILD) test[91] as
implemented in PAUP* (v. 4.0b10; [92]), was used to test
for homogeneity between the cox1 and rrnL data partitions; the test was applied to informative sites only[93]. A
suitable substitution model was selected for each data
partition using an hierarchical test of alternative models
as implemented in Modeltest (v. 3.7)[94] and MrModeltest (v. 2.3.)[95]. The two applications use different sets of
hierarchies for the comparison of models[96], thus the
additional use of MrModeltest not only provided models
which could be implemeted in MrBayes, but also could
highlight cases where Modeltest might fail to select a
class of models due to the hierarchy of comparisons.
Models were selected first by BIC, then by second order
AIC, then (in the case of apparent equivalence of two
models) by the number of free parameters (although AIC
may also penalize extraneous parameters). There was no
disagreement between Modeltest and MrModeltest in
cases where a model considered by both applications was
chosen by Modeltest. Molecular evolution of indels was
modeled by an F81 model. For the calculation of the BIC,
the sample size was set as the number of characters in the
alignment.

Preparation of data

replicates (each of 100 random additions), was performed

hypothesis to changes in method and associated assumptions. The rationale was that any clade that was represented in phylogenies found by all methods (and well
supported) would be a reliable reconstruction of phylogenetic history for these taxa. The use of a direct ML
method and Bayesian methods also allowed comparison
of estimated branch lengths, as Bayesian methods (as
implemented in MrBayes) have been known to erroneously converge on LT solutions in cases where partitioned
data are described by complex models with many parameters close to nonidentifiability[36,97]. The ILD test comparing the cox1 and rrnL loci was significant (P = 0.02), so
the two partitions were modeled separately. The starting
models indicated for the ML analyses were as follows:
All sites: TIM + G
cox1 first codon positions: TrN + I
cox1 second codon positions: F81
cox1 third codon positions: HKY
rrnL: HKY + G
Indels: F81
The F81 model for gaps was not chosen by goodness of
fit tests, but it is the only appropriate model suitable for
indels. Also, it is a monotone model fitting the similarly
monotone substitution of a binary character evolving
along a phylogeny[98]).
The following details the methods particular to each
phylogenetic method. Analyses were time consuming and
performed on several multiprocessor machines (4 × 2.44
GHz PCs), with output files pooled from multiple simultaneous runs where appropriate.
ML with heuristic search

Heuristic searches were performed (under the respective
model and starting parameters indicated by Modeltest)
using PAUP* initially with 1000 replicates, random addition of sequences (10 replicates) and tree-bisectionreconnection branch-swapping (TBR) options in effect.
The TIM+G model was used, gaps were treated as missing data. The outgroup was forced to be monophyletic.
The initial search rapidly converged on a single tree
which was hit 100% of the time. Consequently, the search
was repeated with nchuck = 10 and chuckscore = 3210 in
an attempt to improve exploration of parameter space
and find trees of better score. This was repeated with the
monophyly constraint both on and off. A final search of
5000 replicates was then performed to increase the
chance that the ML tree had been found. A likelihood
ratio test for a strict molecular clock hypothesis was also
made possible by repeating the final run with a clock constraint. Nodal support was assessed by bootstrap with
5000 replicates.
Bayesian method (BM) with McMC applied by P4

Bayesian phylogenetic methods are becoming increasingly popular in molecular systematics with the belief
that they are not only faster in terms of computing time

Page 13 of 18

(for analyses with an equivalent level of confidence) but
are also statistically superior to a solely ML method[99].
For example, such methods do not assume approximate
normality or large sample sizes as would general ML
methods[100]. BMs differ from direct ML methods in
that the former consider the posterior probability of the
model (with parameters) and tree after observing the
data. The posterior probability of a hypothesis is proportional to the product of its prior probability and the probability of observing the dataset given the hypothesis (i.e.,
the likelihood of the hypothesis). Consequently, unlike
direct ML, a BM allows incorporation of prior information about the phylogenetic process into the analysis. P4
(v. 0.87) was used as the primary method to apply the BM;
this employs the same method as MrBayes[101] but
allows consideration of unresolved trees (i.e. polytomies)
and can implement all commonly used substitution models as well as any custom model the user might need to
specify[102].
The priors specified for the BM generally followed the
default values found in MrBayes; a flat Dirichlet distribution was set as the prior for the state frequency and for
the rate set priors (e.g., revmat, tratio), an exponential
prior was set on the branch lengths. A polytomy proposal
was set as either zero (i.e., no favouring of multifurcations) or as e, e1.11 e2 to examine the effect this has on the
posterior probabilities of the clades found; this implements a move (proposed by Lewis et al., 2005) to counter
the problem of the spuriously high posterior clade probabilities returned by MrBayes relative to corresponding
ML analyses[103]. Model parameters and relative rates
were set to be freely variable and unlinked; there were
four discrete rate categories for the Г-distribution. Outgroup monophyly was enforced. The McMC was tuned to
give proposal acceptance rates between 10 and 70% for
each data partition.
Four simultaneous Markov chains were run (one cold,
three heated) and trees were sampled every 10 generations, two such runs were performed simultaneously.
Convergence of the McMC was assessed by plotting split
support (at the Indonesia/Borneo node) for consensus
trees over different generation time windows; the generation of convergence was considered to be that at which
the support reached a plateau. In addition, a plot of the
cumulative split frequencies from two simultaneous runs
(which should cluster along the line y = x when both runs
are converging on the same region of parameter space)
was also used to determine the point of stationarity (see
literature for details of rationale[104]). Generations prior
to the inferred point of convergence (i.e., prior to stationarity) were discarded as a burnin.
Bayesian method with McMC applied using MrBayes

To afford comparison with more standard analyses and to
confirm the findings with P4, the BM was reapplied using

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

the popular package MrBayes (v. 3.1.2). Run conditions
followed those of the P4 analyses, where possible. Unlike
P4, the polytomy proposal for MrBayes is effectively fixed
at zero and model specification was more limited than in
P4. In order to help assess if runs had converged the average standard deviation of the split frequencies (ASDSF)
was used to gauge the similarity of trees sampled by 2
independent runs and the Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF) was used to compare the final mean parameter
estimates (for the 2 runs), including the posterior probabilities of nodes[105,101]. The McMC was considered
complete if this ASDSF was <0.01 otherwise the run (and
burnin) was lengthened until the ASDSF was adequate.
PSRF values close to 1.000 were also considered as indicating that convergence might have been achieved.
As noted above, it is possible for MrBayes (and P4) to
converge on an incorrect LT solution where partitioned
data are used with complex models. This can occur
because the default starting tree used by MrBayes often
has relatively long branch lengths for most data sets (this
can draw the chain towards long-trees in the early stages
of the run, such that convergence on the correct solution
is never achieved). This problem may not be detected by
either the ASDSF or PSRF[36]. To reduce the risk of this
source of systematic error the following precautions were
taken. Branch lengths of the final trees were compared
with and without a user specified starting tree (the ML
tree from PAUP was used for this). The relative rates for
the partitions were examined because as the chain is
drawn to LT solutions the relative rate of the partition
with fewest variable sites is often inflated (and alpha falls
to accommodate this). In the present study the expectation was that third codon positions should have the highest rates and rrnL among the lowest - deviations from this
would be considered symptomatic of an LT error.
Although the mean branch length prior in MrBayes was
left at the default 0.1, that in P4 was lowered to 0.001 and
the branch lengths of the final trees compared (following
published suggestions[106]). There was an exponential
prior on the branch lengths in MrBayes. In P4 Pinvar was
also removed from the model for Cox1 first codon positions; this move was to reduce or detect any parameter
correlation affecting convergence[107].
Parsimony method using POY

To provide an analysis free of the assumptions underlying
ML methods, and any effects particular to the alignment
inferred by Sequencher, the topology for the phylogeny of
the snail populations was also estimated using a maximum parsimony approach implemented by POY (v.
4.1.1). POY was used to effect a direct optimization criterion, which performs simultaneous tree searching and
sequence alignment. Direct optimization finds a set of
parsimonious homologies for a set of sequences of different length by treating the full homologous nucleotide

Page 14 of 18

string as a character and each sequence as a state (i.e., the
data are treated as dynamic homology characters)[108].
The data are partitioned in the sense that the homologies
are not moved between them, but are combined during
optimization in that each has the potential to influence
the "alignment" of any other partition (strictly alignment
is not performed, only implied). The data partitioning
scheme and Tv/Ts weighting scheme and gap cost were
determined by a MRI[109] and "Navajo rug" approach (a
graphic plot where the parameter space is represented as
a grid)[110]. The MRI provides only a rough measure of
congruence among data partitions; however, the
approach has performed adequately in empirical
tests[111]. The Tv:Ts weightings considered were 1, 2, 4,
8, 16 and 32, and the gap costs similarly ranged from 1 to
64 (a total of 42 weight matrices). The gap opening cost
was set to one. One Navajo rug was produced for each
data partition (cox1, cox1 first and second codon positions, cox1 third codon positions, rrnL and cox1 + rrnL)
and weighting scheme was plotted against clade, with
each clade sored as monophyletic, paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Clades were taken from the ML tree found in
the PAUP analyses as well as additional clades found on
trees in the most frequent 5% of trees from the posterior
distribution in MrBayes. The Navajo rugs were used to
detect any unusual sensitivity of a particular data partition to changes in character weighting. The MRI was
used to guide the choice of data partitioning strategy and
weighting scheme.
The search strategy was as follows. Initially 250 random-addition (Wagner) trees were built. Alternate subtree pruning and TBR rounds of branch-swapping were
then performed on all 250 trees until a local optimum
was achieved (using default options in POY 4). In addition to the most optimal trees, all the suboptimal trees
found within 5% of the best cost were also considered.
Then all but the best 100 of all optimal and topologically
unique trees were excluded from the analysis. The
remaining trees were then subjected to 15 rounds of
ratcheting, where 20% of the characters were re-weighted
by a factor of 2. During ratcheting, the dynamic homology characters were transformed into static homology
characters, so that the fraction of nucleotides (rather than
of sequence fragments) could be re-weighted. 200 swappings of subtrees identical in terminal composition but
different in topology, were then performed between pairs
of best trees from the ratcheting step . These two steps
were intended to increase the efficiency of the search of
tree space. Each resulting tree was then refined further by
local branch swapping under the default parameters in
POY for swapping . The optimal and topologically unique
trees were then reported. The resulting tree was then
used as a start point for 2 rounds of optimization using
iterative pass; this constitutes an extremely effective

Liu et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:57
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/57

means of determining parsimonious cladogram
costs[112]. Clade support was estimated by jackknifing of
static transformed characters (5000 replicates, 50% of
characters deleted).
Hypothesis testing
Topological method

The posterior probability of a particular phylogeographical hypothesis was tested by determining the proportion
of trees with this topology in the posterior probability
distribution output from a tree search using P4. This was
done by writing a constraint tree describing the hypothesis of interest and reading this into PAUP*.
SH-test [113]

Again a constraint tree describing the hypothesis of interest was written and used in the SH-test as implemented
in PAUP* with full optimization, branch lengths used in
likelihood calculation, and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The
test compares between and among topologies from constrained and unconstrained searches; the set of "best"
trees (from the 5% confidence interval of unique trees
sampled from the posterior of the P4 search) and the ML
tree (unconstrained) were used as the set of trees for this
comparison.
Relaxed molecular clock methods (BEAST)

The program BEAST (v. 1.5.3)[114,115] was used to estimate the molecular clock rates and divergence dates
(TMRCA of clades). BEAST implements a Bayesian
method for the simultaneous estimation of divergence
times, tree topology and clock rates; this method is currently considered superior to other approaches (e.g., nonparametric methods such as NPRS[116] or penalized
likelihood methods[117], particularly for phylogenies
with a low time depth, because it can allow for uncertainty in dates assigned to calibration points and does not
require untested assumptions about the pattern of clock
rate variation among lineages[118]. The greatest benefit
of using a Bayesian method for dating is that the specification of prior distributions can be used to ensure that
the analysis realistically incorporates the uncertainty
associated with the calibration points used[119]. The
procedure involves the user specifying both a phylogenetic model (a model of population history; the tree
prior) and a clock model (of substitution rate variation);
however, the likelihood calculation is based on the clock
model only. In addition, as in any BM, one must specify a
substitution model for each data partition. Rate variation
between adjacent branches is assumed to be uncorrelated, as these rates did not show autocorrelation in
recent studies[120]. BEAST can implement several combinations of tree and clock models; the present study

Page 15 of 18

used the following criteria to compare and choose tree
prior and clock models.
Beginning with a Yule tree prior and an uncorrelated
log-normal (relaxed) clock model, and with a prior on the
tree height and mean substitution rate, each available
model was evaluated. Firstly, any models estimating
implausible TMRCAs on the outgroup were discounted.
Implausible TMRCAs are, for example, those dated to the
pre-Cambrian. For those models which gave stable
results, the ratio of the marginal likelihoods (with respect
to the prior) of alternative models (i.e., the Bayes Factor,
BF) was used to choose between them[121] (here importance sampling and the harmonic mean of the sampled
likelihoods are used as estimators of the marginal likelihoods). Where there was a tie between two models both
were run and the model giving the higher ESS values
(most efficient run) was chosen; there was no marked difference in parameter estimates for such ties. Choice of
nucleotide substitution model followed that for the BM
described above (based on MrModeltest), followed by use
of BF tests to look for simpler, equally suitable, models for
use in BEAST.
