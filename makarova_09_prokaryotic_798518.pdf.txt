Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism of defense against
viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating translation of endogenous mRNAs. The
RNAi systems recognize the target RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or
partially complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi systems are
proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function as slicers, the nucleases that cleave
the target RNA that is base-paired to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPRassociated system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is, in part, mechanistically
analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode
homologs of Argonaute-PIWI proteins but their functions remain unknown.
Results: We present a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic
neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic Ago/PIWI proteins
always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains,
the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain
is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported by a phylogenetic analysis
of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated,
and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases in putative operons.
An additional, uncharacterized domain that is fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique
signature of operons encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form. By contrast, almost all PAZdomain containing pAgos are predicted to be active nucleases. Some proteins of this group (e.g.,
that from Aquifex aeolicus) have been experimentally shown to possess nuclease activity, and are
not typically associated with genes for other (putative) nucleases. Given these observations, the
apparent extensive horizontal transfer of pAgo genes, and their common, statistically significant
over-representation in genomic neighborhoods enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in the
defense against phages and/or plasmids, we hypothesize that pAgos are key components of a novel
class of defense systems. The PAZ-domain containing pAgos are predicted to directly destroy virus
or plasmid nucleic acids via their nuclease activity, whereas the apparently inactivated, PAZ-lacking
pAgos could be structural subunits of protein complexes that contain, as active moieties, the
putative nucleases that we predict to be co-expressed with these pAgos. All these nucleases are

predicted to be DNA endonucleases, so it seems most probable that the putative novel phage/
plasmid-defense system targets phage DNA rather than mRNAs. Given that in eukaryotic RNAi
systems, the PAZ domain binds a guide RNA and positions it on the complementary region of the
target, we further speculate that pAgos function on a similar principle (the guide being either DNA
or RNA), and that the uncharacterized domain found in putative operons with the short forms of
pAgos is a functional substitute for the PAZ domain.
Conclusion: The hypothesis that pAgos are key components of a novel prokaryotic immune
system that employs guide RNA or DNA molecules to degrade nucleic acids of invading mobile
elements implies a functional analogy with the prokaryotic CASS and a direct evolutionary
connection with eukaryotic RNAi. The predictions of the hypothesis including both the activities
of pAgos and those of the associated endonucleases are readily amenable to experimental tests.

Background
The discovery of elaborate and versatile systems of RNAmediated gene silencing in eukaryotes is one of the pivotal
advances in biology of the last decade [1-5]. There are
three major, distinct forms of regulatory small RNAs
involved in eukaryotic gene silencing: small interfering
(si) RNAs, micro (mi) RNAs, and PIWI-associated (pi)
RNA (previously referred to as rasiRNA) [6]. The siRNAs
are derived from double-stranded RNAs of viruses and
transposable elements, which are processed by Dicer, one
of the essential components of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complexes (RISCs) [7-11]. Dicer cleaves long dsRNA
molecules into short, 21–22 nucleotide duplexes which
are subsequently unwound and the guide strand is loaded
on another crucial component of RISC, the Argonaute
(Ago) slicer nuclease. The Ago-siRNA complex then binds
to the target mRNA which is cleaved by the PIWI domain
of Argonaute (Ago), after which the mRNA fragments are
released and the RISC-siRNA catalytic complex is recycled
[9,12-14].
Variant, paralogous Dicers and Argonautes are involved in
the mechanisms of the other classes of small RNA such as
miRNA and piRNA [14]. Unlike the siRNAs, 21–25 ntlong miRNAs are encoded in eukaryotic genomes and are
either perfectly (in plants) or imperfectly (in animals)
complementary to sequences in the 3'-untranslated
regions of specific endogenous mRNAs [12]. Base-pairing
of miRNAs with the target mRNAs, which is mediated by
a distinct form of RISC, results either in RNA cleavage or
in down-regulation of translation without cleavage [8].
Evidence is rapidly accumulating that numerous of miRNAs in animals and plants are major players in development regulation and chromatin remodeling [3].
Dicer and Argonaute are the core components of RISCs.
Dicer is a multi-domain protein that typically consists of
a DEXD/H-type helicase domain fused with an RNA-binding PAZ domain, two RNAse III domains, and in some
cases a dsRNA-binding domain [14]. The Argonaute pro-

tein is composed of four domains including the PAZ RNAbinding domain and the PIWI family exonuclease, and
performs the slicer function [9,12,13]. Both Dicer and
Argonaute are represented by variable numbers of paralogs in eukaryotes, and different paralogs are included in
RISCs with distinct functions [9,12,13].
Prokaryotes possess apparent functional counterparts to
the miRNA system, that is, regulation of bacterial gene
expression by small antisense RNAs. The best characterized of these pathways employ the RNA-binding protein
Hfq for small RNA presentation and RNAse E for target
degradation [15-17]. Escherichia coli appears to encode
~60 microRNA genes [18,19], and comparable numbers
of expressed, small antisense RNAs have been detected in
the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus [20] and Sulfolobus solfataricus [8] suggesting an important role of this regulatory
mechanism in prokaryotic physiology. In addition, small
antisense RNAs have been shown to regulate plasmid replication and to kill plasmid-free bacterial cells by silencing
specific plasmid genes [21].
The recently discovered major prokaryotic phage/plasmid
defense system, the CRISPR associated system (CASS)
[[22,23], Waters, 2009 #566], also relies on guide RNA
that apparently targets invader DNA [24]. The hallmark of
the CASS is that this system encompasses a still poorly
understood mechanism for integrating fragments of bacteriophage DNA into a specific site within the CRISPR
repeat cassette; at least in part, integration of these fragments is probably mediated by the Cas1 proteins that has
been predicted [22,25] and more recently experimentally
demonstrated to possess DNAse activity [26]. The unique,
phage/plasmid-specific CRISPR inserts are then transcribed and processed to guide RNAs that are directed to
the target DNA by the Cascade complex which (in
Escherichia coli K12) consists of 5 Cas proteins and seems
to a be a functional analog of the RISC [27]. Despite general functional analogies, the molecular mechanisms of
CASS and eukaryotic RNAi are distinct, and the protein

components of the two systems are not homologous
[22,28].
Many archaea and bacteria do encode homologs of the
major protein components of eukaryotic RNAi, in particular, Argonaute-PIWI family proteins, and the helicase
and RNAse III domains of Dicer although the fusion of
these domains in a single protein appears to be a eukaryotic signature [29]. The crystal structures of Argonaute
homologs from two thermophilic bacteria [30,31] and
two archaea [32,33] have been solved, and the structures
appear to be very similar to those of eukaryotic Argonautes [34]. However the functions of the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (hereinafter pAgo) remain obscure,
despite the in vitro demonstration of the RNAse H-like
ribonuclease activity (cleavage of RNA in a DNA/RNA
duplex) of the pAgos from the bacteria Aquifex aeolicus
[35] and Thermus thermophilus [36].
Here, we apply comparative genomics and in-depth computational analysis of Argonaute-PIWI family proteins
and other proteins that are typically encoded in their
genomic neighborhoods to predict the biological functions of pAgo. We present a hypothesis that the prokaryotic Argonautes are key components of a novel class of
virus/plasmid defense systems.

Results and Discussion
Prokaryotic Argonaute homologs belong to two major
groups based on the presence or absence of the PAZ
domain
To identify all prokaryotic Argonaute homologs, we performed a PSI-BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the PIWI domain

(the most highly conserved domain in the Argonaute family proteins) sequence from the Thermus thermophilus
HB27 pAgo (TT_P0026, pdb: 3DLB containing; PIWI
domain sequences in amino acid positions 415–685).
The search was run until convergence (after the 3rd iteration) and resulted in the identification of 100 sequences,
some of which were fragmented or truncated proteins;
additional searches started with some of the detected proteins showed that this sequence set represents the full
complement of PIWI-domain proteins (pAgo) encoded in
currently available prokaryotic genomes. For more
detailed analysis, we selected 85 sequences from 80
genomes (the genomes of the bacteria Parvularcula bermudensis HTCC2503 and Halorubrum lacusprofundi ATCC
49239 encode three pAgo proteins each, and the genome
of Acidobacterium capsulatum ATCC 51196 encodes two
pAgos) (see Additional File 1).
Comparative sequence analysis of the identified pAgos
showed that the conserved, alignable region shared by all
these sequences approximately corresponded to the L2,
Mid and PIWI domains, as inferred from the crystal structures of the pAgos from the hyperthermophilic bacterium
Aquifex aeolicus (AaAgo; pdb: 1YVU[35]), Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo; pdb 3DLB[31,36]), as well as the archaea
Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo; pdb 1Z25[33]) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfAgo; pdb: 1W9H[37]) (Figure 1; see also
Additional File 2). In addition to the three conserved
domains, both pAgos whose structures have been solved
contain an N-terminal domain, an L1 domain, and a PAZ
domain that, as in eukaryotic Argonaute, binds the 3' end
of a siRNA guide and positions the middle of siRNA guide
bound to the target mRNA in the catalytic pocket of the
PIWI nuclease [32-34]. However, among the identified

pAgos, more than half lack the N-terminal, L1 and PAZ
domains although several instead contain an N-terminal
fusion with predicted nucleases of the Sir2 family (Figure
1 and see details below).
PIWI domain is inactivated in numerous pAgos
The PIWI domain of Argonaute proteins belongs to the
RNAse H fold and shares the divalent cation-binding
motif DDE (aspartate, aspartate, glutamate) involved in
catalysis with many other nucleases that cleave both RNA
and DNA http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/
scop.b.d.hh.html[38]. The two aspartates are essential for
the slicer activity of eukaryotic Argonautes whereas the
third catalytic residue can be glutamate, histidine, aspartate or lysine [34]. Another conserved feature of Argonautes is the presence of a basic residue (in most instances,
arginine) that is located in the catalytic site [35]. Some
eukaryotic Argonaute proteins appear to be inactive
(hence denoted non-slicer Argonautes), especially, in
nematodes [34]. Apparently, non-slicer Argonautes interfere with translation through binding rather than cleavage
of mRNA [39]. Examination of the multiple alignment of
the catalytic cores of prokaryotic PIWI domains strongly
suggests that the majority of these domains are inactivated
as indicated by the replacement of two or all three acidic
residues required for catalysis; this apparent abrogation of
the nuclease activity is particularly common in those pAgo
proteins that lack the PAZ domain (Figure 2).

The AfAgo protein, which does not contain a PAZ
domain, also lacks the catalytic aspartates but has been
shown to bind dsRNA [32,40]. Structural analysis of
AfAgo complexed with a siRNA-like duplex showed that
in this protein a Cd2+ ion bound to the carboxy-terminal
carboxylate and several amino acid residues in the middle
(MID) domain are involved in the recognition of the
unpaired 5' nucleotide of siRNA [32,40]. In contrast, a
structural and biochemical study of AaAgo, which contains the PAZ domain and the conserved catalytic residues, showed that this protein is an active RNAse H with
a preference for a DNA/RNA hybrid as a substrate, suggesting that some pAgos employ small guide DNA molecules
to cleave mRNA [35]. The detailed study of the Thermus
thermophilus pAgo corroborated the findings on AaAgo by
revealing the details of interactions with the 5'-phosphorylated 21-base DNA guide strand and the DNA-guided
RNA cleavage by this protein [31,36].
Phylogenetic analysis of the Argonaute family suggests
extensive horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes
We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the PIWI domains
from all the detected pAgos (after excluding sequences
that were fragmented or truncated due to poor annotation) and a subset of eukaryotic Argonautes (Figure 3).
The majority of the PIWI domains from pAgos that lack a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/29

PAZ domain form a distinct clade although a few of these
short forms cluster within the other clade that consists
mostly of full-size, PAZ-containing pAgos. Within the latter clade, the short proteins do not form a distinct group
(Figure 3), suggesting the N-terminal part of pAgo was lost
independently in several lineages. Consistent with the
similarity of domain architectures and with the results of
previous analyses [29], eukaryotic Argonautes belong to a
well-supported clade together with a distinct subset of
archaeal pAgos; in particular the structurally characterized
Pyrococcus furiosus protein, that is considered to be the
model for Argonaute functioning in eukaryotes [33].
Other archaeal proteins are scattered in the tree, suggesting multiple horizontal gene transfers (HGT) between
bacteria and archaea (Figure 3). Despite the existence of
several small lineage-specific groups (alpha proteobacteria, gamma proteobacteria, bacteroides and cyanobacteria), the results of our phylogenetic analysis strongly
suggest that pAgo genes mostly disseminated by HGT; the
patchy distribution of these genes makes it unlikely that
they perform indispensible functions in any bacteria or
archaea (Figure 3).
The pAgos are contextually linked to at least three distinct
families of predicted nucleases
We further examined the genomic context of the pAgo
genes; analysis of genomic context has been established as
a powerful approach for prediction of the biological functions of prokaryotic genes using the "guilt by association"
principle [41-43]. In many cases, these genes form potential operons with a variety of genes encoding uncharacterized proteins (neighbor genes were predicted to be
encoded in a potential operon with pAgos if they were
located upstream or downstream of the respective pAgo
gene on the same DNA strand and if the intergenic distances in such an array of co-directional genes were
shorter than 100 nt; see Additional File 1). We performed
an in-depth analysis of the sequences of the proteins
encoded in the genes co-localized with pAgos using PSIBLAST, HHpred and CDD search (see Methods). This
analysis resulted in the identification of four protein families that are predicted to be co-expressed and thus functionally linked with the pAgos.

The first family is typified by the xccb100_3097 protein
from Xanthomonas campestris B100, the only protein
among the pAgo neighbors that, in the current sequence
databases, is annotated as a "putative Sir2-family regulator" rather than a "hypothetical protein". Indeed, CDD
search detected statistically significant similarity between
the N-terminal domain of this protein and the SIR2
domain (cl00195, E-value = 5 × 10-5). The Sir2 proteins,
also known as sirtuins, are a well characterized family of
NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases in eukaryotes
where they play key roles in the regulation of gene silenc-

Prokaryotic PIWI-domains: predicted active nucleases and apparently inactivated forms
Prokaryotic PIWI-domains: predicted active nucleases and apparently inactivated forms. The multiple sequence
alignment includes the core motifs of PIWI domains encompassing the amino acid residues that comprise the (D/E)-(D/E)XK
active site. The sequences are denoted by their GI numbers and species names. The positions of the first and the last residues
of the aligned region in the corresponding protein are indicated for each sequence. The numbers within the alignment represent poorly conserved inserts that are not shown. The catalytic residues of the D-RD-EXK active site are shown in reverse
shading and shown underneath the secondary structure, which corresponds to the solved structure for Pf-Ago (PDB: 1Z25);
'H' indicates α-helix, 'E' indicates extended conformation (β-strand). Sequence identifiers for pAgos that are not associated
with other proteins in putative operons are highlighted in bold. The coloring is based on the consensus shown underneath the
alignment; 'h' indicates hydrophobic residues (WFYMLIVACTH), 'p' indicates polar residues (EDKRNQHTS), 's' indicates small
residues (ACDGNPSTV).

ing, DNA repair, metabolic enzymes, and life span [4447]. Representatives of this family also have been identified in both bacteria and archaea, and the structures of
several Sir2 family proteins have been solved [48,49]. So
far all experimentally characterized Sir2 family proteins
have been shown to possess protein deacetylase activity
[48]. However, a distinct family of prokaryotic sirtuins is
associated with DNA-pumping ATPases of the FtsK-HerA
family [50]. Because in numerous other instances the
FtsK-like ATPases are associated with known nucleases,
both functionally and in terms of the operon structure, it
was hypothesized that this particular family of sirtuins
could function as nucleases, and a conserved DxH motif
was implicated in the predicted nuclease activity [50]. The
majority of the xccb100_3097-like proteins contain only
one of these residues, namely, the aspartate in the loop
between strand 7 and helix 11 (according to the crystal
structure of human Sirt2 histone deacetylase, pdb:
1j8f[51]) but instead have an additional aspartate in the
strand 2 that is conserved within this family(Figure 4A).
Similarly to Sir2 proteins associated with the FtsK-like
ATPases, xccb100_3097-like proteins lack the Zn-ribbon
insert between strand 4 and helix 10 that is characteristic
of most sirtuins, but retain all NAD+-binding site residues,
suggesting that these proteins are active enzymes (Figure
4A).
For the C-terminal domain of xccb100_3097, we failed to
detect any statistically significant similarities to known
domains using CDD search or HHpred. However, PSIBLAST search with the xccb100_3097 used as a query
revealed many homologs with similar domain architectures, all of which are associated with pAgos in putative
operons; moreover, several multidomain proteins (eg.
GIs: 91783256, 218130589, 229435559) comprise
fusions of xccb100_3097-like and PIWI domains (see the
alignment of this domain in Additional File 3).
The second family of PIWI-associated proteins is typified
by the mlr6203 (GI: 13475182) protein from Mesorhizobium loti. The HHpred search convincingly shows that the
N-terminal domain of these proteins belongs to the Mrr
family of restriction endonucleases, with the hallmark (D/
E)-(D/E)XK active site [52,53] (for example, the best hit is
to pdb: 2ost, homing endonuclease from Synechocystis sp.,
E-value = 0.04; followed by a hit to pfam04471, Restriction endonuclease, E-value = 0.04). All experimentally
characterized superfamily representatives are site-specific
endonucleases that cleave dsDNA and possess an enormous variety of recognition sites [52-54]. The active site
residues are conserved in all mlr6203 homologs (Figure
4B), so this domain probably is an active DNA endonuclease. As with the xccb100_3097 family proteins, no similarity to the C-terminal domain of the mlr6203 was
detected in CDD and HHpred searches. However, the PSI-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/29

BLAST search identified 17 homologous proteins with the
same domain architecture and predicted operon organization (see Additional File 1).
A typical representative of the third family is
RHECIAT_PB0000019 (GI: 190894000) from Rhizobium
etli. This protein contains an N-terminal TIR domain that
was easily detected by HHpred (the best hit is to pdb: 2js7,
TIR domain of myeloid differentiation primary response
protein MYD88 from human, E-value of 1.1 × 10-30). The
TIR domain mediates protein-protein interactions and
belongs to the STIR superfamily that includes mostly
eukaryotic proteins involved in diverse signaling pathways as well as a variety of poorly characterized multidomain proteins from bacteria and archaea with large
genomes (that also have been implicated in transcription
regulation and signaling [55-57]). Notably, TIR domains
play important roles in disease and stress resistance in
plants [58]. Similarly, in mammals, TIR-domains are key
components of the immune system-based antimicrobial
and antiviral response, and the programmed cell death
(PCD) system [59,60]. Analysis of domain architectures
led to the hypothesis that prokaryotic TIR-domain proteins also could be involved in PCD [61]. All closely
related homologs of the RHECIAT_PB0000019 protein
contain the TIR domain (see Additional File 3), whereas
several proteins in this family (e.g. GI: 162145848) also
contain an additional N-terminal domain that belongs to
the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily (a vast assemblage
of nucleases that includes, among others, the restriction
endonucleases) with all catalytic residues typically conserved (Figure 4B). The C-terminal domain of these proteins is not similar to any known domain, but does show
a weak sequence similarity (with statistical significance
difficult to demonstrate) to the C-terminal domain of the
mlr6203-like family. Considering similar sizes of the corresponding domains in both families and, most importantly, the genomic association with predicted nucleases
and pAgos, we strongly suspect that these domains are
homologous; examination of their multiple alignment
indeed shows several distinct, conserved motifs (see Additional File 3). The predicted secondary structure indicates
that this is a globular domain, however, the pattern of
amino acid residue conservation does not seem to suggest
an enzymatic function. Given that the proteins containing
this domain are found exclusively in the same neighborhoods with pAgos that lack the PAZ domain, it is tempting
to speculate that this uncharacterized domain is functionally analogous to the PAZ domain, that is, involved in
binding a guide nucleic acid molecule (hereinafter we
refer to this domain as APAZ, after Analog of PAZ).
The fourth family of pAgo-associated proteins is linked to
full-size, PAZ-domain-containing Argonaute homologs
and can be typified by the protein PTH_0722 (GI:

Phylogenetic analysis of PIWI-domains and organization of the predicted pAgo operons
Phylogenetic analysis of PIWI-domains and organization of the predicted pAgo operons. The ML tree is rooted
between the (predominantly) PAZ-domain-containing and PAZ-domain- lacking branches. The RELL bootstrap values are indicated (%) for selected major branches. Color code: gray, Eukaryota; orange, Archaea; blue, Proteobacteria, green, Firmicutes;
black, other lineages of bacteria. Each organism is denoted by the full systematic name and the Gene Identifier (GI) number.
The PDB ID is indicated for those sequences for which tertiary structure is solved. Sequences of short PIWI proteins (that
have lost N-terminal part including PAZ domain) but belong to the branch that consists mostly of full size sequences are indicated by "#" symbol. For those PIWI-domain proteins that are associated with genes encoding a nuclease domain, the domain
architectures of the pAgo-associated proteins are shown.

147677057) from Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum. This
protein contains a C-terminal domain that belongs to the
PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily (HHPred detects similarity to SfsA: Sugar fermentation stimulation protein,
which contains a PD-(D/E)XK nuclease domain, with Evalue = 0.022) and contains all the catalytic residues (Figure 4B); this putative nuclease is clearly distinct from and
only very distantly related to the restriction endonuclease
domain of the mlr6203-like family proteins. The N-terminal domain of this protein does not show similarity to any
characterized domains, has a predicted predominantly αhelical structure and is present only in close homologs of
PTH_0722 (see Additional File 4). In the GobsU_24486
protein of Gemmata obscuriglobus, the nuclease domain is
replaced by the apparently functionally unrelated SEFIR
domain of the STIR superfamily, that is only distantly

related to the TIR domain, but is also involved in various
signaling pathways [57].
Several other genomic neighbors of pAgos are worth mentioning (Figure 3). Two genes that encode PAZ-domaincontaining but, apparently, inactivated pAgos (in the bacteria Pedobacter heparinus and Spirosoma lingual) are associated with predicted Sir2 family nucleases (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, three long forms of pAgos (one inactivated,
in the bacterium Dehalococcoides sp, and two apparently
active ones in Microcystis aeruginosa and Clostridium bartletti) are associated with PD-(D/E)XK nucleases of a distinct subfamily related to Cas4 (COG1468), which is
mostly represented within CASS [22]. Most conspicuously, as noticed previously, in the archaeon Methanopyrus
kandleri, the pAgo is encoded within an operon that otherwise encodes components of the CASS [22].

A potentially important pattern revealed by this analysis
of the genomic context of prokaryotic PIWI-domain proteins is that, almost without exception, pAgos with an
apparently inactivated catalytic PIWI domain are associated with a predicted nuclease in a putative operon (Figures 2, 3 and see Additional File 1). This observation
suggests the possibility of functional complementarity
between the nuclease activity of PIWI domains of pAgos
and other nucleases, in particular, homologs of restriction
endonucleases (see discussion below).
Statistical analysis of the genomic neighborhoods of pAgos
reveals a significant link to phage resistance systems
Considering (i) the central role of Argonaute proteins in
siRNA-based antiviral response in eukaryotes, (ii) the contextual links between pAgos and nucleases (in particular,
restriction endonucleases) that are involved in phage/
plasmid defense in prokaryotes, and (iii) links to the TIR
domain that also functions in antimicrobial response in
eukaryotes, it is tempting to hypothesize that an important if not the principal function of the pAgos has to do
with phage defense (or, more generally, defense against
viruses, plasmids, and other mobile elements). Phage
defense systems in prokaryotes are notably prone to HGT
(the CASS being the prime showcase), and phylogenetic
analysis of the pAgos clearly indicates that HGT shapes the
evolution of pAgo-encoding genes as well (Figure 3). In
addition, phage defense systems are often encoded in
genomic islands [62]. Therefore we sought to statistically
test the hypothesis that pAgo genes are non-randomly
associated with known phage resistance genes in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, we identified 4 classes of phage
defense systems (some of which are also involved in a
broader range of stress response reactions) in a representative set of 45 prokaryotic genomes and computed the
fractions of these genes throughout the genomes and in
the vicinity of pAgo genes (see Methods for details). The
Fisher Omnibus test [63,64] reveals a statistically highly
significant enrichment of the pAgo genomic neighborhoods (see Methods for details) for different combinations of 4 classes of phage defense genes used as a target
set (Table 1). As a control, we performed the same analysis
for pAgo genes and typical components of the bacterial
mobilome including transposases and various phagederived genes; no statistically significant association was
found between pAgos and these mobile genes (p = 0.63;
see Additional Files 5 and 6).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/29

of which are dedicated to the defense against viruses and
transposable elements. (2). The guide-DNA-dependent
nuclease activity of AaAgo and TtAgo. (3). Extensive HGT
of pAgos which is best compatible with a stress-response
related function. (4). Preferential location of pAgo genes
in genomic neighborhoods significantly enriched in
known phage-defense genes. (5). Co-localization of PIWIdomain protein genes with genes encoding other (predicted) nucleases. (6). The near perfect complementarity
between the predicted nuclease and guide-binding activities of pAgos and co-localization with other putative
nucleases: the inactivated pAgos that lack the PAZ domain
are associated with genes encoding predicted nucleases
whereas the apparently active, PAZ-containing pAgos are
not (Figure 3). The latter observation suggests that pAgos
function within nuclease complexes, in some cases as
their catalytic subunits, and in other cases, as structural
subunits interacting with the actual nucleases.
Additional functional clues allow us to tentatively propose more specific mechanisms for the functions of pAgos
in the defense of prokaryotes against mobile elements
(Figure 5). In eukaryotic Argonautes, the PAZ domain
binds the small guide RNA and facilitates its hybridization
with the complementary region of the target mRNA. Most
of the pAgos that are predicted to be active nucleases also
contain PAZ domains suggesting that they function via a
similar mechanism, in agreement with the experimental
data for AaAgo and TtAgo [31,36,63,64]. The apparently
inactivated pAgos lack PAZ domains but are co-localized
with genes encoding predicted nucleases and the APAZ
domain (Figure 1, 2). The (so far) exclusive presence of
the APAZ domain within predicted operons encoding
inactivated pAgos makes us speculate that, similary to PAZ
domains, the APAZ domains bind guide molecules and
target the putative nuclease complex to phage nucleic
acids.

The PD-(D/E)XK superfamily nucleases, to which the predicted nucleases associated with the majority of pAgos are
homologous, so far have been shown to cleave exclusively
dsDNA. Thus, it seems most likely that the predicted
pAgo-based defense systems directly target invader
dsDNA genomes rather than mRNAs (Figure 5). On the
other hand, as stated above, in vitro analyses have
revealed that AaAgo and TtAgo are most active as DNAguided ribonuclease, suggesting that RNA may be a target
as well [REFS [35,36]]. The guide molecule could be either
a small RNA (with the implication that the respective
nuclease cleaves a RNA-DNA hybrid) or a small DNA as
suggested by the study of AaAgo [63,64] and TtAgo
[31,36].
The proposed model for the pAgo-based phage defense
shows functional analogies to both CASS and the eukaryotic RNAi (Figure 5). Given the phylogenetic affinity of a
distinct family of apparently active archaeal pAgos and
eukaryotic Argonautes (Figure 3), this hypothetical
defense system is the probable evolutionary progenitor of
the eukaryotic RNAi. The spread of RNA viruses in eukaryotes that was accompanied by the displacement of the
majority of DNA viruses [65] could have been the driving
force behind the switch of the specificity of this defense
system from DNA to RNA.

Conclusion
The functions of the pAgos to some extent have been characterized in vitro (Yuan 2005)[31,36] but remain to be

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/29

determined in vivo. The convergence of several lines of evidence discussed here seems to strongly support the
hypothesis that pAgos are key components of a novel class
of immune system that employ guide DNA or RNA molecules to destroy virus and plasmid DNA or mRNA). These
proposed mechanisms of action suggest functional parallels between the predicted pAgo-based defense systems
and CASS, and a direct evolutionary link between the
former and eukaryotic RNAi. The predictions of the
hypothesis, in particular, the nuclease activity catalyzed
by PAZ-domain-containing but not by PAZ-domain-lacking pAgos, the complementary activities of associated
putative nucleases, and guide DNA or RNA binding by the
APAZ domains are amenable to straightforward experimental validation.

Methods
Sequence analysis
All analyzed sequences were from the non-redundant protein sequence database at the NCBI. Database searches
were performed using PSI-BLAST [66], typically, with the
inclusion threshold E = 0.01, and no composition-based
statistics or low complexity filtering, or the HH search program available through the HHpred server [67]. Multiple
alignments of protein sequences were constructed by
combining the results obtained with the PROMALS program [68] and the MUSCLE program [69], followed by a
minimal manual correction on the basis of local alignments obtained using PSI-BLAST [66]. Protein secondary
structure was predicted using the PSIPRED program [70].

Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed from the alignment of PIWI domain region (only
positions with less than 30% gaps were used for reconstruction – 258 altogether), by using the MOLPHY program [71] with the JTT substitution matrix to perform
local rearrangement of an original Fitch tree [72]. The
MOLPHY program was also used to compute RELL bootstrap values.

mechanisms of CASS and eukaryotic RNAi. Currently,
models (3) and/or (4) are the most likely functional mechanisms for pAgo (see text) but the eukaryotic Ago-like (1) and
the prokaryotic CASS-like (2) models cannot be ruled out at
this stage. RNA molecules are shown in red and DNA molecules in blue. Circles denote the proteins that form complexes with the guide RNA or DNA. Arrows indicate the
directions of the respective processes.

Fisher Omnibus test
Only 45 completely sequenced genomes were used for
this analysis; the complete genome information was
obtained from FTP of RefSeq database (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/;[73]). Proteins in
these genomes were assigned to COGs using a modified
COGNITOR program [74]. The target sets of phages
defense proteins were obtained from the following
sources: restriction-modification (RM) systems related
protein from REBASE [75]; abortive infection (ABI)
related genes from the Chopin et al. review [76]; CRISPR
systems related genes from [22] and toxin-antitoxin
related genes from [77]. Proteins of the RM and ABI systems were assigned to COG as indicated above, and for
other systems, COG numbers have been already reported

in the aforementioned papers (see the complete list of
these COGs in Additional File 5).
In each genome, we identified the genes that belong to
each of the aforementioned four well-characterized phage
defense systems and computed the gene counts for each
system in the entire genome (K phage defense genes in a
genome containing N genes) as well as within each of
windows of size ± w = 10 surrounding each pAgo gene (k
genes in window). For each window, the probability to
observe ≥k phage defense genes by chance was approximated using the binomial distribution:

Draft Public Comments

"Emerging evidence about prokaryotic homologs of Argonaute (pAgo) makes it clear that these proteins are related
to their eukaryotic counterparts not just in sequence and
structure, but also in molecular function. They might be
related as well in terms of biological process, perhaps with
many or most serving a primary function of phage resistance rather than of host gene transcriptional regulation.
The case made in this manuscript, as argued by the interpretation of protein domain architecture, is highly suggestive. However, the statistical test for genomic association
of pAgo with other phage resistance systems is currently

unconvincing in the absence of a negative control. Other
possible roles for pAgos seem equally consistent with
available data."
Authors' response
a negative control, namely, a test of the possible association of
pAgos with mobile genes that are not involved in phage defense
is included in the revised manuscript (see Additional File 5).
As the result of this test was indeed negative, we find the statistical evidence as convincing as it can be although the final
proof, of course, can only be experimental.

"One alternate possibility is that most pAgos serve as
machinery for boutique host regulatory systems. Antisense RNA expression in bacteria has been underappreciated; its prevalence likely is still underestimated. Some
antisense RNA is cis-acting, through a mechanism of transcriptional interference, but some is trans-acting, through
mechanisms of dsRNA formation. Since the trans-acting
antisense RNAs themselves have won only a limiting
understanding, it stands to reason that mechanisms acting
downstream of dsRNA formation also are incompletely
understood. A role for many pAgo proteins in the control
of host gene expression seems quite likely."
Authors' response
The possibility that some pAgos are also involved in regulation
of bacterial genes is certainly interesting and not implausible.
However, the data presented in this paper suggest to us that the
functions in defense against mobile elements are primary.

"A second possibility for these systems, supported by their
apparent high degree of lateral transfer, is that most are
selfish genetic elements. By analogy to transposons, homing endonucleases encoded within inteins, and temperate
phage, these systems may carry out nuclease reactions
simply to mediate their own spread. Some incidental benefit to host genomes is possible; any endogenous nuclease, it may be assumed, has some potential to cleave
phage DNA or RNA, as in the example of ribonuclease
HIII vs. RNA phage. But that level of phage resistance
capability could be regarded as secondary."
Authors' response
All prokaryotic defense and stress response systems are to a large
extent selfish as discussed in detail for restriction-modification
and toxin-atitoxin systems. We strongly suspect that this is
indeed the case for the putative pAgo-centered system as well.

"The extreme selective pressures of phage/host warfare
make it quite likely that the proposed role for pAgos in
phage resistance in prokaryotes is at least occasionally
true. The greater question is whether pAgos proteins represent a new, major player in prokaryotic resistance to
phage attack, and whether most pAgos proteins have host

Biology Direct 2009, 4:29

defense as a primary role. This is a mirror to the question
of whether CRISPR arrays might be co-opted to serve perform regulatory functions, given their extreme plasticity
and their transcription into small RNAs – one might
examine repeat arrays in after phage-free serial passage of
selected strains under extreme selection."
Authors' response
Cooperation of pAgo with the CRISPR system cannot be ruled
out but appears unlikely. Of the 780 bacterial and archaeal
genomes that we analyzed for the presence of CRISPR and
pAgo, 291 encoded CRISPR and 51 encoded pAgo, with the
overlap of only 28 genomes. Of course, the localization of the
pAgo gene within the Cas gene array in Methanopyrus kandleri
is suggestive but so far this remains the only genome that shows
such an association.

"Restriction enzyme systems, especially restriction/modification systems, discriminate self vs. non-self by recognizing short sequence signatures in phage that are either
masked or missing in the host. CRISPR systems discriminate self from non-self by capture and expression of samples of exogenous DNA. Both abortive infection systems
and toxin-antitoxin systems have the potential to shut
down the host cell, in response to stress from phage infection, in order to block the phage life cycle. Each of these
schemes provides a clear model of how defense mechanisms are triggered. The trickiest part of the model for
pAgos in phage defense concerns the source of guide DNA
or RNA. Is it DNA encoded on the host chomosome? Will
it have a promoter and a terminator? It seems at least theoretically possible that CRISPR arrays themselves might
be a source. If a typical CRISPR system targets phage DNA
according to exact matches to spacer sequences, one might
postulate a backup system in which the same small RNAs,
with some tolerance for mismatches, silence phage
mRNA. It therefore makes sense to ask – what fraction of
pAgos-containing genomes have CRISPR systems, and is
the prevalence significantly higher for any subgroup of
pAgos?"
Authors' response
It is indeed true that we do not have any inkling of the source
of the putative guide DNA or RNA that is employed by pAgo.
The idea that pAgo might share the guide molecules with
CRISPR is very interesting. The problem is that, as indicated
above, there is no clear sign of cooperation between pAgo and
CRISPR, and what is most damning for this provocative idea,
is that the majority of the genomes that encode pAgo possess no
CRISPR.

We attempted to search for sequence conservation and repetitive elements in the upstream and downstream regions of pAgo
operons but failed to find anything suggestive. When more

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/29

closely related genomes encoding pAgo become available, it will
be necessary to repeat this attempt.
A reasonable view of genome organization is that some
regions of a genome are more plastic than others. The
more plastic regions would be expected to accumulate
prophages, transposons, integrated plasmids, conjugation
regions, pseudogenes, and "fitness factors" such as CASS,
antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes, and capsular
polysaccharide genes, all in close proximity. In this view,
genes encoding restriction systems and CRISPR systems
likely would occur close to each other because both the
region tolerates insertion, not because both system mediate host defense. The statistical argument, therefore, does
not currently allow one to discriminate phage defense
from other possible functions for these systems. If the statistical association with RM and CASS is not replicated by
associations with secretion systems, pilus proteins, integrases and recombinases, plasmid partition proteins, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes, etc, then it may
become somewhat more convincing.
Authors' response
We appreciate this suggestion and sought to test the hypothesis
that co-localization of pAgo genes with those for other systems
of antiphage defence is a trivial consequence of the occurrence
of all these genes in highly plastic regions of prokaryotic
genomes. To this end, we examined the potential association of
pAgo genes with typical components of the mobilome such as
transposases, integrases, and various genes of apparent phage
origin. As indicated in the revised text of the article and presented in detail in the Additional Files 5 and 6, there was no
significant association between pAgo and the elements of the
mobilome. Thus we believe that the most parsimonious interpretation of the data is that there are indeed phage defence
islands in prokaryotic genomes and pAgo genes show a strong
association with these islands.
Reviewer 2
Martijn Huynen, Radboud University, Nijmegen Medical Centre
The manuscript by Makarova and co-workers provides a
compelling argument for the functional link between Bacterial and Archaeal Argonaute proteins and proteins that
are involved in defense against "foreign" DNA.

I only have a few comments:
Studies on the value of the genomic association of genes
for the prediction of functional links between proteins
have gone to a great length to actually benchmark at
which level of genomic association it not only becomes
statistically significant, but also functionally meaningful
in terms of predicting that proteins are actually involved
in the same pathway. I cannot judge the level of "functional relevance" of the P-values provided in table 1.

I take it that all genomes that were included in the significance study were phylogenetically distant enough to
assure that gene order conservation was not trivial?
Authors' response
No, we did this analysis for all available genomes, since even in
some closely related genomes the location of the pAgo operons is
different. In response to these concerns, we have redone the
analysis for distantly related genomes only. The results have not
substantially change; actually, even more significant p-values
were obtained (see the new Additional File 6).

"This analysis resulted" I cannot find how this analysis
was done, Fisher Ombnibus test mentioned in the methods does not require genes to be part of the same potential
operon, and "predicted to be co-expressed" can thus not
be concluded from it.

Chris Ponting, Oxford University
Makarova et al. have undertaken a thorough and illuminating analysis of prokaryotic Argonaute homologs. Their
analysis consists first of detailed sequence analysis of
PIWI domain homologs followed by investigation of
putative operons. The manuscript ends with a nice demonstration that pAgo genomic regions are significantly
enriched for phage defense genes. This allows them to
pose an important and testable hypothesis which provides the major contribution of this paper. The manuscript is well written and its analyses are sound.
