Abstract
Background: Two distinct lineages of rhadinoviruses related to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) have been identified in macaques and other Old World non-human
primates. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay using a TaqMan probe to
differentially detect and quantitate members of the rhadinovirus-2 (RV2) lineage. PCR primers
were derived from sequences within ORF 60 and the adjacent ORF 59/60 intergenic region which
were highly conserved between the macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses, rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) and
Macaca nemestrina rhadinovirus-2 (MneRV2). These primers showed little similarity to the
corresponding sequences of the macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses, retroperitoneal fibromatosis
herpesvirus Macaca nemestrina (RFHVMn) and Macaca mulatta (RFHVMm). To determine viral
loads per cell, an additional TaqMan QPCR assay was developed to detect the single copy cellular
oncostatin M gene.
Results: We show that the RV2 QPCR assay is linear from less than 2 to more than 300,000 copies
using MneRV2 DNA, and is non-reactive with RFHVMn DNA up to 1 billion DNA templates per
reaction. RV2 loads ranging from 6 to 2,300 viral genome equivalent copies per 106 cells were
detected in PBMC from randomly sampled macaques from the Washington National Primate
Research Center. Screening tissue from other primate species, including another macaque, Macaca
fascicularis, and a baboon, Papio cynocephalus, revealed the presence of novel rhadinoviruses,
MfaRV2 and PcyRV2, respectively. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis confirmed their
inclusion within the RV2 lineage of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses.
Conclusions: We describe a QPCR assay which provides a quick and sensitive method for
quantitating rhadinoviruses belonging to the RV2 lineage of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses found in a
variety of macaque species commonly used for biomedical research. While this assay broadly
detects different RV2 rhadinovirus species, it is unreactive with RV1 rhadinovirus species which
commonly co-infect the same primate hosts. We also show that this QPCR assay can be used to
identify novel RV2 rhadinoviruses in different primate species.

Background
Members of the Rhadinovirus genus of the gammaherpesviruses are lymphotrophic and are associated with a variety of lymphoproliferative diseases. Herpesvirus saimiri
(HVS), the prototype rhadinovirus isolated from the
South American squirrel monkey, causes fulminant T-cell
lymphomas in closely related host species [1]. Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpesvirus 8, the only known human rhadinovirus, is associated
with classical and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, primary
effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease
[2]. Other rhadinoviruses have been isolated from ruminants, including wildebeest, sheep and cows, that are
associated with malignant catarrhal fever, a lymphoproliferative syndrome [3,4].
We and others have demonstrated the existence of two
distinct lineages of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses in Old
World non-human primates [5,6]. The rhadinovirus-1
(RV1) lineage includes KSHV and closely related
homologs infecting different Old World non-human primate species. In macaques, the RV1 lineage is represented
by retroperitoneal fibromatosis herpesvirus (RFHV) that
was identified in retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) tumor
lesions of two macaque species at the Washington
National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) [7,8]. The
RV2 lineage in macaques includes rhesus rhadinovirus
(RRV) which was first identified in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of rhesus macaques
(M. mulatta) in the New England National Primate
Research Center (NENPRC) [9] and pig-tailed macaque
rhadinovirus/M. nemestrina RV2 (MneRV2) [5,10,11].
While sequence analysis of the RRV genome demonstrated a close similarity to KSHV [12,13], phylogenetic
analysis of multiple gene sequences has grouped RRV and
the closely related MneRV2 within the RV2 lineage distinct from RFHV and KSHV [5]. Although RV2 rhadinoviruses have been identified in all Old World non-human
primates tested, including gorillas and chimpanzees, no
evidence of a human homolog has so far been found
[6,14-17].
While complete genomic sequences have been obtained
for two closely related strains of the RV2 lineage rhadinovirus of rhesus macaques, RRV strain H26-95 from the
NENPRC [13] and RRV strain 17577 from the Oregon
National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) [12], little
information is known regarding the sequences of RV2
rhadinoviruses from other macaque species, and assays to
detect these rhadinoviruses have not been developed.
Quantitative real-time PCR assays (QPCR) have been
developed to specifically detect RRV in rhesus macaque
samples [18,19], but these assays have not be shown to
cross to other RV2 rhadinovirus species. Since the WaNPRC and other primate research centers in the US and

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/2

abroad utilize macaque species other than rhesus for biomedical research, we decided to obtain sequence information from the RV2 rhadinovirus of pig-tailed macaques,
MneRV2, in order to develop a general assay to detect RV2
rhadinoviruses from different macaque species. Our strategy was to identify gene sequences that were highly conserved between different RV2 species but not conserved
within macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses, such as RFHVMn or
RFHVMm, which are sometimes found in conjunction
with RV2 rhadinovirus infections. Previous nucleotide
sequence information for MneRV2 consisted only of a
region of the DNA polymerase which had significant
sequence similarity with the macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses, and therefore was unsuitable for the desired assay
[5]. We analyzed several regions of the RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus genomes as targets for a general RV2 specific
assay and identified the ORF 59/60 junctional region as a
suitable target. This region was highly conserved within
macaque RV2 rhadinovirus species but not within
macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses. In this paper, we report the
development of a sensitive and specific TaqMan QPCR
assay and its use in detecting and quantitating RV2 rhadinoviruses from different primate species.

Results
Identification of the ORF 59/60 junctional region from the
RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus species from Macaca
nemestrina, RFHVMn and MneRV2
The ORF 59 and ORF 60 genes show high levels of homology between the related rhadinoviruses, KSHV and RRV,
with 52% and 70% identity at the amino acid level,
respectively [13]. Using the CODEHOP approach [20,21],
we developed degenerate primers targeting conserved
amino acid motifs "RDEL" (ORF 60) and "PQFV" (ORF
59) that would enable the amplification and sequence
analysis of the ORF 59/60 junctional region of novel RV1
and RV2 rhadinovirus species as described in Materials
and Methods. The CODEHOP primers were used in PCR
amplification of DNA obtained from spleen tissue from
442N, a M. nemestrina, which has been previously shown
to contain a co-infection of both MneRV-2 and RFHVMn
rhadinoviruses [5]. PCR products from both MneRV2 and
RFHVMn were obtained as described in Materials and
Methods. Sequence analysis revealed a close similarity
between the 833 bp of the ORF59/60 junctional region
between the "RDEL" and "PQFV" motifs of MneRV2 and
the corresponding region of RRV, with an 87% nucleotide
identity. The 834 bp sequence of the RFHVMn junctional
region was 67% identical to the corresponding region of
KSHV and 60% identical to the RRV sequence. Phylogenetic analysis using DNA maximum-likelihood demonstrated a close clustering of the MneRV2 and RRV
sequences, while the RFHVMn sequence clustered with
the KSHV ORF59/60 sequence, as expected for the
macaque homolog of KSHV (Figure 1).

CODEHOP PCR primers from the rhadinoviruses MneRV2
(M. nemestrina), MfaRV2 (M. fascicularis), PcyRV2 (Papio cynocephalus) and RFHVMn (M. nemestrina) were aligned with the
corresponding published sequences for KSHV (homo sapiens;
U93872, bp 96678–97514), RRV (M. mulatta; AF083501, bp
92374–93205), and HVS (squirrel monkey, HSGEND, bp
81608–82613) using ClustalW. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the DNA maximum likelihood procedure from
Phylip. The division of New and Old World primate hosts is
indicated. The RV1 and RV2 lineages of the Old World primate rhadinoviruses are shown. Novel viruses identified with
the RV2 QPCR assay are underlined.

TaqMan quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay specific for RV2
rhadinoviruses
Multiple alignment of the RRV and MneRV2 nucleotide
sequences revealed large regions of identical sequences
within both the ORF 59 and ORF 60 coding regions and
the ORF 59/60 intergenic region. As shown in Figure 2, a
region of 71 identical nucleotides in the MneRV2 and RRV
sequences was identified at the 3' end of the ORF 60 gene
and the adjacent intergenic region. This region was only
43% conserved with the corresponding sequence of RFHVMn. Using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), a set of PCR primers (RV2a and RV2b) and a probe
(RV2-FAM) were identified for a TaqMan QPCR assay (71
bp amplicon) which would specifically detect these

TaqMan QPCR assay for the cellular gene, oncostatin M,
to determine cell number
In order to determine viral copy number per cell, an additional TaqMan QPCR assay was developed to detect a single copy cellular gene, oncostatin M (OSM) [22]. We had
previously determined the sequence of the OSM gene in
an African green monkey which was highly conserved
with the human gene (unpublished results). Using PCR
primers derived from consensus sequences of the human
and monkey gene, we determined the sequence of the
entire OSM coding sequence of the M. nemestrina OSM
gene (data not shown). Multiple alignment of the human,
monkey and macaque OSM sequences revealed a region
within exon 3 which was highly conserved. Using Primer
Express software, a set of primers (OSMa and OSMb; 76
bp amplicon) and a probe (OSM-FAM) were identified
(Fig. 3 and Table 1) which could be used to detect OSM
DNA from macaque, monkey and human sources allowing quantitation of cell number in tissue samples.
QPCR Assay Development and Characterization
The RV2 and OSM QPCR assays were optimized using
DNA obtained from the spleen of a rhesus macaque,
MmuA01111, which we have previously determined to
contain RRV DNA in a background of macaque genomic
DNA [23]. Initially, a temperature gradient PCR was performed to determine annealing temperatures that gave a
single PCR product. An annealing temperature of 62°C
was chosen because that temperature was optimal in both
the RV2 and OSM assays (data not shown). The magnesium chloride, nucleotide, primer and probe concentrations were then varied to determine conditions which
gave optimal efficiency.

Standard curves were obtained from a dilution series
using the optimal conditions for the RV2 and OSM assays
as described in Material and Methods. For the RV2 assay,
purified MneRV2 DNA obtained from a lytic infection of
rhesus primary fetal fibroblasts (RPFF) was assayed in
duplicate using 4-fold dilutions. As seen in Figure 4A, the
assay was linear across a range of dilutions from less than
2 to more than 3.0 × 105 copies of MneRV2, with a slope
of -3.320 (100% efficiency) and r2 = 0.997. For the OSM
assay, MmuA01111 genomic DNA was assayed in
duplicate using 4-fold dilutions, with the amount of DNA
tested ranging from 0.06 ng (corresponding to 20 diploid
OSM gene copies: equivalent to 10 cells) up to 1 µg (corresponding to 3.2 × 105 diploid OSM gene copies:
equivalent to 1.6 × 105 cells). The assay was linear across
this range with a slope of -3.322 (100% efficiency) and r2
= 0.999 (Fig. 4B).

Standard curves obtained from the RV2 rhadinovirus
and OSM reference cellular gene assays. A) The standard RV2 assay was performed on purified MneRV2 DNA in a
series of four-fold dilutions over the range of 2 copies to 3.0
× 105 copies of MneRV2. (slope = -3.320, 100% efficiency; r2
= 0.997). B) The standard OSM assay was performed on
MmuA01111 spleen DNA in a series of four-fold dilutions
over the range of 0.06 ng (20 diploid OSM gene copies) to 1
µg (3.2 × 105 diploid OSM gene copies). (slope = -3.322,
100% efficiency; r2 = 0.999)

RRV was subjected to 4-fold dilutions while keeping
genomic DNA levels constant at 1 µg per reaction by the
addition of DNA from an uninfected animal. The results
demonstrate that the assay was linear from less than 66
copies of RRV (256-fold dilution of MmuA01111 DNA in
uninfected macaque DNA) to more than 1.7 × 104 RRV
copies per µg genomic DNA (MmuA01111 DNA undiluted) with a slope of -3.318 (100% efficiency) and r2 =
0.988 (Fig. 5). This shows that the viral load determination would be accurate down to 410 RRV genomes/106
cells which is 1 viral copy per 2400 cells. The upper limit
in this assay was determined to be greater than 110,000
viral genomes/106 cells which is the number of viral copies of RRV in 1 µg of DNA from the MmuA01111 spleen.
To ensure that the RV2 assay does not detect RV1 viruses,
the assay was performed using DNA from the human and
macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses. A DNA sample from the
KSHV infected BCBL-1 cell line [24] containing approximately 4 × 106 copies of the KSHV genome and a sample
containing 109 copies of a PCR product of the ORF59/60
junctional region from RFHVMn were used as templates
in the RV2 assay. The RV-2 QPCR assay was negative for
these templates under the standard reaction conditions.
Identification of a novel RV2 rhadinovirus in Macaca
fascicularis using the RV2 QPCR assay
Since the RV2 QPCR assay was based on consensus
sequences shared by two distinct members of the RV2 lineage from M. mulatta and M. nemestrina, RRV and
MneRV2, respectively, we tested to see if this assay could
be used to identify a novel RV2 rhadinovirus in M. fascicularis. DNA was obtained from spleen tissue of Mfa95044,
an M. fascicularis from the Tissue Distribution Program at
the WaNPRC. Approximately 250 ng of spleen DNA produced a positive result in the RV2 QPCR assay with an

average cycle threshold (CT) of 31.9 cycles. In order to
prove that the assay detected a novel rhadinovirus, CODEHOP primers were used in a PCR amplification reaction
with the Mfa95044 spleen DNA to obtain the ORF59/60
intergenic region of this rhadinovirus as described in the
Materials and Methods. An 832 bp PCR product was
obtained and sequenced. A comparison of this sequence
with the corresponding region from RRV and MneRV2
showed 94% and 86% nucleotide identity, respectively.
The nucleotide identity with the corresponding region in
RFHV and KSHV was only 59% and 60%, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis showed a close clustering of the M.
fascicularis sequence with the RRV sequence and a more
distant relationship with the MneRV2 sequence,
confirming its origin from an RV2 rhadinovirus of M. fascicularis, herein termed MfaRV2 (Figure 1). The evolutionary relationship of these rhadinovirus species mirrors that
determined for the host macaque species themselves,
where the M. mulatta and M. fascicularis have been shown
to be more closely related to each other than to M. nemestrina [25]. Our data supports the hypothesis of a co-speciative divergence of the Old World primate rhadinoviruses
and their hosts [26]

Identification of a novel RV2 rhadinovirus in the baboon,
Papio cynocephalus, using the RV2 QPCR assay
To further determine the specificity of the RV2 QPCR
assay, DNA obtained from lymphocytes of baboon
Pcy78404 was tested for the presence of a related RV2
rhadinovirus species under the standard assay conditions.
Approximately 250 ng of lymphocyte DNA produced a
positive result with an average CT of 33.8 cycles. In order
to determine the identity of the reactive DNA species,
CODEHOP primers were used in a PCR reaction with the
baboon DNA as template as described in Materials and
Methods. A product was obtained that yielded an 834 bp
sequence which was 83% identical to the ORF59/60 intergenic region of each of the macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses,
RRV, MneRV2 and MfaRV2, and 58% identical to the corresponding region in both KSHV and RFHVMn. The
baboon sequence clustered with the macaque RV2 rhadinovirus sequences confirming its origin from an RV2
rhadinovirus of the baboon (Papio cynocephalus), herein
termed PcyRV2. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that
while PcyRV2 clustered within the RV2 rhadinovirus lineage, it branched off separately from the macaque RV2
rhadinoviruses as expected for a baboon rhadinovirus
(Fig. 1).

Comparison of the RV2 QPCR assay using different rhadinovirus templates diluted in genomic DNA
Comparison of the RV2 QPCR assay using different rhadinovirus templates diluted in genomic DNA. The
PcyRV2 results were obtained using 1 µg of spleen DNA from baboon, Pcy78404, naturally infected with PcyRV2. The other
rhadinovirus DNA templates were diluted in uninfected macaque genomic DNA to yield approximately equivalent CT values.
The MneRV2 results were obtained using DNA from purified MneRV2 in macaque genomic DNA. The RRV results were
obtained using DNA from spleen of MmuA01111, naturally infected with RRV. The MfaRV2 results were obtained using DNA
from spleen of Mfa95044, naturally infected with MfaRV2. The released reporter fluorophore is plotted as a function of the
amplification cycle number.

Previously, an RV2 rhadinovirus, PapRV2, was detected in
a baboon (Papio anubis) [27], and a partial sequence of the
DNA polymerase was obtained. In order to compare
PcyRV2 with PapRV2, we utilized CODEHOP PCR primers [7] to amplify a region of the polymerase gene of
PcyRV2 that could be compared to the sequence available
for PapRV2. DNA sequence for 352 bp of the DNA
polymerase gene was obtained. An alignment of this
sequence with the corresponding sequence of the PapRV2
rhadinovirus revealed a 97% sequence identity with 11
nucleotide differences which altered one amino acid.
Specificity of the RV2 QPCR assay
In order to compare the ability of the RV2 QPCR assay to
detect different rhadinovirus templates, test samples containing roughly equivalent viral copy numbers in a background of genomic DNA were prepared. DNA from

purified MneRV2, DNA from MmuA01111 spleen which
contains RRV, and DNA from Mfa95044 spleen which
contains MfaRV2 were diluted in DNA from a virus negative macaque to have approximately the same virus load
as that found in the baboon lymphocyte DNA containing
PcyRV2. As shown in Figure 6, all four samples have relatively similar levels of the different viruses, as indicated by
the similar CT values (30.3, MneRV2; 30.8, RRV; 31.6,
MfaRV2; and 33.2, PcyRV2). The cumulative fluorescence
curve for the MneRV2 and RRV samples were superimposable with slopes typical of those seen in the assays performed in Figures 4 and 5 which showed amplification
efficiencies of 100%. In contrast, both the M. fascicularis
and baboon templates produced fluorescence curves with
significantly decreased slopes, indicating lower amplification efficiencies. The efficiencies of these PCR reactions
were calculated to be approximately 81% (r2 = 0.900) for

macaques, the RV-2 assay result was low and outside the
linear range of the assay.

Discussion
The novel ORF 59/60 intergenic regions of MfaRV2 and
PcyRV2 were aligned with the corresponding sequences of
RRV, MneRV2, RFHVMn, and KSHV. Also aligned was a
partial sequence of the ORF 59/60 region obtained from
RFHVMm (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure 2, the MfaRV2 sequence contained single nucleotide
mismatches with the RV2a primer and RV2-FAM probe;
an exact match was seen with the RV2b primer. The
PcyRV2 sequence contained the same nucleotide mismatches seen in MfaRV2 and additionally had a second
nucleotide mismatch within both the RV2a primer and
the RV2-FAM probe. An additional mismatch was found
between the PcyRV2 sequence and the RV2b primer. These
nucleotide mismatches correlated with the decreased
amplification efficiency of the assay with this template, as
shown in Figure 6.
RV2 QPCR screen of the prevalence of RV2 rhadinoviruses
in macaques housed at the WaNPRC
DNA samples were obtained from PBMC of a random
assortment of thirty macaques housed at the WaNPRC
and analyzed using the standard RV2 and OSM QPCR
assays. While all of the samples were positive for the single
copy OSM gene, only six of the thirty macaques were
positive for the presence of an RV2 rhadinovirus. In all of
these six cases, both duplicate reactions in the assay were
positive yielding average viral loads of 6–2300 per 106

We have developed a TaqMan probe-based QPCR assay to
quantitate the viral load of macaque rhadinoviruses
belonging to the RV2 lineage of KSHV-like
rhadinoviruses. The primers and probe for this assay were
based on sequences within the 3' end of the ORF 60 coding sequence and the ORF 59/60 intergenic region which
were identical between the pig-tailed and rhesus macaque
rhadinoviruses, MneRV2 and RRV, respectively, but were
not conserved with the corresponding macaque viruses
from the RV1 lineage of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses RFHVMn and RFHVMm. We have also developed a TaqMan
probe-based QPCR assay targeting the single copy cellular
gene, OSM, to serve as an internal control for quantitating
cell copy number. Both assays were designed to give 100%
PCR efficiency at the same annealing temperature, are linear over more than 4 orders of magnitude and are sensitive enough to detect less than 20 copies of the DNA
target. The RV2 assay is able to accurately detect less than
66 copies of viral DNA in a genomic DNA background,
even when the viral load is as low as 1 copy per 2400 cells.
Quantitation of the cellular DNA and viral DNA copy
numbers in a tissue sample provides a suitable method for
comparing viral loads, even between samples of unknown
purity or degradation status. Because of the small size of
the amplicons for both assays, OSM (76 bp) and RV2 (71
bp), viral loads can even be determined in formalin-fixed

paraffin embedded tissue in which significant degradation of the DNA has occurred. Due to the similarities in
sequence of the human, macaque and African green monkey OSM genes, the OSM QPCR assay may be suitable for
quantitation of DNA in tissue from a number of other Old
World primate species.
We have screened DNA from a number of random PBMC
samples from macaques at the WaNPRC for the presence
of an RV2 rhadinovirus. We detected RV2 rhadinovirus
DNA in 6 of 30 macaques; 4 of 20 M. nemestrina, 1 of 7 M.
fascicularis and 1 of 2 macaques whose species is not
known. In these macaques, the viral copy number was
determined to range from 6–2300 per 106 cells. Although
the copy number in the single positive M. fascicularis was
calculated to be 250 viruses per 106 cells, this would be a
low estimate due to the 81% efficiency of the amplification of that template, as discussed above. Our results for
RV2 rhadinoviruses in the macaque species tested at the
WaNPRC were similar to those determined for RRV in
rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research
Center [18]. In the Tulane study, a QPCR assay developed
against the interleukin-6 homolog of RRV found infrequent and low levels of RRV in PBMC of healthy and SIVinfected rhesus macaques. Only two healthy macaques
had detectable RRV DNA with levels of 320 and 880
genomes per 106 cells. In the other 28 animals, the RRV
load was below the level of detection. While RRV was
detected more frequently in SIV-infected macaques in this
study, the virus load was similar to that seen in healthy
macaques.
The Tulane RRV assay had a similar sensitivity to our RV2
assay, with a lower limit of one RRV genome per 10,000
cell equivalents however, it was designed to specifically
target only RRV while our RV2 assay is capable of detecting RRV, MneRV2 and other macaque and baboon
rhadinoviruses. In this report, we have used the RV2 assay
to detect novel RV2 rhadinovirus homologs in both the
spleen of a crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and
the lymphocytes of a baboon (Papio cynocephalus). The
standard RV2 assay had an amplification efficiency less
than 100% with the M. fascicularis and P. cynocephalus
templates which cautions against its use for accurate
quantitation of the MfaRV2 and PcyRV2 rhadinoviruses.
The primer and probe binding regions of these two
rhadinoviruses showed nucleotide mismatches which correlate with the decrease amplification efficiency of the
assay.
We have shown that the RV2 QPCR assay is capable of
detecting a novel RV2 rhadinovirus, PcyRV2, in a baboon.
Previously, an RV2 rhadinovirus, PapRV2, was also
detected in baboons by others [27] using the degenerate
PCR primer approach targeting the DNA polymerase gene

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/2

that we had originally developed to detect novel herpesviruses [7]. In order to compare the two baboon viruses, we
have sequenced a region of the DNA polymerase gene of
PcyRV2. An alignment of this sequence with the
corresponding sequence of the PapRV2 rhadinovirus
revealed a 97% sequence identity with 11 nucleotide differences. This nucleotide similarity is consistent with the
origin of these two viruses from two related species of
baboons; the PcyRV2 rhadinovirus was isolated from the
baboon species Papio cynocephalus, while the PapRV2
rhadinovirus was isolated from the baboon species Papio
anubis.

Conclusions
In this report, we describe a QPCR assay which provides a
quick and sensitive method for screening RV2 rhadinoviruses found in the variety of non-human primate species
commonly found in the National primate centers. While
this assay broadly detects different RV2 rhadinoviruses
species, it is unreactive with several RV1 rhadinovirus
species. We also show that this QPCR assay can be used to
identify novel RV-2 rhadinoviruses in primates.

Methods and Materials
Animals
Fresh frozen spleen tissue samples from Macaca nemestrina (Mne) 442N were provided by R. Shibata while at the
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. This pigtailed macaque had been experimentally infected with a
pathogenic SHIV strain [28]. We have previously obtained
PCR evidence for the presence of both RV1 and RV2
macaque rhadinoviruses, RFHVMn and MneRV2,
respectively, in RF tumor and spleen tissue of this animal
[5]. Fresh frozen RF tumor tissue from Macaca mulatta
(Mmu) YN91-224, an SIV-infected rhesus macaque diagnosed with RF, was kindly provided by H. McClure, Yerkes
National Primate Research Center. Fresh frozen spleen tissue samples were also obtained from Macaca mulatta
(Mmu) A01111 at the WaNPRC, a rhesus macaque that
had been experimentally infected with SIV which we have
shown to be co-infected with the RV1 and RV2 macaque
rhadinoviruses, RFHVMm and RRV, respectively
(unpublished observations). Fresh frozen spleen tissue
from a Macaca fascicularis (Mfa) 95044 and lymphocytes
from a baboon (Papio cynocephalus) (Pcy78404) were
kindly provided by H. Bielefeldt-Ohmann and C.-C. Tsai,
respectively, from the WaNPRC. DNA from the PBMC of
thirty random healthy colony macaques was also
obtained from the virus screening program at the
WaNPRC.
Cells
The KSHV-infected pleural effusion lymphoma cell line,
BCBL-1, was obtained from D. Ganem (Howard Hughes
Institute – UCSF), and was carried in RPMI 1640 supple-

mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol. Rhesus
primary fetal fibroblasts (RPFF) were kindly provided by
Dr. Michael Axthelm (ONPRC).
Rhadinovirus
An isolate of MneRV2, was obtained from an M. nemestrina, MneJ97167, at the WaNPRC. The MneRV2 was used
to infect cultures of RPFF and viral particles were harvested from culture supernatent by high speed centrifugation. Viral DNA used as positive controls in the PCR assays
was obtained by disruption of the viral particles using
phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation.
DNA samples
DNA was extracted from frozen tissues using standard
proteinase K-phenol/chloroform extractions and concentrated by ethanol precipitation.
PCR amplification primers
The protein sequences of the ORF 59 and ORF 60 genes
from KSHV and RRV were aligned using ClustalW. The
consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer
(CODEHOP) technique [20,21] was used to design two
sets of degenerate PCR primers within both ORF 59 and
ORF 60 that would enable the amplification and sequence
analysis of the ORF 59/60 junctional region of novel RV1
and RV2 rhadinovirus species. The ORF 59 and ORF 60
genes are arranged in the same transcriptional orientiation in both RRV and KSHV. Two sense-strand CODEHOP
primers, RDELa and SRDEa contained nucleotides encoding the highly conserved amino acid motif, Arg-Asp-GluLeu (RDEL; 8 fold degenerate), in ORF 60. Primer RDELa
was biased toward the RV1 rhadinoviruses and contained
a 5' consensus region derived from the KSHV sequence
(Accession no. NC_003409). Primer SRDEa was biased
toward the RV2 rhadinoviruses and contained a 5' consensus region derived from the RRV sequence (Accession no.
AF210726). Two antisense-strand CODEHOP primers,
PQFVb and QFVRb contained all coding possibilities for
the highly conserved motif, Pro-Gln-Phe-Val (PQFV) in
ORF 59 (16 fold degenerate), and were biased to the
KSHV and RRV sequences, respectively (see Table 1). An
additional anti-sense strand CODEHOP primer, CFICb
(16 fold degenerate), was designed from a Cys-Phe-IleCys (CFIC) motif in the ORF 59 gene, downstream of the
PQFV motif and contained all coding possibilities for the
CFIC motif and was biased to RRV.
Amplification of the ORF 59/60 junctional region of novel
rhadinoviruses
To obtain the ORF 59/60 junctional regions between the
RDEL motif of ORF 60 and the PQFV motif of ORF 59 of
MneRV2, PcyRV2, RFHVMn, and RFHVMm, DNA was
obtained from different sources and used in PCR amplifi-

cation with different CODEHOP PCR primers. Reactions
were performed in 1 µM forward and reverse primers, 200
µM each dNTP, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl,
and 2.5 units Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using
a 55–70°C annealing temperature gradient (BioRad
Icycler). For MneRV2, PCR amplification was performed
on Mne442N spleen DNA using primers RDELa and
PQFVb. For PcyRV2, PCR amplification was performed on
lymphocyte DNA from baboon Pcy78404, using SRDEa
and QFVRb. In both cases an ~830 bp PCR fragment was
obtained and sequenced. To obtain the sequence of RFHVMn which had a low copy number, it was necessary to
amplify the RDEL-PQFV region in two fragments. A
CODEHOP primer NFFEa (See Table 1), downstream of
the RDEL motif was designed and used in conjunction
with PQFVb to amplify an ~600 bp product from the
Mne442N DNA. From the sequence of this product a specific primer, MPVDb, was derived and used in conjunction with RDELa to obtain an overlapping ~400 bp
product. A similar strategy was used with RF tumor DNA
obtained from MmuYN91-224 to obtain sequence from
the ORF 59/60 junctional region of RFHVMm, however,
only the sequence from NFFEA to PQFVB was obtained
for comparison purposes. The ORF 59/60 junctional
region of MfaRV2 was also obtained in two fragments. An
~400 bp PCR product was obtained after amplification of
spleen DNA from Mfa95044, using the RV2 QPCR assay
primer RV2b (see QPCR assay below and Table 1) and
CODEHOP primer RDELa. An overlapping ~1400 bp PCR
product was obtained using the RV2 QPCR assay primer,
RV2a, in conjunction with an additional CODEHOP
primer, CFICb.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using ClustalW and
analyzed using the DNA maximum-likelihood program
from the Phylip package, version 3.62 (University of
Washington, Seattle). Phylogenetic tree output was produced using TreeView.
Real-time QPCR design
The RV2 assay was designed to amplify a 71-bp amplicon
from the ORF 59/60 junctional region of macaque viruses
belonging to the RV2 rhadinovirus lineage using consensus primers "RV2a" (forward primer 5'-TCTGAATATGTCACATCCGTTCATA-3') and "RV2b" (reverse primer 5'GGCCCGGAAAATGAGTAACA-3') with a TaqMan probe
"RV2"
5'-(6-FAM)-TGATCTGTAGTCCCCATGTGTCC(BHQ-1)-3' (Table 1 and Figure 1). As an internal control
for cellular DNA which would allow the determination of
the viral copy number per cell, a QPCR assay was developed to detect exon 3 of oncostatin M (OSM), a single
copy cellular gene [Rose, 1993 #18]). The OSM assay
amplifies a 76-bp amplicon from the macaque OSM gene
using "OSMa" (forward primer 5'-CCTCGGGCTCAG-

GAACAAC-3') and "OSMb" (reverse primer 5'-GGCCTTCGTGGGCTCAG-3') with a TaqMan probe "OSM" 5'-(6FAM)-TACTGCATGGCCCAGCTGCTGGACAA-(BHQ-1)3' (Table 1 and Figure 2)
Reactions (50 µl) contained approximately 250–1000 ng
of template DNA, 1 µM forward and reverse primers, 100
nM probe, 200 µM each dNTP, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4),
50 mM KCl, and 2.5 units Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Magnesium chloride concentrations were 4.0
mM for the RV2 assay and 2.0 mM for the OSM assay.
After activation of the polymerase by incubation for 1
minute at 95°C, amplification was performed on a BioRad iCycler equipped with an optical module for 45 cycles
of 95°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s. The
copy number for each assay was calculated from the cycle
threshold (CT) determined using the Bio-Rad software.
The viral load was calculated as a cellular genome copy
equivalent by using the formula:
