DNA transposons and the role of recombination
in mutation accumulation in Daphnia pulex
Sarah Schaack1*, Eunjin Choi2, Michael Lynch2, Ellen J Pritham1

Abstract
Background: We identify DNA transposons from the completed draft genome sequence of Daphnia pulex,
a cyclically parthenogenetic, aquatic microcrustacean of the class Branchiopoda. In addition, we experimentally
quantify the abundance of six DNA transposon families in mutation-accumulation lines in which sex is either
promoted or prohibited in order to better understand the role of recombination in transposon proliferation.
Results: We identified 55 families belonging to 10 of the known superfamilies of DNA transposons in the genome
of D. pulex. DNA transposons constitute approximately 0.7% of the genome. We characterized each family and, in
many cases, identified elements capable of activity in the genome. Based on assays of six putatively active element
families in mutation-accumulation lines, we compared DNA transposon abundance in lines where sex was either
promoted or prohibited. We find the major difference in abundance in sexuals relative to asexuals in lab-reared
lines is explained by independent assortment of heterozygotes in lineages where sex has occurred.
Conclusions: Our examination of the duality of sex as a mechanism for both the spread and elimination of DNA
transposons in the genome reveals that independent assortment of chromosomes leads to significant copy loss in
lineages undergoing sex. Although this advantage may offset the so-called ‘two fold cost of sex’ in the short-term,
if insertions become homozygous at specific loci due to recombination, the advantage of sex may be decreased
over long time periods. Given these results, we discuss the potential effects of sex on the dynamics of DNA
transposons in natural populations of D. pulex.

Background
The role of recombination (hereafter used interchangeably with sex) in transposable element (TE) proliferation
has been of great interest for nearly three decades [1];
however, the question of whether or not sex leads to a
net increase or decrease in TE abundance over time persists. Generally, a switch to asexuality is thought to
eliminate the possibility of reconstructing the leastloaded class via recombination, and thus to irreversibly
larger mutation loads (that is, Muller’s ratchet [2,3]). In
the special case of TEs, however, sex can result in an
increased rate of both gain and loss, thereby complicating the predictions of the net effects of reproductive
strategy over long time periods. This is because,
although there are several mechanisms of gain and loss
that do not differ between sexuals and asexuals, only
sexuals undergo meiosis. Furthermore, the two main

components of meiosis (crossover - ectopic and homologous - and independent assortment) both impact the
rate at which new copies are propagated or purged from
the genome (for example, [4]).
Previous studies have looked at the accumulation of
TEs in selection lines, natural populations, or sister taxa
in which outcrossing and inbreeding are used as proxies
for high and low recombination, respectively [5-8].
Although these studies provide insight into TE behavior
under certain circumstances, none allow for a comparison of TE behavior in sexual versus asexual backgrounds without introducing confounding variables (for
example, selection, genetic variation, or species differences). Other studies have considered the relationship
between local recombination rate and TE abundance in
sexually reproducing organisms (for example, [9,10]),
but these data do not provide insight into the consequences of a complete switch between sexual versus
asexual reproduction. Cyclical parthenogenesis offers an
ideal system to address the role of recombination in TE

proliferation because sexuals and asexuals can be compared directly and the results can be generalized to help
elucidate the maintenance of sex, as well as the repeated
evolution of asexuality as a strategy within otherwise
sexual clades.
Daphnia pulex is an aquatic microcrustacean found
mainly in freshwater habitats throughout North America
(class Branchiopoda, order Cladocera). Like other closely
related taxa in this clade, most D. pulex are cyclical
parthenogens: a reproductive strategy composed primarily
of asexual reproduction with a seasonal switch to sex that
produces hardy, diapausing eggs prior to the onset of winter. These meiotically produced eggs are encased in ephippia that hatch in response to seasonal cues, such as
changes in day length and temperature. Newly hatched
offspring develop and reproduce via asexual reproduction
until environmental conditions change the following year.
D. pulex is the first crustacean and first cyclical parthenogen for which whole genome sequence data are available.
In order to examine TE proliferation in this species,
we surveyed the genome of D. pulex for DNA transposons (Class 2). Autonomous transposons encode a transposase and mobilize using a cut-and-paste mechanism
of replication, which typically involves excision, transposition of a DNA intermediate, and integration into a
new site in the genome (subclass 1) [11]. The mechanism of replication for the more recently discovered subclass 2 elements (Helitrons and Mavericks), however, is
not known (see [12] for review). Although, DNA transposons are generally not thought to exhibit replicative
gains when mobilized, for members of subclass 1, copy
number can increase due to homologue-dependent
DNA repair after excision at homozygous loci, which
can result in the reconstitution of a TE in the donor
location and, therefore, replicative gain. Class 1 elements
(copy-and-paste retrotransposons) include a more
diverse array of mechanisms of replication but, generally, do not excise, and the successful reintegration of
the RNA intermediate typically results in a net increase
in TE abundance, regardless of whether the mobilized
element is homozygous or heterozygous. These and
other differences may impact patterns of TE spread for
the two major classes, thus we restrict our survey here
to those belonging to Class 2, but including both autonomous and non-autonomous families and representatives of the recently discovered Helitron subclass.
Using representatives of several TE superfamilies identified in our survey of the genome, we assayed six
families of DNA transposons in mutation-accumulation
(MA) lineages of D. pulex in which sex was either promoted or prohibited. Based on the factors influencing
DNA transposon dynamics in sexuals versus asexuals,
we predicted lab-reared lineages undergoing sex would
exhibit both higher rates of both DNA transposon gain

and loss than their asexual counterparts. We describe
the general landscape of DNA transposons in D. pulex,
survey the relative abundance of each TE family in MA
lines with and without sex, and discuss the implications
of the patterns observed for the role of DNA transposons in shaping the genomes of species with multiple
reproductive strategies over longer time periods.

Results
DNA transposons in D. pulex

Using a combination of homology-based and structural
search strategies (see Materials and methods), we discovered new elements belonging to nine superfamilies
of DNA transposons in D. pulex, the first cyclical
parthenogen and microcrustacean for which the whole
genome sequence is available (Table 1; Table S1 in
Additional file 1). In addition to the previously characterized PiggyBac transposon family, Pokey [13,14], we
found 56 families representing a total of 10 superfamilies in the whole genome sequence (approximately
8× coverage; see Additional file 2 for Supplemental
Dataset S1 containing FASTA files of all canonical
representatives available and locations on scaffolds available in Table S4). Membership of each complete TE
identified to a given superfamily was validated by verifying the presence of the structural characteristic features
of that superfamily [12]. Alignments showing homologous regions of one or more representative(s) of each
major group found in D. pulex with those from various
taxa reveal conserved motifs in protein-coding regions
(Additional file 3a-j), such as those with predicted catalytic function (for example, hAT, PIF/Harbinger, Merlin,
P, and Tc1/mariner [15-18]) or polymerase activity (for
example, Maverick [19]). The Mutator superfamily
representatives in the D. pulex genome all shared high
levels of similarity with a recently discovered subgroup
called Phantom [20]; Additional file 3f). In addition to
homologous proteins, superfamily identity was determined by structural motifs such as, in the case of
CACTA elements, terminal inverted repeats (Figure 1)
[21] and, in the case of Helitrons, palindromes and the
identification of tandem arrays of elements (Figure 2)
[22], which is characteristic of this group.
Mutation-accumulation experiment

To assess the relative abundance and behavior of DNA
transposons in D. pulex, representatives from five of the
nine recently identified TE superfamilies and the previously identified PiggyBac family, Pokey, were surveyed
in the MA lineages. Families were chosen based on
sequence data indicative of potentially recent activity
(for example, intact ORFs and between element alignments). Single-copy families or families for which no
variation was detected (presence-absence among a

their homology to other known DNA transposon
families in other species (Tc1A1.1, Tc1NA2.1, Helidaph
NA1.1, Helidaph NA2.1, hATA1.1), as well as Pokey,
were surveyed across lab-reared lineages using transposon display (TD; see Materials and methods). These
lineages had undergone approximately 40 generations of
mutation accumulation (see Additional file 4 for the

number of generations for each lineage individually)
during which they experienced minimal selection and
were propagated exclusively via asexual reproduction.
Environmental cues were used to induce sexual reproduction (selfing), which, when it occurred, generated
sexual sublines that experienced at least one bout of sex
but were otherwise treated the same (hereafter treatments referred to as asexuals and sexuals, respectively;
see Materials and methods).

The number of loci occupied by DNA transposons
was assayed using TD after approximately 40 generations of mutation accumulation and rates of both loss
and gain were calculated and compared between sexuals
and asexuals. Rates of loss (per element per generation)
were much higher than rates of gain (Table 2) but were
almost completely restricted to lineages that had undergone at least one bout of sexual reproduction (Figure 3;
Additional file 4). For each family, element loss was not
random among occupied loci, but instead was usually
observed at a subset of specific loci across all lines (Figure3), suggesting that these sites were heterozygous in
the ancestor used to start the experiment and that losses
represent the segregation of heterozygotic copies after

meiosis (Figure 4). Independent assortment among chromosomes during selfing (as seen here) would result in a
25% chance of loss of a heterozygotic TE and even
higher rates of loss when outcrossing. Concurrently,
redistribution of heterozygous copies after sex would
result in homozygosity 25% of the time in the case of
selfing, which would dramatically reduce the risk of
future loss because of homologue-dependent DNA
repair. The frequency of loss at designated ‘high-loss
loci’ (where an ancestrally occupied site demonstrates a
loss in more than three lineages) among sexual lines
conformed well to predictions of approximately 25%
chance of loss based on independent assortment in all
families of DNA transposons assayed (Figure 5). The

three families in which the number of losses at these
loci occasionally exceeded expectations based on independent assortment alone (Tc1A1.1, Tc1NA2.1, and
Pokey) are also the families for which loss was observed
in asexual lineages (Table 2). This indicates the number
of losses observed among sexual lines for these three
families may represent a combination of both local

removal (excision, mitotic recombination, or deletion)
and chromosomal loss (via independent assortment).
In order to compare rates of loss with those reported
previously in the literature, it is important to exclude
sexual lines where estimates are conflated by the dramatic loss due to independent assortment. Losses
observed in asexual lineages are not only attributable to
excision, however, and could be alternatively explained
by random spatial processes, such as deletion or mitotic
recombination (known to occur in D. pulex [23]). These
alternatives seem unlikely, however, because losses
among asexuals were observed only for three DNA
transposon families, and these same families also had
rates of loss in sexuals in excess of the predictions
based on independent assortment. Regardless of the
mechanism of local loss, the rates calculated for asexuals
(that is, excluding the impact of independent assortment) are on par with those previously reported in the
literature (approximately 10-5 and 10-6 [24,25]).
Across the six element families, there was only evidence for one potential germline gain of a DNA transposon and it was observed in the hATA1.1 family. This
new peak was robust and was observed in five separate
TD replicates (Figures S4 and S5 in Additional files 5
and 6, respectively), and was not accompanied by a loss
of another peak (which could be an indication of a
simple mutation at the downstream restriction site).
One germline gain among all lineages surveyed yields
an estimate of the transposition rate for this family of
9.8 × 10 -5 per element per generation (lower than

Schaack et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R46
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R46

previously reported rates of approximately 10 -4 based
only on a single observation; reviewed in [24,25]).
Although we cannot conclude whether rates of transposition differ with and without sex, this gain suggests
hAT elements in D. pulex are actively transposing.
In addition to this potential germline gain, TD
revealed many new, robust peaks that could not be
replicated in every reaction. Because these peaks were
above thresholds for inclusion, but were not observed
consistently, they were scored as new putative somatic
insertions (Additional file 6). Somatic transposition is
known to occur in many systems (for example, [26-28]),
although theory suggests it would be selected against
over time because it carries phenotypic negative costs
with no heritable gains for the TE. There was no difference between sexual and asexual lineages in the rate of
gain of putative somatic copies for four families, but in
Tc1A1.1 and Helidaph NA1.1 (among the largest
families), rates per element were higher in asexuals than
in lineages where sex had occurred (Supplemental Table
S2 in Additional file 1). Although one can envision a
scenario where, over time, asexual lineages may accumulate mutations inactivating loci responsible for suppression of somatic activity, it seems unlikely to have
occurred on the timescale of this experiment. Across
families, there is a striking negative correlation between
the rate of putative somatic transposition per copy and
TE family size (Figure 6; regression for pooled treatments, R2 = 0.66, df = 1, F = 19.38, and P = 0.001). This
relationship could be explained if larger families have
co-evolved with the host genome for a longer period of
time, and therefore are subject to an increased level of
silencing from the host, thereby reducing somatic activity. Alternatively, high copy number families may simply

decreases with ancestral copy number for each DNA
transposon family surveyed (lines indicate a best fit for each
treatment; sample sizes for each family presented in Table 2).

be composed of more inactive copies, resulting in the
appearance of lower somatic activity per copy.

Discussion
TE composition and potential for activity

We found representative elements from the ten currently recognized Class 2 superfamilies in the genome of
D. pulex. The proportion of the genome composed of
DNA transposons, 0.72%, is within the range of most
other arthropods for which such data exist (for example,
the Drosophila melanogaster genome is composed of
0.31% DNA transposons [29] and that of Apis mellifera
is 1% DNA transposons [30]). Based on four lines of evidence, it appears that the families assayed here are currently active in the genome of D. pulex. First, based on
the structure of the elements (intact ORFs, where
applicable, and percent identity between copies) there is
sequence evidence indicating the elements have been
active relatively recently and may be capable of further
mobilization. Second, there is evidence for a germline
gain of a copy of a hAT element that suggests this
family is actively transposing in D. pulex. Third, evidence for possible excision was found for three of the
six families based on the observed loss of copies in
purely asexual lineages (Tc1A1.1, Tc1NA2.1, and Pokey)
and an excess of loss in sexuals above that which would
be predicted by independent assortment alone. Fourth,
the observation of putative somatic insertions in all six
families suggests these families are capable of activity
and could mobilize in the germline as well.
The role of recombination in long-term TE dynamics

The dynamics observed in lineages where sex was either
prohibited or promoted supports the prediction that
reproductive mode does, in fact, strongly influence patterns of TE proliferation in the genome. The major
source of these differences in DNA transposon abundance appears to be the large impact of independent
assortment of chromosomes on heterozygous loci. The
observation of losses at or near the levels predicted by
independent assortment during selfing (approximately
25%) not only means that this mechanism can hasten
the loss of heterozygous DNA transposon copies, but
simultaneously suggests an increased rate of homozygosity (also approximately 25%) at these loci as well. This
elevated risk of homozygosity in sexuals has two major
consequences. The first is the potentially large phenotypic impact resulting from the unmasking of recessive,
negative effects of the DNA transposon once the insert
is present at the same locus on both chromosomes. The
second is the dramatic reduction in the probability of
future loss of the DNA transposon at this particular
locus once it occupies the site on both homologues,
even if it does not have large phenotypic effects in the

Schaack et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R46
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R46

homozygous state. Homozygosity eliminates the chance
of loss by mitotic recombination and reduces the chance
of loss by excision because both homologs harbor the
DNA transposon copy. Even if one copy is excised,
homologue-dependent DNA repair can result in its
reconstitution because the existing copy is used as a
template to repair the site after removal [31]. Because
DNA repair is typically imperfect, it is possible that the
reconstituted copy will not be full length, although it
may still be capable of transposition.
The chance of a heterozygous insertion becoming
homozygous via sex decreases when effective population size is large. Despite the likelihood of large global
effective population size for Daphnia, the probability
of an insertion becoming homozygous in a given generation could be significant given the habitat for D.
pulex is typically small, ephemeral ponds. It has been
suggested previously that avoiding the risk of homozygosity of deleterious mutations may explain the
repeated success of asexuals in nature [32]. Whereas
any new insertions in a sexually recombining genome
can become homozygous, asexuals carry only the
homozygous insertions they inherited from their sexual
progenitor (the so-called ‘lethal hangover’ from sex
[33]). Populations found in nature may represent those
isolates descended from sexual progenitors with particularly low mutation loads (but see [34]). These asexual lineages may be quite competitive with sexuals not
only because they avoid many of the classic costs associated with sex, but also because they have a reduced
risk of future homozygosity at mutated loci, such as
those where TEs have inserted. The benefits (and
risks) of genetic segregation and recombination during
sex can be mimicked in asexuals via mitotic recombination [35], although the frequency of mitotic recombination in Daphnia (shown in both sexuals and
asexuals [23]) should be lower than the frequency of
meiotic recombination. Although occasional sex is the
norm in D. pulex, populations where it has been lost
have been recorded frequently [36]. Over long time
periods, the impact of independent assortment on new
heterozygous copies clearly could result in considerably
different distributions and abundance of TEs in sexuals
versus asexuals. Because obligately asexual D. pulex
populations occur naturally, it is possible to further
investigate the mutational consequences of switching
reproductive modes and therefore the evolution of sex
based on TE accumulation in this species at the population level. Such analyses have been performed and
suggest that, despite the short-term advantage
observed here, cyclical parthenogens in nature accumulate more TEs than their asexual counterparts
[37,38].

Conclusions
The aim of this study was to characterize DNA transposons and their dynamics across families in the cyclical
parthenogen D. pulex. The variation among DNA transposon families in abundance reveals patterns of proliferation do not appear to correlate strongly with
phylogenetic relatedness among TEs (for example,
families within the same superfamily do not necessarily
behave similarly), but instead suggest other factors, such
as copy number, may play a role. Differences between
lineages where sex was prohibited or promoted indicate
that recombination has significant effects on TE
dynamics, most notably via the redistribution of copies
due to independent assortment. Whether or not sex
influences rates of excision or germline transposition
rate remains an open question and would require a
longer period of mutation accumulation to detect. This
analysis represents the first multi-element comparison
in a cyclical parthenogen and crustacean and suggests
TE dynamics in this species vary based on family size
and may be significantly impacted by differences in
reproductive mode. Our data suggest there may be significant consequences in terms of TE abundance and
distribution over long time periods in natural populations capable of reproducing with and without sex.
Materials and methods
Transposable element identification

The v1.1 draft genome sequence assembly of D. pulex
was scanned for protein coding TEs using a homologybased approach. Queries representing the most wellconserved region of the encoded proteins of all known
eukaryotic Class 2 DNA transposons were used in
TBLASTN searches of the pre-release genome. Contigs
identified containing sequences with homology (e-values
< 0.01) to known TE proteins were scanned for signature structural characteristics (for example, target site
duplications and terminal inverted repeats). Conceptual
translations were performed with the ExPASy translation program [39,40] and NCBI ORF Finder [41]. Alignments of DNA transposon proteins with representative
known TE proteins were constructed using a combination of ClustalW embedded in MEGA 4.0 [42], BLASTN
[43], and MUSCLE [44]. Canonical elements were used
to mask the genome (using RepeatMasker [45]) and
copy number and genome content estimates were compiled based on these and local BLAST results using
default parameters. Repeats were filtered to include only
those with a minimum length of 50 bp, >20% of the
length of the query, and >70% similarity between query
and hit to compile data for Table 1. DNA transposons
containing full-length ORFs (within the published standard range, intact target site duplications, or other

evidence of potential recent activity) were assayed
experimentally (see below). Families that amplified and
appeared variable among a subset of lineages (that is,
showed evidence for presence-absence polymorphism
after approximately 20 generations in a subset of MA
lines) were selected for the survey.
Mutation-accumulation experiment

MA lines were initiated in 2004 from the sequenced isolate of D. pulex dubbed The Chosen One (TCO). TCO
was collected from Slimy Log Pond, OR in 2000 and
maintained in the laboratory until initiation of the
experiment. Third-generation descendants of a single
female were used to initiate experimental lines, which
were clonally propagated each generation soon after first
clutch was produced by the focal female in each line,
each generation (generation times were approximately
12 days at 20°C). Lines were maintained at constant
temperature (20°C) and fed Scenedesmus obliquus three
times per week. When focal animals were dead or sterile, a back-up system was used to propagate the line.
The back-up system consisted of simultaneously isolating two sibling animals during each transfer. These animals were stored in 50 ml uncapped plastic tubes and
fed and maintained in the same manner as the focal
individuals. Isolating these individuals in parallel allowed
us to rescue a line if the focal individual died. In
extreme, rare cases, where both the focal individual and
the back-up individuals were dead, the line was propagated from beakers of animals from previous generations of the lineage also maintained in the lab (at 10°C)
by selecting a random individual to bottle-neck the
population and continue the line.
All lines were propagated by transferring either one or
five (alternating each generation) random 1- to 2-dayold live female offspring to a new beaker. Females produced one to two clutches of asexual offspring, which
were used to propagate each line each generation. The
subsequent crowding was used to generate cues inducing meiosis, after which females produced male offspring and then haploid resting eggs, which were
fertilized when the females mated with their sons. These
eggs were collected and stored in tissue culture plates
with 5 to 10 ml H20 per well at 4°C. This occurred typically 4 to 5 days after asexually produced young had
been born and transferred to a new beaker to propagate
the original asexual line. Any ephippia that hatched
after exposing eggs to short, intermittent periods of warmer temperatures (20°C) were used to initiate sexual
sublines of asexual lineages. Sexual sublines (identified
by their source asexual lineage and the generation at
which the bout of sexual reproduction had occurred)
were occasionally induced to reproduce sexually a second time, although only three such lineages were

Page 10 of 13

included in this survey. Other than hatching (and the
conditions immediately preceding hatching), sexual sublines were maintained in the same manner over the
course of the experiment as asexuals. The total number
of lines used in the assay was 94, with 47 ‘asexual’ lines
being propagated exclusively asexually for the duration
of the experiment compared to an additional 47 ‘sexual’
lines that were maintained in the same way, but with
the occurrence of at least one bout of sex.
Tissue for transposon display was collected after
approximately 40 generations and was extracted from 5
to 10 individuals (clonally produced sisters) for each
lineage individually. Genomic DNA was extracted by
grinding adult tissue in a CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) buffer [46] and incubating at 65°C for
1 h. Samples were extracted with a chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol solution (1:24) and the DNA was precipitated
and washed using 100% and 70% ethanol solutions,
respectively. The DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of
ddH2O and used for subsequent reactions.
Transposon display

TD is a PCR-based technique developed by the Daphnia
Genomics Consortium [45] to estimate the number of
TE insertion sites per genome for a given family of elements. TD was performed by using the restriction
enzyme EcoR1 to digest genomic DNA from each sample (n = 94; 5 μl template DNA (ranging from approximately 40 to 80 ng/μl), 30 μl H 2O, 4 μl manufacturer
supplied buffer; 0.5 μl EcoR1). Typically, TD is conducted using a 4-bp cutter but our preliminary results
indicated the restriction-ligation reaction worked best
with EcoR1. Given that our ability to detect fragments is
improved by the use of fragment analysis technology
and software (described below) and a longer calibration
ladder than previous studies (1,200 bp versus 500 bp
[37]), we used this digest even though it would
undoubtedly result in a longer average fragment length.
Digests were performed for 6 h at 37°C followed by 22
minutes at 80°C. Adaptors consisting of approximately
20 bp oligonucleotide pairs with a non-complementary
mid-portion were ligated on to the ends of each fragment after the digest (7.5 μl H 2 O, 0.5 T4 ligase, 1 μl
manufacturer supplied buffer, 1 μl adaptor (50 mM)
added to each restriction digest reaction; 16 h ligation at
room temperature). Element-containing fragments were
amplified via nested PCR using a fluorescent elementspecific primer (forward) and a reverse primer complementary to the non-complementary mid-portion of the
ligated adaptors (Supplemental Table S3 in Additional
file 1). Only fragments of the genome containing copies
of the element being assayed are amplified because the
reverse primer cannot anneal unless the element-specific
primer binds and elongates and only TE-bearing

Schaack et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R46
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R46

fragments are scored because only the TE-specific primer is fluorescently labeled. Conditions for the first and
second round of PCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 minutes, followed by 24 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 5°C below
the melting temperature for the element-specific primer
(30 s), and elongation at 72°C for 1 minute, ending with
a 5-minute elongation step at 72°C. The second round
of PCR used a fluorescently labeled (6FAM) elementspecific primer slightly more towards the 3’ end of the
conserved region of the element and the same thermocycler program.
Fragments resulting from the nested PCR were run
out on an ABI 3730 Genotyper and analyzed using Genemapper with the LIZ 1200 size standard. All samples
were run in triplicate and data were scored manually.
Because all lines were initiated from a single common
ancestor, differences in banding pattern among descendent lineages indicated loss and/or gain of copies of
individual elements within the genome. Losses were
scored based on the absence of bands at locations
where, in the majority of the samples, peaks were typically found. Gains were only considered germline gains
if new peaks were present in all three replicates. New
peaks that were above threshold levels but not present
in all three replicates tended to be lower height, but still
robust (Additional file 6), and were scored as putative
somatic insertions. This technique is sensitive but provides a lower-bound estimate for activity levels because
long fragments may not amplify due to PCR bias and
because of the conservative nature of the scoring regimen. In order to verify that fragments amplified using
transposon display indeed represented the 3’ end of the
specific TE family for which the primer was designed,
additional PCR reactions were performed using nonfluorescent element-specific primers under the same
conditions. These fragments were cloned using the Invitrogen TOPO PCR cloning kit™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Cloned fragments were PCR amplified using the reverse
primer from the initial secondary PCR reaction (complementary to the adaptor) and the successful amplicons
were sequenced using ABI’s BigDye™ sequencing mix
(1.4 μl template PCR product, 0.4 μl BigDye, 2 μl manufacturer supplied buffer, 0.3 μl reverse primer, 6 μl H2O;
thermocycler program starting with 2 minutes denaturation (96°C) followed by 30 cycles alternating between
96°C (30 s) and 60°C (4 minutes), and cool down at 10°
C for 3 minutes). Sequencing reactions were run on an
ABI 3730 and sequences were trimmed using CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA,
USA) and were aligned and analyzed using MEGA 4.0
[42]. Cloning and sequencing of fragments from TD
reactions revealed that all PCR amplicons do, indeed,

Page 11 of 13

represent fragments containing the 3’ end of the TE
family from which the primer was designed, although it
is truncated in some cases (data not shown). Not
enough clones were sequenced to represent all the
inserts detected using TD and putative somatic insertions are swamped by germline copies. Sequenced
clones, however, represent a number of independent
insertions for each family of elements assayed and the
amplification and sequencing process enriches for fragments for which the primer has high affinity, not spurious PCR artifacts that may occasionally occur. The
scoring criteria used for TD was conservative (see Additional file 4s for rubric).
Data analysis

A limitation of the TD technique is its inability to distinguish between loci that are heterozygous or homozygous for a given insertion. Insertions that appeared in
the same location on the trace file in multiple lineages
are presumed to be ancestral (that is, they were present
in the single individual ancestor to the experimental
lines, and may only be lost over time, not gained). In
addition, because of the pattern revealed in lines in
which sex had occurred, it was possible to detect sites
that were likely heterozygous in the ancestor based on
high rates of loss. The insertion profiles generated for
each MA line (presence-absence matrices for each TE
family) were analyzed by calculating the mean corrected
rates of loss based on the number of losses per lineage
per generation per ancestral element copy. Rates of
putative somatic gain were calculated by dividing the
number of new, non-replicable peaks by the number of
ancestral peaks. Mean rates were compared between
treatments (sexuals and asexuals) within each element
family using a t-test and across families using analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) with ancestral copy number as a
covariate, and across families using regression.

based on TBLASTN for each DNA transposon family identified in the

Additional file 5: Trace file from transposon display reactions showing
evidence for a putative germline gain of a copy of the hATA1.1 element.
The top four traces show separate runs for the sample, indicating a new,
replicable peak is found at 385 bp (red box). A putative somatic insertion
is also visible in the top trace file (at 436 bp; blue box) where a new
peak was observed in only this replicate. The bottom two traces are from
another line and represent the ancestral state for the lineages lacking
these new copies.
Additional file 6: Peak heights for transposon display performed for
hATA1.1 using MA lines of D. pulex. All peaks were above minimum
thresholds for inclusion (see Additional file 4). Peaks were scored based
on replicability as a: 1, ancestral insertion (common across lineages and
replicable within a lineage); 2, new germline insertion (found only in one
lineage, replicable in all TD reactions); or 3, putative somatic insertion
(unique to one lineage and not replicable in three TD reactions). Peak
heights are based on heights scored by Genemapper software for each
of three TD replicate reactions performed for each lineage, with the
heights for the new germline insertion shown in pink (described in
Additional file 5). Lines represent a best fit for each group.
