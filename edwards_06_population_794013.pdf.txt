Abstract
Background: Genetic diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population
within an individual is lost during transmission to a new host. The demography of transmission is
an important determinant of evolutionary dynamics, particularly the relative impact of natural
selection and genetic drift immediately following HIV-1 infection. Despite this, the magnitude of this
population bottleneck is unclear.
Results: We use coalescent methods to quantify the bottleneck in a single case of homosexual
transmission and find that over 99% of the env and gag diversity present in the donor is lost. This
was consistent with the diversity present at seroconversion in nine other horizontally infected
individuals. Furthermore, we estimated viral diversity at birth in 27 infants infected through vertical
transmission and found there to be no difference between the two modes of transmission.
Conclusion: Assuming the bottleneck at transmission is selectively neutral, such a severe
reduction in genetic diversity has important implications for adaptation in HIV-1, since beneficial
mutations have a reduced chance of transmission.

Background
The size of the inoculum that initiates infection in HIV-1
is unknown, although the loss of diversity is thought to be
substantial following both horizontal [1-7] and vertical
[8,9] transmission. If the bottleneck is selectively neutral,
genetic drift will occur because only a small number of

variants are chosen at random from the population to
propagate the new infection. The smaller the amount of
genetic diversity transmitted the greater the magnitude of
drift, lowering the probability that adaptive changes that
emerge within hosts will survive transmission.

In RNA viruses with a high deleterious mutation rate the
majority of variants exhibit a replicative capacity lower
than the mean [10-12]. Because the fittest variants may
only be present at a low frequency, they are susceptible to
random loss. Hence when genetic drift is strong, deleterious mutations may accumulate, leading to an irreversible
decline in population fitness [13]. Although the high rate
of recombination in HIV-1 in vivo [14-16] has the potential to rescue debilitated haplotypes [13], if a new infection is initiated by only one or a few viral particles, and if
these are chosen at random from the parent population,
then the transmission of HIV-1 will likely incur a substan-

tial reduction in fitness [17-21]. As the inoculum size
increases, potential fitness losses are rapidly reduced
[22,23].
Conversely, natural selection may lower the susceptibility
of HIV-1 to reductions of fitness associated with transmission. In acutely infected HIV-1 patients, the usually
diverse envelope V3 region is more homogeneous than
gag p17, whereas in chronic infection the opposite is true
[6,7]. Positive selection operating on envelope during
transmission has been invoked as an explanation [6,7]. If
selection operates to influence which variants are trans-

Herein we estimate, using population genetic techniques,
the proportion of genetic diversity that survives transmission in a single homosexual transmitter pair, with samples
available before and after the transmission event. The
demographic history of the virus population in both
donor and recipient was reconstructed using coalescent
methodology, allowing quantification of the diversity
present close to the time of infection. The coalescent was
implemented within a Bayesian framework, which enabled co-estimation of substitution and demographic
parameters using serially sampled sequences [24-26].
Through a comparison of different regions of the genome
(namely env V1-V4 and gag p24) we also investigate
whether selection is likely to be acting during HIV-1 transmission. Finally, we generalise our result by estimating
the diversity present close to the time of infection in nine
homosexual seroconverters for which donor sequences
were unavailable, and compare horizontal and vertical
modes of transmission using 27 infants infected at birth.

Results
To directly visualise the change in genetic diversity during
horizontal HIV-1 transmission between the donor-recipient pair studied, we first inferred the phylogenetic relationships among their HIV-1 sequences using maximum
likelihood methods. The phylogenies for env V1-V4 and
gag p24 depicted in Figure 1 show that branch lengths are
substantially shortened immediately after transmission,
illustrating that a significant reduction in diversity has
occurred.

To investigate the demographics of viral transmission in
this transmitter pair more closely, four coalescent models
were fitted to the sequence data. Crucially, samples were
available both before and after the transmission event
allowing distinct demographic functions for donor and
recipient HIV-1 populations (Equations 1 to 5), with the
time of transition between them estimated from the data
[26]. In addition to a null model that constrained the
effective population size in donor (ND) and recipient (NR)
to be identical (so that there is no bottleneck at transmission), models with constant, exponential and logistic
demographic functions for the recipient population were
fitted. In all cases the donor population size was assumed
to be constant.
The relative Bayesian posterior scores for each demographic model are listed in Table 1. For both env V1-V4
and gag p24, the model with the lowest AIC (the preferred
model) fits a constant population size in the donor and
logistic growth in the recipient (Equations 4 and 5). The
null hypothesis that there has been no change in population size at transmission was therefore rejected. Using the
estimated model parameters we reconstructed the demographic profiles of genetic diversity (NÏ, the product of the
effective population size and generation length in days
[27]) against time for each gene (Figure 2).
To further test the extent of the transmission bottleneck,
the demographic history of the population was reconstructed using the Bayesian skyline plot [see Methods,
[28]]. The results for env V1-V4 and gag p24 are shown in
Figure 2. In both cases there is a good fit between the
demographic profiles estimated using the two different
methods. Noticeably, the timing of the transmission bot-

tleneck is the same, and evidence for a bottleneck is readily apparent under both models.
The Bayesian skyline plot also justifies our use of the logistic-constant demographic model to estimate the diversity
that survives during horizontal transmission of HIV-1.
Using the logistic growth model (Equations 4 and 5) we
were able to calculate diversity in the recipient NRÏ at the
estimated time of transmission ttrans. We estimated ttrans to
be approximately 30 days prior to collection of the first
recipient sample (day 0) for env and 40 days for gag (Table
2). We calculated NRÏ(ttrans) to be 1.6 for env V1-V4, and
2.0 for gag p24 (Table 2). These values are near the lower
prior boundary of one and their posterior distributions
both exhibit a large positive skew (Figure 3). The level of
diversity in the donor at the time of transmission NDÏ was
compared with that which was transmitted NRÏ(ttrans) as a
percentage ratio Î´. For env, NDÏ was estimated to be 1014,
giving a value of Î´ as 0.17%. For gag p24, NDÏ was 771,
giving Î´ as 0.29% (Table 2).
Importantly, if selection was acting on env to restrict the
proportion of variants capable of establishing a new infection, we would expect a greater loss of diversity in this
region when compared to gag, assuming recombination
between the two regions. Therefore, the similarity in Î´
between env and gag argues against strong selection at
transmission.
We conclude that > 99% of genetic diversity in the donor
viral population, in both env and gag, was lost during this
case of horizontal transmission. A reduction in viral diversity after horizontal transmission has been reported fre-

quently in the literature [1,3-6]. However, information
regarding the diversity present in the donor is often lacking, and even in cases where this data exists [2,7] it is difficult to measure levels of diversity close to the
transmission event. The method implemented here overcomes this problem, estimating genetic diversity at the
inferred time of transmission, and therefore allows accurate quantification of the transmission bottleneck.
To generalise this result we next investigated diversity
(NÏ) of the founding viral population in nine patients
infected through homosexual contact for which donor
sequences were unavailable. Sequences had been published previously [29]. Assuming the best-fit demographic
model, NÏ at seroconversion was found to vary between
around 1720 and 8 (mean: 406; Table 3). In the recipient
of the transmitter pair, NÏ at seroconversion (day 0) was
1150 (HPD upper: 1930), which is not significantly different (p = 0.302; one-sample t-test).
Finally, to compare the diversity present close to the time
of infection in patients infected via two different modes of
transmission, we estimated NÏ at birth (transmission) in
27 vertically infected infants. The average NÏ at birth was
696 (Table 3). Although we were unable to detect a bottleneck at transmission in eight of the infants (p2, p3, p6, p8,
pa, pd, pc and pd), the estimates for NÏ close to the time
of infection in the horizontally and vertically infected
patient groups were not significantly different (p = 0.320;
two-sample t-test).

Indeed, it has been shown experimentally that a random
population bottleneck of a single clone can have severe
consequences for the replicative fitness of HIV-1 [21]. Furthermore, by lowering their chances of transmission,
genetic drift has the potential to prevent the accumulation
of advantageous changes at the population level, thereby
impeding the long-term adaptation of HIV-1 [31].

minimum bound of one.

Discussion
From our analysis of a single donor and recipient transmission pair, we conclude that in this case the viral diversity sampled during homosexual transmission of HIV-1
was very small (< 1%). This result was consistent for both
env and gag. Interpretation of our finding is dependent on
whether transmission is considered a neutral or selective
process. In particular, if transmission is neutral it can be
concluded from the severe bottleneck reported here that
the consequent genetic drift will be strong, with negative
consequences for viral fitness. Natural selection on the
other hand is likely to mitigate any deleterious effects of
genetic drift associated with transmission.
It is possible that the diversity present in the inoculum
itself was larger, and that selection acting on env restricted
propagation of the new infection to a few members of the
initial population [30]. The similar levels of diversity
observed in env and gag could then be explained by
genetic coupling between the two regions. The frequency
with which recombination occurs in HIV-1 [14-16] argues
against such linkage, suggesting that independent selective forces acting on env and gag must be invoked to
explain this observation. Alternatively, if transmission is
neutral then our estimate of the diversity transmitted will
be closer to the diversity actually present in the inoculum.
This will have implications for the replicative fitness of the
viral population responsible for founding a new infection.

Neutral transmission also means that the degree of genetic
diversity passed between individuals is dependent on the
diversity present in the donor at the time of transmission.
Because diversity in their respective donors is likely to vary
greatly depending on the stage of infection [29], this
could in part explain our finding of wide variation across
patients in diversity of the viral population close to transmission (Table 3). Furthermore, we found the degree of
variability across patients infected by the same route to be
greater than any difference between groups infected via
different modes of transmission (i.e. the difference
between groups was not significant). Interestingly, the
diversity present early in acute infection in sexually and
parenterally infected individuals also appears similar [2].
We can conclude from our results that diversity of the
founding population is similarly restricted during both
horizontal and vertical transmission. However, it is also
clear that further study is required to investigate the variability observed. For example, although a reduction in
diversity is frequent [1-9], the transmission of multiple
variants has also been reported during both horizontal
[32] and vertical transmission [33-35], suggesting that the
bottleneck is not universally restrictive.

Conclusion
Our findings quantify the contraction in genetic diversity
that occurs during horizontal transmission of HIV-1. It is
clear from the severity of the bottleneck that further work
is required to investigate the nature of the selective forces
surrounding transmission, if we are to interpret the fitness
consequences for HIV-1 in the newly infected individual.
Furthermore, the analyses presented suggest that the
mode of transmission may not be a significant influence
on the genetic diversity transmitted.

Methods
Patient material
The donor and recipient patients of the transmitter pair
analysed here were recruited as part of an on-going study
of acute HIV-1 infection and have been described in detail
elsewhere [36]. The donor had been infected for at least
two years prior to transmission and exhibited a stable viral
load. He had not received any antiretroviral treatment.
The recipient was also untreated during the time of sampling but progressed rapidly towards disease with high
viral loads and low CD4+ cell counts. The clinical data for

The first recipient sample (day 0) was collected six weeks
after he last tested PCR (polymerase chain reaction) nega-

tive for HIV-1 DNA and RNA. Three additional samples
from the recipient were available at days 11, 59 and 237.
Donor samples were collected 70 and 155 days prior to
the first sample from the recipient. Gag p24 (834bp) and
the V1-V4 region of the env gene (951bp) were sequenced

from viral RNA. Envelope sequences were obtained from
all time points using previously described methods [37],
yielding a total of 100 clones (average: 17 clones per time
point; range: 12â21). For gag p24, a total of 100 clones
were sequenced from all time points except day 0 (average: 20 clones per time point; range: 10â28). Details of
viral loads from each time point are listed in Additional
file 1. Sequences are available from GenBank under accession numbers DQ316399âDQ316601.
Envelope sequences were also obtained from 27 HIV-1
positive children. All were HIV negative by PCR at birth
indicating that infection occurred peri-partum rather than
in utero. Detailed descriptions of the cohort [38,39] and
sequencing techniques [40] are given elsewhere. The clinical prognosis of each patient is given in Additional file 2.
Sequences were around 360bp in length, spanning the
highly variable envelope V3 region. Multiple clones were
collected from serial time points post-infection (Additional file 2). All sequences (excepting those from pa, pb,
pc and pd) were derived from viral RNA. These sequences
are available from GenBank under accession numbers
AY823998âAY824946.
Phylogenetic inference
Sequences were first aligned manually using Se-Al [41].
Maximum likelihood phylogenies for env V1-V4 and gag
p24 sequences were then constructed using PAUP* [42].
Estimation assumed the HKY85 + I + dÎ4 model of nucleotide substitution [43,44]. All parameters were inferred
from the data using maximum likelihood.
Quantification of the diversity lost during horizontal
transmission
Within a coalescent framework, and assuming the HKY85
+ dÎ4 model of nucleotide substitution [43,44], four
demographic models were fitted to the transmission pair
sequence data.

Uncertainty in the estimated parameter values is summarized by the highest posterior density (HPD) interval,
which contains 95% of the marginal posterior distribution. The length of the MCMC chain was chosen so that
the effective sample size (ESS) for each parameter was >
100, indicating that parameter space had been sufficiently
explored [24]. Since it consistently gave the lowest value,
the coalescent ESS (the number of effectively independent
log likelihoods sampled from the coalescent posterior distribution) for each model is given in Table 1. All priors
were assumed to be uniform on a natural scale, including
the effective population size in the recipient at transmission NRÏ(ttrans). The prior boundaries for the time of transmission ttrans were set from when the recipient was last
confirmed HIV-1 negative (53 days before the first recipient sample) to the time at which the first recipient sample
was collected (day 0). We placed a minimum prior bound
of one on NRÏ(ttrans). With the exception of ttrans and
NRÏ(ttrans), the MCMC chain did not impinge on any of
the prescribed prior boundaries for the models tested.
The relative fit of each model to the data was assessed
using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) [46]. The AIC
of a given model is twice its marginal log likelihood plus
the number of parameters specified (AIC = 2lnLk + 2p).
The model with the lowest AIC is selected as the best representation of the data.

All substitution and demographic parameters, including
the time of transmission ttrans, growth rate r, and mid-time
of the population t50, were estimated from the data within
a Bayesian coalescent framework by Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), using the BEAST program [45]. Bayesian
MCMC estimates each parameter as the mean of its marginal posterior probability distribution, whilst simultaneously incorporating uncertainty in the underlying
genealogy and other parameters. Diversity of the viral
population is given as the product of the effective population size and generation length in days NÏ [27].

Selection of the appropriate demographic model allowed
us to calculate NRÏ(ttrans ) and quantify the amount of
diversity lost at transmission through a comparison of
NRÏ(ttrans ) with NDÏ as the percentage ratio Î´.
Bayesian skyline plot
The skyline plot is a piecewise-constant model of population size that estimates NÏ for each coalescent interval of
the genealogy [47,48]. It allows the demographic history
of a population to be reconstructed without a priori specification of a particular model. The Bayesian skyline
extends the generalised skyline plot [48] to take into
account serial sequence sampling times and an uncertain
genealogy [28]. The distribution of skyline plots is sampled using MCMC according to their posterior probabili-

ties given the sequence data, to produce an estimate and
HPD confidence intervals of the effective population size
through time. The Bayesian skyline plot was estimated
using BEAST [45], allowing ten steps in NÏ through time.
