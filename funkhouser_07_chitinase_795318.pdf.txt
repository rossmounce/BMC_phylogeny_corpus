Abstract
Background: Chitinases (EC.3.2.1.14) hydrolyze the β-1,4-linkages in chitin, an abundant Nacetyl-β-D-glucosamine polysaccharide that is a structural component of protective biological
matrices such as insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. The glycoside hydrolase 18 (GH18) family
of chitinases is an ancient gene family widely expressed in archea, prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Mammals are not known to synthesize chitin or metabolize it as a nutrient, yet the human genome
encodes eight GH18 family members. Some GH18 proteins lack an essential catalytic glutamic acid
and are likely to act as lectins rather than as enzymes. This study used comparative genomic analysis
to address the evolutionary history of the GH18 multiprotein family, from early eukaryotes to
mammals, in an effort to understand the forces that shaped the human genome content of chitinase
related proteins.
Results: Gene duplication and loss according to a birth-and-death model of evolution is a feature
of the evolutionary history of the GH18 family. The current human family likely originated from
ancient genes present at the time of the bilaterian expansion (approx. 550 mya). The family
expanded in the chitinous protostomes C. elegans and D. melanogaster, declined in early
deuterostomes as chitin synthesis disappeared, and expanded again in late deuterostomes with a
significant increase in gene number after the avian/mammalian split.
Conclusion: This comprehensive genomic study of animal GH18 proteins reveals three major
phylogenetic groups in the family: chitobiases, chitinases/chitolectins, and stabilin-1 interacting
chitolectins. Only the chitinase/chitolectin group is associated with expansion in late
deuterostomes. Finding that the human GH18 gene family is closely linked to the human major
histocompatibility complex paralogon on chromosome 1, together with the recent association of
GH18 chitinase activity with Th2 cell inflammation, suggests that its late expansion could be related
to an emerging interface of innate and adaptive immunity during early vertebrate history.

Background
The recent increase in genome projects has provided DNA
sequence data useful for understanding the evolutionary
dynamics that resulted in the conservation of ancient proteins as modern protein families. One such family of pro-

teins is the glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinases
(GH18), widely expressed in archea, prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Definition of this family is based on amino
acid sequence similarity [1-3]. In eukaryotes the proteins
are mainly expressed by fungi, arthropods and nematodes

(for review see [4]), but they are also expressed in mammals, with members recently shown to be involved in
important physiological processes that include T-cell
mediated inflammation and allergy [5,6]. The chitinases
hydrolyze chitin, an abundantly produced homopolymer
of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine that provides architectural
reinforcement of biological structures such as insect
exoskeletons, fungal cell walls, nematode egg shells, and
other biological matrices involved in protection and self
defense. Chitin has not been detected in higher plants and
vertebrates, where cellulose and hyaluronan, respectively,
may replace certain chitin functions [7,8]. In chitinous
species, the chitinases along with chitin synthetases are
essential for remodeling chitin-containing structures during growth and development. Certain bacterial genera and
plants, which do not produce chitin, use chitinases,
respectively, for the conversion of insoluble chitin into
metabolizable nutrient sources and for defense from chitinous pathogens.
Mammals are not known to synthesize chitin or to metabolize it as a nutrient, yet the human genome encodes eight
well-documented genes for proteins now classified as glycoside hydrolase family18 members. Members of this
family are known to adopt the TIM (triosephosphate isomerase) fold consisting of a strongly conserved (β/α)8barrel structure [1-3]. Often, separate chitin-binding
domains (CBM14) [2,3] are present in the carboxyl terminal region of the proteins (additional file 1: GH18 family
domain structure). The protein family includes chitinases
as well as homologous proteins termed chitolectins. The
latter lack the key active-site glutamate residue that
donates a proton required for hydrolytic enzyme activity,
but retain highly conserved residues involved in oligosaccharide binding and overall three-dimensional structure.
Traditionally, chitinases are classified in two glycoside
hydrolase families, GH18 and GH19, with different structures and catalytic mechanisms [9]. Family GH18 includes
the chitinases from viruses, bacteria, fungi and animals as
well as classes III and V from plants [10]. The GH19 chitinases are identified mostly in plants (classes I, II and IV),
nematodes, and some bacteria [11]. Recent data indicate
chitinase activity is also present in protein families GH48
and GH20 [12,13]. N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidases such
as those in family GH20 also can participate in chitin degradation by hydrolyzing GlcNAc from the non-reducing
end of chito-oligosaccharides [14].
Three of the GH18 proteins encoded by the human
genome have demonstrated enzymatic activity. They are:
di-N-acetylchitobiase, active in the lysosomal degradation
of asparagine-linked glycoproteins [15]; chitotriosidase, a
vesicular and secreted protein produced by activated macrophages and highly elevated in serum from patients with
Gaucher disease [16]; and acidic mammalian chitinase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/96

(AMCase), expressed mostly in the gastrointestinal tract
and lung [17], and recently shown to be induced by Th2helper cells in an aeroallergen model of asthma [5]. A
gene similar to the AMCase gene encodes a fourth hypothetical protein with a truncated GH18 domain. Three
human genes (OVGP1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2) encode chitolectins likely to be involved in tissue remodeling during
inflammation and/or development. The OVGP1 gene
encodes a large glycoprotein secreted by oviduct epithelial
cells in response to estrogen [18,19]. The glycoprotein
includes an extended C-terminal repeat region similar to
sequences found in mucins. A number of cell types,
including macrophages, articular chrondrocytes and synovial cells, secrete proteins encoded by the CHI3L1 and
CHI3L2 genes under inflammatory conditions [20-22]. A
recently identified CHID1 gene encodes a lysosomal
GH18 chitolectin that interacts with stabilin-1, an endocytic/sorting receptor of macrophages that serves as a
marker of alternative activation [23]. The function of the
CHID1 protein is not yet established, and the sequence
similarity to other GH18 proteins is low.
Although the biological functions of most human GH18
proteins are not yet delineated, the available protein characterizations indicate that a process of gene duplication
and diversification has resulted in multiple functions that
are not related to nutrient utilization or growth-related
turnover of chitinous structures. Instead, recent data pertaining to the mammalian proteins point to their prominent roles in defense against fungal or other pathogens
and in inflammation and remodeling processes [6]. In
this communication, we addressed the evolutionary history of the GH18 multiprotein family from early eukaryotes to mammals in an effort to understand the forces that
shaped the human genome content of chitinase-related
proteins. The present study indicates that over evolutionary time the GH18 family evolved by decline and expansion according to selective forces associated with
speciation. An expansion of chitinase genes occurred as
chitinous species appeared early in metazoan evolution, a
decline followed as chitin disappeared as an important
structural and protective feature of early deuterostomes,
and a second expansion began in non-chitinous vertebrates where chitinases and chitolectins may have evolved
to assume increasingly important roles associated with
pathogen recognition, processing and antigen presentation.

Results
Human GH18 Family Genes and Their Relationship to
Other Mammalian GH18 Genes
Seven of the eight human GH18 family members are
located on chromosome 1. The chitobiase gene is located
at 1p22, 26 Mb upstream of the regions containing six
other chitinase/chitolectin genes, which cluster into two

groups, at 1p13 and at 1q32 (Table 1): Genes CHI3L2,
CHIA, RP11-165H20.1 and OVGP1 cluster at 1p13; and
CHIT1 and CHI3L1 at 1q32. Only the recently annotated
and weakly homologous CHID1 gene is not located on
chromosome 1, but at chromosome 11p15.5. A similar
but unique pattern of homologues is present in the mouse
genome, which includes ten genes encoding GH18 family
members. The genes are located on mouse chromosomes
1, 3 and 7. Genes Ctbs, Chia, Chi3l3, Chi3l4, Ovgp1,
Bclp2 and BC051070 are located on chromosome 3, and
Chit1 and Chi3l1 are on chromosome 1. The mouse
CHID1 homolog, designated 3110023E09Rik [Entrez
Gene ID 68038], is located at chromosome 7F5. The rat
genome is not complete, but homologous rat genes are
located on chromosomes 2, 13 and 18. There is conservation of synteny in the chromosomes of these three mammals that contain GH18 family members.
From the genome sequences currently available, it is evident based on protein sequence similarities that the mammalian genomes include orthologous clades of GH18
family members, and that the chitinase/chitolectin clade
(Figure 1) includes orthologous groups of paralogous
family members. Construction of a phylogenetic tree from
alignment of GH18 domains from 36 mammalian proteins (additional file 2: Mammalian Sequences) illustrates
these relationships. Figure 1 shows the tree, constructed
using the minimum evolution method. The lysosomal
chitobiases and stabilin-1 interacting chitolectins form
outlying clades of orthologous proteins distinct from the
true chitinases and chitolectins, which form four separate
subgroups. Subgroup I represents the acidic chitinases and
related chitolectins; subgroup II, the chitotriosidase
enzymes; subgroup III, the non-enzymatic proteins associated with injury, repair and remodeling; and subgroup
IV, the oviduct glycoproteins and related sequences. Each
of the groups is not represented in all the genomes. This
may be explained by genome projects that are not complete; or gene duplication or gene loss may have occurred

relatively late in vertebrate evolution. Among GH18
enzymes, chitobiase is biochemically unique as the only
member that splits off a monosaccharide from the reducing end of chito-oligosaccharides [15].
Chitinase/Chitolectin Genes in Early Eukaryotes (D.
discoideum and H. echinata)
To assess the family GH18 genes in early eukaryotes and
their relationship to the human genes, we examined the
genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. D.
discoideum diverged from the animal-fungal lineage after
the plant-animal split, and has retained a significant
amount of the diversity of the ancestral eukaryotic
genome [24]. Thus, chitinases present in the D. discoideum
genome should provide evolutionary insight into the
ancestral metazoan GH18 proteins present before an
apparent expansion of chitinases associated with the biological importance of chitin in protostomes (discussed in
the next section). A search of the D. discoideum genome
database at NCBI (Build 1.1;November 22, 2005)
revealed six genes encoding chitinase-related proteins.
Five of the genes cluster on two chromosomes: a 2.6 Mbp
region of chromosome 2 encodes Entrez genes 3393954,
3395463, and 3394351; and a 3.5 Kb region of chromosome 5 encodes Entrez genes 3388787 and 3388788. A
sixth gene (Entrez Gene 3387295) also located on chromosome 5 encodes a hypothetical protein [GenBank:XP_635730] that aligned with the human stabilin-1
interacting protein (Expect = 2e-48). Phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) indicated that the three chromosome 2
genes are co-orthologs of the human chitobiase. Two
chromosome 5 genes are more distant homologs, distinct
from the human chitinases/chitolectins. The third chromosome 5 gene is a human CHID1 ortholog. If the
eukaryotic ancestral genome included orthologs of the
mammalian chitinase/chitolectin group, and the presence
of chitinases in plants [11] indicates it did, they likely
have been lost in the D. discoideum lineage. As the cells of
Dictostelium are professional phagocytes that consume

bacteria as a primary nutritional source [25], the chitobiases and the related proteins are likely involved in the
uptake, internalization, killing and subsequent digestion
of bacterial cell wall components. Indeed, chitobiase will
hydrolyze GlcNAcβ-D-(1–4)MurNAc, the repeating disaccharide unit of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan [26].
However, the proteins also may contribute to the control
of microbial growth within the digestive phagosomes
[27].

Further information about the early evolution of chitindegrading proteins comes from the recent cloning of a
cDNA encoding a chitinase from a chitinous basal metazoan, the cnidarian Hydractinia echinata [28]. The 1467 bp
cDNA encodes a typical GH18 glycoside hydrolase of 464
amino acids [GenBank:CAG25409]. The protein sequence
includes a secretory signal at the N-terminus and a highly
conserved catalytic motif including its hallmark protondonating glutamic acid. The highest scoring human
sequence aligned by NCBI BLAST with the H. echinata protein sequence (Expect = 3e-90) is chitotriosidase [GenBank:NP_003456] (44% identity and 59% similarity over
414 residues, including the GH18 domain). However, all
the human chitinases/chitolectins produced high scoring
alignments (Expect < 2e-57). In contrast to the proteins
from D. discoideum, the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2)
indicated orthology of the CAG25409 protein with the
human chitinases/chitolectins.

tion [28]. (A second more recently identified H. echinata
protein [NCBI accession CAL36995] with annotated glycosyl-hydrolase and chitin-binding domains is not closely
related to the human or Dictyostelium proteins, Figure 2;
but NCBI BLAST identifies high scoring alignments with
fungal chitinases.) The cDNA expression patterns determined by in situ hybridization indicated that the
CAG25409 protein has a role in body pattern formation
and immunity. H. echinata proteins involved in immunity
are of particular interest because H. echinata has well
developed allo-recognition responses that may relate to
the early evolution of vertebrate and nonvertebrate
immune systems [29]. Thus, functions of this early metazoan chitinase suggest an ancestral pattern of chitinase/
chitolectin involvement in differentiation, development
and immunity that continued from the earliest metazoans
to present mammals. The growth and developmental
function is evident in imaginal disc growth factors and
chitinase-like proteins from the protostomes D. melanogaster and C. gigas (see next section) and in human chitolectins including OVGP1, CHI3L1, and CHI3L2, which
are secreted proteins reported to be involved in recognition processes associated with fertilization, tissue inflammation, and wound repair [19,30-33].
Evolutionary Relationship between Chitinase-Related
Genes from Human and Protostomes (D. melanogaster
and C. elegans)
As expected, comparison of family GH18 genes from genera of animals from which genome sequences are complete indicated that the highly chitin-metabolizing
protostomes C. elegans and D. melanogaster have more chitinase-related genes. A search of the C. elegans database at
the NCBI and other resources such as Wormbase [34] and
ACEView [35] identified 37 genes or predicted genes
encoding chitinases and related GH18 family members
(additional file 3: C. elegans Sequences). Searches of D.
melanogaster genome resources at NCBI and FlyBase [36]
identified 17 recognized or predicted genes encoding
GH18 family proteins (additional file 4: D. melanogaster
Sequences). Many of these protostome genes were identified in earlier publications [37,38].

A phylogenetic tree created from multiple alignment of
GH18 domain sequences from C. elegans, D. melanogaster
and human proteins indicated a general lack of orthology
among the members of the families of GH18 proteins
(Figure 3). The human chitinases/chitolectins grouped
with high significance with only a single protein from
each protostome. In the case of C. elegans, all the human
proteins grouped with the worm chitinase, cht-1 [GenBank:NP_508588], encoded on the X chromosome. The
gene encodes a predicted 66.9 kD protein with one GH18
domain and two N-terminal CBM14 (chitin binding)
domains. This domain structure differs from the verte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/96

brate enzymes, where a single CBM14 domain is present
in each of the enzymatically active chitinases (CHIT1 and
AMCase). The C. elegans cht-1 protein aligned with the
human CHIT1 protein with 40% identity and 56% similarity over 477 residues, including the GH18 domain and
a CBM14 domain. For D. melanogaster, domains from a
single protein [GenBank: NP_647768] located on chromosome 3L at 3.07 Mb, clustered with the human GH18
domains. The NP_647768 protein comprises two GH18
domains but does not include a CBM14 domain. The two
domains aligned with the human CHIT1 protein over
367–375 residues with 45–52% identity and 65% similarity. The results from the phylogenetic analysis of human
and protostomes sequences (Figure 3) indicate a single
clade encompasses these two proteostome proteins and
all the human GH18 family proteins except the two outlying groups (Figure 1). The separation of this clade (bootstrap value 89%) suggests that the human GH18
chitinases/chitolectins are likely co-orthologs of the cht-1
protein from C. elegans and the NP_647768 protein from
D. melanogaster. Interestingly, an analysis that included
the H. echinata chitinase placed it in the same clade (bootstrap value 85%) (additional file 6: Supplemental phylogenetic tree). From these data, we infer that the present
day H. echinata CAG25409 protein, the C. elegans
NP_508588 protein, and the D. melanogaster NP_647768
protein are descended from an ancient common ancestor;
and the human chitinases/chitolectins appear to be lineal
descendents of this ancestral protein.
Further, the phylogenetic analysis of the protostome
sequences indicated that D. melanogaster and C. elegans
genomes each included a one-to-one ortholog for the
human stabilin-1 interacting chitolectin. The GH18
domains from the C. elegans protein [GenBank:NP_508185], the D. melanogaster protein [GenBank:NP_609190], and the human CHID1 gene product
formed a monophylogenic group supported by a bootstrap value of 100% (Figure 3). In contrast, sequence
alignments and phylogenetic analyses did not identify
unequivocal protostome orthologs for the human chitobiase (CTBS).
So far, the C. elegans GH18 family members are only predicted from sequence relationships, and their physiological functions are not yet documented. Many of the C.
elegans proteins include only the GH18 domain, but some
sequence annotations include conserved domains known
to bind chitin, oligosaccharides and peptidoglycans. The
functions of some of the D. melanogaster proteins, however, are well established. They include enzymatic functions involved in chitin turnover associated with molting
[4] as well as a more recently characterized cell proliferation role that promotes growth in imaginal discs [39,40].
These growth-promoting factors (IDGFs) comprise a fam-

ily of five soluble proteins. They differ from the chitinases
in that they lack the C-terminal chitin-binding domain,
and glutamine replaces the critical active-site glutamate
residue involved in the catalytic mechanism of all known
GH18 chitinase enzymes. The GenBank accession numbers for the IDGFs are NP_477258, NP_477257,
NP_723967, NP_727374 and NP_611321. They form a
monophyletic group supported by a bootstrap value of
100% (Figure 3). One protein [GenBank:NP_477081]
included in the group is not annotated as IDGF; however,
BLASTP identifies its alignments with IDGFs as the best
hits in the D. melanogaster genome. Interestingly,
although some mammalian chitolectins of subgroups I,
III and IV (Figure 1) are associated with growth, differentiation and remodeling, they did not group with the imaginal disc growth factors in the phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 3). In contrast to the polar glutamine in D. melanogaster imaginal disc factors, the substitutions for the catalytic glutamate residue in the mammalian subgroups III
and IV proteins OVGP1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 are the nonpolar residues leucine or isoleucine. The mouse Chi3l3
(Ym1) and Chi3l4 (Ym2) proteins of subgroup I (Figure
1), however, have glutamines substituted for the activesite glutamates.
The three-dimensional structures of some of the chitolectins, including IDGF2, are available [40-42]. Analysis
of the structure-function properties of IDGF2 suggests the
interesting possibility that the D. melanogaster IDGFs may
have evolved to acquire new functions as growth factors
by an evolutionary progression from carbohydrate-binding to protein-binding molecules [40]. The 3D structures
of the binding sites of two of the mammalian chitolectins,
human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (CHI3L1) [GenBank:NP_001267] and mouse Ym1 (Chi3l3) [GenBank:NP_034022], support carbohydrate binding in a
manner similar to that observed for active chitinases, with
no indication of the evolutionary progression to protein
binding as proposed for IDGF2 [41,42]. This is consistent
with our phylogenetic analysis, which shows a much
closer evolutionary relationship of the human chitolectin
proteins to a putative chitinase [GenBank:NP_647768]
and several other D. melanogaster proteins than to the
IDGFs (Figure 3). However, based on a recent higher resolution structure of the mouse Ym1 protein, the carbohydrate-binding groove in this mammalian chitolectin may
be somewhat different from that of the human cartilage
glycoprotein-39 (CHI3L1) [43].
Recently two family GH18 proteins were cloned from the
oyster Crassostrea gigas, providing the first information
about the protein family from the Lophotrochozoan
branch of protostomes [44,45]. The proteins were CgClp1 [GenBank:CAI96028], a chitinase-like protein
homologous to the human CHI3L1 (GP-39), and Cg-Chit

[GenBank:CAI96026], an atypical family 18 chitinase.
Data from gene expression profiles and biochemical characterization indicated the Cg-Clp1 protein is involved in
control of growth and development, as reported for the D.
melanogaster IDGF proteins. The Cg-Chit protein characterization, however, suggests that it plays an important
role as an immunity effector in molluscs. Analysis of phylogenetic relationships of the Cg-Clp1 protein with proteins from other branches of Bilateria supported a closer
relationship of the Cg-Clp-1 protein to mammalian chitinases/chitolectins than to the D. melanogaster IDGFs [44].
Currently, six GH18 domain protein sequences from
Crassostrea gigas are available from the NCBI protein database [GenBank: CAI96025, CAI96026, CAI96027,
CAI96028, CAI96023, CAI96024]. Three of the
sequences,
including
Cg-Chit
(Chit3)
[GenBank:CAI96026], include the proton-donating glutamate
residue in the catalytic motif, indicating that they are
active chitinases. The other three sequences have a
glutamine residue substituted for the glutamate, as seen in
D. melanogaster IDGF proteins, and are likely chitolectins.
We created phylogenetic trees from sequence alignments
of the oyster GH18 domains with domains from C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and from selected mammalian species and, as reported for the Cg-Clp1 protein [44,45],
found support for an ancestral relationship of C. gigas proteins with the mammalian chitinase/chitolectins. Our
analysis supported separate monophylogenic groups for
the human chitolectins, D. melanogaster IDGF proteins,
and the C. gigas chitinase-like proteins.
The phylogenetic relationships between the human chitinase/chitolectin sequences and the C. elegans and D. melanogaster sequences shown in Figure 3 suggest that the
present multigene chitinase/chitolectin families in each
individual species reflect unique innovations that accompanied the evolutionary radiation of bilaterians into the
protostome and deuterostome divisions. The limited
orthology of the vertebrate chitinase/chitolectin family
with the protostome chitinases/chitolectins is consistent
in both deuterostomes and protostomes with extensive
gene duplication, followed by retention and diversification as well as gene loss after the radiation. In C. elegans
and D. melanogaster, expansion and diversification of chitinases likely were driven by the appearance and importance of chitinous structures in nematodes and insects and
the need for proteins associated with chitin turnover in
development, protection and metabolism. The factors
important in the human genome, however, are more difficult to understand. Clearly, the human chitinase/chitolectin proteins are more similar to each other than to
homologs in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. On this basis,
we infer that most of the human genes are relatively recent
products of gene duplication events. The genes produced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/96

by the duplications therefore have evolved in vertebrates
in the absence of chitin biosynthesis.
Chitinases/Chitolectins in Early Deuterostomes (C.
intestinalis and S. purpuratus)
The expansion and diversification of chitinase-related
genes observed in the protostomes C. elegans and D. melanogaster apparently did not occur in the earliest deuterostomes. Available data from the urochordate Ciona
intestinalis (sea squirt) draft genome as well as from echinodermata Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) indicate far fewer chitinase-related genes in non-chitinous
organisms than already observed for C. elegans and D. melanogaster. The availability of these genomes provides an
opportunity to examine chitinase-related genes from
genomes highly relevant for elucidation of the ancestral
state prior to two rounds of genome duplication postulated to have occurred in a lineage leading to vertebrates
[46-48].

Searches of the data available from the JGI (Joint Genome
Institute) C. intestinalis draft genome v2.0 (March 2005)
[49] and from S. purpuratus (genome assembly build 1.1;
August 2005) identified three sequences from the C. intestinalis genome and four from the S. purpuratus genome
that produced high scoring alignments with human
GH18 family members (Accession numbers listed in additional file 5: Other deuterostome sequences). Figure 4
shows a phylogenetic tree created from an alignment of
the C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus sequences with mammalian GH18 protein sequences. The analysis indicates
that the mammalian chitinases/chitolectins are coorthologs of C. intestinalis JGI gene model protein
ID229566. The mammalian chitobiases and stabilin-1
interacting proteins are orthologs, respectively, of the
other two C. intestinalis proteins JGI model ID 239218
and JGI model ID 223016. Further searches of the C. intestinalis genome and EST databases available at JGI did not
identify other candidate genes for chitinase/chitolectin
proteins. Thus, each of the major mammalian phylogenetic groups (Figure 1) must be represented in the C. intestinalis genome by a single gene. Three of the S. purpuratus
proteins [GenBank:XP_798621, XP_783710, and
XP_798628] are orthologs of the mammalian chitobiases.
The protein XP_783668 is an ortholog of mammalian stablin-1 interacting chitin-binding protein. As described
previously for the D. discoideum genome, searches of the S.
purpuratus genome did not identify genes with homology
to the mammalian chitinases/chitolectins.
Collectively, the C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus data,
which identify a single chitinase/chitolectin gene in C.
intestinalis and none in S. purpuratus, indicated that a
selective expansion of this group likely occurred later in
deuterostome evolution to produce the current mamma-

GH18 family genes indicated that each of these nonmammalian vertebrate genomes includes a single cluster
of chitinase homologs as well as one chitobiase and one
stablin-1 interacting protein homolog (additional file 5:
Other deuterostome sequences). In the case of X. tropicalis,
a 95 kb region of scaffold 41 encodes three chitinase genes
[Entrez Genes 548945, 548404 and 448265], each including a GH18 domain and a CBM14 domain. An 18 kb
region of G. gallus chromosome 26 encodes two chitinase
genes with GH18 and CBM14 domains [Entrez Genes
41993, 395072] and an open reading frame encoding a
partial GH18 domain, possibly a pseudogene. The presence of the proton-donating glutamate in the active site of
the GH18 domains predicts that the X. tropicalis and G.
gallus gene products are active chitinases. The data showing close clustering of the X. tropicalis and G. gallus chitinase genes indicate that tandem duplications at a single
locus occurred in the evolution of the gene families of
these species. A possibility based on observation of conserved synteny is that the X. tropicalis scaffold 41 and the
G. gallus chromosome 26 may represent current versions
of an ancestral GH18 locus that expanded and rearranged
in mammals after the mammalian-avian split (approx.
310 mya) [52]. The present overall arrangement of the
mammalian genes indicates both an expansion and separation of the chitinase/chitolectin genes after the last common ancestor of birds and mammals

The two outlying groups, chitobiases and stablin-1 chitolectins, did not undergo a similar expansion. Notably,
the C. intestinalis genome assembly v2.0 (March 2005)
represents the third assembly release, and is essentially
complete with some scaffolds (179 Mb) not yet mapped
to chromosomes [50]. The S. purpuratus genome sequencing is in progress; therefore, the preliminary assembly
(build 1.1) [51] may not include all GH18 family genes.
Vertebrate Chitinases/Chitolectins (X. tropicalis, G.
gallus, M. domestica)
Searches of the X. tropicalis genome (August 2005 Assembly) and the G. gallus genome (May 2006 Assembly) for

Monodelphis domestica (the gray short-tailed opossum) was
interesting to examine as a representative of an intermediate between the existing mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate models. As a result of common ancestry,
the opossum GH18 family genes may reveal changes that
reflect innovations that accompanied mammalian evolution after the avian split. The metatherian ("marsupial")
mammals are phylogenetically distinct from current placental mammals having diverged approximately 150–180
mya; however, they are more closely related to one
another than to any other vertebrates (birds, amphibians,
fishes) [53,54].
The opossum genome includes, on chromosome 2, seven
Genescan Gene Prediction models [55] encoding GH18
family proteins (additional file 5: Other deuterostome
sequences). Six of the models (c_307.104 through
c_307.108 and c_214.85) predict chitinase/chitolectin
homologs and the seventh model (c_199.2) predicts a
human chitobiase homolog. Three of the gene models
(c_307.104, c307.107, and c_214.85) include two GH18
domains. The models encoding chitinase/chitolectins
form clusters at the 107 Mb and the 542 Mb regions of
chromosome 2, and the chitobiase model is located at 44
Mb. This arrangement resembles that of human GH18
family genes on chromosome 1.

Whole genome alignments of the human genome with
the opossum genome (Jan 2006 Assembly) indicated that
human genes CHI3L2, RP11-165H20.1, CHIA and
OVGP1 align, respectively, with Genescan models
c_307.104 (first GH18 domain), c_307.105, c_307.106,
and c_307.108. Human genes CHI3L1 and CHIT1 align
with the two domains of c_214.85. Thus, the opossum
genome includes in the same orientation and order an
orthologous gene for each human chitinase/chitolectin,
and the human family GH18 family gene arrangement
extends at least as far back as marsupials. The opossum
genome includes in the same region an additional gene
model (c_307.107) with two GH18 domains, which is
not included in the human orthology. Further investigation indicated that these two domains (denoted
c_307.107A/B in Figure 7, discussed below) are coorthologs of the X. tropicalis putative chitinase [Entrez
Gene 448265]. Congruency in number and physical
arrangement of GH18 family genes in the opossum and
human genomes indicates that an expansion and separation of chitinase/chitolectin genes occurred before the
divergence of the metatharian and placental mammals
(150–180 mya).
Chitinase/Chitolectin Encoding Regions Are Adjacent to
the Human MHC Paralogous Region at Chromosome 1
An interesting observation in view of the recent discovery
of an association of the chitinase proteins with Th2 cell
mediated immunity (discussed earlier [5,6]) is that the
human GH18 family genes are located adjacent to the
MHC paralogon genes on the two arms of human chromosome 1 (Figure 5). The human MHC consists of a large
number of genes essential to antigen presentation and
immune function, including the MHC class I and class II
genes that serve pivotal roles in adaptive immunity. In
addition to the MHC locus at chromosome 6p21.3, the
human genome includes three paralogous genomic
regions (paralogons) located on different chromosomes
(chromosome1p11-p32/1q21-q25, chromosome 9q32q34, and chromosome 19 p13.1-p13.3) [48]. The GH18
cluster including CHI3L2, RP11-165H20.1, CHIA, and
OVGP1 is located at 1p13.3-p13.2 and the cluster including CHI3L1 and CHIT1 is located at 1q32.1.

Furthermore, regions of human chromosomes 1 and 6
adjacent to and including the human MHC, MHC paralogon, and GH18 family genes align with chitinase-containing regions of G. gallus chromosome 26, X. tropicalis
scaffold 41, and M. domestica chromosome 2 (Figure 6).
Taken as a whole, as much as 82% of the 5.1 Mb G. gallus
chromosome 26, which encodes the chitinase genes,
aligns with regions adjacent to the human MHC and the
MHC paralogon at chromosome 1. The G. gallus MHC,
however, is located separately in a 92 kb region of chromosome 16 (a microchromosome of 433 Kb). This region

the more complex human MHC as it consists of only 19
genes, virtually all having counterparts in the human
genome [56]. The X. tropicalis scaffold 41 (3.9 Mb) is
almost the same size as G. gallus chromosome 26 and
shows similar synteny with human chromosomes 1 and 6
(Figure 6).
The opossum MHC, which is similar in size and complexity to MHCs of eutherian mammals [57], is located on
chromosome 2 (260 Mb region). Opossum chromosome
2 not only contains the GH18 family genes, but also its
alignments with the human genome encompassed extensive regions of human chromosomes 1 and 6 including,
respectively, the MHC paralogon and the MHC (Figure 6).

human chromosome 6. From the perspective of the
human genome, as much as 80% of the 247 Mb human
chromosome 1 and 85% of the 170 Mb human chromosome 6 aligned with opossum chromosome 2. Collectively, these data from alignment of the human genome
with the X. tropicalis, G. gallus, and opossum genomes
demonstrate conserved general patterns of synteny
between family GH18 genes and regions including or
adjacent to the MHC and MHC paralogon 1. This conserved synteny suggests an ancient organizational relationship between the MHC and GH18 genes.
Speculations Regarding the Chitinase/Chitolectin Genes
Host defense associated with innate immunity is one of
the important established functions of chitinases, extending as far back in evolution as the common ancestor of
plant and animal kingdoms [11]. However, the recent
descriptions of the involvement of chitinases/chitolectins
in human and mouse T cell effector mechanisms [5,6]
suggest an additional role concerned with the adaptive
Th2 immune response in mammals. The evolution of an
adaptive immune system with somatic rearranging genes
is a relatively recent occurrence. Current evidence indicates that genes critical for adaptive immunity first
appeared in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) about 500

mya [58]. Comparative genomics of the MHC indicate
that the paralogous regions on chromosomes 1, 6, 9, and
19 may have originated by block or whole genome duplications from a common ancestral proto-MHC region
present in protochordates (Ciona and Branchiostoma)
[48,59,60]. Previous studies indicate that two rounds of
whole genome or large block duplication took place
before the emergence of jawed vertebrates, but after the
emergence of cephalochordates. A recent review discusses
the duplications and the architecture of such a protoMHC in protochordates, and suggests that this region may
have included genes that evolved long before the emergence of the adaptive immune system [48]. Immunerelated genes may have been among early genes that were
co-opted or recruited for additional roles related to adaptive immunity [47,61]. Earlier references [5,6] as well as a
recently published review describing chitinases and chitiolectins as "critical mediators" of Th2 inflammatory
responses [62] are consistent with the view that chitinase/
chitolectin genes were among those recruited.
Considering these new observations related to the evolutionary history of the chitinases, involvement of mammalian GH18 proteins in both innate and adaptive
immunity may be related to their expression in phagocytic
cells, particularly macrophages [20,21,63] and dendritic
cells [64], which have roles in both types of immunity
[65]. The association of GH18 proteins with phagocytosis
is evident early in animal evolution, as we identified five
homologs of the human lysosomal chitobiase in the D.
discoideum genome. Since D. discoideum cells are professional phagocytes that engulf and digest bacteria as a
nutrient source, these enzymes are likely among the
hydrolases in their phagosomes and lysosomes involved
in digestion of bacterial cell walls [25]. During metazoan
evolution, the primary digestive function of phagosomes
has expanded to include roles in development, tissue
remodeling, apoptosis, and in innate and adaptive immunity [66]. In mammalian phagocytic cells, engulfment,
and degradation of pathogens as well as mechanisms
related to MHC II antigen presentation are associated with
endosomal/lysosomal compartments, where several
members of the GH18 family are located [20,23,67].
Therefore, the chitinase/chitolectin genes may have
evolved and expanded during vertebrate evolution in
association with evolutionary changes in phagocytosis,
particularly changes associated with vesicular antigen
processing pathways.
Many observations are now remarkably consistent with
chitinase family GH18 proteins having roles in vesicular
antigen processing and MHC II presentation: the requirement of AMCase (CHIA) enzymatic activity for its mediation of Th2 responses in inflammation and asthma [5]; an
acidic pH optimum of AMCase catalytic activity corre-

sponding to the acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments involved in antigen processing [17]; the presence of
AMCase (CHIA) and other chitinase/chitolectins, particularly mouse Ym1 (Chi3l3) and human chitinases, in macrophages and other antigen presenting cells [5,63,68,69];
and regulation of both chitinase and chitolectin gene
expression by inflammatory cytokines such as interferon
γ, IL-4 and IL-13 [5,63,68-70]. An interesting speculation
is that chitinase-related genes were present in an ancestral
proto-MHC region and were among those recruited for
additional roles in immunity. The patterns of conserved
synteny of GH18 proteins with the MHC and the chromosome 1 paralogon are consistent with this possibility.
Recently the organization of the proto-MHC region of the
cephalochordate amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae (traditionally considered the closest living invertebrate to the
vertebrates, a view recently challenged by new phylogenic
data [71]) became available and was used to reconstruct
chordate and gnathostome ancestor proto-MHC regions
[72]. Interestingly, a homolog for the human NEK7 gene,
located at 1q31.3, approx. 5Mb centromeric to the CHIT1
gene, is present in the reconstructed proto-MHC. In X.
tropicalis, an NEK7 homolog is located on scaffold 41
approx. 4 Mb upstream of the chitinase gene cluster. The
opossum chromosome 2 also encodes a NEK7 homolog
(located at 99 Mb, 8 Mb upstream of the CHIT1 homolog
located at 107 Mb). Thus, synteny between ancient protoMHC genes and chitinase family members might have
existed at least since the emergence of amphibians
(approx. 350 mya) [73].
Evolution by a birth-and-death process
Our comparative genomic analysis of the GH18 protein
family indicates that considerable loss, duplication and
diversification of these genes occurred in vertebrates. The
diversification and expansion occurred in the chitinase/
chitolectin phylogenetic group with no indication of similar changes in the chitobiases and stabilin-1 interacting
groups. A phylogenic tree, Figure 7, shows the relationship of homologous chitinase/chitolectin genes from several vertebrate species including six chitinase genes from
D. rerio (zebrafish), which shared a common ancestor
with mammals approximately 420 mya [53]. The tree also
includes the C. intestinalis chitinase [JGI protein model ID
229566] and is rooted with the bacterial GH18 protein
Serratia marcescens [GenBank:P07254]. As observed for
earlier metazoan species, Figure 7 shows that distantly
related vertebrates such as humans, M. domestica, G. gallus,
X. tropicalis, and D. rerio have significantly different sets of
chitinase/chitolectin genes. According to the tree, the
genes form four major clusters (A, B, C, D). Cluster A corresponds to the chitinase/chitolectin subgroup I (Figure
1); cluster C, to subgroup IV; cluster D, to subgroup II; and
cluster E to subgroup III. Cluster B does not include genes
from placental mammals and is not included in Figure 1.

The dynamic evolutionary process for these genes must
reflect the morphological and other changes that accompanied the stages of vertebrate evolution.
The process of gene expansion, deletion and diversification must have occurred more than once to explain the
long evolutionary history of the GH18 family of chitinase
genes. Although the literature indicates multiple chitinases are present in plants and bacteria, we clearly identified chitobiase genes, but no chitinase/chitolectin genes
in the nearly complete D. discoideum genome. An important expansion of chitinase/chitolectin genes must have
occurred in protostomes C. elegans and D. melanogaster, as
chitinous structures in these species became important
protective and architectural features. Chitin synthase (biosynthesis) and chitinases lost importance in early deuterostomes, and examination of chitinase/chitolectin genes
in C. intestinalis and S. purpuratus genomes indicated that
the expansion and diversification of chitinases/chitolectins did not continue in these early non-chitinous
deuterostomes (Figure 4). However, comparison of the
genes from these early genomes with higher vertebrate
and mammalian genomes indicated a significant expansion of genes during late vertebrate evolution. Comparison of GH18 family genes from X. tropicalis, G. gallus and
M. domestica revealed an increase of chitinase/chitolectin
genes after the avian-mammalian split (Figure 7).
Figure 8 provides a summary of the contraction and
expansion of these genes during eukaryotic evolution.
Overall, the data presented show a general lack of orthology between the protostome, early deuterostome, and
mammalian chitinases/chitolectins and support the view
that the mammalian genes evolved new functions associated with innovations that accompanied evolution of the
mammalian species. The phylogenetic data for the GH18
family are consistent with the model of birth-and-death
evolution described by Nei and colleagues [74].
The evolutionary history of the GH18 family includes
other examples of recruitment of family members for
novel functions. The emergence of a subfamily of xylanase
inhibitors within the GH18 family recently reported in
plants represents one such example [75]. A factor central
to the evolution of novel functions for the GH18 family
may be their very common protein fold, the TIM barrel
conformation, known to form a stable core structure with
specific binding and catalytic functions residing in the
loop regions separated from the alpha helices and beta
sheets. This type of structure/function relationship in proteins may be particularly well suited to divergence of new
functions from an ancestral protein by the process of gene
duplication and subsequent modification by mutation,
since changes in the loop regions would not produce
major changes in protein stability [75,76]. McMahon et

Summary diagram indicating contraction and expansion of the chitinase/chitolectin protein family during
eukaryotic evolution. A schematic of eukaryote phylogeny
is shown alongside a bar graph indicating the number of chitinase/chitolectin genes identified in the genomes of selected
species corresponding to the tree classifications. The schematic is according to the recent animal phylogeny suggested
by multigene analyses of bilaterian animals [71]. The species
for which the number of genes is shown are the gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) human (Hsa), opossum (Mdo),
chicken (Gga) and Xenopus (Xtr); the chordate C. intestinalis
(Cin); the echinoderm S. purpuratus (Spu); the nematode C.
elegans (Cel); the arthropod D. melanogaster (Dme); and the
Dictyosteliida D. discoideum (Ddi), all discussed in the text.
Also included in the graph are data for the fungi Aspergillis
fumigatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the plant Arabidopis thaliana (Additional file 7: Other chitinase sequences).
The A. fumigatus and S. cerevisiae genes were obtained by

al. (2005) recently emphasized the importance of scaffold
stability in the evolution of proteins displaying sequence
variation related to binding diversity [77]. To our knowledge, recruitment for development or host defense purposes has not been reported for other GH families.

Conclusion
Our comprehensive genomic study of animal GH18 family proteins provides valuable new insights into phylogenetic relationships of the proteins and the evolutionary
history of the protein family. This represents the first such
detailed study of animal GH18 family proteins. The family consists of three major phylogenetic groups: chitobiases, chitinases/chitolectins, and stabilin-1 interacting
chitolectins. Only the chitinase/chitolectin group is associated with expansion in late deuterostomes. The phylogeny of animal GH18 genes is consistent with evolution of

the family by a birth-and-death process according to the
model described for multigene families of the vertebrate
immune system [74]. The finding that the human GH18
gene family is closely associated with the human MHC
paralogon on chromosome 1, together with published
data indicating an association of GH18 chitinase activity
with Th2 cell inflammation, suggests the possibility that
the late expansion could be related to an emerging interface of innate and adaptive immunity during early vertebrate history.

Methods
Genome searches
For C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes, BLASTP was
used to query the NCBI Entrez Genome nucleotide and
protein databases with the complete human chitinase
sequences [GenBank:NP_970615 and NP_003456] and
the GH18 domain sequences. The Entrez protein link to
the NCBI's Conserved Domain Database search service
(CDD) [78] identified the GH18 domain family members
(GH18 is designated CDD|24313 which corresponds to
pfam00704, smart60636, and Interpro IPR001223 in the
respective domain-based databases). The BLAST protein
searches used the Entrez protein graphical viewer BLink
[79] to identify closely related sequence neighbors. Other
resources were Ensembl v37 – February 2006 [80] used to
search for IPR001223 domains, Flybase [36] and Aceview
[35].

Query of Ciona intestinalis genome sequence v2.0 (March
2005) available from JGI Joint Genome Institute, (JGI)
[49] using human protein sequences and GH18 domains
[GenBank:NP_970615 and NP_003456] along with
searches of the C. intestinalis genome using the domain
GH18 [Interpro IPR001223] identified the C. intestinalis
chitinase-related genes.
The human chromosome 1 regions encoding chitinase/
chitolectin genes were compared to whole genome assemblies from Monodelphis domestica, Gallus gallus, Xenopus
tropicalis and Danio rerio using the UCSC browser [81].
The UCSC Genome Browser databases [82] used in this
study were: NCBI Build 35, May 2004 Assembly (hg17)
produced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium; Opossum Jan 2006 (UCSC version
monDom4) (produced by The Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA; the February 2004 chicken (Gallus gallus) draft assembly, produced by the Genome Sequencing
Center at the Washington University School of Medicine
in St. Louis, Mo. USA; the August 2005 Assembly frog
(Xenopus tropicalis) whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly version 3.0, DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Walnut
Creek, CA, USA; the May 2005 zebrafish (Danio rerio) Zv5
assembly produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for
Developmental Biology in Tûbingen, Germany, and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/96

Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The Netherlands.
Other genome resources were: NCBI Entrez genome databases for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) Build
1.1, August 2005; Dictyostelium discoideum Build 1.1,
November 2005, and Danio rerio (zebrafish) Build Zv4,
July 2005 and Ensembl genomes Danio rerio Zv5, May
2005 Assembly; Xenopus tropicalis JGI 4.0 June 2005
Assembly, and Monodelphis domestica MonDom 4.0, January 2006 Assembly. In some cases, NCBI Map Viewer [83]
was used for chromosomal locations.
Phylogenetic Analysis
For multiple sequence alignments, the Clustal X (version
1.83) Program [84] aligned the GH18 domain amino acid
sequences. Boundaries of GH18 domains were obtained
from the multiple sequence alignment by editing multiple
alignments to conform to the GH 18 domain of human
chitotriosidase (CHIT1), for which the 3D structure is
available [PDB: 1HKK]. The alignment parameters used
were those suggested by Hall [85]. Values used for pairwise alignments were gap opening penalty 35 and gap
extension penalty 0.75. Values for multiple alignment
were gap opening penalty 15, gap extension penalty 0.3,
and delay divergent sequences 25%. Protein weight
matrix chosen from the multiple alignment parameters
menu was Gonnet series. Duplicate and alternatively
spliced protein isoforms were excluded so that only one
gene product was used for analysis. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted with MEGA version 3.1 software [86]
using maximum parsimony, minimum evolution, and
neighbor-joining methods with the Poisson-correction
for multiple amino acid substitutions. In all cases, the
three methods produced very similar topologies. A summary composite tree that includes the early eukaryote,
protostome, early deuterostome and vertebrate sequences
discussed in the text is included as additional file 8: Composite tree.
