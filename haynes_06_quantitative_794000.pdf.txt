Abstract
Background: It has become increasingly apparent that a comprehensive database of RNA motifs
is essential in order to achieve new goals in genomic and proteomic research. Secondary RNA
structures have frequently been represented by various modeling methods as graph-theoretic
trees. Using graph theory as a modeling tool allows the vast resources of graphical invariants to be
utilized to numerically identify secondary RNA motifs. The domination number of a graph is a
graphical invariant that is sensitive to even a slight change in the structure of a tree. The invariants
selected in this study are variations of the domination number of a graph. These graphical invariants
are partitioned into two classes, and we define two parameters based on each of these classes.
These parameters are calculated for all small order trees and a statistical analysis of the resulting
data is conducted to determine if the values of these parameters can be utilized to identify which
trees of orders seven and eight are RNA-like in structure.
Results: The statistical analysis shows that the domination based parameters correctly distinguish
between the trees that represent native structures and those that are not likely candidates to
represent RNA. Some of the trees previously identified as candidate structures are found to be
"very" RNA like, while others are not, thereby refining the space of structures likely to be found
as representing secondary RNA structure.
Conclusion: Search algorithms are available that mine nucleotide sequence databases. However,
the number of motifs identified can be quite large, making a further search for similar motif
computationally difficult. Much of the work in the bioinformatics arena is toward the development
of better algorithms to address the computational problem. This work, on the other hand, uses
mathematical descriptors to more clearly characterize the RNA motifs and thereby reduce the
corresponding search space. These preliminary findings demonstrate that graph-theoretic
quantifiers utilized in fields such as computer network design hold significant promise as an added
tool for genomics and proteomics.

Background
Predicting the final fold of RNA from its sequence is a
challenging problem, but has played a secondary role to

the protein structure prediction problem. Interest in both
the prediction of secondary and tertiary RNA structure is
currently gaining substantial momentum. Recently, the

Journal Science devoted a special issue to the form and
function of RNA [1]. It is now known that RNA is involved
in a large variety of processes, including gene regulation.
Despite this, the important task of classifying RNA molecules in order to identify structural motifs remains far
from complete. Many classes of RNA molecules are characterized by highly conserved secondary structures. Since
RNA molecules maintain independently stable and highly
conserved secondary folds, RNA function is also highly
correlated with its secondary structure. Thus, we focus on
identifying structural characteristics of secondary RNA.
The utility of graphs as models of proteins and nucleic
acids is fertile ground for the discovery of new and innovative methods for the numerical characterization of biomolecules. In this paper we address the applicability of
graphs in the analysis of secondary RNA structure. A
mathematical graph, or simply a graph, is a set of points,
called vertices, and connecting lines, called edges. Trees
are a familiar example of graphs since they are used extensively to aid in phylogenetic studies. RNA tree graphs were
first developed by Le et al.[2] and Benededetti and Morosetti[3] to determine structural similarities in RNA. Secondary structure tree representation can also be found in
Waterman's classic text, An Introduction to Computational
Biology[4]. In a recent paper titled Exploring the repertoire of
RNA secondary motifs using graph theory; implications for
RNA design, researchers led by Tamar Schlick developed a
new method for representing secondary RNA structure as
a two dimensional RNA tree graph[5]. Unlike the classic
model developed by Waterman et.al. where atoms are represented by vertices and bonds between the atoms by
edges in the graph, the RAG (RNA as Graphs) project represents stems as edges and breaks in the stems that result
in bulges and loops as vertices. A nucleotide bulge, hairpin loop or internal loop are each represented by a vertex
when there is more than one unmatched nucleotide or
non-complementary base pair. This modeling method is
illustrated in figures 8 and 9. Their method has led to the
creation of an RNA topology database called RAG (Rna As
Graphs) that is published and available at BMC Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics[6,7]. In this database, all possible unlabeled trees of a given order (number of vertices)
are presented for orders two through eleven. For trees of
order eight and below, a color scheme is used; red trees
represent a known native secondary RNA structure, blue
trees are listed as likely candidates and black trees are
those structures that are considered not likely to be found
as RNA structures. For trees of order nine and above, blue
is not utilized. That is, the likely candidates are not identified. In this work we demonstrate that a graphical analysis of the trees that have been classified by the color
scheme, without the aid of thermodynamic properties of
the nucleic acids or other biophysical considerations, can
determine which trees are RNA-like in structure.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/108

The total number of possible RNA tree graphs for a given
number of vertices is given by the tree enumeration theorems of Harary and Prins[8]. Schlick et al.[5] found that
existing RNA classes represent only a small subset of the
possible tree representations of two-dimensional RNA
motifs. It is believed that many more will either be found
as a native structure, or synthetically developed. Thus,
investigating the quantitative properties of the trees not
known to exist as native structures is a natural way to proceed. In a successive paper by the Schlick group, candidates for novel RNA topologies where identified [9]. The
RAG project uses two representations for secondary RNA;
trees as described above, and dual graphs which we have
not discussed here. In [8], dual graphs are used in the
analysis and in this work, we analyze the tree graphs. Dual
graphs have the advantage in that all secondary RNA structures have a dual graph representation, whereas only certain RNA structures can be represented as a tree. However,
part of the purpose of this work is to test the applicability
of the enormous amount of graphical invariants available
that might aid in the quantification of biomolecules. This
work demonstrates the potential for this line of investigation and in fact shows that invariants used in network
design and fault-tolerant computing lend themselves to a
quantitative analysis of secondary RNA structures.

Results
Graph-theoretic analysis
In the RNA database RAG, the trees are catalogued by their

Fiedler (second smallest) eigenvalue, denoted by λ2[6].
The trees are listed in increasing order, the tree with the
smallest value of λ2 first and the tree with the largest last.

The trees are labeled by the number of vertices in the tree
followed by their order of listing. The tree with eight vertices in figure 1a is labeled 8.11 in the RAG database and
models a native structure. The tree in 1b is labeled 8.13
and is indicated by RAG as a candidate (RNA-like) structure, and the tree in figure 1c is labeled 8.14 and is classified as not RNA-like in structure by RAG. The candidate
tree structure in figure 1b is not predicted to be RNA-like
by the domination parameter models. However the domination based models agree with the database on all of the
other trees of order eight. In this paper we determine five
domination numbers for each tree, namely the domination, total domination, global alliance, locating-dominating and differentiation domination numbers. These
graphical invariants are defined in the section on graph
theory definitions and terminology. The domination
number of each of the three trees in figure 1 are four, three

and two respectively, placing the candidate numerically
between the known native structure and the structure classified in the RAG database as not RNA-like. With respect
to the total domination number and the global alliance
number, there is little or no indication of any variation in
the classification. That is, the domination numbers for the
tree in figure 1b are indicative that the tree's efficiency
(with respect to the domination numbers) is between the
RNA-like and not RNA-like trees. However, with respect to
the locating-dominating number, the tree in figure 1b
behaves very much like the tree in figure 1c. In particular,
the candidate's structure, when viewed in terms of this
particular domination invariant, is highly inefficient as is
the not RNA-like tree in 1c. In some sense, one could say
that the domination based parameters reveal an underlying efficient communication network. Clearly, a single
graphical invariant such as the Fiedler eigenvalue or the

locating-dominating number is not sufficient to numerically characterize biological molecules. However, by
defining parameters that combine these measures, we
develop a meaningful prediction tool of the native structures. Accordingly, we define two parameters p1 and P2 by
the graphical invariants we define later in this paper. We
also modify P2 by the Fiedler eigenvalues to further investigate this parameter and denote it by

P2 .

Statistical results
The results from the statistical analysis are shown in Table
1. The objective of the statistical analysis was to explore
the possibility of predicting if a tree is RNA-like based on
the values of the two variables defined solely in terms of

domination P1 = (γ + γt + γa)/n (domination + total domi-

nation + global alliance)/n and P2 = (γL + γD)/n(locating
domination + differentiating domination)/n. As an alter*
native for P2, a third variable was considered P2 that also

incorporates the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph,
*
P2 = γL + γD + n λ2 (locating domination + differentiating

domination + n (second smallest eigenvalue)). Separate
dotplots were prepared for 7 and 8 vertices trees, both for
*
P1, P2 and P2 . However since they exhibit a similar behav-

ior, they were combined into a single dotplot for both sets
of trees. In the individual dotplots it was observed that the
gap in P1 value between the native trees and the trees not
likely to represent RNA was wider for the 7 vertices trees
than for the 8 vertices trees; but in both cases, all native
trees had P1 > 1.2. In a similar fashion, the gap between

to the non RNA-like structures. However, it identifies two

models. The logistic models, described in the methods
section of the paper, correctly identify all native structures

RNA motifs
The RAG database classifies all possible tree structures
with eight or fewer vertices as either native structures that
have been found, candidate RNAs or non RNA-like in
structure. Those that are RNA-like in structure that have
not been verified as existing are considered candidates
that may later be identified or artificially produced. In this
study, we consider all of the tree structures with seven or
eight vertices. Using the graphical parameters P1, P2 and

the domination based parameters used in the logistic
models identify two clusters. All of the native structures
and almost all of the RAG candidate structures are predicted as RNA-like by our model and the structures identified by RAG as not RNA-like are also not RNA-like by our
models. We also conclude that the tree labeled 8.16 is an
exceptionally good candidate while the model rejects trees
7.4 and 8.13 (figure 1b). The emerging area of RNA as a
tool and target has produced a wealth of new and innovative pharmaceutical applications. Chemically synthesized
RNA's have been produced to aid in the development of
novel therapeutics. Functional clusters of RNA, both
mRNA and regulatory RNA binding proteins are a rich
source of therapeutic tools for the management and
potential cures of human disease. This novel approach for
identifying tree structures that have definite RNA-like
characteristics shows promise as an added tool for the
design and analysis of nucleic acids.
Graphs as mathematical objects
A graph is a mathematical object that is frequently
described as a set of points (vertices) and a set of lines
(edges) that connect some, possibly all, of the points. If
two points in the graph are connected by a line, they are
said to be adjacent, otherwise they are nonadjacent. How
the lines are drawn, straight, curved, long, or short is irrelevant; only the connection is relevant. An alternate definition of a graph is a set of elements with a well-defined
relation. Each element in the set can be represented by a
point and if two elements in the set are related, then the
corresponding points are connected by an edge. So the
common definition of a graph is really a visual representation of a relationship that is defined on a set of ele-

ments. In graph theory, one then studies the relational
representation as an object in its own right, discerning
properties of the object and quantifying the results. These
quantities are called graphical invariants since their values
are the same regardless of how the graph is drawn. The
graphical invariants, in turn, tell us about the consequences the relation has on the set. The domination
number of a graph is an example of such an invariant. The
idea of domination is based on sets of vertices that "are
near" (dominate) all the vertices of a graph. To illustrate
the definition of the domination number of a graph, we
consider an example of its application. Suppose each vertex of the graph represents a computer and two computers
are adjacent if there is a direct link between them in the
network. Some of the computers are designated as file
servers to house the programs for the entire network. If the
file servers are selected in such a way that every computer
is either a file server or has a direct connection to a file
server, then the set of file servers is a dominating set. The
minimum number of file servers required so that every
computer in the network has access to one is the domination number of the associated graph. For more information on the domination number of graphs see[10]. There
are numerous graphical invariants defined for graphs. Our
selection of the invariants for the trees is based on those
that are sensitive to a change in the structure of a tree. For
example, the locating-domination number of a graph is
defined as the minimum number of vertices in any locating-dominating set. A locating-dominating set of vertices
with the following properties:
1. any vertex outside the set must be adjacent to at least
one in the locating-dominating set.

2. given a a single vertex outside the dominating set, the
set of vertices in the locating-dominating set that this single vertex is adjacent to is always unique.
If we think of two vertices in the tree as regions in the RNA
structure where interaction is most likely to occur due to
the fact that there are unpaired nucleotide bases, then if an
"interaction" occurs, a mechanism is in place that makes
it is possible to discern the location of the interacting
region. Graphs have been used extensively to aid in the
design and analysis of algorithms and hence are an integral part of the field of bioinformatics [11-13]. However,
the use of graphs as the biomolecules themselves has been
fairly limited. There have been some earlier models of biomolecules as graphs, but in those cases the graph's spectrum is the primary focus of the analysis[14-16]. For a nice
survey on some of the applications see graphs and proteins see[17]. Spectral graph theory has been a useful tool
for chemist who have used graphs to model molecules.
And other graph theoretic measures have been defined

that are well suited for molecular description in the spirit
of chemical graph theory[18]. However, the field of graph
theory offers many other tools and techniques for further
quantification and analysis of graphs. In this work, we
show that graphical invariants, which aid in the optimization of computer and electrical networks, are a remarkable
new source of information about the structure of secondary RNA molecules.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that graphical invariants based on
domination numbers can numerically identify characteristics of secondary RNA structure. Search algorithms such
as RNAMotif[19] can be used to mine nucleotide
sequence databases for motifs. RNAMotif allows users to
identify similar motifs within the database. However,
when the constraints are relaxed to provide more flexibility, the number of motifs identified by the algorithm may
become very large. Exhaustive methods to search for similar RNA structure over these large search spaces are likely

to be computationally intractable. Much of the work in
the bioinformatics arena is toward the development of
better algorithms to address the computational problem.
This work, on the other hand, uses mathematical descriptors that can easily and more clearly characterize the RNA
motifs and thereby significantly reduce the corresponding
search space. The graphical invariants used to identify
structural characteristics of a class of biomolecules
depends on the corresponding graph. By representing biomolecules as graphs, we can then thoroughly investigate
the graph using the appropriate graphical invariants;
thereby quantifying the structure. Although determining
graphical invariants in general is computationally difficult
as well, for special classes of graphs such as trees there
exist fast algorithms for their computation. These preliminary findings from this novel approach are intriguing and
the method shows promise as an added tool for genomic
and proteomic prediction tools.

Methods
Graph theory definitions and terminology
Trees have been highly studied as a family of graphs.
Therefore, in this work, we employ graphical invariants
that are indicative of variations in the structure of trees. In
particular, we utilize a number of domination parameters
that are highly sensitive to the structural changes of small
ordered trees. First we define the graphical invariants that
are utilized in this work. These definitions can be found in
Fundamentals of Domination in Graphs, Chemical Graph Theory or in Graph Theory and its Applications [10,20,21] We
denote the vertex set of a graph by V(G), or simply V. The
number of edges incident to a vertex v is the degree of the
vertex deg(v) and two vertices are adjacent if they are incident to the same edge. A vertex set S is a dominating set if
for every vertex u ∈ V - S, u is adjacent to at least one vertex
in S. The domination number γ(G) is the minimum cardinality among all dominating sets in G. A set S is a total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/108

dominating set if for every vertex u ∈ V, u is adjacent to at
least one vertex in S (note here that even the vertices in S
must be adjacent to a vertex in S). The total domination
number γt(G) is the minimum cardinality among all total
dominating sets in G. The neighborhood of a vertex v,
denoted by N(v), is the set of all vertices adjacent to v and
the closed neighborhood of a vertex u is N[u] = N(u) ∪ {u}.
A dominating set S is called a locating-dominating set if for
any two vertices v, w ∈ V - S, N(v) ∩ S ≠ N(w) ∩ S. Thus,
in a locating dominating set, every vertex in V - S is dominated by a distinct subset of the vertices of S. The locatingdomination number of a graph G is the minimum cardinality among all locating dominating sets in G and is denoted
by γL(G). A dominating set S is called a differentiating dominating set if for any two vertices v, w ∈ V, N[v] ∩ S ≠ N[w]
∩ S. The differentiating domination number of a graph G is
the minimum cardinality among all differentiating dominating sets in G and is denoted by γD(G). The global alliance number of a graph G is the minimum cardinality
among all global alliances of G, where a set S is a global
alliance if S is a dominating set and for each u ∈ S, the
number of "allies" it has in S are at least as many as it has
in V - S. In other words, S is a dominating set and for each
vertex u ∈ S, it is true that |N[u] ∩ S| ≥ |N(u) ∩ (V - S)|.
The adjacency matrix A = A(G) and the degree matrix D =
D(G) are the square matrices that contain information
about the internal connectivity of vertices in G. They are
defined as

1 if and only if v i and v j are adjacent

Ai , j = 
 0 otherwise

i= j
 deg(vi ) if
Di , j = 
otherwise
0
The Laplacian matrix L = Lij(G) is the square matrix defined
by L = D - A

 deg(vi ) if
i= j

Lij =  −1
if
i ≠ j and (vi , v j ) ∈ E(G)

otherwise
0
The eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a graph is the
graph's spectrum. The eigenvalues are related to the density
distribution of the edge set. The second smallest eigenvalue, denoted by λ2 (often called the Fiedler eigenvalue)
is the best measure of the graph's connectivity among all
of the eigenvalues. Large values for λ2 correspond to vertices of high degree that are in close proximity whereas
small values for λ2 correspond to a more equally dispersed
edge set.

Domination based parameters
We calculated a number of graphical invariants for each
tree and tabulated the results. As in the RAG database, the
trees were cataloged by their Fiedler eigenvalues. In so
doing, we noticed that the domination parameters
behaved in two distinct ways with respect to the Fiedler
eigenvalue. The domination, total domination, and global alliance numbers tended to decrease as the eigenvalues
increased.
The
locating-domination
and
differentiating domination numbers tended to increase as
the eigenvalues increased. Thus, we grouped the invariants into two classes and summed the values in each class.
To normalize the results, the sums were divided by the
total number of vertices in the tree, defining the two
parameters P1 and P2 In the case where the invariants
behaved oppositional to the eigenvalues, P2 was modified
in the following way. Instead of dividing by the total
number of vertices in the tree, the Fiedler eigenvalue was

multiplied by the number of vertices and included the
product in the sum. We denote this parameter by P2*. The
three formulas for P1, P1, P2 and P2* are given below and
are used to complete Table 1.

P2 = γ L + γ D + nλ2

As seen above, P1 is the sum of the graphical invariants
that tended to decrease as the Fiedler eigenvalues

increased. The other case is given by P2 and P2 .

Statistical methods
Logistic models were used to predict the probability that a
tree is a native RNA structure based on its domination
numbers. Two different logistic models were estimated
using SAS, one based on P1 and P2(definitions based on
*
domination only) and another one based on P1 and P2

(that considers domination and the second smallest
eigenvalue). Due to the abrupt change from native to not

*
RNA-like for small changes in P1 and P2 or P1 and P2 , the

maximum likelihood estimation process does not converge; however the predicted categories obtained with
those models were correct in 100% of the cases considering the 11 trees that are known to exist as RNA structures.
The estimated values for the parameters correspond to the
last iteration. Logistic models are usually evaluated by the
percent of concordant pairs and the percent of correctly
predicted values; for the two models the percent of con-

cordant pairs and the percent of correct predictions (for
those known to be native or predicted by RAG as 'not
RNA-like') is 100%. The two models are:

is predicted to be native. The values of p obtained with
each one of the two models are very similar and therefore
the predictions as native or not RNA-like for both models
are the same for each the trees. All of the 23 trees whose
status is either 'native' or 'RAG predicted not RNA-like'
were likewise predicted by the two domination models.
From the 4 RAG candidates with 7 vertices (RAG RNAlike, but not yet found as a native structure), 3 are predicted by the domination model as RNA-like and one,
(7.4), as non-RNA like. From the 8 candidates with 8 vertices, 7 are predicted to be native and only one, (8.13), is
predicted as not RNA-like. Table 1 displays the values of
