Effect of reverse transcriptase inhibitors on LINE-1
and Ty1 reverse transcriptase activities and on
LINE-1 retrotransposition
Lixin Dai, Qing Huang and Jef D Boeke*

Abstract
Background: LINE-1s (L1, Long Interspersed Element-1) are the most abundant autonomous non-LTR
retrotransposons in the human genome and replicate by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Full-length
L1 encodes two open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2) and ORF2 has reverse transcriptase activity.
Results: Here we expressed human L1 RT in E. coli and the purified protein displayed the same RT activity as that
of ORF2p expressed in insect cells. We tested the effect of different reverse transcriptase inhibitors on L1 RT and
found that all four tested nucleoside inhibitors efficiently inhibited L1 RT activity competitively. The Ki values of
NRTIs were calculated (AZTTP, 16.4 ± 4.21 nM; d4TTP, 0.73 ± 0.22 nM; ddCTP, 0.72 ± 0.16 nM; 3TCTP, 12.9 ± 2.07
nM). L1 RT was less sensitive to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, among these nevirapine had no
effect, even at concentrations up to 500 μM. We also examined the effect of RT inhibitors on L1 retrotransposition
efficiency in vivo using a cell-based retrotransposition assay. Similarly, all analog inhibitors decreased L1
retrotransposition frequency with different potencies whereas nevirapine had little or no effect on L1
retrotransposition. For comparison, we also tested the same inhibitors to highly purified RT of an LTRretrotransposon (Ty1) and found it was less sensitive to NRTIs than L1 RT and has the same inhibition profile as L1
RT to NNRTIs.
Conclusions: These data indicate that bacterially expressed L1 RT is an active reverse transcriptase sensitive to
nucleoside RT inhibitors but not to non-nucleoside inhibitors.

Background
Long interspersed element-1s (L1 or LINE-1) are nonLTR (Long Terminal Repeat) retrotransposons accounting for ~17% of human DNA [1]. Though most L1
copies are functionally inactive, there are ~80-100 retrotransposition-competent L1s in human genome [2]. L1s
have greatly shaped the human genome by their own
retrotransposition and mobilization of non-autonomous
elements (Alu, SINEs) in trans [3-6]. A full-length L1
element is about 6 kb in length and contains a 5’
untranslated region (UTR), two non-overlapping open
reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), followed by a short 3’
UTR that ends in a poly adenosine tail [7-12]. The product of ORF1 encodes a 40 kDa protein (ORF1p) with
nucleic acid binding and chaperone activities [13-16].

ORF2 encodes a ~150 kDa multifunctional protein
(ORF2p) with endonuclease (EN) [17], reverse transcriptase (RT) activities [18-20] and a cysteine-rich domain
of unknown function [21]. The life cycle of L1 begins
with the transcription of the L1 mRNA, which is
exported to the cytoplasm for translation. L1 proteins
have a strong cis-preference and are proposed to specifically associate with their encoding mRNAs to form an
RNP particle that re-enters the nucleus and integrates
into the genome [22-24]. Several lines of evidence suggest that L1 transposes via a mechanism known as target primed reverse transcription (TPRT) [25], in which
reverse transcription of L1 RNA is the crucial step.
Results from a cell-based retrotransposition assay indicate that L1 retrotransposition depends on active RT
function [25,26]. Full-length human ORF2 protein
expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells has strong
RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase

activities [19,20,25]. Until now, active L1 RT or ORF2p
had not been successfully expressed in prokaryotic hosts
such as E. coli.
It is known that reverse transcriptases are susceptible
to RT inhibitors classified into three types: nucleoside
analog inhibitors (NRTIs), nucleotide analog inhibitors
(NtRTIs), and non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs). The
first two groups of inhibitors are structural analogs of
natural deoxynucleotides and, upon phosphorylation to
the triphosphate form in the cell, compete with dNTPs
for access to the active site of reverse transcriptase.
Since all analog inhibitors lack a 3’-hydroxyl group, they
act as DNA chain terminators and generally have a
broad spectrum of inhibitory activity [27]. The NNRTIs,
on the other hand, are structurally diverse hydrophobic
chemicals that function in a distinct manner. Instead of
being incorporated into the nascent DNA strand, they
specifically bind to a “NNRTI pocket” motif formed by
the HIV-1 RT p66 subunit [28,29]. Binding of NNRTIs
to this motif distorts the nearby HIV-1 RT catalytic site
and thus blocks DNA synthesis. All NNRTIs specifically
inhibit HIV-1 RT activity non-competitively without
themselves being structurally modified in the cell.
Recent publications have indicated that two NNRTIs
(nevirapine and efavirenz) effectively reduce cell proliferation and promote cell differentiation by inhibiting endogenous RT activity [30-32]. They were also found to
inhibit the growth of human tumors in animal models. To
explain these phenomena, it was hypothesized that endogenous RTs might be involved in a mechanism controlling
cell proliferation and differentiation. As the most abundant source of endogenous RTs, L1 was assumed to be the
major target of these RT inhibitors [31]. Separately, previous studies have indicated that nucleoside analog RT
inhibitors (but not NNRTIs) could suppress L1 retrotransposition activity in a tissue culture assay [33,34].
To directly characterize the susceptibility of L1 RT to
various RT inhibitors, we overexpressed and purified
recombinant human L1 reverse transcriptase in E. coli.
Then we tested the effect of NRTIs and NNRTIs on L1
RT directly by a cell-free RT assay. The Ki values of four
NRTIs against L1 RT were determined. We also investigated the effect of these drugs on L1 retrotransposition
frequency using a cell-based retrotransposition assay.
The data from both cell free and tissue culture experiments demonstrated correlated results: all NRTIs inhibited L1 RT activity and retrotransposition efficiency,
whereas nevirapine had no significant effect on L1 RT in
either type of assay.

Results
Protein expression and in vitro RT activity

Human L1 ORF2 encodes 1275 amino acids and contains three functional domains. Among them, the

Page 2 of 11

structure of EN domain (amino acids 1-239) has been
determined [17,35]. The RT domain spans ~1/3 (amino
acids ~380-773) of the ORF2 sequence and the cysteinerich domain starts at amino acid ~1130 (Figure 1a). We
cloned the RT domain from a synthetic human L1 element - ORFeus-Hs [36], which encodes the same amino
acid sequence as native L1 RP , with the linker regions
extended to the boundaries of the EN and C domains
(amino acids 238-1061) into pMal-c2x vector (Figure
1A) and expressed L1 RT as a fusion protein with an
MBP tag located at the N-terminus. The protein had
the expected size of ~140 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Figure
1B). Strong RT activity was detected in both the crude
cell lysate and purified protein by homo-polymer RT
assays. Meanwhile, a control lysate prepared from cells
transformed with empty pMal-c2x vector and purified
MBP-ORF1 protein did not show any RT activity, indicating that the RT activity was L1 RT-derived rather
than from host cell components or the MBP tag. One
unit of RT activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
necessary to catalyze incorporation of 1 nmol dTTP into
poly (rA)-oligo (dT)12-18 in 30 min at 37°C. The specific
activity of purified L1 RT was calculated as 0.375 unit
per μg protein (poly (rA)-oligo (dT) 12-18 primer/template) and 0.094 unit per μg protein (poly (rI)-oligo (dC)
12-18 primer/template).
Effect of RT inhibitors on activities of different reverse
transcriptases

We tested the effect of four NRTIs and three NNRTIs
on HIV-1, L1 and Ty1 reverse transcriptase activities.
As shown in Figure 2A, B, C and 2D, all four triphosphate NRTIs markedly inhibited the activities of HIV-1
and L1 RTs at nM concentrations. Conversely, NRTIs
inhibited Ty1 RT activity at the μM level, if at all. We

also found that Ty1 RT was more sensitive to the thymine analogs than to cytidine analogs. Interestingly,
inhibitors AZTTP, ddCTP and 3TCTP modestly but significantly increased Ty1 RT activity (up to 40%) at low
concentrations.
NNRTIs were previously reported to inhibit HIV-1 RT
activity with different potencies (NVP, K i = 200 nM;
EFV, K i = 2.93 nM; DLV, IC 50 = 260 nM) [29,37,38]
and we observed similar degrees of inhibitory effects on
HIV-1 RT here (Figure 2E, F, G). In contrast, L1 and
Ty1 RTs were inhibited only in the presence of high
concentrations of DLV (50 μM) and EFV (500 μM).
NVP showed no inhibition at concentrations as high as
500 μM. Amino acids K101, V106, Y181, Y188 and
G190 in the HIV-1 RT p66 subunit are believed to be
important for binding NNRTIs [39]. We aligned the
sequences of HIV-1, HIV-2, L1 and Ty1 RTs (Figure
2H) and found the sequences of HIV-2, L1 and Ty1
RTs at above positions were all different from HIV-1
RT, suggesting that the “NNRTI pocket” is absent from
these RTs.
Kinetics of inhibition of L1 RT by NRTIs

Having determined that all NRTIs inhibited L1 RT
activity, we next studied the kinetics of inhibition of
L1 RT by these NRTIs. Poly (rA)-oligo (dT) 12-18 and
[ 32 P]-dTTP were used as template/primers and substrate to assay thymine analogs (AZTTP, d4TTP). Poly
(rI)-oligo (dC)12-18 and [32P]-dCTP were used to assay
cytidine analogs (ddCTP, 3TCTP). The RT assays were
repeated with the same amount of template/primer in
the presence of different amount of substrates and
inhibitors. The results were analyzed by double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots. As expected, inhibition
of L1 RT with respect to both dTTP and dCTP substrates showed classic competitive behavior with no
significant change of the V max (Figure 3). The K m
value for dTTP was 0.83 μM and the apparent K m
values in the presence of 2 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM and 15
nM AZTTP were 0.96 μM, 1.15 μM, 1.27 μM and 1.42
μM respectively. The K i value for AZTTP against L1
RT was calculated as 16.4 ± 4.21 nM (Table 1). The
apparent Km values in the presence of 0.1 nM, 0.2 nM,
0.5 nM and 1 nM d4TTP were 0.95 μM, 0.99 μM, 1.58
μM and 2.15 μM and the Ki value for d4TTP was 0.73
± 0.22 nM. Of the cytosine analogs, the K m value for
dCTP substrate was 0.38 μM and the apparent K m
values in the presence of 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM and 5
nM ddCTP were 0.76 μM, 0.86 μM, 1.34 μM and 2.62
μM. The apparent Km values in the presence of 5 nM,
10 nM, 20 nM and 50 nM 3TCTP were 0.45 μM, 0.69
μM, 0.93 μM and 2.17 μM. The K i values calculated
for ddCTP and 3TCTP were 0.72 ± 0.16 nM and 12.9
± 2.07 nM respectively (Table 1). Since all NRTIs are

Page 4 of 11

competitive inhibitors against L1 RT with respect to
their corresponding natural dNTPs, the IC50 value can
be calculated as IC50 = Ki/(1+ S/Km). The IC50 values
of AZTTP, d4TTP, ddCTP and 3TCTP were calculated
as 19.8 nM, 0.88 nM, 1.04 nM and 18.6 nM.
Effect of RT inhibitors on L1 retrotransposition

To further evaluate the effect of RT inhibitors on L1 in
vivo, we tested L1 retrotransposition in the presence of
these chemicals using an established tissue culture retrotransposition assay. All transposition assays were performed using ORFeus-Hs that encodes wild type ORF1
and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher
frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human
L1 [36]. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, the RT inhibitors had diverse effects on human L1 retrotransposition. All seven NRTIs decreased L1 retrotransposition
with various potencies. AZT and d4T reduced L1 retrotransposition efficiency to similar levels when 5 μM
inhibitors were added to the medium, but d4T had a
stronger effect at higher concentrations (50 μM) (Table
2). The inhibitors 3TC, ddC, and ddI strongly reduced
L1 retrotransposition at a low concentration (5 μM) and
the last two completely abolished L1’s transposition ability. The only NtRTI we tested, bis-POM PMPA, also
reduced the retrotransposition rate to almost zero at 5
μM. NNRTIs DLV and EFV inhibited L1 retrotransposition efficiency by ~72% at concentrations of 50 μM and
5 μM respectively. But nevirapine only decreased L1
transposition frequency by ~10% at all tested concentrations (Figure 4, Table 2). Retrotransposition assays at
higher concentrations of DLV and EFV could not be
carried out due to high levels of seemingly nonspecific
cell death caused by these drugs.

Discussion
Biochemical dissection of the L1 retrotransposition
mechanism necessitates in vitro expression of L1 encoded
ORFs. Thus far, only the function of the EN domain of
ORF2 has been clearly demonstrated in vitro [35], leaving
the RT and cysteine-rich domains less well understood.
Full-length L1 ORF2 protein was previously expressed in
eukaryotic hosts such as yeast and insect cells with relatively low yield and purity [19,40]. We describe a fragment
of the L1 RT expressed in bacterial cells as a highly active
polymerase fusion protein. Ability to detect robust activity
suggests that post-translational modification by eukaryotic
host is not critical to L1 RT activity. Given the efficiency
and simplicity of E. coli expression system, this will allow
extensive follow-up biochemical studies of the L1 retrotransposition mechanism. Recombinant L1 RT expressed
in E. coli displayed strong reverse transcriptase activity
with both homopolyer substrates tested though higher
activity was observed with poly (rA)-oligo (dT)12-18 as

previously seen with L1 ORF2p from insect cells [19].
Furthermore, the specific activity of L1 RT is essentially
the same as that of full-length ORF2p expressed in insect
cells [19] although the bacterially expressed fusion protein
studied here lacks the EN and cysteine-rich domains.
Interestingly, L1 ORF2p expressed in yeast lost 84% RT
activity when amino acids 1-161 were deleted and 50% of
activity when amino acids 952-1275 were removed [40],
suggesting the importance of these two regions to its RT
activity. Similar requirement was reported for recombinant

Ty1 RT, which required C-terminal residues of integrase
for its RT activity [41]. It should be noted that the previously reported L1 ORF2p (yeast) RT activity was measured in the context of a cell-free lysate and at an
extremely low level. Our findings obtained from highly
active and purified protein indicate that EN and cysteinerich domains are dispensable for RT function although we
cannot exclude the possibility that the N-terminal MBP
tag may act as a substitute for one of the two domains,
helping the RT fold into active conformation. Indeed, we
were not successful at retaining RT activity following proteolytic removal of the MBP tag, consistent with its importance in solubility and/or activity of the protein.
Expression of the highly active L1 RT allows in vitro
biochemical comparisons of reverse transcriptases from
phylogenetically related non-LTR retrotransposons and
LTR-retrotransposons. Direct comparison under the
same assay condition revealed that L1 and HIV-1 RTs
are distinct from one another and have distinct interaction patterns with RT inhibitors. Both RTs were markedly inhibited by NRTIs and displayed similar

susceptibilities to d4TTP and 3TCTP. Compared to
HIV-1 RT, L1 RT was less sensitive to AZTTP but
more sensitive to ddCTP. Obvious differences were
observed for NNRTIs that inhibited HIV-1 RT activity,
as expected [29,38,42] but had little effect on L1 RT. It
is notable that the recombinant Ty1 RT was less susceptible to all RT inhibitors tested in this study. The
recombinant Ty1 RT used here is essentially the same
as that used in a previous publication [41] but its specific activity with poly (rA)-oligo (dT)12-18 and poly (rI)oligo (dC)12-18 template/primer is several times higher
than that using poly (rC)-oligo (dG) 12-18 (data not
shown) [41]. Previous studies have indicated that the
guanosine analog ddGTP decreases Ty1 RT activity by
90% when the ratio of ddGTP/GTP reaches 0.2 [41,43].
In this work Ty1 RT activity was inhibited only when
the concentrations of inhibitors were several thousand
times higher than the native substrate. It is known that
reverse transcriptases react differently to inhibitors
using different types of template/primer. Perhaps the
resistance of Ty1 RT to inhibitors is due to the different
effects of template/oligo mixes, while it is also possible
that adenosine and cytidine analogs are not recognized
efficiently by recombinant Ty1 RT.
The RT inhibitor AZT was reported to suppress L1
retrotransposition in the cell-based retrotranspostion
assay [34,44]. In this study we have illustrated the effect
of eleven different RT inhibitors on L1 retrotransposition frequency, which is correlated with data obtained
from in vitro RT assay. For example, AZT with a higher
Ki inhibited the L1 retrotransposition less proficiently
than d4T with a lower Ki value, and the same pattern
was observed for cytidine analogs. Both thymine analogs
are relatively weak inhibitors of L1 retrotransposition
compared to HIV-1, whose production is completely
inhibited by 1-3 μM AZT [45]. Cytidine analogs (ddC,
3TC) and ddI, on the other hand, have strong inhibitory
effects comparable to those on HIV. This significant difference may be caused by the metabolism of these inhibitors in vivo since the triphosphate form of 3TC and
ddC were found to be ten times of that of AZT in the
cell [46]. We have also tested these RT inhibitors on the
retrotransposition of a highly active synthetic mouse L1
(ORFeus-Mm) [47,48]. The obtained results show the
same inhibition profile observed with ORFeus-Hs: all
NRTIs inhibit L1 retrotransposition, yet NVP doesn’t
inhibit ORFeus-Mm retrotransposition profoundly, even
at high concentrations (Table 3). Though synthetic
LINE-1 elements (ORFeus) were used in this study, they
all encode the same amino acid sequences as wild-type
L1s and their retrotransposition is fully dependent on
RT function.
Phylogenetic evidence also suggests that non-analog
inhibitors are specific to HIV-1 RT and ineffective

against other polymerases. Sequence alignment of HIV-1
p66, HIV-2, L1 and Ty1 RTs indicates the positions
important for NNRTI binding are highly variable. These
substitutions change not only the conformation but also
the electronic charge of the NNRTI binding motif, such
as the replacement of lysine (basic) by phenylalanine
(acidic, aromatic) by L1 at position 101. It is known that
HIV-2 is resistant to NNRTIs because of the destruction
of “NNRTI pocket” motif [39]. Various studies have
indicated that substitutions at positions 103, 106, 181,
188 and 190 are the most common HIV-1 mutants that
reduce NVP susceptibility more than 50 fold [49]. In
addition, NVP and EFV are inactive against a variety of
polymerases including AMV RT, MLV RT, human DNA
polymerases a, b, g and Klenow fragment [29,38]. HIV-1
mutants resistant to EFV normally have substitutions at
positions 101 and 103 suggesting EFV may contact a
smaller surface of the RT [38]. This may explain our
observation that EFV still inhibits L1 RT activity but
with lower effectiveness. Taken together, our results
above suggest that nevirapine is specific to HIV-1 RT
and does not inhibit L1 RT activity both in vitro and in
vivo. Given this, we conclude that the reported anti-

tumor function of NVP and EFV is due to another
mechanism distinct from inhibition of endogenous L1
RT activity. An alternative anti-tumor mechanism may
result from the cytotoxicity of RT inhibitors since EFV
and DLV were found to cause massive HeLa cell death
at concentrations of 50 μM and 100 μM respectively.

Conclusion
In summary, we report the expression and purification
of recombinant human L1 RT in bacterial host cells for
the first time. The protein has the same reverse transcriptase activity as the full-length ORF2 expressed from
insect cells suggesting no host specific modifications are
required for RT activity. We have tested the effect of
different RT inhibitors against L1 RT activity and retrotransposition by in vitro (cell-free) and in vivo (tissue
culture) analyses. The data presented here indicated that
L1 RT is sensitive to NRTIs but NNRTIs inhibit L1 RT
less efficiently. Nevirapine, an RT inhibitor with
reported anti-tumor function, has no effect on L1 RT
activity.

Template/primer mix poly (rA)-oligo (dT)12-18, poly (rI)
and oligo (dC)12-18 were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX, USA). [a- 32 P]
dTTP and [a-32P] dCTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc. (Waltham, MA,
USA). Transfection reagent Fugene 6 was purchased
from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN, USA).
All RT inhibitors were first made as 100 mM stock solutions. d4T, bis-POM PMPA, NVP, DLV, EFV were dissolved in pure DMSO and other chemicals were
dissolved in water. Template/primer mix poly (rI)-oligo
(dC)12-18 was made by mixing poly (rI) and oligo (dC)1218 according to Cheng et al [50].
Plasmids

Synthetic human L1 ORF2 sequences were created by
following a codon optimization procedure as previously
described [47], and were ligated into pBluescript KS(-)
(Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to make pWA112.
To make pWA195, pCEP puro was first made by
replacing the hygromycin resistance cassette pCEP4
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with a 1.7 kb Sal I fragment
of puromycin resistance cassette from pPGKpuro (a gift
from Dr. Peter Laird). Plasmid pCEPpurosmL1 was
made by replacing the pCEP4 backbone with pCEPpuro
using NotI/BamHI sites. Plasmid pWA195 was made by
replacing smL1 in pCEPpurosmL1 with the synthetic
human L1 coding sequence from pBSshL1.
Plasmid pLD48 was constructed by PCR amplification of
pWA112 with the primers JB11578 (5’-CCGGATCCCGCATCAAGAACCTGACCCAGAGCC-3’) and JB11584
(5’-ACGCGTCGACTTAGTAGATCTGCTTCAGCTC
GTTGTAG-3’), digestion of the product with BamHI and
SalI, and cloning of the product into BamH I and Sal I
sites of pMal-c2x (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Human L1
ORF2 amino acid 238-1061 was inserted behind MBP
gene in frame, and a “TAA“ stop codon was introduced at
the end of the insert. Plasmid pMal-ORF1 was constructed
by cloning full-length human L1 ORF1 into the BamHI
and SalI sites of pMal-c2x plasmid. Both constructs were
confirmed by sequencing.
pQH1 was constructed by subcloning a DNA fragment containing the last 115 amino acids of Ty1 integrase and full-length RT-RH from pGEX-4T-3 [51] into
the NdeI and PstI sites of the pCold I plasmid (Takara,
Japan).
Expression and purification of human L1 and Ty1 RTs

MBP tagged L1 RT was overexpressed and purified
according to the protocol provided by NEB. Plasmid
pLD48 was transformed into E. coli BL21 cell and plated
on LB with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. 200 ml LB medium
(0.2% glucose, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin) was inoculated
with a 2 ml overnight culture and grown at 37°C with

Page 8 of 11

shaking to an OD600 of 0.3, followed by induction with 0.5
mM IPTG for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 minutes and the supernatant
was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 5 ml column
buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA) and lysed on ice with sonication with five bursts of
15 sec. The lysate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 mins
and the supernatant was loaded onto 1 ml amylose resin,
which was washed with 10 ml column buffer and then the
fusion protein was eluted with column buffer with 10 mM
maltose. The majority of protein eluted in the first two
fractions, which were pooled and concentrated using a
Centricon YM-100. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50% and enzyme was stored at -20°C.
pQH1 was co-transformed with chaperone plasmid
pG-Tf2 (Takara, Japan) into E. coli BL21 cell. Cells were
grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of
carbenicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 1 ng/ml
tetracycline until A 600 reached 0.4. After 30 minutes
incubation at 15°C, expression of recombinant Ty1 RT
was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The cells were further
cultured for 24 hours at 15°C, harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Recombinant Ty1 RT was
sequentially purified on a HisTrap chelating column, a
desalting column, a cation exchange column, a Superdex
200 gel filtration column, and again on a HisTrap chelating column with an Äkta FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Eluted protein from the last
step of purification was dialyzed overnight into the dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM TCEP),
concentrated to 6 mg/ml as measured by Bio-Rad Bradford assay, and stored at -80°C in 50 μl aliquots.
In vitro RT assay

The RT assays for HIV-1 and L1 RT were performed in
a 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mM Tris-Cl
(pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DDT, 0.01
U template/primer, 1 μl [a-32P] dTTP or [a-32P] dCTP
(final concentration 0.17 μM, 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/
ml) at 37°C for 30 min. Then the mixture was spotted
on DE81 paper and washed three times with 2×SSC buffer for a total time of 30 min. The DE81 paper was
dried and counted by scintillation counter Beckman
LS6000SC. RT assay for Ty1 RT was done under the
same buffer condition except that 20 mM MgCl2 was
used and the reaction mixture was incubated at room
temperature. In each reaction the amounts of L1, HIV-1
and Ty1 RTs with the same specific activity were added.
To test the inhibition of the RT inhibitors, 1 μl inhibitor
was included in the mixture to obtain the desired concentration. In testing the effect of NVP, DLV and EFV,
1 μl pure DMSO was added in the positive control reaction. All assays were done at least in triplicate.

Kinetic analysis of NRTIs

The kinetic analysis was performed under the same conditions described above but with various concentrations
of substrates and inhibitors as indicated in the text. Poly
(rA)-oligo (dT)12-18 and [a-32P] dTTP were used to analyze AZTTP and d4TTP. Poly (rI)-oligo (dC)12-18 and
[a-32P] dCTP were used to assay ddCTP and 3TCTP.
Cell culture and L1 retrotransposition assay

The cell-based retrotransposition assay was conducted
as described [26]. HeLa cells (a gift from Dr. John
Moran, University of Michigan) were seeded in 6-well
dishes in DMEM (2×105 cells/well). The next day cells
were transfected with Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer’s manual. Each transfection consisted of 96 μl
Opti-Mem, 1 μg pWA195 DNA and 3 μl Fugene 6. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized
and transferred to a 6 cm plate in DMEM with 2.5 μg/
ml puromycin and the RT inhibitors. Three days after
puromycin selection, dead cells were removed and puromycin resistant cells were trypsinized and counted with
a hemocytometer. The puromycin resistant cells were
plated on a 10 cm plate (1×10 4 cells/plate) in 10 ml
DMEM with 500 μg/ml G418. The RT inhibitors were
added to the same concentration as in the puromycin
selection. For assays of d4T, bis-POM PMPA, NVP,
EFV and DLV, the same amount of DMSO (final conc
<0.01%) was added to the control plate. Two weeks
later, G418 resistant cells were fixed to the plate and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number of G418
resistant colonies was counted to calculate retrotransposition frequency. Six independent assays were done for
each RT inhibitor.
Cell cytotoxicity of RT inhibitors

Untransfected Hela cells were plated on 10 cm plate
(500 cells/plate) with and without RT inhibitors. Ten
days later, cells were fixed to the plate and stained with
0.1% crystal violet. The number of colonies was counted
to calculate colony formation ability. Colony formation
ability of control assay without inhibitors was considered
as 1.0 and colony formation ability in the presence of
inhibitors was indicated as relative efficiency with
respect to the control.
Sequence alignment

The RT sequences of HIV-1, HIV-2, L1 and Ty1 RTs
were aligned automatically by Clustal X [52] and manually adjusted according to Shaharabany et al [53] and
Wilhelm et al [41].
