Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus
and pseudomonas phage PS5 triad share
epitopes of immunogenic determinants
Zhabiz Golkar, Nusrat Jamil*

Abstract
A lytic phage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the Myoviridea family was isolated from urine for use in therapeutics. Pair of hepatitis C virus (HCV) primers highlighted segments on the genome of this phage. The sequence
of these PCR products as well as the possible serological cross reactivity/relationship between HCV and the phage
were investigated. One hundred HCV positive human sera were analyzed by ELISA. Ninety six well plates were
coated with multiple epitopes of HCV proteins (Kit), phage and Pseudomonas cells. Initially the positive and negative control sera supplied in the test kit were used to evaluate the cross reactivity between the phage and antiHCV antibodies. The results suggested a value over than 0.105 for a HCV positive reaction. Of the 100 HCV positive
sera tested, sixty five and thirty percent showed cross reaction with phage lysate and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
respectively. High HCV antibody titer correlated to high cut off value for phage cross reaction, whereas no such correlation existed between HCV antibody titer and Pseudomonas cross reaction. The PCR products were sequenced
and aligned with the HCV genome of H77. Sequence homology was detected in the 5’, 3’ UTRs and NS3 regions.
Further these products showed similarity with HIV-1 Env, Pol & 3’LTR regions as well.
Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently infects an estimated
3% of people worldwide encodes several proteins. HCV
displays numerous interactions with the immune systems. Consequently a number of auto-antibodies are
observed during the course of hepatitis C [1]. Many studies have detected the presence of antibodies reactive to
a cloned host derived auto-antigen GOR and are highly
correlated with the presence of antibodies to HCV. In
chronic hepatitis C presence of these cross reactive antibodies is not merely due to sequence homology but also
due to cross reactivity at the molecular level [2-5]. Antibody antigen reactions usually occur when an antigen
combines with a corresponding antibody to produce an
immune complex [6]. Specificity of this reaction refers
to the ability of an individual antibody combining site to
react with only one antigenic determinant or the ability
of a population of antibody molecules to react with only
one antigen. In general, there is a high degree of specificity in the antigen-antibody reactions [7]. However,

cross reactivity refers to the ability of an individual antibody combining site to react with more than one antigenic determinant or the ability of a population of
antibody molecules to react with more than one antigen
[8]. Antigen antibody reaction is highly specific in some
cases whereas cross reactivity is exhibited due to sharing
of antigenic determinants by two unrelated microbes.
For example, cross reactive anti HCV antibodies triggered by an epitope on HCV core protein which exhibits
homology with auto antigen GOR 47-1 epitope. Similarly anti GOR antibodies, distinct from anti HCV core
antibodies were revealed to have dual specificities. They
target both the core gene product and host liver cell
components [9]. Another cross reactive epitope shared
by HCV NS3 protein and Influenza A (IV) virus. NS31073 and influenza neuraminidase peptides displayed a
high degree of sequence homology. These determinants
are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes with similar
affinity. These heterologous antigens induce cross reactive CD8+ T cells [10].
The reasons for the cross-reactivity between Pseudomonas phage lysate and human HCV positive sera are
not known. We are the first to observe cross reactivity

between HCV positive sera and newly isolated Pseudomonas phage antigens. The present study was undertaken to determine the reason for the cross reactivity or
the non-specific reaction between HCV positive sera
and the phage antigen. The findings are presented in
this report.

Materials and methods
i. Determination of phage activity in clinical sample on
bacterial lawn

Urine sample (50.ml) of a patient was centrifuged at
6000 rpm to remove solid matter and was then filter
sterilized through a 0.45 μm membrane. 50 μl of the
urine filtrate and 100 μl of 4 hrs young culture of Pseudomona aeruginosa were added to 3 ml of melted L.B
soft agar and plaque assayed. All phages were purified
by successive single plaque isolation until homogeneous
plaques were obtained.
ii. Isolation of phage from clinical specimen

One ml of the 4 hrs young culture of the respective
hosts (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P5& P6 strains), E. coli,
E. coli4MD, E. coli-N all local strains) was mixed with
100 μl of urine, incubated for 2 hrs. at 37°C and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed
twice with 500 μl of LB broth and suspended in 500 μl
broth. E.coli lysogen cells exposed to UV for 1 min and
incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs. The lysate was filtered, sterilized and plaque assay was performed.
ii. Transmission Electron Microscopy

Particle morphology was studied by precipitating the
lysate with PEG 6000 (Promega Co.) and NaCl to final
concentration of 8% and 4%, respectively and incubated
at 4°C overnight. The pellet resuspended in 100 μl of
double de-ionized distill water. Four hundred (400) mesh
carbon coated grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 seconds and examined in a GOELJEM-1200 EX II transmission electron microscope.

was added to the coated wells and incubated for 1 hr. at
37°C. Assay was done as suggested by AutoBio Diagnostic Co.
v. Coating of ELISA 96 wells plate by Pseudomonas cells:

The bacteria were scooped off from the lawn on BHI
agar, washed several times with PBS buffer and a100 μl
of cell suspension (1:10 in coating buffer) was added
into each well of the ELISA plate and assay was
performed.
vi. Phage DNA purification

DNA was extracted by using Promega kit.
vii. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification

Phage DNA was isolated from lysates PS5 F, and used
as PCR templates. PCR products were generated using
Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Co.) by following the
manufacture’s protocols. A range of primer sets were
used (Table 1) The PCR conditions used were denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing temperature
as 58°C (for C1& C3) and 60°C (for Ac2 & Sc2) for 30
seconds and finally extension at 72°C for 2 min. Amplified products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed.
viii. DNA sequencing

Amplified PCR products separated by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and fragments were selected and purified
for sequencing. The selected PCR mixtures were prepared in 50 μl for each reaction and amplified products
sequenced using the original amplification primers.

Results
In this study, phages were isolated from the urine of a
24 years old female athlete with E. coli urinary tract
infection (UTI). (Figure 1). Electron microscopy indicated the presence of Siphoviridiae and Myoviridiae-like
morphology in the initial lysates prepared by using

iii. Desalting of lysate by micro dialysis

Desalting of the phage suspension was carried out in an
Eppendrof tube with the cap replaced with 2 cm of dialysis membrane that was held by a rubber band and
floated in cold sterile distilled water in upside-down
position. Water was changed after one hour and dialysis
continued overnight at 4°C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (PS5) as host bacteria.
Phage was further purified by single plaque assay (Figure 2).
The presence of E. coli and lytic phages of Pseudomonas
in the urine sample indicated the lysogenic status of
E. coli which seems to be infected with a temperate
phage which was lytic for Pseudomonas specie.
C1, C3 primers present in our collection were used
contingently to highlight the PCR product from the
amplified phage genome. Presence of discrete bands of
640-1169 bps (Figure four, lane 6 & 7; Table 2) warranted
us to evaluate possible genetic or serological relation

between phage and HCV. In order to confirm the possible serological cross-reactivity/relation, between phage
and HCV +ve anti-sera, ELISA and PCR were performed.
Interestingly HCV positive control provided in the kit
showed a strong reaction on phage coated plate (Figure 3).
It was found that 83% of HCV positive sera tested reacted
to the phage coated plate. This value is comparable to
validity of HCV antigen coated plate. It has been shown
that presence of antibodies in HCV positive sera is highly
correlated with respective antigens Core/NS as indicated
with ELISA (Figure 3)

Similarly the ranges for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa
cross reactions with HCV positive sera (Figure 3) were
found to be in the order of 30% sera. A plausible reason
for the high Pseudomonas cutoff value for a HCV +ve
serum (OD = 0.13) could be attributed to invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa secondary infection in this patient.
However a correlation between the HCV antibody titer
and high cutoff value due to phage lysate was observed
(Figure 3). This was further strengthened by the antigenic
relation between phage and HCV in addition to the secondary infections of Pseudomonas in the HCV patients.
Results of ELISA suggest a serological relation
between cascade (NS3, NS5, and Core) and Ps. phage
(PS5 F). The enhanced ELISA cutoff value of phage
lysate compared with Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell suggested significant cross-reactivity of HCV antibodies and
phage antigens. High cut off value for cross reaction
between phage antigen and 83% of the HCV sero-positive samples reflects the possible sequence similarities
between antigen determinant region in the HCV genome and the phage genome.

The HCV 5’-UTR specific primers and universal primers (Ac2, Sc2, A5 and S7) were used to highlight the
genome segment of Pseudomonas phage (PS5F) (Figure
4). These PCR products were sequenced and compared
by Quick Alignment data exhibited the similarity among
different HCV genotypes database (1a, 2a, 1b, 2b); (Figure 4). Gene locator software has highlighted reverse
complement of nucleotide position (Similarity 90%) on
3’-UTR, 5’-UTR and NS3 region of H77 (shown as black
bar in Figure 5A, C, 6A, B).
Preliminary data suggests that HCV 3’-UTR binds cellular proteins such as the 52 kDa La auto-antigen, the
57 kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, and other
proteins [12]. These results predict that isolated PS5 F
may have regulatory machinery similar to HCV type
translation-regulation. The similarity of phage translation-regulation regions and regulatory 5’and 3’-UTRs of
HCV was substantiated by Quick Align and Gene locator analysis using non-HCV primers Reverse and Forward, (Table 2; Figure 5B) designed in our laboratory.
This analysis showed variable matched size of PS5 F

and 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR regulatory region of HCV
genome.
It is worth noting that, 5’-UTR and the extreme end
of the 3’-UTR of HCV have the lowest sequence diversity among various genotypes and subtypes. The relatively conserved nature of these regions is significant
in their functional importance in the life cycle of the
virus [13].
Quick Align and Gene locator analysis of PCR products of F genome raised by HCV 5’-UTR specific primers have highlighted the region of phage that has
similarity with domain I and II of 5’-UTR of HCV genome (Figure 5B & 6). This un-translated, conserved
region is involved in viral RNA translation and plays an
important role in replication as well [14]. Analyses of
the results have shown the similarity on region of 3’UTR (Figure 5B, 6A, B), all these PCR products except
(Figure 6A raised by Sc2) raised by C1 or C3 5’UTR
specific primers. (Figure 5C & 6B) showed homologous
region extended into NS5B 3’ end. These products were
raised by C1+C3 pair. (Figure 5A & 7A) indicated
homologous region on NS3 of HCV and Env of HIV.
These viral regions are highlighted by a PCR product of
PS5F genome raised by Ac2 primer. (Figure 7) Exhibited relation between phage PCR product with HIV Pol
gene. (Figure 7B) indicated the similarity between U5
regions of 3’LTR of HIV with PCR product raised by C3
primer of HCV. The comparative analysis confirmed
that PS5 F has got the flexible regions on the genome,
which is similar to the 5’-UTR IRES of HCV RNA, and
may involved in the cap-independent translation.

Discussion
Most of the PCR products raised by 5’UTR specific primers (C1, C3; Table 1, 2), highlighted from phage

Page 5 of 10

genome showed homology with 3’ UTR region of HCV
(Figure 5C, 6B). The entire 3’UTR is matched with these
PCR products. However (Figure 5C & 6B) exhibited
homologous region extended into NS5B’s 3’ end. A
stretch of 398 nts (reverse complement) of PS5F genome is similar to not only 3’ UTR but 3’ end of HCV
genomic RNA. This homology has reflected significant
value, since the conserved sequence and stem and loop
structures of HCV function as cis acting signals that
interact with viral and cellular proteins to initiate the
synthesis of minus strand RNA during viral replication
[15]. Recently Cristina [16], (2009) demonstrated the
role of stem loop structure at 3’ end of RNA, the 5BSL
3.2 motif which is embedded in cruciform structure at
3’ end of NS5B coding sequence contribute to the 3 D
folding of the entire 3’ end of the HCV genome. It is
essential in the initiation of replication. Presence of such
functional/structural sequence in DNA genome of phage
remains elusive and provides the incentive for
investigation.
PCR product of PS5F genome raised by Ac2 HCV
primer (Table 1 & 2) exhibited sequence to NS3 at the
HCV genome’s location 4508¬4636 (reverse complement) Figure 5B. Interestingly same PCR product is
homologous to HIV genome at the location
7469®7600, which specify envelop gene (Figure 7).
These 131 nts are highlighting the gp 120 outer-domain
(OD) variable region comprised of several important
immune epitopes. However V3 immuno dominance is
the property of OD immunogens [17,18]. This stretch of
F genome provides the compelling genetic evidence of
sharing of some functional determinant between NS3
central domain and HIV gp120 region V3.
Large body of data indicated the implications of NS3/
4A on adaptive immune response which cause inhibition
of cytokines/chemokines [19]. Similarly gp120 interaction with cell chemokine receptor CCRS5 and CXCR4
are the key events for HIV-1 infection [20,21]. These
results presented herein providing insight into possible
mechanism by which HCV can acquires tissue tropism
and can infect lymphoid cells i.e. monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore this shared region of HCV and
HIV-1 is immunogenic can induce neutralizing antibodies [22,23]. These antibodies could be cross reactive
too. Phillip [24] demonstrated the highly processive helicase activity on DNA by NS3. Presumably this may have
the capacity to effect HIV DNA phase.
According to our results one of the PCR product raised
by single primer Sc2 of HCV highlighting the PS5F genome segment homologous to HIV Pol gene at a location
of HXB2 genome 3046¬3273 (Figure 7). This segment
of 227 nucleotides is a reverse complement and is complementary to the entire palm sub domain of HIV reverse
transcriptase (RT). It is interesting to note that this sub

domain of RT carries active site for replication [25-28].
Previous analysis of retroviral RT has indicated that palm
domain in addition to finger and thumb sub domains
facilitate the flow of genetic information moving in the
reverse direction. It is worth to note that DNA genome
of PS5F carries homologous sequence to palm sub

domain of RT provide the insight into phylogenetic
niches between this triad, HIV, HCV and DNA genome.

2 bands on DNA gel (Figure 4, lane 2, 4); Analysis of
the data from the first band showed similarity with

HCV genome. A stretch of 128 nts exhibited similarity
with NS3 region of HCV genome. The non-structural
protein NS3, which is an essential component of HCV
replication complex, is a protease that mediates NS2/3
cleavage. Serological cross-reaction between phage and
HCV positive sera was found to be related to the presence of NS3 and this was further substantiated with
HCV-Quick Align analysis of the PCR products (Figure 2).
Clustal W alignment of the PCR products raised by Ac2
and retrieved NS3 sequence has confirmed that this
homology is present close to N-terminal of NS3 region.
Therefore, we predict that the genome of phage PS5 may
code a protein having similar domain to NS3.
Epidemiological data shows that many HCV-infected
patients are co-infected by HIV. Despite their remarkable differences, HIV and HCV share common characteristics (genetic, replicative, and pathological) that make
real their interaction and facilitate the exacerbation of

their related diseases [29]. It has been reported that
hyper variable region of the NS1 protein of HCV may
share similarities with the hyper-variable region of the
envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus HIV
[30]. These results are in accordance to our finding as
V3 region of envelop of HIV share determinant with
NS3 of HCV. Serological tests and sequencing have
shown that Pseudomonas phage (PS5 F) has similar
antigenic epitopes to HCV and HIV variable immunogenic regions which contribute in complexity and diversity of these viruses. Previous reports have been
demonstrated that a high proportion of blood donors
exhibited false positive anti HCV antibodies [31].
Recently Jung-ah Kwon [32] used microarray assay for
HCV detection and found same false results in few individuals. Therefore it can be concluded that PS5F presence in an individual may attribute to false positive
results despite higher diagnostic accuracy of HCV/HIV

Golkar and Jamil Virology Journal 2010, 7:346

infection. A healthy individual having this phage may
unnecessarily receive interferon or antiviral drug. Therefore, diagnosis should be based strictly on HCV antigen
detection and sequence analysis of the PCR products.
Based on computational analysis indicating 3’-UTR, 5’UTR, NS3 of HCV and V3 of OD, palm sub domain of RT
and U5 of 3’ LTR of HIV are homologous with genome
segments of PS5F. Which predicts that the genome of the
Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage share similar regulatory
stem and loop structure or common functional domains
with the HIV/HCV genome. This can facilitate proteinprotein interaction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Horizontal transfer of genetic material between distantly related prokaryotes has been shown to play a
major role in the evolution of bacterial genomes, but
exchange of genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
is not as well understood [33] and it cannot be ignored.
In this context, studies of retroviruses could be the
best example illustrating the first demonstrated synthesis
of DNA from RNA templates, a fundamental mode for
transferring genetic material that occurs in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. It has been noted that retrovirus
infection which, introduces additional viral oncogenes
into the cells, and transformed proteins leads to the
conversion of normal cells to tumor cells [34,35].
Through this genetic mixing retrovirus and animal
cells have been swapping genes for millions of years
[36]. There is best circumstantial evidence suggesting
retroviruses has been involved in other major evolutionary innovation too. McIntoch [37] (2008) proposed that
the genes of DNA viruses were recruited in the evolution of eukaryotic machinery. Current work is consistent
with this finding as PS5F has DNA genome carry a
stretch of sequence homologous to entire palm sub
domain of HIV RT, in fact exhibiting the evolutionary
niches of most unrelated organism. Recent advances in
understanding the molecular relation of host-pathogen
and their interactions which highlighted the role in
microbial evolution could play a significant role in the
emergence of bacterial pathogens.
The exchange of genes between phage and virus
should be visualized in this scenario. HIV/HCV patients
are prone to any infections. Pseudomonas is a very common etiologic agent in infections particularly of the
urinary and respiratory tracts. Therefore the body of
HIV/HCV patient could be the re-union site for these
prokaryotes i.e. phage and virus for the exchange of
genetic material. Their flexible nucleic acids defiantly
have their own modification to evade the nucleases of
the host. HCV, HIV and PS5F triad proposed that
fluxes of genetic material between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes cannot be ruled out.
Finally, recent research by the virology and cell biology communities have developed the understanding of

Page 9 of 10

the co-infection (HCV/HIV) implication on complexity
and diversity of HCV by ignoring other bacterial pathogens and their respective phages. Present study predicts
that co-infection (HCV/HIV) with Pseudomonas phage
PS5F may result in a higher rate of viral persistence.
This may enhance the predisposing factors for complexity and diversity for HCV.
