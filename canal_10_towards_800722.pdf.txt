Towards the simplification of MHC typing
protocols: targeting classical MHC class II genes
in a passerine, the pied flycatcher Ficedula
hypoleuca

Abstract
Background: Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) has drawn the attention of evolutionary biologists due to
its importance in crucial biological processes, such as sexual selection and immune response in jawed vertebrates.
However, the characterization of classical MHC genes subjected to the effects of natural selection still remains
elusive in many vertebrate groups. Here, we have tested the suitability of flanking intron sequences to guide the
selective exploration of classical MHC genes driving the co-evolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their
passerine (Aves, Order Passeriformes) hosts.
Findings: Intronic sequences flanking the usually polymorphic exon 2 were isolated from different species using
primers sitting on conserved coding regions of MHC class II genes (b chain). Taking the pied flycatcher Ficedula
hypoleuca as an example, we demonstrate that careful primer design can evade non-classical MHC gene and
pseudogene amplification. At least four polymorphic and expressed loci were co-replicated using a single pair of
primers in five non-related individuals (N = 28 alleles). The cross-amplification and preliminary inspection of similar
MHC fragments in eight unrelated songbird taxa suggests that similar approaches can also be applied to other
species.
Conclusions: Intron sequences flanking the usually polymorphic exon 2 may assist the specific investigation of
classical MHC class II B genes in species characterized by extensive gene duplication and pseudogenization.
Importantly, the evasion of non-classical MHC genes with a more specific function and non-functional
pseudogenes may accelerate data collection and diminish lab costs. Comprehensive knowledge of gene structure,
polymorphism and expression profiles may be useful not only for the selective examination of evolutionarily
relevant genes but also to restrict chimera formation by minimizing the number of co-amplifying loci.

Background
For the last two decades, the Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) has drawn the attention of evolutionary biologists due to its importance in crucial biological
processes, such as sexual selection and immune
response in jawed vertebrates (reviewed in [1-3]). Classical MHC genes, unlike those classified as non-classical,
usually display extensive levels of genetic variability and
ubiquitous expression patterns [4]. Among classical

MHC loci, most research has focused on the second
and third exons of class I genes and the second exon of
class II B genes because of their traditional consideration as primary targets of pathogen-mediated selection.
These highly polymorphic exons encode the extracellular domains that bind and present foreign peptides (antigens) to specialised CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes.
Subsequently, the recognition of the complex MHC
molecule-foreign antigen by T-lymphocytes triggers
adaptive immunity [5].
The characterization of classical MHC genes subjected
to the effects of natural selection still remains elusive in

extremely dynamic multigene family characterized by
frequent gene duplication and loss, presence of pseudogenes, gene conversion and chromosome reorganization
[7-11]. Such complex evolutionary patterns could
account for the substantial variation reported in MHC
architecture and genome organization between and
within different vertebrate groups [12,13,11,14], and
sometimes even within the same species [15,16]. Like
other multigene families, the MHC is thought to be the
subject of both birth-and-death and concerted evolution,
yet the distinction between the two evolutionary models
is sometimes difficult and controversial [17]. The birthand-death model implies the creation of new genes by
gene duplication, some of them being functionally
retained in the genome for long time periods whereas
others become inactivated (pseudogenes) or deleted
from the genome. The concerted evolution hypothesis
predicts that MHC genes evolve as a unit, mainly
because of repeated gene conversion events across different members of the gene family [17]. The implications of different forms of multigene family evolution
are nevertheless crucial for MHC genotyping.
A prominent role of the birth-and-death evolutionary
model has been typically associated with the mammalian
MHC. Due to the independent evolution of MHC genes
during long periods, MHC alleles usually form clusters
according to loci. Such clusters allow tracing of orthologous relationships within and between different mammalian lineages [18,19]. This phenomenon has indeed
facilitated the design of locus-specific primers across different mammalian groups (e.g. [20-22]). Non-mammalian lineages, on the other hand, usually exhibit a lack of
orthologous relationships even on short evolutionary
time scales [7,19]. In those groups, MHC sequences
commonly fail to cluster according to loci [23-25], and,
consequently, the assignment of alleles to particular
genes becomes challenging. This phenomenon has been
mainly attributed to concerted evolution that manifests
in the homogenization of DNA sequences among different loci [26,17]. Therefore, high rates of concerted
evolution hinder MHC typing protocols due to coamplification of multiple loci (e.g. [27,23]) and increased
risk of chimera formation during PCR amplification
[28]. Taxa exhibiting extraordinarily high numbers of
gene duplications and pseudogenes, such as songbirds
and some fish, may be especially problematic [29-33].
Degenerate primers targeting conserved coding
regions of exon 2 have proven successful for the isolation of MHC class II B sequences in non-model avian
species [34,35,27,23]. Particularly in passerines, degenerate primers are expected to target (multiple) classical
MHC genes, non-classical MHC genes and even pseudogenes (e.g. [36,32,33]). In this respect, a focus on evolutionarily relevant loci is needed in these species to

diminish both laboratory efforts and costs. Despite
strong evidence of concerted evolution in the avian
MHC [37,23,31], a few studies in birds have demonstrated that comprehensive knowledge of gene structure
can be critical for the design of locus-specific primers
that amplify the entire coding sequence of the targeted
exon 2 [10,38-41]. In this study, we have applied a
multi-step PCR approach to obtain genomic MHC
sequences in passerines (including both introns and
exons). Our main goal was to test the suitability of
flanking intron sequences to assist the specific amplification of the entire coding sequence of exon 2 from classical MHC class II B genes in passerines, a particularly
challenging group regarding MHC genes.

Methods
Study Species

We used the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (Aves:
Muscicapidae) as a model species. We also used eight
non-related species to get a preliminary glimpse about
the suitability of our molecular approach across other
songbird families. The selected species were the white
wagtail Motacilla alba (Motacillidae), the common
raven Corvus corax (Corvidae), the European robin
Erithacus rubecula (Muscicapidae), the woodchat shrike
Lanius senator (Laniidae), Dupont’s lark Chersophilus
duponti (Alaudidae), the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala (Sylviidae), the trumpeter finch Bucanetes
githagineus (Fringillidae) and the chiffchaff Phylloscopus
collibita (Phylloscopidae).
DNA and RNA extraction

Genomic DNA from five unrelated pied flycatchers was
extracted from blood samples using the E.Z.N.A Blood
extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, GA, USA). We used the
HotSHOT protocol [42] to obtain genomic DNA from
ethanol-preserved blood samples from one specimen of
each additional passerine species mentioned above. To discern between expressed MHC genes and non-functional
pseudogenes, total RNA was isolated from approximately
100 μl of fresh blood taken from one pied flycatcher individual using TRIzol® LS Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
according to the supplier’s protocol. About 1 μg of total
RNA was treated with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA) before being reverse transcribed with the iScript™
cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, CA, USA) to control for the
possible amplification of target loci from genomic DNA.
The cDNA was subsequently used as template for PCR
amplification (see below).
PCR Amplification of genomic MHC fragments in
passerines

For each passerine species, we used two sets of primers
targeting conserved regions of MHC class II B genes in

birds: MHC05 [10] and 325 [27] amplified genomic fragments spanning exons 1 to 2, whereas using primers 326
[27] and RapEx3CR [23] a partial region of exon 2, the
entire intron 2 and a stretch of exon 3 were amplified
(Table 1 and Figure 1; steps 1 and 2). The logic behind
this step was to examine the intron sequences flanking
exon 2 among species and among loci. PCRs were carried out using a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research) in a final volume of 30 μl
containing 1 unit of a commercial Taq Polymerase (Bioline, London, UK), 1× manufacturer-supplied buffer
(Bioline), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 5%
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 10 μg of BSA (Bovine
Serum Albumin - Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), 10 pmoles of each primer and 1 μl of DNA
extracts. PCRs were performed according to a touch
down protocol from 66°C to 50°C (N = 16 cycles) plus
19 cycles of annealing temperatures at 50°C. Cycling
programs consisted of a first denaturing cycle of 3 min
at 94°C, plus subsequent steps of 94°C for 40 s, annealing steps for 40 s and extension steps at 72°C for 40 s.
PCR amplicons were cloned and sequenced as described
below except in the case of the pied flycatcher (see the
next subsection for a detailed description of the methods used in this species).
Targeting classical MHC class II B genes in pied
flycatchers

Genomic fragments spanning exons 1 to 2 and exons 2 to
3 (reactions 1 and 2, Figure 1) were directly sequenced
(see methods below) using primers 325 and 326, respectively, in the case of the five pied flycatchers. Although
direct sequencing chromatograms were mostly noisy, we

were able to design new primers in conserved intron 1exon 2 (MHCIIFihy-I1F) and exon 2-intron 2 junctions
(MHCIIFihy-I2R, Table 1 and Figure 1). These nucleotide
positions were among those of best quality across
sequencing chromatograms and we failed to detect
nucleotide polymorphisms within or between individuals.
Primers MHCIIFihy-I1F and MHCIIFihy-I2R were used
in combination with primers MHC05 and RapEx3CR to
generate a pool of genomic fragments along the MHC
class II domain (steps 3, 4 and 5, Figure 1).
Primers MHC05 and MHCIIFihy-I2R (reaction 3, Figure 1) preferentially amplified an oligomorphic gene in
the five individuals. Molecular cloning and sequencing
(see below) revealed the occurrence of six different
alleles and four non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in exon 2 (GenBank Acc No. GU390299GU390301). However, the examination of cDNA
sequences (see below) confirmed that this locus was
transcribed and may therefore represent a non-classical
MHC gene. Primers MHCIIFihy-I1F and RapEx3CR
(reaction 4, Figure 1), on the other hand, targeted at
least one pseudogene as suggested by the occurrence of
stop codons and frame shift mutations in the coding
region of exon 2 (GenBank Acc. No. GU390297).
Finally, direct sequencing of the PCR products obtained
with the new primers MHCIIFihy-I1F and MHCIIFihyI2R (reaction 5, Figure 1) denoted the co-amplification
of non-classical MHC genes and pseudogenes along
with highly polymorphic, classical MHC genes. We realized about the amplification of polymorphic MHC
genes after comparing the ambiguous nucleotide positions among the direct sequencing chromatograms
obtained from different individuals.

Figure 1 Reactions carried out in this study to amplify MHC class II B sequences from genomic DNA in passerines.

In the following step, we tried to obtain intron
sequences flanking exon 2 for each type of MHC loci
(i.e. non-classical, classical and pseudogenes) using
direct sequencing. To this aim, we profited from short
nucleotide motifs within the sequence of exon 2 differing among loci (Figure 2A). This information was used
to design primers for selective amplification and sequencing of specific intron sequences. Thus, primers MHCIIFihy-lwE2F (Table 1 and reaction 7, Figure 1) and
RapEx3CR amplified intron 2 of non-classical MHC
genes. Primers MHCIIFihy-pE2R and MHCIIFihy-pE2F
(Table 1), in conjunction with primers MHC05 and
RapEx3CR, amplified intron 1 and intron 2 sequences of
classical MHC genes (reactions 8-9, Figure 1). We nonetheless failed to amplify intron 1 sequences from pseudogenes with primers MHCIIFihy-psE2R and MHC05
(Table 1 and reaction 6, Figure 1). This may result from
the lack of this region in pseudogenes or due to the

presence of extremely long introns difficult to amplify
with our PCR protocol.
The alignment of flanking intron sequences showed
differences in nucleotide composition suitable for the
design of loci-specific primers (Figure 2A). Thus, in a
last step we designed a set of new primers (MHCIIFihyE2CF and MHCIIFihy-E2CR; Table 1 and reaction 10,
Figure 1), aimed to specifically amplify classical MHC
genes while overcoming the co-amplification of low
polymorphic and pseudogenes. Direct sequencing
revealed that highly polymorphic genes might share
common flanking intron sequences (data not shown)
and, therefore, the design of locus-specific primers was
not feasible within this group.
PCR amplification of cDNA

employing the MHC class II exon 2 specific primers pair,

MHC-F1 and MHC-R1 ([32], Table 1). The target of
interest was amplified using the cDNA as template with
similar PCR conditions and PCR purification approach as
described in Anmarkrud et al. (2010; ref. [32])
Molecular cloning and sequence analyses

PCR amplicons from genomic DNA and cDNA were
cleaned-up in Microcon centrifuge tubes (Millipore) and
subsequently cloned into bacterial plasmids using the
PGEM-T easy vector system II (Promega, WI, USA).
MHC inserts from positive clones were amplified as
described above using the vector specific M13 primers.
The PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels
and inserts suspected to contain the target loci were
sequenced using the BigDye 1.1 kit (Applied Biosystems,
CA, USA). Between 8 and 16 positive clones per individual were analysed for PCR products obtained during
the PCRs 1 to 4 (Figure 1). A total of 100 clones (20 per
individual) were randomly screened for PCR products
described in step 10 (Figure 1). Labelled fragments were
resolved in an ABI3130xl automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems). MHC sequences were edited and aligned in
BioEdit v. 7.0.9 [43]. The phylogenetic relationships
among MHC sequences were visualized using Neighbornet networks constructed in SplitsTree 4.0 [44] according to the Kimura-2-parameter model.

Tests for selection

An excess of non-synonymous (d N) over synonymous
(dS) substitutions characterizes coding sequences under
positive selection [45]. Functional constraints in protein
structure and function are translated, on the contrary,
into an excess of synonymous substitutions (i.e. stabilizing or purifying selection). To detect selective signatures, d N /d S rates were calculated in MEGA 4.1 [46]
using a Modified Nei-Gojobori method with Jukes-Cantor correction. Standard errors were calculated with
1,000 bootstrap replicates. Codons thought to be
involved in antigen recognition were analysed independently from those presumably not involved in such
function. We used information derived from the wellstudied MHC class II molecule of humans [47] to delimitate putative antigen-binding regions. Statistical support for positive selection was evaluated through Z-tests
run in MEGA 4.1.

Results
Genetic diversity and molecular evolution of classical
MHC class II genes in pied flycatchers

We successfully and selectively amplified highly polymorphic, classical MHC class II genes in pied flycatchers
using primers MHCIIFihy-E2CF and MHCIIFihy-E2CR
(Table 1, step 10 in Figure 1). The analysis of 100 clones

Canal et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/236

across the 5 individuals revealed 28 class II alleles translated into 28 amino acid sequences (GenBank Acc. No
GU390232-GU390259, see Figure 3). For each individual, about 20% of the cloned alleles suspiciously
resembled chimeric sequences or base misincorporations
during bacterial replication and were discarded. In this
respect, allele similarity was much higher within individuals than among individuals. Positive clones interchanging the first 30 bp of the 5’ end of exon 2 were
abundant. This finding hints at strong competition during the completion of PCR amplicons and the use of
incomplete PCR amplicons as templates for subsequent
amplification steps. The removal of putatively false and
spurious alleles from our data set revealed between 5
and 8 alleles per individual, a finding in agreement with
co-amplification of minimum 4 classical MHC class II B
loci in pied flycatchers. The analysis of 267 bp of the
exon 2 revealed high genetic polymorphism, with a large
number of segregating sites (S = 112) resulting from 159
mutations, an average nucleotide diversity among sites
(π = 0.167) and 44.63 nucleotide differences, on average,
among alleles. For those codons located within putative
antigen binding regions, non-synonymous substitutions
were remarkably more frequent than synonymous substitutions (dN = 0.587 ± 0.084; dS = 0.190 ± 0.043; Ztest, P < 0.001). This was not the case for those codons
not presumably interacting with antigens directly (dN =
0.054 ± 0.016; dS = 0.058 ± 0.021; Z-test, P = 0.79).
Phylogenetic networks allow distinguishing a large cluster of sequences containing exon 2 sequences from classical MHC loci and a different cluster containing exon 2
sequences from non-classical MHC loci. Pseudogene
sequences failed to intermingle with either of these two
distinct clusters (Figure 4). A clustering of sequences
according to loci is not evident within the exon 2

sequences derived from classical MHC genes. The phylogenetic network suggests the occurrence of divergent
and recombining allele lineages that are shared among
different loci instead. Finally, we isolated up to seven
different cDNA sequences from the same individual.
These cDNA sequences intermingle with the two clusters representing classical and non-clasical genes. Some
of the cDNA sequences obtained in the individual investigated were identical or related to the sequences isolated from genomic DNA in other individuals (see
Figure 4). Thus, our cDNA sequence data confirmed
that both classical and non-classical MHC class II genes
were transcribed in blood.
Cross-amplification of genomic MHC fragments in
passerines

Primers 326 and 325, in combination with MHC05 and
RapEx3CR (equivalent to reaction 1 and 2, Figure 1)
successfully amplified MHC class II genomic fragments
across a wide variety of passerine species. Sequences
from the white wagtail (GU390288-GU390293), common raven (GU390281-GU390283), European robin
(GU390284), woodchat shrike (GU390281-GU390283),
Dupont’s lark (GU390277-GU390280), Sardinian warbler
(GU390294-GU390296), trumpeter Finch (GU390273GU390276) and chiffchaff (GU390293) were deposited
in GenBank (see also Additional files 1 and 2). Our set
of MHC sequences reported intron 1 sizes ranging from
299 to 478 bp and intron 2 sizes ranging from 190 to
350 bp in the species investigated. In those cases where
we failed to obtain complete intron sequences from
clones (especially in the case of intron 2), intron size
was estimated through examination of 1.5% agarose gels.
The alignment of intron sequences suggested the coamplification of multiple copies in some species, such as

the white wagtail, the woodchat shrike and Dupont’s
lark (Figure 2B). The phylogenetic network of intron 1
did not cluster according to species (Figure 5). This
finding thus suggests that some regions of the multigene
family can be gene conversion free and concerted evolution may not be ubiquitous throughout all the mutigene
family. For the chiffchaff, the European robin, the common raven, the trumpeter Finch or the Sardinian warbler, our PCR experiments seemed to preferentially
amplify particular MHC fragments (see Additional Files
1 and 2 for sequence data). However, the low number
of clones analysed per species prevents this information
being conclusive so far. All isolated sequences seemed
to be putatively functional, as manifested by the lack of
stop codons or frameshift mutations. However, not all
the sequences obtained using both sets of primers were
overlapping and we could not create contigs in all cases.
As a result, more detailed examination for other species
rather than the pied flycatcher is needed.

Discussion
In this study we have for the first time isolated both
coding and non-coding sequences corresponding to
classical and non-classical MHC class II B genes in the
pied flycatcher. The molecular protocol here described
is also among the first ones demonstrating the utility of
flanking intron sequences to simplify MHC genotyping

in passerines. We show that intron sequences flanking
the usually polymorphic exon 2 may assist the specific
investigation of classical MHC class II B genes in species
that, as passerines, are characterized by extensive gene
duplication and pseudogenization [31]. Importantly,
classical and highly polymorphic MHC genes are the
primary targets of pathogen-mediated selection
(reviewed by [2,3]) and the evasion of non-classical
MHC genes with a more specific function and nonfunctional pseudogenes may accelerate data collection
and diminish costs.
Our genetic data suggest the occurrence of at least 4
classical MHC class II B genes in pied flycatchers. However, suspicious evidence for chimera sequences makes
this estimate far from conclusive. Additional studies
more thoroughly minimizing PCR-mediated recombination (e.g. [28], see also discussion below) and even
genetic inheritance analyses should add more light in
this respect. We expect our primers to be related with a
very low or non-existent incidence of null alleles. Primers are located immediately in the introns-exon 2
junction and some constraints in the mutation of this
important region involved in the splicing of mRNA are
therefore expected. Moreover, previous studies in birds
of prey have shown that exon 2-introns boundaries of
homologous genes are well conserved within related
species and even when comparing different raptor

lineages (e.g. [48,39]). The primers developed for the
specific amplification of classical MHC genes in pied flycatchers also proved to cross-amplify MHC sequences in
several passerine species of the Muscicapidae and Turdidae families (manuscript in prep.).
The cDNA sequences confirmed that both classical and
non-classical MHC genes are expressed in pied flycatchers and are therefore functional. For classical MHC
genes, we found an excess of non-synonymous substitutions, specifically for those amino acid positions that
have been suggested to interact with antigens in the
human MHC class II molecule ([47], see Figure 3). These
regions have shown to accumulate positively selected
sites in other avian lineages as well (e.g. [23,39,41]). All
these findings corroborate the suitability of the classical
MHC genes here described as relevant markers in ecoimmunogenetics studies in the pied flycatcher.
Concerted evolution and the simplification of MHC-typing
protocols in passerines

Even though we successfully evade the co-amplification of
pseudogenes and non-classical genes, our specific primers
for classical MHC class II genes co-amplify multiple loci.

Both exon 2 coding sequences (Figure 3) and flanking
intron sequences (data not shown) suggest that concerted
evolution may be responsible for the homogenisation of
the genomic sequence of classical MHC class II genes in
pied flycatchers and other passerines [31]. Concerted evolution is usually a considerable hindrance for the design of
locus-specific primers (e.g. [23]) and this is the major reason behind our failure to design locus-specific primers in
flycatchers. Under this scenario, sequencing the 3’-untransalted sequences (3’ UTRs) of different genes has emerged
as one of the very few alternatives to assign alleles to particular loci [10]. Detailed characterization of the MHC class
II B in the barn owl Tyto alba has nevertheless shown that
certain genomic regions are gene conversion free [40], a
fact that allowed researchers to design locus-specific primers. In the case of the jungle fowl [38], single locus typing at both MHC class I and class II loci was possible due
to the comprehensive knowledge of the MHC of the conspecific domestic chicken Gallus gallus. Similar strategies
can now also be applied to the recently characterized
MHC of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata [49] and
have already proven useful in red-winged blackbirds Agelaius phoeniceus [50]. Neither of these scenarios is

Canal et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:236

presently feasible in the case of the pied flycatcher,
although next-generation sequencing technologies are
expected to revolutionize the characterization of MHC
complexes in the near future (Genome 10K Community
of Scientists, 2009). An alternative to reduce the complexity of genotyping in those taxa with multiple classical
genes may be the design of primers targeting only a subset
of the allele repertoire, as explained in detail below.
Risk of chimera formation during the co-amplification of
multiple loci

Our genetic data demonstrate that PCR-mediated
recombination is a serious source of false or spurious
alleles when a large number of alleles are co-amplified
simultaneously. The implications of this phenomenon
are critical since many of the most popular MHC-typing
protocols, including next-generation sequencing
approaches [6], rely on PCR amplification at some stage.
Reducing the number of cycles and extending elongation
times during PCR amplification have been suggested to
diminish the confounding effects of in vitro recombination [28] and genotyping strategies in passerines may
therefore consider these precautions thoroughly. Taking
a look at our alignments (Figs. 2 and 4), the design of
primers targeting only a subset of the allele repertoire
could be an adequate alternative to reduce the co-amplification of large numbers of alleles. Variability in MHC
originates to a large extent by recombining alleles
exchanging particular nucleotide motifs. This is evident,
for instance, across the 5’ end of the coding sequence of
exon 2 in pied flycatchers (Figure 3). Despite implying
more tedious sample manipulation in the lab, these
approaches (further supported by non-denaturing capillary electrophoresis (SSCP or RSCA; reviewed in [6])
may be a useful alternative to minimize the incidence of
false and spurious alleles. Regarding denaturing capillary
electrophoresis, recent research [51] has shown that the
simultaneous analysis of multiple fragments enhances
our capabilities to discriminate between alleles when
compared to the analysis of single PCR amplicons.
Thus, partial digestion of PCR amplicons with restriction enzymes could be a promising strategy to improve
resolution in cases similar to that documented here for
the pied flycatcher. Alternatively, RSCA has also proven
to be a very effective and high-throughput for the genotyping of duplicated MHC class II genes [52].

predict better opportunities for designing locus-specific
primers or, at least, primers targeting a low number of
loci. However, future studies in these and other species
should tackle this issue in more depth to determine the
broad utility of our protocol. We do believe that these
data, although limited, may be really encouraging for
the simplification of MHC-typing protocols in other
passerine species since we have demonstrated that two
single PCR reactions and the analysis of only a few
clones are enough to isolate MHC sequences in the passerine species tested so far.
In some species, there was a trend for the preferential
amplification of particular MHC fragments probably due
to the large degeneracy of primers 326 and 325 (Table
1). For these reasons, we encourage the use of less
degenerate primers (MHCIIPas-E2iF and MHCIIPasE2iR) to minimize possible non-targeted products in
passerines and biases towards the amplification of particular loci which may lead studies to miss important
information on MHC structure. These primers were
designed over conserved exon 2 motifs that emerged
from an alignment of multiple passerine MHC class II
sequences species. Nevertheless, these primers have not
been tested in the present study and future studies will
ascertain their utility. Finally, collection of genomic data
will determine the suitability of similar approaches for
MHC class I genes in passerines. The vast majority of
studies so far have nonetheless dealt with expressed
genes and genomic data are therefore scant in this avian
lineage (e.g. [53,31,54,55]).

Conclusions
This study highlights the advantages from the increasing
knowledge in gene structure, polymorphism and expression profiles to simplify MHC typing protocols in passerine species. Importantly, the search for locus-specific
primers opens the possibility to decisively overcome chimera formation and focus on computational inferences
of gametic phase, one of the most promising alternatives
for MHC genotyping in the future [6].

Perspectives on additional passerine species

The cross-amplification of MHC sequences across a
phylogenetically diverse array of passerine species decisively enhances the future applications of our molecular
approach. Importantly, divergent introns-exon 2 boundaries within particular species such as the white wagtail,
Dupont’s lark or the woodchat shrine (Figure 2B)
