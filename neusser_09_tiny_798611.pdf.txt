Abstract
Background: Mesopsammic acochlidians are small, and organ complexity may be strongly
reduced (regressive evolution by progenesis), especially in microhedylacean species. The marine
interstitial hedylopsacean Pseudunela cornuta (Challis, 1970), however, was suggested as having a
complex reproductive system resembling that of much larger, limnic and benthic species. The
present study aims to reconstruct the detailed anatomy and true complexity of P. cornuta from
serial, semithin histological sections by using modern computer-based 3D visualization with Amira
software, and to explain it in an evolutionary context.
Results: Our results demonstrate considerable discordance with the original species description,
which was based solely on paraffin sections. Here, we show that the nervous system of P. cornuta
has paired rhinophoral, optic and gastro-oesophageal ganglia, three distinct ganglia on the visceral
nerve cord, and a putative osphradial ganglion, while anterior accessory ganglia are absent. The
presence of an anal genital cloaca is clearly rejected and the anus, nephropore and gonopore open
separately to the exterior; the circulatory and excretory systems are well-differentiated, including
a two-chambered heart and a complex kidney with a long, looped nephroduct; the special
androdiaulic reproductive system shows two allosperm receptacles, three nidamental glands, a
cavity with unknown function, as well as highly complex anterior copulatory organs with two
separate glandular and impregnatory systems including a penial stylet that measures approximately
a third of the whole length of the preserved specimen.
Conclusion: In spite of its small body size, the interstitial hermaphroditic P. cornuta shows high
complexity regarding all major organ systems; the excretory system is as differentiated as in species
of the sister clade, the limnic and much larger Acochlidiidae, and the reproductive system is by far
the most elaborated one ever observed in a mesopsammic gastropod, though functionally not yet
fully understood. Such organ complexity as shown herein by interactive 3D visualization is not
plesiomorphically maintained from a larger, benthic ancestor, but newly evolved within small
marine hedylopsacean ancestors of P. cornuta. The common picture of general organ regression
within mesopsammic acochlidians thus is valid for microhedylacean species only.

Background
The meiofauna of marine sands includes species of nearly
all taxa of invertebrates, many of which show regressive
characteristics in their anatomy or specialized features in
their organ systems [1]. Compared to their supposed basal
opisthobranch relatives [2,3], mesopsammic acochlidian
sea slugs display many of such reductions, e.g., they have
a small and worm-like body, lack a shell, are unpigmented, cephalic tentacles and eyes are reduced in several
lineages, many species are aphallic, and in general, the
reproductive, excretory and circulatory systems have a
very simple organization. Due to such reductions, which
are especially pronounced in one subclade, the Microhedylacea, the Acochlidia were hypothesized to have
undergone "regressive evolution" [4], as a result of progenesis [5]. However, several recent studies [6,7] show
that original, macroscopic or paraffin-based histological
descriptions of small acochlidian species could hardly
give a reliable picture even of simple organs. In contrast,
computer-based 3D-reconstruction of serial semithin histological slices is highly efficient to obtain detailed and
reliable knowledge even on tiny and complex structures,
such as the considerably differentiated acochlidian central
nervous system [8-10].
Species of the second acochlidian subclade, the Hedylopsacea, may show fewer tendencies for reductions; in contrast to the microhedylaceans, the circulatory and
excretory systems, and reproductive and copulatory
organs may be highly complex and are derived especially
in members of the Acochlidiidae s.l., a clade of largersized, benthic, limnic members [3]. According to a phylogenetic analysis [3], the genus Pseudunela is the sistergroup
to such derived acochlidians, despite species of Pseudunela
being small, marine, interstitial forms. Only two Pseudunela species are known, P. eirene Wawra, 1988 [11] and
P. cornuta [12]. The description of P. eirene is brief and
based on a single specimen with ganglia of the nervous
system and stylets of copulatory organs studied on a
whole-mount by light microscopy only. No histological
sections were made, and the radula was studied lightmicroscopically after dissolving the soft parts and stylets.
Information on other organ systems is absent, and no further specimens are available for study. In contrast, the
original description of P. cornuta, the type species, is based
on paraffin sections, and quite detailed data about the
central nervous and the digestive systems is included.
However, information about the excretory system is fragmentary and improper, and data about the reproductive
system is confusing. Well-preserved specimens of P. cornuta were made available for detailed 3D-reconstruction.
The present study thus explores the complex anatomy and
potential role of a member of the stemgroup of a radiation
that accounted for major evolutionary changes, i.e. a habitat switch to freshwater systems and an evolution towards

highly complex copulatory systems that culminated in a
giant, trap-like "rapto-penis".

Methods
Sampling and specimen preparation
During an expedition to Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands in
October 2007, two specimens of Pseudunela cornuta were
collected at the beach of Komimbo Bay near Tambea Village (09°15.843'S, 159°40.097'E). They were extracted
from sand samples (fine sand of the lower intertidal)
according to Schrödl [13] and relaxed using 7% MgCl2
solution. Both specimens were preserved in 75% ethanol.

Later in the laboratory, the visceral sac of one specimen
was removed for further molecular analysis. The remaining anterior body and the other entire specimen were
decalcified with Bouin's solution overnight. For better visibility of the translucent specimens and an appropriate
orientation during the embedding procedure, the material
was stained with Safranin (0.5% Safranin in 80% ethanol)
for a few minutes and rinsed with 80% ethanol. Finally,
the two specimens (in one case only anterior part) were
dehydrated in a graded series of acetone in distilled water
(80, 90 and 100%) and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity
resin [14]. Two series of ribboned serial semithin sections
of 1.5 m thickness were prepared using a diamond knife
(Histo Jumbo, Diatome, Biel, Switzerland) and contact
cement at the lower cutting edge [15], and finally stained
with methylene blue-azure II according to Richardson et
al. [16]. The sections were deposited at the Zoologische
Staatssammlung München, Mollusca Section (entire specimen: ZSM N° 20071911 and anterior body: ZSM N°
20071809).
3D reconstruction
Digital photographs of every slice (420 images in total)
were taken with a CCD microscope camera (Spot Insight,
Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, USA) mounted
on a DMB-RBE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). The image resolution was reduced to 1120 ×
840 pixels (resulting pixel size: 0.8 m) and images were
contrast enhanced, unsharp masked and converted to 8bit
greyscale format with standard image editing software. A
detailed computer-based 3D-reconstruction of all major
organ systems was conducted with the software AMIRA
4.1 and 5.2 (TGS Europe, Mercury Computer Systems,
Merignac Cedex, France) following basically the procedure explained by Ruthensteiner [15]. The interactive 3D
model for the electronic 3D PDF version were prepared
using the 3D tools of Adobe Acrobat Professional
Extended 9.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated) according to
Ruthensteiner & Heß [17]. The 3D model (accessible by
clicking onto Fig. 1 in the 3D PDF version of this article;

structed structures and switching between prefabricated

Original material and neotype
According to Challis [12], the holotype of Pseudunela cornuta, 20 paratypes and a slide with the radula of a further
paratype were deposited in The Natural History Museum,
London; furthermore, 10 paratypes and a slide with
another radula were deposited in the Museum of New
Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington; the remaining
paratypes and the sectioned material were stored in the
private collection. We contacted both museums above
mentioned - there is no trace of the material or any evidence that it ever arrived there. Obviously, no type material of P. cornuta was ever deposited in any public
institution.

We consider our recently collected specimens as the species Pseudunela cornuta described by Challis [12] due to 1)
the same collecting site as part of the material that was
used for the original description, 2) the undoubted placement into the genus Pseudunela and 3) the same external
morphology as described by Challis [12]. The section
series ZSM N° 20071911 is designed herein as neotype
due to the apparent non-existence of the original type
material, and to avoid taxonomic confusion with congeners and a number of similar but still unnamed species
found by the authors and mentioned in the literature [1820].

Results
The following description is based on the entire specimen,
which shows mature reproductive organs.
External morphology
Pseudunela cornuta shows an anterior head-foot complex
and a posterior elongated visceral hump (vh) (Figs. 1A; 2)
in which the animal can partly retract when disturbed. The
paired labial tentacles (lt) (Figs. 1A; 2) are broad at the
base, tapering to the end and usually held at 45°-90° to
the longitudinal axis of the specimen. The paired rhinophores (rh) (Fig. 2) are tapered and usually point forward
like horns in crawling animals. Eyes (ey) are present (Fig.
1A-C), but not visible externally. The densely ciliated foot
(f) is as broad as the anterior head-foot complex and
extends about one third of the visceral hump in the crawling animal. The free end of the foot is pointed (Fig. 2).

The body size of living specimens is about 3 mm and the
body colour is whitish translucent. In the anterior part of
the visceral hump the heart bulb (hb) (Fig. 2) is visible
externally on the right body side. A few elongate, subepidermal spicules of up to 40 m in length can be found in
the posterior part of the visceral hump.

Microanatomy
Central nervous system (CNS)
The CNS of Pseudunela cornuta is euthyneurous and composed of the paired cerebral (cg), rhinophoral (rhg), optic
(og), pedal (pg), pleural (plg), buccal (bg) and gastrooesophageal ganglia (gog) as well as three distinct ganglia
on the visceral nerve cord, plus a presumed osphradial
ganglion (osg) (Figs. 1B, C; 3). All ganglia excluding the
buccal and gastro-oesophageal ganglia are situated prepharyngeally (Fig. 1C). The CNS is epiathroid; the pleural
ganglion is located closer to the cerebral ganglion than to
the pedal one. All ganglia consist of an outer cortex containing the nuclei and an inner medulla (Fig. 4A-C). The
large cerebral ganglia are linked by a robust commissure
(Figs. 1B; 3) and lie dorsal to the pedal ganglia (Fig. 1C).
Anteroventrally, the robust labiotentacular nerve (ltn)
(Figs. 1C; 3; 4B) emerges innervating the labial tentacle. A
rhinophoral ganglion (Figs. 1C; 3; 4A) is situated anterodorsally to each cerebral ganglion connected by a short,
single cerebro-rhinophoral connective. The rhinophoral
nerve (rhn) (Figs. 1B, C; 3) arises from the rhinophoral
ganglion extending to the rhinophore. A small, unpigmented eye (Figs. 1A, C; 4A) is connected by the thin optic
nerve (on) (Fig. 3) to the rhinophoral nerve, slightly anterior to the rhinophoral ganglion. An optic ganglion (Figs.

and connected to the latter by a thin nerve (Fig. 3). The
optic ganglion is surrounded by an additional layer of
connective tissue shared with the cerebral ganglion.
Precerebral anterior accessory ganglia, as described for
microhedylacean acochlidians and Tantulum elegans
Rankin, 1979 [6-8,10], are absent. A Hancock's organ
could not be detected.
The paired pedal ganglia (Figs. 1B, C; 3) lie posteroventrally to the cerebral ganglia, and are connected by a commissure which is slightly longer than the cerebral
commissure (Figs. 1B; 3). A statocyst (s) with a single oto-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/20

lith (Figs. 1B, C; 3; 4C) is attached dorsally to each pedal
ganglion. The static nerve could not be detected. Two
pedal nerves (pn) (Figs. 1C; 3) emerge from each pedal
ganglion, one in the anterior and another in the posterior
part, both innervating the foot. The pleural ganglion is
located posterior to the cerebral ganglion (Figs. 1B, C; 3;
4C) and connected to the latter and the pedal ganglion by
short connectives forming the pre-pharyngeal nerve ring.
The pleural ganglia are connected by very short connectives to the visceral nerve cord, so that the latter is located
at the very beginning of the pharynx (Fig. 1C). There are
three distinct ganglia on the short visceral nerve cord: the
left parietal ganglion (pag) (Figs. 1B; 3; 4C), the fused
subintestinal/visceral ganglion (subg+vg) (Figs. 1B; 3; 4C)
and the fused right parietal/supraintestinal ganglion
(pag+supg) (Figs. 1B, C; 3). While the left pleuro-parietal,
the parietal-subintestinal/visceral and the right pleuroparietal/supraintestinal connectives are very short, the
subintestinal/visceral-parietal/supraintestinal connective
is long (Fig. 3). An additional presumed osphradial ganglion (Figs. 1B, C; 3) is linked to the fused parietal/
supraintestinal ganglion. Anteriorly, a nerve emerges
(Figs. 1B; 3; 4C) and innervates the right body wall; no
histologically differentiated osphradium could be
detected. The buccal ganglia are positioned posterior to
the pharynx (Fig. 1C) and are linked to each other by a
short buccal commissure ventral to the oesophagus (Fig.
4E). The thin cerebro-buccal connective (Figs. 1B; 3)
emerges anteriorly from each buccal ganglion and was not
traceable along the entire length. A smaller gastrooesophageal ganglion (Figs. 1B, C; 3; 4E) lies dorsally to
each buccal ganglion and is connected to the latter by a
short connective.
Digestive system
The mouth opening (mo) (Fig. 1D) lies ventrally between
the labial tentacles. The paired anterior pedal glands (apg)
(Figs. 1D; 4A) discharge ventral to the mouth opening to
the exterior. The oral tube (ot) (Figs. 1D; 4A, B) is long
and not ciliated. Paired oral tube glands (otg) (Figs. 1D;
4A, B) are flanking the oral tube and discharge in its anterior part. The muscular pharynx (ph) (Figs. 1C; 4C, D) is
bulbous and narrows to the posterior; it contains the
hook-shaped radula (r) (Figs. 1C, D; 4D). The upper
ramus is longer than the lower one (Fig. 1C). The radula
formula could not be examined. Jaws are absent. The
long, ciliated oesophagus (oe) (Figs. 1D; 4E, F) emerges
posterodorsally from the pharynx and is flanked by longitudinal muscles. One pair of large salivary glands (sgl, sgr)
(Figs. 1D; 4E) discharges into the oesophagus via narrow
salivary gland ducts (sgd) (Figs. 1D; 4E) directly behind
the pharynx.

The large, sac-like digestive gland (dg) (Fig. 1D) is placed
at the left side of the visceral hump flanking the ovotestis

(Figs. 1A; 5E) and extends almost up to the end of the visceral hump (Fig. 1A). The intestine (i) is densely ciliated
and short (Figs. 1D; 5A, B). The anus (a) (Fig. 1A, D)
opens slightly anterior, but separate to the nephropore
and ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump.
Excretory and circulatory systems
The excretory and circulatory systems are located at the
right side of the body (Fig. 1A) just at the beginning of the
visceral hump.

The circulatory system shows a large two-chambered heart
consisting of an anterior ventricle (v) (Figs. 1A; 5F; 6; 7A,
B) and a smaller, posterior atrium (at) (Figs. 5F; 6; 7A, B).
The thin-walled pericardium (pc) (Fig. 6) surrounding the
heart could not be detected due to the very compressed
tissue. The aorta (ao) (Figs. 5A; 6; 7A, B) arises anteriorly
from the ventricle and leads to the head, where the aorta
bifurcates (Figs. 4A, B; 6) approximately at the level of the
eyes ending in blood sinuses. The renopericardioduct
(rpd) (Figs. 6; 7B) is a well-developed and heavily ciliated
funnel (Figs. 5B; 6B). The kidney (k) is a sinuously bent
sac and extends over almost the half of the visceral hump
(Fig. 1A). Internally it is divided into a narrow lumen (kn)
(Figs. 5D; 6A; 7A, B) bordered by tissue with small vacuoles, and a wide lumen (kw) (Figs. 5C, D; 6; 7A, B) limited
by highly vacuolated tissue. Both lumina join in the posterior part of the kidney (Fig. 6). The renopericardial duct
is connected to the narrow lumen in the anterior part of
the kidney (Figs. 6B; 7B). The connection between the kidney and the nephroduct is narrow and ciliated. The nephroduct is long and looped with a dorsal branch (ndd)
extending backward and a ventral branch (ndv) forward
(Figs. 6; 7A, B). The ventral branch is looped dorsally in its
distal part (Figs. 6; 7A, B). The nephropore (np) (Fig. 1A)
opens just posterior, but separate to the anus and ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump.
Reproductive system
Terms used below are based on Ghiselin [21]. The nidamental glands are identified according to Klussmann-

Kolb [22] and the anterior male copulatory organs are
named following the terminology of Haase & Wawra [23].
The reproductive system of Pseudunela cornuta is (simultaneous) hermaphroditic (Fig. 8). The anterior genitalia
show a special androdiaulic condition: the vas deferens
does not branch off in a proximal position as usual in
androdiaulic nudibranch or acteonoidean species
[2,24,25], but more distally, i.e. autosperm must pass
through the nidamental glands. Nevertheless this reproductive system is not strictly monaulic, because the internal vas deferens (for autosperm) is separated from the
distal portion of the oviduct.
The sac-like ovotestis (ov) extends over the half of the
right side of the visceral hump (Fig. 1A) and is not separated into follicles; oocytes are located more in the exterior part of the gonad and the spermatocytes are
positioned more in the centre. Sperm heads are short (Fig.
5E). Approximately 10 yolky oocytes (oo) were noted in
the examined specimen (Figs. 5A, E; 7C). Anterior to the
ovotestis there is a small receptaculum seminis (rs) (Figs.
5A, B; 7C; 8) containing sperm cells orientated with their
heads to the wall, as well as a sac-like ampulla (am) (Figs.
7C, D; 8) filled with unorientated autosperm (Figs. 4F;
5A). Three nidamental glands can be distinguished: the
albumen (alg), membrane (meg) and mucus gland (mug)
from proximal to distal, respectively (Figs. 7C, D; 8). The
tube-like albumen gland is characterized by cells containing dark blue stained vesicles and long cilia (Fig. 5A-D).
The membrane gland is tube-like with long cilia as well. In
the proximal part, vesicles are stained purple, in the distal
part, lilac (Fig. 5A, D). The mucus gland is sac-like with
short cilia. It shows the same histological staining properties as the distal membrane gland (Fig. 5B, D). The distal
part of the mucus gland extends to the right side of the
body wall where the hermaphroditic duct divides into the
vas deferens (vd) and the oviduct (Fig. 8). The oviduct
widens to a cavity (cdo) (Figs. 5B-D, F; 7C, D; 8). At the
distal end of the cavity a long, narrowly coiled bursa stalk
(bs) (Figs. 5B-D, F; 7C, D; 8) branches off leading to the
large bursa copulatrix (bc) (Figs. 5D, F; 7C, D; 8). No sper-

sperm. The distal oviduct (do) extends to the female
gonopore (fgo) (Figs. 4F; 7C, D; 8) opening ventrolaterally on the right side of the visceral hump to the exterior.
The female gonopore is situated considerably anterior to
the anus and the nephropore (Fig. 1A).
The internal, subepidermal vas deferens extends along the
right body side (Figs. 4; 8) to the right rhinophore connecting to the anterior male copulatory organs (Figs. 7E;
8). The short posterior-leading vas deferens (vdp) (Figs.
4B, C; 7C; 8) joins the large, tubular prostate gland (pr)
(Figs. 4D, E; 7C, E; 8). Anteriorly, the long and highly
coiled, muscular ejaculatory duct (ed) arises from the
prostate (Figs. 4C-F; 5A-C; 7C, E; 8). The ejaculatory duct
enters the muscular penis (p) (Figs. 4E, F; 7E, F; 8) at its
base and discharges at the top of the penis through a long
hollow stylet. The penial stylet (pst) is about 600 m long
and corkscrew-like coiled with one and a half spirals (Figs.
4E, F; 7F; 8). This stylet can be partly retracted into the
penial muscle (Figs. 4E; 7F) that is able to evert to a certain

extent. The blind ending glandular paraprostate (ppr)
(Figs. 5A-D; 7E; 8) is longer and thinner than the prostate,
and in contrast to the latter, highly coiled. It is connected
by the paraprostatic duct (ppd) (Figs. 5A-D; 7E; 8) to the
muscular basal finger (bf) (Figs. 4C-F; 7C, E, F; 8), which
is united to the penial muscle mass at its base. The paraprostatic duct enters the basal finger approximately in the
middle of the muscle (Fig. 7E) and opens terminally via a
hollow curved stylet (bst, st) (Figs. 4C; 7E, F; 8) of about
110 m length. The penis, the basal finger and parts of the
ejaculatory and paraprostatic ducts are surrounded by a
thin-walled penial sheath (ps) (Figs. 4C; 7E, F; 8). The latter, together with the copulatory organs, probably can be
protruded through the male gonopore (mgo) (Fig. 1A)
just at the base of the right rhinophore during the sperm
transfer. However, sperm transfer has never been observed
in living specimens.

Microanatomy
Central nervous system
Challis' original description of the CNS in Pseudunela cornuta contains some substantial details [12]. In the present
study we supplement and correct the original data, and, in
addition, homologize and name ganglia according to
standard works [29]. The ganglia on the visceral nerve
cord were interpreted according to the pentaganglionate
hypothesis proposed by Haszprunar and recent studies on
other acochlidians [6,30,31].

The CNS of P. cornuta follows the usual arrangement of
ganglia in other hedylopsacean acochlidian species such
as Hedylopsis ballantinei Sommerfeldt & Schrödl, 2005 and
Tantulum elegans [6,31]. In contrast to T. elegans, precerebral ganglia are lacking in P. cornuta. Challis [12]
described precerebral anterior accessory ganglia for P. cornuta as "anterior nerves in the form of two chains of ganglia". According to the drawing in Challis [12], the highly
undulated and curled nerves might have been misinterpreted as anterior accessory ganglia. Anterior accessory
ganglia are absent in a recently discovered congener from
Vanuatu [32], but have been reported for P. eirene by
Wawra [11] and, thus, should be re-examined carefully in
this species.

characteristic for Acochlidia [3]. The digitiform shape and
the position of the cephalic tentacles identify this species
as belonging to the genus Pseudunela, according to SalviniPlawen [26], Rankin [27] and Wawra [28]. Our results of
the external morphology match with the original description of Challis [12], except for the presence of subepidermal spicules in living specimens. Most probably Challis
overlooked the sparsely arranged spicules in the visceral
hump of P. cornuta or they were already dissolved in preserved specimens.

Although Challis [12] described some very tiny nerves,
such as the static nerve and the cerebro-buccal connectives, he overlooked or misinterpreted quite larger structures, such as the paired rhinophoral, optic and gastrooesophageal ganglia. Our results show the eye is innervated by the optic nerve which emerges from the rhinophoral nerve; this condition is very unusual for
opisthobranch species and, to our knowledge, only
known for the closely related acochlidians Hedylopsis ballantinei and H. spiculifera (Kowalevsky, 1901) [31,33]. In
contrast, the eye in the more basal Tantulum elegans is
innervated by the optic nerve arising from the optic ganglion; additionally, the optic nerve is connected to the
Hancock's nerve [6]. Challis [12] described only two ganglia on the visceral nerve cord, namely the sub- and the
supraintestinal ganglia, which are identified in the present
work as the fused subintestinal/visceral and the fused
right parietal/supraintestinal ganglion, respectively. The
small left parietal ganglion has been overlooked, probably
due to its very close position to the pleural ganglion. The
additional ganglion attached to the fused parietal/
supraintestinal ganglion, which has been described originally as visceral ganglion [12], is interpreted herein as the
osphradial ganglion, according to Huber [29].
Digestive system
The digestive system of Pseudunela cornuta was welldescribed by Challis [12] and conforms to the general
ground-pattern of the digestive system in acochlidian spe-

Page 11 of 17

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:20

cies. The stomach reported in the original description,
however, could not be detected in the present study.
While a stomach fused with the anterior cavity of the
digestive gland is present in some acochlidian species,
such as T. elegans and Asperspina murmanica (Kudinskaya
& Minichev, 1978) [6,7], a histologically and anatomically distinct organ is absent in all Acochlidia studied in
detail.
Acochlidians generally have reduced or lost the mantle
cavity. While in Hedylopsis ballantinei a small remainder
could be detected by histological and ultrastructural
investigations [34], a well-developed "mantle-cavity"
originally described from A. murmanica was shown to be
completely absent [7,35]; the genital system, intestine and
nephroduct open separately at the right lateral body surface [7]. The presence of common exit ducts, such as
cloacae, could indicate that there are remnants of mantle
cavities in some acochlidians. Challis described an analgenital cloaca into which the intestine is discharging from
P. cornuta; however, this assumption is clearly rejected by
our results. In P. cornuta the genital opening, anus and
nephropore open separately to the exterior (from anterior
to posterior, respectively). Additionally, the anus is associated with the nephropore; the female gonopore opens
more anteriorly. The same arrangement of the orifices of
the body can be found in T. elegans [6], whereas the nephropore is situated anterior to the anus in the microhedylacean Microhedyle remanei (Marcus, 1953), A. murmanica
and Pontohedyle milaschewitchii (Kowalevsky, 1901)
[7,8,10]. Another acochlidian species, Asperspina rhopalotecta (Salvini-Plawen, 1973), which was reported to show
a true cloaca [28], should be re-examined carefully.
Excretory and circulatory systems
The excretory and circulatory systems of P. cornuta were
rudimentarily described by Challis who identified a pericardium, a heart without evident division into ventricle
and atrium, and a short aorta "discharging almost immediately into the haemocoele" [12]. In contrast, our results
show a two-chambered heart and an aorta extending up to
the head. Well-developed two-chambered hearts have
been reported for Hedylopsis ballantinei, Microhedyle remanei and Tantulum elegans [6,8,34]. In contrast, only a onechambered heart could be detected recently in Asperspina
murmanica and Pontohedyle milaschewitchii in spite of
detailed re-examinations [7,10]. Jörger et al. [10] suggest a
thorough examination by TEM for all acochlidian species
reported with a one-chambered heart or described as
being even heart-less, such as Ganitus evelinae Marcus,
1953 and Parhedyle tyrtowii (Kowalevsky, 1901) [36,37].

The kidney of P. cornuta has been depicted as a "large
unfolded sac" [12] without any internal and histological
data given. Surprisingly, our present data reveal that the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/20

kidney is a large, complex organ showing histologically
distinguishable sections with supposedly different, but yet
unknown function. In contrast, all marine acochlidian
species studied in detail (M. remanei, P. milaschewitchii
and A. murmanica) have a small, simple, sac-like kidney
[7,8,10]. The marine Hedylopsis ballantinei was reported to
show a long, sac-like kidney extending almost over the
entire visceral sac [31,34]; however, our re-examination
revealed a complex kidney with a narrow duct extending
posteriorly and a wide one leading anteriorly (own
unpubl. data), just as in P. cornuta. The kidney of P. cornuta also resembles those described for limnic hedylopsaceans such as T. elegans [6]. The original description of
P. cornuta does not provide any information about the
length and the shape of the nephroduct, nor the position
of the nephropore. Whereas marine acochlidian species
usually have a short, straight nephroduct (such as M.
remanei, P. milaschewitchii, A. murmanica), the present
study reveals P. cornuta to have a long, looped nephroduct
as present in limnic Acochlidiidae (own unpubl. data)
[38].
Unfortunately, Wawra [11] did not mention any excretory
or circulatory features in the description of Pseudunela eirene, thus no comparison to other Pseudunela species can
be drawn.
Reproductive system
The original description of the genital organs [12] shows
major discrepancies relative to our results. Besides revising
the differences, we add new data and name structures
according to Haase & Wawra [23].

The reproductive system of the opisthobranch common
ancestor likely was monaulic and the pallial gonoduct
undivided [21]. Most acochlidian species may have a
monaulic reproductive system as well (or are gonochoristic). In contrast, a special type of an androdiaulic reproductive system with the distal portion of the female
gonoduct separated from the vas deferens exists in Pseudunela cornuta and Tantulum elegans [6]. Challis [12]
noticed the presence of a distal bursa copulatrix as a short
blind sac emerging from the "cloaca", but, in contrast to
our observations, there is no report of a proximally situated receptaculum seminis. In the past, only the limnic
acochlidian Strubellia paradoxa (Strubell, 1892) from
Solomon Islands was known to possess both allosperm
receptacles [39]. While in the original description no
ampulla was described, we could find a well-developed,
sac-like ampulla in P. cornuta. A sac-like ampulla is
reported from Asperspina murmanica and Tantulum elegans
[6,7], whereas the ampulla is a tubular swelling of the
gonoduct in Microhedyle remanei and Pontohedyle milaschewitchii [8,10]. Opisthobranch eggs are surrounded by
three layers of nutritive and protective materials that are

Page 12 of 17

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:20

secreted by three different glands [21]. Challis described
two nidamental glands, the proximal albumen and the
distal mucous gland, but gave no data about their shapes
or histological appearances. Following Klussmann-Kolb
[22], the nidamental glands in this study were interpreted
based on their position in the reproductive system. These
are the albumen, membrane and mucus gland, from proximal to distal, respectively. The albumen and membrane
glands are tubular in all acochlidian species studied in
detail. The mucus gland shows more structural variety and
may be tubular as in A. murmanica and P. milaschewitchii
[7,10], but is a blind sac in P. cornuta and M. remanei [8].
The cavity of the distal oviduct in P. cornuta that is situated
near to the female gonopore was not described by Challis
[12] and has never been observed in any other acochlidian species up to now. The function of this structure is yet
unknown. A function as fertilization chamber is not likely
due to its very distal position in the reproductive system.
However, a role during sperm transfer is imaginable (see
below).
The posterior part of the reproductive system is connected
to the anterior male reproductive system by the completely internal vas deferens. According to Ghiselin [21]
the latter is a mechanism to hasten the transfer of sperm
and, therefore, is an improvement compared with the
external sperm groove of the hypothetic ancestor of the
opisthobranchs.
The original description of the complex, anterior copulatory organs includes a drawing by Challis [12]; unfortunately, the interpretation of the different ducts, glands and
stylets remains confusing. Wawra [11] interpreted the
penial spine in Challis' drawing as the penial stylet. In
contrast, we consider herein the penial spine of 100 m in
fact being the stylet of the basal finger (which measures
approx. 110 m in our specimen), so that the following
conclusions can be drawn: 1) the stylet-bearing muscle at
the base of the penis in Challis' drawing is the basal finger;
2) the penial gland was misinterpreted and is in fact the
paraprostate; 3) the duct connecting Challis' penial gland
with the penial spine is considered as the paraprostatic
duct; 4) the prostate gland is the prostate; 5) the spermatic
duct running from the rhinophore to the prostate gland is
the cephalic, posterior-leading vas deferens; 6) the efferent male duct probably is the penial sheath through
which the anterior male copulatory organs can be protruded. Furthermore, the ejaculatory duct connecting the
prostate to the penis was overlooked, as well as the large
hollow stylet that we found at the tip of the penis. May be
the stylet was totally retracted into the penial muscle in
the specimen examined by Challis, or perhaps it was broken away during the last sperm transfer. Wawra [40] suggested this possibility for Hedylopsis spiculifera, as he found
a detached stylet in the visceral sac of one specimen. The

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/20

extremely complex copulatory system found in P. cornuta
is similar to that of species of the much larger, limnic Acochlidiidae, and particularly the genus Strubellia (own
unpubl. data).
Reproductive functions
While the generally marine microhedylacean species are
aphallic, the basal, limnic hedylopsacean, Tantulum elegans, possesses a muscular copulatory organ [6]. Similar,
but more complex anterior copulatory organs can be
found in the marine hedylopsaceans Hedylopsis spiculifera,
Pseudunela cornuta and P. eirene [11,40], as well as in
other, limnic hedylopsacean species. The hollow penial
stylet of all these latter species indicates that sperm transfer occurs by injection [3,41]. Hypodermal injection in
the sequential hermaphrodite H. spiculifera, which lacks
any allosperm receptacles, may be an imprecise one, as
indicated by the finding of lost penial stylets in the body
cavity [40]. In P. cornuta, we found an extremely long,
tubular penial stylet and two allosperm storing receptacles. Due to the presence of the latter, we suggest a more
precise sperm injection in P. cornuta into the genital system of the mate. In the present species, the cavity of the
distal oviduct may serve as the site of sperm injection, or
any other place within the genital system. Injected sperm
then would move to the receptaculum seminis for long
term storage and/or to the bursa copulatrix for short term
storage and digestion. Passing through the nidamental
glands without being trapped is obviously possible, presumably during periods without active glandular secretion. Challis proposed either the bursa stalk or the cloaca
as region of fertilization in P. cornuta. This is unlikely due
to the absence of the cloaca and the position of the bursa
stalk distal to the nidamental glands. Fertilization of
oocytes certainly occurs proximally, close to the receptaculum seminis, where allosperm is stored and nourished as
indicated by the heads that are embedded into the organ
walls.

Peculiar and noteworthy is the very long and curled, hollow penial stylet in P. cornuta. While other Pseudunela species have a penial stylet not exceeding 200 m, the penial
stylet of P. cornuta is approx. 600 m long, which represents nearly one third of the body length in the fixed specimen. The functionality of such a curled stylet, however, is
not understood. The curl may be a fixation artefact or
more likely, due to the immense length of the stylet and
the little space available in the head, the curled position
signifies a "space saving storage". During sperm transfer
the stylet may be uncoiled due to the pressure of emergent
fluids and be operative for "long distance" hypodermal
impregnation; in this case, the specimen can inject autosperm without approximating too closely the mate and
thus, without the risk of being "hit" by the mate. Since the
stylet in its extended condition measures over 2 times the

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:20

complete body width of a potential mate, we cannot
imagine of any basic functional needs for developing such
an organ, such as injection of sperm into a certain organ
or body region of the mate. Instead, we may be observing
the product of an evolutionary race of arms within P. cornuta. Similarly obscure is the exact function of an additional, paraprostatic impregnatory system that was
described from Acochlidium fijiense Haynes & Kenchington, 1991 [23]. Schrödl & Neusser [3] discussed a probable role in the production of anaesthetics as known in
cephalaspidean species with complex penial structures
[42] or of fluids stimulating sperm transfer, as known
from the sacoglossan Elysia timida (Risso, 1818) [43]. In P.
cornuta, however, the penial stylet is extremely long, and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/20

it is difficult to imagine how the much shorter stylet of the
basal finger may hit and affect the mate.
Regression or innovation? Evolution of acochlidian organ systems
Based on our recent results on acochlidian phylogeny [3],
the evolution of organs and whole organ systems can be
reconstructed at least for the major clades. In contrast to
earlier generalizations [4,5], the various lineages show different trends; an overview of reductions and increasing
complexity of the organ systems in Acochlidia is given in
Fig. 9. The topology of the phylogenetic tree (parsimony
analysis for all nominal 27 acochlidian species and 11
outgroup taxa based on 107 morphological characters) is
simplified according to Schrödl & Neusser [3].

Figure 9
Evolution of organ complexity in acochlidian lineages
Evolution of organ complexity in acochlidian lineages. A selection of major organ reductions or innovations of several
systems is mapped on a phylogenetic tree (strict consensus tree from Schrödl & Neusser [3], simplified. The parsimony analysis
was based on 107 morphological characters with all 27 valid acochlidian species and 11 outgroup taxa included). Within the
basally marine mesopsammic Hedylopsacea, the reproductive and excretory systems evolved towards higher complexity. With
current state of knowledge the special hedylopsacean kidney appears ancestral and can be interpreted as a preadaptation and
key feature to successful invasions of freshwater habitats. In contrast, the microhedylacean lineage shows regressive tendencies, especially with regard to external and reproductive features. Light green: external morphology. Dark green: central nervous system. Blue: excretory system. Red: reproductive system. Features in italic are reductions/losses, taxa in bold refer to

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:20

The external morphology with the anterior head-foot
complex retractile into an elongated visceral hump is similar in all acochlidian species and certainly ancestral. Only
in the microhedylacean species is there a tendency
towards reduction of the cephalic tentacles, the foot
length and the foot width (Fig. 9), whereas P. cornuta
shows, together with all other hedylopsacean species,
well-developed tentacles and foot. The digestive system of
P. cornuta is quite simple and conforms to the usual
ground-pattern in acochlidian species. The CNS is plesiomorphically complex and the arrangement of ganglia is
more or less similar in all acochlidian species. Differences
concern precerebral accessory ganglia which, after splitting off Tantulum, were lost in the hedylopsacean lineage
(Fig. 9), still by marine ancestors. In contrast, aggregations
of accessory ganglia are present in microhedylacean species. The acochlidian excretory system varies considerably
between marine and limnic species. All microhedylacean
species known in detail show a small, simple and sac-like
kidney and a short nephroduct [7,8,10]. While members
of Hedylopsis were reported to have a simple, but long kidney [31,34,44], our re-examination of Hedylopsis ballantinei showed this species having a complex, bent kidney, as
well (own unpubl. data). Since this special type of kidney
seems present in all Hedylopsacea (Fig. 9), but neither in
microhedylacean acochlidians nor in potential outgroup
taxa, we propose that it has evolved in the mesopsammic
ancestor of hedylopsaceans. This organ thus is of marine
origin, still occurs in marine species and is equally structured in limnic species such as the basal, small Caribbean
Tantulum elegans and members of the more derived, large
Acochlidiidae that inhabit rivers of tropical Pacific
islands. The hedylopsacean kidney thus is assumed to be
a preadaptation and key feature to both, independent
invasions of a limnic habitat known from opisthobranchs. The evolution of excretory systems and the invasion of freshwater systems in acochlidians clearly merit
further study.
The most variable organ system within the Acochlidia is
the reproductive system. Lacking any sperm storage or
copulatory organs, the latter is considerably reduced from
a usual basal opisthobranch condition in all microhedylacean species [3,45]. In contrast, the special androdiaulic
genital system of P. cornuta with highly elaborated
cephalic copulatory organs is clearly more complex than
that assumed for the basal opisthobranch acochlidian
ancestors. In fact, the hedylopsacean topology as revealed
by Schrödl & Neusser [3] points towards the successively
increasing complexity of the copulatory system of hypodermal injectors in the hedylopsacean stem line. This is
confirmed herein (Fig. 9). The basal T. elegans lacks any
stylet on the penial muscle and sperm transfer occurs
probably by copulation [6]. Hedylopsis spiculifera shows a
single penial stylet for sperm transfer [40]. While H. bal-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/20

lantinei was described to potentially being aphallic [31],
we could detect two copulatory stylets or thorns in this
species (own unpubl. data); details must be explored in a
future study. In contrast, P. cornuta has an additional paraprostatic glandular system connected to another stylet
(Fig. 9). This is similar to the condition in Strubellia (own
unpubl. data), the most basal known member of Acochlidiidae. Schrödl & Neusser [3] assume that the function of
this accessory impregnation system might be the production of special fluids to enforce unilateral insemination or
stimulate sperm transfer. Thus, it might be to the best
advantage for each individual being the first in injecting
its own sperm and other fluids. Finally, the evolution of
complex copulatory organs peaks in the so-called giant
"rapto-penis" [3] of Acochlidium and Palliohedyle (Fig. 9).
A schematic overview of the different penial structures is
given in Schrödl & Neusser [3].
An increasing complexity of excretory and reproductive
organs that evolved in the hedylopsacean stemline already
in the mesopsammon (Fig. 9) clearly contradicts Swedmark's [4] hypothesis of a general evolutionary regression
in marine mesopsammic acochlidians.
But what are the reasons for the remarkable reduction of
the reproductive system in microhedylacean species on
the one hand and an otherwise increasing complexity in
hedylopsacean species on the other hand? Recently, Jörger
et al. [45] pointed out that the spatially limited interstitial
environment may favour unidirectional sperm transfer
while quickly passing by. In basally still hermaphroditic
microhedylaceans this occurs by means of spermatophores, dermal insemination (spermatophores are placed
somewhere on the body surface) and dermal fertilization
(allosperm penetrate the body wall and migrate to the
gonad for fertilization). Unidirectional sperm transfer,
together with the reduction of the copulatory system
might have been prerequisites for the evolution of gonochorism in the ancestor of Microhedylidae s.l., and they
all may have been key features for the successful radiation
of microhedylacean species [3]. Both the hypothetical
acochlidian ancestor and the most basal known hedylopsacean offshoot, Tantulum elegans, still use copulation for
sperm transfer. Since the latter species is a sequential hermaphrodite, sperm transfer is unilateral; this is, thus, the
ancestral condition for acochlidians (Fig. 9). According to
our data, unidirectional hypodermal impregnation within
the Acochlidia was established in the still mesopsammic
hedylopsacean lineage (Fig. 9); first in its most simple
form as expressed by Hedylopsis spiculifera. Comparisons
with other, non-mesopsammic opisthobranchs (e.g.
Sacoglossa, Nudibranchia) using hypodermal impregnation [43], will show whether or not an already unilateral
mode of sperm transfer may be a precondition for evolving hypodermal impregnation systems. Once established,

this more or less quick and violent mode of sperm transfer
grants for a selective advantage for injectors. Consequently, along the hedylopsacean stem lineage, more and
more sophisticated sperm and auxiliary injection systems,
such as very long penial and accessory paraprostatic stylets
in P. cornuta, have evolved already in marine mesopsammic environments (Fig. 9). These are similarly retained by
the benthic limnic Strubellia, but were elaborated into the
even more complex and potentially harmful copulatory
systems with a giant, armed "rapto-penis" [3] in the ancestor of an array of large-sized benthic, limnic Acochlidium
and Palliohedyle species (Fig. 9), which are no more such
spatially limited in their habitat.

Conclusion
Although miniaturization and reductions of organs are
characteristic for many interstitial acochlidian species [4],
P. cornuta shows a complex and complete set of organ systems in spite of the small body size. Remarkable is the
high complexity of reproductive organs that resembles
that of species of the much larger, limnic Acochlidiidae,
and especially the genus Strubellia. Unexpectedly, the
elaborated excretory system of the marine P. cornuta also
resembles that of limnic hedylopsacean acochlidians,
such as Tantulum and Acochlidiidae; the looped kidney
and nephroduct are interpreted as evolutionary preadaptations that contributed to successful invasions of limnic
systems within the otherwise generally marine Opisthobranchia. Structurally, Pseudunela cornuta thus links basal
marine with basal and derived limnic clades, reflecting its
recently proposed position on the acochlidian tree [3].
Importantly, organ complexity as seen in P. cornuta
(regarding excretory and reproductive features, at least) is
not plesiomorphically retained from a larger, benthic
ancestor, but represents innovations that evolved in small,
mesopsammic marine acochlidians. Earlier general statements on regressive, progenetic evolution in acochlidians
may be relevant for explaining the origin of Acochlidia or
that of microhedylacean lineages; P. cornuta, however,
definitely is an example for evolution of a wealth of
sophisticated structures within hedylopsaceans, the exact
function of some of which, such as the extremely long spiral penial stylet, still cannot be explained.
Challis' achievement of a quite detailed description has to
be acknowledged, since it was almost impossible to
describe the complexity of the reproductive system of P.
cornuta in detail without modern methods. This study
once again shows that semithin-histology combined with
computer-based 3D reconstruction is highly recommendable for studying the anatomy of micromolluscs, especially for obtaining reliable results that can be used for
phylogenetic analyses. An interactive way of publishing
3D models even more impressively demonstrates the
