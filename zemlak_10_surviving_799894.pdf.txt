Surviving historical Patagonian landscapes and
climate: molecular insights from Galaxias
maculatus

Abstract
Background: The dynamic geological and climatic histories of temperate South America have played important
roles in shaping the contemporary distributions and genetic diversity of endemic freshwater species. We use
mitochondria and nuclear sequence variation to investigate the consequences of mountain barriers and Quaternary
glacial cycles for patterns of genetic diversity in the diadromous fish Galaxias maculatus in Patagonia (~300
individuals from 36 locations).
Results: Contemporary populations of G. maculatus, east and west of the Andes in Patagonia, represent a single
monophyletic lineage comprising several well supported groups. Mantel tests using control region data revealed a
strong positive relationship when geographic distance was modeled according to a scenario of marine dispersal.
(r = 0.69, P = 0.055). By contrast, direct distance between regions was poorly correlated with genetic distance
(r = -0.05, P = 0.463). Hierarchical AMOVAs using mtDNA revealed that pooling samples according to historical
(pre-LGM) oceanic drainage (Pacific vs. Atlantic) explained approximately four times more variance than pooling
them into present-day drainage (15.6% vs. 3.7%). Further post-hoc AMOVA tests revealed additional genetic
structure between populations east and west of the Chilean Coastal Cordillera (coastal vs. interior). Overall female
effective population size appears to have remained relatively constant until roughly 0.5 Ma when population size
rapidly increased several orders of magnitude [100× (60×-190×)] to reach contemporary levels. Maximum likelihood
analysis of nuclear alleles revealed a poorly supported gene tree which was paraphyletic with respect to
mitochondrial-defined haplogroups.
Conclusions: First diversifying in the central/north-west region of Patagonia, G. maculatus extended its range into
Argentina via the southern coastal regions that join the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. More recent gene flow
between northern populations involved the most ancient and most derived lineages, and was likely facilitated by
drainage reversal(s) during one or more cooling events of the late Pleistocene. Overall female effective population
size represents the end result of a widespread and several hundred-fold increase over approximately 0.5 Ma,
spanning several climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene. The minor influence of glacial cycles on the genetic
structure and diversity of G. maculatus likely reflects the access to marine refugia during repeated bouts of global
cooling. Evidence of genetic structure that was detected on a finer scale between lakes/rivers is most likely the
result of both biological attributes (i.e., resident non-migratory behavior and/or landlocking and natal homing in
diadromous populations), and the Coastal Cordillera as a dispersal barrier.

Background
The past two decades of phylogeographic research have
tremendously increased our understanding of the evolutionary influences of Quaternary geological and climatic
events on endemic biodiversity, but research thus far
has been severely biased to regions of the Northern
Hemisphere [1]. Among the most neglected regions of
the Southern Hemisphere is South America. This finding is surprising considering that the tropics of South
America are expected to host an unmatched level of
species richness and represent one of the best natural
laboratories for studying speciation. Only recently has
the Amazonian rainforest been the focus of large-scale
surveys of intra-specific genetic variation aimed at
understanding the potential mechanisms contributing
to, and maintaining such high levels of species diversity
[2,3].
Phylogeographic patterns in temperate South America
have also received relatively little attention, but recent
studies point to the over-riding importance of two historic variables: the Andean mountain orogeny (starting
approximately 23 Ma [4]) and the glacial cycles of the
Quaternary (2.5 Ma - 10,000 bp). Estimated rates of
trans-Andean gene flow vary greatly among taxa, including one species of plant [5], two fishes [6,7], and several
mammals [8-10], but the continental divide represents a
barrier for all species examined to date. Post-glacial patterns of dispersal for several taxa indicate the existence
of several independent Quaternary glacial refugia east of
the Andes on the Patagonian Steppe [6,7,9,11-13], and
west of the Andes, both within [7,14] and outside of
northern and western limits of the glaciers
[6,7,12,14-16]. Populations persisting in some of these
refugia experienced repeated founder-flush cycles leading to the purging of genetic variance and resulting in
the development of genetic structure [17].
Phylogeographic patterns of aquatic organisms are largely determined by historical changes in hydrological
landscapes. In Patagonia, starting approximately 23 Ma
[4], the rise of the southern Andes created a continental
divide that separated eastern and western basins into
primarily Atlantic and Pacific drainages, and studies of
two freshwater species, Percichthys trucha [6] and
Galaxias platei [7] have shown that the uplift presented
a significant barrier to gene flow. Glacial advances during periods of global cooling in the Quaternary eliminated much southern and higher altitude aquatic habitat
[18,19], reducing and/or displacing populations. Patterns
of intra-specific genetic diversity of fishes and crabs suggest that multiple refugia existed to the north and east
of continental ice, as well as within glacial margins of
the central-west [6,7,14]. Important rearrangement of
basins also occurred during the retreat of continental

Page 2 of 18

glaciers in Patagonia [20]. The formation of temporary
but large proglacial lakes at the fringes of melting glaciers, coupled with high altitude mountain run-off,
probably allowed the exchange of aquatic organisms
among drainage basins, and allowed the expansion of
populations into unoccupied basins [7,14]. Catastrophic
shifts in drainage direction (from Atlantic to Pacific) in
several basins, as ice dams collapsed during the retreat
of glaciers, have been implicated as important vectors of
gene flow from E ® W across the Andean divide for
G. platei [7,20].
In the present study, we examined the potential consequences that major Quaternary geological and climatic
events in Patagonia had on the evolution of Galaxias
maculatus, one of the most widespread diadromous fish
species worldwide. We employed DNA sequence variation at both mitochondrial and nuclear loci from
G. maculatus populations throughout their range in
Patagonia to test for influences of mountain ranges as
barriers to gene flow and the roles of repeated Pleistocene glacial cycles in further shaping the contemporary
genetic diversity and structure of a diadromous fish. To
the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first
phylogeographic investigation of a diadromous fish species in temperate South America.
Galaxias maculatus is considered amphidromous, a
special case of catadromy characterized by a shortened
duration at sea. Disjunct populations of G. maculatus
are found in the coastal systems of southern Australia,
Tasmania, New Zealand and surrounding islands (e.g.
Lord Howe, Chattam, New Caledonia), and in the temperate latitudes of South America and the Malvinas
(Falkland) Islands [21-24]. Although both dispersal
[25,26] and vicariance [22,27] hypotheses have been proposed to explain this fragmented distribution, most
empirical evidence indicates that populations dispersed
from Australia to other locations by ocean currents
(West Wind Drift; herein WWD) [28-31].
The influence of the Andes mountains in shaping the
genetic structure of G. maculatus in Patagonia is uncertain. One possibility is that a widespread distribution
was established prior to the onset of Andean orogeny
and vicariance either temporarily, or permanently isolated eastern and western populations to create deep
genetic structure (vicariance). Equally likely is the establishment of a widespread distribution following Andean
uprise. Ancestral lineages could have persisted in either
eastern or western Patagonia and subsequently
expanded into the adjacent region (dispersal, W ® E or
E ® W). To better understand the colonization history
of the surviving lineage(s) that comprise contemporary
South American populations of G. maculatus we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of approximately

Zemlak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/67

300 individuals with respect to a suitable outgroup.
Vicariance assumes a widespread distribution prior to
Andean uprise, followed by a simultaneous division of
eastern and western locations to yield reciprocally
monophyletic haplotype assemblages. Alternatively, dispersal suggests that G. maculatus attained its widespread distribution throughout Patagonia following
Andean orogeny to imply that one location, either east
or west (depending on dispersal direction), was colonized prior to the establishment of populations on both
sides of the Andes. Phylogenetically, this would be
represented by the dispersing lineage being nested
within the source lineage. Assuming that G. maculatus
originally arrived in South America via WWD, a scenario involving E ® W dispersal would suggest local
extirpation of western populations followed by recolonization of an eastern lineage (Figure 1).
In the event that dispersal was an important component of colonization history, there are at least two
mechanisms that could have facilitated connections
between eastern and western Patagonia. First, the diadromous capacity of G. maculatus affords an indirect
route of marine-mediated stepping-stone dispersal.
Populations could have invaded from either eastern or
western sources by accessing the connection between
Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the southernmost tip of
South America. The second mechanism involves drainage reversals; a climate-induced shift in which formerly
Atlantic draining river systems catastrophically shifted
to assume an opposite direction of outflow into the
Pacific. Drainage reversals following the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM) are thought to have facilitated a direct
route of dispersal across the Andean divide for the codistributed freshwater species G. platei and could have
had similar implications for G. maculatus. Assuming
that colonization history reflects dispersal, we attempt

Page 3 of 18

to discern between the relative influences of direct
(trans-Andean) versus indirect (marine) modes of dispersal by comparing genetic distance with geographic
distance modeled under each scenario. Furthermore, we
test for the specific influences of drainage reversals following the LGM by comparing partitions of genetic variation according to the expected pre- and post-LGM
drainage patterns in Patagonia.
Finally, we examined the potential influence of
repeated Pleistocene glacial cycles on long-term effective
population size. The diadromous capacity of G. maculatus affords populations an additional and/or alternative
form of refuge in the much more stable marine realm.
The availability of marine refugia might have reduced,
or exempted populations from the founder-flush cycles
that are typically experienced by freshwater-limited taxa
[32-34], and the reshuffling effects of drainage reversals.
However, exceptions to an amphidromous life-cycle
have been reported for several populations in South
America in the form of physically landlocked and nonmigratory populations that remain exclusively within
freshwater throughout their life cycle. Depending on the
duration and frequency with which some populations
remained within freshwater in the past, glacial cycles
could have introduced new genetic structure and
reduced population sizes throughout parts of the range
of G. maculatus. Bayesian skyline plots are employed to
reconstruct long-term historical effective population
sizes over a period of repeated Pleistocene glacial
advances.

Methods
Sample collection and preservation

A total of 299 individuals were collected using seine
nets and electrofishing between 1998-2007 from 36
lakes and rivers throughout Argentina and Chile (Figure
2). Sample sizes varied according to location and region
(Table 1). Ninety (30%) individuals derived from 10
Argentinean lakes, and the remaining 209 individuals
were collected from 26 Chilean lakes/rivers. Sub-samples (gill, muscle, fin, blood) for molecular analyses were
fixed in 95% ethanol.

Prior to DNA extraction all tissue samples were dried of
ethanol by exposure to ambient temperature for
approximately 120 min. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the majority of sub-samples (10 μL of blood
or 2 × 2 mm 2 tissue) using the glassmilk procedure
described in [35] with slight modifications for execution
using a MultiPROBE® II HT PLUS EX robotic liquid
handling system (PerkinElmer). Sub-samples derived
from 2 Argentinean locations (Quillén, Espejo) showed
signs of tissue degradation and were extracted using

The northernmost Chilean locations are also classified according to relative position with the Coastal Cordillera, either west (Coastal) or east (Interior). Details
include the number of individuals sampled, local drainage basin membership (basin), GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude), and expected direction of ocean
drainage before (ancient) and after (current) the last glacial maximum [7,18,20], and location of headwaters as either coastal or Andean for a sub-set of Chilean

sequence data are listed for each location.

standard phenol/chloroform protocols, and subsequently
concentrated using ethanol precipitation [36].
A section of approximately 800 bp of the mitochondrial control region was amplified from all Chilean samples and the majority of Argentinean individuals using
the primer combination S-phe 5’-GCT TTA GTT AAG
CTA CG-3’ [37] and P3 5’-AAC TTC CAT CCT CAA
CTC CCA AAG-3’ [38]. The full mitochondrial genome
available in GenBank (NC_004594) was used to design
species specific forms of both S-phe (5’-GCT TTA CTT
AAG CTA CG-3’) and P3 (5’-AAC TCT CAC TCT
TAA CTC CCA AAG-3’) to amplify all individuals from
6 Argentinean locations (lakes Quillén, Espejo, Morenito, Hess, Martin, Steffen). PCR reactions were 25 μL:
2.5 μL 10× Reaction Buffer [100 mM KCl, 100 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 200 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.75, 22°C), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA], 2.5 μL dNTPs (2 μM each),
3.75 μL MgSO 4 (20 mM), 13 μL ddH 2 O, 0.25 μL of
each 10 μM primer, 1 U of Tsg Polymerase (Bio Basic
Inc.) and 2.0-2.5 μL of DNA template. A Mastercycler®
EP Gradient (Eppendorf) thermal cycler was used to
conduct all reactions under the following thermal
regime: an initial denaturing temperature of 94°C for
five min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute,

50°C for 1 minute 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute 30
seconds, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Nuclear DNA (approximately 600 bp) was also amplified from a subset of individuals (N = 26) selected based
on post-hoc information to represent each mitochondrial
haplogroup. These individuals represented rivers Bueno
(4), Valdivia (3), and Toltén (2) and lakes Llanquihue
(4), Tarahuin (5), and Natri (3) in Chile, and lakes
Argentino (4) and Martin (1) in Argentina. The target
locus was isolated using previously unpublished primer
sequences [ANL22 forward (5’-TGT TTG GCT TCT
ATG CAG GA-3’) and reverse (5’-TGC GAT CCA TCA
TCA ACT TT-3’)] which originated from a genomic
library aimed at isolating anonymous nuclear loci from
a closely allied species G. platei following protocols of
[39,40]. Except for an annealing temperature of 56°C,
the PCR conditions used to amplify the nuclear locus
were identical to those reported above for control region
data.
Amplicons were visualized using 1.0% agarose gels and
sent off site for bidirectional DNA sequencing at Macrogen Inc. locations in Korea and the USA. Each forward
and reverse sequence was edited using Sequencher™.
Sequences were aligned in ClustalX2 [41] using default

parameters and subsequently checked by eye. The complete alignment for control region data was compressed
into haplotypes using DnaSP 3.0 [42] and listed under
the following accessions in GenBank: GQ180504GQ180776. Ambiguous nuclear alleles, represented by
sequences containing 2 or more heterozygous base calls,
were separated with 100% probability using the program
PHASE v2.1.1 [43]. All alleles were confirmed to be free
of recombination using both RDP and MaxChi algorithms as executed in the program RDP3 [44], and subsequently blasted in GenBank to ensure no matches
with mitochondrial DNA. Nuclear allele sequences are
available in GenBank under the following accessions:
GQ180467-GQ180503.
Data Analysis (control region mtDNA)

Standard molecular diversity indices for control region
haplotypes [haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity
(π), nucleotide frequencies, transition/transversion ratio,
number of polymorphic sites] were calculated using
Arlequin 3.1 [45]. Phylogenetic relationships among
haplotypes were reconstructed using maximum likelihood methods as implemented in PHYML [46] using
the web based server PHYML-Online [47]. Modeltest
[48] selected the GTR+G (g = 0.5483) as the most
appropriate model of molecular evolution for phylogenetic analysis with branch support based on 100 bootstrap replicates. The outgroup was based on a single
Tasmanian G. maculatus control region haplotype
(NC_004594) because it represented the only full length
control region isolate available in GenBank that fully
overlapped with Patagonian derived haplotypes. However, auxiliary phylogenetic analyses were conducted
using partial isolates of control region sequences from
[30] (AF240184-AF240339) to justify the use of a single
sequence as an outgroup. Maximum likelihood analysis
of ~150 haplotypes derived from Tasmanian and New
Zealand origins indicate close associations between all
haplotypes derived from eastern Pacific sources and support Patagnonian haplotypes as a strongly supported
monophyletic group. Supplemental trees are available in
newick tree format as Additional files 1, 2.
Alternate dispersal scenarios were investigated using
Mantel Tests as implemented in Arelquin 3.1 [45] using
1000 bootstrap replicates. Collection locations were
grouped into regional categories based on both proximity and location with respect to the Andes (Table 1):
north west (NW), west 1 (W1), west 2 (W2), east (E)
and south east (SE). Approximate pairwise distances
(km) between regions were calculated from the central
geographic point using Google Earth according to two
models: first, a direct route across terrestrial landscape
to represent trans-Andean dispersal; second, an indirect
route to circumscribe the southern Andes via oceanic

Page 7 of 18

connections to represent marine-mediated dispersal
(Additional file 3). Genetic distances between regions
were based on standard pairwise estimates of FST calculated using Arlequin 3.1.
Hierarchical Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA), as executed in Arelquin 3.1 [45], was used
to determine how contemporary genetic variation is
partitioned over the range of G. maculatus. Groupings
included (1A) lake/river of collection, (1B) river drainage, (1C) present-day and, (1D) ancient (pre LGM)
ocean (Pacific or Atlantic) drainage. Further post-hoc
regional analysis was conducted for a subset of collection locations in Chile between latitudes 34°S and 40°S.
This regional consideration was motivated by distributional trends of haplotype groups which suggested
compositional differences between populations located
near the Pacific coast versus those located within the
continental interior of the Andean foothills (see Costal
Cordillera in results section). The analysis involved 17
collection sites from 10 river basins, all of which drain
into the Pacific Ocean (Table 2, Figure 3). Running in
a north to south orientation are two mountain ranges:
the Coastal Cordillera located near the Pacific coast,
and the Andean mountains to the east with the Central Valley in between the two mountain chains. Of the
10 river basins that were sampled, 4 originate in the
Andean foothills and bisect the Central Valley and the
Coastal Cordillera en route to draining into the Pacific
(Tolten, Valdivia, Bueno, Maullin), two of which were
represented by collection sites located on either side of
the Coastal Cordillera (Valdivia, Maullin). The remaining 6 basins originate within the Coastal Cordillera
and extend only a short distance to the coast (Topocalma, Nilahue, Reloca, Queule, Lingue, Contaco). We
grouped each population as “coastal” or “Andean” for
AMOVA analysis based on two criteria: (2A) location
of headwaters and (2B) location of collection site
(Table 1).
Historical population sizes of G. maculatus were
estimated using the coalescent-based Bayesian skyline
plot [49] as implemented in the program BEAST 1.4
[50]. Priors included the GTR+G+I model of molecular
evolution with an estimated substitution rate matrix
(A-C = 1.35, A-G = 7.83, A-T = 0.34, C-G = 1.02, C-T
= 3.47, G-T = 1.0) as determined by Modeltest [48],
and implemented a mutational timescale of 0.01876
substitutions/site/My appropriate for galaxiids [51].
Starting operators were based on default settings and
auto-optimized during searches of parameter space
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
procedures. Parameter estimates were based on posterior probability distributions constructed by sampling
the stationary distribution for 40,000,000 generations,
sampling every 1000 steps.

Data Analysis (nuclear locus)

Standard molecular indices were calculated as per the
mtDNA control region. Unrooted phylogenetic relationships among alleles were reconstructed using maximum
likelihood methods as implemented in PHYML [46]
using the web based server PHYML-Online [47]. Modeltest [48] selected the K81uf+G (g = 0.5759) as the
most appropriate substitution model. Branch support
was based on 100 bootstrap replicates.

Results
A total of 273 mtDNA control region haplotypes were
identified from 299 individuals of G. maculatus collected from throughout the species distribution in South
America (Additional file 4). Overall nucleotide frequencies were: A (28.94%), C (24.30%), G (19.36%), T
(27.41%). The total number of polymorphic sites was
250, with a transition/transversion ratio of 2.16, 92
observed indels, an average of 37.71 +/- 16.44 pairwise

differences between sequences (4.6 +/- 2.0%), a nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.9989 +/- 0.0005 and haplotype
diversity (h) of 0.046394 +/- 0.022376. Individual
nucleotide and haplotype diversity estimates are listed
for each location in Table 1, and do not vary according
to latitude.
Nineteen unique alleles were recovered from the 26
individuals sequenced at the nuclear locus, and over half
of the individuals (61%) were homozygous for a given
allele. Overall nucleotide frequencies were: 32.7% (A),
17.7% (C), 21.3% (G) and 28.3% (T). The total number
of polymorphic sites was 19, with a trasition/transversion ratio of 0.58, no indels, an average of 2.35 +/0.002 pairwise differences between sequences, a nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.0039 +/- 0.0024 and haplotype
diversity (h) of 0.8679 +/- 0.0495. Maximum likelihood
analysis of alleles revealed a poorly supported gene tree
which was paraphyletic with respect to mitochondrialdefined haplogroups (Figure 4).
Evidence of marine dispersal

Maximum likelihood analysis of mitochondrial control
region haplotypes revealed four distinct clusters (Figure
5). The four clusters (herein referred to as haplogroups
1-4) included the following haplotypes: (1) 255-271, (2)
245-254, (3) 212-244, (4) 1-211. Smaller, well supported
clusters were also recognized within haplogroups 3 and
4 (herein sub-groups): (3a) 233-243, (4a) 206-210, (4b)
103-118, (4c) 25-100. Haplotypes 272-273 formed a distinct, well-supported branch among basal lineages, but
was not recognized as a separate sub-group because of
low sampling density (i.e. only consisted of 2
haplotypes).
When frequency of each haplogroup at each collection
location is plotted by geographic location (Figure 6), we
obtain a pattern reflective of dispersal from W ® E.
Northern Chilean Patagonia hosts the most diverse
assemblage of haplotype groups. By contrast, populations in Argentina had mostly haplotypes from subgroups nested within haplogroup 4; sub-group 4c dominated the northern Andean locations (Limay & Manso
river basins) and haplogroup 4b was ubiquitous in
southern Andean locations (lakes Roca and Argentino).
Haplogroup 1 is primarily limited to the northwest
coastal regions of Chile, except for very minor representation in the most northern drainage of Argentina. The
most geographically widespread lineage, haplogroup 4,
was found in both Chile and Argentina.
Mantel tests supported the marine realm as the most
important route of dispersal into eastern Patagonia (Figure 7). A comparison of pairwise FST versus geographic
distance yielded a strong positive relationship when distance was modeled according to a scenario of marine
dispersal (r = 0.69, P = 0.055). By contrast, direct

Page 9 of 18

distance between regions was poorly correlated with
genetic distance (r = -0.05, P = 0.463).
Drainage reversals

We conducted several hierarchical AMOVAs using control region sequences. First, when all collection sites
(lake or river) were considered independently, 61% of
the total variance in sequences was explained by differences among collection sites and 39% by variation
among individuals within sites (Table 2). Grouping the
36 lakes/river collections into 17 basins explained nearly
30% of the total variance (Table 2) suggesting that
populations from different lakes within river systems are
more similar to each other than they are to populations
in other river drainage systems. Thirdly, pooling samples
according to their historical (pre-LGM) oceanic drainage
(Pacific vs. Atlantic) explained approximately four times
more variance than pooling them into present-day drainage (15.6% vs. 3.7%, Table 2) suggesting some of the
systems that currently drain into the Pacific Ocean may
historically have drained into the Atlantic Ocean.
The Coastal Cordillera

We conducted an AMOVA considering only coastal and
Andean river basins within latitudes 34°S and 40°S in
Chile. This analysis revealed that grouping samples
according to collection site (coastal vs. interior, with
coastal being west and interior being east of the Coastal
Cordillera) explained approximately twice as much
genetic variation (13.93%) than grouping samples
according to where the headwaters lie (Andean vs.
coastal) (6.64%). This finding suggests that downstream
populations of Andean systems in this region of Chile
are more similar to populations of other coastal rivers
than to upstream populations within their own river systems and suggests that the Coastal Cordillera may
represent a partial barrier to geneflow (Table 2).
There were marked differences between coastal and
Andean populations in Chile, particularly at mid-latitudes. Western Andean populations (Valdivia basin) are
much more closely allied with populations east of the
Andes at the same latitude (Limay & Manso river
basins) than with a western coastal collection site within
the same basin (Rio Valdivia) (Fig 6).
Demography

Demographic reconstructions based on control region
haplotypes revealed long-established maternal effective
population sizes which coalesce at approximately 3.2
million years BP (Figure 8). Effective population size
appears to have remained relatively constant until
roughly 0.5 million years BP when population size
rapidly increased several orders of magnitude [100×
(60×-190×)] to reach contemporary levels.

Discussion
Of the potential vicariant processes associated with historical shifts in landscape and climate of ancient Patagonia, only mountain orogeny appears to have had
significant influence on the distribution and genetic
structure of G. maculatus. Effective population size
increased through the past 0.5 Ma despite repeated periods of glacial advance and retreat. The role of Quaternary climatic cycles appears restricted to northern
drainages where river drainage diversion swapped representatives of two divergent lineages. Otherwise, genetic
structure appears to be a consequence of the variations
in the life history of G. maculatus, responding to

isolation from the sea (landlocking) or to other factors
limiting female dispersal.
Evolutionary Structure

Contemporary G. maculatus populations form several
distinct matrilineal lineages whose phylogeographic signal suggests a probable pattern of dispersal and diversification within Patagonia. Extant populations are most
likely derived from coastal populations in northern Chilean Patagonia. This region contains most of the current
genetic diversity. One haplogroup (4) is common on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as in the Beagle
Channel. Two sub-groups of haplogroup 4, sub-groups

based on mitochondrial control region haplotypes.

b and c, are almost entirely restricted to Andean locations, and the latter is more common in the north and
found in both western and eastern drainages.
These patterns, combined with evidence of Isolation
by Distance (IBD) under a scenario of marine dispersal
(Mantel tests), suggest that G. maculatus began to
diversify in systems of Northern Chilean Patagonia and
subsequently spread south along the Pacific coast, colonizing adjacent coastal systems via stepping-stone dispersal, eventually reaching Atlantic systems via the
southern tip of South America. On the Atlantic side,
range expansion and diversification likely continued
northward and westward. Haplogroup 4 was likely
responsible for establishing the widespread distribution
of G. maculatus on the eastern side of the Andes, given
its current distribution and abundance. The pattern of
expansion thus contrasts with those of other co-distributed, but freshwater-limited species such as Percichthys
trucha and the closely related G. platei whose widespread contemporary distributions more strongly reflect
the effects of vicariant separation initiated by mountain
uplift [6,7]. Within a more recent timeframe, the invasive, diadromous Chinook salmon has followed a route
to Argentina similar to that of G. maculatus after escaping from aquaculture pens in Pacific Chilean waters
[52].
The strong matrilineal structure found in control
region sequences suggests limited female dispersal
among populations, but does not indicate whether male

dispersal has also been restricted or if haplogroups
represent only female philopatry. Contrasting genetic
signatures between nuclear and mitochondrial markers
are commonly employed to evaluate alternate explanations, and disagreement between marker classes is taken
as evidence for sex-biased dispersal. However, in the
present case, supplemental analysis at a single variable
nuclear locus failed to provide a clear answer. The
resulting nuclear gene tree was paraphyletic with respect
to each haplogroup (Figure 4), a result which could be
explained by inter-lineage hybridization via malemediated gene flow or by the persistence of ancestral
polymorphisms in isolated populations because of
incomplete lineage sorting. Male-biased dispersal has
been recognized in several species of fishes [53-55], and
considering that polygamous mating strategies are
thought to encourage male-biased dispersal [56], it
seems plausible to consider that such a pattern could
arise in a broadcast spawner such as G. maculatus. The
large differences between coastal and Andean populations in Chile, however, are likely due to restricted dispersal by both sexes, as many of the Andean rivers and
lakes are landlocked or are far from the sea with populations that are non-migratory [38,39]. Physical isolation
or landlocking has been recognized several times as an
important mechanism of diversification within galaxiids
at both population and species levels [57-59]. Further
investigation will be required to fully understand the
biological explanations of genetic structure revealed by

Zemlak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/67

mitochondrial signal. In particular, several additional,
independent nuclear loci are required in order to provide the statistical framework to confidently distinguish
between instances of secondary contact and incomplete
lineage sorting [60]. Our laboratory is currently developing suitable primers to address this problem.
South American populations of G. maculatus appear
to show stronger regional genetic structuring than do
populations in the eastern Pacific. In addition to our
findings, Waters et al. [29] reported unexpectedly high
estimates of genetic divergences at cytochrome b
between the Malvinas (Falkland) islands and mainland
populations. Zattara & Premoli [61] also found genetic
signatures consistent with restricted geneflow between
adjacent, landlocked populations in Argentina based on
allozyme frequencies. By contrast, molecular studies in
the eastern Pacific (i.e. New Zealand, Australia, Tasmania) suggest that G. maculatus is an uninhibited disperser capable of maintaining both regional and transoceanic gene flow. Baker and Lambert [62] found no
evidence for genetic structuring between 4 populations
from the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand using measures of
geneflow based on several allozyme loci. Further phylogeographic analysis generalized this finding by reporting
very little genetic structure between several broadly distributed locations throughout New Zealand [30]. DNA
sequence data and allozyme-based studies also support
recent trans-ocean dispersal between the eastern-Pacific
continents [28,30]. These contrasting patterns suggest
that the genetic structuring observed in Patagonian
populations of G. maculatus may perhaps be unusual
for the species.
Drainage Reversals

The presence of the same haplogroups in eastern and
western draining basins in the northern Patagonian
Andean populations suggests that, in contrast to the
coastal mountains in Chile, there has been substantial
gene flow across the Andes. Two very divergent groups
(1 and 4c) were found on both sides of the continental
divide in this region. We suggest that rearrangement of
the hydrological landscape during the Pleistocene, systems that experienced one or more drainage reversals
between Pacific and Atlantic, is the mechanism most
likely responsible for bidirectional, trans-Andean gene
flow of G. maculatus, producing a distribution of
genetic diversity that is better explained by ancient drainage direction than by current orientation. Along the
latitudinal range of the Andes in Patagonia, there are
several examples of river systems with headwaters originating in Argentina that bisect the mountains to drain
into the Pacific. Continental ice during the LGM
imposed a western barrier to aquatic systems east of the
Andes forcing their flow into the Atlantic [20].

Page 15 of 18

Subsequent periods of warming created large accumulations of melt water (paleolakes) at the eastern fringe of
glacial mountain ice, dammed by terminal moraines in
the east and the ice itself in the west. The collapse of
the western barriers of these meltwater paleolakes as the
ice melted resulted in a catastrophic drainage reversal
from the Atlantic to the Pacific [18,20,63], with a significant flood of glacial melt water and any associated biota.
For example, the Valdivia river system in Chile has its
headwaters (Lago Lácar) in Argentina, and populations
of G. maculatus in its Andean lakes are phylogenetically
more closely allied with the northern populations of
Argentina (Limay, Manso river basins) than with other
nearby Chilean populations. The same mechanism is
thought to be responsible for introducing eastern
lineages of G. platei into the west [7]. In the present
study, the presence of haplotypes of haplogroup 1 east
of the Andes in Lake Quillén (Figure 5) suggests that
dispersal also occurred west to east. The geological
mechanism(s) that could have facilitated this exchange
is not known. Perhaps individuals of G. maculatus occupied the headwaters of an ancient Pacific drainage which
historically originated on the eastern side and were
diverted along with the headwaters toward the Atlantic
as glacial ice formed. Pleistocene-induced alterations in
freshwater hydrology, especially river capture, have been
very important influences on contemporary diversity
within the Galaxiidae in New Zealand as well [64-69].
Historical Demography

Long-term and widespread increases in effective population size despite repeated bouts of glacial advance
throughout the Pleistocene suggest that contemporary
populations of G. maculatus inhabiting post-glacial
regions may have retreated to marine-based refugia during periods of global cooling. Bayesian skyline plots indicated only upward trends in female effective size over
the past 0.5 Ma. Unvarying estimates of high haplotype,
but low nucleotide diversity across sample locations are
also consistent with genetic signatures of widespread
population growth [70]. Access to stable marine environments would have released G. maculatus from the
genetic purging via founder-flush cycles typically associated with freshwater refugia and would explain the
contrasting patterns revealed in other co-distributed
Patagonian freshwater fishes that showed evidence of at
least one genetic bottleneck during the late Pleistocene
[17]. A review of patterns of genetic diversity in the
Palearctic and Nearctic revealed that this strategy
appears to be widespread among diadromous fishes of
the northern hemisphere [32,33,71], and is likely extendible to G. maculatus in the southern hemisphere. The
reason for constant increase, however, is less clear. Perhaps the concomitant period of dramatic cooling was

Zemlak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/67

responsible for creating a scenario of ecological release
in which severe conditions evicted most inhabitants
from several Patagonian systems and allowed the uninhibited invasion of G. maculatus from several healthy
marine-based sources. Interestingly, the period during
which this invasion appears to have taken place immediately follows the coldest Patagonian glaciation approximately 0.7 Ma, which was responsible for dramatic
declines in population sizes of the co-distributed freshwater galaxiid, Galaxias platei[17]. Perhaps similar glacial-induced extirpations affected other native species
and provided the right motivation for G. maculatus to
invade the eastern systems of Argentina.

Conclusions
This study provides important insights into the potential
mechanisms responsible for influencing the distribution
and diversity of G. maculatus throughout Patagonia.
Vicariant processes associated with mountain building
and climate-induced drainage shifts appear to have been
particularly influential in determining access routes of
dispersal throughout Patagonia. Population sizes, however, remained very resilient in spite of repeated climatic
shifts suggesting that marine environments played very
important roles as glacial refugia on perhaps several
occasions throughout the Quaternary. Several questions
relating to the biology of G. maculatus also emerged
based on the fine-scale phylogeographic structure,
including the potential contributions of gender-specific
dispersal and/or landlocking to population-level structuring. These broad-scale interpretations of genetic
structure provide a much needed historical context
within which studies of metapopulation dynamics can
be properly interpreted, as well as a priori knowledge of
regional diversity for phylogeographic and phylogenetic
analyses.
