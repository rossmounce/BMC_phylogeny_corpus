Abstract
Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), widespread pollutants in the marine
environment, can produce adverse effects in marine organisms and can be transferred to humans through
seafood. Our knowledge of PAH-degrading bacterial populations in the marine environment is still very
limited, and mainly originates from studies of cultured bacteria. In this work, genes coding catabolic
enzymes from PAH-biodegradation pathways were characterized in coastal sediments of Patagonia with
different levels of PAH contamination.
Results: Genes encoding for the catalytic alpha subunit of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases
(ARHDs) were amplified from intertidal sediment samples using two different primer sets. Products were
cloned and screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Clones representing each
restriction pattern were selected in each library for sequencing. A total of 500 clones were screened in 9
gene libraries, and 193 clones were sequenced. Libraries contained one to five different ARHD gene types,
and this number was correlated with the number of PAHs found in the samples above the quantification
limit (r = 0.834, p < 0.05). Overall, eight different ARHD gene types were detected in the sediments. In
five of them, their deduced amino acid sequences formed deeply rooted branches with previously
described ARHD peptide sequences, exhibiting less than 70% identity to them. They contain consensus
sequences of the Rieske type [2Fe-2S] cluster binding site, suggesting that these gene fragments encode
for ARHDs. On the other hand, three gene types were closely related to previously described ARHDs:
archetypical nahAc-like genes, phnAc-like genes as identified in Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2, and phnA1-like
genes from marine PAH-degraders from the genus Cycloclasticus.
Conclusion: These results show the presence of hitherto unidentified ARHD genes in this sub-Antarctic
marine environment exposed to anthropogenic contamination. This information can be used to study the
geographical distribution and ecological significance of bacterial populations carrying these genes, and to
design molecular assays to monitor the progress and effectiveness of remediation technologies.

Background
The Southwest Atlantic coast forms the border of one of
the most productive marine ecosystems [1]. Extending
south of 40°S latitude, the Patagonian coast holds an
exceptional biodiversity, sustaining important breeding
colonies and feeding grounds for seabirds and marine
mammals. One of the most significant threats to the conservation of the overall health of this marine ecosystem is
the pollution produced as a result of anthropogenic activities. The main sources of pollution in the region are the
release of untreated effluents into coastal waters, fishing
and cargo activities as well as oil exploitation and transportation [2]. In particular, anthropogenic hydrocarbons
have been detected in sediments at several locations along
the Patagonian coast [3,4], and high levels of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found in marine
mammals after an oil spill [5]. The characterization of
indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations is therefore necessary for a better understanding of
natural biodegradation processes in this vulnerable ecosystem and for the successful application of bioremediation technologies.
PAHs are a diverse group of compounds composed of two
or more fused aromatic rings, which can have petrogenic,
pyrogenic or biogenic origins [6]. The persistence of PAHs
in the environment is largely due to their low aqueous solubility, which also results in its association with particulate and sedimentary material and low bioavailability [7].
Typically, the initial step in the aerobic biodegradation of
PAHs is the introduction of both atoms of an oxygen molecule at two adjacent carbon atoms of the aromatic
nucleus to produce a cis-dihydrodiol, a prerequisite for the
fission of the aromatic compound [8]. This step is catalyzed by an aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase
(ARHD), a soluble multicomponent enzyme composed
of an iron-sulfur flavoprotein reductase, an iron-sulfur
ferredoxin and an oxygenase component, whose active
site interacts with the aromatic compound [9]. The structure of the naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas
putida strain NCIB 9816-4 has been the prototype for all
members of the family of ARHDs [10]. The oxygenase
component of this enzyme system, naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, is composed of two subunits with a α3β3 structure, each α subunit containing two distinct domains: a
Rieske domain that contains a [2Fe-2S] center and a catalytic domain that contains a non-heme ferrous iron ion
[10].
Functional marker genes, encoding key enzymes of characteristic metabolic pathways, are often used to specifically target functional guilds of microorganisms because
they aid in assigning a likely function for the detected
microorganisms in the environment [11]. Although this
strategy is able to compensate for some limitations associ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/50

ated with 16S rRNA gene analysis, available information
about the actual genetic diversity of functional gene markers is still limited, and presents a strong bias towards
sequences that originate from cultured bacteria. In the
case of PAH-biodegradation, the generally used gene
marker encodes for the large subunit of the catalytic component of the ARHDs, which has been shown to confer
substrate specificity [12]. The most extensively characterized group of PAH-dioxygenase genes, a highly conserved
group called nah-like genes, have been identified in Pseudomonas species [13]. More recently, PAH-dioxygenase
genes that are evolutionarily different from the nah-like
genes have been characterized, and the information about
these genes is rapidly expanding [8]. Some of these distinct dioxygenase genes were identified in bacteria isolated from the marine environment such as from different
strains belonging to the genus Cycloclasticus [14,15],
Nocardioides [16], or Neptunomonas and Pseudoalteromonas
[17,18]. However, the available information concerning
PAH-dioxygenase gene diversity in the marine environment is still sparse, in particular from uncultured bacteria.
The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge of
functional marker genes for PAH biodegradation from the
marine environment. We used a culture-independent
approach, based on the amplification, cloning and
sequencing of ARHD gene fragments from intertidal sediments of Patagonia with different levels of hydrocarbon
contamination. We identified eight distinct ARHD gene
types, five of them showing low levels of identity with previously identified dioxygenases.

Results
Sampling sites and PAH concentrations
Surficial intertidal sediment samples were collected at
twelve different locations along the coastline of Patagonia, Argentina. Seven of the sampling sites (north to
south: PF, MS, MP, PC, GR, AR and CR) are situated along
the eastern coast of Patagonia, at the Chubut Province,
next to the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1 and Additional file 1).
In contrast, the five remaining sites (west to east: BG, SC,
EM, OR, and OL) are located on the south coast of the Big
Island of Tierra del Fuego, next to the Beagle Channel. All
sites were sampled once except for OR, which was sampled during three consecutive years. All samples were
named by their sampling site and the year in which the
samples were retrieved.

PAH concentrations as well as sampling dates are shown
in Table 1. Total PAH concentrations of samples MP04,
EM06 and OR06 were greater than 1700 μg per kg of dry
weight sediment (μg/kg dry wt. sediment), and the
number of PAHs detected varied widely between these
samples: 1, 2 and 11, respectively. Most of these PAHs
exceeded sediment quality guidelines set to protect
aquatic life (Table 1, [19]). In addition, four samples

ARHD gene libraries
Construction of ARHD gene libraries
Clone libraries of PCR-amplified gene fragments coding
for the α-subunit of ARHDs were prepared using DNA
extracted from coastal sediment samples from Patagonia.
High molecular weight DNA (between 10 and 20 Kb) was
obtained from all the samples (data not shown). Primers
Ac114F and Ac596R [20] produced amplification products of the expected size in half of the analyzed intertidal
sediment DNA samples (data not shown). PCR products
from seven samples were used to construct the gene libraries Ac-MS05, Ac-GR06, Ac-SC04, Ac-EM06, Ac-OR04, AcOR05 and Ac-OR06. These gene libraries were analyzed
by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
using the HaeIII restriction endonuclease. All clones
showing restriction patterns with a low rate of recurrence
in the library were sequenced. For RFLP patterns detected
at a high frequency, on the other hand, between 7 and 16
clones were randomly chosen per library for sequencing.

To eliminate from the analysis those clones produced as a
result of nonspecific priming, the sequences (excluding
primer binding sites) were first compared with the GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST, [21]). Approximately 75% of the clones carrying inserts of the expected size by gel electrophoresis
(362 out of 479 clones) showed significant similarities
with α-subunit ARHD gene fragments. Clones carrying
amplification products produced due to mispriming
events occurred in almost all libraries, and represented up
to 50% of the analyzed clones in some samples. The most
common nonspecific sequence found in the libraries was
480 bp and showed homology with transcriptional regulatory proteins (data not shown). Nonspecific amplification was not entirely unexpected, because PCR
amplifications were performed using a low annealing
temperature as previously reported for this primer set
(43°C, [20]), in an effort to facilitate binding of the primers even with minor sequence variations at their binding
sites.
Composition of ARHD gene libraries
Three different insert sizes were found within the 132
sequenced clones that contained ARHD gene fragments:
479 bp, 482 bp and 485 bp. Sequence analysis of all
clones clearly separated them into 7 distinct groups,
which were defined in this work as different gene types or
ARHD alleles. The lowest sequence identity at the amino
acid level within a defined group was 94%, and the highest sequence identity between groups was 68.7%. Each
library contained between 1 and 5 different gene types
(Figure 2A), and this number was correlated with the
number of PAHs found in the samples above the quantification limit (r = 0.834, p < 0.05). One of these gene
types, found in four libraries (Ac-GR06, Ac-EM06, AcOR05 and Ac-OR06, Figure 2A), showed significant similarities with archetypical nahAc-like genes from Pseudomonas spp. (97 to 100% DNA and peptide identities
with naphthalene dioxygenase from P. putida NCIB 9816,
[GenBank: AF491307]). All these clones had an insert size
of 482 bp. A second gene type, 479 bp long, was found in
four different sediment samples (Ac-MS05, Ac-GR06, AcSC04 and Ac-OR04) and showed high similarity values
with the phnAc gene identified in Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2
(95 to 98% identity at the nucleotide level and 95 to 99%
identity at the amino acid level, [GenBank: AB024945]).
Both phnAc- and nahAc-like genes were detected in the
same sediment sample only in one library, Ac-GR06 (Figure 2A).

The five remaining gene types found in coastal sediments,
named A to E, were only modestly related (58 to 68%
identity in their deduced amino acid sequences) to ARHD
sequences from the databases. These sequences had significant matches with ARHD sequences only when using the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/50

tblastx program of BLAST, which compares the translated
query versus the translated database, but not when using
the nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn program, [21]).
All A, B and E gene types had an insert size of 479 bp, type
D gene fragments had 482 bp, and type C inserts were 485
bp long. Alignments of all ARHD nucleotide sequences
showed gaps of 3 contiguous bases (data not shown),
which were converted into one amino acid gaps in the
alignment of the translated sequences [see Additional file
2]. Moreover, two of these gaps were shared by four (types
A, B, E and PhnAc-like) or five (types A, D, E, PhnAc- and
NahAc-like) groups at the same position.
Figure 2B shows the alignment of the deduced amino acid
residues from the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster binding site
of representative clones found in this work, and sequences
of two previously identified PAH-dioxygenases (NahAc
from P. putida NCIB 9816-4 and PhnAc from A. faecalis
AFK2) closely related to sequences found in the libraries.
A number of residues reported to be critical in the Rieske
[2Fe-2S] binding site were fully conserved in the alignment shown in Figure 2B (consensus alignment). Nearly
all these sites were also fully conserved in the 132
sequenced clones (consensus all clones, Figure 2B).
The number of identified gene types and their relative
abundances were used to measure diversity and dominance indices of the ARHD gene libraries (Table 2). The
information used to calculate these indices was limited to
those sequences able to amplify with this primer set,
therefore, it is not possible to make any assumptions
about the actual diversity of PAH-degrading bacteria in
the communities. The Shannon's diversity index (H) was
higher in the Ac-OR06 library, constructed with the sample showing the highest number of PAHs (Table 1). Diversity indices decreased in the following order: Ac-OR04,
Ac-OR05, Ac-GR06 and Ac-EM06. Simpson's dominance
indices (L) were the lowest in both Ac-OR06 and Ac-OR04
libraries, and increased in the following order: Ac-GR06,
Ac-OR05 and Ac-EM06. Despite having only two alleles
(phnAc-like and novel type A), library Ac-OR04 presented
a relatively high diversity value and a low dominance
index, since these two gene types were found in almost
equal relative proportions. Phenanthrene was the only
PAH detected in the OR04 sample (Table 1). In libraries
Ac-MS05 and Ac-SC04 only one type of allele was identified, phnAc-like, and therefore both showed the lowest
diversity index and the highest dominance index (Table
2). Phenanthrene was the only PAH detected in the MS05
sample, while naphthalene and phenanthrene were the
only PAHs found at concentrations above quantification
limits in sample SC04. Coverage values (C) in the seven
ARHD gene libraries were high, ranging from 98% to
100% (Table 2).

Phylogenetic analysis
The amplified ARHD gene fragments were analyzed phylogenetically in order to infer their relationships with other
known dioxygenases. Sequences belonging to types A to E
formed deeply rooted branches with previously described
dioxygenase peptide sequences (Figure 3). The closest relatives of A-type sequences were phenanthrene dioxygenases related to PhnAc from A. faecalis AFK2 (67–68% and
78–79% deduced amino acid identities and similarities,
respectively). B-type sequences, on the other hand, were
most related to BphA from the marine chemoorganotrophic bacterium Porphyrobacter sanguineus IAM 12620,
formerly Agrobacterium sanguineum (68% identity and
82% similarity, [GenBank: BAB55875]). Types C and D
were very distantly related (58–60% identity, 75% similarity) to other dioxygenases, and are the most divergent
lineages among all these gene types. E-type sequences, on
the other hand, were most related to the large subunit of
the phenanthrene dioxygenase from Burkholderia sp.
RP007 (also called PhnAc, 65% identity and 81% similarity, [GenBank: AAD09872]).

From Figure 3, it is not possible to assign potential substrates for these gene types, although types A and E fall,
together with all NahAc- and PhnAc-type sequences,
inside the naphthalene/phenanthrene family as defined
by Gibson and Parales [9]. Sequences from this group,
including PhnAc from strains AFK2 and RP007, NahAc
from Pseudomonas strains and NagAc from Ralstonia sp.
U2, were classified as Group III ring-hydroxylating oxygenases based on sequence homology [22] and fall into
Group III of the Batie classification system, based on the
constituent components and the nature of the redox centers of the enzymes forming the electron-transport chain
[23,24]. Gene types B, C and D, on the other hand, were
excluded in the phylogenetic tree from previously defined
families based on substrate (toluate/benzoate, toluene/
biphenyl, and phthalate families) [9].

To illustrate the relationships between PhnAc and NahAc
type sequences and their close relatives, clone sequences
clustered into 99% deduced amino acid identity groups
were aligned with reference sequences from the databases,
and two phylogenetic trees were created (Figure 4A and
4B). The five PhnAc type (AFK2) ARHD sequences deposited in the databases at the present time were aligned with
PhnAc-like sequences found in coastal sediments (Figure
4A). Deduced amino acid sequences of all phnAc-like
clones found in sediment libraries exhibited 94.5 to
99.3% sequence identity with the PhnAc sequences identified to date from pure cultures. Phylogenetic analysis of
PhnAc-like sequences retrieved from sediment libraries
and the ones from pure cultures revealed two clades, one
containing phenanthrene dioxygenase sequences from
the isolates Burkholderia sp. strains Cs1-4, Ch1-1, Ch3-5
and Eh1-1 and a second one with PhnAc from A. faecalis
AFK2 (Figure 4A). Representatives from both clades were
found in the Ac-OR04 library. On the other hand, all AcSC04 and Ac-MS05 PhnAc-like sequences clustered within
the Burkholderia clade, while all Ac-GR06 PhnAc-like gene
fragments clustered within the A. faecalis AFK2 clade (Figure 4A).
NahAc-type sequences formed two distinct, highly supported groups, one of them included sequences from
Pseudomonas stutzeri strain AN10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
PAK1 and Pseudomonas balearica SP1402 and the other
clade included sequences belonging to P. putida strains
NCIB 9816-4, G7, OUS82 and other related Pseudomonas
isolates (Figure 4B). Both groups include sequences from
marine isolates (marked with asterisks in the tree) and
have been described previously as AN10 and C18 groups
respectively [25]. Only sequences from the C18 cluster
were detected in coastal sediments. This is not unexpected
since the AN10 group was most probably not targeted by
the primers used in this work (all sequences show mismatches with at least one of the primers used).
Construction and analysis of phnA1-like ARHD gene libraries
A primer set was designed to target phnA1-like ARHD
sequences from bacteria belonging to the genus Cycloclasticus. This primer set successfully amplified a ~500 bp fragment from Cycloclasticus pugetii PS-1 (ATCC 51542),
which was confirmed as a phnA1 gene fragment by
sequencing. Amplifications with this primer set also
resulted in products of the expected size in samples MP04,
GR06, AR06, SC04, OR04 and OR05 (data not shown).
Samples PF05, MS05, CR05, OR06, EM06 and OL06 were

of samples SC04 and OR05 were cloned and analyzed by

chosen for sequencing. Deduced amino acid sequences of
these clones had identity values between 98.6 and 100%
with sequences from Cycloclasticus isolates [GenBank:
BAC81541, AAC95148, AAC95146, AAD04819 and
ABF56510]. The lowest identity value corresponds to one
clone carrying a transcription termination site. This clone
could represent a non-functional pseudogene or a PCR
artefact.
Other primer sets analyzed
Primer sets targeting other known PAH-dioxygenase genes
were designed and tested with sediment DNA. The groups
targeted were Neptunomonas and Pseudoalteromonas [GenBank: AF053735, AF053736, AF295036], Burkholderia sp.
RP007 and related genes [GenBank: AF061751,
AY154358,
AY154360,
AY540615–AY540620,
AY154362, AY154365 and AY032936–AY032937] as well
as nagAc-like genes [GenBank: AF036940, AF252550,

AF379638,

AF169302,

AB066442,
DQ167474,
AF448048, AF448053, AB066443–AB066445 and
AY194931]. We were not able to successfully amplify
these gene fragments from the sediment DNA (data not
shown). However, it is important to note that these genes
could be present in the sediment but below the detection
limit of the technique, or the genes present in these samples might be too divergent to be recognized by the primer
sets.

Discussion
In this study, we characterized ARHD genes in intertidal
sediments from the Argentinean coast of Patagonia. We
used a culture-independent approach, screening catabolic
gene libraries prepared with two primer sets, one previously designed using ARHD gene sequences from PAHdegrading bacteria commonly found in terrestrial environments [20], and a second one targeting marine PAHdegrading bacteria belonging to the genus Cycloclasticus
(this study). Wilson et al. [20] designed primers Ac114F
and Ac596R using four archetypical nahAc type sequences
from various strains of Pseudomonas isolated from soil,
and the phdAc gene sequence from Comamonas testosteroni
GZ39, which was isolated from river sediment [26]. Six
degeneracies had to be included in the primers to accommodate this last sequence [20]. Amplicons generated with
this primer set include the information for an almost
complete Rieske domain and about 40 amino acids into
the catalytic domain of the large subunit of the enzyme,
based on the structure of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase
from P. putida NCIB9816-4 [10]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these primers have been used to
detect ARHD gene fragments from marine environments.
Primers Ac114F and Ac596R have been used to amplify
PAH-dioxygenase genes using environmental samples

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/50

from different terrestrial habitats, including groundwater
[20,27], seep sediments [28] and soil [29-32].
Seven different ARHD gene types were amplified from
intertidal sediment samples using these primers, five of
them (types A to E) representing dioxygenase genes with
no close relatives in the databases. Their deduced amino
acid sequences contain the consensus pattern of bacterial
ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase alpha-subunits: C-x-H-R[GAR]-x(7,8)-[GEKVI]-[NERAQ]-x(4,5)-C-x-[FY]-H
(PROSITE: PS00570, [33], Figure 2B). This consensus
includes the two cysteines and two histidines (Cys81,
Cys101, His83 and His104 in P. putida NCIB9816-4, [10])
that are involved in the coordination of the iron ions in
the Rieske [2Fe-2S] center of many dioxygenases [34] as
well as Arg 84, important for the formation of hydrogen
bonds between subunits [10,35]. Other residues not
included in the consensus but also important for the interaction between subunits are also conserved in all these
novel gene types. These residues include Tyr103, Trp106
[10,35,36] and Val117 [10].
Gene types A to E were only detected at two sampling sites
(OR and EM), located on the coast of Ushuaia city, the
southernmost city of the world with a population of
approximately 45,000 inhabitants. This region has a
humid and temperate-cold climate, average water temperatures of 4.5°C in winter and 9°C in summer, and a tidal
range of less than 1 m [37]. Site OR is situated next to a
fuel wharf and site EM is located 0.3 km west of OR site,
and in close proximity to two piers. GC-MS analysis of the
samples retrieved at these sites indicated the presence of a
variety of PAHs, in particular in the OR06 sample.
Although A-type genes were abundant in the Ac-OR04
library, gene types B to E were detected at very low frequencies. It is then possible that organisms carrying these
alleles are not very abundant in these sediment microbial
communities. These libraries may even overestimate their
actual abundance, as rare target genes can potentially be
enriched due to the rehybridization of the most abundant
PCR products during the amplification [38,39]. On the
other hand, their frequencies could also be underestimated by the primer sequences and the conditions used
for the amplification. Further studies are needed to identify the hosts of these alleles, to reveal the ecological significance of these populations in these sub-Antarctic
sediments and to discover their actual biogeographic distributions.
In four libraries the most abundant clone type was closely
related to phnAc-like genes from A. faecalis AFK2 [GenBank: AB024945] as well as Burkholderia sp. strains Cs1-4,
Ch1-1,
Ch3-5
and
Eh1-1
[GenBank:
AY367784–AY367787]. All these strains have the ability
to degrade phenanthrene [40,41]. They were isolated

from soil and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of the presence of phnAc-like genes (A. faecalis
AFK2) in marine environments. Archetypical nahAc-type
genes were also rather abundant in the sediment libraries,
accounting for more than half of the analyzed ARHD
clones. Their sequences are closely related to nahAc genes
from Pseudomonas strains isolated from heavily polluted
marine sediments of Barcelona, Spain (Figure 4B, [25]).
This allele has also been found in P. putida strains isolated
from
Antarctic
marine
sediments
([GenBank:
AJ496392–AJ496395] Bosch, R., Lalucat, J. and RosselloMora, R., unpublished), indicating that cold adapted
PAH-degrading organisms can host this gene type. Moreover, evidence of horizontal gene transfer of the nahAc
gene has been reported in Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, an extremely halotolerant organism isolated from
marine sediments [42]. Organisms related to Marinobacter
were enriched in long term microcosms prepared from
Arctic sea ice with crude oil [43], suggesting that psychrophilic representatives of this genus are important in
hydrocarbon degradation in cold marine environments. It
is then possible that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria
other than Pseudomonas may carry the nahAc-type genes
detected in coastal sediments of Patagonia.

temperatures [46]. Therefore, it is not surprising to find
these PAH-degrading bacteria in the coastal sediments of
Patagonia. To determine if populations carrying phnA1like genes are the major players during PAH biodegradation in marine sediments, where these compounds tend
to accumulate due to their low water solubility, it is essential to assess their relative abundance and their level of
activity when compared with other indigenous PAHdegrading populations.

Conclusion
This work expands the current knowledge concerning the
diversity of ARHD genes in the marine environment.
Despite using two primer sets designed from a limited
range of targeted PAH-dioxygenase genes, we detected
representatives of eight lines of descent of dioxygenase
genes in coastal sediments of Patagonia. The identification of PAH-degrading microorganisms and the development of molecular tools to rapidly identify changes in
their populations are fundamental to study the ecological
mechanisms governing the intrinsic bioremediation of
these harmful aromatic compounds in coastal environments.

Methods
We also evaluated the presence of pnhA1-like genes from
the Cycloclasticus group in coastal sediments. Only one full
sequence [GenBank: AB102786], and three partial
sequences [GenBank: AF093000, AF092998 and
AF053737] were available in the database as of January of
2004. As these sequences were practically identical, we
designed a primer set specific for this allele using the
phnA1 full-length sequence from Cycloclasticus sp. A5.
Only one sequence has been added to the database since,
the phnA1 gene from Cycloclasticus sp. P1 [GenBank:
DQ501245], with a 98.8% similarity at the nucleotide
level with the sequence from the A5 strain. This sequence
shows differences in critical positions with the newly
developed primer set, and would probably not be amplified in the conditions used in this study. Using this primer
set, we detected phnA1-like genes in most of the analyzed
intertidal sediments from Patagonia. Furthermore, DGGE
analyses of naphthalene and phenanthrene enrichments
using the OR05 sample showed the presence of 16S rRNA
genes with high similarity to Cycloclasticus spirillensus
(98–100%, M. Ferrero, unpublished results). These results
suggest that PAH-degrading Cycloclasticus are present in
coastal sediments of Patagonia. Marine organisms belonging to the genus Cycloclasticus appear to be ubiquitous
even in non-contaminated sediments [44-46]. It has been
suggested that these bacteria play an important role in the
degradation of petroleum PAHs in the marine environment [47,48]. They become abundant in oiled seawater
microcosms incubated at 4°C, suggesting an important
role for these bacteria in PAH-biodegradation even at low

Sediment samples
Surficial sediments (0–3 cm) were sampled using acrylic
cores with an inner diameter of 4.4 cm. Sampling was performed along the low tide line at seven to ten random
points in each sampling location, and the composite samples were placed in sterile glass flasks and stored at 4°C
during transport to the laboratory. Each sediment sample
was mixed thoroughly and stored at -80°C for the preparation of clone libraries, or at -20°C for chemical analysis.
Chemical analyses
The PAH concentrations were determined using gas chromatography – mass spectrometry techniques according to
US EPA 8100 [49] and Dean [50]. Briefly, sediments were
mixed with anhydrous Na2SO4 in dichloromethane and
extracted by sonication for 12 h. Extracts were filtered
across a 0.45 μm fiberglass filter and concentrated with a
rotary evaporator to a final volume of 1 ml. Two μl were
injected into a GC injection port operating in splitless
mode. A Shimadzu gas chromatograph 17A V 1.3 model
with mass spectrometer QP 5050A and an MS Workstation Class 5000 (Shimadzu Corp., 1999) was used. Samples were analyzed using SIM mode for optimal sensitivity
scanning only the quantification ions for each PAH.
Quantification was performed by the external standard
method (Restek, Bellafonte, PA). Spiked sediment
showed recovery of 100 ± 7%.

Extraction of DNA from coastal marine sediments
High purity, high molecular mass DNA was purified in
duplicate from 0.5 to 0.8 g wet weight sediment using the
FastDNA®SPIN kit for soil (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA),
according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications: samples were homogenized three
times for 50 s at approximately 5,000 rpm (speed at high
setting) with 1 min intervals using a mini-beadbeater
Biospec (Bartlesville, OK) and sediment DNA was eluted
in 150 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 prepared in molecular
biology grade distilled water (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The two extractions per sample were combined before further analysis.
Amplification of ARHD genes from sediment DNA
Alpha-subunit ARHD gene fragments were amplified
using two primer sets: Ac114F/Ac596R [20] and Cyc372F
(5' CGATGAGTTGGATAGAGATTCG 3')/Cyc854R (5'
GGTTCTCCAAGGTTCTCTG 3') (this study) that target
phnA1-like genes identified in Cycloclasticus spp. PCR
amplifications were carried out in 25 μl-reactions containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each
primer and 1 U of T-PLUS DNA polymerase (Inbio-Highway, Tandil, Argentina) for all libraries, except for AcMS05 (see below). Template concentration was optimized for each sample, and the DNA concentration showing the most intense amplification product of the
expected size by gel electrophoresis was used to construct
the library (1 to 2 μl of extracted DNA per 25 μl reactions).
PCR reactions were performed on a PTC-100® thermal
cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The programs used
for the amplification were as follows: 5 min at 94°C, 40
cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 43°C (Ac114F/Ac596R) or
50°C (Cyc372F/Cyc854R), and 30 s at 72°C, and a final
elongation step of 15 min at 72°C. In the sample MS05,
the previously described mix produced multiple amplification products ranging from 1.5 kb to 100 bp with the
Ac114F/Ac596R primer set (data not shown). As the
amplification with the AccuPrime™ SuperMix II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) produced only one product of the
expected size, this mix was used to construct the library
Ac-MS05. The PCR program was the same as above except
for the extension step, which was performed at 68°C
according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR runs
included a negative control reaction with no added DNA,
and a positive control with the PAH-dioxygenase gene
from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484 (Ac114F/Ac596R)
or C. pugetii PS-1 ATCC 51542 (Cyc372F/Cyc854R). PCR
products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v)
agarose gels with 0.5× TBE stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide [51].

TA cloning, screening and sequencing of ARHD gene
libraries
For the construction of libraries Ac-SC04, Ac-OR04, AcMS05, Cyc-SC04 and Cyc-OR05, products from a single
PCR reaction were immediately cloned into the pCR®4.0
vector (TA Cloning kit for sequencing, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) without further purification, according to
manufacturer's instructions. In libraries Ac-OR05, AcOR06, Ac-EM06 and Ac-GR06 four PCR amplifications
were combined, and the band of the expected size was
excised from 1.5% agarose gels, purified using a GENECLEAN® III kit (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA) and cloned.
Library clones were screened by RFLP analysis. Amplified
clone inserts were digested with 5 U of the restriction
endonuclease HaeIII (Promega, Madison, WI) or RsaI
(Promega), followed by electrophoresis in 2% (w/v) NuSieve 3:1 agarose gels (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME)
with 0.5× TBE and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide [51].
Clones representative of each RFLP pattern were
sequenced. The inserts were sequenced commercially at
Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) from primer sites located on the
vector.
Analysis of ARHD gene libraries diversity
Diversity and similarity calculations were based only on
ARHD sequences. The sequence information obtained
from each RFLP pattern generated from ARHD gene fragments was used to define gene types or alleles. Indices calculated included: library coverage (C) [52], or the portion
of a clone library of infinite size that was sampled, calculated as C = 1 - yx-1, where y is the number of ARHD gene
types that occurred only once, and x is the number of
clones screened; the Shannon diversity index [53], calculated by use of the equation H = -Σ (ni/N)(log2ni/N),
where ni/N is the proportion of clones belonging to each
ARHD type relative to the total number of clones; the
Simpson's dominance index [54], calculated by use of the
equation D = Σ [ni (ni-1)/N (N-1)] where ni is the number
of clones belonging to each ARHD type and N is the total
number of clones. Shannon and Simpson's indices were
calculated by using PRIMER v5 software [55].

Correlations between variables were analyzed using the
bivariate two-tailed Pearson correlation in SPSS version
11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Phylogenetic analysis
To construct the phylogenetic trees, clone sequences were
clustered into 99% deduced amino acid identity groups,
and only one representative sequence was kept for further
analyses. The number of sequences that this clone represents is depicted between parentheses, next to the clone
name. Deduced amino acid sequences (162 positions)
were aligned with reference ARHD sequences obtained
from the NCBI database using ClustalX 1.81 [56]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining
algorithm in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA 3.1, [57]). To test the inferred phylogeny, a bootstrap test with 1,000 replications was used.
