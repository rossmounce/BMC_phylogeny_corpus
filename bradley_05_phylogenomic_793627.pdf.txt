Abstract
Background: Blocks of duplicated genomic DNA sequence longer than 1000 base pairs are known as low
copy repeats (LCRs). Identified by their sequence similarity, LCRs are abundant in the human genome, and
are interesting because they may represent recent adaptive events, or potential future adaptive
opportunities within the human lineage. Sequence analysis tools are needed, however, to decide whether
these interpretations are likely, whether a particular set of LCRs represents nearly neutral drift creating
junk DNA, or whether the appearance of LCRs reflects assembly error. Here we investigate an LCR family
containing the sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A genes involved in drug metabolism, cancer, hormone regulation,
and neurotransmitter biology as a first step for defining the problems that those tools must manage.
Results: Sequence analysis here identified a fourth sulfotransferase gene, which may be transcriptionally
active, located on human chromosome 16. Four regions of genomic sequence containing the four human
SULT1A paralogs defined a new LCR family. The stem hominoid SULT1A progenitor locus was identified
by comparative genomics involving complete human and rodent genomes, and a draft chimpanzee genome.
SULT1A expansion in hominoid genomes was followed by positive selection acting on specific protein
sites. This episode of adaptive evolution appears to be responsible for the dopamine sulfonation function
of some SULT enzymes. Each of the conclusions that this bioinformatic analysis generated using data that
has uncertain reliability (such as that from the chimpanzee genome sequencing project) has been
confirmed experimentally or by a "finished" chromosome 16 assembly, both of which were published after
the submission of this manuscript.
Conclusion: SULT1A genes expanded from one to four copies in hominoids during intra-chromosomal
LCR duplications, including (apparently) one after the divergence of chimpanzees and humans. Thus, LCRs
may provide a means for amplifying genes (and other genetic elements) that are adaptively useful. Being
located on and among LCRs, however, could make the human SULT1A genes susceptible to further
duplications or deletions resulting in 'genomic diseases' for some individuals. Pharmacogenomic studies of
SULT1Asingle nucleotide polymorphisms, therefore, should also consider examining SULT1A copy
number variability when searching for genotype-phenotype associations. The latest duplication is,
however, only a substantiated hypothesis; an alternative explanation, disfavored by the majority of
evidence, is that the duplication is an artifact of incorrect genome assembly.

Background
Experimental and computational results estimate that 5–
10% of the human genome has recently duplicated [1-4].
These estimates represent the total proportion of lowcopy repeats (LCRs), which are defined as homologous
blocks of sequence from two distinct genomic locations
(non-allelic) >1000 base pairs in length. LCRs, which are
also referred to in the literature as recent segmental duplications, may contain all of the various sequence elements,
such as genes, pseudogenes, and high-copy repeats. A set
of homologous LCRs make up an LCR family. Non-allelic
homologous recombination between members of an LCR
family can cause chromosomal rearrangements with
health-related consequences [5-7]. While data are not yet
available to understand the mechanistic basis of LCR
duplication, mechanisms will emerge through the study
of individual cases [8].
At the same time, the appearance of LCR duplicates may
be an artifact arising from one of a number of problems in
the assembly of a genome of interest. Especially when
classical repetitive sequences are involved, it is conceivable that mistaken assembly of sequencing contigs might
create in a draft sequence of a genome a repeat where
none exists. In the post-genomic world, rules have not yet
become accepted in the community to decide when the
burden of proof favors one interpretation (a true repeat)
over another (an artifact of assembly). Again, these rules
will emerge over time through the study of individual
cases.
Through the assembly of many case studies, more general
features of duplication and evolutionary processes that
retain duplicates should emerge. Although each LCR family originates from one progenitor locus, no universal features explain why the particular current progenitor loci
have been duplicated instead of other genomic regions.
From an evolutionary perspective, duplicated material is
central to creating new function, and to speciation. One
intriguing hypothesis is that genes whose duplication and
recruitment have been useful to meet current Darwinian
challenges find themselves in regions of the chromosome
that favor the generation of LCRs.
Browsing a naturally organized database of biological
sequences, we identified human cytosolic sulfotransferase
(SULT) 1A as a recently expanded gene family with biomedically related functions. SULT1A enzymes conjugate
sulfuryl groups to hydroxyl or amino groups on exogenous substrates (sulfonation), which typically facilitates
elimination of the xenobiotic by the excretory system [9].
Sulfonation, however, also bioactivates certain pro-mutagenic and pro-carcinogenic molecules encountered in the
diet and air, making it of interest to cancer epidemiologists [10,11]. These enzymes also function physiologically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/22

by sulfonating a range of endogenous molecules, such as
steroid and thyroid hormones, neurotransmitters, bile
salts, and cholesterol [9].
Three human SULT1A genes have been reported [12,13].
The human SULT1A1 and 1A2 enzymes are ~98% identical and recognize many different phenolic compounds
such as p-nitrophenol and α-naphthol [14-19]. The
human SULT1A3 enzyme is ~93% identical to SULT1A1
and 1A2, but preferentially recognizes dopamine and
other catecholamines over other phenolic compounds
[19-23]. High resolution crystal structures of SULT1A1
and 1A3 enzymes have been solved [24-26]. Amino acid
differences that contribute to the phenolic and dopamine
substrate preferences of the SULT1A1 and 1A3 enzymes,
respectively, have been localized to the active site [27-30].
Polymorphic alleles of SULT1A1, 1A2, and 1A3 exist in
the human population [31-33]. An allele known as
SULT1A1*2 contains a non-synonymous polymorphism,
displays only ~15% of wild type sulfonation activity in
platelets, and is found in ~30% of individuals in some
populations [31]. Numerous studies comparing SULT1A1
genotypes in cancer versus control cohorts demonstrate
that the low-activity SULT1A1*2 allele is a cancer risk factor [34-36], although other studies have failed to find an
association [12]. Ironically, the protection from carcinogens conferred by the high activity SULT1A1*1 allele is
counterbalanced by risks associated with its activation of
pro-carcinogens. For example, SULT1A enzymes bioactivate the pro-carcinogen 2-amino-α-carboline found in
cooked food, cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust [37]. The
sulfate conjugates of aromatic parent compounds convert
to reactive electrophiles by losing electron-withdrawing
sulfate groups. The resulting electrophilic cations form
mutagenic DNA adducts leading to cancer.
Recently, it has become widely understood that placing a
complex biomolecular system within an evolutionary
model helps generate hypotheses concerning function.
This process has been termed "phylogenomics" [38].
Through our bioinformatic and phylogenomic efforts on
the sulfotransferase 1A system, we detected a previously
unidentified human gene that is very similar to SULT1A3,
transcriptionally active, and not found in the chimpanzee.
In addition, we report that all four human SULT1A genes
are located on LCRs in a region of chromosome 16 replete
with other LCRs. A model of SULT1A gene family expansion in the hominoid lineage (humans and great apes) is
presented, complete with date estimates of three preserved duplication events and identification of the progenitor locus. Positively selected protein sites were
identified that might have been central in adapting the
SULT1A3 and 1A4 enzymes to their role in sulfonating

catecholamines such as dopamine and other structurally
related drugs.

Results and Discussion
Four human SULT1A genes on chromosome 16 LCRs
The human SULT1A1 and 1A2 genes are tandemly
arranged 10 kilobase pairs (kbp) apart in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, while the SULT1A3 gene
is located ~1.7 million base pairs (Mbp) away (Figure 1B
and 1C). In addition to the three known SULT1A genes,
we found a fourth gene, SULT1A4, by searching the
human genome with the BLAST-like alignment tool [39].
SULT1A4 was located midway between the SULT1A1/1A2
gene cluster and the SULT1A3 gene (Figure 1B and 1C).

The SULT1A4 gene resided on 148 kbp of sequence that
was highly identical to 148 kbp of sequence surrounding
the SULT1A3 gene (Figure 1A and Table 1). The high
sequence identity between the SULT1A3 and 1A4
genomic regions suggested that they were part of a low
copy repeat (LCR) family. This suspicion was confirmed
by mining the Recent Segmental Duplication Database of
human LCR families [40]. In addition to the four-member
SULT1A LCR family, the 148 kbp SULT1A3 LCR was
related to 27 other LCRs (Figure 1A and Table 1). Many of
the SULT1A3-related LCRs are members of the previously
identified LCR16a family [41,42]. The SULT1A3-related
LCRs mapping to chromosome 16 collectively amounted
to 1.4 Mbp of sequence – or 1.5% of chromosome 16.
To determine if other genes in the SULT super family were
also recently duplicated during LCR expansions, we
searched the Segmental Duplication Database [4] for
human reference genes located on LCRs. No other complete cytosolic SULT genes were located on LCRs, but 25%
of the SULT2A1 open reading frame (ORF) was located on
an LCR (Table 2).
The steroid sulfatase gene, which encodes an enzyme that
removes sulfate groups from the same biomolecules recognized and sulfonated by SULT enzymes, is frequently
deleted in patients with scaly skin (X-linked icthyosis) due
to nonallelic homologous recombination between LCRs
on chromosome X [43,44]. As demonstrated by the Xlinked icthyosis example, SULT1A copy number or activity in the human population could be modified – with
health-related consequences – by nonallelic homologous
recombination between LCRs on chromosome 16.
SULT1A4: genomic and transcriptional evidence
The sequence of the SULT1A4 gene region from the
human reference genome was so similar to that of the
SULT1A3 region (>99% identity) that the differences were
near those that might arise from sequencing error or
allelic variation. It was conceivable, therefore, that some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/22

combination of sequence error, allelic variation, and/or
faulty genome construction generated the appearance of a
SULT1A4 gene that does not actually exist. We therefore
searched for additional evidence that the SULT1A4 gene
was material.
We asked whether any evidence was consistent with the
hypothesis of an artificial SULT1A4 LCR from erroneous
genome assembly, as opposed to the existence of a true
duplicate region. Here, the quality of the genomic
sequencing is important. The junction regions at the ends
of the SULT1A4 LCR were sufficiently covered; at least
nine sequencing contigs overlapped either junction
boundary (Figure 1C). This amount of evidence has been
used in other studies to judge the genomic placement of
LCRs [45].
As another line of evidence, we compared the nucleotide
sequences of the SULT1A4 and 1A3 genomic regions
(Table 3). Among the 876 coding positions the only difference was at position 105, where SULT1A4 possessed
adenine (A) and SULT1A3 possessed guanine (G). Thus, if
two genes do exist, they differ by one silent transition at
the third position of codon 35. The untranslated regions,
however, contained thirteen nucleotide differences while
the introns contained seven additional differences (Table
3). These 21 differences between the SULT1A4 and 1A3
genomic regions disfavor the hypothesis that sequencing
errors played a role in the correct/incorrect placement of
these LCRs.
The SULT1A4 gene was located near the junction of two
LCRs (Figure 1C). For this reason, it was not clear whether
SULT1A4 had a functional promoter. We took a bioinformatic approach to address this question. Expressed
sequences ascribed to SULT1A3 were downloaded from
the NCBI UniGene website [46]. Each sequence was
aligned to SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 genomic regions.
Based on the A/G polymorphism at the third position of
codon 35, five expressed sequences were assigned to
SULT1A4 and nine to SULT1A3 (Table 4). Other
expressed sequences were unclassified because they did
not overlap codon 35. If the SULT1A4 does exist, there is
ample evidence from expressed sequences to make conclusions about its transcriptional activity.
The codon 35 A/G polymorphism was reported as allelic
variation in SULT1A3 by Thomae et al. [33]. It is conceivable that Thomae et al. sequenced both SULT1A3 and
SULT1A4 because of the identical sequences surrounding
them. In their study, 89% of CAA (1A4) and 11% of CAG
(1A3) codon 35 alleles were detected in one population.
Why were the frequencies not more equal, as would be
expected if SULT1A4 is always CAA and SULT1A3 is CAG?
One hypothesis is that SULT1A3 is indeed CAG/CAA

polymorphic as reported, while SULT1A4 is always CAA.
Interestingly, in both the chimpanzee and gorilla, codon
35 of SULT1A3 is CAA. This implies that the ancestral
SULT1A3 gene (prior to duplication) likely had a CAA
codon. An A to G transition might have been fixed in a

fraction of SULT1A3 genes after the divergence of humans
and great apes. If this scenario is true, some transcripts
assigned to SULT1A4 on the basis of codon 35 may actually be from individuals expressing the ancestral CAA version of SULT1A3.

SULT1A progenitor locus
We aligned the coding sequences of all available SULT1A
genes and used various nucleotide distance metrics and
tree-building algorithms to infer the gene tree without
constraints. The unconstrained topology placed platypus
as the out group, with the placental mammals ordered
(ox,(pig,(dog,(rodents)),(rabbit,(primates)))). This differed from the topology inferred while constraining for
the most likely relationships among mammalian orders
(platypus,((dog,(ox,pig)),
((rabbit,(rodents)),
primates))) [47]. We considered both trees, and found
that the conclusions drawn throughout the paper were
robust with regard to these different topologies. Therefore,
only the tree inferred while constraining for most likely
relationships among mammalian orders is discussed (Figure 2).

Using the transition redundant exchange (TREx) molecular dating tool [48], we placed upper-limit date estimates
at the SULT1A duplication nodes (Figure 2). The SULT1A
gene family appears to have expanded ~32, 25, and 3 million years ago (Ma). Therefore, the SULT1A duplications
likely occurred after the divergence of hominoids and old
world monkeys, with the most recent duplication occurring even after the divergence of humans and great apes.
Mouse, rat, and dog genomes each contained a single
SULT1A gene. The simplest evolutionary model, therefore, predicted that one of the four hominoid SULT1A loci
was orthologous to the rodent SULT1A1 gene. Syntenic
regions have conserved order of genetic elements along a
chromosomal segment and evidence of synteny between
homologous regions is useful for establishing relationships of orthology and paralogy. Human SULT1A1 is
most like rodent Sult1a1 in sequence and function and
before the advent of whole genome sequencing it was
assumed that they were syntenic and therefore orthologous [49]. Complete genome sequences have since
emerged and alignments between them are available in
the visualization tool for alignments (VISTA) database of
human-rodent genome alignments [50,51]. The VISTA
database contains mouse-human pairwise alignments
and mouse-rat-human multiple alignments. The multiple
alignments were found to be more sensitive for predicting
true orthologous regions between rodent and human
genomes [51]. We searched the VISTA database for evidence of any human-rodent syntenic regions involving
the four SULT1A loci. The more sensitive multiple alignments failed to record any human-rodent syntenic regions
involving the SULT1A1, SULT1A2, or SULT1A4 loci but
detected synteny involving the SULT1A3 loci and both
rodent genomes (Figure 3). These results are indicative of
a hominoid specific SULT1A family expansion from a progenitor locus corresponding to the genomic region that
now contains SULT1A3. The results from the VISTA data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/22

base were not as clear when the less sensitive alignment
method was employed (Figure 3).
SULT1A3 and 1A4 LCRs were 99.1% identical overall
(Table 1). More careful inspection revealed that the
SULT1A3 and 1A4 LCRs were 99.8% identical over the
first 120 kbp, but only 98.0% identical over the last 28
kbp (data not shown). This 10-fold difference in percent
identities (0.2% vs. 2.0%) suggested that the SULT1A4containing LCR was produced by two independent duplications. The chimpanzee draft genome assembly aligned
with the human genome [52] provides evidence in support of this hypothesis. There is conserved synteny
between human and chimp genomes over the last 28 kbp
of the 1A4-containing LCR, but no synteny over the first
120 kbp where the SULT1A4 gene is located (data not
shown). This finding and the TREx date estimate for the
SULT1A3/1A4 duplication event at ~3 Ma indicate that
SULT1A4 is a human invention not shared by chimpanzees – our closest living relatives.
It should be noted that the chimpanzee genome assembly
is less reliable than the assembly of the human genome.
The coverage is significantly lower, and the methods used
for assembly are viewed by many as being less reliable, in
part because they relied on the human assembly. Other
possibilities, less supported the available evidence, should
be considered, including deletion of the chimpanzee
SULT1A4 gene since the human-chimp divergence, or failure of the draft chimpanzee genome assembly to detect
the 120 kbp segment on which the SULT1A4 gene resides.
Adaptive evolution in hominoids
From an analysis of gene sequence change over time,
molecular evolutionary theory can generate hypotheses
about whether duplication has led to functional redundancy, or whether the duplicates have adopted separate
functional roles. If the latter, molecular evolutionary theory can suggest how different the functional roles might
be by seeking evidence for positive (adaptive) selection
for mutant forms of the native proteins better able to contribute to fitness.

Positive selection of protein function can best be hypothesized when the ratio of non-synonymous (replacement)
to synonymous (silent) changes normalized to the
number of non-synonymous and synonymous sites
throughout the entire gene sequence (KA/KS) is greater
than unity. Various models of evolutionary sequence
change can be used to calculate these ratios. The simplest
assumes a single KA/KS ratio over the entire tree (oneratio). More complex models assume an independent
ratio for each lineage (free-ratios), variable ratios for specific classes of sequence sites (site-specific), or variable

ratios for specific classes of sequence sites along specified
branches (branch-site specific) [53-57].
Estimating the free parameters in each of these models by
the maximum likelihood method [58] enables testing two
nested evolutionary models as competing hypotheses,
where one model is a special case of another model. The
likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, which is twice the log
likelihood difference between the nested models, is comparable to a χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal
to the difference in free parameters between the models
[59]. Evidence for adaptive evolution typically requires a
KA/KS ratio >1 and a statistically significant LRT [60].
We estimated KA/KS ratios for each branch in the 1A gene
tree by maximum likelihood with the PAML program
[61]. A typical branch in the SULT1A gene tree had a ratio
of 0.16, and the ratio was 0.23 on the branch separating
extant SULT1A3/1A4 genes from the single SULT1A gene
in the last common ancestor of hominoids (Figure 2).
Thus, the KA/KS ratio estimated as an average over all sites
did not suggest adaptive evolution along the 1A3/1A4
branch.

We then implemented three site-specific and two branchsite evolutionary models that allow KA/KS ratios to vary
among sites. Four of the five models estimated that a proportion of sites (2–8%) had KA/KS >1 (Table 5). Each
model was statistically better at the 99 or 95% confidence
level than the appropriate null model as determined using
the LRT statistic (Table 6). Table 6 lists the specific sites
that various analyses identified as being potentially
involved in positive selection and a subset of these sites
that are changing along the SULT1A3/1A4 branch.
A hypothesis of adaptive change that is based on the use
of KA/KSvalues can be strengthened by joining the molecular evolutionary analysis to an analysis based on structural biology [62,63]. Here, we ask whether the sites
possibly involved in an episode of sequence evolution are,
or are not, randomly distributed in the three dimensional
structure. To ask this question, we mapped the sites to the
SULT1A structure (Figure 4). Sites holding amino acids
whose codons had suffered synonymous replacements
were evenly distributed throughout the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, as expected for silent
changes that have no impact on the protein structure and

therefore cannot be selected for or against at the protein
level (Figure 4). In contrast, sites experiencing non-synonymous replacements during the episode following the
duplication that created the new hominoid gene are
clustered on the side of the protein near the substrate
binding site and the channel through which the substrate
gains access to the active site (Figure 4 and Table 7). This
strengthens the hypothesis that replacements at the sites
are indeed adaptive. The approach employed here based
on structural biology does not lend itself easily to evaluation using statistical metrics. Rather, the results are valuable based on the visual impression that they give, and the
hypotheses that they generate.
We then examined literature where amino acids had been
exchanged between SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. One of the
sites, at position 146, identified as being involved in adaptive change, is known to control substrate specificity in
SULT1A1 and 1A3 [27-30]. The remaining sites identified
are nearby.

Conclusion
An interesting question in post-genomic science asks how
to create biological hypotheses from various drafts of
whole genome sequences. In generating these hypotheses,
it is important to remember that a genomic sequence is
itself a hypothesis, about the chemical structure of a small
number of DNA molecules. In many cases, biologists wish
to move from the genomic sequence, as a hypothesis, to
create hypotheses about biological function, without first
"proving" the genome sequence hypothesis.
This type of process, building hypotheses upon unproven
hypotheses, is actually common in science. In fact, very little of what we believe as fact is actually "proven"; formal
proof is virtually unknown in science that involves observation, theory, and experiment. Rather, scientists generally accumulate data until a burden of proof is met, with
the standards for that burden being determined by experience within a culture. In general, scientists have an idea in
an area as to what level of validation is sufficient to avoid

making mistakes an unacceptable fraction of the time,
and proceed to that level in their ongoing work, until they
encounter a situation where they make a mistake
(indicating that a higher standard is needed), or encounter enough examples where a lower standard works, and
therefore come to accept a lower standard routinely [64].
Genomics has not yet accumulated enough examples for
the culture to define the standards for a burden of proof.
In the example discussed here, several lines of reasoning
would be applied to analyze the sulfotransferase gene
family. First, the fact that the draft genome for
chimpanzee contains three paralogs, while the draft
genome for human contains four, would normally be
interpreted (as it is here) as evidence that an additional
duplication occurred in the time since chimpanzee and
humans diverged. It would also, however, be consistent
with the loss of one of four hypothetical genes present in
the common ancestor of chimpanzee and humans in the
lineage leading to chimpanzee. Another possibility is that
the finishing stages of the chimpanzee genome project
will uncover a SULT1A4 gene.

Normally, one would resolve this question using an out
group taxon, a species that diverged from the lineage leading to chimpanzee and human before chimpanzee and
human themselves diverged. The nearest taxa that might
serve as an out group today are, however, rat and mouse.
As noted above, they diverged so long ago (ca. 150 MY
separates contemporary rodents from contemporary primates) that the comparison provides no information. And
no closer out group taxon (e.g., orangutan) has had its
genome completely sequenced.
Here, the two hypotheses (duplication versus loss after the
chimpanzee-human speciation) are distinguished (to
favor post-speciation duplication) based on an analysis of
the silent nucleotide substitutions using the TREx metric.
The very small number of nucleotide differences separating the SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 coding regions favors the
generation of the two paralogs after chimpanzee and
human diverged.
This comparison, however, potentially suffers from the
statistics of small numbers. The number of differences in
the coding region (exactly one) is small. By considering
~10 kbp of non-coding sequence, however, additional differences were found. It is possible that in the assembly of
the human genome, a mistake was made that led to the
generation of a SULT1A4 region that does not actually
exist. In this hypothesis, the ~20 nucleotide differences
between the SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 paralogs must be the
consequence of allelic polymorphism in the only gene
that exists. This is indeed how some of the data were initially interpreted.
Does the preponderance of evidence favor the hypothesis
of a very recent duplication to generate a pair of paralogs
(SULT1A3 and SULT1A4)? Or does the evidence favor the
hypothesis that the SULT1A4 gene is an illusion arising
from gene assembly error coupled to sequencing errors
and/or allelic variation at ca. 20 sites? The culture does not
yet have a standard of assigning the burden of proof here,
although a choice of hypothesis based simply on the
count of the number of mistakes that would need to have
been made to generate each hypothesis (none for the first,
at least three for the second) would favor the former over
the latter. Thus, perhaps naively, the burden of proof now
favors the former, and we may proceed to generate the
biological hypothesis on top of the genomic hypothesis.
Here, the hypothesis has immediate pharmacogenomic
and genomic disease implications due to the specific
functional behaviors of SULT1A enzymes. LCR-mediated
genomic rearrangements could disrupt or amplify human
SULT1A gene copy number. Given our current environmental exposure to many forms of carcinogens and procarcinogens that are either eliminated or activated by

gene would drive its expression in tissues where SULT1A3
is not expressed – a hypothesis testable by more careful
transcriptional profiling.

The majority of evidence indicates that a new transcriptionally active human gene, which we refer to as
SULT1A4, was created when 120 kbp of chromosome 16
duplicated after humans diverged from great apes. Thus,
SULT1A4, or possibly another gene in this region, is likely
to contribute to distinguishing humans from their closest
living relatives. It is also conceivable that an advantage in
gene regulation, as opposed to an advantage from gene
duplication, was the driving force behind the duplication
of this 120 kbp segment. While cause and effect are difficult to separate, the examples presented here support the
hypothesis that genes whose duplication and recruitment
are useful to meet current Darwinian challenges find
themselves located on LCRs.

Multiple SULT1A genes were apparently useful inventions
by our stem hominoid ancestor. Following the duplication of an ancestral primate SULT1A gene ~32 Ma, positive selection acted on a small proportion of sites in one
of the duplicates to create the dopamine sulfonating
SULT1A3 enzyme. In the example presented here, the evidence of adaptive change at certain sites is corroborated
by the ad hoc observation that the sites cluster near the
active site of the protein. The well known substrate binding differences at the active sites of SULT1A1/1A2 and
SULT1A3 (and now SULT1A4) substantiate these
findings.

The SULT1A4 gene is currently the most obvious feature
of the duplicated region and has been preserved for ~3 MY
without significant divergence of its coding sequence. One
suggestion for the usefulness of SULT1A4 is that it
expanded sulfonating enzymes to new tissues. The
SULT1A4 gene is located only 10 kbp upstream from the
junction boundary of its LCR and 700 kbp away from the
SULT1A3 locus. It is possible, therefore, that promoter
elements from the new genomic context of the SULT1A4

When studying well-characterized proteins as we have
done here, episodes of functional change can be identified
by piecing together several lines of evidence. It is not
immediately possible, unfortunately, to assemble as
much evidence for the majority of proteins in the biosphere. Thus, an important goal in bioinformatics is to
recognize the signal of functional change from a restricted
amount of evidence. Of the three lines of evidence
employed here (codon-based metrics, structural biology,
and experimental), structural biology, with its obvious
connections to protein function and impending growth

from structural genomics initiatives, will probably be the
most serviceable source of information for most protein
families. This should be especially true for protein families not amenable to experimental manipulation, or with
deep evolutionary branches where codon-based metrics
are unhelpful. If we are to exploit the incontrovertible link
between structure and function, however, new structural
bioinformatic tools and databases relating protein structure to sequence changes occurring on individual
branches are much needed.
This bioinformatic study makes several clear predictions.
First, a PCR experiment targeted against the variation
between the hypothetical SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 human
genes should establish the existence of the two separate
genes. Second, a reverse transcription-PCR experiment
would be expected to uncover transcriptional activity for
the SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 human genes. Since this
paper was submitted, these experiments have been done,
and indeed confirm our predictions made without the
experimental information [65]. Further, after this manuscript and its computationally-based predictions were
submitted for publication, a largely finished sequence for
chromosome 16 has emerged [66] that confirms our analysis here in every respect.

track. Sequences corresponding to the chromosomal coordinates of the 30 LCRs were then downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser and parsed into separate files.
Each LCR was aligned with the SULT1A3-containing LCR
using MULTIPIPMAKER [73]. The Segmental Duplication
Database [74] was used to examine the duplication status
of each gene in the cytosolic SULT super family.
The bacterial artificial chromosome contigs supporting
each member of the SULT1A LCR family, and the known
genes within each LCR, were inspected with the UCSC
genome browser [75]. The DNA sequences of nine bacterial artificial chromosome contigs supporting the
SULT1A4 genomic region [NCBI Clone Registry: CTC446K24, CTC-529P19, CTC-576G12, CTD-2253D5, CTD2324H19, CTD-2383K24, CTD-2523J12, CTD-3191G16,
RP11-28A6] and seven contigs supporting the SULT1A3
region [NCBI Clone Registry: CTD-2548B1, RP11-69O13,
RP11-164O24, RP11-455F5, RP11-612G2, RP11-787F23,
RP11-828J20] were downloaded from the UCSC genome
browser website.

To determine the extent of homology between the
SULT1A3 and 1A4 genomic locations, ~500 kbp of
sequence surrounding SULT1A3 and ~500 kbp of
sequence surrounding SULT1A4 were downloaded from
NCBI and compared using PIPMAKER [69,70]. Before
submitting to PIPMAKER, high-copy repeats in one of the
sequences were masked with REPEATMASKER [71].

Phylogenetics
The MASTERCATALOG was used for performing initial
inspections of the SULT gene family and for delivering a
non-redundant collection of SULT1A genes. Additional
SULT1A ORFs were extracted from gorilla working draft
contigs [Genbank:AC145177] (SULT1A1 and 1A2) and
[Genbank:AC145040] (SULT1A3) and chimpanzee

[Genbank:AACZ01082721]
(SULT1A1),
[Genbank:AADA01101065] (SULT1A2), and [Genbank:AACZ01241716] (SULT1A3) using PIPMAKER exon
analysis. These new SULT1A genes have been deposited
with the GenBank Third Party Annotation database under
accession numbers [Genbank:BK004887-BK004892].
DNA sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W [76]. The
multiple sequence alignment used in all phylogenetic
analyses is presented as supplementary data [see Additional file 1]. Pairwise distances were estimated under various distance metrics (Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter,
and Tamura-Nei) that account for among-site rate variation using the gamma distribution [77]. Phylogenies were
inferred using both neighbor-joining and minimum evolution tree-building algorithms under the following constraints
((((primates),
rodents),
(artiodactyls,
carnivores)), platypus). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA2 v2.1 [78] and PAUP* v4.0 [79]
software packages.

The Human Recent Segmental Duplication Page [72] was
consulted to identify other LCRs related to the SULT1A3containing LCR. Chromosomal coordinates of 30
SULT1A3-related LCRs were arranged in GFF format and
submitted to the UCSC genome browser as a custom

Parameter estimates of site class proportions, KA/KS ratios,
base frequencies, codon frequencies, branch lengths, and
the transition/transversion bias were determined by the
maximum likelihood method with the PAML v3.14 program [61]. Positively selected sites, posterior probabilities,

Methods
SULT1A LCR family organization in the human genome
The July 2003 human reference genome (based on NCBI
build 34) was queried with the SULT1A3 coding region
using the BLAST-like alignment tool [39], and search
results were visualized in the UCSC genome browser [67].
Two distinct locations on chromosome 16 were identified
as equally probable. One location was recognized by
NCBI Map Viewer [68] as the SULT1A3 locus. The other
locus was dubbed SULT1A4 following conventional naming for this family. The coding sequence and genomic
location of SULT1A4, as well as expressed sequences
derived from SULT1A4, have been deposited with the
GenBank Third Party Annotation database under accession [Genbank:BK004132].

and marginal reconstructions of ancestral sequences were
also determined using PAML. Sites experiencing synonymous changes along the 1A3/1A4 branch were recorded
by hand from an ancestral sequence alignment.
Molecular dating
Starting with aligned DNA sequences, the number (n) of
two-fold redundant codons (Lys, Glu, Gln, Cys, Asp, Phe,
His, Asn, Tyr) where the amino acid had been conserved
in pairs of aligned sequences, and the number of these
codons where the third position was identically conserved
(c) were counted by the DARWIN bioinformatics platform
[80,81]. The pairwise matrix of n and c values for all
SULT1A genes is presented as supplementary data [see
Additional file 2]. The c/n quotient equals the fraction of
identities (f2) in this system, or the transition redundant
exchange (TREx) value [48]. TREx values were converted
to TREx distances (kt values) by the following equation: kt
= - ln [(f2 - Eq.) / (1 - Eq.)], where k is the rate constant of
nucleotide substitution, t is the time separating the two
sequences, and Eq. is the equilibrium state of the TREx
value [48]. The equilibrium state of the TREx value was
estimated as 0.54 for primates, and the rate constant at
two-fold redundant sites where the amino acid was conserved (k) was estimated as 3.0 × 10 -9 changes/site/year
for placental mammals (T. Li, D. Caraco, E. Gaucher, D.
Liberles, M. Thomson, and S.A.B., unpublished data).
These estimates were determined by sampling all pairs of
mouse:rat and mouse:human orthologs in the public
databases and following accepted placental mammal phylogenies and divergence times [82,83]. Therefore, the date
estimates reported are based on the contentious assumptions that (i) rates are constant at the third position of
two-fold redundant codons across the genome, (ii) the
fossil calibration points are correct, and (iii) the mammalian phylogeny used is correct. Branch lengths were
obtained for the constrained tree topology from the pairwise matrix of TREx distances using PAUP* v4.0. Upperlimit date estimates for nodes corresponding to SULT1A
duplication events were obtained by summing the longest
path of branches leading to a node and dividing that value
by k.
Comparative genomics
Human-chimpanzee genome alignments were inspected
at the UCSC Genome Browser. Human-rodent genome
alignments were examined with the VISTA Genome
Browser [50,51,84]. VISTA default parameters were used
for drawing curves. Alignments constructed using both
the pairwise method (LAGAN) and the multiple alignment method (MLAGAN) between the human genome
builds frozen on April 2003 or July 2003 and both rodent
genomes were inspected.

Transcriptional profiling
All expressed sequences ascribed to SULT1A3 were downloaded from NCBI UniGene [85] and aligned with
SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 genomic regions using PIPMAKER. Alignments were inspected for the polymorphism in codon 35, as well as any other potential patterns,
to determine whether they were derived from SULT1A3 or
SULT1A4.
