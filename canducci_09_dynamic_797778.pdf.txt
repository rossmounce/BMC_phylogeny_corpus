Abstract
The characteristics of intra-host human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env evolution were
evaluated in untreated HIV-1-infected subjects with different patterns of disease progression,
including 2 normal progressor [NP], and 5 Long term non-progressor [LTNP] patients. Highresolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was
performed in sequential samples collected over a 3–5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA
sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the
evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon
mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016),
thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood
(ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect
positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive
selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs
showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition,
localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal
antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade
3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on
the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies
for the immune control of HIV-1 infection.

Background
Virus-host relationships in human immunodeficiency
type 1 virus (HIV-1) infection are characterized by a great
complexity. The virus is strictly dependent on the host cell
for replication, but it is constantly exposed to the immune
response of the infected host. Although the innate and
adaptive immune responses restrict HIV-1 replication
after primary infection [1-3], efficient control of virus replication and consequent stable levels of CD4+ T-cells are
observed only in a minority of patients designated longterm non progressors (LTNPs). In LTNPs virus replication
is limited, suggesting that HIV-1 variants are less fit than
those detectable in normal or rapid progressors in this
subgroup of infected persons [4]-. Since in the absence of
anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the HIV-1 replication capacity (RC) is largely related to the efficiency of viral entry
[5,6]-, the selective pressure exerted either by CTL or neutralizing antibodies can account for particular evolutionary patterns in the env gene in LTNPs [7-10].
HIV-1 evades the immune response of the host using different mechanisms, including steric occlusion, conformational masking of critical parts of the protein, and
insertions or deletions in variable loops [2,11]. Additionally, the vast majority of antibodies directed against the
viral envelope recognize non-neutralizing epitopes of the
glycoprotein monomers, thus probably being ineffectual
against the trimeric functional complex [6,12]. Furthermore, a shifting "glycan shield" has been shown to protect
the virus from neutralization by monoclonal antibodies
[13-16]. Finally, many envelope surface elements are
believed to serve as a decoy for the host immune system,
being largely tolerant to variation with no effect on virus
RC [17]. However, conserved env regions have been
described and they are generally associated with functional properties, including virus binding to receptors and
co-receptors. In particular, the CD4 binding-site (CD4bs)
is believed to be a highly conserved region exposed to the
solvent for ligand binding [18]-. In LTNPs, control of virus
replication seems to correlate with the presence of antibodies against this critical domain, and sera from these
patients show broad cross-neutralizing responses against
primary HIV-1 isolates, mainly due to antibodies against
this epitope [19-22].
In the past few years, a growing body of studies has investigated the HIV-1 env gene evolution in order to evaluate
its role during the natural course of infection [19,23-27],
and to identify the crucial characteristics of active and passive immunization strategies [15,18,20,28-30]-. Positively
selected sites have frequently been observed within the
C2-V5 region of the viral surface glycoprotein in samples
from recently and chronically infected patients
[1,9,10,23,24,26,27,31,32]. In the present study, a highresolution phylogenetic analysis of partial env gene nucle-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/4

otide sequences (C2-C5 region) was performed using
samples collected over a period of 3–5 years from 7 HIV1 infected, untreated, asymptomatic patients with different patterns of disease progression. The aim of this study
was to identify conformational epitopes and sites of the
viral protein surface with specific patterns of virus evolution in LTNPs.

Results
HIV-1 evolutionary rate in normal progressors and in longterm non progressor patients
Virus evolutionary rate (substitutions/site/year) within
each patient was estimated separately for the first + second
(μ1st+2nd) and third codon position (μ3rd) separately (Figure 1). The average viral mutation rate among all patients
was estimated to be around 2.34E-02 mutations/site/year.
In patients A, B (normal progressors; NP), the average
mutation rate (μ) was significantly higher at the third
position compared to that of the first and second positions (μ3rd compared to μ1st+2nd). In all LTNPs, the third
codon mutation rate was estimated to be lower or almost
equal to that inferred for the other codon positions (μ3rd
compared to μ1st+2nd). This difference was found to be statistically significant when LTNP and NP results were compared with the Student t-Test (p = 0,016).
Maximum likelihood analysis of positive selection on non
recombinant data sets
We compared the fit of two sets of nested site-specific
models to the data (including a neutral model that is
restricted to purifying selection and an alternative model
that also allows for positive selection): Model 1a vs.
Model 2a and Model 7 vs. Model 8. To assess whether
allowing codons to evolve under positive selection gives a
significantly better fit to the data, the log likelihood values
obtained for each pair of nested models were compared
using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) (Additional file 1).
In all cases Model 2a and Model 8 were significantly
favoured over Model 2a and Model 7 respectively (P <
0.001), and the empirical Bayes approach identified several positively selected sites.

Site specific dN/dS values for each patient and the entropy
value for each position along the sequence were calculated (data not shown). Subsequently, a color-grade 3dimensional visualization of the dN/dS score (the posterior mean value derived from the Empirical Bayes
approach using Model M8) was generated (Figure 2 and
3). Using Model 8, the following numbers of sites with a
dN/dS ratio higher than 1 were observed: patient A: 24;
patient B: 33, patient C: 53; patient D: 45; patient E: 45;
patient F: 81 patient G: 52. The following number of sites
with dN/dS > 2 were observed: patient A: 15; patient B: 23,
patient C: 27; patient D: 36; patient E: 33; patient F: 56
patient G: 34. The following numbers of sites with a dN/

patient B: 0, patient C: 19; patient D: 25; patient E: 23;
patient F: 42; patient G: 17.
The following number of sites with a posterior probability
of being under positive selection > 95% and > 99%,
respectively, were identified: patient A: 6 and 4; patient B:
7 and 1; patient C: 8 and 3; patient D: 10 and 7; patient E:
9 and 5; patient F: 23 and 11; patient G: 8 and 2. Selective
constraints appear to act along all the proteic sequence in
all patients. In all patients, positively selected sites
appeared to be unevenly distributed. In particular the
majority of sites were located in C3 and in V4, where
many N-linked glycosylation sites are known to be
present and used to protect from antibody mediated neutralization [30].
To examine the molecular footprint of deleterious mutational load on within-host evolution, and its putative
impact on the identification on positively selected sites,
we tested for differences in selective pressure among internal and external branches in each patient. dN/dS estimates were almost always higher on external branches
compared to internal branches, but only for three patients
this was statistically supported by the LRT model comparison (see Additional file 2). When the internal-external
differences were tested on the data combined for all
patients, however, a higher dN/dS on external branches

(0.46 for internal vs 0.78 for external) was strongly supported by the LRT (< 0.001). This analysis confirms that
external branches are subject to deleterious load, which
might result in an elevated dN/dS ratio for these branches
[33]. When we inferred the sites under selection only for
the internal branches using the Fixed Effects Likelihood
(FEL), several of the sites identified using the previous
models were confirmed to be under positive selection
(Figure 4).
For the 5 patients for which the HLA typing was obtained
(see below), the majority of positively selected sites were
localized outside the known HLA class I linear epitopes
except for patients B, C, and E, where residues immediately next to or belonging to an HLA-A11 epitope were
identified (position 339 to 350). In particular, in patient
B and E residues 344Q (that is also exposed on the surface) and 346A and position 339N in patient C was
inferred to be under positive selection.
3-dimesional analysis of the dN/dS score
A 3-dimensional visualization of the posterior mean dN/
dS value was generated using a color grade scale. Both on
the CD4 binding site and on the outer domain of the molecule the majority of sites appeared as under purifying
selection (Figures 2, 3 and 5, light blue areas), especially
in patients C, D, and E. In many cases, amino acids that
were identified as under positive selection along the

in the C3 region that is exposed on the surface was identified and formed by Lys362, Glu363, Ser364 and Ser365.
Another wide site of positive selection appeared to be
formed by Glu269, Asn289, Ser291, Lys337, Gln340,
Lys343, Gln344, and located on the outer surface. In
patient G, the exposed surface harboured only two residues under positive selection: Ile371 and Gly471, which
cluster together on the 3-D structure.
All patients had positively selected sites in the V3 region,
specifically patient F (5 sites with a dN/dS > 1 located both
on the tip and at its base). In all patients, no sites were
identified among known CD4 induced epitopes.

are coloured white, green and cyan respectively. The amino
acid residues are shown as sticks. Of note, the binding region
of the broadly neutralizing antibody overlaps the positively
selected sites in the patient G derived structure.

Analysis of the CD4 binding site
Positively selected sites were identified in the CD4 binding region in patients C, D, E and F, but not in patients A
and B, where almost all positively selected sites were
located on the outer surface or on the α-helix in the C3
region. In all patients except patient B, Thr283, located in
the CD4 binding region (though not directly in contact
with it), was inferred to be under positive selection. In
patients C and D, distinct sites were under positive selection in this area. Arg476 in patient C, and Thr283 and
Asp368 in patient D, were under positive selection and
potentially involved in direct receptor binding. A more
clearly delimited constraint seems to act on patients E, F
and G. In particular, a conformational epitope appeared
to be present in patient E and G and formed by Thr278,
Asp279 and Ala 281. In patient F, a complex and large
area located partially within the CD4 binding site and in
a usually highly conserved region immediately next to it
was observed to be under positive selection. This region
includes Ala281, Trp427, Glu460, Ser461, Glu462 and
Leu452 and Leu453. When the IgGb12 heavy chain CDRs
structures were superimposed on patient G-derived gp120
3-dimentional visualization, a high number of positively
selected sites identified in this patient coincided with residues recognized by this broad neutralizing antibody on
the gp120 surface [34].

gp120 linear sequence, defined clusters on the surface,
suggesting their role in conformational epitopes presented on exposed antigenic areas. In all patients a high
level of variation was observed in the C3 region, where an
α-helix (position 335 to 350) is located and exposed on
one side to the solvent and can be recognized by humoral
immune defences. On the outer domain of gp120, many
clusters were identified in all patients, but with a different
distribution. A conformational epitope was identified in

Identification of rare mutations
When the amino acid entropy of positively selected sites
was studied, the majority of substitutions observed for all
patients were between residues present in that same position with a high frequency in the 500 database sequence
alignment. Nevertheless, in some patients, rare substitutions seem to have been selected, including E269D,
N339H, N339D, N340D, N340K, T341A, N343Q,
N343E, A346F, A346Y, T394A, T394I, R476K, R476M.
Amino acid frequencies in those positions in the 500
sequence database alignment and how these sites evolved
during the observation period are shown in Table 1.

HLA typing
A low- or high-resolution HLA typing was also performed
for patient A to E. HLA typing was not possible for patients
F and G. Results of HLA typing are shown in Additional
file 3.

Discussion
In the present study, a high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein evolution was
performed in HIV-1 infected patients with a different pattern of disease progression. All patients under study had
never been treated for HIV-1 infection, leaving the host
immune system as the only selective force acting on virus
evolution and quasispecies selection. Firstly, an analysis
was performed to identify putative recombinants. Recombination may occur frequently in vivo in HIV-1 evolution,
and artificial chimeric sequences due to PCR crossovers
can significantly affect phylogenetic analysis. The PHI test
based on the refined incompatibility score was used to
overcome this bias with our data set [35]. When recombinant sequences were excluded (about 15%, see materials and methods) from the analysis, the number of sites
with a dN/dS value > 1 was reduced in some of the
patients. Nevertheless, the number of positively selected
sites identified with a Bayesian posterior probability >
0.95 in our datasets was not significantly affected. The
best fitting model of evolution was chosen in the phylogenetic reconstruction, and maximum likelihood methods
were used to fit codon models of evolution for all
patients, to identify positively selected sites, and Bayesian
inference was used to estimate virus evolutionary rates. In
addition, an HLA typing and a color-grade 3-dimensional
visualization of the dN/dS score were used.
Finally, since external branches are subject to substitutions as well as mutational load, which involves random
mutations and therefore potentially many nonsynonymous substitutions, we inferred the sites under selection
for the internal branches only, using the Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) approach [36]. This analysis infers dN and
dS for each site and also tests whether dN = dS or not for
the sites [36]. All the sites identified with the FEL
approach were also identified with the previous methods,
further confirming the possibility of identifying sites
showing diversifying selection when sequential time
points are considered even using cloned sequences. A
multiple-step analysis was in fact necessary in the present
study to address correctly the evolution of a large portion
of the HIV-1 env gene, since a high background is expected
when the dN/dS score/site is performed in highly variable
viral populations under continuous positive selection. In
these cases, only sites with high dN/dS ratio and confirmed by Bayesian posterior probability should be taken
into
consideration
[32,37,38]-.

In order to highlight the effect of positive selection on
virus evolution, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the three codon positions. In the third codon
position, mutations are silent in about 70% of all possibly
occurring nucleotide changes, and if no selective constraints act on the virus, evolution occurs at a faster rate
compared to the first and second codon positions. In all
LTNPs, the third codon mutation rate is equal to or lower
than that compared to the averaged 1st and 2nd position (p
= 0.016), thus being compatible with positive selection
[39-41].
The impact of HLA-associated selection pressure on viral
evolution has recently been demonstrated at the population level [42-50]. No HLA B57 associated positively
selected sites were identified in our patients, but a potential HLA A11 associated epitope was present in patients B,
C, and E. Within this epitope, the position 346 exhibited
a high dN/dS ratio in all three patients.
Although positive selection was evident in the replicating
virus from all subjects, differences were observed between
NPs and LTNPs. In subjects A and B (NPs) selective constraints are less intense, in terms of dN/dS score calculated
even for the highly selected hotspots (Figure 2 and 3), and
are limited to the external surface of the crystal and to the
α-helix in the C3 region. These sites and the V3 loop
appear to be targets for the immune response in all
patients, with a single exception (patient A). This observation is apparently in contrast with the results obtained by
other studies, where the C3 alpha helix was observed to be
under positive selection for clade C envelopes and only
modestly for clade B [27,51]. Although we cannot exclude
that differences in the intensity of the immune response
against different HIV-1 subtypes exist at these levels, the
previous analyses were based on cross-sectional C-clade
and B-clade sequence datasets downloaded from HIV-1
databases, thus not reflecting the intra-patient evolutionary dynamics and the heterogeneity of host immune
responses during the different phases of HIV-1 infection
(or the different patterns of disease progression observed).
Other studies analyzed the sequence evolution in infected
individuals and showed that the C3 region, including the
externally accessible residues, is under strong positive
selection both in clade B [24-26] and in HIV-1 subtype C
infections [23]. These results may be of particular interest
since this antigenic portion of the gp120 molecule has
been considered in the development of candidate vaccines
[52-56]-.
Many N-linked glycosylation sites were identified to be
under positive selection and exposed on the surface in the
group of LTNPs and in the 2 NP subjects. In particular
N442, R444 and S446, N295, N332, N340, N339 were
identified as being potentially involved in the glycan

shield that protects the virus against host defences [57].
Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the neutralizing activity of a human monoclonal antibody, designated
as mAb 2G12, is associated with the presence of glycosylation sites at these positions, including 295, 332 and 339
[58-60]. IgG 2G12-like antibodies have previously been
detected in LTNP patients by competitive ELISA experiments with high levels in sera associated with the broad
neutralizing activity [19]. This observation is in perfect
agreement with our data, suggesting that antibodies that
bind close to the 2G12 binding site exist in some patients
and exert selective pressure on the viral surface.
It has recently been observed that cross-neutralizing activity characterizing a small subset of LTNPs is associated
with antibodies recognizing the CD4bs [22]. However,
only a few broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies have been isolated at present; among them, only
the IgGb12 (directed against the CD-4bs) and mAb 2G12
(recognizing oligomannose residues) target the gp120
[58,61,62]. Notably, 4 out of the 5 LTNP patients exhibit
strong selective constraints at the level of the CD4bs. In
patient F in particular, an IgGb12 epitope-like area is
under strong positive selection (Figure 5). These data document that this epitope can be modified in vivo in
response to specific selective pressure. Further analyses are
necessary to clarify if mutations in this region may alter
the viral RC, thus being able to delay disease progression.

Conclusion
The present study describes the dynamic evolution of the
HIV-1 env gene in a subset of LTNP subjects and documents that the CD4bs is under strong selective pressure in
the replicating virus of a group of LTNPs and evolves during the course of the disease. These data may be of interest
not only for the understanding of the complex HIV-1-host
relationships, but also for planning new immune-based
strategies against HIV-1 infection.

Methods
Patients and sequences
Seven HIV-positive patients, never treated for HIV infection, were selected on the basis of the slope of their CD4+T-cell counts and the level of HIV-1 viremia (Table 2).
Two of them (subjects A and B) were showing a typical
progression of HIV infection (TP), with a gradual decline
of CD4+ T cells over time (loss of circulating CD4+ T cells
per year: subject A, 87; and subject B, 153). The patients
designated C, D, E, F, and G were LTNPs with CD4+-T-cell
constantly higher than 500 per ml. They were showing the
following mean variation/year of circulating CD4+lymphocytes: -31, -24, -2, -10, and +12 respectively). Lengths
of infection and sampling dates are shown in Table 2.

Plasma specimens were concentrated by centrifugation at
23,600 × g for 1 h at 4°C and RNA was extracted by using
a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The
following outer primers were used in the nested PCR
amplification reaction: V31 (nucleotides 6939 to 6966 in
the pNL4-3 numbering system) and V52 (nucleotides
7803 to 7778). The internal primers were: V32 (nucleotides 7367 to 7340), and V41 (nucleotides 7304 to
7326). The reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA present in
plasma was performed with primer V52 (25 pmol) and
200 U of SuperScript II RNase H-RT (Bethesda Research
Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.) at 37°C for 60 min in a
final volume of 20 μl in the presence of 3.0 mM MgCl2, 75
mM KCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5
mM concentrations of each deoxynucleosidetriphosphate
(dNTP), and 20 U of recombinant RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.). An amount of cDNA
equivalent to 50–1000 copies of template (as evaluated by
HIV-1 RNA copies/ml) was used for PCR amplification.
An Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostic
Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) in 1× Expand PCR buffer
containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 0.2 μM of V31 and V52 primers
was used for the first round. The following cycling conditions were applied: 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 4 min, with
a final extension of 68°C for 10 min. Second-round PCR
was performed using 2 μl of the first-round PCR product
and primers V32 and V41 under the same conditions used
for the first-round PCR.
Only one sample at a time was processed, and clinical
samples were amplified in triplicate. Before molecular
cloning, a 10-μl aliquot of the amplified product was run
on a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to screen for
the appropriate-sized band (ca. 865 bp); the remaining 90
μl was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% low-meltingpoint agarose gel (SeaPlaque; FMC BioProducts, Rockland, Maine) in TAE buffer (Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA).
The DNA fragment was excised from the gel, purified by
the QIAquick DNA Clean-Up system (Qiagen GmbH,
Hiden, Germany) and cloned into pGEM-T vector
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After PCR colony screening, 8 to 20 positive clones were
selected and the insert was sequenced with primers V31
and V52 on an automatic sequencer (ABI Prism 3100,
Appliedbiosystems, Foster City, CA).
For patient A, 15 clones per time point were studied; for
patient B 16,15 and 10 clones respectively; for patient C,
13, 15, and 24 clones; for patient D, 15,12 and 13; for
patient E, 12, 8, and 14 clones, for patient F, 13, 19, and
14 clones; and for patient G, 19, 15, and 9 clones.

Because some analyses could potentially be affected by
recombinats, we tested for recombination using the PHI
test implemented in the SplitsTree package version 4.8.
Significance of the PHI statistic for the presence of recombination is assessed with the normal approximation of a
permutation test where, under the null hypothesis of no
recombination, sites along the alignment are randomly
permuted to obtain the null distribution of PHI: p < 0.05
indicate significant presence of recombination. About
15% of sequences for each time point/patient were discarded after this analysis.

GenBank accession numbers of sequences are EU329847
– EU330175.
High resolution phylogenetic analysis & graphical 3dimensional visualization
Overall, 278 non recombinant genomic-HIV-1 RNA
sequences were aligned collectively and individually for
each patient, using amino acidic sequences as template for
nucleotide alignment by using DAMBE http://

bioedit.html. A Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was reconstructed using the best fitting evolutionary model as evaluated with MODELTEST v3.6 (Posada, D., and K.A.
Crandall, 2001) was generated.
To obtain a maximum-likelihood tree topology, a local
rearrangement search with the maximum-likelihood
method was conducted by starting from the topology of
the NJ tree, as implemented in PAUP* http://
paup.csit.fsu.edu. The ratio of transitions to transversions,
and the gamma distribution of rate variation among sites
were estimated from the data. To evaluate if intra-patient
virus evolution showed patterns of positive selection, a
ML method was applied by using CODEML implemented
in the PAML package http://apt.bea.ki.se/packages.html
and the substitution rate at individual codon position was
also estimated for each patient using the TipDate model as
implemented in BEAST http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Beast.
The CODEML program fits various models of codon evolution to sequence data related by a phylogenetic tree,
which allow to test for varying selection pressures at individual codon sites. The models of codon evolution differ
in their distribution of dN/dS values among codons. Two
couples of nested models were employed: M1a vs M2a
and M7 vs M8. M1a (neutral/purifying model) allows
only two categories of dN/dS across codons and the dN/
dS ratio is constrained to be > 0 and < 1 in one category
and equal to 1 in the other. Hence, M1a only accommodates neutral evolution. M2a adds an extra class of codons
to account for positive selection (i.e., a class of codons
with dN/dS > 1). M7 (neutral model) assumes a beta distribution of dN/dS between 0 and 1 with 10 categories to
discretize the distribution. M8 adds an extra class of
codons with dN/dS > 1 [63]. The likelihoods of the models were than compared using the likelihood ratio test. To
allow further definition of HIV-1 env positively selected
sites within each patient, all the RNA-sequences amplified
and cloned from the same subject, were analysed by using
an empirical Bayes approach [64]. The posterior mean
dN/dS value per site was calculated and a Bayesian
approach was used to identify codons undergoing positive
selection with a posterior probability of > 95% or > 99%,
using CODEML. To better identify conformational
epitopes and sites on the protein surface with possibly distinct roles on disease progression, and distinct patterns of
virus evolution driven by host-selective constraints along
the C2-V5 region, a graphic colour-grade 3-dimensional
visualization the dN/dS score (ratio between non-synonymous/synonymous mutations per site) was generated
using PyMol http://www.pymol.sourceforge.net and the
structure of a V3-containing gp120 core [65].

impact on identifying positively selected sites, we performed a ML analysis of varying selection pressures
among lineages. In this analysis, we compared model M0
(all branches have the same dN/dS) with an alternative
model that allows a different dN/dS for internal and external branches.
Sites under selection along internal branches of reconstructed phylogenetic trees, were inferred using the Fixed
Effects Likelihood (FEL) approach implemented in HyPhy http://www.hyphy.org.
To evaluate the HIV-1 general site-specific inter-exchangeability (site-specific aminoacidic entropy) a collection of
500 aligned env sequences from the Stanford Database
was downloaded and analysed with BioEdit accessory
applications. When positional homology was not maintained due to the high genetic variability, that site in the
alignment was not considered in the analyses.
