Abstract
Background: The Salangid icefish Neosalanx taihuensis (Salangidae) is an economically important fish,
which is endemic to China, restricted to large freshwater systems (e.g. lakes, large rivers and estuaries)
and typically exhibit low vagility. The continuous distribution ranges from the temperate region of the Huai
and Yellow River basins to the subtropical region of the Pearl River basin. This wide ranging distribution
makes the species an ideal model for the study of palaeoclimatic effects on population genetic structure
and phylogeography. Here, we aim to analyze population genetic differentiation within and between river
basins and demographic history in order to understand how this species responded to severe climatic
oscillations, decline of the sea levels during the Pleistocene ice ages and tectonic activity.
Results: We obtained the complete mtDNA cytochrome b sequences (1141 bp) of 354 individuals from
13 populations in the Pearl River, the Yangze River and the Huai River basin. Thirty-six haplotypes were
detected. Haplotype frequency distributions were strongly skewed, with most haplotypes (n = 24)
represented only in single samples each and thus restricted to a single population. The most common
haplotype (H36) was found in 49.15% of all individuals. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed
a random pattern in the distribution of genetic diversity, which is inconsistent with contemporary
hydrological structure. Significant levels of genetic subdivision were detected among populations within
basins rather than between the three basins. Demographic analysis revealed that the population size in the
Pearl River basin has remained relatively constant whereas the populations in the Yangze River and the
Huai River basins expanded about 221 and 190 kyr ago, respectively, with the majority of mutations
occurring after the last glacial maximum (LGM).
Conclusion: The observed complex genetic pattern of N. taihuensis is coherent with a scenario of multiple
unrelated founding events by long-distance colonization and dispersal combined with contiguous
population expansion and locally restricted gene flow. We also found that this species was likely severely
impacted by past glaciations. More favourable climate and the formation of large suitable habitations
together facilitated population expansion after the late Quaternary (especially the LGM). We proposed
that all populations should be managed and conserved separately, especially for habitat protection.

Background
Population genetic structure is dependent on the interaction of the biology of a species and the environment in
which it resides. Marine organisms generally show low
levels of genetic differentiation over large geographic distances [1,2]. In open marine systems it is evident that
higher dispersal potential during planktonic egg, larval, or
adult stages coupled with the absence of physical barriers
to movement seems to greatly facilitate extensive gene
flow among populations of organisms [3,4]. However,
populations of freshwater fish species from different
basins often show significant genetic differentiation
resulting from isolation, while populations within a basin
often show no or low levels of genetic differentiation [59]. There is evidence that for some species instream barriers can restrict gene flow and induce high levels of genetic
differentiation between populations [10,11]. Even in the
absence of restricted gene flow, multiple unrelated founding events could also shape the same pattern of population genetic structure [4].
Due to periodic climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene, range contractions, range expansions and changes
in interconnectivity within and between drainages during
the periodic climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene have
greatly influenced the distribution of many fish species,
have significantly altered the amount and distribution of
intraspecific genetic variation in many species and have
remodelled the population structures of temperate fish
faunas [1,5]. The major climatic oscillations occurred during the past 800 kyr (with a 100 kyr dominant cycle), and
the last glacial maximum (LGM) occurred about 18 kyr
ago with a decline of the sea levels of about 120–140 m
[12]. Each of the severe climatic shifts and the change in
the sea levels could have produced great changes in the
freshwater fish species' geographical distribution and
abundance [1,5,13,14]. The legacy of these changes in the
phylogeographic distribution of genetic diversity has been
traced in several species [5,15,16]. In Cyprinids, it has
been shown that glacial, interglacial and postglacial oscillations have resulted in major changes of distributions
and have shaped current distributions by changes of river
courses and river confluences in response to falling sea
levels [13,14].
The Family Salangidae, which is classified as Protacanthopterygii, Order Osmeriformes, Suborder Osmeroidei
[17,18], comprises six genera and approximately 17 species [19,20]. The Salangid, Neosalanx taihuensis, is one of
the most economically important species in this Family.
This species is endemic to China and is restricted to large
bodied freshwater systems such as inland lakes, out-flowing rivers and estuaries, covering a continuous distribution from the temperate (Yellow River basin) to the
subtropical zone (Pearl River basin) [21]. Also, this spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/201

cies exhibits annualism poor swimming ability and has
some neotenic features such as transparent miniaturized
bodies, cartilaginous endoskeletons, and notochords
[20,22]. The combination of relative large spatial distribution encompassing discrete drainages in tropical and subtropical regions and the low vagility constitutes a good
model system to study the palaeoclimatic effects on population genetic structure and phylogeography of freshwater [23]. In recent years, because of water pollution,
overfishing and habitat destruction, the population of N.
taihuensis has undergone the lost of appropriate habitat
and the decrease in population size [24,25]. In order to
protect the resource of N. taihuensis, the habitat detection
has to be implemented immediately, and the study on the
N. taihuensis population structure and its phylogeoraphic
pattern should be enhanced since the failure to detect
population units will lead to local overfishing and ultimately to severe declines [26]. The Salangidae family has
been studied for more than 200 years, but most of studies
have focused on taxonomy [27,28], biology [29], and
molecular phylogeny [30]. Previous studies in China have
shown that in two unrelated species,Opsariichthys bidens
(Teleostei, Cyprinidae) and Brachymystax lenok Pallas (Salmoninae, Salmonidae), both had genetic patterns coinciding with contemporary drainage structure [8,9], but the
related study on N. taihuensis is not conducted till now.
The basins of Yangtze River, Huai River and Pearl River, in
which N. taihuensis mainly distributes, are important river
systems in China. Although a strong uplifting of the
Tibetan plateau occurred during the Pleistocene in southwest China [31], there is no evidence to indicate that
large-scale river rearrangement occurred after the Pliocene
in the mid-lower reaches of these basins [32]. The Yangze
River and the Huai River basin are connected by the
Peking Hangzhou Canal, while there are no connection
between Pearl River basin and the others[33]. Given the
intolerance of the N. taihuensis to waters with some salt
content, members of freshwater fish division cannot disperse by river connections [34]. Therefore, we expect vicariance among basins might play an important role in
shaping population genetic structure of N. taihuensis. In
addition, the glaciations during the Pleistocene, especially
the last glacial maximum (LGM) with sea levels lowered
(120–140 m below present sea level), should have
severely affected the genetic structure of this species. In
order to detect the population structure and phylogeographic pattern of N. taihuensis at large geographical
scales, samples of N. taihuensis were collected from 13
populations among the Pearl River basin, the Yangtze
River basin, and the Huai River basin (Figure. 1). The
complete mtDNA cytochrome b gene (cyt b) sequence was
used to analyze population genetic differentiation of this
species, population dynamics and demographic history,
and to show how the glaciations influenced the phyloge-

Results
Sequence Variation and Genetic Diversity
For 1141 bp of the complete cyt b gene analyzed in 354
individuals, there were 38 variable nucleotide sites, and
no insertions or deletions in any of the sequences. The
average nucleotide composition for all individuals was
highest for C (0.334), followed by T (0.277), A (0.214),
and G (0.175). Nucleotide composition showed an antiG bias (G = 17.5%), which is characteristic for the mitochondrial genome [35]. Since there were no stop codons
when the cytb sequence was translated into amino acid
sequences, and based on the criteria of Zhang & Hewitt
[36], we found no evidence for nuclear mitochondrial
pseudogenes (Numts) in our PCR sequences. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) test and selective neutrality test were
implemented for cyt b sequences in N. taihuensis, which
indicated that there was no signs of recombination (P =
0.925) and the neutral hypothesis (no selection) could
not be rejected (P = 0.172) for these cyt b sequences. Thus,
the cyt b was suitable marker for analyzing the evolutionary history of this species.

Thirty-six different haplotypes were identified in the 354
samples analyzed (Table 1 and Table 2). The number of
haplotypes ranged from 5 to 25 for each basin. The populations with the greatest number of haplotypes were the
Taihu lake population (8) and Chaohu lake population
(8) in Yangze River basin, and the Hongzehu lake population (8) in Huai River basin. The haplotype frequency
distribution was strongly skewed, with the vast majority of
haplotypes found only once (24 out of 36) and restricted
to a single population. H36, the most common haplotype
found in 12 sampled populations with the exception of

individuals among all populations (56.82% for the Pearl

diversity, and r = 0.141 and P = 0.645 for nucleotide diversity, respectively). These results showed a medium/high
haplotype diversity and a low nucleotide diversity, and
that the genetic diversity for three near-coastal populations (the Taihu lake population and the Chaohu lake
population within the Yangze River basin, and the
Hongzehu lake population within the Huai River basin)
were higher than others (Table 1).
Population Structure and Phylogeography

haplotype groups with high bootstrap support (<60 %)
and there was no geographical structure among haplotypes (Figure. 2), which was supported by network analy-

sis (Figure. 3). In this study, only a few missing haplotypes
were detected, which indicated that we gathered enough
samples (both numbers of individuals and locations
within the distribution) for phylogeographical analysis.
Each haplotype was connected with others by 1 to 3 mutational steps, suggesting that there was no deep branching
among halotypes for this species. In network, H36 yielded
the highest outgroup weight (0.2941) followed by H27
(0.0588), H33 (0.0588), and H35 (0.0441), indicating
H36 was the most probable ancestral haplotype [37]. In
fact, the high frequency of shared haplotypes (i.e., H36,
H27, H33, H29) were found among all basins, which produced a pattern of population relationships associated
with the ancestry of the haplotypes found within each
population rather than with the hydrological network
(Figure. 2, Figure. 3). Thus, we suggested that there was no
obvious phylogeographic pattern within N. taihuensis.
Pair-wise comparisons ΦST test among 13 populations
showed that the differences among the most of populations were irrelevant to their distributions (Table 3).
AMOVA analysis revealed that there were significant subdivisions within and among populations of N. taihuensis,
but no significant genetic variance was found among
basins, with only 8.43% of the genetic variance was found
among basins (Table 4), which provided evidences that

the high level of population structure was not related to
the hydrological pattern. The Mantel test indicated no significant relationship between Φst/(1-Φst) and geographic
distance among populations, with P = 0.59 for all 13 populations among basins, P = 0.82 for 7 populations within
Yangze River basin and P = 0.19 for 4 populations within
Huai River basin, respectively.
The NCA analysis (see additional file 1) provided some
historical information for the pattern of genetic differentiation for N. taihuensis. The widespread clade 1–6 with significantly small Dc and large Dn, were indicative longdistance colonization (and/or past fragmentation). Clade

1, clade 2-2 indicated restricted gene flow with isolation
by distance, and the overall picture of NCA indicated historical contiguous range expansion.
Demographic Analysis
An examination of demographic histories revealed the
marked differences among the basins under study (Table
5, Figure 4, Figure 5). The skyline plots [38,39]of N.
taihuensis in the entire region and the Yangze River basin
showed a sudden stepwise expansion. Fu's Fs [40], RamosOnsins and Rozas's R2 [41] tests for the entire region and
Fu's Fs test for Yangze River basin were statistically significant negative, supported this point. Although both Fs and
R2 tests could not effectively tell the causes of bottleneck
or expansion, Fu and Li's D* [42] tests were not significant
(P > 0.05) for these populations, suggesting that there
were no historical reduction in effective population size in
these regions. The mtDNA mismatch analyses for the
entire region and the Yangze River basin showed bimodal
profile which might result from constant population size
among an old population or an admixture population
(Figure 5). However, the mismatch distribution goodness
of fit test (Table 5) was not significant, which indicated
that there were no severe departure from the estimated
demographic model. Moreover, the results of the coales-

cent based analysis using FLUCTUATE1.4 [43] showed
high growth rate, g = 2648.97 ± 556.26 for the entire
region and g = 3268.21 ± 873.30 for the Yangze River
basin, providing powerful evidences of population expansion in these regions. In contrast to that of the entire
region and the Yangze River basin, the skyline plot for
Huai River basin provided evidence that the exponential
growth model fitted the population demographic fluctuation well (Figure 4). Significant Fu's Fs (P <0.05) and
Ramos-Onsins and Rozas's R2 (P < 0.05) test, as well as
high growth rate (g = 2083.14 ± 529.35) confirmed population growth in Huai River basin, which was also supported by the test of Hri (P > 0.95), although the bimodal
mismatch distribution (Figure. 5) and significance of SSD
(P < 0.05) indicated a poor fit for the stepwise growth
model (Table 5). For the Pearl River basin, the bimodal
mismatch distribution (Figure. 5) and significance of SSD
(P < 0.05) values indicated a relative constant population
size. Fu and Li's D* test, Fu's Fs and R2 test for Pearl River
basin were not significant, which also rejected population
expansion/bottleneck model (Table 5). In addition, a relative constant population size was confirmed by a relative
low growth rate (g = -309.64 ± 955.56) with the approximate 95% confidence interval of g included zero in this
region.

According to the tau value (τ) and the mutation rates for
the cyt b gene (1% per nucleotide per generation per million years), the estimated expansion time was found to be
245.5 kyr ago for the entire region and 221.9 kyr ago for
the Yangze River basin. Using the coalescent method, an
estimate of TMRCA was 190.0 kyr for this species in the
Huai River basin and 73.53 kyr in the Pearl River basin,
respectively (Table 5).
To get a more detailed picture of the mutational pattern
for population expansion of N. taihuensis within the
Yangze River basin and the Huai River basin, GENETREE
[44] was used to construct a gene tree for determining the
distribution of mutation time. To make the sequence data
suitable for the infinite-sites model, four haplotypes
(H06, H07, H10, and H13) were excluded in this analysis.
It is worth to note that the possible removal of data can
have important effects on inference, and can lead to unusual conclusions [44], but the results from this procedure
can provide a rough profile for the distribution of mutations. As shown in Figure. 6, it was evident that the vast
majority of mutations occurred near the tips of the gene
tree, with 61.54% mutations occurring within 15.6 kyr in
the Yangze River basin and 66.67% mutations occurring
within 16.2 kyr in the Huai River basin.

Discussion
Population Genetic Structure and Phylogeography
Our results revealed low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0022
± 0.0001) and medium/high haplotype diversity (h =
0.713 ± 0.022) in N. taihuensis (Table 1), which could
reflect a recent expansion or a short evolutionary history
of the population [1,45-47]. This scenario was also supported by the absence of deep branching among haplotypes in the genealogical tree and the "star-like" shaped
network (Figure. 2 and Figure. 3) as well as NCA and
demographic history analysis (Table 5).

Phylogenetic inference based on unrooted ML tree
revealed that there were no distinct clades with high bootstrap support (<60%) and individuals from three basins

did not partition into distinct clades (Figure. 2), which
indicated no geographical structure among haplotypes.
The statistical parsimony network displayed a "star-like"
shape with H36 being the most probable ancestral haplotype (outgroup weight: 0.2941) (Figure. 3), which also
revealed a lack of geographical structure.
Beyond the prediction that vicariance among basins
should play an important role in shaping population
genetic structure, the results of AMOVA showed that the
contemporary drainage structure served as a poor model
in explaining the high levels of genetic differentiation,
with only 8.43% variance among basins, it was suggested
that there must be other factors shaping the genetic structure of N. taihuensis. Our results were in contrast to the
'Stream Hierarchy Model' [48], which showed that the distribution of genetic variation would follow different
basins. Similar results were found in many studies of
freshwater fish species [5,9,49,50], including Opsariichthys
bidens (Teleostei, Cyprinidae) conducted in the Pearl River
and the Yangze River in China [8]. However, some
researchers [10,11,16] have reported population genetic
structure in some freshwater fish species being analogous
to our study, and these provided evidence that the contemporary drainage structure did not coincide with the
genetic relationships among populations, or that the
instream barriers and complex population histories
played an important role in the determination of the population genetic structure.
Pair-wise comparisons between ΦST and AMOVA analysis
confirmed the existence of some degree of restricted gene
flow, which could be one of the important factors determining the genetic structure among populations of N.
taihuensis. However, the Mantel test indicated no significant relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distance among populations. The discrepancy
between these results indicated that the pattern of genetic
differentiation for N. taihuensis was complex and could
not be interpreted simply using the IBD model.

In contrast, NCA analysis revealed that multiple unrelated
long-distance founding events could be important in
determining the patterns of genetic diversity. In NCA, the
large Dn and small Dc suggests long distance dispersal
[16]. The NCA inferences for widespread clade 1–6,
including the most probable ancestral haplotype H36
with a significantly small Dc and large Dn, were indicative
of range expansion and long-distance colonization (and/
or past fragmentation) [51]. The observed population
relationships agreed with the population structure predicted by normal dispersal models of recently expanding
populations, with a portion of individuals migrating
beyond neighbouring demes because of rare long-distance migrants founding pocket populations under this
dispersal scenario [16]. Also, theoretical study has proven
that even though no effectively restricting gene flow exists
under these conditions, the effects on these founderevents can persist for thousands of generations, which
results in higher levels of divergence within than between
rivers [4]. In addition, it was also suggested that historical
basin rearrangements might form the analogous population genetic structure mentioned above [10,16]. Although
a strong uplifting of the Tibetan plateau occurred during
the Pleistocene in southwest China [31], there is no evidence to indicate that large-scale river rearrangement
occurred after the Pliocene in our study area [32]. It may
imply that historical basin rearrangements are not critical
in determining the current population genetic structure of
this species. Accordingly, we suggested that the current
complex population genetic structure of this species was
mainly constituted by multiple unrelated founding events
(long-distance colonization) of dispersal, and also
affected by contiguous population expansion and some
degree of restricted gene flow.
Demographic history
Statistical analysis of sequences was originally developed
to test selective neutrality of mutations and has recently
been used to test for population expansion. Demographic
events are also commonly analyzed by using the distribution of pair-wise differences or mismatch distributions of
non-recombining DNA sequence such as mtDNA [52,53].
Comparative studies on the test power of various statistics
suggested the superiority of Fs and R2 over other statistics
[40,41]. The power of these tests also depends on sample
size, and the R2 test is more powerful for a small sample
while Fs is more powerful for a large sample [41]. In this
study, Fs tests were significant for the entire region, Yangze
River basin and Huai River basin. However, R2 tests were
significant for the entire region and Huai River basin, but
not significant for Yangze River basin (Table 5). The different results for population expansion in this study may
reflect the differences in sample size requirements of the
tests as well as source information.

Mismatch distribution analysis was a common method to
infer population demography; however, some of inferences of the mismatch analysis were not consistent with
the results of the other indices in this study (Table 5).
Besides a relative lower statistical power of demography
analysis [41], other factors might also induce such scenario. First, the single stepwise expansion model in mismatch analysis might be inadequate for some populations
[54], and the use of an incorrect demographic model can
also lead to biased and invalid estimates of demographic
history and other evolutionary parameters [55]. As the
case for Huai River basin in this study, the skyline plot
provided evidence that the exponential growth model
could be more realistic than that of stepwise expansion
(Figure 4). Second, mismatch analysis needed a pair of
genes being chosen at random from the population. In
populations having gone through a recent and still large
expansion, the internal branches should be very short due
to the star-like structure of the tree, and a very few mutations would accumulate on those branches [40,52]. In this
case, pairs drawn from the sample would be not independent due to the shared portions of their genealogy
[56]. In this study, both unrooted ML tree and the statistical parsimony network displayed "star-like" shape with
no deep branching among halotypes (Figure 2, Figure 3).
So the inadequate information inferred from mismatch
analysis might attribute to the sign in the data set being
swamped by non-independence in this study. Moreover,
although the unrooted ML tree indicated that there were
no distinct haplotype groups with high bootstrap support,
the results of our phylogeographic analysis revealed that
there were high levels of genetic differentiation among
populations, and that the genetic pattern of this species
was mainly constituted by multiple unrelated founding
events. So cases of founder events not containing all
genetic types in some regions might be unavoidable, and
could severely affect the shape of the mismatch distribution. Finally, other factors such as high frequency of the
ancestral haplotypes, population substructure, or inbreeding could also affect the shape of the mismatch distribution, but to an extent these effects had not been quantified
[56].
However, the methods of mismatch distribution analysis
and neutrality test did not make full use of the data [57].
The coalescent-based method, by incorporating information from the genealogical tree structure of DNA
sequences, used more information in the data and seemed
to be more adequate to estimate demographic growth
[43,57,58]. In Yangze River and Huai River basin, three
different coalescent-based methods, the skyline plot
[38,39], the estimate of population growth rate (g) using
FLUCTUATE 1.4 [43] and the distribution of mutations
conducted by GENETREE [44], which provided the similar information of population expansion in these regions,

suggested that the superiority of the coalescent-based
method. In conclusion, despite of some inconsistency in
these results, it was evident that the combined demographic analysis could confirm population expansion in
Yangze River and Huai River basin, while a relative constant population size in Pearl River basin.

population size in the Pearl River basin, because this area
is a subtropical zone, with average 2 – 3°C higher than in
the Yangze River basin or the Huai River basin during the
Pleistocene [61]. There was no large-scale creation of
appropriate habitations (attached lakes) after the LGM in
this area.

During the last glacial maximum (LGM, about 18 kyr
ago), with sea levels lowered (120–140 m below present
sea level) [12], the present distribution range of N.
taihuensis was almost completely exposed and eradicated,
and this species should have been severely impacted by
the past glaciations. Our estimate of TMRCA in the Pearl
River and the Huai River basin, and the population expansion time for N. taihuensis in the Yangze River basin were
much older than that of LGM. It was difficult to link the
population demographic history to any particular Pleistocene paleo-climatic event. However, the gene tree (Figure. 6) provided evidence that the Pleistocene ice ages had
a great effect on the demographic history of this species.
That the vast majority of mutations occurred near the tips
of the gene tree suggests that population expansion events
mainly occurred after LGM. Therefore, we proposed that
in the Yangze River basin and the Huai River basin, the N.
taihuensis should have been the most severely impacted by
the past glaciations, surviving in some refugium, and then
post-glacial colonizations and population expansions
occurred with the climate warming and sea levels uplifting
after the late Quaternary (especially the LGM) [59]. Further, three near-coastal populations (the Taihu lake population and the Chaohu population in the Yangze River
basin, the Hongzehu Lake population in the Huai River
basin) contained higher numbers of haplotypes, haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) (Table 1),
suggesting that a glacial refugium could exist near the
estuaries. However, N. taihuensis has been exposed to pollution and habitat destruction for decades; its population
size has decreased drastically in out-flowing rivers and
estuaries of these basins under study [24,25]. No sample
from these locations could be collected to detect the probable glacial refugium. Further studies should be conducted in future. In addition, it is worthy to note that
many attached lakes formed in these areas with sea levels
uplifting after the LGM. For example, Chaohu Lake and
Taihu Lake in the Yangze River basin shaped about 12 and
2.6 kyr ago, respectively, and Hongzehu lake and Weishanhu lake in the Huai River basin was shaped about 1.4
and 0.6 kyr ago, respectively [60]. This indicated that the
formation of appropriate habitations facilitated historical
population expansions. This inference was compatible
with the "r-strategy" characteristic of N. taihuensis with
high relative fertility and a shorter generation time [29],
which also suggests its population size could be severely
affected by climate and habitation. Thus, it is not surprising that N. taihuensis has maintained a relatively constant

Implications for Conservation
The Salangid, Neosalanx taihuensis, is one of the most
important commercial species in this family. The dry or
frozen salangids are good materials in Chinese food, and
they are also exported to Japan and other southern-east
Asia countries. But, it has to be noticed that the population size of N. taihuensis and its fishing yield have
decreased rapidly in recent years [24,25]. For example, the
yield of Salangids per year in Poyanghu lake decreased
from 6 × 105 kg in 1960s to 104 kg in 1987 [62], and the
fishery production of N. taihuensis was completely collapsed in Poyanghu lake thereafter [63]. The yield of
Salangids per year in the Yellow River has also decreased
since 1987, and the lowest yield per year less than 103 kg
occurred in 1990 [29]. According to our investigation
being from 2004 to 2005 and the information from the
local fishery management offices, both adults and juveniles are now rarely found in the Yellow River. Some
authors thought that over-fishing was a serious problem
[64], but You et al. suggested that over-fishing was not the
most important threat to this species [65]. On the other
hand, the water pollution should be also the one of the
most serious threat to N. taihuensis [25,63,66]. The environment of N. taihuensis has been polluted because of the
waste water from urban, industry and agriculture [25].
Finally, the threat to N. taihuensis is also from the habitat
fragmentation. Since mid 1950s, the aquatic networks
have been fragmented dramatically with the construction
of dykes and floodgates across the river-lake connections
[60,66]. Most of the lakes in the mid-lower reaches lost
their connection with the main river watercourse by the
mid 1980s [60]. Consequently, most of the small lakes
nearly disappeared and the mid-large lakes shrank considerably resulting in unsuitable habitat for this species
[66,67]. Up to the present, no specific protect action has
been taken for N. taihuensis, so it is urgent to make an
effective plan to protect this economically important species.

The study on population structure and its phylogeoraphic
pattern could provide particularly information for us to
more broadly consider conservation options and more
accurately assign appropriate fishery management [68].
According to the model proposed by Moritz [69], Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs) are designated on the
basis of reciprocal monophyly at mitochondrial markers.
In the present study, phylogenetic inference based on ML
and NCA methods revealed that it was no geographical

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:201

structure among haplotypes in N. taihuensis, suggesting
that there was not a genetically distinct and independent
population that could be considered as an ESU. However,
AMOVA analysis indicated that significant genetic variance resulted from genetic differences among populations
and within basins. In addition, based on low vagility, geographic isolation among most populations and rapidly
population decline over the recent decades for this species
[24,25,63], we proposed that all populations should be
managed and conserved separately. Moreover, special
attention must be paid on habitat protection and pollution control because this species is susceptive to appropriate habitat change.

Conclusion
Our results showed that this species presented a very random genetic pattern and was not compatible with the
present hydrological structure. This genetic pattern might
be formed mainly by multiple unrelated long distance
founding events, combining with population expansion
and the instream barriers restricting gene flow. Demographic analysis revealed that the populations in the Pearl
River basin (TMRCA approximately 73.53 kyr) has kept a
relatively constant population size of N. taihuensis, but
populations in the Yangze River basin and the Huai River
basin expanded about 221.9 and 190.0 kyr ago, respectively, with the majority of mutations occurring after the
LGM. We concluded that the more favourable climate and
the formation of appropriate large-scale habitations facilitated this expansion. We suggested that it was necessary
to develop a suitable management plan for N. taihuensis
based on our results.

Methods
Sample Collection
We collected a total of 354 individuals of N. taihuensis
from 13 populations in the Pearl River, Yangtze River, and
Huai River basins from March in 2004 to September in
2005, 44 came from two populations of the Pearl River
basin in 2005 (P1–P2), 196 from seven populations of
the Yangtze River basin in 2004 (Y1–Y7), and 114 from
four populations of the Huai River basin in 2005 (H1–
H4) (Figure. 1 and Table 1). To eliminate the possibility
that these samples came from the related individuals
(schools of fishes), we selected many patches from one
location and resampled 2–4 times in same population. All
samples (whole fish) were stored in 95% ethanol.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and Sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from the muscle tissue using
standard phenol/chloroform procedures [70] or following the method of Asahida et al. [71]. PCR was performed
according to the method of Zhang et al. [30]. 1141 base
pairs (bp) of cytb DNA were amplified using the primers
L14321
(5'-CAGTGACTTCAAAAACCACCG-3')
and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/201

L15634 (5'-CTTAGCTTTGGGAGTTAAGGGT-3') in a 50 μl
reaction volume mixture containing 25 μl Premix Taq
(1.25 U EX Taq polymerase, 0.4 mM of each dNTP Mixture, 4 mM Mg2+; TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan), 1.0 μM of each
primer, approximately 50–100 ng total genomic DNA
template and 18–22 μl of sterile distilled water. A PE 9700
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) was used for the following cycles: pre-denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 30
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 54°C
for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 10 s, plus a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. Purified PCR products were
directly sequenced using primers L14321 and L15634
from both ends using the Big Dye Terminator Sequencing
Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) in a semi-automated
DNA analyzer (3700; Applied Biosystems). To avoid the
errors in amplification and sequencing, all singletons
among polymorphism sites were verified by an additional
amplification and sequencing. Sequences were aligned
using the Clustal X program [72] and rechecked against
the inferred reading frame for the corresponding protein.
Haplotypes were identified using Clustal X, and the cytb
haplotype sequences of N. taihuensis were deposited in
GenBank (EU376454–EU376489).
Data Analysis
Genetic Diversity and Population Structure
In order to test whether there is recombination within cyt
b gene, linkage disequilibrium (LD) test was conducted
using DnaSP 4.10 [73] and the average degree of LD, or
non-random association between nucleotide variants at
different polymorphic sites was tested using ZZ statistics
[74], which could be used for detecting intragenic recombination with the null hypothesis no recombination.
Also, neutrality test for cyt b was conducted in MEGA4.0
[75] to check selection by Z-test using the null hypothesis
H0: dN = dS [76,77], where dS and dN is the average
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site and the average number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, respectively.

Genetic diversity was measured for all samples and for
each basin grouping using haplotype diversity (h) and
nucleotide diversity (π) [78]. Values for the numbers of
haplotypes (H), polymorphic sites (S) and the mean
numbers of pair-wise differences among sequences (K)
were also estimated. These diversity indices were computed using the software DnaSP 4.10 [73]. As unequal
numbers of individuals varying from 13 to 34 per population in this study, Pearson's correlation tests were conducted to test values independence of the number of
haplotypes (H), haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide
diversity (π) against the number of individuals (N). Population structure and genetic variation of N. taihuensis
were characterized and compared with Arlequin version
3.11 [79]. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was

Page 13 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:201

used to asses the population configuration and the geographical pattern of population subdivision. In this study,
populations were grouped according to different geographical hierarchies using Φ-statistics [80]. Three hierarchical levels of subdivision were obtained: ΦCT, the degree
of differentiation among all basins, ΦSC, the degree of differentiation among populations within basins, and ΦST,
the degree of differentiation among all populations. We
tested whether the derived indices were significantly different from zero using a nonparametric permutation
method (10,000 Permutations). Moreover, we estimated
pair-wise genetics differentiation between populations
with ΦST [80,81] that includes information on haplotypes
frequency and information on haplotype sequences. Null
hypothesis of genetic homogeneity was assessed by
10,000 replications and sequential Bonferroni corrections
[82] for multiple comparisons were applied to all pairs
comparisons. To verify the hypothesis of isolation-by-distance (IBD), correlation between pair-wise linearized Φst/
(1-Φst) and river distances (Km) between populations
were analyzed using the Mantel test [83] with 10,000 permutations. Mantel test were conducted for all 13 populations among basins, for 7 populations within Yangze
River basin and for 4 populations within Huai River basin,
respectively. The river distances between populations
were determined based on river courses by AcrView 3.2,
which was also used in NCA analysis.
Phylogenetic and Phylogeographic Analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, we constructed unrooted maximum-likelihood (ML) tree using the program PAUP* 4.0
[84]. The TrN+I (I = 0.8148) model was selected as the
best-fit model for analysis using MODELTEST 3.06 [85].

Intraspecific data typically consists of many similar
sequences, some of which may be ancestral and its phylogenetic relationship are often more clearly and accurately
represented by a network [86]. In the present study, we
constructed a haplotype network based on statistical parsimony [87] using the program TCS version 1.18 [88]. A
distance matrix for all pair-wise haplotype comparisons
was constructed and the maximum number of mutational
differences justified by the parsimony limit of 0.95 was
estimated. The network first constructed haplotypes that
differed by a single change and added increasingly more
distant haplotypes until either all were included or the
maximum number of mutational steps was reached [88].
To check the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the
spatial distribution of genetic variation, we conducted the
Nested Clade Analysis (NCA). The resulting cladogram
calculated by the TCS program was converted into a
nested design using the nesting rules [89]. Reticulations,
or equally parsimonious connections within the network,
were resolved with two steps. First, alternative connections between haplotypes were broken following a series

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/201

of rules based on coalescence theory [90]. Second,
synapomorphies in the form of nonsynonymous substitutions in the cytb gene, a conservative class of substitutions,
was used to resolve all cases in which assignment to a
nested series was ambiguous [89]. The current and historic patterns of phylogenetic and geographic associations
were statistically tested using NCA implemented in GeoDis 2.0 [91], under the null hypothesis of no geographic
association among haplotypes using 10,000 permutations. The most suitable model explaining the historical
geographical distribution was identified using the inference key [51]. It is appropriate to address the caveats of
NCA analysis, the power of this method has been criticized for years [92-94], but Templeton defended NCA on
both theoretical and empirical grounds, and insisted this
method an extensively validated method for strong phylogeographic inference [51,95]. However, as no other better all-encompassing method can offer the ability to
explore patterns relating to complex historical scenarios at
present, the NCA method can still provide useful complementary information for phylogeographical analysis [96].
Demographic Analysis
To detect mechanisms responsible for observed mtDNA
patterns on various spatial and time scales, we developed
different data analysis methods. Due to the limits and pitfalls of each method, the combined results might provide
the best approximation of the population structure and
history.

First, changes over time in nonparametric estimates of the
effective population size of N. taihuensis were evaluated
with the skyline plots [38,39] using R 2.6.1 [97]. This
method can provide a rough profile of population demographic fluctuation, and can be used as a model selection
tool. The classic skyline plot typically produces 'noisy'
plots that display the stochastic variability inherent in the
coalescent process. While using the Akaike Information
Criterion [98], the generalized skyline plot could reduce
this noise, and thus produce smoother estimated population size plots [38]. As the power of skyline plots depends
on the numbers of variable nucleotide sites [38,55], we
conducted skyline analysis for the entire region, the Yangtze River basin and the Huai River basin with exception of
the Pearl River basin. Second, for the entire region and for
each basin, we examined the observed distribution of
pair-wise differences between sequences (mismatch distribution) [53]. Theoretical studies show that mismatch distributions are usually ragged or multimodal for
populations at stationary demographic equilibrium, but
are typically smoother or unimodal for populations that
have recently undergone a demographic expansion [53].
Occasionally, a pronounced rate of heterogeneity is
reported even among closely related lineages [59], so the
pair-wise relative rate test (pRRT) implemented in HyPhy

[99] was used to estimate and verify molecular clock constancy at the intraspecific level based on 1141 bp of 36
haplotypes and P. chinensis (DQ191115) [30] before performing the mismatch distribution analysis. One haplotype (H31) was identified to evolve at a significantly
different pace from the others. After removing this haplotype (H31), no other violation of the molecular clock constancy was found, so the other 35 haplotypes were used
for further analysis. Mismatch analysis was conducted
using Arlequin 3.11 [79] under a model of population
expansion. The overall validity of the estimated demographic model was evaluated by the tests of raggedness
index (Hri) [100] and the sum of squared differences
(SSD) [101]. Significance of Hri and SSD were assessed by
parametric bootstraps (10,000 replicates), and the significant value was taken as evidence for departure from the
estimated demographic model of sudden population
expansion. Third, Fu and Li's D* [42], Fu's Fs [40] and
Ramos-Onsins and Rozas's R2 [41] tests for mutation/drift
equilibrium were performed in DnaSP 4.10 [73] and Arlequin 3.11 [79] with 10,000 simulations. Although these
methods are commonly used to test the selective neutrality of genetic markers, these estimators are also sensitive
to demographic processes such as recent population
expansion or bottleneck. Because we were interested in
discriminating between demographic expansion and contraction, we chose two class test statistics, each with particular sensitivity to one demographic scenario. Fu and Li's
D* is designed to detect an excess of old mutations, characteristic of a population that has experienced a historical
reduction in effective population size [42,102]. In contrast, Fu's FS and R2 are sensitive to an excess of recent
mutations [40,41]. Finally, we used the coalescent-based
method implemented in FLUCTUATE 1.4 [43] to estimate
exponential growth rate (g) for this species. All runs
employed the following strategy: 10 short chains of 4,000
steps and five long chains of 400,000 steps, sampling
every 20th step; random starting trees; empirical nucleotide frequencies; initial g value of 0.0, starting θ-value
from Watterson's estimate [103]; and a 2.424 transition/
transversion (ti/tv) rate determined from MEGA4 [75]
under the Tamura-Nei model [104] using only ingroup
sequences. Runs were repeated five times to ensure consistency of estimates. As the estimates of g are biased
upwards [43], a conservative approach in testing for significance was adopted in our study, with values larger
than three standard deviations (SD) of g regarded as significant.
For stepwise expansion population, we used τ to calculate
the expansion time. The mismatch distribution analysis
provided a rough estimate of τ, with the starting time of
the expansion in units of 1/(2 ut) generations, where u is
the mutation rate per locus per generation. The relationship with the absolute time in years (t), is t = τ/2 uT. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/201

value of T is generation time (1 year for N. taihuensis), and
the value of u is derived from u = μk, where μ is the mutation rate per nucleotide per generation, and k is the
number of nucleotides in the sequence. For other populations, however, we used GENETREE [44] to estimate the
time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA).
GENETREE is based on a coalescent method to simulate
gene trees conditional on their topology, which can be
used to determine the distribution of TMRCA. In present
study, the most probable ancestral haplotype was analyzed by TCS program, and the TMRCA for a constant
population was calculated in GENETREE by first finding
the maximum-likelihood estimate [105] of θ following
the method of Joy et al. [106]. Each run was repeated three
times with a different starting seed number and 1,000,000
coalescent simulations. To get a more detailed picture of
the mutational pattern from population expansion, GENETREE was also used to construct a gene tree to determine
the distribution of each mutation for N. taihuensis.
Since there is no fossil record for N. taihuensis to analyze
their cartilage character, the genetic time clock is difficult
to calibrate. However, it has been convincingly shown
that most groups of fish have slower evolutionary rates
compared with those of other species, for example primates [35]. A calibration rate of 0.8–1% per Myr per generation has been accepted for mitochondrial proteincoding genes in Salmoniformes or Osmeriformes in many
studies [70,107,108]. For convenience, we used the mutation rate μ = 1% in this study.
