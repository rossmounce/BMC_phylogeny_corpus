Abstract
Background: There have been many claims of adaptive molecular evolution, but what role does
positive selection play in functional divergence? The aim of this study was to test the relationship
between evolutionary and functional shifts with special emphasis on the role of the environment.
For this purpose, we studied the fungal lipase/feruloyl esterase A family, whose functional
diversification makes it a very promising candidate.
Results: The results suggested functional shift following a duplication event where
neofunctionalisation of feruloyl esterase A had occurred with conservation of the ancestral lipase
function. Evolutionary shift was detected using the branch-site model for testing positive selection
on individual codons along specific lineages. Positively selected amino acids were detected.
Furthermore, biological data obtained from site-directed mutagenesis experiments clearly
demonstrated that certain amino acids under positive selection were involved in the functional
shift. We reassessed evolutionary history in terms of environmental response, and hypothesized
that environmental changes such as colonisation by terrestrial plants might have driven adaptation
by functional diversification in Euascomycetes (Aspergilli), thus conferring a selective advantage on
this group.
Conclusion: The results reported here illustrate a rare example of connection between
fundamental events in molecular evolution. We demonstrated an unequivocal connection between
evolutionary and functional shifts, which led us to conclude that these events were probably linked
to environmental change.

Background
During evolution, new functions are acquired as a consequence of an accumulation of substitutions that alters the
coding or regulatory sequences of genes. These evolution-

ary events are a key factor driving functional shift at transcriptional or biochemical level as well as shifts in subcellular localisation. There may be a range of knock-on
effects on descent, ranging from no phenotypic novelty to

whole new developmental processes such as those triggered by the cascades of gene expression in the case of
neo-expression of a master regulator gene [1]. It is a major
challenge to establish whether these mutations are fixed
into a population by neutral genetic drift or via positive
selection, and thereby evaluate the impact of the environment on this fixation. However, the literature reports very
few unambiguous connections between changes in amino
acid substitution rate (evolutionary shift) and functional
shifts, and the role played by the environment is often
limited to speculative discussion. Depending authors suggest different criteria are required for establishing a relationship, thus leading to different levels of confidence.
Fundamental criteria for studying molecular adaptation
during protein evolution would consist in i) detecting
evolutionary and functional shifts, ii) linking the sites
under positive selection to the functional changes, iii)
reassessing these evolutionary events in terms of response
to environmental context, iv) studying whether the novelty confers a selective environmental advantage, and v)
studying whether functional convergence occurred under
the same environmental changes. At present, the most
commonly cited examples of adaptation involve the relationships between particular phenotypic shifts in
response to a given environmental change, and many of
these studies either did not conduct evolutionary analysis
or failed to detect positive selection [2,3]. It is important
to confirm that the sites identified as being under positive
selection are actually involved in the functional novelty
before a clear positive selection-driven connection can be
established between evolutionary and functional shifts.
Thereafter, the next step is to identify the impact of environment context in these events and establish whether the
functional novelty responds to the environmental change
and confers a selective advantage for the species. To our
knowledge, only a few examples of functional gain fulfil
all these criteria. The best studies stem from human artificial selection (antibiotic, herbicide, and insecticide resistance genes) where resistance to drugs is essential for
survival [4,5]. To date, the full set of criteria listed above
has only been demonstrated for artificial selections such
as drug resistance and for one natural case concerning the
digestive RNases in Asian and African leaf monkeys [6].
The case of RNaseI from ruminants also offers a strong
example, with the novel biochemical function (i.e. the
ability to digest single-stranded RNA at low pH) attributed
to positively-selected sites [7]. This functional shift probably occurred in response to the acquisition of herbivory
which conferred an advantage for ruminants eating grass.
The examples of the retinal-binding membrane protein
proteorhodopsin in marine bacteria, where positivelyselected sites play a critical role in spectral light absorption, should also be highlighted since it illustrates how
the distribution of different λ max is correlated to harvest
depth, thus confirming an environmental link [8]. Finally,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/92

there are other examples where positively-selected sites
are involved in the functional shift but without there
being a clear link with the environmental shift [9-12].
Evolutionary shift is usually detected by estimating the
rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions
(ω = dN/dS) with ω = 1, < 1 and > 1 indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection and positive selection, respectively [13,14]. Given the strong selective pressure they are
subjected to, many amino acids are not replaced, and
adaptive evolution only operates at a few sites over a relatively short evolutionary period. A model that allows ω
ratio to vary among sites and lineages was therefore developed to improve the detection of positive selection
[13,15,16]. This model is specifically designed to analyse
the evolution of gene families where functional divergence may have caused adaptive evolution. The detection
of functional shift often hinges on preliminary experimental assays. However, there are databases containing
experimental records that be retrieved automatically and
then used to search for and detect functional divergence in
large-scale studies of multigenic families.
In the present study, we tested the robustness of the connections between evolutionary and functional shifts,
focussing specifically on the role of the environment. The
objective was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
multigenic families in which functional divergence has
been detected, and to test the relationships between evolutionary, functional and environmental shifts. In order
to test these connections, we first focused on an analysis
of the well-described fungal lipase/feruloyl esterase A family. Type-A feruloyl esterases (E.C. 3.1.1.73) are enzymes
responsible for cleaving the ester link between the
polysaccharide main chain of xylans or pectins and monomeric or dimeric ferulic acid. Thus, feruloyl esterases
make the cell wall increasingly vulnerable to further enzymatic attack [17]. A previous study, proposed a functional
classification of the feruloyl esterases with four subclasses
that were characterised and termed type-A, B, C and D
[18]. However, lipases (E.C. 3.1.1.3) catalyse both the
hydrolysis and the synthesis of esters formed from glycerol and long-chain fatty acids [19]. Despite strong structural and sequence similarities, this family presents two
distinct enzymatic activities, i.e. lipase and type-A feruloyl
esterase, that may have originated from evolutionary
events such as functional shift.
The evolutionary history of this family was reconstructed,
and the branch-site model was applied to test for positive
selection. We tested the connection between evolutionary
and functional shifts and then reassessed the connection
in terms of response to environmental context..

Phylogenetic analysis identified a monophyletic group

a paraphyletic group. Therefore, lipases currently appear
to be the primitive function while the feruloyl esterase A

could be the derived character. Feruloyl esterases A
appeared following a duplication event that occurred
before the separation of the Aspergilli (Euascomycetes)
and yeasts (Hemiascomycetes). The robustness of this
duplication node was confirmed by all three methods of
phylogenetic tree reconstruction, i.e. Maximum Parsimony, Neighbor Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods, with high bootstrap values of 95 and 78 for the
Neighbor Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods,
respectively. Given the duplication node and the appearance of the derived character, we hypothesised that positive selection occurred along the lineage ancestral to
Aspergilli-feruloyl esterase, and the branch was labelled as
a. To test evolutionary shift using Maximum Likelihood
analysis, we applied the branch-site model A developed
by Yang and Nielsen [15] to the dataset, with branch a
considered as the foreground branch and all others as
background branches in the gene phylogeny. Parameter
estimates under model A suggested that 45% of sites were
highly conserved across all lineages with ω0 = 0, whereas
17% of sites were identified under the neutrality assumption with ω1 = 1 fixed and 37% of sites were under strong
positive selection with ω2 = 999 (Table 1). This model was
compared to the following null models: model M1a (neutral) for test 1 and model A but with ω2 = 1 fixed for test 2
(Table 2). The likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) gave 2Δl =
53.78 with P < 10-4 and df = 2 for test 1 and 2Δl = 28.22
with P < 10-4 and df = 1 for test 2. Furthermore, similar
results (summarized in Additional File 1) were obtained
using the branch-site Model B. These tests provided highly
significant evidence of the presence of sites under positive
selection. The Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis identified 33 sites under positive selection along branch a at
the high probability level of > 95%. The vast majority (31
out of 33) of these positively selected sites are conserved
in the feruloyl esterase A group but not in the lipase
group. This pattern is typical of type I functional divergence [20]. Therefore, purifying selection had occurred
after the positive selection period, thus confirming the
important functional role of these sites for feruloyl esterase A activity. In order to test the sensitivity and robustness of these results, we conducted two LRTs under two

different assumptions on codon usage: i) the Fequal
model, which assumes equal codon frequencies and
ignores codon usage bias, and ii) the Fcodon model that
considers all 61 codon frequencies as parameters. These
controls are useful because codon usage bias can have radical effects on the estimation of ω. Despite small variations, the LRTs were highly significant, thus providing
further evidence of the presence of sites under positive
selection among the foreground branch (Table 2). Furthermore, among the sites previously confirmed as positively selected, all (F3x4) were identified by BEB analysis
using the Fcodon model and 15 were detected using the
Fequal model (see Additional File 2). Our conclusion on
the estimation of ω was therefore robust to assumptions
on codon usage bias.
In order to test whether codon usage bias is lineage-specific (between feruloyl esterase A and lipase group), we
used ENC to measure average codon usage bias. The averages measured for the feruloyl esterase A and lipases
groups were 52.5 and 47.2, respectively, indicating that
codon usage bias was not lineage-specific.
These results demonstrated that positive selection
occurred along the branch leading to the feruloyl esterase
A function in Aspergilli.
Relationship between evolutionary and functional shifts
In order to connect evolutionary shift to functional diversification in the lipase-feruloyl esterase A family, molecular adaptive evolution detection was performed by
integrating functionally described proteins. The purpose
of this analysis was to confirm the robustness of our
results by only using protein-encoding genes whose functions had been experimentally described. Branch b corresponded to the post-duplication branch (equivalent of
branch a) and was labelled as the foreground branch (Fig.
2). Branch-site model A applied to this new dataset (n =
12) confirmed that a significant proportion (39%) of sites
along branch b were under positive selection with ω2 =
14.2 (Table 3). Moreover, the robustness of these results
was also controlled under different assumptions on

codon usage, and the resulting LRT statistics were highly
significant for all models, thus providing further evidence
of the presence of sites under positive selection (Table 4).
These results were in full agreement with our initial analysis and thus established a correlation between evolutionary shift and the functional diversification, i.e. the lipase
and feruloyl esterase A activities.
In order to test whether positive selection also occurred in
different lineages along the phylogeny, others branches
were labelled as foreground branches. The calculations are
summarized in Additional File 3. LRTs gave no significant
results with ω2 > 1 except for the branches leading to the
lipases from Yarrowia lipolytica (ABA54275.1) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (O59952). In both these cases, the
sites under positive selection were not involved in a functional shift as the lipase function was conserved. Furthermore, there was no overlap between the positively
selected sites and the sites identified for branch b, thus
confirming a divergent evolution between lipases and feruloyl esterases A. Therefore, positive selection had also
occurred along different branches but only branch b led to
neofunctionalisation.
In conclusion, both phylogenetic and evolutionary data
suggested that the ancestral function (lipase) had shifted,
with molecular adaptation leading to a novel enzyme
(type-A feruloyl esterase).
Are positively selected sites involved in the functional shift?
An essential prerequisite to connecting evolutionary and
functional changes is to test whether positively selected
sites are involved in the functional shift. As positively
selected sites are assumed to be of major biological importance for type-A feruloyl esterases, we localised the 33 sites

on the 3D structure of A. niger FAEA (Fig. 3) and integrated functional data from site-directed mutagenesis into
our analysis (Table 5). Many positively selected amino
acids were found in specific regions known to be of major
importance for enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. This trend was particularly pronounced in the flap
region of the AnFAEA (residues 69–80). A review of previous reports of mutational and structural analyses led to
the identification of three clear areas, which are listed in
table 5. The first is the flap region, which in AnFAEA
exhibits a helical conformation similar to the open conformation of the lid found in lipases such as Rhizomucor
miehei. The inner surface of the lid from R. miehei lipase is
sufficiently hydrophobic to promote the association of
the enzyme with a lipid interface, whereas the flap region
of AnFAEA is more hydrophilic. Based on these results,
three polar amino acids (Asp71, Gln75 and Thr78)
located in the flap region were identified as being under
positive selection, thus confirming the significance of the
distinction (hydrophobic versus polar) between lipases
and feruloyl esterases. Moreover, the important role of the
flap residues was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis analyses, and the positively selected sites Asp71 and
Tyr80 were shown to be determinant for catalysis and substrate discrimination. The role of Tyr80 was also underlined by other mutational analyses where kcat or substrate
specificity was modified in response to the mutations
designed at this site (Table 5). Secondly, it should be
noted that Tyr100 was also a positively selected site.
Indeed, given the close vicinity of catalytic serine residue
and Tyr100, it could be argued that replacing a conserved
Phe in the lipase family with Tyr100 in AnFAEA would
reduce hydrophobicity at the bottom of the active sites,
and could therefore affect substrate recognition. The
mutation of the Thermomyces lanuginose lipase Phe100 to

models.

Tyr was demonstrated as an essential step in conferring
ferulate ester-hydrolysing activity (Table 5). Taken
together, these results confirmed that positively selected
sites are unambiguously involved in the functional shift.
Thirdly, the three positively selected sites (Glu236,
Gln238, and Asn244) were all assumed to play a role in
the difference in substrate specificity between lipases and
type-A feruloyl esterases based on the structure of
AnFAEA. Indeed, the active-site cavity is confined by the

flap region (residues 69–80) and the 226–244 loop that
exhibits structural plasticity for the substrate binding site.
Thus, all three identified sites could play key roles in this
essential region, especially in the 236–244 loop. In conclusion, biological data from mutagenesis experiments
confirmed that the positively selected sites had been
robustly identified, and made it possible to establish the
connection between positively selected sites and functional shifts.

Discussion
Correlating evolutionary, functional and environmental
shifts is a delicate task, and there are only a few published
studies (described above) that establish a direct link
between these shifts. The aim of this study was to extend
our investigation into the relationship between evolutionary and functional shifts to focus on the role of the environment. For this purpose, we studied the fungal lipase/
feruloyl esterase A family whose functional diversification
makes it a promising candidate. One study showed that
type-A feruloyl esterases were more sequence-related to
lipases than they are to other groups (type B-D), but evolutionary analysis was not performed [18].
In this study, we constructed phylogenetic trees and identified positive selection along the branch leading to feruloyl esterase (type A) activity. Positively selected sites were
identified using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) procedure of the branch-site model A [15,21]. Indeed, BEB is a
reliable method that gives a false-positive rate of less than
5% when sites are identified at the selected cut-off. As
codon usage bias could have a stronger effect on estimation of ω than the transition/transversion rate bias, we

estimated the effect of codon usage bias on LRTs [22]. The
parameter estimates proved relatively stable, thus demonstrating that LRTs were robust to assumptions on codon
usage bias. The next level of our analysis was to unambiguously demonstrate that the positively selected sites were
indeed involved in the functional shift, which is a sine qua
non condition to clearly establishing a connection
between evolutionary and functional shifts. Based on sitedirected mutagenesis data, we established that three sites
under positive selection were involved in the functional
shift leading to the type-A feruloyl esterase function. These
mutational experiments made it possible to switch both
enzymatic functions. Moreover, several positively selected
amino acids were located in specific regions known to be
of great functional significance for the substrate specificity
and enzymatic activity of type-A feruloyl esterases and
lipases. Hermoso et al. stated that active site plasticity
between lipases and feruloyl esterase A depends on the
nature of specific residues and on structural modifications
within the active sites [23]. The 33 positively selected sites
that we identified offer potential candidates for this plasticity. These results therefore made it possible to connect
evolutionary and functional shifts.

remain complementary to our analysis, they do not estimate the strength or direction of natural selection pressure. Here, we have provided an evolutionary dimension
by identifying a branch containing a number of sites
evolving very significantly faster than under neutrality.
Moreover, these sites caused neofunctionalisation, meaning that functional shift is driven by positive selection.

For instance, a homologous position for a particular
amino acid that is conserved in one subfamily but highly
variable in another can be interpreted as functionally
important in the first subfamily but less so in the second.
In contrast, when radically different amino acids are fixed
between subfamilies, the functional interpretation is that
these sites fulfil different but equally important roles in
the two subfamilies [24-26]. Positions with variable rates
of divergence in different regions of a tree could provide a
basis for relating individual amino acid residues to specific functional differences in certain branches [27,28].
Although these approaches, which are based solely on rate
shifts, are implicitly linked to protein evolution and

The final step of our analysis focused on the second level
of our investigation concerning the role of the environment in the adaptive evolution of the lipase/feruloyl esterase A family.; thus, evolutionary history was
reconstructed and reassessed in terms of response to environmental pressure. There had been a duplication event
occurring before the separation of the Hemiascomycetes
(yeasts) and Euascomycetes (Aspergilli), and which was
followed by a functional shift in the Euascomycetes but
gene losses in the Hemiascomycetes. Functional diversification following gene duplication is a frequent event dur-

ing evolutionary history of multigenic families. Here,
phylogenetic and evolutionary data suggested that the
ancestral function (lipase) was shifted, leading to enzymatic novelty (type-A feruloyl esterase). It is interesting to
note that Aspergilli conserved both functions, i.e. the
lipase and feruloyl esterase A activities, which makes it the
only genus identified to date that possesses this distinctiveness. However, increasingly powerful genome
sequencing capabilities coupled with biochemical experiments may lead to feruloyl esterase A activity being
extended to other groups. Moreover, feruloyl esterase A
activities could be functionally substituted by nonhomologous proteins with similar enzymatic properties,
for instance by the type-B feruloyl esterases.
Key insight to understanding the role of the environment
would be gained by pinpointing the selective advantages
that could be conferred by feruloyl esterase A activity. The
Aspergilli genus is a well-known plant cell wall degrader,
and feruloyl esterases are able to hydrolyse the ester bonds
linking ferulic acid to plant cell wall polysaccharides.
Thus, feruloyl esterases facilitated the access of mainchain-degrading enzymes to the polysaccharide backbone, thus allowing efficient lignocellulose degradation.
The colonisation by the land plants (Embryophyta) that
appeared during the Silurian period (-430 to -400 Myr)
could have progressively driven neofunctionalisation in
Aspergilli. This period estimation is strengthened by our
phylogeny by the fact that the Hemiascomycete yeasts are
believed to have diverged from a common ancestral fungus at least 400 million years ago. Enzymatic novelty in
Euascomycetes could have generated a selective advantage
that became fixed in this group during the emergence of
the land plants. The appearance of feruloyl esterase A
activities could be regarded as an efficient step among several possible routes towards plant colonisation. Therefore,
we hypothesised that a connection between functional
and environmental shifts could be established according
to the impact of the role played by feruloyl esterase A in
plant cell wall degradation. However, based on the knowledge currently available, this connection can only remain
hypothetical.
Structural comparison between Clostridium themocellum
feruloyl esterases (XynY and XynZ) and AnFAEA revealed
that feruloyl esterases could have evolved through functional convergence following evolutionary divergence
[23]. Future studies are needed to analyse whether convergence occurred in other enzymes involved in the same
plant cell wall degradation functions as type-A feruloyl
esterases. Indeed, the occurrence of convergence greatly
strengthens the connection between evolutionary shift
and environmental changes [5]. At present, several artificial conditions (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes) and only
one natural case are able to identify unambiguous conver-

gence via a clear connection between evolutionary (positively selected sites) and functional shifts [6]. It would be
useful to study whether generalised environment-driven
functional shifts could be have been responsible for enzymatic diversification in fungi kingdom.
The positively selected sites we identified could be used as
"probes" for functional inference. These sites also represent potential novel targets in biotechnology for mutational analyses or in paleobiochemical experiments
designed to resurrecting the ancestral function of the
lipase/feruloyl esterase gene [29-31].

Conclusion
In summary, these results illustrate a rare example of the
connection between fundamental events of molecular
evolution. We demonstrated that evolutionary shift (positively selected sites) has led to functional diversification
that could be related to environmental changes. Future
studies are scheduled to test other multigenic families in
order to analyse and further characterise the general
trends underpinning these connections.

Methods
Construction of phylogenetic trees
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the automated genomic annotation platform FIGENIX [32] to
retrieve sequences and alignments and perform phylogenetic reconstruction. The pipeline used applied three different methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction, i.e.
Maximum Parsimony [33], Maximum likelihood [34]
and Neighbour Joining [35], and a midpoint-rooted consensus tree was built. Bootstrapping was carried out with
1000 replications. Bootstrap values are reported for each
method (for a detailed description of the pipelines and
models used, see [36]).
Evolutionary analysis
Preparation of datasets
Protein and DNA sequences were retrieved from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [37]. The
protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW [38]. Correspondence between protein alignment and each DNA
sequence was established using the Wise2 software package followed by manual adjustments [39]. The final alignment contained 217 and 226 codons for dataset 1 (n = 29)
and dataset 2 (n = 12), respectively.
Detection of positive selection
The codeml program of the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis
by Maximum Likelihood [13,40]) 3.15 software package
was applied to test for positive selection. PAML uses a
Maximum Likelihood algorithm to assign likelihood
scores to different models for selection. If a higher likelihood score was obtained for a model incorporating posi-

tive selection than a null model without positive
selection, this constitutes evidence for positive selection.
We first used the model A implemented by Yang and
Nielsen [41]. This model enables ω (= dN/dS) to vary both
between sites and between lineages, and was implemented in the maximum likelihood framework. Branches
a and b tested for positive selection were labelled as foreground branches, and all remaining branches were
labelled as background branches. This model was then
used to construct two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by comparison with a model that does not identify positive selection. The null hypothesis for test 1 is the site model M1a
[21] which assumes two site classes with 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1
= 1 for all branches. For test 2, the null hypothesis is the
branch-site model A but with ω2 = 1 fixed. Positively
selected sites were identified by the Bayes empirical Bayes
(BEB) method [21]. The effect of codon usage bias on
LRTs was estimated using two assumptions on codon
usage: the Fequal model and Fcodon model.
Measurement of codon usage bias
Codon usage bias (effective number of codons [ENC];
[42]) was computed using DNASP software (version
4.10.9) [43].
Visualisation of protein structures
Protein structures were visualised using accelrys® DS Visualizer 1.5, available at [44]. The PDB number of the FAEA
from A. niger is 1USW.
