Abstract
Background: Co-infections of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
Tb) are steadily increasing and represent a major health crisis in many developing countries. Both
pathogens individually stimulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) release from infected cells and TNF, in
turn, enhances the replication of each. A recent report on a Phase I clinical trial suggested that etanercept
(soluble TNF receptor) might be beneficial in treating HIV/M. Tb co-infected patients. We sought to
determine if a small molecule inhibitor of TNF synthesis and activity could block replication of either
organism and thus be a potential adjunct to existing drugs targeting these agents.
Results: LMP-420, a novel anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits TNF, was tested for HIV-1 inhibition both
alone and in combination with AZT (3' -azido-3-deoxythymidine). LMP-420 alone was tested against M.
Tb. HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or M. Tb-infected human alveolar
macrophages (AM) were treated with a single dose of LMP-420 and viral or bacterial replication
determined after 7 or 5 days respectively. Viral replication was determined from supernatant p24 levels
measured by ELISA. M. Tb replication was determined by bacterial culture of macrophage lysates. LMP420 alone inhibited HIV replication over 7 days with an IC50 of ~300 nM. Combination of LMP-420 with
AZT doubled the level of HIV inhibition observed with AZT alone. LMP-420 alone inhibited the replication
of virulent M. Tb by >80%, more than that observed with anti-TNF antibody alone.
Conclusion: Inhibition of TNF with inexpensive, small-molecule, orally-active drugs may represent a
useful strategy for enhancing the activity of currently-available antiviral and anti-M. Tb agents, particularly
in those areas where co-infections with these pathogens act to synergistically enhance each other.

Background
AIDS and tuberculosis annually kill more than three million people worldwide and the numbers are growing. Of
the >40 million adults and 5 million children infected
with HIV, 95 percent live in developing countries and
about one-third are co-infected with M. Tb. As many as
half of HIV-infected patients in Africa have M. Tb and up
to 80 percent of M. Tb-infected patients are infected with
HIV. People co-infected with both HIV and M. Tb have a
100-fold greater risk of developing active M. Tb disease
and becoming infectious, increasing the spread of disease
even further and faster. If active M. Tb goes untreated in
HIV+ patients, most will die within one year.
M. Tb is the most common opportunistic infection occurring in HIV-infected individuals in resource poor countries and it accelerates HIV-associated morbidity and
mortality as well as viral replication [1]. Studies have
shown increased transcription of the HIV long terminal
repeat (LTR) in cultured monocytic cells exposed to either
live M. Tb or cell wall components [2]. In these same studies anti-TNF antibodies reduced the increased transcription of the HIV LTR by >50% [2]. Kitaura et al. [3]
demonstrated that incubation of U1, a chronically HIVinfected human promonocytic cell line, with various
strains of mycobacteria resulted in enhanced p24 antigen
release into the supernatant. The amount of TNF produced by U1 cells correlated with p24 antigen release and
antibody to TNF inhibited p24 release induced by mycobacteria. In a recent review Collins et al. [4] postulate that
higher viral loads, increased HIV diversity, and changes in
cytokine/chemokine levels in HIV-infected individuals
with M. Tb appear to be related to a localized immune
stimulation. They suggest that increased levels of TNF and
MCP-1, induced by M. Tb, may activate HIV replication in
lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages that are resident or have migrated to M. Tb-infected organs, such as
the pleura or lung. In addition, studies from the same
group demonstrated that the HIV present in blood, following a M. Tb-mediated burst in load and diversity, is
phylogenetically related to HIV clones that have evolved
independently in M. Tb-infected lung or pleural compartments [5]. The potential of MCP-1 (CCL2) to upregulate
HIV replication was also confirmed by Fantuzzi et al. [6]
who reported that infection of monocyte-derived macrophages with laboratory-adapted HIV or primary viral isolates in the continuous presence of anti-CCL2 antibody
resulted in significantly lower p24 release compared to
control cultures. Further, CCL2 neutralization resulted in
the intracellular accumulation of p24 antigen and they
suggested that CCL2 might represent an autocrine factor
important for enhancing virion production, most likely
by affecting the macrophage cytoskeleton.

Other organisms also enhance HIV replication through
increased TNF production. Zhao et al. [7] reported that the
protozoan parasite Leishmania enhances both HIV virus
transcription and production in human tonsillar tissue
infected ex vivo. Use of pentoxifylline and neutralizing
anti-TNF or anti-IL-1-alpha antibodies showed that this
Leishmania-mediated increase in HIV production was
linked to increased production of TNF and IL-1-alpha.
As noted above, TNF-mediated enhancement also applies
to the replication of M. Tb. Engele et al. [8] demonstrated
that infection of human alveolar macrophage (AM) with
virulent strains of mycobacteria induced the secretion of
significantly higher levels of TNF than attenuated strains
and that TNF levels correlated with the ability of the
mycobacteria to multiply intracellularly. Treatment of
infected macrophages with anti-TNF antibodies reduced,
while exogenously-added TNF enhanced, the growth rate
of intracellular bacteria.
Studies supporting the potential role of TNF in HIV replication and pathogenesis are those of De et al. [9], who
used HIV-transgenic mice (tg26) which appear normal at
birth but die within 3- 4 weeks. The skin of these transgenic mice shows diffuse scaling and expresses high levels
of both HIV mRNA and gp120. Sera of Tg26 mice have a
50-fold increase in TNF levels compared to those of nontransgenic mice. Treatment with antibody to TNF reduced
serum TNF levels by ~75%, prevented death, resulted in
near normal growth, and produced a marked decrease in
skin lesions and a profound reduction in the expression of
HIV mRNA and gp120. Sha et al. [10] reported the results
of a clinical study in which etanercept (Enbrel®; dimerized
soluble TNF receptor) was used for as a single bolus to
treat HIV-infected subjects who had already received 12
weeks of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) followed by an additional 16 weeks of HAART with or without recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2). Plasma
IL-6 and C-reactive protein levels increased after rhIL-2
treatment but etanercept pretreatment blunted these
increases and appeared to be well tolerated. Recently,
Wallis et al. [11] reported on a 28-day Phase I safety study
of etanercept in 16 patients co-infected with HIV-1 and M.
Tb. Etanercept (25 mg) was administered twice weekly,
beginning on day 4 of the M. Tb therapy, for 4 weeks.
Controls were 42 CD4-frequency-matched patients with
sputum smear-positive M. Tb and CD4 cell counts >200
cells/µl. In etanercept-treated subjects trends toward superior responses to M. Tb treatment were evident in body
mass, performance score, number of involved lung zones,
cavitary closure, and time to sputum culture conversion.
Etanercept treatment resulted in a 25% increase in CD4
cells by week 4 although none of these positive trends
were statistically significant because of the low number of
patients enrolled in this Phase I study.

Inhibition of TNF by LMP-420
Inhibition of TNF by LMP-420. A) Dose response of LMP-420 on human PBMC stimulated with LPS. PBMC were resuspended
to 3.75 × 106 total cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum) and 0.4 ml of cell
suspension put into each well of a 48-well tissue culture plate. To each well was added 0.1 ml of media or media containing
LMP-420 (diluted from a stock solution of 338 mM in DMSO) to give the indicated final concentration. The cell cultures were
incubated for 2 h at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 and then 55 µl of media or LPS (S. typhosa, 1 µg/ml of media) was added to
each well. The cultures were incubated 20 h at 37°C, the contents of each well removed to a 5-ml polypropylene centrifuge
tube and centrifuged for 20 min at 400 g. The supernatants were removed to a fresh tube and frozen at -20°C until assayed by
solid phase ELISA (R & D Systems). B) Dose response of LMP-420 on human PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 or SEB. PBMC
were resuspended to 3.75 × 106 total cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing 5% heat-inactivated human AB
serum) and 0.4 ml of cell suspension put into each well of a 48-well tissue culture plate. To each well was added 0.1 ml of
media or media containing LMP-420 (diluted from a stock solution of 338 mM in DMSO) to give the indicated final concentration. The cell cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 and then 55 µl of media or anti-CD3 (25 ng/ml
final concentration) or SEB (100 ng/ml final concentration) was added to each well. The cultures were incubated for 48 h at
37°C, the contents of each well removed to a 5-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 20 min at 400 g. The
supernatants were removed to a fresh tube and frozen at -20°C until assayed by solid phase ELISA (R & D Systems). C) RTPCR of samples prepared from LPS-stimulated human PBMC. PBMC (1 × 106/well) were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with the
indicated concentration of LMP-420 and then stimulated for 3 h at 37°C with LPS (S. typhosa; 1 µg/ml). Cells were harvested,
total RNA extracted, cDNA prepared and RT-PCR performed for 30 cycles using primers for TNF-α and β-actin obtained
from R & D Systems.

Thus, several studies suggest that minimizing TNF levels
in both HIV and M. Tb-infected patients might decrease
both the replication of each pathogen as well as the pathogenesis associated with co-infection of these two agents.
Furthermore, pilot clinical studies suggest that TNF levels
can be safely lowered in conjunction with existing antiretroviral or anti-M. Tb therapies. Currently-marketed TNF
antagonists are proteins requiring injection and with relatively long half-lives, making it more difficult to cease TNF
antagonism once it has been initiated. In the present study
we sought to determine whether LMP-420, an antiinflammatory nucleoside analog that is a potent inhibitor
of TNF and MCP-1 synthesis, would block the replication
of either HIV or virulent M. Tb in human primary cell cultures and whether LMP-420 might synergize with AZT to
inhibit HIV replication.

Inhibition by LMP-420 of TNF secretion by LPS-stimulated
PBMC
Figure 1A illustrates inhibition of TNF accumulation in
supernatants of human PBMC cultured for 20 h with 1 µg/
ml of LPS after a 2-h pretreatment with varying concentrations of LMP-420. LMP-420 inhibits LPS-stimulated TNF
release in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of
approximately 50 nM. At the highest concentration tested
(50 µM), LMP-420 inhibited 98.6% of TNF release compared to a DMSO alone (0.5%) control. Since TNF
released from LPS-stimulated PBMC is derived mostly
from monocytes/macrophages, we wanted to determine if
LMP-420 could also inhibit TNF release from stimulated
lymphocytes. As shown in Figure 1B, LMP-420 also inhibited TNF release from PBMC stimulated with either of two

LMP-420 inhibits TNF at the transcriptional level
Inhibition of TNF release can occur at a number of different points in stimulated cells. These might include initial
binding of the stimulating ligand, transcription of TNF
mRNA, translation of mRNA to protein, expression of
TNF on cell membranes, or the cleavage of TNF from the
cell membrane. Since LMP-420 inhibits TNF release from
PBMC stimulated with a variety of ligands other than LPS
(including IL-2, zymosan, Pansorbin; data not shown) we
assumed that inhibition was occurring at a post-stimulus
step. PBMC were treated for 2 h with different concentrations of LMP-420, the cells stimulated an additional 3 h
with LPS, total mRNA isolated, cDNA prepared, and RTPCR performed using specific primers for human TNF. As
shown in Figure 1C, LMP-420 inhibits transcription of
mRNA for TNF in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting
that this is the mechanism by which it effects its inhibition
of TNF protein release.
LMP-420 is highly selective for TNF
In order to determine whether LMP-420 was for selective
for inhibition of TNF, PBMC were incubated with either
media or a single concentration of LMP-420 (1 µM; 20 ×
IC50 for inhibition of TNF) for 2 h and then incubated
overnight with LPS (1 µg/ml). Supernatants were assayed
for released cytokines/chemokines using a Bio-Rad multiplex assay kit which measures 17 cytokines/chemokines
simultaneously. As shown in Table 1, LMP-420 potently
inhibits the release of TNF and MCP-1 (91 and 95%

respectively) with a lesser effect on the release of IL-1 and
IFN-γ (33 and 38% respectively). In contrast, there was no
significant effect on the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, G-CSF,
or MIP-1β. Although there were slight (~30% or less)
decreases in the levels of several other cytokines/chemokines, the levels present were too low to ascribe significance
to these effects. Since these culture supernatants were
from overnight cultures we cannot at this time rule out the
possibility that the inhibition of MCP-1 is secondary to
the inhibition of TNF by LMP-420, since TNF can itself
stimulate release of MCP-1. This pattern of cytokine/
chemokine inhibition is, of course, only representative of
PBMC stimulated with a TLR4 ligand (LPS) which preferentially stimulates monocytes/macrophages and a similar
pattern of cytokine/chemokine inhibition may not necessarily be observed with other stimuli.
Inhibition of HIV-1 replication in human PBMC using LMP420
Because of LMP-420's ability to inhibit TNF release, both
from monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes, we
hypothesized that LMP-420 should inhibit the replication
of HIV-1 since HIV-1 can induce TNF and TNF can activate
HIV-1 viral LTR. Activated PBMC were incubated with varying concentrations of LMP-420, ranging from 0- 50000
nM, at the same time that HIV was added and then incubated for 7 days without further addition of LMP-420. As
shown in Figure 2, LMP-420 inhibits in a dose-dependent
manner the replication, as determined by HIV p24 antigen release, of HIV in PBMC. The percent of p24 release,
compared to media controls, is 97%, 65%, 45%, 16% and
0.2% at LMP-420 concentrations of 5, 50, 500, 5000, and

50000 nM, respectively. Thus, at an LMP-420 concentration of 500 nM, HIV replication is inhibited by 55%. This
same concentration of LMP-420 would inhibit ~90% or
more of 24 h TNF release from LPS-stimulated PBMC (Figure 1A) and perhaps slightly less in cultures stimulated
with lymphocyte-specific stimuli (Figure 1B).
LMP-420 enhances the inhibitory effect of AZT on viral
replication
Our hypothesis was that the LMP-420 inhibition of HIV
replication shown in Figure 2 was due to the host cells'
inability to support that replication through TNF release
and subsequent activation of viral LTR in an autocrine or
paracrine fashion. Based on this postulated mechanism,
LMP-420 should synergize with antiviral agents, such as
AZT, which target the virus directly. As shown in Figure 3,
addition of suboptimal doses of 50 or 500 nM LMP-420
to a suboptimal dose of 10 nM AZT results in a further
decrease of HIV-1 p24 antigen release from 32% (AZT
alone) to 20% (AZT + 50 nM LMP-420) and 16% (AZT +
500 nM LMP-420) of controls. Addition of 50 or 500 nM
LMP-420 to 100 nM AZT resulted in a decrease of HIV-1
p24 production from 10% (AZT alone) to 6% (AZT + 50
nM LMP-420) and 4% (AZT + 500 nM LMP-420) of vehicle control. Thus 500 nM LMP-420, a dose which by itself
results in a 55% inhibition of viral replication, used in
combination with AZT (10 nM or 100 nM) increases the

LMP-420 inhibits the replication of virulent M. Tb in
human AM
Since a compound which could inhibit the release of TNF
from both HIV and M. Tb would have added potential in
areas where both pathogens are endemic, we first examined the ability of LMP-420 to inhibit TNF release from M.
Tb-infected AM. AM derived from BAL were exposed to
varying concentrations of LMP-420 for 2 h prior to being
infected (MOI = 5) with M. Tb, the cells were cultured an
additional 24 h, and TNF levels in the supernatants determined. LMP-420 inhibited TNF release from M. Tbinfected AM by 55, 68, and 90% at concentrations of 0.35,
3.5, and 35 µM respectively (data not shown). Since one
of us (S. Stenger) had previously shown that anti-TNF
antibody could block replication of virulent M. Tb [8], we
now sought to determine if LMP-420 could likewise
inhibit the replication of M. Tb in human AM. As shown
in Figure 4, addition of 10 µM LMP-420 to cultures of
human AM infected with a virulent strain of M. Tb
(H37Rv; MOI = 1; efficiency of infection = 36 ± 9%)
inhibits the replication of M. Tb by >80% over the subsequent 108 h of culture. The concentration of LMP-420
used (10 µM) would be expected to inhibit at least 7080% of the M. Tb-stimulated TNF release under the conditions of these assays. Interestingly, the inhibition of replication by LMP-420 was even greater than that observed
using 10 µg/ml of an anti-TNF polyclonal antibody which
might suggest that LMP-420 inhibitory effects involve
more than just TNF inhibition.
LMP-420 is non-toxic to PBMC at the concentrations
tested
Inhibition of the replication of either HIV or M. Tb by
LMP-420 could arguably be the result of depletion of host
cells by LMP-420. We first tested LMP-420 for toxicity in a
MitoScan™ SMP assay looking at electron transfer with
NADH [12]. No toxicity was observed with LMP-420 at
concentrations up to 20 µM and the EC50 for LMP-420mediated toxicity was 300 µM, a concentration that is
6000-fold greater than the EC50 for inhibition of TNF (Figure 1A). In addition to examining LMP-420's effects on
mitochondrial function, three human lymphoid cell lines
(CEM, lymphoblastoid; THP-1, monocytic; K562, erythroleukemic) were grown for 72 h in 50 µM LMP-420 with
no observed effects on cell proliferation, as measured by
[3H]-thymidine incorporation (data not shown). Further
confirmation of the fact that LMP-420 is non-toxic are
studies in which PBMC were stimulated for 72 h with 80
ng/ml of SEB in the presence or absence of either 2 µM or
0.4 µM LMP-420. Under these conditions LMP-420 inhibited TNF release by ~80% and ~60% respectively but had
negligible effects on SEB-stimulated lymphocyte prolifer-

(data not shown). Cumulatively, these results suggest that
LMP-420's effects on either TNF release or the replication
of HIV-1 or M. Tb are not due to cellular toxicity.

Discussion
Co-infection with HIV and M. Tb is a major problem in
developing countries. In addition to difficulties associated
with simultaneous treatment of infections with two major
pathogens, data suggests that each of these pathogens can
enhance infection with the other. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that both HIV- and M. Tbinfected cells produce TNF and that either autocrine or
paracrine produced TNF can enhance the replication of
both pathogens.
Although in vitro studies such as those presented here suggest that targeting TNF to suppress replication of HIV and/
or M. Tb might be a logical approach to enhance existing
therapies, there are several reports of reactivation of latent
M. Tb in patients being treated with TNF antagonist therapies [13,14]. The large majority of cases involving reactivation of latent M. Tb in patients treated with TNF
antagonists appear to have occurred with infliximab
(Remicade™; humanized monoclonal antibody) with
~144 and ~35 cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 patients
occurring with infliximab and etanercept respectively
from January 1998- September 2002 [15]. In a recent

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/3/1/8

report of 12 cases of reactivation of latent M. Tb in
patients in California being treated with TNF antagonists,
11 of the patients were being treated with infliximab [13].
Since infliximab is capable of binding to the transmembrane form of TNF and can subsequently activate complement, it is possible that infliximab might injure or kill
TNF-expressing cells and thus function as a generalized
immunosuppressive. Indeed, infliximab treatment in
patients with Crohn's disease has been reported to induce
apoptosis of both monocytes and T lymphocytes [16,17].
Although reactivation of latent M. Tb has also occurred
with etanercept, it should be noted that a large proportion
of patients being treated with these TNF antagonist agents
are also being treated with other suppressive drugs such as
methotrexate or steroids. In the study noted above [13], 8
of the 12 patients experiencing reactivation of latent M. Tb
were being treated with prednisone, methotrexate or azathioprine.
An advantage of a small-molecule inhibitor of TNF transcription and release (such as LMP-420) over biologicals
such as infliximab or etanercept is that such a molecule
offers greater pharmacological control. The current TNF
antagonists are designed to neutralize circulating TNF and
are thus given at sufficiently high doses to maximize the
time between injections which is dictated by the pharmacological half-lives of the molecules. By their nature, these
antagonists neutralize essentially all of the circulating TNF
and are irreversible. Although a small molecule will likely
have a shorter half-life, this allows the intervention to be
stopped should the clinical situation warrant it. Furthermore, LMP-420, while a very potent inhibitor of TNF
release, inhibited only ~93% and 98% of TNF release
from LPS-stimulated PBMC at 0.5 and 5.0 µM respectively
(Figure 1A). The low level of TNF release which "escapes"
inhibition by LMP-420 may be sufficient to maintain
immune surveillance while LMP-420's inhibition of the
majority of released TNF may protect against TNF-related
pathogenesis. Nonetheless, since HIV+ patients are
already immunosuppressed by their disease, more extensive testing, including clinical studies, will be necessary to
determine whether treatment with a TNF biosynthesis
inhibitor which is non-toxic and doesn't affect general cell
function, such as LMP-420, might also reactivate latent M.
Tb.
Our data confirms that LMP-420, an inhibitor of TNF
transcription and subsequent biosynthesis, is able to
inhibit the replication of both HIV-1 (Figure 2) and virulent M. Tb (Figure 4) in primary cultures of human cells.
The doses at which LMP-420 inhibits replication of these
pathogens are doses which have not been found to be
toxic to either primary human leukocytes or human cell
lines. Furthermore, LMP-420 has also recently been demonstrated to inhibit replication of M. Tb in human blood-

LMP-420 inhibits replication of M. Tb in human alveolar macFigure 4
rophages (AM)
LMP-420 inhibits replication of M. Tb in human alveolar macrophages (AM). AM were collected by bronchial-alveolar lavage from healthy volunteers and infected overnight in culture
with M. Tb (H37Rv; MOI = 1; efficiency of infection = 36 ±
9%). Cells (5 × 105) were plated in 500 µl of medium in a 24well plate supplemented with nothing, rhuTNF (10 ng/ml),
anti-TNF (10 µg/ml) or LMP-420 (10 µM). The first time
point for plating to determine CFU was taken immediately
after the overnight infection. The second time point was
taken after 120 h (108 h after treatment was initiated). Data

derived dendritic cells [18]. Evidence doesn't suggest that
LMP-420 has any direct anti-viral (G. Cianciolo, unpublished data) or anti-bacterial activity but rather, that it
inhibits replication of these two pathogens by inhibiting
the host cells' ability to support the pathogens' replication. In our studies we used an HIV strain (Ba-L) that is
known to be monocyte/macrophage tropic. Whether
LMP-420 would also affect T cell tropic strains of HIV
remains to be determined although HIV-infected T cells
also produce TNF [[19][20][21][22]] and LMP-420 inhibits TNF synthesis in T cells (Figure 1B). The dose at which
LMP-420 inhibits 50% of HIV replication in PBMC is at
least several-fold greater than the dose required to inhibit
50% of LPS-stimulated TNF release from PBMC. However,
HIV replication is measured after 7 days of culture and
LMP-420 was added only once, at the time of virus addition. Whether replenishing the LMP-420 during the 7 days
of culture would lower the effective concentration of LMP420 required for viral inhibition remains to be determined.

In 24-h cultures of LPS-stimulated PBMC (Table 1), 1.0
µM LMP-420 significantly inhibits the release of MCP-1
(95%) as well as TNF (91%). We have recently demonstrated by RT-PCR (G. Cianciolo, data not shown) that
upregulation of mRNA for MCP-1 is completely blocked
in 1.0 µM LMP-420-treated PBMC after 3 h of LPS stimulation. Nonetheless, we still cannot rule out the possibility
that the inhibition of MCP-1 is secondary to the inhibition of TNF since studies in human airway epithelial cells
have demonstrated strong TNF induction of MCP-1
mRNA within 1 h, the shortest time-period examined
[23]. However, LMP-420 has recently been shown to also
inhibit the upregulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1,
VCAM-1, CD40) on human brain-derived endothelial
cells activated by either TNF or lymphotoxin (LT; TNFbeta) and to prevent the release of microparticles (a sign
of inflammation) from such activated cells [24]. Regardless of the mechanism of MCP-1 inhibition by LMP-420,
blockade of this chemokine is potentially advantageous
since MCP-1 has been demonstrated to enhance HIV replication [25]. Although the role of MCP-1 in the replication of M. Tb is less clear, a recent study demonstrated that
co-infection of macaques with simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) significantly increased levels of MCP-1 in both serum and tissue samples [26].

Conclusion
The cell culture studies presented here confirm that strategies designed to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, such as TNF and MCP-1, may be
beneficial in inhibiting the replication of HIV-1, M. Tb, or
both. The potential advantages of small-molecule, inexpensive, stable compounds over existing biologicals in
areas where both pathogens are endemic suggest that this
approach is deserving of further investigation.

Methods
Reagents
LMP-420, 2-NH2-6-Cl-9- [(5-dihydroxyboryl)-pentyl]
purine, a gift from LeukoMed, Inc. (Raleigh, NC), was
stored as a 10 mM stock solution in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Anti-CD3
(OKT3) antibody, staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB),
and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were obtained from Ortho
Biotech (Bridgewater, NJ), Calbiochem (San Diego, CA),
and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.
Separation and stimulation of PBMC
PBMC were separated from buffy-coated blood of healthy
donors by standard Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation procedures. PBMC were activated with 5 µg/ml of
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus 10 ng/ml of IL-2 in RPMI
1640 culture medium with L-glutamine (2 mM), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml pen-

icillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) for
2- 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air.
Infection of stimulated PBMC with HIV-1Ba-L
Activated PBMC were washed and infected with HIV-1Ba-L
(NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program, Germantown, MD) at 500 × TCID50 determined by previous
propagation in normal PBMC for 5- 7 days. HIV-1Ba-Linfected PBMC were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 and
95% humidified air for 2 h, mixed by gentle swirling every
20- 30 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 200 g at room
temperature. Cell pellets were gently resuspended in
growth medium.
Treatment of infected cells with LMP-420 and/or AZT
HIV-1Ba-L infected PBMC (1 × 106/ml/well) were treated
with or without drug (LMP-420 and/or AZT) with equivalent amounts of DMSO in a 48-well plate at 37°C in 5%
CO2 and 95% humidified air for 7 days. Compounds were
not cytotoxic at the concentrations used during the assays
and viability of infected and treated cells, as measured by
trypan blue, was >85%.
Titration of HIV-1 p24 antigen
Supernatants were collected at 7 days post-infection and
viral replication quantitated by measurement of the HIV1 specific core antigen, p24, by radioimmunoassay, using
the protocol provided by the supplier (Beckman Coulter,
Hialeah, FL).
Infection of AM with M. Tb
Human AM were obtained and infected with M. Tb as previously described [8]. Briefly, AM were obtained from the
discarded bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients
who had undergone bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes after all identifiers had been removed. Purity
(>95%) of the cells was confirmed by α-naphthyl-acetate
esterase staining (Sigma-Aldrich) and flow cytometric
analysis (CD3 <1%, CD19, CD56, CD66, CD1 negative).
Viability was >96% as determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion.

AM were infected with single cell suspensions of M. Tb in
six-well culture plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a final volume
of 3 ml. After 4-h incubation at 37°C, extracellular bacteria were removed by intensive rinsing with PBS. To quantitate mycobacterial growth, the adherent cells were
harvested by gentle scraping with a cell scraper and replated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in a 24-well
plate (final volume 500 µl) in complete medium without
antibiotics plus 10% human serum. Cell viability of
infected AM was determined by trypan blue exclusion and
was >99%.

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/3/1/8

For determination of CFU, infected cells were lysed with
0.3% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) to release intracellular bacteria. At all time points an aliquot of un-lysed, infected
cells was harvested and counted, allowing an exact quantification of cells as well as determination of cell viability.
Recovery of cells was >80% in all experiments, with cell
viability regularly >90%. CFUs of lysates were determined
as previously described [8].
Toxicity assays for LMP-420
General toxicity of LMP-420 was evaluated using the
MitoScan™ SMP assay (submitochondrial particle; Harvard Biosciences, Holliston, MA) per the manufacturer's
instructions. Verapamil-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
an internal positive control (EC50~150 µM). Compounds
were prepared as a 338 mM stock (LMP-420) or a 285 mM
stock (verapamil-HCl) in DMSO and the highest concentration of DMSO in the assays was 0.7%. MitoScan™ provides a rapid, homogeneous assay that correlates highly
with cell proliferation assays, cell viability assays and
other cytotoxicity or apoptosis endpoints such as MTT,
LDH and Alamar Blue assays. In addition to its effects on
mitochondrial activity, LMP-420 was tested for growthinhibitory effects on three human lymphoid cell lines
(CEM, THP-1, K-562; ATCC, Manassas, VA). To each of
duplicate sets of 6 wells of a 96-well cell culture plate was
added 5 × 103 of each cell type. One set was cultured for
72 h in media alone and the other was cultured in 50 µM
LMP-420. For the last 4 h of culture, 0.5 µCi of [3H]-thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmole; New England Nuclear-PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA) was
added to each well and the contents of each well harvested
onto glass fiber filters and incorporated radioactivity
determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry.
