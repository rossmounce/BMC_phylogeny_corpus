Little ecological divergence associated with
speciation in two African rain forest tree genera
Thomas LP Couvreur1*, Holly Porter-Morgan2,3, Jan J Wieringa4 and Lars W Chatrou5

Abstract
Background: The tropical rain forests (TRF) of Africa are the second largest block of this biome after the Amazon
and exhibit high levels of plant endemism and diversity. Two main hypotheses have been advanced to explain
speciation processes that have led to this high level of biodiversity: allopatric speciation linked to geographic
isolation and ecological speciation linked to ecological gradients. Both these hypotheses rely on ecology: in the
former conservation of ecological niches through time is implied, while in the latter adaptation via selection to
alternative ecological niches would be a prerequisite. Here, we investigate the role of ecology in explaining present
day species diversity in African TRF using a species level phylogeny and ecological niche modeling of two
predominantly restricted TRF tree genera, Isolona and Monodora (Annonaceae). Both these genera, with 20 and 14
species, respectively, are widely distributed in African TRFs, with a few species occurring in slightly less humid
regions such as in East Africa.
Results: A total of 11 sister species pairs were identified most of them occurring in allopatry or with little
geographical overlap. Our results provide a mixed answer on the role of ecology in speciation. Although no sister
species have identical niches, just under half of the tests suggest that sister species do have more similar niches
than expected by chance. PCA analyses also support little ecological differences between sister species. Most
speciation events within both genera predate the Pleistocene, occurring during the Late Miocene and Pliocene
periods.
Conclusions: Ecology is almost always involved in speciation, however, it would seem to have had a little role in
species generation within Isolona and Monodora at the scale analyzed here. This is consistent with the
geographical speciation model for TRF diversification. These results contrast to other studies for non-TRF plant
species where ecological speciation was found to be an important factor of diversification. The Pliocene period
appears to be a vital time in the generation of African TRF diversity, whereas Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have
had a smaller role on speciation than previously thought.

Background
The tropical rain forest (TRF) biome covers just ~7% of
land but harbors over half of the planet’s terrestrial biodiversity. The TRF of Africa represents the second largest extent of this biome after the Amazon basin, and
contains high levels of species diversity and especially
endemicity [1]. Two main African rain forest blocks

exist. The most widespread one corresponds to the Guineo-Congolian floristic region [2], which extends almost
continuously (expect for a break at the Dahomey gap in
Togo and Benin) from West Africa into the Congo
basin and east of the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Uganda. The East African rain forests are concentrated on a smaller and patchier surface extending from
Kenya to southern Mozambique along the coast and the
Eastern Arcs [3,4]. This latter block contains one of the
highest concentrations of endemic species on Earth [5].
Understanding the evolutionary processes responsible
for high species richness of TRF has been a major focus

of evolutionary biology [6], although most studies have
focused on the Amazon and Australian rain forests.
Two main hypotheses have been advanced to explain
speciation processes that have led to high levels of biodiversity in African TRF [7,8]: 1) geographic isolation
between populations restricted to rain forest patches
resulting in allopatric speciation (e.g. the refuge model,
mountain speciation model, riverine barrier model
[9-13]); 2) divergent selection related to ecological gradients where genetic and/or geographic isolation is minor
[7,14]. Ecology is central to the processes of divergence
and speciation [15,16] but in the two speciation models
above (geographic isolation vs. divergent selection) ecology plays contrasting roles [17]. In the former, it would
be expected that the variables that make up a niche
have low rates of change over a phylogeny (niche conservatism [18,19] or niche stasis [20]). This pattern
would be predicted when taxa that are restricted to rain
forest patches have been tracking the geographical distribution of this biome, being unable to adapt to changing conditions. In contrast, in the case of divergent
selection, ecological divergence and adaptation to new
niches would be a fundamental prerequisite [7], and the
variables comprising species’ niches would be expected
to deviate less from a random distribution over a phylogeny than in the case of geographic isolation. For example, adaptation to more arid environments since the
Miocene has been suggested to be a driver of diversification in some African plant genera [21]. Thus, a possible
first step in unraveling TRF diversification in Africa is
to understand the role of ecology in explaining present
day diversity.
New developments in ecological niche modeling
(ENM) or species distribution modeling have provided
important advances in the understanding of species distribution [22], as well as in the study of ecological speciation [e.g. for plants [23], [24], [25]]. These methods
combine data about the known distribution of a species
with climatic and other relevant variables to identify
those environmental conditions that are suitable for that
species and predict its potential distribution. Such methods allow for a precise quantification of ecological parameters specific to each species, which in turn enables
the use of statistical tests to answer questions about
niche differentiation or similarity [26,27].
Here, we used an integrative approach including a
dated molecular phylogeny [28,29] and ENM to investigate the evolutionary ecology of two African TRF genera
Isolona and Monodora (Annonaceae). Both genera contain small to large trees largely distributed across the
African rain forests from West/Central Africa to East
Africa. A recent monograph of both genera provides
information about species delimitation as well as their
distribution [28]. Isolona contains 20 species, 5 of them

endemic to Madagascar, while Monodora contains 14
species and is absent from Madagascar [28]. A large
number of species grow in lowland rain forests, but a
few occur in montane areas (above 1200 m), as well as
in less humid regions growing in thicket or woodland
such as in Malawi and northern South Africa. Both genera have been recovered as sister with maximum support nested within a large clade of African genera [30].
Moreover, the presence of phylogenetic signal of certain
climatic variables identified within Monodora has been
previously suggested but not explicitly tested [31].
Finally, Hutchinson underlined [32] that the ecological
niche of species is multi dimensional. For this study we
shall use climatic data for Africa as this is available for
all species used in this study, in contrast to other ecological data for which we have very spars records (pollination biology, biological interactions, etc.). Moreover,
bioclimatic models appear suitable to generate predictions of species ecological requirements at the macroscale studied here (continental distribution of species)
[33].
The goal of this study was to understand the role of
ecology in the speciation and distribution of both genera. We identified sister species and tested for niche
similarity and for phylogenetic signal of different climatic variables within the clade. Specifically we
addressed the following questions: Do sister species
have similar ecological niches? Can we detect a phylogenetic signal of environmental variables?

Results
Phylogeny

Using the molecular phylogenies published by [28,29]
we identified a total of 11 species pairs (Figure 1) generally based on strong support values. No comparisons
were undertaken within the monophyletic Malagasy
clade because the focus of this study was directed
towards mainland Africa. In the cases where support
values were low comparisons were undertaken on species that were grouped together in the different prior
phylogenetic analyses (e.g. BEAST, MrBayes). Morphology and palynology provide little information on species
relationships when compared to molecular phylogenies,
especially in Monodora [28,34]. Monodora crispata and
M. tenuifolia were considered as sister albeit with low
support because these two species were also recovered
as sister (with low support) in other analyses [see [28]].
In one case, relationships between three species (M.
myristica, M. undulata and M. laurentii) were unresolved and thus comparisons were undertaken between
all possible pairs (four pairwise comparisons). Within
Isolona, four species of mainland Africa were not
sampled and their exact placement remains unknown.
Even though strong support for some sister species

1) the first value corresponds to the test of the first species vs the background of second, and then vice versa

relationships are lacking, the phylogeny of Couvreur et
al. [28,29] provides the best hypothesis of species relationship to date.
Mean divergence ages (Table 1) for all sister species
ranged from on average 1.6 to 6 million years ago (Ma).
In some cases, estimation of the 95% highest posterior
density confidence intervals was not possible given the
low node support. Finally, most sister species pairs
occurred in allopatry or had little geographic range
overlap (Table 1). Calculations indicated that species
pairs varied from no overlap (0% in two cases) to 89.3%
overlap (one case, see discussion).
Bioclim variables

For most sampled species there were more than ten
unique locality data points, except for Isolona capuronii (1), I. pleurocarpa (7), Monodora carolinae (7), M.
globiflora (6), M. hastipetala (4) and M. stenopetala
(6), all being rare or localized species. Analysis of the

variation of each bioclim variable between species
underlines important ecological characteristics within
and between species of each genus. For Isolona, differences between East and West/Central species were few
(Figure 2) and included lower Isothermality (BC3),
higher temperature seasonality (BC4) and lower annual
precipitation (BC12) for the East African species. In
contrast, East African species of Monodora showed differences for several variables when compared to the
West/Central African ones. For example, they are subject to lower isothermality (BC3), higher temperature
seasonality (BC4) and lower annual precipitation
(BC12) as well as other related variables such as BC13,
BC14, BC16, BC17 and BC19 (Figure 3). Montane
restricted taxa (> 1100 m) such as Isolona congolana, I.
linearis and Monodora globiflora are exposed to lower
mean temperatures (BC8, BC9, BC10 and BC 11, see
additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for all the
variables).

Sister species comparisons: principal component analysis

species pairs (Table 1). Only the species pairs M. myristica /M. undulata and I. congolana /I. hexaloba were
significantly different on all axes tested.

Environmental niches were compared between sister species using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on all 19
bioclim variables and significance between principal components were tested under Mann-Whitney U test.
Together, the first and second components explained
between 59% and 87% of the variation among the 19 bioclim variables. The directionality of the loadings for components 1 and 2 were quite variable, (Figures 4 and 5) but
in general, one axis was related to variation in precipitation while the other was related to temperature variation.
PCA indicated environmental overlap between most
pairs of sister species. Three main patterns were
observed: 1) Species with narrower distributions were
included within the environmental variation of a more
widely distributed species (for example Monodora laurentii within M. myristica; M. hastipetala within M. junodii; Isolona cooperi within I. campanulata; 2) species
that overlapped for part of their variation (for example
M. laurentii /M. undulata; Isolona congolana /I. hexaloba); 3) species with clearly separated ecological space,
which was found in just one species pair: Monodora carolinae /M. stenopetala. For most comparisons one to
two PC axes were not significantly different between

Niche modeling

Ecological niche modeling was undertaken on all sampled
species using Maxent [35]. The area under the curve
(AUC) values for all species models ranged from 0.9194 to
0.998 (21 with an AUC higher than 0.95) indicating reliable model performance (see additional file 9). In four
models (all of them for Monodora species) no standard
deviation (SD) was calculated, even though the respective
AUCs were high, because the number of total samples was
too low (for species with occurrence points less than 8
only one training point can be used from which the SD
cannot be estimated). Although several species in this
study exhibited low sample sizes, the resulting AUCs indicate that meaningful models have been produced (see
additional file 9). The Maxent software has been documented to produce models with good predictive performance from small numbers of sample localities [36-38].
The environmental variable that had the highest contribution to the prediction of each species when training
the models (highest training gain) is reported in Table

6 comparisons showed less niche similarities than
expected, namely two tests for the species pair Monodora hastipetala /M. junodii, and all four tests for Isolona heinsenii /I. linearis.

Phylogenetic signal of climatic variables

Blomberg et al. [40]. Tests were undertaken on each

(Table 2). The QVI varied from 0.34 to 0.79 in Isolona,
0.23 to 0.99 in Monodora and 0.46 to 0.85 in the whole
clade (Table 2). The randomization tests on 1000

posterior trees indicated that 9/19 variables in Isolona,
10/19 variables in Monodora and 14/19 variables in the
whole clade were significantly smaller than expected by
chance (mean QVI in less than the 99 th percentile)

indicating strong correlation of those variables with the
phylogeny. Interestingly, variables identified with significant phylogenetic signal were not always the same
between both genera. In Isolona, temperature related
variables showed more signal than precipitation ones (6/
11 vs. 3/8), whereas in Monodora precipitation variables
showed more signal (4/11 vs. 6/8). For example, BC17
(Precipitation of Driest Quarter) presented the highest
phylogenetic signal (i.e. the lowest values of QVI, Table
2) within Monodora whereas BC4 (Temperature Seasonality) showed the highest phylogenetic signal in Isolona.
The K statistic was higher than expected under a random evolutionary process (K > 1) and showed phylogenetic signal (after a randomization test) for 10 variables
in Isolona and just 6 in Monodora (Table 2). These variables were the same as identified under the QVI for
each genus. Only in Isolona was one variable (BC1)
detected as having a significant signal not found when
using the QVI (Table 2). When K was calculated for the
clade as a whole all of the variables were lower than 1,
indicating a shortage of phylogenetic dependence under
a random evolutionary model. However, 13/19 showed
significant values when compared to the random distribution of the variables on the tree. These were generally
the same as those identified on the whole clade using

the QVI. This would suggest that our data is robust to
phylogenetic uncertainty because the mean QVI and its
significance were based on 1000 posterior trees (see
Methods).
Phylogenetic signal of ecological divergence

An adaptation of the age-range correlation method following [26] was used to test if there was a phylogenetic
signal in ecological divergence using the niche similarity
indices I and D [26]. The slope of the regression in Isolona was negative supporting the idea of an increase in
niche differences with phylogenetic distance. In contrast,
Monodora had a positive slope of the regression (Figure
8) which indicates that niche similarity among the species increases through time. However, neither of these
analyses were significantly different than the null
hypothesis (Table 3) indicating the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal of the ecological niche.

Discussion
Ecological dimensions of speciation

This study is to our knowledge the first one explicitly
using ecological niche models and phylogeny to understand speciation in a clade of African rain forest trees.
Our results indicate little geographical overlap between

sister species (7/11 comparison with less than 30% overlap, Table 1). Thus, most species pairs occur in allopatry, a result consistent with the geographical isolation
hypothesis, although this would also be expected under
the ecological gradient hypothesis. In one case the overlap was relatively large, for example between M. junodii
and M. hastipelata (~ 90%). However, this might be an
artifact in the way the overlap statistic was calculated
(see Methods) as both these species never grow in complete sympatry (i.e. next to each other, pers. obs.).
Monodora hastipelata is a local endemic to a small area
in the Matumbi Hills in Tanzania [41] while M. junodii
has an extensive distribution across East Africa [28].
Most species pairs show visual overlap in ecological
space (Figures 4 and 5) and are never completely separated by PCA analysis (expect for the M. carolinae and
M. stenopetala pair, see below). In contrast, the niche
similarity tests [26] based on the ecological niche models demonstrated that all species pair had highly significantly different niches (Table 1). This test, however, is
known to be very strict, and rejection of similarity can
occur based on very small niche differences, especially
for allopatric species [42]. At the scale studied here (distribution of species at the continental level) the probability of two species having completely identical niches
is very low [18] and these tests might be too stringent,
something already noted in other studies (e.g. [43]). The
background tests appear better suited for this type of
analyses and is generally used when species occur in
allopatry [42]. Just under half of the tests undertaken
(48%, Table 1) supported the hypothesis of niche similarity between sister species whereas 13% (6/44) of the
tests supported a significant difference. However, four of
these latter tests were found for the species pair Monodora junodii/M. hastipetala, and could be linked to the
few data points associated with M. hastipetala (see
Methods). In several cases (17/44) a non-significant
(NS) result was found, which is suggestive of a lack of
power to detect niche differentiation/similarity, either
linked to a low sample size or to the distribution of the
habitat [26]. NS results were found either between
widely distributed species with a fair number of collections (e.g. I. hexaloba and M. myristica), suggesting
habitat heterogeneity as a source of lack of power, or
between species with a small number of collections (M.
stenopetala /M. carolinae; I. thonneri /I. dewevrei).
Finally, we also tested each bioclim variable for phylogenetic signal, i.e. the statistical nonindependence
among species of the variables given their phylogenetic
relationships. Direct interpretation in terms of evolution
of significant phylogenetic signal of traits is difficult and
should be done with caution [44,45]. These tests yielded
different results depending on the level of the analysis
(genus versus clade). Nevertheless, both statistics

Page 12 of 19

identified several bioclim variables within each genus
and for the clade as containing significant phylogenetic
information (Table 2). Such a result was already suggested for Monodora [31] but not for Isolona or the
clade as a whole. However, it should be noted that for
the genus tests the power of the randomization
approach to detect significance of the K statistic might
be slightly low for 14-16 tip phylogenies [40]. Here, we
do not attempt to draw strong conclusions about the
rate of evolutionary change or the pattern of the evolutionary process linked to these variables. We simply
underline that many variables are not randomly placed
on the phylogeny and that they deviate from a random
evolutionary process as generated under the Brownian
motion model (as interpreted by the K statistic). This is
what would be expected under niche conservatism and
the geographical speciation model, although exactly how
they have influenced its diversification would require
more in depth model fitting analyses [44,46]. In addition, we failed to identify any phylogenetic signal of ecological niche overlap (Figure 7) [26]. Absence of
phylogenetic signal can be the result of a mixture in the
speciation pattern [47], or it may be directly related to
the quality of the data. In Monodora, the latter would
appear to be the case as phylogenetic resolution within
the West species is low, and specimen locality data from
two sister species pair in East Africa are few, both being
sources of error.
The analyses at several levels using different
approaches provide a mixed signal on the role of ecology in speciation. Although sister species within this
clade do not have identical niches, which is to be
expected [18], they are in several cases significantly
more similar between each other than by chance alone
(Table 1). Overall however, based on PCA, ecological
niche modeling and phylogenetic signal analyses, our
results do provide some support to the idea that in
terms of diversification, ecological speciation as viewed
through climate has not played a major role in the evolution of Isolona and Monodora species. This contrasts
with several recent publications where significant ecological divergence was generally demonstrated for northern hemisphere plant sister species such as in Lonicera
[48], Cyclamen [24], five Andean Solanum species [25]
and in most clades of the South American genus Hordeum [43]. They all concluded that ecological speciation
was an important factor of diversification within these
genera. Moreover, in the mainly African distributed
cucurbit genus Coccinia, frequent biome shifts were
inferred during a period of 6 Ma between forest, woodland and semi arid habitats, implying an important role
of ecological diversification [49]. Finally, the spread of
arid environments in Africa during the Neogene was
suggested to be an important driver of diversification of

Couvreur et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:296
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/296

some partially TRF genera such as Acridocarpus [21].
Adaptation to alternative (more arid) environments
appears extremely limited within Isolona and Monodora
mainly because of the strong evolutionary constraint
applied by the precipitation variables (Table 2). A strong
correlation between rainfall and species distribution was
also found within Neotropical Annonaceae in general
[50].
The only species pair for which speciation might have
relied on ecology is found in the East African species M.
carolinae et M. stenopetala (Figure 5), the former occurring in moist semi-deciduous coastal forests of southern
Tanzania and Mozambique while the latter is found in
dense thickets and woodlands of Malawi (Figure 7).
However, the background test indicated that M. stenopetala had a significantly more similar niche when compared to the environmental background of M. carolinae
(in the other direction, i.e. the similarity of M. carolinae
using the background of M. stenopetala, was non-significant, and thus inconclusive). This result is quite intriguing given the important ecological differences
identified using PCA between these two species, and
could be an artifact due to the low sample size of both
species (7 for M. carolinae; 6 for M. stenopetala). It
remains unclear exactly how many samples are necessary to produce a robust ecological niche model,
although some authors have suggested more than 10
[23,27] or even over 100 [see [51]]. Also, these results
could be due to the established background that was
used for the tests, here defined as all grid cells within 20
km of known occurrence localities. The background
tests are known to be sensitive to the definition of species ‘background’ and therefore a finer or coarser background region could yield different results [25].
Temporal dimensions of speciation

The estimated mean ages of the origin of species in both
genera inferred by Couvreur et al. [29] (Figure 1, Table
1) are dated to before or at the beginning of the Pleistocene (9/11 speciation events are older than 2.4 Ma,
Table 1). This would suggest that the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations had little effect on species diversity
within these genera. This result is intriguing because the
geographical isolation hypothesis was thought to be
especially important during the Pleistocene because of
the numerous successive rain forest expansion and fragmentation [52-54]. Thus, although ecology plays a little
role in the speciation processes of these genera in
Africa, the timing of these events pre dates a period of
intensive climatic variation and hence potential isolation
events. Rather, most speciation events occurred in the
Late Miocene and during the Pliocene (between 6-2.4
Ma). It is important to note that these conclusions are
based on the mean age for each node and that the 95%

Page 13 of 19

confidence intervals largely overlap with the Pleistocene
(see Table 1), and thus should be treated with caution.
However, these estimates are in line with numerous
other studies that have identified pre-Pleistocene diversification in African TRFs, such as in Afromomum [55],
an estimated 60% of Begonia species [56] as well as in
several animal clades such as African birds [57] and
African clawed frogs species [58]. This was also
recorded for the genus Coccinia [49], although this
genus is not restricted to TRF. The Late Pliocene corresponds to a period of renewed rain forest re-expansion
which was preceded by a fairly long period of aridification and savanna expansion during the Late Miocene
[52]. In contrast, a recent temporal analysis of the herbaceous and mainly montane genus Impatiens suggested
an important role of Pleistocene refuges on the diversification of the genus [59]. Most of the studies that have
detected (some) Pleistocene diversification focused on
herbaceous plant clades (e.g. Impatiens and Begonia
[9,56,59]) which are known to have faster rates of molecular evolution when compared to woody taxa (e.g.
trees) [60] and or dispersal abilities. Intraspecific analyses of genetic diversity (phylogeography) of widespread
African tree (woody) species (including an African
Annonaceae species Greenwayodendron suaveolens [61])
suggest that Pleistocene refuges did have some effect
but mainly at the infra specific genetic structure level
only [61,62]. The small role of the Pleistocene in generating species was also suggested to be the case in Afromomum [55]. Even though Afromomum species are
herbs, individuals can live up to 10 years which could
imply lower molecular evolution [55] when compared to
other herbaceous taxa. The climatic variations of the
past 2.5 Ma might have been too quick to allow allopatric speciation with little ecological divergence to operate, especially on organisms with lower rates of
molecular evolution such as trees, something that is
supported by our data as well as in other studies [49].
Thus, the late Miocene and Pliocene epochs appear to
have played a significant role in diversification of African TRF trees possibly related to the longer phases of
unfavorable climatic conditions and isolation of populations allowing proper genetic isolation between them.
Conclusion

Although it is generally argued that ecology is never
truly absent from speciation [63], it is important to
understand to what extent it can influence species production over time. Our results imply that adaptation to
climatic differences between sister species have not been
a major driver of speciation in trees of African TRFs,
which is consistent with the geographical speciation
model of TRF diversification. Such a result would seem
to contrast with other patterns detected in non-TRF

Couvreur et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:296
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/296

plants. In the absence of other evidence, speciation in
the studied genera could possibly be the result of intricate pollination mechanisms. Indeed, both genera present strikingly different flower morphologies (Figure 1),
and intra generic variation is also important [28]. Unfortunately, to date, little information is available on African Annonaceae pollination biology [28,64], something
that should be further explored.

Methods
Divergence dates

For this analysis we used the chronogram of Couvreur
et al. [29] which included 14 out of 20 species of Isolona
and 13 out of 14 species of Monodora. The analysis was
based on five chloroplast markers and the tree was
dated under a relaxed clock model with uncorrelated
rates across lineages [see 29 for details]. A secondary
calibration point was used, with the crown node of Isolona and Monodora set to 14.9 Ma (95% highest posterior density (HPD) 9.4-21). A similar age (14.4 (95%
HPD 10.2-18.7) for this node was also found with a larger sampling of Annonaceae genera and with an
updated fossil calibration hypothesis [65].

shown to overestimate distribution ranges as large areas
are included even though there are no collections [68].
The buffer approach is suitable because the method is
based on the data point itself, however, the size of the
buffer can produce a bias. Different buffer sizes were
here investigated (2, 10 and 20 km), and we chose the
results of the 20 km buffer size as it best captures the
patchy nature of these species’ distributions at the spatial scale used in this study. All buffers were then
merged and the area within buffers was calculated for
each individual species. Basic overlay functions were
used to estimate the percentage of known geographic
range overlap for each sister species pair, where the
amount of buffered area overlapping between two species was divided by the total buffered area for the species with the smaller range following [25].
Using the 19 bioclim variables (Table 4) from http://
www.worldclim.org at 30 arc seconds resolution [69], a
set of climatic measurements that summarize temperature and precipitation dimensions of the environment,
values were extracted for each unique specimen locality
using the ‘Extract Values to Points’ tool in the Spatial
Analyst extension of ArcGIS v. 9.3. These values were
then used to visualize climatic variability for each species.

Locality data and geographical distribution

Locality data were compiled from Couvreur [28] and
represented over 1500 georeferenced herbarium specimens (see additional files 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for distribution maps of all species included in this study). All
localities were imported into ArcGIS v. 9.3 [66] and projected to an Albers projection with a World Geodetic
System 1984 datum. Uncertain georeferenced specimens
as well as specimens from identical localities for each
species were deleted from the database prior to analyses,
leaving a total of 335 unique occurrence localities for
Isolona and 737 for Monodora (Table S1).
An estimate of the known geographic range for each
species was produced in ArcGIS v 9.3 using a “buffer”
approach. This method creates a buffer radius around
each collection point for each species. Overlapping buffers for each species pair are then fused and the range
overlap is calculated. Several other approaches can be
used such as the “quadrat” [e.g. [67]]: the distribution of
species are broken down into “pixels” (for example onedegree grid cells) and overlap is calculated based on
how many pixels each species have in common; or via a
“minimum convex polygon” [68]: the distribution of the
species is represented by a polygon which contains all
data points with no angle larger than 180 degrees. However, both these approaches will be biased in a certain
way: in the former case two data points of two different
species could be very close together but be considered
as not overlapping as the points are in two opposing
corners of different pixels; in the later it has been

all 19 bioclim variables. Statistical tests between groups
have generally relied on AMOVA or MANOVA methods either between the principal components of the
PCA [27,48] or on the climatic variables directly [25].
However, these tests can only be undertaken if the
underlining assumptions of ANOVA are met: normal
distribution of the data and homogeneity of the variance. In our case, both the bioclim variables and the
PCA components violated those assumptions (One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejected the normality of
the data in all cases and Levene’s test rejected the equality of error variances in all cases (data not shown)).
Thus, statistical differences between sister species were
assessed using the non parametric Mann-Whitney U
test by comparing the principal components (PC1, PC2,
PC3) [27,48].
Niche modeling

Ecological niche modeling was used in order to summarize the climatic tolerances of the sampled species,
except for M. hastipetala (see below). Ecological niche
models were generated using the maximum entropy
method, Maxent version 3.3 [35]. This is a presenceonly method demonstrated to perform well when compared to similar approaches [37,70,71]. Maxent generates a continuous probability distribution of habitat
suitability for each input species. The software finds the
distribution that is closest to uniform, or of maximum
entropy, within the study area, and it does so subject to
the constraints imposed by variations in the environmental variables at the species’ occurrence localities
[35].
The study area used for niche analyses included Africa
and Madagascar and was confined to the known northern and southern extent of Isolona and Monodora
(below 12°51’N and above 28°7’S); latitudinal boundaries
which roughly coincide with limits of the suitable land
cover types for these species. The 19 bioclim layers and
an elevation layer (Table 3), downloaded from the
Worldclim data set, were used as environmental variables in the models [69]. For each species, a total of 100
replicates were run with random seed, which creates a
different random data partition (25% test, 75% training)
for each run. To choose presence data for each replicate,
bootstrapping allowing sampling with replacement was
used. For further analyses, the averaged Maxent output
from these 100 models was used. All models were run
under auto-features in logistic format [35], using a maximum of 500 interactions and regularization multiplier
of 1.0. The importance of individual environmental variables in explaining the distribution of each species modeled was determined by running jackknife tests within
the Maxent interface [35]. The area under the curve
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

Page 15 of 19

plot was employed to evaluate model performance [72].
AUC is a threshold-independent measure that quantifies
the ability of a model to distinguish presence data from
background data as compared to a random prediction.
AUC values range from 0 to 1, with 0.5 denoting a
model that is performing no better than random. Higher
AUC values indicate better performing models and
models with an AUC value over 0.7 are considered useful [73] but see [74].
Sister species comparisons: niche similarity tests

For all sister species pairs, we compared the Maxent
outputs using the software ENMtools [42] following the
methods described in [26,42]. For one species (Monodora hasitpetala), niche models we unable to be generated in Maxent due to the low number of unique
occurrence localities (4). Therefore, the known geographic range was used for niche similarity tests, rather
than the Maxent output. The software quantifies niche
similarity using two metrics: D [75], and I, a measure
derived from Hellinger distance. These metrics are calculated by comparing the estimated niche suitability
values from individual pixels in Maxent model outputs,
where those outputs have first been normalized such
that all predicted suitability values in the geographic
space sum to 1 [26]. Although both similarity measures
are calculated in a similar manner, they differ in how
the interpretation of the niche suitability values. The
results for both measures range from 0 (no niche overlap) to 1 (identical niches). In ENMtools, niche overlap
was calculated for each of the sister species pairs. Additionally, two randomization tests were run in ENMtools
to evaluate niche similarity and conservatism between
sister species only: niche identity and background similarity tests [26].
The niche identity test compares niche models generated with actual occurrence localities to pseudoreplicate
models generated with points randomly selected from a
pool of actual occurrence localities to determine if species pairs have equivalent niches. For the identity tests,
100 pseudoreplicates were created from the pooled
localities for each pair of sister species and D and I
values were calculated for each of the pseudoreplicate
models. The distribution of these similarity values was
then compared to the D and I values calculated from
the actual niche models for that species pair in the
niche overlap test. This method tests the null hypothesis
that the two species have equivalent ecological niches
and is expected to be met only if both species tolerate
exactly the same environmental conditions and have an
equivalent set of environmental condition available to
them [26].
The background similarity test compares differences in
the environmental background of species pairs (as

Couvreur et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:296
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/296

opposed to the actual occurrence localities) to determine if the two species are more or less similar than
expected by chance. For each species pair, the niche
model for the focal species is compared to a series of
pseudoreplicate models generated by randomly sampling
the ‘background’ (geographic range) of its sister species
[26]. In the context of the similarity test, the known
geographic range previously calculated for each of the
study species was defined as its background, and 100
pseudoreplicates were created for each species pair
tested. D and I values were calculated for each pseudoreplicate model and the distribution of these values was
compared to the niche overlap values calculated for the
actual data. This method tests the null hypothesis that
calculated niche overlap between two species is
explained by differences in their environmental background. The null hypothesis is rejected if the calculated
niche overlap falls outside the 95% confidence interval
for the distribution of pseudoreplicate model values.
Phylogenetic signal of bioclim variables

The phylogenetic signal (we prefer the term “phylogenetic signal” over “phylogenetic conservatism” as suggested by [20]) for each bioclim variable was tested on
both genera independently using two methods specifically designed for continuous characters: the quantitative convergence index (QVI) of Ackerly and Donoghue
[39] and the K of Blomberg et al. [40]. The QVI represents the inverse of the retention index for continuous
characters. When QVI = 0 similar species for a trait are
sister taxa, and when QVI = 1 similar species for that
trait are not closely related. The calculation of the QVI
was undertaken on 1000 randomly chosen posterior
trees and with 1000 randomizations of the tree tips
using the software program CACTUS 1.13 [76]. This
approach allows to take phylogenetic uncertainty into
account when calculating the QVI.
K is used to quantify the “amount of phylogenetic signal relative to the amount expected for a character
undergoing Brownian motion evolution along the specified topology and branch lengths” [[40], page 730]. This
statistic differs from the previous one as it tests the
degree of resemblance of the (continuous) variables
between sister species under an explicit null evolutionary model: the Brownian motion model [40]. The statistic varies from 0 to infinity, with K < 1 indicating low
phylogenetic dependence of the variable and K > 1 indicating high phylogenetic signal of the variable. When K
= 1, the variable exhibits the phylogenetic signal
expected under the Brownian motion model (e.g. the
null model). K was estimated for each of the 19 bioclim
variables using the multiPhylosignal command in the
picante (ver. 1.3) [77] R package and its significance was
assessed by 999 randomizations.

Phylogenetic signal of niche differentiation

We also tested for phylogenetic signal of niche differentiation by using an adaptation of the age-range correlation method of [47] in which niche similarity indices I
and D are viewed in function of time following [26]. I
and D values were estimated between all species pairs
for each genus. We used the R package phyloclim ver.
0.8.1 [78] to generate the correlation graphs. Phylogenetic signal was tested by Monte Carlo simulations to
randomize the I and D indices of each species in order
to estimate of the slope and intercept of the plots under
the null hypothesis of no phylogenetic signal [47] as
implemented in phyloclim. For each genus, a total of
1000 simulations were undertaken.
