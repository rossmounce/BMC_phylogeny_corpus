Abstract
Background: Many plasmid-harbouring strains of Lactococcus lactis have been isolated from milk and other
sources. Plasmids of Lactococcus have been shown to harbour antibiotic resistance genes and those that express
some important proteins. The generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status of L. lactis also makes it an attractive host
for the production of proteins that are beneficial in numerous applications such as the production of
biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical. In the present work, strains of L. lactis were isolated from cow’s milk, plasmids
were isolated and characterised and one of the strains was identified as a potential new lactococcal host for the
expression of heterologous proteins.
Results: Several bacterial strains were isolated from cow’s milk and eight of those were identified as Lactococcus
lactis by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Antibiotic susceptibility tests that were carried out showed that 50% of the
isolates had almost identical antibiotic resistance patterns compared to the control strains MG1363 and ATCC
11454. Plasmid profiling results indicated the lack of low molecular weight plasmids for strain M4. Competent L.
lactis M4 and MG1363 were prepared and electrotransformed with several lactococcal plasmids such as pMG36e,
pAR1411, pAJ01 and pMG36e-GFP. Plasmid isolation and RE analyses showed the presence of these plasmids in
both M4 and the control strain after several generations, indicating the ability of M4 to maintain heterologous
plasmids. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses also confirmed the presence of GFP, demonstrating the potential of
heterologous protein expression in M4.
Conclusions: Based on the 16S rRNA gene molecular analysis, eight Gram-positive cocci milk isolates were
identified as L. lactis subsp. lactis. One of the strains, L. lactis M4 was able to maintain transformed low molecular
weight plasmid vectors and expressed the GFP gene. This strain has the potential to be developed into a new
lactococcal host for the expression of heterologous proteins.

Background
Lactococcus lactis is a lactic acid bacterium possessing
the status of generally regarded as safe (GRAS). It is
usually used in the dairy and fermented food industry
since many decades. It has great potential application in
modern biotechnology, which can complement with its
long safe history in food fermentation as starter culture.
L. lactis is currently used as commercial starter cultures
in the production of most cultured dairy products and
is favourable due to their desirable properties such as

rapid acid production that contributes to specific flavours and subtle aromas of fermented food products [1].
Many research and development are being carried out
focusing on its applications in the production of biopharmaceuticals and drug delivery.
The genome of several Lactococcus strains have been
fully sequenced such as L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 [2],
L. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11 [3] and L. lactis subsp.
cremoris MG1363 [4]. The latter strain is by far the
most extensively studied bacterium and is widely used
as a model for LAB in a wide variety of biotechnological
applications. The availability of the full genome
sequence of L. lactis facilitates the success in annotating
complex metabolic pathways in other L. lactis strains.

examples of metabolic engineering of L. lactis for the
production of compounds such as diacetyl, alanine and
exopolysaccharides, which are important for food industry. These authors reviewed a number of elegant genetic
tools used to reroute carbon metabolism in L. lactis. On
top of that, this bacterium is proved to be an efficient
cell factory for the production of food ingredient [6],
nutraceuticals [7], heterologous proteins [8,9] and vaccine delivery [10,11].
Due to the efficiency of L. lactis as a cell factory, a
number of expression systems have been studied, developed and reviewed [12]. One of the most prominent lactococcal expression systems studied and discussed is the
nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system [12,13] which
is now commercially available. The system works through
a signal transduction which occur via two components
signal transduction machinery; membrane anchored sensor protein (NisK) and cytoplasmic response regulator
protein (NisR). Upon its interaction with nisin, NisK is
autophosphorylated and thus, resulting in phosphotransfer to NisR. When NisR is activated, the transcription of
the target genes cloned downstream of the nisin promoter P nisA , is activated [14]. This system allows tightly
regulated protein expression, not only in Lactococcus, but
also in other LAB such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus
and Bacillus [15,16]. A wide range of successful applications involving this system have been carried out and discussed [14,16,17]. The investigations to date also indicate
that different strains of the bacteria differ in their performance due to slight variations in their genetic make up.
A number of studies have been conducted to screen and
isolate new strains for enhanced performance or to discover novel properties. A host, which can harbour and
stably maintain the recombinant plasmids, or strains,
which lack certain proteases and thus help in reducing
the proteolytic activities and increase the stability of proteins [18], are of interest when studying these new isolates for their specific features. A great deal of interest
has also been shown to genetically modify these economically important organisms to improve their traits. Before
a new isolate could be used for these studies, the underlying information including its characteristics and genetic
make up should be first elucidated. This is important for
easier manipulation and control of the strains, as well as
fulfilling the requirement of legalisation for its use in
food industry.
In the present study, Gram-positive cocci previously
isolated from milk were screened for L. lactis. The isolates were then identified using 16S rRNA sequencing
and some of their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics evaluated. One of the isolates was tested for its ability to harbour and express heterologous plasmids and
protein, in order to gauge the potential of the strain to
be developed as an expression host.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture condition

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
listed in Table 1. The strains were from a previous
laboratory collection isolated from the milk of locally
bred cows. The milk was plated aseptically on M17 agar
[19] supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose (GM17) and
incubated at 30°C for one to two days until colonies
appeared. The colonies designated as M2, M4, M5, M6,
M11, M12, M14, M16, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 were
randomly selected for identification.
L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and L. lactis subsp.
lactis ATCC 11454 were used as positive controls for
the two subspecies of L. lactis. All the milk strains and
lactococcal controls were cultured in GM17 broth at 30°
C for 16 h as stand cultures. Escherichia coli TOP10
(Invitrogen) was grown at 37°C in Luria Bertani (LB)
broth with vigorous shaking at 200 rpm [20]. Ampicillin,
kanamycin and erythromycin were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively. E. coli recombinants were screened by the
addition of 0.004% (w/v) of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylb-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) while the L. lactis transformants were screened based on the antibiotic resistance selection marker.
PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene fragment

Genomic DNA was extracted using the method
described earlier [21]. The partial 16S rRNA gene of the
putative lactococcal strains was amplified from their
genomic DNA by PCR using primers as described previously [22] with some modifications. The fragment containing the variable regions V1 to V3 of the 16S rRNA
gene [23] was amplified using primers P1 (5’-GCG GCG
TGC CTA ATA CAT GC-3’; 41-60 [nucleotide number
according to the E. coli 16S rRNA gene]) and P4 (5’ATC TAC GCA TTT CAC CGC TAC-3’; 685-705) [22].
The PCR products were then run on 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO or pCRBlunt II-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen).
Transformation

Transformation of recombinant plasmids into E. coli
TOP10 strain was done using the heat shock method as
described previously [20] with minor modifications. Lactococcal plasmids pMG36e, pAR1411, pAJ01 and
pMG36e-GFP were transformed individually into L. lactis
M4 and MG1363 competent cells by electroporation [24].
Plasmid profiling

The plasmid profile was generated on agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was resolved by 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel and the image was captured after staining with
ethidium bromide and UV transillumination. The

Growth study

An overnight culture of L. lactis M4 harbouring
pMG36e was diluted (1:100) in GM17 broth. A volume
of 1 ml of inoculum was centrifuged to separate the pellets and resuspended with 1 ml of 1× PBS buffer. The
optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was determined using
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). A volume
of 100 μl of the culture was used for serial dilution and
the cells were spread on GM17 agar. This course was
repeated every hour. Growth curve for L. lactis M4 carrying pMG36e was constructed and the doubling time
was calculated.

as controls. The lactococcal strains were subcultured on
GM17 agar plate with sterile cotton swab and were
allowed to air-dry. The antibiotic discs (Oxoid) were
placed on the agar, four per plate and the cultures were
incubated at 30°C overnight and the diameter of the
inhibition zone surrounding the antibiotic discs was
measured. The test was carried out twice independently
and the average of the inhibition zone diameters was
calculated.

Plasmid stability test was carried out based on the
method described previously [27] with some modifications. Based on the data obtained from the growth
curve, the cells were maintained at exponential phase
for more than 100 generations. A volume of 100 μl of
overnight culture of L. lactis M4 harbouring pMG36e
was inoculated into 100 ml GM17 broth in the absence
of antibiotic. The cells were grown until the OD600 was
at upper log phase, and 100 μl of culture was inoculated
into fresh 100 ml GM17 broth. This routine was done
successively until the cells reached about 120 generations. The cells were then spread onto GM17 agar for
every 20 generations and incubated at 30°C for 16 h. A
total of 100 colonies were picked randomly and subcultured on GM17 agar supplemented with erythromycin.

The stability of the plasmid was determined based on
the ability of the colonies to grow on the agar in the
presence of the selective pressure.
Expression of heterologous protein

The plasmid pMG36e-GFP was used to investigate the
expression of the recombinant protein in L. lactis M4. A
717 bp DNA fragment encoding for GFP protein was
amplified using the primers FGFP (AGAGCTCCGATGAGTAAAGGCGA) and RGFP (CCAAGCTTTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCC) from plasmid BL21 (DE3)
pLysS pet 32b(+) GFP (obtained from Microbial Biotech
Laboratory, UPM) and digested with SacI and HindIII.
The purified fragment was then ligated to pMG36e
which was also digested with the same enzymes to obtain
the expression vector pMG36e-GFP. Approximately 2 μl
of ligation mixture was mixed with 40 μl of L. lactis competent cells and transferred using electroporation.
An overnight culture of L. lactis M4 harbouring
pMG36e-GFP was diluted (1:40) in GM17 medium supplemented with erythromycin, grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 and harvested for protein analysis.
Intracellular and cell-associated proteins were prepared
using the method described previously [28]. Samples were
run on 12% SDS-PAGE Tris/glycine gels and transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane by using the
semi-dry blotting method. Upon usage, the membrane
was equilibrated with methanol for few seconds. This was
followed by soaking the membrane and three pieces of
3MM Whatman paper in transfer buffer. The transfer of
proteins from the SDS-PAGE was accomplished by applying a constant current of 65 mA for at least 1 h depending
on the size of protein using Hofer transfer units. Next, the
membrane was incubated in 1% blocking solution for
overnight at 4°C without shaking. Incubation of the membrane with primary antibody (Anti-GFP Rabbit pAb; Calbiochem) 1:2000 diluted in 0.01% (v/v) Tris-Buffered
Saline Tween-20 (TBST) was carried out for 2 h at room
temperature with shaking. Following this, the membrane
was washed 4 times in 0.01% (v/v) TBST with shaking for
5 min each at room temperature. Secondary antibody
(Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Alkaline phosphatase; Calbiochem)
incubation was carried out for 2 h with shaking at room
temperature. The antibody used was at a dilution rate of
1:5000 in 0.01% (v/v) TBST. Subsequently, the membrane
was washed again as above. Finally, incubation in the
detection buffer consisting of 3-bromo-4-chloro-5-indolyl
phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) (Calbiochem) buffer was carried out with gentle agitation at
room temperature for 10-15 min. The progress of the
reaction was carefully monitored and when the bands with
desired intensity appeared, the membrane was quickly
rinsed with sterile water. Finally, the membrane was airdried and kept until further use.

Results
PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA
gene fragment

The partial 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified with
the primers P1 and P4 (Figure 1) and successfully
cloned and verified (Figure 2). These primers targeted
the conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene that flank
the variable regions V1 to V3 of the gene [23]. The 90
bp fragment of the V1 region contained sufficient
sequence variation to discriminate the species of the
genus Lactococcus while the V3 region contained sufficient sequence variation to differentiate the species of
Leuconostoc [22]. Others also reported that the region of
greatest heterogeneity occurs in approximately the first
500 bases of the 5’-end [29]. Therefore, the regions of
41-705 nt (E. coli numbering) [23] were targeted in this
study to identify the milk isolates, instead of the 1.5 kb
full length sequence of the gene.
Plasmid profiling

Two of the eight lactococcal strains studied gave plasmid profiles detectable with the method used (Figure 3).
These (M12 and M14) lactococcal strains contained several plasmids with various sizes, ranging from 1.6 kb to
~46 kb, and gave different banding patterns that can differentiate them. However, the plasmid extraction of the
other six strains was unsuccessful although repeated
several times. The plasmid-free strain MG1363 and the
nisin-producing strains ATCC 11454 were used as control for the plasmid extraction. The ATCC strain was
reported to carry plasmids with the size of 48.2, 44.1,
33.2, 29.4, 5.5 and 2.3 kb [25].
Antibiotic susceptibility test

The eight lactococcal strains were used for further characterisation studies. Table 3 shows the diameters of the
inhibition zone of the antibiotic discs. All of the lactococcal strains exhibited antibiotic susceptibility pattern

plasmid. Based on the plasmid bands extracted from L.
lactis M4 transformants (Figure 5), it was confirmed
that this strain can carry and replicate the plasmids
without any indication of possible incompatibility. All
plasmids isolated from transformed L. lactis M4 cells
were shown to have the same sizes as the plasmids isolated from the transformed L. lactis MG1363 cells. GFP
gene which was cloned into pMG36e was able to be
retrieved from digested recombinant plasmid pMG36eGFP (Figure 6).

similar to that of L. lactis MG1363 and ATCC 11454.
However, some of the strains showed slight differences.
Strains M2, M4, M11 and M16 were more resistant to
tetracycline (10 μg) and oxytetracycline (30 μg) compared to others.
Verification of L. lactis transformants

Total DNA isolation of L. lactis M4 showed that the
strain was devoid of low molecular weight plasmid
(Figure 4). The strain was transformed with several lactococcal plasmids to investigate its ability to carry

of plasmids from ATCC 11454 are depicted.

Based on the growth curve (Figure 7), the doubling time
of L. lactis M4 carrying pMG36e was found to be 35
min. The doubling time was used to calculate the
amount of time needed for the transformant to reach
their 100th generations. The stability of the transformed
pMG36e in L. lactis M4 is crucial to ensure that the
plasmid can be maintained in the strain. In this work,
all of the 100 colonies were able to grow on the medium
containing erythromycin, suggesting that the plasmid is
100% stable in L. lactis M4.
Expression of heterologous protein

RE digestion was carried out to confirm the presence of
inserts (GFP) by comparing the size differences of the
linearised plasmid. Both verifications based on PCR
method and double digestion of the recombinant plasmids showed the existence of inserted DNA fragments
(Figure 5-bottom). The ability of L. lactis M4 and
MG1363 to express the recombinant protein GFP was
confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with the
presence of a ~27 kDa protein band (Figure 8) (data not
shown for the expression of protein in L. lactis
MG1363).

Discussion
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis is now widely used
as a genetic identification method for bacteria [29]. It
is more reliable than the conventional phenotypic
method of bacterial identification, which can differentiate even to the species or subspecies level [22,30]. The
16S rRNA gene sequences of the milk strains were
compared to the databases available in National Center
for Biotechnology Information [NCBI, 31] and Ribosomal Database Project-II [RDP-II, 32] sites. NCBI site
hosts and allows access to the general sequence data
banks, such as GenBank, European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL) and DNA Data Bank of Japan
(DDBJ). However, RDP-II was designed to contain
rRNA sequences and provide related services such as
sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building for
bacterial identification [33]. Some species within a
genus may share identical 16S rRNA gene sequences,

for instance, Mycobacterium bovis and M. tuberculosis
[34], therefore 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of
these bacteria may provide limited usage. However,
these problems could be solved by polyphasic approach
which examines more than one structural gene
sequences [29].

The results of this study showed that eight of the 14
milk strains randomly selected from the laboratory collection were identified as L. lactis subsp. lactis, while
the other six strains were found with high sequence
similarity with Enterococcus species. The 16S rRNA
gene sequence analysis (Table 4) showed that only 57%

of the randomly selected isolates belonged to the genus
Lactococcus while the remaining were Enterococcus. On
the other hand, L. lactis subsp. cremoris had not been
detected in this study. This is not surprising as these
microbes are infrequently isolated from raw milk [35].

This was also in accordance with reports that the subsp.
lactis were more prevalent than cremoris in the dairy
environment [36]. This may be due to the fact that
subsp. cremoris occurred in a very small number
naturally.
L. lactis was reported to carry multiple plasmids naturally [37]. These plasmids are important for their

survival in the natural environment. The dairy lactococci
were expected to harbour various plasmids, with different sizes and functions. The plasmid profile of the
strains could serve as a typing method to discriminate
them [38], and as a source for studying new plasmids.
Out of the eight strains of L. lactis isolated in this study,
only two of them were able to give plasmid profile.
Other isolates may contain excessive metabolites such
as polysaccharides which retard the extraction method.
Extraction method which targeted this type of problem
should be tried. Up to nine DNA bands were detected
from the plasmid extraction. However, the actual number of plasmids present in the two strains were not elucidated as plasmids may appear in different
conformations, such as supercoiled, open circular or linear in the agarose gel analysis. The supercoiled form is
normally the most abundant. In addition, some large
plasmids may have low copy number. Therefore, they
may be difficult to be detected through agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Recently, the role of non-pathogenic bacteria in the
spread of antibiotic resistance genes, has caused grave
concern and is being widely investigated [39,40]. These
bacteria have been shown to act as reservoirs for the
resistance genes with the potential to transmit them to
other microbes. Therefore, in addition to genotypic
characterisation, the phenotypic features such as antibiotic resistance of the lactococcal strains were also
analysed.
In this study, we report that the strains of L. lactis were
resistant to antibiotics from the groups of aminoglycosides, coumarin-glycosides and quinolones tested, in
addition to the peptide group of polymycin B. These
strains were sensitive to the peptide group of bacitracin
and macrolides tested. The susceptibilities to b-lactams
and phenicole group of antibiotics were in the intermediate range. The resistance of the strains isolated in this
study towards aminoglycosides was in agreement with
the observation described previously [41]. These antibiotics are not taken up effectively by the bacteria due to
their nonoxidative metabolism [42]. 26 strains of L. lactis
subsp. cremoris and subsp. lactis were previously
reported to be resistant to trimethoporim and sulfathiazole, and the resistance against gentamicin, kanamycin,
lincomycin, neomycin, nisin, rifampin and streptomycin
varied [41]. Resistance towards tetracyclines varied
among the strains isolated in this study, which may due
to the acquisition of resistance genes. The results were
consistent with the work carried out previously [43],
where L. lactis was reported to be strongly inhibited by
bacitracin but mildly affected by streptomycin. Recently,
Flórez et al. [44] reported the isolation of several strains
of L. lactis with high resistance to tetracycline but not to
other types of antibiotics.

L. lactis M4 exhibited an interesting profile where
there was no indication of the presence of low molecular weight plasmids in the total DNA extraction of this
strain (Figure 4). When transformed with other lactococcal plasmids, the strain was able to carry them without any signs of incompatibility.
Plasmid incompatibility may become an obstacle in the
development of bacterial expression hosts. It can occur
when two plasmids failed to be maintained in the same
cells [45]. Therefore, the strain M4 was investigated for
its ability to carry several lactococcal plasmids in order to
check for any incompatibility with low molecular weight
plasmids undetected by the plasmid isolation method
used in this study. However, incompatibility was not
observed as the plasmids were successfully retrieved from
the cells (Figure 5).
Several factors have been reported to cause plasmid
instability in bacteria including defects in a set of plasmid-coded regulatory elements that regulate replication
and partitioning and ineffective synchrony with certain
host functions [46,47]. Plasmid instability prevents or
decreases the production of desired recombinant proteins carried by some engineered strains, despite their
ability to secrete out the proteins to the medium. For
example, the use of Bacillus subtilis in producing the
recombinant proteins has become less favourable
because of this [48]. Therefore, the strain M4 was transformed with pMG36e and plasmid stability test was carried out to ensure the ability of the cells to harbour and
maintain the plasmid. Based on the growth profile, the
cells took about ~60 h to reach 100 generations.
Recently, both incubation time and temperature were
reported to have substantial effects on plasmid loss [49].
The researchers found that the incubation time had the
most extreme effect on the stability of low molecular
weight plasmids in Lactococcus cells where plasmid loss
was observed after 72 h of cultivation while temperatures in the range of 15-40°C also stimulated plasmid
instability. Nevertheless, the plasmid pMG36e was found
to be 100% stable in L. lactis M4 where all of the 100
colonies were able to grow on the medium containing
erythromycin even after 120 generations or ~72 h of
cultivation.
There is a need to develop suitable microbial hosts for
the expression of many important proteins. The current
work is important in identifying L. lactis M4 as an
expression host. Lactic acid bacteria expressing heterologous proteins have been used in the food industry, pharmaceutical and as vaccine delivery. Since they have
smaller genome size, do not produce endotoxins, have
very low amounts of native exoproteins and are of
GRAS status, Lactococcus has several advantages over E.
coli and also Bacillus sp as a producer of bioactive
molecules. Therefore, the ability of the L. lactis M4 to

Noreen et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:28
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/28

maintain and express the heterologous protein GFP suggest that this strain is potentially ideal to be further
characterised and developed as an expression host.

Conclusions
Our results show that eight Lactococcus lactis milk
strains were successfully isolated, characterised and were
resistant to antibiotics from the groups of aminoglycosides, coumarin-glycosides and quinolones tested, in
addition to the peptide group of polymycin B. These
strains were also sensitive to the peptide group of bacitracin and macrolides tested. The ability to maintain
transformed low molecular weight plasmids and the successful expression of GFP in L. lactis M4 indicates that
it could be potentially developed as a new lactococcal
host for expression of heterologous proteins. Further
studies on the characterisation of this strain M4 is
needed as this bacterium may carry novel properties
that might be useful for various applications beneficial
for human use.
