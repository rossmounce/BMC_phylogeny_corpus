Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNA molecules that are specified by their
mode of action, the structure of primary transcripts, and their typical size of 20–24 nucleotides.
Frequently, not only single miRNAs but whole families of closely related miRNAs have been found
in animals and plants. Some families are widely conserved among different plant taxa. Hence, it is
evident that these conserved miRNAs are of ancient origin and indicate essential functions that
have been preserved over long evolutionary time scales. In contrast, other miRNAs seem to be
species-specific and consequently must possess very distinct functions. Thus, the analysis of an
early-branching species provides a window into the early evolution of fundamental regulatory
processes in plants.
Results: Based on a combined experimental-computational approach, we report on the
identification of 48 novel miRNAs and their putative targets in the moss Physcomitrella patens. From
these, 18 miRNAs and two targets were verified in independent experiments. As a result of our
study, the number of known miRNAs in Physcomitrella has been raised to 78. Functional assignments
to mRNAs targeted by these miRNAs revealed a bias towards genes that are involved in regulation,
cell wall biosynthesis and defense. Eight miRNAs were detected with different expression in
protonema and gametophore tissue. The miRNAs 1–50 and 2–51 are located on a shared
precursor that are separated by only one nucleotide and become processed in a tissue-specific way.
Conclusion: Our data provide evidence for a surprisingly diverse and complex miRNA population
in Physcomitrella. Thus, the number and function of miRNAs must have significantly expanded during
the evolution of early land plants. As we have described here within, the coupled maturation of two
miRNAs from a shared precursor has not been previously identified in plants.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly specific regulators of
gene expression. Their target mRNAs become recognized

through short stretches of partial complementarity [1].
Upon binding, the mRNA is either cleaved at a distinct site
of the miRNA-mRNA duplex or its translation becomes

inhibited [1-3]. This phenomenon, which is known as
posttranscriptional gene silencing, was first identified in
C. elegans [4], but was soon shown to be a regulatory
mechanism in plants and animals. MiRNA precursors possess a very characteristic secondary structure. This structure consists of a terminal hairpin loop and a long stem
[1,3,5] in which the miRNA is positioned [6-8]. The investigation of miRNA biogenesis pathways revealed components that are common to plants and animals, but
considerable divergence also exists [9-12]. Their genes are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II [13-15], occasionally in
the form of di- or even polycistronic primary transcripts
[7,16-18]. The maturation of miRNA primary transcripts
(pri-miRNAs) differs in plants and animals. In animals,
the pri-miRNAs are processed in the nucleus by the microprocessor complex containing the enzyme Drosha and its
cofactor, the protein DGCR8 (in humans), or Pasha (in
Drosophila and C. elegans) [19-21]. As a result, ~60–70 nt
miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) are released, which are
then exported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear transport
receptor exportin-5 [22]. The final maturation step is
mediated in the cytosol by Dicer, resulting in a complex
between the ~22 nt miRNA and its complementary fragment, miRNA* [23,24]. In plants, homologs of Drosha or
its cofactors could not be identified. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis the Dicer-like protein 1 is a nuclear protein suggesting that maturation of miRNAs in plants occurs in the
nucleus. HASTY is the most likely candidate for a plant
homolog of the nuclear transport receptor exportin-5
[25]. However, additional miRNA export mechanisms
may exist in plants as hasty mutants showed a decreased
accumulation of some, but not all miRNAs [25].
Several studies have addressed the composition of the
miRNA pool in plants and animals. These studies have
been accomplished through shot-gun sequencing of
cDNAs obtained from size-fractionated RNA samples,
computational prediction from genomic data, or a combination of both [26]. Exploiting their typical stem-loop
structure, a large number of computational precursor predictions have been performed [1,27-34]. Recently, a new
algorithm was developed to predict miRNAs and their
genes based on sequence conservation. This algorithm
was successfully used for the prediction of miRNA families conserved among different plant species [35]. These
reports support that, like in animals, particular miRNA
families are conserved across all major plant lineages and
frequently control the expression of mRNAs encoding
proteins of the same family [36-38]. Thus, regulatory
effects mediated through such miRNAs are likely to be
conserved throughout the plant radiation and must have
originated anciently. However, it was also demonstrated
that certain miRNAs are species-specific [18]. Thus, without the identification of all the miRNAs present in plants
at key phylogenetic positions, the evolutionary dynamics

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/13

of plant miRNAs and their biological functions will not be
understood. Similar studies of this type in the animal field
suggested the expansion of specific miRNA sets during key
transitions in animal evolution [39]. An important evolutionary transition in the plant kingdom occurred when
they began life on land. Plants very similar to the first photosynthetic organisms which successfully colonized the
land approximately 450 million years ago [40], the Bryophytes (mosses), still exist today. Compared to animal
evolution, this time would relate to the evolutionary distance between fish and mammals. However, the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle in plants
required far more adaptations than in the mammals-fish
example. This transition would have been less complicated for mammals-fish since all major vertebrate cell
types and organs were already present in fish. On the contrary, the evolution from green algae towards land plants
required the invention of almost all plant organs that are
typical for a land-bound lifestyle. The rapid development
of many new cell types, organs and adaptations that
occurred during early evolution of mosses must have been
coupled to an explosive diversification of old genes and
the development of new genes [41-43]. It is reasonable to
assume that this genetic diversification was paralleled by
an equally rapid amplification of new regulatory mechanisms, including miRNAs [44]. Indeed, not a single
miRNA has been found so far in genome projects targeting
green algae, the immediate evolutionary precursors of
land plants [45]. Only few reports have dealt with the
analysis of moss miRNAs so far [18,36,37]. Analyzing EST
sequences from a large number of plant species, including
the moss Physcomitrella patens, Zhang et al. [18] identified
two conserved miRNAs. The most comprehensive miRNA
analysis in Physcomitrella so far identified 30 individual
miRNAs by cloning. Eleven of these 30 miRNAs belong to
four conserved plant miRNA families, whereas the
remaining 19 miRNAs had not been previously identified
in other plants [17,46]. Recently, large scale pyrosequencing suggested the presence of a larger number of miRNAs
in Physcomitrella but these were not further characterized
[47]. Thus, the knowledge on moss miRNAs is restricted
to a small number of studies so far, but these have clearly
indicated that some miRNAs evolved in this group before
the diversification of land plants.
Until now, a genome-wide analysis of miRNAs was
impossible due to the lack of comprehensive genomic
sequence information for any moss species. Physcomitrella
patens has become a valuable model species based on its
unique ability to integrate DNA into its nuclear genome
by homologous recombination, thereby enabling rapid
functional analyses by reverse genetics [48,49]. To further
extend its use as a model organism, a genome project has
been recently launched. The Physcomitrella genome represents the fourth fully sequenced land plant genome in

addition to those of Arabidopsis, rice and poplar and it is
the first one of a non-seed plant. The genome assembly is
still underway; however, the WGS traces have been made
publicly available.
Here, we report the identification of 48 novel Physcomitrella microRNAs through a combined experimentalcomputational approach. In the computational section
we scanned the genomic traces as well as the most comprehensive Physcomitrella EST databases [41,42,50] for
their precursors and identified 59 potential target mRNAs.
The majority of these mRNAs encode several transcription
factors, cyclophilins, redox catalysts, enzymes involved in
producing the complex cell wall polysaccharides on the
plant surface, or other proteins involved in signal transduction processes, such as heterotrimeric G proteins, histidine kinases or factors for alternative splicing. Thus, the
functional annotation of target genes revealed a bias
towards regulation, signal transduction, cell wall biosynthesis and defense.
We observed the tissue-specific maturation of one miRNA
from a precursor also containing another miRNA, a situation not found in plants so far. A comparison of the Physcomitrella miRNA families to those of other plants
increased the number of miRNA families with a common
ancient origin to 17 and identified 18 moss-specific
miRNA families. The data indicate an explosion of miRNA
diversity and functional diversification which occurred at
a key evolutionary transition early in land plant evolution.

Results
Cloning of miRNAs from Physcomitrella patens
It has been reported that the expression of plant miRNAs
may be regulated in a tissue-specific manner [9,51]. Therefore, RNA was prepared from the juvenile Physcomitrella
protonema as well as the leafy gametophores [52] to cover
these two different developmental stages. The fraction of
small RNAs of ~15 to 35 nt were cloned, and 480 randomly chosen cDNA clones were sequenced. Sequences
shorter than 16 nt were removed from the initial set, leaving 290 sRNAs for further analysis. These sequences were
subjected to serial filtering steps (Figure 1) to remove contaminating sequences. BLAST searches in the Genbank
and Rfam databases indicated that 138 sequences (47%)
had originated from rRNAs, tRNAs and chloroplast RNAs.
These sequences were excluded, resulting in a final set of
152 sRNA sequences for further analysis [see Additional
file 1]. 106 sequences (70%) ranged between 19 and 25 nt
in size, and among these, the majority had a size of 21 nt
(Figure 2). Thus, the size distribution of the cloned sRNAs
is in agreement with most known plant miRNAs [46].
Only nine sRNA sequences were obtained more than once
[see Additional file 1], indicating both a low redundancy

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/13

of the generated sRNA library as well as a surprisingly high
diversity of the original RNA population. The set of 152
non redundant sequences was compared to the Rfam
database (version 8.1) to identify already known miRNAs
from Physcomitrella and other plant species. Six different
miRNAs, 2–86, 4–34, 2–31, 2–88, 3–60, and 5–33, were
identical to the previously described Physcomitrella miRNAs miR1218, miR1212, miR535, miR156, miR536, and
miR537, respectively [17,46]. Five sRNAs showed significant similarity to known plant miRNAs and most likely
represent additional members of these miRNA families
(Figure 3). These sRNAs (4–67, 2–15, 3–40, 3–54) belong
to miRNA families miR536, miR535, miR156 and
miR319 previously identified in Physcomitrella [17,46],
whereas the sRNA 4–72 was nearly identical to miR171
present in several other plant species [53]. Thus, among
our final set of 152 sRNAs we found only ten miRNAs that
were identical or highly similar to one of the 30 previously
detected Physcomitrella miRNAs. This fact confirms that a
surprisingly diverse and complex miRNA population
exists in moss. Intriguingly, we also identified two sRNAs,
3–79 and 3–44, which resemble the nearly identical
reverse complementary sequences of the known miRNAs
miR160 and miR477 [31] (Figure 3).
Identification of stem-loop precursors of cloned sRNAs
One essential feature of transcripts originating from
miRNA-coding genes is their characteristic stem-loop
structure. For the further characterization of the cloned
sRNAs, we searched for putative miRNA precursors within
the genomic trace file archive and EST databases. All
sequences containing an sRNA-identical nucleotide pattern were clustered to generate a non-redundant set of
putative precursors (compare Figure 1). Furthermore,
jointly clustered genomic and EST sequences with identity
to the same sRNA were aligned with each other to reveal if
the EST sequence represented the transcript of the respective genomic region. For 67 cloned sRNAs, at least one
sequence was identified in the genomic traces and/or in
the EST database with a perfect sequence match. Within
this set, we identified 22 EST sequences and 21 out of
these were found to be identical to genomic sequences.
These data suggest that they are the unprocessed transcripts of these genomic regions. All clustered sequences
were subjected to a precursor analysis based on secondary
structure. The structure prediction revealed that 33
sequences encoding 25 of the cloned sRNAs were able to
form a hairpin-like structure (Table 1) [see Additional file
2]. In one case (2–70), a putative precursor sequence was
only found in the EST database. The identification of these
RNAs by cloning, together with the existence of corresponding precursor sequences, suggests that these sRNAs
are, in fact, miRNAs from Physcomitrella. For five sRNA
sequences (2–15, 3–40, 3–44, 3–54, 3–79), no precursors
were found whereas their sequences showed significant

similarity to plant miRNA families present in Rfam (Figure 3). Therefore, we considered these sequences to be
miRNAs as well. The failure to detect identical sequences
in the genomic or EST databases could be due to their
unfinished status or insufficient coverage. Taken together,
the cloning approach led to the identification of 31 miRNAs among the 152 non-redundant sRNAs. Even by the
most conservative criteria, 25 miRNAs have not been previously identified in Physcomitrella. Among these, 17
cloned miRNAs seem to be species-specific for Physcomitrella whereas the remaining eight miRNAs most
likely represent new members of conserved plant miRNA
families (Table 1). Seven miRNAs (1–63, 2–31, 2–88, 3–
60, 5–21, 4–66, 4–72) might be derived from more than
one genomic locus as two to three genomic sequence clusters fulfilled the structural requirements of miRNA precursors. In contrast, 18 miRNAs (Table 1) could derive from
single copy genes as only one genomic sequence cluster
was found for each of these miRNAs. However, this calculation might be an underestimation considering the
unfinished character of the Physcomitrella genome
sequence.

In regards to the maturation pathways of miRNAs, the
prediction of genomic precursors revealed some interesting aspects of the miRNAs within this study. The two miRNAs 1–50 and 2–51 are located side by side within the 5'
arm of the predicted precursor, and separated by only one
nucleotide. Thus, they are very likely processed from a
common precursor transcript. miRNAs 1–63 and 3–14
exhibit nearly completely reverse complementarity to
each other and are possibly derived from the same precursor [see Additional file 2]. Thus, they might be a pair of
miRNA and miRNA*. However, for miRNA 1–63 another,
specific precursor was identified [see Additional file 2].
Prediction of miRNA homologs in Physcomitrella
Genomic trace files and EST sequences from Physcomitrella
were examined for all plant miRNAs present in miRBase
(version 8.1) using microHARVESTER [35]. The identified
genomic, as well as EST sequences, which were able to
form stable hairpin-like structures were further analyzed
manually. In total, a redundant set of 123 possible miRNA
precursor sequences was generated by microHARVESTER.

sors, all genomic and EST precursor sequences were
merged, clustered and further analyzed with RNAshapes
[54], applying the same parameters which were previously
used for the cloned sRNAs. This analysis revealed 31
sequences producing stable hairpin-like precursor structures encoding 29 individual miRNAs which were
assigned to 19 plant miRNA families (Table 2) [see Additional file 2]. Five of these miRNAs were previously
described in Physcomitrella [17,46], whereas the remaining
24 miRNAs are new for Physcomitrella but share high similarities to miRNAs from other plants. Two miRNAs
(miR390-2, miR477) seem to have more than one precursor in the genomic or EST sequences set (Table 2) [see
Additional file 2].

The Physcomitrella miRNA sequences obtained by cloning
and bioinformatic prediction were deposited in miRBase
[55] [see Additional file 3].
Detection of Physcomitrella miRNAs by small RNA gel
blots
To obtain genuine proof for the presence of miRNAs
which were identified by cloning or computational analysis, a set of 29 miRNAs (20 from cloning, 9 from prediction) was chosen for expression analysis by small RNA gel
blots. As the cloned miRNAs were derived from protonema and gametophores, total RNA from these tissues
was used for RNA gel blot preparation. Among the
selected miRNAs, we chose four putative miRNAs for

a Identified previously in Physcomitrella [17, 46]. * Identical to a miRNA in other plant species. ath: Arabidopsis thaliana, gma: Glycine max, mtr:

which no possible precursors had been identified in the
genomic traces and EST sequences, but which show high
similarity to known miRNAs. Twelve miRNAs which were
identified by the cloning approach and six miRNAs which
were computationally predicted were detected by gel blot
hybridization (Figure 4, Tables 1 and 2). No signals were
found for the remaining 11 miRNAs, probably a consequence of their low expression level. Yet, these sRNAs are
still considered to be miRNAs. We conclude this since
stem-loop containing precursors were predicted, the characteristic diagnostic feature for this class of sRNAs, and
because 8 of these 11 miRNAs (1–22, 1–39, 3–5, 3–62, 3–
91, 4–12, 2–70, 3–79) had been found by cloning. Ten
miRNAs (1–63, 5–21, miR473, 1–50, 2–28, 3–14,
miR419, 3–54, 3–44, 3–44 antisense) were detected in
both protonema and gametophore tissue in nearly equivalent amounts. Interestingly, the miRNA 1–63 and its
nearly identical reverse complement counterpart 3–14,
were both detected with high abundance. These data indicate that these are bona fide miRNAs rather than representing miRNA/miRNA* (see above). The cloned sRNA 3–44
was nearly an identical reverse complement sequence of
the previously published miR477. However, 3–44 is 24 nt

in size whereas miR477 has a length of 21 nt [31]. Hybridization with strand-specific probes revealed that 3–44, as
well as its complementary RNA (3–44-antisense), accumulated in almost equal amounts in both protonema and
gametophore tissue, both with an identical length of 24
nt. Thus, these two RNAs possibly constitute a case of coaccumulating miRNA/miRNA*. Moreover, we also
detected the 21 nt miR477 in our expression studies
revealing the existence of highly similar miRNAs which
only vary in size.
Tissue-specific expression of miRNAs
Three miRNAs (miR414, 4–72, 4–66) were exclusively
expressed in protonema, whereas another three miRNAs
(miR395, miR408, 2-1) were detected only in gametophores, thereby indicating tissue-specific expression of
these miRNAs.

The precursor prediction suggested that miRNAs 1–50
and 2–51 are transcribed in a shared precursor, separated
only by one nucleotide from each other. The expression
analysis verified the existence of both miRNAs, but their
level and the maturation from the shared precursor var-

ied. MiRNA 1–50 was present in protonema and gametophores, whereas the mature miRNA 2–51 only
accumulated in protonema tissue. For miRNA 2–51, however, a signal for a larger RNA molecule of approximately
60 nt was also detected in gametophores. We assume that
this larger RNA fragment represents an incompletely processed precursor transcript. Thus, processing of the two
miRNAs 1–50 and 2–51 originating from the same precursor is different in the two analyzed moss tissues.
Intriguingly, the two miRNAs 1–50 and 2–51 have no
homologs in mirBase and are thus considered to be mossspecific. Another case was observed for miR477 (Figure
4), where the mature miRNA was present in protonema
and an incompletely processed larger precursor was identified in RNA derived from gametophores.
Detection of homologs of cloned miRNAs from
Physcomitrella in other plant species
All Physcomitrella miRNAs predicted by micoHarvester
exist in other plants as well, since that algorithm solely
finds homologs to already known miRNAs. However, up
to 17 out of the total of 29 cloned miRNAs could be species-specific as these do not have close homologs in miRBase (version 8.1). This number could be misleading since
the database might not be complete. Therefore, an independent screen was implemented in which these speciesspecific miRNAs were used as query sequences to identify
possible homologs in the completely sequenced genomes
of Arabidopsis, poplar and rice directly using microHARVESTER. For one miRNA, 4–12, a homolog in rice harboring a characteristic stem-loop structure was predicted [see
Additional file 4]. Thus, the rice homolog of miRNA 4–12
might have been overlooked in previous analyses and
consequently, the miRNA 4–12 was not further regarded
as moss-specific.
Comparison of plant miRNAs
Including the results presented here, the number of
known Physcomitrella homologs to plant miRNA families
has been raised from 4 to 17. The direct comparison of
miRNA families which are shared by at least by two different plant species allows new insights into the evolution of
plant miRNAs. In order to generate the most comprehensive overview, all plant miRNAs in miRBase were compared with each other and with all Physcomitrella miRNAs
described here or before [see Additional file 5]. This analysis revealed the existence of 35 plant miRNA families
shared by at least two plant species. Eighteen miRNA families seem to be absent in Physcomitrella although they are
common to most other plant species. For comparison, 24
families have not yet been found in Glycine maximum,
whereas only three are absent from Arabidopsis. These
observations indicate that these numbers are heavily
influenced by the sampling depth in the different plants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/13

However, even if interpreted with great caution, the
miRNA families 169 and 399 contain numerous individual members in other plants, but seem to be missing in
Physcomitrella altogether. Thus, these families might have
originated after the divergence between those plant lineages and mosses. Physcomitrella is underrepresented in
some miRNA families, where several members were identified in other plant species, but only one member was
found in Physcomitrella (e.g. miRNA families 166, 167,
172, 395). Therefore, these families may constitute examples for miRNAs with a common ancient origin followed
by amplification in higher plants. In contrast, Physcomitrella contains more individual miRNA members in
the families 477, 535, 390 and 319. Thus, these miRNA
families either have expanded in the moss or their size was
reduced during land plant evolution.
During this analysis, we also analyzed the gene copy
number for particular miRNAs. Apparently, the majority
of Physcomitrella miRNAs are encoded by single genes,
whereas the identical miRNA in other species is often
encoded by more than one gene [see Additional file 5].
Thus, the gene copy number per miRNA has increased
during land plant evolution.
Target prediction
The high complementarity between plant miRNAs and
their target genes allows an effective prediction of the target sequences through computational analysis [56-60].
Here, all identified 59 miRNAs, including those previously reported, were used to search the Physcomitrella EST
database with RNAhybrid [61] for complementary hits. In
this analysis we used the parameters developed by Schwab
et al. [60] for identifying authentic miRNA targets in
plants. This analysis yielded 59 potential target genes for
30 individual miRNAs (Table 3) [see Additional file 6].
The number of targets per miRNA varies widely, from 1 to
12. For 16 out of the 30 miRNAs one target was predicted
and seven miRNAs target two mRNAs. The miRNAs 1–63,
miR473-2, miR160-2, miR160-3, each target three
mRNAs, whereas miR408, miR477, and miR414 have 5,
7, and 12 predicted targets, respectively (Table 3). We
have validated the targets T2_miR477 homologous to a
CONSTANS-like transcription factor and T_5_33 homologous to a protein of unknown function by RNA ligasemediated 5' RACE-PCR. The obtained fragments end at
the expected sites between nucleotide position 10 and 11
within the miRNA binding site. These data clearly indicate
that both mRNAs are in fact targets of miRNAs 477 and 5–
33, respectively (Figure 5).

Some of the miRNAs which belong to the same miRNA
family most likely regulate the identical target genes, suggesting a functional redundancy of these miRNAs (e.g.
160-1, 160-2, 160-3, 160-4). In contrast, for other miRNA

families (171, 319, 533, 534) specific target genes were
predicted for the individual family members, indicating a
high specificity of the miRNA/target interaction even
though the miRNA sequence has been highly conserved
within the respective miRNA family. For two miRNAs
which belong to different miRNA families (miR473-1 and
miR477), one shared target mRNA was identified, indicating that these two different miRNAs regulate the same
mRNA. Intriguingly, both miRNAs target the same mRNA
region with one nucleotide offset. As suggested for Arabidopsis, these miRNAs may have evolved by duplication of
target sequences [62,63].
Members of the miRNA160 family control the expression
of an auxin response factor homolog in Physcomitrella as
well as in other plant species [37]. Furthermore, miR166
was predicted to target a class III homeodomain leucinezipper transcription factor. This prediction is in accordance with previous reports on the miRNA166 familymediated regulation of this class of transcription factors in
all lineages of land plants [36]. Additionally, the identified Physcomitrella miR408 and miR477 seem to control
conserved target genes previously predicted in Populus trichocarpa [59,64].

In fact, the individual analysis revealed a strong bias
among the predicted target mRNAs (Table 3). A large
number (21) of predicted targets are involved in regulation, e.g. transcription factors or signal transduction proteins. The second largest group (19) of targets consists of
mRNAs without a known function or for which no reasonable homologs exist in the public databases. Interestingly, twelve targets can be related to adaptations to life
on land, such as the formation of cell wall and defense (3
and 9 targets, respectively). One example is the target T_139 of miRNA 1–39 coding for a mucin-like protein as its
closest homolog. Mucins carry a dense sugar coating
which provides considerable water-holding capacity and
also makes them resistant to proteolysis. Of the remaining
targets, eight are metabolism-associated. Among these,
two mRNAs encode proteins involved in sulfur metabolism. Physcomitrella uses more diverse routes of sulfate
assimilation than angiosperms [65], thus a need for their
specific regulation through miRNAs is likely. Another
notable target is T_5-21 which is related to 2S albumin, a
plant seed protein, which might accumulate in a homologous fashion solely in moss spores and thus needs to be
down-regulated in all other tissues. For some predicted
targets, e.g. cyclophilins and F-Box proteins, it is known or

Page 13 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:13

at least predicted that their homologues in other plants or
even in vertebrates underlie miRNA regulation as well (see
Table 3 for comments). These targets have no direct
sequence similarity to Physcomitrella, indicating their independent origin through convergent evolution, or too large
divergence accumulated over long evolutionary time
scales.
These findings, and the conservation of miRNA/targetpairs described before, provide further evidence that particular miRNAs and their corresponding targets must have
evolved early in land plant evolution and were then conserved widely throughout the plant radiation.

Discussion
Cataloging Physcomitrella miRNAs
In our study, we analyzed 152 sRNAs obtained by cloning.
After stringent filtering steps, we identified 24 new and six
previously known Physcomitrella miRNAs among them.
Additionally, we used a computational strategy by which
29 individual miRNAs were predicted based on sequence
similarity; only five of these had been previously reported
from Physcomitrella [17,46]. From this collective group of
59 miRNAs, we experimentally validated 18 novel miRNAs. This validation included eight miRNAs specific for
Physcomitrella and ten homologs of known plant miRNA
families. These 18 miRNAs were identified by cloning
(12) or prediction (6), indicating a high degree of true
positives in the dataset presented in this study. The small
overlap in the number of miRNAs found by cloning and
through the computational strategy indicates that a combined approach is much more likely to yield a comprehensive set of miRNAs, especially if knowledge about
miRNAs in related organisms is available.

Together with the 30 previously reported miRNAs
[17,46], we extended the number of known miRNAs in
Physcomitrella patens to 78. Compared to maize, Arabidopsis, rice and poplar where 96, 118, 182 and 213 miRNAs
were described, respectively, this number seems small.
Hence, it is in good agreement with the idea that a less
complex organism than higher plants, gymno- and
angiosperms, such as moss, might utilize a less complex
set of miRNAs. However, one of the most striking results
of this study is that our screen was in no way exhaustive:
the vast majority of miRNAs was found only in single copies in our sRNA library and the overlap is about only one
third each between the miRNA populations identified by
cloning, by computational prediction, or which had been
described before. Thus, it is very likely that the number of
miRNAs in Physcomitrella is much greater than 78 and will
well reach numbers known for higher plants. Furthermore, compared to the relatively low number of two Physcomitrella miRNAs identified by the analysis of available
EST data [18], our investigation of the genomic sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/13

resulted in a far greater number of miRNAs as presented in
this study.
Tissue-specific maturation of miRNAs as a new level of
regulation
In our analyses, we found evidence for unknown processing or maturation steps that have not been previously
described and at least eight cases of tissue-specific expression. For miR477 and 2–51, the regulation is achieved
posttranscriptionally by tissue-dependent maturation.
The most interesting observation is the evidence for the
coupled maturation of two miRNAs from a shared precursor. These two miRNAs, 1–50 and 2–51, are located on
the same precursor and are separated by only one nucleotide. This presents the first example for plants, as well as
for animals, that two miRNAs are processed from the
same stem-loop precursor where they reside in close vicinity. Furthermore, the maturation of these two miRNAs
from their shared precursor differed between protonema
and gametophores. The mature miRNA 1–51 was detected
in protonema and gametophores, whereas the mature
miRNA 2–51 was only present in protonema. The unprocessed precursor still harboring miRNA 2–51 accumulated
in gametophores. Tissue-specific processing of miRNAs as
a new level of regulation has not been observed in plants
before, while it has been reported for mammals [66]. In
consequence, the cleavage of stem-loop precursors of particular miRNAs by Dicer could be restricted to specific cell
types or involve additional factors which regulate this specificity. Moreover, the differential processing presents an
additional way to control miRNA action besides the tissue-specific transcription of the precursor.
Evidence for co-accumulating miRNA/miRNA* pairs?
The cloning of miRNAs and their cognate miRNA* has
been reported in the literature [6,67,68]. The miRNA* has
always been found to be less abundant than the respective
miRNA. It has been suggested that after cleavage of the
precursor by Dicer, the miRNA becomes part of the RNA
induced silencing complex (RISC) whereas its counterpart
miRNA* is rapidly degraded [8]. In all cases observed
here, the possible miRNA/miRNA* partners were present
in comparable amounts. The miRNAs 1–63/3–14 are a
potential miRNA/miRNA* pair since they are located on
opposite arms of the same precursor and are able to basepair at least partially with each other. We verified the existence of both miRNAs experimentally. In addition, putative targets for both miRNAs were predicted from the EST
sequences, suggesting that both act as miRNAs rather than
constituting miRNA/miRNA*. Since a separate precursor
was found for miRNA 1–63, the potentially shared 1–63/
3–14 precursor may not actually deliver mature 1–63, but
this possibility cannot be totally exluded. Another pair of
miRNA/miRNA* is represented by miRNAs 3–44 and 344-antisense and again, the existence of both miRNAs was

Page 14 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:13

experimentally validated. At this stage, however, the final
proof for a miRNA/miRNA* pair cannot be provided as
we did not find a possible precursor for either of these
miRNAs. Thus, it is impossible to determine whether they
stem from the same or different precursors and if their
nearly equivalent levels of co-accumulation is due to a
slow miRNA* degradation rate in Physcomitrella. Interestingly, besides being a potential miRNA*, miRNA 3-44antisense is a homolog to miR477 sharing considerable
sequence identity, even though the Physcomitrella miRNA
3-44-antisense is 24 nt in size compared to the 21 nt
miR477.
Evolutionary conservation of plant miRNAs
Based on analyzing the evolutionary conservation of miRNAs throughout several plant species, we identified Physcomitrella miRNAs belonging to 17 previously described
plant miRNA families. In previous studies, members of
the miRNA families 156, 319, 390 and 535 were found in
Physcomitrella [17,46]. The existence of the miRNA families 160, 166 and 172 in Physcomitrella was suggested
without experimental evidence and was based on the presence of their putative binding sites in conserved target
genes [36-38]. Furthermore, the presence of miR160 was
shown in the moss Polytrichum juniperinum [37]. In this
study, we have identified additional Physcomitrella miRNAs belonging to 13 conserved plant miRNA families. In
some cases, conserved miRNAs present in Physcomitrella
also target similar genes as those observed in higher
plants. We found that miR160 and miR166 most likely
control transcription factors in Physcomitrella that are
homologous to those already reported from other plants
[36,37]. In addition, we identified two new miRNAs,
miR408 and miR477, for which homologous targets are
also predicted at least in Populus trichocarpa [59,64]. This
co-conservation lets us conclude that these miRNAs regulate central processes common and essential to all plants,
such as developmental processes [37].

Moreover, the detailed target analysis revealed a bias
towards regulation, signal transduction, cell wall biosynthesis and defense. These processes must have been relevant for the step from water to land and therefore it might
not come as a surprise to find these mRNAs in Physcomitrella. However, the dominance of these mRNA
classes as miRNA targets is stunning. It does provide support for the development of new eukaryotic organs and
tissue types in parallel with the explosive expansion of
regulatory mechanisms dependent on RNA as recently
predicted [44].
However, for 18 other miRNA families which are shared
by at least two different plants, no members were found
in Physcomitrella. Some of these families may have evolved
only after the split between mosses and seed plants. Our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/13

results clearly demonstrate the ancient roots of many
plant miRNA families, whereas others may have evolved
after the split between mosses and seed plants. Similar
findings have been reported for animals, where inventions of particular miRNA families correspond to major
developmental progress like the advent of vertebrates and
mammals [39]. Those conserved miRNA families not
found in Physcomitrella may present similar innovations of
the plant miRNA repertoire which coincide with the
advent of vascular plants. However, our results also indicate that a considerable number of miRNA families exist
in Physcomitrella without any counterpart among higher
plants. This observation suggests that these families
evolved in the moss after their split from the lineage leading to seed plants or were lost during plant evolution.
Hence, this set can be seen as miRNAs that separate Physcomitrella from higher plants and they may be involved in
processes restricted to mosses.
In one example, the search for plant homologs to Physcomitrella miRNAs revealed a rice homolog to miRNA 4–
12 that might have been overlooked in previous analyses.
Consequently, a deeper analysis of the miRNA repertoire
of distantly related plants might help to discover more
miRNAs in higher plants. Beside the evolution of certain
plant miRNA families, the analysis of Physcomitrella miRNAs allows one to draw further conclusions on the diversification of these families. In many cases, Physcomitrella
seems to have less individual members within a given
miRNA family. The lower complexity of miRNA families
in Physcomitrella suggests that the total number of target
genes controlled by these miRNAs might be smaller compared to higher plants. Moreover, the miRNA gene copy
number seems to be smaller in Physcomitrella. The
increased number of genes for one particular miRNA in
higher plants might be explained by the demand to regulate miRNA expression in a more diverse manner than in
Physcomitrella. A larger number of gene copies encoding
the same miRNA allows the differential expression of
these genes by divergent promoters responding to different signaling pathways. Similar scenarios have been
observed in expression analyses of multicopy miRNA
gene families in Arabidopsis and rice [69]. The higher complexity of seed plants, with a large number of different cell
types, may require the distinct expression of particular
miRNAs in certain cell types. In contrast, mosses have a
simpler body plan that is formed by only few different cell
types. Therefore, a lower number of miRNA genes may
suffice to meet the requirements of a cell-specific expression.

Conclusion
The identification of 48 novel miRNAs in the moss Physcomitrella, an early-branching plant species, and a comparison of miRNAs among various land plant species

Page 15 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:13

revealed a considerable number of miRNA families specific for Physcomitrella. Other families were retained during land plant radiation or were found to be specific for
higher land plants, and thus, may have evolved after the
divergence between vascular plants and mosses. The numbers of miRNAs in some families were expanded in higher
plants, possibly reflecting the increased complexity of
these species. Novel aspects of miRNA biogenesis were
found in the maturation of two individual miRNAs from
one shared precursor. This is a novel finding as the miRNAs are located side by side and are not complementary
to each other. Furthermore, we found evidence for their
tissue-specific maturation, uncoupling the presence of the
mature forms of these two miRNAs from each other. Thus,
processing of these precursors may present another level
of control to generate miRNAs in a tissue-specific manner.

Methods
Plant material
Physcomitrella patens plants were cultured in a modified
liquid Knop medium containing 250 mg l-1 KH2PO4, 250
mg l-1 KCl, 250 mg l-1 MgSO4·7H2O, 1000 mg l-1
Ca(NO3)2, and 12.5 mg l-1 FeSO4·(pH 5.8) as described
by Reski and Abel [70]. Erlenmeyer flasks containing 400
ml of suspension culture were agitated on a rotary shaker
at 120 rpm at 25°C under a light/dark regime of 16/8 h
(Philips TLD 25, 50 µM m-2 s-1). Liquid cultures were
mechanically disrupted every week to maintain the plants
in the protonema stage. Gametophore development was
induced by transferring protonema tissue to solidified
Knop medium [71].
Cloning of small RNAs (sRNAs)
Prior to the isolation of RNA, protonema and gametophore tissue were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Total RNA was isolated and sRNAs were cloned as described by Llave et al.
[72] with minor modifications. Small RNAs (< 200 nt)
were separated on a denaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide
gel. The population of sRNAs corresponding to 15–35 nt
in size was recovered by passive elution from the gel. Following the poly(A)-tailing with E. coli poly(A) polymerase,
an
RNA
adaptor
(5'GAATTCCTCTGGACCTTGGCTGTCACTCAAA-3'; EcoRI
site is underlined) was ligated to the 5' phosphate of the
sRNAs. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using
an oligo(dT)-linker primer (5'-GGATCCCCTTACGAGACATCGCCCCGC-dT25; BamHI site is underlined) with MMLV-RNase H- reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNAs
were amplified by 17 PCR cycles with primers derived
from the adaptor sequences and the cDNAs were directionally cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the
pBluescript II SK+ vector. Ligation products were electroporated into TransforMaxTM EC100TM electro-competent cells (Epicentre, Oldendorf, Germany) and plasmid
DNA from single colonies were isolated and sequenced.

Sequence and structure analysis
The obtained sRNA sequences were subjected to different
filtering procedures. Small RNA sequences shorter than 16
nt in length were removed and were not subjected to further analysis. To examine the origin of the remaining
sRNAs and to detect contaminations of the sRNA library
with fragments derived from highly abundant RNAs, a
non redundant set was generated and searched against
GenBank [73] and Rfam [74]. Small RNAs with 100%
identity to tRNA, rRNA, or chloroplast DNA were
excluded from further analysis. Homologs to known miRNAs were identified using miRBase [75]. In order to detect
corresponding miRNA precursor sequences, all putative
miRNA sequences were subsequently analyzed by BLAST
searches against the Physcomitrella genomic trace files and
a Physcomitrella EST database [42,50]. Genomic or EST
sequences with one or more perfect matches to an individual sRNA sequence were clustered and assembled using
the Paracel Transcript Assembler. The parameters for clustering threshold, overlap length and overlap identity were
100 nt, 80 nt and 85%, respectively. The generated contig
sequences were analyzed with RNAshapes [54] to predict
the secondary structure of miRNA precursors. For this,
sequences spanning the putative miRNA site were
trimmed in three different combinations upstream and
downstream of the putative miRNA sequence: (1) 150 bp
upstream and 50 bp downstream, (2) 50 bp upstream and
150 bp downstream, and (3) 150 bp upstream and 150 bp
downstream of the miRNA sequence. Genomic trace files
can be retrieved from NCBI genomic trace archive [76]
and EST sequences are available at Physcomitrella patens
resource cosmoss [77].
Identification of homologs to known miRNAs from other
plants
Evolutionary conservation of miRNA sequences is a feature which can be used to find miRNAs which are homologous to an already identified miRNA from another plant
species. Such a strategy is implemented in the tool microHARVESTER [35] which we used to identify homologs to
known miRNAs (miRBase) in genomic trace files and EST
sequences allowing a maximum number of eight
unpaired nucleotides within the mature miRNA sequence.
The sequences of predicted precursors of the miRNA
homologs were further analyzed by clustering, trimming,
and prediction of hairpin-like structures using the same
parameters described above.
Prediction of miRNA target genes
MicroRNA-specific target genes were predicted for the
Physcomitrella EST database using RNAhybrid [61]. This
was done for both possible orientations as the database
contains sequences derived from 5' as well as 3' cDNA
ends. The target prediction parameters were used according to Schwab et al. [60]: no mismatch at positions 10 and

Page 16 of 19

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:13

11, no more than one mismatch at positions 2–12, no
more than two consecutive mismatches downstream of
position 13, and at least 72% of free energy compared to
a perfectly complementary target. The nucleotide
sequences of putative targets were used for BLASTX
searches against UniProt and TrEMBL in order to get preliminary gene annotation. EST sequences of the target
genes are available at the Pyscomitrella patens resource
cosmoss [77].

Additional material
Small RNA blots
Total RNA from Physcomitrella plants was isolated with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and separated
in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 M
urea in TBE buffer (45 mM tris-borate pH 8.0, 1 mM
EDTA). RNA gels were stained for 30 min with ethidium
bromide (1 µg/ml in TBE buffer) and de-stained for 30
min in TBE buffer. The RNA was electroblotted to Hybond
N+ nylon membranes (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany)
for 1 h at 400 mA using a trans-blot transfer cell (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and crosslinked by UV light. Radiolabeled RNA probes were generated using mirVana miRNA
probe construction kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization and hybridization of the blots were carried out in
0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 6 ×
SSC, 1 × Denhardt's, 5% SDS. Blots were washed 2–3
times with 2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS and once with 1 × SSC,
0.1% SDS. Blots were hybridized and washed at temperatures 5°C below the Tm of the oligonucleotide. The membranes were autoradiographed using the Molecular FX
phosphoimager (Bio-Rad). Blots were stripped in between
hybridizations by washing three times 10 min each with
0.1% SDS at 90°C and exposed overnight to verify complete removal of probe before rehybridization.
Validation of miRNA targets
RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends
was carried out using the GeneRacer Kit from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, USA). The GeneRacer RNA 5' primer was
directly ligated to pooled RNA isolated from protonema
and gametophores without previous phosphatase pyrophosphatase treatments. PCR amplification was performed using the GeneRacer 5' primer and 3' gene specific
primers for T_5_33 (5'-AATTCTCTGGTGTGTTGTCGGCGGAGAG-3') and T2_miR477 (5'-CAGTCTCAGTAAAGATGGCGCAGCAGGT-3').
Amplified
T2_miR477
product was subjected to nested PCR with 1µl of the initial PCR using the GeneRacer 5' nested primer and a 3'
gene specific nested primer (5'-CTCCCTCCAGAGAGCACCGCAAGA-3'). PCR products were gel-purified,
cloned and then sequenced.
