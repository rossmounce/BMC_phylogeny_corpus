Abstract
Background: Mutations in the mismatch repair genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 predispose to
hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Genetic screening of more than 350 Danish
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) has led to the identification of several new genetic variants
(e.g. missense, silent and non-coding) in hMLH1 and hMSH2. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the frequency of these variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 in Danish patients with sporadic
colorectal cancer and in the healthy background population. The purpose was to reveal if any of
the common variants lead to increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer.
Methods: Associations between genetic variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 and sporadic colorectal
cancer were evaluated using a case-cohort design. The genotyping was performed on DNA isolated
from blood from the 380 cases with sporadic colorectal cancer and a sub-cohort of 770 individuals.
The DNA samples were analyzed using Single Base Extension (SBE) Tag-arrays. A Bonferroni
corrected Fisher exact test was used to test for association between the genotypes of each variant
and colorectal cancer. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was investigated using HaploView (v3.31).
Results: Heterozygous and homozygous changes were detected in 13 of 35 analyzed variants. Two
variants showed a borderline association with colorectal cancer, whereas the remaining variants
demonstrated no association. Furthermore, the genomic regions covering hMLH1 and hMSH2
displayed high linkage disequilibrium in the Danish population. Twenty-two variants were neither
detected in the cases with sporadic colorectal cancer nor in the sub-cohort. Some of these rare
variants have been classified either as pathogenic mutations or as neutral variants in other
populations and some are unclassified Danish variants.
Conclusion: None of the variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 analyzed in the present study were highly
associated with colorectal cancer in the Danish population. High linkage disequilibrium in the

genomic regions covering hMLH1 and hMSH2, indicate that common genetic variants in the two
genes in general are not involved in the development of sporadic colorectal cancer. Nevertheless,
some of the rare unclassified variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 might be involved in the development
of colorectal cancer in the families where they were originally identified.

Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant disease
in the western world. The lifetime risk is about 5% and rising [1]. In 2003, approximately 3,600 new cases where
registered by the Danish Cancer Registry equivalent to
10% of the total number of malignant cancer cases in
Denmark, making CRC the third most common cancer in
the country [2].
A twin study has demonstrated that up to 35% of the
CRCs can be explained by inherited susceptibility [3].
However, only approximately 5% of the CRCs are
explained by well defined hereditary syndromes displaying a Mendelian inheritance pattern. The most common
form of hereditary CRC is hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) [4,5]. Diagnosis of HNPCC is
based on kindred analysis using the Amsterdam II criteria
[6]. In the major part of the HNPCC families the disease
is caused by loss of function pathogenic mutations such as
nonsense, frameshift and non-coding mutations affecting
splice sites identified mainly in three genes i.e. hMLH1,
hMSH2 and hMSH6 [7].
A part from the clearly pathogenic mutations genetic
screening has also revealed numerous missense, silent and
non-coding variants of unknown significance in hMLH1,
hMSH2 and hMSH6. Ideally, segregation studies should
be conducted to reveal the pathogenicity of a given variant. However, such analyses are often not feasible due to
limited family sizes and unavailability of clinical specimens. Consequently, different evaluation methods have
been used, especially for the missense variants, to be able
to distinguish neutral variants from disease-causing mutations. Functional analyses of individual missense variants
have been carried out using different in vitro assays e.g. [813]. The functional studies have revealed both loss of
function mutations that are most likely pathogenic [8-13]
and variants with reduced activity [8-11]. Apart from noncoding mutations affecting the classical splice sites at
intron/exon junctions, missense changes as well as silent
changes in hMLH1 and hMSH2 have also been shown to
alter pre-mRNA splicing and thereby causing exon skipping [14,15]. Functional analyses are laborious and therefore in silico methods available on the internet (e.g. SIFT,
PolyPhen and PMUT) have be used to identify variants
that should be selected for further functional analysis
[16].

In silico predictions and in vitro functional analyses provide an idea of which variants are pathogenic. However,
population studies are needed to reveal the in vivo pathogenicity of the individual variants. At present, very few
population studies have dealt with the association of
common variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 with susceptibility to sporadic CRC [17-19].
The present study describes a population based analysis of
the frequency of variants of unknown significance in
hMLH1 and hMSH2 in Danish patients with sporadic
CRC and in a sub-cohort of controls. Some of the variants
have been described in other studies, and some are, to our
knowledge, new variants unique to the Danish population. We have analyzed the allele frequencies of 29 variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 to reveal whether they cause
increased susceptibility to sporadic CRC in the Danish
population or whether they are private variants/mutations found only in the families where they were originally identified. In addition to the 29 variants identified
in Danish individuals, six variants identified in other Caucasian populations were also investigated.

Methods
Subjects/cohort
The subjects were selected from the Danish Diet, Cancer
and Health (DCH) study, which is an ongoing prospective
follow-up study [20]. In all 57,053 men and women born
in Denmark, living in the greater Copenhagen or Aarhus
areas, aged 50–64, and with no previous cancer diagnosis
at the time of enrolment, were included in the study. The
participants were recruited during the years 1993–1997.
At the time of enrolment, biological material from blood,
urine, nails and fat tissue was sampled and stored in liquid nitrogen at -150°C. Among the cohort members 380
cases with CRC diagnosed between 1994 and 2004 were
identified in the files of the Danish Cancer Registry. A subcohort of 770 controls (including 10 cases) was selected
randomly from the cohort. The characteristics of the
cohort are shown in Table 1. General protocols concerning the Diet, Cancer and Health study have been evaluated and approved by the Regional Scientific Committees
on Human Studies in Copenhagen and Aarhus (journal
number: H-KF-01-345/93) and the Danish Data Protection Agency. A protocol regarding the present study has
been submitted and approved by the mentioned committees as a supplement to the initial protocols.

*Age at inclusion into the cohort given as mean (sd) in years

Another cohort named familiar CRC consisting of 285
CRC cases was also included in the study. The majority of
the variants were initially identified in this cohort. Some
variants were found only in one family whereas others
were identified in several families in the cohort. The
cohort consists of individuals from HNPCC families
(based on the Amsterdam II criteria) or individuals from
families not fulfilling the Amsterdam II criteria, but with
a clear familial accumulation of CRC. The presence of
other clearly pathogenic mutations in the hMLH1, hMSH2
and hMSH6 has been excluded by sequencing. All individuals in the cohort of familiar CRC have been consulted by
a clinical geneticist and informed consent was obtained
from all individuals in the cohort. Detailed information
on each individual family in this cohort is not available.
DNA samples
DNA was extracted from frozen leukocytes as described
previously [21].
Variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2
Initially, 47 variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 were included
in the study. Forty-one of the variants have previously
been identified either in Danish HNPCC patients (i.e. fulfilling the Amsterdam II criteria) or in patients not fulfilling the Amsterdam II criteria but with a familial
accumulation of CRC. Six variants have been identified in
other Caucasian populations. Of the initial 47 selected
variants, 12 variants were excluded either due to troubles
regarding the primer design or lack of amplification product in the multiplex PCR. The remaining 35 analyzed variants are listed in Table 2.
Genotyping using Single Base Extension (SBE)-tag arrays
Primer design
The multiplex PCR primers were designed using Oligo 6
[22]. The PCR products were between 100 and 450 bp.
The optimal annealing temperature (Ta) was set to
~50°C, the GC content to ~40% and the primer Tm difference to ≤1. The single base extension (SBE) primers contained 5' 20-bp 'tag' sequences that were from the

Affymetrix GeneChip® Tag Collection. The gene specific
part of the SBE primers had a Tm of ~50–60°C (calculated
using PrimerExpress 2.0)(Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The tagged SBE primers were tested for major hairpin
loop formation using Oligo6. All variants were typed
using SBE-primers for both DNA strands. The primers
were synthesized by DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). The multiplex PCR primer and the SBE primer
sequences are available on request.
Multiplex PCR
The multiplex PCR amplification was performed with 6–
9 primer pairs per reaction. Twenty ng of genomic DNA
with 0.5 μl Accuprime™ DNA polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), 1× Accuprime™ Buffer I, and 0.08–1 μM
primers was amplified in 25 μl volumes using the following PCR conditions: 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 min; 13 cycles
of 95°C for 30 sec., 67°C (-1°C/cycle) for 45 sec. and
72°C for 45 sec.; 20 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec., 55°C for
45 sec. and 72°C for 45 sec.; 1 cycle of 72°C for 10 min.
A subset of the multiplex PCR products were analysed on
a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA) to test the performance of the multiplex PCR. The
multiplex PCR products from each sample were pooled
for further analysis.
Single Base Extension (SBE) reaction
The pooled PCR products from each sample were treated
with Exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase and
used for template in the SBE reaction (mini-sequencing)
as described by Lindross et al. [23]. The fluorescent
labelled ddNTP were Cyanine 5 (Cy5)-ddCTP, TAMRAddUTP, Texas Red®-5-ddATP and R110-ddGTP (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc, Wellesley, Ma).
Preparation of microarrays
'Anti-tag' oligonucleotides complimentary to the 'tag'
sequences of the SBE primers modified with NH2 groups
in their 3' ends, and containing a 3'-spacer of 15 T residues
were coupled covalently to CodeLink Activated Slides
(Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) according to
manufacturer instructions. The only exception was that
the 'anti-tag' oligonucleotides were dissolved in 150 mM
sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5 with 1 mM betaine at a
concentration of 20 μM. The oligonucleotides were
printed onto the slides using a VersArray ChipWriter (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with 3 Stealth Micro Spotting Pins
(TeleChem International Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Each slide
consists of 75 sub-arrays with 13 × 12 spots in each subarray. The spots were 130–150 μM in diameter and the centre-to-centre distance between two spots was 200 μM. The
'anti-tag' oligonucleotides were printed in duplicates in
each sub-array. The spot quality was tested after each
series of microarray preparation using a Cy3 labelled random oligonucleotide hybridizing to all spots on the slide

min. in 0.2 × SSC (room temperature). Finally, the slides
were spin dried for 3 min. at 800 rpm.

Hybridization of the SBE reaction products
The slides printed with 'anti-tags' were pre-heated to 42°C
in a custom-made aluminium reaction rack with a re-usable silicon rubber grid placed on the slides to form 75 separate reaction chambers on each slide [24]. The
hybridization mixtures, containing the SBE reaction products in 6.5 × SSC were added to each reaction chamber on
the pre-heated slide. The hybridization time was 2.5 hours
at 42°C followed by a brief rinse with 4 × SSC at room
temperature. Subsequently, the slides were washed twice
for 5 min. in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (42°C) and twice for 1

Signal detection
The signal detection was performed mainly as described
by Lindroos et al. [23]. The fluorescence signals were
detected with a ScanArray 4000XL instrument and the
ScanArray Express software (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc, Wellesley, Ma). The four excitation
lasers were: blue Argon, 488 nm; Green HeNe, 543.8 nm;
Yellow HeNe, 594 nm and Red HeNe 632.8 nm. The laser
power was kept constant at 90%, whereas the photo-multiplier tube (PMT) varied between fluorophores. A typical
setting for the PMT gain was 65, 75, 65 and 70% for the

fluorophores Cy5-ddCTP, TAMRA-ddUTP, Texas Red®-5ddATP and R110-ddGTP, respectively.
Statistics
Association tests
A Bonferroni corrected Fisher exact test was used to test for
association between the genotypes of each SNP and the
familiar CRC cohort and the cohort of sporadic CRC,
respectively. Fifteen tests were made for single marker
associations, in the cohort of familiar CRC, yielding a
Bonferroni corrected significance level of 0.05/15 =
0.0033. Likewise the Bonferroni corrected p-value of the
cohort of sporadic cases was 0.05/13 = 0.0038. A Bonferroni corrected Monte Carlo (MC) Fisher exact test was
used to test for association between each pair of SNPs, and
sporadic or familiar CRC. One hundred thousand permutations were used for each test. Missing data were handled
by omitting persons with missing data in the genotype
counts; e.g. all individuals with missing data in either variant id 26 or variant id 27 were omitted when calculating
the genotype frequencies of that specific SNP-pair.
Power calculations
The power was calculated by applying the Fisher exact test
to 10000 independent simulated cases with the given
odds ratio and frequency of the disease causing genotype.
In that case the power is the proportion of the simulations
that reach a p-value lower than 0.05/15 = 0.0033.
Test for Hardy-Weinberg proportions
Each variant was tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions in the sub-cohort, using the exact test
described by Wigginton et al. [25]. The used significance
level was 0.01.
Linkage disequilibrium
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was investigated using HaploView (v. 3.31), [26] and genome build NCBI35 for
information track.
In silico analysis
In silico prediction of the functional consequence of the
missense variants was performed using SIFT (Sorting
Intolerant From Tolerant) [27], Polyphen [28] and PMUT
[29]. Mis-splicing was analysed using SNAP (SNP Annotation Platform) [30]. The alignments of MSH2 or MLH1
polypeptides used in the phylogenetic analysis of the missense variants was performed using ClustalW [31].

Results
Performance of the Single Base Extension-tag arrays
Single base extension (SBE)-tag arrays is a well described
method for analysing single nucleotide polymorphisms
[23]. Initially, 47 variants were included in the study.
However, 12 variants either failed the initial primer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/52

design or they did not perform well in the multiplex PCR
reaction. The accuracy of the SBE-tag array in the genotyping of the remaining 35 variants was tested using samples
with known genotypes. All tested samples were correctly
genotyped (data not shown). A total of 31 of 35 variants
performed very well in the assay, i.e. more than 70% of
the samples had positive call (data not shown).
Frequency of variants in the three analysed cohorts
We have identified the frequency of 35 variants in hMLH1
and hMSH2 in a well defined cohort of 770 individuals
representative of the Danish population. In addition, the
frequency of the variants was also identified in 380 cases
with sporadic CRC and in 285 individuals with familiar
CRC. The analyzed variants were initially identified in the
familiar CRC cohort and the cohort was included in the
study to elucidate whether a common variant could
explain the elevated cancer susceptibility in these families.

The characteristics of the cohort of sporadic CRC cases
and the sub-cohort are shown in Table 1. Thirteen out of
35 variants were polymorphic in the cohort of sporadic
CRC cases and/or in the sub-cohorts (Tables 2 and 3). Ten
of these variants were detected with a frequency ≥1% in
the sub-cohort and are therefore relatively common in the
Danish population. The remaining three variants were
present with a frequency <1% (Table 3). None of the analysed variants deviated significantly from the HardyWeinberg equilibrium. Out of the 13 identified variants 9
were non-coding or silent variants and 3 were non-conserved missense changes and one was a conserved missense change (Table 2). The frequency of 11/13 variants
did not differ significantly between any of the three analyzed cohorts neither individually (Table 4) nor as pairs
(data not shown). The frequency of one variant; hMSH2
c.-118 T>C differed significantly between the sporadic
CRC cases and the sub-cohort with a borderline significant p-value of 0.0037 (significance level: 0.05/13 =
0.0038). One previous study has demonstrated a slight
difference between the frequencies of this variant in
HNPCC cases and controls (p-value of 0.034) [32],
whereas another study detected no difference [33]. In
addition, it has also been shown that the variant does not
change the promoter activity of the hMSH2 promoter in
vitro and it is therefore most likely not involved in
increased susceptibility to CRC [32]. The frequency of the
variant hMLH1 c.1668-19 A>G differed between the
familiar CRC cases and the sub-cohort with a borderline
significant p-value of 0.0044 (significance level: 0.05/15 =
0.0033). This variant is an intronic variant which has
never been characterized neither in vivo nor in vitro. In silico analyses using SNAP (a SNP Annotations Platform)
[30] demonstrated that the presence of this variant results
in the elimination of an Exon Splicing Enhancer (ESE)
(SRp40) and the introduction of a new ESE (SRp55) (data

§ na: not analyzed
Variants that where polymorphic in sporadic CRC cohort or in the sub-cohort are in bold

not shown). However, in vitro analysis must be performed
to reveal if these changes result in an aberrant splice pattern.
Twenty-two of the variants analysed in the present study
were neither detected in the sporadic cases nor in the subcohort (Tables 2 and 3). Among those were the six variants originally identified in other Caucasian populations
i.e. hMLH1 c.1558+11 G>A and MSH2 c.287 G>A, c.329
A>G, c.380 A>G, c.2006-6 T>C/G and c.2139 G>T (see
Table 2 for references). The remaining 16 variants, which
have all been identified in Danish individuals with a
familiar accumulation of CRC, are therefore very rare variants in the Danish population. Some of these rare vari-

ants have been classified either as neutral variants (e.g.
hMLH1 c.2152 C>T and hMSH2 c.2500G>A) or pathogenic mutations (e.g. hMLH1 c.350 C>T, and hMSH2
c131 C>T) in Danish HNPCC families and/or HNPCC
families from other populations (see Table 2 for references). To our knowledge, some of the rare variants have
never been described previously neither in the Danish
population nor in other populations (Table 2). These variants are most likely private variants found only in the
families where they were originally identified. Four of the
rare unclassified variants are missense variants changing
either non-conserved amino acids i.e. hMLH1 c.1379 A>C
and c.1689 A>G or conserved amino acids i.e. hMSH2
c.2062 A>G and c.2542 G>T.

Linkage disequilibrium
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses of the genomic
regions covering hMLH1 and hMSH2 demonstrated high
LD in the genomic regions covering the two genes. LD
plots of the sub-cohort in the genomic regions covering
the two genes are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. The nine
polymorphic variants in hMLH1 in the sub-cohort are
scattered along the whole genomic region of the gene.
Only three polymorphic variants were identified in
hMSH2. Two of these variants demonstrated high LD.
They are positioned widely apart and thus cover a large
area of the genomic region of hMSH2. The low LD of the
third polymorphic variant in hMSH2 might be due to the
low minor allele frequency of the variant. The high LD in
the genomic regions covering the two genes indicates that
common genetic variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 in general are not involved in the development of sporadic CRC
in the Danish population.
In silico characterization of the variants
In silico functional characterization of the included missense variants was performed using SIFT [27], PolyPhen
[28] and PMUT [29]. Nine of the missense mutations had
previously been characterized at the functional level using
different in vitro assays (references in Table 5). To test the
accuracy of the in silico functional predictions we compared the results of the in silico analyses with the results of
the in vitro functional analyses (Table 5). Concordance

between predictions of all the in silico algorithms and the
results of the in vitro functional analyses were found for 3/
9 missense variants i.e. MLH1 p.Val219Ile, p.Ser406Asn
and p.Pro648Ser. None of the in silico algorithms were
more accurate in their predictions than the others when
compared to the results of the in vitro functional analysis.
The predictions of the SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms were
frequently similar and often differed from the prediction
made by PMUT. The above results demonstrate the
importance of the use of in vitro functional analysis for the
characterization of missense variants identified in individuals with hereditary CRC such as HNPCC.
There was no overall concordance between the in silico
functional predictions of the four unclassified Danish variants i.e. MLH1 p.Glu460Ala, and p.Ile563Met and MSH2
p.Met688Val and p.Ala848Ser (Table 5.). The MLH1
p.Glu460Ala variant changes a non-conserved amino acid
situated in the central region of MLH1 (Table 5). No
defined functional domain has been assigned to this
region of the protein [34]. The MLH1 p.Ile563Met variant
changes a non-conserved amino acid situated in the PMS2
interaction domain of MLH1 (Table 5) [34]. The two variants in MSH2 i.e. p.Met688Val and p.Ala848Ser result in
the elimination of conserved amino acids in the Walker A
motif, required for ATP binding and the MutL homologue
interaction domain, respectively (Table 5 and Figure 2)
[35]. All the above characteristics of the missense variants

indicate that at least the two missense variants in MSH2
might be disease causing mutations. However, further
functional analyses are needed before any final conclusions can be drawn.
The putative role of all 35 variants in pre-mRNA splicing
was analyzed using SNAP [30]. These analyses showed
that several of the variants potentially either abolish or
introduce Exon Splicing Enhancers (ESEs)(data not
shown).

Discussion
Identification of missense, silent and non-coding variants
in genes involved in hereditary diseases always raises the
intriguing question whether these variants are the disease
causing mutations in the family/families where they are
identified. Alternatively, they may be common variants
causing a slight increase in sporadic disease susceptibility
in the general population or simple neutral variants that
are not involved in disease development. Missense, silent
and non-coding variants are identified frequently in MMR
genes (e.g. hMLH1 and hMSH2) in families fulfilling the

Amsterdam II criteria. Functional analyses have shown
that some of the missense variants identified in hMLH1
and hMSH2 result in reduced MMR activity and it has
therefore been suggested that the decreased efficiency of
DNA MMR could lead to increased cancer susceptibility
[8-11].
In the present study, we have used a case-cohort design to
elucidate the possible association between 35 variants in
hMLH1 and hMSH2, either individually or as pairs, and
the risk of sporadic CRC in the Danish population. The
Danish Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH) cohort is large,
population based and genetically homogeneous [20]. The
sub-cohort used in the comparisons was selected randomly from the same cohort that gave rise to the cases
with sporadic CRC; selection bias is thus unlikely. The
cases and the individuals in the sub-cohort have been in
the study equally long time and have approximately the
same mean age (Table 1). We estimated that our study
would be able to detect a disease susceptibility locus with
an odds ratio (OR) of 2.5 with a power of 0.82, if the frequency of the disease causing genotype is 0.05, and a

onstrated no association between MMR gene variants and
the susceptibility to sporadic ovarian cancer [36]. In addition, previous association studies performed in Chinese
and Korean populations did not find any association
between variants in MMR genes and sporadic CRC
[17,18]. The MLH1 c.415 G>C (p.Asp132His) variant has
been shown to be associated with susceptibility to sporadic CRC in an Israeli population, although the CRCs
associated with the variant usually are not MSI [19]. However, the p.Asp132His variant was present but not associated with sporadic CRC in a Chinese population [17].
Furthermore, the variant was not detected in a population
of more 1,100 Americans with HNPCC-related cancers
[37]. The p.Asp132His variant was not polymorphic in
the Danish cohort of familiar CRC analyzed in the present
study (data not shown). The frequency of the variant was
not analyzed in the cohort of cases with sporadic CRC nor
in the sub-cohort. However, due to high LD in the
genomic region of hMLH1 this variant, if present in the
Danish population, is most likely not associated with sporadic CRC.
Thirteen variants were polymorphic in the present study.
The majority of the polymorphic variants (i.e. 9/13) were
silent or present in non-coding regions. This corresponds
with common variants being more abundant in introns
and other regions than in coding regions [38]. Three of
polymorphic variants i.e. MLH1 p.Val219Ile, p.Ser406Asn
and p.Lys618Ala changed non-conserved amino acids
and one i.e. MSH2 pGly322Asp changed a conserved
amino acid. Furthermore, two polymorphic variants
i.e.hMSH2 c.-118 T>C and hMLH1 c.1668-19 A>G demonstrated borderline significant p-values i.e. 0.0037 (significance level: 0.05/13 = 0.0038) and 0.0044
(significance level: 0.05/15 = 0.0033), respectively. It has
been stated that the conventional threshold for declaration of statistical evidence of association (i.e. a p-value of
5 × 10-2) is not sufficient to detect gene-disease interactions. Consequently, it has been suggested to lower the
threshold to 5 × 10-5 [39]. The borderline significant p-values and the previously published functional analysis of
one of the variants suggest that hMSH2 c.-118 T>C and
hMLH1 c.1668-19 A>G are not associated with increased
susceptibility to neither sporadic nor familiar CRC in the
Danish population. The remaining polymorphic variants
were not associated with CRC in the analyzed cohorts,
neither individually nor as pairs, and they are hence neutral variants in the Danish population. Some of these variants i.e. hMLH1 c.655 A>G (p.Val219Ile), c.1217G>A
(p.Ser406Asn), c.1558 +14 G>A and hMSH2 c.1959G>T
(p.Leu653Leu) have been characterized as neutral variants
in other studies as well [40-42]. In vitro functional analysis
have also demonstrated that the variants MLH1
p.Val219Ile and p.Ser406Asn exhibit wild-type activity
[8,11,12]. The hMSH2 variant c.965G>A (p.Gly322Asp)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/52

has previously been classified as a neutral variant [43].
This variant changes a conserved amino acid and functional analysis in yeast has shown that it has a slightly
reduced MMR activity [8,44]. In the present study, the frequency of the c.965 G>A variant was higher in the cohort
of individuals with familiar CRC compared to the subcohort although this was not statistically significant
(Tables 3 and 4). Results regarding the MLH1 p.Lys618Ala
variants have so far been contradictory. Functional analyses have identified this variant both as a pathogenic mutation and as a neutral variant [9,11,45-47]. Raevaara et al.
used four different assays to evaluate the pathogenic status
[9]. In all four assays the p.Lys618Val variant functioned
like wt MLH1. In addition, p.Lys618Ala has been identified in one healthy control in a previous study [48]. The
identification of the p.Lys618Ala variant in controls in the
present study further support, that this variant is not a disease causing mutation involved in HNPCC or HNPCCrelated cancers. In addition, the frequencies of the variant
in the cohorts analyzed in the present study did not differ
significantly and therefore p.Lys618Ala does not increase
susceptibility to sporadic CRC in the Danish population.
In conclusion none of the polymorphic variants in the
present study are highly associated with CRC in the Danish population.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed high LD in
the genomic regions covering hMLH1 and most of the
genomic region covering hMSH2 in the Danish population. We therefore conclude that common variants in the
two genes in general are not associated with susceptibility
to sporadic CRC in a Danish population.
The age of the cohort of cases with sporadic CRC is relatively young (mean ~58 years) compared to the mean age
of onset of colorectal CRC in the general Danish population (mean ~70 years) [49]. Consequently, the results
obtained in the present study do not rule out that variants
in hMLH1 and hMSH2 might be associated with sporadic
colorectal cancer at an older age. However, generally cancers reflecting an inherited susceptibility seem to occur in
a relatively young age.
Using in silico analysis several of the analyzed variants
were predicted to either abolish or introduce ESEs (data
not shown). It has, however, been shown that only a
minor fraction of the variants predicted to change ESEs in
hMLH1 and hMSH2 using in silico analysis do indeed
change the pre-mRNA splice pattern in vivo [14,15]. In the
study by Auclair et al., only ESEs at or close to 5' splice
sites were found to cause aberrant splicing. None of the
variants analysed in the present study affected 5' splice
sites. Nevertheless, no final conclusions regarding splicing
can be drawn from the in silico analyses.

Twenty two variants were not detected in the sporadic
CRC cases and in the sub-cohort. Among those were the
six variants originally identified more or less frequently in
other populations (Table 2). All except one variant (c.380
A>G, p.Asn127Ser) performed very well in the SBE-tag
array assay. This rules out that failure in detecting the variants caused their absence in the present cohorts. Consequently, these six variants are not polymorphic in the
Danish population. The remaining variants were rare variants in the Danish population. They were only detected
in individuals with familiar CRC and some of them have
been classified as pathogenic mutations or neutral variants in other populations (see Table 2 for references).
Four rare missense variants i.e. hMLH1 c.1379 A>C
(p.Glu460Ala) and c.1689 A>G (p.Ile563Met) and,
hMSH2 c.2062 A>G (p.Met688Val) and c.2542 G>T
(p.Ala848Ser) were unclassified and have to our knowledge never been described previously neither in the Danish population nor in other populations. Other disease
causing mutations have been identified in the families
harbouring the two hMLH1 variants changing non-conserved amino acids i.e. pGlu460Ala and p.Ile563Met
(unpublished results) consequently, these variants are
most likely neutral and not involved in HNPCC. However, no other disease causing mutations have been identified in the families harbouring the hMSH2 variants
changing conserved amino acids i.e. p.Met688Val and
p.Ala848Ser variants. Further characterization of these
variants such as functional studies and segregations analysis are needed before any final conclusion can be drawn
regarding their pathogenicity.

In conclusion, high penetrance cancer susceptibility genes
involved in hereditary syndromes have rarely emerged as
definitive low-penetrance genes as a result of common
variants increasing disease susceptibility [19]. The results
shown in the present study demonstrate that the highpenetrance HNPCC genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 also do not
appear to be low penetrance genes involved in sporadic
CRC in the Danish population.

Conclusion
More than half of the analysed variants in hMLH1 and
hMSH2 were not polymorphic in the analysed cohort. The
position of some of these rare variants in conserved
regions of hMSH2 might indicate an association to the
development of colorectal cancer in the families where
they were identified originally. This hypothesis needs to
be investigated further, using segregation and functional
analysis. None of the polymorphic variants were highly
associated with CRC in the Danish population. In addition, we demonstrated high LD in the genomic regions
covering the two genes. Consequently, we conclude that
common genetic variants in hMLH1 and hMSH2 in gen-
