Abstract
Background: Applications of computational methods for predicting protein functional linkages are increasing. In recent years,
several bacteria-specific methods for predicting linkages have been developed. The four major genomic context methods are:
Gene cluster, Gene neighbor, Rosetta Stone, and Phylogenetic profiles. These methods have been shown to be powerful tools
and this paper provides guidelines for when each method is appropriate by exploring different features of each method and
potential improvements offered by their combination. We also review many previous treatments of these prediction methods,
use the latest available annotations, and offer a number of new observations.
Results: Using Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis, linkage predictions made by each of these methods were evaluated against
three benchmarks: functional categories defined by COG and KEGG, known pathways listed in EcoCyc, and known operons
listed in RegulonDB. Each evaluated method had strengths and weaknesses, with no one method dominating all aspects of
predictive ability studied. For functional categories, as previous studies have shown, the Rosetta Stone method was individually
best at detecting linkages and predicting functions among proteins with shared KEGG categories while the Phylogenetic profile
method was best for linkage detection and function prediction among proteins with common COG functions. Differences in
performance under COG versus KEGG may be attributable to the presence of paralogs. Better function prediction was
observed when using a weighted combination of linkages based on reliability versus using a simple unweighted union of the
linkage sets. For pathway reconstruction, 99 complete metabolic pathways in E. coli K12 (out of the 209 known, non-trivial
pathways) and 193 pathways with 50% of their proteins were covered by linkages from at least one method. Gene neighbor was
most effective individually on pathway reconstruction, with 48 complete pathways reconstructed. For operon prediction, Gene
cluster predicted completely 59% of the known operons in E. coli K12 and 88% (333/418)in B. subtilis. Comparing two versions
of the E. coli K12 operon database, many of the unannotated predictions in the earlier version were updated to true predictions
in the later version. Using only linkages found by both Gene Cluster and Gene Neighbor improved the precision of operon
predictions. Additionally, as previous studies have shown, combining features based on intergenic region and protein function
improved the specificity of operon prediction.
Conclusion: A common problem for computational methods is the generation of a large number of false positives that might
be caused by an incomplete source of validation. By comparing two versions of a database, we demonstrated the dramatic
differences on reported results. We used several benchmarks on which we have shown the comparative effectiveness of each
prediction method, as well as provided guidelines as to which method is most appropriate for a given prediction task.

Background
The number of published sequenced genomes has been
growing in recent years, and at the present time, about
600 microbial genomes are fully sequenced. The next step
after sequencing is to predict genes and their functions
from the sequence. The explosion of sequence information has widened the gap between the number of predicted proteins and the number of experimentally
characterized ones. Escherichia coli K12 is best characterized, but still has 15% of genes with unknown function
[1]. Other genomes have between 15% and 70% uncharacterized genes.
The best established method for function prediction is
based on sequence homology to proteins of known function. Unfortunately, strictly homology-based predictions
are of limited use due to the large number of homologous
protein families with no known function for any member
[2-4]. Another way to assess the function of a sequence is
through identification of its interactions with other proteins [5]. Interaction between proteins can be either physical or functional. In recent years, several computational
methods for predicting protein-protein interactions have
been developed. Machine learning methods [6-9] predict
either functional relationships or physical linkages
between proteins using a variety of information sources,
including sequence information, expression data and
localization data among others. Machine learning
approaches typically require strong positive and negative
set of examples, both of which may be difficult to obtain.
Co-evolution methods [10-12] use phylogenetic trees to
uncover potential protein linkages by identifying correlations in evolutionary histories. As such, these methods
rely strongly on the availability and accuracy of phylogenetic trees. A third alternative to identify putative functional linkages between proteins are genomic context
methods. The four major genomic context methods are:
Gene cluster [13-15], Gene neighbor [16-18], and Rosetta
Stone [19,20], and Phylogenetic profiles [21].
The Gene cluster (GC) method identifies operons within
a microbial genome using intergenic distance as a predictor of operon structure [13-15]. Proteins belonging to the
same operon are transcribed together, often because they
have similar functional roles, participate in the same pathway, or bind to each other. Regardless of the nature of the
linkage, we will refer to the relationship by the general
term of 'functional linkage.' From a GC predicted operon,
functional linkages can be inferred between adjacent
genes. In contrast to GC for a single genome, the Gene
neighbor (GN) method links genes that occur as chromosomal neighbors in multiple genomes thereby uncovering
evolutionarily conserved operons [16-18]. The Rosetta
Stone (RS) method predicts that distinct non-homolo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/397

gous genes have a functional linkage if their orthologs are
fused in another organism [19,20].
The Phylogenetic profiles (PP) method predicts linkages
among pairs of genes by determining whether they tend to
be present or absent together in a set of reference genomes
[21]. Previous studies evaluating the PP method have suggested ways to improve the prediction of protein-proteins
linkages using variants of this method [22-27]. We have
previously described how co-conservation networks
(based on Phylogenetic profiles) vary with the selection of
a reference group [25] and how co-conserved networks
across well chosen sets of species can provide insight into
the function of proteins that act in coherent biological
processes [28]. We have also assessed the topological
characteristics of bacterial co-conservation networks for
the purpose of using such characteristics to improve protein function prediction [29].
Given the variety among these functional linkage prediction methods, the purpose of this paper is to provide
insight into the tasks for which each method is most
appropriate. Using first a benchmark of function prediction, we test whether each prediction method can uncover
shared functional relationships among proteins. However, the various databases describing functional categories capture different aspects of biological relationships
and the ability to predict those categories then depends on
differences among the linkage prediction methods. The
benchmarks are those commonly considered yet most
studies simply report the overall coverage and accuracy of
a prediction method for a given benchmark, rather than a
breakdown by category. A notable exception is the study
by Jothi et al., (2007) which shows a difference in prediction accuracy over specific pathways when varying the set
of reference genomes for a phylogenetic profile method
[27]. Sun et al., (2007) showed that accuracy of predictions by phylogenetic profile method can be improved by
using a set of genomes which are maximally distinct from
one another [26]. The set of pre-compiled predicted protein linkages that were used in this analysis were obtained
using all available organisms at their time of implementation [22]. We investigate which prediction method is most
appropriate for a given category of proteins, a finding that
is of interest to those who study a particular protein and
might wonder from which resource to extract information
about potential linkage. We recognize that the selection of
the reference set can influence the phylogenetic profile
results.
A second benchmark of reconstructing pathways evaluates
whether the predicted linkages occur among proteins
known to participate in the same biological process
[20,21]. The pathway information was tested using EcoCyc [30] a carefully curated database of E. coli K12 path-

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:397

ways. Though the KEGG categorization also describes
pathways, the EcoCyc resource is more specific and its
sparser coverage does not permit the same analysis used
for COG and KEGG. The ability to reconstruct an EcoCyc
pathway was measured by counting the number of proteins in each known pathway which are connected by the
predicted linkages to at least one other pathway member.
A third benchmark involves operon prediction using predicted linkages from the Gene cluster method. Previous
studies have shown that operons tend to have short distances between their genes in bacteria [31,32]. Unfortunately, predictions based on intergenic distance alone aim
to increase sensitivity so other sources of information
must be added to bring the specificity to an acceptable
level. Progress has been made toward a more generalized
method for operon prediction based on a variety of
diverse information sources, including codon usage statistics[33,34], and identification of promoter and terminator sequences [32,35,36]. However, very little has been
done to examine the relative contribution of these features, individually and in combination, for operon prediction in genomes other than the genome(s) on which a
prediction program is trained. In the few cases where
cross-species application has been applied, the conclusions have been mixed [7,14]. The differences in portability of operon predictors might depend on the type and
amount of information used for training, as suggested by
Westover et al. 2005 [9]. We focus here on evaluating the
most generally agreed upon feature, namely intergenic
distance, alone and in combination with other features
and investigate how the growing coverage in the databases
themselves profoundly affects the reported accuracies.
We validate predicted Gene cluster functional linkages
against known operons from E. coli K12 and B. subtilis
because only these two organisms have a substantial
number of experimentally verified operons. We examine
whether features based on intergenic distance and protein
function prove informative for both genomes. Moreover,
we examine how combining linkages predicted by the
other genomic context methods can improve Gene cluster
operon prediction. We recognize that many of the methods being evaluated have been trained on E. coli K12 and
B. subtilis data, so there may be some bias toward overestimation of accuracy when applied to other organisms.
However, the general trends found are likely to hold up
across a wide range of organisms.
Several studies have addressed the correlations between
various genomic context and functional linkages
[22,23,37-39]. Huynen et al. (2003) studied the correlation of individual linkages predicted by different genomic
context methods in Mycoplasma genitalium. By using a
combination of genomic context and homology search,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/397

they inferred new functional features for 10% of M. genitalium genes [37]. Other studies combined linkages from
genomic context methods and their results showed that
integrations of data outperform individual methods
[38,39]. The STRING database provides a large collection
of protein-protein linkages for a number of organisms
from high-throughput experimental data, literature, and
genomic context methods [39]. InPrePPI integrates protein linkages predicted by four genomic context methods
and perform a systematic evaluation on these methods
[38].
This study serves as a partial review of the many previous
treatments of these prediction methods, yet offers a
number of new observations. We use the latest available
annotations such that our results represent an update to
previous reports, allowing evaluation on a much larger set
of annotations than available previously. Unlike previous
studies which present overall conclusions on a number of
benchmarks, we highlight the unique features of each
genomic context method, with specific examples of where
each method should best be applied, depending on the
category of the protein(s) of interest. Also, beyond showing the concordance of functional characterization among
linked proteins, we also provide an unbiased cross-validation study of function prediction methods which makes
use of networks constructed from the linkages. By examining the performance of all four methods on the same
benchmarks, we can provide potential explanations for
the cause of the variable performance. Lastly, by presenting results on two versions of an annotation database, we
can demonstrate how a changing benchmark might cause
dramatic differences on reported results.

Results
Network topology using different sets of linkages
Protein functional linkages were extracted from the Prolinks database [22] and coverage of the number of linkages for the E. coli K12 genome varied depending on the
confidence threshold (Table 1). Prolinks used all the
available genomes (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes) at
the time of their implementation. Previous studies have
shown that accuracy of predictions can be improved by
using a set of genomes which are maximally distinct from
one another [25-27]. PP and GN offered the largest set of
linkages at any threshold, with no linkages given at a high
confidence level for GC. The large set of predicted linkages
by GN is consistent with the previous report by Huynen et
al. [37]. Among the set of 9,623 linkages predicted by any
method at a threshold of 0.6 (used in all further results),
there was very little overlap among the methods: 8,347
(87%) linkages appeared in only one method, 1,129
(12%) appeared in two methods, 127 (1%) appeared in
three methods and only 20 (<1%) linkages were predicted
by all methods (Table 1, Figure 1 center).

Protein-protein networks constructed from the predicted
linkages also varied depending on the method used for
prediction (Figure 1). The Gene cluster (GC) method, by
definition, predicted small linear networks of proteins
according to their gene order within an operon, while use
of the remaining methods resulted in both small and large
highly inter-connected clusters of proteins. Tight, functionally homogeneous clusters were seen in all graphs
when colored by functional category.
The difference in network topology was quantified by a
number of measures (Table 2). The clustering coefficient
is defined as the edge density among the neighbors of a
node [40]. The average clustering coefficient for the GN
and PP networks was high. The RS network had a low clustering coefficient which suggested proteins were sparsely
clustered. The methods showed an analogous trend in the
average degree of connectivity, where PP and GN had similar high average connectivity. Sparse connectivity was
found in RS (Table 2) indicating that there were fewer
hubs (nodes with high connectivity) in this network.
Functional Characterization of Interacting Proteins
Most proteins involved in the predicted linkages could be
tested for concordance with either Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genome (KEGG) [41] categories or Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COG) functional categories [1].
The overall coverage was calculated as the percentage of
proteins annotated by the source having at least one linkage predicted by a given method. Of the 2,587 proteins
annotated to a COG category, the percent coverage per
method was 69% (GC), 63% (GN), 39% (PP) and 26%
(RS) while for the 1,936 proteins annotated to a KEGG
category, the coverage was 67% (GC), 69% (GN), 40%
(PP) and 27% (RS). The differences in percentages

roughly followed the differences in the total number of
proteins appearing in linkages for each method (Figure 1
inset), and the percentage of coverage of each method was
similar whether using COG or KEGG categories.
Only when examining these benchmarks by category did
the two benchmarks show differences (Figure 2). Measuring concordance to each functional category as the percentage of proteins annotated to a category for which each
method offered any linkages, the range of percent coverage of all methods was between 2–15% for COG, yet
ranged from 2–85% for KEGG subcategory (Figure 2a–b).
Moreover, GC and GN appeared to have much higher relative coverage than PP and RS for KEGG subcategories,
while all methods had similar patterns of coverage for
COG categories. This is consistent with the previous
report by Sun et al. [38]. Given that the overall percent
coverage of a given method was the same for COG as for
KEGG as discussed above, we hypothesize that these differences were due to differences in the biological descriptions offered by these benchmarks. Thus, it is important to
consider the methods at the level of the categories, not just
the overall performance per benchmark, as has been done
in most previous work.
When viewed per category, the methods were biased in
their predictions toward proteins of a particular functional category. High coverage was observed in all methods for proteins annotated as signal transduction (KEGG
4, COG T), or membrane transport proteins (KEGG 3),
whereas proteins involved in secretion and vesicular
transport (COG U), biosynthesis of secondary metabolism (KEGG 18, COG Q) and xenobiotics biodegradation
and metabolism (KEGG 19) had the least coverage in linkage predictions (Figure 2a–c). The abundance or lack of

coverage has implications for later uses of the networks
when studying proteins of these classes.
For particular classes of proteins, one or more prediction
method showed better relative coverage for proteins. GN
and GC were most effective at predicting linkages involving known proteins involved in folding sorting, degradation (KEGG 7, 65% and 60% of the proteins annotated to
this category for GN and GC, respectively), and cell

growth and cell death (KEGG 2, 80% and 83% respectively). These results suggest that many of the operons
encoded in E. coli K12 may be highly biased toward proteins with these functional categories. Among the proteins
considered by PP and RS, the most highly covered categories involved known signal transduction proteins (KEGG
4, 49% and 32% respectively) and known membrane
transport proteins (KEGG 3, 37% and 30% respectively).

Concordance of predictions to annotation sources was
then measured on the level of linkages rather than on the
level of proteins (Figure 2d–e). The original paper describing the prediction methods reported that GN showed the
most accurate and extensive coverage with respect to COG
categories [22]. Our results serve as an update of those
results. Despite the relatively higher coverage of GC and
GN when measured at the level of proteins (Figure 2b–c),
PP and RS generally showed stronger concordance by
more often linking proteins assigned the same function
than did GC or GN (Figure 2d). Nearly all 20 linkages
found by all methods (AND) involved characterized proteins (Figure 2e) and most of the linkages linked proteins
which had the same functional assignment (Figure 2d).
For the uncharacterized proteins, GC had the highest percentage of linkages with at least one uncharacterized pro-

tein (Figure 2d) and hence could make predictions for
some unknowns. Overall, the predicted linkages involving uncharacterized proteins from any of the methods are
a valuable source of new hypotheses, as it is possible to
infer function of unclassified proteins or gain a better
understanding of the role of proteins through their connections with other proteins.
Function Prediction Results
The function of an uncharacterized protein can be
inferred from the functions assigned to its neighboring
proteins in a linkage network. Overall, RS and PP networks proved most useful for function prediction. The
quality of the linkage networks offered by each method
was assessed using a cross-validation study of function
prediction accuracy.

Page 6 of 21

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:397

The cross validation study was performed on proteins of
known function by selectively hiding the function of one
subset and predicting the function of the remaining proteins. Of the classified proteins with at least one classified
neighbor in each network (GC: [2,033 and 1,206 proteins], GN: [1,729 and 1,213 proteins], PP: [946 and 715
proteins] and RS: [661 and 459 proteins] respectively
according to COG and KEGG), 10% of the classified proteins were taken at random as the test set. Then these functions were hidden and predicted from quantities
computed on the remaining 90% of classified proteins
(training set). Functions were either assigned using a baseline method of assigning uniformly at random from
among the protein categories (UNIF) or as the majority
function of the immediate neighbors of a protein
(MAJORITY). The percentage of correct predictions was
recorded over 100 random partitions into training and
test sets, using networks from the GC, GN, RS and PP
methods (Figure 3). Proteins which had no classified
neighbors as a result of creating the test set were not considered in the percent correct count.
Both the RS and PP methods showed the greatest increase
over the baseline method, regardless of the annotation
source. Interestingly, GN and GC showed lower performances despite often having comparable percentages of
linkages with shared function (Figure 2e). This suggests
that while the overall majority of linkages shared the same
function in these networks, the majority of neighbors of a
node did not, further highlighting the differences in
topology of the individual networks.
Differences in Nature of Annotation Source
On the surface, the two functional annotation sources
used here assessed similar notions of functional relationships, often sharing many similar categories (Figure 2 legends). Moreover, the general intuition behind each
linkage prediction method involved an evolutionary tendency to optimize the cellular program by conserving sets
of genes or increasing the proximity of related genes. It
was therefore interesting that one method did not prove
to be the best for both annotation sources. Overall, RS was
individually best at preserving COG relationships while
PP was best when using KEGG (Figure 2d). These results
foreshadowed the relative differences in cross-validation
performances (Figure 3), including the poor cross validation performance of GN which also had the lowest percentage of linkages sharing the same KEGG category.

Together with the observed differences in the category
coverage results discussed earlier (Figure 2), these results
suggested the two resources differed in how assignments
were made to individual proteins. One possible explanation for the difference in COG and KEGG assignments
may stem from the fact that COG functional assignments

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/397

were made at the level of COG identifiers, whereby all
members of the orthologous group were assigned the
same set of COG functions [42]. It is well known that
since COG identifiers were created from sequence homology, one disadvantage is that a COG identifier may associate paralogous genes. We investigated whether the
existence of paralogs could explain the difference between
RS and PP, in particular.
The potential existence of paralogs was investigated using
the KEGG categorization among proteins assigned to
COG ids. Of the 503 COG ids populated by E. coli K12
proteins among the RS and PP linkages, 361 had at least
one protein annotated to a KEGG (sub)category. Of these,
only 110 COG ids had the same KEGG function appearing among all annotated members, while only 93 COG
ids had the same KEGG subcategory appearing among all
members. That meant that nearly 66% of the annotated
COG ids appearing among RS and PP linkages had at least
one pair of proteins with distinct KEGG (sub)categories,
suggesting that the original COG id assignments indeed
grouped paralogous proteins.
The effect of paralogous proteins could therefore explain
the difference in performance between RS and PP in preserving linkages among proteins in the same KEGG or
COG functional category. Consider the argument that
paralogous proteins are not likely to be fused (RS) yet
might be present or absent concordantly (PP). This intuition was supported by the fact that among the predicted
linkages from any method which were annotated by both
functional sources, PP offered more of those linkages than
RS where the COG function was the same for the linked
proteins but the KEGG function was not (PP = 12%, RS =
5%, GC = 8%, GN = 8%). In fact, of all linkages offered by
PP, 27% involve protein pairs assigned the same COG id
(versus 10% of RS linkages, 8% of GC linkages and 0.4%
of GN linkages). These results support the hypothesis that
the improved performance of PP over RS on COG categories may be due to the ability of PP to detect paralogous
genes.
Function Prediction from Combinations of Methods
Combining the sets of linkages from multiple prediction
methods should allow for more accurate results than can
be attained by any single method alone. Previous studies
using different sets of linkages and other species have
combined various sources such as mRNA co-expression,
experimental data, literature, and phylogenetic profiles
[39,43,44]. Until now two main approaches have been
used to combine these data sets: 1) Reduce the number of
possible relationships by looking at the overlap between
data sources (AND case) or 2) Integrate all possible
sources (OR case), often taking into account the reliability
of each source. For the AND case, only 20 linkages were

identified by all methods. In all of the predicted linkages,
both proteins were assigned the same COG category if
annotated. The OR case provided predictions for 9,632
linkages, but less than 59% of proteins involved in these
linkages had annotations in COG.
Examples of integrating linkages from multiple methods
(OR case) where the reliabilities of the methods vary
include the STRING database [39] and the InPrePPI database [38], both of which probabilistically combine linkage confidences. The STRING database calculates a
combined score for each pair of proteins using the
assumption that the features from various sources are
independent [39]. The InPrePPI database calculates the
reliability of each of the four genomic context methods
then optimally weights the score of each method and
finally integrates the score. We considered two options:
using reliabilities assigned to all linkages from a given
method (Noisy-ORmeth) or using reliabilities assigned per
linkage based on the confidence level provided by the Prolinks database (Noisy-ORconf). Given a network created by
integrating multiple sources of linkages, function predictions could be made by taking the majority function vote
of the immediate neighbors as in the previous cross-validation study. However, in this case, varying reliability
across linkages could be incorporated in the function prediction algorithm by instead taking a weighted vote
among immediate neighbors, where each linkage was
weighted proportionally to the reliability of that linkage.

Pathway reconstruction Results
The EcoCyc database [30] offered well curated descriptions of pathways, involving between 1 and 46 proteins
per pathway. The granularity of the EcoCyc assignments
resulted such low coverage (Figure 2d–e) that we could
not treat this resource in the same manner as the COG and
KEGG resources. Thus, we instead evaluated the EcoCyc
benchmark in terms of pathway reconstruction. A pathway was considered to be completely reconstructed by a
method if 100% of the proteins annotated to the pathway
could be connected to at least one other member of the
pathway through linkages predicted by the method. Of
the 209 known (non-trivial) pathways documented in
EcoCyc, we were able to reconstruct 99 complete pathways by at least one of the methods. The trehalose degradation II pathway (3 members) was the only pathway
where no method contained linkages connecting at least
two pathway members. The GN method was most effective at pathway reconstruction, detecting linkages among
all proteins listed in 48 complete pathways (Figure 5). At
least 50% of the proteins in 193 pathways were predicted
to connect to the correct pathway by at least one method.
The poor performance of PP relative to GC was especially
surprising since PP predicted nearly twice as many linkages as GC and our definition of reconstruction favored
more highly connected graphs.

We were interested in identifying the most effective
method among the three integration strategies, namely
the unweighted OR graph and the two weighting strategies involving Noisy-OR (Figure 4). Under the same crossvalidation scheme as before, the distributions of percentage correct predictions over the 100 random runs for each
pair of strategies were compared using a standard t-test for
equal means. Both of the weighted combination strategies, Noisy-ORmeth and Noisy-ORconf, showed improvement over the unweighted OR with a slight preference for
Noisy-ORmeth (Noisy-ORmeth vs OR p < 0.001 (COG,
KEGG subcategory and p = 0.0049 (KEGG)) and NoisyORmeth vs Noisy-ORconf p < 0.001 (COG, KEGG subcategory) and p = 0.0213 (KEGG)). These results suggested
that assigning reliabilities per method was a more effective strategy than estimating edge-wise reliabilities.

Operon Prediction Results
The accuracy of protein linkages predicted by Gene cluster
(GC) were evaluated against known operons for E. coli
K12 [45] and B. subtilis [46] (Table 3, Figure 6). For E. coli
K12, the GC method predicted completely 489 out of 830
known operons (59%) listed in the June 2007 version of
RegulonDB (Figure 6a). There were 152 operons in E. coli
K12 that were missed completely by GC. We analyzed all
of the missed operons and noted that some of the missed
operons were the result of change in annotation based on
the length of the intergenic region. The cases involving
unclassified or non-operon proteins were of particular
interest since they represented novel predictions. In fact,
an increase in the number of linkages within operons
(gray nodes become blue nodes) in the side-by-side comparison with an earlier release of RegulonDB (Table 3, Figure 6b) dramatically highlighted that many of the
linkages predicted by GC had indeed later been recognized as correct operons by RegulonDB.

While the performance of the combined network was similar to using RS or PP individually, the results were
remarkable given that the same level of performance was
seen with a great increase in coverage offered by the combination of networks (from predicting functions for
nearly 776 proteins in the individual graphs to predicting
2,574 in the combined graph).

Analogously, linkages predicted by GC in B. subtilis were
compared against known operons listed in the September
2007 version of the DBTBS database (Table 3, Figure 6c).
The GC method predicted completely 333 out of 418
known operons. There were 24 missed operons. The
decreased percentages (Table 3) reflected the sparser coverage of the DBTBS database relative to RegulonDB; in fact

Improving predictions using combinations of methods
The predictive performance of GC in E. coli K12 could be
improved by comparing the linkages found with GC
against those found by other methods. We considered a
true positive (TP) when both proteins involved in a linkage had a functional annotation in EcoCyc and were
known to reside in the same operon by RegulonDB and a
false positive (FP) when at least one of the classified proteins was not listed by RegulonDB to be in the same
operon. The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the set of

GC linkages was calculated as PPV = TP/(TP+FP). Calculating the PPV depends on the completeness of the available sources. In fact, the PPV of GC linkages comparing
two versions of RegulonDB showed an increase from 0.47
(Jan 2006) to 0.82 (Jun 2007). Thus, assessments of false
positive linkages must be taken as provisional. Restricting
the set of TP and FP linkages to be among only functionally annotated proteins was also meant to improve the
chances that the false positives were indeed false.
Removing linkages in GC also predicted by PP or also predicted by RS resulted in no significant change in PPV
(from 82% to 81%, Figure 6d). This suggested that dis-

tance between proteins was a more informative and decisive factor than co-conservation or gene fusion for
prediction of operons. However, removing linkages from
GC also predicted by the GN method showed a significant
decrease in PPV (from 82% to 73%). This indicated that
the additional support of observing neighboring genes in
multiple genomes, as seen in the linkages common to GN,
accounted for a large part of the information captured by
GC linkages. Moreover, this suggested that linkages common to GC and GN were likely to be correct predictions.
Considering only linkages predicted by both GC and GN
resulted in an increase of PPV from 82% to 87%. Given
the use of multiple genomes in PP, RS and GN, one might
assume that operons missed when combinations of methods were used were specific to E. coli K12.

A similar pattern of intergenic distances also emerged in B.
subtilis (Table 3, Figure 7). We noted that many FP linkages had an intergenic distance <25 (46%) bases. The
expansion of validated operon annotation in E. coli suggests these linkages for B. subtilis might actually be true
positives which are currently annotated incorrectly.

Improving predictions through analysis of intergenic distance
Many different methods have proven to be valid predictors of operon structure (Table 4) yet most striking is that
among all these studies, one of the most valuable predictors has simply been intergenic distance. We found that
predicted operon linkage pairs with intergenic distances
greater than 50 bases were more likely to be false positives
(Table 4, Figure 7). In E. coli K12, 74% of the false positive
linkage predictions involved proteins with intergenic dis-

Previous studies showed operon prediction improved
when considering intergenic distance and whether proteins appeared in the same pathway [7,32,47]. We noted
that 64% of predicted TP linkages with known COG classification for both proteins involved proteins in the same
functional category; however only 22% of FP linkages
were between proteins in the same functional category.
While the combination of intergenic region and functional categories will improve specificity of operon predic-

tances >50 bases in contrast to only 14% of true positives
with intergenic distances >50. The median intergenic difference also differed widely between the true positives (10
bases) and false positives (74 bases). A side by side comparison to an earlier version of RegulonDB (Figure 7a–b)
demonstrated that many of the false positives in the earlier version with shorter intergenic distances were resolved
to be true positives in the later version of RegulonDB.

Discussion
The field of predicting protein-protein linkages has been
active for more than two decades, but the application of
computational methods for predicting protein linkages
has only become popular in the past several years. Predicting which proteins interact in the cell is important in deciphering the function of proteins.
Computational approaches provide us with more information than the traditional homology approach, in which
protein function is predicted based upon similarity to

other proteins with known function. Even though the
strict homology-based methods are effective for predicting protein functions of evolving close homologs, the
methods perform poorly on distantly related proteins.
Even a sophisticated homology-based method fails to successfully assign functions to all proteins of a particular
organism [48]. Alternative approaches offer the benefit of
being able to extract, combine, or compare information
from a number of different sources, including information such as close physical location for a linkage in a
genome, evolutionary conservation among multiple species, and similar association in different types of genomic
context. These computational methods utilize the contexts in which the protein exists and thus can be useful in
determining the role of many unclassified proteins.

We have looked at four genomic context computational
methods for predicting protein functional linkages, comparing their performance on several prediction benchmarks. No one method dominated all benchmarks, in fact
each method proved most effective for a distinct task.
Gene neighborhood worked best for EcoCyc pathway
reconstruction, Rosetta Stone for KEGG functional categories, and Phylogenetic profiles for COG functional categories.
The fourth method, Gene cluster (GC), is a conceptually
simple method to identify potential operons. There are
several other studies using computational methods to recognize regulatory elements in bacteria DNA (Table 4).
Not all methods use the same definition of what constitutes a true positive so the quoted values are not strictly
comparable and should be taken as indications only.
Despite the particular differences, however, all methods
tend to agree that intergenic distance alone allows approximately 82% recall. In addition to intergenic distance,
these methods use a variety of other information, including codon usage statistics, gene expression data and regulatory features. The emphasis in these studies has been
operon prediction in E. coli K12 and the transfer of methodology to other organisms has been met with mixed
results. One study [14] found that an operon predictor
based on intergenic distance in E. coli K12 worked equally

well when applied to known operons of B. subtilis.
Another previous study [7] reported 91% prediction accuracy when trained on E. coli K12 but accuracy reduced to
64% when tested on B. subtilis. One potential cause for the
drop in performance lies in the incompleteness of the
gold standard annotation source, as suggested by our
results comparing different database versions. Figure 6, 7,
together with Table 3, provide an immediate visual appreciation of the effect of database changes on reported
results.
Our results showed GC was able to identify approximately
78% of the known operon pairs in E. coli K12 with 82%
precision. We improved specificity of operon prediction
by combining predicted linkages found by both GC and
GN methods but to the detriment of sensitivity (Figure
6d). We also showed how the combination of intergenic
and function information improved the accuracy of
operon prediction. With these results on known operons,
we also report a high percentage of unclassified proteins
among linkages predicted by the GC method.
Another of the approaches, Gene neighborhood (GN),
assumes that proteins located in a close neighborhood on
the genome may have some functional commonalities.
Such neighborhood relations occasionally are effective at
predicting biological processes [16,18,20]. We recon-

functional annotation in EcoCyc (DBTBS) and were known to reside in the same operon by RegulonDB (DBTBS) and a false

structed 48 known E. coli pathways using the predicted
GN linkages. Our result is consistent with previous findings that GC or GN method had the highest AC (accuracy+coverage) using EcoCyc annotation than the other
genomic context [38] (Figure 2d).
Rosetta Stone (RS) screens genomes for sequences that
appear as two different proteins in one genome but are
fused to create a single protein-chain in another genome.
Fusion can facilitate kinetic coupling of consecutive
enzymes in pathways or other forms of functional linkage
between proteins. Our results showed that 30% of known
membrane transporter proteins in KEGG (145 out of 489
proteins) are fused and 19% of the proteins in linkages
found by RS method were membrane transporters (145
out of 776). Previous studies have shown that fusion
events are common in Environmental information
processing proteins [22]. The high coverage of the RS in
Energy production and conversion (C), Amino acid trans-

port and metabolism (E) and Signal transduction mechanism (T) proteins using COG annotation source is
consistent with the Yanai et al. report [49] (Figure 2a). Previous findings confirm our result that RS method has the
highest AC (accuracy+coverage) using the KEGG annotation source than the other genomic context [38] (Figure
2b). Previous studies have noted a high coverage of the RS
method in metabolism proteins using KEGG annotation,
and we also noted that the nucleotide metabolism proteins constitute one of the functional categories for which
the RS method had a high coverage [38,50] (Figure 2b).
Our assessment showed a large percentage of linkages predicted by Phylogenetic profiles (PP) were assigned the
same COG functional category. The stronger performance
of PP over the other methods we suspect can be traced to
the method of assigning COG function uniformly to all
members of a given COG cluster and the strong presence
of paralogs linked to PP. Nearly 28% of the linkages

Page 16 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:397

offered by PP were among proteins assigned to the same
COG cluster identifier, which then received the same
COG functional assignments, yet only 47% of these were
assigned a common KEGG function. The ability to detect
paralogs therefore may be the cause for the advantage of
PP over the other methods in predicting COG function.
Jothi et al., reported a high specificity in membrane transporter proteins when the reference set was composed of
genomes from all three super-kingdoms (similar to our
reference set) and this is consistent with our findings [27]
(Figure 2b).
Using a network based approach for predicting protein
function from neighbors in the network, we again found
that RS was most successful at predicting KEGG functions
while PP was most successful for COG function. Our
results showed function predictions made using a
weighted integration of linkages from methods greatly
improved coverage while maintaining high sensitivity.
The low overlap of linkages predicted by more than one
method (<18%) did not allow strong discrimination
among different weighting strategies though assignment
of a single reliability value to all linkages from a method
was slightly preferred over reliability assessments per linkage (Figure 4).
The methods of GC, GN, RS and PP all produced a large
number of false positives. The main caveat of these methods is not always abundantly clear as to which linkages are
real and which ones are false positives. Our results show
these methods may not be an absolutely reliable predictor
of a functional relation since there exists a large number
of putative false positives which show linkage to functionally unrelated proteins. Nor can these methods differentiate among interacting and non-interacting homologs.
For any given method, without a filtering strategy, the
high number of apparent false positives and false negatives is unavoidable However, as more detailed protein
linkage databases become available, the total number of
correctly identified linkage will rise while error rates will
decrease. At this stage it is difficult to accurately assess specificity and sensitivity of computational methods because
curated databases of genes and proteins are not available.
As we showed, the precision of operon predictions
increased from 47% to 82% by side-by-side comparison
of two different releases of the RegulonDB database.

Conclusion
Computational methods for protein-protein linkage have
changed our perspective toward understanding proteins
and their biological roles. They have provided an understanding of protein function intercellular sub-networks.
Each of the most common methods, Gene cluster, Gene
neighbor, Phylogenetic profiles, and Rosetta Stone have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/397

certain levels of effectiveness but they also have limitations that affect the reliability of functional interpretations of the linkages they predict. We used the latest
available annotations and our results represent an update
on previous findings and offer a number of new observations. Using several benchmarks we provided guidelines
as to which method was most appropriate for a given prediction task. We demonstrated how changing the benchmark causes the dramatic difference on reported results.

Methods
Protein-protein linkages
Currently, several databases that compile functional linkages from genomic context predictions are available,
including Prolinks [22], STRING [39], PLEX [23], Predictome [51]and more recently InPrePPI [38]. We used the
Prolinks v2.0 database as a source of predictions because
it implements all of the four functional prediction methods and is publicly available. Prolinks has better coverage
than Predictome and unlike Predictome or PLEX, Prolinks
uses a probabilistic scoring scheme to assign a confidence
level to each functional linkage. The STRING and
InPrePPI databases also provide probabilistic scores but
STRING does not provide Gene cluster linkages and the
Gene cluster definition in InPrePPI requires operon conservation across species which will miss operons which
are genome specific [38].

We mapped accession IDs from Prolinks v2.0 predicted
linkages to NCBI [1] and then to EcoCyc [30] for E. coli
K12. An E-value of less than 10-10 was used as the threshold for BLASTP in Prolinks to define a homolog of a query
protein to be present in a secondary genome. In total, Prolinks lists 72,202 (27,339 unique) protein linkages for E.
coli K12 using either the Gene cluster (GC), Gene neighbor (GN), Rosetta Stone (RS) or Phylogenetic profiles
(PP) method (Table 1). Over one third of the linkages
(9,623 out of 27,339 predicted linkages), were predicted
with a confidence level of at least 0.6 using the Prolinks
scoring scheme [22]. There were no predictions for GC
above 0.7 or below 0.5 (Table 1). All reported results used
the set of linkages found using the > 0.6 confidence level
threshold.
Generating the protein-protein linkage network
Networks were created and presented as graphs in which
each protein is represented as a node and a linkage
between proteins is represented by an edge. An edge
existed between two nodes if the corresponding Prolinks
linkage confidence score exceeded the threshold of 0.6
(Figure 1). For separation of connected components of

open-source, platform-independent environment for visualizing biological networks.
Analyzing the topology of the network
The degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges
connected to that node and nodes that are joined by an
edge are said to be adjacent. A neighbor of a given node i
is a node adjacent to i. The clustering coefficient C indicates the degree to which k neighbors of a particular node
are connected to each other. Let ki be the number of neighbors of node i and ni be the number of edges in the network that exist among the neighbors of i. The clustering
coefficient of node i was calculated as [40]

Ci = 2ni/ki* (ki-1).
The average clustering coefficient was calculated by averaging C over all nodes i.
Benchmark Annotation Sources
The accession IDs from predicted linkages were mapped
to NCBI, and then to EcoCyc and KEGG. There were some
disagreements about the number of proteins in E. coli
K12: EcoCyc had entries for 4,449 proteins while the
NCBI genome entry had 4,245 proteins, and 3,924 of
these had a predicted linkage in Prolinks. While some proteins may have no predicted linkages by any method
(reducing the number of proteins found in Prolinks), the
discrepancy between EcoCyc and NCBI is unexplained.
Pathways and operons defined in EcoCyc were sometimes
supplemented with literature searches and with the NCBI,
COG and KEGG databases, described below.

The NCBI Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) [53]
database classifies E. coli K12 proteins into the following
19 functional categories: Not classified (-); Energy production and conversion (C); Cell division and chromosome
partitioning (D); Amino acid transport and metabolism
(E); Nucleotide transport and metabolism (F); Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G); Lipid metabolism
(H); Coenzyme metabolism (I); Translation, ribosomal
structure and biogenesis (J); Transcription (K); DNA replication, recombination and repair(L); Cell motility and
secretion (N); Cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane
(M); Posttranslational modification, protein turnover,
chaperones (O); Inorganic ion transport and metabolism
(P); Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and
catabolism (Q); Signal transduction mechanism (T);
Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport
(U); and Defense mechanisms (V).
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
[41]database classifies proteins into four functional categories (19 sub-functional categories): Cellular Processes
(Cell Motility (1); Cell Growth and Death (2)), Environ-

mental Information Processing (Membrane Transport

Metabolism (15); Biosynthesis of Polypeptides and Non
ribosomal Peptide (16); Metabolism of Cofactors and
Vitamins (17); Biosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites
(18); Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism (19)).
Function Benchmark and Prediction Cross Validation
Two proteins were said to share the same function if they
were assigned the same category by COG or KEGG. The
percentage of linkages where the linked proteins shared
the same function was calculated for each annotation
source.

The set of classified proteins with at least one classified
neighbor in each network (Phylogenetic profile, Rosetta
Stone and Gene neighbor) was extracted to yield sets of
size [946, 1,729 and 662] proteins by COG and [715,
1,213 and 459] proteins by KEGG for [PP, RS and GN]
respectively (KEGG sub-category was equivalent to
KEGG). The set of classified proteins was then divided
uniformly at random into training (90%) and testing
(10%) sets. The functions of the proteins in the training
set were hidden and predicted from methods applied to
the training set, and the percentage of correctly predicted
function assignments to proteins was calculated over 100
cross validation splits. Predictions were made either sampling uniformly at random (UNIF) from the set of categories (COG 19 categories, KEGG 4 categories and KEGG 19
subcategories), or taking the function assigned to the
majority of immediate neighbors (MAJOR) in the network (ties were broken randomly).
Comparisons between two methods were made by comparing the distribution of percent correct predictions from
the 100 random runs of one method to another. Significance of the difference in means of these two distributions
was measured using the two-sample t-test on the two sets
of 100 values.
Combinations of methods
We combined different sets of linkages predicted by GC,
GN, RS or PP at Prolinks confidence 0.6. The overlap
among all methods (AND) contained 20 linkages over 39
proteins and the set from at least one method (OR) contained 9,632 linkages over 3,323 proteins. The combined
set of linkages predicted by GN, RS and PP at confidence
level 0.6 (8,829 linkages among 2,574 proteins) was used
in a cross validation setting for function prediction using

a 90/10 split for training/testing over 100 random splits as
before. Using this subset of linkages to define a network,
we again compared the prediction method of assigning
function uniformly at random (UNIF) against the majority assignment (MAJOR) prediction method. However, in
this setting for MAJOR, we compared using the
unweighted majority vote (OR) versus using a weighted
vote where weights were assigned using the Noisy-Or
model [39,44]with two schemes for assigning reliabilities.
The Noisy-OR [39,44] method calculates a probability for
each linkage (edge) e as:

pr ( e ) = 1 −

∏ (1 − r

method

)

method

where the product ranges over all methods which predict
the linkage. The reliability of a method rmethod was assigned
by either of two strategies: Noisy-ORconf, where rmethod was
the linkage confidence originally assigned by Prolink
(ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 in this setting), and NoisyORmeth, where rmethod was estimated as the average percent
correct predictions from the cross-validation study using
each method individually (Figure 3). For example, rRS =
75.28 for the KEGG subcategory gold standard, as given in
Figure 3. The Noisy-ORconf strategy leveraged the confidence assessments of each linkage separately while the
Noisy-ORmeth strategy of assigning all linkages from a
given method a single value was similar to that used in the
STRING database [39]. The probability of the linkage was
then used in calculating the weighted majority vote functional assignment (MAJOR) when considering the combination of linkages from the genomic context methods.

obtained from DBTBS [46]. The latest version of RegulonDB (June 2007) listed 2,684 transcription units (operons) in E. coli K12, but 1,853 of these were deemed trivial
in that they contained only a single protein. The 831 multiprotein operons contained 2,654 proteins. The earlier
version of RegulonDB (January 2006) listed 770 transcription units (operons) in E. coli K12, but 414 of these
were deemed trivial in that they contained only a single
protein. The 356 multiprotein operons contained 1,261
proteins. DBTBS (September 2007) listed 1,115 transcription units (operons), but 696 of these were deemed trivial
in that they contained only a single protein. The 419 multiprotein operons contained 1,319 proteins. The intergenic distances between predicted protein linkage pairs by
the Gene cluster method for E. coli K12 and B. subtilis were
calculated using the NCBI annotations [1].
We evaluated the GC predicted linkages using Precision
and Recall measures. Precision (also known as Positive
Predictive Value PPV) was calculated as
Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
where we considered a true positive (TP) when both proteins involved in a linkage had a functional annotation in
EcoCyc (DBTBS for B. subtilis) and were known to reside
in the same operon by RegulonDB (DBTBS for B. subtilis)
and a false positive (FP) when at least one of the classified
proteins was not listed by RegulonDB (DBTBS) to be in
the same operon. Recall (also known as Sensitivity) was
calculated as:
Recall = TP/(TP +FN)

Pathway Reconstruction
Each method was tested for its ability to reconstruct
known E. coli pathways, attempting full coverage, by providing linkages connecting known members of the pathway. The pathway information was downloaded from
EcoCyc[30]. There were 239 known pathways documented in EcoCyc, comprised of 2,029 proteins. Each
pathway was given as a list of proteins annotated to the
pathway. The 30 pathways that trivially contained only
one protein were removed from further processing. The
percentage of a pathway reconstructed under each method
was calculated as the percentage of proteins annotated to
the pathway that could be connected to at least one other
member of the pathway through linkages predicted by the
method.

where the number of false negatives (FN) was the number
of linkages missed among those existing in our gold
standard (RegulonDB or DBTBS). The F-measure was then
calculated as
F-measure = (2* Recall*Precision)/(Recall + Precision)
