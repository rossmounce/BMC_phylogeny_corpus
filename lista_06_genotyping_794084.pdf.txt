Abstract
Background: The genome of Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is highly monomorphic which makes
differentiation between strains difficult. A Multiple Locus Variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA)
assay based on 20 markers was previously described. It has considerable discrimination power, reproducibility, and low
cost, especially since the markers proposed can be typed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. However in an emergency
situation, faster genotyping and access to representative databases is necessary.
Results: Genotyping of B. anthracis reference strains and isolates from France and Italy was done using a 25 loci MLVA
assay combining 21 previously described loci and 4 new ones. DNA was amplified in 4 multiplex PCR reactions and the
length of the resulting 25 amplicons was estimated by automated capillary electrophoresis. The results were reproducible
and the data were consistent with other gel based methods once differences in mobility patterns were taken into
account. Some alleles previously unresolved by agarose gel electrophoresis could be resolved by capillary
electrophoresis, thus further increasing the assay resolution. One particular locus, Bams30, is the result of a
recombination between a 27 bp tandem repeat and a 9 bp tandem repeat. The analysis of the array illustrates the
evolution process of tandem repeats.
Conclusion: In a crisis situation of suspected bioterrorism, standardization, speed and accuracy, together with the
availability of reference typing data are important issues, as illustrated by the 2001 anthrax letters event. In this report
we describe an upgrade of the previously published MLVA method for genotyping of B. anthracis and apply the method
to the typing of French and Italian B. anthracis strain collections. The increased number of markers studied compared to
reports using only 8 loci greatly improves the discrimination power of the technique. An Italian strain belonging to the
B branch was described, and two new branches, D and E, are proposed. Owing to the upgrading achieved here, precise
genotyping can now be produced either by automated capillary electrophoresis, or by the more accessible but slower
and for some markers slightly less accurate agarose gel methodology.

Background
Bacillus anthracis, a spore forming Gram positive bacteria,
is the etiological agent of anthrax, a zoonosis with a
worldwide distribution. The disease can be transmitted to
humans by contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. In addition to being an occupational disease, limited to farmers and veterinarians,
anthrax has received considerable attention and is one of
the most feared microorganism with respect to bioterrorism. In 2001, letters containing spores were mailed causing the death of five persons and several cases of
cutaneous anthrax [1]. B. anthracis is a member of the
Bacillus cereus group, containing Bacillus cereus, Bacillus
thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides and B. anthracis [2]. B.
anthracis is characterized by an extremely low genetic variability, making strains differentiation very challenging
[3,4]. The importance of strain differentiation of biothreat
agents including B. anthracis is increasingly recognized as
a way for identifying the source of the attack, as illustrated
not only by the 2001 events but also, earlier on, by the
Sverdlovsk [5] and Tokyo [6] events. Such events together
suggested how crucial is the development of microbial
forensics for biosecurity. Measures aimed at limiting the
risk of deliberate release of dangerous pathogens, would
require that isolates kept in different institutions around
the world are precisely genotyped, and that the genotype
profiles are shared by all countries having accepted to follow these rules, for strain accountability purposes.
Because the molecular methods classically used to differentiate between strains in other species failed to discriminate B. anthracis isolates, new approaches were developed.
Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism in 79 B.
anthracis isolates, 31 polymorphic chromosomal regions
were observed out of 1,000 fragments, and eventually, the
most interesting polymorphisms turned out to be the
result of tandem repeat variations [7]. Tandem repeats
variability was studied most extensively in eukaryotes,
and was shown to be associated with different aspects of
DNA replication and recombination, including replication slippage and double-strand breaks repair [8]. They do
not vary by the same mechanisms which are inducing
point mutations, and the mutation rate at some Variable
Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) loci may be considerably higher than nucleotide substitutions [9-11] in an as
yet not predictable way [12,13]. The level of intraspecific
polymorphism in tandemly repeated sequences varies
from one locus to another and needs to be experimentally
measured by typing representative strain collections.
Approaches based on VNTR analysis (called MLVA for
Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis) are now increasingly used
to characterize in particular recently emerged, highly
monomorphic pathogens including B. anthracis [12,14],
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [15], Yersinia pestis [16]Brucella
[17] (see [18,19] for a review). Multiple alleles can exist in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/33

the population for each tandem repeat locus. One advantage of MLVA typing as compared for instance to SNP
(Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) typing is that a new
isolate can be compared to previously characterised
strains in an unbiased way. One weakness is that the phylogenetic value of MLVA clustering must be carefully
checked and validated by using independent approaches
with less homoplastic markers [20]. In previous reports, a
multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA8) method was proposed for genotyping of B. anthracis strains, using six chromosomal and two plasmid marker loci (vrrA, vrrB1, vrrB2,
vrrC1, vrrC2, CG3, pXO1, pXO2 [14]). In the initial work,
an automated fluorescent DNA sequencer was used to
determine the size of the PCR fragments and this set of
markers is now largely employed for B. anthracis genotyping [21-26]. However, this MLVA8 assay is not sufficient
for molecular forensics approaches, the resolution
achieved is too limited. For instance the vast majority of
French and Italian strains have been assigned to MLVA8
genotypes (GT) 1 and 3 which differ only at one marker,
located on one of the two virulence plasmids [14,22,26].
For this reason, additional markers were subsequently
developed to produce an MLVA15 panel [11], and the initial clustering nomenclature [14] was revised [20]. Unfortunately none of the corresponding data has been
published so far. Le Flèche et al. [12] extended the MLVA8
assay by proposing 14 additional markers (Bams1, 3, 5, 7,
13, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31), which greatly
improved the resolution power of the assay. DNA fragment sizing was achieved on standard agarose gels stained
by ethidium bromide, a technique utilising widely accessible, and very basic, equipment.
In order to have a more rapid and accurate genotyping system for B. anthracis we propose an automated capillary
based method using essentially the panel of loci described
by Le Flèche et al [12], with the addition of 4 new markers,
and apply the method to collections of strains from Italy
and France. We compare the clustering achieved with
available epidemiological data for B. anthracis, and introduce two new B. anthracis groups, D and E. The present
report deals with the standardization and further
improvement of currently available genotyping methods
for B. anthracis, the typing of a larger collection of strains,
the comparison with available published data, and the
enlargement of the publicly accessible databases.

Results
MLVA25 genotyping by capillary electrophoresis
A collection of 160 B. anthracis isolates, comprising strains
from Italy and France and a few reference strains were analyzed to generate MLVA typing data. DNA was amplified
in 4 multiplex PCR reactions, comprising 25 loci. The loci
are 21 markers described previously [12,14] (Bams7 is not
currently amenable to capillary electrophoresis typing

because of its allele size range and was not included), and
the four new markers Bams34, 44, 51, 53 (Table 1). All
twenty-five markers can be amplified in only four PCR
reactions by taking into account the allele size range for
each locus (Table 2). The labelled amplicons were separated on a CEQ 8000 Beckmann DNA analysis system and
the electropherograms were analysed by CEQ Fragment
Analysis System software to determine the length of the
fragments by reference to a 75–1000 bps size ladder (in
red on Figure 1). After testing several primer concentrations and ratios, a balanced level of fluorescence peak
intensity was obtained by using between 5 to 10 ng of
template DNA per multiplex PCR reaction and the concentration of primers indicated (Table 2).
The assay was highly reproducible as tested by performing
duplicate typings. The intra-experimental (within the
same run) as well as the inter-experimental (between
runs) variation of fragment sizing showed variations
lower than one base over the whole range of PCR fragments investigated here. The accuracy of the data was
determined by comparison of observed PCR fragment size
to the exact values calculated by direct sequencing and
available genome sequence data [27]. In some instances
the amplicon size determined after electrophoresis separation did not match the expected values (Table 3). This is
well illustrated for instance with Bams30 (Table 3) for
which the offset increases with allele size, i.e. repeat copy
number. In any case, the offset is conserved, reproducible,
and the differences in calculated allele size are consistent
with a 9 bp repeat unit variation.
Because Bams30 was initially identified as a 27 bp repeat
unit marker [12], we investigated representative Bams30
alleles by sequencing (EMBL accession numbers
AM182499 to AM182509) in order to clarify this discrepancy. Sequence data indicates that Bams30 alleles are
composed of 27 base-pair units at one end of the array,
and 9 bp units at the other end. Table 4A provides the
allele codes of Bams30 alleles. Repeat units are not identical, different letters are used to code the different variant
units which are observed [28]. Uppercase letters code for
27-base-pair repeat units whereas lowercase letters code
for 9 base-pair repeat unit. The correspondence between
letters and repeat units is indicated in Table 4B. The two
regions are variable, and as a result the locus behaves like
a 9 bp repeat unit tandem repeat.
To better understand the origin of this behaviour, we
investigated the structure of this locus in the closely
related B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group by taking advantage
of available genome sequences. Figure 2 shows the organization of the locus in the genomes of B. anthracis (accession number AE016879), B. cereus ATCC14579
(AE016877), B. cereus G9241 [29], B. cereus ATCC10987

(AE017194), B. cereus E33L (NC_006274), and B. thuringiensis CEB97/027 (AE017355) also called Bt9727. The
gene bearing Bams30 in B. anthracis (Ba2450) possess a
collagen-like helix repeat and is flanked by two genes
Ba2449 and Ba2451. Their homologues in the other
strains were depicted using the same code. The organization in B. cereus G9241 is similar to B. anthracis, but in all
four other strains, the situation is less simple. In B. cereus
ATCC 14579, two genes possessing a collagen-like helix
repeat protein are observed, instead of one in B. anthracis:
Both genes possess a tandem repeat with similarity to
Bams30, encoding the collagen-like repeat. Whereas in
ATCC 10987, the two tandem repeats have nine base-pair
repeat units, Bt9727-2241 contains a 27 bp repeat unit
presumably derived from an ancestral 9 bp unit. Bt9727 is
by far the closest B. anthracis neighbor among the 5
sequenced strains [30]. The composite organization of the
Bams30 tandem repeat in B. anthracis can be explained by
a rearrangement occurring in a Bt9727-type Bams30
locus. Strain "A1055", which is closest to the last common
B. anthracis ancestor [20] shows the same rearrangement,
which strengthens the validity of Bams30 as an interesting
complementary tool for the identification of B. anthracis
(the presence of the virulence plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2
is not sufficient since for instance "A1055" is lacking
pXO1 [20]) even if the rearrangement is not strictly limited to B. anthracis as shown by the G9241 strain situation.

The alleles are identified with the number of repeats versus the former nomenclature [12]. Locusa, locusb, locusc are loci amplified by a forward
primer respectively labeled with cy5.5, cy5 and WellRed dyeD2.

Correspondance with agarose gel assignments
For reasons including accessibility to the different technologies, it is important to ensure that allele assignments
deduced from agarose gel or capillary electrophoresis are
compatible, so that the different methods can be used. For
this purpose, allele sizes (expressed in basepairs, bps and
converted to the number of repeat units, U) previously
estimated by agarose gel were re-examined according to
the capillary fragment analysis and available sequence
data. For Bams3 (15 bp repeat unit) one allele, previously
estimated at 609 bps (30 U) by agarose gel analysis, was
corrected to 594 bps corresponding to 29 U, by capillary
electrophoresis. Bams15 turned out to vary like a 9-mer
rather than 18-mer repeat unit and two alleles were
resolved (580 bps for 42 9-base pair units (42 U) and 598
bps for 44 U, previously grouped with 571 bps (41 U),
589 bps (43 U) or 607 bps (45 U). For Bams31 (9 bp
repeat unit) one allele was resolved by capillary electrophoresis (781 bps for 65 U, previously grouped with the
772 bps for 64 U).

For markers included in the MLVA8 assay [14] which
could be typed on agarose (i.e. with the exception of
pXO1 and pXO2) the data obtained here were in agreement with results generated by agarose gel electrophoresis
[12]. Published MLVA8 [14,21-26] data contains some
allele size assignments which do not correspond to the
actual size. This is due to clerical errors in the initial report
[14], as noticed previously [24] and data for some loci
must be converted as described in the material and methods section in order to be fully compatible.
Four new markers have been included. For Bams34, a 39mer repeat marker, five alleles were described ranging
from 238 to 581 bps (ranging from 4 to 13 repeat units).
Bams44 (39-mer) and Bams53 (12-mer) show two alleles
(respectively 339/417 bps or 8 and 12 repeat units, and
212/236 bps (6 and 8 repeat units)). A third allele is predicted from genome sequence data for the "Western"
strain, but was not experimentally observed among the
collection investigated here. For Bams51 (45-mer) four

alleles were observed ranging from 338 to 538 bps (6 to
10 units).
Data analysis
When the eight markers comprising the MLVA8 assay are
used, 30 different genotypes are resolved among the 160
isolates. With only few exceptions, these genotypes correspond to previously published profiles. Most exceptions
are minor variations of previous types. The vast majority
of French and Italian isolates belong to GT1 and GT3
within cluster A1a [14] in agreement with previous reports
[22,26]. When the whole MLVA25 dataset is used, 67 genotypes are resolved. Isolates which are not resolved in this
analysis have the same epidemiological history (when
known). The clustering analysis is shown in Figure 3.
Although MLVA is not by its very nature a tool with a high
phylogenetic value per se, especially when the available
strains do not fully cover the species diversity, the clustering achieved is in excellent agreement with the known
relationship between the ancestral C type (genotype 67),

the B cluster (genotypes 59 to 66, with the two well-separated subgroups, B1 and B2), and the A cluster (represented on one end by the "Ames" strain, initially assigned
to A3b and more recently to A2 [20], and on the other end
by the "Western" strain, initially assigned to A1a and more
recently to A1 [20]). More precisely, the "Vollum" strain
(genotype 54; strain "9" in [20]) and the "Australia94"
strain (genotype 45; presumably strain "20" in [20]) are in
the expected position with respect to the A group.
Genotypes 55–56, and 57–58 are loosely connected to the
others, and are suggested by clustering analysis as being
intermediates between the B cluster and the A cluster. This
position is reminiscent of the position occupied by strains
"6", "7" and "8" investigated by Pearson et al. [20]. It may
be of interest to note that "6" which branched out in an
ancestral position compared to the whole "A" cluster in
the SNP analysis [20], originates from Zambia, whereas
genotypes 57 and 58 in Figure 3 are from Cameroon. We

propose to call these very distinct MLVA groups types D
and E (Figure 3).

Discussion
Bacillus anthracis genotyping is essential for epidemiological studies and for biosecurity related (including microbial forensics) issues [21]. Current methodologies such as
MLVA8 are not sufficient to discriminate two geographically close isolates in natural outbreaks, since for instance
most French and Italian isolates will be classified as GT1
or 3 [22,26]. Molecular characterization needs to be as
precise as possible in order to discriminate isolates. The
rational of this work was to update the MLVA method for
quick (single-day analysis) and accurate discrimination of
Bacillus anthracis isolates. The markers are stable, this is
indirectly illustrated by the typing of "Sterne" strains from
different origins. Genotypes 46 and 48 correspond to
respectively two and five "Sterne" strains. Genotype 46 are
the CIP (Collection Institut Pasteur) reference strains
7700 and 7702, genotype 48 covers "Sterne" vaccine
strains from different countries, and the sequenced
genome. The only difference in the two genotypes is for
locus Bams28 [see additional file 1].
The number of VNTR loci was increased from 22 to 25 by
addition of four new markers (and removal of Bams7,
because allele sizes up to 2 kilobases are not adapted to
typing on current capillary machines). The overall assay
was converted from 25 monoplex PCR reactions, run on
agarose gels and checked for size by eye or by using gel
image analysis software, to 4 multiplex PCR analysed by
automated capillary based fluorescent electrophoresis and
internal size standard measurement for allele calculation.
For most loci, accurate size estimate is achieved directly by
the capillary electrophoresis machine. In other instances
however, the sizing proposed by the machine, although
quite reproducible, does not correspond to the real size.
This could be due to the nature of the gel matrix, or to dif-

ferences during migration between labelled PCR fragments and the ladder used, but most probably by a
slightly biased flanking sequence or repeat unit-specific
mobility pattern. Usually, the size estimate is shifted by a
constant value (offset) but in some instances, the offset
increases with increasing allele size (increasing repeat
copy number). For this reason, allele numbering must be
done carefully, using a correspondence table as presented
here in Table 3. If different equipments, or reagents, are
used, the correspondence indicated here must be checked
by typing a number of reference strains (such as the widely
available "Sterne" vaccine strain), before alleles can be
confidently called and data can be merged.
Size measurement from multiplexed, automated PCR
products allows for single-day isolate genotyping which is
of importance in a crisis situation. It also provides a
slightly increased discrimination power as compared to
the MLVA20 assay run on agarose gels for the same analysed markers. This difference is essentially due to the lack
of resolution of agarose for the larger, 9 bp repeat unit
loci, such as Bams30 and for Bams3, Bams13, Bams15
and Bams31 typing, where new alleles were identified. For
Bams15 and Bams30, capillary resolution was able to
show a 9 bps repeat unit length variation instead of the
respectively 18 bps and 27 unit length proposed initially.
The present investigation suggests that a recombination
event at the Bams30 locus may have occurred prior to the
emergence of B. anthracis. The event directly affects genes
coding for constituents of the exosporium. Bc2381 is
related to BclA, and Bc2382 corresponds to the exosporium H gene exsH [31]. In B. cereus ATCC 10987, B. thuringiensis 97/027 (Bt9727) and B. cereus genome E33L, an
additional ORF is located within the region. The Bams30containing gene in B. anthracis is the result of a recombination between Bt9727-2241 (coding for the BclA-like
protein) and Bt9727-2244 (exsH). The beginning and the

end of the protein sequence coded by Ba2450 are respectively identical to the beginning of Bt9727-2241 and to
the end of Bt9727-2244. Interestingly, a similar rearrangement is observed independently in the B. cereus strain
G9241 which caused an anthrax like disease in a human
patient [29]. As a result of this fusion, the first part of the
tandem repeat itself contains a 27 bp repeat unit whereas
the second part is a 9 bp repeat tandem repeat. It may be
of interest to observe that two of the most polymorphic
tandem repeats in B. anthracis, Bams13 and Bams30, are
associated with genes coding for components of the
exosporium (Bams13 is part of the BclA gene [32]).

Conclusion
In this report we propose an improved automated genotyping system of B. anthracis by MLVA, extending the
range of VNTR containing markers to 25, which increases
the resolution power as compared to previous methods.
The MLVA25 assay was used to genotype Italian and
French isolates in a very fast and highly reproducible manner. We also better defined previously characterized alleles and describe new allelic variants. MLVA25 is a very
accurate and discriminatory genotyping method and
could be a promising technique for future epidemiological studies as well as differentiation of deliberated vs. nat-

maintained by the French Ministry of Defence at Centre
d'Etude du Bouchet (CEB), from Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) Italian collections and from the Italian Reference
Center for Anthrax (ISZ, Foggia). Total genomic DNA was
extracted as previously reported [30].
VNTR amplification and analysis
Twenty-five loci were used, 21 from previous studies
[12,14] and 4 new ones identified by comparing B. anthracis genome sequences using the site GPMS, Genomes,
Polymorphism and Minisatellites [34] as described by
Denoeud et al. [13]. Multiplex PCR reactions were prepared as follows: 5–10 ng DNA were amplified in a final
volume of 15 μl containing 1× PCR Roche reaction buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl pH 8.3),
0.2 mM dNTPs (Amersham-PharmaciaTM), the appropriate concentrations of each primer (one of which was fluorescently labelled) as reported in Table 2, and 1 U Taq
polymerase (Roche). The four multiplex PCR amplifications were performed on Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC)
DNA Engine DYAD or PTC200 (MJ Research) with a starting denaturation step at 96°C for 3 min, followed by 36
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds, annealing
at 60°C for 30 seconds and extension at 65°C for 2 min.
The reactions were terminated by a final incubation at
65°C for 5 min.

The PCR products were diluted 1:5 and 5 μl of the dilution
was added to a mix containing 40 μl of Sample Loading
Solution (SLS, Beckmann Coulter, Fullerton, CA., USA)
and 0.5 μl of MicroSTEP-15a (800) size marker (Microzone Haywards Heath, UK). The samples were separated
by electrophoresis in CEQ Separation Gel LPA I (Urea in
buffered sieving matrix; Polyacrylamide, Beckman Coulter) on a CEQ 8000 automatic DNA Analysis System
(Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA., USA) with the following conditions: denaturation 90°C for 120 sec, inject 2.0
kV for 20 sec, separation 3.0 kV for 180 min. Allele sizes
were estimated using CEQ Fragment Analysis System
analysis software, by comparing the amplicons to the
internal size standard (MicroStep-15a), consisting of fifteen labelled fragments ranging from 75 to 1000 bp.

Bams30 alleles sequencing was done as previously
described [30]. The corresponding sequences accession
numbers (EMBL) are AM182499-AM182509.
MLVA data analysis
Previously published MLVA8 typing data was recovered
from the literature [14,21-26]. Different conventions have
been used for allele calling so that some minor corrections
must be applied before merging the data. As noticed by
Cheung et al. [24], some of the sizes initially indicated
[14] do not correspond to the actual size, as can be
deduced for instance from published genome sequence
data. There is a 1 bp error in the vrrA allele sizes (for
instance the allele indicated 313 in [14] is 314 bp). This
has no consequences in terms of repeat unit copy number
since vrrA has a 12 bp motif. The correction which needs
to be applied to vrrC1 (9 bp repeat unit) is a bit more complex and as follows: the 520, 538, 583, 613 and 685 bp
alleles must be converted to respectively 517, 535, 580,
616, and 688. The pXO1-aat sizes are underestimated by
3 bp. As a result the correct "Ames" strain MLVA8 code
expressed in base-pairs reads 314-229-153-580-532-158126-141 (or in terms of repeat copy numbers: 10-16-6-5317-2-7-10) for vrrA, vrrB1, vrrB2, vrrC1, vrrC2, CG3,
pXO1-aat and pXO2-at respectively. The "Sterne" strain is
314-229-162-580-532-158-132-135. Since at least one of
these two strains is included in the cited publications, it is
possible to deduce which conversion(s) needs to be
applied to the corresponding data set.

The MLVA25 genotype was deduced from the genbank
sequence data for strains "Ames", "Sterne", "Vollum",
"Kruger", "Western", "BA1055", "Australia94".
All the data produced was managed using BioNumerics
software version 4.5 (Applied Maths, Sint-MarteensLatem, Belgium). Clustering was done using the categorical similarity coefficient and the Single Linkage Method.

Authors' contributions
GF, ACia did the set up of the MLVA25 assay. ACia, RDes
and SV participated to typing work. FL, ACas, SV, CP and
GV did the error checking analysis. SV and OG did the
Bams30 alleles sequence analysis. GF, ACia, ACar and
ACie did various sequence analysis. RD'am and FO did
error checking of overall sequence analysis. SV and CP did
the Bams30 locus comparison using the different available genome sequences. GV was in charge of the Bionumerics database and clustering analyses. AF, CLD and JV
maintained the Italian and French reference collections
for B. anthracis respectively and extracted some of the
DNA samples used. FL, RD'am and GV conceived the
study. FL and GV wrote the report. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
