Phylogenetics and evolution of Su(var)3-9 SET
genes in land plants: rapid diversification in
structure and function
Xinyu Zhu1,2, Hong Ma3,4, Zhiduan Chen1*

Abstract
Background: Plants contain numerous Su(var)3-9 homologues (SUVH) and related (SUVR) genes, some of which
await functional characterization. Although there have been studies on the evolution of plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes,
a systematic evolutionary study including major land plant groups has not been reported. Large-scale phylogenetic
and evolutionary analyses can help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and contribute to improve
genome annotation.
Results: Putative orthologs of plant Su(var)3-9 SET protein sequences were retrieved from major representatives of
land plants. A novel clustering that included most members analyzed, henceforth referred to as core Su(var)3-9
homologues and related (cSUVHR) gene clade, was identified as well as all orthologous groups previously
identified. Our analysis showed that plant Su(var)3-9 SET proteins possessed a variety of domain organizations, and
can be classified into five types and ten subtypes. Plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes also exhibit a wide range of gene
structures among different paralogs within a family, even in the regions encoding conserved PreSET and SET
domains. We also found that the majority of SUVH members were intronless and formed three subclades within
the SUVH clade.
Conclusions: A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes was performed. A novel deep
phylogenetic relationship including most plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes was identified. Additional domains such as
SAR, ZnF_C2H2 and WIYLD were early integrated into primordial PreSET/SET/PostSET domain organization. At least
three classes of gene structures had been formed before the divergence of Physcomitrella patens (moss) from other
land plants. One or multiple retroposition events might have occurred among SUVH genes with the donor genes
leading to the V-2 orthologous group. The structural differences among evolutionary groups of plant Su(var)3-9 SET
genes with different functions were described, contributing to the design of further experimental studies.

Background
The SET domain (SM00317) is the catalytic center of
lysine methyltransferases with a conserved sequence of
~130 amino acid residues, initially identified at the
C- terminus of three regulatory factors (Su (var)3-9, E(z)
and Trithorax) in Drosophila accounting for its name
[1-4]. Currently, proteins containing the conserved SET
domain can be found in organisms ranging from virus
to all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and
Eukaryota) [5]. In plants, Baumbusch et al. [6] first

identified 37 putative Arabidopsis SET genes, and
divided them into four distinct classes: (1) E(Z) homologues; (2) Ash1 homologues and related genes; (3) trx
homologues and related genes; and (4) Su(var) homologues and related genes. Subsequently, Springer et al. [7]
added 25 maize SET genes to those of 37 Arabidopsis,
and divided them into five classes based on phylogenetic
relationships and domain organization; among these, the
Su(var) homologues and related genes were designated
as class V. Recently, Ng et al. [8] established two additional plant SET-gene classes, i.e. class VI composed of
the SET genes [9] and VII composed of the Putative
RuBisCo genes [10]; however, these recent classes lack

typical SET domain, either interrupted in the SET-I
region of SET domain or truncated.
Among the seven classes of plant SET genes, class V
contains significantly more members relative to other
classes and possess the PreSET domain (SM00468) in
their proteins [7,8]; for example, from class I to VII,
Arabidopsis contains 3, 5, 7, 2, 15, 5, and 9 members,
respectively. Numerous copies in class V may complicate the evolutionary process of this class of plant SET
genes. Previous studies [6,7,11] demonstrated that the
class V SET proteins can be further divided into seven
orthologous groups (V-1 to 7) and two major types (i.e.
SUVH and SUVR) based on their phylogenetic relationship and domain organization. The SUVH proteins consist of orthologous groups V-1, 2, 3 and 5, and have an
additional evolutionarily conserved SRA domain
(SM00466) upstream of the PreSET domain. The SUVR
proteins are composed of the remaining V-4, 6 and 7
orthologous groups and lack the SRA domain. Baumbusch et al. [6] and Springer et al. [7] noted that the
majority of SUVH members in Arabidopsis and maize
lacked introns, and supposed that these intronless
SUVH members probably originated from ancient retrotransposition events.
In Arabidopsis, there are ten SUVH and five SUVR
genes, in which five SUVHs and three SUVRs have been
characterized functionally [[12], and references therein].
SUVH1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 have been shown to control heterochromatic silencing by the HMTase activity [13-17],
and SUVR1, 2, 4 were mainly localized in the nucleolus
or nuclear bodies, suggestive of involvement in regulation of rRNA expression [12]. In contrast to SUVH proteins, SUVR4 acts as a dimethyltransferase with
preference for mono-methylated H3K9 as substrate, suggesting that SUVHs and SUVRs can act in concert in
achieving various functional H3K9 methylation states. It
has also been found that the SRA domain of the SUVH
proteins may be involved in heterochromatin formation
mediated by H3K9 methylation [16]. SUVRs, however,
were once supposed to lack a shared N-terminal
domain, although a novel conserved N-terminal domain,
WIYLD (PF10440), was recently identified in a few
members of the V-6 orthologous group, such as the
Arabidopsis SUVR1, 2, and 4 [12].
Here, we sampled from ten representatives of land
plants to investigate the phylogeny and evolution of
plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes. This is the first analysis of
these genes covering the range of land plants. We performed phylogenetic analysis using the combined datasets from the sequences of the conserved PreSET- and
SET-domain regions to increase phylogenetic resolution. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, we tracked
the evolution of domain organizations and gene structures of plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes in land plants; in

turn, these domain organizations and gene structures
were used as synapomorphies (derived character states
shared by two or more taxa/members) to confirm the
phylogenetic relationships. Finally, we explored the
relationships between evolutionary patterns and functional diversification by combining the phylogenetic
results with available literature for functions of plant
Su(var)3-9 SET genes; the results of our study would
lay the foundation for the design of future experimental studies.

Results
Plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes

Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa contained 15 and
12 full-length Su(var)3-9 SET protein sequences, respectively. To undertake an evolutionary analysis of Su(var)
3-9 SET genes in land plants, three other completely
sequencing plant genomes and one algal genome were
searched using multiple representatives of Su(var)3-9
SET proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana as queries. By conducting tBLASTn searches against the JGI genome database, we obtained 16, 5, 7 and 1 Su(var)3-9 SET protein
sequences from Populus trichocarpa (Pt), Selaginella
moellendorfii (Sm), Physcomitrella patens (Pp) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr), respectively. Seven cDNA
sequences of Pinus taeda (Pta) were obtained from
TIGR plant indices. In addition, 1, 2 and 7 Su(var)3-9
SET protein sequences were also obtained from Nicotiana tabacum (Nt), Vitis vinifera (Vv) and Ricinus communis (Rc), respectively. In total, 74 candidate SET
sequences were collected from ten species, and the
detailed information is provided in Additional file 1 and 2.
Protein sequences lacking PreSET domain were not used
for the further study even when they have very low
E values in the BLAST searches. The Arabidopsis
SDG11 (SUVH10) was also not used because it is likely a
pseudogene [6].
Phylogenetic analysis

Alignment of the combined dataset from PreSET and
SET domains resulted in a matrix with length of 228
sites after removing ambiguous regions and autapomorphic insertions (see Additional file 3). The WAG
model [18] was selected as the best-fit evolutionary
model under the AIC criterion [19] with specific
improvements (+G [20]; +F [21]). A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis produced an optimal tree with an
InL score of -20557.59. The NJ analyses recovered trees
with almost identical topologies and support values to
those of ML analyses. Most of differences between ML
and NJ trees were distributed on extremely short
branches (see Additional file 4). The ML tree is presented in Figure 1 with bootstrap percentages at the
node of the branch.

usually one copy in each species (Figure 1); the SUVH
clade also contained several other orphan members
(SmSDG2, PpSDG2 and PpSDG3), and their relationships with other members of this clade were uncertain
(Figure 1). The V-6 group contained members from
both seed plants and moss, but not Selaginella moellendorfii (fern), and was characterized by the WIYLD
domain at the N-terminal region of protein sequences
[12]. The V-7 group contained members from each
major land plant groups with one or several copies in
each species, and possessed a characteristic ZnF_C2H2
domain (SM00355) [22] at the N-terminal region of protein sequences. An orphan member SmSDG4 possessed
a unique TPR_1 domain (PF00515) at the N-terminal
regions of its protein sequences.

Our analysis recovered all orthologous groups previously
identified [6,7,11] (Figure 1). In the present investigation, we broadened these orthologous groups (group (s),
hereafter) based on internal support (>95% BS) or conserved domain organization and gene structure (Table 1
and Figure 2), thus resulting in the inclusion of more
members in each group. In the current study, we used
the definition of groups previously identified [6,7,11]
mainly for the purpose of comparison, and it is possible
that some groups we have designated as a single group
might actually represent multiple groups because of
sampling limitations. Our tree showed that all members
could be divided into two clades when the member of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green alga) was designed
as the outgroup. The smaller clade was moderately supported, including V-4 group and other two members; it
is worth noting that the V-4 group only contained
angiosperm members excluding rice (monocot); the larger clade was strongly supported, including all the
remaining members, which was named as cSUVHR
(core Su(var)3-9 homologues &related genes) clade in
our analysis (Figure 1). Within the cSUVHR clade, the
subclade including V-1, 2, 3, and 5 groups was strongly
supported and named here as the SUVH clade (Figure 1)
because all members possess a characteristic SRA domain
at the N terminus [7]; this result was consistent with a
previous hypothesis that all SUVH genes had a common
ancestor [7,11]. The V-7 group within the cSUVHR clade
appears to be sister to the SUVH clade, but only with low
support. The V-6 group within the cSUVHR clade was
placed at the basal position that did not appear to have a
clear relationship with other groups.
Within the SUVH clade, the V-1, V-3 and V-5 groups
plus several orphan members (PtaSDG1, 2 and 3)
formed a subclade with low support and only seed plant
members; in contrast, the V-2 group was strongly supported and contained all representative land plants, with

Domain organization

To trace their evolutionary history in land plants, we
predicted the domain organization of candidate Su(var)
3-9 SET proteins. The candidate proteins could be classified into five types (groups) and ten subtypes (subgroups) based on their domain organization, with the
major differences lying in their N-terminal regions.
Type A contained a characteristic SRA domain at the
N-terminus (Table 1), which was identified as the
YDG_SRA domain (PF02182) in the Pfam platform [6].
The subtype A1, which only existed in V-1 group, had
an additional N-terminal domain, AT_hook (SM00348),
a small DNA-binding motif that functions in the transcription regulation of genes containing or in close
proximity to AT-rich regions [23,24]. In contrast, the
subtypes A2 and A3 were broadly distributed in V-1, 2,
and 3 and V-5 groups. It was also worth noting that all
members in V-3 group lack the PostSET domain
(SM00508) at their C-terminal regions. Type B contains
one or more ZnF_C2H2 domain(s) at its N-terminus
(Table 2) and was only distributed in the V-7 group.

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the Su(var)3-9 SET gene structures in PreSET and SET domain regions. Boxes represent exons and
lines represent introns. Length of exons are roughly at scale but introns not. Dark gray regions encode for SET domains; light gray regions
encode for PreSET domains. The numbers above boxes are the length of exons (bp). The numbers above lines are the intron positions (see
Additional file 5 for the alignment of mRNA sequences) and those below are the intron phases.

The ZnF_C2H2 domain is one type of the C2H2-type
zinc fingers (Znf), very common DNA-binding motifs
found extensively in eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors [25,26]. Type C contains one WIYLD
domain at its N-terminus and was only found in the
V-6 group (Table 2). Type D lacked a typical PreSET

domain and contains instead the AWS domain
(SM00570) (Associated With SET), a subdomain of PreSET domain. This domain organization might have
arisen recently because it was only found in angiosperms in the present study. The AWS domain was often
found in association with the SET domain, suggesting a

either lacking identifiable N-terminal domains or having
unique N-terminal domains; subtype E1 and E2 might
be the ancestral domain organization due to their extensive distribution in eukaryotes (data not shown).
Gene structure

In the present study, the structures of only 24 plant Su
(var)3-9 SET genes (see Additional file 5 and 6) were
analyzed due to the lack of the corresponding genomic
sequences in other Su(var)3-9 SET genes. We found
that the number of intron is highly variable in plant Su
(var)3-9 SET genes, ranging from 0 in V-1, -3, and -5
groups to 20 in SmSDG1. A total of 208 introns were
present in 24 analyzed genes, an average of 8.7 introns
per gene; the average number of introns per gene also
varied among groups, ranging from 7.6 in V-6 group to
14 in V-2 group (Table 2). Among the 208 introns, 125
(61%) were in phase 0, 43 (20%) in phase 1, and 40
(19%) in phase 2 (Table 2), similar to the previous
reports of 57.3% for phase 0, 21.5% for phase 1, and
21.2% for phase 2 in 21,570 rice genes [28]. To trace the
evolutionary pattern of gene structure, the current study
mainly focused on the most conserved PreSET and SET
domain regions. Figure 2 presents the gene structures of
these two regions. Our result showed that at least three
classes of gene structures (i.e. V-2, V-6 and V-7 groups)
were formed probably through frequent inron loss and
gain before the divergence of Physcomitrella patens
from other land plants. In these three groups, the ancestral gene structures might be similar to PpSDG1,
PpSDG8 and PpSDG4 (Figure 2), respectively. The
sequence similarity between introns was not analyzed
because their lengths were highly variable. Within the
V-2 group, all introns maintained identical phases and
positions, indicating a high degree of structural conservation during the evolution of land plants. In contrast,
the V-6 and -7 groups were less conserved; for example,
in V-6 the intron sliding occurred in the last intron
(position 31 of OsSDG712) (see Additional file 5). Also
in V-7 PpSDG5 had only one conserved intron (position

16) compared to other genes. AtSDG20, SmSDG6 and
PpSDG9 had a common intron (position17), together
with the low support on the relationship among them in
phylogenetic tree, suggesting that V-4 group might have
a common ancestor with these two orphan members.
Most members in the SUVH clade were intronless
except for the V-2 group. Previous studies found that
most Arabidopsis genes in this clade were intronless,
and suggested that these intronless members may have
originated from one or a few retroposition events, followed by tandem duplication [6]. If this hypothesis is
correct, the donor genes of the retroposition might also
be in the V-2 group, because the descendent retrogene
and the donor genes should cluster together in the phylogenetic tree just as in Figure 1. In the SUVH clade,
intronless members formed three independent subclades, each with weak BP support values (see a, b and c
branches in Figure 1). If multiple retroposition events
occurred in donor gene lineage, the donor gene lineage
would cluster with these retrogenes arranged paraphyletically in phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Owing to the low
support values in the current data, we are still unable to
determine whether these three intronless branches originated independently or had a common ancestor.

Discussion
The presence of gene families is one of the characteristics of eukaryotes [29,30]. Since the genes within
families are initially redundant in molecular function,
they likely have undergone evolutionary selection processes, and eventually formed multiple orthologous
groups to carry out different functions [31,32]. The current research first presented the phylogeny and evolution of plant Su(var)3-9 SET gene family in land plants.
Our analyses identified a novel phylogenetic relationship, that is, the cSUVHR clade that includes most
members analyzed except for the V-4 group and a few
orphan members (Figure 1). In addition, our results support the following evolutionary scenario of this gene
family: multiple gene duplications had occurred independently before the split of Physcomitrella patens
(moss) from other land plants, and since then each of
orthologs experienced molecular divergence by

Zhu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/63

mutations, domain acquisition and gene structure
changes, resulted in different orthologous groups. We
suggested that the SAR, ZnF_C2H2 and WIYLD
domains were early integrated into primordial PreSET/
SET/PostSET domain organization to form different
evolutionary groups (Figure 3) because the type A, B
and C domain organization in Table 1 were all found in
Physcomitrella patens. In contrast to previous reports
[7,8], our analyses showed that the PostSET domain was
present in most plant Su(var)3-9 SET proteins, but not
in the V-3 group. In the light of the parsimony rule of
evolution, we propose that the ancestral plant Su(var)39 SET proteins might have possessed the PostSET
domain, which was lost in some members during the
subsequent evolution (Figure 3).
The plant Su(var)3-9 SET gene family exhibits a large
diversity of gene structures, even in the conserved PreSET and SET domains (Figure 2), implying frequent
gain and/or loss of introns during evolution [33]. For
plant Su(var)3-9 SET gene family, such frequent gain/
loss of introns might have occurred during early evolution of land plants because the gene structure of the V2, 6 and 7 groups had appeared before the divergence of
Physcomitrella patens (Figure 2). Because introns might
have regulatory functions [34,35], the gain or loss of
introns may have contributed to functional divergence
between paralogs, such as subfunctionalization, either
directly by introducing regulatory differences or by facilitating exon shuffling. In our study, the V-2 group
demonstrated strict conservation of gene structure, indicating that this group may have evolved under high
selective pressures and is functionally important; in contrast, V-6 and V-7 may have evolved under relatively
relaxed selective pressures (Figure 2). As in previous
studies [33,36,37], our study showed that the shared
variations in gene structure can be used for the classification of paralogous genes into different evolutionary

groups (V-2, 6 and 7); accordingly we further suggest
that V-4 group be expanded to include two orphan
members, SmSDG6 and PpSDG9, because these two
genes have a common intron (position17) with
AtSDG20 of V-4 group (Figure 2).
In the SUVH clade (Figure 1), the majority of the
genes, except the V-2 group, were intronless. We suppose that their last common ancestor might possess
introns and the intronless genes (V-1, 3, 5 groups) originated from the lineages leading to the V-2 group by retroposition because all 24 genes analyzed including from
basal evolutionary groups (V-4, 6 and 7) and an outgroup gene (CrSDG1) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
(green alga), also possessed introns (Figure 2). Many retrogenes have been identified in plant gene families
[31,38-41]. It is generally believed that most retrogenes
become non-functional because they lack the regulatory
elements required for expression [42]. However, several
recent studies have demonstrated that functional genes
can occasionally be generated from retrogenes and that
these processed genes take on a non-redundant functional role [38-40]. In the plant Su(var)3-9 SET gene
family, transcripts of many intronless Arabidopsis, Oryza
and maize genes have been detected in RT-PCR and/or
microarray analyses [6,7,43], suggesting that some retrogenes of the Su(var)3-9 SET family might have gained
regulatory elements and became functional.
We found that Arabidopsis Su(var)3-9 SET genes of different groups or clades have different functions (Table 3),
suggesting that they interact with the different substrates.
SUVH4 (SDG33) (also known as KYP [13]) and SUVH2
[16,44] play major roles in Arabidopsis histone H3K9
methylation modification; in contrast, the loss of SUVH1

(SDG23) [45] results in only minor reductions in global
H3K9 methylation levels. SUVR1 (SDG13), SUVR2

in detail [12]. They are localized to the nucleolus or noncondensed nuclear bodies, which differs from SUVH proteins localizing to heterochromatin region. In vitro SUVR4
acts as efficient dimethyltransferase specifically adding the
second methyl group to monomethylated H3K9; in contrast, in vitro SUVH4 (SDG33), SUVH5 (SDG9) and
SUVH6 (SDG23) proteins are very efficient monomethyltransferases but moderately efficient dimethyltransferase
[14,17]. The localization of the SUVR proteins suggests
that these proteins are not involved in heterochromatic
gene silencing, and may function as a repressor of rDNA
gene clusters in the decondensed part of the nucleolus.
The SUVR5 (SDG6) and SUVR3 (SDG20) genes were the
only Arabidopsis representative of Su(var)3-9 SET genes in
the V-7 and V-4 groups (Figure 1), respectively, and their
functions are unknown and will need to be investigated in
the future.

Conclusions
Our study provides novel phylogenetic relationship and
new insights into the evolution of plant Su(var)3-9 SET
gene family in land plants, which includes most members analyzed except for the V-4 group and a few
orphan members. We found that the PostSET is not a
common domain in plant Su(var)3-9 SET proteins; it
might be an ancestral characteristic of this gene family,
which was lost in some members during the evolution.
We propose that the SAR, ZnF_C2H2 and WIYLD
domains were integrated into primordial domain organization, PreSET/SET/PostSET, during the early evolution
of land plant and resulted in evolutionary differentiation.
Plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes exhibit a diversity of structures, even in the conserved PreSET and SET domain
regions. At least three classes of gene structures in the
V-2, V-6 and V-7 groups had appeared before the divergence of Physcomitrella patens from other land plants
through frequent inron loss and gain. In the SUVH
clade, the majority of the members were intronless retrogenes, probably originated from the ancestral genes
leading to V-2 group with introns. Our results revealed
the structural differences among evolutionary groups of
plant Su(var)3-9 SET genes with different functions, and
further predicted that the function of Arabidopsis

[12]

SUVR5 (SDG6) and SUVR3 (SDG20) genes belonging to
the V-7 and V-4 groups, respectively, are different from
other Arabidopsis Su(var)3-9 SET genes.

Methods
Homologous Su(var)3-9 SET proteins search

Six completely sequenced plant genomes were selected
for retrieving the Su(var)3-9 SET protein sequences. The
protein sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza
sativa were obtained from the literature [6,8,11]; the protein sequences of Populus trichocarpa (angiosperm),
Selaginella moellendorfii (fern), Physcomitrella patens
(moss), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green alga)
were retrieved from JGI genome database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org) by tBLASTn search with default parameters (E value = 1e-5). To better understand the
evolutionary history of plant class V SET genes in land
plants, we also included Su(var)3-9 SET protein
sequences from other plant species, including incompletely sequenced Nicotiana tabacum (angiosperm), Vitis
vinifera (angiosperm), Ricinus communis (angiosperm)
and Pinus taeda (gymnosperm), either by BLASTp from
NCBI protein database (nr) or from TIGR EST databases
[46]. The protein sequences of SET and PreSET domain
regions from 7 Su(var)3-9 SET proteins in Arabidopsis
were used as the queries. In the JGI database, if alternative splicing was present in the gene model, only the
longest transcript was selected, and if truncated SET proteins were found, their gene models will be re-predicted
using genomic scaffold sequences. Protein domains were
predicted by SMART [47] and Pfam [48] platforms and
the sequences possessing PreSET and SET domains are
regarded as the candidate Su(var)3-9 SET proteins.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

We used the protein sequences of PreSET and SET
regions to construct a combined dataset. Alignments of
these two regions were first generated independently at
the amino acid level using Clustal X [49], followed by
manual adjustment, and then the combined matrix of
protein sequences was constructed for 73 plant Su(var)
3-9 SET genes. The corresponding codon alignment was
also constructed according to the protein sequence

Zhu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/63

alignment using the PAL2NAL program [50] for gene
structure analyses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using protein sequences. PHYML [51] and
MEGA 3.1[52] were used for ML [53] and NJ [54] analyses, respectively. For the ML method, the ProTest [55]
program was used for testing evolutionary model and
optimizing parameters. For the NJ method, we used the
Jones-Taylor-Thorton +Îmodel as well as simple models
of amino acid replacement, such as p-distance [56] with
pairwise deletion of gaps. Supports were estimated by
non-parametric bootstrap using 1000 replicates for the
NJ tree and 500 replicates for the ML tree. In this
paper, we used the following descriptions and ranges in
the text for describing bootstrap support: weak, 50-75%;
moderate, 76-85%; strong, 86-100%.
Analysis of gene structure

Gene structure was analyzed on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. Our analyses mainly focused on the PreSET and SET domain regions because the regions
outside of these two domains are highly variable in
plant Su(var)3-9 SET proteins. Intron-exon borders
were determined by aligning the cDNA sequences to
their respective genomic region with the spidey program
[57] followed by manual inspection of the splice consensus signals. Intron phase was analyzed manually based
on the intron-exon border information: phase 0 designated introns between codons, phase 1 designated
introns between the first and second bases of a codon,
and phase 2 designated introns between the second and
third bases of a codon. The intron position information
was obtained from nucleotide sequence alignments
derived from the protein alignments. Intron positions
that are apart even by one base pair were considered as
non-identical even if it cannot be excluded that they
might have the same ancestor [58].
