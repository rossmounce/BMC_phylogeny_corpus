Sequence variability of Rhizobiales orthologs and
relationship with physico-chemical characteristics
of proteins
Humberto Peralta, Gabriela Guerrero, Alejandro Aguilar and Jaime Mora*

Abstract
Background: Chromosomal orthologs can reveal the shared ancestral gene set and their evolutionary trends.
Additionally, physico-chemical properties of encoded proteins could provide information about functional
adaptation and ecological niche requirements.
Results: We analyzed 7080 genes (five groups of 1416 orthologs each) from Rhizobiales species (S. meliloti, R. etli, and M.
loti, plant symbionts; A. tumefaciens, a plant pathogen; and B. melitensis, an animal pathogen). We evaluated their
phylogenetic relationships and observed three main topologies. The first, with closer association of R. etli to A.
tumefaciens; the second with R. etli closer to S. meliloti; and the third with A. tumefaciens and S. meliloti as the closest pair.
This was not unusual, given the close relatedness of these three species. We calculated the synonymous (dS) and
nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates of these orthologs, and found that informational and metabolic functions
showed relatively low dN rates; in contrast, genes from hypothetical functions and cellular processes showed high dN
rates. An alternative measure of sequence variability, percentage of changes by species, was used to evaluate the most
specific proportion of amino acid residues from alignments. When dN was compared with that measure a high
correlation was obtained, revealing that much of evolutive information was extracted with the percentage of changes by
species at the amino acid level. By analyzing the sequence variability of orthologs with a set of five properties (polarity,
electrostatic charge, formation of secondary structures, molecular volume, and amino acid composition), we found that
physico-chemical characteristics of proteins correlated with specific functional roles, and association of species did not
follow their typical phylogeny, probably reflecting more adaptation to their life styles and niche preferences. In addition,
orthologs with low dN rates had residues with more positive values of polarity, volume and electrostatic charge.
Conclusions: These findings revealed that even when orthologs perform the same function in each genomic
background, their sequences reveal important evolutionary tendencies and differences related to adaptation.

Background
Orthologs are genes related to a common ancestor and
derived from speciation events, and their identification
is often based on the most significant bidirectional similarity [1]. However, Huynen and Bork [2] proposed that
chromosomal gene order conservation (gene neighbor

conservation, or synteny) is also a key factor in the identification of these genes. In another study, the determination of synteny was useful to enhance the accuracy of
ortholog identification in mouse and human genomes
[3]. Also, we reported an analysis of chromosomal
orthologs in four species of Rhizobiales, and found that
syntenic genes showed more sequence conservation,
higher operon organization and network formation, and
encoded key metabolic proteins as compared to genes
without synteny [4]. We consider that these genes can

be viewed as a model group to study the evolutionary
differences and to assess the meaning of sequence variability of orthologs.
From the dogma that genes evolve and accumulate
mostly neutral mutations [5], a question arises: how to
detect and evaluate if specific residues in the protein
sequences encoded by orthologs are responsible for
adaptation? Gene evolution can be assessed by measuring single nucleotide mutations that change (nonsynonymous, dN) or do not change (synonymous, dS) the
encoded amino acid. Genes with higher nonsynonymous
to synonymous ratios (dN/dS > 1) are considered to
have experienced positive selection, revealing an adaptive process at the molecular level [6,7]. In bacteria,
however the majority of genes evolve under purifying
selection (dN/dS < 1), which is a trend that eliminates
deleterious mutations. Methods in the literature to measure dN and dS rates make several inferences and use
probabilistic models [7,8]. Evolutionary studies commonly stop there, but it is important to further study
the significance of ortholog variability, considered as
neutral, and trying to obtain information about how the
physico-chemical properties of proteins are defined by
specific sequences. We proposed that important evolutive information can be extracted directly from protein
sequences through detection of the most specific residue
in a given position for each species in multiple alignments of orthologs, which we represent as the percentage of change by species, originally termed as the
species signature [4]. We used that measure in conjunction with the series of values reported by Atchley and
collaborators [9], that consist of sets of numeric values
for amino acid variability, organized by physico-chemical
property (namely polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, amino acid composition, and electrostatic
charge), which summarize data from 54 amino acid
attributes.
The Rhizobiales is a versatile alpha-proteobacterial
Order, with members showing diversity in genomic
structure, metabolic processes, and lifestyle [10-12]. The
Rhizobiales include plant facultative (Agrobacterium)
and animal obligate pathogens (Brucella, Bartonella),
facultative symbionts (Sinorhizobium, Mesorhizobium,
Rhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium) and free-living organisms (Rhodopseudomonas palustris and the plant rhizobia) [13-15]. Several complete genome sequences of
Rhizobiales are available, including S. meliloti [16], M.
loti [17], A. tumefaciens [10,12], R. etli [18], and B. melitensis [11]. Despite their described versatility, the chromosomal orthologs in these species have enough
conservation of the characteristics that define the species derived from the common ancestor in the alphaproteobacterial Order [4].

As a continuation of our previous work [4], here we
analyze the chromosomal orthologs of five Rhizobiales
(S. meliloti, R. etli, A. tumefaciens, B. melitensis and M.
loti) to evaluate the sequence variability among orthologs and the relationship with phylogeny and physicochemical characteristics of proteins. In this genomic
study, we used the series of values of physico-chemical
properties reported by Atchley et al. [9], to define how
the specific properties of proteins vary according to differences in amino acid residues, and also to determine
the significance of the percentage of changes by species,
in relation to variability. The aim of this study were to
analyze the evolution of common orthologs in rhizobiales species, to extract the specific changes in their
sequences, in relation to other evolutionary measures
and to assess, theoretically, the physico-chemical impact
of these changes. We hypothesize that many changes in
sequences are not completely neutral, but define physico-chemical differences with a role in adaptation to
species niches.

Methods
Detection of orthologs

The following genome sequences of Rhizobiales species
were analyzed in this work: Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021
(hereafter referred as Sm or S, Genbank accession number NC_003047), Rhizobium etli CFN42 (Re or R,
NC_007761), R. etli strain CIAT652 (CIAT,
NC_010994), Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (At or A;
Cereon, NC_003062), Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099
(Ml or M, NC_002678) and Brucella melitensis 16M
(Bm or B, NC_003317). These sequences were obtained
from the NCBI web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Orthologs were detected by the best bidirectional hit
between pairs of species, with S. meliloti as a reference,
using the program Fasta34 [19] with the following parameters: an identity of at least 50%, overlapping by at
least 150 nt, and an (E) score < 10-5. Orthologs in the
five chromosomes were determined by combining the
results of each pairwise comparison in order to get the
common set. The correct ortholog correspondence
among pair comparisons was manually checked. Additionally, to get a more strict ortholog assignation, the
genes must have a synteny relationship (or conserved
neighborhood), and for this we applied a method
reported previously [4].
Functional classification of the chromosomal orthologs

The functional annotation of the orthologs was that
from A. tumefaciens C58-U. Washington annotation
[10]; functions were manually checked against the other
genomic functional annotations. The functions were
classified into groups as follows. Metabolism: amino

Peralta et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:48

acid, nucleotide, fatty acid, and cofactor synthesis; central intermediary metabolism, and energy obtention;
informational: DNA metabolism (including recombination, replication and repair), transcription, translation,
and regulatory functions; processes: transport, cell envelope synthesis, and cellular processes (such as cell division, secretion and chemotaxis); and hypothetical and
unknown functions.
Identity, similarity and the percentage of changes by
species (%chSp)

Similarity (pair comparisons) and common identity
(multiple comparisons) were calculated with ClustalW
alignments [20]. The percentage of changes by species
(or %chSp), originally the species signature, was calculated as reported previously [4], and consists, briefly, in
the amount of most specific residues for each ortholog,
reported as a percentage, extracted from homologous
positions in ClustalW multiple alignments. The cases
when a position was considered part of the %chSp were:
four identical residues and one different, three identical
residues and two different (%chSp accounted for two
species), two identical residues and three different (%
chSp accounted for the three species), and five different
residues (%chSp accounted for the five species). The
percentage was calculated dividing by a common length.
Gaps (internal differences) and non-aligned sequences
(in the extremes of the sequences), were not considered
and were trimmed with an ad hoc perl script, following
accepted criteria.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were obtained with the neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods.
Sequences were first aligned with the ClustalW program, and the non-aligned segments and gaps were cut
with ad hoc perl scripts. Unrooted phylogenies were calculated for each of the orthologs separately. For ML, we
used the proml program, and for the NJ method, the
neighbor program, both from the Phylip package v3.6
[21] by Joe Felsenstein, available on the web (http://
www.evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).
The JTT model of substitution was applied. The ML
and NJ methods gave similar results, and we chose to
work with those obtained with ML.
Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates

Estimation of the number of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions per site was performed
by ML analysis with the codeML program of the PAML
package [22], used with model 1 (free ratio), runmode 0
(user tree), fixed branch length initial, and with the
empirical F3 × 4 nucleotide frequencies model. The
amino acid sequence alignments were traced back to

Page 3 of 15

their corresponding nucleotide sequences and the nonhomologous segments were trimmed with an ad hoc
perl script. dN and dS values corresponded to the final
branch. Genes with dN values above 0.4, or dS values
above 5, were eliminated from the analysis. The orthologs were assigned to the group with low dN value if,
according to the order of the five dN values of each
ortholog, the second lowest value did not surpass the
0.05 dN limit. Otherwise, the ortholog was assigned to
the high dN group. Codon usage tables were obtained
from the Kazusa website (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/
codon).
Physico-chemical series of values for amino acids and
prediction of transmembranal proteins

We used the series of values for amino acids (polarity,
secondary structure, molecular volume, amino acid
composition, and electrostatic charge) reported by Atchley et al. [9]. Amino acid values in the series of physicochemical properties are positive or negative. To calculate
the value for each sequence, the values for each residue
were added, with sign conservation. Negative or positive
values were obtained, with the exception of the amino
acid composition, which always yields positive values.
Clustering of results was performed with Multiple
Experiment Viewer MeV TM4 [23], used with the normalized data from the values of physico-chemical properties, in hierarchical mode, with the Pearson rank
correlation or Euclidean distance, and average linkage.
To normalize values, all values in each row of data were
multiplied by a scale factor S, so that the sum of the
squares of the values in each row was 1 (a separate S
factor is computed for each row). To normalize array
(columns), a similar computation was performed. For
the relationship of the %chSp with physico-chemical
properties, the method described by Olivares-Hernandez
et al. was followed [24]; briefly, range values of all properties and average of the %chSp of all species were calculated. To obtain clusters of products with high
correlation values, the range of each property was
divided by the average %chSp from the five organisms,
the result was multiplied by log2 and clustered with the
Multiple Experiment Viewer MeV TM4 program [23],
using k-means and Euclidean distance. The TMAP program, version 46 [25], available in the EMBOSS package
(http://www.emboss.org), was used to predict transmembranal segments in the protein sequences.
For functional analysis, orthologs were classified as
positive or negative if values for each ortholog product
from the five species had the same sign (in the case of
amino acid composition, values were divided by half and
assigned to low or high level groups). The resulting
groups were: polarity, negative 725 sequences, positive
297; secondary structure, negative (representing

Peralta et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:48

abundance of alpha-helices) 530, positive (abundance of
coils) 314; molecular volume, negative (representing
products with small residues) 886, positive (products
with bulky residues) 72; amino acid composition, low
(represents atypical composition) 612, high (very typical
composition) 621; electrostatic charge, negative 613,
positive 191.
Statistical analysis

The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate differences in frequency distributions and was performed
with Minitab v12 (Minitab, Inc.). The Fisher’s exact
tests for significant differences in proportions were calculated with Oyvind Langsrud’s page (http://www.langsrud.com/fisher.htm). Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated with Minitab v12.

Results
We attempted to use the analysis of ortholog sequence
variability by the percentage of changes by species (%
chSp) in Rhizobiales genomes [4] as an instrument to
determine genomic differences among groups of species,
and evolutive coherence. This is connected with the
phylogenetic relationships of the species, but also with
the chemical nature of amino acid substitutions in proteins. Thus, we assessed the relationship of sequence
variability with phylogeny and physico-chemical properties of a set of 1416 orthologs from five species of Rhizobiales (S. meliloti, R. etli, A. tumefaciens, B. melitensis
and M. loti). We applied a measure we proposed,
termed the percentage of changes by species, originally
species signature (defined as the normalized number of
residues in the ortholog sequence that occur only once
in individual alignment columns) [4], intended to extract
species-specific information, possibly related to the
adaptation to niche, and compared the %chSp with the
evolutionary rates of the orthologs (synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitution rates). Additionally, we
used five series of values for amino acid properties
(polarity, secondary structure formation, volume, amino
acid composition and electrostatic charge) reported by
Atchley et al. [9], to explore the relationships of physico-chemical properties of residues encoded in the
orthologs with phylogeny, evolutionary rates and
function.
The percentage of changes by species (%chSp) and
relationships with function and dN and dS

With the %chSp we wanted to find the specific differences in protein sequences of the orthologs for each of
the species studied. The %chSp was calculated by normalizing the number of residues in the ortholog
sequence that occur only once in individual alignment
columns [4]. This measure denotes the amount of most

Page 4 of 15

specific residues in the orthologs, and is expressed as a
percentage of the total number of amino acids in the
proteins. In Figure 1A, the %chSp of the orthologs studied is shown. Two groups can be clearly distinguished,
with S. meliloti grouped with A. tumefaciens and R. etli,
and M. loti and B. melitensis in another group. That
grouping reflects the phylogenetic relationship of these
species. Frequency distribution curves of the %chSp
values were plotted to illustrate in detail the separation
of these groups (Figure 1B).
To detect the effect of divergence on functional role,
we plotted the distribution of functional classes by the
%chSp. As observed in Figure 1C (for R. etli, the other
species gave a similar pattern, not shown), the informational functions (replication and DNA metabolism, transcription, translation, and transcriptional regulation)
showed the most reduced amount of the %chSp, followed by metabolic functions, and cellular processes.
The hypothetical functions or poorly characterized proteins showed the highest level.
To determine the usefulness of the %chSp, we compared this parameter with the codon evolution of the
orthologs. To do this, we calculated the synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates by the
maximum likelihood method with PAML [22]. Some
genes showed dS saturation and were eliminated from
the analysis; 985 genes remained with dS values lower
than 5. We obtained very high correlations between the
%chSp and dN (Figure 2A) and dS (Figure 2B), with
Pearson coefficients of r = 0.932 to 0.953 (with p < 0.05)
for relation with dN, and r = 0.517 to 0.587 (p < 0.05)
for dS. These data revealed that the %chSp was well correlated with codon evolution and is a useful tool to
extract directly the evolutive change at the protein level.
In comparison, other measures of sequence conservation, such as protein identity or similarity, gave lower
Pearson coefficients with dN or dS (for example, in S.
meliloti, dN-common identity r = -0.798, dN-common
similarity r = -0.650; dS-common identity r = -0.511,
dS-common similarity r = -0.400) (not shown). dN and
the %chSp are related measures, but they are not
derived from the same sequence information: dN is calculated from nonsynonymous codons in nucleotide
sequences, while the %chSp is calculated directly from
protein sequences by extracting the most specific residue for each homologous position after sequence
alignment.
Based on values obtained from each of the five species
(see Methods section), the orthologs were classified into
groups either with low or high dN: 426 were classified
as having a low dN value, and 559 as having a high dN
value. A functional distribution was generated and, significantly, metabolism (amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis and energy generation), and informational

% of changes by species

1416 chromosomal orthologs from five Rhizobiales. The panels
show 1416 orthologs for each of the species (7080 ortholog
products in total). A, the %chSp arranged progressively according to
the % of common identity of each ortholog from the five
organisms (black line). Color dots: orange, R. etli; red, A. tumefaciens;

organisms. Values above 50% were omitted for clarity. Color lines as
in A, with exception of brown for M. loti. C, functional distribution
of orthologs by species signature. Data from R. etli products.
Functions were classified into Metabolism (red line, including amino
acid, nucleotide, fatty acid, and cofactor biosynthesis, central
intermediary metabolism, and energy generation), Information
(green line, DNA metabolism, transcription, translation, and
transcriptional regulators), Processes (blue line, transport; cellular
envelope synthesis, and other cellular processes), and Hypothetical
functions or poorly characterized proteins (orange line).

(transcription and translation) functions tended to be
encoded by genes with low dN values (Figure 3, significant difference by Fisher’s exact test, with p < 0.05). In
contrast, genes belonging to the high dN group had significant abundance of hypothetical functions, and also
contributed particularly to cellular processes (transport
and cellular envelope). The significance of these differences is explained in the Discussion section.
Phylogenetic relationships of orthologs

To detect the phylogenetic relationships in the orthologs
under study, we obtained their phylogenetic trees by
maximum likelihood with Phylip [21]. Three main
topologies were found. The first, which included 52% of
the orthologs, associated R. etli with A. tumefaciens in
the same branch (denoted as R. etli-A. tumefaciens, S.
meliloti, Brucella melitensis-Mesorhizobium loti or a
RA-S-BM topology, for the initials of the species); the
second, comprising 24%, joined R. etli with S. meliloti
(RS-A-BM topology); and the third, with 13%, connected
A. tumefaciens with S. meliloti (AS-R-BM topology). The

Figure 3 Functional distribution of orthologs divided by low or high nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN). The graph was generated
using 985 orthologs with dS < 5; they were divided as described in the Methods section. Functions were grouped into Metabolism (1, amino
acid biosynthesis; 2, nucleotide biosynthesis; 3, fatty acid biosynthesis; 4, cofactor biosynthesis; 5, central intermediary metabolism; and 6, energy
generation), Information (7, DNA metabolism; 8, transcription; 9, translation; and 10, transcriptional regulators), Processes (11, transport; 12, cellular
envelope synthesis; and 13, other cellular processes), and 14, Hypothetical functions. Bar colors: red, orthologs with low dN; blue, orthologs with

remaining possible tree combinations accounted for 11%
of orthologs. A phylogenetic marker, such as 16S rRNA
supports the most abundant phylogeny RA-S-BM, in
agreement with a closer association of R. etli and A.
tumefaciens (Additional file 1) [26]. Other markers, such
as AtpD (RS-A-BM), RecA (RA-S-BM) and DnaJ (RA-SBM) were also found distributed in the main
phylogenies.
Physico-chemical properties of the ortholog products

We applied the five series of values reported by Atchley
et al. [9], to determine how the sequence variability of
the orthologs affects the biochemical characteristics of
the encoded proteins. Each series of values analyzes a
special feature of the residues, namely polarity, secondary structure, volume, amino acid composition, and
electrostatic charge [9]. The calculated values of the
ortholog products spanned a wide range, from negative
to positive values (with the exception of the amino acid
composition, which only gave positive values). The electrostatic charge and volume showed the best correlation
values (Pearson coefficient r = 0.848 in S. meliloti), followed by volume and amino acido composition (r =
-0.662). We detected an atypical group of 110 protein
sequences in polarity (for example, in the comparison
with amino acid composition), consisting almost entirely
of proteins with a high number of transmembrane segments (data not shown). The low polarity of membrane
proteins has long been known [27], confirming the
appropriate application of the method. The rest of the
organisms showed similar tendencies (not shown).
With a clustering method [23], we tried to find relationships among species derived from the physico-

chemical nature of the residues encoded by the orthologs. We generated clustering profiles for each property
(shown for polarity, Figure 4A, and the rest in the Additional file 2) with the most conserved gene set (705 syntenic orthologs with dS < 5). A high level of variation
among each ortholog can be observed, reflecting specific
changes in each of the species. For polarity, a closer
association of R. etli with S. meliloti, followed by A.
tumefaciens in another branch, was observed (an RS-ABM association, Table 1); this relationship was similar
to the second most abundant phylogeny described
above. For the rest of the properties, other associations
were observed: RA-S-BM for secondary structure, electrostatic charge, and volume (Additional file 2 and
Table 1), and again RS-A-BM for amino acid composition (Table 1). These associations revealed which physico-chemical character links most closely with the
species, reflecting the phylogenetic relationship and also
the lifestyle of the organisms. When the complete 1416ortholog set was analyzed, B. melitensis departed clearly
from the rest of species in polarity, charge and amino
acid composition (Table 1, denoted as M-B in independent branches). In the group of Rhizobiales analyzed,
Brucella is the only non free-living organism.
For a more detailed study of niche association by physico-chemical properties, we obtained the clustering for
17 alpha-proteobacterial species and 23 proteins, mainly
from metabolism. The species group covered plant-associated organisms (Methylobacterium, Azospirillum),
plant symbionts (the rhizobia), animal (Bartonella, Anaplasma) and plant (Agrobacterium) pathogens, and freeliving species (Caulobacter, Xanthobacter, Oligotropha,
among others). The most clear cluster associations were

only symbionts, free-living species, or pathogens),
volume and electrostatic charge (with clearly defined
clusters for symbionts or pathogens) (Additional file 3).
In contrast, polarity and secondary structure showed a
majority of phylogenetic associations.
To search for the relationships of physico-chemical
associations with phylogeny, we determined the associations of each group of orthologs with a given phylogeny.
We analyzed the most conserved group, 705 syntenic
orthologs. In the case of 380 orthologs with phylogeny
RA-S-BM, the same association was obtained for secondary structure, volume, and charge (Table 1). The
orthologs with phylogeny RS-A-BM produced the same
association for secondary structure, polarity, and amino
acid composition. The orthologs with the phylogeny ASR-BM showed the same association for secondary structure and charge (Table 1). These data showed that secondary structure was the physico-chemical property
most consistent with phylogeny (because each phylogenetic group showed the same association in that property); in contrast, for polarity, all groups reflected the
same association (RS-A-BM), indicating a strong coherence of that property. For the rest of properties, the
main phylogenetic groups (by number of orthologs, RAS-BM or RS-A-BM) dominated the species association.
We analyzed in more detail groups of products from
the polarity clustering (Figure 4A). Ten clusters were
selected, comprising 83% of the total orthologs under
analysis. Clusters 1, 4, 5, and 7 presented abundance in
metabolic functions, while clusters 9 and 10 were abundant in informational functions. In concordance to their
profile homogenity (red or green in Figure 4, positive or
negative signs in the table of the Additional file 4), their
members showed reduced levels of the percentage of
changes by species (%chSp) (Additional file 4). A cluster
with more diverse levels, such as 8, contained proteins
pertaining to hypothetical functions, with high values of
%chSp (Additional file 4).
In order to have an assessment at the strain level, we
compared the chromosomal orthologs of R. etli CFN42
with R. etli CIAT652, which shows better symbiotic performance than CFN42 [18,28]. We found an almost
identical pattern of polarity between the two strains, but
also found small groups of products with diverse values
(Figure 4B), with a significant abundance of products
belonging to the functional classes of cell wall synthesis,
DNA metabolism and cellular processes (especially
motility) (not shown).
Given the observed functional tendencies described
above, we divided the products having the same sign in

We found an interesting relationship between the functional role of the protein and its sign from the physicochemical property evaluation, which could be related to
specific biochemical requirements for functional performance. For polarity, functions of metabolism and processes were related to negative signs, while
informational functions were strongly related to positive
signs (significant differences with p < 0.05, calculated
with Fisher’s exact test) (Figure 5). Several other
remarkable features were found: for secondary structure,
the negative sign (related to abundant alpha-helical
structures) was associated with informational functions,
and the positive sign (abundant coils) was related with
synthesis of the cellular envelope and hypothetical proteins (Additional file 5). Hypothetical proteins showed
significant abundance of low level amino acid composition (i. e., atypical composition); translation was abundant in protein sequences with positive charge; and
energy and translation functional classes showed residues with high molecular volume (Additional file 5).
To find a relationship between the physico-chemical
characteristics of proteins and evolutionary rates, we

plotted distribution curves for gene groups with low or
high dN and their physico-chemical values, for each of
the properties. A striking general tendency was
observed, because low dN genes presented significant
abundance of sequences with positive sign in polarity,
volume, and electrostatic charge (Additional file 6, significant differences in distribution curves, Mann-Whitney test, with p < 0.05), revealing a specific physicochemical evolution of products.
To determine the relationship of the %chSp with physico-chemical properties, we generated a dispersion
graph, considering the average of the %chSp and the
range of polarity, as shown for example in Figure 6A. A
positive relationship was obtained, revealing that
sequence variability corresponded with diversity in the
character evaluated (a similar tendency was observed in
the rest of the properties, not shown). The dispersion
was analyzed by obtaining clusters with high correlation
values (see Methods). Strikingly, clear tendencies in
molecular weight and isoelectric point were obtained.
The molecular weight was progressively reduced according with a negative slope (Figure 6B), while the opposite
was observed for isoelectric point (Figure 6C). Similar

tendencies were observed in the three other properties,
with the exception of electrostatic charge (not shown).
The first cluster had significant abundance of proteins
from the functional classes of amino acid biosynthesis,
transcription and energy generation (Fisher exact test, p
< 0.05), and the last one was abundant with proteins of
hypothetical functions and some cellular processes (not
shown).

Lastly, we analyzed the data for a specific syntenic
ortholog, argC, the gene that we used previously to
experimentally validate the %chSp approach. We
reported the experimental effect of ortholog replacement
in an S. meliloti argC mutant [29]. The argC from M.
loti showed almost a complete inability to functionally
complement the native gene in minimal medium supplemented with succinate-ammonium or mannose and
nitrate [29]. The M. loti product showed the most differences in volume, secondary structure, and electrostatic charge, in comparison with S. meliloti (in the
table of the Additional file 7). Possibly these three physico-chemical properties were important to define the
phenotypic behavior of M. loti ArgC complementation.
R. etli and A. tumefaciens genes, with similar divergence
to S. meliloti, showed a better complementation phenotype but, interestingly, they also showed some differences. The A. tumefaciens gene produced a reduced
growth ability and exhibited a strong excretion of metabolites, resembling the argC mutant strain [29]. The A.
tumefaciens product was more similar to that of M. loti
in charge and volume (Additional file 7). On the other
hand, the R. etli gene showed a growth phenotype most
resembling that of S. meliloti, and the products from R.
etli and S. meliloti had identical values in volume, and
some similar values in charge; therefore, these properties
can be considered as the most important physico-chemical factors in determining the observed complementation efficiency.

Discussion
Several studies have focused on essential gene recognition and evaluation of evolutionary rates [30-36], but
few studies in bacteria have analyzed the relationship of
evolutionary rates and phylogeny with the functional
role and the physico-chemical properties of a massive
group of proteins. We used new parameters to evaluate
these traits, including the percentage of changes by species (%chSp), and a series of values for physico-chemical
characteristics of amino acid residues; also, we consider
our group of orthologs (mainly syntenic genes), which
perform housekeeping functions and also a diversity of
cellular tasks, as an adequate gene set to study the conserved characteristics among related species, but also to
analyze the ortholog variability and relationship with
function and niche adaptation.
We analyzed 7080 genes (organized in 1416 sets of
five values each) evaluating how their sequence variability could affect the physico-chemical characteristics of
the encoded proteins. Previously, we proposed a parameter, the %chSp, to extract species-specific information
that may be related to the cellular milieu and niche
adaptation [4]. We showed the values and distribution

Peralta et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:48
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/48

of the %chSp of the chromosomal orthologs (two groups
of species were formed), and how the functional classes
showed differential amounts of %chSp (Figure 1). Strikingly, we found a very high correlation of this parameter
with codon evolution (Figure 2), mainly nonsynonymous
substitution rate (dN), indicating that the %chSp is an
efficient way to obtain important evolutive information
directly from the protein sequence. Some homologous
positions in multiple alignments of proteins were
reported earlier to be associated with functional variation [37].
Most importantly, non-neutral variations in genes can
change the potential of the cell for further adaptations
[5,38-41], and even neutral modifications, as explained
in the frame of the constructive neutral evolution, about
fixation of neutral or slightly deleterious mutations [42].
In our case, protein sequences of orthologs presented
different values in each of the five physico-chemical series of values (Figure 5 with polarity as example, and
more pronounced in the rest of properties, Additional
file 5), that reflected the vast amount of specific changes
in each ortholog and species, possibly responding again
to the intracellular milieu and niche adaptation. In the
comparison of orthologs belonging to R. etli strains
[18,28], very few changes were observed (polarity as an
example, Figure 4B), demonstrating the overall closeness
of these organisms. We propose that variability of orthologs determine key properties of the proteins. We found
that changes in orthologs indeed define particular physico-chemical characteristics. In this sense, these findings indicate that changes in orthologs (mainly
nonsynonymous substitutions), defined commonly as
neutral [5,43], determine particular physico-chemical
characteristics that lead to alterations and represent
functional requirements. In this context, it was found
that most of the mutations in ribosomal protein genes
were similar and weakly deleterious but, mostly important, the distribution of fitness for synonymous and
nonsynonymous mutations were similar [44].
In an experimental approach in our laboratory, we
substituted an essential syntenic ortholog (argC) from
the arginine biosynthetic pathway of Sinorhizobium
meliloti, and expressed argC orthologs from other Rhizobiales in that background, with the aim of demonstrating the relationships of particular residues with
function and evolution. By a physiological, enzymatic,
transcriptional, and proteomic characterization we
found that several factors, such as the type of promoter and the percentage of changes by species, determined different functionality and levels of transcription
and translation of the ArgC protein [29]. We used the
physico-chemical series of values obtained by Atchley,
to correlate the physico-chemical properties of the
proteins with the real phenotype and performance of

Page 10 of 15

argC orthologs, in a S. meliloti background. As
observed in Additional file 7, the R. etli ortholog, with
more similar physico-chemical values to S. meliloti,
showed the most resembling phenotype; followed by
the A. tumefaciens gene, the M. loti argC showed a
severe growth deficiency and very different physicochemical values, in comparison with S. meliloti. As Dr.
Koonin and collaborators said regarding our work [45],
it is necessary to consider that functional conservation
among orthologs should be inferred with caution
because some orthologs genes can diverge functionally
even among closely related organisms. Also, there are
other factors that influence adaptation in bacteria,
such as compensatory gene amplification after orthologous replacement [46], which was also found in our
work.
Most essential functions, such as information and
metabolism were significantly covered by low dN genes
in the five species, showing more restriction to evolution; in contrast, orthologs with high dN were functionally more flexible, abundant in hypothetical functions
and cellular processes, but perhaps also showed more
dispensability (Figure 3). The differences in evolutionary
rates of genes have been adscribed to functional constraints, but a debate is open to clarify the importance
of translational costs, reflected in misfolding [47], structural factors [48,49], and even pleiotropy [50], as the factors influencing the evolution of proteins. The
compositional and adaptation codon bias in genes are
important characteristics of GC-rich organisms, such as
the Rhizobiales, because these traits are related to
increased expressivity [51-53]. We found that low dN
genes had high CAI values (not shown) showing, as
others have, that codon bias is a selective force in these
genes and a negative correlation of expressivity and evolutionary rates exists [54-56].
We found that the series of values reported by Atchley
[9] were very useful to discern the contribution of physico-chemical factors of amino acids to the characteristics of the ortholog products. These values summarize
the amino acid features into five biochemical characteristics, namely polarity, secondary structure, amino acid
composition, molecular volume, and electrostatic charge
[9]. We found the global correlations among the physico-chemical properties that can be possibly generalized
to all bacterial proteins. Interestingly, we found a group
of products, clearly differentiated from the rest by polarity, composed almost exclusively by proteins with many
transmembranal segments (not shown). This result confirmed that these series of values can detect specific features of residues forming part of proteins. Recently,
Marsella et al. [57], using the series of values reported
by Atchley detected an especial periodicity of solenoid
secondary structures. In another study, the same series

Peralta et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:48
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/48

of values were used to define niche adaptation of prokaryotic organisms from extreme environments [58].
When orthologs were related by their physico-chemical features, species associations were similar to the
most abundant phylogenies, indicating a link between
characteristics of proteins and species evolution (Figure
4A, and Additional file 2); however, they also showed
differences that may account for other structural factors
related to intra- and extra-cellular environments in
shared niches, for example R. etli products most closely
related to those from S. meliloti in polarity and amino
acid composition (possibly because both organisms are
symbionts), but most closely to A. tumefaciens products
in secondary structure, volume, and electrostatic charge
(in this case, close phylogenetically relatedness can be
argued). These relationships shed light about the importance of considering an approach such as that described
here. In this regard, in comparison with classical phylogeny, the physico-chemical approach of species association can give an additional amount of information. B.
melitensis orthologs, despite their closer phylogenetic
relationship with R. etli, S. meliloti and A. tumefaciens,
departed from the other four species in amino acid
composition, charge and polarity (not shown), possibly
reflecting differential adaptation in this set of orthologs;
Brucella is the only species of the analyzed with a non
free lifestyle. Recently, it was reported that B. melitensis
has a more basic proteome than the rest of Rhizobiales,
possibly in response to its intracellular lifestyle [59], in
addition to being subjected to genomic erosion processes (such as gene loss, pseudogenization, and reduction of CAI), like other intracellular organisms [60-63].
In the clustering analysis covering many alpha-proteobacterial species and their typical lifestyles, clear niche
associations were found for some properties (Additional
file 3).
A remarkable result was the observation that orthologs with low nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN)
were associated with specific amino acid characters,
such as higher polarity and electrostatic charge, and
large molecular volume (Additional file 6), possibly
reflecting physico-chemical tendencies of the evolution
of genes. Additionally, the functions of orthologs were
related with the particular sign of values from physicochemical property evaluation (Figure 5, and Additional
file 5), indicating more or less strict specific biochemical
requirements of the residues in the proteins to perform
their role. In some cases, there were clear differences
between the metabolic and informational functions, or
between the metabolic and processes functions. Furthermore, some of the hypothetical protein sequences
appeared with the same sign as that of metabolic genes
or genes encoding proteins involved in processes; the
qualification with these series of values would be useful

Page 11 of 15

in the eventual functional characterization of the
hypothetical proteins. Additionally, interesting tendencies were found regarding molecular weight and isoelectric point, along with the increase of the percentage of
changes by species (Figure 6). These findings clearly
merit a more detailed analysis.

Conclusions
In this work, we found that the sequence variability of
the chromosomal orthologs of the Rhizobiales species
under study have evolutionary and functional implications, closely related to the physico-chemical properties
of the products. We found that the percentage of
changes by species of the orthologs directly reflects the
nonsynonymous substitution rate; and that there was a
relationship of the physico-chemical characteristics of
residues encoded in the proteins with evolution and specific functional requirements. This genomic study contributes to the understanding of factors that connect the
evolution of genes with the physico-chemical characteristics of the proteins and their functional adaptation.
Reviewers comments
Reviewer report 1. Dr. Purificación López-García, Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique, France

Peralta and co-workers present a comparative analysis of
1416 orthologous proteins shared by five species of Rhizobiales, three plant symbionts, one plant pathogen and
one animal pathogen. After carrying out phylogenetic
analyses of those orthologs and finding three major
topologies, Peralta et al. study the sequence variability of
a subset of these proteins by looking at the number of
synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions and a related measurement, the “species signature”
defined as the number of species-specific amino acid
residues. The authors study possible correlations
between protein sequence variability and a series of
associated properties (polarity, electrostatic charge, secondary structure, molecular volume and amino acid
composition) and find particular trends, which suggest
that particular physico-chemical properties are associated with particular functional roles. The authors
further speculate that much sequence variation is not
related to phylogeny but to adaptation to particular
niches. Although the last conclusion needs further testing, the overall work is properly done and interesting
and I have only some relatively minor comments.
Author’s response: Thanks for your commentary. Effectively, the question about how much of the divergence
belong to neutral variation and what amount to adaptation is our departure point for the analysis. For a long
time, we have wondered about how to disect the problem. We consider that our approach is useful to analyze
in detail the sequence variability and we are beginning

Peralta et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:48
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/48

to find answers about this issue. Please, also see our
response for the last question.
My first comment relates to the “species signature”.
The authors find “striking” to see a “correlation of this
parameter with codon evolution, mainly nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN), indicating that the species
signature is efficient to obtain important evolutive information, directly from the protein sequence”. This is not
striking at all since, even if dN is estimated from DNA
sequence, it corresponds in fine to changes in amino
acid sequence, so that the “species signature” is but a
subset of the amino acid changes resulting from nonsynonymous substitutions (dN). It is normal that they
both contain evolutionary information because the two
measures are correlated. What I do not understand well
is the advantage of the “species signature” versus dN.
The number of non-synonymous substitutions is independent of taxonomic sampling, but the “species signature” depends on taxonomic sampling. By contrast to
dN, as more and more strains or species genome
sequences become available within a genus, the “species
signature” will most likely progressively decrease and
eventually reach zero (especially if one considers orthologs for a same protein from the whole tree of life). In
this sense, the use of the “species signature” seems limited and restricted to particular case studies.
Author’s response: We eliminated the word “striking” in
the beginning of the mentioned paragraph. Our proposal
of species signature is devoted to distinguish certain differences in closely related genomes. The signature reaches
zero when sequences from organisms show less phylogenetic differences; i. e., ideally when they form part of the
same species.
The authors show that changes in orthologs correlate
with particular physico-chemical properties of the corresponding proteins and, hence, likely functional adaptation to particular niches. However, this correlation
remains at a theoretical, predictive level. Since the studied proteins are annotated and their functions known,
it would be very illustrative if the authors could point at
one or several particular examples and explain them in
the context of their analysis.
Author’s response: With the last analysis in the Results
section, we tried to relate the phenotypic experimental
differences of the argC complementing strains with its
physico-chemical properties.
As stated in the Discussion section, even when each
ortholog performs the same function in a given genome,
without doubt the gene (and its product) must be
adapted in order to respond to a particular physiological
environment.
Although the mentioned proposal seems speculative, it
is important to take into account our recent publication

Page 12 of 15

(Díaz et al., J. Bacteriol. 193:460-472, 2011), in which
our results from complementation experiments showed
that the substitution of the S. meliloti argC gene, with
the corresponding ortholog from other Rhizobiales species,
was not completely functional, and also affected the
growth, transcription rate and translation, and possibly
the whole cellular physiology. Indeed, as Dr. Koonin said
recently of our work (Kristensen, et al., Brief. Bioinf.,
2011, doi:10/1093/bib/bbr030), it is necessary to consider
that functional conservation among orthologs should be
inferred with caution, because some orthologous genes
can diverge functionally even among closely related
organisms. As a matter of fact, this manuscript was the
initial approach that allowed us to design the experiments of the already published work.
Reviewer report 2. Prof. Jeffrey Townsend (nominated by
Prof. J. Peter Gogarten), Yale University, United States

The revised manuscript clarifies the “species signature”
metric used, and addresses issues related to its comparison to dN fairly satisfactorily. The manuscript does not
improve or extend its results by applying either of the
two approaches recommended that would considerably
empower the conclusions being drawn.
From the original review:
First, the relationships between physico-chemical characteristics of residues encoded and functional category
of the gene could be analyzed with more specific and
powerful statistical approaches. In particular, instead of
dividing a continuous range arbitrarily into two discrete
categories to perform purely categorical statistical analyses, a more powerful approach would consist of performing logistic regressions with the continuous variable
on the x-axis and the categorical on the y (i.e. high or
low dN as a continuous predictor of functional category). Second, the manuscript addresses gene-wide evolutionary rate and correlates it to gene-wide physicochemical metrics. Because each of these metrics is “averaged” across a gene, considerable power to detect
important signal is lost. A more direct way to assess
these questions would be to correlate evolutionary rates
of individual sites and physico-chemical properties of
those sites. Examining the rates of evolution of sites and
of physico-chemical properties of amino acids could also
better clarify the phylogenetic discrepancies among
orthologs noted in this manuscript. These discrepancies
among inferences from the orthologs are noted, but are
attributed without much detail to selection based on
ecological niche, and are not directly evaluated in terms
of potential phylogenetic signal, noise, or horizontal
gene transfer of the gene sequences, all of which may
play roles in the different results achieved when analyzed solo for phylogenetic inference.

Reviewer report 3. Ms. Olga Kamneva, University of
Wyoming, United States

The authors analyzed the set of orthologous gene
families from five strains of five different species of Rhizobiales using several techniques, the authors aim to
characterize patterns of sequence evolution in relation
to physical properties of encoded proteins within gene
families and examine how change of protein physicochemical properties is related to niche adaptation.
I think that while the authors had an interesting and
novel idea, to investigate how the physical properties of
evolutionary related proteins are changed across related
organisms of distinct life styles I feel that quality of the
study can be significantly improved by shifting the focus
of the study from trying to find correlation between
change of physical properties and evolutionary rates to
characterizing mechanisms and consequences of change
of the physical properties. I also have some technical
comments.
Specific comments:
1. The study should benefit from using one of the
clustering based approaches to identify gene families
with subsequent inference of orthologs. Using bidirectional best hit for this leads to under-determination of
inparalogs within orthologous groups, as well as including xenologs into the gene families.
2. The study would also benefit from using modern
phylogeny inference software (PhyML or RaxML), the
results should not differ much but will be more robust.
3. A dS threshold value of 5 is too high, dS values larger than 3 is considered to be a sign of synonymous
sites saturation even when estimated using maximum
likelihood [Z. Yang, personal communication http://gsf.
gc.ucdavis.edu/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2291&p=3967&hilit=saturation&sid=224cf845cae40709bad44196fb33ffed#]
Also the threshold should be applied to the depth of the
whole tree, not just certain branches. If synonymous
sites are saturated dS will be determined wrong and it
does not matter what it is used for, dN/dS calculation
or to see how well dS correlates with something else
(not dN).
4. The authors use “percentage of changes by species”
as measure of species-specific protein sequence variation. As it is explained in the manuscript and follows
from the name of the metric, “percentage of changes by
species” is a percentage of the protein alignment columns where the sequence from one particular species
has a different residue than the rest of the alignment
column. Basically “percentage of changes by species” is a
crude approximation of the number of amino acid substitutions that occurred on a branch leading to the
sequence over the total length of the sequence. The
only benefit of the used metric is the ease of calculation,
while terminal branch length of protein gene trees (or

Page 13 of 15

dN trees) appears to be an estimate of the same thing
and be technically more rigorous. I suggest not using
“percentage of changes by species” for this study at all.
5. Figure 2 in my opinion should be omitted as well as
use of “percentage of changes by species”.
6. I like the idea of clustering organisms based on the
physical properties of proteins in gene families (Figure 5
and Additional file 3). Correlation between life style and
proteome properties was shown before [Tekaia F et al.
Gene. 2002.], ref [58,59] of the manuscript, while underlying biology of these observed patterns is unknown.
Looking at changes of physical properties of evolutionary related proteins from organisms of different life style
is novel. However with only one animal pathogen and
one plant pathogen in the set (Figure 5), it is not possible to recover something meaningful while on the Additional file 3 only clustering based on amino acid
composition is clear. Thus I am not sure if conclusion
about correlation of protein properties and species ecology has much of support.
7. Figure 5 shows proteins which are extremely polar
in one genome and extremely non-polar in another. It is
interesting to see how this shift in polarity or any other
property occurs. Is it caused by an additional domain
which perturbs the average or it is due to point mutations? It is also interesting to see how this shift affects
structure/function of the proteins. 1-2 case studies
should be shown (alignments, comparison of protein
structures, conservation/alteration of functionally important residues). It would be a first attempt to reveal
molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation
between ecology of microbes and properties of their
proteomes.
