to Verticillium dahliae involves H2O2, peroxidase
and lignins and drives PAL gene expression

Abstract
Background: Verticillium dahliae is a fungal pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts. The only known genes for
resistance to Verticillium in the Solanaceae are found in the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Ve locus, formed by two
linked genes, Ve1 and Ve2. To characterize the resistance response mediated by the tomato Ve gene, we inoculated
two nearly isogenic tomato lines, LA3030 (ve/ve) and LA3038 (Ve/Ve), with V. dahliae.
Results: We found induction of H2O2 production in roots of inoculated plants, followed by an increase in
peroxidase activity only in roots of inoculated resistant plants. Phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL) activity was also
increased in resistant roots 2 hours after inoculation, while induction of PAL activity in susceptible roots was not
seen until 48 hours after inoculation. Phenylpropanoid metabolism was also affected, with increases in ferulic acid,
p-coumaric acid, vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde contents in resistant roots after inoculation. Six tomato PAL
cDNA sequences (PAL1 - PAL6) were found in the SolGenes tomato EST database. RT-PCR analysis showed that
these genes were expressed in all organs of the plant, albeit at different levels. Real-time RT-PCR indicated distinct
patterns of expression of the different PAL genes in V. dahliae-inoculated roots. Phylogenetic analysis of 48 partial
PAL cDNAs corresponding to 19 plant species grouped angiosperm PAL sequences into four clusters, suggesting
functional differences among the six tomato genes, with PAL2 and PAL6 presumably involved in lignification, and
the remaining PAL genes implicated in other biological processes.
An increase in the synthesis of lignins was found 16 and 28 days after inoculation in both lines; this increase was
greater and faster to develop in the resistant line. In both resistant and susceptible inoculated plants, an increase in
the ratio of guaiacyl/syringyl units was detected 16 days after inoculation, resulting from the lowered amount of
syringyl units in the lignins of inoculated plants.
Conclusions: The interaction between the tomato and V. dahliae triggered a number of short- and long-term
defensive mechanisms. Differences were found between compatible and incompatible interactions, including onset
of H2O2 production and activities of peroxidase and PAL, and phenylpropanoid metabolism and synthesis of
lignins.

Background
Verticillium wilt, caused by the vascular fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb., limits the production of a wide range
of economically important crops [1]. Once the fungus
infects a field, it is very persistent because it colonizes
such non-host plants as cereals, which then act as reservoirs for the fungus. Furthermore, the fungus develops

resistant structures known as microsclerotia that are capable of survival in the soil for decades. Significant losses
are caused by this pathogen, and currently there are no
efficient management methods for its control. The Verticillium spp. are among the most damaging pathogens
threatening cultivation of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and are responsible for serious economic losses
both in greenhouses and in the field. The cultivation of
resistant varieties has proven to be an appropriate strategy for combating plant pathogens because of its efficacy,
low cost, and limited environmental impact. Recent

developments in molecular biology have made it possible
to transfer resistance genes between unrelated species
and have revealed that the molecular events in the resistance response elicited from recognition of the pathogen
are often conserved among plants of the same family [2].
The only Verticillium resistance genes in Solanaceae
that are now known are those of the tomato Ve locus.
This locus is formed by two linked genes, Ve1 and Ve2,
each capable of conferring resistance to different Verticillium species. The structure of the Ve genes suggests
that they code for cell-surface glycoproteins with signals
for receptor-mediated endocytosis and with leucine zipper motifs (in Ve1) or PEST sequences (in Ve2) [3].
Potato plants transformed with either of the Ve genes
acquired resistance against Verticillium, demonstrating
that the cell machinery required for the incompatible
(no disease) interaction with Verticillium is present and
functional in other Solanaceae species.
Events in the early stages of a plant’s response to an
infecting pathogen determine the degree of colonization
and the damage caused. An incompatible interaction
generally seems to require the presence in the plant of a
cognate resistance gene against an avirulence factor of
the pathogen [4]. However, incompatibility is probably
related more to the timing of induction of defense genes
and factors than to qualitative differences in the set of
genes expressed when compared to compatible systems
[5]. During an incompatible interaction, plant cells
respond with such resistance strategies as (i) generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (ii) induction of a
hypersensitive response, a localized cell-death reaction
that confines the infection to its initial location, (iii)
expression of pathogenesis-related genes and other toxic
peptides, (iv) synthesis of phytoalexins, (v) stabilization
of cell walls, and (vi) closure of the stomata [6].
The production of oxygen intermediates during the
so-called oxidative burst is characteristic of the defensive
response in plants [7]. Increased levels of ROS, notably
the superoxide anion (O 2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), kill the pathogen or limit colonization by triggering a hypersensitive response in the infected plant
tissue [8]. H2O2 is the most stable oxygen intermediate
and is involved in the cross-linking of cell wall components [9], regulation of pathogenesis-related gene
expression [10], transduction of the hypersensitive
response [7], and killing of invading pathogens [11].
H 2O 2 also acts as a signaling molecule in the cellular
collapse that occurs during the hypersensitive response,
and in systemic acquired resistance [12].
The peroxidases (PODs; EC 1.11.1.7; donor H 2 O 2 oxidoreductase) are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of different substrates using H 2 O2 .
They also produce ROS as a result of their peroxidative
and hydroxylic catalytic cycles [13]. Peroxidases are

Page 2 of 19

widely distributed in the plant kingdom [14,15] and are
active in such physiological processes as ferulate dimerization [16], phenol oxidation [17] and lignification
[18,19]; these mechanisms may be activated in the
defensive response against pathogens [20].
Some authors have reported the involvement of peroxidases in the formation of phenylpropanoid dimers using
equimolar mixtures of hydroxycinnamic acid [21]. Peroxidases contribute to the construction of the cell wall.
These actions include intervention in the possible covalent binding of tyrosine residues from extensin and
other cell wall glycoproteins with dimers of hydroxycinnamic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid bound to pectins
or some xylans. Peroxidases are also involved in the biosynthesis of lignins, in the deposition of lignin bound to
cell wall glycoproteins, and in the process of suberization [22].
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; L-phenylalanine
ammonia lyase, EC 4.3.1.5) is the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. PAL catalyzes the
deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, the
common precursor for the synthesis of all phenol derivatives. A number of studies have reported increased PAL
expression and activity in response to environmental stimuli, such as cold [23], wounding [24] and UV-B light
[25]. Silencing of PAL genes in transgenic tobacco lines
inhibits the salicylate production normally seen after
tobacco mosaic virus infection, and abolishes systemic
acquired resistance [26]. PAL over-expression in tobacco
leads to production of large amounts of chlorogenic acid,
and a marked reduction in sensitivity to infection by the
fungus Cercospora nicotianae [27].
In higher plants, PAL is found as a family of homologous genes. The significance of this diversity is unclear,
but is consistent with the complexity of metabolic pathways in phenylpropanoid metabolism. Four PAL genes
have been described in Arabidopsis [28], five in pine
and tomato [29,30], and a total of 16 in the genome of a
diploid potato hybrid [31].
The onset of phenylpropanoid metabolism is another
crucial defensive mechanism [32]. This results in hydroxycinnamic acids with a characteristic C6C3 phenylpropane
skeleton being produced from the primary metabolite phenylalanine. The functions of the phenylpropanoids are very
diverse: some are pigments, others phytoalexins, phytoanticipins, UV-protectants or signals mediating the interaction between plants and microorganisms. Furthermore,
some phenylpropanoids can polymerize and form defensive structures, such as lignin [33]. There is strong
evidence to suggest that esterification of phenols, such as
ferulic or p-coumaric acids, to cell walls is a common
phenomenon in the expression of resistance [34-36]. It is
generally thought that phenols play an important role in
the modification of the mechanical properties of cell walls

[37], limiting polysaccharide degradation by exogenous
enzymes [38,39] and increasing cell wall rigidity by linking
polysaccharides and lignin [40].
Lignins are amorphous heteropolymers that result from
oxidative coupling of p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl
alcohols, forming the subunits H (hydroxyphenyl),
G (guaiacyl) and S (syringyl), respectively. Lignins are primarily deposited in cell walls of tissues as tracheids,
veins, fibers of xylem and phloem, and schlereids. Lignin
composition varies depending on the tissue. For example,
lignins type G are predominant in Arabidopsis xylem,
while in schlerenchyma cells lignins type S are more
commonly found [41]. Lignification of cell walls is a key
event in resistance against pests in herbaceous or woody
plants and resistant genotypes possess a greater accumulation of lignins [42]. Ratios among lignin subunits
change after a pathogen attack [43]. Several mechanisms
have been postulated to explain the role of lignins in
resistance, including sealing of cell walls [38] or direct
biocidal effects of phenolic lignin precursors [44].
In this study we examine H2O2 production, peroxidase
and PAL activity, expression of PAL genes and lignin accumulation in two nearly isogenic tomato lines after exposure to V. dahliae, one line carrying the Ve resistance gene
and the other not. This characterization of Ve-mediated
resistance at the molecular level may allow identification
of factors which, after induction, can trigger resistance
responses in tomato and in other Solanaceae.

Results
H2O2 content

H 2 O 2 production in roots of control and V. dahliaeinoculated resistant and susceptible tomato plants was
measured using the xylenol orange method, which is
very sensitive for the detection of low levels of soluble

Page 3 of 19

hydroperoxides. Definite variations in the production of
H2O2 were found in both tomato lines, whether inoculated or not (Figure 1). At 2 hours post-inoculation
(hpi) a dramatic increase in H2O2 content was observed
in the roots of inoculated resistant plants, with a maximum peroxide concentration found at 8 hpi, when
H2O2 content was three times higher than that in resistant controls or in inoculated susceptible plants. In
resistant plants, a second lesser increase was detected
between 24 hpi and 48 hpi. In inoculated susceptible
plants, a single increase was observed starting at 2 hpi,
reaching a peak at 16 hpi. At the final time point monitored, 192 hpi, H2O2 content was similar in control and
inoculated roots of the two lines.
Peroxidase (POD) activity

Because the binding of phenolic compounds to the cell
wall is mediated by peroxidases and, during plant-pathogen interactions, this binding occurs at the expense of a
massive generation of H2O2 [27], we monitored peroxidase activity. In our experiments, the inoculation of resistant plants with V. dahliae led to a rapid increase in
peroxidase activity in roots, detectable at 2 hpi (Figure 2).
Similar activity levels were then maintained from 4 and 8
hpi; subsequently another increase in peroxidase activity
was observed, reaching a maximum between 24 hpi and
48 hpi. No appreciable changes were detected in inoculated susceptible roots throughout the experiment. At the
end of the study period (192 hpi), similar peroxidase
activities were found in susceptible, resistant, inoculated
and control samples.
Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity

The crucial role of PAL within plant secondary metabolism reflects its function as a catalyst for the first step of

phenylpropanoid metabolism. We found an increase in
PAL activity in roots of inoculated resistant plants,
detectable at 4 hpi, with a maximum at 8 hpi, when
activity was approximately 3-fold higher than initial
values (Figure 3). After 16 hpi, PAL activity decreased,
and by 24 hpi it was identical to that in controls and in
inoculated susceptible plants. In inoculated susceptible
plants, PAL activity peaked at 48 hpi, at around 70% of
the maximum value seen in inoculated resistant plants,
although it was 50% higher than in inoculated resistant
plants at the same time point. At 192 hpi, PAL activity
was similar in roots of both lines, whether inoculated or
not.
RT-PCR of PAL genes from different organs

After detection of the rapid increase in PAL activity in
roots of inoculated resistant plants, we studied possible
differences in the level of expression of different tomato
PAL genes. An extensive search was performed in the
NCBI and TIGR databases for cDNA and contig
sequences of the tomato PAL genes. As a result, the
sequences of 6 tomato PAL genes that differed in their
noncoding 3’ ends were determined (Figure 4). The
b-tubulin gene was chosen as a constitutive gene for
quantification experiments.
Following RNA extraction from roots, hypocotyls, epicotyls, cotyledons, leaves and flowers from resistant and
susceptible tomato plants, the corresponding cDNAs
were synthesized and PCR amplifications carried out
(Figure 5A). Amplicons from PAL2, PAL3, PAL4 and
PAL6 were clearly visualized on ethidium bromidestained agarose gels when 5 ng RNA was used as the
starting material. In contrast, for visualization of

Page 4 of 19

amplicons, 200 ng RNA was required for PAL5 and 600
ng RNA for PAL1 in all organs analyzed. This finding
indicated the existence of different levels of expression
of the PAL genes in the tomato. In summary, expression
of the six PAL genes could be detected in all organs studied, albeit at different levels, with lower expression
levels for PAL5 and lowest for PAL1.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis of PAL2, PAL3, PAL4 and PAL6
in tomato roots

We next analyzed root samples from LA3030 and
LA3038 tomato plants using real-time RT-PCR. Because
of the extremely low levels of expression of the PAL1
and PAL5 genes, which led to inconsistent results from
RT-PCR, we considered only the four remaining PAL
genes. The results showed slight differences in expression among these genes (Figure 5B). The highest relative
expression value was found for PAL2, followed by PAL3
and PAL4, which had similar expression levels. The lowest level of expression was found for PAL6. This was the
only gene that showed any significant difference
between LA3030 and LA3038 plants: its expression level
was three times higher in LA3038, the resistant plant.
Real-time RT-PCR analysis of the main PAL genes
in V. dahliae-inoculated roots

We then used real-time RT-PCR to quantify the expression of PAL2, PAL3, PAL4 and PAL6 at specific intervals
following inoculation of resistant and susceptible tomato
roots with V. dahliae (Figure 6).
PAL2 showed maximum expression in inoculated
resistant plants at 4 hpi and then decreased to a level
similar to the controls by 8 hpi. The maximum level

was 6 times higher than that in the control plants of
both lines. In contrast, in inoculated susceptible plants,
PAL2 showed a significant decrease in expression as
early as 4 hpi (P-value < 0.05).
PAL3 expression in inoculated resistant plants showed
a detectable increase at 4 hpi, with the maximum level
reached at 8 hpi. The maximum level was 9 times
higher than that in the controls and in inoculated susceptible plants. In inoculated susceptible plants, there
was an increase in gene expression of PAL3 at 48 hpi, a
level 3.5 times higher than in the controls and double
that seen in the inoculated resistant plants at that time.
Interestingly, this was the only increase in expression of
a PAL gene seen in susceptible plants.
PAL4 expression was slightly higher in all the inoculated resistant plants than in the inoculated susceptible
plants.
PAL6 showed a dramatic increase in expression in the
inoculated resistant plants at 8 hpi, with a level of
expression approximately 60 times higher than that seen
in the control plants of both lines and in the inoculated
susceptible plants.
Phylogenetic relationships among plant PAL genes

The sequences of 48 PAL genes, belonging to 19 plant
species, stored in the GenBank database (Table 1) were
retrieved and compared to the six tomato cDNA
sequences. A 116-nucleotide sequence from the 3’ end
of the coding region was chosen for the comparison.
The resulting maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree
(Figure 7) was rooted in the sequences from the most
ancient species, the pteridophyte Isoetes lacustis and the
spikemoss Selaginella kraussiana. Sequences from all

angiosperm species were grouped in four different clusters (A, B, C and D), with the Equisetum arvense (Pteridophyta) and Picea abies (Gymnosperma) sequences in
two independent branches. The 6 PAL genes from
S. lycopersicum were placed in two different clusters,
A and B. In cluster A, besides the tomato genes PAL2
and PAL6, most of the gene sequences belonged to
woody plants (Populus kitakamiensis, Populus tremuloides, Coffea canephora and Quercus suber); though
sequences from Trifolium pratense, Nicotiana tabacum
and Daucus carota were also included in this cluster.
The four remaining tomato genes (PAL1, PAL3, PAL4
and PAL5) were placed in cluster B, together with
sequences from other dicotyledonous species including
N. tabacum, D. carota, Solanum tuberosum, Capsicum
chinense and Ipoema batatas. A third cluster, C, was
composed of the PAL sequences from monocotyledonous species (Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa and Triticum aestivum) and a fourth cluster, D, was exclusively
formed by the four PAL sequences from A. thaliana.
Phenolic compounds in roots

To investigate the effects of V. dahliae inoculation on the
contents of phenolic compounds, root samples were collected and analyzed. Some phenols, notably hydroxycinnamic acids, are involved in cell wall reinforcement,
which enhances plant resistance to fungal colonization of
the vascular system. Therefore, we determined whether
there were any changes in the levels of specific phenols
related to cell wall reinforcement. Two hydroxycinnamic
acids, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, and their respective benzaldehydes, vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde,
were analyzed using reverse-phase HPLC. Ferulic acid

levels showed only a small increase in inoculated resistant plants at 2 hpi, while p-coumaric acid level showed
an increase between 16 and 96 hpi. The vanillin level was
significantly higher in inoculated resistant plants between
96 and 192 hpi. p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was found in
inoculated resistant roots between 24 and 192 hpi. No
changes in levels of these phenols were observed in susceptible plants (Table 2).
Lignin content, monomer composition and cross-linking
in roots

The total lignin content of cell walls, as measured by
acetyl bromide is shown in Table 3. An increase in lignin content was observed in inoculated resistant roots
at 16 and 28 days post-inoculation (dpi). In inoculated

susceptible roots, the increase was not found until 28
dpi. Nitrobenzene oxidation in an alkaline medium
degrades lignins forming p-hydroxybenzaldehyde from
hydroxyphenyl (H), vanillin from guaiacyl (G) and syringyl aldehyde from syringyl (S). Table 3 also shows
the relative monomeric composition of cell walls of
susceptible and resistant roots at 16 and 28 dpi, calculated after nitrobenzene oxidation. In inoculated plants
at 16 dpi, there was an increase in percentage of
G-units at the expense of S groups. The increase in
G groups produces higher G/S ratios at 16 dpi after
V. dahliae inoculation. At 28 dpi, the G/S ratio was
the same among control and inoculated resistant or
susceptible plants, but an increase in H subunits was
detected.

Numbers in gene names indicate multiple homologues from the same plant species.

The possibility of other qualitative changes in composition and structure of cell walls was assessed using the
thioacidolysis degradative method. Fragments resulting
from thioacidolysis were identified by GC/MS. We
found primarily thioethylated monomers (erythro- and
threo- isomers) resulting from aryl-glycerol-b-aryl ether
structures derived from coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols
and from their respective cinnamyl aldehydes. Terminal
O-4 structures from coniferyl alcohol, p-coumaric acid,
ferulic acid, vanillin and dihydroconiferyl alcohol were
also found. Table 4 shows the values of ionic current for
all fragments. A general increase in abundance of a large

majority of fragments was found at 28 dpi in inoculated
plants, resistant or not, in concordance with the results
from acetyl bromide. At 28 dpi, inoculated resistant
plants had significant increases in b-O-4 monomers and
also showed a 3.3-fold increase in coniferyl aldehyde, a
8.4-fold increase in the terminal O-4 monomers of dihydroconiferyl alcohol, and a 4.2 increase in vanillin.
Comparing the ratios among different groups of
monomers, considering their chemical nature and type
of bond, at 16 dpi an increase in the ratio guaiacyl/syringyl was found in inoculated plants from around 1.4 to
more than 2.0 (Table 5). At 16 dpi, G/S ratios were

lower than those found after nitrobenzene oxidation, in
agreement with the higher level of G groups of the condensed nucleus of lignins, as compared to the linear
fraction susceptible to be degraded by thioacidolysis.
This increase disappeared at 28 dpi, when ratios in both
control and inoculated plants were similar. The ratio
between b-O-4 and O-4 terminal monomers, indicating
the level of polymerization of the linear fraction of lignins, decreased at 16 dpi from values close to 100 in the
controls to 13.1 in inoculated susceptible and 6.1 in
inoculated resistant plants. This decrease in the ratio
was primarily due to a dramatic increase in O-4

terminal groups, particularly of ferulic acid, in the
inoculated plants.
Increases of the aldehydes, vanillin and cinnamaldehydes, detected by thioacidolysis were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy analyses. The FT-IR spectroscopy of root
cell walls showed an absorption band at 1650 cm-1 (Table
6). This band is clearly attributable to the C = O stretching vibration of conjugated/aromatic aldehydes, in which
the carbonyl oxygen atom sustains either intramolecular
or intermolecular H-bonds [43]. At 16 dpi, inoculated
plants showed an increased level of conjugated/aromatic
aldehydes in cell walls, which increased further at 28 dpi.

Discussion
One of the objectives of this study was to monitor any
variations in H 2 O 2 content and peroxidase and PAL
enzyme activities during the tomato-V. dahliae interaction. Both enzymes are frequently considered to be key
players in the development of plant resistance against
pathogens [45]. Their coordinated actions results in
changes in the relative amounts of phenylpropanoid
compounds, commonly regarded as defensive compounds themselves [46]. To analyze this, two nearly isogenic tomato lines differing in the presence of the Ve
gene conferring resistance to Verticillium were used.
H2O2 production is one of the markers of the oxidative burst that is one of the most rapid events associated
with the hypersensitive response in plant-pathogen
interactions [12,47]. After V. dahliae inoculation of
resistant tomato plants, we observed a rapid increase in
H2O2 content in roots at 2 hpi, with a second smaller

peak at 48 hpi. The increase in H 2 O 2 content was
slightly delayed in roots of susceptible plants, reaching
its peak at 16 hpi. The rapid increase seen in resistant
plants is probably related to several known defense
mechanisms. H2O2 has been proposed to act directly as
a toxic compound for microbes [11]; to contribute to
cell wall reinforcement in plants [48]; and to be responsible for lipid peroxidation and salicylic acid synthesis
[49]. In addition, H2O2 may also play a role in the signal
transduction cascade, triggering the coordinate expression of different genes involved in the defensive
response, such as those responsible for the hypersensitive response or for the synthesis of pathogenesis-related
proteins [50,51]. The second increase in H2O2 content
seen in resistant roots at 48 hpi may reflect the onset of
a systemic response, and is in agreement with the timing
of systemic pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression
and the beginning of salicylic acid accumulation in the
tomato [52]. When we monitored changes in peroxidase
activity following V. dahliae inoculation, we found a
small early increase in roots of resistant plants. By 96
hpi, peroxidase activity was the same as in the control
samples. Notably, the similar induction of H2O2 production in susceptible and resistant plants was not paralleled by comparable increases in peroxidase activity in
susceptible plants. Peroxidase activity is the result of the
action of a large number of enzymes with similar functions. H2O2 detoxification in roots of resistant plants is
probably due to simultaneous actions of peroxidases and
catalase, while the latter is probably predominant in susceptible plants. In any case, H2O2 detoxification is an
efficient mechanism in both resistant and susceptible
roots. There was a general decline in peroxidase activity
over time in all samples, probably related to the aging
processes.
Considering the essential role of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in phenolic metabolism, we decided to

determine any changes in PAL activity during the infection process. PAL catalyzes the first step in the metabolic route responsible for the synthesis of a vast array
of plant compounds based on a phenylpropanoid skeleton Peak PAL activity was observed in roots of inoculated resistant plants at 8 hpi, with a later second minor
increase. In susceptible plants, there was an increase in
PAL activity between 48 and 96 hpi. Considered
together, these results indicate a possible correlation
between H 2 O 2 content and PAL activity in roots of
resistant plants. Unlike resistant plants, the increase in
H2O2 content in susceptible plants did not result in an
increase in PAL activity until 48 hpi. Also, a delay
appeared to exist between the production of H2O2 and
the activation of the PAL genes in susceptible plants
compared to resistant plants. Contradictory findings
regarding the activation of the PAL genes by H2O2 have
been published showing that generation of H 2 O 2 did
not induce the expression of the PAL genes in bean cell
cultures [7], but 5 mM H2O2 induced the expression of
PAL genes in Arabidopsis cell cultures [54]. Our results
seem to support the involvement of H2O2 in the induction of the expression of the PAL genes in resistant
tomato plant roots, although this effect was less apparent in susceptible plants.
Using RT-PCR, we attempted to detect any changes in
gene expression to identify which PAL genes are responsible for the observed increases in enzymatic activity.
PAL is a multigenic system composed of a variable
number of highly homologous genes. We found
sequences corresponding to at least 6 different PAL
genes that differed in their noncoding 3’ ends in the SolGenes tomato EST database.
In our first approach, we were able to detect expression of all six PAL genes in tomato roots, cotyledons,
hypocotyls, epicotyls, leaves and flowers using RT-PCR,
although some differences in the levels of expression
were observed.
To assess whether the differences in PAL activity in
V. dahliae-challenged roots from resistant and

susceptible tomato lines were due to a coordinated
increase in the expression of the different PAL genes, or
whether there was differential regulation of these genes,
we assessed changes in expression of PAL genes in
inoculated roots using real-time RT-PCR. Because PAL1
and PAL5 amplification from root cDNA samples was
barely detectable after even 30 PCR cycles, we considered only the remaining PAL genes. This is somewhat
contradictory with a previous report in which the
expression of individual tomato PAL genes was analyzed
[30]; in that paper, most of the findings referred to
PAL1 and PAL5. In more recent works, a predominant
expression of PAL5 has been detected in tomato roots
and leaves using RT-PCR [55,56]. In our RT-PCR study,
PAL2 was the most abundant transcript, followed by
PAL3, PAL4 and PAL6.
Our results revealed differing patterns of expression of
the PAL genes following V. dahliae inoculation. Most of
the total increase in PAL expression in resistant roots in
the first 4 hours after inoculation was from increased
PAL2 transcription in the initial moments of the interaction. By 8 hpi, however, expression of PAL2 had
returned to its original level and PAL3 and PAL6
expression was increased in the roots of resistant plants.
PAL3 had increased expression at 48 hpi in roots of susceptible plants, coincident with the increase in PAL
activity in roots of inoculated susceptible plants. Without ruling out possible posttranscriptional changes,
most of the increase in PAL activity in roots of infected
susceptible plants seems to have come from the increase
in PAL3 expression.
PAL6 showed a dramatic increase in expression at 8
hpi, which together with the increase in PAL3 expression, could explain the maximum peak in PAL activity
observed at this time point in inoculated resistant roots.
This may indicate that PAL6 was the main gene responsible for the increase in PAL activity detected in roots of
resistant plants at 8 hours after V. dahliae inoculation.
Apart from the 4-fold change in PAL3 expression at
48 hpi, no clear changes in PAL expression were

Gayoso et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:232
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/232

detected in the compatible interaction. Interestingly, the
only clear change in PAL expression observed at 48 hpi
in the incompatible interaction corresponded to a different gene, PAL6, with a 6-fold increase compared to the
control. This change in expression might explain the
second minor increase in PAL activity found in roots of
resistant plants at 48 hpi and could indicate the establishment of a systemic response.
Any differences in function or substrate affinity among
the different PAL proteins in the tomato are not defined
at this time. Kinetic parameters of the Arabidopsis
thaliana.
PAL isoforms AtPAL1, 2 and 4 indicate that all three
followed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However,
AtPAL3 was estimated to have a catalytic efficacy 500to 1000-fold lower than that of the other PAL isoforms,
based on its higher KM and very low Kcat values [28].
We next decided to analyze the structural relationship
of tomato PAL genes with PAL genes from other plant
species, specifically to compare them with isoforms of
known biological functions and relevance from other
plants. To check for phylogenetic relationships among
the different PAL genes, 48 gene sequences located in
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) database and The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR) annotated database were aligned.
Because four of the tomato sequences came from partial
cDNAs, a total of 116 nucleotides corresponding to the
3’ end of the coding region were considered. Preliminary
analysis of the alignment of these sequences revealed
extensive homology, therefore this region was used for
phylogenetic reconstruction.
The resulting topology grouped PAL2 and PAL6
within cluster A, which includes most of the isoforms
and homologues from other woody dicotyledonous species. One of the genes in this cluster, PAL1 from Populus tremuloides, is found in non-lignified cells showing
accumulation of condensed tannins, while PAL2 from
the same species, also included in cluster A, appears in
lignification structures and conducting elements from
the xylem and the phloem; its expression decreases once
the lignification process is complete [57]. Osakabe [58]
measured levels of four PAL genes in Populus kitakamiensis stems developing secondary xylem, and found
the highest levels for the palg2b transcript, which is also
in cluster A.
Cluster B includes the other four tomato PAL genes
(PAL1, PAL3, PAL4 and PAL5) and sequences from
dicotyledonous plants including N. tabacum, D. carota,
S. tuberosum, C. chinense and I. batatas. IPBPAL from
I. batatas was induced after mechanical damage [59];
Tag 402 from N. tabacum was induced 4-fold 2 hours
after a methyl jasmonate treatment; AJ539006 from
N. tabacum is positively regulated by H 2 O 2 [60];

expression of D. carota DcPAL1 in a cell suspension
could be induced by a fungal elicitor, UV-B irradiation
or a dilution effect [25].
The clustering of genes from plants like T. pratense,
A. thaliana and the monocot species suggests that PAL
duplication and divergence has occurred independently
within some plant lineages. On the other hand, the presence of genes from tomato and tobacco in different
clusters seems to reflect ancient duplication of other
PAL genes and divergent evolution. Further sequencing
of additional PAL genes from these and other species
may enable more detailed elucidation of the phylogenetic history of the PAL gene family.
PAL2 and PAL6 genes were grouped with genes from
other species in which the process of lignification is very
active. At the same time, increases in PAL2 and PAL6
gene expression were only found in inoculated resistant
plants. PAL3, clustered with those genes from other species involved in the resistance to various stressors,
showed increased expression in both inoculated tomato
lines. The distribution of the tomato PAL genes in two
different clusters may reflect functional differences
among isoforms, with possible involvement of PAL6
and, very probably, PAL2 in lignification, and roles for
PAL1, PAL3, PAL4 and PAL5 in other biological
processes.
While some phenolic compounds occur constitutively
and serve as pathogen inhibitors in non-host resistance
[61,62], others are synthesized de novo in response to
fungal infection and act as part of an active defense
response [63]. In our study, the only detectable change
in total phenolic content after V. dahliae inoculation
was a small but statistically significant increase in total
phenolics in roots of inoculated resistant plants at 2 hpi.
To identify differences in the relative amounts of different phenolics, we analyzed the content of bound phenolics by HPLC. We saw a slight increase in ferulic acid
levels in roots of inoculated resistant plants at 2 hpi.
We also found differences in p-coumaric acid, vanillin
and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde contents at later post-infection times. These phenols are related to cell wall esterification, which enhances plant resistance against fungal
enzymes [35]. The most marked changes were observed
in the content of p-coumaric acid where we found
increased levels of this compound in roots of inoculated
resistant tomato plants between 16 and 96 hpi. This
increase coincided with maximum peroxidase activity in
resistant roots, and may be related to the decline seen
in the initial increase in H2O2 at these times points in
inoculated resistant plants. p-Coumaric acid has a very
important role in the maintenance of cell walls in plants.
It mediates the cross-linking of lignins to polysaccharides in cell walls of gramineous plants [64]. Vanillin
content increased from 96 hpi on, when peroxidase

activity was higher in inoculated resistant plants than in
control plants of both lines or in inoculated susceptible
plants. To summarize, V. dahliae infection had a clear
influence on phenolic metabolism in the tomato.
Lignification and reinforcement of cell walls are
important processes in the response of plants against
fungal infection [65-67]. A lignified cell wall is waterresistant and thus less accessible to fungal cell walldegrading enzymes [68]. Smit and Dubery [69] observed
an increase in synthesis and deposition of lignins and
similar polymers after exposure of cotton hypocotyls to
an elicitor of V. dahliae. The active lignification phase
was preceded by increased activity of PAL, cinnamyl
alcohol dehydrogenase and cell-bound peroxidases. They
also found that the response of a resistant cultivar was
faster and more intense than that of a susceptible one.
Pomar et al. [43] found that inoculation of pepper varieties differing in their degree of resistance against V.
dahliae triggered a significant increase in the amount of
lignin. In our study, inoculation with V. dahliae induced
a significant increase in the total amount of lignin in
tomato roots in both the susceptible line LA3030 and in
the resistant line LA3038, although at earlier times in
the latter.
Differences in monolignol composition between the
lignin of healthy plants and resistant-related lignin in
infected plants have been described in several studies of
interaction with a variety of pathogens [66,70]. It has
also been observed that the monomeric composition
and degree of crossing-over in lignins from inoculated
pepper plants were closely related to the maintenance of
the integrity of the photosynthetic system and thus with
tolerance to the presence of the pathogen [43]. From
nitrobenzene oxidation, we found that at 16 dpi there
was an increase in the proportion of G groups compared to S groups. In addition, at 28 dpi, both cultivars
showed an increased proportion of H groups. Presumably, this increase was due to the incorporation of
p-coumaryl alcohol in the condensed nucleus. However,
the possibility that some of the benzaldehyde units
quantified by nitrobenzene oxidation could come from
hydroxycinnamic acids bound to cell walls, because they
share the aromatic skeleton with monolignols, cannot be
ruled out.
The ratio between guaiacyl and syringyl moieties has
an important influence on the type and frequency of lignin interunit linkages and, consequently, on lignin structure [71]. In our thioacidolysis analyses of tomato
lignins, there were remarkable changes in both resistant
and susceptible roots. At 16 dpi there was an increase
in the G/S ratio in all inoculated plants, consequent to
the reduction of S units. This kind of lignification could
be analogous to that found in primary walls, where polymerization is rapid and rich in b-5, b-1, b-b, 5-5 y 5-O-

Page 14 of 19

4 bonds. These young lignins are rich in hydroxyphenyl
(H) and guaiacyl (G) groups and poor in syringyl (S)
groups. At 28 dpi, the differences between control and
inoculated plants disappeared, as a result of a large
incorporation of S groups, characteristic of slow polymerization. The chemistry of sinapyl alcohol radicals
predicts that their only coupling modes are b-b and
b-O-4, because the possible resonance structures are
R O4 and R b [72]. The b-b mode is less favored than
b-O-4 at low concentrations, therefore most sinapyl
alcohol sources used in lignin biosynthesis are incorporated in polymers rich in b-O-4 bonds. Thus, the higher
incorporation of syringyl groups observed at 28 dpi in
inoculated plants should be accompanied by a higher
number of b-O-4 bonds and, consequently, by a higher
proportion of the linear fraction of lignins.
Another change observed after V. dahliae inoculation
was the increase in O-4 terminal units of DHCA, p-coumaric acid, coniferyl alcohol, vanillin and ferulic acid.
The increases were greater in the resistant line and were
quantitatively highest for ferulic acid. The O-4 terminal
unit can act as nucleation points for the growth of lignins after coupling of with a monolignol radical in position b [73]. There was also a remarkable increase in
aldehyde groups in inoculated plants, especially in b-O-4
coniferyl aldehyde in the resistant line at 28 dpi. The
increase observed in the quantity of aldehyde groups in
inoculated cell walls was confirmed by FT-IR analysis.
The presence of carbonyl groups could have an inhibitory effect on fungal enzymes, because these groups can
react with the amino groups of enzymes, inactivating
them. In addition, these aldehydes confer a hydrophobic
character to lignins, protecting them against the action
of cellulolytic enzymes [74].
In summary, our analysis of lignins indicates that
there was an increase in lignin synthesis following
inoculation with V. dahliae. This increase was greater
and faster in the resistant line, where two phases were
detected. Initially, there was an accumulation of lignins
with a high degree of crossing-over, apparently rich in
G and H groups, particularly in its condensed nucleus.
This increase is accompanied by deposition of phenolic
units that possibly act as initiation points that would
allow the growth of highly polymerized linear lignins
rich in S units in the slower second phase.

Conclusions
Ve-mediated resistance again Verticillium spp. is a complex process that triggers molecular responses at several
levels, including H2O2 accumulation, increased peroxidase activity, differential production of phenylpropanoids, specific regulation of PAL genes and differential
deposition of lignins. These events are most likely the
result of the coordinated activation of different defensive

responses, resulting in the production of ROS, the
induction of expression of defense genes, the production
of antimicrobial compounds and the reinforcement of
cell walls. The comparison of sequences from PAL
genes also seems to reveal the involvement of different
PAL isoforms in different biological processes. The generation of specific tomato PAL mutants, or the identification by TILLING screening of tomato plants with
defective PAL alleles, together with an analysis of their
resistance against pathogens, their relative phenylpropanoid content and the structure of their cell walls, may
elucidate the actual function of the various PAL isoforms in lignification or other cellular mechanisms.

Methods
Plant material

Seeds from the near-isogenic tomato (S. lycopersicum cv
Gardener) lines LA3030 and LA3038 were provided by the
C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center (UC Davis,
CA, USA). LA3038 carries the Ve gene conferring resistance against Verticillium spp. and the I gene for resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The seeds
were surface-sterilized by immersion in 10% bleach for 30
minutes and thoroughly rinsed before sowing in sterile
perlite. One-week-old plantlets were transplanted into
individual pots, placed on heating mats and kept in the
greenhouse through September and October with a 16:8 h
photoperiod at 342 μmol m-2s-1 at temperatures ranging
from 18 to 25°C. The plants were supplemented once a
week with a water soluble fertilizer (N-P-K: 15-2.2-9 ).
Fungal material

The virulent V. dahliae Kleb. isolate VD53 was used [75].
To ensure virulence, the pathogen was freshly isolated
from infected plants before each inoculation. After isolation it was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates.
Fungal inoculation

Four-week-old plants were inoculated with inoculum
prepared from the V. dahliae cultures grown on PDA
plates. After 25 days of culture at 25°C in the dark, 5 ml
of sterile distilled water was added to each plate and the
mycelia were brushed away with a rubber spatula. The
suspension was filtered through a double layer of cheesecloth. The conidia were counted in a Thoma chamber
and the concentration adjusted to 107 conidia ml-1. One
ml of the suspension was directly pipetted onto the soil
surface of each pot. Plants in the control group received
1 ml of sterile water. After inoculation, all plants were
kept in the greenhouse conditions described above.
Measurement of H2O2

Root samples were homogenized in extraction buffer
(Tris-acetate 50 mM, pH 5.0) using a mortar and pestle.

Page 15 of 19

The mixture was filtered through a double layer of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 minutes at
4°C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean tube
and the pellet was discarded.
H 2 O 2 was quantified in the roots of control and
inoculated LA3030 and LA3038 plants using the xylenol
orange method [76] that is based on the oxidation of
Fe2+ ions by peroxide, followed by colorimetric detection of the reaction of Fe3+ with the sodium salt of xylenol orange. Five hundred μl of the reaction mixture
(500 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate, 50 mM H2SO4, 200
μM xylenol orange and 200 mM sorbitol) was added to
500 μl of root crude extract. After 45 minutes, absorbance by the Fe 3+ -xylenol orange complex was measured at 560 nm. Data were normalized with reference
to fresh weight and are presented as H2O2 concentrations (μM).
Measurement of peroxidase activity

Sample extraction was performed as described above.
Peroxidase activity was determined at 25°C in 50 mM
Tris-acetate at pH 5.0 and 0.5 mM H2O2, supplemented
with 1 mM 4-methoxy-a-naphthol as the electron
donor [43].
Measurement of phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity

Total PAL enzyme was extracted by the method of El
Ghaouth et al. [77]. The root samples were homogenized at 4°C in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0; the
lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 minutes
and the supernatant was collected. PAL activity was
measured in this fraction using the method of Beaudoin-Eagan and Thorpe [78]. The extract was incubated
for 2 h at 37°C in 10 mM L-phenylalanine, 0.5 M TrisHCl, pH 8.0. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 M
HCl. The mixture was centrifuged and the amount of
trans-cinnamic acid formed in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 290 nm. PAL activity
was expressed as μg of cinnamic acid formed per μg of
protein.
To confirm PAL activity, an inhibition assay using different amounts of the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic
acid, trans-cinnamic acid, coumaric acid and caffeic acid
was performed. Total inhibition of commercial PAL
(Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid) was found at concentrations of
10-10 μg μl-1.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Samples from roots, hypocotyls, epicotyls, cotyledons,
leaves and flowers were taken from 6-week-old LA3030
and LA3038 plants. Samples from LA3030 and LA3038
roots were harvested at different times after fungal
induction and stored at -80°C for further use. Total
RNA was extracted from frozen samples using the

Aurum™ Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad, Barcelona) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity
was measured spectrophotometrically and its integrity
was confirmed using 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel
electrophoresis [79]. First-strand cDNA was synthesized
from 100 ng of total RNA using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad), following the protocol supplied
by the manufacturer.
Primer design, PCR and real-time PCR

Sequences for the different tomato PAL genes were
retrieved from the databases of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/ (PAL1 and PAL5) and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) http://www.tigr.org/tdb/agi/
(PAL2, PAL3, PAL4 and PAL6). Specific primers were
designed using the program Primer-3 [80]; primer
sequences are detailed in Table 7. The amplification
conditions of the different PAL genes were optimized.
The thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 30
cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 25 s, 72°C for 50 s, and
a final step at 72°C for 5 minutes. The respective PCR
products were sequenced and corresponded to the
expected amplicons. PCR products were separated on
1% agarose gels and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide.
Real-time RT-PCR was performed in 50 μl of a reaction mixture composed of 2.5 μl cDNA, 1X iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 0.3 μM of each gene-

specific primer, using an iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad)
and the same thermal cycling conditions described
above. The Optical System Software 3.0 (Bio-Rad) was
used to analyze the results. RT-PCR specificity was confirmed by identification of a single peak in the melting
curve analysis.
The b-tubulin gene was used as a constitutively
expressed endogenous control. To determine the amplification efficiencies for the PAL and tubulin genes, we
used five-fold serial dilutions of cDNA. Efficiencies
greater than 95% were obtained in all cases. For quantification, an efficiency-corrected Ct model was used [81].
For the direct comparison of levels of expression among
PAL genes in roots, the expression of each gene was
related to that of the gene with the lowest Ct (PAL2).
Each test was repeated twice and each measurement
was performed in duplicate.
Phylogenetic analyses

All sequences representing PAL genes from different
organisms were extracted from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) annotated databases. We
included 48 nucleotide sequences, restricted to a homologous region of 116 nucleotides from the 3’ end of the
coding region.
Multiple alignments of the nucleotide sequences were
conducted using the BioEdit [82] and ClustalX [83] programs with default parameters as specified by each program. The trees were produced using maximum

parsimony with the MEGA program, version 3.1 [84].
Reliability of the resulting topologies was tested by bootstrap (1,000 replicates) for each interior branch of the
trees.
Analysis of phenolic compounds

Root samples were lyophilized and ground in liquid
nitrogen, after which 100-300 mg was homogenized in
70% methanol and incubated for 30 minutes at 80°C.
After cooling to room temperature, water was added to
a volume of 2 ml and samples were centrifuged at
1,300 g for 5 minutes. The pellet was then resuspended
in 2 ml 70% methanol and centrifuged again using the
same conditions. The supernatants from both extractions were combined and extracted twice with ethyl
acetate after methanol evaporation under vacuum. The
resulting supernatants were evaporated and resuspended
in 1 ml methanol. This supernatant was retained as the
soluble phenols fraction.
Two ml of 4 N NaOH was added to the pellet from
the soluble phenols extraction, saturated with nitrogen,
and incubated at 170°C for 2 hours. After cooling, 2 ml
H2O and 1 ml 35% HCl were added. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,200 g and the
supernatant was retained. Phenolic compounds were
extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate, then anhydrous
sodium sulfate was added and the samples were evaporated to dryness in a Rotavapor R-205 (Buchi, Postfach,
Switzerland) and resuspended in 1 ml methanol; this
fraction contained linked phenols.
The quantitative determination of free and linked phenolics was accomplished using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
[85], with ferulic acid as the standard. The sum of both
fractions was considered to be the total phenols content.
For identification and quantification of individual
compounds, the linked phenol samples were analyzed
using reverse-phase HPLC on an Alliance system
(Waters, Barcelona) equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode detector. The reverse-phase employed a Spherisorb ODS2 C18 analytical column (Waters) with a
Spherisorb ODS2 C18 precolumn. Ten μl of each sample was injected and run at a flow of 1 ml min-1 at 25°
C. Compounds were detected between 225 and 400 nm,
and quantification was performed at 290 nm, using the
corresponding standards.
Cell wall isolation and lignin analysis

Cell walls were prepared using a Triton X-100 washing
procedure that included as the last steps three washes
with ethanol and three washes with diethyl ether [86].
Lignin quantification was performed using acetyl bromide [87]. Alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation of lignifying
cell walls and HPLC analyses were performed essentially
as described in Pomar et al. [88]. Quantification of

Page 17 of 19

p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and syringaldehyde was
accomplished at 280 nm, using the corresponding standards. Thioacidolysis, which solubilizes the b-O-4 lignin
core, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses were performed using the Thermo Finnigan Trace GC gas chromatograph, Thermo Finnigan
Polaris Q mass spectrometer and DB-XLB, J&W (60 m
× 0.25 mm I.D.) column [86]. Mass spectra were
recorded at 70 eV. Quantification of chromatographic
peaks utilized total ionic current (TIC) chromatograms.
Fourier transform infrared spectra of finely ground cell
wall samples were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker Optics Madrid Spain).
Statistics

All experiments and measurements were performed in
triplicate. The Student t-test was used for two-group
comparisons and ANOVA followed by an unpaired Student t-test with Bonferroni’s correction was used for
multiple group comparisons. The differences were considered significant when P-value was < 0.05
