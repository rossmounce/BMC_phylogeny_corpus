<p>The of Alu repeats in elements near
The role abundance of Alutranscription broadly expressed genes is best explained by their preferential preservation near housekeeping

Abstract
Background: Of all repetitive elements in the human genome, Alus are unusual in being enriched
near to genes that are expressed across a broad range of tissues. This has led to the proposal that
Alus might be modifying the expression breadth of neighboring genes, possibly by providing CpG
islands, modifying transcription factor binding, or altering chromatin structure. Here we consider
whether Alus have increased expression breadth of genes in their vicinity.
Results: Contrary to the modification hypothesis, we find that those genes that have always had
broad expression are richest in Alus, whereas those that are more likely to have become more
broadly expressed have lower enrichment. This finding is consistent with a model in which Alus
accumulate near broadly expressed genes but do not affect their expression breadth. Furthermore,
this model is consistent with the finding that expression breadth of mouse genes predicts Alu
density near their human orthologs. However, Alus were found to be related to some alternative
measures of transcription profile divergence, although evidence is contradictory as to whether Alus
associate with lowly or highly diverged genes. If Alu have any effect it is not by provision of CpG
islands, because they are especially rare near to transcriptional start sites. Previously reported Alu
enrichment for genes serving certain cellular functions, suggested to be evidence of functional
importance of Alus, appears to be partly a byproduct of the association with broadly expressed
genes.
Conclusion: The abundance of Alu near broadly expressed genes is better explained by their
preferential preservation near to housekeeping genes rather than by a modifying effect on
expression of genes.

Background

Repetitive elements constitute 45% of the human genome [1].
With more than 1 million copies (about 10% of the human
genome), Alu sequences are the most prevalent repetitive elements [2]. Alus began to spread at the base of the primate lineage about 65 million years ago [3] and inserted at high rates
until about 30 million years ago, after which Alu insertion

rate was markedly reduced. This translates to 85% of Alus
being common to all monkeys [4]. Because they are primate
specific, Alus have been proposed to be major players in shaping the primate genome and transcriptome. However, little is
known about the impact they have on genome structure and
function. Although they are considered genetic 'junk' by some
authors [5], others have proposed that they are functionally

important [1,6-8]. In a few instances they have been found to
have inserted into coding regions of genes, becoming part of
the protein coding message [9,10]. Similarly, newly inserted
Alu elements may trigger genomic responses such as recombination/replication slippage and CpG methylation, which
can lead to gene duplications/deletions and help to produce
new alternative splicing isoforms [11,12]. In addition, phylogenetic studies have identified a relation between lineage
divergence and increased rates of transposition in primates,
prompting the possibility that Alu expansions play a role in
speciation [8].

sues [28,29]. Importantly, Alu sequences are unusually rich
in CpG dinucleotides [33,34], suggesting the possibility that
Alu sequences contribute to increases in the breadth of
expression of genes through introducing CpG islands. Alternatively, localized GC content in the vicinity of genes may
make chromatin opening easier and hence aid transcription.
Alu insertion may thus modify local GC content. This is akin
to Vinogradov's idea of a 'gene nest' [35]. Finally, known regulatory sequences that respond to hormones, calcium, and
transcription factors have been found in consensus Alu
sequences and have been shown to regulate transcription in
some genes (for review [7]). A final possibility, for which we
know of no evidence, is that Alu insertion might disrupt a tissue-specific promoter element, causing the gene to be more
broadly expressed. With the exception of this latter possibility, all of the other models propose a gain of function concomitant with Alu insertion that would be specific to Alu (any
repetitive element could in principle disrupt a tissue-specific
promoter). In this regard, all three models have the potential
to explain why Alu in particular among the repetitive elements are unusual in being enriched near to housekeeping
genes.

At a genomic level, Alu sequences are not randomly distributed along the genome and are found in higher densities in
gene rich regions [13]. Alu sequences are more common in
GC-rich genomic domains, which are also the most gene
dense sections of the genome [1,2,14]. Almost three-quarters
of genes have Alu sequences in their flanking regions [2],
placing these repeats in stretches of sequence potentially relevant to gene regulation. Indeed, in our sample we find that
Alus are enriched near to genes occupying 18.5% of the
sequence (in the 20 kilobase [kb] flanking region of genes), as
compared with 12.8% of intronic sequence and just 9.6% of
intergenic regions [7]. Perhaps more startling is the observation that Alu sequences are more common in flanking regions
of highly expressed and housekeeping genes than in lowly
expressed and tissue-specific ones [15-17]. This difference
persists even when one takes into account the isochore type in
which the genes are residing, suggesting that the Alu enrichment around housekeeping genes is not a byproduct of differences in Alu insertion rates among different genomic
compartments [17]. The enrichment is found for both newer
and older Alus, although it is more pronounced for the older
ones [17]. Likewise, analyses of genes located on chromosomes 21 and 22 revelaed Alu sequences to be unequally distributed within genes serving different cellular functions [18].
What accounts for Alu enrichment near to housekeeping
genes? Two broad classes of model can be considered. In the
first, Alu sequence enrichment causes an increase in expression breadth, which here we term the 'expression modifier'
model. Alternatively, Alu enrichment of housekeeping genes
could be the result of a process that is unrelated to the modification of expression profiles, which we term the 'marker
model'. This marker model may be neutralist or selectionist.
In support of the first possibility, Alu involvement in regulation has been demonstrated for a handful of genes through
experimental approaches [6,19-26]. Moreover, several viable
mechanisms have been proposed by which Alu might influence gene regulation, causing them to be more broadly
expressed. CpG islands are stretches of DNA with a greater
than average frequency of CpG dinucleotides [27,28], and
they have been found on promoter regions or first introns of
over half of human genes [29-32]. CpG islands are more common in the upstream region of genes expressed in many tis-

Taken together, the findings mentioned above are then consistent with the possibility that Alu sequences are not just a
major player in the evolution of the primate genome but also
an important factor in shaping gene regulation during primate evolution [6,7,12,36,37]. As for the 'marker model', this
would require that some insertion/expansion/conservation
bias not causally related to gene regulation is taking place and
accounts for the unequal distribution of Alus near to genes
with varying expression profiles. Eller and coworkers [17]
have suggested the neutral possibility of Alu sequences accumulating around housekeeping genes because of the deleterious effects of excision by recombination of neighboring Alu
sequences. There is also a selectionist alternative that is consistent with the marker model. According to experimental
findings, increased short interspersed nuclear element
(SINE; the repeat family that includes Alus) transcription is
observed under particular stress conditions [38-41], coinciding with expression of heat shock proteins [41-43] and leading to speculation that they could be playing a role in cell
stress recovery, although it is not clear what this role might
be. In any case, under the marker model Alus would accumulate near to highly expressed and/or housekeeping genes, but
they do not modify their expression breadth.
Here we attempt to distinguish the expression modifier and
marker models. Using three separate transcriptome data
(microarray [44], Serial Analysis of Gene Expression [SAGE]
[45], and Bodymap [46]), we first investigate the relationship
between Alu content in flanking regions and gene activity at a
genomic scale. In particular, as housekeeping genes tend also
to be highly expressed (they are expressed at a high rate in
many tissues) and to be enriched in GC-rich domains, we consider whether the enrichment near to housekeeping genes is

actually better explained as enrichment near to highly
expressed genes or simply as enrichment in GC-rich domains.
We find that the enrichment is best explained as being in the
vicinity of housekeeping genes. Is it the case, then, that Alu
are responsible for an increase in breadth of expression of
genes in their vicinity? To distinguish between the models we
also consider whether any enrichment is more profound 5'
than 3' and whether the Alus are especially prevalent in the
more immediate vicinity of genes (for instance, near to the
transcription start sites, as predicted by the CpG island
model). We then investigate whether Alu repeat insertions
have played a relevant role in the evolution of increased gene
expression breadth using a comparative genomics/transcriptomics to examine two independent expression datasets:
microarray [44] and Bodymap [46]. The role of Alus in other
forms of expression divergence is also examined.

explaining 0.1% of the variance is still observed with downstream Alu content).

Results
Alu content is enriched near broadly expressed genes
not highly expressed genes
We start by establishing that the important pattern, namely
that the association between Alu presence and expression
parameters, is real and not explained by correlation with
some other variable. To this end, using three separate sources
for expression profiles (see Materials and methods, below),
we ranked all genes according to two indices of gene activity:
breadth (number of tissues in which a gene is expressed) and
peak expression (highest expression in any tissue). Considering the top 20% (those more highly/broadly expressed), the
bottom 20% (those more lowly/narrowly expressed), and the
middle 20%, we found that broadly expressed genes exhibit
an average 10% increase in Alu content on their flanking
regions compared with genes with a narrower tissue distribution. Although several authors have reported a relation
between Alu content and expression profiles, none has
attempted to quantify the variance in expression data that is
being explained. To assess the actual predictive power of Alu
content on expression profiles, we conducted a regression
analysis on the 4 kb section that exhibits the greater differences among groups (2 to 6 kb from start/end of transcription). For breadth of expression, the correlation with Alu
content explains at most 5% of the variance (microarray/
SAGE/bodymap data [n = 15,147/13,622/10,281]; upstream:
r = 0.160/0.225/0.191 [P < 0.001 for each]; downstream: r =
0.107/0.156/0.096 [P < 0.001 for each]). The quantitative
measure of expression (peak expression) has a weaker relation with Alus (microarray/SAGE/Bodymap data [n = 13,134/
13,622/10,281]; upstream: r = 0.041/0.079/NS [P < 0.001
for microarray and SAGE, NS for Bodymap]; downstream: r
= 0.050/0.081/NS [P < 0.001 for microarray and SAGE, NS
for Bodymap]; Figure 1 and Additional data file 1). The relation between Alu content and the quantitative measure of
expression is no longer significant when peak is corrected by
breadth of expression while the opposite does not occur
(except for SAGE data, for which a significant correlation

Alu content enrichment near broadly expressed genes
is not a side consequence of co-variation with GC
content
The above findings suggest that the link between expression
and Alu content in flanking regions is mostly due to a primary
correlation between Alu and expression breadth. This is
potentially consistent with a model in which Alus are indeed
involved in gene regulation. However, the relationship with
expression breadth might simply be a byproduct of other,
independent interactions of sequence parameters with gene
activity and Alu density. GC content is thought to be related to
gene activity [47-53] (but see [54,55]) and with density of Alu
sequences [1,14]. Therefore, it is possible that both broadly
expressed genes and Alu repeats concentrate in regions of
high GC content. To investigate this possibility, we corrected
Alu content in flanking regions for the relationship with GC
content and then we reassessed the relationship with expression breadth (see Materials and methods, below). We found
that, after correcting for the relationship of intergenic GC
with Alu content, Alu content remained significantly higher
among broadly expressed genes than among lowly expressed
genes in both upstream (microarray/SAGE/Bodymap data [n
= 15,147/13,622/10,281]; r = 0.163/0.200/0.205 [P < 0.001
for each]) and downstream (microarray/SAGE/Bodymap
data [n = 15,147/13,622/10,281]; r = 0.123/0.141/0.090 [P <
0.001 for each]) regions. Hence, the effects are not explained
by co-variation with GC content.

Alu content is enriched both 3' and 5' of broadly
expressed genes
The several ways in which Alus could be affecting expression
breadth predict different patterns of Alu enrichment 5' and 3'
of housekeeping genes. First, if Alus are providing CpG
islands that are relevant to gene transcription, then we expect
Alus to be enriched near to the transcription start site (TSS)
and to exhibit no tendency to accumulate 3' of housekeeping
genes. Likewise, if Alu are providing novel transcription factor binding sites or other regulatory elements (or disrupting
tissue-specific control elements), then they should be abundant 5' but not 3'. By contrast, if Alus are affecting overall GC
content, and as such altering chromatin structure to render
housekeeping genes more accessible for transcription, then
both 5' and 3' enrichment is expected and we need not predict
enrichment near to the TSS.
Under the marker model predictions are not so clear. In the
simplest case, in which insertion is simply into open chromatin near to transcriptionally active genes, we might expect
enrichment 5' and 3'. However, close analysis of several
classes of retroelement and transposon reveals that insertion
is biased to the 5' end (for instance, see [56-59]). Hence, this
model could be consistent with many possibilities and is
hence hard to falsify with this test, without better knowledge

of the insertion biases of Alu and subsequent biases in their
evolution. However, enrichment 3' more than 5' is not obviously predicted by this or any model. Note, though, that a
simple insertion bias model is probably not adequate on its
own, because enrichment of Alu sequences in GC-rich
stretches of the genome is probably not the result of insertion
bias, as Alus insert preferentially on AT-rich regions [1,60,61]
(but see [62]).
In Figure 2 we can observe that the difference in Alu content
between broadly expressed and more tissue-specific genes is
greater for the 5' flanking region than the 3'; however, the difference is significant for both flanks. There is hence both a
regional effect and a 5'-specific effect. To remove any regional
effect we corrected Alu content on each flanking region for the
Alu content on the opposite flanking region (see Materials
and methods, below) and repeated the comparison of Alu

content among the gene groups of different expression
breadths and level. Results from regression analyses on the
whole sample show that the difference in Alu content for
broadly and more tissue-specific genes is largely unchanged
for the upstream (5') region (microarray/SAGE/Bodymap [n
= 15,147/13,622/10,281]; r = 0.128/0.164/0.165 [P < 0.001
for each]), whereas the difference in Alu content for the
downstream (3') flanking region is diminished but the relation does not disappear completely for two of the three datasets tested (microarray/SAGE/Bodymap [n = 15,147/13,622/
10,281]; r = 0.47/0.049/NS [P < 0.001 for microarray and
SAGE, and NS for Bodymap]). We therefore conclude that the
relation between breadth and Alu content is higher for the 5'
region, but there is also a regional component. The regional
effect would argue against the 5' promoter and CpG island
models. The 5' enrichment controlling for any regional effect
is contrary to the chromatin model. A mixed model cannot be

excluded. However, given some not inconsiderable uncertainty in gene annotation and the possibility that the 3' end of
one gene may be the 5' end of another, definitive conclusions
are hard to draw from these findings.
However, what does seem clear is that the Alus are specifically
avoided in the vicinity of the TSS. In addition, Alus, although
CpG rich, appear not to share the qualities of CpG islands that
are found on proximal promoters of genes [32,63]. Notably,
unlike CpG islands in the near proximity of genes, Alu CpG
repeats appear to be ubiquitously methylated [64]. For these
reasons, we reject the modification of CpG islands model. The
marker model may be consistent with the patterns, especially
because a 5' insertional bias has been described for some retroelements [56]. If we assume that Alu insertion is possible
near TSSs, then their dearth near to TSSs implies purifying
selection against such insertions, probably because they disrupt expression.

Alus accumulate near to housekeeping genes but they
do not alter expression breadth
To investigate whether increased Alu content near broadly
expressed genes is due to the boosting effect on expression
breadth of Alu insertions, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis. Because the majority of Alu sequences are
common to all primates, it is adequate to address this issue
using a nonprimate species to compare gene activity. By using
a nonprimate species (which therefore would not have Alu in
its genome), we also eliminate the errors derived from the
mis-identification of lineage-specific Alu insertions that
would occur with use of primate species. The mouse transcriptome, after that of human, is the best characterized. We
therefore calculated the difference in breadth of expression
between pairs of human and mouse orthologs and compared
these differences with Alu content of flanking regions. Do
then Alu-rich genes have greater breadth than their mouse
orthologs? The results here are contradictory but suggest at
the most that Alus explain only a tenth of 1% of the variance
(microarray/Bodymap data [n = 11,275/8,179]; upstream: r =
0.005/0.039 [P NS for microarray and P < 0.001 for

Bodymap]; downstream: r = 0.003/0.031 [P NS for microarray and P = 0.005 for Bodymap]; Figure 3 and Additional
data file 2). These data hence provide no strong support for
the hypothesis that Alu accumulation explains much of the
increase in expression breadth.
This finding is suggestive of a scenario in which Alus insert or
accumulate near to genes that already have high breadth of
expression. Because Alu is human specific, we could provide
direct support for this model by showing that expression of
nonprimate genes predicts Alu content of human orthologs.
In support of this alternative position, we find that breadth of
expression in the mouse genome well predicts Alu content of
the orthologs in the human genome (in mouse, microarray/
Bodymap data [n = 11,275/8,179]; upstream: r = 0.142/0.218
[P < 0.001 for both]; downstream: r = 0.093/0.115 [P < 0.001
for both]). This indicates that genes that have always been
broadly expressed are those that are enriched for Alu rather
than those that have had their expression breadth increased.
Note also the strength of this effect. The upstream correlation
we observe with bodymap data is unusually strong. Given that
this cannot be due to causative effects of Alu, this provides
strong support for the marker model.
To further test whether this is indeed the case, we took all
human housekeeping genes in our sample and then partitioned them into groups according to the expression pattern
of their orthologous genes in mouse. We then compared the
Alu content of housekeeping genes in human that were also
housekeeping genes in mouse (n = 841) against those genes
that were housekeeping genes in human but tissue-specific in
mouse (n = 128). In the first group, the most parsimonious

assumption is that the gene was a housekeeping gene before
the two lineages split. In the second group, the gene either
lost its broad expression in the mouse lineage or became
expressed in more tissues in the human lineage; we can
assume that about half of all cases fall into each category.
Therefore, for the first group human genes would for the most
part have been broadly expressed during the evolution of the
primate lineage. In the second group, however, some proportion of genes would initially have been tissue specific and
gained their housekeeping status later in the evolution of the
primate lineage. If Alus are merely accumulating in flanking
regions of housekeeping genes, then we would expect them to
be more prevalent in the first group than in the second,
because in the second at least some proportion of the genes
would initially have had a narrower tissue expression, giving
less time for the accumulation of Alu sequences. The expression modification by Alu hypothesis predicts the opposite
result.
Results of this analysis show that those genes that are housekeeping in both species indeed have a higher Alu content on
both flanks, although this is only significant for the 5' region
after Bonferroni correction (Student's t-test; upstream: P =
0.00278; downstream: P = 0.23845; Figure 4). Similarly, if
the same test is applied to human tissue-specific genes, then
those genes that are also tissue specific in mouse have significantly lower Alu content in their flanking regions than those
genes that are broadly expressed in mouse (Student's t-test;
upstream: P = 0.01231; downstream: P = 0.27760; Figure 4).
A similar analysis was conducted for bodymap data, yielding
similar results (see Materials and methods, below).

housekeeping genes (expressed in 30 or 31 tissues of 31 in total) and tissue-specific genes (expressed in 1 or 2 tissues from 31 in total) was divided into
two groups according to whether their mouse ortholog was a housekeeping or tissue-specific gene (if expressed in 30 to 31 or 1 to 2 tissues, respectively).
The left panel shows human housekeeping genes for which the mouse counterparts are also housekeeping (orange columns) or tissue-specific instead (red
columns). The right panel shows Alu content in tissue-specific human genes for which the mouse counterparts are also tissue specific or housekeeping
instead. Stars represent significant differences in between the two groups with a P < 0.05 (*) and 0.01 (**) on a Students T-test.

Based on these findings, we conclude that increased Alu
sequences in flanking regions of housekeeping genes does not
reflect modification of expression breadth by Alus. Instead,
Alus accumulate in the vicinity of genes that already have
greater breadth of expression, as expected under the marker
model.

Alu content is marginally related to estimates of
transcription divergence
Having found that Alu enrichment around housekeeping
genes does not appear to be the result of Alu-induced
increased breadth of expression, we examined whether Alu
insertions could be related to other measures of expression
profile divergence between human-mouse ortholog gene
pairs. For example, Alu insertions may induce changes not in
the overall number of tissues where a gene is expressed but in
the specific tissues where a gene is expressed. Alu insertions
could also result in changes in expression intensity. These
changes would not be picked up by comparing total number
of tissues in which a gene is expressed. If Alus have
contributed to expression evolution in primates, then we
would expect that those genes with the highest Alu content
would have diverged the most in terms of their gene activity.
We first turned our attention to changes in the tissue distribution of gene expression by calculating the number of switches

from expressed to nonexpressed between the two species for
each tissue. We find weak and contradictory evidence; array
data suggest no effect and bodymap data suggest a very weak

= 0.005 for Bodymap, but NS after Bonferroni correction];
Figure 5 and Additional data file 2).
We then looked at expression intensity, because it could still
be the case that Alus sometimes cause expression increases/
decreases while not changing the tissue in which a gene is
expressed. We assessed changes in peak expression across all
tissues and divergence by quantifying the differences in
expression intensity in each tissue for each pair of orthologous genes. To compare peak expression between orthologous pairs, we used ranked peak expression, which allows
comparison of data for human and mouse genes and
smoothes out noise. (Note that this potentially misses subtle
quantitative effects.). We find evidence for a weak relation
with Alu content under one of the two expression data
platforms (microarray [n = 11,275]; upstream: r = 0.038 [P <
0.001]; downstream: r = 0.024 [P = 0.02; not significant after
Bonferroni correction]; for Bodymap data the relation was
not significant; Figure 5 and Additional data file 2).

Alu content and expression divergence between human and mouse orthologous genes
Alu content and expression divergence between human and mouse orthologous genes. (a) Number of switches from expressed to non-expressed; (b)
ranked peak of expression difference; (c) expression intensity divergence estimated by using correlation coefficients as measure of distance; and (d)
expression intensity divergence estimated by using Euclidean distances.

As for divergence in expression intensity profiles, we obtained
two different measures to quantify the changes in expression
intensity per tissue (correlation coefficients and Euclidean
distances). These two measures examine whether Alus could
be causing more subtle changes in expression intensity other
than increased/decreased overall peak expression. We again
find that Alu content is related to quantitative divergence for
both the microarray dataset (correlation coefficients/Euclidean distances [n = 11,275]; upstream: r = -0.066/-0.096 [P
< 0.001]; downstream: r = -0.033/-0.054 [P < 0.001]; Figure
5) and the Bodymap dataset (correlation coefficients/Euclidean distances [n = 8,179]; upstream: r = -0.057/-0.119 [P <
0.001 for both]; downstream: r = -0.026/-0.067 [P = 0.017
for correlation coefficient (not significant after Bonferroni
correction) and P < 0.001 for Euclidean distance]; see Additional data file 2).
To examine whether these correlations could be explained by
a shift in regional base composition, we examined whether
the observed link between quantitative expression divergence
and Alu persists after correcting for shifts in regional GC content between human and mouse. We find that this is not the
case; the relation between Alu content and quantitative estimates of gene expression divergence remains significant after
taking into account regional shifts in GC between the two species (correlation coefficients/Euclidean distances, microarray
[n = 11,275]; upstream: r = -0.065/-0.089 [P < 0.001]; downstream: r = -0.036/-0.049 [P < 0.001]; Bodymap [n = 8,179];
upstream: r = -0.060/-0.116 [P < 0.001]; downstream: r =
NS/-0.066 [P NS for correlation coefficient and P < 0.001 for
Euclidean distance]).
In sum, both Bodymap and array data agree that Alu density
correlates weakly with expression divergence. That the two
datasets agree suggests that the correlations are not an artefact of expression platform. What is unclear is what it means.
Most noteworthy in this context is the discrepancy in the
direction of the relation with Alus between the two divergence
measurements used. Higher Alu content is associated with
lower r values and lower Euclidean distances. However,
although low r values imply more divergence, lower Euclidean distances imply less divergence. So, are Alu associated
with high or low divergence? Liao and Zhang [65] suggest that
correlation coefficients as a measure of divergence would
miss any linear changes in expression profiles, which might
explain the rather weak relation with Alu content. If so, then
we are then left to conclude that those genes with higher Alu
content have diverged less from their mouse counterparts.
This would be expected if Alu accumulate near to housekeeping genes and housekeeping genes have relatively stable
expression profiles. Indeed, tissue-specific genes might be

more likely to diverge neutrally in their expression rate, making this an attractive model. However, given that Alus might
be related to higher divergence (as suggested by the correlation coefficient method), it would be unwise to suggest that
this is in any manner a robust conclusion.

Discussion
Alus are markers of higher breadth of expression in
primate genomes
Among all repetitive elements in the human genome, Alu
sequences are unique in several respects. Apart from being
the most common repetitive element, Alus are primate specific. Alu sequences are enriched in gene-dense regions [13],
particularly in the vicinity of housekeeping genes [15,16]. This
has prompted hypotheses for a widespread effect of Alu
sequences in regulating gene expression [6,7,37] and hence
controlling the morphologic characters of primates
[6,7,12,37]. This is supported by evidence from only a few
genes [6,19-26]. Our results, by contrast, show that Alu-mediated increases in expression breadth do not account for a
major part of the difference found between primate and
rodent transcriptomes as regards expression breadth. Moreover, their avoidance of transcriptional start sites argues
strongly against their acting as CpG islands. Instead, the
notion that Alu presence is a marker of expression breadth
makes for a more parsimonious interpretation of the
evidence.
What processes might account for Alu enrichment in the 5'flanking regions of human housekeeping genes? There could
be neutral and selectionist hypotheses. Several retroelements
exhibit an open chromatin 5' insertion flanking region bias
[56], which could provide a neutral hypothesis to, in part,
explain the observed Alu pattern. However, Alus appear to
insert preferentially in AT-rich regions rather than on GCrich regions, where gene density is higher [1,60,61] (but see
[62]), and so insertion bias alone is unlikely to account for all
features of the skewed distribution. The reasons for the shift
from AT-rich regions, where young Alus are more commonly
found, to the GC-rich regions, where older Alus are
concentrated, are a matter of debate. Some authors have proposed that neutral processes, such as variations in rates of
recombination [1,13,66-72] or changes in insertion preferences [72], might account for the observed distribution. Eller
and coworkers [17] suggest, for example, that illegitimate
recombination between linked Alu can cause deletions that
remove not just the Alu but intervening sequence as well. In
some genomic domains, such deletions might be more likely
to be neutral rather than deleterious. This might explain why
Alus end up being common in gene-dense regions, because in

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R25

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R25

Genome Biology 2008,

such regions a deletion is more likely to be deleterious. Perhaps with a higher density of control elements 5' than 3' of
genes, such a model might also go some way toward explaining the observed somewhat greater 5' than 3' enrichment.
Alternative selectionist models to that of Alus as modifiers of
gene expression breadth are also possible. For example, one
might suppose that Alus are situated in chromatin domains
that permit their expression should it be required, for example under stressful conditions [38-41]. It has, however, been
pointed out that the rate of fixation of Alus in GC-rich regions
is so slow that it might better be explained by neutral processes [67].

and Alu insertions/fixations/preservation are not related
processes.

Alus flanking housekeeping genes partly explain their
relation with functional categories
How then might we explain other curious features of the distribution of Alus, such as their association with genes of particular functional classes? Two studies have reported that Alu
sequences are found at different frequencies in genes that
serve different functions in the cell. One of the studies was
limited to genes found in chromosomes 21 and 22, and
focused only on Alus residing within genes [18]. The second
study was genome wide in scope and focused on the Alus
present at the 5' flanking region of genes [37]. Both studies
showed that genes associated with certain gene functions
have significantly more Alus, either within the gene or in their
flanking regions. Polak and Domany [37] appear to assume
that most of the variation observed in Alu frequencies linked
to different cell functions is related to the fact that Alu
sequences contain transcription factor binding sites.
Might the marker model also account for such biases? It is
possible that broadly expressed genes are skewed as regards
their cellular functions, in which case an incidental correlation with Alu content would be expected. Indeed, we found
that there is a significant association between expression
breadth and gene function (data not shown). We calculated
the average breadth of expression and Alu content in the
upstream flanking regions of genes associated with different
biologic processes. Figure 6 shows that those biologic processes with the highest average Alu content in their flanking
regions are also associated with a higher average breadth of
expression (r = 0.836 [P < 0.0001], n = 53 processes; Table
1). This suggests that skews in the sorts of genes serving particular cellular functions enriched for Alus can be, at least in
part, accounted for by the fact that Alus are housekeeping
gene markers.
In a related vein, because housekeeping genes tend to be slow
evolving [73,74], we might also expect Alu to reside near to
genes with low rates of protein evolution. This is indeed the
case, albeit only marginally so; Ka values are correlated to Alu
content in 5' flanking region (r = 0.051 [P < 0.001], n =
11,896), but not with downstream Alu content. The synonymous substitution rates are not significantly related to Alu
content in flanking regions, suggesting that point mutation

Conclusion

In summary, we find that there is Alu enrichment at flanking
regions of housekeeping genes and that previously reported
enrichment for highly expressed genes is a byproduct of the
co-variance between breadth and peak expression. This
enrichment is not explained by the relation of both breadth of
expression and Alu density to regional GC content. The
results from the comparative transcriptomics analyses presented here provide no evidence that Alu sequences have
boosted breadth of expression of adjacent genes during evolution of the primate transcriptome. Our results suggest
instead that Alus just tend to accumulate in the vicinity of
housekeeping genes; the marker model is then more parsimonious. Alus are related to other measures of expression divergence but the results are contradictory; by one measure they
are associated with greater divergence, whereas possibly the
more robust measure suggests that they are associated with
less divergence.

Materials and methods
Sequence analysis
Upstream and downstream flanking regions were downloaded for 20,490 human (20 kb) and 18,409 mouse (10 kb)
genes from Ensembl [75]. Alu sequences were then identified
and masked using RepeatMasker [76] for the human
sequences. Masked sequences were divided using a sliding
window approach into 1,000 bp bins moving in steps of 200
bp. Alu content (proportion of the bin occupied by masked
sequence) and GC content (for the masked and unmasked
sequences) were calculated for each bin. Mouse flanking
sequences were also analyzed through a sliding window
approach to calculate GC content. The automation of repeat
masker and the sliding window analysis were performed
using a script developed by LBO and is available upon
request.

Expression data
Quantitative estimates of gene activity were obtained from Su
and colleagues [44] for mouse and human genes. All probes
matching to the same gene were averaged. Data were
available for 63 tissues obtained from healthy human adults.
Corresponding mouse expression data were available for 26
tissues from the same source [44]. Two indices of gene activity were obtained - peak expression in any given tissue and
breadth of expression, or the number of tissues in which a
gene is expressed - for a total of 15,538 genes. Quantitative
estimates of gene expression were obtained by normalizing
the original signal values. Peak expression was the highest
expression in any given tissue was taken for each gene. For
breadth two procedures were used to estimate whether a gene
was being expressed at a given tissue, the first index simply

Average6 content and breadth of expression for genes serving different biologic processes
Average Alu content and breadth of expression for genes serving different biologic processes. Average Alu content and breadth of expression was
obtained for genes associated with different biologic processes (according to the Gene Ontology database; only categories with more than 100 genes were
taken into account). Each point in the graph represents genes associated with a particular biologic process. Error bars are standard errors for each group

takes the absence/presence (AP) calls provided (see Su and
coworkers [44] for details). However, this was not ideal
because there were huge variations in the total number of
genes expressed from tissue to tissue. Our second approach
required normalization such that the S values for each tissue
would total 1,000,000. We then applied a cut-off value of 50
(which corresponds in the average sample to the 200 cut-off
value as suggested by Su and coworkers [44]) to determine
whether a gene is expressed or not. The correlation between
the two measures was high (r = 0.714) and both were similarly
related to Alu content, although the normalized values were a
significantly better predictor of Alu content. All analyses in
this report use a measure of breadth of expression derived
from the normalized quantitative values, but similar results
were obtained when using the AP calls.

were pooled together. Best matching tag for each gene was
obtained from the SAGE genie website of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [45]. We then normalized all
libraries to 10,000 tags, and in any given tissue genes with
counts lower that 1 were considered not expressed. Peak and
breadth of expression indices were then calculated for each
gene. Note that the analyses were also performed by using the
best gene for each tag annotation. In this case, all tags matching to the same gene were averaged together. Similar results
were obtained in the best-tag-per-gene analyses.

37 human and mouse normal tissues in the form of count per

SAGE data were also obtained for human genes. Only normal
tissue libraries were included in analyses (corresponding to
35 tissues). All libraries corresponding to the same tissue

Mean and standard deviation (SD) for breadth and Alu content in the upstream region 2 to 6 kilobases away from transcription starting site are
shown for genes associated to each biological process. Only Gene Ontology (GO) categories containing more than 100 genes from our sample were
included in the analyses. Note that GO categories are not mutually exclusive.

Correction of parameters by regression analysis
To correct for the effect of GC content on Alu content, we took
the residuals from a regression analysis for each 1 kb window
of Alu content predicted by GC content in the same region.
Linear fits were used unless polynomial fits yielded
significantly better fit. The correction was performed using
values of GC content in both masked (for Alus) flanking
sequences. A similar procedure was used to correct for the
effect on expression of coding sequence divergence. Measures
of distance used included non synonymous substitution rate,
synonymous substitution rate, and non synonymous/synonymous rates of substitution (from the Ensembl website [75]).

Regional Alu content similarity
To correct for the similarity in Alu content in 5' and 3' flanking
regions, we regressed the content for each window of 1,000
bp in the 5' flanking region with the average Alu content in the
3' flanking region as the predictor. Alu content in 5' flanking
region was the expressed as the residual values of these
regressions. The opposite was done to correct for the Alu content local similarity in the 3' flanking region.

Human-mouse gene orthology
A sample of 11,896 homolog pairs of human and mouse genes
was gathered from the Ensembl website [75]. All genes with
more than one homolog match were eliminated from further
analysis. Measures of coding sequence divergence (dn, ds,
and dn/ds) were also obtained from the same source.

ference in the number of tissues both genes are expressed. For
quantitative expression, peak values for both mouse and
human genes were ranked and then difference in ranks was
then calculated. The second set, expression 'divergence' indices, relates in the case of breadth of expression to the sum of
switches from expressed to nonexpressed changes in expression for each tissue. In the case of quantitative expression, the
divergence between human mouse orthologs was calculated
after correcting the expression values using a scaling method
described by Liao and Zhang [65]. Correlation coefficients
and Euclidean distances were then obtained from the scaled
expression vectors for every pair of orthologous genes. Quadratic regression coefficients were used in assessing the
relation of divergence indices and Alu content as relationships do not always follow a linear trend (see Additional data
file 3 for histograms).
Divergence estimates from the Bodymap dataset [46] were
obtained for quantitative and binomial measures of expression profiles in a manner similar to that used for the microarray data. Breadth and peak differences were calculated for
each human-mouse orthologous pair. Breadth divergence
was calculated as the number of switches from expressed to
nonexpressed and vice versa. Quantitative divergence was
calculated as the correlation coefficient and Euclidean distances over counts per million and after scaling data [65] (See
Additional data file 4 for histograms).

Housekeeping tissue-specific analysis
Human-mouse expression divergence
Quantitative estimates of gene activity for mouse genes were
obtained from Su and colleagues [44]. All probes matching to
the same gene were averaged together. Genes with no unique
homolog counterpart were eliminated. Only tissues for which
libraries were present in both species were used in gene activity divergence assessment (32 tissues for healthy adults). All
samples were then normalized to make possible the comparison between mouse and human counterparts. Two types of
expression divergence were obtained. 'Difference' refers to
the difference in the indices of peak/breadth between human
and mouse. For breadth, 'difference' simply refers to the dif-

In the case of Bodymap data, there were very few gene pairs
in which the human copy was housekeeping and the mouse
counterpart was tissue specific and vice versa. We therefore
decided to take the top and bottom 5% of the distribution of
human breadth of expression. If the 5% limit left out some of
the genes expressed in the same number of genes as the last
gene selected, then those were included as well. For each
group we compared Alu content for the top and bottom 5% of
the genes in the distribution in terms of mouse breadth. We
found that although there is no significant differences in
human breadth of expression between the groups, Alu content was higher in those genes in which the mouse ortholog

Gene function
Biologic processes to which each gene is associated were
obtained from the Gene Ontology database. Each gene can be
associated with more than one gene function. Only those categories that contained more than 100 genes from our sample
were included in the analysis (Table 1).
