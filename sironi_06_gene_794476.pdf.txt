Background: Transposable elements (TEs) represent more than 45% of the human and mouse
genomes. Both parasitic and mutualistic features have been shown to apply to the host-TE
relationship but a comprehensive scenario of the forces driving TE fixation within mammalian genes
is still missing.

Results: We show that intronic multispecies conserved sequences (MCSs) have been affecting TE
integration frequency over time. We verify that a selective economizing pressure has been acting
on TEs to decrease their frequency in highly expressed genes. After correcting for GC content,
MCS density and intron size, we identified TE-enriched and TE-depleted gene categories. In
addition to developmental regulators and transcription factors, TE-depleted regions encompass
loci that might require subtle regulation of transcript levels or precise activation timing, such as
growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and genes involved in the immune response. The latter,
despite having reduced frequencies of most TE types, are significantly enriched in mammalian-wide
interspersed repeats (MIRs). Analysis of orthologous genes indicated that MIR over-representation
also occurs in dog and opossum immune response genes, suggesting, given the partially independent
origin of MIR sequences in eutheria and metatheria, the evolutionary conservation of a specific
function for MIRs located in these loci. Consistently, the core MIR sequence is over-represented
in defense response genes compared to the background intronic frequency.

It is widely recognized that a large fraction of mammalian
genomic DNA is accounted for by interspersed repeated ele-

ments. These sequences have been estimated to represent
more than 50% of the human genome [1]. In particular, the
great majority of human interspersed repeats derive from

transposable elements (TEs). Four major classes of mammalian TEs have been identified in mammals: long interspersed
elements (LINEs), short interspersed elements (SINEs), LTR
retrotrasposons and DNA transposons.
Overall, TEs cover more than 45% of the human genome [1]
but, most probably, another huge portion of human DNA is
accounted for by ancient transposons that have diverged too
far to be recognized as such. Indeed, different TE subtypes
have been active over different evolutionary periods [2],
implying that multiple copies of propagating elements accumulated over discrete time periods depending on the presence of an active source. The result of this age-dependent
accumulation is that many TEs are restricted to closely
related species: about a half of human repeats cannot be identified in genomes of other than primate origin [3]; similarly,
most repeats that can be detected in mouse DNA are specific
to rodents. Nonetheless, repeated sequences that are common to all mammalian genomes exist as they probably amplified before the mammalian radiation [3].
Once considered as merely junk DNA, it is now widely recognized that interspersed repeats have been playing a major role
in genome structure evolution as well as having an impact on
increased protein variability [2,4-8] and gene regulation [9].
Also, recent evidence has suggested that LINE elements have
been influencing genome-wide regulation of gene expression
[10] and possibly imprinting [11], while several reports [1216] showed that specific TEs in noncoding DNA regions have
been actively preserved among multiple species during evolution. Still, these observations do not contradict the 'selfish
DNA' concept, regarding TEs as parasitic elements that rely
more on their replication efficiency than on providing selective advantage to their host [17-19]; rather, evidence of selective benefits offered by TEs indicate that these elements have,
in some instances, been 'domesticated' [20] or recruited to
serve their host, a process also referred to as exaptation [21].
Several studies have suggested that TE integrations have been
subjected to purifying selection to limit the genetic load
imposed on their host. For example, genetic damage caused
by LINE retrotransposition and ectopic recombination has
been hypothesized to be responsible for selection against
these elements within human loci [22]. Also, LINE and LTR
elements have been reported to be underrepresented in proximity to and within genes [23], probably as a cause of their
interference with regulatory processes.
In mammals the great majority of genes are interrupted by
introns that usually outsize coding sequences by several fold.
Similar to TEs, intervening regions were initially regarded as
scrap DNA before being recognized as fundamental elements
in the evolution of living organisms. TEs are abundant within
intronic regions as well as in 5' and 3' intergenic spacers; yet,
a comprehensive analysis of the forces driving TE insertion,
fixation and maintenance within mammalian genes has still
not been carried out. Here we show that gene features such as

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/12/R120

sequence conservation, function and expression level shape
TE representation in human genes. Interestingly, we found
evidence that a subset of loci involved in immune responses
are enriched with MIR sequences; analysis of opossum
orthologous genes, as well as of MIR frequency profiles, indicated that these TEs might serve a specific function in these
loci.

Results
TE distribution varies with gene class or function
We wished to verify whether different TE types might be differentially represented depending on gene function. TE frequency varies with intron length [24] and GC percentage [1].
Moreover, in line with previous findings [24], we show that,
although differences exist depending on MCS and TE age,
conserved sequences have an overall negative effect on TE fixation frequency (Additional data file 1). For each TE type we
therefore performed multiple regression analysis on TE
number using intronic GC percentage, intron length and conserved sequence length as independent variables. The fitted
values were then used to predict the expected TE number per
intron (nTEiexp). For each gene, the TE normalized abundance (Tena) was calculated as follows:

⎛
⎜ ∑ nTEiobs − ∑ nTEiexp
⎜ i∈gene
i∈gene
⎝
⎛
⎜ ∑ nTEiobs − ∑ nTEiexp
p
⎜ i∈gene
i∈gene
⎝

⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠

where nTEiobs is the observed number of TEs per intron.
These calculations were performed for all TE families in both
human and mouse.
For each TE family, genes displaying three times more or less
TE than expected (TEna > 0.5 or TEna < -0.5) were classified as
TE-rich or TE-poor, respectively.
We next used GeneMerge [25] to retrieve significant associations; database annotations for the three categories designated by the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium (molecular
function, biological process and cellular component) were
employed. Correction for multiple tests was applied to all statistical analyses. For each significant GO term retrieved,
genes that are present in the study set and associate (therefore contribute) to the term are designated as 'contributing
genes'. We also calculated MCS density and intergenic TE frequency of contributing genes. In particular, for intergenic
sequences, TEna (igTEna) was calculated as described for
introns; for contributing gene sets the fractional igTEna deviation was then calculated as:
(Mean igTEna in contributing genes - mean igTEna in all
genes)/|mean igTEna in all genes|

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R120

Similarly, fractional MCS density deviation was calculated for
contributing gene sets.

mammals, MIR density in these genes is not accounted for by
fewer integrations of younger TEs since MIR frequency
remains significantly higher than the average when calculated
on TE-free (unique) intron size. To gain further insight into
this issue, we singled out all genes contributing to at least one
GO term in Table 2 (85 genes) and searched for a murine
ortholog in our mouse gene dataset; 61 best unique reciprocal
orthologs were identified and their MIR density (calculated
on unique intron sequence) was significantly higher (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 10-14) than the average (calculated
on all murine genes in our dataset). The same procedure was
applied to mouse MIR-rich genes contributing to GO terms in
Table 3; again, human genes displayed significantly higher
intronic MIR densities (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 10-14).
The difference between human and mouse in GO terms associated with MIR-rich genes, therefore, results from the cut-off
we used (TEna > 0.5, corresponding to three times more than
expected) to define MIR-rich genes.

GO terms associated with high MIR density differed between
human (Table 2) and mouse (Table 3); in particular, MIR-rich
genes belong to the immune response pathway in humans,
while they mainly code for ion channels in mice. In both

Genes displaying higher than expected TE frequencies were
also identified for all repeat families, although they were less
numerous than TE-poor genes. GO analysis retrieved significant associations (Bonferroni-corrected p value < 0.01) only
for MIR-rich human genes (Table 2).

interactions

TE-rich gene categories

We therefore wished to verify whether high MIR frequency in
immune response genes also occurs in mammalian species
other than human and mouse. We therefore analyzed MIR
frequency in dog, as well as in our most distant extant mammalian ancestors, namely metatherian. To this aim we
searched both Canis familiaris and Monodelphis domestica
(gray short-tailed opossum) annotation tables and retrieved
dog/opossum genomic positions corresponding to human
transcripts in our dataset. A total of 5,476 human genes could
be located on the Monodelphis sequence (7,454 on the dog
sequence) and, out of 85 MIR-rich immune response genes,
77 were identified in opossum (79 in dog). We then calculated
the frequency of mammalian-wide MIRs within dog and
opossum genes: in both species (Figure 1) immune response
loci displayed significantly higher frequencies compared to
the remaining genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 10-15 and
0.022 for dog and opossum, respectively). Interestingly, in
addition to mammalian-wide MIR sequences, metatherian/
monotremata-specific MIR-related TEs are interspersed in
the opossum genome. These latter are mainly accounted for
by MON1 and MAR1 [3], and show 90% identity with the MIR
core sequence [27]. Opossum immune response loci also

Moreover, a relatively small set of genes involved in sexual
reproduction/spermatogenesis were found to display lower
than expected MIR frequencies (both in introns and intergenic sequences) in humans but not in rodents.

We next wished to verify whether these genes also had higher
frequencies of other ancestral TEs, namely L2s and DNA
transposons. The frequencies of these elements were calculated on TE-free intron size and no significant differences
were identified in either human or mouse when MIR-rich
genes involved in immune responses were compared to all
genes (not shown); this finding suggests that relaxation of
selective constraints allowing accumulation of ancestral TE
insertions is not responsible for MIR over-representation in
these genes. Conversely, MIR-rich ion channel introns also
displayed significantly higher frequencies of both DNA transposons and L2s, indicating, therefore, that the relative enrichment in old TEs is not specific to MIRs.

deposited research

Significant associations were also identified with biological
process GO terms. As expected [1,26] genes involved in morphogenesis/development were over-represented in most TEpoor groups and displayed extremely conserved intronic
regions as well as few intergenic TEs (except for LTRs). Also,
loci involved in immune defense/response to stimulus were
found to be over-represented among TE-poor genes. These
loci also have less TEs in their flanking regions and, on average, low MCS densities. Consistently with molecular function
GO term retrieval, genes involved in biological processes such
as transcription and metabolism were found to be overrepresented among TE-poor groups. Again, similar findings were
obtained when mouse genes (supplementary Table 1 in Additional data file 2) were analyzed, although no biological process GO term was significantly over-represented among genes
displaying low LINE or DNA transposon frequencies.

reports

Data concerning significant (Bonferroni-corrected p value <
0.01) GO associations are summarized in Table 1. Three main
molecular function categories were found to be associated
with genes displaying low TEna (for more than one TE family).
The first one is accounted for by genes involved in nucleic acid
binding and transcription; these loci have, on average, high
intronic MCS densities and few TEs in their flanking regions.
The second functional category is represented by genes coding for cytokines/growth factors/hormones and, more generally, receptor ligands: these genes do not have, as a whole,
higher than average intron conservation and, with the exception of LTR-poor genes, tend to have low igTEna. The last category (not present among Alu-poor genes) is accounted for by
structural molecules, mainly represented by ribosomal proteins. These genes have extremely low MCS densities and
igTEna. These same associations were retrieved for mouse
genes (supplementary Table 1 in Additional data file 2),
although no GO term was significantly associated with L1depleted mouse genes.

sum test, p = 0.0023) (Figure 1).

Characterization of MIR sequences associated with
immune response genes
We next wished to verify whether MIR sequences in immune
response genes have some feature distinguishing them from
MIRs in other genomic locations. Four highly related MIR
subtypes (MIR, MIR3, MIRb and MIRm) have been identified
in the murine and human genomes [3]; the four subtypes display a central, almost identical 70 base-pair (bp) core region
[28]. To verify whether any MIR region has been preferentially retained in MIR-rich immune response genes, we
retrieved all MIR elements located in the intronic regions of
these genes or in their flanking intergenic spacers. In the latter case, we restricted the analysis to TEs located within 15 kb

of 5' or 3' gene boundaries. We next used the different MIR
subtype reference sequences [3] to align all instances in
immune response gene introns or intergenic spacers separately. To verify whether any MIR region was over- or underrepresented in these genes, we compared the average relative
frequency at each position with frequencies derived from 100
samples of an equal number of MIR sequences randomly
selected from either introns or intergenic spacers. The mean,
as well as the 1st and 99th percentiles in random sample frequency distributions were then calculated at each position;
they are plotted in Figure 2a together with average frequencies of MIRs located in immune response genes. This calculation was not performed for MIRm sequences because of their
paucity (47 instances in immune genes). The frequency profile of MIR, MIR3 and MIRb sequences located in immune
response gene introns indicates that the central core region is
over-represented (beyond the 99th percentile) compared to

where TEfintron is the average TE frequency for all introns in
the same gene, meanTEfintron is the average TE frequency for
all introns in all genes, TEfinter is the TE frequency averaged
for 5' and 3' regions flanking each gene and meanTEfinter is the
average TE frequency for all intergenic spacers. Again lowess
curves were obtained, as well as empirical probability intervals derived from 100 random permutations; as shown in Figure 4b, for highly expressed genes and for all TE types, a
significant decreasing trend is observed when frequency differences are plotted against gene expression. The same observations were confirmed using expression data derived from
SAGE experiments and they also apply to mouse genes (supplementary Figures 3 to 5 in Additional data file 2). It is worth
noting that very similar results were also obtained when the
same calculations were performed using 8 kb sequences
flanking each gene (4 kb each side) instead of entire intergenic regions (supplementary Figure 6a,b in Additional data
file 2 for human genes and data obtained with either microarray or SAGE, respectively). For the latter analyses only genes

interactions

Different TE types have been reported to differentially associate with gene regions depending on expression levels [29]. To
get further insight into this issue, we calculated expression
level (averaged over all tissues) for human and mouse genes
in our dataset. Since different experimental methods for
measuring gene expression have been shown to yield different results [30], we used expression data derived from two
different experimental methods, namely microarray and
serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). For each family,
TEna was then plotted against expression level and lowess
curves calculated (see Materials and methods for details). To
address the significance of the observed trends, 100 lowess
smooths were calculated after random data permutations and
empirical probability intervals were calculated (see Materials
and methods). As is evident from Figure 4a, a marked
decrease in TEna is observed for genes above the 70th to 80th

To gain further insight, we wished to compare intronic with
intergenic TE frequecies (TE number/sequence length). In
fact, intergenic and intronic regions belong to the same
isochore (that is, they display a similar CG percentage) and
their lengths are correlated [31], as well as their MCS density
(Spearman rho = 0.37, p < 10-16); therefore, TE density can be
directly compared. Thus, for each gene we calculated the relative frequency difference as:

We therefore analyzed the human/mouse co-conservation
profile (that is, the frequency of bases that, in both human
and mouse, are equal to the MIR consensus sequence) of
human/mouse orthologous MIR instances. No significant difference was observed (Figure 3a-c) between MIRs located in
immune response introns and random MIR samples. Yet, as
is evident from Figure 3d, the central portion of intronic MIR
sequences, either located in defence response genes or not, is
more frequently co-conserved compared to 5' and 3' flanking
regions.

not apply to MIRb and MIR3 sequences in intergenic regions

response genes.

Discussion

TE distribution in mammalian genomes has been addressed
in numerous studies. Yet, many questions concerning the
nature of the host-element relationship still remain unanswered and a comprehensive scenario of the selective forces
affecting TE fixation in mammalian genomes is still missing.
In particular, genome-wide analyses of TE type distribution
within and in proximity to human genes have often neglected
relevant features, such as sequence conservation, gene function and expression level.
Since the precise removal of an inserted transposon is a rare
event [32], present day TE distribution is the result of insertion frequency and fixation probability over time. Previous
work had indicated that TE frequency inversely correlates

with different measures of noncoding sequence conservation
[24,33,34]. We confirm here (see Additional data file 1) that
these observations are explained by the intrinsic mutagenic
potential of transposition and the necessity of preserving
multispecies conserved sequences from disruption. In fact,
TE insertion is counterselected at different degrees depending on the relative timing of MCS fixation and TE activity.
Given this premise and considering insertion to be mutagenic
irrespective of TE family or type, we analyzed the distribution
of different TEs in human introns after correcting for the
known parameters affecting either integration frequency or
fixation probability, namely GC content [1,35], intron size
[24,34] and MCS density (this study and [24]). All analyses
have been carried out in parallel on human and mouse genes.
Such a procedure strengthens the ensuing conclusions since
the majority of TEs are specific to either species [3] and the
maintenance of ancestral TEs also differs between primates
and rodents due to the higher mutation rate of the latter [34].
Also, we analyzed intronic TE distribution in association with

information

The initial analysis of the human genome sequence [1] had
indicated that the HOX gene cluster is virtually deprived of
TEs; the same result was obtained upon analysis of the mouse
genome and interpreted in terms of TEs disturbing fine tuned
regulation of developmental genes. A more recent study indicated that TE-free regions are significantly associated with
genes coding for developmental regulators or transcription
factors [26].

Our GO data indicate that functional classes associated with
TE-poor genes extend well beyond highly conserved gene categories such as developmental regulators and transcription
factors. In fact, some MCS-poor gene function categories also
display lower than expected TEs; genes coding for structural
molecules and ribosomal proteins are deprived of most TE
families in both introns and intergenic spacers. These loci are
mainly accounted for by housekeeping genes; if low TE representation in intronic regions might be explained by the need
to reduce transcriptional costs (in agreement with TE paucity
in introns of highly expressed genes, as discussed below), the
reason why TEs are also excluded from intergenic spacers is
more difficult to explain. One possibility is that extensive
methylation of repetitive elements might exert a negative regulation on nearby gene expression with detrimental consequences for housekeeping genes. Indeed, several reports [3740] have suggested the existence of specific methylation patterns in TEs (probably representing a cellular defence mechanism against transposition) and methylation has been
shown to spread in cis from TEs to flanking cellular sequences

interactions

both MCS content and TE abundance in intergenic regions. In
fact, although we corrected for MCS presence in multiple
regression fitting, MCS content represents an indication of
gene complexity and regulatory accuracy [36]. On the other
hand, TE representation in intergenic spacers might highlight
differences in TE effect depending on location; this is especially relevant for TE families that have been previously
reported to be preferentially abundant in intergenic versus
intronic regions or vice versa [23].

in plants and yeast [41,42]. In this respect, it is intriguing that
Alus, which show lower methylation levels [40], possibly due
to their association with a 'protective' sperm protein [43], are
not preferentially excluded from these same housekeeping
gene sets (Table 1). Similar considerations might be applied
to genes coding for cytokines, growth factors, and hormones
as well as genes involved in immune responses, all of which
display few intronic and intergenic TEs. Still, these genes are
not housekeeping genes or highly expressed and they also display lower than expected Alu frequencies. We speculate that
these gene categories might require extremely subtle regulation of transcript levels (especially in the case of secreted proteins) or precise timing of activation (for example, in
response to a stimulus). Indeed, altered hormone or cytokine
levels have been associated with human disease and cancer
(reviewed in [44,45]), while the effects of immune response
gene misregulation are easily envisaged. As mentioned above,
TEs can influence gene expression by both altering the epigenetic state of TE-carrying alleles [46,47] and providing promoters and transcription factor binding sites (either
enhancers or suppressors (reviewed in [48,49]) to the genes
neighboring their integration sites. In particular, Alus have
been shown to potentially carry functional sites for different
transcription factors as well as for both steroid-hormone and
retinoic acid receptors (reviewed in [48]); these observations
have led to the speculation that Alu integration might cause a
genetic disease not through gene coding sequence disruption
but rather through alteration of gene expression patterns
[50]. Indeed, several gene categories displaying lower than
expected intronic Alu frequencies also show significantly
fewer Alus in flanking intrergenic spacers.
It is interesting to notice that genes involved in immune
response, which display extremely low conservation in both
coding [51-53] and non-coding sequences [36], as well as a
higher content of TEs in their untranslated sequences [54],
are deprived of most TE types but enriched in MIR sequences
in three eutherian species (human, mouse and dog). Given
the partially independent origin of MIR sequences in eutheria
and metatheria, it is important to notice that analysis of
orthologous genes indicated that MIR over-representation
also occurs in opossum immune response genes, suggesting
the evolutionary conservation of a specific function for MIRs
located in these loci.
MIRs belong to a large TE superfamily referred to as CORESINE [53]; all CORE-SINE TEs share a common 65 bp central
region that was proposed to be either relevant for retrotranspositional activity [27,55] or functional in the host genome

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/12/R120

[28]. Previous studies noted a higher representation in mammalian genomes of MIR core regions compared to flanking 3'
and 5' sequences [12,28]; our data indicate that the core
sequence is both more frequent and more conserved in the
human genome, as assessed by co-conservation profiles.
Since MIRs are thought to be long time fossils [28], this
observation suggests that the core might serve some general
function in mammalian genomes. Indeed, upon analysis of
aligned human-mouse intergenic sequences, Silva et al. [12]
suggested that the core region is more often present in aligning orthologous regions than expected on the basis of background genome frequency. Our data indicate that this
observation also applies to MIR sequences located in immune
response gene introns. To our knowledge, this is the first
report showing that a specific TE family is evolutionarily
associated with a gene function category. Whether MIRs
located in defense response genes serve a specific function or
they share a common role with the other core sequences in the
genome remains to be elucidated. Recent works indicated
that two ancient SINE families have been extensively exapted
in the human genome and copies of these TEs have been
recruited to serve distinct functions in different genomic locations [14,16]. This might also be the case for MIRs; alternatively, these sequences might all share a general role in the
human genome that is particularly important in immune
defense loci.
The last part of our work is devoted to studying the influence
of gene expression level on TE distribution. In fact, despite
the small population size, it has been reported that human
genes show signatures consistent with selection mediated by
expression levels [56]. In particular, selective pressure aimed
at reducing transcriptional cost has been proposed to act on
highly expressed human genes and TEs had been suggested as
possible targets for selection to act upon [57]. Our findings
strongly support this view: all TE families are under-represented in highly expressed genes. While the ability of LINE
L1s to affect mRNA transcription/processing efficiency [10]
might explain their exclusion from highly expressed introns,
Alus have been reported to associate with highly expressed
gene regions [29] and no direct effect on transcription or
processing has ever been described for ancestral TE families.
Therefore, the expression-dependent exclusion of all TE families from intronic regions is strongly consistent with the need
to reduce the transcription energetic costs. The issue had also
been raised as to whether a selective pressure is still acting on
highly expressed genes or if we merely witness the remnants
of a previous action of selection (still not at equilibrium) [56].

Gene-expression dependent variation in TE intronic abundance
Gene-expression dependent variation in TE intronic abundance. Gene expression levels were derived from microarray data. (a) Lowess fit (solid line) and
probability intervals (hatched lines) of TEna versus gene expression level (log transformed values) for the six TE families. (b) Lowess fit (solid line) and
probability intervals (hatched lines) of intronic to intergenic relative TE frequency difference (see text) versus gene expression level (log transformed
values).

Our data support the first hypothesis: Alus, which represent
relatively young TEs are under-represented in highly
expressed introns and, in both human and mouse, separation
in TE divergence classes did not reveal any different expression-dependent association with TE age (not shown).

genes, accounting for 81,599 and 55,553 introns, respectively.
For each gene, the closest 5' and 3' known genes were identified (using the UCSC knownGene table [58]); intergenic
regions were defined as the genomic portions extending
upstream and downstream of the transcribed region to the
closest gene.

Materials and methods

Transposable elements were identified and categorized using
the UCSC annotation tables that rely on RepeatMasker. MCS
were obtained using phastCons predictions [13,59], which are
based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model and are available through the UCSC database (phastConsElements Table
[58]). MCSs were derived from human/chimpanzee/mouse/
rat/dog/chicken/pufferfish/zebrafish multiz alignments
[58].

Sequence retrieval and analysis
For creation of the intron database, human genes that had
been annotated in the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq)
collection were selected (reviewed or validated entries only);
for mouse genes 'Provisional' entries were also included.
Genomic sequences, intron/exon boundaries and intergenic
regions were derived from the UCSC genome annotation
database [58] (assembly hg17 for human and mm5 for
mouse). Intronless genes were discarded and, for each gene,
the transcript corresponding to the longest genomic sequence
and containing the highest number of exons was selected. The
datasets are composed of 7,614 human and 5,550 mouse

Only purely noncoding phastCons elements were selected
(that is, MCSs partially overlapping with exons were discarded); a total of 238,005 and 596,018 human MCSs were
retrieved in introns and intergenic sequences, respectively. In

mouse, 133,458 intronic and 312,752 intergenic MCSs were
identified.

Expression data

MIR sequence analysis
MIR consensus sequences were derived from the Genetic
Information Research Institute (RepeatMasker database,
release 20060314) [62].

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using R [68]. Locally
weighted scatter plot smoothing was performed using lowess
curves [69]. These curves are produced by weighted leastsquare linear fitting within a window sliding through the data.
The size of the window (span) controls the degree of smoothing and the curves are made robust by iterating the fit within
each window discarding outliers. In all cases 5 robustifying
iterations were performed and a span of 0.5 was used. To
allow empirical p value calculations, we performed 100 independent random data permutations of the variable on the y
axis. Indeed, computing lowess smooths after random permutations of the data can be used as a reference to gauge the
significance of the pattern observed on the actual data [70].

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 contains suppleGenome Biology 2006, 7:R120

information

Probability interval limits were chosen, for each x value, as
corresponding to p = 0.005 and p = 0.995 in the distribution
of the 100 permutated y values considered as a Gaussian.

interactions

For calculation of MIR co-conservation profiles, we used the
liftOver utility at the UCSC genome browser [58] to obtain
human/mouse orthologous MIR instances. MIRs were then
aligned to the reference sequence using ClustalW. Microinsertions in human instances were ignored. For each MIR
position in human instances we calculated the frequency of
co-conservation (that is, the frequency of bases that, in both
human and mouse, are equal to the MIR consensus
sequence). This procedure was applied to both MIRs located
in immune response introns and to 100 randomly selected
MIR samples of equal size and located within intronic
regions. The co-conservation profile was then calculated
using a smoothing spline with a span of ten bases over nonCpG positions.

Finally, we added all counts for libraries representing the
same tissue type and converted absolute tag counts to relative
tag counts (counts per million).

refereed research

For calculation of the MIR relative frequency profile, human
or mouse MIR instances were aligned to the consensus
sequence using SWAT [63]. Microinsertions in human and
mouse instances were ignored. The relative frequency profile
at each position of the consensus sequence was calculated as
the number of instances covering the position divided by the
total number of bases in instances.

SAGE libraries were obtained from the SAGE Genie website
[66]; for both organisms, libraries containing less than
20,000 tags, corresponding to tumor tissues, uncharacterized tissues, pharmacological treatments and mutated samples were discarded. As previously suggested [67], libraries
with mean tag GC content >0.5 were also removed. We
retained 81 human libraries (both long and short tags),
accounting for 21 tissues; for mouse, we retained 98 libraries
accounting for 41 tissues.

deposited research

Gene associations with GO terms and their descriptions were
performed by cross-referencing the UCSC hg17 kgXref table
[57] with the GO database [61]. Association and description
files were then created and significant associations between
gene groups and GO terms were identified using GeneMerge
[25].

reports

Gene classification

Microarray expression data for human and mouse genes were
derived from previous high-throughoutput gene expression
studies [64,65]; they are publicly accessible through the
UCSC database (tables 'gnfHumanAtlas2median' and
'gnfHumanAtlas2medianExps', and 'gnfMouseAtlas2median'
and 'gnfMouseAtlas2medianExps') [58]. We only considered
probes corresponding to genes that had been included in our
database; signals from duplicated probes on the same chip
were averaged as well as replicates from the same tissue. A
gene was considered to be expressed in a given tissue if its signal level was higher or equal to 200 arbitrary units, as previously recommended [64]. Data derived from tumor tissues
were discarded. In the case of SAGE data, for each transcript
entry in our databases we extracted a SAGE tag (10 bp downstream of the most 3' NlaIII site). For both human and
mouse, tags were then matched to all RefSeq mRNAs and
purged if they corresponded to more than one transcript.

reviews

Retrieval of opossum and dog genes and annotations was performed using UCSC tables [58] referring to assembly
monDom1 and canFam2. In particular, opossum/dog mRNA
accession numbers were identified by cross-referencing
tables 'geneName' and 'gbCdnaInfo' [58]. Genomic locations
were next retrieved through tables xenoMrna or
blastHg17KG. Monodelphis and dog TE annotations were
directly obtained from UCSC [58] and MIR number per gene
was calculated as the number of distinct elements fully contained between gene boundaries. MIR frequency was calculated as MIR number/gene length.

For the identification of human-mouse orthologous pairs, the
EnsMart database [60] was interrogated and only entries representing unique best reciprocal hits were selected.
