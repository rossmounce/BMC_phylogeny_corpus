Abstract
Background: Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) inhabit the coastlines of large and small
islands throughout the Galápagos archipelago, providing a rich system to study the spatial and
temporal factors influencing the phylogeographic distribution and population structure of a species.
Here, we analyze the microevolution of marine iguanas using the complete mitochondrial control
region (CR) as well as 13 microsatellite loci representing more than 1200 individuals from 13
islands.
Results: CR data show that marine iguanas occupy three general clades: one that is widely
distributed across the northern archipelago, and likely spread from east to west by way of the
South Equatorial current, a second that is found mostly on the older eastern and central islands,
and a third that is limited to the younger northern and western islands. Generally, the CR haplotype
distribution pattern supports the colonization of the archipelago from the older, eastern islands to
the younger, western islands. However, there are also signatures of recurrent, historical gene flow
between islands after population establishment. Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite
genotypes indicates the existence of twenty distinct genetic clusters generally following a onecluster-per-island pattern. However, two well-differentiated clusters were found on the
easternmost island of San Cristóbal, while nine distinct and highly intermixed clusters were found
on youngest, westernmost islands of Isabela and Fernandina. High mtDNA and microsatellite

genetic diversity were observed for populations on Isabela and Fernandina that may be the result
of a recent population expansion and founder events from multiple sources.
Conclusions: While a past genetic study based on pure FST analysis suggested that marine iguana
populations display high levels of nuclear (but not mitochondrial) gene flow due to male-biased
dispersal, the results of our sex-biased dispersal tests and the finding of strong genetic
differentiation between islands do not support this view. Therefore, our study is a nice example of
how recently developed analytical tools such as Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequencebased demographic analyses can overcome potential biases introduced by simply relying on FST
estimates from markers with different inheritance patterns.

Background
The legacy of the Galápagos archipelago may be forever
attached to the development of Darwin's theory. Yet, the
unique character of these islands have continued to make
them an ideal model for evolutionary study [1,2]. The
Galápagos archipelago is geographically isolated - approximately 1,000 km west of South America - and has never
been attached to any continental land mass [3]. Consequently, it is home to many endemic taxa that have colonized the islands either once [4-10] or very few times
[9,11,12]. Such a system offers an opportunity to study
the radiation of species from a limited ancestral stock
without the confounding signals of recurrent colonization. In addition, the islands vary significantly in size and
degree of isolation, providing a range of conditions under
which to examine the interplay between evolutionary
diversification and different demographic processes
[13,14]. Finally, the geologic history of the Galápagos is
well known, supplying a temporal framework upon
which to reconstruct the biogeographic history of various
species. The islands were produced by a hotspot that lies
beneath the Nazca plate, which is traveling in an eastward
direction. Consequently, island ages generally decrease
from east to west [3,15-17], and the colonization
sequences of many organisms show a progression from
older to younger islands (i.e. progression rule or "island
progression hypothesis" sensu Wagner and Funk [18];
reviewed in [2]).
Among the organisms that inhabit the Galápagos, one of
the most amenable to evolutionary study is the marine
iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). This species is endemic
to the archipelago and is frequently found along the
coasts of all the major islands as well as many smaller
ones. Marine iguanas exhibit a unique natural history
among lizards, feeding almost exclusively on specific
algae species in the intertidal or subtidal zones, while
breeding and nesting completely on land [19,20]. They
possess physical attributes that enable them to negotiate
the marine environment, including a flattened tail for
swimming and long, sharp nails for clinging to rocks in
the surf. The presence of marine iguana populations on
islands throughout the archipelago provides a rich system

for examining the roles of island population size, age and
isolation, as well as current flow, on patterns of migration,
distribution, and long-term population history.
Morphological and genetic data have revealed that the
closest relative of Amblyrhynchus is the genus of terrestrial
iguanas, Conolophus, which is also endemic to the Galápagos [8,21-23]. Molecular dating based on mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) and immunological comparisons yielded
a divergence time estimate of 10-20 million years (myr)
for the two genera [8,24], which is significantly more
ancient than the 3-5 myr age estimate of the oldest islands
[3,15,16]. A proposed explanation for these results is that
marine and land iguanas diverged from each other on
now-sunken islands lying to the east of the present-day
archipelago [8,24-26].
A comprehensive genetic study based on both mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) data as well as nuclear-coded
loci (three microsatellite and three minisatellite loci),
traced back the microevolution of 22 population/subpopulations of marine iguanas from 15 islands in the archipelago [27]. Despite at least ten million years of
independent evolutionary history on the Galápagos, this
study suggested that only one or a few related mtDNA
haplotypes were involved in the colonization of the
present-day archipelago from now-submerged islands
[27]. While the overall levels of genetic divergence at both
mtDNA and nuclear markers were low, these two markers
revealed different patterns of genetic structuring and
migration between island populations. Based on cytb
data, marine iguana populations were grouped into three
major lineages: one occupying the older eastern and central islands, another found mostly in the geographically
distant northern islands, and a third distributed across the
northern and younger western islands. However, this
genetic structuring was not supported by nuclear markers,
which did not show any clear sign of population differentiation among islands. Based on these results, nuclear
gene flow was supposed to be high across the archipelago
and is mainly the result of male-biased dispersal as males
have been observed to swim to different islands during
the breeding season [27]. This was one of the first examPage 2 of 18

ples of male-biased dispersal based on molecular evidence and is still used in textbooks (e.g. p. 229 in [28]).
In this study, we revisit the population genetic structure of
marine iguanas in order to lend insight into the patterns
of gene flow, genetic diversity, and demographic history
of this species. Data is presented from over 1200 individuals from 23 populations sampled at two different time
points using an increased number of nuclear markers
(thirteen microsatellite loci) as well as the typically fastevolving mtDNA control region (CR). We use this information to unravel patterns of past and current dispersal in
marine iguanas, and discuss results within the context of
the island progression hypothesis and sex-biased dispersal.

Methods
Sampling and genetic data collection
Marine iguanas were sampled during two different time
periods, 1991/1993 and 2004. Samples from 1991/93
were a subset of those collected and analyzed from the
Rassmann et al. study [27]. The total sampling effort
resulted in more than 1200 marine iguana specimens
spanning 13 islands and 23 populations (Figure 1b; Table
1). Eleven of these locations were sampled during both
time periods to meet the objectives of a parallel study
examining changes in genetic diversity due to an intense
El Niño event [29].

Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples in
a 96-well format using the QIAamp 96 DNA Blood Kit
(QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Complete mtDNA CR sequences (1183 bp) were generated for 1203 marine iguana specimens using PCR protocols that are described elsewhere [29,30]. We genotyped
thirteen microsatellite loci for 1225 individuals: locus
Am(GT)4 from [27] and twelve loci from [31] following
the same procedures as described before [29].
Phylogenetic analysis of CR sequences
CR sequences were edited in the program SEQUENCHER
v4.2.2 [32] and aligned using the program MUSCLE v3.6
[33]. Unique haplotypes were defined and numbered
using the program DNASP v4.20.2 [34]. The program
MRMODELTEST v2 [35], which is based on code from the
MODELTEST software [36], was used to evaluate the fit of
different nucleotide substitution models to the data. The
Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model [37] with additional
parameters for gamma distribution and fraction of invariable sites (HKY+G+I) provided the best fit to the haplotype data according to both the hierarchical likelihood
ratio test and the Akaike information criterion. This substitution model was implemented in a Bayesian framework using the program MRBAYES v3.1.2 [38] with a
search of 2.5 × 106 generations where the first 10% of
parameter samples were discarded as burn-in.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/297

Since the point of branch connection between marine
iguana mtDNA phylogroups and Galápagos land iguanas
has previously been shown to be unclear due to the large
divergence between the two species [27], the root of the
marine iguana phylogeny was inferred for CR sequences
using a relaxed clock model implemented in the program
BEAST v.1.4.7 [39]. As in the phylogenetic analysis, the
HKY+G+I model of nucleotide substitution was applied.
An evolutionary model was chosen where the substitution
rates among branches were uncorrelated, and an expansion growth prior was assumed since marine iguanas
exhibit shallow divergence and are likely still in the process of reaching population genetic equilibrium in parts of
their range. The analysis was run twice with 2 × 106 generations each, and the first 10% of parameter values were
discarded as burn-in. Adequate mixing was determined by
examining the effective sample size and parameter trace
values as visualized in the program TRACER v1.4 [40] and
the two runs were combined to obtain an overall estimate
of the posterior distribution of parameters.
CR analysis of genetic diversity and population structure
The number of haplotypes (h), haplotype diversity (Hd),
nucleotide diversity ( ), and the average number of nucleotide differences between sequences (K) were calculated
for each population using DNASP. Data were generated
separately for the two temporal samples (1993 and 2004)
from Marchena island, as a previous study showed that a
bottleneck occurred in between samplings [29]. For all
other populations, samples from the two time-points
were combined. FST calculations based on Wright's
FST [41] and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)
were performed in the program ARLEQUIN v3.11 [42] in
order to determine the level of genetic differentiation
within and between marine iguana populations and the
following major island groups: north (Pinta, Marchena
and Genovesa), west (Fernandina and Isabela), central
(Santiago, Rábida, Pinzon, Santa Cruz, Floreana and
Santa Fé) and east (Española and San Cristóbal).

We additionally tested for correlation of island age and
molecular distance by applying a Mantel test as implemented in the program ARLEQUIN v3.11 [42]. For this
FST differentiation was estimated by haplotype frequencies
between island populations and the corresponding age
difference between islands was estimated as the difference
of maximum island age as provided by Table 1. The significane of test results were determined by performing
10,000 randomizations.
Population structure based on microsatellite loci data
Using microsatellite data, we employed a Bayesian-based
analysis of population structure in order to identify
genetic clusters, patterns of migration, and gene flow
within Amblyrhynchus without using any a priori sampling
information. Starting from individual genotypes, the

Population localities, sample sizes, island ages, and summary data for 13 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region (CR).
Island ages are in millions of years (myr) and were derived from plate velocity and potassium-argon (KAr) dating estimates from multiple sources [3,17,82,86,87]. Estimates of population sizes
were compiled in [78]. Microsatellite loci data: N, sample size for each population; Nalleles, average number of alleles; Hobs, observed heterozygosity; intra-locus k-test statistic, number of loci
out of 13 loci that showed negative k values and the corresponding p value (specific k values are provided by suppl. table 3). Control Region data: N, sample size for each population; H, number
of haplotypes; Hd, haplotype diversity;, nucleotide diversity; K, average number of nucleotide differences between sequences; FS, Fu's neutrality statistic [51]; D, Tajima's neutrality statistic [52]. For
the complete table: * and ** denote significance at the = 0.05 and = 0.01 levels respectively. Populations were sampled in 1991/1993aand/or 2004b.

number of genetic clusters was inferred using the program
STRUCTURE v2.1 [43]. K (the number of inferred genetic
clusters) ranged from 1 to 25 with 15 iterations for each K.
The run length was set to 100,000 MCMC replicates after
a burn-in period of one million replicates. For the ancestry
model, we chose the admixture model with ALPHA being
inferred from the data in combination with correlated
allele frequencies. Based on the log probability of these
runs, the true value of K was estimated using the approach
of Evanno et al. [44]. The program DISTRUCT [45] was
then used to graphically display the number of genetic
clusters as well as genetic intermixing of individuals based
on the true value of K in STRUCTURE. The program BAPS
v3.2 [46], which uses a slightly different Bayesian
approach than STRUCTURE to infer population differentiation, was also used to identify the optimal number of
genetic clusters. The upper bound for the number of populations was set to the number of sampling locations in
our dataset. This corresponded to 36 different sampling
locations/events when considering different time points
from the same location as independent sampling events.
The optimal number of clusters identified by BAPS3.2 was
selected from a list of the ten best visited partitions
according to their log(ml) values (see [46]). Genotypic
assignment of individuals to populations was tested by
applying an individual-based self-assignment test using
the program GENECLASS2 [47] and the implemented
Bayesian approach of Rannala and Mountain [48].
In order to allow a direct comparison between our results
and those of the Rassmann et al. study [27], we calculated
overall differentiation as Reynolds FST = -ln(1-Θ; [49])
using the program MICROSAT [50]. Analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) was performed for the same sets of
populations and major island groups as done for the
equivalent mitochondrial analysis (see above) in the program ARLEQUIN v3.11 [42].
In order to determine the correlation between island age
vs genetic distance (FST) we used the same approach as
described for the D-loop sequences (see above). The correlation between possible dispersal distance of marine
iguanas vs genetic distance (FST) was tested with a Mantel
test as implemented in the program ARLEQUIN v3.11
[42]. The significane of test results were determined by
performing 10,000 randomizations. Underlying dispersal
distances in the matrix (see Table S1 [see Additional file
1]) were estimated under the assumption that iguanas
from localities on different islands dispersed by drifting in
the ocean, meaning that distances are the closest straight
lines around intervening islands between localities. If
localities were on the same island, the distances were the
closest "coastal" distances - assuming that iguanas dispersed by either swimming or walking along the coast
rather than walking across islands.

Analysis of population expansion
Tests of recent population expansion were conducted on
the combined population samples (i.e. 1991/93 and 2004
samples; see Table 1) for the mitochondrial and microsatellite datasets separately. For CR sequences, we obtained
frequency distributions of pairwise nucleotide differences
between sequences (mismatch distributions), Fu's Fs test
[51], and Tajima's D statistic [52] using ARLEQUIN. Particular focus was placed on marine iguana populations on
the comparatively young islands in the western (Fernandina and western Isabela) and northern (Genovesa,
Marchena, and Pinta) regions of the archipelago, which
may have been host to recent expansions in both range
and population size. Details on methods and parameters
used for these analyses are provided in the additional
material [see Additional file 2].

The distribution of alleles at microsatellite loci were examined for signs of population expansion using the intralocus k test as implemented in the Excel Macro KGTESTS
[53]. Assuming a simple stepwise mutation model, locusspecific allele length distributions from constant-sized
populations should have several modes, whereas a single
mode is expected for expanding populations [54]. The
intra-locus k test examines differences in allele length distributions for specific loci, where a negative k value is
indicative of recent population expansion, as well as
whether the number of negative k values across all loci is
significant [55].
Tests of sex-biased dispersal
Based on the results of the Rassmann et al. study [27] that
indicated male-biased dispersal in marine iguanas, we
performed four different tests of sex-biased dispersal for
sets of adult individuals sampled in 1991/93 and 2004
[56]: i) The FIS statistic describes how well genotype frequencies follow expectations under Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium and assumes that the dispersing sex will be a
mixture of residents and immigrants resulting in a heterozygote deficiency and a positive FIS value; ii) FST values
should be lower for the dispersing sex because allele frequencies of the dispersing sex should be more similar
across populations; iii) Immigrants tend to have a lower
Assignment Index (AI; see [57] and [58] for details) than
residents. Therefore, the dispersing sex should display, on
average, a lower value of AI than the resident sex; iv) Since
members of the dispersing sex will include both residents
(with common genotypes) and immigrants (with rare
genotypes), the variance of AI should be larger for the dispersing sex than for the resident sex. All tests were run in
the program FSTAT version 2.9.3.2 [59] and the significance of different test results were determined by performing 10,000 randomizations.

Results
CR-based phylogenetic analysis and clade distribution
Complete mtDNA CR sequences were obtained for 1203
marine iguanas and contained 1183 bp, or 1179 bp when
positions with insertions/deletions (indels) were removed
as they did not provide significant information and would
have extremly limited important applications within the
program DNASP (the dataset with gaps can be obtained
from SS or SG upon request). D-loop haplotypes have
been deposited in GeneBank under accession numbers
GQ293462-GQ293497 and EU278255-EU278326 and
detailed information on haplotypes (e.g. island and clade
designation) is provided by Table S2 [see Additional file
3]. The resulting alignment contained 106 haplotypes
with a pairwise uncorrected sequence divergence of 1.6%
between the most distant haplotypes. Thirty-five of these
haplotypes were singletons.

The topologies of trees generated by the MRBAYES (Figure
1a) and BEAST (data not shown) software were very similar and resulted in three general clades -designated A, B,
and C - that were supported by high posterior probability
values (PPV > 0.95). Under the relaxed clock model, Bayesian-based analysis in the software BEAST placed clade B
as the basal group in the phylogeny. Many islands possessed haplotypes from multiple clades (Figure 1a and
Figure 2). Clade A (PPV = 1) possessed the fewest haplotypes (h = 7) and was widely distributed across the archipelago; clade B (PPV = 1) contained 30 haplotypes that
were found mostly on the central and eastern islands, but
also on southern Isabela (IBA and IWE); clade C (PPV =
0.96) accounted for the majority of haplotypes (h = 69)
and occurred on the northern (Pinta, Marchena, and Genovesa) and western (Fernandina and Isabela) islands as
well as on the two central islands of Floreana and Rábida
at low frequency. The average pairwise divergence within
each of the three clades was low (~0.4%; Table S3a [see
Additional file 4]) while the maximum divergence was
apparently slightly higher in clade B (1.0%) than for the
other two groups (0.8%). The average percent distance
between clades ranged from 1.0 - 1.3% (Table S3b [see
Additional file 4]).
CR haplotype relationships and distribution
Statistical parsimony networks were constructed separately for each of the three clades. In clade A, haplotype
H5 was the only variant that was widespread and found
on multiple islands, including San Cristóbal to the southeast, Marchena to the north, and Santiago in the central
archipelago (Figure 2). One clade A haplotype (H4) was
also found on northern Isabela (IPA), showing that this
lineage extends to the far west. In clade B, some haplotypes (e.g. H8, H15) were widespread across several of the
eastern and central islands while others (e.g. H9-H12 on
Española) formed groups that clustered within specific
islands. Members of clade B were generally restricted to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/297

the eastern and central islands, except that the majority of
southern Isabela haplotypes were also part of this clade. In
addition, a clade B haplotype (H23) was identified from a
single individual in the far western FPM population on
Fernandina. Haplotypes from the island of Floreana
appeared at several disjunct places in the network.
For clade C a high degree of reticulation was observed in
the network. As a result, the complete network could not
be represented in a clear fashion, and singleton individuals (N = 26) were removed from the statistical parsimony
analysis to simplify the general phylogeographic patterns.
The majority of clade C haplotypes were limited to the far
western (Fernandina and western Isabela) and northern
(Pinta, Marchena, and Genovesa) regions of the archipelago, although two clade C haplotypes, H60 and H106,
were also found on two central islands, Floreana and Rábida.
Population genetic diversity and differentiation based on
CR data
Many populations from the west (i.e. Fernandina and
western Isabela) showed high levels of genetic diversity
(Hd > 0.900; Table 1). Conversely, a number of populations from the north, east, and central regions had particularly low levels of variation, many containing three
haplotypes or less. The variation was particularly low on
Santa Cruz, where 115 of the 116 individuals sampled
shared the same CR haplotype.

The analysis of genetic structure (Table 2) showed that
populations from the older central/eastern islands were
highly differentiated from those in the north (FST= 0.74)
and west (FST= 0.70). There was also significant structure
between northern and western islands, but to a lesser
degree (FST= 0.42). Within regions, genetic distinctiveness
among populations was much greater in the eastern/central archipelago (FST= 0.55) than in the north (FST= 0.18)
or west (FST= 0.09). However, some eastern/central
islands (e.g. Santa Fé, Española) contained many individuals that shared haplotypes with populations from other
islands (see Figure 1b). The most striking separation of
marine iguana populations in the east/central region was
observed on opposite ends of San Cristóbal island (FST=
0.87); a result of the fact that haplotypes from these populations are from two different clades (Figure 1b; Figure
2). The results of the AMOVA, in which populations were
grouped into northern, eastern/central, and western
regions, showed that variation was similarly partitioned
among groups (40.1%), among populations within
groups (31.2%), and within populations (28.7%). These
results were further supported by the fact that mitochondrial differentiation between island populations correlated with island age (r = 0.45; p = 0.004) and could
explain 20% of the observed variation.

circle sizes reflect the number of individuals. In order of increasing area, this corresponds to 1-6, 7-20, 21-50, and 50 or more
individuals. All singletons were removed from populations on Fernandina and western Isabela in order to more clearly display
the overall phylogeographic patterns. Island distribution of each haplotype is indicated by color according to the embedded legend.
Microsatellite loci dependent population structure and
gene flow
Table 1 shows the average number of alleles and observed
heterozygosity of each population that was genotyped for
thirteen microsatellite loci. Complete genotypic data was
obtained for 1225 individuals from 23 sampling locations
as well as from different time points for the same island
(see Table 1 for details). Applying the approach of Evanno
et al. [44], the most likely number of genetic clusters for
the complete dataset based on the results of STRUCTURE
was estimated at 20 (see Figure 3 and Figure S1 [see Additional file 5]). The individual-based Bayesian structure
analysis using BAPS indicated the same number of genetic
clusters (see Table S4 [see Additional file 6]).

We found different patterns of genetic differentiation
across the archipelago. Individuals sampled at different
time points (i.e. 1991/93 and 2004) from the northern
(Pinta, Marchena, Genovesa), central (Santiago, Santa Fé,

Santa Cruz) and one of the eastern (Española) islands
each form a single island-specific genetic cluster with a
low degree of intermixing with genetic clusters from other
islands. On the other easternmost island of San Cristóbal,
two highly distinct genetic clusters were found corresponding to the western (SRL) and eastern (SRP) populations. The strong genetic differentiation among these
islands (as well as among populations within islands in
the case of San Cristóbal) was further supported by the
results of the individual-based self-assignment test. Proportions of individuals correctly assigned to these island
populations ranged from 96-100% indicating low levels
of gene flow between islands (Table 3). Gene flow from
Española to Floreana was indicated by 12% of individuals
sampled on Floreana, but incorrectly assigning to
Española. The smaller islands such as Pinzon and Rábida
show signatures of genetic exchange with the larger
islands of Fernandina and Isabela/Santiago, respectively
(see Table 3).

In contrast, STRUCTURE analysis (Figure 3a) showed that
individuals sampled on Fernandina and Isabela are genetically similar, with populations on both islands showing
a high degree of genetic mixing. The population from
Punta Albermarle (IPA) in northern Isabela was an exception since it was genetically differentiated from the
remaining populations on Fernandina and Isabela. Also,
the self-assignment analysis indicated high levels of gene
flow between these two islands as all of the incorrectly
assigned individuals on Fernandina (18%) were from Isabela and nearly all incorrectly assigned individuals on Isabela (30%) were from Fernandina (Table 3). Importantly,
the nine distinct genetic clusters recovered by our analyses
on Fernandina and Isabela are mostly absent from the
remaining islands of the archipelago (Figure 3b).
The average FST values between the 16 populations sampled in 1991/93 and the 18 populations sampled in 2004
were quite similar (0.13 ± 0.057 and to 0.12 ± 0.051,
mean ± SD, respectively). Within-island FST differentiation
ranged from 0 (on Fernandina) to 0.11 (on San Cristóbal)
and FST between islands from the same region ranged
from 0.01 (west) to 0.13 (north). Differentiation between
geographic regions was low, ranging from 0.1 (East/Central vs. West) to 0.14 (North vs. East/Central) (see Table
2). In line with these results, the AMOVA analysis revealed
that only 3% of the variation was partitioned between
geographic groups, 8% among populations within geographic groups, and 89% within populations. Also, no
evidence for a relationship between island age and genetic

and 13 microsatellite loci (FST values).
Only islands with multiple samples could be used to examine withinisland differentiation. The two populations from southeastern Isabela
(IBA and IWE) were included in the east/central since they show a
higher genetic affinity to those islands. Standard deviations represent
the mean over all pairwise comparisons.

distance was found on the basis of microsatellite loci (r =
0.14; p = 0.25). A slight (r = 0.26), but highly significantly
(p = 0.001) correlation between possible dispersal distances and genetic distance was found that could explain
7% of the observed variation between matrices (see also
Figure S2 [see Additional file 7] for corresponding scatter
plots).
Analysis of population expansion
For the mtDNA dataset, both the western and northern
populations conformed to the model of sudden-expansion (p > 0.05; Figure S3a,b [see Additional file 8]), which
was further supported by low raggedness values (p >
0.05). However, only the west showed a clear unimodal
mismatch pattern which is suggestive of recent population
expansion (Figure S3a-d [see Additional file 8]). Also,
highly negative FS values (p < 0.05) were obtained for two
sites on Fernandina (FPE and FPM) and for one site on
western Isabela (ICB), indicating an excess of recent mutations in these populations due to population growth (see
Table 1). Of these three sites, only FPM was also significant for Tajima's D neutrality test (p = 0.04), but with a
much weaker signal than for the FS test. In addition, when
all the western populations were combined, FS values were
negative and significant (FS = -25.729; p = 0.00), but D values were not (D = -1.144; p = 0.11).

Intra-locus k-test statistics based on microsatellites
showed evidence of significant recent population expansion for only two populations. Ten out of thirteen loci
(Table 1 and Table S5 [see Additional file 9]) showed negative k values that are indicative of recent population
expansion for the FPM site on Fernandina and the Saint
James Bay (SJB) site on Santiago.
Analysis of sex-biased dispersal
Table 4 provides the results of the four different test statistics for sex-biased dispersal for marine iguana individuals
sampled in 1991/93 and 2004. Although some of the test
results are slightly different for females and males sampled in 1991/93 and 2004, none showed significant evidence of detectable genetic consequences from potentially
sex-biased dispersal in marine iguanas.

Discussion
Do marine iguanas follow the progression hypothesis?
Genetic studies have revealed that many species in the
Galápagos follow the progression hypothesis, where
islands are colonized in order of their emergence
(reviewed in [2]). This pattern has been attributed to the
relative ease in which migrating individuals can successfully occupy younger, uninhabited islands in comparison
to older ones, where populations have already been established [18]. The progression hypothesis appears most supported by poorly dispersing species such as giant tortoises

Results of the self-assignment test of 1225 Galápagos marine iguana samples using the approach of Rannala and Mountain [48] as implemented in the
program GENECLASS2 [47]. Proportion of "correctly" assigned individuals includes individuals that were assigned to their island of origin
irrespective of the sampling period (i.e. sampled in 1991/93 or 2004; see Material and Methods for details), whereas the second column gives the
proportion of individuals assigned to islands other than the island of origin.

[60,61], lava lizards [62,63], land snails [7], and Galápagos land iguanas [64,65] since the probability of back
migration to older islands is low. Conversely, the phylogeographic patterns of more mobile organisms such as
Darwin finches ([1]; but see [4]), insects (e.g. weevils;
[10]), sea lions [66] and hawks [67] do not always conform to the geologic history of the islands. In the case of
Galápagos sea lions and hawks genetic data suggest that
population structure was established and affected by quite
different factors after a rapid population expansion across
the whole archipelago: sea lions diverged according to
ecological differences in a western and eastern clade [66],
whereas an island-dependent population structure due to
limited dispersal between islands was found for the
Galápagos hawks [67].
Galápagos marine iguanas feed exclusively on aquatic
algae and are closely tied to the coastal environment
throughout their lives [20,68,69]. Large individuals are
even known to forage offshore in the subtidal zone, swimming up to several hundred meters to reach feeding sites
[20]. It is therefore reasonable to expect that these animals
can disperse easily - either actively or passively - and that
their evolutionary history should not conform to the progression hypothesis.
On a broad scale, the current study provides evidence that
the progression hypothesis appears to hold true for
marine iguanas. Our CR analyses, as well as the previously
published cytb study [27], suggest that clade B may be
basal to clades A and C (Figure 1a). Biogeographically,

this makes sense since clade B is found almost exclusively
on the eastern and central islands (Figure 1b) that are considered to be the oldest in the archipelago. Meanwhile, the
majority of clade C haplotypes was identified on younger
islands in the north and west. The basal position of clade
B would be made stronger if Galápagos land iguanas - the
acknowledged sister species of marine iguanas -could be
used as an outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. However,
when this was attempted using Bayesian-based phylogenetic inference, independent runs failed to converge after
1 × 107 generations. This outcome is likely due to the large
divergence between marine and land iguana CR
sequences (approximately 10%) compared to the low
divergence within marine iguanas (max. 1.6%), reflecting
the long timeframe in which the two species have independently evolved on both existing and submerged
islands.
Due to the difficulty in rooting the marine iguana phylogeny with CR data, frequency-based genetic information
provides important additional support for the progression
hypothesis at the large scale. The genetic division between
populations from the eastern/central archipelago and
those from the northern and western islands was evident
in the CR haplotype frequencies, which showed high levels of differentiation as expressed by rather high FST-values
between regions (see Table 2). FST differentiation based on
microsatellite loci for corresponding comparisons is
much lower (Table 2) and not in line with the mitochondrial data.

One consequence of the progression hypothesis is that
levels of genetic structure are higher among populations
on older islands since these are more likely to be at equilibrium and to have undergone significant lineage sorting.
For example, in Galápagos tortoises, mitochondrial haplotypes are largely endemic to specific islands in the eastern archipelago while those in the west are often shared
between populations and depict an intricate history of
genetic exchange [60,61]. A qualitatively similar pattern is
also seen for marine iguanas. Mitochondrial CR differentiation was much higher between populations from the
older eastern/central archipelago than among the younger
western and northern islands. Moreover, levels of genetic
differentiation among populations on the youngest
(~35,000-535,000 years) and westernmost islands of
Fernandina and Isabela were not significantly different
from 0 (see Table 2).
There are some exceptions to the general east/west division of marine iguanas in the archipelago that are evident
from the CR data. While clade B haplotypes did predominate in the eastern/central region in our study, they were
also in the majority on southeastern Isabela, suggesting
that this part of the island is biogeographically more connected to the east/central archipelago than to the west. In
addition, a single clade B haplotype (H23) was also found
on the far-western island of Fernandina, demonstrating
the potential for rare long-distance dispersal from the east.
Similarly, haplotypes from clade C, which were previously
shown to be restricted to the north and west, were also
identified on two of the central islands, Floreana and Rábida. A unique clade A haplotype was also identified on
northern Isabela, showing that this lineage extends across
the entire northern archipelago. The ancestral haplotype
in this clade (H5) was widely distributed, existing on San
Cristóbal to the east, and Santiago and Marchena in the
north-central archipelago. Since San Cristóbal is one of
the two oldest islands in the Galápagos, clade A likely
radiated from there to the north and west, all the way to
the northern tip of Isabela. This fits well with the patterns
of island age as well as the path of the prevailing Hum-

boldt current which approaches the archipelago from a
southeasterly direction [70] and is thought to have produced similar east to west colonization patterns in other
Galápagos organisms [2,63].
While the progression hypothesis generally explains the
overall east/west division of marine iguanas, dispersal patterns have produced a more complicated history within
regions. Unlike tortoises and other Galápagos organisms
that exhibit complete genetic structuring among older
populations, many marine iguana CR haplotypes are
shared between different islands in the eastern/central
region (Figure 1b and Figure 2). For example, more than
half of the marine iguanas sampled on Santa Fé have CR
haplotypes in common with individuals from other
islands. In addition, the statistical parsimony analysis
(Figure 2) shows that haplotypes restricted to several of
the older islands in the eastern archipelago (e.g. Española
and Santa Fé) are connected to other eastern/central
island haplotypes via haplotypes from younger central
islands (e.g. Pinzón, Isabela), suggesting that migration
routes have not proceeded strictly according to the age of
island emergence. The appearance of Floreana haplotypes
throughout the network shows that this island has been
subject to continual genetic exchange with other islands.
Microsatellite loci based population structure - evidence
for sex-biased dispersal in marine iguanas?
Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite loci genotypes
shows that most marine iguanas belong to highly distinct
genetic island clusters (Figure 3). This result was independently supported by the high assignment rate of individuals to their island of origin for the majority of islands
(Table 3). The Bayesian cluster analysis is especially convincing for two reasons. First, individuals sampled at different time points (i.e. in 1991/93 and 2004) but at the
same sampling location were grouped together as one
genetic unit. Second, the same number of genetic clusters
was obtained by two different Bayesian clustering methods (STRUCTURE and BAPS). The microsatellite loci data
therefore suggest that the structuring of marine iguana

populations generally follows a pattern of one genetic
unit per island. A similar pattern was also recently demonstrated for Galápagos lava lizards from the genus Microlophus [71].
Based on FSTanalyses of nuclear genetic data, high levels of
gene flow between islands and populations were reported
[27]. The overall FST was approximately 0.1 for the 22
marine iguana populations examined. Although the average FST differentiation found in our study was in the same
range (FST= 0.13 and FST= 0.12, respectively, for 1991/93
and 2004 samplings), the high level of genetic differentiation between islands indicated by Bayesian cluster analyses suggests that recent gene flow has been limited, and
consequently that FST values may provide little information about fine scale population structure (see reviews
[72,73]). Another issue of microsatellite-based FST estimates is the underestimation of genetic structure due to
allele size homoplasy. Such a pattern may result from the
characteristically high mutation rates and allelic polymorphism of microsatellite loci and may diminish the
observed genetic distance (reviewed in [74]). As an example, when microsatellite loci and sequences of the nuclear
coded internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) were analysed in
the coral species Corallium rubrum across the western Mediterranean, ITS-1 sequences revealed significant genetic
structure between different geographic regions while microsatellite loci failed to show any correlation between FSTbased estimates for geographic distances ranging from 302650 km [75]. In another study in the same organism,
however, very fine scale structuring based on microsatellites was observed for distances of ten meters to one km
[76] indicating that spatial genetic structure does exists in
this system but may not be detectable using microsatellite-based FST estimates over large distances and/or time
frames.
Since the study of Rassmann et al. found significant differentiation between islands and regions based on maternally inherited mtDNA markers but not on bi-parentally
inherited nuclear microsatellite and minisatellite loci,
they concluded that male-mediated dispersal and gene
flow was likely responsible for this discrepancy [27]. Support for this hypothesis came from frequent field observations in which male marine iguanas have been observed
to swim to different islands during the breeding season apparently to establish breeding territories (e.g. Santa
Cruz and Caamaño; [77]). After the breeding season they
return to the larger island where they "live". On the other
hand females have been observed swimming to some
islands (e.g. Plaza Sur, Plaza Norte and "Devine's Bay" in
Academy Bay) during the breeding season and returned to
their resident island after oviposition (unpublished data).
In our study none of the four tests conducted showed significant evidence for sex-biased dispersal in marine igua-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/297

nas (Table 4). Since the set of individuals analyzed in the
Rassman et al. study [27] for three microsatellite loci corresponds to the 1991/93 samples analyzed for thirteen
microsatellite loci in our study, it was possible to directly
compare of FST-based test statistics between the two studies. In the former study [27] males displayed a significantly lower FST-value (FST= 0.09) than females (FST=
0.12) suggesting that males disperse more than females.
Conversely, FST estimates for the same set of males and
females, which were genotyped at thirteen microsatellite
loci, were not significantly different (males, FST = 0.115;
females, FST= 0.117; p = 0.35; Table 4). For individuals
sampled in 2004, we even found higher FST values for
males (FST= 0.129) than for females (FST= 0.106), but also
non-significant (p = 0.82). These findings suggest that the
results of the Rassman et al. study [27], which were based
only on three microsatellite loci, should be approached
cautiously. Since sex bias has to be intense to be detected
by any of the applied test statistics [56], we cannot rule
out that such a bias might exist in the case of single dispersers. However, we can exclude that this is a major
demographic characteristic of marine iguana populations,
as previously suggested.
Beyond the results of the sex-biased dispersal tests, the
observed genetic patterns make high dispersal rates in
marine iguanas unlikely. Bayesian-based population
structure analysis (Figure 3) indicates that, except in a few
cases (e.g. Isabela and Fernandina), recent migration and
gene flow between islands is low. The fact that we recovered separate genetic units in the west (location SRL) and
east (location SRP) on San Cristóbal (also supported by
the mitochondrial data; see Figure 1b; Figure 2) as well as
detected population structure between populations on
Isabela (IPA versus the rest of the Isabela; see Figure 3b)
indicates that gene flow of marine iguanas can be limited
even along the coasts of the same island. These findings
are not in line with expectations of high male-mediated
gene flow [27].
Evolution of high genetic diversity on Isabela and
Fernandina
Marine iguana populations on the westernmost islands of
Isabela and Fernandina are among the largest in the
Galápagos, with Fernandina alone numbering in the hundreds of thousands [78]. Individuals from these populations are also the largest in the archipelago with a
maximum body mass of 12 kg for individuals in southwestern Isabela [79]. Both large population size and individual body size have been attributed to the high marine
productivity generated by upwelling of the nutrient-rich
Cromwell current along the western archipelago [19,80].
The same region also harbors nearly 95% of the overall
Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) population
[81].

The western marine iguana populations also possess a
high level of genetic diversity for both mitochondrial and
microsatellite data, even though they occur on the two
most recently emerged islands. The emergence age of the
oldest volcano on Isabela is less than 535,000 years, while
the emergence age of Fernandina is estimated to be only
35,000 years [82]. In contrast, central and southern
islands of the archipelago are 1-4 million years old. Sixtyseven out of the total 106 mitochondrial control region
haploytypes are found on Fernandina and Isabela with 65
haplotypes being distinct to these islands (Figure 1 and
Figure 2) resulting in high levels of haplotype diversity. In
contrast populations on the other islands showed significantly fewer haplotypes and lower levels of haplotype
diversity. Also, at the level of microsatellite loci, up to nine
different genetic clusters were detected for Fernandina and
Isabela (Figure 3b), whereas a single predominant cluster
is found in populations from most other islands. These
genetic clusters are unique to the Isabela and Fernandina
populations and therefore must have recently evolved on
these islands.
On a broad scale across all islands mitochondrial as well
as nuclear diversity indices did not correlate with island
size (i.e. island perimeter; (see Figure S4 [see Additional
file 10]). The most obvious explanation for the higher
level of genetic diversity on the younger islands is that
large population sizes along with recent population
growth have resulted in many new mutations combined
with decreased effects of genetic drift. Indeed, western
populations on Isabela and Fernandina show clear signs
of sudden-expansion based on mtDNA data as evidenced
by a clear unimodal mismatch pattern (Figure S3 [see
Additional file 8]) and highly negative FS values for Punta
Espinosa and Punta Mangle on Fernandina (see Table 1)
indicating an excess of recent mutations. The microsatellite loci-based k-test statistic showed significant support
for recent population expansion for the Punta Mangle
population on Fernandina (Table 1 and Table S5 [see
Additional file 9]), but not for any of the other western
populations.
However, the analysis of CR haplotypes also shows that
western marine iguana populations possess mtDNA haplotypes typical of some central, northern, and southern
populations. This variation could have been introduced
into the western populations through founder events
from multiple sources. An increased variation within populations due to multiple recent colonizations has been
shown for the invasive brown anolis (Anolis sagrei; [83]. In
this respect, the finding that mitochondrial CR haplotypes
of marine iguanas from southern Isabela are connected to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/297

haploytypes typical of the central islands (Santa Cruz and
Floreana) - a similar picture that is seen also in Galápagos
tortoises [60,84,85] - underpins the colonization of Isabela from multiple sources. In the land iguana C. subcristatus, mitochondrial DNA sequence data indicate a single
founder event of western islands from a single source
located in the central islands [65]. Subsequently C. subcristatus seems to have dispersed in a south to north direction on Isabela. However, the occurrence of an old
separate lineage on Isabela (now recognized as a separate
species; [65]) indicates that land iguanas have colonized
Isabela at least twice.

Conclusions
This comprehensive analysis of the population structure
of Galápagos marine iguanas both supports and transforms our previous knowledge about the microevolution
of this unique species. The detailed mtDNA analyses trace
back migration routes in the evolutionary past and suggest
that colonization of islands progressed from geologically
older to younger islands in the archipelago. The existence
of highly differentiated genetic clusters among islands as
well as no specific support for sex-biased dispersal conflict
with the previously held view of high male gene flow
among islands. More generally, our study demonstrates
how the development of recent analytical tools such as
Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequence-based
demographic analyses allow us to tease apart the role of
past and present gene flow in shaping current patterns of
population differentiation.
