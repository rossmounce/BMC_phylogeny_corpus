Abstract
Background: The diagnosis of late onset breast cancer in a father, mother, and daughter living in
the same house for decades suggested the possibility of an environmental agent as a common
etiological factor. Both molecular and epidemiological data have indicated a possible role for the
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), the etiological agent of breast cancer in mice, in a certain
percentage of human breast tumors. The aim of this study was to determine if MMTV might be
involved in the breast cancer of this cluster of three family members.
Results: MMTV-like envelope (env) and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences containing the
MMTV superantigen gene (sag) were detected in the malignant tissues of all three family members.
The amplified env gene sequences were 98.0%–99.6% homologous to the MMTV env sequences
found in the GR, C3H, and BR6 mouse strains. The amplified LTR sequences containing sag
sequences segregated to specific branches of the MMTV phylogenetic tree and did not form a
distinct branch of their own.
Conclusion: The presence of MMTV-like DNA sequences in the malignant tissues of all three
family members suggests the possibility of MMTV as an etiological agent. Phylogenetic data suggest
that the MMTV-like DNA sequences are mouse and not human derived and that the ultimate
reservoir of MMTV is most likely the mouse. Although the route by which these family members
came to be infected with MMTV is unknown, the possibility exists that such infection may have
resulted from a shared exposure to mice.

Background
Three members of the same family, father, mother, and
daughter, were diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast
with axillary nodal metastases. The father was the first to
be diagnosed at the age of 79 in 1963. The mother and
daughter were each diagnosed six years later in 1969 at the
ages of 82 and 56 respectively. All three family members
had invasive carcinoma as shown in Figure 1. Published
data from five laboratories including our own have shown

an association of the betaretrovirus mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV) with a certain percentage of human
breast tumors [1-5]. In addition we identified MMTV-like
DNA sequences in both breast tumor tissue and nonHodgkin's lymphoma tissue of eight patients diagnosed
with both diseases and in the lymphoma tissue of three
patients diagnosed with only non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
[6]. We and others have not detected MMTV in normal
human tissue [1,6,7]. In mice MMTV is the etiological

agent responsible for the development of breast tumors as
well as certain B-and T-cell lymphomas [8-10]. In this
study we investigated the presence of MMTV-like DNA
sequences in three family members each of whom had
been diagnosed with breast cancer. We have detected the
presence of both the MMTV-like envelope (env) and long
terminal repeat (LTR) gene sequences in all three patients.

members. Samples blocks from mother and daughter contained malignant tissue from their respective breast
tumors. Sample blocks from the father were from a lymph
node that contained metastatic breast cancer.

Presence of MMTV-like env sequences in breast cancer
DNA from malignant tissue of each family member was
amplified using single round PCR with primers specific
for a 250 basepair (bp) region of the MMTV env gene and
not found in any human endogenous retroviral sequences
i.e HERV-Ks [1,4,11,12]. Figure 2A represents the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis of an
MMTV env primed PCR from each of the three family
members and 2B is the hybridized Southern blot [13].
Lanes 2, 3, and 4 in both Figure 2A and 2B represent the
amplified DNA from the daughter, mother, and father
respectively. Lane 1 containing no template DNA and
lanes 5, 6, and 7 containing normal breast tissue DNA
from three separate individuals represent negative controls for sample contamination. Positive hybridization
results with the radiolabled internal 23-mer oligonucleotide probe that contained MMTV-env gene sequences

indicated that this MMTV-specific sequence was present in
the amplified 250-bp fragment and that the bands in the
agarose gel were MMTV specific.
Presence of MMTV-like LTR sequences in breast cancer
DNA from the three afflicted family members was amplified by single round PCR with primers specific for a 630bp region within the MMTV LTR open reading frame
(ORF) that codes for the MMTV superantigen (sag) gene
[14,15] and that is not present in HERV-K sequences
[6,11,12,16]. Figure 2C represents the ethidium bromidestained agarose gel electrophoresis of the MMTV LTR
primed PCR of the three family members and Figure 2D
represents the hybridized Southern blot [13]. Lanes 2, 3,
and 4 in both Figure 2C and 2D represent amplified DNA
from the mother, daughter, and father respectively. Lane 1
containing no template DNA and lanes 5, 6, and 7 containing normal breast tissue DNA from three separate
individuals represent our negative controls for sample
contamination. Positive hybridization with the radiolabeled internal 20-bp oligonucleotide probe that contained MMTV-LTR gene sequences indicated that this
MMTV-specific sequence was present in the amplified
630-bp fragment and that the bands in the agarose gel
were specific for MMTV LTR sequences.
Cloning and sequencing of amplified MMTV-like env from
human breast cancer
The amplified MMTV env gene-specific 250-bp sequences
present in the primary and metastatic breast tumor tissue
were cloned using the Invitrogen TOPO TA Cloning kit for
Sequencing. A total of 12 clones (4 for each family member) were sequenced. The sequences of the 12 amplified
fragments were shown to be 98.0% – 99.6 percent homologous to the GR, C3H and BR6 mouse strains of MMTV in
this 250-bp region of the MMTV env gene. Figure 3 shows
the comparison of the sequences of the 12 clones to the
three strains of MMTV [17-19] and to each other in this
region of the MMTV env gene.

As shown in Figure 3 the sequenced env clones fell into 7
classes that differed from one another. However no one
env clone differed from any other by more than 4 base
changes either within the same family member or
between family members. One env clone each from the
mother (M1), father (F2), and daughter (D2) were identical to each other. Two env clones from the father (F3, F4)
were identical to each other, one daughter env clone (D1)
and one father env clone (F1) were the same, and two env
clones from the mother (M2, M3) were the same. Each
family member however, mother (M1, M4), father (F2,
F3, F4), and daughter (D2, D3), each contained env clones
that included a single base change mutation denoted by
the arrow in Figure 3. Each family member also contained
env clones (M2, M3, F1, D1, D4) without this single base

change. Previously we had identified an identical single
base change in the MMTV env sequences that were present
in a number of breast tumors and all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [6].
Cloning and sequencing of amplified MMTV-like LTR ORF
sequences from human breast cancer
The amplified 630 bp MMTV-like LTR ORF sequences
present in the primary and metastatic breast tumor tissue
were cloned using the Invitrogen TOPO TA Cloning kit for
Sequencing. A total of 12 clones (4 for each family member) were sequenced. The U3 region of the MMTV LTR
contains the open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the
glycoprotein superantigen (sag) that is present in all exogenous and endogenous MMTV viral sequences [14,15].
Although highly conserved, the MMTV sag sequences are
not identical with approximately 35% of the total variation clustered at the hypervariable COOH terminus. This
variation present in the COOH terminus of the MMTV sag
gene is specific to each MMTV provirus.

In the conserved regions of the LTR ORF all 12 clones
shared 96–98 percent homology with numerous strains of
MMTV and with each other. However, within the highly
variable COOH terminus of the sag gene all of the 12 isolated clones were either identical or nearly identical to
either the MMTV proviral sequence Mtv-8 [20,21] or Mtv1 [22,23] as shown in Figure 4. Each of the three family
members contained COOH-terminal sag sequences that
were identical or nearly identical (one or two base differences) to one of these two proviral sequences.
To analyze relationships between viral strains, phylogenetic trees have been constructed on the basis of alignments of LTR ORF sequences [24]. Phylogenetic analysis
of the entire 630 bp LTR ORF sequences isolated from
each of the three family members diagnosed with breast
cancer is shown in Figure 5. All 12 of the human MMTVlike LTR ORF sag clones segregated to two branches of the
MMTV phylogenetic tree, Mtv-8 [20,21] and Mtv-1
[22,23], and did not form a branch of their own. Moreover, clones isolated from the same family member segregated to these two separate branches. Interestingly, all of
the prior MMTV-like LTR isolates from breast cancer
[6,16,25], non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [5], and primary
biliary cirrhosis [26,27] patients also associated with these
two branches of the MMTV phylogenetic tree.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of breast cancer
in father, mother, and daughter. We acknowledge however limitations of our study due to the quality of the DNA
of the archival formalin fixed paraffin samples on which
this study is based. Limitations include our inability to
determine the mutation status of the BRCA1 and BRCA2

genes in these patients [28]. However the late age at which
these breast tumors developed argues against their being
caused by mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
Quantity and quality of the archival DNA also limited us
in that we were able to successfully amplify only parts of
two regions, the env and LTR, of the MMTV-like DNA
genome and were not able to detect the presence of integrated MMTV-like viral sequences in the cellular genome.
Breast cancer in husband and wife may not be as uncommon as generally thought. At least ten couples have been
previously reported since 1975 [29-33]. Russ and Scanlon
[31] reporting on eleven married couples having histologically identical neoplasms, including three couples with
breast cancer, noted that the clinical course of the disease
tended to be similar in both husband and wife, and that
husband and wife were diagnosed usually within approximately five years of each other. Both observations apply
to our family. Some studies however have not shown an
increased incidence of breast cancer in wives of men with
that neoplasm [33-35]. However, Russ and Scanlon noted
that the tumors they observed in husband and wife have
been suggested either experimentally or indirectly to have
viral relationships [31]. Lynch et al [36] suggested more
than twenty years ago that a communicable agent might
play a role in the clustering of certain cancers in spouses.
The MMTV-like env sequences that we have detected in the
mother, father, and daughter of this family are 98–99.6
percent identical to the GR, C3H and BR6 mouse strains
of MMTV [17-19]. Recently the Env protein of MMTV
from the mouse has been shown to be capable of transforming mouse and human mammary epithelial cells in
vitro [37]. The MMTV Env protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) sequence
that appears to allow for its transformation ability [37].
The MMTV-like env gene sequences that we have isolated
from the primary human breast tumor tissue and the metastatic breast tumor tissue present in a lymph node in the
three family members studied in this report and in additional breast tumors previously reported and in nonHodgkin's lymphomas contain this ITAM sequence [1,6].
It is not yet known if the MMTV-like Env protein coded for
by the MMTV-like DNA sequences which we and others
have detected in human breast tumors is capable of transformation. We have sequenced 4 env clones per family
member for a total of 12 env clones. Seven of these 12
clones contain an identical single base substitution (Figure 3, ↓) that we have detected in a number of additional
breast tumors and in all the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas
we have analyzed. This base change of a G to A results in
the replacement of an alanine (GCA) with a threonine
(ACA) in these samples. Curiously, this single-base
change occurs within the ITAM domain [37].

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/3/1/2

The 630 bp MMTV-like DNA that we have amplified using
primers specific for regions of the ORF of the MMTV LTR
codes for the superantigen (sag) gene of MMTV [14,15].
Although highly conserved, the MMTV sag sequences are
not identical with approximately 35 percent of the total
variation clustered at the hypervariable COOH terminus.
This variation present at the COOH terminus of the
MMTV sag gene is specific to each MMTV strain. Each of
our cloned sag sequences from each family member was
identical or nearly identical to either the MMTV Mtv-8
[20,21] or Mtv-1 [22,23] proviral sequence. In a previous
publication [6] we have shown that the cloned sag
sequences present in both the breast tumor tissue and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tissue of eight patients diagnosed with both malignancies also contained sag
sequences that were identical or nearly identical to MMTV
proviral sequences Mtv-1 and Mtv-8. Similar sequences
isolated from human breast tumors by others also contained sag sequences with identity to the Mtv-1 and Mtv-8
proviral sequences [16,25]. Also, MMTV-like sag
sequences isolated from patients diagnosed with primary
biliary cirrhosis (PBC) also contained sag sequences with
identity to the Mtv-1 and Mtv-8 proviral sequences
[26,27]. Phylogenetic studies from our laboratory and
that of others [27] have shown that such sequences segregate to specific branches of the MMTV phylogenetic tree
and do not form a distinct branch of their own thus arguing for their being mouse derived and not human homologues of the mouse sequence [6,27]. This study, our
previously published work [6], and that of others [26,27]
also indicate that more than one viral strain of MMTV-like
DNA sequences may be present in the same individual.
Other works that have shown that MMTV-like DNA
sequences are for the most part not found in normal cells
[1-7,25] suggest that the presence of the virus in humans
may result from an exogenous infection. Very recently, a
virus closely related to the xenotropic murine leukemia
viruses (MuLVs) has been detected in the tumor tissue of
a certain population of prostate cancer patients. The viral
sequence is not found in human genomic DNA thus indicating, as the authors discuss, an exogenous infection
[38,39]. The suggestion that MMTV exogenous infection
can occur in humans is a highly controversial topic but is
becoming more plausible with two recent publications by
Indik et al [40,41]. In these papers the authors show that
MMTV can infect human cells in vitro, make new MMTV,
and that this new MMTV can go on to infect other human
cells. That the MMTV-like DNA sequences that we and
others have found in human breast tumors may be mouse
derived is also suggested by the findings that their sag
sequences segregate to arms of the MMTV phylogenetic
tree and do not form a separate branch of their own
[6,26,27]. Additional epidemiological findings suggesting
an exogenous infection from mice include the findings of

Stewart et al [42] in which it was shown that the incidence
of breast cancer was highest in countries in which the
mouse strain mus domesticus resides, a mouse strain that
carries a large number of endogenous MMTV proviruses.
Curiously, a recent study from the Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine and Public Health has reported
that airborne mouse allergen was found in 84 percent of
bedrooms of inner city homes in Baltimore and that the
concentration of this mouse allergen may be similar to
those found in animal facilities [43]. We do not know the
concentration of mouse allergen in the home of the family
in this study who lived in a wealthy Baltimore neighborhood.

Conclusion
The presence of MMTV-like DNA sequences in the malignant tissues of all three family members who lived in the
same house for decades argues for the possibility of
MMTV as a common environmental etiological agent.
Phylogenetic data suggest that the MMTV-like sequences
are mouse and not human derived and that the ultimate
reservoir of MMTV is most likely the mouse. Although the
route by which these three family members came to be
infected with MMTV is unknown, the possibility exists
that such infection may have resulted from an exposure to
mice.

PCR
Conditions and primer sequences for MMTV env and LTR
gene amplification were those described by Wang et al [4]
and Liu et al [25] respectively. A reaction without template
DNA was routinely tested to detect possible contamination of master mix components. Reactions with normal
breast DNA were done to rule out contamination of
tumor samples. The PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.8 % agarose gels. ΦX174 RF DNA cut with
the restriction enzyme HaeIII was used as a marker to
identify the size of the PCR products.
Hybridization
PCR products were hybridized on Southern blots [13]
under stringent hybridization conditions to either a 23base pair (bp) probe specific for DNA sequences present
in exogenous MMTV env sequences but not present in
human endogenous retroviral sequence (HERV-K) DNA
[1,4,11,12] or to a 20-bp probe specific for the MMTV LTR
[6,16] and also not present in HERV-K DNA [11,12]. The
23-bp env probe, which extended from position 7822–
7845 in the MMTV genome, and the 20-bp LTR probe,
which extended from position 972–991 or 9545–9564 in
the MMTV genome [17], were end-labeled with [32P]ATP
using the T4 kinase forward reaction (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Stringent hybridization
conditions were as described previously [1,11].

Methods
Human tissue
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample blocks
of breast tumor tissue (mother and daughter) and metastatic breast tumor in lymph node (father) were obtained
from the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, courtesy of Drs. Elizabeth Montgomery and Arlene
Forastiere, under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center
(OLMMC). Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of each
paraffin block were made and read to determine the location of malignancy in each block. Blocks were shaved into
5 µm thick serial sections and two sections from each
specimen were used for DNA extraction. DNA was isolated from the blocks using a microwave technique [44].
Normal breast tissue samples were obtained from the
Pathology Department at OLMMC under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board of OLMMC.
DNA was extracted from normal breast tissue using the
QIAgen DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Germantown, MD).
To determine the quality of the isolated DNA from both
paraffin blocks of tumor tissue and fresh normal breast
tissue, globin primers were used in PCR and the resulting
amplified products were electrophoresed in 1.8 % agarose
gels.

Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
Amplified DNA products were cloned directly from the
PCR tube using the TOPO TA Cloning kit for Sequencing
(Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed by Genemed Synthesis (San Antonio, TX). The resulting
sequences were compared to known published sequences
and to sequences in the Genbank.
Phylogenetic analysis
The LTR sequences obtained from cloned fragments after
PCR amplification were compared to known exogenous
and endogenous MMTV sequences in the Genbank database. LTR sequences were aligned using DNAssist 2.0 software and analyzed using the phylogenetic Analysis Using
Parsimony (PAUP 4.0b 10) program [45] as previously
described [6].
