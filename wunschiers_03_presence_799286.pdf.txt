Abstract
Background: Hydrogenases catalyze the simplest of all chemical reactions: the reduction of
protons to molecular hydrogen or vice versa. Cyanobacteria can express an uptake, a bidirectional
or both NiFe-hydrogenases. Maturation of those depends on accessory proteins encoded by hypgenes. The last maturation step involves the cleavage of a ca. 30 amino acid long peptide from the
large subunit by a C-terminal endopeptidase. Until know, nothing is known about the maturation
of cyanobacterial NiFe-hydrogenases. The availability of three complete cyanobacterial genome
sequences from strains with either only the uptake (Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC 73102),
only the bidirectional (Synechocystis PCC 6803) or both NiFe-hydrogenases (Anabaena PCC 7120)
prompted us to mine these genomes for hydrogenase maturation related genes. In this
communication we focus on the presence and the expression of the NiFe-hydrogenases and the
corresponding C-terminal endopeptidases, in the three strains mentioned above.
Results: We identified genes encoding putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific C-terminal
endopeptidases in all analyzed cyanobacterial genomes. The genes are not part of any known
hydrogenase related gene cluster. The derived amino acid sequences show only low similarity (28–
41%) to the well-analyzed hydrogenase specific C-terminal endopeptidase HybD from Escherichia
coli, the crystal structure of which is known. However, computational secondary and tertiary
structure modeling revealed the presence of conserved structural patterns around the highly
conserved active site. Gene expression analysis shows that the endopeptidase encoding genes are
expressed under both nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing conditions.
Conclusion: Anabaena PCC 7120 possesses two NiFe-hydrogenases and two hydrogenase specific
C-terminal endopeptidases but only one set of hyp-genes. Thus, in contrast to the Hyp-proteins,
the C-terminal endopeptidases are the only known hydrogenase maturation factors that are
specific. Therefore, in accordance with previous nomenclature, we propose the gene names hoxW
and hupW for the bidirectional and uptake hydrogenase processing endopeptidases, respectively.
Due to their constitutive expression we expect that, at least in cyanobacteria, the endopeptidases
take over multiple functions.

tions: the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen or
vice versa. Depending on the metal content of the active

site hydrogenases are classified into Fe-, NiFe-, and metalfree hydrogenases [1]. Independent from the metal content, the enzymes are characterized as hydrogen uptake,
bidirectional and hydrogen evolving hydrogenases, indicating their actual in vivo activity. A prominent and evolutionary old group of organisms possessing NiFehydrogenases are phototrophic cyanobacteria (formerly
blue-green algae) [2]. All cyanobacteria investigated so far,
express an uptake, a bidirectional or both NiFe-hydrogenases [2–6]. The uptake hydrogenase is a dimeric enzyme
consisting of a large subunit (HupL) containing the active
site and a small subunit (HupS) with several FeS-clusters.
The physiological role of the uptake hydrogenase appears
to be coupled to nitrogen fixation [7–9]: the hydrogen
evolved as a by-product from nitrogenase activity can be
recycled by the action of the uptake hydrogenase [2]. Consequently, the uptake hydrogenase is found in nitrogenfixing cyanobacteria only [2,10]. The bidirectional hydrogenase consists of an electron transmitting and anchoring
diaphorase part (HoxFU), an active site containing large
subunit (HoxH) and a FeS-cluster harboring small subunit (HoxY) [3,11]. The presence of a third diaphorase subunit (HoxE) has been demonstrated for Anacystis nidulans
(Synechococcus PCC 6301) and Synechocystis PCC 6803
[12]. Neither is the bidirectional hydrogenase universally
distributed among cyanobacteria nor is its function clearly
understood, yet [2].
The maturation of nickel-containing enzymes, e.g. hydrogenases, ureases, and carbonmonoxide dehydrogenases, is
a complex process requiring accessory proteins [13–19].
For hydrogenases, the first experimental results were obtained from Escherichia coli. A number of mutations in the
58–59 min region of the E. coli chromosome (location
2848670–2852287 in E. coli strain K12 genome [20]) affect the biosynthesis of all NiFe-hydrogenases of this organism [21]. Sequencing of this region revealed 5 ORFs,
which were designated hypABCDE, indicating that these
genes affect hydrogenases pleiotropically [22] and which
were to be the first identified genes associated with hydrogenase maturation. Later on, hyp homologous genes were
also identified in cyanobacteria (see [2] and references
therein).
One distinct step in NiFe-hydrogenases maturation is the
endoproteolytic cleavage of a C-terminal peptide (ca. 30
amino acids) of the large subunit precursor [19]. E. coli is
able to synthesize at least three NiFe-hydrogenases (operons hya, hyb and hyc, encoding hydrogenase 1, 2 and 3, respectively). In addition, the operon for a fourth
hydrogenases (operon hyf, encoding hydrogenase 4) has
been identified but its functional expression has not been
proven yet [23]. Hydrogenases 1 and 2 have been shown
to be involved in anaerobic hydrogen oxidation for energy
production [24–27], whereas hydrogenase 3 is part of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/3/8

formate-hydrogen-lyase complex and catalyzes the evolution of hydrogen from formate [28]. Each hydrogenase
isoenzyme large subunit is proteolytically processed by a
corresponding specific C-terminal endopeptidase (i.e.
HyaB by HyaD, HybC by HybD and HycE by HycI). There
has been no peptidase identified for HyfG yet. The peptidases cleave the hydrogenase large subunit precursor proteins after a histidine or arginine residue in the C-terminal
consensus motif DPCxxCxx(H/R) liberating a short
polypeptide (Table 1) [29–32]. The first crystal structure
from a NiFe-hydrogenase of the sulfate reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio gigas [33] revealed that those conserved
cysteines are ligands to the NiFe-active site of hydrogenases. The endopeptidase HybD, responsible for proteolytic
maturation of the precursor of the large subunit from hydrogenase 2 of E. coli, has been overexpressed and crystallized [34]. X-ray analysis of the crystal structure revealed
the presence of three amino acid residues, which are involved in metal binding (Glu16, Asp62, and His93). Recognition of the hydrogenase by the peptidase does not
depend on the cleavage site consensus sequence but is mediated by the overall 3-dimensional hydrogenase and
peptidase protein structures [35,36]. Until now, nothing
is known about the maturation of cyanobacterial NiFe-hydrogenases. Previously, we cloned, sequenced and characterized a hyp-operon from the heterocystous nitrogenfixing cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/
PCC 73102 [37]. The availability of three completed cyanobacterial genomes from organisms with either only
the uptake (Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC 73102
[38]), only the bidirectional (Synechocystis PCC 6803
[39,40]) or both NiFe-hydrogenases (Anabaena PCC 7120
[41]) prompted us to mine these genomes for hydrogenase-related genes. In this communication we focus on
the presence and the expression of the NiFe-hydrogenases
and the corresponding putative hydrogenase specific Cterminal endopeptidases in these three strains.

Results and Discussion
Genome Search and Sequence Analysis
Initially, we investigated the C-terminal parts of all available cyanobacterial hydrogenase large subunit sequences
for the presence of the characteristic cutting site motif:
DPCxxCxx(H/R) [1,19]. This motif was found in all deduced amino acid sequences (Table 1). In contrary to all
other analyzed sequences, in the uptake hydrogenase
(HupL) cutting site motif the neutral proline (P) at position 2 is exchanged by an uncharged polar serine (S) (Table 1).

In order to search for putative hydrogenase specific C-terminal endopeptidases (hydrogenase maturating peptidases) in the cyanobacterial genomes, the protein sequences
of HyaD, HybD, and HycI from E. coli were used in BLAST
searches. The E. coli sequences are 22 to 41% similar to

each other (Table 2). Analysis of the positive hits revealed
overall low similarities between both the E. coli and the
putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidases, and among the cyanobacterial proteins, respectively
(Table 2). The average similarity is 42%. Interestingly,
only in the Anabaena PCC 7120 genome two putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidases were
found. The deduced amino acid sequences show 27 and
89% similarity to the putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase
maturating peptidase from the closely related Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC 73102. In addition to the putative peptidase genes, sequences of flanking genes with the
same reading frame orientation were retrieved (Fig. 1AB).
Analysis of these genes gave no indication of functional
relations (Fig. 1B). None of the open reading frames oriented in the same direction showed any homology to any
known protein involved in either hydrogenase maturation or hydrogen metabolism. This finding is not surprising in the case of Synechocystis PCC 6803. In this strain all
hydrogenase maturation related genes were found to be
scattered over the entire genome [2]. However, in the case
of Anabaena PCC 7120 [42] and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC
29133/PCC 73102 [37] the hyp-genes were found to be
clustered in one operon.
Figure 2 shows an alignment of the retrieved putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidases and the
known enzymes from E. coli. In all sequences the nickelbinding site, as assigned from the E. coli HybD crystal
structure [34], could be identified at conserved positions.

It consists of an N-terminal aspartic or glutamic acid residue, a second aspartic acid residue and a histidine residue
(Fig. 2). The amino acid conservation around these active
site metal-binding amino acids was found to be low.
Thus, the identity of the cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidases can not be unambiguously concluded
from the primary sequence information alone. In order to
corroborate the identity and to collect further evidence for
the participation of the three highly conserved amino acids in metal binding, secondary and tertiary protein structures were computed. Figure 3 shows an alignment of
alpha helices and beta sheets, which were calculated by
the program NNPREDICT [43]. The alignment clearly
shows that the putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidases are structurally related to the hydrogenase maturating peptidases from E. coli (67–77%
structural identity).
This allowed performing a 3-dimensional alignment
against HybD from E. coli. Except for the sequence from
Synechocystis PCC 6803 all putative cyanobacterial
hydrogenase maturating peptidases could be aligned with
and fitted to the 3-dimensional structure of HybD (Fig. 4).
From Table 2 it can be seen that of all analyzed putative
cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidase sequences the Synechocystis PCC 6803 sequence shows the
lowest similarity (28%) and identity (14%) to HybD from
E. coli. Most probably, this accounts for the computational
inability to perform a 3-dimensional alignment to E. coli
HybD. For the putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase

maturating peptidases from Nostoc punctiforme ATCC
29133/PCC 73102 and Anbaena PCC 7120 the 3-dimensional structural alignment result in an almost perfect
match (Fig. 4). Most importantly, the active site metalbinding amino acid residues fit into the same sterical conformation as in the HybD template. Taken all data of the
sequence analysis together, the sequences all0770 and
alr1423 from Anabaena PCC 7120 and the sequence c509/
r320 from Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC 73102
can clearly be assigned as hydrogenase maturating peptidases. The good secondary structure alignment between
sequence slr1876 from Synechocystis PCC 6803 and HybD
from E. coli, especially with respect to the active site metalbinding amino acid residues, identifies this gene as encoding a hydrogenase maturating peptidase, too. In the future, we hope to obtain physiological and biochemical
evidence to corroborate these identifications.
It should be noted that, according to the structural classification of proteins (SCOP; [44]), HybD (1CFZ) belongs
to the superfamily of HybD-like structures in the class of
alpha/beta proteins. The only other known structural
member of this superfamily is a germination protease
from Bacillus megaterium (1C8B, [45]), which contains a
phosphorylase/hydrolase-like fold. Although sequencewise very different, germination proteases match structurally very good to hydrogenase maturating peptidases. The
only exception is the absence of helices 4 and 5 in the
former enzymes (Fig. 3).
Expression Analysis
From previous studies, the expression of hydrogenase
structural genes is well known (see [2] for a review). The
bidirectional hydrogenase is continuously expressed,
though strongly induced by e.g. anaerobic conditions, as
shown for Nostoc muscorum [46]. The uptake hydrogenase is only expressed under nitrogen-fixing conditions in
Anabaena PCC 7120 and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC
29133/PCC 73102. In order to analyze the expression pat-

tern of the cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturating peptidase genes and the hydrogenase large subunit structural
genes, we performed RT-PCR based transcription studies
(Fig. 5, Table 3). A transcript corresponding to the hydrogenase maturating peptidases could be detected under all
conditions examined. This means that the transcript is
present when the corresponding hydrogenase large subunit transcript is absent. Thus, the expression of the putative hydrogenase maturating peptidases seems to be
differently regulated than the expression of both the hydrogenase structural and accessory genes in cyanobacteria.
For Anabaena PCC 7120 it was shown that the accessory
genes hypFCDEAB (initially identified as hup-genes) are
expressed in heterocyst-induced (nitrogen-fixing) but not
in non-nitrogen-fixing cultures [2,42]. The same situation
was described for Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC
73102 [37]. These findings point to either a post-transcriptional regulation of the peptidase transcript or to an
additional function of the protein. Since proteolytic
processing of the large hydrogenase subunit is considered
to be the last step during hydrogenase maturation, the
former mechanism would allow a rapid maturation of the
pre-processed, but immature, hydrogenase [19]. Our observation is supported by the finding that in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7942 (Anacystis
nidulans R2) hoxW is co-transcribed as part of the polycistronic message hoxUYHW [47,48]. Thus, similar expression levels were anticipated for these genes. However,
hoxU and hoxW transcription was found to be ca. 4-times
higher than hoxY and hoxH transcription [48]. Furthermore, hoxW was found to have its own promoter element.
Thus, although part of a polycistronic transcript with
structural hydrogenase genes, transcription of hoxW can
be independently regulated in Synechococcus PCC 7942.
In the cyanobacteria analyzed in the present study, the independence of hoxW and hupW is pronounced by their
operon distribution in the respective genomes (Fig. 1) and
is further reflected in their transcription being independent of the structural hydrogenase genes (Fig. 5, Table 3).

Phylogenetic analysis of NiFe-hydrogenases revealed a
close relationship between cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenases (HupSL) and bacterial hydrogen sensing hydrogenases (HoxBC, HupUV) [1]. These hydrogen sensors lack
the C-terminal extension, which is cleaved off after nickel
insertion, but nevertheless contain the bimetallic NiFecenter [49–51]. This indicates that the final endopeptidase mediated hydrogenase maturation step is not absolutely necessary in order to obtain the fully assembled
active site. From a phylogenetic point of view it seems that
the last common ancestor of cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenases and hydrogen sensing hydrogenases possessed
the C-terminal extension and the cutting site motive.
Thus, it will be interesting to elucidate the advantage or
necessity to loose that extension in the case of hydrogen
sensing hydrogenases. Furthermore, it raises the question
why the C-terminal extension was kept in all other known
NiFe-hydrogenase. The fact, that cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific endopeptidase are constitutively expressed
might point to multiple functions of these enzymes.

Conclusions
Hydrogenase specific C-terminal endopeptidases share
only low sequence similarity. Thus, the present study gives
an example for the necessity to apply secondary and tertiary protein sequence information in order to facilitate unambiguous gene identification. Anabaena PCC 7120
possesses two NiFe-hydrogenases and two hydrogenase
specific C-terminal endopeptidases but only one set of
hyp-genes. Thus, in contrast to the universal Hyp-proteins,
the C-terminal endopeptidases are the only known hydrogenase maturation factors that are specific. In order to
keep in line with previous nomenclature we name the
bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hox-genes)
processing endopeptidases HoxW and propose to name
the hydrogenase uptake (encoded by hup-genes) processing endopeptidases HupW.

Methods
Genome data analysis
The genomes of Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC
73102 http://spider.jgi-psf.org/JGI_microbial/html/nostoc/nostoc_homepage.html, Anabaena PCC 7120 http://
www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Anabaena/index.html and
Synechocystis PCC 6803 http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis/index.html were analyzed using the
online program BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool) [52] provided by the respective genome initiative.
For Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/PCC 73102, preliminary sequence data was obtained from "The DOE Joint
Genome Institute (JGI)".
Computational structure modeling
The derived protein sequences from the putative cyanobacterial hydrogenase maturation peptidase genes were
structurally aligned using the online program SWISS
MODEL http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html[53–55]. As reference the crystal structure from
the hydrogenase specific C-terminal endopeptidase HybD
from E. coli [34] was chosen.
Secondary structure prediction
The secondary structure was predicted using NNPREDICT
http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~nomi/nnpredict.html[43]. No special parameters were set. The secondary structure from the crystal structure data file of the
hydrogenase maturating endopeptidase HybD from E. coli
[34] (ProteinDataBank accession number: 1CFZ.pdb) was
extracted by DSSP http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/swift/dssp/
[56]. These data were used as a template for secondary
structure identity calculations. The calculations were
performed with a homemade PERL script employing a

Primer Design
Using the genomic sequences as templates PCR and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) oligo-nucleotide primers were designed using the online program Primer3 (S.
Rozen and H. J. Skaletsky, 1996,1997,1998; code available at http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/genome_software/

be around 300 bp. All used primers are shown in Table 4.

in BG110 [57] as previously described [37]. Non-nitrogen-fixing cultures of Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133/
PCC 73102, Anabaena PCC 7120 and Synechocystis PCC
6803 were grown in BG110 supplemented with 5 mM
ammonium chloride and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) (Nostoc
and Anabaena) or BG110 supplemented with 1.5 g/l (17.7
mM) sodium nitrate (Synechocystis). All cultures were
sparked with air. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at

4°C for 5 min in 50 ml Falcon tubes (Falcon#2070). Subsequently, the supernatant was removed, the cell pellet
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the cells stored
at -20°C.
DNA and RNA purification
Genomic DNA from all investigated cyanobacterial strains
was isolated as described earlier [58]. Total RNA was
isolated from all strains as described by Axelsson et al.
[59]. Nucleic acid quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) and photospectroscopy.

Transcription analysis (RT-PCR)
Transcription analysis was carried out as previously described [59]. Total RNA (0.5–1 µg) was used for reverse
transcription with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega
Corporation) using antisense primers (Table 4). cDNA
produced in reverse transcription reaction was used for
PCR reactions with sense/antisense primer pairs given in
Table 4. The following PCR program profile was applied:
1 min at 94°C followed by 40 repetitive cycles of 10 s denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 55.1°C, and 30 s
elongation at 72°C and finishing with 7 min at 72°C.
Products of the PCR reactions were analyzed using 1%
agarose gels. Images were captured on film, scanned and
edited into Photoshop 4.0. Negative controls included no
reverse transcriptase in the RT reaction prior to PCR and
dH2O in the PCR, both resulting in no amplificates. For
positive controls genomic DNA was used in PCR.
