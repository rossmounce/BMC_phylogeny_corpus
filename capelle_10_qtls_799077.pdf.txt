Abstract
Background: Kernel moisture at harvest is an important trait since a low value is required to prevent unexpected
early germination and ensure seed preservation. It is also well known that early germination occurs in viviparous
mutants, which are impaired in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. To provide some insight into the genetic
determinism of kernel desiccation in maize, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for traits related to kernel
moisture and ABA content in both embryo and endosperm during kernel desiccation. In parallel, the expression
and mapping of genes involved in kernel desiccation and ABA biosynthesis, were examined to detect candidate
genes.
Results: The use of an intermated recombinant inbred line population allowed for precise QTL mapping. For 29
traits examined in an unreplicated time course trial of days after pollination, a total of 78 QTLs were detected, 43
being related to kernel desiccation, 15 to kernel weight and 20 to ABA content. Multi QTL models explained 35 to
50% of the phenotypic variation for traits related to water status, indicating a large genetic control amenable to
breeding. Ten of the 20 loci controlling ABA content colocated with previously detected QTLs controlling water
status and ABA content in water stressed leaves. Mapping of candidate genes associated with kernel desiccation
and ABA biosynthesis revealed several colocations between genes with putative functions and QTLs. Parallel
investigation via RT-PCR experiments showed that the expression patterns of the ABA-responsive Rab17 and Rab28
genes as well as the late embryogenesis abundant Emb5 and aquaporin genes were related to desiccation rate
and parental allele effect. Database searches led to the identification and mapping of two zeaxanthin epoxidase
(ZEP) and five novel 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) related genes, both gene families being involved in
ABA biosynthesis. The expression of these genes appeared independent in the embryo and endosperm and not
correlated with ABA content in either tissue.
Conclusions: A high resolution QTL map for kernel desiccation and ABA content in embryo and endosperm
showed several precise colocations between desiccation and ABA traits. Five new members of the maize NCED
gene family and another maize ZEP gene were identified and mapped. Among all the identified candidates,
aquaporins and members of the Responsive to ABA gene family appeared better candidates than NCEDs and ZEPs.

Background
Maize (Zea mays) kernel moisture at harvest is an
important trait in temperate regions because costly additional drying is needed to reach 15% water content,
which is the level compatible with good seed preservation during storage. Although yield is correlated to maximum water content occurring approximately 40-60
days after pollination (DAP) [1] and to a lesser extent to

kernel moisture at maturity [2], the yield/moisture ratio
at maturity is variable enough to allow selection for
both higher yield and lower moisture at harvest [3,4].
For example, recurrent selection has been successfully
applied for reduction of kernel moisture by the introduction of tropical germplasm into temperate-adapted
germplasm [5]. Indirect inbred selection criteria to
reduce gain moisture, based on husk senescence have
been proposed [6]. The biochemical, biophysical and
molecular phenomena controlling kernel moisture at
harvest intervene mainly during the maturation phase,

which corresponds to the last stage of seed development
after the early and the grain filling phases. Physiological
and genetic analyses of the maturation phase reveal a
process, which both prevents early embryo germination
and favours the synthesis of specialized proteins related
to the acquisition of desiccation tolerance, enhancing
embryo viability under strong dehydration. Accordingly,
in many seed species including maize, embryos separated from endosperm at the early developmental phase
can grow and germinate when placed in tissue culture,
but their germination ability decreases as maturation
proceeds [7].
Despite considerable progress in recent years in
knowledge of maturation, the number of genes thought
to be involved in regulation of kernel moisture remains
extremely limited. The late embryogenesis abundant
(LEA) proteins including the dehydrin family, are specifically produced during the maturation phase [8].
Although they have been assumed for a long time to
protect cellular and molecular structures from the
damaging effect of desiccation [8], only recent results
shed some light on their precise action. Cytoplasmic
LEA proteins prevent protein aggregation due to water
loss in vitro [9] and mitochondria LEA proteins protect
two matrix enzymes, fumarase and rhodanese [10].
Other proteins likely to be involved in kernel desiccation
are the water channel aquaporins, which are present in
nearly all organs. An extensive study of maize aquaporins described 31 full length cDNAs distributed into four
groups comprising 13 plasma membrane (PIP) and 11
tonoplast (TIP) intrinsic proteins [11]. Among them,
ZmPIP1;1, ZmPIP1;2, ZmPIP1;3, ZmPIP2;1, ZmPIP2;2,
ZmPIP2;3, TIP1;1 and TIP2;1 were reported to be
expressed in reproductive tissues. In rice (Oryza sativa),
OsTIP1 and OsTIP3 are expressed in mature seeds in
the embryo and the aleurone layer, respectively. Because
members of the PIP2 and TIP1 families have much
higher water transport capacities than those of the PIP1
family [12], aquaporins of the first two families may be
of higher significance for desiccation.
The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) appears to
play a central role in both the establishment of embryo
dormancy and the synthesis of LEA proteins, as demonstrated by mutants impaired in ABA synthesis or sensitivity. ABA deficient maize mutants are viviparous, i.e.
embryos germinate precociously on the ear [13,14], their
vivipary being prevented by ABA addition. ABA synthesis mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) have also impaired seed
maturation and dormancy but are not viviparous [15].
Interestingly, maize plants with white endosperm (yellow
mutants) have higher moisture than those with yellow
endosperm [16]. This is due to the fact that the y1
mutation causes a defect in phytoene synthase (PSY), an

Page 2 of 22

enzyme involved in both carotenoid and ABA synthesis
[17], highlighting the likely role of ABA in regulating
kernel moisture. Furthermore, the expression of many
LEA genes and more generally members of the Responsive to ABA (Rab) gene family, is induced by exogenous
ABA [18].
The ABA biosynthetic and catabolic pathways are now
well understood since almost all the biosynthetic genes
have been identified through the isolation of auxotrophic
mutants [19]. The enzymes downstream of the xanthophyll cycle are specific to ABA biosynthesis. The cloning
and characterization of maize Viviparous14 (Vp14),
which encodes 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1
(NCED1) catalyzing the cleavage of the C40 neoxanthin
chain into the C15 ABA skeleton xanthoxin [20], led to
the identification of NCED as a rate controlling enzyme.
Indeed, maize nced1 mutants have a strongly reduced
kernel ABA content [21] and in Arabidopsis, NCED1
overexpression confers a significant increase in ABA
accumulation in the plant [22]. In Arabidopsis, nine
NCED-related sequences have been identified and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that five of these clustered
with functionally characterized NCED proteins from
other species [23]. Aside from this main regulatory step
in the ABA biosynthesis pathway, other metabolic steps
of ABA metabolism also contribute to determining ABA
level. One is the conversion of zeaxanthin into violaxanthin catalyzed by zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), which is
encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis and
tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) and whose overexpression causes an enhanced accumulation of ABA in
seeds [24]. The cloning and characterization of the maize
Viviparous10/Viviparous13 (Vp10/Vp13) and Viviparous15 (Vp15) genes further demonstrated that ABA biosynthesis is also dependent on a molybdenum cofactor
involved in the abscisic aldehyde oxidase reaction, the
last step of ABA biosynthesis [25,26]. In addition, the
recent discovery that Viviparous8 (Vp8) encodes a putative peptidase, together with the predominant effect of
vp8 mutant on ABA synthesis and turnover in maize
embryos, indicate that ABA level is also controlled indirectly through regulation of seed-specific factors [27].
The mutant approach is powerful in identifying the
mandatory steps (genes) in a pathway, but it does not
provide any insight into the relative impact of each step
on the quantitative value of the final product (trait) of
the pathway. The genetic variability of quantitative traits
is controlled by one or generally several loci named
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) which may be mapped
using appropriate segregating populations. In addition,
the relative contribution of each locus to the trait
genetic variation and the allelic effect at each locus may
be estimated. More than 20 years ago, Robertson proposed a very fruitful hypothesis bridging mutation and

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

QTL approaches by simply saying that the “qualitative
and quantitative traits may be the result of different
types of variation of genic DNA at the loci involved"; in
other words minor allelic effects produce quantitative
variations, while major variations (null alleles) produce
qualitative variations (mutations) [28]. This opened the
way for research aiming at the identification of the
genes underlying QTLs. The considerable international
efforts in mapping known function genes in maize now
provide rather precise genetic maps that can be used to
identify candidate genes from their map common location with detected QTLs [29]. This comparison is easier
when dealing with physiological and biochemical traits
since the number of possible candidate genes may be
restricted to those encoding enzymes or cofactors acting
in relevant pathways [30]. However, one limitation is the
confidence interval of the QTL position which may
reach more than 10 centimorgans (cM) in classical
recombinant inbred lines (RILs) as illustrated in one of
the few reports on QTL for kernel moisture and drying
rate [31]. A way to reduce this interval is to increase the
number of recombination events by the inclusion of
four generations of random intermating after the second
generation and before the single seed descent, thus providing intermated recombinant inbred lines in which the
QTL confidence interval is substantially reduced by a
factor of two to three [32]. The candidate gene selection
is thus facilitated. A useful criterion to validate the identified candidate genes is to examine the corresponding
gene expression during the process under investigation
[33]. Differences in the transcription level related to the
trait variation may support the role of the functional difference of the parental alleles.
Much remains to be learned about the genes explaining the variability in the desiccation rate and the
genetic relationship between this process and ABA
content. Here, we describe a QTL-candidate gene analysis of the desiccation process in maize using an intermated recombinant inbred line population (LHRF_F3:4)
derived from the cross between the maize inbred lines
F2 and F252 differing in desiccation rate. First, QTLs
were searched for traits related to kernel moisture and
ABA content in the endosperm and the embryo during
kernel desiccation. Second, an extensive data mining of
the genes mapped in the confidence interval of the
QTLs was performed in order to short list candidate
genes with annotations related to desiccation rate and/
or ABA content. In addition to these in silico studies,
six members of the NCED gene family and two members of the ZEP gene family were identified and
mapped by PCR amplification and sequencing. Third,
expression profiles of the candidate genes during desic-

cation were examined by RT-PCR experiments for correlations with kernel desiccation rates or changes in
ABA content.

Results
Genetic variability in desiccation rate and ABA content

Kernel water content relative to dry weight (%DW) was
evaluated in the two parental inbred lines and the segregating LHRF_F3:4 population. This trait continuously
declined from 12 DAP when the kernel was still in the
filling stage and long before the onset of the maturation stage at 30 DAP (Fig. 1A, Table 1). However, kernel water content (g/kernel) reached a maximum
between 30 to 40 DAP (data not shown). This maximum corresponded to the end of the intensive starch
accumulation and indicated the beginning of the desiccation-maturation process. Thus, further data presentation was limited to the 30-80 DAP period. The two
parental lines had different desiccation rates, especially
after 40 DAP, F252 line having approximately 9% less
moisture ((FW - DW)/FW*100) than F2 line at harvest
(Fig. 1A, Table 1).
Mean ABA concentration in the LHRF_F3:4 population,
when expressed on DW basis, declined drastically from 12
to 30 DAP and then, increased slightly up to 60 DAP (Fig.
1B). Similar kinetics albeit with a much lower amplitude
between 12 and 30 DAP was observed when ABA was
expressed on FW basis, whereas the ABA content per mg
of water increased continuously and markedly after 40
DAP (Fig. 1C). Because ABA is water soluble, the later
mode of expression was likely the most physiologically
relevant, but also the most difficult to obtain when working with lyophilized powder as in the present experiments.
The interpretation of global changes at the kernel level
was further complicated by large differences between the
different kernel parts, ABA being 5 to 60 times more concentrated in the embryo than in the endosperm (Table 1).
In addition, the kinetics in the two tissues was also clearly
different. In the embryo, the bell-shaped ABA concentration curve peaked at 60 DAP and remained high at 80
DAP. In contrast, ABA concentration continuously
declined in the endosperm (Fig. 1D). Large genotypic
variability among the 153 LHRF_F3:4 lines was noted in
the general trend as shown by the large standard deviations. Principal component analysis and Pearson coefficient tables with all the measured variables showed that
FW was highly correlated to DW or kernel water content
(r > 0.69 to 0.94) at a given DAP stage, but not between
stages (Additional file 1). By contrast, regardless of the
considered stage, the correlation between endosperm ABA
content and embryo ABA content was not significant or
very low (r = 0.23). This was also true across DAP stages

(Additional file 1). Some low but significant correlations
were noted between some water-related variables and
ABA content in the endosperm or the embryo at a same
DAP stage (e.g. ABAemb80 and FW80, Additional file 1).
The trait variability was higher in the inbred lines than
in parental lines, which is usual with a complex trait, the
best line having lower moisture than F252 line and the
worst line having higher moisture than F2 line (Fig. 1A
for water content; Table 1 for others traits), illustrating
the so-called transgression effect. The existence of positive and negative allelic effects for each trait is in favour
of a genotypic origin of the transgressions observed at
the phenotypic level (Table 2).
QTLs for kernel desiccation and ABA content

QTLs were searched at 30, 40, 60 and 80 DAP for three
traits related to desiccation (Water, FW and %DW, blue

in Fig. 2), for one related to growth (DW, black in Fig.
2) and for ABA content either in embryo or endosperm
(pink in Fig. 2). In addition, desiccation rate was evaluated by five traits, the slope of the FW decrease from 30
to 80 DAP vs. thermal time and the slope between each
of the sampling dates (30 to 40, 40 to 60, 60 to 80 and
30 to 80 DAP, green in Fig. 2). A total of 78 QTLs were
detected for 25 of the 29 examined traits (Table 2). Out
of the 29 traits analyzed, 13 displayed at least one QTL
with a genomewide P value below 5%, confirming
unambiguously that their variation was unlikely due to
environmental effect, but rather to a genetic effect
(Table 2). On average, two to three QTLs were detected
for each trait, their sum explaining from 6.1 (ABA_embryo_60_1) to 52.8% (DW_60) of the phenotypic variation albeit rather low LOD scores (2 to 4.6). The fact

that each trait was measured on two plants per F 3:4
family from the same plot (unreplicated design) might
explain these moderate effects. The experimental design
did not allow for a correct estimation of heritabilities
but one may assume they were low. In order to evaluate
the uncertainties due to low heritability, genomewide
risk was calculated for each QTL (see asterisks in Tables
2 and 3). As classically observed, the QTLs for different
traits tend to be grouped in clusters that were not
evenly distributed in the genome (Fig. 2). In nearly each
cluster one or several QTLs were detected with a

genomewide risk below 5% (e.g. bins 1.04, 1.08, 2.05,
3.02, 4.04, 5.07, 7.03, 9.07). Forty three QTLs were
related to kernel desiccation, 15 to kernel weight and 20
to ABA concentration (Fig. 2, Table 2).
The largest cluster on bin 4.04 only consisted of desiccation traits, whereas in the other clusters desiccation
and growth traits were intermixed, which was expected
due to the observed correlation between FW and DW at
each DAP stage (Additional file 1). A focus on the 80
DAP stage at which maximum differences in drying
were observed between both genotypes (Fig. 1A),

To compare with gene positions, QTLs mapped on the LHRF_F3:4 segregating population (Additional file 1) were projected on the REFMAP050110 map [32] using
Biomercator [34]. Distances on REFMAP050110 are expressed in pcM and are shown in parentheses for gene candidates. Genes in bold were mapped by PCR in
this study (Tables 4 and Additional file 1). Genes involved in kernel drying and located in the vicinity of the QTL confidence interval, are indicated in grey. ABI2:
ABA-insensitive protein phosphatase 2C 2; AIP3: ABI3-interacting protein 3; Emb5: Embryogenic-ABA-inducible LEA 5; PM37: seed maturation protein; PSY3:
phytoene synthase 3; Vp1: Viviparous1; WSI724: dehydrin. The asterisks behind each QTL represent the genomewide risk P (for definition see legend of Table 2)
with * P < 0.25, ** P < 0.10, *** P < 0.05 and **** P < 0.01.

showed that among the six %DW80 QTLs, a variable
which mirrored moisture content, two colocated with
FW80 and/or Water80 (bins 4.04 and 8.02) and three
with QTLs for ABA content (bins 5.07, 9.04 and 9.07).
The allele effect was consistent with the better drying
performance of the F252 parent since four of the six %
DW80 QTLs with a cumulated R 2 of 35.4% (total R2 :
50.6%) presented a positive allele effect originating from
F252.

Page 9 of 22

QTLs for ABA content in embryo and endosperm
were rarely colocated, which was somewhat predictable
due to the poor correlation between ABA contents in
the two tissues. By contrast, numerous colocations were
observed between desiccation traits and ABA traits at
eight loci (bins 2.04, 3.03, 5.02, 5.07, 7.03, 7.05, 9.04
and 9.07), illustrated by overlaps of their QTL confidence intervals (compare blue and pink arrows in
Fig. 2).

Figure 2 QTLs and candidate gene map. The LHRF_ F3:4segregating population was used. Bins are shown on the right of chromosomes.
Distances are in pcM in the LHRF_ F3:4map (LHREF3_1201). QTLs for desiccation (blue), desiccation rate (green), growth (black) and ABA content
(pink) are on the left of the chromosomes (Tables 2 and 3). The confidence intervals of the QTLs are indicated by vertical bars. Arrows highlight
colocations between desiccation QTLs (blue) and growth QTLs (black) and between desiccation QTLs and ABA QTLs (pink). Gene locations in the
QTL confidence interval are indicated close to their corresponding QTLs. Gene codes are detailed in Tables 3 and 4. Genes in bold were mapped
by PCR in this study (Additional file 2). The others were mapped by Génoplante http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/GnpMap/. Genes involved in kernel
drying and located in the vicinity of the QTL confidence interval, are indicated in grey. ABA-emb: ABA in embryo (pg/DW); ABA-end: ABA in
endosperm (pg/DW); DW: kernel dry matter weight (mg/kernel); FW: kernel fresh matter weight (mg/kernel); %DW = DW/FW× 100; Water: kernel
water content (mg/kernel); Rate = (Water/FW × 100)/(thermal time interval); Slope: regression line slope of (Water/FW × 100) as a function of
thermal time.

Figure 3 Transcript profiling of candidate genes related to water transfer, kernel maturation and ABA regulation. End point RT-PCR was
performed on total RNA of the indicated tissues using gene-specific primers listed in Additional file 2. RNA quality and quantity were checked by
total RNA loading on an agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. The constitutively expressed 18 S rRNA gene was used as an internal
control of RNA quantity. A, whole kernels without glumes at 30 to 80 DAP. B, Endosperms (End) and Embryos (Emb) at 30 to 60 DAP. The
number of PCR cycles (end point) is indicated in brackets after the gene name.

QTL and gene colocation

When clusters are composed of traits of different classes
(desiccation, desiccation rate, growth, ABA content),
QTL colocations raise the classical question of the existence of common genes which may control genetic
variability of two or more classes at a single locus. A
way to find candidate genes is to examine the list of
reported genes which have been mapped in the QTL
region. For this purpose, the QTLs mapped on the
LHRF_F3:4 population (LHREF3_1201 map) were projected with Biomercator [34] on a reference map
(REFMAP050110), which is based on the internationally
used IBM population. The list of known or putative
cDNAs provided by the data base in each QTL confidence interval was manually scanned to select functions
related to water transfer (e.g. aquaporin), kernel maturation (e.g. LEA proteins) and ABA metabolism or regulation (e.g. ABA biosynthesis, ABA-responsive proteins
and related transcription factors).
Relevant colocations (i.e. genes in the QTL confidence
interval and functionally related to the trait) were
observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9
(Table 3). It has to be noted that most colocations of
interest (Table 3) involved at least one QTL with a LOD
score higher than 2.45, corresponding to an individual
significance level below 0.001 and a genomewide level
below 25%, including eight QTLs with a risk below 5%
(see Methods). Desiccation trait clusters colocated with
aquaporin ESTs (bins 1.06 and 4.06), maturation proteins (bins 1.04 and 4.03) and/or ABA-related genes

(bins 1.06, 1.08-1.09, 3.05, 4.04-4.05, 5.01 and 6.05). Surprisingly, ABA biosynthetic NCED1 (Vp14; bin 1.081.09) and NCED2 (bin 1.06) genes did not colocate with
QTLs for ABA content but rather with QTLs for desiccation. Nevertheless, colocations were identified for the
ABA biosynthetic ZEP1 (bin 2.04) and NCED5 (bin
5.07) genes and QTLs for both desiccation and ABA
content. Colocation of two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) ESTs was noted with clusters comprising
desiccation and ABA traits (bins 5.02 and 9.07). However, although very close to NCED genes, CCD genes
did not appear to be involved in ABA biosynthesis, the
encoded enzymes being able to cleave carotenoids at
9,10 (9’,10’) bonds to generate multiple apocarotenoid
products [35], whereas NCEDs cleaved carotenoids
asymmetrically at positions 11-12 [36]. Another colocation involved the ABA_endosperm_80_1 QTL (bin 7.03)
and the maize phytoene synthase 3 (PSY3) gene whose
expression influences abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis [37]. Three other colocations involved QTLs
for both desiccation and ABA content with genes
encoding aquaporins (TIP2;1 on bin 2.04, TIP2;2 on bin
5.07 and PIP1;5, PIP2;1, PIP2;4 and PIP2;6 on bin 7.02)
and LEA proteins (Rab28 on bin 5.02, Rehydrin on bin
7.05 and Rab17 on bin 9.04).
Transcript expression of candidate genes related to water
status, kernel maturation and ABA regulation during
kernel desiccation

As a first step to validate candidate genes, RT-PCR analysis was performed during kernel desiccation in both

Mapping of candidate genes was performed on the LHRF_Gnp2004 population derived from F2xF252 crossing, except for maize NCED6, ZEP1 and ZEP2 genes
which were mapped on the IBM population (REFMAP050110 map) because of no polymorphism between F2 and F252 lines. QTL codes are detailed in Table 3.

parental inbred lines for genes encoding LEA proteins,
ABA-responsive transcription factors and aquaporins. In
addition to parental differences, responses to desiccation
might be classified into three categories: up-regulation,
down-regulation and up-and-down-regulation (Fig. 3).
Expression of LEA Emb5 and Rab17 (Dhn1) genes and
dehydrin Rab28 gene increased during desiccation, especially in F252 at 60 and 80 DAP (Fig. 3A). Expression of
Dbf1 and Dbf2 genes encoding transcription factors regulating the LEA Rab17 gene [38] diverged. Dbf2 expression clearly decreased over the time, whereas Dbf1
expression was still substantial at 80 DAP (Fig. 3A). The
dehydrin Dhy1 gene was expressed at very low level.
Nevertheless, its transcript levels clearly decreased in
F252 genotype only, a pattern clearly established for the
dehydrin Dhn2 gene (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, Emb5,
Rab17 and Rab28 genes were more strongly expressed
in embryo, whereas Dhn2 and Dbf2 genes were mostly
expressed in endosperm (Fig. 3B). This pattern was conserved in both genotypes, although the magnitude of the
expression was frequently different as previously noted
in Fig. 3A.

Among the 12 analyzed PIP genes (Table 1), only
PIP1;2, PIP1;3, PIP2;1 and PIP2;2 were repeatedly
expressed in kernels (Fig. 3). PIP1;2 and PIP1;3 transcripts levels generally increased at later stages (Fig. 3A),
but the time course was gene and genotype-dependent.
Both genes showed stronger expression in embryo than
in endosperm in F2 genotype, while no clear preference
was seen in F252 genotype (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PIP2;1
and PIP2;2 expression was more or less stable during
grain desiccation (Fig. 3A), with a preferential expression of PIP2;2 in older endosperm (Fig. 3B). The three
TIPs tested (Additional file 2) had expression maximum
in leaf and root tissue and only TIP1;1 was weakly
expressed in kernels (data not shown).
Molecular analysis of maize NCED and ZEP genes

One of the problems in analyzing accurately NCED and
ZEP expression was the design of specific primers
mainly because of insufficient knowledge of the actual
number and sequence of NCED and ZEP genes in
maize. Therefore, we first analyzed the public databases
for the presence of putative NCED and ZEP coding
sequences in maize. Nine different NCED loci had

Figure 4 Phylogenetic tree of NCED proteins. The five novel maize NCED protein sequences were aligned with known NCED protein
sequences [39,44,45]. In addition, four other NCED protein sequences were included in the alignment: OsNCED4 [GenBank:AAW21318.1] and
OsNCED5 [GenBank:AAW21317.1] from rice and PsNCED2 [GenBank:BAC10550] and PsNCED3 [GenBank:BAC10551] from Pisum sativum. An
unrooted tree ofthe NCED protein sequences was obtained using the maximum Likelihood method. Branch lengths are scaled proportional to
substitution rate. Bootstrap values (percent) of 500 bootstrap replicates exceeding 70% are indicated above the supported branches. The
Arabidopsis and maize NCEDs are highlighted by grey and dark boxes, respectively. Maize accession numbers are indicated in Table 4. Other
NCEDs include: AtNCED2 [GenBank:NP_193569], AtNCED3 [GenBank:NP_188062], AtNCED5 [GenBank:NP_174302], AtNCED6 [GenBank:NP_189064]

previously been identified with NCED-like EST
sequences in the Génoplante programme, some ESTs
mapping to several loci (e.g. E746, Table 4). To identify
a maximum of NCED genes in maize, the search was
extended to maize genomic contigs (The Institute for
Genomic Research) and high throughput genomic
sequences, which were matched with the EST sequences
and used to design specific primers (Additional file 2)
for DNA and cDNA amplification in lines F2 and F252.
Focus on longest ESTs in the mixed cDNA/genomic

DNA contigs allowed us to discard contigs with introns,
which belonged to the CCD gene family [23] and to
determine six maize NCED genes that could potentially
encode NCED proteins (Table 4). Phylogenetic analysis
performed with the deduced NCED amino acid
sequences showed that the six maize proteins fell into
four monocot clusters that were distinguishable from
the eudicot cluster (Fig. 4). In contrast, close homologs
for each of the maize NCED genes were found in rice.
The two putative maize NCED5 and NCED6 proteins

Figure 5 Transcript profiling of maize NCEDs and ZEPs in kernel at 40 and 60 DAP. qRT-PCR was performed on total RNA of the indicated
tissues using gene-specific primers listed in Additional file 2. Gene codes are detailed in Table 4. RNA quality and quantity were checked by
total RNA loading on an agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Transcript levels were normalized with the values obtained for the Zeastar
gene, which was used as an internal reference gene, and are shown relative to NCED3 transcript levels in embryo at 40 DAP (the expression
level of maize NCED3 in embryo at 40 DAP = 1). Values represent the mean of three biological replicates ± SE. When two samples show
different letters above the bars, the difference between them is significant (P < 0.05). When both tissue and genotype effects were significant, a,
b, l a and l b are indicated (see the Methods section and ANOVA in Additional file 4). End X: endosperm at x DAP; Emb X: embryo at X DAP.

fell into a highly divergent cluster, including two maize
and two rice NCED proteins. The orthologs of maize
NCED1 (VP14) and NCED4 proteins were rice NCED1
and NCED3 proteins, respectively. Additionally, maize
NCED2 and NCED3 proteins appeared as a pair of paralogs that was related to rice NCED2, whereas maize
NCED5 and NCED6 proteins appeared as a pair of paralogs that was related to rice NCED5. NCED1 (Vp14),
NCED2, NCED3, NCED4 and NCED5 genes were
mapped on the LHRF mapping panel at five different
loci (bins 1.08-1.09, 1.05-1.06, 3.05-3.06, 3.00 and 5.065.07) (Fig. 2, Table 4). NCED6 gene was mapped on the
IBM mapping panel because of no polymorphism
between F2 and F252 (bin 4.06; Fig. 2, Table 4). Only
NCED1, NCED2 and NCED5 corresponded to previously mapped NCED-annotated ESTs, whereas no EST
was detected for maize NCED3, NCED4 and NCED6
gene loci. Consistently, none of the identified NCED
genes mapped at the CCD loci (bins 5.02 and 9.07;
Table 3).
Four ZEP-annotated ESTs had previously been
mapped at bins 2.02-2.03, 4.09-4.11 and 5.01 (Génoplante data base, http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/GnpMap,
data not shown) in maize. Nevertheless, only two maize
ZEP genes, ZEP1 (yrGATE_Zm2 gZEP1) and ZEP2
(yrGATE_Zm10 gZEP2), were ascertained from our data
mining and PCR fragment joining (Additional file 3), in
agreement with a recent report [37], and mapped on
IBM mapping panel at bins 2.04 and 10.04-10.05,
respectively (Fig. 2, Table 4).

Transcript expression of maize NCED and ZEP genes
during kernel desiccation

Colocations were identified for NCED5 and ZEP1 loci
and QTLs for both desiccation and ABA traits, suggesting that these ABA biosynthetic genes are potential candidates (Fig. 2, Tables 3 and 4). Interestingly, NCED1
(Vp14), NCED2 and NCED6 genes mapped at loci colocating with QTLs for desiccation only (Fig. 2, Tables 3
and 4). Therefore, transcript levels of maize NCED and
ZEP genes were quantified by quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) in embryo and endosperm from both parental lines at 40 and 60 DAP, ABA content being at the
highest level in embryo at these stages (Fig. 1D). NCED4
expression was not analyzed because it was not possible
to design NCED4-specific primers of sufficient quality
for qRT-PCR.
NCED1, NCED2, NCED3, NCED5 and NCED6 transcripts were detected in all tissues analyzed, NCED2 and
NCED3 being frequently expressed at a level close to
the detection limit in most of the samples (Fig. 5). At 40
DAP, differential expression between embryo and endosperm was significant for the two mainly expressed
NCED genes, NCED1 and NCED6 (Fig. 5A, Additional
file 4) but the response was opposite since, in both genotypes, NCED1 transcript was present at the highest
level in the embryo, while NCED6 was the most highly
expressed transcript in the endosperm. NCED5 had a
similar pattern to that of NCED1, although the magnitude of the embryo-endosperm difference in transcript
level was lower than for NCED1 (Fig. 5A, Additional file

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

4). There was also a genotype effect since differential
expression between F2 and F252 genotypes was significant for NCED2, NCED5 and NCED6 genes (Fig. 5A,
Additional file 4). At 60 DAP, NCED1, NCED2, NCED3
and NCED6 transcript levels were higher in both genotypes than at 40 DAP (Fig. 5B). The difference between
embryo and endosperm was no longer significant for
NCED1 and NCED5 genes (Fig. 5B, Additional file 4). In
contrast, expression was significantly higher in endosperm than in embryo for NCED3 and NCED6 genes
(Fig. 5B, Additional file 3). Additionally, the genotype
effect was significant for NCED3, its transcript level
being lower in F2 genotype than in F252 genotype in
both tissues (Fig. 5B, Additional file 4).
Regarding the ZEP genes, at 40 DAP, they were both
mainly expressed in the endosperm rather than in the
embryo (Fig. 5A, Additional file 4). There was also a
genotype effect since expression of both ZEP genes was
higher in the F252 genotype than in the F2 genotype in
both tissues. At 60 DAP, ZEP1 preferential expression
in the endosperm and higher expression in F252 were
significant as observed at 40 DAP but magnitude of the
effects was lower (Fig. 5B, Additional file 4). In contrast,
there was no significant difference for ZEP2 expression
between embryo and endosperm whatever the genotypes
(Fig. 5B, Additional file 4).

Discussion
Relationship between kernel moisture and kernel weight

The observed genetic variability in the desiccation rate
of maize inbred lines F2 and F252 and their offspring
means that this trait is amenable for breeding purposes.
The use of intermated recombinant inbred lines allows
the reduction of QTL confidence interval to only a few
pseudo cM (pcM, see Methods for equivalence between
pcM and cM). On the basis of a map of roughly 6000
pcM and a genome size of 30 000 to 40 000 genes per
maize genome, an estimate of 5 to 7 genes per pcM is
reached. With the large progress in maize sequencing
http://www.maizesequence.org, in maize genetic mapping, and syntenic relationships between maize and rice,
a reasonable discrimination among candidate genes is
possible in a given QTL confidence interval of a few
pcM. In the case of physiological traits, candidate genes
may be a priori selected for validation due to the knowledge of the process under study [30]. Although such a
correlative approach does not establish direct causal
relationships, it must be emphasized that the chance to
find a random colocation between a QTL for the rather
simple traits considered in this manuscript and a gene
functionally related to the trait should be low. Nevertheless, the situation is different for more complex traits
involving multiple developmental or metabolic pathways

Page 14 of 22

and consequently a much larger number of candidate
genes. Using this approach, several candidates [39] were
identified and then validated through molecular and/or
genetic studies [40-42]. In the present case, obvious candidates for desiccation QTLs were LEA proteins and
aquaporins, whereas obvious candidates for ABA QTLs
were key enzymes of the ABA biosynthetic pathway,
such as NCED and ZEP, ABA responsive genes and corresponding transcription factors.
Kernel moisture and kernel weight are non independent variables. It was recently shown that maximum
kernel weight (MKW) may be predicted from maximum
water content (MWC) occurring at 40 to 60 DAP in
maize hybrids grown at three densities [1]. It was interpreted as meaning that maximum water content is an
essential determinant of kernel volume, e.g. of sink
capacity, which depends on early developmental events
taking place during the lag phase. This MKW/MWC
relationship was verified in the present parental lines
and the LHRF_F 3:4 population (data not shown),
explaining the high correlations observed between FW
and Water content and to a lesser extent FW and DW
at each DAP stage. However, it has no influence on kernel drying as shown by the absence of correlation in the
LHRF_F3:4 population between moisture content at harvest (%DW80) and final DW. The large observed variability in %DW, allowed detection of six QTLs explaining
ca. 50% of the variance with most fast desiccation alleles
contributed by parent 252. This was consistent with the
higher desiccation rate of F252 parental line. Interrogation of Maize GDB http://www.maizegdb.org showed
that the %DW60_4 and %DW80_5 QTLs mapped very
close to earlier reported QTLs for kernel moisture on
bins 5.02 and 9.04, respectively [43]. Comparison with
the more recently reported grain moisture and drying
rate QTLs [31] was difficult to assess because the map
used was not anchored to any reference map and the
QTL confidence intervals were very large. However,
striking similarities were observed at bins 1.04, 1.08 and
5.01 when positions were estimated proportionally to
the total length of each chromosome.
Candidate gene mapping and colocations with QTLs

To the best of our knowledge, before the present study,
QTLs for ABA content and water status have only been
searched in leaves of plants submitted to water stress
[39,44,45]. These QTLs were compared to those for
ABA content and water related traits in kernel by projecting all of the QTLs on the reference map. The major
root-ABA1 QTL identified near the RFLP marker csu133
on chromosome 2 (bin 2.04) [39,44,45] and affecting
root architecture and grain yield in maize [46], did not
colocate with the grain ABA QTLs detected in the same
chromosome region (Fig. 2, Table 2). Nevertheless,

For kernel, the LHRF_F3:4 segregating population derived from F2 × F252 crossing. For leaf, populations derived from Polj17 × F2 crossing [394445], high ABA ×

[394445], ABA concentration was determined in leaf samples from stressed plants irrigated with 50% normal rainfall during stem elongation and before anthesis.
Gene codes are detailed in Tables 3 and 4. Genes in bold were mapped by PCR in this study (Table 4 and Additional file 2). Genes involved in kernel drying and
located in the vicinity of the QTL confidence interval, are indicated in grey. ABA_embryo: [ABA] in embryo; ABA_endosperm: [ABA] in endosperm; ABAL: leaf

striking similarities were observed in ten other regions
(Table 5). Interestingly, among these ten regions, four
(bins 1.08-1.09, 4.06, 7.01-7.02 and 7.03) were detected
in all studies (one for kernel and three for leaves), the
common candidates being PIP (in three regions out of
four) and NCED (in two regions out of four) genes. The
coincidence of QTL locations between a source (leaf)
and a sink organ (kernel) strongly suggests that common genetic factors (genes) may control the trait at
each locus. In this respect, our finding that PIPs are the
most frequent candidate genes at the common loci is
important as the data indicate that they are good candidates for the regulation of kernel moisture. Of particular
interest is the observation that PIP1;2 and PIP2;1 are
highly expressed isoforms, which are associated with
water relations in both leaf [47] and kernel. By contrast,
NCED candidates only appeared in relation to QTLs for
leaf ABA content and not to QTLs for kernel ABA
content.
In addition to the above mentioned PIP and NCED
genes, our kernel specific QTLs revealed other candidates such as the ABI3-interacting protein 3 (AIP3) on
chromosome 1; ZEP1 and TIP2;1 on chromosome 2;
Viviparous1 (Vp1) on chromosome 3; the seed maturation protein 37 (PM37), the dehydrin WSI724 and the
ABA-insensitive protein phosphatase 2C 2 (ABI2) on

chromosome 4; Rab28, NCED5 and TIP2;2 on chromosome 5; Rehydrin and PSY3 on chromosome 7; Rab17
and CCD-EST on chromosome 9 (Tables 3 and 4). The
transcript patterns of LEA, aquaporin, NCED and ZEP
genes during kernel maturation and desiccation provided further help for the identification of potential candidates. Regarding the desiccation traits, the consistency
of Rab17, Rab28 and Emb5 genes as candidates was
supported by the fact that their transcript levels
increased from 40 to 80 DAP and was stronger in F252
than in F2, which was consistent with the positive effect
of F252 allele on desiccation. It is also notable that
ABA-responsive complex 3 found in Rab28 promoter
sequence [48] is transactivated by VP1, which colocates
with Slope_3 QTL. The situation was not as clear for
the aquaporins, although some PIP1 and PIP2 were very
frequently associated with QTLs for desiccation and
ABA content and PIP1 gene expression increased by the
end of the maturation phase. We suspect that specificity
problem linked to the high sequence similarity between
aquaporins led to cross-hybridization during RFLPbased mapping and/or non-specific amplifications in
RT-PCR experiments, because primers were designed
from the known 3’ UTR B73 sequences, which likely differ from that of F2 and F252. We are confident that the
emerging high throughput sequencing applied to

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

individual lines like F2 and F252 will give us the necessary tools to obtain clear-cut answers in the future.
Mapping, colocation and expression studies of the maize
NCED and ZEP gene families

Effort was made to determine the number of NCED and
ZEP genes in the maize genome, to map the genes on
the LHRF mapping panel and to determine their expression patterns in the kernel of both maize parental inbred
lines. The available data at the beginning of this work
were (1) the NCED1 (Vp14) genomic sequence from
B73, (2) the map positions of nine loci identified with a
NCED1 RFLP probe or similarly annotated probes and
(3) the mapping of four partial ZEP cDNAs at six loci.
In silico analysis of genomic sequences coupled with
PCR verification using genomic DNA and cDNA to confirm the contigs’ physical existence and expression of
sequence contigs, led to the identification of six NCED
and two ZEP genes in maize. These figures remain
minimum estimates based on the available data, but
they are consistent with other species, since five NCED
genes and a single copy ZEP gene have been found in
Arabidopsis and rice. The tree topology of NCED1related proteins suggests that at least four maize duplications might have occurred, one of which followed by
high divergence in the branch supporting more recent
duplicate NCED5 and NCED6 proteins. Additionally,
blast analysis of rice high throughput genomic
sequences revealed that maize ZEP1 and ZEP2 genes
were closer to each other than to the rice ZEP gene,
suggesting a maize specific duplication (data not
shown). Mapping of maize NCED genes led to the identification of six different loci, only three being common
to the nine previously reported loci. This highlights the
caution needed in the interpretation of colocations
between a QTL and a locus when the candidate gene
was mapped using RFLP probes. Similar situations were
found with ZEP genes since among the six loci identified with four partial ZEP-like cDNAs, only two were
confirmed in agreement with a recent report [37].
The comparison of the transcript expression profiles
of five of the six identified maize NCED genes shed new
light on the relative autonomy of the embryo and the
endosperm compartments. Accordingly, the expression
patterns were independent in the endosperm and the
embryo whatever the gene tested, suggesting different
regulatory mechanisms. This was consistent with the
absence of any correlation between ABA content or its
time course in endosperm and embryo. The most
strongly expressed maize NCED transcripts were
NCED1 (Vp14) and NCED6 in embryo and endosperm,
respectively. The higher expression of NCED1 in the
embryo may explain why the vp14 mutation produced
both a viviparous phenotype (vivipary being a property
of the embryo) and a kernel ABA deficiency (the

Page 16 of 22

embryo being far much richer in ABA than the endosperm). However, the NCED1 locus did not colocate
with embryo ABA QTLs, although it colocated with leaf
ABA QTLs. A way to interpret this inconsistency in the
kernel would be to assume that NCED1 is not limiting
or provides a coarse control. The plausible existence of
such a coarse control is consistent with the coincidence
between maximum ABA accumulation and maximum
NCED1 transcript level in the embryo at 60 DAP. An
additional finer control might explain the genotype differences. It is noticeable that only NCED5 colocated
with a QTL for ABA (ABAembryo40_3), this colocation
being consistent with the fact that NCED5 transcript
level was higher in the embryo than in the endosperm.
Nevertheless, the low transcript level and the moderate
R2 associated with the QTL value might undermine the
significance of this finding. Similarly to NCED5, and
NCED6, ZEP transcript levels were significantly different
in both genotypes and both tissues at 40 DAP. The
expression of both maize ZEP genes was prevalent in
the endosperm and higher in F252 line than in F2 line,
ZEP1 being more strongly expressed than ZEP2. Interestingly, ZEP1 colocated with two QTLs for ABA content in the embryo at 30 and 40 DAP and one QTL for
ABA content in endosperm at 40 DAP.
Effect of ABA content on the genetic control of kernel
desiccation

The potential role of ABA content on the genetic control of kernel desiccation was supported by numerous
colocations between QTLs for both traits. The colocation of QTL for desiccation with ABA-responsive genes
and LEA genes also known to be controlled by ABA
provided further support, although it did not establish a
triggering role of ABA on drying. To prove such a link,
one would need to be able to ectopically manipulate
ABA content in different parts of the kernel and examine the effect on desiccation. To this end, the genes controlling ABA content in grain must first be identified.
NCED and ZEP genes which were the first to be shown
to have a key role in ABA biosynthesis seemed good
candidates prior to this study. However, among the 15
regions grouping the 20 ABA QTLs, only four QTLs
colocated with NCED5 and ZEP1 loci. As previously
mentioned, NCED5 was expressed at a lower level than
NCED1, which did not colocate with any ABA QTLs,
and both ZEP1 and ZEP2 genes were mainly expressed
in endosperm in which ABA levels was much lower
than in embryo. This can be interpreted as an indication
that the control of ABA levels is unlikely to be determined by transcript expression. Post-transcriptional regulation should be checked by measuring NCED and
ZEP protein levels as well as their enzyme activities.
Other biosynthetic and/or other regulatory may also be
considered. However, none of the newly reported

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

regulator Vp8, Vp10/Vp13 and Vp15 genes [25-27] colocated with the presently detected ABA QTLs. It is
noticeable that PSY3 gene colocated with ABA_endosperm_80_1 QTL on chromosome 7. Nevertheless, the
low levels of PSY3 transcripts in maize endosperm [37]
might undermine the significance of this finding. On the
other hand, the genetic control of ABA content in leaf
seems to present similarities to that in kernel as shown
by the striking number of ABA QTLs of common loci
between the two organs. Therefore, shared QTL loci
and candidates merit special attention in future work,
although the control is seemingly more complex in
grain than in leaf.

Conclusions
This study showed that kernel drying in field condition
is genetically controlled. QTLs for kernel water status
were frequently associated with QTLs for ABA content
in embryo and/or endosperm, providing tools for marker assisted selection. In addition, striking colocations
were found between the presently mapped QTLs for
water status and ABA concentration in kernel and those
previously reported in leaf for the same traits. Five novel
NCED genes were identified and mapped. Phylogenetic
analysis established homologies with rice genes. Unexpectedly, it was difficult to establish a causal relationship
between the expression of individual members of the
maize NCED and ZEP gene family and ABA QTL effect,
although a few colocations between these genes and
QTLs for ABA were detected. Among the other candidate genes mapped, colocations occurred for aquaporins, LEA and ABA-responsive genes and QTLs for kernel
desiccation, indicating the potential interest of these
genes for breeding and highlighting the necessity to validate them through transgenesis and association genetics.
Methods
Plant population and growing conditions

The population used was obtained by performing four
generations of random intermating in the F2 population
derived from the maize F2 × F252 hybrid. Random mating was performed by crossing two plants taken at random. Each plant being used only once, between 80 and
100 crosses were done at each generation to produce
the next one. This was followed by one generation of
selfing to produce a generation equivalent to F 3
(LHRF_F3) in terms of genotypic frequencies. Each plant
was again selfed to derive LHRF_F 3:4 families (Y.F.
Huang, D. Madur, V. Combes, C. L. Ky, P. Bertin, A.
Charcosset, L. Moreau, in preparation). The parental
lines and the whole LHRF_F3:4 population (322 families)
were grown in the field at Gif-sur-Yvette, France, in
April 2001, in rows (25 plants per rows, one row per
family and two rows per parental line). Among the 322

Page 17 of 22

grown families, 153 were sampled 120, 300, 400, 600
and 800 degree × day (cumulated average day temperature above a 6°C basis) after flowering for analyzing
time course of desiccation and ABA content. At each
stage, two plants per row were sampled for the
LHRF_F3:4 families. For the parents, three plants in each
of the two rows were sampled. We used a thermal scale
to compensate for the difference in the dates of plant
pollination between genotypes (from July 10th to August
1st, 2001). This scale corresponded to 12, 30, 40, 60 and
80 DAP for the year 2001, thus for simplification all the
results were presented as DAP on a 2001 basis. At each
date, 20 grains were sampled in the median part of the
ear from two plants in each line. They were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Statistical analysis of the data (mean, standard error
and principal component analysis PCA) were performed
using StatBox-Pro package (Grimmersoft, version 6.6,
Issy Les Moulineaux, France)
Kernel desiccation measurement

FW (mg/kernel) and DW (mg/kernel) were measured on
five kernels and the four following variables were calculated: i) Water: absolute kernel water content = FWDW (mg/kernel); ii) %DW: = DW/FW × 100, this variable mirrored relative water content; iii) Slope: regression line slope of (Water/FW × 100) as a function of
thermal time between 30 and 80 DAP; iv) Rate =
(Water/FW × 100)/(thermal time interval) between two
sampling dates.
ABA content measurement

Embryo and endosperm were separated from the pericarp and treated with two slightly different extraction
protocols to optimise grinding efficiency. The embryos
were ground with two stainless beads (3 mm diameter)
at 20 Hz during 2 fold 30 s and the powder was lyophilized for 24 h. Then, 15 mg were placed in 200 μL distilled water and the slurry was agitated for 48 h at 4°C
in the dark. This procedure prevented the formation of
a lipid-powder mixture impeding ABA extraction. The
whole kernels or the endosperms were lyophilized and
ground with 2 stainless beads (7 mm diameter) at 20 Hz
during 2 fold 30 s. Two or three aliquots of 250 mg
were suspended in 700 μL distillated water for 48 h at
4°C in the dark. All samples were then centrifuged
(12,000 g, 10 min) for clarification and the supernatants
were used directly for radioimmuno assay (RIA) measurement as previously described. The monoclonal antibody used is only directed against the non-glycosylated
ABA form [49]. Values were expressed as ABA content
in pg per mg of FW, pg per mg of DW or pg per mg
kernel water.
QTL mapping

The map used for QTL detection was established using
the whole population of 322 LHFR_F3:4 families (Y.F.

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

Huang, D. Madur, V. Combes, C. L. Ky, P. Bertin, A.
Charcosset, L. Moreau, in preparation). Briefly, leaves of
each LHRF_F3:4 family (pool of 5 to 20 plants) were harvested to perform genomic DNA isolation, digestion and
hybridization for RFLPs and amplified fragment length
polymorphisms as previously described [50]. All the
lines were characterized for 78 RFLP and 280 SSR markers. Genetic map was constructed using MAPMAKER
3.0b [51]. The genetic distances were calculated with
Haldane mapping function. Because the LHFR_F 3:4
population was regarded as a conventional F3 population
(ignoring the generations of random intermating), those
distances were not expressed in “true” cM and were
referred to pcM. The linkage map included 358 markers
with a total length of 5568.3 pcM and an average distance of 16 pcM between adjacent markers. By comparison with the map of a conventional F 3 population
derived from the same parental lines, the map expansion
factor was estimated to be 2.63 on average over the
whole genome (Y.F. Huang, D. Madur, V. Combes, C. L.
Ky, P. Bertin, A. Charcosset, L. Moreau, in preparation).
The QTL detection was performed using composite
interval mapping method implemented in the Plabqtl
software [52]. Stepwise method was used for covariable
identification using the “cov Select” option of the software. The LOD curve shape obtained with the “cov
Select” option is strongly affected by the choice of cofactors, leading to artificially narrow peaks in the vicinity of
covariate position, which is not appropriate to estimate
QTL confidence intervals based on the one-LOD unit
fall method. Therefore, confidence intervals, allele effect
and individual R2 of each QTL were estimated in a second step using the “cov-” option, which removes the
markers located on the chromosome being analysed
from the set of covariables initially selected by the “cov
Select” option. The QTL detection threshold and the
entry threshold for covariables were set respectively at
LOD = 2 and P = 0.005.
To evaluate the risks associated with these threshold
values, classical permutations were performed to determine the probability of the maximum of the test statistics under the null hypothesis (absence of any QTL in
the genome). Maximum LOD values of 2.0, 2.36, 2.45,
2.88, 3.21 and 3.98 correspond to a genomewide type I
risks of 0.5, 0.3, 0.25, 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.
The use of intermated recombinant inbred population
increases the equivalent number of independent tests
(over the genome) compared to conventional segregating populations and therefore increases the genomewide
type I risk associated to a given LOD value. As such, a
LOD 2 value can be considered as being permissive
since it corresponds to a genomewide type I error risk
of 0.5. Nevertheless, it corresponds to a low individual
type I risk of 0.0025. Because we were looking for

Page 18 of 22

colocation between QTLs and candidate genes, even a
colocation between a sub-significant QTL and a gene
might be of interest especially if several QTL related to
similar traits were also colocating. Therefore, we considered QTL with LOD > 2 in colocation analysis and carefully checked that each QTL region displayed at least
one QTL with lower individual P values. The genomewide significance level of each QTL was indicated in
Tables 2 and 3. The presently used unreplicated design
was chosen to optimize the power of the QTL detection
given the number of phenotypical observations, which
are very labour intensive for the physiological traits of
interest such as ABA content.
Colocation between QTLs and candidate genes

Colocations between QTLs and candidate genes were
based on manual search of the genes related to kernel
desiccation and ABA biosynthesis in the confidence
interval of each QTL. In order to have the most exhaustive list of mapped genes, the consensus
REFMAP050110 (IBM_Gnp2004) framework map
http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/GnpMap was used [50]. It
contains ESTs, genes and QTLs mapped in the French
plant genomics programme ‘Génoplante’. The QTLs
detected in the LHRF_F 3:4 population (LHREF3_1201
map) were projected on the REFMAP050110 using BioMercator software [34]. Data mining was performed
using the tools set up by ‘Génoplante’ http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/, which yields the list and genetic coordinates of the genes or ESTs reported in the vicinity of
the QTLs. Because of the use of intermated recombinant inbred lines, appropriate conversion was performed
to compute actual cM from map coordinates obtained
with MapMaker [32].
Maize NCED and ZEP gene mapping

Based on Arabidopsis and rice sequences, putative
NCED and ZEP coding sequences in maize were identified by Blast searches of EST assemblies in The Gene
Index data base http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/
plant.html, assemblies of genomic DNA fragments at
The Institute for Genomic Research http://www.tigr.org/
plantProjects.shtml and genomic sequences from BAC
clones http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS. The members of the maize NCED and ZEP gene families suggested from these combined in silico analyses were
confirmed by sequencing of amplified cDNA and gDNA
which specific primers. Maize ZEP genes were annotated
using yrGATE at PlantGDB http://www.plantgdb.org/
prj/yrGATE/, yrGATE_Zm2 gZEP1 is substantially the
same as GRMZM2G127139_T01). The yrGATE_Zm10
gZEP2 annotation is incomplete since the last version of
the maize HTGS database is not currently included.
Therefore, both maize ZEP1 and ZEP2 genes are also
shown in Additional file 3, which was based on the
alignment of rice and maize ZEP genes and constructed

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

using gbioseq http://www.bioinformatics.org/project/?
group_id=94. The maize NCED and ZEP genes were
then mapped on the LHRF or IBM mapping panels
using the LHRF_Gnp2004 or REFMAP050110
(IBM_Gnp2004) framework map, respectively [50].
LHRF is an intermated recombinant inbred line population derived from the cross between maize F2 and F252
inbred lines. IBM is an intermated recombinant inbred
line population derived from the cross between maize
B73 and Mo17 inbred lines http://www.maizegdb.org. It
was used in the absence of polymorphism between F2
and F252 [53]. Genotyping was PCR-based as previously
described [50]. Primers used for mapping maize ZEP
and NCED genes are shown in Additional file 2. Gene
positions obtained on LHRF_Gnp2004 map were then
projected on the REFMAP050110 map using BioMercator software [34].
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR

Gene expression patterns using RT-PCR were determined as previously described [54]. In these end point
analyses, the cycle number was adjusted to yield nonsaturated bands for samples with low expression. Primers used for RT-PCR analyses are shown in Additional
file 2. They were designed based on Gene Bank data
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/ for aquaporins
using the accession numbers provided in [11] and based
on the maize EST assembly produced by GenoplanteInfo and now housed at the URGI http://urgi.versailles.
inra.fr/GnpSeq/ for LEA, RAB and other maturationrelated genes.
For qRT-PCR, RNA isolation was carried out essentially as previously described [54]. Briefly, tissues were
ground to powder under liquid nitrogen and transferred
to a tube containing equal volumes of extraction buffer
(200 mM Tris-HCl pH 9, 400 mM KCl, 200 mM
sucrose, 35 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM EGTA) and phenol/
chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (pH 8) and vortexed for 30
s. The resulting supernatant collected after centrifugation (15,000 g, 10 min at 15°C) was re-extracted twice
with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then precipitated 20 min at -80°C by addition of 1 M acetic acid
(0.1 volume) and 100% ethanol (2.5 volumes). The RNA
pellet collected after centrifugation (15,000 g, 30 min at
4°C) was washed with 3 M Na-acetate (pH 5.2) and resuspended in water. A second acetic acid/ethanol precipitation was performed before final re-suspension in
water. RNA was treated with RNase free DNase and the
DNAse inactivated according to the instructions of the
supplier (Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). RNA was quantified in a spectrophotometer at
260 nm and its quality was assessed by gel analysis and
260/280 and 260/230 nm spectrophotometric ratios.
Total RNA (5 μg) was used as a template to synthesize
cDNA using 0.5 μg oligo dT primers (Invitrogen, Breda,

Page 19 of 22

The Netherlands), 100 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and 40 units of recombinant Rnasin ribonuclease
inhibitor (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) in a final
volume of 20 μl.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with 10 μl
of 1:50 (v/v) dilution of the first cDNA strands synthesized as described above using the 7500HT real-time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
and the SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each
reaction was performed in duplicate and the real-time
experiment was repeated two times. The absence of
genomic DNA and primer dimers was confirmed by
analysis of RT-minus and water control samples and by
examination of dissociation curves. The change in fluorescence for each sample was analyzed using 7500 realtime PCR system sequence detection software 1.3.1
(Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences were designed
using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). PCR
products for candidate genes were sequenced to confirm
their identity. Genes and primers used for qRT-PCR
analyses are shown in Tables 4 and Additional file 2.
Transcript levels were normalized with the values
obtained for the housekeeping Zeastar gene (accession
number AC196679), which was used as an internal
reference gene. The fold change of transcript abundance
of candidate genes was first calculated as 2-ΔCt, where
ΔCt is the number of PCR cycles required to reach the
log phase of amplification for the target gene minus the
same measure for Zeastar. Transcript abundance of
maize NCED3 in embryo at 40 DAP was adjusted to
100% and fold changes of transcripts from other genes
were normalized via comparison with that of maize
NCED3. A Log transformation of the expression data
was then performed because the standard error values
showed that the standard error increased in proportion
to the treatment. Log-transformed values were used for
two-way ANOVA analyses, using R software version
2.8.1. A F-test for interactions was performed to determine whether the additive model could be retained
[55,56]. This additive model corresponds to a multiplicative model for the initial non-transformed values, with a,
b, la and lb being the four values of the multiplicative
model. When the additive model could not be retained,
the Bonferroni method was applied for pairwise comparisons (see Additional file 3 for calculations). The significance was placed at a 0.05 level.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Amino acid sequences of open reading frames were
initially aligned using ClustalW [57] with the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor 4.8.8 [58]. For the phylogenetic analysis, the N-terminal portions of the proteins
were omitted because of the difficulty of confidently
assessing primary homology among these sequences.

Capelle et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/2

After the N-terminal regions, the NCED sequences
share high degrees of similarity. These regions were
therefore included in the phylogenetic analyses which
were performed using the maximum Likelihood method
with PHYML v2.4.4 [59]. JTT was used as the substitution model with four substitution rate categories, the
gamma parameter being estimated from the data. Node
support was assessed through 500 bootstraps. A dendrogram was constructed using TreeView 1.5.2 http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/rod.html.

Additional file 3: Identification of two ZEP genes in maize. The rice
ZEP gene (Os04 g0448900; black) was used in BLAST analysis to identify
five putative homologs from maize (The Institute for Genomic Research
ID OGAGIC79TC, AZM5_13314, AZM5_13316, AZM5_24223, AZM_13312
and AZM5_13315; light brown). Maize ESTs were found for all this maize
genomic contigs, except for AZM5_13315. Sequencing of amplified
gDNA and cDNA with specific primers showed that ZEP is encoded by
only two genes in maize (deduced CDS indicated in blue). This was
confirmed using the maize HTGS database (maize ZEP1, [GenBank:
AC194845.3]; maize ZEP2, [GenBank:AC206194.3]; brown) and in
agreement with recent reports [394445]. We used yrGATE at PlantGDB
http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/yrGATE to annotate both genes(maize ZEP1:

gZEP2 gene annotation is incomplete since the last version of the maize
HTGS database is not currently included in the software).
