Abstract
Background: The Streptophyta comprise all land plants and six monophyletic groups of charophycean green
algae. Phylogenetic analyses of four genes from three cellular compartments support the following branching
order for these algal lineages: Mesostigmatales, Chlorokybales, Klebsormidiales, Zygnematales, Coleochaetales
and Charales, with the last lineage being sister to land plants. Comparative analyses of the Mesostigma viride
(Mesostigmatales) and land plant chloroplast genome sequences revealed that this genome experienced many
gene losses, intron insertions and gene rearrangements during the evolution of charophyceans. On the other
hand, the chloroplast genome of Chaetosphaeridium globosum (Coleochaetales) is highly similar to its land plant
counterparts in terms of gene content, intron composition and gene order, indicating that most of the features
characteristic of land plant chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) were acquired from charophycean green algae. To gain
further insight into when the highly conservative pattern displayed by land plant cpDNAs originated in the
Streptophyta, we have determined the cpDNA sequences of the distantly related zygnematalean algae Staurastrum
punctulatum and Zygnema circumcarinatum.
Results: The 157,089 bp Staurastrum and 165,372 bp Zygnema cpDNAs encode 121 and 125 genes, respectively.
Although both cpDNAs lack an rRNA-encoding inverted repeat (IR), they are substantially larger than
Chaetosphaeridium and land plant cpDNAs. This increased size is explained by the expansion of intergenic spacers
and introns. The Staurastrum and Zygnema genomes differ extensively from one another and from their
streptophyte counterparts at the level of gene order, with the Staurastrum genome more closely resembling its
land plant counterparts than does Zygnema cpDNA. Many intergenic regions in Zygnema cpDNA harbor tandem
repeats. The introns in both Staurastrum (8 introns) and Zygnema (13 introns) cpDNAs represent subsets of those
found in land plant cpDNAs. They represent 16 distinct insertion sites, only five of which are shared by the two
zygnematalean genomes. Three of these insertions sites have not been identified in Chaetosphaeridium cpDNA.
Conclusion: The chloroplast genome experienced substantial changes in overall structure, gene order, and
intron content during the evolution of the Zygnematales. Most of the features considered earlier as typical of land
plant cpDNAs probably originated before the emergence of the Zygnematales and Coleochaetales.

Background
About 450 million years ago, green algae belonging to the
class Charophyceae emerged from their aquatic habitat to
colonize the land [1-3]. This important event in the history of life gave rise to all the land plant species that make
up the flora of our planet. The few thousand species of
charophycean green algae that are alive today exhibit great
variability in cellular organization and reproduction [4].
With the land plants, they form the green plant lineage
Streptophyta [5], whereas all other green algae (more than
10,000 species), with perhaps the exception of Mesostigma
viride, belong to the sister lineage Chlorophyta [4]. Five
monophyletic groups of charophycean green algae have
been recognized: the Chlorokybales, Klebsormidiales,
Zygnematales, Coleochaetales and Charales [6], given
here in order of increasing cellular complexity. Mesostigma
may represent an additional lineage of the Charophyceae,
the Mesostigmatales, as indicated by phylogenetic studies
that placed this unicellular green alga at the base of the
Streptophyta [7-10]. This lineage, however, remains controversial, considering that separate analyses based on a
large number of chloroplast- or mitochondrial-encoded
proteins [11-13] and on the chloroplast small and large
subunit rRNA genes [14] identified Mesostigma before the
divergence of the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta.
On the basis of morphological characters alone, the two
charophycean groups that exhibit the greatest cellular
complexity, i.e. the Charales and Coleochaetales, have
been proposed to be the closest relatives of land plants
[15,16]. Recent analyses of the combined sequences of
four genes from the nucleus (small subunit rRNA gene),
chloroplast (atpB and rbcL) and mitochondria (nad5) of
25 charophycean green algae and eight green plants
revealed that the Charales and land plants form a highly
supported clade; however, moderate bootstrap support
was observed for the positions of the other charophycean
groups [8]. The best trees inferred by Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods in this four-gene analysis support an evolutionary trend toward increasing cellular
complexity [17]. In contrast, all phylogenies of charophycean green algae previously inferred from a smaller
number of genes failed to provide any conclusive results
concerning the branching order of the charophycean
green algae and their relationships with land plants
[15,16].
We have recently undertaken the sequencing of complete
chloroplast genomes from representatives of the various
charophycean lineages in order to elucidate the branching
order of these lineages and also to understand the evolution of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) within the Streptophyta. We have reported thus far the cpDNA sequences of
Mesostigma (Mesostigmatales) [11] and Chaetosphaeridium
globosum (Coleochaetales) [18]. Comparative analyses of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/22

the Mesostigma cpDNA sequence (136 genes, no introns)
with its land plant counterparts (110–120 genes, about 20
introns) revealed that the chloroplast genome underwent
substantial changes in its architecture during the evolution of streptophytes (namely gene losses, intron insertions and scrambling of gene order). At the levels of gene
content (125 genes), intron composition (18 introns) and
gene order, Chaetosphaeridium cpDNA is remarkably similar to land plant cpDNAs, implying that most of the features characteristic of land plant lineages were acquired
from charophycean green algae. Like the cpDNAs of many
chlorophytes, those of Mesostigma, Chaetosphaeridium and
most land plant species exhibit a quadripartite structure
that is characterized by the presence of two copies of a
rDNA-containing inverted repeat (IR) separated by large
and small single-copy regions. All the genes they have in
common, with a few exceptions, reside in corresponding
genomic regions.
In this study, we report the complete cpDNA sequences of
two members of the Zygnematales that belong to distinct
lineages, Staurastrum punctulatum and Zygnema circumcarinatum. Although the chloroplast genomes of these charophycean
green
algae
closely
resemble
their
Chaetosphaeridium and bryophyte counterparts at the primary sequence and gene content levels, they feature substantial differences at the levels of structure, gene order
and intron content. Like the cpDNA of the zygnematalean
alga Spirogyra maxima [19], both Staurastrum and Zygnema
cpDNAs lack a large IR. Clearly, loss of the IR appears to
be a major event that shaped the architecture of the chloroplast genome in the Zygnematales, an event that apparently occurred early during the evolution of this group of
charophycean green algae.

Results
Selection of taxa
The Zygnematales as circumscribed by Bold and Wynne
[20] comprise the green algae whose mode of sexual
reproduction is conjugation. This is the most important
charophycean lineage in terms of diversity and number of
species (~50 genera and ~6,000 species) [16]. Classification schemes based on cell wall organization have recognized two groups of conjugating green algae: first, the
unicellular or multicellular green algae with an ornamented and segmented cell wall, also called placoderm
desmids and often treated as members of the order Desmidiales, and second, the green algae that bear a smooth
cell wall, which are often classified separately in the Zygnematales [21]. Among the latter group are found filamentous forms and the saccoderm desmids that consist
either of unicells or loosely joined cells. Phylogenies
inferred using rbcL [21] or the combined rbcL and nuclear
small subunit rRNA genes [22] support the monophyly of
placoderm desmids and place the filamentous and

BMC Biology 2005, 3:22

saccoderm desmids together in a distinct monophyletic
group. For our study, we have selected a representative of
each of these two monophyletic groups: Staurastrum is a
unicellular, placoderm desmid, whereas Zygnema is a filamentous green alga with a non-ornamented cell wall.
General features
The 157,089-bp Staurastrum [GenBank:AY958085] and
165,372-bp Zygnema [GenBank:AY958086] cpDNAs map
as circular molecules containing 121 and 125 genes,
respectively (Fig. 1). Both genomes lack a rDNA-containing IR and no remnant of such a sequence could be
detected during our analysis of repeated elements. All
genes are present in single copy, with the exception of the
duplicated Zygnema trnE(uuc) gene, the sequences of
which differ at two positions. Note that the matK gene was
not included in the total number of genes calculated for
Zygnema cpDNA, because this gene occurs as an intron
ORF in all other streptophytes where it has been identified. Aside from the absence of the IR, the most prominent
differences displayed by the two zygnematalean cpDNAs
relative to their counterparts in Chaetosphaeridium [18]
and land plants (here represented by the bryophyte
Marchantia polymorpha [23]) are their larger size (taking
into consideration the absence of the IR from these
genomes) and their smaller number of cis-spliced group II
introns (Table 1). The larger size of zygnematalean cpDNAs is mainly explained by the expansion of intergenic
spacers (Table 2). The latter sequences represent 42% of
the genome in both Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs
compared to about 20% in Chaetosphaeridium and land
plant cpDNAs. Introns have also expanded in size in both
zygnematalean cpDNAs compared to their Chaetosphaeridium and land plant homologues (Table 2).
Gene content
Table 3 compares the gene contents of Staurastrum, Zygnema, Chaetosphaeridium and Marchantia cpDNAs. The
two zygnematalean cpDNAs share 120 genes, 116 of
which are present in both Chaetosphaeridium and Marchantia cpDNAs. Five genes in Zygnema cpDNA are missing
from Staurastrum cpDNA; they encode the tRNAPro(GGG),
tRNASer(CGA), ribosomal protein L5, and the proteins
CysA and CysT that are involved in sulfate transport.
Although there is no functional trnS(cga) in Staurastrum
cpDNA, a trnS(cga) pseudogene was identified in this
genome. A standard acceptor stem could not be modelled
from the RNA sequence derived from this pseudogene; the
5' region of this sequence diverges considerably from
homologous tRNA sequences in other streptophytes and
cannot base pair with the 3' region. Staurastrum exhibits
only one chloroplast gene (rpl22) that is missing from
Zygnema. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
loss of rpl22 together with that of rpl32 (a gene absent
from both zygnematalean cpDNAs) has been reported in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/22

the Streptophyta. As in land plant cpDNAs, but in contrast
to Chaetosphaeridium cpDNA, no tufA-like sequence was
detected in the two zygnematalean cpDNAs. It appears
that only the chlI, odpB and ycf62 genes were specifically
lost just before or concurrently with the emergence of land
plants (Table 3). Note that the rps16 gene cannot be
included in this category, as it is present in the majority of
land plant cpDNAs sequenced to date.
Gene order
Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs differ substantially
from one another and from their Chaetosphaeridium and
land plant counterparts at the level of gene organization
(Table 4). Eighty-two genes in the two zygnematalean
cpDNAs form 22 blocks of colinear sequences, which are
highly scrambled in order (Fig. 1). A minimum of 59
inversions would be required to convert the gene order of
Staurastrum cpDNA into that of Zygnema cpDNA (Table
4).

Of the two zygnematalean cpDNAs, that showing the
most similar gene arrangement with its Chaetosphaeridium
and land plant counterparts is Staurastrum cpDNA (Table
4). In both Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs, the gene
organization more closely resembles that of Marchantia
than that of Chaetosphaeridium (Table 4). Staurastrum
cpDNA shares with its Marchantia counterpart 22 blocks
of colinear sequences that contain a total of 101 genes,
whereas Zygnema cpDNA shares 20 blocks featuring 81
genes (Fig. 1). Close inspection of these blocks relative to
those conserved between Mesostigma and Marchantia cpDNAs [11] reveals that 13 ancestral gene clusters, including
those containing the rDNA, atpA, psbB and rpoB operons,
were fragmented at 27 sites during the evolution of the
Zygnematales (Fig. 2). Eleven of these rearrangement
breakpoints are common to the two green algal cpDNAs,
whereas 2 and 14 breakpoints are unique to Staurastrum
and Zygnema cpDNAs, respectively. Assuming that these
unique rearrangement breakpoints appeared after the
divergence of the two zygnematalean species, we infer that
the chloroplast genome of the common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema shared a number of derived gene
clusters with Chaetosphaeridium and land plants. For
example, the cluster of 29 genes extending from petL to
trnI(cau) in Marchantia cpDNA and that of 13 genes
delimited by rps12b and atpI were likely present in the
common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema. Only four
gene clusters are shared specifically between zygnematalean and Marchantia cpDNAs: rps4-trnS(gga)-ycf3 (cluster
9 in Fig. 1), atpB-atpE-trnV(uac)-trnMe(cau)-ndhC-ndhKndhJ (cluster 15), trnH(gug)-ftsH-trnD(guc) (in Staurastrum only), and trnE(uuc)-cysA-trnT(ggu) (in Zygnema
only).

The higher degree of ancestral characters displayed by
Staurastrum cpDNA compared to its Zygnema homologue
at the gene organizational level is also evident when one
examines the genomic region in which each gene locus
would be expected to map if the IR had been retained (Fig.
3). In Staurastrum cpDNA, the 15 genes predicted to have
been present in the small single-copy region occupy a discrete region just beside five of the eight genes that usually
make up the IR; in Zygnema cpDNA, however, the genes

usually located in the small single-copy region and the IR
are more widely dispersed in the genome.
Intron composition
As in Chaetosphaeridium cpDNA, the introns in Staurastrum
and Zygnema cpDNAs represent subsets of those found in
land plant cpDNAs (Fig. 4). Both zygnematalean cpDNAs
share with their Chaetosphaeridium and land plant counterparts one group I intron in trnL(uaa), two cis-spliced

group II introns in rpl16 and trnG(ucc), and one transspliced group II intron in rps12. Only three group II
introns in Staurastrum and/or Zygnema cpDNAs (in atpF,
rps12 at site 346 and ycf3) have no homologues in Chaetosphaeridium cpDNA. Evidence for a charophycean green
algal origin of land plant group II introns is lacking for
only the clpP intron at site 363. The Staurastrum transspliced rps12 intron resembles its Chaetosphaeridium
homologue in exhibiting a large ORF in domain IV. The
putative protein of 404 amino acids encoded by the Staurastrum ORF is related to reverse transcriptases, whereas
the smaller protein (247 amino acids) specified by the
Chaetosphaeridium ORF lacks similarity with such
proteins.
Like its Chaetosphaeridium and land plant counterparts,
the cis-spliced group II intron in Staurastrum trnK(uuu)
encodes the maturase MatK. As mentioned earlier, a freestanding matK gene was identified in Zygnema cpDNA
even though an intron is absent from trnK(uuu) in this
charophycean green alga. Close inspection of the regions

immediately flanking the Zygnema matK gene for the presence of sequences conserved in domains V and VI of
group II introns failed to reveal any evidence that this gene
had once been an integral part of a group II intron. The
Zygnema matK is most probably a functional gene because
its predicted protein features the vast majority of the conserved amino acids that the trnK intron-encoded MatK of
Staurastrum shares with its Chaetosphaeridium, Chara,
Nitella and land plant homologues (Fig. 5).
Repeated sequences
Comparison of each zygnematalean cpDNA sequence
against itself using PipMaker [24] indicated the presence
of repeats in many intergenic regions of Zygnema cpDNA
and the virtual absence of such sequences from Staurastrum cpDNA. Analysis of the Zygnema genome sequence
with REPuter [25] revealed that the great majority of the
repeat regions larger than 30 bp are composed of short
tandem repeats. Each of the 35 repeat regions identified
consists of 4 to 16 bp units that are repeated in tandem 4
to 50 times (Table 5). Most regions (29/35) feature repeat

units of 4 or 5 bp, and the regions with GTAT, ATAC,
TAGAA, TTCTA and CTTA units occur at more than one
location on the chloroplast genome (Fig. 1). All three
regions carrying the CTTA units feature sequences that are
in direct orientation relative to one another; however, the
13 regions with the GTAT and complementary ATAC units
and the four regions with the TAGAA and complementary
TTCTA units form a population of dispersed repeats that
are in direct or inverted orientation relative to one
another. Eighty percent of the repeat regions (28/35)
reside outside the blocks of sequences that are colinear
with Staurastrum cpDNA. We estimate that at least 2,245
bp of Zygnema cpDNA, i.e. about 60% of the increased
size of the Zygnema intergenic regions compared to their
Staurastrum homologues, are accounted for by short tandem repeats.
Only two loci of the Staurastrum chloroplast genome contain short tandem repeats: a region composed of four
units of the GAATAAATA sequence in the infA-rpl36 spacer
and a region containing nine units of the GTATTT

sequence in the rps16-odpB spacer. Aside from two copies
of 45-bp sequence (in the atpF-atpH and atpH-rps14 spacers) that are in direct orientation, no dispersed repeats
larger than 30 bp were detected in Staurastrum cpDNA.

Discussion
Although Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs bear high
similarity in primary sequence and gene content to their
Chaetosphaeridium and land plant counterparts, they differ
substantially from one another and from the latter
genomes in overall structure, gene order and intron content. From our comparative analysis of streptophyte cpDNAs, we infer that the chloroplast genome of the last
common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema probably
lacked a large IR encoding the rRNA genes, had a low gene
density, and more closely resembled Chaetosphaeridium
and land plant cpDNAs at the gene organizational and
intron levels than do Zygnema and Staurastrum cpDNAs.
At least 16 of the 22 intron positions commonly found in
land plant cpDNAs, including three sites that have not

been identified in Chaetosphaeridium, were probably
present in the common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema.
Considering the absence of an rDNA-encoding IR region
in both Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs, it is not
surprising that these genomes are considerably rearranged
relative to their coleochaetalean and land plants counterparts that have retained the quadripartite structure. All
green plant cpDNAs that have lost the IR tend to be highly
scrambled in gene order [26,27]. It has been hypothesized
that the loss of the IR enhances opportunities for intramolecular recombination between small dispersed repeats
[28]. In agreement with the idea that there is a direct link
between the frequency of intramolecular recombination
events and the abundance of small dispersed repeats [28],
we identified more rearrangements in the repeat-rich
genome of Zygnema than in the repeat-poor genome of
Staurastrum. As in the cpDNAs of the nonphotosynthetic,
parasitic flowering plant Epifagus virginiana [29] and the
evening primrose Oenothera [30], the repeated sequences
in Zygnema cpDNA consist essentially of tandem repeats
that probably arose by replication slippage.

Distributions of introns in streptophyte cpDNAs
Distributions of introns in streptophyte cpDNAs. Circles denote the presence of group I introns, and squares
denote the presence of group II introns. Divided squares represent trans-spliced group II introns. Open symbols denote
the absence of intron ORFs, whereas filled symbols denote
their presence. Intron insertion sites in protein-coding and
tRNA genes are given relative to the corresponding genes in
Mesostigma cpDNA; the insertion site in rrl is given relative
to the Escherichia coli 23S rRNA. For each insertion site, the
position corresponding to the nucleotide immediately preceding the intron is reported. Note that rps16 is lacking in
Marchantia cpDNA and that the rrl intron at position 2593 is
absent from all completely sequenced land plant cpDNAs,
with the exception of Anthoceros cpDNA. The intron data
were taken from the following accession numbers: Staurastrum, [GenBank:AY958085]; Zygnema, [GenBank:AY958086];
Chaetosphaeridium, [GenBank:NC_004115]; Marchantia,
[GenBank:NC_001319]; and Anthoceros formosae [GenBank:NC_004543].

A single event of IR loss likely accounts for the absence of
a quadripartite structure from both Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs. This hypothesis is more parsimonious
than the alternative scenario involving two independent
losses, and is consistent with previous evidence that the
cpDNA of Spirogyra (a distant relative of Zygnema) has no
IR [19]. It is also supported by our finding that Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs share 11 rearrangement breakpoints within ancestral gene clusters. Given the close
connection between IR loss and gene rearrangements, several of these shared breakpoints might have appeared following the loss of the IR in the lineage leading to the last
common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema. Considering that this ancestor occupies a basal position in the tree
describing the relationships among zygnematalean green
algae [21,22], then most, if not all, of the algae belonging
to the Zygnematales are expected to lack an IR in their
chloroplast genome.
As introns appear to be generally stable in land plant cpDNAs [28], the important difference in intron content displayed by Staurastrum and Zygnema cpDNAs is
unexpected. The two zygnematalean cpDNAs share only
five of the 16 intron insertion sites they exhibit in
total.Staurastrum cpDNA lacks seven of the 13 introns that
are present in Zygnema cpDNA, whereas the latter cpDNA
lacks five of the eight introns found in the former genome.
The intron distributions in these cpDNAs are best
explained by assuming that all 16 insertion sites were
populated with introns in the common ancestor of Staurastrum and Zygnema and that subsequently, several

Sequence conservation among streptophyte MatK proteins
Sequence conservation among streptophyte MatK proteins. The MatK sequences of selected green algae and land
plants were aligned with T-COFFEE [40] and arranged into two separate groups. Identical amino acids in all the sequences
examined are displayed on a black background, whereas identical amino acids in all the green algal or land plant sequences are
shown on a dark grey background. In each group, sets of residues sharing eight of the 10 features in the property matrix of
AMAS [41] are shown on a light grey background. The accession numbers for the MatK sequences analyzed are as follows: Zygnema, [GenBank:AY958086]; Staurastrum, [GenBank:AY958085]; Chaetosphaeridium, [GenBank:NC_004115]; Chara connivens,
[GenBank:AY170442]; Nitella opaca, [GenBank:AY170449]; Marchantia, [GenBank:NC_001319]; and Physcomitrella patens [GenBank:NC_005087].

introns were specifically lost in each of the lineages
leading to these green algae. Obviously, we cannot
exclude the possibility that chloroplast introns occupying
common insertion sites were lost independently in the
Staurastrum and Zygnema lineages; thus, the predicted

number of introns in the common ancestor of these algae
may represent a minimal estimate. Given that intron
losses are thought to result from insertions, through
homologous recombination, of intron-less cDNA copies
generated by reverse transcription [31], the frequency of

homologous recombination events or the level of reverse
transcriptase activity might be higher in the chloroplasts
of conjugating green algae than in land plant chloroplasts.
In this respect, it is interesting to note that the Staurastrum
trans-spliced rps12 intron specifies a reverse transcriptase
and is the only known streptophyte chloroplast intron
encoding such an activity.
Our finding that matK is free-standing in Zygnema cpDNA
together with the absence of the trnK(uuu) intron in
which it usually resides strongly suggests that its putative
maturase product is essential for the splicing of group II
introns other than the trnK(uuu) intron. Circumstantial
evidence that MatK functions in splicing of multiple
introns has previously been reported for land plant chloroplasts. The matK gene is located within the group II

intron of trnK(uuu) in all photosynthetic land plants, but
occurs as a free-standing gene in Epifagus cpDNA [29]. In
vivo splicing analyses of the complete set of chloroplast
group II introns in land plant mutants lacking chloroplast
ribosomes disclosed specific splicing defects involving
mainly group IIA introns (in atpF, rpl2, rps12, trnA, trnI,
trnK), thus implying that cpDNA-encoded protein(s) act
as splicing factors [32-35]. It has been proposed that MatK
evolved from a trnK(uuu) intron-specific maturase to a
more versatile maturase that assists the splicing of most or
all group IIA introns of land plants [32-35].

Conclusion
Our structural analyses of the Staurastrum and Zygnema
chloroplast genomes have revealed that many of the features considered earlier as typical of land plant cpDNAs

originated before the emergence of the Coleochaetales
and Zygnematales. While the chloroplast genome appears
to have remained relatively stable in the coleochaetalean
lineage, it has lost the IR and has undergone many
changes in gene order and intron content during the evolution of the Zygnematales.

Methods
DNA isolation and cloning
Chloroplast DNA fractions from Staurastrum punctulatum
de Brébisson (SAG 679-1) and Zygnema circumcarinatum
Czurda (SAG 698-1a) were obtained by isopycnic centrifugation of total cellular DNAs in CsCl-bisbenzimide gradients [36]. A random clone library was prepared from
each algal cpDNA fraction as follows. DNA was sheared
by nebulization and 1,500–2,000-bp fragments were
recovered by electroelution after agarose gel
electrophoresis. These fragments were treated with E. coli
Klenow fragment and T7 DNA polymerase and cloned
into the SmaI site of Bluescript II KS+ or into ligationready pSMART-HCKan (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton). After filter hybridization of the clones with the original DNA used for cloning as a probe, DNA templates
from positive clones were prepared with the QIAprep 96
Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Canada).

Sequence analyses
Nucleotide sequences were determined with the PRISM
BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the PRISM dGTP
BigDye terminator ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems), and the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing
kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Canada) on ABI
model 373 or 377 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems),
using T3 and T7 primers as well as oligonucleotides
complementary to internal regions of the plasmid DNA
inserts. Genomic regions not represented in the clones
analyzed were sequenced from PCR-amplified fragments.
Sequences were assembled using SEQUENCHER 4.1.1
(Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and analyzed
using the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI)
software (version 10.3) package. Protein-coding and
rRNA genes were identified by BLAST searches [37] of the
nonredundant database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and tRNA genes were found
using tRNAscan-SE [38]. Repeated sequence elements
were searched using REPuter [25]. The GRIMM web server
[39] was used to infer the number of gene permutations
by inversions. Genes within copy A of the Chaetosphaeridium and Marchantia IRs were excluded in these gene order
analyses. Pairwise comparisons of genome sequences
were carried out using PipMaker [24].
