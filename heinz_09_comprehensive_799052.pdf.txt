Abstract
Background: Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria comprising some of the most
important bacterial pathogens of animals and humans. Although chlamydial outer membrane
proteins play a key role for attachment to and entry into host cells, only few have been described
so far. We developed a comprehensive, multiphasic in silico approach, including the calculation of
clusters of orthologues, to predict outer membrane proteins using conservative criteria. We tested
this approach using Escherichia coli (positive control) and Bacillus subtilis (negative control), and
applied it to five chlamydial species; Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia (a.k.a.
Chlamydophila) pneumoniae, Chlamydia (a.k.a. Chlamydophila) caviae, and Protochlamydia amoebophila.
Results: In total, 312 chlamydial outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins in 88 orthologous
clusters were identified, including 238 proteins not previously recognized to be located in the outer
membrane. Analysis of their taxonomic distribution revealed an evolutionary conservation among
Chlamydiae, Verrucomicrobia, Lentisphaerae and Planctomycetes as well as lifestyle-dependent
conservation of the chlamydial outer membrane protein composition.
Conclusion: This analysis suggested a correlation between the outer membrane protein
composition and the host range of chlamydiae and revealed a common set of outer membrane
proteins shared by these intracellular bacteria. The collection of predicted chlamydial outer
membrane proteins is available at the online database pCOMP http://www.microbial-ecology.net/
pcomp and might provide future guidance in the quest for anti-chlamydial vaccines.

Background
The phylum Chlamydiae is a unique group of evolutionary
well separated, intracellular bacteria that comprises some
of the most important bacterial pathogens of humans and

animals. Chlamydia trachomatis is the world's leading
cause of preventable blindness [1] and with over 90 million new cases each year the most frequently sexually
transmitted bacterial infection, which can lead to pelvic

inflammatory disease, Fallopian tube obstruction, potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, infertility and
subfertility [2]. Chlamydia (a.k.a. Chlamydophila) pneumoniae is a causative agent of community acquired pneumonia and might be associated with several chronic diseases
such as atherosclerosis [3,4].
All recognized chlamydial pathogens form a small group
of closely related bacteria constituting the family Chlamydiaceae within the phylum Chlamydiae. In addition, seven
new families, the Clavochlamydiaceae, Criblamydiaceae,
Parachlamydiaceae, Piscichlamydiaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, and Waddliaceae were recently
described within this phylum [5], revealing a previously
underestimated diversity of these elusive microorganisms,
which is also represented by their extremely broad host
spectrum. More than 60 host species are known, ranging
from mammals, marsupials, birds, reptiles, amphibians
and fish to insects, crustaceans, molluscs and protozoa
[6]. Moreover, evidence exists that the recognized diversity and host range represent only the tip of the iceberg
and that chlamydiae are ubiquitous [6].
A hallmark of all chlamydiae is their obligate intracellular
lifestyle and a developmental cycle consisting of morphologically and physiologically distinct stages. The chlamydial elementary body (EB) is the infectious form that is
metabolically inert and can persist in the environment.
After infection of a eukaryotic host cell the EB transforms
into a reticulate body (RB), which is metabolically active
and divides by binary fission within a host-derived vacuole termed inclusion [7-9]. Following the replicative
phase RBs differentiate to EBs, that are released into the
environment either by lysis of the host cell or exocytosis
[10] and a new infection cycle begins.
The crucial step of attachment to and entry into the host
cell is mediated by the chlamydial cell envelope, which is
one of the most inimitable features of this unique group
of microbes. The possible lack of peptidoglycan in
chlamydiae is a subject of ongoing discussion [11], but
the difficulties of detecting it clearly support the hypothesis that chlamydiae lack peptidoglycan as main structural
and stabilizing element of the cell envelope, which is
believed to be substituted by the chlamydial outer membrane complex as a structure-giving component. This
assemblage of proteins consists of two cysteine-rich proteins (OmcA and OmcB) and the major outer membrane
protein (MOMP, OmpA [12]). The only other group of
well-described chlamydial outer membrane proteins are
the polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps, [13-15]) a
family of autotransporters. Some Pmps play a role in the
attachment to the host cell [16] and are possibly contributing to tissue specificity of different C. trachomatis disease
groups [17,18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

However, despite the importance of outer membrane proteins in the initial steps of host cell invasion, current
knowledge about the key players in this process is still
scarce. This reflects the general challenges in the analysis
of chlamydiae as there are currently no means to genetically manipulate them and hence to characterize protein
function by classic genetic methods [19]. Additionally,
hardly any studies attempted to obtain a comprehensive
picture of the outer membrane components by a systematic approach [20,21]. Among sequenced Chlamydiaceae
genomes, between 31 (C. trachomatis) and 40 proteins (C.
pneumoniae) are currently annotated as chlamydial outer
membrane proteins with most of them belonging to the
Pmp family or being classified as lipoproteins. This is a
surprisingly low number when compared to other intracellular bacteria with a similar life style and genome size
such as Anaplasma marginale, which has a genome of 1.1
Mb and also replicates in a membrane-enclosed compartment within its host cells. Compared to the Chlamydiaceae
with their 1-1.2 Mb genomes, up to twice as many (62)
outer membrane proteins could be identified in the A.
marginale genome [22]. Furthermore, genomic analysis of
the environmental counterpart of the Chlamydiaceae, the
amoeba symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila (a member
of the Parachlamydiaceae) [23], revealed only homologues
of the cysteine-rich proteins OmcA and OmcB, but no
homologues of other main components of the chlamydial
outer membrane complex (MOMP or Pmps). The apparent absence of these dominant proteins and the unexpectedly low number of other annotated outer membrane
proteins in P. amoebophila further illustrate our general
lack of knowledge about the outer membrane and suggest
that its main components are unique and yet unknown
proteins.
To close this gap of knowledge, we have developed an in
silico approach for the identification of yet unknown
chlamydial outer membrane proteins (Figure 1). An
extensive combination of different prediction programs
and manual curation steps using conservative criteria were
applied to determine a comprehensive and reliable set of
chlamydial outer membrane proteins. This approach was
tested with the well characterized proteomes of Escherichia
coli and Bacillus subtilis and subsequently used to predict
the outer membrane proteins of five chlamydial species,
Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW3/CX, Chlamydia muridarum
Nigg, Chlamydia (a.k.a. Chlamydophila) pneumoniae AR39,
Chlamydia (a.k.a. Chlamydophila) caviae GPIC, and the
amoeba symbiont P. amoebophila UWE25 (Figure 1) [2326]. In addition, the taxonomic distribution of the identified outer membrane proteins was analysed to illuminate
their conservation throughout the chlamydiae and among
representatives of all other bacterial lineages.

Our in silico analysis predicted 312 outer membrane proteins for the five chlamydial species including more than
100 novel outer membrane proteins of the Chlamydiaceae
despite our conservative approach. A database available
online at http://www.microbial-ecology.net/pcomp was
set up and provides access to all predicted outer membrane proteins including details on taxonomic distribution, results of the individual programs used, and links to
experimental evidence for their location if available.
Taken together, we present a comprehensive and curated
set of candidate outer membrane proteins of the Chlamydiae. As outer membrane proteins are preferred targets for
anti-bacterial vaccines, these data can provide guidance
for future development of anti-chlamydial immunization
strategies.

Well-characterized outer membrane proteins are rare in
the scientific literature compared to all other proteins as
they are experimentally elusive due to their physicochemical properties. Furthermore, the in silico identification of
outer membrane proteins is challenging as their main
three-dimensional fold, the beta-barrel, is very difficult to
predict based on the amino acid sequence, if no closely
related protein with known 3D structure is available. All
85 structural entries of a resolved transmembrane betabarrel structure according to the RCSB protein data bank
[27] are from members of the Proteobacteria and consequently, available outer membrane predictors have been
trained mostly on proteobacterial sequences. As chlamydiae are a unique group of microorganisms only distantly
related to the Proteobacteria, chlamydial outer membrane
proteins pose an even greater challenge to prediction programs than proteins from organisms more closely related
to the training set. To account for the difficulties in predicting a reliable set of chlamydial outer membrane proteins, we developed a semi-automatic procedure
comprising 10 different programs using various mathematical approaches and providing overlapping as well as
complementary predictions.
A multiphasic in silico approach to predict outer
membrane proteins
The multiphasic outer membrane protein prediction
approach designed in this study can be subdivided into
three major steps. In the first step, the complete in silico
proteome of the respective organism was screened for general features of proteins translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. In a second, more rigorous step, the list
was curated manually by taking into account the proteins'
annotation, domain, motif and pattern information. The
last step aimed at the identification of integral outer membrane proteins and outer membrane lipoproteins within
this subset based on conserved structural features. Further
details on the design of the prediction approach and the

individual programs and thresholds used are provided in
the Methods section and in Figure 2.
To test sensitivity and specificity of our prediction
approach, we applied it to the in silico proteomes of
Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis
[27,28], being extremely well-studied model organisms
with extensive experimental data concerning protein function and location. Outer membrane protein candidates
were predicted as described above and evaluated by a
comparison with experimental data.
B. subtilis served as negative control for the prediction
approach, since as a Gram-positive microorganism it lacks
an outer membrane, and therefore all predicted outer
membrane proteins can be considered false positives.
From 4,105 proteins encoded in the B. subtilis genome, 31
were predicted as integral outer membrane proteins,
resulting in a false positive rate of 0.73%. Ten of those
proteins are experimentally verified cell wall associated
proteins partly with a high pI (9-10) and a predicted signal peptide, which might explain their misclassification as
integral outer membrane proteins. The remaining proteins are annotated as hypothetical proteins with
unknown location. Prediction of outer membrane lipoproteins was not performed for B. subtilis, as the differentiation of outer membrane from cytoplasmic membrane
lipoproteins is based on only one amino acid [28], which
is only applicable for bacteria with a Gram-negative type
cell wall.
The Gram-negative model organism E. coli served as positive control for our prediction approach, and 98 integral
outer membrane proteins were predicted (see additional
file 1: Supporting Information, Table S1). For the evaluation of these predictions, the E. coli knowledge base EchoLOCATION
[29]
was
used,
which
provides
comprehensive subcellular location analysis supported by
experimental data for all E. coli proteins. For proteins
without evidence for their location in EchoLOCATION a
literature search was performed in order to include also
very recent findings, resulting in a set of 45 experimentally
confirmed integral outer membrane proteins. 42 of those
45 proteins (93%) were recognized by our prediction
approach as outer membrane proteins. Three proteins
(7%) were not identified and therefore represent false
negatives. Only two proteins (4%) were false positives
according to published data. Those two proteins showed
no transmembrane helices, but a signal peptide and were
predicted as beta-barrel proteins. In addition, 100 outer
membrane lipoproteins were predicted, and published
experimental data supports an outer membrane location
of 71 proteins (93% of 76 experimentally verified outer
membrane lipoproteins). According to published data no
false positives and five false negatives (7%) were identi-

fied. The predicted outer membrane proteins of E. coli
identified in this study are listed in Table S1 (see additional file 1: Supporting Information).
The achieved sensitivity (the fraction of correctly recognized outer membrane proteins) and specificity (the fraction of globular cytoplasmic proteins correctly recognized
as non-outer membrane proteins) of the prediction
approach developed in this study is better than the performance of individual beta-barrel prediction programs.
Two of the programs used in this study, PRED-TMBB and
B2TMR-HMM, were previously reported to show a sensitivity of 88% and 84%, and a specificity of 89% and 90%,
respectively, with datasets consisting of well-described
outer membrane or globular cytoplasmic proteins
[30,31]. However, in a comparative analysis of several
beta-barrel predictors, the sensitivity of these two programs was 70% (PRED-TMBB) and 75% (B2TMR-HMM),
respectively, when applied to a smaller dataset containing
only 20 beta barrel proteins known at the structural level
[32]. An improvement of sensitivity to 90% was achieved
by a consensus prediction using the five best performing
programs [32]. The validation of the prediction approach
designed in this study resulted in a sensitivity of 93% (7%
false negatives) and a specificity of 96% (4% false positives) for experimentally verified proteins of E. coli and a
specificity of 99% for B. subtilis. This shows that the multiphasic approach including manual curation steps used
in this study achieves a higher sensitivity and specificity
compared to individual or other consensus prediction
methods.
For a comparison with an experimental data set obtained
by a high-throughput proteomic study, we compared our
analyses with a recent study focussing on the surface proteins of uropathogenic E. coli [33]. This study detected 102
proteins in outer membrane fractions analysed by LC/MSMS. Twenty five of these proteins were designated as outer
membrane proteins, and 36 proteins had an unknown
location according to psort [34], which the authors used
for prediction. All other detected proteins are likely contaminants including many ribosomal proteins, a common contaminant in outer membrane proteomic studies.
A comparison with the highly similar proteins of E. coli
K12 showed that out of the 25 detected proteins designated as outer membrane proteins, 24 were recognized
correctly by our approach as outer membrane proteins
(see additional file 1: Supporting Information, Table S1,
S2, S3). The only protein not recognised as putative outer
membrane protein in our analysis represents a false positive in the proteomic study as it functions in the periplasm
to assist transport by outer membrane proteins [35]. Furthermore, 15 detected proteins categorized as unknown
location were correctly recognized by our approach as
outer membrane proteins. This high degree of overlap

between the experimental data from this study and our
prediction results further illustrates the high selectivity
and sensitivity of our prediction approach.
Prediction of chlamydial outer membrane proteins
Next the developed approach was deployed to predict outer
membrane proteins in five chlamydial proteomes from two
human pathogens (C. trachomatis D/UW3/CX, C. pneumoniae AR39), two animal pathogens (C. muridarum Nigg, C.
caviae GPIC) and an amoeba symbiont (P. amoebophila
UWE25; Figure 1; [23-26]). A detailed presentation of all
predicted proteins is available as Tables S2, S3, and S4 (see
additional file 1: Supporting Information). In total, 33 C.
trachomatis, 34 C. muridarum, 49 C. caviae, 53 C. pneumoniae
and 42 P. amoebophila predicted integral outer membrane
proteins and predicted outer membrane lipoproteins could
be identified (Table 1). A striking finding of this analysis
was that in general more heterogeneous and less welldefined prediction results were obtained for chlamydial
outer membrane proteins when compared to E. coli. For
example, even the well-characterized chlamydial porin
MOMP (a trimeric beta-barrel protein) never reaches prediction results as clear as most E. coli porins (see additional
file 1: Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2). This
might not be surprising if one considers that prediction
algorithms are generally optimized for proteobacterial proteins. Thus the high sensitivity of our prediction approach
achieved for E. coli is certainly not valid for chlamydial proteins. We therefore reasoned that by identifying orthologous groups of proteins (Figure 1), uncertain prediction
results (i.e. proteins classified as cell envelope components) can be resolved by taking into account the predictions of all orthologues, which should further improve the
accuracy of the prediction.
Predicted chlamydial outer membrane proteins belong to
88 orthologous clusters
Clusters of orthologous proteins were constructed for all
chlamydial proteins from bidirectional best FASTA hits

using an empirically determined E-value and overlapping
cut-off values. In total 1,911 clusters were found, from
which 190 contained at least one chlamydial protein predicted either as integral outer membrane protein, as outer
membrane lipoprotein, or as cell envelope component. As
expected, a number of clusters comprised proteins with
different prediction results, confirming our previous
observation that the structure of chlamydial proteins is
difficult to predict and therefore often leads to ambiguous
results in signal peptide, transmembrane helix or general
location prediction. The existence of such orthologous
clusters with inconsistent prediction results further demonstrated the need for manual curation of predicted
chlamydial outer membrane proteins. After detailed analysis of clusters with inconsistent predictions (see Methods
section), the remaining 88 clusters could subsequently be
used to further categorize those chlamydial proteins with
uncertain prediction results. A summary of the predicted
outer membrane clusters and their most important features can be found in Table 2.
For categorization of proteins with uncertain prediction
results, all proteins classified as cell envelope components
but assigned to integral outer membrane clusters were categorized as putative integral outer membrane proteins
(see additional file 1: Supporting Information, Figure S1,
Table S6). In addition, all proteins not recognized as cell
envelope component but found in predicted outer membrane clusters were investigated for possible formation of
beta-barrel (supported by at least two predictors) or betahelix structures. If either of these structures were predicted, these proteins were identified as predicted integral
outer membrane proteins; if only one prediction program
supported a beta-barrel structure, proteins were predicted
as putative integral outer membrane proteins. Similarly,
all proteins with an uncertain location in the cell envelope
in clusters containing predicted outer membrane lipoproteins were reassigned as putative outer membrane lipoproteins. Proteins in predicted outer membrane clusters

that did not match the criteria for reassignment were
labelled "ambiguous predictions" (see additional file 1:
Supporting Information, Table S6). Altogether, the analysis of orthologues protein clusters could be used to reassign 96 proteins (see additional file 1: Supporting
Information, Table S3, Figure S1).
After these analyses, 55 predicted integral outer membrane proteins or outer membrane lipoproteins of C. trachomatis, 59 of C. muridarum, 66 of C. caviae, 70 of C.
pneumoniae and 62 of P. amoebophila could be identified.
Our approach was thus able to predict up to 77% more
outer membrane proteins than currently recognized
(Table 1, Table S3 in additional file 1: Supporting Information). Taking into account that due to the lack of a
close relative with a sequenced genome for P. amoebophila
58 species-specific proteins of uncertain location in the
cell envelope were not associated to a cluster and therefore
could not be considered in the reassignment step (see
additional file 1: Supporting Information, Table S4), the
new numbers correspond well with the number of outer
membrane proteins expected for the respective genome
sizes when compared to other organisms with a similar
lifestyle [22].
pCOMP - a comprehensive database for predicted
chlamydial outer membrane proteins
In order to provide a convenient and straightforward
interface to the prediction and cluster analysis performed
in this study, we have set up the online database pCOMP
(predicted Chlamydial Outer Membrane Proteins). The
pCOMP database, accessible at http://www.microbialecology.net/pcomp provides an overview of all 88 predicted outer membrane protein clusters and the associated proteins from all bacteria included in this study. A
unique pCOMP cluster number was assigned to each cluster, which is in the following used as reference. Detailed
information on the various prediction results from all
applied programs for proteins of the five investigated
chlamydial species including their final location prediction is provided. In addition, information about experimentally confirmed chlamydial outer membrane
proteins, including links to abstracts at PubMed [36], is
available, and protein sequences can be directly accessed
at GenBank [36] and UniProt [37]. Several options to
search pPCOMP are available, including a free text search
applicable for all current protein identifiers, organism and
strain names as well as the possibility to BLAST a sequence
of interest against all proteins in the database.
Predicted outer membrane proteins with experimental
evidence
Several (n = 26) of the predicted outer membrane protein
clusters include proteins whose subcellular location has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

already been demonstrated experimentally. Selected
examples are discussed below.
The first chlamydial proteins described as outer membrane proteins were the members of the chlamydial outer
membrane complex (COMC), all of which were predicted
as outer membrane proteins in our analysis; the major
outer membrane protein OmpA (MOMP) as well as the
two cysteine rich proteins OmcA and OmcB (pCOMP
clusters 044, 064, and 068). The location of OmpA in the
outer membrane and its function as a porin has been
shown in numerous publications (see e.g. [38-41]). This is
also true for OmcA, which was demonstrated to be located
in the outer membrane [42,43] and was furthermore characterised as lipoprotein [44]. Our failure to recognize it as
a predicted lipoprotein is due to the settings chosen for
LipoP, which resulted in only the best prediction result to
be displayed. In OmcA, there is a signal for an SPI site
which overrules the SPII site, and the SPII site is therefore
not displayed as a result. However, when choosing the
output format to display all results, the SPII site is also recognized, but at a lower value than the SPI site. OmcB was
sometimes described as a periplasmic protein due to its
lack of recognition by TID labelling and the recovery in
the soluble protein fraction (and not the membrane fraction), and it was not recognized on the surface of EBs by
specific antibodies in several studies [43,45-47]. However,
later studies clearly showed its surface exposure and
heparin-binding activity. In addition, incubation with
purified OmcB blocked host cell infection. OmcB is therefore now considered an important surface-exposed
adhesin crucial for host cell infection [48-50].
The largest group of chlamydial outer membrane proteins
are the polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps), which
have been identified as autotransporters (pCOMP clusters
005, 007, 017, 025, 032, 035, 037, 042, 045, 046, 052,
056, 076, 086, 088). Autotransporters are proteins which
possess a transmembrane domain spanning the outer
membrane and mediating its own transport as well as a
domain exposed to the extracellular environment, often
functioning as adhesins or virulence factors [51]. Chlamydiaceae Pmp proteins are the only described autotransporters outside the Proteobacteria and are considered
essential for host cell interaction. At first only few Pmp
proteins could be detected by TID labelling or immunofluorescence of formalin fixed EBs in the chlamydial
outer membrane, but the authors of these studies stated
that this is likely due to insufficient amounts of proteins
to be detected or failure of surface epitope recognition by
the antibodies in the respective essay [52,53]. However,
the outer membrane location and the function of several
Pmps, most dominantly PmpD (Pmp21), has been
reported in several studies [54-59], and in a recent study,
the expression and surface exposure of all Pmp proteins

Page 10 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:634

from C. trachomatis has been demonstrated [60]. As further support for their importance in the chlamydial outer
membrane, several studies showed disease-correlated
serum reactions for Pmp proteins [58,61,62], and there
are indications for tissue tropism-related differences in the
Pmp proteins based on sequence clustering analyses
[17,18].
Additional predicted outer membrane proteins, which are
in agreement with experimental evidence, include SctC, a
component of the type three secretion apparatus [63], the
protein CTL0626 [64] and OmpH [65], as well as PorB,
which functions as a porin in the chlamydial outer membrane [66], and the '76 kDa protein' CP0017
[67](pCOMP clusters 020, 030, 051, 061, 075). The Mip
protein (pCOMP cluster 019) was originally reported not
to be surface exposed [68,69], whereas one study
describes it as secreted into the inclusion membrane [70].
It was however also shown to be immunogenic [71,72],
and surface exposure was shown by biotinylation of EBs
as well as surface immunoprecipitation in a study that
suggests the most likely location of Mip to be dual, in the
inner as well as the outer membrane [73], which would
also explain the contradicting reports in the literature.
Few proteins (n = 4) predicted by our approach are not in
agreement with available experimental data. The location
of the type three secretion protein SctJ (pCOMP 028) has,
to our knowledge, not been demonstrated for Chlamydiae;
it is however reported to function as a bridge between the
inner and outer membrane and thus highly unlikely to be
located on the surface of chlamydiae [63]. The same can
be concluded for YtgA (pCOMP 010), which has been
reported to be associated with an ABC transporter, but is
likely to function mostly in the periplasm [74]. The protein Srp (pCOMP 079) was originally reported to be
located in the outer membrane and function together
with OmcA and OmcB as a third cysteine-rich protein [7577], but was also shown to be translocated to the inclusion membrane by immunofluorescence [78]. The protein TARP (pCOMP 027) has been shown to be located at
the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane[79], it is
transported through the cell envelope only in the process
of being injected into the host cell where it performs actin
recruitment to facilitate chlamydial entry (e.g. [80-82]).
New putative chlamydial outer membrane proteins
Forty two of the 88 obtained orthologous clusters of predicted chlamydial outer membrane proteins (Table 2)
contained proteins already described as such or likely to
function as such based on their homology to other outer
membrane proteins, whereas 46 clusters contained at least
one chlamydial protein not yet described as outer membrane protein (annotated as hypothetical protein, and no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

reports available demonstrating its location). Altogether,
143 new Chlamydiaceae and 94 new P. amoebophila outer
membrane candidates were thus identified in this study
(Table 2; additional file 1: Supporting Information, Table
S3, S4). In previous studies, 112 of those were shown to
be transcribed [83-85] and 58 were confirmed as
expressed proteins [48,86-91]. This extended set of putative chlamydial outer membrane proteins should represent important targets for further experimental
characterization. As an example, eight orthologous clusters containing hypothetical proteins are shared by both
Chlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae (see pCOMP clusters 048-050, 058-060, 062, 067), and four of these clusters include proteins from all chlamydial organisms
(pCOMP 049, 058-060). Those proteins could represent
cell envelope features which remained hidden so far but
are shared by all chlamydiae.
Twenty three orthologous clusters contain proteins from
the Parachlamydiaceae and/or the Chlamydiaceae but no
orthologues from other bacteria and thus represent
chlamydia-specific outer membrane proteins (Figure 3,
Table 2). It is remarkable though, that only four of these
clusters comprised proteins from both chlamydial families and that not a single cluster included proteins from all
chlamydial species. This demonstrates that the outer
membrane of the Chlamydiae has undergone drastic
changes during evolution after the emergence of extant
Parachlamydiaceae and Chlamydiaceae. The observed
expansion of outer membrane proteins in the Chlamydiaceae (15 clusters) compared to the Parachlamydiaceae (4
clusters) might reflect the highly adapted lifestyle of the
Chlamydiaceae as parasites of vertebrates.
A putative autotransporter in P. amoebophila
Interestingly, no evidence for Pmps was found previously
in the genome of the amoeba symbiont P. amoebophila
[23]. In our analysis, indeed all except one Pmp cluster
contain Chlamydiaceae but no Parachlamydiaceae proteins
(Table 2). The only exception is a cluster (pCOMP cluster
017) which comprises putative autotransporter and cell
surface proteins from C. pneumoniae and other bacteria, as
well as one hypothetical protein from P. amoebophila. It
will be interesting to decipher the role of this P. amoebophila protein, which might function as an adhesin to
attach to amoeba cell membranes. However, the apparent
overrepresentation of autotransporters in the Chlamydiaceae compared to P. amoebophila might indicate a
strong effect of life style and ecological niche on the composition of the outer membrane proteins. In fact, Pmps
constitute the most diverse family of outer membrane
proteins in the Chlamydiaceae, suggesting an essential role
of these proteins as virulence factors for the infection of
vertebrate (as opposed to protozoan) host cells.

membrane clusters. The Venn diagram shows the numbers of clusters that contain at least one protein from the
Chlamydiaceae, the Parachlamydiaceae or other bacteria, and
the respective intersections.
A set of enigmatic outer membrane lipoproteins specific
for chlamydiae
Thirty one predicted outer membrane protein clusters
obtained in our analysis contain only lipoproteins (Table
2). Lipoproteins are a molecular consortium of protein
and lipid, which anchors them in the bacterial cytoplasmic or outer membrane. Most characterized bacterial lipoproteins assist periplasmic transport of components
imported by ABC transporters. However, some outer
membrane lipoproteins are also known to be exposed to
the outside of bacterial cells (e.g. [92]). The predicted
lipoprotein clusters of chlamydiae can be divided into two
groups; on the one hand they contain well-described proteins, mostly components of ABC transport systems,
which are likely anchored in the outer membrane and
exposed to the periplasm and perform a general function
conserved throughout a great diversity of bacteria. On the
other hand, about half of the lipoprotein clusters contain
exclusively chlamydial proteins all of which are annotated
as hypothetical proteins. Therefore, lipoproteins seem to
be a class of proteins in which the chlamydial diversification from all other bacteria is particularly pronounced.
Due to the absence of experimental data for most of the
chlamydial lipoproteins, their function remains enigmatic.
Species-specific outer membrane proteins might reflect
the host spectrum
One protein from C. trachomatis, four proteins from C.
muridarum, 10 proteins from C. caviae, 17 proteins from
C. pneumoniae, and 72 proteins from P. amoebophila were
predicted as outer membrane proteins but not assigned to
a cluster within the threshold applied in this study (additional file 1: Supporting Information, Table S4). These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

proteins are therefore considered species-specific proteins
(pCOMP group 089). Independent of their origin, these
proteins must have undergone rapid evolution obscuring
a detectable sequence homology. For most of them no
unambiguous prediction was inferred and they were thus
classified as predicted cell envelope components. However, for C. pneumoniae, five predicted integral outer membrane proteins could be identified (CP1072, CP1074,
CP1075, CP1076, and CP1077). Their arrangement in the
same region of the genome might indicate that they originated from multiple gene duplication events, and it is
tempting to speculate that these C. pneumoniae specific
outer membrane proteins contribute to tissue and host
specificity of these microorganisms. C. pneumoniae has
been shown to thrive in a wide variety of hosts (14 species;
[6]) and encodes a significantly wider spectrum of outer
membrane proteins than the two species C. trachomatis
and C. muridarum, which show the smallest and therefore
most specified pool of predicted outer membrane proteins, and which are found in only one or two host species
(humans; mouse and hamster, respectively; [2,93,94]).
The greatest number of species-specific proteins was
found for P. amoebophila (additional file 1: Supporting
Information, Table S4). Within these 72 proteins, there
are 11 predicted integral outer membrane proteins
(pc0036, pc0074, pc0790, pc1030, pc1071, pc1295,
pc1304, pc1463, pc1862, pc1863 and pc1864) and three
predicted outer membrane lipoproteins (pc0291, pc0498,
and pc0606) without any detectable orthologues. The
high number of apparent species-specific proteins in P.
amoebophila shows that these chlamydial symbionts are
remarkably different from the Chlamydiaceae with respect
to their repertoire of predicted outer membrane proteins,
which most likely represents an adaptation to the environmental life style and a variety of amoeba and possibly
also other protozoan hosts.
Outer membrane proteins show a rapid evolutionary rate
Using cluster analysis, taxonomic profiles of predicted
outer membrane proteins of Chlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae clustered together but showed a lower similarity (91%) than those of proteins not predicted to be
located in the outer membrane (97%; additional file 1:
Supporting Information, Table S7, S8, Figure S2). This
suggests that outer membrane proteins are among the
fastest evolving groups of chlamydial proteins and thus
contributed most to differentiation of life style and host
spectrum of chlamydiae. A similar role is in fact discussed
for members of the Pmp family, the largest family of
Chlamydiaceae outer membrane proteins, which are implicated in tissue specificity of C. trachomatis disease groups
[17,18,95]. These adaptations might be similar to the Sca
proteins of Rickettsia species [96] or the mosaic genes of
Anaplasma species [97], two other bacterial groups con-

taining important obligate intracellular human pathogens.
Chlamydiae share predicted outer membrane proteins
with other intracellular pathogens
A comparison of the taxonomic profiles of chlamydial
proteins with respect to the categories free-living, facultative or obligate intracellular (additional file 1: Supporting
Information, Table S7) with those of the free-living model
organism E. coli showed no obvious differences between
E. coli, the Chlamydiaceae and the Parachlamydiaceae,
respectively (additional file 1: Supporting Information,
Figure S3, Table S9). When only the presence or absence
of orthologues from obligate intracellular human pathogens was analysed, again, no differences between the two
chlamydial families were seen, demonstrating that the resolution of this approach with respect to host adaptation is
limited (additional file 1: Supporting Information, Figure
S4, Table S10). However, both Chlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae showed marked differences compared to the
free-living model organism E. coli. The higher number of
clusters with orthologues from obligate intracellular
human pathogens in the Chlamydiae suggests that indeed
the lifestyle of an organism has a profound effect on its
outer membrane proteins and that - in addition to host
and tissue specific adaptations - general features are
shared between phylogenetically largely unrelated groups
of bacteria with the same life style.
Signatures of the chlamydial evolutionary history
Interestingly, the vast majority of outer membrane proteins of both Chlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae have
orthologues in at least one of the three phyla Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, or Lentisphaerae (additional file 1:
Supporting Information, Figure S5, Table S11). The overrepresentation of orthologues with these phyla, compared
to E. coli, supports an ancient relationship of Chlamydiae
with Verrucomicrobia, Lentisphaerae and Planctomycetes,
which were recently proposed to constitute the so-called
PVC superphylum [98,99], and suggests that a number of
outer membrane proteins were retained from their last
common ancestor.

Conclusions
In silico prediction of chlamydial outer membrane proteins and subsequent analysis of orthologous clusters
resulted in a comprehensive collection of chlamydial
outer membrane proteins, revealing major differences
among chlamydial organisms with respect to their cell
envelope. In addition, phylogenetic profiling of predicted
chlamydial outer membrane proteins uncovered similarities of the chlamydial outer membrane to those of other
human pathogens and allowed insights into ancient evolutionary relationships of the Chlamydiae. As our prediction approach included several manual curating steps and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

followed a highly conservative policy minimizing false
positives, this collection represents a reliable resource of
predicted chlamydial outer membrane proteins.
Chlamydiae cause some of the most widespread diseases
of humans worldwide [1-3], and the need for an antichlamydial vaccine was thus already recognized decades
ago [100]. Interestingly, recently identified putative
chlamydial B and T cell antigens [101,102] matched proteins from five pCOMP clusters, one of them not recognized previously as outer membrane protein. The first
extensive overview of chlamydial outer membrane proteins provided in this study might thus also provide a
solid basis for and help in the quest for an anti-chlamydial
vaccine.

Methods
Software used for prediction of protein structure and
location
Signal peptide predictions were performed at the the SignalP 3.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/
using the model for Gram-negative bacteria and the combination of Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models
[103] and the TargetP 1.1 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/TargetP/ using the settings for Non-plant organisms and the 'no cutoffs, winner-takes-all' setting without
cleavage site prediction [60]. Alpha-helical transmembrane regions were investigated using the TMHMM 2.0
server
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/[104].
Further information about putative protein location was
obtained from the cPsortdb database http://
db.psort.org[34]. Four different servers were used for the
identification of putative beta-barrel structures; the Betabarrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP) http://
www.bioinfo.no/tools/bomp[105], the Prediction of
TransMembrane Beta-Barrel Proteins server (PREDTMBB) http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/
[30], the Markov Chain Model for Beta Barrels prediction
program (MCMBB) http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/bioinfor
matics/mcmbb/[106] and the B2TMR-HMM predictor
http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/predictors/[31]. For PREDTMBB, the predictions were performed using the Viterbi
and Posterior Decoding algorithms. The probability of the
proteins to form a beta-helix was investigated with
BetaWrap http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/betawrap/[65].
Lipoproteins were predicted using the LipoP 1.0 server
with the 'short' output format selected http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/[107]. Additional information about individual proteins was obtained from the
PEDANT database http://pedant.gsf.de[108].
In silico approach for prediction of outer membrane
proteins
Starting with the in silico proteome of an organism, the
first step was to select proteins according to general char-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:634

acteristics of outer membrane proteins also shared with
periplasmic proteins (Figure 2). This should mainly
exclude cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic membrane proteins.
In detail, to exclude cytoplasmic membrane proteins, all
proteins with more than one transmembrane helix predicted by TMHMM [104] were considered cytoplasmic
membrane proteins and thus removed. Proteins with only
one predicted transmembrane helix were not removed in
this step as signal peptides are sometimes falsely recognized as transmembrane helix. From the remaining proteins, those labelled to be located in the cytoplasm, the
cytoplasmic membrane, or the periplasm in cPsortdb
[34], a database providing access to location predictions
obtained by a variety of methods, were removed leaving
only proteins with "unknown" or "outer membrane"
location. All proteins designated "outer membrane" were
automatically chosen for the first set of outer membrane
protein candidates. All proteins with "unknown" location
in cPsortdb were subsequently analyzed for the presence
of a signal peptide using SignalP [103] and TargetP [109].
If both or only one of the two servers predicted the protein
to be secreted, it was classified as containing a signal peptide. The presence of a signal peptide indicates that a protein is secreted (in a sec-dependent manner) and therefore
potentially located in the cell envelope. Proteins without
a predicted signal peptide were thus removed, resulting in
the first set of outer membrane protein candidates, which
should still include false positive proteins from the cell
envelope, e.g. periplasmic proteins not recognized as such
by the conservative approach of cPsortdb (Figure 2).
In the second step, the obtained initial set of putative
outer membrane proteins was curated manually by taking
into account the annotation of each protein as well as
additional information provided by the PEDANT database [110], including hits to conserved protein domains
and patterns derived from Interpro [111], PIR [112],
SCOP [113], and hits to COG [114]. To remove false positives, proteins annotated as or showing evidence for cytoplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane or periplasmic proteins
were omitted from the list of outer membrane protein
candidates (Figure 2). This rather conservative approach
could lead to generating false negatives due to an incorrect
annotation. However, we regarded the sequence homology based annotation of proteins as strong evidence for
functional conservation. In particular for the evolutionary
well separated chlamydiae, it seems highly likely that a
chlamydial protein still showing sequence similarity to a
protein from other bacteria is functionally conserved and
thus located in the same cellular compartment (with the
exception of fusion proteins). In addition, in order to not
miss any potential outer membrane proteins among those
without any indication for their location, i.e. proteins
labelled by cPsortdb as "unknown" and lacking a recognized signal peptide, their annotation was considered.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

Proteins annotated to function in the outer membrane
were added to the list of outer membrane proteins, resulting in the second set of outer membrane candidates (Figure 2).
The third and final step aimed at the prediction of integral
outer membrane proteins and outer membrane lipoproteins within the reduced set of outer membrane candidates. Integral outer membrane proteins generally form so
called beta-barrels consisting of anti-parallel beta-sheets
within the lipid bilayer [115]. Since recognizing this structure is still a challenge for prediction algorithms, four different beta-barrel predictors were used (BOMP, [105];
PRED-TMBB, [30]; MCMBB, [106]; and B2TMR-HMM,
[31]), and already two out of four predictors identifying
the proteins as beta-barrels were counted as positive. An
additional structure often found in adhesins and toxins is
the beta-helix. All outer membrane protein candidates
were therefore subjected to the program BetaWrap [116]
and results obtaining a p-value < 0.01 were counted as
positive. A predicted beta-helix marked the protein as
likely functioning as an adhesin located in the outer membrane. The final set of predicted integral outer membrane
proteins thus contained proteins identified either as betabarrel or beta-helix proteins. Furthermore, the program
LipoP [107] was used to identify potential outer membrane lipoproteins as described by Seydel and coworkers
[28]. A positive result from LipoP overruled any eventual
beta-barrel predictions, because LipoP predictions were
previously shown to be highly specific [107,117]. Proteins
labelled by cPsortdb as "unknown", lacking a signal peptide and a conclusive annotation were also analyzed with
LipoP and, if recognized, were included in the final set of
predicted outer membrane lipoproteins. All proteins not
predicted as beta-barrel, beta-helix or as outer membrane
lipoproteins were assigned to a group designated cell
envelope components, which are considered to be likely
associated with the cell envelope, but for which no unambiguous prediction was obtained (Figure 2).
Identification of clusters of orthologous outer membrane
proteins
The Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) database [118]
provides a precalculated sequence similarity matrix for all
proteins deposited at major public sequence databases.
For the formation of orthologous clusters, bidirectional
best hits (BBHs) with an E-value cut-off of 1-08 and a
length ratio cut-off of 0.5 were grouped. All chlamydiae
(including the yet unfinished genomes of Parachlamydia
acanthamoebae UV7, Simkania negevensis Z, and Waddlia
chondrophila 2032/99; ingroup 1) or a selection of Proteobacteria including E. coli K12 (ingroup 2) were considered
as "ingroup" organisms in our analysis, respectively,
whereas 438 and 427 representatives of other bacterial
lineages were considered "outgroup" organisms, respec-

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:634

tively; for a detailed list of ingroup and outgroup organisms see additional file 1: Supporting Information, Table
S7. First, BBHs between proteins from ingroup organisms
were merged to form one cluster if they shared at least one
protein. Subsequently, outgroup proteins with BBHs to
ingroup proteins were added to the clusters. As a last step,
in-paralogues (i.e. paralogues that arose after diversification; [119] were added if they showed a higher similarity
to a protein from the same organism than to proteins
from other ingroup organisms.
When clustering was applied using the Chlamydiae as
ingroup, 1,911 clusters were obtained in total, from which
190 contained at least one protein predicted as outer
membrane protein. 81 of these clusters included two or
more proteins from the five analysed chlamydiae, but not
all of these proteins were predicted to be located in the
outer membrane. These clusters were termed inconsistent
clusters and analysed in more detail. 50 out of the 81
inconsistent clusters were not consistent with respect to
results of signal peptide prediction, annotation, or both.
Inconsistent clusters could either result from the failure of
signal peptide prediction methods to reliably recognize
secreted proteins of chlamydiae, or from loosely assembled clusters comprising non-orthologous proteins with
different function and location.
To check whether the inconsistent clusters resulted from a
low cut-off value used for cluster formation, the proteins
from each of the inconsistent clusters were aligned by
ClustalW and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. For this,
a ClustalW alignment was generated with the program
MEGA 4.0 using the default settings [120,121] and neighbour-joining and parsimony trees were calculated using
default options. For neighbour-joining, either the Poisson
or the p-distance correction was used. 1,000 bootstrap
replicates were calculated for both treeing methods. In 64
out of the 81 inconsistent clusters all chlamydial proteins
grouped together. We therefore assumed that in these
clusters, function and location of these proteins are conserved and they were hence used for further analyses (Figure 1). In contrast, a non-monophyletic grouping could
be caused either by proteins of different function/location
or could be a consequence of lateral gene transfer. As this
is difficult to resolve, we omitted the 17 clusters in which
the chlamydial proteins did not cluster together from further analysis. From the resulting 173 clusters, those containing exclusively chlamydial proteins with uncertain
predictions (i.e. classified as cell envelope components)
were not further considered if no orthologues from other
bacteria were clearly annotated as outer membrane proteins, as these most likely represent proteins from the periplasm or peptidoglycan-binding proteins. In addition,
clusters containing chlamydial proteins predicted as outer
membrane protein but also bacterial orthologues experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/634

mentally verified as cytoplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane
or periplasmic proteins were omitted.
Taxonomic profiles
Taxonomic profiles of chlamydial proteins based on the
obtained clusters were analysed using a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix [122] and subsequent cluster analysis with
complete linkage using the program PRIMER 5.0. The
phylum Proteobacteria is by far the largest and most diverse
phylum and was therefore treated separately as Alpha-,
Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon- and unclassified Proteobacteria, respectively, for this analysis.
