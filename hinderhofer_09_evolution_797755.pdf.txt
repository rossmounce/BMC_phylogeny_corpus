Abstract
Background: The SPFH protein superfamily is a diverse family of proteins whose eukaryotic
members are involved in the scaffolding of detergent-resistant microdomains. Recently the origin
of the SPFH proteins has been questioned. Instead, convergent evolution has been proposed.
However, an independent, convergent evolution of three large prokaryotic and three eukaryotic
families is highly unlikely, especially when other mechanisms such as lateral gene transfer which
could also explain their distribution pattern have not yet been considered.
To gain better insight into this very diverse protein family, we have analyzed the genomes of 497
microorganisms and investigated the pattern of occurrence as well as the genomic vicinity of the
prokaryotic SPFH members.
Results: According to sequence and operon structure, a clear division into 12 subfamilies was
evident. Three subfamilies (SPFH1, SPFH2 and SPFH5) show a conserved operon structure and two
additional subfamilies are linked to those three through functional aspects (SPFH1, SPFH3, SPFH4:
interaction with FtsH protease). Therefore these subgroups most likely share common ancestry.
The complex pattern of occurrence among the different phyla is indicative of lateral gene transfer.
Organisms that do not possess a single SPFH protein are almost exclusively endosymbionts or
endoparasites.
Conclusion: The conserved operon structure and functional similarities suggest that at least 5
subfamilies that encompass almost 75% of all prokaryotic SPFH members share a common origin.
Their similarity to the different eukaryotic SPFH families, as well as functional similarities, suggests
that the eukaryotic SPFH families originated from different prokaryotic SPFH families rather than
one. This explains the difficulties in obtaining a consistent phylogenetic tree of the eukaryotic SPFH
members. Phylogenetic evidence points towards lateral gene transfer as one source of the very
diverse patterns of occurrence in bacterial species.

Background
The SPFH superfamily of proteins is a very diverse family
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins that

carry an evolutionarily conserved domain called the SPFH
domain (named after the proteins Stomatin, Prohibitin,
Flotillin and HflK/C) [1,2].

Members of this superfamily can be found in all domains
including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Although the
conservation of the SPFH motif throughout all domains
suggests that this motif is a primordial one with an important function [1,3], phylogenetic analysis has failed to
provide additional support for the common ancestry of
the SPFH superfamily [4], however this possibility is not
ruled out. In addition, it has been suggested that the
incongruency between species and protein trees of the
SPFH2 members point towards sequence convergence [4].
There are however many reasons why trees produced from
different family members can be inconsistent including
base composition bias, mixture of orthologs and paralogs,
the long-branch attraction artefact or lateral gene transfer
[5-8].
Indeed, most known eukaryotic SPFH family members
that have been investigated in-depth are involved in the
scaffolding of specific detergent-resistant microdomains
[2,9], suggesting that the SPFH domain may constitute a
lipid recognition motif [3] regardless of whether or not all
or every family member shares a common ancestor. However, the emphasis in those earlier studies was clearly put
on eukaryotic SPFH proteins and only a limited number
of prokaryotic SPFH family members were considered.
Only a few bacterial SPFH family members have been analyzed so far. The first was PH1510 in the Archaeum Pyrococcus horikoshii which has been shown to interact with the
NfeD protein homolog PH1511, a serine protease [10].
The second was the Ybbk protein (Qmca) from E. coli
[11]. Interestingly, a multicopy-Ybbk mutant conferred
viability to the otherwise lethal deletion of ftsH protease
and htpX protease, suggesting that YbbK might replace the
function of those proteases by complementing their chaperone function. In addition, an interaction of YbbK with
the FtsH protease has been shown [11].
The third, YuaG protein from B. subtilis, has been analyzed
to some extent. The yuaFGI operon is dependent on the
sigmaW factor which can be induced by different kinds of
cellular stress, such as osmotic or alkaline shock or presence of toxic peptides [11]. Various sigmaW-controlled
genes exist which provide their hosts with advantages in a
competitive soil environment, e.g. by rendering them
resistant to membrane-compromising antibiotics of other
bacteria [12,13]. However, YuaG deletion mutants
showed no growth defects under high salt or alkaline conditions [M. Hinderhofer, unpublished data] suggesting
that YuaG is a factor for a specific but unknown stress
resistance or that this resistance mechanism is of significance in a competitive environment only.
Studies using fluorescently-(GFP)-labeled YuaG, which
localizes as a discrete and highly mobile foci within the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

plasma membrane, suggest that it might represent membrane microdomains in analogy to the situation in vertebrates [Peter Graumann and Felix Dempwolff, University
of Freiburg; personal communication].
The fourth studied SPFH member SO1377 from S. oneidensis shows a pleiotropic phenotype with growth defects
[14]. This deletion also has a strong effect on the iron
metabolism in S. oneidensis.
Our own studies have shown that the SPFH member YqiK
from E. coli is not induced by general cellular stress (e.g.
osmotic or alkaline shock) and deletion mutants do not
show growth defects in neither the standard or stress conditions mentioned above [M. Hinderhofer, unpublished
data], suggesting again that YqiK might function under
very specific yet unknown stress conditions. Overexpression of YqiK shows a marked effect on cell morphology.
Bacteria that overexpress YqiK are larger than wild-type
cells and contain opaque cellular inclusions suggesting
that they might contain overproduced lipids [Helmut
Plattner, University of Konstanz, unpublished data].
Despite the relative conservation of SPFH family member
sequences and occurrence in higher eukaryotes, this consistency does not prevail in prokaryotes: while species
with several SPFH family members exist, close relatives
without family members exist as well. We performed a
detailed search for SPFH family members in databases
accessible to the public of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes to address 3 issues: (1) what is the incidence
and pattern of SPFH family members in prokaryotes; (2)
is there an explanation of the very diverse occurrence of
SPFH members, and (3) is there support for a common
origin of SPFH proteins in bacteria and eukaryotes?
Our analysis confirmed that most, if not all, bacterial
SPFH family members do indeed share a common ancestor, which is concluded from the strikingly conserved
operon structures. The suggestion that the eukaryotic
SPFH family members evolved from multiple – instead of
one-bacterial SPFH family members would also account
for the large sequence differences observed between the
different eukaryotic SPFH families and the lack of a consistent phylogenetic tree for them.
The diverse pattern of occurrence together with conserved
insertions in rather unrelated species strongly suggests lateral gene transfer.

Methods
Identification of SPFH proteins
To identify possible SPFH proteins, hypothetical
sequences
were
scanned
using
CDART
http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexing

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:10

ton.cgi?cmd=rps, smart http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/
or Pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/. Following this initial
scan, homologs of the identified proteins were searched
for by multiple blast searches [15-17]. To ensure homologies, the cut-off value of 1E-25 was used for initial blast
searches.
Phylogenetic analysis
For the generation of phylogenetic trees, the most diverse
sequences of each subgroup were aligned with ClustalW
[18]. As some of the sequences showed a high sequence
similarity, a criterion of at least 15% sequence divergence,
as well as the origin from different genera was used for
inclusion of sequences in this analysis. The complete list
of all sequences included in the tree can be found in Additional file 1.

The alignment was used as input for the generation of
phylogenetic trees with MEGA4 [19] (BLOSUM matrix
and Neighbour-Joining algorithm). The statistical
strength was assessed using bootstrap resampling.
Obtained trees were validated by repeating the analysis
with other sequences of the subgroups. For the final
grouping of all SPFH proteins into 12 subfamilies additional criteria like operon structures or domain architecture were also taken into account. In detail, SPFH1a and b
were grouped together because they exhibit exactly the
same domain structure, have a close similarity to the
eukaryotic Stomatins and show the same operon structure. SPFH2a, b and c were grouped together because of
the same reasons and their similarity to eukaryotic Reggies/Flotillins. SPFH3a and b were grouped together
because they also share the same domain structure and
because they are placed together in one operon. Finally,
although SPFH11b lacks the predicted coiled-coil domain
when compared to SPFH11a and both groups are separated in most trees they were grouped together because
they are located in the same operon and both subgroups
show a high similarity to the obtained consensus.
To obtain consensus sequences of each subgroup, all subgroup members were aligned using ClustalW 1.83 [18]
and consensi were obtained with ESPript 2.2 [20].
In detail, for the generation of the consensus sequence of
SPFH1 404 sequences were used, for SPFH2 127, for
SPFH3a 247, for SPFH3b 248, for SPFH4 116, for SPFH5
36, for SPFH6 55, for SPFH7 26, for SPFH8 75, for SPFH8
32, for SPFH10 13, for SPFH11 14 and for SPFH12 11.
The similarities to the obtained consensi were 43–80% for
the SPFH1 family, 40–57% for the SPFH2 family, 59–
82% for the SPFH3 family, 37–65% for the SPFH4 family,
79–95% for the SPFH5 family, 68–90% for the SPFH6
family, 79–81% for the SPFH7 family, 39–78% for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

SPFH8 family, 53–76% for the SPFH9 family, 47–77% for
SPFH10, 78–90% for SPFH11 and 55–74% for SPFH12.
To additionally verify that the separation of the subfamilies was correct, we used the HMMer program version
2.3.2 http://hmmer.janelia.org to create subgroup-specific
HMMs and tested each of them against members of the
other subgroups (see Additional file 1 and Additional file
2b). In detail, for the creation of the SPFH1a HMM, 257
sequences were use, for the SPFH1b HMM 95 sequences,
for SPFH2a 63, for SPFH2b 36, for SPFH2c 18, for SPFH3a
247, for SPFH3b 248, for SPFH4 124, for SPFH5 36, for
SPFH6 55, for SPFH7 24, for SPFH8 25, for SPFH9 30, for
SPFH10 11, for SPFH11a 7, for SPFH11b 7 and for
SPFH12 11.
The largest and most widespread group, the p-Stomatins,
were denominated by SPFH1, followed by the p-Flotillins
(SPFH2), which also showed a wide distribution among
most prokaryotic families. The HflC/K proteins were
denominated SPFH3 and the p-Prohibitins SPFH4. Additionally, the other small groups were numbered consecutively.
The highest and lowest E values of each subfamily were
summarized in Additional file 2a.
Primary sequence analysis
Hydropathy plots were created with WinPep 3.01 [21]
and coiled-coil structures were predicted with algorithm
described by Lupas et al. [22].

Analysis of GC and GC3 content as well as codon usage
was performed using the DAMBE (Data Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution) program [23]. Codon usage
of the respective organisms was retrieved from CMR
(Comprehensive Microbial Resource, http://cmr.tigr.org/
cgi-bin/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi).
For the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients,
sequences were aligned and distance matrices were created with MEGA4 [19]. The distance matrices were then
transformed into a vector and the Pearson's correlation
coefficient was calculated with Excel.

Results
Most bacterial genomes contain at least one SPFH family
member
Using known SPFH sequences as templates, we searched
public databases for novel homologs. After scanning 980
bacterial genomes and filtering out redundancies (e.g.
genomes from different strains of the same bacterial species), we constrained our analysis to the fully sequenced
genomes of 497 species encompassing all bacterial phyla
as well as archaea (see table 1, for a complete list see Addi-

tional file 1). Only 31 genomes that do not possess a single SPFH family member, mostly from the mollicutes and
chlamydiae, were found (see Additional file 1).

In addition, a new subgroup (SPFH5) was described and
added as a SPFH family, thus a total of twelve SPFH subfamilies were identified in the end.

The bacterial SPFH family members can be divided in
twelve subfamilies
Using the programs CDART http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/lexington/lexing ton.cgi?cmd=rps, smart http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/
and
Pfam
http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ we identified 1486 SPFH family members.

The difficulty in identifying the new SPFH5 family as
members of the SPFH superfamily was largely due to the
relatively low sequence identity of their SPFH domain to
the canonical SPFH motif. It was formerly denoted as a
separate HMM called COG4864. This SPFH5 subgroup
(see Additional file 2a) holds one of the highest E values
to the generic SPFH hidden Markov Model defined by
Pfam entry PF01145 (HMM).

Length and sequence conservation outside of the SPFH
domain varied considerably (see Fig. 1a and Additional
file 3) between the different family members and is consistent with the difficulties encountered when trying to
compile a phylogenetic tree as mentioned by Rivera-Milla
et al. [4]. However, a clear division into 17 subgroups was
evident when we created our phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1b
and Additional file 3, a rectangular tree has been included
in Additional file 4). When incorporating other data such
as operon structures (see methods), these subgroups
could be grouped into 11 subfamilies (SPFH1-4 and 6–
12). 38 sequences, less than 3% of all sequences considered, could not be included due to insufficient statistical
support. We created additional HMMs for each subgroup
and tested each of them against members of the other subgroups to ensure that the subfamilies are indeed separated
from each other. The cut-off values which ensure membership in a given family have been summarized in Additional file 2b and can be seen in detail in Additional file 1,
sheet 5–21.

When analyzing all available data, especially the
sequences from rather exotic species (e.g. Algoriphagus sp.
PR1), a continuum of similarity to the SPFH1 and 2 subgroups could be seen that strongly suggests their relation
to the SPFH superfamily (Fig. 2). In addition, structural
predictions (Fig. 3), as well as a conserved operon structure (see section on Conserved operon structures of
most SPFH family members) compared with those of
well-known SPFH family members further emphasizes
that these SPFH5 proteins indeed belong to this family. In
detail, the classic SPFH members contain at least 1 hydrophobic stretch that most likely represent transmembrane
domains at the N terminal of the protein and a predicted
coiled-coil domain necessary for oligomerization located
in the C terminal section. The SPFH5 subgroup shares this
predicted structure (Fig. 3). The hydropathy plots also
share their basic structure (Fig. 3). To comply with the
nomenclature introduced by Tavernarakis et al. [1], we
denoted the different subgroups SPFH1 to SPFH 12 (Fig.
1a,b and Additional file 3).

As the vast majority of all sequenced bacterial genomes belong to the phylum proteobacteria, we have subdivided this phylum into its respective
classes.

Comparison of SPFH1,2 and 5 subgroup members
Comparison of SPFH1,2 and 5 subgroup members. Partial alignment and secondary structure annotation between
SPFH1,2 and 5, using the already known 3D structure of Flotillin2 (PDB ID: 1WIN). The alignment of the SPFH domains of different SPFH1,2 and SPFH5 members reveals a continuum of similarity between both groups, suggesting that SPFH5 members
belong to the SPFH superfamily.
Only 2 of the 12 subfamilies seem to be soluble (SPFH8
and 9), all other groups contain predicted transmembrane
regions at their N terminus. The distribution of the SPFH
family members among the bacterial phyla is shown in
table 1. Because the vast majority of all sequenced bacterial genomes belong to the phylum proteobacteria, we
have subdivided this phylum into its respective classes
[24].
SPFH subfamily description
The p-Stomatins [1] represent the largest and most widespread subgroup and are denoted as SPFH1 proteins. On
the amino acid level, representatives show a high similarity to the eukaryotic Stomatins (e.g. 29% identity and
67% similarity between human Stomatin2 and YbbK in E.
coli). In general, they are membrane proteins between 28
to 47 KDa and their hydrophilic part is oriented towards
the cytoplasm [11].

The eukaryotic Stomatins and the bacterial SPFH1 proteins form oligomeric complexes [11,25]. According to
primary structure, the SPFH1 subfamily can be further
divided into 2 subgroups, SPFH1a and 1b.

The SPFH2 subfamily (the p-Flotillins) shows a high
degree of similarity with the eukaryotic Flotillins/Reggies
(e.g. the identity between human Reggie1/Flotillin2 and
YuaG of B. subtilis is 37% and the similarity 74%).
Although their relatives can be found in every higher
eukaryote, they are restricted to about 20% of all bacterial
genomes investigated. This SPFH2 subfamily can also be
further divided into 3 subgroups according to their primary sequence.
Remarkable members of SPFH2b subgroup are the giant
SPFH2 proteins that are characterized by a strongly
expanded coiled-coiled region. These giant SPFH2 proteins are about 800–1000 aa in length.
The SPFH3a/b subfamily contains the HflK/C proteins.
This subfamily is the second largest SPFH subfamily in
bacteria, however, it is absent from archaeal genomes
(and from eukaryotes). The HflK/C oligomers have been
shown to interact with the FtsH protease [26] much like
the YbbK (SPFH1a). However, the SPFH3 proteins are oriented towards the periplasm [26] in contrast to YbbK
which is oriented towards the cytoplasm.

Chloroflexus aggregans (ZP_01514636).
The prokaryotic Prohibitins have been denoted as the
SPFH4 subfamily. It is the most diverse subfamily with
regard to its primary structure of member proteins. No
bacterial members of this group have been investigated so
far, however, the closely related eukaryotic Prohibitins
have been studied intensely. They are located in the inner
membrane of mitochondria and have been shown to
interact with the FtsH protease [27] there. Their function
has been described as chaperoning of mitochondrial
membrane proteins [28,29]. This suggests that prokaryotic Prohibitins might also function as membrane protein
quality control, a function that is required especially during osmotic changes and/or other rapid milieu changes.
The SPFH5 subfamily is mainly found in chlorobi, firmicutes and planctomycetes. As mentioned above, their
SPFH domain is poorly conserved; therefore most programs do not recognize them as members of the SPFH

family. However, compared to SPFH1b, their general primary structure and conserved operon structure strongly
suggest that these proteins belong to the SPFH superfamily. As of yet, no genome has been found that contains
both a SPFH1b and SPFH5 together and their operon
structure is similar, hence it seems likely that SPFH5
replaces SPFH1b in the relevant bacterial species. The
SPFH5 member YqfA from B. subtilis has been reported to
confer resistance against toxic peptides [13].
The other subfamilies (6–12) are rather small and contain
no documented member proteins. The SPFH8 and SPFH9
families show no predicted transmembrane domains and
are therefore most likely soluble.
Evidence for lateral gene transfer
A striking observation concerning the distribution of
SPFH family members among prokaryotes is the fact that

Page 7 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:10

some organisms have several SPFH family members,
while other even closely related species do not even possess one. Even organisms belonging to the same genus differ remarkably in their content of SPFH family members.
B. halodurans, for instance, harbours 4 SPFH family members (namely, the BH3500, BH3154, BH3155 and
BH1357 proteins), whereas the closely related B. licheniformis contains only 1 SPFH family member (the
BLi02729 protein). A distribution like this can hardly be
explained by selective gene duplication and loss events,
rather suggests lateral gene transfer as major reason for
these distribution patterns.
In addition, some SPFH families are rather equally distributed among the bacterial phyla (e.g. SPFH 1,2,4,8 and 9),
while other subgroups seem to be restricted almost exclusively to certain phyla (e.g. SPFH 3a/b is restricted to the
proteobacteria with only a few exceptions) and only a very
few other unrelated bacterial species contain a member of
these subgroups. To explain this pattern of occurrence we
either have to propose that the SPFH3 subgroup members
where originally included in the other genomes and were
eventually lost over time, or we have to consider other
mechanisms leading to this distribution, such as lateral
gene transfer. However, quite small subfamilies exist containing only a very few members (e.g. SPFH9-12) which
are distributed throughout a wide variety of unrelated species in different phyla that also cannot easily be explained
by gene duplication and/or gene loss.
Several approaches exist for the detection of lateral gene
transfer [5,6]. Among them are phylogenetic methods like
the unexpected ranking of sequence similarity among
homologs where genes from an organism show the
strongest similarity to a homolog in a distant taxon.
Indeed, the SPFH1 proteins of some species have a closer
evolutionary relationship with sequences in other genera
than with their closer relatives. For example, the SPFH1
gene YP_846427 in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans (deltaproteobacteria) shows 58% identity to the SPFH1 protein ZP_01189338 in the distantly related Halothermothrix
orenii (firmicutes), but only 34% identity to the
YP_356078 protein in the closely related Pelobacter carbinolicus (also deltaproteobacteria, Fig. 4a).
A similar observation can be made regarding most other
SPFH subgroups, e.g. the SPFH4 subgroup, where the
ZP_01910769 protein from Plesiocystis pacifica (deltaproteobacteria) shows a much closer relation (identity 30%)
to the EKD89170 (= ZP_02273092) protein from Fusobacterium nucleatum (fusobaceria) than to the ZP_01462952
protein from its close relative Stigmatella aurantiaca (deltaproteobacteria, 20% identity, Fig. 4b).
Moreover, we identified several SPFH family members
belonging to the SPFH1a subgroup that contain a 22 aa

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

insertion in the same position just prior to the SPFH
domain. Interestingly, these three proteins belong to
organisms that are only very distantly related, e.g. H. orenii
(phylum firmicutes), P. gingivalis (phylum bacteroidetes)
and S. fumaroxidans (phylum proteobacteria). Closer relatives to each of them have homologs without this insertion (Fig. 4c). For example, H. orenii contains the YbbK
protein with the above mentioned insertion, whereas its
close relative B. anthracis does not. Likewise, the closely
related B. subtilis lacks the ybbK completely. Although the
overall protein sequence is remarkably similar among
these three genes, the insertion shows almost no conservation at all, indicating that the inserted sequence may
not be essential for the protein function suggesting that
no evolutionary pressure acts on sequence conservation.
Other approaches used to detect lateral gene transfer
include the analysis of nucleotide composition or codon
usage biases [5]. Laterally transferred genes often show a
significantly higher or lower GC content, in total as well
as at the third codon position (GC3) due to the fact that
they originated in an organism with a different GC content [5]. However, when analysing the GC content of the
above mentioned proteins, only the NP_905503 protein
of P. gingivalis showed a significantly higher GC3 content
relative to the GC3 content of its whole genome
(YP_846427: GC 57.4%, GC3 76.4% compared with coding GC 60.2% and GC3 75.5% generally found in S.
fumaroxidans; ZP_01189338: GC 40.7%, GC3 38.8 compared with GC 40.8% and GC3 32.9% generally found in
H. orenii; NP_905503: GC 52.5%, GC3 64.5% compared
with GC 47.6% and GC3 50.0% generally found in P. gingivalis).
Another possible candidate gene for lateral transfer is the
SPFH5 member YP_144314 from Thermus thermophilus.
Although Thermus termophilus has an extremely high GC
content, the whole operon (the YP_144313 gene of
unknown function, the YP_144314 SPFH5 gene and the
YP_144315 NfeD gene) closely resembles relatives in firmicutes which display a very low GC content (most
SPFH5 members are found in firmicutes and planctomycetes). The whole operon has a GC (69.60%) and GC3
(92%) content that closely resembles the one found in all
Thermus coding sequences (GC: 69.35%).
Codon usage can also hint towards whether a gene has
become laterally transferred or not. Organisms do not use
all synonymous codons with the same frequency and
often show particular preferences for one of the several
codons that encode the same amino acid. Laterally transferred genes often still show the codon preference of the
organism they originated from [5]. Codon usage was
therefore analyzed for the above mentioned genes
(NP_505503, NP_846427, ZP_01189338 and the
YP_144313-15 operon). Fig. 4d illustrates that all except

Evidence for lateral gene transfer
Evidence for lateral gene transfer. (a) Phylogenetic tree of SPFH1 member proteins (BLOSUM matrix and neighbor joining
algorithm, 1000 bootstrap replications). The ZP_01189338, YP_846427 and NP_905503 proteins, originating from bacterial
species belonging to different phyla, are more closely related to each other than to SPFH1 proteins from bacterial species originating from the same phylum. (b) Phylogenetic tree of SPFH4 member proteins (BLOSUM matrix and neighbor joining algorithm, 1000 bootstrap replications). The ZP_01910769 gene from the deltaproteobacterium P. pacifica shows a closer
evolutionary relationship to proteins from other phyla than to SPFH4 proteins from other deltaproteobacteria. (c) A common
insertion in SPFH1 members in only distantly related species suggests lateral gene transfer. A 22 aa Insertion (aa 236–257) can
be found in a few distantly related species, but in more closely related species it is missing, thereby suggesting lateral gene
transfer. Compare YP_846427 of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans (with the insertion) and YP_356078 of Pelobacter carbinolicus,
both belonging to proteobacteria; compare ZP_01189338 (with insertion) of Halothermothrix orenii and NP_844475 of Bacillus
anthracis, which belong to firmicutes; compare NP_905503 (with insertion) of Porphyromonas gingivalis and ZP_00593072 from
Prosthecochloris aestuarii which belong to bacteroidetes. (d) Codon usage of the NP_905503 gene (1) compared with codon
usage of total coding sequences in P. gingivalis (2), for the YP_846427 gene (3) compared with total coding sequences of P.
fumaroxidans (4), of the ZP_01189338 gene (5) compared with total coding sequences of H. orenii (6) and of the YP_144313-15
operon (7) compared with T. thermophilus total coding sequences (8). Synonymous codons are shown to the right of each
amino acid and color-coded to match the percent usage indicated by the bars.

the NP_905503 gene showed only slight deviations from
the overall codon usage of their respective species, which
fails to provide additional support for lateral gene transfer
in these cases. However, the NP_905503 gene revealed
modest differences, especially in the codon usage for proline, lysine, threonine, glutamine, serine or valine (Fig.
4d).
Conserved operon structures of most SPFH family
members
Recently the SPFH1 subgroup member PH1510 of the
archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was reported to interact
with the NfeD protein homolog PH1511, a serine protease [10]. Moreover, PH1510 forms an operon with
PH1511 thereby sharing the regulation and expression
with this NfeD homolog. The SPFH subgroups sequences
are very diverse therefore common ancestry is difficult to
assess. A conserved operon structure would clearly hint
towards common ancestry. We therefore examined the
genetic vicinity of the known SPFH proteins for conservation of operon structures and for the presence of possible
other NfeD homologs.

As expected, most (229 from 353) of the other members
with close similarities in the SPFH1 subgroup such as the
YbbK and the SO4129/SO4128 proteins share an operon
with a NfeD homolog (in this case, YbbJ and SO4130,
respectively), thereby indicating common origin for these
subgroup members.
These NfeD homologs form a protein family that we
denoted NfeD1, with SPFH1a members paired to NfeD1a
and SPFH1b members paired to NfeD1b subfamily members. In some species, a gene duplication event has obviously occurred replicating the SPFH1 member which
results in operons of the NfeD1a-SPFH1a.1-SPFH1a.2
type.
Interestingly, the NfeD1b proteins differ from NfeD1a
insofar as that they contain a ClpP protease domain at
their N terminus, thereby indicating that the NfeD1bSPFH1b operon may have arisen from a recombination
event that translocated the NfeD1a-SPFH1a operon
directly adjacent to a ClpP protease (Fig. 5). In an intergenomic comparison, the distribution of both operons
seems random; sometimes, both can be found in one
genome whereas in other genomes, only one can be identified. In some genomes, no NfeD could be found in the
vicinity of the SPFH1 members. It is difficult to assess
whether there are no partner NfeD proteins present or
whether they have escaped detection, probably because
they are not located in the same operon as the SPFH1
genes and/or to a larger degree they have diverged from
the consensus sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

As mentioned above, the search for new SPFH family
members revealed a completely new subgroup. The
SPFH5 group shows a relatively low sequence similarity to
the other family members. However, these proteins (e.g.
YqfA in B. subtilis) clearly form an operon with another
protein (e.g. YqeZ in B. subtilis) which is a PH1511
homolog (including the ClpP protease motif) thereby not
only strengthening the membership of the YqfA (SPFH5)
family in the SPFH protein superfamily, but also strongly
suggesting that the whole SPFH5 subgroup evolved from
the SPFH1b subgroup.
We extended our search of NfeD homologs to the SPFH2
subgroup, the prokaryotic Flotillin/reggie homologs. The
SPFH2 group members (e.g. yuaG from B. subtilis) form an
operon with another gene, namely yuaF (and, only in B.
subtilis, also with yuaI). Whereas no significant sequence
similarity between NfeD and YuaI was found, low similarity could be detected between NfeD and some YuaF proteins. Indeed, YuaI belongs to the family of GCN5-related
acetyl transferases.
Despite low similarity at the amino acid level, structural
predictions and hydrophobicity plots resulted in remarkably similar characteristics for known NfeD members and
YuaF, thereby suggesting that YuaF is a lowly conserved
NfeD homolog. In detail, most NfeD homologs have a
length of 140–150 aa and consist of 3 hydrophobic
stretches at their N terminal region followed by a short
hydrophilic stretch and a soluble all-beta domain whose
structure (PH0471 from P. horikoshii) has been recently
solved [PDB ID: 2EXD]. This general structure can also be
seen in the yuaF gene. However, structural predictions
have a high degree of uncertainty and therefore conclusions drawn only on predictions have a weak basis.
Recently, we have determined the 3D structure of YuaFs
soluble C-terminus by NMR spectroscopy [30]. Indeed,
the solution structure reveals a striking similarity to a
known, SPFH-associated NfeD protein, PH0471, from the
archaeon P. horikoshii [PDB ID: 2EXD] [31], despite very
low sequence identity (21%) (Fig. 6).
In addition, we have determined NMR chemical shifts
(BMRB entry 15664) in the soluble C-terminus of YqiJ of
E. coli, the gene of which is found in one operon together
with the reggie-like gene yqiK. Indeed, the deviations of
Hα, Cα, Cβ, and CO chemical shifts from values found in
random coil structures [32] strongly support the secondary structure content found by prediction algorithms.
Both the structure of YuaF, as well as the chemical shift
assignments of YqiJ further support our hypothesis that all
SPFH-associated NfeD proteins share a common structure
and thus have a common origin.

Figure 5
Hypothetical scenario of a recombination event that created the NfeD1b protein
Hypothetical scenario of a recombination event that created the NfeD1b protein.
In the SPFH2 subgroup, the operon structure is therefore
also conserved insofar as a putative NfeD homolog (YuaF/
YqiJ/Syc1604_d) shares an operon with one (YuaG/YqiK)
or two (Syc1607_d/Syc1608_d) SPFH2 family members.
In cyanobacteria, a gene duplication of the SPFH family
members similar to the one in the SO4130/SO4129/
SO4128 operon obviously has occurred.

0.352 (SPFH2c and NfeD2c), 0.511 (SPFH2b and
NfeD2b) and 0.911 (SPFH2a and NfeD2a), underlining
the fact that they have co-evolved together with their
SPFH partners. The NfeD1b subgroup that accompanies
the SPFH1b subgroup has been omitted in this analysis
because the ClP protease domain present in these NfeD
proteins prevents proper sequence alignment.

Figure 7 summarizes all operonic combinations of the different families. In correspondence with the SPFH1a and
the SPFH2a-c subgroups, the corresponding NfeD proteins also form a strikingly similar phylogenetic tree with
corresponding subgroups (NfeD1a and NfeD2a-c, see
Additional file 5).

The other SPFH subgroups have no neighbouring putative
NfeD homologs and none of their accompanying genes
show identifiable sequence or structure conservation to
other genes that share operon structures with other
known SPFH family members.

Discussion
To quantify this, Pearson's correlation coefficients were
calculated. Whereas the overall correlation between the
SPFH1 and 2 trees and their respective NfeD partners was
0.495, the individual correlations between the different
subgroups varied between 0.255 (SPFH1a and NfeD1a),

Most bacterial genomes contain at least one SPFH family
member
In this study, we have analyzed 497 fully sequenced bacterial genomes and identified 1486 SPFH superfamily
members from 466 genomes. Phylogenetic analysis
Page 11 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:10

revealed 17 subgroups which could, when taking other
criteria such as operon structures into account, be grouped
into 12 subfamilies. The four largest subfamilies which
correspond to the already mentioned p-Stomatins, p-Flotillins, HflC/Ks and p-Prohibitins account for roughly
75% of all sequences identified and were denoted SPFH14, the additional 8 subgroups were numbered sequentially. Of those smaller subgroups, only the SPFH11 subgroup revealed a split into 2 separate groups in the
phylogenetic tree. However, as the SPFH11a and b members invariantly occur adjacent to each other and are
organized into one operon, they most likely originated in
a gene duplication and were grouped together to reflect
this.
SPFH member proteins were not found in 31 genomes,
although we cannot rule out the possibility that they only
escaped our notice due to extremely low sequence similarity.
Interestingly, most of those bacterial species without any
identifiable SPFH family member are endosymbiontic or
endoparasitic bacteria (e.g. the mollicutes or the chlamydiae) whose surrounding milieu is mostly isoosmotic or
constant.
One of the more intensely investigated members, the
SPFH2a YuaG gene in Bacillus subtilis, is part of the sigmaW regulon, a regulon that is activated in conditions of
cellular stress like high salt, alkaline shock and ethanol
stress [33], conditions that arise, for example, during diurnal changes in a soil environment. Moreover, various sigmaW controlled genes render expressing bacteria resistant
to membrane-compromising antibiotics in other bacteria
[13]. Our investigations showed no growth defects in
YuaG deletion mutants under conditions of cellular stress
[M. Hinderhofer, unpublished data]. However, there may
be no knock-out phenotype as laboratory strains tend to
loose such genes and other parts of the protective machinery may have already been lost or conditions may not be
competitive. It may therefore be perfectly possible that
SPFH proteins confer a slight, but not vital advantage in
the cellular reaction to rapidly changing milieus, which
would make them good candidates for lateral gene transfer, much like antibiotic resistance genes.
Evidence for lateral gene transfer
It has been stated earlier that the discrepancy between species and gene trees in bacterial SPFH2 proteins questions
the relatedness of bacterial members to metazoan Flotillins [4]. However, there are many reasons that could produce such a result and mask phylogenetic relationships,
e.g. mixture of orthologs and paralogs, unequal rates of
evolution, the long branch attraction artefact or lateral
gene transfer [5-8]. Lateral gene transfer has often been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

identified in bacterial genomes as being one of the major
sources of genetic diversity in prokaryotes [34-36].
Indeed, the diverse pattern of SPFH protein occurrences
even in closely related bacterial species suggests a remarkable amount of lateral gene transfer also in case of the
SPFH proteins. Phylogenetic evidence such as a strong
incongruency between the species and the SPFH protein
trees among prokaryotes supports this view. Detection of
three SPFH1 family members from different genera with a
similarly sized insertion at the same position shows that
the SPFH1 sequences of some species have a closer evolutionary relationship with sequences in other genera than
with their closer relatives. This suggests a common ancient
origin and that lateral gene transfer has occurred among
unrelated genera. Interestingly, the overall protein
sequence among these three genes is remarkably similar,
indicating evolutionary pressure leading to sequence conservation. This is not true for the above mentioned insertion which seems to be quite irrelevant for protein
function hence no evolutionary pressure for sequence
conservation is evident.
Other approaches used to detect laterally transferred genes
such as differences in GC content or codon usage only
showed slight deviations from the respective species averages for most genes investigated, indicating that the transfer event happened a long time ago and characteristics
have already started to conform to their new genomic surroundings. Only the NP_905503 gene from P. gingivalis
showed modest deviations in GC3 content and in the coding preferences for some amino acids which supports the
theory that this gene has been laterally transferred.
This suggests that at least part of the complex pattern of
SPFH protein distribution probably originated from lateral gene transfer rather than classical gene duplication
and/or loss events. The lack of observable differences in
GC content and codon usage in most genes investigated
indicates that the transfer event seems to have happened
quite some time ago.
Operon structure
We have shown that most of the SPFH1 and 5 members
are located in an operon together with a NfeD protein
homolog. The SPFH2 family members are also located in
an operon together with another protein which shows a
very weak similarity to known NfeD proteins (e.g. YuaF
from B. subtilis exhibits only 21% sequence identity with
PH0471 from the archaeon P. horikoshii). The structure of
those SPFH2 accompanying genes however is remarkably
similar to the structure of known NfeD genes, thereby suggesting that these genes (e.g. YuaF) are minimally conserved NfeD homologs. In addition, phylogenetic trees of
SPFH1 and 2 genes are remarkably similar to trees of their

Figure 7
Representative operon structures of SPFH and accompanying NfeD genes
Representative operon structures of SPFH and accompanying NfeD genes. In some cases, there may be additional
genes organized inside these operons that have been left out for clarity.
NfeD partner genes (NfeD1 and 2, see Additional file 5),
indicating that both proteins evolved together and also
have been transferred laterally together.
Occasionally, in some genomes SPFH1 or SPFH2 family
members were found that are closely related to those
groups, but that do build single gene cistrons lacking an
identifiable NfeD (in 50 genomes we found an SPFH1
without identifiable NfeD1 and in 17 genomes an SPFH2
without NfeD2). However, their close similarity to the
ones in operons with an NfeD part suggests that the first
were derived from the second by a gene duplication and
subsequent loss of the NfeD part. Furthermore it is possible that they interact with a known NfeD partner from
another operon or with one from a neighbouring operon
that, due to low sequence conservation, escaped our
notice.
No NfeD homolog could be identified for the other
(SPFH3,4, 6–12) subfamilies.
However, the sequence similarity between SPFH4 and the
eukaryotic Prohibitins suggests a similar topology (that is,

they most likely are oriented towards the periplasm),
much like the SPFH3 subfamily, although this has not yet
been tested,. With some rare exceptions, SPFH4 family
members do not occur together with SPFH3 family members in the same genome, which suggests that the SPFH4
proteins may replace the SPFH3 proteins. Therefore, taking into account the relatively large sequence similarity to
the SPFH1 and SPFH3 subgroups, a scenario by which the
SPFH4 operon developed from the SPFH1 operon
through deletion of the NfeD protein homolog is possible. The SPFH3 operon would then originate from the
SPFH4 operon by a simple duplication event. This is further supported by the fact that the SPFH1 family member
YbbK in E. coli (together with its NfeD homolog YbbJ) has
been shown to interact (as multimers) with the FtsH protease [11], a behaviour which has also been shown for the
SPFH3 (HflK/C) multimers [26] and the eukaryotic Prohibitin multimers [37].
Although this interaction has not yet been shown for the
SPFH4 proteins, the sequence and predicted structural
similarity to the eukaryotic Prohibitins proteins and the
SPFH3 (HflK/C) proteins suggests a similar behaviour for
Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:10

these genes and therefore would additionally point
towards a common origin for SPFH4 and SPFH1,2,5 and
3 proteins.
Presently several interaction partners with eukaryotic
SPFH family members have been identified [38,39],
although no NfeD proteins have been found in eukaryotes yet.
As is reflected in their denomination as p-Prohibitins, the
prokaryotic SPFH4 members show a very close similarity
to eukaryotic Prohibitins. As mitochondria are thought to
have developed from alphaproteobacteria, it is intriguing
to speculate that the eukaryotic Prohibitins (that are
located in the inner membrane of mitochondria) entered
the eukaryotic genome via such endosymbiosis.
At this point we cannot find any additional data corroborating common origin for the other subgroups. We cannot
however rule out the possibility that these SPFH subgroups also interact with one of the known or even
unknown NfeD homologs although they do not share the
same operon. It may also be possible that other, weakly
conserved NfeD homologs, are contained in the regulon
encompassing the other SPFH genes that escaped our
search.
Common ancestry of most SPFH family members
Weak sequence similarities alone have been questioned to
be a good basis to infer common ancestry upon [4]. However, we propose an evolutionary relationship for the
SPFH families and their putative NfeD partners as shown
in Fig. 8 in conjunction with other data such as a common
operon structure and functional aspects. According to this,
a proto-SPFH together with a proto-NfeD gave rise to the
SPFH1 (p-Stomatins) family (and, maybe directly or via
SPFH1, to the SPFH5 subfamily). This SPFH1 family
might then be the origin of the SPFH2 family (prokaryotic
Flotillin/reggie homologs) and, by loss of the NfeD part
and duplication of the SPFH gene, of the HflC/K (SPFH3)
proteins. This step may have arisen via the SPFH4 (p-Prohibitins) proteins. Although the topology (orientation
towards the cytoplasm or towards the periplasm) of the
SPFH4 members is still unknown, their similarity to both
the SPFH3 and the eukaryotic Prohibitins suggests that
they may be oriented towards the periplasm, as well. The
SPFH5 group develops either by duplication of the SPFH1
operon and fusion of the NfeD gene with a protease or
directly from the proto-SPFH. The origin of the other
groups still remains unclear. However, those groups are
mostly rather small, and most of them show a close similarity to one of the main subgroups, therefore at least
some of them might be considered as special subgroups of
one of the larger groups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/10

Origin of eukaryotic SPFH members
Earlier investigations mentioned the lack of regions of
synteny between the eukaryotic SPFH family members,
the fact that the sequence similarity between the different
groups (Stomatins, Prohibitins and Flotillins/Reggies) is
restricted to only a few amino acids, and the lack of a consistent phylogenetic tree obtained when comparing their
sequences including prokaryotic ones, suggesting that
those families might have evolved by convergent evolution [4]. In addition, it has been stated that the discrepancy between species and gene trees in bacterial SPFH2
proteins questions the relatedness of the bacterial members to the metazoan Flotillins [4]. This question is difficult to assess, as there is no common accepted phylogeny
for bacterial groups. In addition, horizontal gene transfer
plays a major role in bacteria which further masks phylogenetic relationships [34-36]. The evidence of a high rate
of horizontal gene transfer in the case of the bacterial
SPFH proteins and their accompanying NfeD partners as
shown here would therefore explain this discrepancy even
if an accepted model of the phylogenetic relationships
between the prokaryotic phyla existed. In addition,
sequence length, which differs between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic family members, is not a good indicator for or
against common origin, as in the case of the giant SPFH2s.
Even within a group clearly related proteins can be found
that differ greatly in length, mostly because the predicted
coiled-coil region is elongated (see Fig. 1a and Additional
file 3).

Although we have no direct evidence that the prokaryotic
and the metazoan SPFH families are related, some facts
are intriguing and speak against convergent evolution and
for common origin.
First, we could show that at least 4 (or 5) of the major
prokaryotic SPFH families (that encompass roughly 75%
of all found bacterial SPFH proteins) share a common origin. Therefore, at the bacterial level, the p-Stomatins
(SPFH1, and SPFH5), p-Flotillins/Reggies (SPFH2) and pProhibitins (SPFH4 and, most likely belonging to them,
SPFH3) are clearly related not only due to their sequence
identity, but also due to their common operon structure
and functional aspects. In the case of the Prohibitins, a
functional link between the prokaryotic SPFH3 and 4
families and the eukaryotic Prohibitins exists in form of
their interaction with the FtsH protease and their topology
hence common origin is rather likely. For the Flotillins
and the Stomatins this functional link is still missing,
although priliminary observations speak of a membrane
distribution for prokaryotic Flotillins/Reggies that is strikingly similar to that in eukaryots [Graumann and Dempwolf, personal communication].

Model of SPFH and NfeD coevolution
Model of SPFH and NfeD coevolution. Hypothetical model of prokaryotic SPFH and NfeD protein coevolution, based on
the phylogenetic relationships and operon structures.
In light of these findings it becomes unrealistic to hypothesize that in eukaryotes, as with prokaryotes, three major
families should also have developed purely by convergent
evolution which share the same basic features and whose
member proteins, when included in the phylogenetic analysis, sort into the correct subfamilies of their prokaryotic
counterparts (e.g. eukaryotic Flotillins sort into the SPFH2
subgroup without any tweaking or manual adjustment).
Similarities in the p-Stomatins (SPFH1) to the eukaryotic
Stomatins, the HflC/K (SPFH3) and SPFH4 proteins
(including function and their membrane topology) to the
eukaryotic Prohibitins, and the SPFH2 proteins to the
eukaryotic Flotillins/Reggies would then suggest that the
origin of the three eukaryotic SPFH families lies in the three
major prokaryotic SPFH1/5, SPFH2 and SPFH3/4 groups.
Another possible scenario includes the evolution of the
three eukaryotic families from only one prokaryotic family.

lies have evolved independently, or that at least the 2
newly evolved of those 3 eukaryotic families then transferred back to prokaryotes via lateral gene transfer and, in
addition, somehow each bacterial family then acquired
their NfeD counterparts. As no eukaryotic NfeD
homologs have been identified so far, they either have
been lost without a trace in all eukaryotic families or have
been acquired independently by most prokaryotic families – a rather unlikely event.
Our scenario explains the diversity of the eukaryotic SPFH
members and the inability to find regions of synteny
between the Flotillins, Prohibitins and Stomatins which
would be probable if all eukaryotic families were derived
from a single eukaryotic ancestor. In addition, it would be
unnecessary to propose the convergent evolution of three
eukaryotic and twelve prokaryotic families.

Conclusion
However, such a scenario would either implicate that the
prokaryotic counterparts of these eukaryotic SPFH fami-

In this study, we show that at least 4 (most likely 5) of the
12 prokaryotic SPFH protein subgroups that encompass

almost 75% of all prokaryotic SPFH members are linked
together by a similar operon structure and functional similarities (such as interaction with the FtsH protease). This
suggests that they share a common origin. Their similarity
to the three major eukaryotic SPFH families, as well as
functional similarities suggests that the eukaryotic SPFH
families originated from different prokaryotic SPFH families rather than from one. This explains the difficulties in
obtaining a consistent phylogenetic tree for the eukaryotic
SPFH members. In addition, lateral gene transfer is suggested as a source for the diverse occurrence pattern of different SPFH proteins and their accompanying Nfed
partners.
