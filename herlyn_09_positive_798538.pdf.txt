Abstract
Background: KCNE1 represents the regulatory beta-subunit of the slowly activating delayed
rectifier potassium channel (IKs). Variants of KCNE1 have repeatedly been linked to the long-QT
syndrome (LQTS), a disorder which predisposes to deafness, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, syncope,
and sudden cardiac death.
Results: We here analyze the evolution of the common Gly38Ser variant (rs1805127), using
genomic DNAs, complementary DNAs, and HEK293-expressed variants of altogether 19
mammalian species. The between species comparison reveals that the human-specific Gly38Ser
polymorphism evolved under strong positive Darwinian selection, probably in adaptation to specific
challenges in the fine-tuning of IKs channels. The involved amino acid exchanges (Asp > Gly, Gly >
Ser) are moderately radical and do not induce apparent changes in posttranslational modification.
According to population genetic analyses (HapMap phase II) a heterozygote advantage accounts for
the maintenance of the Gly38Ser polymorphism in humans. On the other hand, the expression of
the 38Ser allele seems to be disadvantageous under certain conditions, as suggested by the sporadic
deficiency of 38Ser-coding mRNAs in heterozygote Central Europeans and the depletion of
homozygotes 38Ser in the Yoruban sample.
Conclusion: We speculate that individual differences in genomic imprinting or genomic recoding
might have contributed to conflicting results of recent association studies between Gly38Ser
polymorphism and QT phenotype. The findings thus highlight the relevance of mRNA data in future
association studies of genotypes and clinical disorders. To the best of our knowledge, they
moreover provide first time evidence for a unique pattern; i.e. coincidence of positive Darwinian
selection and polymorphism with a sporadically suppressed expression of one allele.

Background
The potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family,
member 1 (KCNE1)-gene is located on chromosome
21q22.12 and stretches over three exons, with the coding
381 bp being confined to the third and last exon [1]. The
encoded protein (KCNE1, also termed minK) is a singlespan membrane protein of about 14.4 kDa that coassembles with KCNQ1 (potassium voltage-gated channel,
KQT-like subfamily, member 1), thus forming the slowly
activating delayed rectifier potassium (IKs) channel of
heart muscle, inner ear, and a variety of other tissues [2-4].
Upon docking of KCNE1 to KCNQ1, activation and deactivation kinetics of IKs channels are slowed down by
nearly two orders of magnitude [5]. This renders KCNE1
an interesting candidate for studying the causes of cardiovascular diseases and congenital as well as aquired hearing loss. Particularly, the inherited long-QT syndrome
(LQTS) has repeatedly been linked to polymorphisms of
KCNE1 [e.g. [6-8]]. LQTS occurs with or without accompanying deafness and is characterized by delayed ventricular
repolarization,
visible
as
a
prolonged
electrocardiographic QT interval. The dysfunction predisposes patients to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, syncope,
and sudden cardiac death. As sudden death may occur
with the first syncope and LQTS diagnosis based solely on
electrocardiography is neither sensitive nor specific
enough, it is of outmost importance to screen subjects at
risk for a genetic predisposition to LQTS.
Several population-wide screens have recently been carried out to check for the relevance of the supposed association between genomic KCNE1 variants and QT length.
Two of these studies identified QT-modifying single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding regions
of the KCNE1 locus, in particular in intron 2 [9] and in a
putative promoter region [10]. Family based association
analysis showed a significant association between QT
length and an A/G-SNP at nucleotide position 112
(A112G; rs1805127) that codes for a glycine/serine polymorphism at codon 38 (Gly38Ser) [11]. The same SNP is
undisputably associated with mortality and T-wave alternans in electrocardiograms [12] as well as with high noise
susceptibility and noise-induced hearing loss [13]. On the
other hand, an association between Gly38Ser and QT
length has been questioned by other association studies
[14-16]. Different genetic backgrounds of the studied
populations have been discussed to account for the conflicting results. For example, KCNE1 may be in linkage
disequilibrium to adjacent causal variants only in some
ethnic groups, but not in others [15]. However, since all
available association studies exclusively used genomic
information, some additional factors might have had a
confounding effect on the results of association studies.
Firstly, one of both alleles might have been silenced in
some individuals, due to genomic imprinting or null

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/188

mutations in the regulatory region. Secondly, genomic
recoding at the mRNA level might have contributed to the
observed patterns. According to this, an adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) might sporadically have
recoded the adenosine at KCNE1 codon 38 (AGU) to inosine (IGU), which is equivalent to guanosine (GGU) for
the translational machinery [17]. To pick up this thought
we compared allele frequencies of genomic (gDNAs) and
complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from a total of 43 human
individuals. Furthermore to get an idea about the selective
forces behind KCNE1 evolution we analyzed the available
human population genetic data (HapMap phase II) as
well as orthologs (gDNAs and cDNAs) from 18 nonhuman mammals (Eutheria).

Results
Genotyping of human samples and allele frequencies in
the gDNA/cDNA comparison
Direct sequencing of KCNE1-coding gDNAs revealed that
19 out of 29 lymphoblastoid cell lines were heterozygous
for Gly38Ser, while six and four cell lines were homozygote for 38Ser and 38Gly, respectively. KCNE1 sequencing
of gDNAs of 14 brain samples (frontal cortices) added
another five heterozygotes Gly38Ser, four homozygotes
38Ser, and five homozygotes 38Gly. All genotypes were
confirmed once (brain samples) and twice (cell lines)
using a reverse pyrosequencing assay (Tables 1 and 2). We
take the wide agreement of the results from direct
sequencing and pyrosequencing and particularly the
exclusive detection of one allele in homozygotes as evidence for the reliability of the present reverse pyrosequencing assay. Twofold parallel pyrosequencing of
cDNAs coding for KCNE1 widely reflected the patterns
described for gDNAs (Tables 1 and 2): heterozygotes displayed an about 50:50 distribution of 38Gly- and 38Sercoding alleles. Moreover, when homozygotes had been
analysed, the pyrosequencing assay revealed an extensive
(mostly absolute) excess of either the 38Gly- or the 38Sercoding allele. In contrast to the general agreement of the
allele frequencies inferred from gDNAs and cDNAs, we
found exclusively 38Gly-coding alleles in the cDNAs of
three individuals (cell lines 24 and 26; brain sample 11)
that had been genotyped as heterozygotes Gly38Ser. Brain
sample 11 was conspicuous on the gDNA level, too:
though clearly heterozygous, pyrosequencing persistently
detected less 38Ser- (12–22.2%) than 38Gly-coding alleles (88–77.8%) in a total of eight parallel measurements.

We additionally pyrosequenced the highly heterozygous
A/G-SNP rs11254413 of the housekeeping gene tRNA
aspartic acid methyltransferase 1 (TRDMT1). Based on
gDNAs and cDNAs we found no evidence for a complete
depletion of one allele in the cDNAs of 18 heterozygous
lymphoblastoid cell lines. Instead, all heterozygotes were
confirmed on the cDNA level. This suggests that neither

Population genetic analyses of HapMap phase II data
As can be seen from Table 3, the Gly38Ser polymorphism
is present not only in our own sample, but also in the
genepools of those populations that had been genotyped
in the course of phase II of the HapMap project (Central
Europeans, Han-Chinese from Beijing, Japanese from
Tokyo, Yoruba from Ibadan/Nigeria). Of particular interest is the finding of both alleles in sub-Saharan Yoruba, as
this population is commonly regarded as the deepest coalescing among the sampled ones (see e.g. [18]). Thereafter, it is very likely that the A/G-SNP at KCNE1 codon 38
was already present before the divergence of modern
humans. Table 3 moreover illustrates a general trend for
selection in favour of heterozygotes: compared to the
expectation, there are persistently less observed homozy-

gotes (38Ser, 38Gly) and more observed heterozygotes
(Gly38Ser) in Central Europeans, Han Chinese, and
Yoruba. Consequently, Fstat calculates a negative fixation
index, Fis, for these samples. In case of the Yoruban sample, homozygotes 38Ser are even absent, though 11
homozygotes 38Ser are to be expected given the allele frequencies. The Yoruban sample is also specific in that
probability test statistic (Fstat) indicates a significant (pvalue = 0.003) heterozygote excess exclusively in this sample, even when the p-value has been adjusted for multiple
testing (strict Bonferroni correction). Finally, it is worth to
note that Japanese from Tokyo represent the only exception from the general trend for selection in favour of heterozygotes: expected and observed genotype counts are
the same with respect to homozygotes and nearly identical regarding the heterozygotes. We expect that a future
extension of the HapMap dataset will change some details
of the picture outlined above. For instance, it appears
probable to us that additional data on the Yoruban population will contribute homozygotes 38Ser. It may moreover happen that the reported extent of heterozygote excess
in Central Europeans, Han Chinese, and Yoruba will
change with additional data. However, we are confident
that the general trends inferred from the present dataset
(heterozygote excess in the one or other population) will
be confirmed in the future.

Comparison of the observed (O) and expected (E) genotype counts reveals a general trend for less observed homozygotes and more observed
heterozygotes than expected. In case of the Yoruban sample, the heterozygote excess is even significant (see fixation index, Fis, and probability for
deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, p-value).

There was no evidence for a polymorphism of the codon
under scrutiny in any of the non-human species for which
SNP data were available at the time of the study (chimpanzee, Bornean orangutan, house mouse, Norway rat,
and dog). Neither did databank mining reveal any hint for
genomic recoding of this particular codon in the nonhuman sample, as indicated by identical triplets in the
gDNA/cDNA comparison in Bornean orangutan, house
mouse, Norway rat, guinea pig, European rabbit, cattle,
and cat (see Table 4 for scientific species names and accession numbers).

In line with the overall prevalence of GAT (Asp) at the site
corresponding to codon 38 in human KCNE1, baseml
suggests GAT as the ancestral character state at the base of
the tree (see Figure 1). Mapping the extant as well as the
ancestral character states onto the phylogeny in Figure 1
suggests that only few evolutionary steps occurred since
the last common ancestor of the studied species. Thus,
two independent synonymous substitutions from GAT to
GAC can be assumed for the terminal branch to cat and
for the internal branch uniting pika and European rabbit.
Moreover, the cattle and horse branches are characterized

The moderately radical character of the amino acid
exchanges argues for their effectiveness without disrupting
protein function (for amino acid classification see, e.g.
[19]). In accordance with the human-specificity of the
Ser38Gly polymorphism, branch-site analysis (codeml)
provides highly significant support (p-value = 0.01) for
the branch-site test of positive selection across the human
foreground. Not surprisingly, codon 38 of human KCNE1
belongs to the specific site class (p-value = 0.970) that is
under positive selection across the human foreground (ω2
= 187), but is under negative selection (ω2a = 0.073) or
neutral evolution (ω2b = 1) across the remaining phylogeny (Table 5; Figure 1). The other codon sites belonging to
this specific site class are codons 105 and 115. The high ωvalue assigned to the specific site class (= 187) most likely
results from the short branch leading to modern humans.
Irrespectively, there is no doubt about the nature of the
selective force acting particularly on codon 38 of human
KCNE1, i.e. strong positive Darwinian selection (Figure
1).

by a parallel non-synonymous substitution changing the
coding from GAT to GAG. However, the associated
exchange from Asp to Glu is conservative since both
amino acids are negatively charged (for amino acid classification see, e.g. [19]). The functional consequences of the
Asp/Glu shift can thus be regarded as neglegible.
The human stem lineage represents the only exception
from the wide phylogenetic conservation of codon 38 and
its counterparts (Figure 1). According to the presence of
the Gly38Ser polymorphism in all human populations
studied (e.g. [9,11,12,14-16] and present study), two nonsynonymous transitions can be assumed for the branch
leading to modern humans: 1) a change from GAT to
GGT, and, thus, from Asp to glycine (Gly), and 2) a shift
from GGT to AGT, which corresponds to a Gly to Ser
replacement at the amino acid level (Figure 1). Both, the
Asp/Gly shift (negatively charged/hydrophobic) and the
Gly/Ser shift (hydrophobic/polar) are moderately radical.

Motif search and Western blotting
According to results from PROSITE motif search the
human 38Gly variant is characterized by a glycosaminoglycan attachment motif (SerGlyXGly) spanning from amino acid positions 37–40 that is absent in
the 38Ser variant and the non-human KCNE1 orthologs.
Motiv search moreover found motivs for N-glycosylation,
protein kinase C phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation
offside the glycosaminoglycan attachment motif (not
shown). To adress the question whether the evolution of
the Gly38Ser polymorphism in humans entailed differences in glycosylation, we expressed different KCNE1 variants in human HEK293 cells and analysed the KCNE1
proteins by Western blotting (Figure 2A and 2B). Beside
the 15 kDa KCNE1 proteins, most probably representing
the nascent forms (Figure 2A, n) we could also detect
slower migrating KCNE1 proteins, representing the
mature, posttranslationally modified proteins (Figure 2A,
m). The mobility shift resulted from N-glycosylation as
addition of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin
resulted in complete loss of slower migrating KCNE1 variants (Figure 2B, lanes 2, 4 and 6). However, both human
variants and the chimpanzee ortholog of KCNE1 (representing the ancestral 38Asp situation) revealed no obvious differences in mobility. This shows that all KCNE1
variants are highly N-glycosylated and suggests that the
38Gly variant does not confer an extra glucosaminoglycan
modification. Therefore, we conclude that the presumed
functional differences linked to the specific evolution of
KCNE1 codon 38 in humans are not due to differences in
posttranslational modification. Instead, they seem to be
caused exclusively by the moderately radical character of
the involved amino acid exchanges (Asp > Gly, Gly > Ser).

Discussion
Deviating allelic copy numbers in one heterozygote
Gly38Ser brain sample
As outlined above, we consider the presented pyrosequencing results as very reliable, because all gDNA based
runs confirmed the genotypes inferred from direct
sequencing. This applies particularly to brain sample 11
whose deviating allelic copy numbers had even been validated by a total of eight measurements. It can thus be
excluded that technical problems account for the about
20:80 distribution of 38Ser- and 38Gly-coding alleles in
the gDNA of brain sample 11. Accumulating experimental
evidence suggests that neural progenitor cells often display loss and/or gain of chromosomes. Consequently, a
considerable percentage of aneuploid neurons populate
the mature brain [20]. Chromosome painting studies, for
instance, revealed approximately 4% chromosome 21
aneuploid cells (both postmitotic neurons and non-neural cells) in normal adult human brain [21]. These aneuploid neurons are projected into the appropriate
anatomical areas and appear to be functionally active
[22]. In this light, genetic mosaicism must be considered
a frequently observable feature of the human brain. The
most likely explanation for the uneven distribution of
chromosome 21 alleles in brain sample 11 is gain and/or
loss of a chromosome 21 copy in a relatively high proportion of cells in the dissected cortex area. Another possibility could be a uniparental disomy for chromosome 21
(UPD21), since the sampled man was phenotypically normal, what is a general feature of UPD21 [23,24]. However,
as the question for the underlying mechanism is second
ranked in the present context we did not further investigate the alternatives herein.
Sporadic deficiency of 38Ser-coding mRNAs in
heterozygote humans
Four different mechanisms could principally explain the
observed absence of 38Ser-coding alleles in cDNAs from
three individuals with a heterozygous genotype (two lymphoblastoid cell lines and brain sample 11): i) monoallelic expression of the 38Gly-coding allele as a
consequence of null mutations in the regulatory region of
the 38Ser-coding allele, ii) allelic dropout of the 38Sercoding allele, iii) monoallelic expression of the 38Glycoding allele due to silencing of the 38Ser-coding allele by

genomic imprinting, and iv) genomic recoding of 38Sercoding transcripts to 38Gly-coding alleles by A to I editing. We consider it very unlikely that the observed pattern
results from deleterious mutations in the regulatory
region since null mutations should affect not only the
38Ser-coding allele. Allelic dropout can further be ruled
out as the 38Ser allele did not drop out when analysing
the other 21 heterozygote samples. One possible explanation for the deviating allele frequencies in the three
genomically heterozygous individuals is genomic
imprinting, even though KCNE1 does not belong to the
known imprinted genes, neither in humans nor in mouse
[25,26]. Alternatively, genomic recoding at the mRNA
level might account for the observed pattern. According to
this, an ADAR sporadically recodes the adenosine at
KCNE1 codon 38 (AGU) to inosine (IGU), which is
equivalent to guanosine (GGU) for the translational
machinery [17]. This assumption is additionally corroborated by a hint for A to I editing at KCNE1 codon 38 in
GenBank entry BC046224 ("G in cDNA is A in the human
genome" [27]). If one further considers evidence for
genomic recoding of the human potassium voltage-gated
channel, shaker-related subfamily, member 1 (KCNA1)
[28] as well as of ion channels in diverse non-primate taxa
such as rodents [29,30], insects [31,32], and molluscs
[33,34], genomic recoding might indeed be the reason for
the observed specific allele frequencies in three humane
heterozygotes. Future investigations will finally clarify
whether genomic imprinting or genomic recoding are
causative for the sporadic occurence of deviating allele frequencies in the gDNA/cDNA comparison in humans. Irrespectively, the present data provide first time evidence for
the coincidence of positive selection at a polymorph
codon site and the sporadic absence of one allele in the
mRNA of heterozygotes.
Functional considerations in the light of KCNE1 variance
and divergence
The finding that the Gly38Ser polymorphism is a humanspecific feature that emerged under positive selection
poses the question for its adaptive value (see Figure 1).
Given the relevance of IKs channels for inner ear homeostasis and the function of muscles and neurons it is tempting to speculate that the evolution of the Gly38Ser
polymorphism is connected to the physiological chal-

Figure proteins from chimpanzee and human arehighly N-glycosylated
KCNE1 2
KCNE1 proteins from chimpanzee and human are highly N-glycosylated. A HEK293 cells were transfected with 1
μg (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or 3 μg (lanes 2, 4, and 6) expression plasmids for the indicated KCNE1 variants. Nascent (n) proteins

lenges of specific human features such as speech perception, upright and enduring walking, and advanced
cognitive capabilities. Regardless of these speculations,
the evolution of the human-specific Gly38Ser polymorphism probably conferred some functional advantage at

the cellular level. This conclusion agrees well with the
results of a recent study showing an involvement of the
Gly38Ser polymorphism in the fine-tuning of IKs channels [35]. As we found no evidence for changes in glycosylation between the chimpanzee protein and the two
Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:188

human KCNE1 variants (see Figure 2), the functional relevance of the Gly38Ser polymorphism most probably
results from the moderately radical character of the amino
acid exchanges involved (Asp > Gly, Gly > Ser). While
amino acid position 38 belongs to the extracellular N-terminus of human KCNE1, the two other amino acid sites
pinpointed herein as positively selected (105 and 115)
belong to the intracellular C-terminus [1]. As such they
might be involved in the interaction with KCNQ1,
namely in the regulation of channel assembly, open-state
destabilization, and kinetics of channel deactivation [36].
According to the population genetic data a subtle heterozygote advantage accounts for the maintenance of the
Gly38Ser polymorphism in humans. However, the extent
of such an heterozygote advantage might depend on the
environment, since we found a significant heterozygote
excess solely in Yoruba from Nigeria, but nearly no differences between the observed and expected genotype
counts in Japanese from Tokyo (see Table 3). The depletion of 38Ser homozygotes in the Yoruban sample and
particularly the sporadic absence of 38Ser-coding mRNAs
in Central Europeans further suggest that the expression
of the 38Ser allele is disadvantageous under certain conditions. 38Ser to 38Gly recoding or monoallelic expression
of the 38Gly allele might then represent mechanisms to
be functionally homozygote 38Gly when required by specific physiological conditions. Beyond this, there might be
individual differences in the capability of genomic recoding or genomic imprinting. Such a scenario could explain
why we found a depletion of 38Ser-coding alleles only in
two out of 19 heterozygous cell lines and one out of five
heterozygous brain samples.

Conclusion
It is well established that aberrant editing patterns can
lead to diseases such as epilepsy [30], depression [37],
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [38] and malignant gliomas
[39]. Likewise, genomic imprinting is assumed to play a
role in the susceptibility to diverse diseases [40,41]. In
extension of this, individual differences in the capability
of suppressing the expression of the 38Ser variant might
predispose 38Ser carriers more or less to LQTS. For
instance, sex-specific differences in the depletion of 38Sercoding mRNAs could explain why the Gly38Ser polymorphism correlates significantly with QT length in men from
North Israel, but not in women [11]. Furthermore, sporadic 38Ser deficiency might have obscured the recognition of an associations between Gly38Ser and LQTS in
diverse Central European cohorts (see [9,14-16]). However, these are speculations since it remains an open question whether the present conclusions drawn from
lymphoblastoid cell lines and brain samples can be transferred to heart tissue. Provided that future investigations
will confirm a sporadic depletion of 38Ser- coding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/188

mRNAs in heart of Gly38Ser heterozygotes and 38Ser
homozygotes, this would underline the relevance of
mRNA data in future association studies between
Gly38Ser variant and LQTS. For apparent reasons heart
tissue can only be collected post mortem. Another important question would thus be if peripheral blood lymphocytes reflect the recoding or imprinting pattern in
heart tissue. Only under such circumstances peripheral
blood lymphocytes could be taken as a predictor for the
situation in heart. Irrespective of these considerations, the
present evolutionary approach reveals an unusual, if not
unique, pattern at the codon level, i.e. coincidence of positive Darwinian selection and polymorphism with a sporadically suppressed expression of one allele. This further
corroborates the previously demonstrated functional relevance of the Gly38Ser polymorphism of KCNE1 [35].

Methods
Human sample
The present sample comprised lymphoblastoid cell lines
of 29 individuals and brain samples (frontal cortex) of
another 14 individuals. All individuals were Central Europeans. Anonymized brain samples were collected during
pathomorphological diagnostics and immediately shockfrozen in liquid nitrogene. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were
generated by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of peripheral blood leucocytes propagated according to standard
procedures [42]. We extracted gDNAs using standard procedures. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized from total RNAs
with random primers and SuperScript III (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. Use of the brain samples
was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and
approved by the local ethics committee [Aerztekammer
Rheinland-Pfalz, Decisions 837.103.04 (4261) and
837.073.07 (5608)].
Direct sequencing of human samples
For direct sequencing of gDNAs, PCR was carried out
using FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche) and normal
hot start PCR. The primers used bound to exon 3, in particular -18 and +26 bp upstream and downstream of start
and stop codon, respectively (forward primer: 5'-TGCCTGGGAAGTTTGAGCTG-3'; reverse primer: 5'-CAGGTTGCCAGGCAGGATG-3'). PCR conditions were as follows:
2 min, 94°C; 35× (40 s at 94°C, 40 s at 65°C, 40 s at
72°C); 5 min, 72°C. Following exonuclease I and shrimp
alkaline phosphatase digestion, dye terminator cycle
sequencing of the PCR products was performed using the
PCR primers and the CEQ DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman
Coulter). Sequencing products were separated on a Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System. SCFfiles were analyzed by visual inspection using BioEdit
[43].

Quantitative Allele-Specific Expression Analysis of human
samples
To more accurately measure the A versus G allele ratios of
the A112G (Gly38Ser) variant in gDNAs and cDNAs,
Quantification of Allele-Specific Expression by Pyrosequencing (QUASEP) was used [44]. QUASEP allows to
accurately quantify the relative amount of one allele to the
other, if their sequences differ in at least one base pair. The
primer sequences for QUASEP were designed using the
Pyrosequencing Assay Design Software (Biotage AB).

PCR products for QUASEP-analyses of the KCNE1-A/GSNP rs1805127 were generated from gDNAs and cDNAs
of lymphoblastoid cell lines and brain samples using FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche) and normal hot start
PCR with the forward primer 5'-AGAGGGCCTCCAGCTTGC-3' and 5' biotinylated reverse primer 5'GCAGGGTGGCAACATGTC-3' according to standard protocols. Pyrosequencing was performed on a PSQ™96MA
Pyrosequencing System (Biotage) with the PyroGold SQA
reagent kit (Biotage) using the forward sequencing primer
5'-CCAGCTTGCCGTCAC-3'. The PSQ™96MA 2.1.1 software (Biotage) was used for data analysis.
In order to assess whether RNA extraction or specific conditions of some of the samples affect the results of
QUASEP-analyses of the KCNE1-SNP rs1805127 we performed analogue QUASEP-analyses of the highly heterozygous A/G-SNP rs11254413 of the housekeeping gene
TRDMT1. Hot start PCR was carried out using the forward
primer 5'-TGGCTATCCTCTACAAAATGACAA-3' and 5'
biotinylated reverse primer 5'-CGGCAGGGTGATATGACTGAT-3'. For pyrosequencing we took the forward
sequencing primer 5'-CCTTGGGAGAATATCTAGAA-3'.
QUASEP of TRDMT1-SNP rs11254413 was confined to
gDNAs and cDNAs of lymphoblastoid cell lines.
Interspecies comparison
To assess the evolution of KCNE1 across Eutheria, we
complemented the human KCNE1 data with gDNA and
cDNA data from non-human species (Mammalia, Eutheria), using NCBI and ENSEMBL databases. New sequences
were generated from four non-human primates, i.e Bornean orangutan, siamang, crab-eating macaque, and silvered leaf monkey. Total RNA was extracted from testis
(crab-eating macaque) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (all
others) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were
synthesized from total RNA with SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen), using the reverse gene-specific
primer 5'-TCAGGTTGCCAGGCAGGAT-3'. The target
cDNA encompassing the entire KCNE1-coding sequence
was amplified with the forward gene-specific primer 5'AGCCAAGGATATTCAGAGGT-3' and the reverse genespecific primer mentioned above by standard PCR under
the following conditions: 3 min at 94°C, 30 × (30 s at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/188

94°C, 30 s at 58°C, 40 s at 72°C), 5 min at 72°C. Direct
sequencing was carried out as described for the human
samples. In a final step, we completed the dataset with
GenBank entries from another 14 eutherian representatives, thus generating a dataset comprising orthologs of
human and 18 non-human species (see bold accession
numbers in Table 4). The sequences were translated, ClustalW aligned, and re-translated using BioEdit [43]. The
non-human sequences were moreover scrutinized for polymorphisms of the codon site ortholog to human KCNE1
38, using ENSEMBL data. We finally checked the respective codon site of non-human KCNE1 sequences for hints
of genomic recoding at the mRNA level. Therefore, we
compared gDNAs retrieved from ENSEMBL and NCBI
with the actual set of cDNAs deposited in the Nucleotide
collection and EST databases at NCBI (see Table 4).
Statistical analyses
Population genetic analyses were carried out using allele
frequencies and genotype counts of the geographically
distinct human samples covered by HapMap phase II
(120 Central Europeans, 90 Han Chinese from Beijing, 88
Japanese from Tokyo, 120 Yoruba from Ibadan/Nigeria).
Expected genotype counts were calculated using Fstat
2.9.3 [45]. We engaged the same software to infer the fixation index, Fis. Fis is a measure of the heterozygote deficit
within subpopulations. Consequently, positive Fis-values
point to a heterozygote deficit, while negative Fis-values
indicate a heterozygote excess. Fstat has moreover been
used to test for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (400 randomisations). We corrected for multiple
testing by strict Bonferroni adjustment, thus lowering the
5% level of significance to 0.0125.

The evolutionary history of the codon position corresponding to codon 38 in human KCNE1 was traced back
using ancestral sequences reconstructed by baseml (PAML
3.15 [46]). The dataset comprised the non-human KCNE1
orthologs plus the two human alleles. The intree used is
shown in Figure 1 and represents the commonly accepted
phylogeny among mammals [47,48] and primates [49].
We furthermore assessed the evolutionary regime acting
on KCNE1 as a whole using the ratio of non-synonymous
(amino acid altering) to synonymous (silent) nucleotide
substitution rates (= dn/ds = ω). Rate ratios > 1 are commonly accepted as a conservative measure of positive
selection (= adaptive evolution) while rate ratios = 1 and
< 1 are indicative of neutral evolution and negative selection, respectively. To study the evolution of KCNE1 across
the human branches (foreground, see Figure 1) in comparison to the remaining phylogeny, we employed the
modified version of branch-site model A [50] of codeml
(PAML 4 [46]). Model A assumes four site classes: site
class 0 integrates codon sites that are conserved through-

out the entire phylogeny (foreground plus remaining phylogeny) with 0 < ω0 < 1. Site class 1 comprises codon
positions that evolve neutrally throughout the entire phylogeny with ω1 = 1. Site classes 2a and 2b include codon
sites that undergo positive selection on the foreground,
but are under negative selection or neutral evolution
across the remaining phylogeny. The model involves four
free parameters: the proportion (p0) and the ω estimate
(ω0) of site class 0; the proportion estimate of site class 1
(p1) and the ω estimate of the codon sites that evolve
under positive selection across the foreground (ω2). The
codon frequency was estimated from a 3 × 4 contingency
table. Ambiguity data were not removed from the data
(cleandata = 0). The Bayes empirical Bayes approach was
used to identify codon sites under positive selection along
the (human) foreground branches [51]. To test for the significance of the results, the branch-site test of positive
selection (test 2 in [50]) was carried out. Therefore, we
compared twice the log likelihood difference between
model A with ω2 > 1, estimated from the data, and model
A with ω2 = 1 fixed with the critical values from chi-square
distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
Motif search
Motif search was carried out using the PROSITE database
as implemented in the PredictProtein server [52].
Expression of KCNE1 in HEK293 cells and Western
blotting
HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were grown at 37°C
under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 2.5 *
105 cells were transfected in six well plates (Greiner) with
1 μg or 3 μg of expression plasmids pcDNA3.1chimpanzee_KCNE1_GAT, pcDNA3.1-human_KCNE1_
AGT or pcDNA3.1-human_KCNE1_GGT by calcium
phosphate coprecipitation. To assess the extent of N-glycosylation, tunicamycin (Sigma) was added to the medium
to a concentration of 5 μg/ml 10 hours after transfection.
For Western blotting, whole cell lysates were prepared 24
hours after transfection. Cells were washed three times in
phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation
at 300 g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of icecold NP-40 (Fluka) lysis buffer consisting of 137 mM KCl,
20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM NaF, 10
μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated on ice for 40 min. The lysate was cleared by
centrifugation at 80,000 g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (BioRad). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for 20 min at 150 mA, using a Trisglycine buffer system. After blocking, membranes were
incubated with the primary antibody directed against

KCNE1 (Calbiochem). As secondary antibody, a 1:5,000
dilution of peroxidase-conjugated donkey, anti-rabbit

corresponds to residues 67 to 129 of human KCNE1 fused
to glutathione S-transferase (Calbiochem).
