Abstract
Background: Aminopeptidase B (Ap-B; EC 3.4.11.6) catalyzes the cleavage of basic residues at the N-terminus
of peptides and processes glucagon into miniglucagon. The enzyme exhibits, in vitro, a residual ability to hydrolyze
leukotriene A4 into the pro-inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B4. The potential bi-functional nature of ApB is supported by close structural relationships with LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H ; EC 3.3.2.6). A structure-function
analysis is necessary for the detailed understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms of Ap-B and to design inhibitors,
which could be used to determine the complete in vivo functions of the enzyme.
Results: The rat Ap-B cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the purified recombinant enzyme was characterized.
18 mutants of the H325EXXHX18E348 Zn2+-binding motif were constructed and expressed. All mutations were
found to abolish the aminopeptidase activity. A multiple alignment of 500 sequences of the M1 family of
aminopeptidases was performed to identify 3 sub-families of exopeptidases and to build a structural model of ApB using the x-ray structure of LTA4H as a template. Although the 3D structures of the two enzymes resemble
each other, they differ in certain details. The role that a loop, delimiting the active center of Ap-B, plays in
discriminating basic substrates, as well as the function of consensus motifs, such as RNP1 and Armadillo domain
are discussed. Examination of electrostatic potentials and hydrophobic patches revealed important differences
between Ap-B and LTA4H and suggests that Ap-B is involved in protein-protein interactions.
Conclusion: Alignment of the primary structures of the M1 family members clearly demonstrates the existence
of different sub-families and highlights crucial residues in the enzymatic activity of the whole family. E. coli
recombinant enzyme and Ap-B structural model constitute powerful tools for investigating the importance and
possible roles of these conserved residues in Ap-B, LTA4H and M1 aminopeptidase catalytic sites and to gain new
insight into their physiological functions. Analysis of Ap-B structural model indicates that several interactions
between Ap-B and proteins can occur and suggests that endopeptidases might form a complex with Ap-B during
hormone processing.

Background
Aminopeptidase B (Ap-B; EC 3.4.11.6) activity was originally defined as an exopeptidase able to remove basic
amino acid residues from the NH2-terminus of peptide
substrates [1]. Such activity led to the hypothesis that the
enzyme participates in the final steps of precursor processing, namely of neuropeptide and hormone precursors [24]. In most cases, proteolytic activation of peptide precursors occurs at arginine and lysine residues and involves
the sequential action of an endoprotease and an exopeptidase [3]. Research efforts had focused primarily on
endopeptidases cleaving at the COOH-terminus of basic
amino acid doublets and on the subsequent participation
of a carboxypeptidase E or H (EC 3.4.17.10; reviewed in
[5,6]).
However, several endoproteases have been shown to produce cleavage of basic amino acid doublets on their NH2terminal side [7-10]. Moreover, NH2-terminally extended
form of various peptides, bearing an extra Arg or Lys residue resulting from proteolytic processing of their corresponding precursors, have been described [11-14]. Several
recent studies have demonstrated that Ap-B activity occurs
in combination with different proteases, such as NRD
convertase [15], Cathepsin L [16] and aminopeptidase A
[17]. Although clarification of the physiological relevance
of Ap-B and identification of all of its in vivo substrates is
not complete, some of these substrates were recently identified. Indeed, Ap-B processes glucagon into miniglucagon
in the α-cells of the islets of Langerhans [15] and could
also process angiotensin peptides in rat cardiac fibroblastic cells [17] and enkephalins in various tissues [16]. The
enzymatic properties of Ap-B and its expression pattern
[4,18-22] lead to the hypothesis that this enzyme could be
involved in inflammatory processes [23], development of
tumours [24] and Type II diabetes [15].
The biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme
isolated from rat testis yielded important information.
Ap-B is a monomeric 72 kDa Zn2+-dependent exopeptidase, which selectively removes Arg or Lys residues from
the NH2-terminus of several peptide substrates [4]. In
addition to its exopeptidase activity, Ap-B exhibits a residual capacity to hydrolyze leukotriene A4 (LTA4) into the
pro-inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4), in
vitro [18]. The bi-functional nature of Ap-B is supported
by a close phylogenetic relationship with LTA4 hydrolase
(LTA4H; EC 3.3.2.6; [18]), which hydrolyzes LTA4 into
LTB4, in vivo, and exhibits an aminopeptidase activity, in
vitro [25]. Both enzymes belong to the M1 family of metallopeptidases (consensus Zn2+-binding site HEXXHX18E;
[18,21,25,26]).
The high-resolution crystal structure of LTA4H in complex
with inhibitors (i.e. bestatin) was recently described

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

[27,28]. This was the first 3D structure determined in the
M1 family of metalloexopeptidases to which Ap-B also
belongs. Various attempts to crystallize Ap-B have failed
due to the low solubility of the enzyme. However, the
phylogenetic relationship between LTA4H and Ap-B
offered the opportunity to model the Ap-B structure using
LTA4H as a template in order to acquire structural data
which will be essential to understand the enzymatic
mechanisms, the structure of potential physiological substrates and to design potent inhibitors of Ap-B.
In this paper, we describe the production and purification
of the rat Ap-B (rAp-B) in E. coli, the characterization of
the recombinant protein and its catalytic properties.
Eighteen different mutants were generated by site-directed
mutagenesis to confirm the functional roles of conserved
amino acids belonging to the M1 consensus motif
[H325EXXHX18E348], which constitutes the Zn2+-binding
site. As a step toward the determination of the Ap-B catalytic mechanisms and the structural requirements for the
control of substrates specificity, a complete alignment of
500 sequences of the M1 family was performed to point
out conserved residues and evolutionary divergences. A
part of this alignment was used for the construction of a
3D model of the whole 650 amino acid-long rAp-B based
on the crystal structure of human LTA4H [27] in complex
with Zinc ion and bestatin.
The structural relevance of some previously in silico
detected consensus sites, such as RNP1 binding motif and
Armadillo domain involved in protein-protein interactions is also discussed. Lastly, structural surface differences
between Ap-B and LTA4H were examined and the results
lead to the hypothesis that Ap-B exhibits numerous protein-protein interaction properties according to its putative physiological functions.

Results
Expression and purification of the E. coli recombinant rat
Ap-B protein
A 1965 bp-long DNA fragment containing the rat Ap-B
CDS was cloned into the pIVEX2.4 expression vector (Fig.
1-A). Then, the recombinant rat Ap-B protein (rAp-B) was
produced with this T7 promoter-driven plasmid in a BLi5
E. coli strain. The translated product comprises a histidine
tag (His-tag) at the NH2-terminus followed by a factor Xa
restriction protease cleavage site and the rAp-B sequence,
providing a 673 amino acid protein (His-rAp-B; Fig. 1-A, B). The difference in length due to the fused His-tag/Factor Xa site tail (673 versus 650 amino acid residues) leads
to a slight difference of electrophoretic mobility, which is
observed in Western blot analysis (Fig. 1-B). This latter
also shows that His-rAp-B is properly expressed in this
prokaryotic expression system.

Cloning of
Cloning of rat Ap-B coding region, expression and purification of the E. coli recombinant rat Ap-B protein. (A)
Schematic representation of the pIVEX2.4-Ap-B vector. A 1965 bp-long DNA fragment (Aminopeptidase B) containing the rat
Ap-B CDS [18] was cloned into the pIVEX2.4 expression vector. T7 promotor, Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), translation initiation codon (ATG), Histidine tag (His Tag), Factor Xa restriction protease cleavage site (Xa or Factor Xa), NcoI and BamHI
restriction sites, stop codon (***), and transcription T7 terminator (T7 Terminator) are indicated. (B) Western blot analysis
of the expression of the recombinant rAp-B in E. coli. Lane 1 contains a purified recombinant rAp-B produced in a baculovirus
expression system ([29]). Lane 2 contains a crude protein extract from pIVEX2.4-Ap-B transformed cells. Each sample (2 µL)
was diluted in 20 µL of 1× Laemli buffer to avoid buffer effects during electrophoresis. Arrows indicate immunoreactive proteins corresponding to the baculovirus produced rAp-B (rAp-B; 650 amino acid residues; [29]) and the E. coli expressed rAp-B
(His-rAp-B; 673 amino acid residues), respectively. (C) Purification using Ni-NTA column. The different protein extracts analyzed are the following: C, rAp-B purified from baculovirus expression system used as a positive control; CE, crude protein
extract from pIVEX2.4-Ap-B transformed BLi5 cells (5 µL); FT, proteins released after passage through the Ni-NTA column
(20 µL); W1 and W2, proteins released after the first and second washing of the Ni-NTA column, respectively (20 µL); E1 and
E2, proteins collected after the first and second elution step, respectively (20 µL). (D) Purification of recombinant rat Ap-B
using DEAE ion exchange column. Different fractions (43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53) collected from the ion exchange column and containing rAp-B activity were analysed (20 µL per fraction). (C, D) Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and either stained with silver
salts (upper panel) or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for western blotting (lower panel). Arrows indicate the E. coli
expressed rAp-B (rAp-B). (B, C, D) Relative molecular masses are indicated in kilo Daltons (MM, kDa).

Cloning of rAp-B as a NH2-polyhistidine-tailed protein
allows a rapid purification procedure. Figure 1-C shows
that there is a significant loss of desired His-rAp-B during
the first washing. Any attempts to increase the binding
specificity of the histidine tag during this step led to a
decrease of specificity during the elution steps. Gel electrophoresis of the elution fractions E1 and E2 (1.5 mL
each) showed only one band with a relative molecular
mass around 73 kDa (Fig. 1-C). Both fractions were
pooled and concentrated to 1 mL in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH
7.2. The final concentration of the purified His-tag rAp-B

was about 160 µg.mL-1. Consequently, an adequate quantity of enzyme is obtained with this purification procedure
since we obtained 160 µg of purified protein from 50 mL
of cell culture corresponding to a purification rate of 3.2
mg.L-1.
In order to identify potential differences in the kinetic
parameters of the enzyme activity due to the purification
procedures, the His-tagged rAp-B was also semi-purified
using a DEAE Trisacryl Plus M ion exchange column
eluted with 80 mM KCl (Fig. 1-D). Gel electrophoresis of

the elution fractions containing Ap-B activity (5 mL each)
showed several bands with a relative molecular mass
between 35 to 115 kDa (Fig. 1-D). Fractions 43 to 47,
which contain 4 main detectable bands on the silver
stained SDS-PAGE were pooled (25 mL; Fig. 1-D) and
concentrated to 5 mL in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.2. The final
concentration of the semi-purified proteins was ~40
µg.mL-1 versus 80 µg.mL-1 for fractions 48 to 53. Within the
limits of a visual quantification, this analysis shows that
the amounts of His-tagged rAp-B corresponds to about
30% of the total proteins leading to an estimated purification rate of about 1 mg.L-1. Note that subsequent exclusion chromatography steps do not allow the separation of
the contaminant proteins despite their molecular mass
differences (data not shown).
A Western blot analysis completes the identification of the
proteins resulting from these purification procedures (Fig.
1-C, -D, lower panels) and shows that no degradation
products were generated.
Characterization of the purified His-tagged rat Ap-B
activity
Kinetic constants for the enzymatic reaction of His-rAp-B
with L-Arg and L-Lys β-NA were estimated from
Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/v against 1/[S] and HanesWoolf plots of [S]/v against [S] in the substrate concentration range 1–35 µM (Table 1).

The enzymatic activity of His-rAp-B is probably higher
than estimated above. Indeed, a decrease of activity due to
the higher purification of the enzyme was previously
described [4,29]. Meanwhile, this purification step is
required to calculate the kinetic constant such as kcat and
consequently kcat/Km. Equivalent measurements using
the DEAE semi-purified His-rAp-B show that enzyme
activity is similar to that of Ni-NTA (Table 1). Consequently, the semi-purified enzyme can also be used in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

activity assays. The comparison of kinetic values between
baculovirus recombinant Ap-B [29], rat testes enzyme [4]
and E. coli recombinant protein shows that this latter constitutes a reliable tool to study the enzymatic mechanism
of Ap-B, avoiding long procedures of purification (Table
1).
Addition of 0.2 M NaCl with either the purified rat testis
Ap-B protein or the recombinant enzyme expressed in
baculovirus system, results in a 3-time increase in activity
[4,29]. Consequently, the effect of NaCl was studied by
assaying bacterial recombinant His-rAp-B activity in the
presence of different concentrations of NaCl ranging from
0 to 2 M in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 7.4 (Fig. 2). A similar
increase of activity (about 3 fold) is observed in the range
75–400 mM NaCl with a maximum increase at 200 mM,
followed by a strong inhibition.
The inhibitor profile of His-rAp-B was studied using the LArg-β-NA as substrate. As shown in Table 2, the recombinant enzyme shows metallopeptidase properties with
an inhibition of its activity with EDTA and O-phenanthroline in the milli- and micromolar concentrations, respectively. The rAp-B activity is not affected by PMSF, a serine
protease inhibitor. As expected, aminopeptidase inhibitors such as bestatine (Ki = 50 nM versus 100 nM for Ap-B
purified from insect cells) or arphamenine A and B (Ki =
20 nM versus 40 nM for Ap-B purified from insect cells)
work in micromolar concentrations. Therefore, the
recombinant enzyme exhibits the similar enzymatic properties to the testis protein.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the HEXXHX18E rAp-B motif
In order to probe the functional roles of several amino
acids previously identified in other members of the M1
family (For review, see in [30]), an investigation of the
conserved HEXXHX18E motif was conducted by sitedirected mutagenesis (Table 3). Mutants were expressed in

Multiple sequence alignment
In order to establish the basis for molecular modelling
and further site-directed mutagenesis studies, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of proteins
belonging to the M1 family of aminopeptidases. A
BLASTP search of the Uniprot database using rat Ap-B
sequence retrieved 512 protein sequences and 500 of
them were initially selected to perform a CLUSTALW
alignment. Redundancy inside the selected sequences was
conserved to identify partial sequences (NH2- and/or
COOH-terminal truncations; internal deletions),
sequence insertions and sequencing errors. These latter
sequences were deleted from the multiple alignment.
Consequently, 403 proteins varying in length from 407
(Q6L8I5, Kitasatospora setae) to 1890 (Q22531,
Caenorhabditis elegans) amino acid residues were aligned.

Figure NaCl concentration on His-rAp-B enzymatic activity

Effect of NaCl concentration on His-rAp-B enzymatic activity. Activity was measured using the standard

indicated NaCl concentrations. Activities are expressed relative to the maximum activity (100%) of the His-rAp-B
enzyme obtained in presence of 200 mM NaCl. Bars represent SEM of 3 or more separate assays.

BLi5 E. coli strain. The corresponding proteins were then
purified or semi-purified either by Ni-NTA agarose chromatography or DEAE ion exchange column, respectively
and showed a single band on SDS-PAGE and Western
blot, similar to wild type enzyme (data not shown). Conservative mutants such as H325H, E326E, H329H and
E348E constituted positive controls.
Mutagenesis of any of the three zinc binding ligands of the
HEXXHX18E conserved motif (H325, H329, E348 in rat Ap-B
sequence or of the critical general base of the peptidase
reaction E326 led to complete loss of aminopeptidase
activity (Table 3). As shown by E326Q/D and E348Q/D
mutants, the negative charge and the length of the side
chain seem to be important for the glutamate residue
functions. On the other hand, results obtained with the
H325Y/F and H329Y/F mutants suggest that nitrogen
atoms of histidine play a role in chelating the Zn2+ cation.

Examination of the longest sequences (Q7PYD3, 1800
amino acids, Anopheles gambiae; Q61J79, 1875 amino
acids, Caenorhabditis briggsae; Q22531, 1890 amino acids,
Caenorhabditis elegans) showed that these proteins are
translated from a duplicated gene encoding in tandem
two similar aminopeptidases of the M1 family. The
COOH-terminal domains encompassing the second aminopeptidase module of these 3 proteins were deleted from
the alignment. Subsequent alignments of these domains
with the consensus signature exhibited identical conserved amino acid residues (data not shown).
On the other hand, analysis of the shortest sequences
revealed interesting data. Indeed, these proteins display
only one of both consensus motifs of the M1 family, the
Zn2+-binding site HEXXHX18E. The second consensus
motif GXMEN that is classically located about 22 to 38
amino acids upstream the Zn2+-binding motif is missing.
The glutamate alone seems to be conserved (Fig. 3).
These proteins are encoded by the genomes of Actinobacteria (Streptomyces avermitilis: Q82MI5, 497 amino acids;
Q82JJ1, 463 amino acids; Q82P16, 454 amino acids;
Q82GE5, 469 amino acids; Q82KD2, 489 amino acids;

Streptomyces coelicolor: Q9X7P2, 506 amino acids;
Q9KXW8, 473 amino acids; O69971, 512 amino acids;

acids; Q5Z2X1, 461 amino acids; Kitasatospora setae:
Q6L8I5, 407 amino acids; Deinococcus radiodurans:
Q9RVZ5, 472 amino acids). These 18 closely related
enzymes clearly constitute a sub-group in the M1 aminopeptidase family (Fig. 3).

The percentage of inhibition was calculated by taking as reference the amount of substrate conversion by His-rAp-B in absence of inhibitor (see
Materials and Methods section). Values are the average of three independent series of tests in which each point was performed in triplicate. (* from
[4])

The recent publication of the sequence of human aminopeptidase O (Ap-O; [31]), an aminopeptidase related
to Ap-B and LTA4H, led us to compare this sequence to
that of other members of the M1 family. Note that the
Uniprot database only contains the human Ap-O
sequence (Q5T9B3, Q8WUL6, Q96M23). Although Ap-O
is most closely related to Ap-B, the global identity between
both enzymes is very low (23.5%; LTA4H versus Ap-O,
about 20 %). Due to a large discrepancy in length (Ap-B,
650 amino acids; Ap-O, 819 amino acids) and weak percentages of identity and similarity (32.8%), the evolutionary relationships between these two proteins remains
unclear. In addition, analysis of the M1 consensus signature [GXMENX22–38HEXXHX18E] shows that the GXMEN
motif is lacking, except the Met residue in the Ap-O
human sequence (Fig. 3). This observation was confirmed
by analysis of different sequences extracted from the nr
database (Genbank CDS translations + RefSeq Proteins +
PDB + Swissprot + PIR + PRF) such as AMPO_RAT (Rattus
norvegicus),
AMPO_MOUSE
(Mus
musculus),
XP_425041.1 (Gallus gallus), XP_541256.1 (Canis familiaris) and CAG10896.1 (Tetraodon nigroviridis) (data not

shown). In the M1 family, Ap-O constitutes the unique
member of a second emerging sub-group (Fig. 3).
The 382 remaining sequences, including Ap-B and LTA4H
proteins, exhibit both consensus motifs of the M1 family
and thus constitute a third sub-group in the latter. The
multiple alignment of these 382 sequences, varying in
length from 611 (leukotriene A4 hydrolases) to 1025
(Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone degrading enzymes)
amino acids, permitted the identification of a prominent
conserved region of approximately 460 residues (including gaps) containing the GXMEN motif and the Zn2+binding site (HEXXHX18E; Fig. 4). This region overlaps
only 316 amino acids residues in the Ap-B sequences
(from Thr168 to Pro389; Fig. 4). This alignment reveals 61
highly conserved positions. Their conservation among
several divergent prokaryote and eukaryote peptidases
points their potential importance in maintaining the
structural integrity of the proteins or in directly interacting
with the substrates.

The number of mutants analysed, the mutated codon and its corresponding amino acid, as well as the percentages of enzyme activity are indicated.
The position in the rat Ap-B sequence of the targeted amino acid is numbered. The percentage of activity was determined using L-Arg β-NA as
substrate. Activity assays were performed in triplicate with enzymes collected from both purification methods.

A subsequent search of the Uniprot database with the
PATTERN program for consensus amino acid signatures
using conserved residues highlighted in the multiple
alignment revealed that the HEXXHX3G [DENQ]X6WX6E
motif was specific to the M1 family (469 proteins
detected). The EX15–45HEXXHX3G [DENQ]X6WX6E signature detected specifically all the M1 proteins minus the ApO sequences. The conception of different signatures using
other conserved amino acids such as in region 168–210 or
409–441 failed.
Molecular modelling of Ap-B
Sequence alignments indicated that rat Ap-B shares 33%
identity and 48% similarity with LTA4H. LTA4H and Ap-B
(611 and 650 amino acids respectively) exhibit similar
sizes. Consequently, the crystal structure of LTA4H constituted a suitable template to model the Ap-B 3D structure
(see Additional File 1). The overall structure can be
described as follows: Ap-B protein is folded into three different NH2-terminal (residues 1–235), catalytic (residues
236–484) and COOH-terminal (residues 485–650)
domains packed in a triangular arrangement with dimensions of about 78 × 55 × 51 Å versus about 85 × 65 × 50 Å
for LTA4H. The catalytic centre is located along a deep
cleft, created between the three domains. The NH2-terminal domain is composed of a large seven-stranded mixed
β-sheet surrounded by two smaller β-sheets. This NH2-ter-

minal domain seems to shape an envelope, such as in
LTA4H, presenting a large concave surface to the solvent.
The structures of the Ap-B and LTA4H catalytic domains
are very similar. This domain consists of two lobes, one
mainly α-helical and one mixed α/β (Fig. 5-A). The Zn2+binding site (H325EXXHX18E348) in Ap-B model remains
between the two lobes, such as LTA4H [27].
The Ap-B Zn2+ ion is coordinated by His325, His329 and
Glu348 residues of the H325EXXHX18E348 motif (Fig 5-D).
The distances between the Zn2+ ion and His325, His328 and
Glu348 are 2.14 Å, 2.1 Å and 1.98 Å, respectively. A more
precise definition of the structure of the catalytic domain
could be done thanks to the contribution of sequences
alignments. Indeed, multiple alignments highlight a 316
conserved amino acids region that lead to the hypothesis
of a functional role in the exopeptidase activity of this
entire region. In this case, the catalytic domain of LTA4H
and Ap-B proteins extend into the NH2-terminus structural domain previously described ([27]; residues 168–
489 for Ap-B) adopting a horseshoe shape (Fig. 5-B). As
expected, due to the high percentage of similarity between
both proteins in this region, the hydrophobic cavity constituting the putative substrate-binding pocket is conserved (data not shown).

sequences. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW using the Blosum62 matrix. Multiple alignment of the central Zn2+ chelating region of Ap-O from Rattus norvegicus (RnAp-O; AMPO_RAT), Mus musculus (MmAp-O; AMPO_MOUSE), Homo sapiens
(HsAp-O; Q5T9B3), Gallus gallus (GgAp-O; XP_425041.1) and aminopeptidases from Actinobacteria [Streptomyces avermitilis
(Q82MI5, Q82JJ1, Q82P16, Q82GE5, Q82KD2, Q93H20, Q82FV0); Streptomyces coelicolor (Q9X7P2, Q9KXW8, O69971);

The corresponding part of the Rattus norvegicus Ap-B sequence (RnAp-B; AMPB_RAT) is indicated, as well as the conserved amino acid residues between Ap-B and ApO (above RnAp-B sequence) and between Actinobacteria aminopeptidase sequences (below RnAp-B sequence). Conserved
amino acid residues between Ap-O proteins or between Actinobacteria proteins are shown above (Ap-O line) and below
(Actino line) the multiple alignment, respectively. In the consensus lines, amino acids invariant in all sequences are indicated by
stars (H) and colons (:) indicate similar residues according to the following rule: T:A:S; I:L:V:M; K:R:H; D:E:Q:N; F:Y; G; P; W;
C. The location of the GXMEN motif is boxed and the conserved amino acid residues are highlighted in the corresponding ApO and Actinobacteria sequences. The HEXXHX18E motif is also highlighted. Dashes typify gaps.
The COOH-terminal domain is formed of α-helices
arranged into two layers (Fig. 5-A and 5B). The inner layer
contains 5 parallel α-helices. Four anti-parallel helices,
with perpendicular loops containing short helical segments on top, compose the outer layer. This coil of helices, also found in LTA4H structure, looks like Armadillo
repeats or HEAT (Hungtington-Elongation-A-subunitTOR; for review [32]) motif that are suited for proteinprotein interactions [33-35]. The super-helical domain of
the LTA4H primary structure starts from residue 463 and
from position 496 for Ap-B (Fig. 5-A, -B; Fig. 6) and it ends
with the proteins.
Structural Analysis
A detailed comparison of both structures highlights differences between Ap-B structural model and the LTA4H protein structure. The overall percentages of the different
secondary structures differ (Ap-B: α-helix, 42%; β-sheet,
14%; loops, 44% versus LTA4H: α-helix, 46%; β-sheet,
23%; loops, 31%). In a model deleted from the first 30
NH2-terminal residues that are non homologous to

LTA4H due to the difference in length between both proteins, these percentages can be estimated for Ap-B to: αhelix, 44%; β-sheet, 15%; loops, 41%. As shown in figure
6, this difference in the percentage of β-sheet is mainly
due to the presence of gaps in the alignment and to the
weak similarity between both proteins in the NH2-terminal region (residues 1–133 in Ap-B sequence). Further
refinement of the structure could probably slightly modify
the loop/β relative percentage but the main features
described below would be maintained.
The remaining part of the secondary structural alignment
exhibits a high homology (Fig 6). A very small parallel
two-stranded β-sheet of three amino acids (LTA4H,
V307TN309 and K418SI420; Ap-B, V336TN338 and Q448SI450)
and a α-helix lying just upstream this β-sheet (LTA4H,
position 291–300; Ap-B, position 320–329) are conserved between LTA4H and Ap-B model (Fig. 6). This helical structure carries the first part of the Zn2+-binding
motif(HEXXH). In both structures, a large α-helix (LTA4H,
position 315–334; Ap-B, position 344–363), which con-

takes the primary structure back to the first strand to form
the second strand and the small β-sheet. It should be
noted that the small parallel two-stranded β-sheet of three
amino acids found in Ap-B and LTA4H is also conserved
in F3 and ePepN structures (data not shown). This small
β-sheet structure might be important because it seems to
link and to maintain, without too much rigidity considering its size, two important secondary structures containing
conserved residues implicated in catalysis and Zn2+ binding.
As described in the LTA4H structure [27], a SH3 like motif
located in a loop (P-XX-P motif; position 449–462) is also
found in the Ap-B model (position 485–499; Fig. 5-C, Fig.
6). However, the Ap-B structural model also exhibits a second proline-rich loop in position 47–57 (Fig. 5-C, Fig. 6).
These motifs composed of fairly accessible residues (Fig 6)
could constitute putative protein interaction domains.
Analysis of the Ap-B primary structure revealed the presence of a highly conserved RNA binding RNP1 motif
(K416GYCFVSY423; Fig. 6; RiboNucleoProtein 1; [37]) usually encountered in eukaryotic hnRNP and snRNP. The
whole RNP motif is, in general, composed of two motifs
(RNP2, 6 amino acids; RNP1, 8 amino acids) separated by
about 30 amino acid residues.
The Ap-B RNP1 motif (K416GYCFVSY423) is found in a αhelix upstream the proline-rich loop (position 485–499).
RNP1 sequence is masked by this loop and a swinging of
this latter structure could render the putative RNA-binding site accessible to its substrate (Fig 5-C; Fig 6). The
Tyr413 residue (proton donor) also belongs to this α-helix.
No RNP2 consensus sequence is found in the Ap-B primary structure.
In order to perform a more precise comparison between
the Ap-B model and LTA4H, the electrostatic potentials of
the molecular surfaces of both proteins were computed.
Figure 7 represents electrostatic potential map displayed
on the molecular surface of LTA4H (PDB accession
number, 1HS6; left column) compared to the Ap-B model
(rAp-B; right column). Four different orientations with
their corresponding 3D ribbon structure are represented
showing the 4 different sides of both proteins. The potential scale ranges from -7 kT/e to 7 kT/e (from red to blue).
The electrostatic potential distribution between both
enzymes is significantly different. rAp-B shows a higher
negative potential (Fig 7, Orientation 1, 2 and 3), especially in the catalytic domain. Altogether, the α-helix and
the β-sheet domains of Ap-B seem to exhibit a general
negative and neutral/positive potentials, respectively.
Conversely, the α-helix and the β-sheet domains of LTA4H
exhibit a general neutral/positive and negative potentials,
respectively. Interestingly, orientation 1 in Figure 7 shows,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

in the centre of the Ap-B molecule corresponding to the
active site (substrate binding site), a negative potential
versus a neutral/positive potential for LTA4H.
Hydrophobic patches are predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions. These patches, defined as clusters of neighbouring apolar atoms deemed accessible on a
given surface, were investigated on Ap-B and LTA4H structures. The total (Ap-B, 26451 Å2; LTA4H, 23460 Å2),
hydrophobic (Ap-B, 17550 Å2; LTA4H, 13629 Å2) and
hydrophylic (Ap-B, 8893 Å2; LTA4H, 9831 Å2) accessible
surfaces of both proteins were determined using the Quilt
approach. Ap-B exhibits a slightly more hydrophobic surface (66% of the total surface) than LTA4H (58% of the
total surface). Concerning the LTA4H protein, about 120
small hydrophobic patches were detected. Their surfaces
range from 18 to 298.2 Å2 and the clusters contain atoms
from 1 to 12 residues. The five larger hydrophobic patches
of LTA4H (298.201 Å2, 11 residues; 289.193 Å2, 12 residues; 282.972 Å2, 10 residues; 280.027 Å2, 11 residues;
262.926 Å2, 7 residues) are represented on figure 6 and 8.
Some of these patches seem to be associated on the surface of the molecule and might constitute larger hydrophobic surfaces. The LTA4H larger hydrophobic patches
are mainly located in α-helical domains.
The surface of Ap-B molecule exhibits about 110 hydrophobic patches. Their surfaces range from 4.8 to 1000.070
Å2 and these clusters contain atoms from 5 to 30 residues.
The five larger hydrophobic patches of Ap-B (1000.070
Å2, 30 residues; 795.016 Å2, 31 residues; 645.299 Å2, 21
residues; 522.096 Å2, 15 residues; 519.139 Å2, 11 residues) are also represented on figure 6 and 8. Seven other
patches, larger than 300 Å2 (344.229 to 517.249 Å2, 9 to
20 residues), were also detected. As for LTA4H, several of
these patches seem to be associated (Fig. 6 and 8). The
association of patch 1 (1000.070 Å2, 30 residues, red colour in Fig. 6 and 8) and patch 5 (517.249 Å2, 11 residues,
yellow colour in Fig. 6 and 8) constitutes a hydrophobic
surface of about 1500 Å2. If one discards the first largest
patch located in an indel region and not yet refined, the
second patch is located in the β-sheet domain of the Ap-B
structure where the second proline-rich loop (position
47–57; Fig. 5-C) is also found. The three others clusters
are situated in α-helical domains.

Discussion
In this study, we first cloned rat Ap-B CDS into an E. coli
expression vector. The recombinant rAp-B was produced
with a NH2-terminal histidine tag and was characterized.
The results showed that the expressed protein exhibits the
same biochemical properties as its rat counterpart, in
terms of its immunoreactivity, kinetic parameters, substrate specificity, NaCl dependence and inhibitor sensitiv-

ity. Therefore, this recombinant enzyme was perfectly
usable for enzymatic studies.
In order to confirm the functional role of the conserved
HEXXHX18E motif previously studied in several other
enzymes of the M1 family (For review, see [30]), an investigation was conducted by site-directed mutagenesis. As
expected, mutagenesis of any of the three zinc ligands of
the H325EXXH329X18E348 motif in rAp-B sequence or of the
critical general base of the peptidase reaction E326 leads to
a complete lack of aminopeptidase activity.
In parallel, multiple alignments for the M1 family of aminopeptidases were performed to study the conservation of
the residues involved in the exopeptidase activity, these
residues constituting eventual targets for further sitedirected mutagenesis studies. Our results clearly demonstrate that 3 sub-groups or sub-families constitute the current M1 aminopeptidase family. The main difference
between these sub-groups is the presence or the partial
loss of a GXMEN motif upstream the Zn2+-binding site.
The first sub-family is restricted to Actinobacteria (loss of
Gly, Met, Asn and conservation of Glu). A second sub-

family (lack of Gly, Glu, Asn and conservation of Met) is
composed of only one member expressed in Vertebrates
(Ap-O; [31]). Interestingly, numerous site-directed mutagenesis studies of the GXMEN motif among the M1 family(Aminopeptidase A, Ap-A, [38]; Aminopeptidase N,
Ap-N, [39]; Thyrotropine Releasing Hormone Degrading
Enzyme, TRH-DE, [40]; LTA4H, [41]) suggested that the
glutamate and asparagine residues are implicated in the
transition state stabilisation. Moreover, these residues,
that might interact with the NH2-terminus of substrates,
are also suspected to be responsible for the aminopeptidase specificity. The Gly residue (an exception is found for
TRH-DE, Ala versus Gly) seemed crucial for the activity
because its replacement with bigger or polar residues
abolishes the activity [40]. Lastly, the mutation of the
methionine affects both Km and Vm, but no precise role
of this residue was proposed [42]. Meanwhile, Ito and collaborators [43] demonstrated that this Met residue is
implicated in the recognition of different substrates,
explaining the broad specificity of the enzyme. Data about
the enzymatic activity of the proteins of the Actinobacteria
sub-family are not yet available. Diaz-Perales and collaborators demonstrated in vitro that Ap-O is an aminopepti-

dase with specificity for Arg and Asn residues [31]. Further
investigation on evolutionary relationships between these
proteins and especially on their enzymatic characterization constitute a major goal to grasp the physiological role
of these aminopeptidases implicated in fundamental
processes of cell metabolism.
In order to investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ap-B,
we used molecular modelling. In the present work, we
generate a molecular model of the whole rat Ap-B structure based on the crystal structure of the human LTA4H
[27]. The crystal structures of the Tricorn interacting factor
F3 (F3; [44]) and of the aminopeptidase N from E. coli
(ePepN; [43,45]), two other members of the M1 family
that exhibit less than 25 % of identity with LTA4H and ApB, were considered to be not closely related to Ap-B. Moreover, 4 structural domains exist in F3 [44] and ePepN
[43,45]. Interestingly, this fourth domain is inserted just
upstream the conserved amino acid region highlighted in
the multiple alignment (Fig. 4, position 490). The Ap-B
model is quite comparable to the LTA4H structure particularly at the level of their catalytic domains. Examination,
in both structures, of the distances between Zn2+ ion and
the chelating residues His325, His328 and Glu348, as well as
the shape and size of the substrate-binding pocket shows
a perfect homology.
The Ap-B structural model was also used to examine in silico predicted domains. The Ap-B primary structure contains a high consensual RNA binding RNP1 motif [37].
The whole consensus RNP motif is composed of two
motifs RNP2 and RNP1, both are highly conserved and
are usually found in simple or multiple copies (1 to 4).
RNP domain folds into a compact and hydrophobic αβ
structure (βαβ topology, a four anti-parallel β-sheet
framed by 2 α-helices perpendicular one to another).
RNP1 and RNP2 are found in the two central (underlined) strands, β4-β1–β3-β2. In Ap-B, the absence of
RNP2 motif and the fact that RNP1 is not included in a βsheet could prevent a functional role in RNA binding.
Indeed, the presence of this RNP1 motif could be attributed to a vestigial persistence resulting from gene duplications and a loss of nuclear functions in the course of the
evolutionary process. Conversely, the presence of a different RNP domain in Ap-B structure could lead to the
hypothesis that this protein has gained new interactions
via new domains and new structures. RNP1 might be
functional and form a particular structure with another
motif than RNP2. Indeed, the Ap-B primary structure contains putative nuclear localization sequences and some
data supports the hypothesis that this exopeptidase could
migrate to the nuclear compartment (unpublished
results). Further studies should demonstrate whether ApB is also a nuclear protein. In this case, the role of this
RNP1 motif will remain to be clarified.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

The COOH-terminal domains of LTA4H and Ap-B show a
structural region similar to the Armadillo repeats or to the
HEAT domains. These folds are usually composed of 3 to
36 pairs of anti-parallel α-helices that together form
superhelices. The α-helices are commonly 37 to 47 amino
acids long in the heat domains and about 40 amino acids
long in the armadillo repeats. The known proteins containing these motifs share functions in protein-protein
interaction/recognition [33-35]. Although this putative
domain in Ap-B and LTA4H exhibits shorter α-helices
(maximum of 15 residues), the super helical fold present
in both structures could lead to variations in the strength
of interactions and/or to different interacting proteins.
In addition to the potential HEAT domain, Ap-B exhibits
several other features, such as putative SH3 domains, negative electrostatic potential, large hydrophobic patches
leading to the hypothesis that this enzyme might interact
with different partners in different functions. These characters are generally different from those of LTA4H and
have been highlighted by the structural model proposed.
Differences in the electrostatic potential distribution
between Ap-B and LTA4H might reflect putative (or different) protein-protein interactions. Ap-B interacts with the
outer cytoplasmic membrane of cells and this interaction
might occur by protein-protein interactions [4,19]. Ap-B
participates, probably with different endopeptidases, to
an initial maturation process of neuropeptides and prohormones that might involve an endopeptidase/aminopeptidase complex [4,15-18]. Similar roles could be
attributed to hydrophobic patches, which delineate putative interacting surface. Ap-B exhibits larger hydrophobic
patches than LTA4H. On the other hand, the negative electrostatic potential at the level of the catalytic site might
explain the difference of enzyme specificity and between
their respective substrates: rather negative for LTA4H,
rather positive for Ap-B. Indeed, a long loop found in
both enzymes (Ap-B, K395LRVKIEPGVDPDDTY410;
LTA4H, K364LVVDLTDIDPDVAY378; Fig. 4), delimits and
separates the active center from the protein surface. This
loop, containing a small α-helix, seems to be involved in
substrate specificity as shown by site-directed mutagenesis
studies (LTA4H, [46]; TRH-DE, [47]; Ap-B, [48]) and structural data (LTA4H, [27]). A detailed examination of the
corresponding sequences shows that the LTA4H sequence
is more hydrophobic than the Ap-B sequence, the latter
exhibiting a high number of basic amino acids. Moreover,
the distribution of acidic residues shows a significant difference in both loops. They are regularly distributed in the
LTA4H loop structure and rather gathered up one end of
the loop in Ap-B, the last aspartate residue belonging to
the small α-helix pointing towards the active site.
This might explain the affinity and the positioning of the
Ap-B substrate. Basic peptidic substrates might be

attracted to the protein surface and to the active site by the
negative electrostatic potential. Then, substrate could be
guided towards the active center by the presence of hydrophobic and basic residues until stronger interactions
occurred involving negatively charged aspartate. The presence of the α-helix might bring some precision and stability to the substrate binding mechanism, balancing the
flexibility of the loop.

Conclusion
The structural model proposed is the first attempt for a
better understanding at an atomic scale of the Ap-B protein. The Ap-B 3D model, based on the fold of LTA4H,
yields important additional information that open the
way to design new experiments. For instance, electrostatic
potentials computed here, by nature, are features that can
only be calculated from a 3D structure, they result from
the superposition of the contribution of all the charges of
the atoms in a given point. Consequently, a simple
sequence analysis cannot foreshadow the electrostatic values. The results we described here illustrate clearly the
necessity to go further than simply describing the main
fold characteristics to detect fine surface properties of the
protein. The important differences in these features compared to LTA4H show without ambiguity that the nature
or the way the partners interact with Ap-B, the environment impact, would be different from LTA4H. Although
the complete range of physiological functions of Ap-B
remain to be discovered, previous data support the
hypothesis that Ap-B is involved in a broad spectrum of
relevant physiological phenomena. The specific exopeptidase activity of Ap-B participates in the final steps of neuropeptides and hormones processing (for review, see [1517,49]). Besides, the enzyme has been implicated in
inflammation and/or tumor growth [23,24]. These latter
roles might be due to the in vitro residual capacity of Ap-B
to hydrolyze the LTA4 into a lipid mediator of inflammation, the LTB4 [18]. In the absence of high-resolution crystal structure, as demonstrated for aminopeptidase A
[50,51] and numerous other proteins, this model constitutes a powerful tool for investigating the importance and
possible roles of conserved residues in Ap-B and M1 aminopeptidase catalytic sites and to gain new insight into
their physiological functions.

Methods
Construction of the prokaryotic recombinant rAp-B
expression vector
The rat Ap-B cDNA was initially cloned into the SrfIdigested pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) to
obtain the prAp-B plasmid [29]. Both prAp-B and the
pIVEX2.4 expression vector (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan,
France) were digested with NcoI and BamHI restriction
enzymes. The resulting Ap-B cDNA fragment was isolated,
purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Hilden,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

Germany) and ligated (T4 DNA ligase, New England
Biolabs, Hertfordshire, England) into the digested
pIVEX2.4 plasmid to obtain the pIVEX2.4-Ap-B recombinant plasmid, which was checked by sequencing
(Genome Express facilities, Meylan, France).
Production of rat Ap-B in E. coli
In order to produce rAp-B, we used a T7 promoter-driven
system and a BLi5 E. coli strain [52]. Ten milliliters of LB
medium supplemented with 20 µg/mL chloramphenicol
and 100 µg/mL ampicillin were inoculated with Bli5 cells
harboring the pIVEX2.4-Ap-B recombinant plasmid and
incubated overnight at 37°C with agitation. The overnight
culture was then diluted to 1:50 with 50 mL of fresh LB
medium containing 100 µg.mL-1 ampicillin and was
grown under vigorous shaking at 37°C until the OD600
reached 0.6. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG;
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) was
added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the expression culture was grown at 37°C with agitation for 2 hours.
Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g
for 5 min and stored at -80°C until use or processed
immediately as described below for Western blotting,
purification and enzymatic activity assays.
Purification of the recombinant His-tagged rat Ap-B
Purification using Ni-NTA agarose. pIVEX2.4-Ap-B transformed cell pellets from an expression culture (see above)
were resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) and sonicated,
at 40 Mcycles, 3 times during 1 min at 4°C. The extract
was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the
cellular debris. The supernatant was collected and mixed
with Ni-NTA agarose (v/v; Quiagen, Hilden, Germany),
which was pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The mixture
was incubated with gentle mixing for 1 H at 4°C and
applied to a minicolumn for gravity flow chromatography. The column was washed 3 times with 3 to 5 mL of
washing buffer (40 mM imidazole, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM TrisHcl, pH 8). Finally, the His-tagged purified protein was
eluted by 4 successive elutions with a buffer composed of
100 mM imidazole, 200 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl
at pH 8. Purification using DEAE ion exchange column. The
recovered supernatant (5 mL, see above) was diluted to 30
mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol.
Then the solution was applied to a DEAE Trisacryl Plus M
ion exchange column (100 mL bed volume; BioSepra, Villeneuve la Garenne, France) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.2. Proteins were eluted using a continuous
gradient from 0 to 100 mM KCl. The resulting active fractions (5 mL) were concentrated and equilibrated in 50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol using a
stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, model 8050; Ultrafiltration membrane YM 30; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA).

The determination of the protein concentrations in the
different steps of the purification procedure was performed using the Bradford method. The concentration of
the purified Ap-B was calculated using its molar absorbance coefficient (105.530 at 280 nm).
Western blotting
BLi5 or pIVEX2.4-Ap-B transformed cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2 mg/mL lysozyme.
Lysis was completed by 15 passages through a 25-gauge
needle and 3 sonication steps of 1 min at 40 Mcycles at
4°C. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 4,000 × g
during 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants containing the soluble intracellular proteins were retained. Aliquots of protein extracts or purified proteins were run under
denaturing conditions on an 8% polyacrylamide gel
(SDS-PAGE). Then, they were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel,
Germany) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Hoefer
scientific instruments, San Francisco, USA). The rat Ap-B
was detected with a specific anti-Ap-B polyclonal serum
[4] at a dilution of 1:2000. Antigen-antibody complexes
were visualized using a goat alkaline phosphatase coupled
secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) and an NBT-BCIP mixture (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). SDS-PAGE gels were
stained with silver salts [53] to visualize the proteins.
Site-directed mutagenesis
The pIVEX2.4-Ap-B recombinant expression vector was
used for site-directed mutagenesis and mutants were generated with the QuickChange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer specifications
(Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands). This system allows randomizing the targeted amino acids using
oligonucleotides containing degenerate codons (see
below). All the primers used for mutagenesis were 5'phosphorylated. A single oligonucleotide per site was
used in each experiment. The targeted amino acids and
their corresponding mutagenic primers were the following: H325, 5'-TGTGGGAGATCTCATRGATGATGACGTCG
G-3' for the H325Y and H325H mutants, 5'- TGTGGGAGATCTCGAAGATGATGACGTCGG-3' for the H325F
mutant, 5'- TGTGGGAGATCTCGGCGATGATGACGTCG
G-3' for the H325A mutant; E326, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGATSTTGTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326Q and E326E
mutants, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGATCKCGTGGATGATGACGT
C-3' for the E326A and E326E mutants, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGATWTCGTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326D and

as H325H, E326E, H329H and E348E are conservative
mutants. The mutagenic codon was underlined in the oligonucleotide sequence. The code for degenerate codons
was: R = A, G; S = C, G; K = G, T; W = A, T; M = A, C. Generated mutants were identified by direct sequencing on
both strands using the dideoxy chain-termination procedure (Genome Express facilities, Meylan, France).
Enzyme activity assays
Rat Ap-B activity was determined using the L-Arg- and LLys-β-naphthylamide (L-Arg-β-NA, L-Lys-β-NA; SigmaAldrich; Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) substrates and a
specific inhibitor, arphamenine B (Sigma-Aldrich; Saint
Quentin Fallavier, France) as previously described in [4].
Briefly, protein extracts were pre-incubated with or without 1 µM arphamenine B for 15 min at 37°C in assay
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) prior to incubation at
37°C for 60 min in the assay buffer containing 0.2 mM LArg-β-NA. Hydrolysis was interrupted by the addition of
0.3 mL of freshly prepared color reagent (Fast Garnet GBC
salt; Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The
absorbance was read at 535 nm using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of rAp-B activity, which is equivalent
to the percentage of inhibition, was measured by comparison with values obtained without inhibitor. Although no
other peptidase activities were detectable in purified or
semi-purified proteins, activity assays with wild type HisrAp-B enzyme were performed as described above.
Sequence analysis
Version 2.2.10 of the BLASTP program [54] was used, with
default parameters (BLOSUM62 matrix), to identify
members of the M1 family of metalloexopeptidases. The
Uniprot database (Release 29.0) was queried with the rat
Ap-B protein sequence (accession no U61696; [18]) and
512 hits were observed. Among these hits, 500 amino acid
sequences exhibiting an E value between 0 and 1.e-8 were
selected. These 500 protein sequences were aligned using
CLUSTALW version 1.0; [55]. The alignment was refined
manually to minimize the number of gaps. Sequences,
which exhibited obvious mistranslations resulting from
sequencing errors, were deleted from the alignment. The
complete listing of the sequence descriptions and the initial and final multiple alignments are available upon
request. The PATTERNp program [56] was used to define
the consensus amino acid signatures of the M1 family.

Molecular Modelling
Homology models were constructed as described in
[57,58]. Briefly, models were constructed with Modeller
package 6.2 version using the 3D structure of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase in complex with Zinc ion and bestatin
as a template [27]. In the template structure, the bestatin
molecule is located in a tunnel-like cavity. In the model,
we do not consider the bestatin molecule for two reasons:
i) further theoretical parameters are required for optimizing the whole complexed structure and ii) leaving the cavity free permits a comparison of the difference or
similarities in the physico-chemical features of the tunnel
in both structures.

The alignment used is described in Figures 4 and 6.
Among the 100 models constructed that mainly differ in
the indel regions, the 3D model with the optimal objective function was selected ("Initial Model"). Side chains
were then repositioned with Scwrl3.0 software. Zinc ion
was placed in an equivalent position as observed in the
crystal structure of LTA4H. Structure refinement was performed with energy minimization in vacuum with NAMD
package using Charmm force field parameters. A 12 Å cutoff for coulombic interactions was used coupled with 8 Å
switching distance. The minimization process was performed in two steps: i) all the atoms of the protein were
fixed while the Zn ion was free to move then ii) all the side
chains and the Zn ion were free to reorient but the backbone was maintained fixed. The minimization procedure
was performed until a gradient tolerance of 10-6 or less
was reached. We did not perform any further minimisations freeing all the atoms because of the absence of a
proper explicit environment and also for best maintaining
the size of the bestatin pocket. The geometric quality of
the structure was assessed with Procheck. The quality of
the model was tested using 3D-evaluation tools available
on the meta-server bioserv [59]. The model was considered to be good with Verify3D, ProsaII and Eval23D,
although the average scores were lower with the two last
methods.
Structural Analysis
The structural analysis of the Ap-B model was performed
as described in [57,58]. Pocket cavities in the minimized
structures were explored using the CastP server.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/21

corresponding to the aligned regions between the two
sequences.
Hydrophobic patches on the surface were computed
according to the Quilt approach. The results depend on
different parameters that can be specified: atomic radii,
probe radius, polar expansion and point density per atom.
The computations were performed with an expansion
value of 1.4 Å for the radii of polar atoms (same as the
probe radius) as suggested in the original publication. The
number of point density per atom was equal to 252. Statistical relevance of patches was evaluated according to the
randomization process proposed by the authors. We
chose 10 iterations for the assessment.
