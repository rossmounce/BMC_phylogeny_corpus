Abstract
Background: The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) class of proteins is present in all
known eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea, and it is comprised of three member families that
share the ability to catalyze the cis/trans isomerisation of a prolyl bond. Some fungi have been used
as model systems to investigate the role of PPIases within the cell, however how representative
these repertoires are of other fungi or humans has not been fully investigated.
Results: PPIase numbers within these fungal repertoires appears associated with genome size and
orthology between repertoires was found to be low. Phylogenetic analysis showed the singledomain FKBPs to evolve prior to the multi-domain FKBPs, whereas the multi-domain cyclophilins
appear to evolve throughout cyclophilin evolution. A comparison of their known functions has
identified, besides a common role within protein folding, multiple roles for the cyclophilins within
pre-mRNA splicing and cellular signalling, and within transcription and cell cycle regulation for the
parvulins. However, no such commonality was found with the FKBPs. Twelve of the 17 human
cyclophilins and both human parvulins, but only one of the 13 human FKBPs, identified orthologues
within these fungi. hPar14 orthologues were restricted to the Pezizomycotina fungi, and R. oryzae
is unique in the known fungi in possessing an hCyp33 orthologue and a TPR-containing FKBP. The
repertoires of Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus nidulans were found to
exhibit the highest orthology to the human repertoire, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae one of the
lowest.
Conclusion: Given this data, we would hypothesize that: (i) the evolution of the fungal PPIases is
driven, at least in part, by the size of the proteome, (ii) evolutionary pressures differ both between
the different PPIase families and the different fungi, and (iii) whilst the cyclophilins and parvulins have
evolved to perform conserved functions, the FKBPs have evolved to perform more variable roles.
Also, the repertoire of Cryptococcus neoformans may represent a better model fungal system within
which to study the functions of the PPIases as its genome size and genetic tractability are equal to
those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whilst its repertoires exhibits greater orthology to that of
humans. However, further experimental investigations are required to confirm this.

Background
The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) class of
proteins is traditionally comprised of three distinct protein families, the cyclophilins (cyclosporin A binding proteins), FKBPs (FK506 binding proteins) and parvulins,
that are linked by their shared ability to catalyse the bond
preceding a proline residue between its cis and trans
forms. However, the recent identification of a cyclophilinFKBP hybrid protein (FCBP; FK506- and cyclosporinbinding protein) in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma
gondii [1] and the identification of three further members
of this novel family in two distinct bacteria, Flavobacterium
johnsonii &Treponema denticola, as well as in at least ten
other bacteria in the sequence databases (TJP; unpublished data), may indicate a shared early evolutionary history for the cyclophilin and FKBP families. All families,
with the exception of the FCBPs that appear to be confined to the bacterial and protist lineages (TJP; unpublished data), are found widely distributed in eukaryotes,
prokaryotes and archaea [2-8], implying that their function is required in cellular processes from bacteria to man,
and in all the major compartments of the cell [8-11].
Despite their shared conservation throughout nature, the
three traditional PPIase families do not share a conserved
role in cell viability. In bacteria, the four known periplasmic PPIases in Escherichia coli (FkpA, PpiA, PpiD, and
SurA) have been reported not to be essential for growth
under laboratory conditions [12]. However, two cytosolic
PPIases, PpiB and trigger factor, in Bacillus subtilis have
been shown not to possess an essential function under
normal growth conditions, but they become essential for
cell viability under starvation conditions [13]. All of the
cyclophilins and FKBPs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been individually and collectively
knocked out with no effect on cell viability [14,15]. Only
Ess1, the S. cerevisiae orthologue of the human parvulin
Pin1, has been reported to be essential within S. cerevisiae
[16]. However, only a very low level is required for cell
growth under normal conditions, but a higher level is
required in the presence of environmental challenges
[17]. This essential cellular role is shared with its orthologue in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans [18], however not with their orthologues in their fellow fungi
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [19] and Cryptococcus neoformans [20], or the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [21]. It
therefore appears likely that the essential function of
some Pin1 orthologues is limited to certain organisms or
that there is a degree of redundancy present in these other
organisms that compensates for its absence.
Recently, a mutation in the D. melanogaster cyclophilin
CG3511 that severely truncates the protein has been
reported to confer a synthetic lethal phenotype on cells
that lack the retinoblastoma (Rbf) protein [22]. Mice lack-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

ing Pin1 [23], Cyclophilin A [24], FKBP12 [25], FKBP12.6
[26], and FKBP52 [27] have all been found to be viable
and to develop normally, although the latter did result in
partial embryonic lethality [27]. However, Pin1-deficient
mice were found to be at a higher risk of developing
Alzheimer's disease [28], and also to have cell-proliferative abnormalities that included decreased body weight,
testicular and retinal atrophies, and the failure of the
breast epithelial compartment to undergo the normal
changes associated with pregnancy [23,29]. FKBP12-deficient mice were found to suffer from severe dilated cardiomyopathy and noncompaction of left ventricular
myocardium, which mimics a human congenital heart
disorder [25]. Cardiac hypertrophy was found in
FKBP12.6-deficient male mice, but not in females, unless
the protective effect of oestrogen was abrogated [26].
Finally, FKBP52-deficient male mice were found to have
several defects in reproductive tissues which included
ambiguous external genitalia and a dysgenic prostate [27].
It therefore appears that despite the high conservation of
the PPIases throughout the eukaryotes and prokaryotes,
they do not possess an essential function within many
cells under normal growth conditions, but may become
essential in the absence of other cellular factors or in
response to environmental challenges. Also, whilst PPIases appear not to be essential for the viability of the
mouse, their haploinsufficiency may result in abnormalities that impact the fitness of the animal and which could
be models for human disease.
Whilst some fungi have found commercial applications,
such as S. cerevisiae, Sz. pombe and R. oryzae in fermenting,
others have been identified as both human [30-35] and
plant [36-38] pathogens. PPIases within some bacterial
pathogens have been found to have a key role in their
pathogenicity [39-45], and a cyclophilin within the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has been reported
as important for its virulence [46]. However, in most cases
it is unknown what role, if any, fungal PPIases play in the
pathogenicity of their host cell. Until we identify and
understand the PPIase repertoires of these pathogens, we
cannot begin to unravel their potential roles within the
cell and their use as putative therapeutic targets.
Reported here is the identification and comparative analysis of the PPIase repertoires present in sixteen fungi that
represent four different fungal taxa; Ascomycota (Candida
albicans, Candida glabrata, Debaryomyces hansenii, Eremothecium gossypii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Yarrowia lipolytica, Aspergillus
fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Gibberella zeae, Neurospora
crassa), Basidiomycota (Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago
maydis), Microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi) & Zygomycota (Rhizopus oryzae). By comparing these fungal rep-

ertoires, we hope to identify key conserved PPIases that
are found within all their repertoires as well as those that
are specific to each fungal taxa or fungus. By compiling the
known functions of these PPIases, we hope to better
understand both those that function within a broad range
of fungi as well as those that are specific to a particular
fungal linage that may be linked to their specific characteristics. This comparison will also serve to aid our interpreting of the use of fungal model systems in furthering our
understanding of the roles of PPIases within vastly different cell types.

Results
Identification of PPIase repertoires
The PPIase repertoires of the different fungi were identified by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches of their proteome
and genome, respectively, maintained by the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the
protein sequences of human cyclophilin A, FKBP12, and
Pin1 as probes to identify the cyclophilin, FKBP, and parvulin families, respectively. The cyclophilins were all identified with an E-value between 10-10-10-69 and a sequence
identity between 28–73% with the exception of six proteins. These six proteins are members of two previously
identified cyclophilin groups that possess a divergent PPIase domain [11] and they gave E-values <10-10 and a
sequence identify <30% when compared against hCypA.
These cyclophilins were identified using the Sz. pombe and
S. cerevisiae members of these groups [See Table 16 in
Additional File 1]; Group K – DhCyp6, AfCyp8, &
UmCyp6; Group L – YlCwc27, DhCwc27, & EgCwc27).

The Group K members gave E-values between 10-56-10-109
and a sequence identify between 40–60%, and the Group
L members gave E-values between 10-20-10-37 and a
sequence identity between 27–31%. The FKBPs were all
identified with E-values between 10-13-10-38 and a
sequence identity between 33–62%. The parvulins were
all identified with E-values between 10-19-10-49 and a
sequence identity between 34–55% with the exception of
four that gave E-values between 10-6-10-8 but retained a
sequence identity between 33–37% (AfPar1, AnPar1,
GzPar1, & NcPar1). Upon inspection, these proteins possessed a clearly identifiable parvulin-like rotamase
domain but lacked the characteristic WW domain of the
metazoan Pin1 proteins. Searching of the fungal sequence
databases using the human parvulin Par14 as a probe
identified these four parvulins with E-values between 1028-10-32 and a sequence identity between 54–59%, confirming them as parvulins.
The identified PPIase repertoires within the fungal
genomes investigated can be found in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Table 15 shows a comparison
of the number of members of each PPIase family found
within the different fungi. The repertoire orthology of the
cyclophilins, FKBPs and parvulins as identified by BLAST
analysis can be found in Table 16 [See Additional File 1].
Figure 1 shows the dendrograms generated for the cyclophilins (A), FKBPs (B), and parvulins (C). Pairwise E-values, bit scores, and percentage sequence similarity and
identity between all members of each cyclophilin, FKBP,
and parvulin group, as well as a global comparison for

File 8.
Comparison of PPIase repertoire sizes
The number of PPIases present within these fungi (Table
15) varies from three in E. cuniculi to 22 in R. oryzae. To
compare the sizes of the different repertoires, the number
of PPIases has been weighted by the number of genes in
their genome. The average number of PPIases was 1.9 per
1000 genes in the genome (Table 15), with the most PPIase rich fungi being Sz. pombe, which has just over 2.5 per
1000 genes in its genome, and the most PPIase poor fungi

being G. zeae, which has just over 1 per 1000 genes in its
genome. These differences are also reflected in the taxa,
with the Pezizomycotina fungi having an average number
of PPIases of 1.54 per 1000 genes, compared to the Saccharomycotina fungi which have 2.02 per 1000 genes.
Looking at the weighted number of each PPIase family in
these two taxa, this difference appears due to a reduced
number of cyclophilins and FKBPs within the Pezizomycotina fungi. It also appears that Sz. pombe is PPIase rich
due to an above average number of cyclophilins and
FKBPs, whilst G. zeae is PPIase poor due to a below average number of all three PPIase families.
Cyclophilin numbers in the different fungi vary predominantly between 6 and 11, however at the extremes E.

cuniculi has only 2, and R. oryzae has 16 (Table 15). The
most cyclophilin rich fungi is C. neoformans with 1.98 per
1000 genes, closely followed by Sz. Pombe with 1.87 per
1000 genes, and the most cyclophilin poor fungi is G. zeae
with 0.71 per 1000 genes, followed by N. crassa with 0.89
per 1000 genes. The number of FKBPs in these fungi is
typically 3 or 4, with the extremes being none in E. cuniculi
and 5 in R. oryzae, which is in keeping with their respective
genome sizes (Table 15). The most FKBP rich fungi is C.
glabrata with 0.76 per 1000 genes, closely followed by S.
cerevisiae with 0.68 per 1000 genes and Sz. pombe with
0.62 per 1000 genes, and the most FKBP poor fungi is E.
cuniculi with none, followed by G. zeae with 0.21 per 1000
genes and R. oryzae with 0.29 per 1000 genes, with the latter being surprising given that it has the largest PPIase rep-

ertoire of these fungi (Table 15). There is on average just a
single parvulin in these fungi (Table 15), with the exception being the presence of a second in members of the
Pezizomycotina taxa, but this number is in keeping with
their genome size. The most parvulin poor fungus is R.
oryzae, which has just the sole parvulin despite it having a
genome size larger than that of the Pezizomycotina fungi.
The most parvulin rich is E. cuniculi, with its sole parvulin
but very small genome size compared with the other
fungi.
Overall, G. zeae and R. oryzae have the sparsest PPIase repertoires of these fungi, with both lacking the number of
members in all three PPIase families that would be predicted based on their genome sizes. Sz. pombe and C. neo-

formans have the densest PPIase repertoires of these fungi,
with the former having an increased number of cyclophilins and FKBPs over the expected value, whilst the latter
solely has a larger than expected cyclophilin repertoire.
Cyclophilin orthology
Table 16A [See Additional File 1] shows that there are only
two cyclophilin groups that are conserved throughout all
the fungi. One group are the human cyclophilin A orthologues (Group B), a ubiquitous group of cyclophilins that
have been reported to be cytoplasmic, in agreement with
the PSORT predicted localization for all members except
RoCyp1 (Table 16A [See Additional File 1]), with an
appreciable nuclear component [10,47-49], which given
the absence of nuclear localisation sequences (NLS)
within their sequences is likely due to interactions with
target proteins that shuttle them into the nuclear compartment. However, SpCyp2 has been reported to be present
in discrete vesicles within the cytoplasm [11], and
RoCyp1 was predicted by PSORT to be nuclear, which is
in partial agreement with the observed localization for
members of this group, implying that the localization of
this group may be variable between different organisms.
This is supported by the observation that the cyclophilin
A orthologue in N. crassa has two isoforms that localize to
the cytoplasm or the mitochondrion, dependant upon the

cleavage of a N-terminal signal peptide [50]. Similar dual
functions may also exist with other members of this
group, but they have not yet been identified. Members of
this group have been reported to function in protein activity regulation [51], transcriptional regulation [51-53], a
vesicular import pathway [54], the control of both the
meiotic [46,49] and mitotic [46,55] cell cycles, and in the
mediation of the virulence of C. neoformans [46], indicating that they have wide ranging functions within the cell.
The second group that is present in all the fungi is that of
the human cyclophilin B orthologues (Table 16A [See
Additional File 1]; Group G). This group is identified by
their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by an Nterminal signal peptide [9-11,56,57], in agreement with
their PSORT predicted localization (Table 16A [See Additional File 1]). AnCyp6 has been reported to be upregulated during heat shock and it is capable of inhibiting
calcineurin in the presence of CsA, but it is not essential
for cell growth [57]. A second cyclophilin in both R. oryzae
(RoCyp9) and S. cerevisiae (ScCpr2) appears to be a paralogue of their respective Group B member, suggesting that
these fungi may be evolving divergent functions within
their ER that require a second ER cyclophilin related to
Group G. ScCpr2 has been reported to be present in the
fungi's secretory pathway [10,14,58] and induced by heat

stress and tunicamycin [59], confirming its localization.
Their presence in the ER and up-regulation during heat
shock would strongly suggest a role within the vesicular
protein folding pathway, presumably as a folding catalyst
and chaperone.
Only one group is present in all but one of the fungi, E.
cuniculi. The human cyclophilin 40 orthologues (Table
16A [See Additional File 1]; Group I) are a group of heat
shock inducible [11,60-62] predominantly nuclear
[10,11] cyclophilins. They are predicted by PSORT to be
cytoplasmic and possess no NLS with the exception of
UmCyp5, suggesting that their presence in the nucleus is
through interactions with target factors that shuttle them
into the nucleus rather than their direct targeting. Members of this group have been reported to function within
the Hsp90 complex [62-64], potentially regulating its

ATPase activity [65], during its functions in cellular signalling pathways that regulate transcription [62,66], the cellular heat shock response [60] and also in maintaining the
cell cycle protein kinases Mik1, Wee1 and Swe1 [67]. This
would suggest that this group functions as a control element within a wide range of cellular signalling pathways
that include the regulation of the cell cycle.
The Cwc27 orthologous are present in 12 of the 16 fungi
(Table 16A [See Additional File 1]; Group L). Not originally identified as members of the cyclophilin family,
recent research has identified the presence of a degenerate
PPIase domain in the N-terminus of these proteins followed by a C-terminal region rich in S/K-R/E residues that
is similar to those observed in hnRNP-binding proteins
[11,68]. All members were predicted by PSORT to be
nuclear, which has been confirmed experimentally for

ScCwc27 [10], however SpCyp7 has been reported to be
found within the perinuclear space [11]. Both SpCyp7
and ScCwc27 have been reported to be a component of
their respective Cdc5 complex [69], but their function,
and those their orthologues, within this complex remains
unknown. However, it does identify a role for this group
within pre-mRNA processing. This is also in contradiction
with the observed localization of SpCyp7, as the Cdc5
protein complex has been reported to be predominantly
nuclear [10,70], indicating that SpCyp7 may have multiple functions within Sz. pombe.
Three groups are present in 10 out of the 16 fungi, with no
members identified in E. cuniculi and all but two of the
Saccharomycotina fungi (Table 16A [See Additional File
1]; Groups D, K & N). From the latter, D. hansenii, along
with Y. lipolytica, has a member in both Groups D & N, or
E. gossypii, in Group K. Very little is known about the func-

tions of Group D besides the predominantly nuclear
localization of SpCyp3, with a suggested role in premRNA splicing [71], and its apparent presence in the spindle-pole bodies and/or microtubule organizing centres
[11], both of which are contrary to the groups PSORT predicted cytoplasmic localization for all members except
DhCyp2 which was predicted to be nuclear (Table 16A
[See Additional File 1]), suggesting that the presence of
this group in the nucleus is due primarily to their association with other factors. Again, very little is known about
the functions of Group N, all of whose members are predicted to be cytoplasmic by PSORT, with the exception of
DhCyp9 and UmCyp8 which were predicted to be
nuclear, and share the presence of WD40 motifs in their
N-terminal region. This motif is found in all eukaryotes,
but not in prokaryotes, in a large variety of proteins that
share no obvious commonality in their functions [72].
Finally, Group K members share the presence of a C-ter-

Metazoan protein factors involved in constitutive premRNA splicing and alternative splicing regulation [73].
Again, very little is known about this group in fungi
beyond the highly specific nuclear localization of SpCyp6
[11] and a putative role in cell morphogenesis, cortical
organization and nuclear reorganization [74]. The locali-

zation of SpCyp6 is in agreement with the PSORT predicted localization of all members of this group except for
EgCyp5 and DhCyp6 which were predicted to be cytoplasmic, indicating that their targeting to the nucleus may also
be due to an association with other targeting factors, presumably during their functions within the pre-mRNA
processing complexes.

One group is found in 9 of the 16 fungi, with no members
identified in E. cuniculi, and all of the Saccharomycotina
fungi with the exception of Y. lipolytica (Table 16A [See
Additional File 1]; Group M). Half of its members are predicted by PSORT to be nuclear (RoCyp14, SpCyp8,
YlCyp8, & UmCyp7) whilst the other half are predicted to
be cytoplasmic (AnCyp9, AfCyp9, NcCyp6, GcCyp7, &
CnCyp11). This difference is grouped by taxa, suggesting
that there may be a difference in function between them
despite the high sequence homology they all share [See
Additional File 8] or that their function is both within the
cytoplasm and nucleus and that this targeting difference is
a response to changes in their target factors that in the latter group can transport them into the nucleus, but not in
the former. They all possess an N-terminal U-Box motif,
which is reported to be a modified RING-finger motif
involved in protein:protein interactions that has been primarily identified in proteins involved in the ubiquitin/
proteasome system [75]. As with the previous groups, very
little is known about the functions of this group within
these fungi beyond the predominantly nuclear localization reported for SpCyp8 [11], which is in agreement with
its PSORT predicted localization.
All but four of the fungi have a PSORT predicted mitochondrial cyclophilin, the exceptions being R. oryzae, E.
cuniculi, Sz. pombe and U. maydis. These cyclophilins are
found spread between two othology groups (Table 16A
[See Additional File 1]; Groups E & F) that are distinguished based upon sequence characteristics [See Additional File 8]. Group E is present in the all
Saccharomycotina fungi, whilst Group F is present in all
Pezizomycotina fungi and C. neoformans. In Group E,
ScCpr3 has been reported as a mitochondrial cyclophilin
[10] required for mitochondrial function under heat-

stress [76] and as a protein folding chaperone within the
mitochondria [59,77,78]. In Group F, NcCyp4 has both a
mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoform [50]. Mitochondrial NcCyp4 has been reported to cooperate with Hsp70
and Hsp60 within the mitochondrial matrix and whilst
mitochondria lacking functional NcCyp4 efficiently
imported preproteins into the matrix, the folding of the
imported preprotein was significantly delayed [79]. It has
also been reported to suppress the gating of the putative
fungal mitochondrial permeability transition pore in a
CsA sensitive manner [80]. No functions are yet known
for its cytoplasmic isoform, but based on this information
the mitochondrial isoform appears important for the
maintenance of mitochondrial function. Interestingly,
AnCyp3 and AfCyp4, whilst both showing a high degree
of sequence homology to the other members of Group F
[See Additional File 8], they were both predicted by
PSORT to be cytoplasmic, unlike the other members of
this group, due to the absence of a signal peptide [See
Additional File 8]. R. oryzae has two cyclophilins (RoCyp5
& RoCyp6) that appear to be paralogues based on their
sequence (data not shown) and also show a high degree
of orthology to the members of mitochondrial Group E
(data not shown), however they are predicted by PSORT
to be cytoplasmic as no mitochondrial localization
sequences were identified within their sequence. They
could possess unknown mitochondrial targeting signals,
but further investigation is required to confirm this.
Two groups are present only in R. oryzae, the Pezizomycotina fungi, and the Basidiomycota fungi with the exception of U. maydis (Table 16A [See Additional File 1];
Group A) or N. crassa (Group C). All Group A members
are predicted to be cytoplasmic by PSORT, however
SpCyp1 has been reported to be predominantly nuclear

[11] and to function within a broad range of SNW/SKIP
signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation [81], suggesting that it is its interaction with factors within these pathways that cause its
targeting to the nucleus. Group C members are predicted
by PSORT to be cytoplasmic, but nothing is currently
known about the functions of this group.
Group J is found solely within the Saccharomycotina
fungi (Table 16A [See Additional File 1]). This is a second
TPR-containing cyclophilin group whose members
exhibit a very high degree of sequence homology with
their respective member of the other TPR-containing
group (Group I; data not shown), and in the case of
ScCpr7, to also interact with Hsp90 [61,82,83], suggesting
that they share a similar role within cellular signalling
pathways. Like Group I, members of this group are predicted by PSORT to be cytoplasmic, in agreement with the
reported localization for ScCpr7 [10], with the exception
of CaCyp6 which was predicted to be nuclear, supporting
possible conserved functions.
Finally, Group H is also found solely within the Saccharomycotina fungi with the exception of Y. lipolytica (Table
16A [See Additional File 1]). ScCpr4 has been reported to
localise to the endoplasmic reticulum [10,14], function
within the secretory pathway [59], possess a putative
transmembrane domain and is induced by heat shock and
tunicamycin. This would suggest that this group has a role
within the vesicular protein folding pathways as a folding
catalyst or chaperone.
The dendrogram showing the putative evolutionary relationship of the fungal cyclophilins (Figure 1A) shows
good agreement with the groups identified by BLAST analysis (Table 16A [See Additional File 1]), and it may also
allow us to better understand the evolution of the eleven
individual cyclophilins identified in four of the fungi.
Interestingly, we would have expected the uni-domain
cyclophilins to have evolved first, followed by the larger
multi-domain cyclophilins as the cells become more complex. However, the pattern in the dendrogram suggests
that the initial divergence separated the ancestor of the
TPR containing Groups I & J from the ancestor of the other
groups. The other multi-domain groups are found to
evolve amongst the other uni-domain cyclophilins, of
which many have evolved from the ER Group G despite
their predominant PSORT predicted cytoplasmic and
nuclear localizations. Only uni-domain Groups A, E & F
are observed to evolve on a separate branch which they
share with four individual cyclophilins (RoCyp5,
RoCyp6, RoCyp11, & CnCyp10). This would suggest that
the functions of Group I became important early in the
evolution of the fungi, with the other multi-domain
groups evolving as the cells became more complex, and/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

or as the uni-domain cyclophilins evolved functions that
required a second domain.
It is of note that in many cases the evolution of the members of each group does not follow that of their respective
fungi. This suggests that there may be variable factors
within these fungi that are driving their evolution. Some
fungi share these factors in common despite not sharing a
close evolutionary history, whilst others that share a close
evolutionary relationship do not. This would result in variable evolutionary pressures on individual members of
the group, leading to clustering in the dendrogram away
from that of the evolutionary history of the host fungus
but which may be representative of shared evolutionary
factors.
Despite the observed clustering of most groups identified
by BLAST analysis within the dendrogram, two groups do
however show fragmentation; Group B, which is found in
four distinct parts of the dendrogram, and Group G,
which is found in two. This would suggest a complex evolutionary history for these two groups, but may also indicate that some members that have been identified by
BLAST analysis may not be true orthologues of these
groups. In most cases, the parent fungi of these outliers
does not have a member in the group to which these outliers appear associated, and these groups also appear
related to the group identified by BLAST analysis. This
could indicate that there are selective pressures driving
these outliers to perform some functions of the group to
which they appear associated, slightly increasing their
homology to this group and away from their BLAST identified group, but not enough to be distinguished by BLAST
analysis, resulting in their observed clustering in the dendrogram.
The initial divergence separated the discrete branch that
contains the ubiquitous TPR containing human cyclophilin 40 orthlogues (Group I) and their Saccharomycotina
specific paralogues (Group J), and the human USA-CyP
orthologues (Group D), implying a shared evolutionary
history, from the other groups (Figure 1A). All are predicted by PSORT to be cytoplasmic, which is supported by
experimental studies which also showed an appreciable
nuclear component for members of each group [10,11]. It
is interesting that the uni-domain members of Group D,
whose function appears vastly-different from those of
Groups I & J, appears to have evolved from a common
ancestor with Group J.
The evolution of the cytoplasmic human cyclophilin A
orthologues (Group B; Figure 1A) and mitochondrial
cyclophilins (Groups E & F; Figure 1A) appears on a discrete second branch, which on a wider aspect is shared
with four individual cyclophilins, three within R. oryzae

Page 13 of 30

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

(RoCyp5, RoCp6, & RoCyp11) and one from C. neoformans (CnCyp10). RoCyp5 & RoCyp6 appear to possibly be
part of mitochondrial Group E based on sequence homology (data not shown) although they are predicted by
PSORT to be cytoplasmic due to the absence of any signal
sequences, and RoCyp11 & CnCyp10 appear to be related
based upon sequence homology (data not shown), but
not sufficiently to be called orthologues. The presence of
Groups B, E, & F on this shared branch would suggest a
close evolutionary history, which is supported by the
observed dual cytoplasmic and mitochondrial nature of
the NcCyp4 gene [50] and the appreciable sequence
homology between Groups B, E, & F (data not shown).
NcCyp4 shares a sub-branch with GzCyp5, AnCyp3 &
AfCyp4, suggesting that these other cyclophilins may, or
may have, exhibited this dual nature, which is supported
in the case of GzCyp5 by the presence of a putative N-terminal signal peptide [See Additional File 8]. There is no
clear separation of these groups into discrete subbranches, with YlCyp1, a member of Group B, found
within Group E on a sub-branch it shares with YlCyp3, its
Group E member, indicating that their evolution may
have been more restricted or more recent than the other
members leading to their greater sequence homology.
Interestingly, AfCyp2, a member of Group B, is found on
its own sub-branch that shares a major branch with
Groups D, I, and J, suggesting a different evolutionary
path for this cyclophilin from the other Group B members. EcCyp1, another Group B member, is also found on
a separate sub-branch, which it shares with CnCyp6, an
individual cyclophilin that appears to be a paralogue of
CnCyp3, its Group B member, suggesting that EcCyp1
may have adapted to perform functions for which C. neoformans has evolved a second cyclophilin to perform. Also
interesting is that RoCyp1 is found within the Group J
members on a separate branch, whilst RoCyp2, an apparent paralogue of RoCyp1, is found on the same branch as
Groups B, E, & F. Based on sequence homology RoCyp1
would be called the R. oryzae orthologue of Group B [See
Additional File 8], however its PSORT predicted nuclear
localization is in contrast to the cytoplasmic localization
predicted for the other members of Group B. It's observed
clustering in a different branch of the dendrogram could
indicate that it has a divergent function from this group,
and that RoCyp2 may be the true Group B member
despite exhibiting a lower sequence homology towards its
members. RoCyp2 also shares its branch with RoCyp10, a
fungal cyclophilin that is unique in that is possesses an Nterminal RRM domain. The presence of an RRM is only
observed in one other group (Group K) where it is found
in their C-terminal domain. Nuclear Group K is found on
a separate branch from cytoplasmic RoCyp10 (Figure 1A),
suggesting that these two RRM containing cyclophilin
groups have evolved separately to perform their specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

functions which may be within different compartments of
the cell.
The final major branch sees all other groups evolve from
a common ancestor that appears to begin with the precursor to ER Group G (Figure 1A), which itself appears to
have evolved in three phases that are not restrained by the
evolutionary history of the fungi. The initial branch contains all the members from the Pezizomycotina fungi, as
well as CnCyp7, SpCyp4, RoCyp8, and interestingly
YlCyp4, a member of the Saccharomycotina taxa. The
other members from the Saccharomycotina taxa appear to
evolve in the remaining two branches, with CaCyp3
evolving with DhCyp4 and interestingly UmCyp3, a
member of the Basidiomycota taxa, whilst ScCpr5,
EgCyp3, KlCyp3, and CgCyp3 all evolve on the final
branch. This pattern of evolution is hard to explain. It may
involve the convergent evolution of some cyclophilins to
perform a common function present in some, but not all,
of the fungi, or it could indicate the presence of shared
evolutionary pressures within subsets of the fungi. An
individual cyclophilin within R. oryzae, RoCyp9, is also
seen to evolve on the first branch along with its closely
related Group G member, RoCyp8, which may indicate
that a recent gene duplication has occurred. S. cerevisiae
also has an individual cyclophilin, ScCpr2, that is present
on the same major branch as its Group G member, but it
appears more distantly related (data not shown) which
would indicate that if gene duplication did occur, it happened earlier than the R. oryzae duplication.
It is fascinating that the remaining functionally divergent
groups that are predominantly present in the cytoplasm
and nucleus all appear to have evolved from the ER Group
G. The initial divergence from Group G appears to have
separated the evolution of two cytoplasmic groups, unidomain Group A and the WD40 containing Group N,
with the former appearing to evolve on a discrete branch
that shares a common ancestor with the later, from the
other remaining groups. Both appear vastly different in
putative function, with Group A being small uni-domain
predominantly nuclear cyclophilins whilst Group N are
large multi-domain putatively cytoplasmic cyclophilins,
suggesting that Group N gained the WD40 domain after
their divergence from their common ancestor.
The next divergence in the companion branch sees the
evolution of the ER Group H on two discrete branches,
which are shared with ScCpr8, an individual cyclophilin
in the budding yeast that whilst it is not found in the ER,
it has been reported to be a membrane bound protein
[14]. This is not far removed from that of an ER protein,
and this may have come about through the loss of its ability to loose its signal peptide. Interestingly, EcCyp2, a
member of Group G, is found within these branches

Page 14 of 30

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

rather than on the branches with its fellow group members. This could indicate a degree of divergent evolution of
this cyclophilin to fulfil the needs of both Group G and
Group H within its parent fungi. The final divergence led
to the evolution of the nuclear RRM containing Group K
and the related Cwc27 orthologues (Group L), both of
which appear to be involved in mRNA processing, on a
discrete branch from the cytoplasmic uni-domain cyclophilins of Group C and the U-box containing predominantly nuclear Group M, which themselves are also found
to evolve on a shared branch.
FKBP orthology
Table 16B [See Additional File 1] shows that the only
FKBP group to have members in all these fungi, with the
exception of E. cuniculi which has no FKBPs in its genome,
are the human FKBP12 orthologues (Group A). ScFpr1
has been reported to be cytoplasmic [10], in agreement
with their PSORT predicted localization with the exception of UmFKBP2 which was predicted to be nuclear.
SpFKBP12 has been reported to have an important role in
the early steps of the fission yeast sexual development

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

pathway but it is not essential for normal growth [84], and
mutant cells that lack CaFKBP1 [85] and CnFKBP1 [86]
have also been reported to be viable under normal conditions. Finally, ScFpr1 has a reported regulatory role within
the homoserine synthetic pathway where disruption of its
function perturbs the aspartokinase feedback inhibition
by threonine resulting in the toxic accumulation of aspartate β-semialdehyde, the substrate of homoserine dehydrogenase [87]. Group B (Table 16B [See Additional File
1]) and the individual FKBP AnFKBP2 appear to be closely
related to Group A based upon sequence homology (data
not shown), but nothing is presently known about the
functions of these FKBPs.
The only other group to show conservation in many of
these fungi is that of Group C (Table 16B [See Additional
File 1]). Members are present in all but E. cuniculi, Sz.
pombe, E. gossypii, G. zeae, and C. albicans, despite the
closely related fungus D. hansenii (Figure 2) having a
member. R. oryzae has two closely related FKBPs,
RoFKBP2 & RoFKBP3, that appear to be paralogues and
show a high degree of homology with the other members

of Group C (data not shown). ScFpr2 has been reported to
be resident within the ER [10,88], and NcFKBP3 has been
reported to be synthesized as a precursor protein with a
cleavable signal sequence and a C-terminal HNEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal, strongly suggesting that NcFKBP2 is an ER resident protein [89]. This is in
agreement with the PSORT predicted ER localization for
all members of this group with the exception of CgFKBP2
and NcFKBP2 which were predicted to be cytoplasmic due
to the absence of an N-terminal signal peptide. In addition, NcFKBP3 was reported to have a carboxyterminal
domain that has an amino acid composition biased
towards charged residues that is predicted to form an
amphipathic α-helix [89], which could indicate that
NcFKBP3 will function at the surface of plasma membranes [90].
The remaining groups identified within the FKBP repertoires appear specific to a subset of the fungi compared
here. Group I has been identified solely within the Pezizomycotina fungi (Table 16B [See Additional File 1]), however nothing is known about the members of this group
besides their PSORT predicted cytoplasmic localization
(Table 16B [See Additional File 1]). Group D was identified only within N. crassa and G. zeae and both members
were predicted by PSORT to localize to the ER, but their
functions remain unknown. Group F (Table 16B [See
Additional File 1]), whose members are predicted by
PSORT to all be nuclear, is found only within some of the
Saccharomycotina fungi, the exceptions being Y. lipolytica,
D. hansenii, and C. albicans. Both S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata have a second FKBP that shares a high degree of
homology with their member of Group F (Table 16B [See
Additional File 1]; Group G), and ScFpr4 has been
reported to share similar properties with ScFpr3. Both
ScFpr3 [10,91-93] and ScFpr4 [10,76,94] have been identified as nuclear, and have been reported to suppress
defects seen in the absence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
TOM1 [94]. ScFpr3 has also been reported to maintain
recombination checkpoint activity through the control of
protein phosphatase 1 [95], a critical function during meiosis, and the phosphorylation state of ScFpr3 is important
for correct growth [96] but has no affect on its localization
[97], suggesting the phosphorylation state of ScFpr3 is
important for its cellular function. Members of Group H
are present only within C. albicans and D. hansenii, with
the former appearing to also have a paralogue of its member, CaFKBP2, and there is a closely related FKBP within
Y. lipolytica, YlFKBP3.
Finally, Group E is found in four of the 16 fungi (Table
16B [See Additional File 1]); R. oryzae, Sz. pombe and both
of the Basidiomycota fungi. Three members are predicted
by PSORT to be nuclear (RoFKBP4, SpFKBP39, &
UmFKBP3), however CnFKBP3 is predicted to be ER due

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

to the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting a possible difference in function despite its high
sequence homology towards the other members of this
group [See Additional File 8]. SpFKBP39 has been
reported as nuclear [98] and to have a role in chromatin
remodelling involved in ribosomal DNA silencing
through a potential role as a histone chaperone [99].
The dendrogram for the evolution of the FKBPs (Figure
1B) shows good agreement with the groups identified by
BLAST analysis (Table 16B [See Additional File 1]). It is
interesting to note that the dendrogram suggests that the
evolution of the uni-domain FKBPs (Groups A, B, C, & D)
occurred first, with the FKBPs that possess a second
charged domain (Groups E, F, G, & H) evolving later in
their history. The exception to this is the evolution of
RoFKBP5, the only fungal FKBP with a TPR domain in this
comparison, which appears before the evolution of the
other multi-domain FKBPs. Orthologues of RoFKBP5 are
not present in any of the other fungal genomes that are
currently available (data not shown), suggesting that it
may be restricted to a specific fungal taxa. Without further
orthologues the evolutionary history of this group cannot
be fully explored, as RoFKBP5 could have either evolved
recently in R. oryzae, or at an earlier point in a recent
ancestor.
The FKBPs all appear to have evolved from a single ancestor that was related closest to Group A, the cytoplasmic
FKBP12 orthologues. These are seen to evolve first but in
four different phases that appear as the other groups begin
to evolve. UmFKBP2 and YlFKBP1 are found on the earliest branch, suggesting that these are the earliest precursors
of this group, which does not agree with the evolution of
the fungi as both are members of different taxa (Figure 2).
The next three divergences separate the evolution of the
remaining Group A members from the other FKBPs. First
to evolve were the Saccharomycotina Group A members
on their own discrete branch, followed by the remaining
Group A members SpFKBP12, RoFKBP1, CnFKBP1,
AnFKBP1 & AfFKBP1, and finally NcFKBP1 and GzFKBP1.
This pair shares a branch with the Group B members in A.
nidulans and A. fumigatus, which both appear to be closely
related to their Group A members at the sequence level
(data not shown), and interestingly RoFKBP5, an individual cyclophilin that is unique in possessing a TPR domain.
The next divergence led to the evolution of AnFKBP2, an
individual cytoplasmic FKBP that appears closely related
to its Group A member, from the other groups. The evolution of ER Group C came next, whose members have all
evolved on a discrete branch that separates the Saccharomycotina members and R. oryzae, which is normally
found with the other fungal taxa, on one sub-branch and
the other fungal taxa, who share their sub-branch with

Page 16 of 30
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

RoFKBP3, an individual ER FKBP that appears to be a paralogue of its Group C member (data not shown), and the
two members of the final ER group, Group D, on the
other.
Next came the evolution of the Group E members, which
occurred in two phases. All but the Sz. pombe member
evolve on a discrete branch, with SpFKBP39 found on a
different branch it shares with SpFKBP39a, which appears
to be a paralogue of SpFKBP39 (data not shown) that has
been reported to be nuclear [98]. This suggests that Sz.
pombe has evolved a second FKBP to perform the functions of Group E. All members of Group E were predicted
by PSORT to be nuclear, with the exception of CnFKBP3
which was predicted to be in the ER due to the presence of
an N-terminal signal peptide. Their clustering in the dendrogram would indicate that any divergence in function
was relatively recent as their sequences have not yet significantly diverged.
Cytoplasmic Group I, whose members are restricted to the
Pezizomycotina fungi, is found to evolve on the companion branch from the groups that include the SpFKBP39
branch. Finally, the evolution of the nuclear Groups F, G
& H are all found on the same branch, indicating a close
evolutionary relationship. The evolution of Group F is
observed on a discrete branch that shows a close evolutionary relationship with both members of Group G,
which is supported by their high sequence homology
(data not shown). Finally, Group H shares its discrete
branch with two individual FKBPs, cytoplasmic YlFKBP3
and nuclear CaFKBP2, both of which appear to be related
to Group H at the sequence level, but not to each other
(data not shown). It also appears that the divergence of
CaFKBP2 and CaFKBP3 is relatively recent, as they appear
together on the same discrete branch.
Parvulin orthology
Compared with the cyclophilin and FKBP repertoires, the
parvulin repertoires are relatively small. All the compared
fungi share a single parvulin in common with a second
parvulin only found within the Pezizomycotina fungi
(Table 16C [See Additional File 1]). Members of both
groups are predicted by PSORT to be nuclear, with the
exception of one member of Group A (GzPar1), and two
members of Group B (EgPin1 & AnPin1), suggesting that
the direct targeting of these groups to the nucleus is either
not essential and/or that their interaction with target factors recruits them into the nucleus, or that we do not fully
understand all of the fungal NLS.

The sole parvulin they all share in common is that of the
human Pin1 orthology group (Table 16C [See Additional
File 1]; Group B). SpPin1 is reported to be it a positive regulator of the cell cycle control proteins Wee1 and Cdc25

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

[19]. ScEss1 is reported to be nuclear and involved in transcription through an interaction with the C-terminal
domain of RNA polymerase 2 [10,100-105] downstream
of its phosphorylation repsonse to DNA damage [106],
and in cell cycle regulation [19]. Interestingly, ScEss1 [16]
and CaEss1 [18] have been reported as essential genes,
whereas SpPin1 [19] and CnEss1 [20] have been reported
to be non-essential, although that latter has been reported
to be required for virulence. Cross-talk between ScEss1
and ScCpr1 [20,55], a member of cyclophilin Group B,
has been reported to modulate the activity of the Sin3Rpd3 complex with excess histone deacetylation causing
mitotic arrest in ScEss1 mutants [53] and CnEss1-null
mutants have been reported to be hypersensitive to CsA
[20], suggesting a cyclophilin-mediated redundancy
mechanism. Disruption of ScEss1 can be complemented
by DmDodo [21] and the plant Digitalis lanata's Par13
[107], which lacks the WW domain conserved in the other
proteins, indicating a conserved functionality may exist
between all Pin1 orthologues that is essential in some but
not all organisms under normal growth conditions and
only requires the rotamase domain. CaEss1 is reported as
essential for growth and the reduction in its dosage or
activity blocks morphogenetic switching between the
hyphal and pseudohyphal forms under certain conditions
[18]. Structural studies have shown that whilst CaEss1 has
the same overall structure as its human orthologue,
hPin1, it's altered α-helical linker results in a rigid juxtaposition of the WW and rotamase domains that gives the
two domains of CaEss1 a distinct orientation from that of
hPin1, eliminating the hydrophobic pocket between the
domains that was identified as the main substrate recognition site [108]. NcPin1 is unique among the known
eukaryotic parvulins in containing a polyglutamine
stretch between the N-terminal WW domain and the Cterminal rotamase domain [109], indicating that it may
have a specialized function within this fungi. So far it
would appear that some, but not all, of the functions of
this group are essential, with varying degrees of redundancy present in some fungi, and structural studies would
suggest that whilst these functions require one or both of
the domains present in its members, it is unlikely that
they will act in synergy given that their orientation
appears to vary between the different members.
The final parvulin orthology group was identified only in
the Pezizomycotina fungi (Table 16C [See Additional File
1]; Group A). Whilst nothing is presently known about
this group in fungi, it is interesting to note that its members appear to all be orthologues of the second parvulin
group previously only identified within the Metazoa that
includes human Par14 [68,110]. This indicates that the
evolution of Group A must have occurred prior to the evolutionary split of the unicellular fungi from the ancestral
cell that went on to form the Metazoan eukaryotes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

As we would expect, the dendrogram for the parvulins
(Figure 1C) shows the evolution of Group A occurs on a
discrete branch from those of Group B, but interestingly it
shares a branch with EcPin1, a member of Group B. The
dendrogram shows that the members of Group B have not
evolved within their specific taxa, but rather they have a
shared evolution, as inferred by the lack of clustering of
the members from each taxa onto the same branches.
There are four sub-branches that form Group B, with
CaEss1, DhPin1 and RoPin1, appearing the most
removed of all the members, with the remaining groups
forming on two branches, with UmPin1 and CnEss1
evolving form the same branch as Group A and appearing
related to EcPin1. Interestingly, the three members for
which structural studies have been reported are found on
separate branches, indicating that the clustering of the
Group B members in the dendrogram may represent the
three different tertiary structural conformations that they
represent.

Saccharomycotina fungi; S. cerevisiae, D. hansenii, E. gossypii, and Y. lipolytica. Three groups were present in two
Saccharomycotina fungi; Cytoplasmic Groups D & N was
present in Y. lipolytica and D. hansenii, and nuclear Group
K was present in D. hansenii and E. gossypii. Finally, predominantly nuclear Group M was only present in one of
the Saccharomycotina fungi, Y. lipolytica. Four groups
were found to be absent in the Saccharomycotina fungi.
As with the above groups, cytoplasmic Group A is
restricted to the Pezizomycotina fungi, C. neoformans, Sz.
pombe and R. oryzae, but in this case it was absent in the
Saccharomycotina fungi. Similar to Group A, cytoplasmic
Group C was restricted to U. maydis, R. oryzae Sz. pombe,
and the Pezizomycotina fungi with the exception of N.
crassa. Finally, mitochondrial Group F was restricted to
the Pezizomycotina fungi and C. neoformans. Three groups
were also found to be restricted to the Saccharinycotina:
Mitochondrial Group E, endoplasmic reticular Group H,
and cytoplasmic Group J.

Discussion

Eleven individual cyclophilins were identified, six of
which are present in R. oryzae; RoCyp2, RoCyp5 and
RoCyp6 which appear to be paralogues, RoCyp9,
RoCyp10, which is the only known fungal cyclophilin
with an N-terminal RRM, and RoCyp11. All were predicted to be cytoplasmic with the exception of RoCyp9,
which was predicted to be endoplasmic reticular, and
RoCyp11, which was predicted to be nuclear. Of the
remaining five, two were present in both S. cerevisiae
(ScCpr2 & ScCpr8) and C. neoformans (CnCyp6 &
CnCyp10), and one was present in Y. lipolytica (YlCyp5),
with the remainder of the fungi having no unique cyclophilins in their repertoire. Of these last five, ScCpr2 has
been found to function in the ER, ScCpr8 has been
reported to associate with membranes, YlCyp5 is predicted to be nuclear, and CnCyp6 is predicted to be cytoplasmic.

The number of PPIases within these fungal repertoires varies, with E. cuniculi having the smallest repertoire with 3
and R. oryzae the largest with 22, which is close to that of
D. melanogaster and C. elegans [68]. The number of PPIases
in a given repertoire appears associated with the number
of genes in the genome of the fungus, averaging 1.9 PPIases per 1000 genes. Some fungi were found to be more
PPIase rich than others, such as Sz. pombe and C. neoformans with around 2.6 PPIaess per 1000 genes, whilst others
were found to be relatively PPIase poor, such as G. zeae
and R. oryzae, with 1.06 and 1.26 PPIases per 1000 genes,
respectively. The greatest variation was observed in the
number of cyclophilins, where on average there were
between 6 and 13 present, whilst the number of FKBPs
were fairly constant, with between 3 and 5 present, and on
average just a single parvulin was present. The exception
was the presence of a second parvulin within the Pezizomycotina fungi, whose parvulin repertoires resemble
those of the Metazoa [68]. E. cuniculi was unique is possessing no FKBPs, whilst retaining a member for both of
the highly conserved cyclophilin groups (Table 16A [See
Additional File 1]; Groups B & G) and the sole highly conserved parvulin group (Table 16C [See Additional File 1];
Group B).
We have shown that only two cyclophilin groups, cytoplasmic Group B and endoplasmic reticular Group G, are
present in all of the fungi. Another predominantly cytoplasmic group is found in all the fungi with the exception
of E. cuniculi (Group I), which has no further cyclophilins
in its repertoire. Five groups were found to be restricted to
C. neoformans, Sz. pombe R. oryzae, the Pezizomycotina
fungi, and were also present in some of the Saccharomycotina fungi. Nuclear Group L was present in four of the

We have found that the cyclophilins appear to have a wide
range of functions within the cell, but there are several
conserved themes within these functions. We have the
expected roles in protein folding and chaperoning both
within the ER (Groups G & H) and the mitochondrion
(Groups E & F). For the former, only one group was found
to be present within all fungi (Group G) whereas Group
H was found solely within all but one of the Saccharomycotina fungi, Y. lipolytica, suggesting that these fungi
require an increased amount of PPIase-mediated protein
folding within their ER. Given their small genome size
(Table 15), this is presumably an adaptation to environmental challenges predominantly affecting this taxa. The
mitochondrial groups are found separated between two
separate taxa, Group E is present solely within the Saccharomycotina fungi whilst Group F is found solely within
the Pezizomycotina fungi and C. neoformans, suggesting a

divergence in their functions within the mitochondria.
Group F also has two different types of members; we have
the dedicated mitochondrial cyclophilins in C. neoformans, and presumably A. nidulans and A. fumigatus despite
their PSORT predicted cytoplasmic localization, and those
in N. crassa and G. zeae that have two isoforms that target
them to the cytoplasm (Group B) or mitochondrion
(Group F), which may shed light on the evolutionary history of these groups. Interestingly, no mitochondrial
cyclophilins were identified in Sz. pombe, E. cuniculi and
U. maydis, which given that they are spread throughout
the fungal evolutionary tree is easiest explained by gene
deletion. R. oryzae also had no identified mitochondrial
cyclophilin, but it does have two cyclophilins that show a
high degree of sequence homology to mitochondrial
Group E but which are predicted by PSORT to be cytoplasmic due to the absence of any signal sequences.
We have also found three groups involved in cellular signalling pathways (Groups A, I, & J). Whilst Group A
appears to function within the SNW/SKIP pathways
involved in cell proliferation and differentiation within
all the fungi except E. cuniculi, U. maydis, and the Saccharomycotina fungi, Groups I & J appear to function as part
of the Hsp90 complex in hormone signaling and cell cycle
pathways in all fungi except E. cuniculi, or in the case of
Group J, only within the Saccharomycotina fungi, suggesting that this taxa has additional divergent pathways that
require an extra cyclophilin-Hsp90 chaperone. Overall,
these cyclophilin groups appear to function within cellular signaling pathways involved in regulating the cellular
growth response to external signals.
Finally, we have three groups that appear to have a role
within pre-mRNA processing (Groups D, K, & L), that are
largely absent from the Saccharomycotina fungi and E.
cuniculi (Table 16A [See Additional File 1]). The presence
of an RRM in members of Group K suggests that they function in the recruitment of the RNA related to cell morphogenesis, cortical organization and nuclear reorganization
into the pre-mRNA processing complexes, whereas members of Group L have been found present within the Cdc5
complex and along with Group D, are believed to function within pre-mRNA splicing.
There are also some groups with unique or less defined
functions within these fungal repertoires. Group B is
present in all the fungi and its members appear to function in a wide range of pathways from the control of protein activity, transcription, translation and the cell cycle,
to the vesicular transport of proteins and the control of
fungal virulence. Group M is found in all the fungi except
E. cuniculi and the Saccharomycotina fungi, with the
exception of Y. lipolytica, and its members are believed to
function in the proteosome degradation pathway, poten-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

tially recruiting target proteins for degradation based
upon the presence of a U-box domain in their sequence.
Group N is present in the same fungi as Group M, but also
D. hansenii, and its members appear to function within
protein complex(s) due to the presence of a WD40 motif
in their sequence. However, both groups require further
investigation to elucidate their functions within the cell.
Also, there is one group (Group C), which lacks any secondary domains with which to infer a putative function
and at present, there is nothing known about its members
besides its presence in all fungi except the Saccharomycotina fungi, E. cuniculi, Sz. pombe, and N. crassa.
Only a single FKBP group was present in all fungi, with the
exception of E. cuniculi as it possessed no FKBPs, that
being cytoplasmic Group A which shows orthology to
human FKBP12 (Table 16B [See Additional File 1]; Group
A). ER Group C was found to be in all fungi with the
exception of Sz. pombe, E. gossypii, G. zeae, and C. glabrata.
Three groups are restricted to the Saccharomycotina fungi.
Nuclear Group F is present in all members except for Y.
lipolytica, D. hansenii, and C. albicans. Nuclear Group G is
only found in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata and its members
exhibit high sequence homology to members of Group F,
and nuclear Group H is found only in C. albicans and D.
hansenii. The remaining four groups are not found in the
Saccharomycotina fungi, of which three are restricted to
the Pezizomycotina fungi; Cytoplasmic Group I, ER
Group D, which is only present in N. crassa and G. zeae
but neither of the Aspergillus fungi, and Group B, which is
found only within the Aspergillus fungi and appears
closely related to Group A. Finally, nuclear Group E was
restricted to R. oryzae, Sz. pombe, and both of the Basidiomycota fungi, U. maydis, and C. neoformans.
There were six individual FKBPs identified as present
within five of the fungi (Table 16B [See Additional File
1]). Two were present within R. oryzae; RoFKBP2 appears
to be a paralogue of RoFKBP3, a member of ER Group C,
and it also shares a PSORT predicted ER localization.
RoFKBP5 is predicted by PSORT to be cytoplasmic and it
is the only known fungal FKBP to contain a TPR domain.
The remaining four fungi each have just a single individual FKBP. A. nidulans has an extra cytoplasmic FKBP,
AnFKBP2, that appears to be closely associated with
Groups A & B, and Sz. pombe contains nuclear SpFKBP39a,
which appears to be a paralogue of its Group E member
(SpFKBP39). Both C. albicans (CaFKBP2) and Y. lipolytica
(YlFKBP3) have an FKBP that shows appreciable sequence
homology to nuclear Group H, with CaFKBP2 sharing this
nuclear localization, whereas YlFKBP2 is predicted by
PSORT to be cytoplasmic.
We do not find the same clustering of functions with the
FKBPs as were found with the cyclophilins. There are two

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

ER groups (Groups C & D), but whilst it appears that they
will be involved in the vesicular protein folding pathways
this has not been confirmed experimentally, and they are
present only within a subset of the fungi (Table 16B [See
Additional File 1]), suggesting that their function is not
universally conserved. Group A was found to be in all
fungi and they appear to have a wide range of roles within
the sexual development of the fungi and also in other
pathways where it appears likely that their role is in maintaining the correct folding of the protein components of
these pathways. Group B appears closely associated with
Group A based on sequence homology (data not shown),
although no functions are yet known for its members.
Nuclear Groups F & G are both found only within a subset
of the Saccharomycotina fungi (Table 16B [See Additional
File 1]) and they appear functionally linked. Members of
Group F appear to have a role within recombination
checkpoint maintenance. A member of nuclear Group E
has been reported to function within chromatin remodelling associated with DNA silencing, and its presence in
only Sz. pombe, R. oryzae and the Basidiomycota fungi
implies a specific rather than generalized function. At
present, nothing is known about cytoplasmic Group I,
which is found solely within the Pezizomycotina fungi, or
nuclear Group H, which is found only within C. albicans
and D. hansenii.
Both the cyclophilins and FKBPs are found similarly distributed throughout the cells organelles, but the cyclophilins are the only family found within the mitochondria.
However, the apparent evolutionary pattern of the cyclophilins and FKBPs was found to be different. Whilst the
single domain FKBP groups appear to have evolved prior
to the larger multi-domain FKBP groups (Figure 1B), suggesting that the latter became important as cellular complexity increased, the same is not true for the cyclophilins
(Figure 1A). The TPR containing multi-domain cyclophilin groups appear to have evolved very early on, suggesting that they have a very important and primal role within
the cell, whereas the other multi-domain cyclophilin
groups have evolved throughout the dendrogram at varying stages in the evolution of the fungal cyclophilin
groups. This would suggest that the factors that drove the
evolution of the multi-domain cyclophilin groups are, at
least in part, different from that of the multi-domain
FKBPs. Interestingly, in some instances we find single
domain cyclophilin groups evolving from the branches of
multi-domain groups. This would suggest that as the
multi-domain cyclophilins evolved along with the cell, in
some instances they were able to adapt to perform some
functions without the secondary domain, and in such
instances were able to spawn a new group to perform
these functions as they continued to evolve new ones.
Alternatively, there may have been an evolutionary event
in one of their targets, such as the creation of a duplication

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

of a target protein that then evolved to require a subtle
adaptation in the cyclophilin that could not be accommodated. In such instances, a gene duplication of the cyclophilin and the incorporation of this adaptation into one
copy would allow the protein and its host fungi to continue their evolution. If this change also ends the requirement for the cyclophilins secondary domain, it would
cease to be selected for which would allow for its loss at
some point during the evolutionary history of this new
group.
This observation would suggest that the evolution of the
FKBP family may have been in response to the increasing
complexity of the proteome of these fungi as they have
evolved, which after a certain point required more than
just the PPIase catalytic domain to perform their functions
in some cases. However, the cyclophilins appear to have
evolved both in response to the increasing complexity of
the proteome of these fungi and to the increase in the
complexity of the underlying biological pathways that
allow the fungi to survive, implied by the sporadic nature
of the evolution of the more complex cyclophilins.
The final and smallest of the PPIase families, the parvulins, had just a single representative in most of the fungi,
that of the nuclear human Pin1 orthology group (Table
16C [See Additional File 1]; GroupB) whose members
appear to have a wide range of functions within transcription and cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, a second
nuclear member was present in the Pezizomycotina fungi
that showed orthology to the human parvulin Par14
(Group A). Orthologues of Group A have only previously
been identified in the Metazoa, and were thought to have
evolved within the Metazoa, however their presence in the
Pezizomycotina fungi brings a new perspective on their
evolution. The position of the Pezizomycotina taxa in the
evolutionary tree and the absence of any Group A orthologue in the other fungi does however create a mystery.
There is no common ancestor shared between the Pezizomycotina taxa and the Metazoa that the former does not
share with other fungal taxa. So if this group evolved prior
to the divergence of both the Pezizomycotina and Metazoa from their common ancestor, why did the other fungi
not retain this parvulin? Or, did these parvulins evolve
separately within the Pezizomycotina and Metazoa by
convergent evolution? This group is not present in any of
the other fungal genomes currently available in the NCBI
database (data not shown), making the further analysis of
this group within the genomes of additional fungi as they
become available imperative to understanding their evolution and role within the cell.
Taking into account both the evolutionary paths of the
three different PPIase families, their conservation within
the different fungi, and their known functions within the

Page 20 of 30

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

fungi, we would hypothesize that the parvulins and cyclophilins have evolved to perform conserved functions
within the fungi. The parvulins appear to have primal
functions, presumably retained from the bacterial lineages within which this PPIase family is the predominant
group [6,111], to which they are now largely restrained,
whilst the cyclophilins appear to have gained functions at
varying stages during fungal evolution. However, the
FKBPs appear to have evolved to fill the ever-changing
niches within these constantly evolving fungi, presumably
in response primarily to the evolutionary pressure associated with the increase in the number of proteins that
required chaperoning as the fungi increased in complexity.
The duplication and differentiation of genes, giving rise to
multigene families, and genomic rearrangements, which
allowed for the acquisition of new domains and regulatory sequences, has been a characteristic feature in the
evolution of eukaryotic genomes and it is likely to have
been a major factor in the evolution of the fungi [112116]. There is some evidence that gene duplication has
occurred during the evolution of the fungal PPIase repertoires. Some of the PPIases in this comparison are apparent paralogues of another PPIase in their respective
repertoire (Table 16 [See Additional File 1]): R. oryzae
(RoCyp1-RoCyp2, RoCyp5-RoCyp6, & RoFKBP2RoFKBP3), C. neoformans (CnCyp3-CnCyp6), Sz. pombe
(SpFKBP39-SpFKBP39a),
C.
albicans
(CaFKBP2CaFKBP3), A. fumigatus (AfFKBP1-AfFKBP2), and in all
the Saccharomycota fungi (Group I-Group J). Interestingly, A. nidulans has a group of three FKBPs that all
appear to be paralogues (AnFKBP1-AnFKBP2-AnFKBP3),
suggesting that their progenitor gene may have undergone
multiple duplications during the evolution of A. nidulans.
A. fumigatus has a pair of FKBPs that are apparent orthologues of two of these genes (Table 16 [See Additional File
1]; AnFKBP1-AfFKBP1 & AnFKBP3-AfFKBP2), indicating
that the evolution of the third paralogue (AnFKBP2)
occurred after the divergence of A. nidulans from A. fumigatus.
There is strong evidence that the genome of the common
ancestor of S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, and the Saccharomyces
sensu stricto yeast, underwent whole genome duplication
(WGD) after its divergence from the ancestors of the other
fungal lineages [117-121]. Whilst a vast majority of the
duplicated genome was lost, some duplicate gene copies
were retained and subsequently underwent differentiation to form distinct members of the evolving multigene
families. This gene retention varied from cell to cell and
this is likely to have been a major contributory factor in
the divergent evolution of the different yeast that evolved
from this ancestral cell. The WGD event appears to have
had an apparent role in the evolution of the cyclophilin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

and FKBP repertoires of S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. There
are three pairs of PPIase genes present within different
duplicated blocks identified in the genome of S. cerevisiae
[117,122]. Two pairs are cyclophilins (ScCpr2-ScCpr5,
block 14; ScCpr4-ScCpr8, block 11) and one pair are
FKBPs (ScFpr3-ScFpr4, block 44). Both of the cyclophilin
duplications are not present within the genome of C. glabrata or any other fungi in this comparison (Table 16A
[See Additional File 1]), however there are orthologues of
both ScFpr3 and ScFpr4 in the C. glabrata repertoire (Table
16B [See Additional File 1]). This would suggest that the
functions of these duplicate FKBP genes are important in
both S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata, but the functions of the
duplicate gene in both of the S. cerevisiae cyclophilin pairs
are not required in C. glabrata. K. lactis is the most recent
common ancestor to S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata in this
comparison (Figure 2), and its repertoire contains only
one of each pair of duplicate PPIases found in S. cerevisiae
and C. glabrata, supporting their evolution during the
post-WGD evolution of these latter fungi.
Gene deletion is also likely to have played role in the evolution of discrete fungi, as exemplified by the PPIase repertoire differences of C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae after their
divergent post-WGD evolution (Table 16 [See Additional
File 1]). The differences between the different fungal PPIase repertoires in Table 16 [See Additional File 1] include
both additional and absent PPIases between both the different lineages and individual fungi. In many cases, a PPIase orthology group is present in many of the fungi, but it
is absent in a particular lineage or in some cases members
of a particular lineage. Whilst the presence of some individual PPIases and the evolution of some groups, such as
cyclophilin Groups H & J, and FKBP Groups F & I, can be
explained easiest by gene duplication, in many others
gene deletion appears more likely, such as: cyclophilin
Groups A, C, D, K, L, M, & N, and FKBP Groups C & E.
Domain duplication and shuffling by recombination are
probably the most important forces driving protein evolution [123], with the majority of multi-domain proteins
likely to have evolved by the stepwise insertions of single
domains [124]. The dendrogram for the fungal cyclophilins (Figure 1A) and FKBPs (Figure 1B) show evidence that
this has probably occurred during the evolution of the
fungal PPIase repertoires. There are instances in the cyclophilin dendrogram (Figure 1A) where a multi-domain
cyclophilin group appears to have evolved from a unidomain group, such as: Group N – Group A, Groups K, L
& M – Group C, and Groups I & J – Group D. In the FKBP
dendrograms (Figure 1B), RoFKBP5 is found on a branch
with the members of Group B, a group closely related to
Group A with which it shares the larger branch (Figure
1B). It appears likely that the Group B members have
evolved by gene duplication given their high sequence

Page 21 of 30
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

homology to their respective Group A member (data not
shown). It is therefore possible that RoFKBP5 evolved
from a gene duplication event of its Group A member and
the subsequent acquisition of its TPR domain that
resulted in its divergence from the other Group B members. Interestingly, it has been reported that in most cases
domain order is conserved because recombination
between the domains usually only occurrs once during
the course of evolution [125], and in many protein family
combinations, the preservation of the N to C-terminal orientation of the combined domain pair is almost absolute,
with only a few examples of domain pairs appearing in
both orientations [126]. In the fungal cyclophilin repertoires identified here, we have one group with a C- terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM; Group K), and an
individual cyclophilin with an N-terminal RRM
(RoCyp10). It therefore appears that multiple recombination events have occurred between the RRM and cyclophilin domains, suggesting that this domain combination
may have an important role to play in the complex
eukaryotic cell.
The evolution of the fungal PPIase repertoires therefore
appears to have been complex involving both gene and
whole genome duplication, gene deletion, and multiple
domain-acquisition events. Based on the pattern of PPIase
conservation and their appearance/disappearance (Table
16 [See Additional File 1]) in relation to the evolutionary
history of these fungi (Figure 2), we would hypothesize
that the ancestral fungus from which these fungi evolved
would have had nine cyclophilins (members of Groups A,
B, D, G, I, K, L, M, & N), three FKBPs (members of Groups
A, C, & E), and just one parvulin (member of Group B).
However, the presence of a member of the second parvuilin group (Group A) cannot be discounted due to its presence within both the Pezizomycotina and the higher
eukaryotes. This repertoire size is comparable to that of
the current fungal repertoires (Table 15), with much of
the variation in size likely due to gene duplication and
deletion, as discussed above. The future availability of the
complete sequences of additional fungal genomes within
which to study the size and makeup of their PPIase repertoires will greatly improve our ability to hypothesize as to
the repertoire makeup of the ancestral fungal cell.
The level of orthology between the fungal PPIase repertoires and that of H. sapiens has been found to vary. Of the
12 human cyclophilins (Table 16A [See Additional File
1]), out of 17 [68], with orthologues present in these fungi
(Table 16A [See Additional File 1]), S. cerevisiae only has
representatives for four out of its repertoire of nine, which
is one less than E. gossypii (out of 8), and only marginally
better than C. albicans, C. glabrata and K. lactis, which all
have three (out of 6). Both Y. lipolytica and D. hansenii
have seven (out of 10) in common with H. sapiens, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

highest of the Saccharmycotina, with both lacking representatives of hCGI-124, hPPIL3, hCyp33, and hCypF,
although they do have an unrelated mitochondrial cyclophilin, and the former also lacks an hCyp57 orthologue
and the latter an hCyp60 orthologue. Sz. pombe, A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, U. maydis, N. crassa, G. zeae, and E.
cuniculi, all share their complete cyclophilin repertoires in
common with H. sapiens, however they do fall short of
having orthologues of all the human cyclophilins. The
two Pezizomycotina fungi, G. zeae and N. crassa, are interesting in that they both have a cyclophilin that has both a
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoforms (NcCyp4 &
GzCyp5) that show orthology with hCypA and hCypF
respectively, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin of the
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial cyclophilins as shown in
the dendrogram (Figure 1A). The other two Pezizomycotina fungi, A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, both have 11
human orthologues out of the possible 12 with both lacking an hCyp33 orthologue, and both possess separate
cyclophilins that show orthology to hCypA and hCypF.
This number of human orthologues is shared with R,
oryzae, which also has 11 out of the possible 12 present in
its repertoire of 16. In the case of R. oryzae, it is lacking a
mitochondrial hCypF orthologue, and it appears to not
possess a mitochondrial cyclophilin, although it does
have two that show a high degree of sequence homology
with the Saccharomycotina mitochondrial cyclophilins
(RoCyp5 & RoCyp6; data not shown).
H. sapiens has only a single FKBP in common with these
fungi, out of 13 [68], the orthologues of human FKBP12
(Group A; Table 16B [See Additional File 1]), which are
present in all the fungi with the exception of E. cuniculi,
which has no FKBPs. There are however two FKBPs within
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that are also present
within some of the fungi (DmCG14715 & DmFKBP39;
Table 16B [See Additional File 1]). These are both present
within U. maydis, C. neoformans, and R. oryzae, and they
are both absent within G. zeae, E. gossypii, and C. albicans.
DmCG14715 is present in all of the other fungi with the
exception of Sz. pombe, which is the only other fungi to
have an orthologue of DmFKBP39. As with the FKBPs,
only one human parvulin is present in all of the fungi, the
orthologues of human Pin1 (Group B; Table 16C [See
Additional File 1]). The second parvilin group that shows
orthology to human Par14 (Group A; Table 16C [See
Additional File 1]) is present only within the Pezizomycotina fungi.
Based on this orthology of the fungal PPIase repertoires to
that of H. sapiens, we have shown that whilst the fungi are
good models for the study of the cyclophilins and parvulins, they are a poor model for the study of the FKBPs. This
supports the hypothesis that the cyclophilins and parvulins have evolved to perform conserved functions within

Page 22 of 30

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

the underlying biological processes of the cell, whilst the
FKBPs have a role largely within protein folding that varies between organisms. The repertoires of A. nidulans, A.
fumigatus, and C. neoformans exhibit the closest resemblance, missing only an hCyp33 orthologue, which they
share with R. oryzae, which instead lacks an hCypF orthologue, and G. zeae, however the presence of a single gene
encoding the hCypA and hCypF within this latter fungi
reduces its resemblance.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a very powerful
model organism that has, and continues to, contribute
greatly to our deciphering of the molecular functioning of
our cells [reviewed in 127–129]. The study of its PPIase
repertoire has proven invaluable in understanding the
elusive functions of these proteins and it continues to provide new insights into their diverse cellular roles
[reviewed in 130]. However, as we have shown here and
previously [68], its PPIase repertoire poorly represents
those of the higher eukaryotes in comparison with the
repertoires of A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and C. neoformans.
Whilst research on the S. cerevisiae PPIase repertoire will
continue to aid us in the search to understand the functions of the PPIases in the eukaryotic cell, research within
fungi whose repertoires better represent those of H. sapiens
and the other Metazoa may offer greater insights into the
biological processes within which these PPIases function
in the more complex Metazoan cells that cannot be investigated in S. cerevisiae whose repertoire lacks orthologues
of these PPIases. In this respect, C. neoformans may represent a better model fungi as its PPIase repertoire exhibits
the highest orthology to the human repertoire of the fungi
reported here whilst retaining a genome size close to that
of S. cerevisiae (Table 15), making it more genetically tractable than A. nidulans, A. fumigatus and R. oryzae, whose
genomes are up to three times that of S. cerevisiae and C.
neoformans. It is already an established model organism
with the functional genomics and proteomics techniques
necessary to fully dissect their function Future experimental investigations are required to elucidate whether or not
this will prove to be the case.

Conclusion
Reported here is the identification of 16 fungal PPIase rep
ertoires representing multiple fungal taxa. This comparison has shown that the fungal PPIase repertoires do share
some orthology; however this orthology is reduced
between the different taxa and is also found to be variable
within these taxa. This analysis has also shown that the
evolutionary pattern of the cyclophilins and FKBPs appear
to be different, with the multi-domain cyclophilins
appearing throughout the evolution of the single domain
cyclophilins, whereas the multi-domain FKBPs have
evolved more recently after the evolution of the single
domain FKBPs. Based on the data presented here, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

would hypothesize that; (i) the evolution of the fungal
PPIases is driven, at least in part, by the size of the proteome, (ii) evolutionary pressures differ both between the
different PPIase families and the different fungi, and (iii)
whilst the cyclophilins and parvulins have evolved to perform conserved functions, the FKBPs have evolved to perform variable roles that appear predominantly within
protein folding. However, further experimental investigations are required to confirm these hypotheses. Interestingly, orthologues of the human parvulin hPar14 and
hCyp33 have been identified within the genomes of the
Pezizomycotina fungi and R. oryzae, respectively. These
PPIases were thought to be restricted to the Metazoa. Their
presence in these fungi suggests an older evolutionary history than was originally thought. A TPR-containing FKBP
was also identified within R. oryzae, making it the only
known fungal FKBP to possess one. Finally, whilst the PPIase repertoire of S. cerevisiae has been the subject of much
research, it is a poor representative of the repertoire of H.
sapiens and despite its highly successful use as a model
organism for the study of PPIases over the past two decades, very little is still known about the functions of some
of its PPIases. Whilst research into its repertoire will continue to give us insights into the function of the PPIases
within the eukaryotic cell, the repertoire of C. neoformans
may offer a better model system with which to further our
knowledge of the role of the PPIases within the human
cell given the greater orthology it exhibits towards it. This
research has also highlighted the need to fully investigate
how representative the model organism chosen to investigate the function of a family of proteins is to that of the
primary organism, so as to improve the portability of the
results.

Methods
Selection of fungal genomes
Fungi for this study were selected primarily by the presence of a complete annotated genome sequence within
the database maintained by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; [131]). The complete
annotated genome sequences of Sz. pombe [132], E.
cuniculi [133], S. cerevisiae [134,135], D. hansenii [115], E.
gossypii [136], K. lactis [115], C. albicans [137], C. glabrata
[115], Y. lipolyica [115], A. nidulans [138], A. fumigatus
[139], N. crassa [140], &C. neoformans [141] were selected
for this reason. G. zeae [142,143] and U. maydis [144]
were included as their genomes were 90% and 98% complete, respectively, and they are present in an annotated
state within the NCBI database. The unannotated genome
of R. oryzae [145] was included as it is the only example of
the Zygomycota in the NCBI database. In all three cases,
there are no plans to complete the sequencing and annotation of their genomes making their current sequence
repository as complete a picture as we are likely to achieve
of their repertoires.

Identification of the PPIase repertoires
The repertoires of Sz. pombe and S. cerevisiae were as previously described [68]. The identification of putative PPIases in the remaining fungi was performed using both
BLASTP (protein vs. protein) and TBLASTN (protein
against DNA sequence) searches [146] on all genomes
except for that of R. oryzae, where only TBLASTN searches
were possible. The TBLASTN step is important for detecting additional homologues because genes may remain
unannotated in the sequence databases. The members of
the three PPIase families were identified using the protein
sequences of human cyclophilin A (hCypA; UniProt
accession # P05092), human FKBP12 (hFKBP12; P20071)
and the human parvulins Pin1 (hPin1; Q13526) and
Par14 (hPar14; Q9Y237) as probes in BLASTP and
TBLASTN searches of their sequences. Proteins were
selected based upon the level of homology, both in regard
to actual sequence homology and/or the presence of characteristic motifs, their PPIase catalytic domain exhibited
towards that of their probes sequence. As the catalytic
domain of the different PPIases families have been found
to exhibit good conservation between related organisms
[4,5,147], a conservative expected (E) value cut-off of 1 ×
10-10 and/or greater or equal to 30% alignment sequence
identity [148] was used to identify homologues of the
three PPIase families. Two fungal cyclophilin groups that
possess a divergent PPIase domain have been previously
identified [11]. To confirm that all members of these
groups were identified (Table 16 [See Additional File 1];
Groups K & L), their Sz. pombe and S. cerevisiae members
were used as probes in BLASTP and TBLASTN searches of
the fungal proteomes and genomes, respectively.

In some cases, it was apparent that the sequence present
in the NCBI database was incorrect or incomplete. In
these instances, sequences were investigated and where
possible corrected prior to further analysis. Sequence corrections obtained by this manual curation were submitted
to the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) consortium
for verification [149]. Once verified, the appropriate UniProt reports were ammended to reflect this revised annotation. All protein sequences are available in the UniProt
database and their accession numbers are given in Tables
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and those that
were manually re-annotated are marked.
Protein sequence analysis
The identification of putative domains within the identified PPIases was performed using the NCBI CDD (Conserved Domain Database) database [150,151]. The
predicted localisation of the PPIases and the identification
of sequence motifs that support this were identified using
PSORT [152,153] located on the National Institute for
Basic Biology (NIBB) server [154]. The theoretical molecular mass of the predicted proteins were calculated using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/244

the calculation tool on the ExPASy server [155]. Pairwise
percentage sequence identity and similarity was calculated
using the Matrix Global Alignment Tool (MatGAT) version 2.02 [156] using a BLOSUM50 scoring matrix.
Comparative sequence analysis
Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were produced
using default settings in version 1.83 of the ClustalX program [157]. This program performs a pairwise alignment
of the sequences prior to the construction of a dendrogram, which describes the approximate groupings of the
sequences by similarity, with the final alignment carried
out using this dendrogram as a guide. The dendrograms
presented in Figure 1 were constructed from a global MSA
of each family of PPIases by the Neighbour Joining (NJ)
method with a Poisson correction for distance estimation
[158] and 500 bootstrap replicates. The dendrograms
were visualised from the files generated by the ClustalX
alignment using MEGA version 3.1 [159]. The scales of
the different dendrograms are not cross-comparable.
Identification of orthologues
PPIases were considered to be orthologues if they fulfilled
three criteria. Firstly, they should be of approximately the
same size and possess the same domain architecture. Secondly, in BLAST searches they should identify each other
ahead of all other PPIases within their respective genomes
[160]. This is because they should, in theory, share a more
recent common ancestor than they do with the other PPIases. Sequence variation, resulting from the distinct divergent evolution of each protein, should therefore be less
between two orthologues than with other PPIases.
Thirdly, they should have the same intracellular location
and function. This latter criterion is however reliant upon
prior research which is not applicable to all PPIases. In
these cases, as long as the first two criteria were met, then
the proteins were deemed to be putative orthologues.

Four methods were employed to identify the orthology
between the repertoires using the above criteria. Firstly,
the sequences of the identified PPIases were formatted by
family as a database file using the BLAST tools package
obtained from the ftp-site of NCBI [131,146] and an "all
against all" BLASTP method was used to identify homology between proteins. Orthologues were defined in the
following manner: (i) they must be reciprocal best hits
with an expectation (E)-value less than 1 × 10-10 [160], (ii)
they must share at least 40% similarity in amino acid
sequence [160], (iii) there must be <20% difference in
protein length [160], and (iv) have a bit score above 60,
which in almost all cases indicate a biologically relevant
relationship when motifs are conserved [161,162]. However, in cases where a protein failed to meet one of these
criteria but where membership to a particular orthology
group was well supported by the remaining BLAST criteria

Page 24 of 30

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:244

as well as by the remaining identification methods
detailed below, the protein was included as an orthologue
of that particular group. Secondly, each orthology group
identified by BLAST analysis were subjected to sequence
alignment using the ClustalX program version 1.83 [157]
to check for conserved domain architecture and conserved
sequence motifs [See Additional File 8]. Thirdly, the
sequences for all the member proteins of each of the three
different PPIase families (cyclophilins, FKBPs & parvulins) from all of the compared fungi were subjected to global sequence comparison by family using the ClustalX
program version 1.83 [157] for the purpose of creating a
dendrogram. This analysis creates a putative model for
how the individual sub-groups of each PPIase family may
have diverged from one another based on relationships
between their individual sequences, which allow us to
infer a putative model for their evolution in the fungi
compared here. As each orthology group should share a
more recent common ancestor with themselves than with
the other PPIases they should cluster together in the MSA
[148] and therefore within the dendrogram, ideally as an
individual branch with a distinct common ancestor.
Fourthly, literature analysis looking for prior publications
on the individual PPIases was performed which in some
cases has allowed putative function(s) to be assigned to
orthology groups.
