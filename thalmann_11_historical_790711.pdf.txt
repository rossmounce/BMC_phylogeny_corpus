changes in western gorilla populations

Abstract
Background: Today many large mammals live in small, fragmented populations, but it is often unclear whether
this subdivision is the result of long-term or recent events. Demographic modeling using genetic data can
estimate changes in long-term population sizes while temporal sampling provides a way to compare genetic
variation present today with that sampled in the past. In order to better understand the dynamics associated with
the divergences of great ape populations, these analytical approaches were applied to western gorillas (Gorilla
gorilla) and in particular to the isolated and Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla subspecies (G. g. diehli).
Results: We used microsatellite genotypes from museum specimens and contemporary samples of Cross River
gorillas to infer both the long-term and recent population history. We find that Cross River gorillas diverged from
the ancestral western gorilla population ~17,800 years ago (95% HDI: 760, 63,245 years). However, gene flow
ceased only ~420 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 16,256 years), followed by a bottleneck beginning ~320 years ago (95%
HDI: 200, 2,825 years) that caused a 60-fold decrease in the effective population size of Cross River gorillas. Direct
comparison of heterozygosity estimates from museum and contemporary samples suggests a loss of genetic
variation over the last 100 years.
Conclusions: The composite history of western gorillas could plausibly be explained by climatic oscillations
inducing environmental changes in western equatorial Africa that would have allowed gorilla populations to
expand over time but ultimately isolate the Cross River gorillas, which thereafter exhibited a dramatic population
size reduction. The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to
increasing anthropogenic pressure over the last several hundred years. Isolation of diverging populations with
prolonged concomitant gene flow, but not secondary admixture, appears to be a typical characteristic of the
population histories of African great apes, including gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos.

Background
How species form and change over time is one of the
central preoccupations of evolutionary biology (e.g
[1,2]). Many species exist today in distinct populations
whose size and interconnectivity have changed over
time, in response to both recent and ancient climate
changes and human activities. New advances in the analysis of patterns of genetic variation found in contemporary populations allow the disentanglement of the
combined effects of these forces to reveal the recent and

long-term histories of those populations. Population histories, including the timing of population divergences,
the direction and extent of migration and estimates of
effective population sizes, can be effectively inferred
using explicit modeling approaches based upon coalescent theory (e.g. [3]).
These approaches combine information from neutrally-evolving loci sampled across the genome and
employ models that can allow for a variety of population
divergence scenarios. The classic allopatric model of
speciation suggests that new species form when populations become isolated from one another [4]. However,
subdivision of species or populations may not happen
abruptly or completely, and divergence can occur even
while some degree of gene flow may continue. Models

of isolation that incorporate migration must, therefore,
also be tested [5]. In addition, gene flow, even among
evolutionarily divergent lineages, is routine at the contact zones of many taxa including lizards, ungulates and
primates (e.g., baboons [6,7], macaques [8]), with convincing evidence even suggesting that some species
arose from hybridization of two different species [9,10].
Hence, other speciation models also allow for the possibility of resumption of gene flow following population
divergence.
In order to gain an appreciation for the tempo, mode,
timings and ultimate causes of species and population
divergences, it is advisable to first focus on representatives of a group of closely related species in order to
uncover general trends. As our closest living relatives,
the African great apes are particularly fascinating and
have been well-studied in the past. For example, the closely-related chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo
(Pan paniscus) species are suggested to have diverged
some 1.5 million years ago (mya), and, not surprisingly
given their long-term separation by the formidable barrier of the Congo River, there are no signs of recent
gene flow between the species, although ancient gene
flow was likely [11,12]. The three regional populations
or subspecies of chimpanzees diverged on the order of
half a million years ago, but the eastern and central
populations exchange migrants at appreciable rates,
while recent unidirectional migration from western to
central chimpanzees is also inferred [12,13]. The central
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) population is
suggested to be the ancestral population of all chimpanzees based on the findings of its larger effective population size and signals of population bottlenecks
associated with the divergence of the other subspecies
[12]. Overall, the Pan species and chimpanzee subspecies appear to have evolved following processes of isolation, limited migration, and population expansions.
Like chimpanzees, gorillas occur in central equatorial
Africa but are somewhat less widespread. The contemporary distribution of gorillas features a pronounced gap
of several hundred kilometers between western gorillas
(Gorilla gorilla) and eastern gorillas (G. beringei)
(Figure 1), yet these two species retain behavioral and
morphological similarities and were until recently considered subspecies of the same species [14,15]. In previous
work, we inferred from genetic data that the initial population divergence of western and eastern gorillas might
have occurred approximately 0.9-1.6 mya [16], but that
gene flow in both directions had persisted until as
recently as 78,000 years ago [17]. Whereas these studies
contributed to our understanding of the evolutionary history of gorillas on an interspecific level, little is known
about population size changes in the past and the intraspecific evolutionary dynamics of gorilla populations.

to western lowland gorillas and Gorilla gorilla diehli to Cross River
gorillas. East African gorillas are divided into Gorilla beringei beringei,
also known as mountain gorillas and Gorilla beringei graueri, known
as eastern lowland gorillas.

Intriguingly, a recent survey of skull and dental morphology of museum specimens suggested that some observed
craniofacial anomalies may represent the outcome of secondary admixture between separate populations in both
western and eastern gorillas, but this scenario has not yet
been explicitly tested with genetic data [18]. While analyses of genetic data from great apes tend to favor population histories featuring isolation with migration rather
than secondary introgression, such admixture is suspected to play a role in the evolution of various old world
monkey taxa [19] as well as in the recent history of modern humans and Neanderthals [20].
The focus of this study is a comprehensive assessment
of the evolutionary histories of the broadly distributed
population of western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) and
the range restricted, Critically Endangered Cross River
gorillas (G. g. diehli). The current census population size
of western lowland gorillas is on the order of tens of
thousands (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™). In
contrast, Cross River gorillas consist of approximately
200-300 individuals in fragmented populations in a highland region on the Nigeria-Cameroon border [21]. Previous genetic analyses of Cross River gorillas using
multiple autosomal microsatellite loci applied to DNA
derived from non-invasively collected fecal samples suggested a recent and/or severe population decrease [22].
Here we build upon this work by using DNA obtained
from museum specimens to directly compare the genetic
diversity observed today with that existing approximately
100 years ago. We next employ a highly efficient coalescent-based approach that takes advantage of both our
temporal sampling scheme and use of multiple independently-evolving loci. This allows us to reconstruct the

evolutionary relationship of Cross River and western lowland gorillas by estimating the time of their divergence,
the occurrence and duration of gene flow between them,
and their current and ancestral effective population sizes.
To evaluate different evolutionary scenarios we specifically test two alternative models, one of which allows for
divergence in the presence of gene flow [23] while the
other encompasses a secondary admixture scenario by
permitting divergence in isolation and subsequent
resumption of genetic exchange or admixture between
the two populations [18].

Results and Discussion
Recent changes in genetic diversity

In order to assess the patterns of genetic diversity within
and between two temporally spaced Cross River gorilla
population samples, we generated microsatellite genotypes
for 14 approximately 100-year-old Cross River museum
specimens (Additional file 1: Table S1) and compared
these data with published results from 71 non-invasively
collected contemporary Cross River gorillas [24].
The low concentration and fragmented nature of DNA
extracted from sources such as fecal samples or historical remains can lead to inaccurate microsatellite genotyping through the stochastic nonamplification of an
allele at a heterozygous locus (’allelic dropout’) or consistent nonamplification of an allele due to mutations at
a priming site (’null alleles’) [25,26]. Such errors can
potentially bias conclusions concerning a population’s
genetic diversity or demographic history. We found no
evidence of problems with any of the loci amplified in
the historical samples, while two loci in the published
modern Cross River data set potentially contained null
alleles. This suggestion of null alleles disappeared when
sampling localities were considered and the pattern was
attributed to the existence of genetic structure in contemporary Cross River gorillas [24]. The analyses presented here provide further evidence for this conclusion.
For instance, patterns of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) and linkage disequilibrium differed between the
two data sets. Specifically, three loci from the modern
data set (D5S1470, D7S817, D8S1106) deviated significantly from HWE in a locus-wise probability test, a test
that was also highly significant when performed across
all loci (corrected p < 0.001). Furthermore, the modern
Cross River samples approached a significant ‘deficit of
heterozygotes’ when using a global test over all loci
(corrected p = 0.071). Significant linkage disequilibrium
was observed for 14 of the 28 locus by locus comparisons in the modern data set (corrected p < 0.0042), but
for none of the loci in the historical data, when corrected for multiple testing. In addition, although not statistically significant, the mean observed heterozygosity
(Ho) was higher in the historical dataset than the modern

Page 3 of 10

one (0.732 and 0.631, respectively) and F IS values
increased from -0.05 in the historical to a significant
0.072 in the contemporary sample (SI: Tables S2 and S3).
In summary, these results are most readily explained by a
Wahlund effect due to pooling of the samples from the
structured, contemporary population [27].
The average expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.701 and
0.679 for the historical and contemporary samples, respectively (SI: Table S2). Because the sample sizes differed, we
resampled 14 genotypes from the contemporary samples
10,000 times and estimated mean H e . We obtained a
higher or equal mean He than observed in the historical
sample in only 10.6% of the cases. Consistent with this
result we observed a trend towards higher allelic richness
in the historical samples compared to the modern samples
in five of eight loci (SI: Table S3). A test for population differentiation assuming the same distribution of alleles
within the two populations approached significance (p =
0.063), and is in agreement with the low FST value (FST =
0.0071, p = 0.199). In sum, the lack of statistical significance of the comparisons of the standard summary statistics may reflect low power due to the limited number of
samples and loci, while the tendency towards higher variation in the past may reflect genetic drift or a population
size decrease in the Cross River gorillas over the last
100 years, a finding that has been observed in other large
mammals such as whales and orangutans and is usually
attributed to increasing anthropogenic pressure [28,29].
Temporal estimates of effective population sizes

Estimates of a population’s effective size (Ne) - the size
of an idealized Wright-Fisher population [30,31] resulting in the same genetic variability as observed in the
population examined [32] - highlight the strength of
genetic drift acting on the genetic variation and is considered in assessments of a population’s viability [33].
We used multiple analytical approaches to estimate the
effective population sizes of the Cross River gorillas.
First we used short-term estimators based on the
changes in allele frequencies over the last hundred
years. Two such moment estimators of Ne yielded values
of 221 and 276, while a pseudo-likelihood estimator produced a similar value of 244 (Table 1).
As complex models use more information, it has been
suggested that likelihood- and coalescence-based methods may outperform moment estimators of effective
population sizes in precision and accuracy [34,35]. Our
Ne estimates derived from two probabilistic approaches
yielded substantially higher values of 1,626 and 1,142
(Table 1). However, complex coalescence-based models
are highly dependent on underlying assumptions. The
apparent discrepancy between the various Ne estimators
might be aggravated by the complexity of gorillas’ life
history and demography and potentially reflect

deviations from a standard Wright-Fischer model. One
of the most unrealistic assumptions is that of panmixia in
the focal population, a situation rarely applicable to social
animals. Second, the assumption of discrete generations is
often violated due to the existence of age-structured, social
groups containing several overlapping generations. This is
especially the case in great apes, where closely related individuals (parent-offspring pairs) are found together in one
group and dispersal distances are likely limited [36,37]. In
sum, our results are consistent with the varied sensitivities
of Ne estimators and confirm the utility of comparing
results from multiple estimators [38] or using modeling
approaches to infer demographic histories.
Demographic simulations and gorilla population histories

In order to investigate the deeper demographic history
of Cross River gorillas we compared two potential
demographic scenarios: a divergence with secondary

admixture model and a model of isolation with migration (Figure 2). Both models allowed for a severe, recent
population decline in the Cross River population and
incorporated contemporary and museum samples
appropriately.
It has recently been suggested that the existence of
genetic structure in a population might generate “spurious” bottleneck signals in demographic simulations
[39-41]. This erroneous inference can be understood
by considering the coalescent process in a subdivided
population. As shown by [42], the coalescence process
may be divided into two distinct phases: During the
“scattering phase”, lineages either coalesce or migrate
quickly to demes other than those being sampled, until
there is a single lineage left per deme. In the “collecting phase”, the remaining lineages follow a standard
coalescence process, like in a single population, but on
a different time scale. If many samples are drawn from
the same deme, the rate of coalescent events in the
scattering phase is large, resulting in a genealogy that
will look much like that expected after a recent bottleneck [5,39]. Since we found limited population structure in the contemporary sample, only one haplotype
per sampled individual was considered in all our
demographic simulations. This effectively reduces the
number of alleles sampled from the same deme and
thus reduces the potential bias in our inference.
Despite the resulting reduced sample size we could
safely reject the secondary admixture model in favor of
the model of isolation with migration (log10Bayes factor ~ 22) (Figure 3).

We next estimated parameters of the preferred isolation with migration model, including the timing of
divergence between the Cross River and western lowland gorillas, timing of cessation of gene flow between
these populations, onset of population size changes and
the contemporary and ancestral effective population
sizes (Figure 2A).
The effective size of the ancestral population of Cross
River and western lowland gorillas was estimated at
2,547 (95% HDI: 500, 7,684; Figure 4 and Table 2). This
ancestral population may have diverged into Cross River
and western lowland gorillas at least 890 generations or
17,800 years ago (95% HDI: 760, 63,245 years). The
effective population size of the western lowland gorillas
subsequently increased approximately 9-fold to an estimated current day 22,376 (95% HDI: 12,879, 29,532).
The effective size of the ancestral Cross River gorilla
population was also large initially, probably caused by
an expansion in space and numbers but beginning at
about 320 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 2,825 years) it
decreased by approximately 60-fold to 271 (95% HDI:
122, 300). We observed a signature of substantial gene
flow between western and Cross River gorillas that continued after the initial divergence (2Nm ≈ 9.5 or roughly
4.5 individuals per generation) but ceased at around 21
generations or 420 years ago (95% HDI: 200, 16,256
years), at approximately the same time as the inferred
onset of the population bottleneck.
The large credibility intervals on our posterior parameters suggest that further investigations using more
loci or individuals may be useful to refine the demographic model. However, we rigorously validated our

inferences and found only slight biases for some of
the estimates (see SI: Supplementary Figure.3): an
overestimation of the current Cross River population
size, an underestimation of the divergence time and a
more global overestimation of the ancestral gorilla
population size over the entire parameter space. These
minor biases do not substantially influence our inferences, which are associated with large posterior density intervals but nonetheless reveal a strong recent
decrease in the effective size of the Cross River
population.
The current analysis contributes to a composite view
of gorilla population history based on genetic data
(Table 3). An initial split of western and eastern gorillas
about one million years ago was accompanied by bidirectional gene flow until as recently as 78,000 years ago
[17]. Some 17,800 (95% HDI 760, 63,245) years ago,
western lowland and Cross River gorillas diverged but
substantial gene flow between the two western gorilla
subspecies ceased only about 420 (95% HDI 200,
16,256) years ago. A marked decline of Cross River gorilla population size began only about a hundred years
later, resulting in a current estimated effective population size of 271 (95% HDI 122-300). Such a pronounced,
recent reduction in size accounts for the high concordance of effective population and census size as it
drastically reduces variation and prolongs gene coalescences. These demographic events, along with the signals of likely population structure in the ancestral
western gorilla population [17], are consistent with a
scenario of changing climate conditions over the last
tens of thousands of years that led to repeated expansion and contraction of forests, and hence of forestdwelling ape populations, as well as more recent
increased anthropogenic impact.
Africa’s climate during the late Pleistocene was characterized by oscillations of aridity and humidity leading
to a continuous cycle of forest expansion and contraction and the creation of forest refugia during arid phases
[43]. Patterns of genetic diversity in gorillas and other
mammals have been suggested to reflect the effects of
refugial fragmentation during the last glacial maximum
[44,45], and one such forest refugia has been suggested
to have existed in the Cross River area. Consequently,
the isolation of this region from other forest refugia in
western equatorial Africa might have promoted the
divergence of Cross River gorillas from their ancestral
population ~17,800 years ago. Although the mode estimate of the eventual cessation of gene flow between
western lowland and Cross River gorillas is rather
recent, its 95% HPD interval includes major climatic
changes in the region around 3,000-2,500 years ago that
led to increased aridity and the expansive replacement
of forests by grasslands [46,47].

population per generation since the onset of the bottleneck some 16 generations ago. Although this is a substantial decrease in size, other equatorial African gorilla
populations have been described to suffer even more
dramatic size reductions. In 2003, Walsh and colleagues
reported a 56% decline in the population size of gorillas
in Gabon over the last 20 years (or approximately a single generation) [50]. The authors concluded that the
cause of this severe population size crash is a synergism
between human activities, including hunting, habitat
loss due to deforestation and disease (see also [51]) and
strongly emphasized the need for effective and immediate conservation actions in order to ensure the longterm survival of gorilla populations.
Hunting of gorillas continues today and represents
one of the greatest threats to their persistence [21]. Particularly for small populations that may have gone
through recent reductions in size, effective enforcement
of anti-poaching laws and maintenance of existing habitat to allow the population to stabilize and expand is
crucial to their future survival [21]. While such

In addition to climate change, human activities have
likely had an increasing impact upon the Cross River
gorillas in recent times. Initial settlement of the northwestern region of Cameroon by Bantu agriculturalists
has been estimated to have coincided with contraction
of forests in the region and occurred as early as
2,500 years ago [47]. Aside from habitat destruction,
hunting is another anthropogenic threat that has likely
caused the apparent population size decrease of Cross
River gorillas over the last centuries. Firearms were
introduced to the region beginning in the 18th century
and increased in both numbers and sophistication starting in the mid to late 19 th century [48]. Additionally,
beginning in the late 19th century, the region underwent
a rapid growth in human population density, increasing
tenfold between 1900 and 2000 [49]. These two factors
together almost certainly created a significant intensification of hunting pressure on large mammals like gorillas [21,22]. Notably, the inferred population size
decrease in the history of Cross River gorillas by a factor
of ~60 translates into a loss of ~23% of the gorilla

measures will facilitate the short-term survival of Cross
River gorillas, the impact of reduced levels of genetic
diversity on their long-term viability remains unclear.
The weak signal for loss of genetic variation in the
Cross River gorilla population is consistent with the
recent population bottleneck we identified, as the number of generations elapsed may not yet have been sufficient to significantly reduce levels of heterozygosity or
allelic richness. The relatively short duration but dramatic severity of the bottleneck also explains the concordance between estimated census population size and
our estimates of Ne, which often differ by up to a factor
of ten in wildlife populations [31]. Given this relationship between N and Ne, it is possible that if the population were allowed to expand, the loss of diversity could
be arrested [e.g., 29].

Conclusion
This work builds upon previous studies of the evolutionary relationships between western and eastern gorilla
species [17], between Pan species [11], and among
chimpanzee subspecies [12] in showing the prevalence
of long-term post-divergence gene flow in African ape
population histories. It is further apparent that African
ape populations were subject to changes in size in the
past, with evidence for both size decreases and expansions, and these are likely linked to changes in habitat
caused by climate oscillations during the Pleistocene. It
is plausible that habitat changes might also facilitate secondary introgression of already divergent populations,
and human mediated habitat fragmentation has been
invoked to explain numerous cases of secondary admixture in old world monkeys [19]. However, we find no
support in our data for the postulated recent occurrence
of secondary admixture of western lowland and Cross
River gorillas [18]. Instead, we find that gene flow
accompanied the divergence of western lowland and
Cross River gorillas until just 400 or so years ago, which
rather supports a scenario in which intensifying human

activities may have increased the isolation of ape populations. The lack of a signal of secondary admixture in
African apes is in notable contrast to the recent finding
of substantive levels of introgression between the extinct
Neanderthals and modern humans who were ancestral
to populations found outside of Africa [20].
Coalescence-based approaches to inferring population
histories using genetic data can reveal complex patterns
of isolation with persistent migration or secondary contact that are difficult to reconcile with a view of evolutionary relationships as bifurcating processes that can be
represented in a tree-like form. These results, along
with earlier work on the patterns of morphological and
phylogenetic relationships among baboon taxa, emphasize the challenges inherent to applying subspecies and
species designations to dynamic entities like populations
of organisms [7,52].

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction and genotyping

Thirty-five gorilla specimens from the Cross River
region on the border of Cameroon and Nigeria were
obtained from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin,
Germany. Twenty-six of the samples came from Ossidinge, a former missionary station located on the Cross
River in Cameroon (5°15’ - 6°15’ N and 8°50’ - 9°50’ E;
[53]). Although collected on expeditions in 1904-1907,
some of these skulls were apparently obtained from
local people and thus might have been older but not
substantially so. The collection was transferred to Berlin
in the early 1900s and stored at the Museum of Natural
History since then.
Approximately 150 mg segments of tooth roots were
extracted in physically-isolated laboratories dedicated to
ancient DNA work following the protocol suggested in
[54]. We first assessed whether we had recovered amplifiable nuclear DNA by attempting to amplify three autosomal microsatellites as well as a segment of the
amelogenin gene in separate standard PCR reactions
(see SI). The 14 samples for which at least two loci successfully amplified were then processed in a two-step
multiplex approach [55] using the three original and five
additional microsatellites (see SI).
Genotypes from 71 contemporary gorillas were generated using non-invasively collected fecal samples. The
data from the Cross River population came from a previously published dataset [24]. For the demographic
simulations we used genotypes from 92 western gorillas
(Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (11 Cameroonian described in
[17] and 81 from Gabon [56]). We included individuals
from several locations in order to recover the genetic
variation present in extant western gorillas. The data
used from published work [17,24,56] employed noninvasive fecal samples from contemporary gorillas, collected

in accordance with all relevant governmental guidelines
and so further permissions were not necessary for the
study presented here.
Data analysis

We previously estimated the amount of repetition
necessary to produce genotypes significantly likely to be
free of errors due to allelic dropout or spurious alleles
[55]. An individual genotype was considered to be confirmed when a homozygous allele was detected in at
least six independent multiplex PCR replicates or when
each of two apparently heterozygous alleles was
observed in at least two multiplex PCR replicates [55].
Summary statistics were calculated as outlined in the
Supplementary Information. We furthermore investigated whether or not individual loci in both the historical and the modern Cross River gorilla dataset show
evidence for null alleles, small allele dominance (allelic
dropout) or mis-scoring due to stuttering by using the
program MICROCHECKER v2.2.3 [57].
We applied a randomization strategy in order to assess
whether there was a significant difference in levels of
genetic variation in the historical samples relative to the
modern ones. We randomly drew a sample equal in size
to the historical gorilla sample from the modern gorilla
genotypes, and repeated this 10,000 times and computed
the average expected heterozygosity (He ) over all loci
which provides an unbiased estimate. We evaluated the
significance level by estimating the percentage of resampling steps that provided a higher or equal H e than
observed in the historical Cross River gorilla population.
An alternative approach of assessing levels of genetic
variation while accounting for different sample sizes [58]
is provided by allelic richness measurements as calculated with FSTAT v.2.9.3.2. We also used this program
to calculate F IS values [59] in order to estimate the
probability of allelic identity due to population substructure or potential inbreeding.
Effective population size

To generate short-term estimates of the effective population size (N e ), we assumed that Cross River gorillas
constitute an isolated population during the time
spanned by our sampling (100 years). In general all
models follow the same basic assumptions: the focal
population is expected to be in panmixia, discrete generations exist and mutation, selection and migration
are negligible compared to genetic drift, thus representing a simplified Wright-Fisher population [30,31].
Short-term Ne estimators are based on the variance of
allele frequency changes over time and hence provide
a harmonic mean of N e for the time elapsed between
the two sampling periods (for comprehensive reviews
see [60]).

We calculated two moment estimators, one using the
program MNE 1.0 [61,62] and applying Nei and
Tajima’s sampling scheme 1 [62]. The authors suggested
two exclusive sampling schemes: plan 1 assumes that
gene sampling happened after reproduction from a
population in which census size approximates the effective size; plan 2 instead is based on the assumption that
the sampled individuals do not contribute to the next
generation and the census size is much larger than Ne.
The second moment estimator was calculated according
to Waples’ formula [63] also adopting Nei and Tajima’s
sampling plan 1. As simulations have shown that
moment estimators may suffer from imprecision and
overestimation of Ne (e.g. [35]) whenever genetic drift is
strong and genetic markers with high diversities are
used, we accompanied these two moment estimators
with three probabilistic ones. We used a pseudolikelihood approach [61] as implemented in MNE 1.0
that also applies Nei and Tajima’s sampling plan 1 but
reduces multiallelic loci into a biallelic state by choosing
one and pooling all other alleles, respectively. A second
approach that utilizes the full allele spectra for multiallelic markers is based on a Monte Carlo evaluation to
compute the likelihood of Ne given the data and adopting sampling plan 2 according to Nei and Tajima
(CoNe; [34,64]). Finally, we used a Bayesian approach
coupled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations
that is based on the approximation of the gene genealogy by the coalescence principle and not the population
gene frequency as in [64] (tm3.1; [34]). The authors
implemented sampling plan 2 into their model.
When using these probabilistic approaches we commonly applied a prior Ne-max of 3,000 and minimum
run time of one million steps.
Demographic inferences

We first assumed an evolutionary model in which the
Cross River population diverged from the western gorilla
population Tdivergence generations ago (Figure 2A). The
two populations exchanged Nm migrants per generation
until Tmigration generations ago with Tmigration ≤ Tdivergence. The effective population sizes of the ancestral gorilla population (Nancestral) and western lowland gorillas
(Nwestern) after the divergence of the Cross River population are assumed to be constant but are allowed to be
different. The effective size of the Cross River population Ncrossriver_old is also assumed to be constant until
T bottleneck generations when an exponential decrease
began lasting until today and finally reducing the effective population size to Ncrossriver_now. All microsatellite
loci were simulated assuming a stepwise mutation
model with mutation rate μ with a prior distribution N
(0.0004, 0.0001) truncated at 0.0002 and 0.0006 [12,65].
All prior distributions used for this model are given in

Thalmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:85
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/85

Table 2 and the effective sizes are based on existing
knowledge on the census size of the current Cross River
population (< 300 individuals) or published estimates
for western gorillas [13,17].
We also considered an alternative scenario, wherein
the Cross River and the western gorillas did not
exchange any migrants after their initial divergence.
However, at a given time in the past (Tadmixture) a fraction of the Cross River population (g admixture ) was
replaced by immigrants from the western gorillas (Figure 2B) and thus mirroring a hybridization scenario. For
parameters common to both models we used the same
prior distributions (Table 2). The prior distributions of
Tadmixture, Tmigration and the prior distribution on (gadmixture) were chosen uniform within (0,1).
We used the software Serial SimCoal [66], a modified
version of the program SimCoal [67], specifically
designed to simulate temporally-spaced samples using a
coalescent framework. The simulated data were then
implemented in an Approximate Bayesian Computations
framework (ABC) [68] in order to estimate parameters
of the above model. We extended a methodology
recently introduced and described in detail [69] to take
the independence of the K studied loci explicitly into
account (SI). This allowed us to reduce the necessary
computations to a fraction of 1/K since we simulated a
single locus rather than the complete set of observed
loci, as was done previously. We successfully validated
our approach (SI) using the methodology introduced in
[39]. However, due to the low number of loci we report
slight biases for some of our estimates: overestimation
of N crossriver_now , underestimation of T divergence and a
more global overestimation of Nancestral over the entire
parameter space. Model comparison was performed
using Bayes factors as described in [69], but adapted to
the case of independent loci (SI).
Our inference relied upon the following summary statistics computed on the observed and simulated microsatellite loci: the variance in repeat length within each
population and the difference in mean repeat length
between all pairs of populations. We assumed a recently
refined gorilla generation time of 20 years (IUCN Red
List of Threatened Species™) and thus the historical
samples were collected five generations before present.
