Abstract
Background: The genetic contribution to stroke is well established but it has proven difficult to identify the genes and the
disease-associated alleles mediating this effect, possibly because only nuclear genes have been intensely investigated so far.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been implicated in several disorders having stroke as one of its clinical manifestations. The
aim of this case-control study was to assess the contribution of mtDNA polymorphisms and haplogroups to ischemic stroke risk.
Methods: We genotyped 19 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defining the major European haplogroups in 534
ischemic stroke patients and 499 controls collected in Portugal, and tested their allelic and haplogroup association with ischemic
stroke risk.
Results: Haplogroup H1 was found to be significantly less frequent in stroke patients than in controls (OR = 0.61, 95% CI =
0.45–0.83, p = 0.001), when comparing each clade against all other haplogroups pooled together. Conversely, the pre-HV/HV
and U mtDNA lineages emerge as potential genetic factors conferring risk for stroke (OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 1.41–7.01, p = 0.003,
and OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.13–7.28, p = 0.021, respectively). SNPs m.3010G>A, m.7028C>T and m.11719G>A strongly
influence ischemic stroke risk, their allelic state in haplogroup H1 corroborating its protective effect.
Conclusion: Our data suggests that mitochondrial haplogroup H1 has an impact on ischemic stroke risk in a Portuguese sample.

Background
Stroke is a complex disorder resulting from the interplay
of genetics and environment, and genes potentially having an impact on disease pathogenesis (e.g. genes
involved in hemostasis), intermediate phenotypes (e.g.
atherosclerosis) or clinical risk factors (e.g. blood pressure
regulation) have been tested for association with stroke
risk [1]. Mostly nuclear genes have been intensively investigated thus far, while the role of the mitochondrial
genome has been neglected. Mitochondria are extranuclear organelles whose primary function is the production
of ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) respiratory chain. They also play a decisive
role in intracellular signaling, metabolic pathways such as
Krebs' or tricarboxylic acid cycle and the metabolism of
amino acids, lipids, cholesterol and steroids. Mitochondrial function is required for normal vascular cell growth
and function, and its dysfunction can result in apoptosis,
favoring atherosclerotic plaque rupture. mtDNA is maternally inherited, does not recombine and exhibits high
mutation and fixation rates, therefore making it an important tool in phylogenetics. Human mtDNA is a haploid,
circular molecule of approximately 16,600 nucleotides
encoding for thirteen OXPHOS polypeptides, twenty-two
transfer RNAs and two ribosomal RNAs (Figure 1) [2].
Particular combinations of certain polymorphisms define
mitochondrial haplogroups and subclades (Table 1),
which tend to be associated to broad geographic areas
and/or populations [3].
Particular variants of the mitochondrial genome have
been linked to aging [4,5], the strongest risk factor for
stroke, and to several neurological and vascular disorders.
Among the best-known examples of a mitochondrial disorder is that of MELAS (MIM: 540000), a mitochondrial

encephalopathy characterized by lactic acidosis and
stroke-like episodes. This syndrome is caused by the
m.3243A>G mutation, an A to G transition at mtDNA
nucleotide position 3243 [6,7]. Leber's hereditary optic
neuropathy (LHON, MIM: 535000), a vascular disease of
the optic disc, is also caused by mtDNA mutations that
lead to respiratory chain dysfunction [8]. Interestingly, the
phylogenetic background of haplogroup J influences the
clinical penetrance and expression of the m.11778G>A
and m.14484T>C primary LHON mutations [9,10]. This
exemplifies how, although defined on the basis of evolutionarily neutral polymorphisms, common mtDNA variation of phylogenetic relevance assumes a functional role
on the expression of particular complex traits. mtDNA
variation has been associated with non-Mendelian and
non-maternally inherited complex disorders such as Parkinson's disease [11], Alzheimer's disease [12], myocardial infarction [13], obesity [14], occipital stroke in
migraine [15,16], and mean intima-media thickness of
bilateral carotid arteries [17]. Increased mitochondrial
oxidative stress and dysfunction has been linked to many
ischemic stroke risk factors, including hypertension [18],
diabetes [19], inflammation [20], plaque rupture [20],
tobacco smoke and alcohol exposure [21]. The goal of the
present study was to determine whether mtDNA SNPs or
haplogroups predispose to ischemic stroke in a large
cohort of Portuguese patients and controls.

Methods
Study subjects
Five hundred thirty four unrelated patients with a clinical
diagnosis of ischemic stroke, who were under the age of
65 at stroke onset, were recruited through Neurology and
Internal Medicine Departments throughout Portugal.
Stroke was defined by the presence of a new focal neuro-

logical deficit, with an acute onset and symptoms and
signs persisting for more than 24 hours, and was confirmed by Computed Tomography Scan (97% of cases)
and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (in 25% of patients)
[22]. All patients were seen and all neuroradiology tests
were reviewed by study neurologists. Trauma, tumors,
infection and other causes of neurological deficit were
excluded.
Data collection forms were developed for this study that
included extensive clinical information such as stroke
characteristics, general clinical observation, neurological
symptoms and signs, complications and interventions
during hospitalization and situation at discharge. Data
was also collected on relevant lifestyle aspects and previous clinical risk factors.
Four hundred ninety nine unrelated healthy individuals
were included in this study as a control sample population. Since stroke is a late-onset disease, the control group
was selected from a group of healthy volunteers with a
higher mean age than the case group, thus minimizing the
chances for mis-classification as "stroke-free". Control
individuals were verified to be free of stroke by direct
interview before recruitment, but no brain imaging studies were performed. The interview also included questions
on established clinical and life-style risk factors for stroke.
The principal demographic and clinical characteristics
and frequency of risk factors of this study sample are
shown in Table 2. The research protocol was approved by
the ethics committees of participating institutions, and
participants were informed of the study and provided
informed consent.
SNP selection and haplogroup definition
We studied nineteen mtDNA SNPs (Figure 1 and Table 1)
of phylogenetic relevance for classifying the Portuguese
mitochondrial haplogroup variation which includes the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/57

most prevalent West Eurasian haplogroups (H, H1, V, preHV/HV, J, J1b, T, U, U4, U5, K1, I, X2b, and W), as well as
some African haplogroups (U6a and L) more frequent in
Portugal and in the Iberian Peninsula than in other European countries [23,24]. Haplogroups and their subclades,
which show different frequencies and distributions in
human populations, are defined by the combination of
multiple markers (Table 1), embracing the information
from the whole set of branches of the mtDNA tree rather
than the status at any single point mutation. The nomenclature of clades follows Torroni et al. [25], Richards et al.
[26], and Macaulay et al. [27]. The "Other" haplogroup
category in Table 3 (19 controls and 20 patients) includes
individuals whose haplogroups could not be assigned to
the clades in Table 1.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples
using the NucleoSpin Blood XL kit (Macherey-Nagel;
Düren, Germany) or a salting out procedure. SNPs were
genotyped using Sequenom's iPlex assay (primer extension of multiplex products with detection by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry) following manufacturer's protocol and
detected in a Sequenom MassArray K2 platform. The
primer sequences are available upon request and were
designed using Sequenom's (San Diego, USA) MassARRAY® Assay Design 3.0 software according to the Cambridge reference sequence [2]. Extensive quality control
was performed using eight HapMap controls of diverse
ethnic affiliation, sample duplication within and across
plates, non-Mendelian maternal inheritance check in
three large pedigrees, and a minimum of 90% call rate.
Genotype determinations were performed blinded to
affection status. 0.2% of all calls were heterozygous, most
likely due to mtDNA heteroplasmy, and these were not
included in the analyses.

*Given that the "Other" class includes an assortment of lineages not phylogeneticaly correlated, association tests were not performed.

Statistical analysis
An unpaired Student's t test and a χ2 test were used to
compare quantitative and qualitative clinical and demographic data, respectively, between cases and controls. χ2
tests were performed to explore the association of each
mtDNA SNP and haplogroup with stroke risk. For haplogroup analyses, we compared each haplogroup with all
other haplogroups pooled together. To adjust the association analysis for confounding factors, age-at-examination,
hypertension, diabetes and ever smoking were included as
covariates in multivariate logistic regression with backward elimination of risk factors. The interaction i among
covariates in regression models was not strong (-0.5 <i <
0.5). Logistic regressions were performed using the R freeware [28]. Odds ratios (ORs) and their associated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were uncorrected for confounding variables in the χ2 tests and corrected for covariates in
regression models. Results were considered significant
below the conventional level of 0.05. Since some of the
markers are in linkage disequilibrium and the haplogroup
comparisons are not independent, we did not perform
corrections for multiple testing and uncorrected p-values
are reported.

Results
Table 2 shows the general characteristics of our dataset.
Since stroke is a very common late-onset disorder, we
chose to have the control group significantly older than

the case group to minimize misclassification biases of
control individuals. Male to female ratio, hypertension,
diabetes, ever smoking, and ever drinking were significantly higher in ischemic stroke patients than in controls,
and the effects of these potentially confounding variables
were accounted for in the multivariate logistic regressions
with backward elimination of risk factors. Our group of
patients has a similar risk factor profile than previously
described older groups of ischemic stroke cases with similar male to female ratios [29,30], and therefore can be
considered representative of the general ischemic stroke
population.
The mtDNA haplogroup distribution in the control group
(Table 3) was in agreement with previously published
data on a similar Portuguese normal population [23,24],
with 8.3–9.9% of the individuals having mtDNA haplogroups characteristic of African populations (L and U6).
With the genotyped SNPs, a haplogroup could not be
assigned to an almost equal percentage of individuals in
the control and patient groups (3.8 and 3.7%, respectively, classified as "Others" in Table 3), which again is in
concordance with other studies using equivalent
approaches [11,31]. These individuals have either an
ambiguous SNP-profile or belong to rare Eurasian haplogroups (e.g. R, Z, M). The fact that L, U6, and "Others"
haplogroup categories are present in equivalent proportions in cases (12.0%) and controls (10.8%) (Table 3) fur-

ther suggests that our dataset was well matched for
ethnicity and lacks significant substructure.

Conversely, the pre-HV/HV, also known as R0 [32] (χ2
test OR = 3.14, 95%CI = 1.41–7.01, p = 0.003; logistic
regression OR = 4.68; 95%CI = 1.51–14.54, p = 0.008),
and U (χ2 test OR = 2.87, 95%CI = 1.13–7.28, p = 0.021;
logistic regression OR = 4.01, 95%CI = 1.08–14.90, p =
0.038) mtDNA lineages emerge as potential genetic factors conferring risk for stroke (Figure 2 and Table 3). The
relatively rare U5 sub-clade and its defining polymorphism m.13617T>C showed a trend for association with
stroke risk only with the logistic regression test (OR =
2.17, 95%CI = 1.01–4.67, p = 0.048, and OR = 2.18;
95%CI = 1.01–4.70, p = 0.047, respectively).

Results of crude and adjusted association analyses of
mitochondrial haplogroups are shown in Figure 2 and
Table 3, and those of single-markers are presented in Figure 3 and Table 4. Sub-haplogroup H1 was found to be
significantly less frequent in ischemic stroke patients than
in controls when comparing each clade against all others
pooled together (χ2 test OR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.45–0.83, p
= 0.001); when significant risk factors were included in
the model as covariates (age-at-examination, hypertension, diabetes and ever smoking), the association
remained significant (logistic regression OR = 0.57,
95%CI = 0.38–0.85, p = 0.007). The sub-haplogroup H1
is thus protective for ischemic stroke in this dataset. SNPs
m.3010G>A, m.7028C>T and m.11719G>A, which
together define H1, were found to consistently influence
the risk for ischemic stroke in both the uncorrected χ2 test
and the logistic regression model, their allelic state in H1
corroborating its protective effect. Stratification by sex
revealed that the crude association of haplogroup H1 is
quite consistent among males (OR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.43–
0.98, p = 0.038) and females (OR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.37–
0.93, p = 0.021), even though it did not reach significance
in females when adjusted for co-variates (Figure 2), most
likely due to the small sample size.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive association study of mtDNA variation with ischemic
stroke risk in an European population. In a large population sample of ethnically-matched cases and controls, we
found that haplogroup H1 is protective while haplogroups pre-HV/HV and U increase risk for ischemic stroke.
Since these haplogroups are defined by the combination
of several polymorphisms also present in other clades
(e.g. allele A of m.3010G>A is a phylogenetic marker of
subclades H1 and J1b), the observed haplogroup associations cannot be attributed to particular SNPs, but instead
to their precise arrangement. To exclude the possibility
that the observed associations are due to population stratification with study participants of African or non-West

sample size would be required to have a representative
number of individuals in each subtype and haplogroup
category. Stratification by sex was performed as there are
clear differences between male and female ischemic
patients [33], and some of the associations (e.g. adjusted
association of H1 in females) most likely did not reach
statistical significance due to the relatively small sample
sizes.

level of 0.001, and this association would survive a Bonferroni correction for the seventeen crude or adjusted
association tests performed for haplogroups, suggesting
that it is an important association. Much larger cohorts are
required for less common clades or finer changes in haplogroup frequency, and therefore the present study provides preliminary evidence of association that requires
further validation in independent cohorts.

Earlier studies have addressed the contribution of mtDNA
variation to stroke susceptibility. The m.12308A>G polymorphism defining haplogroups U and K, previously
associated with occipital stroke in migraine [15,16] and
suggested to increase the risk of developing stroke in
MELAS patients with the m.3243A>G mutation [34], was
not associated with ischemic stroke in our dataset. However, an association of the U5 subcluster with migrainous
stroke has been reported [16] and is consistent with our
tentative association of the U5 haplogroup and its defining m.13617T>C polymorphism with ischemic stroke.
m.5178C>A, associated with aging [4] and cerebrovascular disorders (cerebral hemorrhage or infarction) in a
small Japanese case-control sample [35] and with intimamedia thickness in carotid arteries of Japanese type 2 diabetic individuals [17], could not be investigated here as it
is Asian-specific [36]. Haplogroup A, unlike its defining
polymorphisms m.663A>G in the 12S rRNA gene and
m.8794C>T in the ATPase 6 gene, was recently found
associated with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction in
440 Japanese females after adjustement for significant covariates [37]. None of the three SNPs we studied in the
12S rRNA and ATPase 6 genes (m.709G>A, m.8701A>G,
and m.9055G>A) were associated with ischemic stroke,
suggesting that haplogroup A, but not its defining SNPs
individually or other SNPs in the same genes, may constitute a risk factor for stroke in Japanese. Finally, we did not
try to replicate the reported association with lacunar cerebral infarction of the m.16189T>C variant in the mtDNA
hypervariable region [38] as we only investigated SNPs in
the coding region and this polymorphism is not restricted
to any particular haplogroup [39,40]. These discrepancies
among reports highlight: i) the difficulty of finding reproducible mitochondrial genome associations with disease
due to the continent-specificity of some mtDNA SNPs and
clades, and ii) the necessity of performing association
studies in very large samples so that even uncommon haplogroups are represented by a sufficient number of individuals. A power analysis of mitochondrial haplogroup
association studies such as the present one (investigating
17 haplotypes) reveals that a sample of size similar to ours
(515 cases and 515 controls) only provides 50% power to
detect a change in haplogroup frequency from 0.251 in
controls to 0.17 in cases (as observed here for H1) at a significance level of 0.05 [41]. Even though we only had 50%
power, we detected an association of H1 at a significance

Although the polymorphisms that characterize the phylogeny are thought to be evolutionarily neutral, they may
cause subtle alterations in the encoded transcripts or proteins, which collectively and over time, influence the risk
of a stroke event. Given that stroke is mostly a late-onset
disorder, it does not affect the successful transmission of
mtDNA alleles and their fixation in the population. Additionally, several reports have documented the tissue-specific accumulation of mitochondrial deletions with aging
[42,43], and it is conceivable that mtDNA polymorphisms or haplogroups which are neutral under normal
circumstances become advantageous in post-mitotic tissues in the presence of acquired mutations.
The associated m.3010G>A non-coding polymorphism,
located in the conserved 3' end of the 16S rRNA gene, lies
near non-coding point mutations known to confer resistance to chloramphenicol, a prokaryotic and mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor [44]. The synonymous
m.7028C>T transition is located in the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I gene (COI) of complex IV. This protein complex is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory
chain, which collects electrons from reduced cytochrome
c and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, and consists of 13 polypeptide subunits, 3 of which are mtDNAencoded. m.11719G>A is a synonymous SNP in the ND4
gene. ND4 gene product is a subunit of the respiratory
complex I which accepts electrons from NADH, transfers
them to ubiquinone and uses the energy released to pump
protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. A
mutation in ND4 (m.11778G>A) causing an arginine to
histidine change at amino acid 340 [MIM 516003.0001]
accounts for over 50% and 90% of all LHON cases among
Caucasians and Asians, respectively. Interestingly, the
penetrance of this mutation is higher within a J haplogroup background, but its effect is most prominent on the
J2 subclade [8,9]. The physical proximity of the associated
polymorphism in ND4 to known mutations suggests that
it lies in or close to important functional domains and has
the potential to alter the protein's function.
It is interesting to notice that the majority of polymorphisms associated with stroke risk in the present report are
localized in complexes I and IV, whose deficiencies are the
most frequently observed abnormalities of the OXPHOS
system. It would be of great interest to assess if stroke

patients display complex I and IV deficits relative to
matched controls, prior to their first stroke, and to identify
phenotypic differences among haplogroups using transmitochondrial hybrid cell (cybrid) technology [45]. In
rats, a reduction in the aerobic capacity is concomitant
with a decrease in the amount of proteins required for
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in skeletal muscle, and with an increase in cardiovascular risk factors [46].
The ethiopathogenic complexity of stroke is paralleled by
that of mitochondrial disorders, probably in part due to
their dual genetic control (mitochondrial and nuclear)
and interplay with the environment. A small minority of
complex I to IV subunits are mtDNA-encoded and produced, while the majority of subunits are nuclear-encoded
and transported into the organelle. It is likely that mtDNA
polymorphisms and haplogroups act synergistically with
nuclear genetic factors and environmental components,
and therefore mtDNA-encoded gene/nuclear-encoded
gene and mtDNA-encoded gene/environment epistatic
interactions may explain a larger fraction of the ischemic
stroke heritability.

Conclusion
We found suggestive evidence for association of the mitochondrial haplogroup H1 with ischemic stroke. For a
deeper insight of the role of mtDNA variants in ischemic
stroke, the full-sequencing of the molecule and the replication of the same polymorphisms in a large, wellmatched, independent dataset are mandatory. If replicated in other populations, these influences on ischemic
stroke risk are a relevant matter of public health given that
haplogroups H1, pre-HV/HV, U, and U5 represent about
20% of the European population.
