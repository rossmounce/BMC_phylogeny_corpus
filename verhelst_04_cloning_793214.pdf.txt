Abstract
Background: The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains largely elusive, although some
microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, are suspected of playing a role in the etiology of this
disorder. Recently culture-independent analysis of microbial ecosystems has proven its efficacy in
characterizing the diversity of bacterial populations. Here, we report on the results obtained by
combining culture and PCR-based methods to characterize the normal and disturbed vaginal
microflora.
Results: A total of 150 vaginal swab samples from healthy women (115 pregnant and 35 nonpregnant) were categorized on the basis of Gram stain of direct smear as grade I (n = 112), grade
II (n = 26), grade III (n = 9) or grade IV (n = 3). The composition of the vaginal microbial community
of eight of these vaginal swabs (three grade I, two grade II and three grade III), all from non-pregnant
women, were studied by culture and by cloning of the 16S rRNA genes obtained after direct
amplification. Forty-six cultured isolates were identified by tDNA-PCR, 854 cloned 16S rRNA gene
fragments were analysed of which 156 by sequencing, yielding a total of 38 species, including 9
presumptively novel species with at least five species that have not been isolated previously from
vaginal samples. Interestingly, cloning revealed that Atopobium vaginae was abundant in four out of
the five non-grade I specimens. Finally, species specific PCR for A. vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis
pointed to a statistically significant co-occurrence of both species in the bacterial vaginosis samples.
Conclusions: Although historically the literature regarding bacterial vaginosis has largely focused
on G. vaginalis in particular, several findings of this study – like the abundance of A. vaginae in
disturbed vaginal microflora and the presence of several novel species – indicate that much is to be
learned about the composition of the vaginal microflora and its relation to the etiology of BV.

Background
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is considered to be the most common cause of vaginal inflammation among both pregnant
and non-pregnant women and prevalences between 4.9%
and 36.0% have been reported from European and American studies [1]. The etiology of this condition remains
largely unknown.
Nonetheless, the abundant literature, addressing bacterial
vaginosis and ascending genital tract infection, has largely
focused on the bacterial component and, in particular, on
a few microorganisms, which are thought to play a pivotal
role in the pathology of bacterial vaginosis. Although
probably rather complex microbial community dynamics
are involved, culture-dependent studies indicate that a
limited number of bacterial species, including Mobiluncus
spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp.
and Mycoplasma hominis, along with the relative absence of
Lactobacillus spp., can be used as a sensitive index for bacterial vaginosis. Consequently, according to Nugent et al.
[2], the standard diagnosis of BV relies on the quantification of only three cellular types (Lactobacillus, Gardnerella,
and Mobiluncus) on a Gram stained vaginal smear.
While conventional microbiological techniques are useful
as screening tools to identify women with BV, they do not
enable prediction of the clinical burden associated with
bacterial vaginosis. It has therefore been stated that better
understanding of the composition and dynamics of the
vaginal microflora along with the factors associated with
the pathology of bacterial vaginosis is essential to improve
our predictive abilities [1].
The analysis of complex bacterial communities has been
hampered by conventional culture-dependent methods
and by biochemical identification methods, since it leaves
many bacteria uncultured and unidentified. This may
prove especially true for vaginal microflora, both under
normal circumstances as well as in the setting of bacterial
vaginosis, a condition primarily characterized by overgrowth of anaerobic and fastidious microorganisms. For
example, until recently, several important species, like
Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and L. iners, were all
lumped together into the L. acidophilus complex, while
present molecular techniques make it possible to differentiate between these closely related species [3-9]. Here we
combined culture with tDNA-PCR [4,10,11] and sequencing of the 16S rRNA-gene for the identification of cultured
organisms.
Detailed information of complex microbial communities
can also be acquired from the phylogenetic analysis of 16S
rDNA sequences obtained directly from samples by PCR
amplification, cloning, and sequencing, so that uncultivable species are also included [12,13], although this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/16

approach may be biased as well [14,15], as becomes also
apparent from this study.
Here we report on the cloning and sequencing of 16S
rRNA gene fragments, amplified directly from vaginal
swabs, to examine the microbial diversity in the vaginal
fluid of healthy women with different grades of vaginal
microflora patterns as defined previously [16,17]. Finally,
the data obtained by anaerobic culture and with culture
independent techniques, lead us to carry out species specific PCR for A. vaginae and G. vaginalis, such that the presence of both species in differently graded samples could
be established.

Results
Grading of the Gram stained smears of the vaginal samples for which cloning was carried out, according to the
criteria of Ison and Hay [17] assigned three specimens
(W1-W3) to grade I, two (W4-5) to grade II and three
(W6-8) to grade III. Table 1 lists the species identified by
cloning and sequencing of cloned bacterial 16S rDNAfragments, as well as by bacterial culture and tDNA-PCR
from the vaginal microflora of these 8 healthy women.
Identification of cultured isolates from 8 healthy women
by tDNA-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
Forty six isolates were obtained after anaerobic culture of
the vaginal fluid from the 8 women in the cloning part of
the study. Twenty nine isolates, belonging to the species
Bacteroides ureolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus
crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, Peptoniphilus sp.,
Prevotella bivia, Streptococcus anginosus group and S. mitis
group were identified by tDNA-PCR using a library containing tDNA-PCR fingerprints of well-identified strains.
Six isolates belonging to the species Aerococcus christensenii, Anaerococcus tetradius, Anaerococcus vaginalis, Lactobacillus iners, Mobiluncus mulieris and Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius were identified by sequencing because they
produced a tDNA pattern that initially was not present in
the database. These species were characterized by a specific tDNA-PCR pattern that allowed unambiguous identification after the new patterns were added to the
database. In summary, 40 of 46 isolates (87.0%) were correctly identified by tDNA-PCR to the species level, including the species within the L. acidophilus complex. Of the
six isolates that could not be identified, one isolate, with
a sequence that was 99% identical to that of a Peptostreptococcus sp. strain (CCUG 42997, AJ277208), could not be
identified unambiguously by tDNA-PCR because its pattern was identical to that of P. micros, one isolate – that
was identified by sequencing as Atopobium vaginae – did
not yield a tDNA-pattern and another four isolates (8.7%)
were tDNA-PCR negative and also 16S PCR negative.

Identification of 16S rRNA gene clones from 8 healthy
women by sequencing and culture results
The ARDRA pattern of 854 clones was analysed and enabled to establish the relative frequency of the different

species present (Table 1). For 130 clones, belonging to 33
ARDRA types, on average 447 bp of the 5' end of the 16S
rRNA gene was sequenced. In case of grade I vaginal
smears, the most predominant species were L. crispatus

and L. gasseri. Smaller numbers of L. jensenii and L. vaginalis were also present. All females with grade I smears (W1W3) were colonized by two Lactobacillus species. W2 (age
34) and W3 (age 38) were colonized by Lactobacillus species only, with one species – respectively L. gasseri and L.
crispatus – represented by more than 99% of the clones. In
the vaginal fluid of W1 (age 51) the most abundant species were L. crispatus (66.1%), L. gasseri (18.6%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (6.5%). An additional 8 species were
found in low numbers, six only by cloning and one only
by culture. Three of these species, representing 5.6% of the
clones, showed less than 98% similarity with previously
published sequences. Culture results coincided largely
with cloning for the grade I samples, except for the non
Lactobacillus species of W1 of which only two were
cultured.
For the two grade II smears (W4 and W5) cloning revealed
four species, A. vaginae (resp. 1.5% and 41.6%), L. iners
(resp. 84.1% and 1.4%), a P. bivia-like species (resp. 7.3%
and 22.2%) and Sneathia sanguinegens (both 1.4%), that
were present in both samples. P. bivia was also present in
both grade II microflora but it was found by culture only.
Several other species were found by cloning only in either
W4 or W5. For example, [Leptotrichia amnionii] was found
only in W5. G. vaginalis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
were found respectively in W4 and W5 by culture only and
two species, Anaerococcus vaginalis and Enterococcus faecalis, were found by both cloning and culture in the microflora of W5.
Two women (W6 and W7) with a grade III vaginal smear
were colonized predominantly by A. vaginae (resp. 36.0
and 80.5%), L. iners (absent and 12.4%), G. vaginalis
(absent and 4.1%), M. mulieris (5.6 and 3.0%) and a
Prevotella buccalis-like species (31.2% and absent), according to cloning. As for grade II samples, there was limited
correspondence with culture. For W6, an A. vaginae-like
organism was cultured, but the sequence of this isolate
showed less than 98% similarity to the sequence of the
clones. Furthermore, a large number of colonies of G. vaginalis and Peptoniphilus sp. were present after anaerobic
culture but no clones were obtained.
The most abundant species obtained by cloning the third
grade III vaginal sample (W8) were Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius (68.6%)(also cultured), Peptoniphilus sp.
(14.3%) and an unidentified Streptococcus sp. (8.6%)(also
cultured).
Total number of species identified and comparison
between cloning and culture
Of the 38 species, 18 were discovered by cloning only, 5
by culture only, and 8 by both cloning and culture. Three
species were shown by both culture and cloning in some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/16

samples, but only by culture in the remaining samples,
another three species were shown by both cloning and
culture in some samples, but only by cloning in the
remaining samples and one species was found once by
culture only and once by cloning only. The presence of all
four grade I Lactobacillus sp. was shown in grade I samples
by both cloning and culture, whereas L. iners was found
only in three non-grade I samples, in all three by cloning
– even abundantly in W4, but only in W7 by culture. G.
vaginalis was cultured three times, but was found by cloning only once. A. vaginae was shown in four samples by
cloning, but cultured only once. The P. bivia-like species
and P. buccalis-like species were found in respectively two
and three samples by cloning but not by culture.
Possible novel species and genera
Of the 38 species that were distinguished by culture and
cloning in this study, only 76.3% demonstrated more
than 98% identity with previously known bacterial species (Table 1). Five of the eight vaginal samples contained
previously unidentified species.

Anaerobic culture of the microflora of W6 revealed an
Atopobium species that showed only 97.6% similarity with
previously reported A. vaginae sequences (see below).
Two presumptively novel species within the genus Prevotella were found. For W4 and W5 (grade II), respectively
7.3% and 22.2% of the clones had 91% similarity with a
P. bivia sequence. For W1 (grade I), W5 and W6 (grade
III), respectively 1.6%, 22.2% and 31.2% of the clones
showed 96.6% similarity with a P. buccalis sequence.
Respectively 2.9% and 0.8% of the clones of W4 (grade II)
and W6 (grade III) were identical and had only 86% similarity with an uncultured termite Actinobacteridae bacterium (accession number AB089070).
Variation in Atopobium sequences
Sixteen A. vaginae sequences are present in GenBank, one
from a clinical isolate [18], one from the type strain [19]
and 14 from cloned 16S rDNA fragments (Zhou, unpublished) (Figure 1). Another 17 sequences were obtained in
this study, one from an isolate from patient W6, two from
isolates from other patients (BVS38 and PB9) and 14 from
clones from four different patients, i.e. W4 (grade II), W5
(II), W6 (III) and W7 (III) (Figure 1).

The sequence of all 7 clones from W5 was different from
that of all other isolates and from the clones and the Genbank sequences, except from one Genbank clone
sequence (AY269023). The sequence of all clones from
the three other patients and from the two isolates from
samples BVS38 and PB9 were identical to the previously
published clinical isolate [18] and the type strain [19].
The sequence of the cultured isolate from patient W6 was

somewhat intermediate between both above sequences,
although the sequence of the clones of the same patient
were identical to that of the type strain. Specific amplification with both the ato167f primer and the ato154f primer
gave positive signals for the vaginal sample of W6, indicating that indeed both types of sequence were present.
Species-specific PCR for A. vaginae and G. vaginalis
To substantiate the results obtained by cloning, an additional series of 142 vaginal samples obtained by swab
from healthy pregnant (n = 115) and non-pregnant (n =
27) women, attending our out-patient clinic, were
selected for culture and for PCR with 16S rRNA gene based
primers specific for A. vaginae and G. vaginalis (Table 2).
Of the 150 subjects in total, 38 (of which 5 non-pregnant)
presented with non-grade I microflora, of which 26 were
assigned grade II, 9 grade III and 3 grade IV.

After amplification with the ato167f A. vaginae primer set,
respectively 19.6% of grade I, 34.6% of grade II, 77.8% of
grade III and 0.0% of grade IV samples showed an amplicon (Table 2). Of the 37 samples that showed an
amplicon after amplification with the ato167f primer
only 23 were positive after amplification with ato154f. A.
vaginae was cultured only three times from these 150
samples.
The number of positive samples for G. vaginalis specific
PCR varied depending on the primer set that was used.
The difference was greatest for grade I samples, with
respectively 4.5% of grade I samples that were positive
after amplification with the GOY primer set and 28.6%
with the GZ primer set (Table 2).
Comparative ROC analysis of the four indicators
(ato154f, ato167f, GZ, and GOY respectively) in discriminating normal and disturbed vaginal microflora showed
that the overall discriminative value of qualitative PCRbased detection of A. vaginae or G. vaginalis as such is actually rather low with AUCs of 0.627 (95%CI: 0.544–
0.704), 0.625 (95%CI: 0.543–0.703), 0.633 (95%CI:
0.551–0.711), and 0.675 (95%CI: 0.594–0.749).
Detection of the simultaneous presence of A. vaginae
(ato167f) and G. vaginalis (GOY) in a vaginal swab specimen with the purpose of assessing true bacterial vaginosis
(grade III) had an accuracy of 87.8% (AUC = 0.878,
95%CI = 0.714, 1.041, p < 0.001), a sensitivity of 0.78
(95%CI = 0.40, 0.96), a specificity of 0.98 (95%CI = 0.91,
1.00), a positive predictive value of 0.78 (95%CI = 0.40,
0.96), and a negative predictive value of 0.98 (95%CI =
0.91, 1.00). When the co-existence of A. vaginae (ato167f)

and G. vaginalis was assessed using the GZ-primer set, the
overall performance of the assay was significantly lower.

namely that postmenopausal healthy women frequently
present with BV-like microscopy [5,22].

Discussion

Of the five women with non-grade I microflora (two with
grade II and three with grade III), one presented with predominant Peptostreptococcus clones (68%), a picture that
was very different from that observed in the other women.
However, most striking was the observation that for the
other four patients between 1.5% and 80.0% of the clones
were identified as Atopobium vaginae, a species previously
known only from a single isolate from the vagina of a
healthy woman [19] and from a clinically important isolate, described as the causative agent in a case of a pelvic
inflammatory disease (PID) following transvaginal oocyte
recruitment [18]. Interestingly, Zhou et al. [20] reported
dominating Atopobium sp. in a woman, judged to carry a
normal vaginal microflora. The authors concluded that
Atopobium may be present as part of the normal microflora
of the vagina [23]. This warrants a more detailed discussion of this recently described species.

To our knowledge, no cloning study addressing the composition of the microflora of vaginal samples and bacterial vaginosis samples has been published thus far. By
means of culture and by cloning and sequencing of 16S
rRNA genes, amplified directly from the vaginal samples,
we studied the vaginal microflora of 8 healthy women
with different grades of bacterial vaginosis according to
Nugent [2], as modified by Ison and Hay [16,17].
The frequency of the different clones could be assessed by
performing ARDRA of the cloned 16S rRNA genes and
counting the number of clones belonging to each ARDRA
type. Representative clones for each ARDRA type were
subsequently sequenced to determine the species identity.
Five bacterial species, i.e. Atopobium rimae, Bifidobacterium
biavatii (urinalis), Dialister sp., [Leptotrichia amnionii] and
Sneathia sanguinegens, had never been recovered from the
vagina. Twenty two percent of the clones, belonging to 9
putative species, showed less than 98% homology to any
of the 16S rRNA gene sequences present in GenBank, indicating that several bacterial species, indigeneous to the
female genital tract, remain to be characterized.
In this study, cloning confirmed that the vaginal microflora of healthy women is dominated by a limited number
of Lactobacillus species. For the women with grade I microflora, the two species L. crispatus and L. gasseri, alone or in
combination, accounted for 85–99% of the clones. The
two younger women, 34 and 38 years, had almost pure
cultures of L. crispatus resp. L. gasseri, in association with
low numbers of resp. L. jensenii (< 1%) and L. vaginalis (<
1%) and without any other bacteria. In our ongoing studies we find this to be the case for 61.5% of the grade I samples (unpublished data). The finding of monocultures of
L. crispatus and L. gasseri is also in correspondence with
recent reports, which point to the predominance of only
three to four Lactobacillus species in normal vaginal microflora [7,20]. Antonio et al. [3] considered L. crispatus, L.
jensenii and L. gasseri as the indicator species for normal
vaginal microflora, also because most strains of these species are hydroxyperoxide producers in opposition to other
Lactobacillus spp. It should be noted in this context that
another group could not substantiate any protective effect
of hydroxyperoxide producing lactobacilli [21].
In the 51-year-old woman (W1), with a combination of
both L. crispatus and L. gasseri, some additional non Lactobacillus species were present in low numbers, with Fusobacterium nucleatum as the most predominant (i.e. 6.5%).
This may be in accordance with another observation,

The genus Atopobium was introduced to accommodate the
species Lactobacillus minutus, Lactobacillus rimae and Streptococcus parvulus [24]. Atopobium species have been
described to produce major amounts of lactic acid [19], a
characteristic reminiscent of lactobacilli, although no special reference to this property was made in the description
of A. vaginae [19]. Atopobium species are anaerobic, Grampositive elliptical cocci or rod-shaped organisms occurring singly, in pairs or as short chains. The variable cell
morphology of A. vaginae makes that this species may
reside perfectly camouflaged and as a consequence undetectable among the mixture of other species present in
grade II and III bacterial communities. Also the fact that A.
vaginae is fastidious and forms small pinhead colonies can
explain why this species was not yet established as part of
the vaginal microflora, when using classical microbiology.
In this study, we could culture the species from only three
out of 150 vaginal specimens.
Based on our findings with A. vaginae specific PCR, which
recovered this species in 19.6% of the 112 grade I specimens, it appears as if A. vaginae may be a constituent –
presumably in low numbers – of the human vagina, possibly attaining replicative dominance in association with
decreasing lactobacillary grading. This hypothesis could
be substantiated with quantitative PCR and the development of selective culture media.
The striking fact that Gardnerella vaginalis, predominantly
present in bacterial vaginosis samples [e.g. [25,26]], was
not found by cloning as carried out in this study, can be
explained as the consequence of a methodological bias,
because the forward primer used for cloning (10f) contained 3 mismatches for G. vaginalis. On the other hand,

the use of these non G. vaginalis 'universal' primers may
have facilitated to establish the high prevalence of A. vaginae. To assess the relative importance of both species,
cloning should be carried out with different sets of primers. Amplification of grade I, grade II and grade III samples
with species specific primers indicated that G. vaginalis
was present in respectively 28.6%, 50.0 % and 88.9% of
the samples, while Atopobium was present in respectively
19.6%, 34.6% and 77.8% of the vaginal microflora.
Since any pairwise comparison of the four ROC plots did
not show any significant differences between the AUCs, it
is also apparent that each of the four indicators under
study (ato154f, ato167f, GZ, and GOY respectively)
presents with a comparably limited accuracy in discriminating normal and disturbed vaginal microflora. This may
be explained by the fact that, although both species are
present in about 80% of the true bacterial vaginosis samples, their presence in grade I samples is not uncommon.
This lack of accuracy for G. vaginalis was also previously
assessed in culture-dependent studies [27,28].
The co-existence of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis in women
with grade III microflora together with their simultaneous
absence in grade I samples (Table 2) is striking. The simultaneous presence of both species therefore is highly predictive for BV.
Lactobacillus iners, was present among the clones in three
of the five non-grade I samples, even in large numbers,
and absent from the three grade I samples. This species
was only recently recognized as a separate Lactobacillus
species [29]. In the original description of this relatively
asaccharolytic Lactobacillus species, the only vaginal
isolate among the 9 strains from females came from vaginal discharge [29]. This species may have been largely
overlooked in culture based studies [30-32] since it does
not grow on Lactobacillus selective media, including MRS
and Rogosa-Sharp medium [29]. Using molecular techniques L. iners was reported as one of the most frequently
encountered vaginal Lactobacillus species [8,9] present in
normal and BV microflora [5].
Leptotrichia sp. are slow-growing, gram-negative anaerobic
organisms of the oral cavity and genital tract. [L. amnionii]
is an extremely fastidious organism, which most likely
explains why this organism was hitherto virtually undetectable by conventional culture-based microbiological
techniques. Of interest is that this particular Leptotrichia
species was isolated by Shukla et al. [33] from the amniotic fluid of a woman with second trimester fetal loss,
which led the authors to conclude that [L. amnionii] is presumably indigenous to the genital tract and acts as an
opportunist under particular clinical conditions, includ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/16

ing pregnancy. This study demonstrates for the first time
the presence of [L. amnionii] in the vagina.
Sneathia sanguinegens (formerly Leptotrichia sanguinegens)
was found in this study to be present in three patients with
non-grade I vaginal microflora, in moderate numbers. S.
sanguinegens has been isolated from human blood and
amniotic fluid [34] and has been associated with several
cases of pregnancy-associated bacteraemia, i.e. postpartum fever in four patients and neonatal sepsis in two
patients [35]. This study demonstrates the presence of S.
sanguinegens in the vagina for the first time.
One strain from W6 and 14.3% of the clones from W8
were identified as Peptoniphilus indolicus based on more
than 98% similarity with a Genbank sequence with accession number D14147 corresponding with the type strain
CCUG 17639 of this species. This type strain however has
two Genbank entries (also AY153430) with low similarity
[36]. Unfortunately our isolate was not stored so further
phenotypic identification was not possible. Because of the
ambiguous Genbank sequences, we chose to designate
our isolate and clones as Peptoniphilus sp.
Thus far, identification of organisms cultured from complex microbial biota like the vagina, especially under the
condition of vaginosis, has also been hampered by the
limitations of conventional biochemical and phenotypic
identification methods. However, using a DNA-based
method, namely tDNA-PCR [11], it is convenient to
appropriately identify most of these organisms, once a
library, based on tDNA-PCR of well characterized organisms, has been constructed. Also, newly unknowns can be
first identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence determination,
whereafter it is possible to use the corresponding tDNA
fingerprint for future identification of the organisms of
the same species.
tDNA-PCR, which consists of the amplification of the
spacer regions between tRNA genes, has been shown to
yield mainly species-specific DNA fingerprints [10]. Combined with capillary electrophoresis, tDNA-PCR has been
shown to be a semi-automated, digital DNA-fingerprinting method that enables rapid and discriminatory identification of species from very diverse phylogenetic groups,
including Lactobacillus [4,11].

Conclusions
In summary, the use of tDNA-PCR based identification of
cultured organisms in combination with cloning of 16S
rRNA genes, amplified directly from vaginal swabs, enabled us to characterize the vaginal microflora in a detailed
manner, and to compare the composition of the normal
vaginal microflora with the bacterial vaginosis microflora.
The presence of A. vaginae in 4 of the 5 women with bac-

terial vaginosis grade II-III microflora is an unexpected
and previously not reported finding, which may shed new
light on the etiology of this condition. There is also the
ambiguous position of L. iners, which apparently is not
indicative of a normal microflora, but may point to some
intermediate condition.

Based on smear results, eight non-pregnant women
(mean age 41.4 years, range 28–51 years) from the studied population, attending our out-patient clinic for a routine gynaecological visit, were selected for cloning of the
16S rRNA genes present in the vaginal microflora. The culture results are reported only for these eight women.

Furthermore, our findings warrant more detailed studies
of the ability of species like L. iners and A. vaginae to produce lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and of their cellular
and colonial morphology and biochemical characteristics, as well as their interaction with lactobacilli and G.
vaginalis. A selective medium for these organisms might
be a welcome tool for further studies, given the fact that
until now they have been largely overlooked by culture
methods.

To substantiate the results obtained by cloning and culture, PCR with species specific primers for A. vaginae and
G. vaginalis and culture were carried out for the complete
population.

Finally, the discrepancies between culture, cloning and
specific PCR, together with the diversity of the recovered
species, their unequal distribution over different vaginal
samples, the elucidation of several species – including
presumptively new species – previously not associated
with the vagina, indicate that much is to be learned about
the composition of the vaginal microflora and its relation
to the etiology of BV.

Methods
Study population, sample collection and grading
For a total of 150 healthy women of reproductive age,
attending our out-patient clinic, of which 115 were pregnant, the health condition with regard to the composition
of the vaginal bacterial community was assessed microscopically after Gram stain, according to the criteria of
Hay and Ison [17] and vaginal samples were taken.
Briefly, specimens were considered grade I (normal) when
only Lactobacillus morphotypes were present, grade II
(intermediate) when both Lactobacillus and other morphotypes were present, grade III (BV) when only non
Lactobacillus morphotypes were seen and grade IV when
only Gram positive cocci were seen.

Sampling was carried out as follows. After placement of a
non-lubrificated speculum two sterile cotton swabs were
inserted into the vaginal vault. The swabs were rotated
against the vaginal wall at the midportion of the vault and
were carefully removed to prevent contamination with the
vulva and introitus microflora. One swab was returned to
a sterile tube (dry swab) (Copan, Brescia, Italy), for the
purpose of DNA-extraction. The other swab was placed
into Amies transport medium (Nuova Aptaca, Canelli,
Italy) and was used for making a smear for the purpose of
grading according to the Hay and Ison criteria [17] and for
anaerobic culture. Both swabs were processed in the
microbiology laboratory within 4 h.

Culture and identification of cultured isolates by tDNAPCR
For eight non-pregnant women, the swab on Amies transport medium was streaked onto tryptic soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated anaerobically at 37°C
upon arrival at the microbiology laboratory. After 4 days
of incubation, all the isolates with different colony morphology were selected for identification. DNA was
extracted by simple alkaline lysis: one colony was suspended in 20 µl of 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate-0.05 N
NaOH, heated at 95°C for 15 min and diluted with 180
µl of distilled water. tDNA-PCR and capillary electrophoresis were carried out as described previously [4,11].
The species to which each isolate belonged was determined by comparing the tDNA-PCR fingerprint obtained
from each isolate with a library of tDNA-PCR fingerprints
obtained from reference strains, using an in-house software program [11]. The library of tDNA-PCR fingerprints
and the software are available on request.
DNA extraction of vaginal swab samples
For DNA extraction from the dry vaginal swabs, the
QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was
used according to the manufacturer's recommendations,
with minor modifications. The dry swab specimen from
each patient was swirled for 15 s in 400 µl of lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mM EDTA; 1.2% Triton).
Fifty units of mutanolysin (25 U/µl) (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium) were added and the samples were incubated for 30
min at 37°C. After the addition of 20 µl Proteinase K (20
mg/ml) and 200 µl AL buffer (Qiagen), samples were
incubated for 30 min at 56°C. Next, 200 µl of ethanol was
added and DNA was purified by adding the lysate to the
Qiagen columns as described by the manufacturer.
Finally, the total bacterial DNA was eluted with 100 µl of
AE buffer (Qiagen). DNA-extracts were stored at -20°C
and were used for the purpose of cloning experiments and
species specific PCR.
Cloning of amplified mixtures of 16S rDNA
To amplify the 5' part of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes by
PCR, primers 10f (5' AGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and

534r (5' ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) [37], which target the
domain Bacteria, were used. It should be noted that the
forward primer contains mismatches for G. vaginalis at
positions 1 (A/G), 5 (T/C) and 9 (C/T). A 50 µl PCR mixture contained 0.1 µM of each primer, 25 µl of Promega
master mix (Promega, Madison, WI), 5 µl of DNA extract
and distilled water. Thermal cycling consisted of an initial
denaturation of 5 min at 94°C, followed by three cycles of
1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 50°C and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 35 cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C and
1 min 72°C, with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C, and
cooling to 10°C. PCR products were purified using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Cloning was
done using the Qiagen PCR Cloning Kit (UA-cloning,
Qiagen), whereby the purified amplicons were ligated
into the pDrive cloning vector and transformed into Qiagen EZ Competent E. coli Cells, as specified by the
manufacturer.
Screening for clones with different 16S rRNA gene inserts
by ARDRA
From each sample, 100 to 200 ampicillin-resistant transformants, recognizable as white colonies on Luria-Bertani
(LB) agar containing IPTG (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), XGal (Roche) and 100 µg ampicillin/ml after overnight
incubation at 37°C, were selected for further analysis. Single colonies were picked from the agar plates and transferred with sterile tips to the wells of a 96 well plate filled
with LB Broth supplemented with 100 µg ampicillin/ml
and incubated for 3 h. To avoid sequencing of all clones,
the 16S rRNA gene inserts were differentiated initially
from each other by means of Amplified rDNA Restriction
Analysis (ARDRA)[38]. One µl of bacterial culture was
added to a final volume of 20 µl PCR mix, containing 0.2
µM of two plasmid-targeted primers, QF (5'TACGTATCGGATCCAGAATTC) and QR (5'CGAGAAGCTTGTCGACGAATT), 10 µl of Promega master mix and distilled water.
The position of primers QF and QR was chosen as such
that their distance towards the insert was the same in
order to result in the same ARDRA pattern regardless the
orientation of the insert in the cloning vector. Cycling
conditions were the same as described above for the 16S
rRNA gene. Ten microliter of the amplified products were
digested with 10 U of the restriction endonuclease BstUI
in the appropriate enzyme buffer and incubated for 3 h at
60°C. The DNA restriction fragments were separated in a
2.5% agarose electrophoresis gel, containing 2% Methaphor (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) and 0.5% MP
agarose (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in the presence of
ethidium bromide (50 ng/ml). The gels were photographed and the obtained ARDRA fingerprints were compared visually. For each ARDRA type, the 16S rRNA gene
insert of at least one representative clone was sequenced,
thus minimizing the number of sequence reactions that
had to be carried out.

Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from isolates and clones
For 8 healthy women, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
and sequenced from selected clones and from cultured
isolates that could not be identified by tDNA-PCR, using
primers 10f and 534r, as described above. For the clones,
1 µl of the QF-QR amplified PCR product was diluted
1000 times with distilled water and re-amplification of
the 16S rRNA gene was done with the primers 10f and
534r. For the cultured isolates, a 5 µl aliquot of the alkaline lysate was added to a 50 µl PCR mixture. The amplification products were then purified with the Qiaquick
PCR purification kit, according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Sequencing was done using the ABI Big Dye
cycle sequencing reaction kit with AmpliTaq FS DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.) with
primer 534r. Sequencing reaction products were analyzed
on an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Inspection of the electropherograms was done with Chromas http://www.technelysium.com.au/chromas14x.html
and with the BioEdit package [39]. Comparison of the
sequences of the inserts and isolates to the 16S rRNA gene
sequences in GenBank was done using the BLAST software
[40]. Clones or isolates with DNA sequences sharing more
than 98% identity with known sequences were assigned to
that phylotype.
Species specific PCR for Gardnerella vaginalis
G. vaginalis species-specific primers as designed by
Zariffard et al. (GZ)[26] and Obata-Yasuoka et al. (GOY)
[25] were used. Briefly, a 20 µl PCR mixture contained
respectively 0.05 and 0.4 µM primers, 10 µl of Promega
master mix (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 µl of Qiagen DNAextract of the samples and distilled water. Thermal cycling
with GZ primers consisted of an initial denaturation of 10
min at 94°C, followed by 50 cycles of 5 s at 94°C, 45 s at
55°C and 45 s at 72°C, and a final extension of 10 min at
72°C. Thermal cycling with the GOY primers was performed by an initial denaturation of 1 min at 94°C was
followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C
and 1 min at 70°C and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C.
During the first ten cycles the annealing temperature was
lowered by 0.5°C per cycle. Five microliter of the amplified product of each PCR was visualized on a 2% agarose
gel.
Species specific PCR for Atopobium vaginae
Two primer sets that allowed amplification of the 16S
rRNA gene of A. vaginae and that lacked homology with
non-target bacteria as determined by searching the Gene
Bank database using BLAST software [40], were designed.
The selected primers, ato167f 5' (GCGAATATGGGAAAGCTCCG), ato154f 5' (ATATTTGTCGCATGGCGAAT)
and
ato587r
5'
(GAGCGGATAGGGGTTGAGC), were analysed for secondary structures using NetPrimer (Premier Biosoft Inter-

national, Palo Alto, CA). A 20 µl PCR mixture contained
0.2 µM of primers (respectively ato167f or ato154f and
ato587r), 10 µl of Promega master mix (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 µl of Qiagen DNA-extract of the samples and
distilled water. Thermal cycling consisted of an initial
denaturation of 5 min at 94°C, followed by three cycles of
1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 58°C and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 35 cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C and
1 min 72°C, with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C, and
cooling to 10°C. Five microliter of the amplified product
was visualized on a 2% agarose gel. The primers amplified
a DNA-fragment of respectively 420 and 433 basepairs
from A. vaginae and showed no cross reactivity to other
organisms, including A. rimae (data not presented).
Statistics
To assess the relative accuracy of PCR-based detection of
G. vaginalis or A. vaginae, we applied comparative receiveroperating-characteristic (ROC) analysis under the nonparametric assumption and compared the accuracies of
the isolated markers (amplification with ato154f,
ato167f, GOY and GZ) in allocating subjects to a particular
Gram stain category (grades I to IV).

Subsequently, we compared the accuracy of PCR-based
combined detection of G. vaginalis (using the two different primer sets designated GZand GOY) and A. vaginae
(using ato167f) to assess the vaginal microflora status
(according to Gram stain category) by non-parametric
ROC-analysis.
Accuracy in these analyses is expressed as the area-underthe-curve (AUC) in the ROC-plot, the 95% confidence
interval (CI) to the AUC, and the p-value to the 95% CI.
We also calculated the estimated sensitivity, specificity,
positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV)
and the 95% confidence intervals to these measures. Statistical significance was accepted at the α = 0.05-level.
Analyses were carried out using the statistical software
packages EpiCalc2000 v.1.02 and SPSS v.11.0.
