Abstract
Background: The hybridization of synthetic Streptococcus pneumoniae tmRNA on a detection microarray is slow at
34°C resulting in low signal intensities.
Results: We demonstrate that adding specific DNA helper oligonucleotides (chaperones) to the hybridization buffer
increases the signal strength at a given temperature and thus makes the specific detection of Streptococcus
pneumoniae tmRNA more sensitive. No loss of specificity was observed at low temperatures compared to hybridization
at 46°C. The effect of the chaperones can be explained by disruption of the strong secondary and tertiary structure of
the target RNA by the selective hybridization of helper molecules. The amplification of the hybridization signal strength
by chaperones is not necessarily local; we observed increased signal intensities in both local and distant regions of the
target molecule.
Conclusions: The sensitivity of the detection of tmRNA at low temperature can be increased by chaperone
oligonucleotides. Due to the complexity of RNA secondary and tertiary structures the effect of any individual
chaperone is currently not predictable.
Background
Over the last decade microarrays have quickly found
applications in microbial diagnostics, for detecting different pathogenic viruses, bacteria and other microbes [1] or
for analyzing species composition in environmental and
medical samples [2]. Also, many different biosensor technologies based on nucleic acid hybridization have been
developed and proposed for quick and cost effective "inthe-field" detection and identification of diseases, pathogens or contaminants [3,4].
The most common target molecule for diagnostic and
phylogenetic studies is 16S rRNA (or corresponding
gene). It was used in the 1970s [5] and continues to be the
most widely-used marker for discriminating bacterial
species [2,6]. The advantages of ribosomal small subunit
RNA are its presence in all species in high copy numbers
and the different evolutionary rates of different regions of
16S rRNA, making various taxonomic studies possible
[7,8]. Nevertheless, alternative marker molecules [9-12]
have to be considered in case 16S rRNA is not suitable for

precise detection and distinguishing between closely
related species [13].
One interesting novel marker that has shown great
potential in molecular diagnostics is the tmRNA transcript of bacterial ssrA gene. In living cells, tmRNA is
present in relatively high copy numbers (around 1000
molecules per cell) [14,15] and is responsible for assisting
ribosomes during translation when protein synthesis
stalls. tmRNA molecules contain regions of species-specific sequence heterogeneity and can therefore be successfully used as markers for bacterial diagnostics [16,17].
Nucleic acid hybridizations in microbiology and molecular diagnostics have been performed at various temperatures ranging from 4°C and RT to around 40°C or even
higher (50°C and above). It is suggested in previous studies, that the hybridization of complex target molecules is
hindered below 42°C, leading e.g. to low signal intensities
and bad probe specificity [18]. Low temperature hybridization is of great interest for emerging technologies,
such as membrane biosensors, where the denaturation of
membranes and proteins have to be avoided and "laboratory-on-chip" and embedded solutions, where maintaining different compartments with varying temperature can
be complicated and costly. Modern oligonucleotide

lem of detecting hybridized intact RNA [23,27]. It is
reported that chaperones immediately side-to-side with
hybridization probes are most effective in increasing the
effectiveness of hybridization at low temperature [28].
This has been explained by the prevention of hairpin
structure formation and by the effect of base stacking
between capture probe and chaperone [27].
In this study we evaluated the effect of short DNA
helper oligonucleotides (chaperones) on the hybridization of synthetic Streptococcus pneumoniae tmRNA molecules to DNA microarray probes. The practical objective
was to find an improved protocol for detecting bacterial
species by tmRNA hybridization. The theoretical objective was to elucidate the effect of the complex structure of
a longer RNA target molecule on hybridization kinetics.
In addition, a practical use for chaperones as a interesting
novel tool in secondary structure analysis was demonstrated.

Results
Weak hybridization signals at low temperature

To determine the signal intensity and specificity over a
range of temperatures, we performed hybridization
experiments with synthetic S. pneumoniae tmRNA at
temperatures ranging from 34°C to 72°C with 4°C steps.
At temperatures below 42°C the relative signal intensities
were lower than expected from the theoretical melting
curves (Figure 1). On average, the decrease in relative signal intensity was more apparent for longer probes, but
still clearly present even for probes only 9-10 nucleotides
long.
The specificity of hybridization at 34°C was determined
by analyzing signals from 21 probes on the same microar-

design tools allow the hybridization affinity and specificity of local regions to be estimated quite precisely at different temperatures. One of our main goals was to
develop a hybridization method that would be suitable
for use below 37°C.
Several difficulties can arise in the detection of bacterial RNA by hybridization. Target RNA degradation has
to be prevented and nonspecific hybridizations with
wrong targets avoided. The latter is rather difficult on
highly conserved RNA molecules [19]. Strong secondary
structures can block the hybridization sites inside the
molecule and thus prevent hybridization almost completely or retard it significantly [20,21]. The secondary
structure of RNA is much stronger than that of the corresponding DNA [22] and the detection of RNA is more
difficult [23]. It is suggested that secondary structure may
be the main reason why hybridization-based detection
fails at room temperature [18,21] and it has to be disrupted, or (in the case of synthetic molecules) its formation has to be minimized, to gain access to the target
regions of the RNA molecule [21,24]. The latter is especially crucial in the case of rRNA and tmRNA molecules
as they both fold into complex secondary and tertiary
structures.
For certain applications it is also important to be able to
estimate the relative or absolute abundances of different
bacterial strains or species quantitatively. Quantification
of hybridization poses additional challenges, especially if
the process is too slow to reach equilibrium.
Several approaches to improve the efficiency of hybridization have been described. The hybridization temperature can be increased. It is predicted that while about 70%
of a 70-mer cDNA molecule is inaccessible at 42°C, only
30% of DNA and 50% of RNA remains inaccessible at
65°C [20]. Some authors have suggested that a higher
temperature increases hybridization specificity, but other
authors have found no such effect [23]. Designing probes
for specific exposed areas of the molecule also increases
the hybridization efficiency [20]. Measuring or predicting
the effect of secondary structure is difficult [25,26], especially as the parts of molecule that do not form doublehelical stems can themselves be blocked by higher-level
structures [20]. Cleaving target molecules to smaller fragments is one widely-used option; it can expose most
hybridization sites that are normally blocked [20,25].
Alternatively, specific helper oligonucleotides (chaperones) can be added to the hybridization solution to
increase hybridization efficiency [18,23,27]. These molecules bind to target molecules and block specific or nonspecific intramolecular interactions that cause secondary
structure formation. Chaperones are specific to certain
target molecules and they also increase the specificity of
hybridization. Chaperones can also be marked with fluorophores or other detectable markers, solving the prob-

ray, designed to the tmRNA sequences of other bacteria.
We excluded 4 nonspecific probes, that had detectable
false signals at 46°C, possibly due to errors in probe
design process. The signal intensities of the remaining
nonspecific probes were at least 200 times lower than the
average intensity of the specific probes at and below 46°C.
To determine whether the weak signals at low temperatures were caused by slow hybridization or by a shift in
equilibrium towards the secondary structure of the target
molecules, a series of experiments were performed at
34°C by varying the hybridization time from 2 h to 12 h.
The signal intensities increased with time but did not
reach a plateau even after 12 h at 34°C. This indicated
that hybridization did not reach equilibrium and the low
signal intensities were probably caused by a slow rate.
Chaperones increase the hybridization intensity at low
temperatures

To determine whether the hybridization intensity at low
temperatures can be increased by disrupting the tmRNA
secondary structure, we added a mixture of six chaperone
oligonucleotides in equal concentrations to the tmRNA
solution before hybridization. Three different total chaperone concentrations were tested: 10, 100 and 1000 times
the molar concentration of tmRNA. In all cases we
recorded significant changes in the intensities of individual signals, which increased 2-3 times on average,
although signals were strongly suppressed in several parts
of the tmRNA molecule. We observed the highest
increase of signal intensity with a relative concentration
of chaperones to tmRNA = 100:1. At a relative concentration of 1000:1, the average signal strength was lower than
at the 100:1 concentration. For all subsequent experiments we used a chaperone:tmRNA ratio of 100:1.
As expected, the signal intensities increased most
markedly for probes that overlapped no chaperone. Most
signals of overlapping probes were suppressed by chaperones, although few were higher.
To determine the effect of chaperones on probe specificity, we compared the signals of the S. pneumoniae
probes with the signals of probes designed for other bacterial species. If the 4 probes, that had detectable false
signals at 46°C, were removed, the difference between
specific and nonspecific signals was more than 300-fold.
Chaperones increase signal intensities in distantly located
regions of the target molecule

To determine which regions of tmRNA were affected by
the presence of all six chaperones, we arranged the signals by the probe midpoint position on tmRNA. Three
clearly outstanding regions of increased signal strength
were apparent around nucleotide positions 100, 150 and
240 of tmRNA (Figure 2). These regions fall outside the
chaperone hybridization areas on tmRNA.

Page 3 of 10

By hybridizing the tmRNA in the presence of individual
chaperones and arranging the signals by probe midpoint
position, we determined the regions most strongly
affected by individual chaperones (Figure 3). Chaperone
F amplified the signal intensities most strongly in the
region (230-240) close to the chaperone hybridizing site
(247-260), while chaperones A and E amplified the signals
of distant regions. Chaperone A, binding to region 32-46,
amplified signals 50 bp towards the 3' end of the tmRNA
and also at the 3' end of the molecule. Chaperone E, binding to region 187-201, amplified signals 50 bp towards the
5' end. All chaperones strongly suppressed the signals of
overlapped probes, except chaperone E.
We also calculated the probability of hybridization of
each nucleotide in tmRNA using sFold and compared it
with our hybridization diagrams. There was no significant correlation between the regions of greatly amplified
signal strength and the regions of high probability of
nucleotide pairing.

Discussion
Ideally, hybridization can be viewed as an equilibrium
between free and bound target molecules. The relative
abundances of molecules in both states are determined by
the difference between rates of duplex formation and dissociation. These rates in turn are determined by the free
energy changes in the corresponding processes. Signal
intensity is directly proportional to the number of molecules hybridized and is thus determined by the difference
in free energy change between hybridization and dissociation. Equilibrium is usually preferred for hybridization
because the signal strength is greatest, since the maximum numbers of target molecules are bound to the
probes. Also, as hybridization rates may differ among
molecules, only the equilibrium state guarantees that
actual signal intensities correlate with the concentrations
and hybridization affinities of the target molecules. If
equilibrium is not reached, a rapidly but weakly hybridizing target may give a stronger signal than a slowly but
strongly hybridizing one, so its relative concentration is
overestimated.
At low temperature hybridization experiments, two
important factors can influence the signal intensities.
Both of them are strongly influenced by secondary structures of the target molecule. First, the equilibrium can
change and the probe cannot compete with the secondary structure any more [21,26]. Second, the concentration
of accessible target configurations is lower at low temperature due to the increased stability of tightly packed secondary structures. The hybridization rate is proportional
to the concentration of accessible target molecules and is
therefore much slower at low temperatures [26].
If the actual rate of hybridization is low, we may not
reach equilibrium during the experiment. In that case the

signals are initially low but increase over time. As we
detected such behavior in our experiment, we concluded
that the low signal intensities at low temperature are at
least partially caused by slow hybridization.
By hybridizing with the target molecule, chaperones
block the formation of at least some secondary or tertiary
structure variants and thus increase the rate of hybridization at low temperatures [21,24]. Although it is shown,
that designing chaperone specifically to the the region
that forms intramolecular bonds increases hybridization
signals significantly [28], this is not always possible.
We were unable to establish any correlation between
the pairing probability of individual nucleotides in
tmRNA, calculated with sFold, and the relative amplification of the signals in the presence of chaperones. This can
be explained by the effect of tmRNA tertiary structure
and the non-equilibrium state. The hybridization probability calculated by sFold only takes direct intramolecular
pairings between nucleotides into account; it does not
consider the blocking of potential hybridization sites by
the globular structure of the molecule. Also, the probabilities of different conformations are calculated by absolute
free energy levels, not taking into account the kinetics of
secondary structure formation. Some conformations with
low free energy may form very slowly, simply because
they have to cross an unfavorable intermediate state.
When probe hybridization is blocked by the formation
of a hairpin-like structure, the chaperone for the immedi-

ate neighborhood should work best because it does not
allow the hairpin to form. It has been demonstrated that
designing chaperones for the immediate neighborhood
should work best if the accessibility of the region is hindered by the formation of secondary structure elements
such as hairpins [28].
We were able to see such an effect with chaperone F,
where the hybridization profiles of all probes suggest the
presence of a hairpin. The chaperone binds to region 248261 and the signals in the immediately preceding region
(230-245) are strongly amplified in its presence. Thus,
one can infer that without treatment, these regions are
probably hybridized, forming a hairpin. Indeed, the ΔG
plot generated by mFold suggests that there is a local
energetic minimum between those regions. Nevertheless,
it is important to notice that according to mFold this hairpin was not present in the most stable molecule conformation, as determined by the global energy minimum.
Also, many other places with similar local energy profiles
did not show a similar hybridization pattern. Thus, a
hairpin, even if energetically favorable, may often not be
the prevailing secondary structure pattern.
A high-level (tertiary) structure of RNA may also form
by intramolecular hybridization between distant parts of
a longer sequence. Thus the sites that affect the accessibility of a certain part of the molecule may be spatially
separated from it. In that case, designing a chaperone for
the immediate proximity of the probe may not work,

position on tmRNA. The shaded area is the hybridization region of the chaperone on tmRNA.

because it either cannot hybridize because of blockage by
the three-dimensional structure, or fails to make the
neighboring site accessible because it is blocked by some
other region. In that case, the best results should be
obtained by a chaperone hybridizing specifically to the
tertiary structure-forming region, so the tertiary structure cannot form and the conformation of the molecule is
loosened. Such chaperones can potentially increase the
probe hybridization rate in many regions of the molecule.
In the current experiments, the effect of tertiary structure is suggested by the fact that a single chaperone was
able to amplify signals in different regions of the tmRNA
molecule (chaperones A and D) and different chaperones
amplified signals in the same region (chaperones A, D
and E). Such an effect was also suggested by the generic
increase of signal intensities of all non-overlapping
probes, irrespective of location, in the presence of chaperones.
As expected, chaperones almost completely block the
signals of the overlapping probes. Nevertheless, this
effect is not absolute, as seen with chaperone E. The reason is still unclear. One possibility is weak chaperone
binding, so the higher affinity capture probes outcompete
it during hybridization. However, the chaperone has to
have a sufficiently high affinity to outcompete the secondary structure of tmRNA successfully. This contradiction may indicate that at least in some cases, the factor
limiting hybridization is not secondary but tertiary structure. Although intramolecular double-stranded regions
are energetically weak, they fold the tmRNA molecule in
such a way that some parts of it are not easily accessible.
In such a case, the energetically much stronger targetprobe hybridization is slow because the probability that a
probe will hit its target area is very low, especially as the
probes are immobilized on a surface. Chaperones were
applied at a higher temperature at which there was no
tertiary structure. Also, the relative concentration of
chaperone molecules was much higher, both because
they were applied in abundance and because they were
free in solution. Thus, the chaperones could hybridize to
any region, and if the temperature was lowered, the tertiary structures either did not form or were much weaker.

Conclusion
We thus conclude that while the hybridization of tmRNA
can sometimes be relatively slow at low temperatures, it
can be significantly increased by using specific helper oligonucleotides (chaperones). The exact effect of certain
helper nucleotides on the strength of the signal of certain
capture probes depends on many factors, including probably the three-dimensional structure of the target molecule. The effect is not always local, meaning that a
chaperone in the immediate proximity of the capture
probe may not increase the signal strength, while one at a

distant location might. As the structures of denatured
nucleotide sequences cannot be precisely predicted at
present, experimental verification of chaperones is necessary.

Methods
Bacterial strain and ssrA

The pCR®II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) containing Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 33400
tmRNA encoding ssrA was obtained from Dr. Barry
Glynn, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.
The tmRNA gene was positioned into the vector under
the transcriptional control of the T7 promoter sequence.
In vitro RNA transcription

The ssrA-containing vector was linearized in 1× buffer R
using HindIII restriction endonuclease (both reagents
from Fermentas UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania). The reaction
was carried out for 60 min at 37°C, followed by 15 min
enzyme inhibition at 65°C. S. pneumoniae tmRNA was
transcribed in vitro using 25 ng linearized vector and 20
U T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. Briefly, final 1× reaction buffer contained 2 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP and 1 mM
UTP; 30 U RiboLock™ ribonuclease inhibitor was added
to prevent possible RNA degradation. Aminoallyl-UTP
(aaUTP) was added to 1 mM final concentration, making
the final UTP:aaUTP ratio 1:1. A reaction volume of 25 μl
was achieved by adding DEPC-treated water. All the
reagents were purchased from Fermentas UAB. The transcription reaction was continued for 120 min at 37°C. In
vitro synthesized RNA was purified using a Nucleotide®
RNA CleanUp Kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A final
60 μl of the material eluted was dehydrated in an RVC 225 CD rotational vacuum concentrator (Martin Christ
GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany).
Fluorescent labeling of RNA

Extra amine groups were incorporated into the tmRNAs
during in vitro transcription by adding aaUTP. The
amine-modified RNA was further labeled with the monoreactive fluorescent dye Cyanine™ 3-NHS (Cy3) (Enzo,
Farmingdale, NY, USA). Cy3 (50 nmole) was diluted in 2
μl DMSO (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) and added
to tmRNA diluted in 7 μl 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 9.0). The
mixture of RNA and dye was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the remaining excess Cy3 label was
quenched by adding 3.5 μl 4 M H2NOH. After the coupling reaction, 35 μl 100 mM sodium acetate was added
to neutralize the solution. The labeled RNA was purified
with a NucleoSpin® Kit and dehydrated in an RVC 2-25
CD concentrator.

Streptococcus pneumoniae-specific microarray

Capture probes on the custom-made S. pneumoniae-specific microarray were designed using SLICSel 1.0 software http://bioinfo.ut.ee/slicsel. SLICSel is a program for
designing specific oligonucleotide probes for detecting
and identifying microbes. To ensure maximal probe specificity, SLICSel uses the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic
model to calculate hybridization affinities for the
intended target and non-target sequences. The microarray consisted of three Streptococcus family-specific and
94 S. pneumoniae species-specific probes covering almost
the full length of the 335 nucleotide tmRNA molecule.
Probe length varied between 9 and 26 nucleotides (average 16), melting temperature (Tm) between 53°C and
60°C (average 58°C) and binding energies (ΔG) with complementary tmRNA were predicted to be between -17
kcal/mol and -30 kcal/mol (average -23 kcal/mol) at 45°C
and in 50 mM salt [Additional file 1]. In addition, 21
probes specific for other bacterial tmRNA sequences
were designed to test the specificity of hybridization. The
other bacteria included five further members of the
Streptococcus family (Groups A, B, C, D and G), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
All the probes designed were tested using Mfold http://
mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu[29,30] to exclude those with potential secondary structures, and MegaBlast http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/megablast.shtml[31]
to
eliminate possible cross-hybridization with unwanted
targets, including tmRNAs from other species, bacterial
DNA/RNA and human genomic DNA or RNA
sequences. Three extra control probes with complementary fluorescent targets (spikes) were designed for normalization.
Microarray
probes
with
5'amino
modifications and C6 spacers were diluted in 100 mM
Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) to 50 μM final concentration
and spotted on to SAL-1 Ultra microarray slides in Asper

Biotech Ltd., Tartu, Estonia. Each slide contained four
datapoints because two identical subgrids were spotted
with duplicate spots.
Chaperone design

tmRNA molecules fold into complex structures of
pseudoknots, tRNA-like regions and mRNA-like regions.
A set of helper oligonucleotides ("chaperones") was
designed with SLICSel to reduce the difficulty of hybridizing certain inaccessible regions of tmRNA. Six different
chaperones were designed to bind to predicted secondary
structure regions in S. pneumoniae tmRNA and prevent
those intramolecular interactions (Figure 4). The complete set of chaperones is shown in Table 1. All the
microarray probes, spike-s and chaperones used in the
current work were ordered from Metabion, Mariensried,
Germany.
Microarray experiment

One pmol of labeled RNA was resuspended in 80 μl
microarray hybridization buffer (6× SSC; 0.5% SDS and
5× Denhardt's solution) together with spike-s (0.25 nM
each). The hybridization mixture was heat-denaturated at
95°C for 5 min and snap-cooled on ice. The RNA hybridization melting curve was obtained by incubating for 4 h
at temperatures ranging from 34°C to 70°C. Helper oligonucleotide experiments were conducted at 34°C with 10,
100 or 1000 pmol of chaperones added (making the ratios
of tmRNA:chaperone ratios in solution = 1:10; 1:100;
1:1000); an equal amount of RNAse-free water (Macherey-Nagel) was added to the controls without chaperones. The effect of each helper oligonucleotide,
individually and in a mixture of all six chaperones, was
investigated. To determine the effect of hybridization
time, RNA with chaperones was hybridized on to the
microarray slides for 2-12 h. All hybridization experi-

from different arrays by equating the average of the spikespecific signals from each microarray.
Secondary structure prediction

An RNA/DNA folding package mFold was used to determine the tmRNA secondary structure. All degenerate
nucleotides in the S. pneumoniae tmRNA sequence were
