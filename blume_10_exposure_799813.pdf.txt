Abstract
Background: The function of the cortical microtubules, composed of ab-tubulin heterodimers, is linked to their
organizational state which is subject to spatial and temporal modulation by environmental cues. The role of
tubulin posttranslational modifications in these processes is largely unknown. Although antibodies against small
tubulin regions represent useful tool for studying molecular configuration of microtubules, data on the exposure of
tubulin epitopes on plant microtubules are still limited.
Results: Using homology modeling we have generated an Arabidopsis thaliana microtubule protofilament model
that served for the prediction of surface exposure of five b-tubulin epitopes as well as tyrosine residues. Peptide
scans newly disclosed the position of epitopes detected by antibodies 18D6 (b1-10), TUB2.1 (b426-435) and TU-14
(b436-445). Experimental verification of the results by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the exposure
of epitopes depended on the mode of fixation. Moreover, homology modeling showed that only tyrosines in the
C-terminal region of b-tubulins (behind b425) were exposed on the microtubule external side.
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules in plant cells, implying that
b-tubulins could be one of the targets for tyrosine kinases.
Conclusions: We predicted surface exposure of five b-tubulin epitopes, as well as tyrosine residues, on the surface
of A. thaliana microtubule protofilament model, and validated the obtained results by immunofluorescence
microscopy on cortical microtubules in cells.
The results suggest that prediction of epitope exposure on microtubules by means of homology modeling combined with site-directed antibodies can contribute to a better understanding of the interactions of plant microtubules with associated proteins.

Background
Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers essential for various cell functions such as intracellular organization, ordered vesicle transport, cell division and
establishment of cell polarity. In higher plants, several
distinct microtubular arrays have been identified, namely
the interphase cortical array, preprophase band, mitotic
spindle and phragmoplast [1]. The basic building blocks
of microtubules are heterodimers of globular a- and
b-tubulin subunits. They are arranged in a head-to-tail

fashion to form 13 protofilaments that constitute cylindrical microtubules with outer diameter around 25 nm
[2]. In A. thaliana tubulin subunits are encoded by
small gene families, six for a-tubulin [3] and nine for
b-tubulin [4]. It has been proposed that the function of
microtubules is modulated by highly diverse posttranslational modifications of tubulin dimers [5].
A major advance step in understanding the microtubule function is marked by the solution of its structure,
based on docking the high-resolution structure of brain
tubulin, studied by electron crystallography [6,7], into
lower-resolution microtubule maps imaged by electron
cryomicroscopy [8-10]. The microtubular surface displays
a surprisingly large number of binding sites, with

numerous proteins binding to the outside surface and a
multitude of small ligands binding to the inside of microtubules [11]. Some structural interactions with other
molecules including nucleotides, drugs, microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins were predicted [2]. Microtubule models also provide the opportunity to predict the surface location of small antibody
epitopes, as well as posttranslationally modified amino
acids residues. Antibodies with binding sites on microtubule surface make it possible to study interaction
between microtubules and interacting proteins, including
tubulin modifying enzymes, in resting cells or cells activated by extracellular stimuli. Site-directed antibodies
can also be used for detection of conformation changes
in microtubules due to the presence of flexible tubulin
domains [12,13]. In spite of a growing number of available anti-tubulin antibodies, data on location of epitopes
on native microtubules outside the C-terminal regions of
tubulin subunits are very limited. Comparative (homology) modeling makes it possible to predict the structures
of proteins with similar sequences [14]; homology modeling of tubulin subunits was used for calculation of discernible differences in tubulin biophysical properties [15]
and for a rational design of plant herbicides [16]. However, plant microtubule models were, so far, not reported.
Previously we have found fixation-dependent exposure
of tubulin epitopes in N. tabacum microtubules [17],
and phosphorylation of N. tabacum tubulin on tyrosine
[18]. However, important questions remained unresolved, namely whether or not cellular microtubules can
be phosphorylated and what consequences it might have
for microtubular integrity. Furthermore, the function of
microtubules in cells responding to extracellular stimuli
might be better understood with more knowledge on
how the predictions of b-tubulin epitopes and phosphotyrosine locations derived from microtubule model correlate with their exposure in cells.
Here we report on the correlation between localization
of small b-tubulin regions on A. thaliana microtubule
protofilament model and their exposure on cortical
microtubules in cells.

Results
Epitope mapping

Brain tubulin, which can be prepared to a very high
degree of purity, is a useful source for epitope mapping.
Previous experiments have shown that antibodies TU-14
[19] and TUB 2.1 [20] recognize epitopes in the C-terminal structural domain of porcine brain b-tubulin, while
antibody 18.D6 recognizes epitope in the N-terminal
region of the molecule [21]. It is known that specific
chemical proteolysis (by means of 75% formic acid) of
aspartic-proline bonds generates a small number of proteolytic fragments in tubulin dimers [22]. We therefore

analysed by immunoblotting porcine brain b-tubulin
fragments after formic acid cleavage, using anti-b-tubulin antibodies with known epitope location as markers.
b-Tubulin has two aspartic-proline bonds at positions
b31-32 and b304-305 (P02554 in the Swiss-Prot
Sequence Database) [23]. Formic acid cleavage generates
5 fragments denoted b1, b2, b3, b1+b2 and b1+b3, as
outlined in Figure 1A. The subunits were effectively
separated by electrophoresis (Figure 1B, lane 1), and the
b-tubulin subunit was isolated from gel by electroelution
(Figure 1B, lane 2). When purified b-tubulin was subjected to formic acid proteolysis, fragments b1+b3, b1
and b2 were discernible after staining the blotted proteins with SYPRO Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Figure 1C,
lane 1). Antibody 18D6, raised against peptide b1-12,
served as a marker of the b1+b3 fragment (Figure 1C,
lane 2), antibody TU-06 recognizing an epitope in the
region b81-95 served as a marker of the b1 fragment

(Figure 1C, lane 3), and antibody TU-12 recognizing an
epitope in the region b426-435 served as a marker of
the b2 fragment (Figure 1C, lane 4). Immunoblotting
with TUB 2.1 antibody revealed reactivity with both b2
and b1+b2 fragments (Figure 1C, lane 5). This indicates
that the corresponding epitope is located in the region
b305-445. Antibody TU-14 also reacted with both b2
and b1+b2 fragments (Figure 1C, lane 6).
Peptide scans of immobilized overlapping peptides were
used for a more accurate epitope location on A. thaliana
b-tubulin. Two peptide scans were selected covering the
regions b1-180 (34 linear 15-meric peptides with 5 amino
acid overlaps) and b171-447 (54 linear 15-meric peptides
with 5 amino acid overlaps) in b-tubulin 1 (TBB1). Results
of immunostaining with the antibodies are shown in Figure 2. Using this approach the epitopes were located in
the following b-tubulin regions: b1-10 (18D6), b81-95
(TU-06), b426-435 (TU-12), b426-435 (TUB 2.1) and
b436-447 (TU-14). The comparison of epitope sequences,
recognized by antibodies, with corresponding consensus
sequences derived from all b-tubulin isotypes of A. thaliana is shown in Table 1. These data demonstrate that epitopes recognized by antibodies 18D6, TU-06 and TU-12/
TUB 2.1 are highly conserved and are present in all btubulin isotypes. Less conserved is the C-terminal region,

Page 3 of 10

b436-447, where the epitope recognized by antibody TU14 is located. Collectively taken, the data demonstrate that
the identified b-tubulin epitopes are conserved and present in A. thaliana b-tubulins.
Location of b-tubulin epitopes on a model of A. thaliana
microtubule protofilaments and in cells

The position of tubulin dimers in microtubule wall is
known for brain tubulin [8,9]. Homology modeling of A.
thaliana microtubules revealed that epitopes 18D6 and
TU-06 are exposed to the lumen of microtubules,
whereas epitopes for antibodies TU-12/TUB 2.1 and
TU-14 are on the external side of microtubules exposed
to cytoplasm. Exposures of the epitopes on A. thaliana
microtubule protofilaments are depicted in Figure 3.
Amino acids that were expected to be exposed on
microtubular surface are highlighted in Table 1.
To verify the predicted location of epitopes on microtubules, immunofluorescence experiments were performed on fixed and unfixed detergent-extracted
samples prepared from A. thaliana seedlings. All tested
anti-b-tubulin antibodies stained microtubules in aldehyde-fixed A. thaliana seedlings. The antibodies decorated typical microtubule structures appearing during
the cell cycle (interphase microtubules, preprophase
band, mitotic spindle and phragmoplast). The antibodies
stained microtubules along their whole length, and no
differences among individual antibodies were detected.
TU-06 failed to stain microtubules on unfixed detergent-extracted cells, in contrast to other antibodies that
did stain all microtubule structures. Staining of interphase cortical microtubules in fixed and unfixed

protofilaments.

different fixation conditions is demonstrated for antibodies 18D6 and TU-06 (Figure 4A-D). The absence of
reactivity with TU-06 could not be attributed to the lack
of microtubules, since it was still possible to visualize
microtubules by polyclonal anti-tubulin antibody (not
shown). The reactivity of antibodies with A. thaliana
microtubules are summarized in Table 2. These data
demonstrate that epitopes TU-12/TUB 2.1 and TU-14,

located in the C-terminal structural domain of b-tubulin
and predicted to be on the microtubule surface, are
indeed available for antibody staining in unfixed plant
cells. On the other hand, TU-06 epitope exposed to the
microtubule lumen was not accessible for antibody
binding in unfixed microtubules, but fixation made the
exposure of that epitope possible. Interestingly, the
18D6 epitope, located on the very N-terminal end of
b-tubulin and also predicted to be exposed towards the
microtubular lumen, was available for antibody binding
in unfixed preparations.
Exposure of phosphotyrosines on microtubules

The screening, by means of DS Visualizer program, of
tyrosine residues exposed in A. thaliana microtubule
model disclosed that only tyrosines 426 and 437 out of
the 16 tyrosine residues present in consensus sequence
of all b-tubulin isotypes were completely exposed on the
outer side of microtubule surface. Besides, tyrosines at
positions 439, 444, 445, 447 and 451, present only on

some b-tubulin isotypes, were found to be part of the
flexible C-terminal tail. Thus, they too are exposed on
the microtubular external side (Additional file 1).
To test whether or not plant microtubules can carry
phosphorylation on tubulin tyrosine residues exposed on
the outer side of microtubules, we have performed double-label staining experiments on unfixed detergentextracted A. thaliana microtubules using polyclonal
anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr) and monoclonal
anti-b-tubulin antibody (TUB 2.1). Staining was also
performed on seedlings pretreated for 40 min with 2.5
mM sodium orthovanadate. This compound is a potent
inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, and proteins
are therefore retained in their phosphorylated state.
While the signal detected with anti-phosphotyrosine
antibody in untreated samples was low (Figure 5C),
staining was markedly enhanced if the cells were pretreated with sodium orthovanadate (Figure 5D). Doublelabel staining with anti-b-tubulin antibody confirmed
that microtubules were preserved (Figures 5A and 5B),
and phosphotyrosine labeling correlated with cortical
microtubules in interphase cells (Figure 5F). Similar

and phosphotyrosine. Preparations of primary root epidermal cells,
preincubated without (A, C, E) or with (B, D, F) sodium
orthovanadate (SO) to inhibit phosphatases were stained with
monoclonal antibody TUB 2.1 to b-tubulin (A-B) and polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody P-Tyr (C-D). Figures A, C, E and B, D, F

staining pattern with P-Tyr was observed when
untreated or sodium orthovanadate-treated samples
were fixed before immunostaining. Moreover, clear
staining of mitotic spindles was also observed in fixed
samples pretreated with sodium orthovanadate (not
shown). These data suggest that plant microtubules can
be modified by tyrosine phosphorylation and that tyrosine residues located in the C-terminal region of b-tubulin isotypes, exposed on microtubule surface, could be
phosphorylated.

Discussion
Homology modeling has been used for specification of
some biophysical properties of tubulin isotypes [15], as
well as for a rational design of microtubule inhibitors
[16]. We made use of this approach to predict the exposure of b-tubulin epitopes and tyrosine residues on the
surface of A. thaliana microtubules. Here, we report on
three novel findings: (1) Identification of phylogenetically conserved b-tubulin epitopes recognized by wellestablished monoclonal antibodies. (2) Docking of epitopes into A. thaliana microtubule model and confirmation of predicted localization by staining of cellular
microtubules. (3) Prediction of tyrosine exposure on the
outer side of A. thaliana microtubule wall and experimental verification of microtubule phosphorylation on
tyrosine in cells.
We confirmed the localization of epitopes for antibodies TU-06 (b81-95) [24] and TU-12 (b426-435) [25],
previously determined on porcine brain tubulin, using
A. thaliana overlapping b-tubulin peptides. We
improved the accuracy of localization for epitopes
recognized by antibodies 18D6 (b1-10), TUB 2.1 (b426435) and TU-14 (b436-447). Out of this panel, antibodies TU-06, TU-12 and TUB2.1 are commercially available and are supplied by various vendors. Whereas the
amino acid sequences in the regions b1-10 and b81-95
are highly homologous in all eight b-tubulin isotypes of
A. thaliana, there are differences in the C-terminal
regions of b-tubulin isotypes demonstrated by their
amino acid alignment (Additional file 1). This indicates
that the distribution of epitopes recognized by antibodies TU-12, TUB 2.1 and TU-14 might be restricted just
to some isotypes. Identification of minimal peptides that
bind to the antibodies is necessary before making final
conclusions about the distribution of epitopes on individual b-tubulin isotypes. On the other hand, antibodies
18D6 and TU-06 represent general probes that ought to
recognize all A. thaliana isotypes. As known posttranslational modifications of b-tubulin isotypes are located
in the C-terminal domains [5,26], modifications should
not impair the reactivity of these antibodies. 18D6 and
TU-06 could be therefore useful for detection of all
b-tubulin charge variants (isoforms) generated by

Blume et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/29

combination of different b-tubulin isotypes and their
posttranslational modifications.
Since the sequence alignment of porcine and A. thaliana b-tubulin isotypes revealed approximately 85%
sequence identity, it is reasonable to assume that homology modeling based on known structure of bovine brain
tubulin [6] combined with the high resolution model of
microtubules [8,9] produces a model of A. thaliana
microtubule protofilaments acceptable with a high
degree of confidence. This enabled to position the
b-tubulin epitopes into A. thaliana microtubule wall,
and to localize those amino acid residues that are
exposed on the inner or outer surface of microtubules.
While decoration of unfixed cellular microtubules was
in good agreement with the predicted epitope docking
for antibodies TU-06, TU-12, TUB 2.1 and TU-14, decoration of unfixed microtubules with antibody 18D6 was
surprising. The 18D6 epitope in protofilament model was
positioned in the microtubule interior facing the lumen,
so one would expect that it will be obscured on unfixed
microtubules. In addition, it has been demonstrated previously that microinjected 18D6 antibody did not decorate microtubules in animal CHO-K1 cells, if the cells
were prior to fixation extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100
in microtubule stabilizing buffer [21]. When taxol was
excluded during preparation of unfixed samples, staining
of microtubules with 18D6 antibody was reduced (Additional file 2). An altering effect of taxol on the arrangement of tubulin protofilaments was reported [27,28]. We
thus propose that the exposure of 18D6 epitope on
unfixed A. thaliana microtubules might be caused by
conformation changes generated by taxol used for stabilization of microtubules. Interestingly, only three out of
the ten amino acids of the 18D6 epitope are exposed on
the interior surface of microtubules (Table 1); this indicates that the N-terminal b-tubulin region is important
for antibody binding to microtubules.
On the other hand, finding that epitopes 18D6 and
TU-06, located on the inner site of microtubule wall,
appeared after fixation of microtubules was no surprise.
It is well documented that different fixation conditions
influence the exposure of tubulin epitopes both in animal [29] and plant microtubules [17]. Since tubulin subunits have flexible domains [30], even “mild” fixation
with 0.2% formaldehyde can affect the exposure of epitopes on microtubules [13]. It was suggested that
changes in the conformation of tubulin by fixation influence the interaction between protofilaments, and can
consequently lead to an exposure of epitopes in the
lumen of microtubules, as was demonstrated for acetylated lysine a40 [13]. Conformation changes in protofilaments were reported after binding of the motor
proteins to microtubules [31,32]. Our results strengthen
the hypothesis that the way samples are prepared can

Page 6 of 10

substantially influence the results obtained in cells, and
a good deal of caution must be used when predicting
locations inferred from microtubule models.
Previously we have shown that plant tubulin is phosphorylated on tyrosine [18]; however, data on tyrosine
phosphorylation of microtubules in plant cells are missing. Homology modeling in A. thaliana revealed that
tyrosines in the C-terminal region of b-tubulin isotypes
(behind b425) are exposed on the microtubule outer
side and might therefore become likely targets for tyrosine kinases. In the case of a-tubulin isotypes, homology
modeling disclosed that out of the total of 17 tyrosine
residues only the C-terminal tyrosine a450 was completely exposed on the surface of microtubules (Additional
file 1). To verify that tyrosines on polymerized microtubules are indeed phosphorylated, immunofluorescence
experiments were carried out with unfixed cells. The
results showed that the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody
decorated microtubules. While the steady-state level of
microtubule phosphorylation on tyrosine was low, phosphorylation of microtubules was clearly visible in cells
pretreated with sodium orthovanadate, a factor which
shifts the equilibrium to the phosphorylation state.
Although one cannot exclude that the tyrosines partly
buried in the microtubule wall are exposed to phosphorylation after binding of kinases to microtubules, it seems
reasonable to assume that phosphorylation on tyrosines
could occur in the C-terminal regions of polymerized
tubulins. Since immunoblotting after 2D-PAGE separation of isolated N. tabacum tubulin clearly confirmed
phosphorylation of both subunits [18], we suggest that
b-tubulin as well as a-tubulin isotypes in A. thaliana
microtubules might be phosphorylated. MAPs could
also be phosphorylated on tyrosine in sodium orthovanadate-treated cells. However, MAPs are less abundant
than tubulin in microtubule preparations isolated from
plant extracts, and show usually punctuate localization
in cortical A. thaliana microtubules [33]. In contrast, we
have observed a uniform staining along the microtubules with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in fixed cells.
This indicates that anti-phosphotyrosine antibody might
stain tubulin. However, further studies are necessary to
confirm this assumption.
It is well established that the C-terminal domains of
tubulins in polymerized microtubules can be posttranslationally modified [26] and bind MAPs [2]. The physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of
microtubules is unknown, but it can possibly modulate
the binding of MAPs or motor proteins. In addition, it
might modulate the function of microtubules in
response to extracellular stimuli. Cellular microtubules
can provide a matrix upon which the signaling molecules are arrayed [34]. Tyrosine phosphorylation
of tubulin in microtubule polymer might affect the cell

Blume et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/29

signaling by enhancing the Src-homology 2 (SH2)
domain-mediated interaction between microtubules and
signaling molecules. Syk-dependent phosphorylation of
microtubules during activation of B-lymphocytes was
described [35]. The Syk kinase belongs to protein tyrosine kinases of Syk/ZAP family, and tubulin is one of
the proteins in animal cells identified as a likely substrate for Syk in vivo [36]. It is worth mentioning that
ZAP-like kinases were identified by bioinformatics
homology analysis in plant cells (Y.B. Blume unpublished result). Recent experiments with tyrosine kinase
and phosphatase inhibitors identified tyrosine phosphorylation as an important factor in overall organization of
microtubules in A. thaliana root cells [37].

confirmed for all anti-b-tubulin antibodies used in this
study [17,21,39]. Microtubules were also visualized by
affinity purified rabbit antibody to tubulin [38]. Mouse
monoclonal antibody VI-01 (IgM) to vertebrate vimentin
[40] was used as a negative control. Rabbit antibody to
phosphotyrosine was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake
Placid, NY, USA). Anti-mouse antibody conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Promega
Biotech (Madison, WI, USA). Anti-mouse antibodies
conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or
indocarbocyanate (Cy3), and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with FITC were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA).

Conclusions
Using homology modeling we have generated an Arabidopsis thaliana microtubule protofilament model that
served for the prediction of surface exposure of five btubulin epitopes, as well as tyrosine residues. Peptide
scans newly disclosed the position of epitopes detected
by antibodies 18D6 (b1-10), TUB2.1 (b426-435) and
TU-14 (b436-445). Experimental verification of obtained
results by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that
the exposure of epitopes was dependent on fixation.
Moreover, homology modeling showed that only tyrosines located in the C-terminal region of b-tubulins
(behind b425) are exposed on the microtubule outer
side. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules in plant cells, and
b-tubulins could thus be one of the targets for tyrosine
kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubules may
affect their capability to interact with associated proteins
in cells responding to extracellular stimuli. The data
also demonstrate that however useful the homology
modeling may be for the prediction of amino acid exposure on microtubule surface, it has to be corroborated
by experimental verification.
Methods
Antibodies

The following mouse monoclonal antibodies to b-tubulin were used: TU-12 (IgM) recognizes an epitope
located in the b426-435 region [25] of the C-terminal
structural domain [38]; TU-14 (IgM) recognizes an epitope located in the isotype-defining region [19] of the
C-terminal structural domain; TU-06 (IgM) recognizes
an epitope located in the b81-95 region [24] of the Nterminal structural domain of b-tubulin [29]; TUB 2.1
(IgG1) (Sigma, Prague, Czech Republic) recognizes an
epitope located in the C-terminal structural domain of
b-tubulin [20]; 18D6 (IgG1) was raised against the Nterminal peptide of b-tubulin (b1-12) [21]. Absence of
any cross-reactivity with a-tubulin has previously been

Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia 0 ecotype)
were grown under sterile conditions on a half strength
Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing vitamins
(Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands), supplemented with 10
g/L sucrose and solidified with 4 g/L Gelrite (Duchefa)
at pH 5.7. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the dishes
were placed vertically in a growth chamber at 22°C in a
16/8 h (light/dark) photoperiod. Four-day-old seedlings
were used for experiments.
Protein preparation and epitope mapping

Microtubule protein from porcine brain was prepared by
three temperature-dependent cycles of assembly and disassembly according to Shelanski [41]. Tubulin free of
microtubule-associated proteins was obtained by phosphocellulose chromatography [42], and was stored in
small aliquots in liquid nitrogen. To separate a- and btubulin subunits, tubulin was carboxyamidomethylated
and the subunits were effectively separated by SDSPAGE according to Laemmli using modifications in
separation gel and electrode buffer composition [43].
Subunits were isolated from the gel by electroelution
using Model 422 Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA) according to manufacturer’s directions.
Electroelution was performed in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate containing 0.1% SDS. Eluted proteins were
concentrated in Speed Vac (SAVANT Instruments,
Farmingdale, NY).
Chemical proteolysis of b-tubulin was performed by
dissolving the isolated protein in 75% formic acid and
incubating the solution in the dark at 37°C for 24 h
[22]. After dialysis against water using a dialysis membrane with MWCO 3,500 Daltons, samples were mixed
with five-times concentrated SDS-sample buffer and
analyzed by immunoblotting.
For epitope mapping, the synthetic overlapping peptides (15-meric peptides with 5 amino acid overlaps)
were prepared by SPOT synthesis (Jerini Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany). Each spot carried

approximately 5-nmol peptide covalently bound to the
cellulose-b-alanine membrane. Peptide scans covered
the sequences b1-180 in the N-terminal structural
domain (34 peptides) and b171-447 in the C-terminal
structural domain (53 peptides) of A. thaliana b-tubulin
1 (TBB1, accession number P12411 in the Swiss-Prot
Sequence Database). Epitope mapping was performed
according to the manufacturer’s directions with chemiluminescent detection of bound antibodies.
Preparation of cytoskeletons

Fixation of A. thaliana seedlings was adapted from Le
et al. [44]. All incubation and washing steps were performed at room temperature. Briefly, whole seedlings
of A. thaliana were fixed for 2 h in a freshly prepared
mixture of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.5% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde in PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES-KOH,
pH 7.0, containing 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, 2
mM MgSO4) supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X100 and 0.2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF). After rinsing in PHEM the seedlings were
incubated in 0.1% (w/v) NaBH 4 in PHEM for 15 min
to reduce free aldehydes. Cell wall was digested for 20
min with an enzyme cocktail containing 0.1% (v/v)
pectinase (Sigma) and 0.05% (w/v) pectolyase (Sigma)
in PHEM. Seedlings were washed in PBS and incubated for 20 min in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS to prevent
unspecific binding of antibodies.
To prepare unfixed samples, A. thaliana seedlings
were treated with the enzyme cocktail, washed twice for
10 min in 0.4 M glycerol in PHEM (glycerol/PHEM)
and incubated for 15 min in the same buffer containing
1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mM PMSF and 10 μM taxol
(Sigma). In some cases, taxol was omitted from incubation buffer during preparation of unfixed samples. After
washing in glycerol/PHEM, the cells were used for
immunostaining.
For some experiments, seedlings were pretreated for
40 min at room temperature with 2.5 mM sodium
orthovanadate (Sigma) before preparation of fixed or
unfixed samples, in order to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases. 250 mM sodium orthovanadate stock solution in
H2O was prepared immediately before use [37].

suspension and transferred before examination on glass
coverslips with a small drop of PBS.
For experiments with unfixed cytoskeletons, seedlings
of A. thaliana were incubated for 2.5 h with primary
antibodies diluted in glycerol/PHEM. After washing off
the unbound antibodies by glycerol/PHEM, samples
were fixed for 1.5 h with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in
glycerol/PHEM. Samples were then washed with PHEM
without glycerol and incubated for 1.5 h with secondary
antibody as described above, followed by transfer on
glass coverslips.
For double-label immunofluorescence examination of
fixed or unfixed samples of A. thaliana seedlings, the
rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody P-Tyr (1:100) and
the mouse monoclonal antibody TUB 2.1 (1:100) were
applied simultaneously. FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and
Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were diluted
1:100 and 1:500, respectively.
Preparations of epidermis of A. thaliana primary root
were examined with confocal laser scanning microscope
LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a
Plan-Apochromat 63× oil-immersion objective. FITC
emission was excited using the 488-nm ray of the argon
laser, whereas Cy3 was exited using the 543-nm line of
the helium/neon laser. Emission signals of FITC and
Cy3 were separated by means of META system with,
respectively, BP 505-530 and LP 560 filter.
Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting

Details on the one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrophoretic transfer
of separated proteins onto nitrocellulose, and immunostaining procedure are described elsewhere [45].
SYPRO Ruby Protein Blot Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) was used for the detection of proteins on
nitrocellulose. The antibodies TU-06, TU-12 and TU14 in the form of culture supernatants were diluted
1:5, TUB 2.1 and 18D6 were diluted, respectively,
1:2,000 and 1:10,000. Peroxidase-conjugated antibody
was diluted 1:10,000. Bound antibodies were detected
by SuperSignal WestPico Chemiluminescent reagents
according to manufacturer’s directions (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).

Immunofluorescence microscopy

Microtubule protofilament modeling

All antibody dilutions were made with 0.5% (w/v) BSA
in PBS supplemented with 2 μM leupeptin (Sigma).
Antibodies TU-06, TU-12 and TU-14 in the form of
culture supernatants were diluted 1:50, antibodies TUB
2.1 and 18D6 were diluted 1:100. Fixed samples were
incubated with primary antibodies for 2.5 h, washed 3
times for 5 min in PBS and incubated for 1.5 h with
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:30. A.
thaliana seedlings were incubated with antibodies in

The spatial structure of ab-tubulin heterodimers were
reconstructed by the homology modeling method [46]
using a previously described procedure [47]. For spatial
model development, A. thaliana amino acid sequences
corresponding to tubulin alpha-1 chain (P11139; SwissProt Sequence Database) and tubulin beta-1 chain
(P12411; Swiss-Prot Sequence Database) were applied.
Preliminary geometry optimization of dimer spatial
structure was calculated by the L-BFGS method [48]

Blume et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/29

using the mdrun module of GROMACS software [49].
Spatial organization of tubulin protofilaments was computed using serial translation of the heterodimer along
microtubule axis on a distance of 79.4 Å. Relative
arrangement of protofilaments in microtubule was
reconstructed by serial geometric transformations
including protofilament axial rotation by 14 degrees and
protofilament shift angularly of 10 degrees on a distance
of 53 Å. Spatial structures of calculated longitudinal and
lateral contact interfaces were refined to known data
about amino acid residues which can be involved in
forming the appropriate contacts [8,9]. Data visualization and analysis of spatial localization of antibody epitopes were done using the DS Visualizer 2.0 software
(Accelrys Software Inc., Cambridge, United Kingdom).
