Abstract
Background: Action potential generation in excitable cells such as myocytes and neurons critically
depends on voltage-gated sodium channels. In mammals, sodium channels exist as macromolecular
complexes that include a pore-forming alpha subunit and 1 or more modulatory beta subunits. Although
alpha subunit genes have been cloned from diverse metazoans including flies, jellyfish, and humans, beta
subunits have not previously been identified in any non-mammalian species. To gain further insight into the
evolution of electrical signaling in vertebrates, we investigated beta subunit genes in the teleost Danio rerio
(zebrafish).
Results: We identified and cloned single zebrafish gene homologs for beta1-beta3 (zbeta1-zbeta3) and
duplicate genes for beta4 (zbeta4.1, zbeta4.2). Sodium channel beta subunit loci are similarly organized in
fish and mammalian genomes. Unlike their mammalian counterparts, zbeta1 and zbeta2 subunit genes
display extensive alternative splicing. Zebrafish beta subunit genes and their splice variants are
differentially-expressed in excitable tissues, indicating tissue-specific regulation of zbeta1-4 expression and
splicing. Co-expression of the genes encoding zbeta1 and the zebrafish sodium channel alpha subunit
Nav1.5 in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells increased sodium current and altered channel gating,
demonstrating functional interactions between zebrafish alpha and beta subunits. Analysis of the synteny
and phylogeny of mammalian, teleost, amphibian, and avian beta subunit and related genes indicated that
all extant vertebrate beta subunits are orthologous, that beta2/beta4 and beta1/beta3 share common
ancestry, and that beta subunits are closely related to other proteins sharing the V-type immunoglobulin
domain structure. Vertebrate sodium channel beta subunit genes were not identified in the genomes of
invertebrate chordates and are unrelated to known subunits of the para sodium channel in Drosophila.
Conclusion: The identification of conserved orthologs to all 4 voltage-gated sodium channel beta subunit
genes in zebrafish and the lack of evidence for beta subunit genes in invertebrate chordates together
indicate that this gene family emerged early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of teleosts and
tetrapods. The evolutionary history of sodium channel beta subunits suggests that these genes may have
played a key role in the diversification and specialization of electrical signaling in early vertebrates.

Background
Coordinated electrical signals in the metazoan nervous
system, heart, and skeletal muscle depend on the generation of action potentials, rapid changes in membrane
potential mediated by the passage of ions through voltage-gated ion channels [1]. The initial upstroke of the
action potential in most excitable cells is determined by
sodium channels, membrane proteins characterized by
rapid activation and inactivation and high ionic conductance [1-3]. Unlike evolutionarily-ancient, tetrameric
potassium channels, sodium channels are comprised of
four homologous domains that are encoded by a single
polypeptide [1-3]. Sodium channels are suspected to have
evolved from structurally-similar calcium channels, which
in turn likely arose following the duplication of potassium channel genes [1-3]. The use of sodium as a conducting ion rather than calcium is thought to have permitted
rapid conduction and high-frequency electrical signaling
in the rudimentary nervous systems of early multicellular
animals, without the numerous additional intracellular
effects mediated by calcium's role as a second messenger
[1,4].
In mammals, voltage-gated sodium channels are multiprotein complexes that include a pore-forming α subunit
and 1 or more modulatory β subunits [5-9]. While
sodium channel α subunits are large proteins with 24
membrane-spanning domains, β subunits are smaller
proteins with a single transmembrane domain and an
extracellular V-type immunoglobulin (IG)-like motif [1014]. Ten distinct α subunit genes (SCNxA) and 4 β subunit
genes (SCN1B-4B) have been cloned from mammals, and
all have been functionally expressed with the exception of
SCN7A [2,3,15]. While heterologous expression of α subunit genes alone can reconstitute key properties of voltage-gated sodium channels observed in native tissues, coexpression with β subunit genes modifies channel gating
and increases channel cell surface expression [10-13].
Studies of mice with targeted ablation of either β1 or β2
genes corroborated these roles for β subunits in vivo and
revealed an additional function for β subunits in α subunit localization [16,17]. Moreover, the unique expression
profiles of each β subunit gene and their variable effects
on α subunit function, expression, and localization suggest that different subunit combinations in heart, brain,
and muscle may contribute to diversity and specialization
in electrical signaling [18,19].
The physiological importance of sodium channel α and β
subunits is reinforced by their role in human disease.
Mutations that cause even subtle changes in sodium channel α subunit function may result in severe human disease
phenotypes including epilepsy and arrhythmia [20]. To
date, mutations in 7 α subunit genes (SCN1A, SCN2A,
SCN3A, SCN4A, SCN5A, SCN8A, SCN9A) have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/113

linked to human disease [21-27]. Given their important
modulatory effects on the expression and function of
sodium channel α subunits, β subunits are also important
candidate genes for human diseases related to sodium
channel dysfunction. β1 subunit gene mutations are a
cause of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus
(GEFS+), and variants in sodium channel α subunits that
disrupt their interaction with β subunits may be pathological in the heart [28-31]. More recently, a mutation in the
β4 subunit gene was implicated as a cause of the Long QT
syndrome, a congenital arrhythmia [32].
The relatively large number of distinct mammalian
sodium channel α subunit isoforms has generated great
interest in the evolution of this gene family, particularly
since invertebrate genomes contain far fewer conserved
Nav1 sodium channel genes [33-36]. The physical linkage
of voltage-gated sodium channel genes to the 4 homeobox (HOX) gene clusters suggests that polyploidization at
least partly contributed to the emergence of multiple
ancestral sodium channel genes in early vertebrates [3739]. Moreover, the clustering of closely-related sodium
channel genes in mammalian genomes (e.g. SCN1A,
SCN2A, and SCN3A on human chromosome 2) is consistent with the hypothesis that several of the 10 mammalian
isoforms arose following tandem duplication of ancestral
vertebrate genes [36-39]. Since fish and mammals possess
different numbers of sodium channel isoforms, the duplication of ancestral vertebrate sodium channel genes is suspected to have occurred independently in teleost and
tetrapod lineages [38]. Expansion of the sodium channel
gene family by tandem duplication may also have
occurred uniquely in tetrapods, since the complement of
sodium channel genes in teleosts appears to have resulted
from whole-genome duplication [40,41].
The unique electrophysiological properties, expression
patterns, and physiological roles of mammalian sodium
channel α subunits suggest that the duplication of these
genes may have been an adaptation that permitted the
diversification and functional specialization of electrical
signaling in vertebrates [1,39,42]. The physical interaction
of α subunits with auxiliary proteins such as β subunits
that modify their expression or function may have been
similarly adaptive [36,37]. Although sodium channel β
subunits have not previously been identified in nonmammalian species, we hypothesize that a sodium channel macromolecular complex comprised of α subunits
and auxiliary β subunits is an evolutionarily-conserved
structural entity. Evidence for the emergence of sodium
channel β subunit genes early in vertebrate evolution
would be consistent with the idea that these genes may
have played a role in diversifying and fine-tuning electrical signaling not only in mammals but in all vertebrates.

Here we report the identification and molecular cloning
of conserved orthologs of all 4 mammalian β subunit
genes in Danio rerio (zebrafish), a teleost vertebrate and a
popular developmental and physiological model system.
By direct sequence analysis and alignment, we assessed
whether zebrafish β subunits possess the structural hallmarks of their mammalian counterparts. We provide evidence for extensive splicing of zebrafish beta subunit
genes and demonstrate their expression in excitable tissues. To determine whether zebrafish sodium channel α
and β subunits functionally interact, we studied sodium
currents generated by the co-expression of the genes
encoding zNav1.5 (α subunit) and zβ1 in a heterologous
cell system. Finally, we assessed the synteny and phylogeny of β subunits and a group of closely-related genes with
IG domains in several vertebrate species. Our findings
strongly suggest that all 4 voltage-gated sodium channel β
subunit genes emerged early in vertebrate evolution, and
support the concept that the voltage-gated sodium channel α-β subunit macromolecular complex is a conserved
and functionally-important vertebrate innovation.

Results

Identification and cloning of zebrafish sodium channel β
subunit genes
We identified 5 distinct zebrafish β subunit gene loci by
mining the draft zebrafish genome sequence (ensembl
Zv2-4) for genes homologous to the human and mouse
β1- β4 genes. In silico prediction of coding sequence on
the relevant genomic DNA contigs enabled us to amplify
partial β subunit gene sequences for each locus by RT-PCR
and subsequently complete the full-length zebrafish β
subunit clones by rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE)-PCR. Analysis of putative open reading frames
within each cDNA sequence predicted proteins ranging
from 220–232 amino acids in length. Deduced translation and alignment of the five zebrafish amino acid
sequences with each mammalian β subunit protein
sequence suggested the identities of these genes (Figs. 1A,
2A, 3A, 4A). While single homologs were identified for
the genes encoding β1-β3 (zβ1-zβ3), zebrafish express two
distinct but closely-related β4 genes (zβ4.1, zβ4.2). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of zebrafish β1, β2, β3,
β4.1, and β4.2 with their human homologs indicated that
these proteins share 53.4%, 49.6%, 51.1%, 43.2%, and
40.8% identity, respectively.
Conserved features of zebrafish sodium channel β subunits
Mammalian sodium channel β subunits possess a single
transmembrane domain, a short intracellular carboxyl Cterminal tail, a cleavable amine (N)-terminal signal peptide, and a conserved V-type extracellular IG motif that
most closely resembles the type found in cell-adhesion
molecules [14,43]. Hydropathy analysis of zebrafish β
subunit amino acid sequences using TMpred software

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/113

revealed that all 5 proteins are likely to possess cleavable
N-terminal signal peptides and single transmembrane
domains (additional file 1). To assess the presence of an
extracellular V-type IG domain, we first analyzed each
zebrafish beta subunit amino acid sequence with the
NCBI conserved domain database. By this method, all 5
zebrafish β subunit genes are predicted to possess V-type
extracellular IG domains (additional file 2). To more rigorously analyze these predictions, we manually examined
the amino acid sequence of each zebrafish β subunit for
the V-type IG domain consensus sequence (annotated
beneath alignments, Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A). With the exception of a conservative tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y > F)
substitution in zβ1 and a non-polar methionine to basic
lysine residue substitution (M > K) in zβ3 (illustrated in
red text in Figs. 1A and 3A), all 5 zebrafish β subunits
exhibit 100% conservation of the consensus sequence for
V-type IG domains [14,43]. Typical of this domain is the
linkage of 2 cysteine residues in a disulfide bridge (DS*,
Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A), the structural importance of which
was revealed by a mutation that results in familial epilepsy [28]. A second putative disulfide bridge that may
further stabilize the extracellular IG domain in β1 and β3
is suggested of the crystal structure of myelin protein zero
(MPZ), the primary structural protein of peripheral nerve
myelin, whose IG domain closely resembles that found in
sodium channel β subunits [12,43,44]. The cysteine residues that contribute to proposed second bridge are conserved in zβ1 and zβ3 (DS, Figs. 1A, 3A). Similar to
mammalian β2 and β4, zβ2 and zβ4 proteins do not possess this second disulfide bridge but have an unpaired
cysteine residue that may underlie covalent interactions
with partnering sodium channel α subunits (S-, Figs. 2A,
4A) [5,11,13].
In addition to V-type IG domains, our sequence analysis
indicated that other functional and/or structural domains
are conserved in zebrafish β subunits (Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A,
4A). These include a tyrosine in β1 that is phosphorylated
and regulates interactions with ankyrin G (Y181 or Y200
with signal peptide intact) [45], the C-terminal tyrosineleucine-alanine-isoleucine (Y-L-A-I) internalization motif
in β1 and β3 which may be recognized by clathrin-coated
pits [12], and a juxtatransmembrane gamma-secretase
cleavage site in β2 that may play a role in cell adhesion or
the movement of cells expressing this subunit [46].
Zebrafish β subunits are also likely to exhibit post-translational modification by amide nitrogen (N)-linked glycosylation, a key feature of all 4 mammalian β subunits [1013]. The zβ1 protein possesses 2 of 4 predicted N-linked
glycosylation sites found in human or rat β1 in addition
to exhibiting two unique sites (Fig. 1A). Similarly, zβ2
conserves 3 of 4 sites, zβ3 conserves 1 of 3 sites and displays 2 novel sites, zβ4.1 conserves 4 sites and displays 1

novel site, and zβ4.2 conserves 3 of four sites and displays
3 novel sites (Figs. 2A, 3A, 4A).
Comparative genomics of β subunit gene variants
The conservation of amino acid residues between homologous genes in distantly-related species may uncover previously unappreciated regions of functional importance
and facilitate the evaluation of novel human mutations
and polymorphisms. To determine whether previously
identified mutations and polymorphisms are conserved
in zebrafish β subunit genes, we mapped these variants
onto the alignments of mammalian and zebrafish β subunit amino acid sequences. Four mutations in the human
β1 gene have been linked to the heritable epilepsy syndrome GEFS+, the first resulting in a 5 amino acid deletion from isoleucine at position 70 to glutamic acid at
position 74 (I70_E74del), the second in substitution of a
cysteine residue that participates in a disulfide bridge
(C121W), and the third and fourth resulting in substitution of an arginine at position 85 for either a cysteine or a
histidine, respectively (R85C, R85H) [28,47,48]. All of
these mutations are expected to destabilize the extracellular IG domain of β1 and result in loss of function. In zβ1,
2 of 5 amino acids in the deleted segment (isoleucine,
tyrosine), C121, and R85 are all conserved (M1, M2, M3/
4, Fig. 1A). R85H was also previously reported as a nonsynonymous SNP in NCBI and PharmGKB SNP databases
(S1, Fig. 1A). A second reported SNP in human β1 results
in a threonine to methionine substitution at position 189
(T189M), but T189 is not conserved in the amino acid
sequence of zβ1 (S2, Fig. 1A).

Although disease-causing mutations are not currently
associated with either SCN2B or SCN3B, nonsynonymous

SNPs have been reported for SCN2B that result in an
arginine to tryptophan substitution at position 28
(R28W) and an arginine to histidine substitution at position 47 (R47H). R47 but not R28 is conserved in the
amino acid sequence of zebrafish β2 (S1, S2, Fig. 2A). A
mutation in SCN4B resulting in a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at position 179 (L179F) was recently
implicated as a putative cause of the congenital Long QT
syndrome [32]. Although this leucine is conserved in
zebrafish β4.1, rat β4 and zebrafish β4.2 display a cysteine
(C) and threonine (T) at this position, respectively (M1,
Fig. 4A). A nonsynonymous SCN4B polymorphism has
also been reported, resulting in an asparagine to histidine
substitution at position 210 (N210H). N210 is conserved
in the sequences of both zβ4.1 and zβ4.2 (S1, Fig 4A).
Alternative splicing of zebrafish β subunit genes
The mammalian β1 subunit gene is alternatively-spliced
in both rats (β1A) and humans (β1B), with retention of
intron 3 being the primary event in both species that dramatically alters the transmembrane domain and intracellular C-terminus of the β1 subunit protein [49,50]. An
alternative splice-variant of β1 that retains intron 5 and
adds 86 nucleotides to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of
β1 mRNA transcripts has also been reported [51,52]. In
zebrafish, we detected 4 alternatively-spliced variants of
the β1 gene, designated here as A-D. Comparisons
between complementary DNA and genomic DNA
revealed that zβ1A transcripts have 5 exons while zβ1B
and zβ1D each have 6 exons and zβ1C has only 2 (Fig. 1B,
Table 1). Transcripts of zβ1A, zβ1B, and zβ1D all share
exons 1 through 4 but not exons 5 and 6; and all splice
junctions except exon 5-intron 5 of zβ1B display canonical GT-AG splice donor-acceptor sites (Figs. 1B, 1C; Table

1). The zβ1 splice variant that shares the most identity
with human β1 at the amino acid level (zβ1D) also shares
nearly identical genomic organization (Table 1). With the
exception of differences in exons 5 and 6, zβ1A and zβ1B
variants also share this conserved genomic architecture
(Table 1).
Similar to splice variants of the mammalian β1 gene,
splice variants of zβ1 are all predicted to encode proteins
with variable C-termini. Unlike the mammalian variants,
however, zβ1A, zβ1B, and zβ1D are predicted to possess
identical transmembrane domains and differ only in their
distal C-termini (Fig. 1D). As a result of alternative-splicing, zβ1A lacks the conserved tyrosine residue (Y200, Fig.
1A) that was found to regulate recruitment of ankyrin G
by mammalian β1, as well as the putative internalization
sequence (Y-L-A-I) discussed above (Figs. 1A, 1D)
[12,45,53]. These alterations may affect interactions
between zβ1A and zebrafish ankyrin, as well as influence
the cycling of the mature zβ1A protein from its membrane
compartment. The zβ1C splice variant, which results from
retention of intron 2 and has an open reading frame of
only 105 amino acids, is predicted to lack both an extracellular IG motif and a membrane-spanning segment.
Although alternative splicing of the β2 gene has not previously been identified in mammals, we identified 4 unique
β2 transcripts in zebrafish. While zβ2A and zβ2B are
spliced at canonical splice donor and acceptor sites, variants zβ2C and zβ2D are assembled by splicing at noncanonical exon 4-intron 4 and intron 4-exon 5 splice
donor and acceptor sites. zβ2A is assembled from only 3
exons, zβ2B from 6 exons, and zβ2C and zβ2D from 5
exons each (Fig. 2B). Mammalian and zebrafish β2 genes
all share a second exon that is 167 nucleotides in length
and encodes the initial segment of the subunit's extracellular IG domain. Otherwise, the genomic organization of
zβ2 splice variants diverges from that of human, mouse,
and rat β2 genes which all have 4 coding exons (Table 2).
Nevertheless, exons 1 and 3 are similar in length in all species, as is the coding segment of exon 4 in the mammalian
β2 genes and the zβ2B and zβ2D splice variants (Table 2).
zβ2B, zβ2C, and zβ2D are unique in possessing a fifth
exon that contributes to the gene's open reading frame.
Similar to mouse β2, the most conserved zebrafish β2
splice variant at the amino acid level (zβ2B) has a lengthy
terminal exon that is entirely non-coding.
As observed for zβ1, the conceptual translation of zβ2
splice variants predict zβ2 proteins that are of variable
length and amino acid sequence at their intracellular Cterminal tail (Fig. 2D). The variant zβ2A results from
retention of intron 3 and is predicted to result in a 160
amino acid protein that has an intact extracellular IG
domain but no transmembrane domain (Fig. 2D). zβ2A is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/113

thus unlikely to display canonical beta subunit activities
such as modulation of the trafficking and/or function of
voltage-gated sodium channels α subunits, or mediation
of cell-adhesion between cells expressing this protein and
other cells or the extracellular matrix, which all depend on
integration in the cell membrane. Transcripts for variants
zβ2B-D result from alternative splicing of exons 4–6 and
are expected to produce proteins of 223, 201, and 231
amino acids, respectively (Fig. 2D, Table 2). Since the
function of the intracellular C-terminal tail of zβ2 is not
well-characterized, the predicted impact of these splice
variants on zβ2 function cannot be readily predicted.
Unlike the zβ1 and zβ2 genes, alternatively-spliced transcripts of zβ3, zβ4.1, and zβ4.2 genes were not detected.
For each of these three genes, the genomic organization is
well-conserved compared to that of its respective mammalian homolog (Tables 3, 4). The open reading frame of
SCN3B in humans, mice, rats, and zebrafish is derived
from 5 exons (exons 2–6), with a non-coding initial exon
found in all 4 species and a non-coding terminal exon
found only in the mammalian β3 gene (Table 3). Splicing
of zebrafish β3 is determined by canonical GT-AG splice
donor and acceptor sites, producing a putative protein
whose secondary structure is similar to the β3 subunit
found in mammals (Figs. 3C, D). zβ4.1 and zβ4.2 transcripts are comprised of 5 and 6 exons, respectively, all of
which are assembled from splicing at canonical GT-AG
splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 4B, C). zβ4.2 is
unique among β4 genes in possessing a non-coding exon
1 (Table 4). The predicted secondary structures of zβ4.1
and zβ4.2 are both similar to the β4 subunit found in
mammals (Fig. 4D).
Tissue-specific regulation of zebrafish β subunit gene
expression and splicing
Mammalian sodium channel β subunit genes are
expressed primarily in excitable tissues such as the heart,
brain, and skeletal muscle. By RT-PCR, we observed that
zebrafish β subunit genes are also expressed in excitable
tissues where they may act to regulate the expression or
function of sodium channel α subunits (Fig. 5, Table 5).
Moreover, we detected distinct expression patterns for
zβ1-4, suggesting that the functional importance of each β
subunit likely varies by tissue type. Transcripts of zβ2 or
zβ3 are absent from skeletal muscle while zβ1 and zβ4.2
are expressed only at low levels in the heart. As might be
expected for non-excitable tissues, few β subunit transcripts were detected in the zebrafish liver and only zβ1
and zβ2 are expressed in the gill.

By designing splice variant-specific primers, we also found
evidence for tissue-specific regulation of splicing of
zebrafish β subunit genes (Fig. 5). While zβ1 variants B
and D are expressed primarily in the brain and eye

Presentation and labeling as in Table 1. %ID (%SIM) refers to percentage identity and similarity with the human β2 protein sequence as determined
by alignment. Zebrafish β2 subunit topology was determined as described in Methods. Numbering refers to β2 protein sequence with signal peptide
intact. IG(V) domain and transmembrane regions for human β2 and human/mouse/rat splice variants were annotated based on previous reports [11,
14, 43, 101].

(including the optic nerve), zβ1A is expressed in the
atrium, ventricle, skeletal muscle and gill. Similarly, while
zβ2 variant B is primarily expressed in the brain and eye,
zβ2 variants A, C, and D are also expressed in the atrium,
ventricle, brain, eye, and variant D is additionally
expressed in the gill. Interestingly, zβ3 may be alternatively-spliced in the brain and eye but not in the atrium or
ventricle. We were unable to recover the shorter variant
because of its apparent low level of expression. Although
zβ1 variant C was identified by RACE-PCR using total
embryonic RNA as template, we were unable to detect
expression of this short splice variant in the adult tissues
analyzed for this study. This suggests that zβ1 variant C
may be developmentally regulated, expressed in other tissues, unstable, or is the result of an infrequent alternative
splicing event.
Zebrafish β1 functionally modifies sodium channel
expression, function in vitro
As the first sodium channel auxiliary subunit to be identified, β1 is the most widely-studied of the four known
mammalian β subunit proteins. To evaluate whether functional α and β subunit interactions are likely to occur in
zebrafish, we heterologously co-expressed the most conserved variant of zβ1 (variant D) with the gene encoding
the zebrafish pore-forming sodium channel α subunit
zNav1.5, whose expression we detected in the adult
zebrafish brain and heart (unpublished observations).
Prior studies suggest that the mammalian β1 subunit may
influence the current amplitude and possibly the gating of
mammalian Nav1.5 in vitro [54-57]. Co-expression of zβ1
with zscn5a in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells
increased peak sodium current by 68% at a -30 mV depolarizing pulse (n = 5, p < 0.001) compared to zscn5a alone
(n = 8) (Fig. 6A–C, table 6). Co-expression of zβ1 with

zscn5a also resulted in small but significant changes in the
gating of the zNav1.5 channel protein. zβ1 induced hyperpolarizing shifts in both the voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation of zNav1.5, without altering
recovery from inactivation (Fig. 6D–F, table 6). These data
suggest that the canonical modulatory effects of mammalian sodium channel β subunits on α subunit function
and expression are likely to be conserved in teleosts and
other non-mammalian vertebrates.
Evolutionary relationships of vertebrate β subunit genes
Although β subunit genes appear to be related both structurally and functionally to each other and to cell adhesion
molecules with V-type IG domains such as myelin protein
zero and contactin [11,12], the evolutionary relationships
among these genes have not previously been formally
studied. To investigate these relationships, we first identified an extended group of human genes that display
sequence homology to β subunits. BLAST searches of the
human genome with human β subunit nucleotide and
amino acid sequences most frequently-identified the
genes myelin protein zero, myelin protein zero-like 1, isoform
A (MPZL1 iso A), epithelial V-like antigen (EVA1), and
hypothetical protein LOC196264 which we named
"EVA1-like gene" (EVA1L) for its similarity to EVA1 and
the proximity of these two genes in the human genome.
Analysis of the amino acid sequence of each gene using
the NCBI conserved domain database and TMpred software revealed that all 4 proteins likely possess single Vtype IG domains and transmembrane segments, respectively, similar to sodium channel β subunits (Fig. 7A).
Moreover, comparison of the complementary DNA
sequences of these genes against their respective genomic
loci indicated that all 4 genes also possess genomic organization similar to sodium channel β subunits (Fig. 7B).

Presentation and labeling as in Table 1. %ID (%SIM) refers to percentage identity and similarity with the human β3 protein sequence as determined
by alignment. Zebrafish β3 subunit topology was determined as described in Methods. Numbering refers to β3 protein sequence with signal peptide

[12, 14].

We therefore included these genes in our analysis of the
synteny and phylogeny of the extended family of vertebrate β subunit genes.
To analyze synteny, we first identified all β subunit-like
genes in human, rat, zebrafish, frog (Xenopus tropicalis)
and bird (Gallus gallus) genomes (Table 7). Notably, while
humans and rats each have 4 and zebrafish have 5 β subunit genes, only 3 β subunit genes were identified in frogs
and birds (β1 was not found in either genome). Next, we
used reciprocal BLAST searches and in silico chromosome
walking to assess physical relationships among β-subunit
like genes (Fig. 8). Strikingly, scn2b, scn4b, and EVA1/
EVA1L genes map to common locations in every vertebrate genome analyzed (human chromosome 11, rat
chromosome 8, zebrafish chromosome 5/15, frog
scaffold_39, and chicken chromosome 24), suggestive of
a close evolutionary relationship that may have resulted
from gene duplication. Although physically more distant,
scn3b is also syntenic with this group of genes in 4/5
genomes analyzed. Of the 4 sodium channel β subunits,
only scn1b falls outside this syntenic block. The common
ancestry of human, rat, and zebrafish scn1b is supported,

however, by the proximity of the genes encoding the 26S
protease regulatory subunit 6B (PSMC4) and fibrillarin
(FBL) to the scn1b locus in all three species (human chromosome 19, rat chromosome 1, zebrafish chromosome
16). The synteny of β subunit genes in mammalian, fish,
amphibian, and avian lineages thus supports the hypothesis that extant vertebrate β subunits are orthologous.
Moreover, these findings strongly suggest that the evolution of at least several members of this extended gene family (scn2b, scn4b, EVA1, EVA1L) may have arisen from
duplication events that predated the divergence of teleosts
and tetrapods.
To further analyze the evolution of vertebrate β subunitlike genes, we reconstructed the phylogeny of this gene
family (Fig. 9). Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of
amino acid sequences demonstrated that all-identified
sodium channel β subunits fall on one of four branches
corresponding to β1, β2, β3, or β4, supporting the preliminary identity assigned to each cloned zebrafish β subunit
gene (including the duplicated zebrafish β4 genes) by
alignment with each individual mammalian subunit
(Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A). Despite synteny among scn2b,

scn3b, and scn4b, phylogenetic analysis revealed that β3 is
more closely related to β1 than to either β2 or β4. Moreover, our phylogenetic model incorporating β subunit-like
genes additionally indicated that β2 and β4 are more
closely-related to each other and to β subunit-like genes
than to either β1 or β3. Our analysis thus supports an evolutionary model where β2/β4/β subunit-like genes and
β1/β3 arose following duplications of 2 distinct precursor
genes. The timing of such duplications cannot be gleaned
from this model. The presence of gene orthologs to all 4 β
subunits in divergent vertebrates (mammals and teleosts)
strongly suggests, however, that the early vertebrate common ancestor to these lineages already had four distinct β
subunit genes. Duplication events that occurred in this
gene family – aside from that which produced two
zebrafish β4 genes – thus occurred earlier in vertebrate
evolution or prior to the emergence of the vertebrates altogether.
Absence of β subunit genes in invertebrates
The sequenced genomes of the ascidians Ciona intestinalis
and Ciona savignyi provide an opportunity to identify
putative precursors to vertebrate β subunits genes in invertebrate chordates [58,59]. Although both ascidian
genomes contain several loci encoding Nav1 voltage-gated
sodium channel α subunits, BLAST searches using the
nucleotide and protein sequences of zebrafish and mammalian sodium channel β subunits and related proteins
(MPZ, EVA1) did not identify any homologous genes. The
absence of β subunit-like genes in sequenced Ciona
genomes does not preclude the presence of numerous
other genes with V-type and other IG-like domains
([60,61] and unpublished observations). These findings
strongly suggest that sodium channel β subunit genes are
an innovation of vertebrates. As predicted, searches of the
genome of the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) [62], a non-chordate deuterostome, also
did not reveal any sodium channel β subunits genes.

Despite the lack of evidence for β subunits genes outside
of vertebrates, studies conducted in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that invertebrate sodium channels
require additional subunits for normal function. Mutations in the Drosophila tip-E (temperature-induced paralysis)
gene, which encodes a sodium channel auxiliary subunit,
disrupt nerve conduction by perturbing the expression
and function of the para voltage-gated sodium channel
[63-67]. Moreover, 4 recently-identified tip-E related
genes (TEH1-4 or tip-E homologs 1–4) were found to
modulate the density and kinetics of sodium currents of
heterologously-expressed para sodium channels [68].
Based on these findings, we sought to assess whether vertebrate and invertebrate sodium channel auxiliary subunits share common structural elements or functional
domains. Use of TMPred software and the NCBI conserved domain database demonstrated, however, that
Drosophila tip-E and tip-E homologous genes (TEH1-4)
each possess two predicted membrane-spanning segments (not one) and lack the canonical V-type IG domain
found in vertebrate β subunits. Additionally, alignment of
the amino acid sequences of cloned zebrafish and human
sodium channel β subunit genes with the sequences of
Drosophila tip-E and tip-E homologous genes also revealed
only minimal homology (< 15% amino acid identity).
BLAST searches of the Drosophila genome did not uncover
any additional genes sharing close homology with vertebrate β subunits, despite the presence of numerous genes
encoding proteins with immunoglobulin domains ([69]
and unpublished observations). These results indicate
that vertebrate and invertebrate sodium channel auxiliary
subunits are dissimilar in structure and unrelated.

Discussion
Numerous studies of mammalian voltage-gated sodium
channel β subunits have demonstrated that these small,
single membrane-spanning proteins are integral components of sodium channel complexes in excitable tissues,

modulators of the expression and function of pore-forming sodium channel α subunits, and candidate genes for
clinical disorders linked to perturbed membrane excitability such as arrhythmia and epilepsy [18,70]. Despite the
early origins of the Nav1 family of sodium channel α subunits and their cloning from diverse metazoans including
eels, jellyfish, flies, and humans, the evolutionary history
of sodium channel β subunits has remained obscure. The
primary objective of this study was thus to investigate β
subunit genes in Danio rerio (zebrafish), a pivotal vertebrate species whose teleost ancestors diverged from mammals over 400 million years ago, in order to gain further
insight into the origin and regulation of the voltage-gated
sodium channel macromolecular complex.

Using a combination of bioinformatics, molecular cloning, and phylogenetic analysis, we identified conserved
orthologs of all 4 mammalian β subunit genes and 8
novel β1 and β2 splice variants in zebrafish. Using our
cloned zebrafish sequences, we subsequently identified β
subunit genes in other non-mammalian vertebrates
including Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog) and
Gallus gallus (Red jungle fowl). The existence of conserved
mammalian, teleost, amphibian, and avian sodium channel β subunit loci indicates that this gene family is likely
to be found in most if not all vertebrate genomes. Moreover, our detection of zebrafish β subunit gene expression
in tissues including the heart, muscle, and the brain suggests that the voltage-gated sodium channel α-β subunit
macromolecular complex is likely to be a common structural feature of excitable membranes.
Sodium channel complexes in non-mammalian
vertebrates: an emerging concept
Our data are the first to support the existence of voltagegated sodium channel α-β subunit macromolecular complexes in non-mammalian vertebrates. Data from prior
studies, however, suggest that sodium channels form α-β
subunit complexes in mammals but not in other vertebrate lineages [5-7,71-79]. While sodium channels biochemically purified from rat neuronal membranes and rat
and rabbit skeletal muscle membranes were found to be
comprised of 1 α subunit and 1 or more auxiliary β subunits, for example, α subunits purified from the electroplax
(electric organ) of the South American eel Electrophorus
electricus and from chick cardiac muscle were unaccompanied by β subunits [5-7,71-79]. Further investigation into
the existence of sodium channel α-β macromolecular
complexes in non-mammalian vertebrates is thus needed
to reconcile our current findings with the results of previous studies.

There are several possible reasons for the discord between
biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. First, it is
possible that some but not all voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms within a particular species form complexes
by associating with auxiliary β subunits, or that poreforming α subunits form complexes only in specific tissues. Evidence suggests that even in mammals, for example, the subunit composition of voltage-gated sodium

channels significantly varies both by α subunit isoform
and by tissue [9,72]. Second, at least for the eel electroplax, the function of this organ may depend on sodium
channel α subunits that have evolved unique properties
which may preclude association with auxiliary subunits
[80]. Third, it is possible that sodium channel α subunit
isoforms in certain tissues form complexes not with
canonical β subunits but with yet unidentified proteins. In
mammals, the interaction of sodium channel α subunits
with a number of additional components and modulators
in macromolecular complexes suggest that β subunits
may not always serve as obligatory functional partners
(for review, see refs [18,81]). Our detection of conserved
β subunit mRNA expression in excitable organs such as
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, however, suggests the
strong possibility of α-β subunit complexes in these
zebrafish tissues. Moreover, co-expression of zebrafish α

and β subunit genes in CHO cells demonstrated meaningful functional interactions between the two subunits, with
significant differences observed in sodium current amplitude and channel gating when both subunit genes are
expressed together versus when the α subunit gene is
expressed alone. Despite these findings, however, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that sodium channel β subunit genes play different in vivo functional roles
in mammals than in non-mammalian vertebrates.
Evolution of sodium channel β subunits and related genes
Our analysis of the synteny and phylogeny of vertebrate
sodium channel β subunit genes suggests a different evolutionary history for α and β subunits. For sodium channel α subunits, prevailing evolutionary models posit that
the 10 mammalian isoforms arose from the tandem
duplication of at least 2 of 4 ancestral sodium channel

genes, which in turn had duplicated from 1 or 2 precursor
chordate Nav1 sodium channel genes by polyploidization
[36-39]. As would be predicted by this model, the total
number of Nav1 sodium channel genes varies between teleosts and mammals despite the phylogenetic clustering of
all of these genes into 4 groups derived from ancestral vertebrate sodium channel genes [38,40]. Sodium channel β
subunits, which are fewer in number, do not appear to
have undergone tandem duplication in either mammals
or in non-mammalian vertebrates. This is supported by
our finding that 4 distinct vertebrate lineages (mammals,
ray-finned fishes, amphibians and birds) all appear to
share distinct orthologs to 3 or 4 β subunit genes. Thus, it

is likely that the common ancestor to teleosts and tetrapods over 400 million years ago also possessed 4 distinct
ancestral β subunit genes (β1-4). The presence of 2 β4
orthologs on different zebrafish chromosomes is likely to
be the remnant of an additional polyploidization event
known to have occurred in teleost vertebrates but not in
mammals [41]. It is difficult to determine why duplicate
genes for β1-3 have not been retained in zebrafish; it is
possible that > 5 β subunit genes did not offer teleosts any
evolutionary advantage [42].

other and to genes (e.g. EVA1) that are β subunit-like in
sequence and genomic organization is strong evidence
that duplication events gave rise to the β subunit gene
family during the postulated large-scale expansion of the
early vertebrate genome. Although we cannot accurately
predict the early evolutionary history of sodium channel
β subunit genes prior to the divergence of teleosts from
other vertebrate lineages, the results of our phylogenetic
analysis support the existence of 2 ancestral β subunit
genes (β1/β3 and β2/β4) in early vertebrates. Somewhat
surprisingly (but in agreement with a previous report
[33]), BLASTN and BLASTP searches of available urochordate (Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi) genomes did not
identify any sodium channel β subunit-like genes, despite
the clear existence of genes encoding proteins with immunoglobulin domains similar to those found in β subunits
[60,61]. Moreover, we and others also found limited
homology between vertebrate β subunit genes and the tipE/TEH subunits of the para sodium channel in Drosophila
[34,65]. These findings strongly suggest that sodium
channel β subunits are a unique vertebrate innovation.
The similarity of vertebrate sodium channel β subunits to
members of a more ancient family of IG domain-containing proteins suggests that β subunit genes may have arisen
de novo in early vertebrates from genes encoding cell-adhesion molecules, membrane receptors, or components of
the innate immunity. The property of modulation of the
expression and function of sodium channel β subunits
may thus represent a more evolutionarily recent function
for this gene family. These findings support the idea that
molecular mechanisms enhancing functional diversity
and specialization in electrical signaling – either through
α subunit gene duplication, editing or alternative splicing
of α subunit RNA transcripts, or the emergence of auxiliary proteins that associate with α subunits to modulate
their expression and/or function – may have been adaptive and underwent selection in the evolving nervous system of early vertebrates and subsequently, in the
increasingly complex excitable tissues of diverse vertebrate lineages including mammals. Despite the lack of
common ancestry among invertebrate tip-E/TEH subunits
and vertebrate IG-like β subunits, the apparent independent evolution of Nav1 sodium channel-interacting proteins in distantly-related species demonstrates that the
formation of sodium channel macromolecular complexes
is an evolutionary advantageous and conserved mechanism for fine-tuning the properties of excitable membranes.
Functional implications of alternative splicing of zebrafish
β subunit genes
The evidence we present for the extensive C-terminal alternative splicing of zebrafish β subunit genes is intriguing
because it may represent another conserved molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/113

mechanism for modulating electrical signaling in vertebrates. Alternative splicing has been reported for both
mammalian sodium channel α and β subunits and invertebrate α subunits, often with important functional consequences [49,50,82-88]. The intronic retention events
that produce both the rat β1A and human β1B variants
each result in a protein with a novel transmembrane
domain and intracellular C-terminal tail. When stably
expressed in Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) fibroblasts, rat
β1 and β1A differentially modulate the function of the rat
sodium channel α subunit Nav1.2 (scn2a) [49]. Similarly,
the human β1 and β1B subunits differentially modulate
the function of human Nav1.2 in Xenopus oocytes [50].
These studies suggest that the transmembrane domain
and C-terminus of the human and rat β1 subunits contribute to the functional modulation of sodium channel α
subunits. In a subsequent study, the β1 intracellular C-terminal tail in particular was found to be required for both
efficient physical association with Nav1.2 and for the
modulation of sodium channel function in both mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes [89]. This raises the possibility that the zebrafish β1 and β2 subunit splice variants
identified in this study may also differentially influence
the function of sodium channel α subunits. Our identification of distinctive expression patterns for different
splice variants of the same gene underscores the complexity of this putative sodium channel regulatory mechanism.

Conclusion
We have identified conserved orthologs to all 4 mammalian β subunit genes (zβ1-zβ4) in zebrafish. Despite
highly-conserved genomic organization in fish and mammals, zebrafish express 8 distinct mRNA transcripts for the
β1 and β2 genes that are generated by alternative splicing.
Zebrafish β subunit genes and their splice variants are differentially-expressed in excitable tissues, and co-expression of zβ1 (variant D) with the zebrafish sodium channel
α subunit gene zscn5a in CHO cells demonstrated functional α-β interactions that we predict may also occur in
native tissues. Our evolutionary analysis of mammalian,
teleost, amphibian, and avian β subunit and related genes
indicated that all extant vertebrate β subunits are orthologous, that β2/β4 and β1/β3 share common ancestry, and
that β subunits are closely-related to other proteins with
V-type IG domains including myelin protein zero (MPZ)
and epithelial V-like antigen 1 (EVA1). Homologs to vertebrate β subunit genes were not identified in the
genomes of invertebrate chordates, and β subunits were
found to be unrelated to the tip-E/TEH subunits of the para
sodium channel in Drosophila. Taken together, these findings suggest that the family of sodium channel β subunit
genes emerged early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the
divergence of teleosts and tetrapods. The evolutionary history of vertebrate β subunits is thus consistent with the

Methods
Identification and cloning of zSCN1B-4B genes and splice
variants
Mammalian SCN1B-4B gene sequences were used in
BLASTN queries of the draft zebrafish genome (Ensembl
Zv2-5) to identify DNA contigs containing putative
zebrafish orthologs. Primers directed against predicted
exons were then used to amplify partial β subunit gene
sequences using the Titan RT-PCR enzyme system (Roche)
and total day 2 embryonic zebrafish RNA as template.
RNA was isolated using Trizol (GIBCO), digested with
RQ1 DNase (Promega), and purified with the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). 5' and 3' ends and alternatively-spliced
forms of each gene were identified using 5' and 3' RNA
ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLMRACE) PCR (Ambion). Additional splice variants were
identified by RT-PCR while examining tissue-specific
expression. All amplicons were subcloned directly into the

Sequence data and annotation
Eleven novel zebrafish gene sequences were deposited in
the
NCBI
GenBank
database:
zβ1A
[Genbank:DQ489722], zβ1B [Genbank:DQ489723], zβ1C
[Genbank:DQ489724], zβ1D [Genbank:DQ489725],
zβ2B
[Genzβ2A
[Genbank:DQ489726],

[Genbank:DQ489729], zβ3 [Genbank:DQ489730], zβ4
locus 1 [Genbank:DQ489731], zβ4 locus 2 [Genbank:DQ489732]. Intron-exon boundaries for each gene
and splice variant were determined by comparing cDNA
and genomic sequences. Sequences for zebrafish β1-β4
were annotated by alignment with their mammalian
orthologs using the AlignX function of Vector NTI v9.1
(Invitrogen) and by use of the following informatics
resources: signal peptide (SMART) [90], IG-like domain
(SMART [90], NCBI conserved domain database, CDD,
v2.06 [91], and REF [14]), transmembrane (TMpred [92]
and REF [93]), disulfide bridge (Prosite) [94], and putative N-linked glycosylation sites (NetNGlyc 1.0 server)
[95].
Gene expression
Tissues were dissected from wild type adult zebrafish
(strain TuAB, 12–16 months old) and flash frozen on dry
ice in ethanol. Tissue-specific total RNA was isolated and
purified as described above. First strand cDNA synthesis
was performed using 1 μg of RNA from each tissue, random hexamer primers, and Transcriptor reverse transcriptase enzyme (Roche). 2 μl of first strand cDNA was
used in 25 μl PCR reactions with Expand High Fidelity
DNA polymerase (Roche). Amplicons were analyzed on a
1–2% agarose gel made with 1 x Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE)
buffer. Primer pairs used to amplify each individual gene
and splice variant are listed in Table 5. All amplicons were
subcloned directly into the pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega)
and sequenced in their entirety in both sense and antisense directions.
Identification of β subunit-like genes
Human sodium channel β subunit nucleotide and amino
acid sequences were used in BLAST searches of the human
genome to identify β subunit-like genes. Four human
genes sharing the greatest homology as well as similar
genomic organization and/or synteny with known
sodium channel β subunit genes were included for further
analysis:
myelin

[Genbank:NP_000521], myelin protein zero-like gene, isoform A (MPZL1 isoform A) [Genbank:NP_003944],

Actual (human, zebrafish) and predicted (chicken, frog) amino acid sequences of β subunit and related genes were aligned using
CLUSTALX (v1.83). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei and viewed

[Genbank:NP_938016].
Analysis of synteny
Synteny between vertebrate β subunits and related genes
was assessed by chromosomal walking and reciprocal
BLAST searches of genes adjacent to β subunit loci in
human, zebrafish, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus tropicalis, and
Gallus gallus genome databases (Ensembl).
Analysis of phylogeny
To estimate phylogeny, additional β subunit and β subunit-like gene sequences were identified in Rattus norvegi-

cus, Xenopus tropicalis, and Gallus gallus genome databases
(Ensembl). Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned
with cloned zebrafish sequences using CLUSTALX
(v1.83). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the
neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei (Ref [96])
and viewed with NJplot software. Alignment gaps were
excluded in the analysis, and the Kimura correction was
made for multiple substitutions [97]. The robustness of
each node in the phylogenetic tree was analyzed with
bootstrap analysis (n = 1000). Trees were unrooted due to
limited evidence for β subunit-like genes in non-vertebrate species.

was sublconed directly into the pGEM-TEasy vector. Multiple clones were purified, sequenced, and screened
against the consensus sequence determined during the
cloning of the zβ1 gene. Insert was digested out of a single
zβ1D consensus clone and subcloned into the pGFP-IRES
vector (Clontech) using Spe I and Sac II restriction sites.
We have used similar methods to identify, clone and
assemble a full-length zscn5a expression construct (pBKCMV-zscn5a) which encodes zebrafish Nav1.5. These
methods are described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation).
Transient transfection and electrophysiology
Cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were transiently transfected with pBK-CMV-zscn5a and pGFP-IRESzβ1D constructs using FuGENE6 (Roche). Cells were
grown for 48 hours after transfection before electrophysiologic study. Whole-cell voltage clamp was performed at
room temperature with 2-MΩ patch microelectrodes and
an Axopatch 200A amplifier. To minimize the capacitive
transients, we compensated for approximately 70% to
80% of the cell capacitance and series resistance [100].
Cells exhibiting very large currents (> 6 nA) were also
excluded from further analysis. Cells were also excluded if
voltage control was compromised. The extracellular bath
solution contained (in mmol/L) NaCl 145, KCl 4.0,
MgCl2 1.0, CaCl2 1.8, glucose 10, and HEPES 10; the pH
was 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The pipette (intracellular)
solution contained (in mmol/L) NaF 10, CsF 110, CsCl
20, EGTA 10, and HEPES 10; the pH was 7.4, adjusted
with CsOH. Cells were held at -120 mV, and activating
currents were elicited with depolarizing pulses from -100
to +50 mV in 10 mV increments. Specific clamp protocols
are indicated with the data. Data were acquired by
pClamp8.0 (Axon Instruments Inc), sampled at 50 kHz,
and low-pass filtered at 5 kHz. All currents were normalized to the cell capacitance calculated by Membrane Test
(OUT O) in pClamp8.0.
