Abstract
Background: Snakes as a major reptile group display a variety of morphological characteristics
pertaining to their diverse behaviours. Despite abundant analyses of morphological characters,
molecular studies using mitochondrial and nuclear genes are limited. As a result, the phylogeny of
snakes remains controversial. Previous studies on mitochondrial genomes of snakes have
demonstrated duplication of the control region and translocation of trnL to be two notable features
of the alethinophidian (all serpents except blindsnakes and threadsnakes) mtDNAs. Our purpose
is to further investigate the gene organizations, evolution of the snake mitochondrial genome, and
phylogenetic relationships among several major snake families.
Results: The mitochondrial genomes were sequenced for four taxa representing four different
families, and each had a different gene arrangement. Comparative analyses with other snake
mitochondrial genomes allowed us to summarize six types of mitochondrial gene arrangement in
snakes. Phylogenetic reconstruction with commonly used methods of phylogenetic inference (BI,
ML, MP, NJ) arrived at a similar topology, which was used to reconstruct the evolution of
mitochondrial gene arrangements in snakes.
Conclusion: The phylogenetic relationships among the major families of snakes are in accordance
with the mitochondrial genomes in terms of gene arrangements. The gene arrangement in
Ramphotyphlops braminus mtDNA is inferred to be ancestral for snakes. After the divergence of the
early Ramphotyphlops lineage, three types of rearrangements occurred. These changes involve
translocations within the IQM tRNA gene cluster and the duplication of the CR. All phylogenetic
methods support the placement of Enhydris plumbea outside of the (Colubridae + Elapidae) cluster,
providing mitochondrial genomic evidence for the familial rank of Homalopsidae.

Background
Snakes are a large group of reptiles with a broad range of
morphological features, of which many are evolutionarily
selected by their habitats. Snakes have conventionally
been divided into two groups. The fossorial scolecophidians (blindsnakes and threadsnakes) are small snakes with

a small gape size that feed on small prey on a frequent
basis. The second major group, the alethinophidians (or
"true snakes") are more ecologically diverse and most species feed on relatively large prey on an infrequent basis.
True snakes are further split into the Henophidia and the
Caenophidia. The caenophidians, which are also called

advanced snakes, include the aquatic genus Acrochordus
and the Colubroidea. The Colubroidea is subdivided into
the families Atractaspididae, Elapidae, Viperidae, and Colubridae. A small colubrid subfamily, Homalopsinae, was
first attributed familial rank by Günther in 1864[1], and
was recognized as subfamily in the 20th century by most
researchers until it was reassigned familial status in recent
years [2-4].
Recent phylogenetic analyses, based primarily on molecular analyses of a few mitochondrial or nuclear genes failed
to reach a consensus in several aspects [2,3,5,6]. For
instance, the composition of the family Colubridae, the
putative paraphyly and the hierarchical structuring into
subfamilies remain contentious issues. The mitochondrial
genome has several advantages for phylogenetic studies
[7,8], and has been widely used in constructing animal
phylogeny including snakes [9].
Previous studies of snake mitochondrial genomes have
demonstrated that duplication of the control region and
translocation of trnL are two visible features of the alethinophidian mtDNAs [9,10]. Moreover, translocation and
pseudogenization of trnP have been found in some caenophidian snakes [10]. The Texas threadsnake (Leptotyphlops dulcis) possesses a different gene arrangement and
loses its origin of light strand replication (OL) [11]. In the
present study, we determined complete mitochondrial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/569

DNA sequences from four snake families. The sequence
information allowed the gene organizations, mitochondrial genome evolution, and phylogenetic relationships
among these major snake families to be identified.

Results
Characteristics of the snake mitochondrial genomes
The general characteristics of four snake (Table 1) mitochondrial genomes are summarized in Table 2. These
complete mt genomes range from 16,397 to 17,548 bps in
size. Length differences are largely due to the variation in
lengths and/or numbers of the control region. In three of
the four genomes (Deinagkistrodon acutus, Naja naja, and
Enhydris plumbea), two control regions are found in the
positions identical to those in other alethinophidian taxa
mtDNAs. MtDNA sequence for Ramphotyphlops braminus is
considerably smaller due to the absence of the control
region duplication. All the genomes contain 13 proteincoding genes, 2 rRNAs genes, and 22 tRNAs genes. The
base compositions in these mtDNAs are skewed similarly
to other vertebrate mtDNAs [12], with more A-T base
pairs than G-C base pairs and greater A+C content in the
gene-rich strand than in the gene-poor strand.

By comparing the gene arrangements in 14 known snake
mitochondrial genomes, six types of gene organization
were summarized and shown in Figure 1. Type I and II
represent gene organizations of two scoleophidian

Comparison of mitochondrial gene organizations of snakes
Comparison of mitochondrial gene organizations of snakes. Gene arrangements are presented for the following six
types of snakes. I: Ramphotyphlops braminus; II:Leptotyphlops dulcis; III: Naja naja, Acrochordus granulatus, Boa constrictor, Cylindrophis ruffus, Python regius, Xenopeltis unicolor; IV: Dinodon semicarinatus, Pantherophis slowinskii, Enhydris plumbea; V: Ovophis okinavensis; VI: Deinagkistrodon acutus, Agkistrodon piscivorus. L1, L2, S1, S2. P* represent genes for trnL(UUR), trnL(CUN), trnS(AGY),
trnS(UCN), and a pseudogene for trnP. tRNAs transcribed from the gene-rich and gene-poor strand were specified by noting
their names above and below the gene map respectively. The tree topology on the right side was simplified from Fig. 2.

snakes. They both have similar organization to that of typical vertebrate except the absence of an identifiable origin
of light strand replication (OL) in the scolecophidian
mtDNAs. Moreover, in the mitochondrial genomeof Leptotyphlops dulcis (Type II), trnQ was translocated from the
IQM tRNA gene cluster to the WANCYcluster (the tRNA
genes are abbreviated by single letters representing the
amino acids to be decoded, and the sense strand of the
underlined tRNA genes is the heavy strand), giving rise to
the IM plus WQANCYorganizations [11]. The common
features of the remaining four arrangements (type III to
VI) are the duplication of the control region and translocation of trnL, which have been noted in previous studies
[9,10]. Six alethinophidian snakes from six families
shared type III, and type IV represented an arrangement
shared between Colubridae and Homalopsidae. In these
two types, the functional trnP is located next to CRI (location in typical vertebrate mtDNA), with or without a pseudogene (P*) close to CR II (there are two control regions
in most snake mitogenomes except scolecophidian snakes
shown as type I and II). In several previous studies, the
viperid snakes appear to have another gene rearrangement
in which a functional trnP moved from the end of CR I to
that of CR II [9,10,13]. In this study, the positional switch
of trnP is found for another viperid taxon Deinagkistrodon
acutus, and is not found for the nonviperid snakes (Fig. 1).
Gene arrangements in viperids can be summarize as type
V and VI, with only a difference in the pseudogene (P*).
Phylogenetic analyses
The results of the phylogenetic reconstructions are displayed in Figure 2. Our phylogenetic estimates strongly
support Ramphotyphlops braminus being the sister lineage
to all remaining species sampled, and that the
scolecophidian snakes do not form a monophyletic
grouping. All of the analyses were congruent in receiving
the monophyly of Alethinophidia (c in Figure 2). Within
this monophyletic clade, Henophidia and Caenophidia
were clustered as monophyletic sister groups (k and d,
respectively). Our estimates of relationships among the
henophidians are similar to that of Dong and Kumazawa
[9] in the rejection of the traditional expectations of a sister-group relationship between boids and pythonids (m
in Fig. 2) and the deep divergence of non-macrostomatan
cylindrophiids (l in Fig 2). Consistent with recent molecular phylogenies of caenophidian snakes [2,3,5], we find
support for the Viperidae as the deepest diverging lineage
within the Colubroidea, sister to a clade containing colubrids, elapids, and homalopsids. The position of Enhydris
plumbea outside of the (Colubridae + Elapidae) cluster
seems strongly supported by all phylogenetic methods (f
in Fig. 2). Traditional placement of Enhydris plumbea
within Colubridae based on morphology was not
retrieved by our analyses. Node d, corresponding to the
position of Acrochordus granulatus, is the only one not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/569

reconstructed in all tree-building methods. In Bayesian
and ML tree based on nucleotide data set and Bayesian
tree on amino acid data set, the placement of Acrochordidae to the sister group to Colubroidea was well supported.
To further substantiate the above premises, we performed
the SH statistical test [14] on both amino acid and nucleotide data sets that allows comparison of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. Results of the SH test strongly
rejected the placement of Enhydris plumbea within the colubrids cluster (P < 0.001). The monophyly of
scolecophidian snakes was not rejected using both amino
acid and nucleotide acid data sets (P > 0.05).

Discussion
Evolution of snake mitochondrial genomes
Based on the phylogenetic relationships among the tested
snakes and the comparisons of their gene organizations
(Fig. 1, 2), we estimated the processes of evolutionary
events occurred in snake mitochondrial genomes. In early
snake lineages (type I and II), gene arrangements are similar to that of typical vertebrate, but OL was lost within the
WANCYtRNA gene cluster. Incompatible with the commonly accepted view on monophyly of scolecophidian
snakes [15-18], our phylogenetic estimates strongly supports Ramphotyphlops braminus being the sister lineage to
all remaining species sampled. Given that the monophyly
of scolecophidian snakes was not rejected in SH statistical
test, loss of OL may occur in two different scenarios, independently (if nonmonophyly) or descend from a common ancestry (if monophyly). After the divergence of the
Ramphotyphlops lineage, changes involving the IQM cluster
took place. First in type II, trnQ underwent a long distance
translocation (~1.2 kb) from one gene cluster to another
(Fig. 1, 2). Subsequently, in the early alethinophidian lineage, the control region was duplicated and trnL relocated
to the IQM cluster, giving rise to type III which is present
in most alethinophidian snakes (including henophidians,
Acrochordus and Naja). New types emerged during the
split in Caenophidia. Type IV is found in two branches,
Dinodon semicarinatus, Pantherophis slowinskii (Colubridae), and Enhydris plumbea (Homalopsidae), and characteristic changes (P*) likely appeared ahead of node f,
which then disappeared in Elapidae. It is also conceivable
that the present of P* was resulted from independent evolution in Colubridae and Homalopsidae. Distinct
arrangements (type V and VI) were found in viperids, suggesting that trnP was translocated in early stage of the
viperid radiations [9]. Type VI, with no pseudogenes close
to CRI, was found in two paraphyletic taxa, suggesting
that P* could have been independently eliminated.
Familial rank of Homalopsidae
The Homalopsinae have been generally recognized as a
valid monophyletic clade within the Colubridae [19,20]

and assigned a subfamilial rank, despite they being
assigned familial [1] or tribal [21] status historically.
Recent molecular studies placed the Homalopsinae as the
sister group to most other members of the Colubroidea
[2,3,5], and a familial status has been reassigned accordingly [2-4].
In this study, the placement of Enhydris plumbea, a representative of the Homalopsidae, as the sister lineage to the
Colubridae + Elapidae clade was strongly supported by all
phylogenetic methods. Moreover, SH test strongly
rejected the hypothesis that Enhydris plumbea falls within
the colubrids cluster (P < 0.001). The familial rank of
Homalopsidae is therefore considered well-supported.
Our work for the first time establishes the monophyly and
distinctiveness of this family with phylogenetic evidence
derived from complete mitochondrial genome sequences.

Conclusion
In this study, six types of mitochondrial gene arrangement
in snakes are summarized. Two notable features of the
alethinophidian mtDNA, duplication of the CR and translocation of trnL, are presented. The gene arrangement in
Ramphotyphlops braminus mtDNA is indentical to that
found in typical vertebrates, suggesting an ancestral
arrangement. The well supported phylogenetic topology
helps to reconstruct the evolution of mitochondrial gene
arrangements in snakes. We propose that, after the divergence of the early Ramphotyphlops lineage, three types of
changes involving the IQM gene cluster occurred. These
include the translocation of trnQ in the early Leptotyphlops
lineage, the duplication of CR and translocation of trnL in
the early alethinophidian lineage, and the translocation of
trnP in the early viperid lineage. All phylogenetic methods
support the placement of Enhydris plumbea outside of the
(Colubridae + Elapidae) cluster, providing mitochondrial
genomic evidence for the familial rank of Homalopsidae.
The monophyly of Scolecophidia is not rejected in our
study. However, a more comprehensive sampling of snake
mitochondrial genomes is necessary to further refine the
phylogenetic relationships among major groups of
snakes.

Methods
Samples, DNA amplification, and sequencing
Snakes from three alethinophidian families and one scoleophidian family were sampled (Table 1). Total DNA was
extracted from a small quantity (20 mg) of tissues by
DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Several short mtDNA fragments were amplified using Ex-Taq DNA polymerase
(Takara) and sequenced in order to design taxon-specific
primers. PCRs were performed in a MJ PTC-200 thermal
cycler under the profile: 5 min at 95°C followed by 35
cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50–55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
90 s. PCR products of 1~2.5 kb were purified and then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/569

sequenced employing an ABI 310 or 3700 system with bidirectional and several internal primers. Short fragments
were assembled into a continuous sequence. In the
mtDNA sequences thus obtained, 37 individual genes
were identified based on corresponding homologues
from other vertebrates. Identification of tRNA genes was
based on their secondary structures using software DNASIS 2.5 (Hitachi Engineering, Tokyo, Japan), whereas
boundaries of rRNA genes and control regions were tentatively defined by the boundaries of adjacent coding genes.
The mtDNA sequences, with annotations, have been
deposited at GenBank (DQ343647–DQ343650).
Taxa, alignment and phylogenetic analyses
We assembled 14 serpent ingroups with complete mitochondrial genomes available, and chose 4 taxa from 4 saurian families (Amphisbaena schmidti [22]; Eumeces egregius
[23];Iguana iguana [24]; and Varanus komodoensis [25]) as
outgroups (Table 1). Two data sets were prepared for concatenated amino acid sequences and for concatenated
light-strand nucleotide sequences of the 12 protein genes.
Nad6, the only protein gene encoded by the light strand,
has been excluded for increased proportion of T and G in
all codon positions due to the strand-specific base composition bias of mtDNAs. Multiple alignments were analyzed with the Gblocks program [26] to select conserved
amino acid residues, which was later used as a backbone
to align the corresponding nucleotide sequences.

The level of saturation in the whole codons, and at the
first, second, and the third codon positions was independently analyzed using scatter plot graphics, by comparing
the uncorrected p-distance with the distance calculated by
applying the best-fit evolutionary model (GTR + I + G)
selected by the Modeltest 3.7 [27]. The third positions of
the protein genes were removed from the nucleotide data
set because of high substitutional rates and consequent
saturation as a source of noise in phylogenetic analyses.
Thus a final alignment of 6566 bases was obtained.
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using maximum
likelihood (ML), Bayesian (BI), maximum parsimony
(MP) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods. The ML analyses with the nucleotide data set were conducted with
PAUP*4.0b10 by a heuristic search with TBR branch
swapping with 10 random taxon additions. The general
reversible model (GTR + I + G) and parameters optimized
by Modeltest 3.7 were used. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences were performed with
MrBayes 3.1 [28] using a GTR + I + G model. The Markov
chain Monte Carlo process was set to run four chains
simultaneously. Posterior probabilities were calculated
from the majority-rule consensus trees constructed after
excluding the burn-in.

ML analyses with the amino acid data set were conducted
using PUZZLE 5.2 [29] with the mtREV24 substitution
matrix and amino acid frequency estimated from the data
set. The Bayesian analyses of the amino acid data were
conducted with MrBayes 3.0 using the mtREV24 + I + G
model and an empirical amino acid frequency. The Bayesian tree and posterior probability values were obtained
using the same procedures described above.
