Abstract
Background: From October 2006 to February 2007, clinical specimens from 452 patients with
symptoms related to respiratory tract infection in the northern region of Taiwan were collected.
Real-time PCR and direct immunofluorescent antibody tests showed that 145 (32%) patients had
influenza B virus infections. Subsequently, nucleotide sequence analyses of both hemagglutinin (HA)
and neuraminidase (NA) genes of 39 isolates were performed. Isolated viruses were antigenically
characterized using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test.
Findings: Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that all the isolates belonged to the B reassortant
lineage with HA gene belonged to the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage and the NA gene belonged to the B/
Yamagata/16/88 lineage. In addition, a group of children aged between 6 to 8 years old resided in
Yilan county were infected with a variant strain. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) tests confirmed that
all the reassortant influenza B viruses were B/Malaysia/2506/04-like viruses. Pre- and postimmunized serum samples from 4 normal volunteers inoculated with 2007 influenza vaccine were
evaluated for their HI activity on 6 reassortant B isolates including two variants that we found in
the Yilan county. The results demonstrated that after vaccination, all four vaccinees had at least 4fold increases of their HI titers.
Conclusion: The results indicate that the 2006–2007 seasonal influenza vaccine was effective in
stimulating protective immunity against the influenza B variants identified in Yilan county.
Continuous surveillance of emerging influenza B variants in the northern region of Taiwan is
important for the selection of proper vaccine candidate in the future.

Background
Enveloped orthomyxoviruses have segmented negativesense RNA genomes that facilitate new strain development via mutations and the reassortment of gene segments. This genetic instability is responsible for annual
international epidemics and periodic pandemics of influenza infections [1,2]. Influenza viruses are spread by small
airborne droplets expelled while talking, breathing, and
coughing. The most susceptible population is children,
and school-age children are the most common spreaders
of infection [3-7]. Vaccines are thought to be the most
effective modality for influenza control, and phylogenetic
analyses of genes of viruses provide valuable information
for vaccine development and prophylaxis.
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes have
been used to study influenza B virus evolution [8-10].
Two lineages have been identified as co-circulating since
1983: B/Victoria/2/87 (Vic87) and B/Yamagata/16/88
(Yam88) [11], and reassortants of the two lineages have
been observed since 2002 [12-18]. The increasing appearance of reassortant influenza B was reported in Taiwan
from 2002 to 2005 [19].
We conducted phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA genes
from influenza B virus isolates collected from a group of
children complaining of severe headaches in north Taiwan between October 2006 and February 2007. Variants
were further tested using a hemagglutinin inhibition (HI)
test with a panel of anti-flu B antisera; our results indicate
incomplete inhibition. Data from an amino acid sequence
analysis of the HA protein showed greater sequence variation to B/Malaysia/2506/04-like viruses in 5 influenza B
variants (B/Taiwan/3009/06, B/Taiwan/3802/06, B/Taiwan/3804/06, B/Taiwan/3805/06, and B/Taiwan/3790/
06).

Methods
Subjects
Between October 2006 and February 2007, 452 throat
swabs from patients with symptoms related to respiratory
tract infection were collected at the clinical virology laboratory of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. This laboratory has a contract with the Taiwan's Centers for Disease
Control and is responsible for the virological evaluation
of all the specimens sent from different hospitals in the
northern region of Taiwan. The epidemiological curve and
geographic distribution were shown in Figures 1 and 2.
The median age of 145 patients with influenza B infection
was 8 years old, with a range from 8 days to 14 years old
except that B/Taiwan/3807/06, B/Taiwan/3842/06, B/Taiwan/1575/07 and B/Taiwan/1540/07 were 19, 18, 23 and
43 years old respectively. Seventy-four patients are male
and seventy-one are female. To study the hemagglutinin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/2/86

inhibition titers for the influenza virus B isolates, five
adult volunteers including four normal individuals and
one patient (P139) with impaired immune function were
recruited to receive vaccines containing A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Wisconsin/67/05 and B/Malaysia/2506/04
strains. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patient P139 described that he was incapable of
generating anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antibodies
after repeatedly inoculated with HBV vaccine. Serum samples were collected prior to and 3 months after vaccination.
Virus Isolation and Confirmation
Filtrates from transport medium containing throat swabs
were inoculated into Madin-Darby Canine Kidney
(MDCK) cells. HA tests with guinea pig red blood cells
were used to test the cultural supernatant for influenza B
viral infection. Infected cells were detected using an
IMAGEN™ influenza virus test kits (DaKo Cytomation
Ltd, Cambs, UK) contain fluorescein isothiocyanate(FITC) conjugated monoclonal antibodies which
bind specifically to influenza virus type B.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL of infected tissue culture fluid using a QIAamp Viral RNA mini Kit (QIAGEN
Inc., CA). Real-time PCR was performed with 5 μL RNA,
Taqman one-step RT-PCR master mix reagents (Roche,
New Jersey USA), 400 nM primer and 100 nM probe. The
primers and probe used were according to Garbino et al.
[20] and the cycling condition is 30 min at 48°C, 10 min
at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 min
at 60°C. In addition, 5 μL of eluted RNA were used for
amplification with a QIAGEN one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reagent. RT-PCR and sequencing for HA
and NA were performed according to Tsai et al. [19].
Nucleotide Sequence Analysis
DNA sequence analysis was performed using software
from the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG)
[19,21,22]. All nucleotide sequences identified in this
study have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers EU234376 to EU234451).
Phylogenetic Analysis
Alignment of the respective 739 and 251 base pairs of HA
and NA gene sequences was performed using the DNASTAR MegAlign clustal method. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on
Kimura's 2-parameter distance matrix with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using the MEGA (version 3.0) and
PHYLIP (version 3.6) software packages [23-25]. We used
MEGA for construction of neighbor-joining trees and
PHYLIP for parsimony and maximum-likelihood meth-

Figure influenza B virus outbreak in North Taiwan between October 2006 and February 2007
Data on1
Data on influenza B virus outbreak in North Taiwan between October 2006 and February 2007. Of 452 clinical
respiratory samples examined, 145 (32%) tested positive for a B/Malaysia/2506/04-like strain (B reassortant lineage). The data
came from 4 outbreaks and 2 group samples: Outbreak I, 8 patients from Yilan, Jiaosi (YLJS); outbreak II, 7 patients from ShaiJin, Yilan, Wujie (YLWJ-SJ); outbreak III, 5 patients from Li-Tse, Yilan, Wujie (YLWJ-LT); outbreak IV, 5 patients from Yilan,
Toucheng (YLTC); group 1, 110 patients from other clinics of CDVL; group 2, 10 patients from Taipei-VGH ordinary clinic.

ods to verify the topology of taxas shown in the trees. In
this study, all trees are shown as the neighbor-joining tree
from MEGA.
Hemagglutinin Inhibition Test
HI testing of 2006–2007 samples was performed using
the World Health Organization (WHO) Influenza Reagent Kit for identifying influenza isolates, produced and
distributed by WHO collaborating center for surveillance,
epidemiology and control of influenza in American Continent (CDC, USA) as described in the kit's manual. Reference strain samples consisted of distinct influenza B antisera from four epidemics: B/Malaysia/2506/04 (B reassortant lineage), B/Hong Kong/330/01 (Victoria lineage), B/
shanghai/361/02 (Yamagata lineage), and B/Sichuan/
379/99 (Yamagata lineage).

Results
Reassortant Influenza B Virus Epidemiology
Among HA screening tests positive cases from 452 specimens, 145 (32%) were confirmed to have influenza B
infection using both real-time PCR and IFA test. The epi-

demiological curve and geographic distribution analyses
demonstrated that the influenza B infection reach the
peak in December 2006 and there were four outbreaks in
Yilan county located in the northern region of Taiwan:
outbreak I, 8 children from Jiaosi town; outbreak II, 7 students from Shai-Jin Elementary School in Wujie town;
outbreak III, 5 students from Li-Tse Elementary School in
Wujie town; and outbreak IV, 5 children from Toucheng
town (Figures 1 and 2). Major symptoms included vomit,
rhinorrhea, myalgia, diarrhea, prostration, lethargy,
pharynegeal vesicles or ulcers, cough, sore throat, headache, and fever (temperature > 38°C), with a duration of
1–2 weeks. Of the patients from Yilan county, all 25 were
in kindergarten or primary school, aged between 6 and 8
years old.
Phylogenetic Analysis
According to results obtained from phylogenetic analyses
of nearly full-length HA nucleotide sequences for the HA1
subunit (1100 nt) of influenza B virus isolates from 39
patients including 38 children and 1 adult (B/Taiwan/
3842/06), all isolates clustered with B/Malaysia/2506/04-

HA with a bootstrap value of 96 (P < 0.01) (Figure 3). B/
Malaysia/2506/04 has been identified by the WHO as the
primary vaccine strain for the 2006–2007 flu season in the
northern hemisphere. Note that 4 variants (cluster I) in
outbreak II clustered on a single branch with a bootstrap
value of 79 and statistical p value < 0.01 (Figure 3). In
terms of NA genes, all 37 Taiwanese isolates were identified as belonging to the B reassortant lineage (P < 0.05)
except two isolates were not PCR amplified (Figure 4).
Variation in HA and NA Amino Acid Sequences
Compared to amino acid residues 22–234 of the B/Malaysia/2506/04 HA protein, most of the Taiwanese isolates
had only 2–3 changes. Exceptions included 1 strain from
outbreak I (B/Taiwan/3009/06, 9 amino acid changes)
and 4 variants (cluster I) from outbreak II (B/Taiwan/
3802/06, B/Taiwan/3804/06, B/Taiwan/3805/06, and B/
Taiwan/3790/06, with a combined total of 14 amino acid
changes) (Table 1). Conserved region results indicate that
amino acid residues 16–77 of the B/Malaysia/2506/04
NA protein originated in the previous season's Yamagata
lineage strain (data not shown).
HI Titers
We used a panel of 4 reference sheep antisera to test the HI
titers of 10 influenza B isolates; results are presented in
Table 2. The HI titers of the B/Malaysia/2506/04-sheep
antiserum to the Taiwanese influenza virus B strains
belonged to outbreaks III, IV and the sporadic influenza B
cases ranged from 1,280 to 2,560. In contrast, only 640 to
1,280 HI titers of the B/Malaysia/2506/04-sheep antiserum were identified as belonging to outbreak II. The
number of HI titers for the B/Hong Kong/330/01-sheep
antiserum ranged from 160 to 640. The smallest numbers

Post-Vaccination Serum Antibody Responses
Pre- and post-immunized serum samples were collected
from 5 volunteers who had received the influenza vaccine
for purposes of evaluating HI titers; all 5 generated antibody titers between 160 and 640 to the virus variants in
outbreak II (Table 3). Of those 5, 3 showed 4 to 8-fold
increases in HI antibody titers. The seroconversion factor
was 1 for the patient diagnosed as immunologically
incompetent. Another patient who reported to have
received very few influenza vaccinations in the preceding
ten years had exceptionally low antibody titers in his preimmunized serum but an acceptable number following
immunization.

Discussion
At least three distinct variants of influenza B virus with origins in China have been collected from Taiwanese
patients
since
2002:
B/Shanghai/361/2002-like
(Yamagata lineage), B/Hong Kong/330/01-like (Victoria
lineage), and B/Hong Kong/1351/02-like (B reassortant
with Victoria-like HA and Yamagata-like NA genes)
[19,21,22]. We characterized influenza viruses isolated
form both children and adults living in north Taiwan
between October 2006 and February 2007 for purposes of
analyzing the antigenic properties and phylogenetic relationships of HA and NA genes from the influenza B virus
isolates. Our results suggest the increasing reappearance
of the VIC-HA/YAM-NA reassortant influenza B viruses
during this period, with most outbreaks affecting children
aged 6 to 8 years (Figures 1 and 2).
A total of 39 clinical isolates of reassortant influenza B
viruses were used for molecular evolutionary analyses of
HA and NA genes. Our results show that the HA genes
belonged to the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage (Figure 3). We
also found evidence of four outbreaks of reassortant influenza B viruses in the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage among elementary school-aged children living in Taiwan's Yilan
County. Note the 4 variants (cluster I) in outbreak II that
are clustered on a single branch in Figure 2–supported by
a bootstrap value of 79%. The statistical P-value (P < 0.01)
indicate the cluster strains for significance. These viruses
were genetically similar to the B/Malaysia/2506/04 vaccine strain that was recommended as the vaccine candidate for the 2006–2007 flu season in the northern
hemisphere. Results from sequence analyses of NA genes
from the 37 Taiwan isolates indicate that they all
belonged to the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (Figure 4)–
that is, they clustered with two strains belonging to the B
reassortant lineage, the B/Malaysia/2506/04 vaccine
strain and B/Hong Kong/1351/02.

Compared to amino acid residues 22–234 of the B/Malaysia/2506/04 HA protein, most of the Taiwanese isolates
had only 2–3 changes. Exceptions included 1 strain from
outbreak I with 9 changes and 4 variants (cluster I) from
outbreak II with 14 changes (Table 1). Genetic variation
in this highly variant region suggests a potential for these
reassortant variants to cause future outbreaks.

We performed HI tests for the identification of HA in circulating influenza B viruses. Our results show that the
majority of circulating influenza B viruses (i.e., B/Malaysia/2506/04-like viruses) collected between October 2006
to and February 2007 belonged to the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage (Table 2). The data also indicate that the lowest HA
titers were observed with sheep antisera against the other

two isolates belonging to the Yamagata lineage. We used
a panel of serum samples from 5 patients who received
influenza vaccinations to test their ability to generate protective immunity against influenza B variants isolated
from young children living in Yilan county, using seroconversion factor as our criteria. Of the 5 patients, 4
showed a minimum of 4-fold increases in HI titers postvaccination; the seroconversion factor was 1 for the fifth
patient, who was later diagnosed as immunologically
incompetent (Table 3). These results suggest that the current influenza vaccine is still effective in stimulating protective immunity against the influenza B variants that we
isolated [26-28]. Previously, Jian et al. reported a group of
influenza B viruses isolated in Taiwan during the 2004–
2005 and 2006–2007 epidemics [29]. In this study, we
identified a group of children, lived in the northern
regions of Taiwan, infected with influenza B virus variant.
Most of them had severe headache symptoms when they
had the virus infection. This has not been found by Jian et
al. In addition, we have performed "hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test" in our study (Table 2 and 3) which have
never been reported by Jian et al.

The gene variable analysis of influenza viruses can provide
information for epidemic and pandemic outbreak surveillance and determination of vaccine strain selection. In this
study, we have shown data suggesting that the contemporary vaccine was still effective in stimulating protective
immunity against the influenza B variants that we isolated. Therefore, continuous monitoring of emerging
influenza B virus variants is vital to successful control not
only locally, but also internationally.
