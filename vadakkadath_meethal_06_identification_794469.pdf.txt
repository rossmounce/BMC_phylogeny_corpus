Abstract
Background: The Caenorhabditis elegans genome is known to code for at least 1149 G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs), but the GPCR(s) critical to the regulation of reproduction in this nematode are not
yet known. This study examined whether GPCRs orthologous to human gonadotropin-releasing hormone
receptor (GnRHR) exist in C. elegans.
Results: Our sequence analyses indicated the presence of two proteins in C. elegans, one of 401 amino
acids [GenBank: NP_491453; WormBase: F54D7.3] and another of 379 amino acids [GenBank:
NP_506566; WormBase: C15H11.2] with 46.9% and 44.7% nucleotide similarity to human GnRHR1 and
GnRHR2, respectively. Like human GnRHR1, structural analysis of the C. elegans GnRHR1 orthologue (CeGnRHR) predicted a rhodopsin family member with 7 transmembrane domains, G protein coupling sites
and phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C. Of the functionally important amino acids in human
GnRHR1, 56% were conserved in the C. elegans orthologue. Ce-GnRHR was actively transcribed in adult
worms and immunoanalyses using antibodies generated against both human and C. elegans GnRHR
indicated the presence of a 46-kDa protein, the calculated molecular mass of the immature Ce-GnRHR.
Ce-GnRHR staining was specifically localized to the germline, intestine and pharynx. In the germline and
intestine, Ce-GnRHR was localized specifically to nuclei as revealed by colocalization with a DNA nuclear
stain. However in the pharynx, Ce-GnRHR was localized to the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal
musculature, suggesting a functional role for Ce-GnRHR signaling in the coupling of food intake with
reproduction. Phylogenetic analyses support an early evolutionary origin of GnRH-like receptors, as
evidenced by the hypothesized grouping of Ce-GnRHR, vertebrate GnRHRs, a molluscan GnRHR, and the
adipokinetic hormone receptors (AKHRs) and corazonin receptors of arthropods.
Conclusion: This is the first report of a GnRHR orthologue in C. elegans, which shares significant
similarity with insect AKHRs. In vertebrates, GnRHRs are central components of the reproductive
endocrine system, and the identification of a GnRHR orthologue in C. elegans suggests the potential use of
C. elegans as a model system to study reproductive endocrinology.

Background

Results

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ancient molecules that act as vital sensors of environmental and internal physiological signals in organisms. This family of
proteins which forms the largest class of cell surface receptors found in animal genomes [1,2], has an early evolutionary origin [3-6], and serves a wide variety of functions
including reproduction. Structurally, all known GPCRs
share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops.

Sequence analysis
Sequence similarity searches using the sequences of the
principal GPCR signaling components of the human HPG
axis were performed against the C. elegans genome. This
analysis indicated the presence of two proteins, one of
401 amino acids [GenBank: NP_491453] and another of
379 amino acids [GenBank: NP_506566] sharing 46.9%
and 44.7% nucleotide similarity to that of human
GnRHR1 and GnRHR2, respectively (Table 1). In addition, a leucine-rich GPCR previously reported in C. elegans
[GenBank: NM_073147] has 47.6% nucleotide similarity
to human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR)
[9]. This paper is primarily focused on the 401 amino acid
protein [GenBank: NP_491453] orthologous to human
GnRHR1. Amino acid sequence alignment of human
GnRHR1 with the C. elegans orthologue (Ce-GnRHR) and
3 other class A GPCRs demonstrated considerable
sequence similarity (Fig. 1). Like its human orthologue, 3
separate prediction algorithms used to analyze the structure of Ce-GnRHR predicted a GPCR belonging to the rhodopsin family (Figs. 1 and 2A; See additional file 1:
TM_predictions.eps; [10]). These prediction programs
indicate that Ce-GnRHR contains several structural motifs
similar to that of human GnRHR1, including 7 transmembrane domains, 3 intracellular and extracellular loops,
and amino acid residues representing PKC phosphorylation sites and G-protein coupling sites (Figs. 1 and 2A; See
additional file 1: TM_predicitions.eps; [11]). As has been
reported for all non-human GnRHR1s [11], the CeGnRHR has a long C-terminal tail (Figs. 1 and 2A) characteristic of a gene ancestral to GnRH and AKH receptors.
Although the overall amino acid sequence identity
between C. elegans and human GnRHR1 was only ~21%,
closer analysis revealed that 56% of the functionally
important amino acid residues (FIRs) of human GnRHR1
were conserved in Ce-GnRHR (Figs. 1 and 2A; Table 2).
The highest degree of conservation was observed in those
amino acids involved in receptor activation (83%), and
Gq11 coupling (62%; Table 2). Lesser conservation was
observed in amino acids important to binding pocket formation (54%), Gs coupling (50%), and PKC phosphorylation (50%). Ligand binding sites were least conserved
(36%), indicating the possibility that the ligand of CeGnRHR is significantly different from that of human
GnRHR1. Indeed, in Drosophila melanogaster, a cloned
GnRHR [12] was subsequently identified as AKHR from
ligand binding studies indicating AKH was the binding
partner of this receptor in insects [13]. In this connection,
Ce-GnRHR had the highest overall sequence similarity
(45%) and the highest FIR similarity (66%) with Drosophila melanogaster AKHR (Dm-AKHR; Table 2; [13]), a
receptor involved in metabolism (Table 2). In comparison, there was less conservation of overall sequence and
FIRs in two other human class A GPCRs, rhodopsin (12%

C. elegans is a simple, highly reproductive, multicellular
model organism appropriate to the investigation of innumerable signaling pathways at the organismal level.
Despite our knowledge of the reproductive physiology of
C. elegans, the molecular endocrinology regulating reproduction in C. elegans is unknown. The C. elegans genome
is known to code for at least 1149 GPCRs [6] but the
GPCR(s) critical to the regulation of reproduction in this
nematode are not yet known. The characterization of
membrane receptors related to the regulation of reproduction within this model nematode organism is very important for both the study of evolutionary biology as well as
the study of the molecular endocrinology of reproduction
in multicellular organisms.
In mammals, reproduction is controlled by hormones of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and hostile environmental conditions are known to suppress
HPG axis hormones, thereby decreasing or preventing
reproduction [7]. The hypothalamus acts as a sensor of the
environment to regulate the production of gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH1). GnRH1 released from
hypothalamic neurons into the hypophyseal bloodstream
binds to GnRH receptors (GnRHR1) on gonadotropes of
the anterior pituitary signaling for the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. Gonadotropins in turn bind to
receptors on the gonads leading to the production of the
sex steroids [8]. The presence of a complex endocrine axis
that regulates reproduction in C. elegans has not been contemplated, since central components of this axis – gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) and its
ligand(s) – have not been reported.
In this study we demonstrate that C. elegans contains a
GnRHR (Ce-GnRHR) orthologous to GnRHR1 in humans
and to the adipokinetic hormone receptors (AKHRs) of
insects, and that Ce-GnRHR specifically localizes to the
nuclei of germline and intestinal cells, and to the myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal musculature. Our results
support the presence of an evolutionarily conserved
GPCR possibly involved in reproduction and metabolism
in C. elegans.

the C-terminus portion of Ce-GnRHR absent from human GnRHR1, while the red line traces the correspondence between
the ends of human GnRHR1 exon 1 and Dm-AKHR exon 3. Arrows superimposed upon Ce-GnRHR represent the locations

and 41%; respectively) and vasopressin receptor type 1A
(18% and 44%; respectively) when compared with C. elegans (21% and 56%; respectively; Table 2). This comparative analysis suggests Ce-GnRHR is orthologous to insect
AKHR and human GnRHR. The relatively greater conservation of FIRs observed between Ce-GnRHR, Dm-AKHR
and human GnRHR1 (56–66% similarity; Table 2), suggests these proteins are all derived from a single ancestral
GPCR, and, are thus orthologous to each other.
Despite the orthology of these sequences, the genomic
organization of Ce-GnRHR, human GnRHR1, and DmAKHR are radically different (Fig. 2B). The coding region
of each gene contains a different number of exons: 6 in
Ce-GnRHR, 5 in Dm-AKHR, and 3 in human GnRHR1.
Intronic sequence length is also variable. While the 2
introns of human GnRHR1 total more than 10 kilobases,
the 4 introns of Dm-AKHR only amount to ~1 kilobase.
Additionally, sequence corresponding to the 3' end of CeGnRHR exon 5 and all of Ce-GnRHR exon 6 is absent
from human GnRHR. In order to deduce the genomic
organization of a gene ancestral to all three of these
GnRHR(-like) genes, a considerably larger number of

genes would have to be analyzed. Yet, at least one coincidental feature of the gene maps shown in Fig. 2B might be
indicative of ancestral gene structure: exon 1 of human
GnRHR and exon 3 of DM-AKHR terminate at the same
point.
Identification and immunolocalization of Ce-GnRHR
To determine whether Ce-GnRHR was transcribed in the
worm, we isolated RNA, and, using two gene-specific
primers, amplified the region depicted in Fig. 2B. The
expected 946 bp cDNA fragment encompassing exons 2
through 6 was detected (Fig. 2C). The sequence of the
amplified cDNA [GenBank; NM_059052], matched the
genomic sequence (chromosome 1; [GenBank:
NC_003279]), minus intronic sequence, demonstrating
that the amplified cDNA was amplified from Ce-GnRHR
mRNA template. This confirms that Ce-GnRHR is actively
transcribed in adult C. elegans.

To determine whether Ce-GnRHR protein was expressed
in C. elegans, we generated a polyclonal antibody against
the C-terminus (amino acids 386 to 401) of Ce-GnRHR
and the nematode homogenate was subjected to immu-

noblot analyses. The affinity purified anti-Ce-GnRHR
antibody recognized a 46-kDa band (Fig. 3A), the calculated molecular weight of Ce-GnRHR, as well as higher
molecular weight (116-kDa, 237-kDa) variants that might
represent mature or otherwise post-translationally modified species and lower molecular weight (27-kDa and 23kDa) variants that might represent truncated protein
products, as we have reported for human GnRHR1 [14].
Despite limited similarity between the N-terminus of the
human and C. elegans receptor, a monoclonal antibody
raised against the N-terminus of human GnRHR1 identifies a single band of 46-kDa in the C. elegans homogenate
(See 2: Immunoblot 1.eps) and produces similar immunolocalization (see below); however, it remains unclear
whether this antibody is detecting Ce-GnRHR. The specificity of the polyclonal antibody against Ce-GnRHR for CeGnRHR compared to the putative orthologue to human
GnRHR2 [GenBank; NP_506566] (orthologue 2) is indi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/103

cated by the fact that the antibody does not recognize a
band at 43.5-kDa, the molecular weight of the immature
form of orthologue 2 (Fig. 3A). Additionally, comparison
of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization of
Ce-GnRHR and orthologue 2 revealed limited similarity
between the two genes, especially at the C-terminus of CeGnRHR – against which the anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody was
raised (See additional file 3: Ortho.eps).
To examine the localization of Ce-GnRHR, eggs were
immunostained with the monoclonal antibody against
human GnRHR1, or the anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody (Fig.
3B). Both the N-terminus (anti-human-GnRHR1 antibody) and C-terminus (anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody) antibodies immunolabeled the same structures (see also later,
Fig. 4), indicating that Ce-GnRHR is expressed in eggs.
With both antibodies, intense staining was observed
within the egg, but not the cuticle (Fig. 3B). Staining was

Immunohistochemical localization of Ce-GnRHR was performed on eggs after freeze fracture using a monoclonal antibody
against human GnRHR1 (above) or an affinity purified polyclonal antibody against Ce-GnRHR (below). Eggs were similarly
stained by both antibodies. No immunoreactivity was detected in eggs probed with the secondary antibody alone. Scale: eggs –
50 μm.

not apparent in eggs treated with secondary antibody
alone. The authenticity of the anti-human GnRHR1 antibody was verified by positive staining of gonadotropes in
sections of human pituitary (data not shown).
To better localize cellular staining in worms, we permeabilized worms and performed whole-mount fluorescent
immunohistochemistry. These experiments indicated that
Ce-GnRHR was localized to the nucleus of maturing
oocytes and intestinal cells (Fig. 4i–iii), to sperm, pharyngeal muscles (see later), but not other cells such as hypodermal cells. Similar staining of these structures was
evident for both the anti-human-GnRHR1 and anti-CeGnRHR antibodies. Ce-GnRHR staining clearly illustrates
an increase in the size of the oocyte nuclei as they mature
along the gonadal arm (Fig. 4i, 4iii). Upon fertilization,
Ce-GnRHR staining becomes diffuse throughout the
developing egg, although staining appears to increase during egg development (see Figs. 3B for staining of laid
eggs). Only uniform background autofluorescence was
apparent in worms treated with secondary antibody alone
(Figs. 4iv, 4v).
Interestingly, Ce-GnRHR also was detected along the
myofilament lattice of the pharyngeal muscles as evidenced by 1). staining along the three parallel muscles
that comprise the pharyngeal musculature beginning at
the tip of the head and extending to the pharyngeal bulb
(Fig. 5i; taken near the center of the body axis), 2). staining of all 8 pharyngeal muscle (pm1-8) domains, but not
in the gaps between contractile zones of adjacent pharyngeal muscle domains (Fig. 5i), and 3). staining of myofilaments that run radially towards the lumen and which are
most obvious in the bulbs (Fig. 5i; see online Handbook
of Worm Anatomy [15] and [16] for details of pharyngeal
anatomy). In Fig. 5ii taken at a higher focal plain, only
one muscle lattice is observed (radial filaments are seen
"end-on" pointing downward into the plane of section
towards the lumen). These results indicate Ce-GnRHR is
present on the pharyngeal musculature.
The specificity of binding of anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody to
GnRHR was demonstrated by the lack of staining
throughout the worm (including the germline, pharyngeal muscle and intestinal cells) when the antibody was
preincubated with its antigen (the C-terminus amino
acids 386 to 401 as described in the Methods; Fig. 5iii).
To confirm the nuclear localization of Ce-GnRHR, we
stained C. elegans with Ce-GnRHR antibody and a nuclear
stain (Hoechst dye) and superimposed the images. There
was a clear overlap between Ce-GnRHR immunoreactivity
and the nuclear stain in both oocytes and intestinal cell
nuclei (Fig. 6i–vi), demonstrating that Ce-GnRHR was
localized to the nuclear membrane of oocytes and intesti-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/103

nal cells. At higher magnification, separate chromosomes
are evident with the Hoechst stain (Fig. 6ix) while CeGnRHR staining is uniform (Fig. 6viii), suggesting that
Ce-GnRHR stains the membrane rather than intranuclear
structures. This was again demonstrated by the scattered
color of the superimposed image (Fig. 6x). In summary,
these results indicate that Ce-GnRHR is present on the
nuclear membrane of oocytes and intestinal cells. Further,
these results corroborate earlier reports of GnRHR1 localization to the nucleus of proliferating cells [17,18].
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum parsimony analysis of the Class A and B GPCR
dataset (422 amino acids; See additional file 4:
GPCRs_alignment.pdf) yielded 3 most parsimonious
trees, the strict consensus of which resulted in the collapse
of only 3 nodes (Fig. 7). Relatively robust support (68%
boostrap proportion) was found for a group comprising
all 3 vertebrate GnRHR types, and, though not achieving
strong bootstrap support, all most parsimonious trees
contained a group comprising tunicate GnRHR (Ciona
intestinalis), insect corazonin receptors, and all vertebrate
GnRHRs. Recovered in all of the most parsimonious trees,
a monophyletic group of AKHRs was hypothesized as the
sister group to the group Ce-GnRHR + C. briggsaeGnRHR. Together with the molluscan GnRHR (Crassotrea
gigas), these receptors were hypothesized to be the sister
group to the group of corazonin receptors + chordate
GnRHRs discussed above. The group of all GnRHRs and
GnRHR-like receptors was recovered more often than not
(61% bootstrap proportion), to the exclusion of other
Class A GPCRs included in the analysis.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of
a GPCR in the nematode C. elegans with homology to
human GnRHR1 and AKHRs of insects (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6; Tables 1 &2). The nematode GPCR superfamily consists
of 170 rhodopsin-like receptors, 650 seven-TM chemoreceptors, and other similar proteins, and represents the
largest gene family accounting for more than 5% of the
entire C. elegans genome [19]. Evidence that this GPCR
[WormBase: F54D7.3] is orthologous to the human
GnRHR1 and Dm-AKHR is supported by the findings
that, 1) the next closest potential orthologue to human
GnRHR1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; [GenBank:
NM_073809]) has considerably less identity (amino acid
= 13.8%, E-score = 7.1) to human GnRHR1 than F54D7.3
(amino acid = 22.2%, E-score = 0.45). Likewise, the next
closest potential orthologue to Dm-AKHR (hypothetical
protein Y116A8B.5; [GenBank: CAA16290]) has less identity (amino acid = 21.8%, E-score = 2e-18) to Dm-AKHR
than F54D7.3 (amino acid = 28.7%, E-score = 2e-45); 2)
the alignment of F54D7.3 with human GnRHR1 and two
other Class A GPCRs, rhodopsin and vasopressin receptor

type 1A, showed that the functionally important amino
acids of F54D7.3 were significantly more similar to the
same sites in human GnRHR (56%; Table 2). Likewise, the
alignment of F54D7.3 with Dm-GnRHR also indicated
significant similarity between the functionally important
amino acids (66%; Table 2), and 3) this GPCR was
actively transcribed in the adult worm (Fig. 2C) and its
translated protein was localized to the germline, fertilized
eggs, intestine, and pharynx (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). Likewise, in
Drosophila melanogaster AKHR was most highly expressed
in ovaries, digestive system, brain, tracheae and fat body
cells, although immunoreactivity appeared to be more
cytoplasmic in nature [20].
Phylogenetic analysis supports the idea that the evolutionary relationships of Ce-GnRHR place it somewhere
between the vertebrate GnRHRs and insect AKHRs,
though it is more closely allied with AKHRs (Fig. 7; Table
2). The strict consensus tree of select Class A and B GPCRs
(Fig. 7) provides minimal bootstrap support for many of
the deeper nodes, but three conservative conclusions relevant to our study of Ce-GnRHR may be drawn from the
phylogenetic analysis: (1) Ce-GnRHR is more closely
related to insect AKHRs than to chordate GnRHRs or corazonin receptors, (2) vertebrate GnRHRs comprise a distinct group of receptors, separate from all other GnRHRlike receptors, including Ce-GnRHR, and, (3) the classification of Ce-GnRHR [F54D7.3] as a GnRHR-like receptor
(as opposed to another class of GPCR) is supported.
The Ce-GnRHR ligand has not been identified. Intriguingly, though, we have shown that human GnRH
increases both egg laying (17%) and viable offspring
(42%) in C. elegans (Vadakkadath Meethal et al., 2004
[21] and unpublished data), although it is unclear at this
stage whether human GnRH1 binds Ce-GnRHR. GnRHR
and GnRH/GnRH-like oligopeptides have been identified
in all mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate species
[11,22] studied to date, as well as other vertebrates and
invertebrates (octopus, tunicates, lamprey, fish, frogs, etc)
[23-25]. While a variety of invertebrate species, including
numerous insects and the oyster, Crassotrea gigas, have
been shown to possess GnRHR orthologues, insects bind
a distinct, non-GnRH-like peptide (AKH) [13,24]. In
insects, AKHs are secreted from endocrine cells of the corpora cardiaca into the hemolymph [26] and mobilize
energy reserve from storages (from fat body) and regulate
energy homeostasis [27] by signaling through AKHRs.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have
garnered increasingly strong support for the group Ecdysozoa [28,29], the major phyla of which are Arthropoda
and Nematoda. Under this phylogenetic hypothesis, it is
not unreasonable to expect a nematode GnRHR will bind
an AKH-like peptide. Yet, an invertebrate GnRH peptide

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/103

has been biochemically characterized in the mollusk Octopus vulgaris. Given the placement of Ce-GnRHR in the
topology of our phylogenetic hypothesis – between the
AKHRs and the molluscan GnRHR (oyster), whose ligand
is unknown, but may very well be GnRH – another possibility is that Ce-GnRHR is a receptor capable of binding
AKH- and GnRH-like ligands. A final, equally plausible
possibility is that Ce-GnRHR binds an altogether different
hormone specific to nematodes, which is supported by
the relatively low conservation of ligand binding amino
acid residues for both human GnRHR and Dm-AKHR
(Table 2).
Ce-GnRHR localized to the nucleus of germline and intestinal cells, as well as to the myofilamant lattice of the pharyngeal musculature (Fig. 5). Although GnRHR1 is
traditionally thought of as a plasma membrane receptor
[30,11], it is becoming increasingly evident that GnRHR1
can be internalized from the plasma membrane to the
nucleus [18]. Indeed, the nuclear localization of GnRHR1
has been reported in rapidly proliferating cells such as
pancreatic and breast cancer cells [17,31]. Ligand binding
to GnRHR may be the stimulus for the nuclear internalization of the receptor since GnRH has been shown to be
rapidly internalized to the nuclear membrane prior to
entry into the nucleus [18]. Although we did not detect
intense Ce-GnRHR staining in germline and intestinal
plasma membranes (Fig. 4), it remains to be determined
whether Ce-GnRHR localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6) is
from de novo receptor synthesized in the cytosol or from
Ce-GnRHR translocalization from the plasma membrane.
Nevertheless, the localization of Ce-GnRHR to the
nucleus provides an exceptional molecular marker of
nuclear growth as germ cells progress through the gonadal
arm prior to fertilization (Fig. 4).
In vertebrates, GnRH neurons originate from the olfactory
placode during organogenesis [32-36]. GnRH secretion
from hypothalamic neurons is tightly influenced by environmental conditions [37-40], and this environmental
sensing mechanism regulates reproduction [41,42].
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that GnRH1 increases
the excitability of olfactory receptor neurons, that the terminal nerve functions to modulate the odorant sensitivity
of olfactory receptor neurons and that this signaling is
tightly linked to reproduction [43]. The localization of CeGnRHR to the germline, pharynx, and intestine (Figs. 4, 5,
6) is suggestive of a role in modulating reproductive function in accordance with environmental conditions. Like
the human, the nematode also regulates reproduction
dependent upon environmental signals [44] and it is well
demonstrated that reproduction in C. elegans is strictly
controlled by environmental cues such as food and temperature. Under adverse conditions (starvation, high population densities and high temperature), C. elegans can

enter a reproductively inactive alternative third larval
stage called dauer [45,46]. The decision to enter the developmentally arrested dauer larval stage is triggered by a
combination of signals from sensory neurons in response
to environmental cues [45-47]. Although signaling
between olfactory neurons and the reproductive system
has been demonstrated in C. elegans [41], it is unclear
what signaling pathways are involved. It does however
suggest the presence of an endocrine system that regulates
reproduction in response to environmental conditions.

served GnRHR in C. elegans opens the way to using this
organism as a model system to study reproductive endocrinology.

We propose a model whereby a putative signaling peptide
(GnRH, GnRH-like peptide, and/or AKH) in C. elegans
may be released into the body of the worm from neurons
in the head during favorable conditions, where it can then
act to signal through Ce-GnRHR located on the pharyngeal musculature, intestine and germ cells (Figs. 4, 5, 6).
In this way, this peptide signaling can simultaneously initiate both pharyngeal pumping and reproduction when
food is plentiful. Interestingly, the dauer-inducing pheromone detected by sensory neurons in C. elegans signals
by a complex pathway to the germline, pharynx, intestine,
and the ectoderm [46,48]. Indeed, it has recently been
shown that octopus GnRH (oct-GnRH) has a contractile
effect on the radula retractor muscle which expresses octGnRHR [23], and that oct-GnRH mRNA-expressing cell
bodies and immunoreactive fibers are present on the
superior buccal lobe suggesting that oct-GnRH is involved
in feeding behavior generated by contractions of the muscle of the buccal mass [49]. The coupling of food intake to
reproduction by such a mechanism would allow for the
rapid development and subsequent reproduction of the
worm. It is intriguing that Ce-GnRHR is closely related
evolutionary with human GnRHR and insect AKHR,
involved in regulating reproduction and metabolism,
respectively. Ce-GnRHR may provide a molecular link
between reproduction and metabolism.

Materials
GnRHR1 monoclonal antibody (F1G4) raised against the
N-terminus 1–29 amino acids of human GnRHR1 was a
kind gift from Dr. Anjali Karande of the Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore, India [52]. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against C-terminus amino acids 386 to 401
(Ac-GIDKRNHNVQLEIIDFC-OH) of Ce-GnRHR (The
New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA), a region not
found in human GnRHR1. This sequence was chosen
based on antigenicity and to limit cross-reactivity with
other proteins. The C-terminus included a cysteine for
coupling purposes and the N-terminus was blocked by
acetylation. Rabbits were immunized with this HPLCpurified antigen (structural confirmation was determined
by mass spectrometry) using standard procedures (The
New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA). Titer levels
were monitored periodically in the animals and the animals bled after 60 days. The serum was then affinity purified (The New England Peptides Inc., Gardner, MA) for
use in immunodetection assays. Secondary antibodies
including goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2055; for the
GnRHR1 monoclonal antibody), goat anti-rabbit IgGHRP (sc-2054; for the Ce-GnRHR antibody) as well as the
Western blotting luminal reagent were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA.

Conclusion
The sequence similarity, structural organization and localization of Ce-GnRHR provide evidence of an evolutionarily conserved GnRHR orthologue in C. elegans. Coupled
with the presence of a leucine-rich GPCR (LGR) in C. elegans with sequence similarity to vertebrate gonadotropin
receptors [9] and the detection of estrogen binding proteins in C. elegans [50], these results suggest the existence
of an ancestral endocrine system for the regulation of
reproduction in C. elegans. Whilst our studies are suggestive of a role of Ce-GnRHR in reproduction in C. elegans,
further studies are required to elucidate the signaling
pathways and functional role of this GPCR. Identification
of the Ce-GnRHR ligand will provide important insights
into evolutionary biology, invertebrate systematics, and
the reproductive neuroendocrinology of nematodes.
Regardless, our identification of an evolutionarily con-

Transmembrane regions of Ce-GnRHR were predicted
using the following programs: TMHMM V.2.0 [55], DASTMfilter [56] and PSIPRED [57]. In order to determine the
level of conservation of functionally important amino
acid residues, Ce-GnRHR was aligned with human
GnRHR1 [GenBank: NP_000397], Dm-AKHR [GenBank:
AAC61523], human vasopressin receptor type 1A [GenBank: NP_000697], and human rhodopsin [GenBank:
NP_000530]. Homologous FIRs were identified through
comparison to a previously reported structural prediction
of human GnRHR1 [11]. In pairwise comparisons, FIRs
were scored as 'similar' based on the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix – i.e., if the two residues belonged to any one

of the following groups of similar amino acids, which
have positive scores in the BLOSUM62 matrix: [WYF],
[ST], [AS], [RKQ], [NSHD], [DE], [QKE], [YH], or [VIML].
Percent similarity for each type of FIR was calculated using
the formula: (identical comparisons + (0.5 * similar comparisons))/total comparisons) * 100. Comparative
genomic organization of Ce-GnRHR, human GnRHR1,
and Dm-AKHR was deduced from comparison of our
sequence alignment with the exon and intron lengths
retrieved from GenBank sequence annotations.
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from 10 adult worms using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Ce-GnRHR cDNA was synthesized
and amplified using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR
system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Both cDNA synthesis
and PCR amplification were carried out using gene specific primers: 5' – GGT AAA AGT TCG ACG GGT GCA - 3'
and 5' - GTT ATT TGT TTT GCC GCC GTC A - 3'. PCR
product was run on a 4% Metaphor agarose gel (Cambrex
Bio Science, Rockland, ME), and DNA was extracted from
bands using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracted PCR product was cycle sequenced
using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Madison, WI) and automated
sequencing was performed at the University of Wisconsin
Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). To ensure that
sequenced PCR products were indeed Ce-GnRHR cDNA
and not the result of amplification of residual genomic
DNA in the RNA sample, sequenced PCR products were
aligned with C. elegans cosmid F54D7 [GenBank:
AF039712] and checked for the absence of intronic
sequence.
Western immunoblotting
Worms raised in liquid culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min., washed 3 times with S-basal
and then filtered through a Whatman filter paper No. 1
(70 mm) under mild suction in order to remove adherent
bacteria. Worms were collected, washed in S-basal and
pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g for 3 min. Worms and
bacteria were collected separately, re-suspended in a small
volume of S-basal containing protease inhibitors (1 mM
phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of Pepstatin A; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and the samples then subjected
to 4 cycles of sonication at 30 Hz with intermittent cooling. Following protein assay, 40 μg of total nematode and
bacterial protein (control) were resuspended in sample
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v)
SDS, 10% glycerol, 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1%
bromophenol blue) and separated using polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (10–20% Tricine gels, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Following electrophoresis and electro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/103

phoretic transfer (Immobilon-P transfer membrane pore
size 0.45um, Millipore) membranes were probed with
antibodies using standard techniques as previously
described [58].
Immunohistochemistry
Isolated eggs and hermaphrodite worms were washed in
M9 buffer prior to mounting on poly-L lysine (100%)
coated slides and cover slipped. Following the wicking of
residual liquid from the slide with Whatman paper,
worms were freeze fractured according to Miller and
Shakes [59]. Briefly, slides were frozen on dry ice for 30
min., the cover slip was quickly removed using a razor
blade and the slide then immersed in cold methanol followed by cold acetone (5 min. each). Immunostaining
was performed as per standard procedures. Briefly, worms
were washed in 1% NGS (in TBS) for 10 min., 10% NGS
for 30 min. and 1% NGS for 1 min. Slides were incubated
with the anti-human GnRHR1 antibody F1G4 (dilution:
1:250) or with the affinity purified anti-Ce-GnRHR antibody (1:125) overnight at 4°C. Slides were then rinsed in
1%, 10% and 1% NGS for 10 min. each prior to incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min. at room temperature. Slides were washed with 1% NGS three times prior
to DAB staining and mounting with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA). Controls treated with
secondary antibody alone were similarly processed.
Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted
microscope connected to a Fluo Arc light source and an
Axio Cam MRC-5 camera. Images were visualized and
scaled using Axio Vision 4.0.

For whole-mounted fluorescent immunohistochemistry,
hermaphrodite worm cuticles were permeabilized using
Tris-Triton buffer with 1% mercaptoethanol and cellular
contents fixed according to Finney and Ruvkun [60] as
modified by Miller and Shakes [59]. Worms were immunoprobed with GnRHR antibodies and fluorescently
tagged secondary antibodies and images captured as
described above. To localize nuclei, Hoechst dye (20 μl of
7 μg/μl) was added to the mounting medium and fluorescent staining detected using a DAPI filter [59].
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of 52 Class A and B GPCRs
were retrieved from the GPCR data base [61] including
representatives of vertebrate GnRHRs, insect cardioregulatory peptide receptors, corazonin receptors, and AKHRs,
and a variety of rhodopsin, vasopressin, and oxytocin
receptors from a wide variety of animal species. Sequences
were aligned in ClustalX [62] using default gap penalties,
and any positions of the initial alignment represented by
less than half of the sequences were excised in BioEdit
[63]. Excision resulted in a 422 amino acid dataset centered on the seven transmembrane domains and the inter-

vening intra- and extracellular domains. Maximum
parsimony analysis (1000 random sequence addition replicates with TBR perturbation) of the dataset was performed in PAUP*4.0b10 [64]. An unrooted, strict
consensus tree was constructed from the most parsimonious trees. Bootstrapping, also performed in PAUP, was
used to assess the support for relationships represented in
the consensus tree: 500 boostrap replicates, 10 random
sequence addition each.

Prediction of transmembrane domains (TMs) in human GnRHR1 and
Ce-GnRHR. The sequence alignment of human GnRHR1 and CeGnRHR presented here is taken from Figure 1; Thus for consistency, some
sites are represented by gaps in both sequences. Functionally important
residues (FIRs) are colored (see legend for classification). Overall, there
is 56 % similarity between the FIRs of human GnRHR1 and Ce-GnRHR.
TMs for both human GnRHR1 and the Ce-GnRHR were predicted using
multiple programs described in Methods and are represented as colored
lines above/below the alignment. Each program predicted Ce-GnRHR,
like human GnRHR1, to have 7 TMs.
