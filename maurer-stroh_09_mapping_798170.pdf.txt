Abstract
: In this work, we study the consequences of sequence variations of the "2009 H1N1" (swine or
Mexican flu) influenza A virus strain neuraminidase for drug treatment and vaccination. We find that
it is phylogenetically more closely related to European H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 avian flu rather
than to the H1N1 counterparts in the Americas. Homology-based 3D structure modeling reveals
that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with
the active site. The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors:
oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective
for treatment. However, the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine
development, serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous
strains and already vary among patients.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Sandor Pongor and L. Aravind.

Findings
The recent epidemic of the "2009 H1N1" influenza A
virus (also called swine or Mexican flu) has put the world
on alert since a new swine flu strain (naturally hosted by
pigs) has crossed the species barrier to human and, apparently, acquired the capability for human to human transmission [1,2]. Given earlier experiences with risks of viral
pandemics such as SARS and the avian flu [3], global control and public health surveillance mechanisms provided
sequences of the new flu strain in public sequence databases within weeks of the outbreak. Here, we analyze the
protein sequence of its neuraminidase with respect to sim-

ilarities and differences to known strains and implications
on drug treatment and vaccination.
Domain architecture and posttranslational modifications
Sequence and residue numbering in this analysis correspond to the neuraminidase [Genbank: ACP41107.1
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/227809834] representative for the new strain. Sequence analysis was carried
out following an established protocol using the ANNIE
resource [4,5]. The 469 amino acid long neuraminidase
(NA) protein (Figure 1) is essential for release of the viral
particle from the outer membrane of infected cells by

cleaving sialic acid from host glycoproteins that are recognized by the viral hemagglutinin [6]. As a type II transmembrane protein, it is N-terminally attached to the
membrane [7]. It consists of a tiny cytoplasmic tail at the
N-terminus (residues 1 to 6) [8] followed by the transmembrane region (residues 7 to 34) that is also responsible for translocation of the protein [9].
Next, a presumably unstructured linker region (residues
35 to 82) connects the membrane anchor to the catalytic
neuraminidase domain (residues 83 to 469; Figure 1).
Such unstructured linker regions are rich in small and
polar residues and often harbour sites for posttranslational modifications [10,11]. Probable posttranslational
modification sites in the neuraminidase of the new strain
are glycosylation motifs involving N88, N146 and N235,
which correspond to residues that are also glycosylated in
other subtype neuraminidases [12]. However, the minimal and non-specific consensus motif of glycosylation
sites (Nx [ST]) is found in total 8 times in the new strain
sequence with an apparent clustering (50%) in the
unstructured linker region (Figure 1). Interestingly,
another putative novel glycosylation site N386, which is

unique to the new strain, would be accessible on the surface, as seen in the structural models.
Comparing among all strains, the sequence variation is
largest in the linker region, including large deleted segments. Nevertheless, this region harbours a cysteine (Figure 2) that can be aligned over multiple NA subtypes and
is conserved in N1-N5 and N8, but not in N6, N7 and N9.
Earlier reports assume that, at least in related viruses,
cysteines in the non-globular region could be involved in
intermolecular disulfide bridges [13-15]. Alternatively, by
analogy to other influenza proteins such as hemagglutinin [16] and M2 protein [17], it cannot yet be excluded
that cysteine C49 is palmitoylated and that the anchor
localizes the protein to lipid rafts [18].
Phylogenetic relation of new NA to known subtypes
Influenza A virus protein sequences were downloaded
from NCBI (as of April 29th). Neuraminidases were identified by BLAST (E-value < 0.001) [19] using the representative NA of the new strain as query [Genbank:
ACP41107.1
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/

ing sequences were aligned with MAFFT (using L-INS-I
settings [21]) and the resulting multiple alignment was
visualized and annotated in Jalview [22]. A neighbour
joining tree with pairwise gap deletion, Poisson correction
as distance measure and 500 bootstrap replicates (generated with MEGA [23]) produces robust groupings consistent with previous studies [24] for the known NA subtypes
(clustering of N1, N4, N5+N8 on one side and N2, N3,
N6+N7+N9 on the other) and reliably places the new NA
with other N1s. Interestingly, inside the N1 cluster, the
new NA appeared close to the N1 of H5N1 avian flu
viruses. The alignment and corresponding phylogenetic
tree are available at http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/
SEQUENCES/H1N1/.
Hence, we repeated the analysis (same protocol as outlined above) for a detailed mapping of only the N1 subtype family with the difference of allowing 95% sequence
identity for sequences before 2009 but keeping all new
NA sequences (as of April 29th). A characteristic clustering
emerges (Figure 3) that roughly corresponds to host and
geographic distributions, consistent with previous reports
[25,26]. The observed clustering is robust in respect to the
method used for tree generation (same for maximum parsimony or neighbour joining trees with JTT distance and
gamma-distributed variable rates). The 2009 NA is part of
a cluster of avian-like swine flu H1N1 strains predominantly found in European pigs. However, previous examples of human infections from swine flu are also part of
the same cluster, for example from 2005 in Thailand [27].
This indicates that, similar to the current outbreak, closely
related H1N1 strains have crossed species boundaries on
previous occasions as also evidenced by further reports in
the literature [28-30].
Moreover, neuroaminidases of these new H1N1 swine flu
examples are more similar to H5N1 avian flu strains than
other H1N1 variants found in the Americas or than that of
the historic strains such as the 1918 Spanish flu [31]. This
is surprising since avian flu strains typically have different
hemaglutinin (HA) subtypes (e.g. H5N1). Combinations
of HA and NA subtypes need to be fine-tuned to recognize
the same type of sialic acid modifications to allow smooth
interplay of the two proteins, which is important for the
viral cycle [6]. These results support the notion that, also
inside the family of N1 subtypes, a clear distinction can be
made between avian-like H1N1, such as the one from the
current outbreak, and other existing H1N1 strains.
Structural modelling and mapping of new mutations
The crystal structures of both the historic 1918 NA as well
as the avian flu NA are available in complex with currently
used drugs. We created a homology model of the new
2009 swine flu NA to map the sequence differences to the
three-dimensional structure templates. Using Modeller
[32], the sequence of the new neuraminidase [Genbank

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/18

Accession: ACP41107.1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
protein/227809834] was modelled 50 times onto multiple templates (PDB: 2hu4[33], 3ckz[34], 3b7e[35],
3beq[35]) and the resulting best model (as judged by
DOPE score) further refined with short simulated annealing MD simulations in the presence of a bound inhibitor
(zanamivir, oseltamivir or peramivir) as implemented in
the Yasara Structure package [36]. The final atom-resolution models are available in PDB format at http://men
del.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/H1N1/.
We mapped the level of residue conservation (calculated
with the evolutionary trace algorithm [37]) from the multiple alignment of all NA subtypes to its corresponding
position in the structure. The results show the strict conservation close to the neuraminidase catalytic site, which
also serves as the drug binding pocket (Figure 4A). The
remaining conserved patches (for example the sites
around N104 or below N146) fit into each other and form
the dimerization/tetramerization interfaces [35]. A model
of the dimeric version is available in PDB format at http:/
/mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/H1N1/.
Next, we compared the sequences of the new strain with
the related H5N1 from avian flu and H1N1 from the
Spanish flu (Figure 5). Among 387 residues that were
structurally modelled, the "2009 H1N1" neuraminidase
differs from the other two in 21 positions. The mapping
to the structure (Figure 4B) shows that the novel sequence
mutations are distributed all around the surface of the
molecule leaving the hydrophobic core, but also the catalytic site, essentially untouched. Importantly, none of the
new mutations appears sufficiently close to affect the drug
binding pocket. For example, all 17 residues within 3 Å of
the zanamivir molecule bound to the active site are fully
conserved among all three strains. The closest mutation is
the conservative V149I substitution at a distance of ~10 Å
to zanamivir and ~7 Å to oseltavimir.
It has to be noted that indirect effects of the mutations
that may alter the binding pocket also from a greater distance are difficult to assess and cannot be excluded. To
this extent, we have analysed coevolution patterns in an
extensive alignment of more than 6000 non-identical
Influenza A neuraminidases to eventually identify connected networks of residues using the SCA algorithm [38]
as implemented in [39], but no network that would connect the surface directly to the core and catalytic site was
found (see supplementary material). In fact, all positions
of the observed mutations are at the surface and naturally
variable, as judged by the conservation and SCA analysis,
which would rather indicate that they do not have an
effect on the structure of the more distant binding pocket.
Thus, we conclude that the drug binding pocket remains
unchanged in the new strain and, hence, the binding

behaviour of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) and zanamivir (Relenza®) should be unaffected. Indeed, initial clinical reports suggest that the new
virus is susceptible to the two drugs [40]. Our findings
support this notion and provide a molecular mechanism.
Furthermore, the third currently tested neuraminidase
inhibitor, peramivir, should also be effective since it also
shares the same binding pocket.
Next, we review how the new mutations affect vaccine
development through altering antibody interactions as well
as antigenic regions. There are 3 crystal structures of related
neuraminidases in complex with antibodies [41-43]. In
Figure 5, we annotate residues that are within 3 Å distance
to the respective bound antibody and, hence, crucial for the
interaction. Interestingly, residues in sites recognized by
both NC41 and NC10 antibodies appear mutated in the
new strain. This would suggest that these old antibodies
(that were originally directed against N9 neuraminidase)
would probably not bind to NA of the new strain. Nevertheless, using the same regions as epitope may be a viable
option for novel vaccine development.
Additionally, several other known antigenic regions, partially derived from surviving patients of previous flu outbreaks (e.g. H5N1), are reported in the literature [44-46]
and their location is indicated in the alignment (Figure 5).
Another extensive source of epitopes and antigens includ-

ing neuraminidase of influenza A viruses is the immune
epitope database (IEDB) [47] and the complete mapping
of epitopes for the new H1N1 NA sequence is available at
http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/H1N1/.
While several of the new mutations are found in antigenic
regions, it is also apparent that they often occur on positions that are hardly conserved among different NA subtypes. Consequently, these regions are evolutionarily
more flexible and may mutate fast. This increases the risk
of evading antibody responses of human hosts acquired
during previous flu infection or from vaccination.
Sequence variation among patients with the same 2009
H1N1 strain
After the first wave of new patient sequences arrived, it
becomes clear that there are at least two major lineages
that are distinguishable by only few mutations. Most
notably, N248 has mutated to Aspartate (D248) in the
New York infection cluster. All intra-strain mutations
available before May 8th 2009 are indicated in Figures 4B
and 5. As expected, they are predominantly found on the
surface and in regions that are known to be variable from
the conservation analysis. While the drug binding pocket
remains unaffected by these most recent mutations, the
N248D substitution changes a central part of an antibody
recognition site. This has important consequences for vaccine development, forcing to either avoid this epitope or
produce combined vaccines to account for the epitope

In summary, the analysis is careful and carried out in a commendable fashion, and the findings are highly significant.

Conclusion

Response
Indeed, there have been additional "2009 H1N1" neuraminidase sequences since the submission of this manuscript for review. Between April 29th and May 8th, 45 new
sequences became available. Overall, 3 mutations occur
in multiple (S95G, V106I and N248D) while 2 mutations
are restricted to single patient virus isolates (V83M,
V241I), so far. We have included a section about these
mutations identified in new patient sequences and
mapped them to the structure. As discussed in the main
text, the intra-strain variation is typically found on the surface and at positions expected to be variable as judged by
the conservation analysis among all NA subtypes. Interestingly, one of the mutations among patients (N248D) is
critically affecting one of the antibody binding sites.

In summary, we provide a sequence analysis and structural modelling of the neuraminidase from the 2009
H1N1 swine flu outbreak. Besides mapping of phylogenetic relationships to other strains, we find that the
sequence variation in the new strain does not seem to
affect the drug binding site but may very well alter common epitopes. To allow quick analysis of future mutations
that could produce drug or vaccine-resistant strains, we
provide a tool for 3D visualization of the neuraminidase
structure models with mapping of drug and antibody recognition sites on the supplementary webpage http://men

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1
Sandor Pongor, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy

In this work, the authors carry out a predictive analysis of the
"2009 H1N1" (swine or Mexican flu) influenza A virus strain,
based on phylogenetic analysis and 3D homology modelling.
The results show that this strain is phylogenetically more closely
related to European H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 avian flu
rather than to the H1N1 counterparts in the Americas.
Homology-modeling of the neuraminidase reveals that the
novel mutations are not likely to interfere with the active site so
the currently used neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) will be effective against the new virus
strain.
The subject is very timely and the approach is adequate. The
authors may want to include analysis of more patient data that
were published since the analysis was completed. More and more
sequences are being published from all over the world that might

As the virus will continue to evolve, new mutations will
become available and the best way we have found to
allow quick mapping and update of new sequence variation in respect to drug and antibody binding sites is to give
full access to users/readers via a 3D structure visualization
tool at the supplementary webpage http://mendel.bii.astar.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/H1N1/ (instructions to map
new mutations are given, including an example).

Maurer-Stroh et al discuss sequence features of the neuraminidase
gene of the virus behind the latest influenza outbreak, 2009
H1N1. Of the features of interest they note that this strain has
acquired a novel glycosylation consensus site that could be surface
accessible. Of course, it remains unknown if this site is indeed used
for modification. The key finding in the paper is that the binding
cavity for neuraminidase inhibitors is unaffected as suggested by
molecular modeling. This finding is of significance in the current
situation of an outbreak with pandemic potential. However, one
issue needs to be highlighted in this regard – mutations far away
from the binding site can potentially affect the shape and or binding affinity of the binding pocket. These are not always captured by
homology models, especially the issue of affinity. In principle,
authors could use a conservation patterns or co-evolution measures
(e.g. as in PMID: 10514373) to determine if there are interaction
chains that might connect distant residues to the active site. In the
least it would be useful to provide the caveat of distant changes
affecting affinity in the current paper.

cial circumstances and we have added a new paragraph to
the manuscript. However, we have to admit that it
remains essentially impossible to quantify the influence
of non-direct interactions by theoretical means unambiguously. In our experience, co-evolution measures such as
the one proposed and several others (PMID: 18056067)
produce high rates of false positives and, therefore, the
interpretation is difficult. We did the requested analysis
with Ranganathan's SCA algorithm to eventually identify
connected networks of residues using the webserver
implementation at the Gerstein lab, but no network that
would connect the surface directly to the core and catalytic
site was found (see supplementary webpage for full
details). In fact, all positions of the observed mutations
are at the surface and naturally variable, as judged by the
conservation and SCA analysis, which would rather indicate that they do not have an effect on the structure of the
more distant binding pocket. A possible problem why the
SCA could not work in this case is the high level of
sequence similarity among the neuraminidases which
only gives limited numbers of informative correlated
mutations. This is a totally different scenario from alignments of highly divergent sequences that still have the
same fold, such as the small PDZ domains analyzed by
Ranganathan. In the case of a diverse family with shared
fold, correlated mutations are indicative of allowed fluctuations also among structurally important residues.
However, with the neuraminidases, most variation can be
attributed to surface residues, which makes sense given
the pressure to avoid immune responses. Additionally,
sequence sampling of neuraminidases is not independent
but biased by transmission chains and clusters of outbreaks. A possible but also not necessarily more precise
alternative to judge indirect effects on drug binding would
be to run free energy simulations with the bound drug to
judge changes of affinity caused by the mutations but this
is a tricky and time-consuming endeavour that would
burst the scope of this current manuscript.

breaches in the species barrier between human and pigs have
already arisen out of closely related H1N1 strains as also evidenced

"These results support the notion that, also inside the family of

H1N1 or has it diverged from other avian like H1N1 with the
recombination occurring much earlier. Could this information
be superimposed in phylogenetic context on current figure 3?
Response
This is, of course, a very interesting question and difficult
to deduce from the phylogenetic tree of a single protein
without molecular clock, as in our case. However, this and
similar questions have already been analyzed to quite
some detail for the existing strains. The current knowledge
of the scenario for H1N1 is that around the late 1970s to
early 1980s, a human-avian reassortant virus started to be
detected in European pigs as host (PMID: 8091678).
Then, this avian-like swine flu started to move from the
European continent to the UK in the early 90s (PMID:
9049404). More reassortments and emergence of the N2
subtype that quickly spread is also well documented. This
phylogenetic analysis plugs the new H1N1 strain into the
already known clusterings among the NA subtypes and
within the N1 family.
