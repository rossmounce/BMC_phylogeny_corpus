Abstract
Background: Identifying functions for all gene products in all sequenced organisms is a central challenge of the
post-genomic era. However, at least 30-50% of the proteins encoded by any given genome are of unknown or
vaguely known function, and a large number are wrongly annotated. Many of these ‘unknown’ proteins are
common to prokaryotes and plants. We set out to predict and experimentally test the functions of such proteins.
Our approach to functional prediction integrates comparative genomics based mainly on microbial genomes with
functional genomic data from model microorganisms and post-genomic data from plants. This approach bridges
the gap between automated homology-based annotations and the classical gene discovery efforts of
experimentalists, and is more powerful than purely computational approaches to identifying gene-function
associations.
Results: Among Arabidopsis genes, we focused on those (2,325 in total) that (i) are unique or belong to families
with no more than three members, (ii) occur in prokaryotes, and (iii) have unknown or poorly known functions.
Computer-assisted selection of promising targets for deeper analysis was based on homology-independent
characteristics associated in the SEED database with the prokaryotic members of each family. In-depth comparative
genomic analysis was performed for 360 top candidate families. From this pool, 78 families were connected to
general areas of metabolism and, of these families, specific functional predictions were made for 41. Twenty-one
predicted functions have been experimentally tested or are currently under investigation by our group in at least
one prokaryotic organism (nine of them have been validated, four invalidated, and eight are in progress). Ten
additional predictions have been independently validated by other groups. Discovering the function of very
widespread but hitherto enigmatic proteins such as the YrdC or YgfZ families illustrates the power of our
approach.
Conclusions: Our approach correctly predicted functions for 19 uncharacterized protein families from plants and
prokaryotes; none of these functions had previously been correctly predicted by computational methods. The
resulting annotations could be propagated with confidence to over six thousand homologous proteins encoded in
over 900 bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic genomes currently available in public databases.

Background
Accurate characterization of as many genes as possible is a central challenge of the post-genomic era and
an essential precondition for progress in systems biology [1]. But this characterization is very far from
completion. By various estimates, at least 30-50% of
the genes of any given organism are of unknown
function [2], incorrectly annotated [3,4], or have only
a generic annotation such as ‘ATPase’ [5]. This problem is particularly acute for eukaryotic genomes,
which are in general less well annotated than prokaryotic ones [6,7].
Moreover, with more than 6,000 genomes now
(August 2010) in the pipeline, 1,354 of them eukaryotic
(http://www.genomesonline.org), the numbers of
unknown genes continue to increase [8] and annotation
errors continue to increase even faster [9]. For some
gene families up to 60% of the annotations are wrong
[9]. Without specific functional annotation efforts, present and future genome information will become ever
more corrupt and hard to analyze, and will thus be
greatly underexploited.
The first step in linking gene to function is to define
what constitutes a function, and this is not trivial. Full
definition of a protein’s function requires a combination
of two features or ‘dimensions’: (i) a molecular function
(e.g. an enzymatic activity) and (ii) a functional context
(e.g. a pathway) comprising other proteins involved in
the same process. Currently most annotations in public
archives convey only molecular functions, mainly
assigned by homology. However, when an enzymatic
activity has been annotated in this way, it may well be
wrong if other genes of the same pathway are not in the
genome [10]. To decide whether a protein has a truly
known function, it is therefore essential to take into
account both the molecular and functional context
dimensions. Most automated annotation platforms use
only the molecular function, but when metabolic reconstruction (i.e. pathway context) is included in the annotation process this greatly improves annotation quality
[11-13].
We and others have previously emphasized the power
of cross-kingdom comparative genomics approaches to
link gene and function [8,14]. This strategy was applied
in the work presented here to families of unknown function shared by Arabidopsis thaliana and prokaryotes.
Using the series of sieves summarized in Fig. 1, we combined comparative genomic and experimental validation
approaches to discover the function of ‘unknowns’.
Throughout this work, our primary comparative genomics platform was the SEED database and its tools [10];
the SEED is publicly available at http://www.theseed.
org/Papers/20101120/.

Results and discussion
Selecting candidate hypothetical genes families
conserved in plants and prokaryotes
Generation of the starting Arabidopsis gene set

The full set of 26,207 Arabidopsis genes was extracted
from the re-annotated genome [15]. To predict functions for ‘unknown’ genes conserved among prokaryotes
and plants, it is important to avoid large gene families
because their members often have different functions.
The Tribe [16] and TIGR [17] algorithms were therefore
used to filter out genes belonging to families having four
or more members in Arabidopsis, leaving 9,250 genes
corresponding to 6,034 gene families (Table 1; personal
communication, Dr. Brian Haas, The Institute for Genomic Research).
Selecting gene families conserved between plants and
prokaryotes

A second filter was applied to the 9,250 genes to retain
those whose products have prokaryotic homologs.
BLASTP [18] searches were performed in summer 2008
against the approximately 650 complete or almost complete microbial genomes then available in the SEED
database. The probability threshold (E value) of better
than 10-10 was imposed to ensure sufficient functional
conservation between amino acid sequences included in
the analysis [19,20]. Approximately one quarter of the
9,250 Arabidopsis genes tested were found to be similar
to at least one prokaryotic gene (2,325 total, Supplemental Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C). Prokaryotic homologs for
additional Arabidopsis genes would most probably be
detected were this comparison to be repeated with the
more numerous (~1,000) and more diverse microbial
genomes now available.
Selecting hypothetical Arabidopsis/prokaryotic gene families

Several strategies were combined to extract from the set
of 2,325 conserved Arabidopsis genes those whose functions are unknown or poorly known. The following
sources of evidence (available as of summer 2008) were
considered: (i) Arabidopsis gene annotations in the
TAIR database [21]; (ii) SEED annotations of prokaryotic orthologs of Arabidopsis genes; (iii) the list of Arabidopsis proteins of unknown function (PUFs) [22]
(http://bioweb.ucr.edu/scripts/unknownsDisplay.pl); and
(iv) publications in PubMed and TAIR databases (or the
absence thereof).
We relied mainly on the second of these sources, i.e.
SEED annotations of prokaryotic orthologs of the candidate Arabidopsis genes. The nontrivial task of establishing gene orthology is greatly aided in SEED by the
subsystem-based organization of annotations (described
in Methods; [10,23]). We considered Arabidopsis genes
to be ‘known’ and excluded them from further analysis
if they or any of their prokaryotic orthologs were

compile this list: (i) BLASTP searches against proteins of
known function in Swiss-Prot; (ii) Hidden Markov
Model-derived searches against the Pfam domain database; and (iii) retrieval of the ‘unknown’ annotations
from the Gene Ontology system [22]. Finally, to keep
abreast of discoveries of functions for Arabidopsis genes,
publications associated with selected Arabidopsis genes
were extracted from the TAIR database and PubMed
repeatedly during the course of this project.
This analysis yielded a set of 630 hypothetical Arabidopsis genes, corresponding to about 360 gene families
common to Arabidopsis and prokaryotes that were
highly enriched in those specifying proteins of unknown
function. This gene set was then prioritized for in-depth
in silico analysis as described below.
Prioritizing Arabidopsis/prokaryotic gene families for
detailed in silico analysis
General strategy

As the pool of 360 gene families was still too large for
the labor-intensive process of in-depth comparative
genomic analysis, we prioritized the candidates for
further analysis based on several characteristics associated with each protein-encoding gene in the SEED
database. The main such characteristic was the presence
of ‘functional coupling’ or ‘conserved gene clustering’
[24-27] for a prokaryotic member of the family, but
other criteria were also computed when available as
detailed below.
Detecting and analyzing gene clustering

Physical gene clustering is the tendency of functionally
associated genes to be located near each other on the
chromosome. Although not entirely absent in eukaryotes
[28], such clustering is far more marked in prokaryotes,
in which functionally related genes are often arranged in

operons [29] or divergently transcribed from the same
promoter region [24], or are simply neighbours or nearneighbours [24,30]. On average, ~35% of bacterial metabolic genes are in clusters [24]. A key point is that the
more taxonomically diverse the genomes in which a
cluster occurs, the more informative the cluster becomes
[30]. A single gene family can be involved in different
clusters in different taxa (all potentially diagnostic of its
function), even if it is not clustered with informative
genes in all taxa.
Several software tools in SEED that take advantage of
gene clustering were used to select promising candidates, as well as to link unknown gene families to general metabolic pathways and to generate specific
functional predictions during the next phase of the
project:
(i) Strength of ‘functional coupling’ (FC) – measures
the number of distantly related organisms (with 95%
overall DNA sequence identity or less) in which two
genes are located in each other’s vicinity. Close strains
are not taken into account in this parameter, for example: all sequenced Escherichia coli genomes in SEED in
which two particular genes are co-localized on the chromosome are counted as one when computing FC (see
ref. [24] for a more formal treatment of this topic).
(ii) Length of cluster – reflects the number of genes
involved in a specific cluster.
(iii) Evidence code ‘in cluster with non-hypothetical’
(cwn) – indicates that a gene family is functionally
coupled to (tends to co-localize with) at least one other
gene family that has been assigned a function that is
considered ‘non-hypothetical’. The functional coupling
score must be five or more for this code to apply.
(iv) Evidence code ‘in cluster with hypothetical’ (cwh)
– as above, except it labels gene families that tend to

Gerdes et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S1/S2

co-localize with at least one other hypothetical gene
family;
(v) Association of a gene family with a ‘clustering
based’ subsystem in SEED (CBSS). These subsystems
group hypothetical protein families solely on the
grounds of co-localization patterns conserved across
multiple genomes; however, manual subsystem encoding
takes automatically pre-computed leads (such as evidence codes) to the next level. For example, comprehensive phyletic spread is determined for protein families
that might have been labeled as ‘in cluster with hypothetical’ in merely a fraction of genomes. CBSS subsystems
provided a useful starting point for the next phase of in
silico analysis.
Other filtering factors

Other factors that were considered included:
(i) Phyletic spread – the number of distinct microbial
species that harbored members of each hypothetical
family under consideration, whether or not they were
functionally coupled (see above). Widely distributed
families were preferred over narrowly distributed ones.
(ii) Whether or not well studied model organisms
such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cyanobacteria, or yeast contained a member of the
gene family in question, indicating likely availability of
functional genomics data (e.g. expression arrays, gene
essentiality data, protein interaction datasets) that could
provide clues linking candidate families to general metabolic areas and aid specific functional predictions.
Comprehensive tables summarizing all types of association evidence (available as Additional Files 1 and 2)
were used for manual sorting and evaluation to prioritize hypothetical plant/prokaryote gene families and to
select candidates for further detailed in silico analysis.

data in subsystems allows accurate extrapolation of
functional associations between genes detected in microbial genomes onto other prokaryotes and even eukaryotes (e.g. Arabidopsis), albeit with caution. For
example, in our study the degree of similarity between
an Arabidopsis gene and its nearest prokaryotic homolog involved in gene clustering played an important role
in evaluating the validity of such cross-kingdom projections. Additional ‘checks and balances’ were used in projecting functional leads and hypotheses developed via
comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomes back to
plant genes, which might not have preserved the function
of their prokaryotic counterparts. For example, when
linking unknown gene families to general metabolic
areas, or to individual protein families via gene clustering,
the validity of such associations in the context of plant
physiology and biochemistry was considered, as well as
its correspondence to Arabidopsis expression array data
[31-33], protein localization [34,35], mutant phenotypes,
and other functional genomics data (as illustrated in the
case studies below). This first analysis yielded a list of 78
gene families linked to diverse metabolic areas (Additional file 2), including fatty acids, terpenes, vitamins,
aromatic compounds, and sulfur, as well as iron-sulfur
cluster assembly, oxidative damage protection, glutathione S-transferase-dependent detoxification, DNA
repair, plastid/cell division, signalling systems, and metal
homoeostasis. However, a clear bias reflecting the investigators’ areas of expertise was observed, with some ten in
vitamin/cofactor metabolism and another fourteen in
tRNA/RNA modifications. This emphasizes the value of
combining multiple types of expertise to accurately predict and validate gene function.

Linking unknown gene families to general metabolic
areas

Predicting and testing precise molecular and biological
functions
General strategy

Our first goal was to link the prioritized gene families to
a particular metabolic or functional area. For this, we
built on the gene clustering associations captured as
described above, using these to construct a corresponding experimental subsystem in the SEED database for
each family (see Methods). Each such subsystem
included all members of the focus gene family across all
genomes available in the database, as well as gene
families potentially associated with it (as implicated by
gene clustering in at least a fraction of prokaryote genomes). Such integration of biological functions with genome sequences provided by subsystems allowed us to
discard or strengthen the clustering associations and to
evaluate the phylogenetic co-distribution between the
gene family of interest and the associated families. We
then further explored the associations by extending the
analysis to Arabidopsis. Indeed, organization of genomic

The next step in the pipeline was creating a functional
hypothesis that could be tested by genetic and/or biochemical experiments. This is by far the most labor
intensive and intellectually challenging step in the pipeline. Multiple types of data need to be queried and integrated with biochemical insights in order to make
reasonable and testable predictions. Clues can come
from high-throughput data (protein complexes, phenotypes, microarrays) from any organism, from the literature (where data may be buried in supplemental tables
and contain no reference to the gene family), or from
analysis of the structure of a member of the family (e.g.
from a structural genomics effort). Biochemical insight
can come from cataloguing globally or locally missing
genes, i.e. those that encode enzymes for which a gene
has never been identified in any species or is absent in
certain species [36-38].

Gerdes et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S1/S2

An example of globally missing gene identified in this
work is the Sua5/YrdC family involved in the universal
carbamoylthreonyladenosine (t6A) modification in tRNA
(case number 5 in Table 2 and summarized below). An
example of a locally missing gene is the PTPS-III family
(case number 4 in Table 2) that replaces the folate biosynthesis enzyme FolB in many bacteria and certain
eukaryotes [39,40]. Biochemical insights can also come
from noting the presence of two gene families annotated
as fulfilling the same role, suggesting a possible duplication followed by functional divergence [41]. One such
example is the COG0354 family, previously annotated in
many genomes as the folate-dependent glycine cleavage
system T protein (GcvT), but in reality a protein
involved in the repair of iron-sulfur clusters (case number 1 in Table 2 and summarized below). For some
families very precise functions could be predicted, e.g.
methylation of a specific position in ribosomal RNA
(At4g28830, case number 31 in Table 3) whereas for
others the prediction remained more general but testable nonetheless. For instance, we were able to link certain members of the COG0523 family (case number 7 in
table 2) to zinc homeostasis [42] and this general prediction was borne out by demonstrating that some
members of the family have a role in survival in low
zinc conditions ([43] and C. Blaby-Haas and V. de
Crécy-Lagard, unpublished results). We were able to
make testable functional predictions for 41 families
(Additional file 2); the rationales for these predictions
are summarized in the subsystem notes for each family
in the SEED database. Table 2 lists the 19 families for
which the prediction has been experimentally confirmed
by us or others. Table 3 lists four families that were
experimentally invalidated and another eight for which
experiments are well advanced, for a total of 31 families.
Three illustrative examples of validated predictions are
described briefly below. The first and second of these
are fully described elsewhere [44,45].
COG0354 (At4g12130, At1g60990)

Bacterial genes encoding COG0354 (case number 1 in
Table 2), the GcvT paralog noted above, often cluster
with diverse iron/sulfur (Fe/S) proteins (shown in red in
Fig. 2A), and proteomic data [46,47] show induction by
oxidative stress and confirm an Fe/S association. Moreover, the COG0354 protein is required for full activity
of certain Fe/S enzymes in E. coli[48] and yeast [49].
We therefore predicted that COG0354 is a folate-dependent enzyme (based on its homology to the folatedependent protein GcvT) involved in assembly or repair
of Fe/S proteins, particularly under oxidative stress.
Consistent with this prediction, deleting the gene encoding COG0354 in E. coli (ygfZ) increased oxidative stress
sensitivity, and the stress-sensitive phenotype was complemented by expressing a plant COG0354 protein (Fig.

Page 6 of 16

2B). Folate-dependence was established by using NMR
to demonstrate stereoselective folate binding by recombinant E. coli COG0354, and by showing that in vivo
activity of the E. coli Fe/S protein MiaB is as seriously
impaired by deleting the folate synthesis gene folE
(which eliminates folates) as by deleting ygfZ, i.e. removing folates had the same impact as removing COG0354
[44].
COG3643 (At2g20830)

The histidine utilization (Hut) pathway occurs in certain
bacteria and animals, but not plants. The Hut pathway
up to the intermediate N-formiminoglutamate is invariant, but thereafter there are three routes to the endproduct glutamate, one of which involves a formiminotransferase, COG3643 (Fig. 3A). Comparative genomics
analysis showed that bacteria that have a formiminotransferase-type Hut pathway generally lack the ygfA
gene encoding 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase, the
key enzyme required to recycle 5-formyltetrahydrofolate,
which inhibits various folate-dependent enzymes and is
formed by a side reaction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase in the presence of glycine (Fig. 3B). This striking
observation led us to predict that formiminotransferase
or formiminotransferase paralogs can replace YgfA. This
prediction fits with classical biochemical data showing
that mammalian formiminotransferase can mediate formyl transfer from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to glutamate,
albeit at a low rate [50,51]. The prediction was supported by showing that various prokaryotic COG3643
genes (highlighted in Fig. 3B) complement the growth
phenotype of an E. coli ygfA deletion mutant (which
cannot use glycine as sole nitrogen source, presumably
because 5-formyltetrahydrofolate accumulation inhibits
the folate-dependent glycine cleavage reaction). Representative data for the Acidobacterium COG3643 gene
are shown in Fig. 3C. Folate analysis of the ygfA deletant
with and without complementing COG3643 genes confirmed that the deletant accumulated 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and that COG3643 genes reversed this
accumulation [45]. Furthermore, characterization of
recombinant COG3643 proteins showed their kinetic
characteristics to be consistent with an in vivo role in 5formyltetrahydrofolate recycling [45]; this biochemical
corroboration is important since functions carried out
by ectopically overexpressed genes do not necessarily
reflect their native function. Taken together, this evidence suggests that COG3643 paralogs in plants may
likewise replace YgfA. Consistent with this possibility,
the ygfA knockout in Arabidopsis has a mild phenotype,
pointing to the existence of an alternative route for disposal of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate [52].

analogous to the one expected for a t6A enzyme [59].
The COG0009 family can be further split based on
sequence comparison into three subfamilies: YrdC, Sua5
(YrdC with an extra domain termed Sua5), and YciO.
One or two members of this family are present in each
genome; for example, the Arabidopsis and E. coli genomes contain two, YrdC (At5g60590) and YciO
(At3g01920), while the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome
contains only one, Sua5 [60]. We showed that (i) tRNAs
from S. cerevisiae strains lacking sua5 do not contain
t6A and that this phenotype is complemented by transforming with a plasmid encoding the wild type gene
(Fig. 4A); (ii) the homologs from B. subtilis, M. maripaludis, E. coli yrdC, but not E. coli yciO also complement
the phenotype; (iii) the yrdC homolog is essential in

E. coli, whereas yciO is not; (iv) S. cerevisiae, B. subtilis,
M. maripaludis yrdC genes but not E. coli yciO are
able to complement the lethality phenotype of yrdC in
E coli (Fig. 4B); and (v) E. coli yrdC is able to bind t6A
apomodified tRNA Thr but not unmodified transcript
[60]. Therefore, members of the YrdC/Sua5 family
are involved in t 6 A biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis,
At5g60590 and At3g01920 are annotated as related to
the YrdC family. However, based on comparative
sequence analysis combined with genetic orthologous
complementation tests these can be distinguished. As
depicted in Fig. 4C, the YrdC family is characterized
by the KxR/G …SxN signature sequence; At5g60590 is
therefore most probably part of the YrdC family while
At3g01920 is not.

Propagating validated and predicted gene functions to
other organisms

Subsystem-based organization of genomic data in SEED
implies delineation and maintenance of isofunctional
gene groups [61]. This strategy greatly facilitates not only
the development of functional predictions for uncharacterized genes, but also accurate projection of this knowledge, once verified, to other species. For example,
annotations for the 19 families developed in the course of
this study and experimentally confirmed by us or others
have been propagated to a total of 6,297 genes in some
900 complete or nearly complete bacterial, archaeal, and
eukaryotic genomes currently available in the SEED database (Table 2). Furthermore, we believe there is merit in
accurate and exhaustive propagation of yet untested predictions to all orthologs in all available genomes, early in
the process of in silico analysis. This allows complete and
accurate cataloguing of functional homologs for each
gene family under study, thus revealing its phyletic
spread, co-occurrence with known gene families, potential associations with specific features of an environmental niche – all of which can serve as additional clues for
developing specific functional hypotheses. For this reason
we have built subsystems in the public SEED database for
78 families (Additional file 2) so that readers can produce
and test their own predictions for gene families that fall
in their area of expertise. The total number of annotated
genes in these families exceeds 22,000.
Comparing results to those from automated functional
prediction platforms

Several recently developed platforms seek to automatically integrate comparative genomics, high-throughput
experimental data, and literature reports to make gene
function predictions [46,62]. For ten gene families that
were predicted and validated, we analyzed the accuracy
of the corresponding predictions from the two most
relevant predictions platforms, eNet (E. coli) [46] and
AraNet (Arabidopsis) [62] (Table 4). The predictions
from these automated platforms were mostly wrong. At
best, they produced a general annotation that was in the
right functional area such as ‘folate dependent regulatory protein’ by eNet and ‘iron-sulfur assembly protein’
by AraNet for the COG0354 family. However, both of
these came straight from the literature, not from associations, and can thus hardly be called predictions;
furthermore, these two correct ‘predictions’ were buried
in long lists of incorrect ones. Thus, whenever a prediction was possible, the automated platforms failed to
make a correct and precise one.

Conclusions
The analysis presented here shows that combining comparative genomics with expert intellectual input enabled

Page 11 of 16

correct functional annotation of 19 gene families by
only a few researchers, in a short time (three years), and
at a moderate cost (<$1M). This number of successful
functional predictions is roughly comparable to the
number made through the entire structural genomics
effort [63], involving many more people, a much longer
period, and far greater expense. The cost-effectiveness
of our approach is thus perhaps its most striking
feature.
Our analysis also underscores the imperative of combining molecular function and biological context to
annotate function as shown in the COG3643 example.
Homology and even in vitro assays would have labeled
this family – correctly, but incompletely and misleadingly – as a formiminotransferase. Only by interpreting
phylogenetic distribution data with biochemical insight
and then applying complementation tests was this family
correctly annotated as an alternative to 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase to metabolize 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. It is noteworthy that in this and most of our other
successful predictions, there is a strong bias towards the
authors’ areas of expertise – from which the obvious
inference is that other experts would, equally easily,
have been able to predict additional sets of functions.
For this reason we have built subsystems in the public
SEED database for 78 families and made available the
raw comparative genomic data for all gene families
shared between Arabidopsis and prokaryotes (Additional
file 1A, 1B, and 1C) so that other experts can bring
their insight to our analysis in order to make and test
their own predictions.
Finally, the only plant genomes available when this
effort started were Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar, and
rich post-genomic resources were available only for Arabidopsis. We accordingly focused our work on gene
families common to Arabidopsis and prokaryotes. However, now that other plant genomes are pouring in
(some 20 are available already and many more are in
the pipeline) it is clear that almost all of the families we
investigated have orthologs in other plants, making our
work of immediate value in annotating other plant genomes. Furthermore, the rapid growth of microarray
databases and other post-genomic resources for plants
besides Arabidopsis (e.g. [64-66]) is providing many
sources of association evidence to reinforce the
approach that we have pioneered here.

proposed functional predictions developed in the course
of this study for 78 genes families analysed in this study.
The SEED organizes genomic data in the form of
subsystems (typically metabolic pathways or structural
complexes) covering all organisms rather than on an
organism-by-organism basis. Subsystems are developed
and maintained by experts to capture the current status of knowledge of specific biological processes in
model, well characterized organisms and to project this
knowledge to other species via comparative genomics
and metabolic reconstruction techniques [10]. Each
subsystem includes a set of functionally related protein
families (jointly encoding a specific pathway, process,
or structural complex) across all available genomes
(874 bacterial, 58 archaeal, and 29 eukaryotic complete
and nearly complete genomic sequences as of July
2010). In SEED large homology-based protein families
are broken into isofunctional subfamilies (‘functional
roles’) based on genome context, functional context,
phyletic profiling, shared regulatory sites, and other
homology-independent clues. Association of each functional role with the corresponding subsystem(s) provides rich two-dimensional functional/phylogenetic
context for each subfamily, leading to far more accurate annotations than the usual approach of annotating
the genes within a single organism. Furthermore, the
subsystem spreadsheet is used in SEED as a framework
for integration of various types of functional data organized as gene attributes (e.g. gene clustering on a chromosome, expression array data, gene essentiality, etc.)
and organism attributes (oxygen requirement, motility,
pathogenicity, etc), which provide valuable non-homology based clues for functional predictions for uncharacterized genes.
All Subsystems created in this study, as well as over
1300 resident subsystems in SEED encoding all aspects
of microbial physiology and metabolism are available on
the public SEED server at http://theseed.uchicago.edu/
FIG/SubsysEditor.cgi. They are regularly updated to
accommodate newly sequenced bacterial genomes as
well as novel experimental data and other relevant data
as they become available.
Phylogenetic occurrence profiles were analysed using
the Signature Genes tool on the NMPDR server (http://
www.nmpdr.org/FIG/wiki/view.cgi/FIG/SigGenes). This
tool identifies gene families that are common to a
selected group of genomes, or those that differentiate
one group of genomes from another. Annotations for
paralog families were made using physical clustering
when possible or by building phylogenetic trees using
the ClustalW tool [67,68] integrated in SEED or deriving
specific motifs.
We also used the bioinformatic tools and resources at
NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and KEGG (http://
