Abstract
Background: Thousands of plants and animals possess pharmacological properties and there is an increased interest
in using these materials for therapy and health maintenance. Efficacies of the application is critically dependent on the
use of genuine materials. For time to time, life-threatening poisoning is found because toxic adulterant or substitute is
administered. DNA barcoding provides a definitive means of authentication and for conducting molecular systematics
studies. Owing to the reduced cost in DNA authentication, the volume of the DNA barcodes produced for medicinal
materials is on the rise and necessitates the development of an integrated DNA database.
Description: We have developed an integrated DNA barcode multimedia information platform- Medicinal Materials
DNA Barcode Database (MMDBD) for data retrieval and similarity search. MMDBD contains over 1000 species of
medicinal materials listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and American Herbal Pharmacopoeia. MMDBD also contains
useful information of the medicinal material, including resources, adulterant information, medical parts, photographs,
primers used for obtaining the barcodes and key references. MMDBD can be accessed at http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/icm/
mmdbd.htm.
Conclusions: This work provides a centralized medicinal materials DNA barcode database and bioinformatics tools for
data storage, analysis and exchange for promoting the identification of medicinal materials. MMDBD has the largest
collection of DNA barcodes of medicinal materials and is a useful resource for researchers in conservation, systematic
study, forensic and herbal industry.
Background
Herbal medicine is the ancient form of pharmaceutics,
which is still used by many cultures for curing diseases.
With a trend of living in harmony with Nature, the use of
herbal materials for treatment and health maintenance is
on the rise. At present, many plant, fungal and animal
species are being used for treating diseases and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia has listed 670 commonly used species [1]. Herbal medicine is a useful source of bioactive
compounds, such as oils obtained from the evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) for treating atopic dermatitis
[2], and hyperforin extracted from St. John's Wort

(Hypericum perforatum) as an antidepressant drug [3].
Nevertheless, their efficacy is critically dependent on the
use of the correct material. If toxic adulterants or substitutes are administered, life-threatening poisoning may
occur. In 2002, 63 people were reported with symptoms
of general malaise, nausea and vomiting after consumption of herbal tea which was inadvertently mixed with
neurotoxic Japanese star anise (Illicium anisatum) [4].
Adulteration resulting in an epidemic of severe kidney
damages caused by aristolochic acid was first reported in
Belgium in 1993 [5], followed by Hong Kong and Korea
[6,7] in 2004. In these cases, the concerned herbs were
substituted with the nephrotoxic Aristolochia species. A
case of misusing Datura metel as Rhododendron molle
was reported in Singapore in 2008 [8]. These two species
share the same Chinese herb name "Naoyanghua", but D.
metel contains anticholinergic compound that causes
confusion, dilated pupils, and absence of sweating. Tradi-

tionally, medicinal materials are identified by their organoleptic characteristics and physical properties such as
shape, color, texture, and odor. However, the differences
among related species or processed products are sometimes not obvious. Unique chemicals may serve as important markers for authentication, but chemical markers or
profiles may be affected by the physiological and storage
conditions.
With the advancement of molecular technology, DNA
markers have now become a convenient means for species identification and molecular systematic study [9-11]
and many DNA markers have in fact been patented for
further development [12]. With the help of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), specific DNA regions can be amplified from only a small amount of samples. An unequivocal identification of a tested sample can be reached by
comparing its DNA sequences against the sequence of an
authentic sample. To develop a universal identification
platform, The Consortium for the Barcode of Life
(CBOL) proposed to set up a standardized sampling
method and experimental protocol to analyze agreedupon 'DNA barcodes' [13].
DNA barcode is a short DNA sequence of an organism,
which can be used to distinguish the organism from the
other species. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) is chosen as the standard for all groups of
higher animals [14,15]. For plant species, COI is not a
suitable barcode because it evolves much slower than that
of animals. Plant researchers examined several coding
and non-coding regions, but they soon realized that a single DNA locus has limited resolving power for closely
related species [16,17]. Although more laborious than the
single-locus approach, it is generally agree to combine
two or more barcodes to increase the successful rate
[18,19]. Recently, members of the CBOL plant working
group evaluated seven chloroplast genes and proposed to
use matK and rbcL as plant barcodes, based on the following criteria: easy to be amplified with a single primer
pair, amenable to bidirectional sequencing with little
manual editing, and high resolving power in species discrimination [20]. rbcL offers high universality and good
discriminating power, whereas matK offers higher resolution. Nevertheless, the differentiation power of these two
markers may not be high in closely related plant species
[21]. Also, experiences from our group and other
researchers showed that chloroplast genes including
trnH-psbA spacer, trnL-F, and nuclear regions such as
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 5S rRNA intergenic
spacer are also useful for the authentication purpose [2224].
The Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) is an online
informatics workbench for the management, analysis and
use of DNA barcodes [25], which is managed by the
Canadian Center for DNA Barcoding, University of
Guelph. Basically, this system utilizes COI and internal

Page 2 of 8

transcribed spacer (ITS) for animal and fungal identification, respectively. For plant species identification, 2-locus
combination of matK and rbcL are the default barcodes.
The system also allows identification of unknown
sequences up to species level provided by users.
Besides BOLD, some web-based barcode databases
have been constructed to serve specific groups of organism. UNITE is an rDNA sequence database which contains 2842 ITS sequences from 1105 species of 152 genera
of ectomycorrhizal fungi [26]. The main target of UNITE
is to facilitate the identification of environmental samples
of fungal DNA. In addition to similarity searches, UNITE
has built-in maximum parsimony heuristic and neighbor
joining phylogenetic tools for online analysis. All Leps
Barcode of Life is a database for the identification and
discovery of Lepidoptera. This database now has 448,054
barcodes from 40,907 species [27]. As insect has different
morphological characters throughout its lifecycle, the
DNA barcodes provide an accurate tool for the identification of the species. The Fish barcode of Life Initiative
(FISH-BOL) addresses identification and natural history
of various fish species through the use of COI sequence
[28]. This database contains DNA barcodes, images and
geospatial coordinates of examined specimens. For plant
species, Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) is an integrated web-based relational database contains genetic
markers and ESTs of the Rosaceae [29,30].
DNA barcodes are gaining popularity for authenticating medicinal materials [31-35]. Along with this trend,
the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoiea has
included protocols for DNA extraction and DNA barcodes for selected medicinal materials. As a timely action,
we set forth to establish the Medicinal Materials DNA
Barcode Database (MMDBD) for recording the DNA barcode sequences, basic information and the key references
of medicinal materials. The aims of the this database are:
(1) to develop an organized and integrated web resource
for DNA barcodes for medicinal species identification,
(2) to collect and integrate the basic information of
medicinal materials and their DNA barcodes, (3) to
develop online tools and resources for sequence comparison. In this paper, we describe the structure and content
of the database and reveal the database access utility and
tools.

Construction and content
Medicinal materials information

Medicinal species listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China [1], American Herbal Pharmacopoeia [36], and from prescriptions of folk medicine were
chosen for including in the database. Substitutes, adulterants and closely related species were also included in the
database for comparison. Currently, there are total 1259
species with 18,436 sequences available in this database.
The scientific names, medicinal name, general informa-

tion, and the classification of the materials in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) [37] were collected. The voucher number of the
samples, primer sequences and PCR conditions for generating barcode sequences are also provided as additional
information. Photographs of live specimen or dried medical part of the medicinal materials were captured digitally. Live specimen images were mostly taken at the
Chinese herbal garden of The Chinese University of
Hong Kong (CUHK). Dried medicinal materials were
provided by the Chinese Medicine Museum of the Institute of Chinese Medicine, CUHK. All images are of high
resolution with 1200 × 800 pixels.

Sequence information

vant sequences such as microsatellite or mRNA
sequences were excluded. To keep genes without standardized names, such as 'ITS', 'ITS1', 'ITS-1' or 'ITS-2' for
ITS region, multiple alternative keywords were used to
keep these genes in our dataset. Then all the extracted
data were imported into the MYSQL database.

Medicinal materials include plant, animal, insect and fungal species. Considering the large number of species in
the world, it is widely believed that a single set of barcodes should be adopted. Since CBOL has already chosen
several DNA sequences as barcodes, undoubtedly,
researchers will focus on these standard DNA regions in
the future. Our primary goal is to include these DNA barcodes of medicinal materials in the MMDBD. On the
other hand, many studies point out that other DNA
regions are useful in species identification, and combining with the standard barcodes will increase the accuracy
for differentiating closely related species. We therefore
also include these "supplementary barcodes" in the
MMDBD for reference. COI has been proposed as the
barcode for higher animals in CBOL and BOLD [13,25].
Other mitochondrial regions, such as cytochrome b, 12S
rRNA and 16S rRNA, are also proven to be useful in animal and insect species identification [38-41]. Consequently, all mitochondrial DNA sequences were included
for medicinal materials originated from high animals and
insects. ITS sequences have high differentiation power
for the identification of fungal species [42,43], and
accordingly we have selected this region for the fungal
medicine. For plant materials, in addition to chloroplast
DNA, nuclear DNA including ITS and 5S rRNA intergenic spacer are able to discriminate closely related plant
species [23,44,45]. Also, combining two or more DNA
regions may be necessary for some species. Hence, all
available chloroplast DNA sequences and two nuclear
gene spacers ITS and 5S rRNA intergenic spacer are
included in the database. MMDBD therefore consists of
barcodes proposed by CBOL and other useful DNA
regions for identification of medicinal materials (Table 1).

DNA sequences generated by our groups

Our group has generated 531 DNA for 189 medicinal
materials, including ITS, 5S rRNA intergenic spacer,
chloroplast trnL, trnL-F and mitochondrial cytochrome b
regions. Samples and specimen were collected from various localities and authenticated by experts in pharmacognosy. Total DNA was extracted and selected DNA regions
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
universal primers [46]. The PCR products were
sequenced directly or in case of unresolved sequences,
the products were first cloned and sequenced. Primer
flanking sites on the determined DNA sequences were
removed.
Software design and implementation

MMDBD was implemented on the relational database
system MYSQL (version 5.0.45). NCBI BLAST (Basic
Local Search Alignment Tool, v2.2.17) [47] was used as
similarity search engine. Perl DBI module was employed
to connect MYSQL, submit queries and obtain results.
The MMDBD also uses the AJAX (asynchronous
JavaScript and XML) technique which provides a rich and
smooth user interface. Requests were posted to serverside PHP scripts and response was converted into JSON
(Javascripts Object Notation) format for data interchange.
MMDBD consists of three tables which store general
information, DNA sequences and references of the chosen medicinal materials (Table 2). Table "Medicinal material information" stores taxonomic, medicinal and
morphological information. Field "CITESApp" records
the status of endangered medicinal species in the CITES.
Another field "ParmacopeiaInfor" is employed to identify
all pharmacopoeia listed species in MMDBD. Table "Barcode sequence" is a sequence factory, which contains

Utility and discussion
Database access and tools

MMDBD provides a simple web-based interface to
retrieve barcode information (Fig. 1). The URL is: http://
www.cuhk.edu.hk/icm/mmdbd.htm.
MMDBD has three major functions: database query by
text-based interface, sequence similarity search, and data
submission. Researchers can enrich the database by contributing their DNA barcode sequences to MMDBD. For
data submission, we have provided a template file in
EXCEL format, which enables users to upload batches of
sequences and information via email. The administrator
will then check the data quality before incorporating
them to the database.
Database search interface
Search view

There are two search methods: keywords search and Chinese character stroke number search (Fig. 2). In the former, user can enter a single word or phrase to search the
herb name, species name, family name and references of
the medicinal materials. The keywords are passed to
server in UTF-8 encoding which supports both simplified

Page 5 of 8

and traditional Chinese characters. Another search
method is by means of stroke number of Chinese species
name. Stroke number table was created according to the
stroke number of the first Chinese character of the species name. User can get the desired information of medicinal materials by following the hyperlinks in the table.
Sequence similarity search

MMDBD utilizes BLASTN algorithm for sequence similarity search. This function allows users to conduct
homology searches between their sequences of interest
and the data in the database (Fig. 3). The input sequence
should be in raw sequence format and the length must be
between 10 and 2000 bases. The word size in BLASTN is
preset to 7 in order to improve algorithm search sensitivity for short sequence. User is also able to adjust the Evalue to further optimize the searching results. The
BLAST output page displays the sequence homology in a
rich interface in which user can go to the details page of
the target barcode sequence by clicking the color bar
links.
Future development

The database has already covered 66.5% and 84.5% of the
medicinal materials listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia

and the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, respectively. It
provides an open forum for further addition of medicinal
materials barcodes. In addition, efforts will focus on
improving the tools and functionality of the web interface
such as an advanced search site with options for search or
display categories.

Conclusions
The MMDBD is initiated to support the DNA barcoding
initiative, which includes numerous important medicinal
materials. MMDBD contains DNA barcode sequences,
basic information and references of the medicinal materials. The integrated database provides users with easy
access and retrieval of the data and web tools for
sequence comparison. MMDBD will play a timely and
important role for the authentication and quality control
of medicinal materials and benefit the herbal industry. It
will also be useful to investigators for conservation,
forensic and systematic analysis.
