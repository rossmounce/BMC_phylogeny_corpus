Abstract
Background: Coffea canephora, also called Robusta, belongs to the Rubiaceae, the fourth largest angiosperm family. This diploid
species (2x = 2n = 22) has a fairly small genome size of ≈ 690 Mb and despite its extreme economic importance, particularly for
developing countries, knowledge on the genome composition, structure and evolution remain very limited. Here, we report the
160 kb of the first C. canephora Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clone ever sequenced and its fine analysis.
Results: This clone contains the CcEIN4 gene, encoding an ethylene receptor, and twenty other predicted genes showing a high
gene density of one gene per 7.8 kb. Most of them display perfect matches with C. canephora expressed sequence tags or show
transcriptional activities through PCR amplifications on cDNA libraries. Twenty-three transposable elements, mainly Class II
transposon derivatives, were identified at this locus. Most of these Class II elements are Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable
Elements (MITE) known to be closely associated with plant genes. This BAC composition gives a pattern similar to those found
in gene rich regions of Solanum lycopersicum and Medicago truncatula genomes indicating that the CcEIN4 regions may belong to
a gene rich region in the C. canephora genome. Comparative sequence analysis indicated an extensive conservation between C.
canephora and most of the reference dicotyledonous genomes studied in this work, such as tomato (S. lycopersicum), grapevine
(V. vinifera), barrel medic M. truncatula, black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. The higher degree of
microcollinearity was found between C. canephora and V. vinifera, which belong respectively to the Asterids and Rosids, two
clades that diverged more than 114 million years ago.
Conclusion: This study provides a first glimpse of C. canephora genome composition and evolution. Our data revealed a
remarkable conservation of the microcollinearity between C. canephora and V. vinifera and a high conservation with other distant
dicotyledonous reference genomes. Altogether, these results provide valuable information to identify candidate genes in C.
canephora genome and serve as a foundation to establish strategies for whole genome sequencing. Future large-scale sequence
comparison between C. canephora and reference sequenced genomes will help in understanding the evolutionary history of
dicotyledonous plants.

Background
Twenty years ago, the availability of several plant genetic
maps allowed the development of the first comparative
genetic mapping studies [1]. Results indicated that the
marker content and order were globally conserved within
plant families, between species that sometimes display
huge differences in genome size and organization. Thus,
macrosynteny was established within the Brassicaceae, the
Fabaceae, the Solanaceae and the Poaceae families [2]. In
Poaceae, the spectacular conservation of macrosynteny
gave the opportunity to draw a consensus map for seven
different grass genomes that diverged more than 50 million years ago [3]. In contrast to within family comparative mapping, macrosynteny appears less conserved
between distantly related species belonging to distant
families or different clades [4,5]. With such a comparison,
the overall conservation of the genome organization
appears scrambled by mechanisms of genome evolution
such as chromosome rearrangements and genome duplications, to such an extent that the synteny was frequently
limited over small genetic intervals. Recently, the increase
of complete or partial genomic sequence of reference
plant species from different families and the development
of the BAC clones sequencing in experimental species
gave the opportunity to perform direct comparisons at the
genomic sequence level. Beside intra-family comparisons,
microcollinearity was investigated between Arabidopsis
and tomato [6,7], Arabidopsis, tomato and Capsella [8],
Arabidopsis, M. truncatula, P. trichocarpa and Lotus japonicus [5] and Arabidopsis, Medicago, Populus and Cucumis
melo [9]. Despite a lack of macrosynteny, a significant
microcollinearity was established between these phylogenetically distant species. In addition, direct sequences
comparisons allowed the detection of a complex network
of microcollinearity between Arabidospis and tomato [7]
and between Arabidospsis, Medicago and Populus [5]
suggesting the presence of ancient segmental duplication
in the Arabidopsis genome. Altogether, these analyses
provided new insight into the plant genome structure and
evolution.
The Rubiaceae family (Euasterids I clade) is one of the largest angiosperm families, comprising about 600 genus and
more than 13,000 species and including the Gardenia, the
Cinchona and the Coffea genus. The genus Coffea comprises two economically important crop species: C. arabica
L. and C. canephora Pierre that account respectively for
65% and 35% of the worldwide coffee production (International Coffee Organization, http://www.ico.org). C.
canephora represents a model genome in the Rubiaceae
family as it has a diploid genome (2n = 2x = 22), a relatively small genome size (2C = 1.43 pg) [10] compared to
the allotetraploid genome of C. arabica and an extensive
genetic diversity [11]. Moreover, genomic resources have
been recently established for C. canephora, such as a BAC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/22

library [12] and the availability of 55,840 C. canephora
ESTs from different tissues and stages of seed development [13] to facilitate the isolation and the characterization of genes with agronomic interest. However, despite
its agronomical importance, very little information concerning the composition, the structure and the evolution
of the C. canephora genome is now available. Particularly,
it remains unclear so far how the distantly related
sequenced dicotyledonous reference genomes such as
Arabidopsis, Medicago, Populus, grapevine and tomato
will have a predictive value to study the genome structure
and to isolate genes of interest in C. canephora. Recently,
in an effort to identify factors implicated in ethylene perception during the ripening of the C. canephora berries,
several ethylene receptors and transcription factors genes
were isolated [14-16]. One of them called CcEIN4 was
identified on an isolated BAC clone [15].
In this study, we present the complete sequencing of the
C. canephora BAC clone 46C02, carrying the CcEIN4 gene.
Sequence analysis of the 160 kb of the BAC indicates a
high density of active genes and few transposable elements. Sequence comparisons reveal a high microcollinearity between the C. canephora BAC clone and most of the
current dicotyledonous sequenced genomes that diverged
114 to 125 Million Years Ago (MYA).

Results
The C. canephora BAC clone 46C02 carries the mono
locus CcEIN4 gene
The CcEIN4 gene, used as a probe for hybridization,
revealed eight positive BAC clones on the high-density filters of the C. canephora BAC library. Among these clones,
the BAC clone 46C02 was randomly chosen for further
analyses. Low-pass sequencing of about 70 sub-clones
from BAC 46C02 suggested the presence of several potential coding regions and sequence analyses confirmed the
presence of the CcEIN4 gene. Finally, pulsed field analysis
indicated the presence of a large insert of about 160 kb
length.

Segregation analysis of the EIN4 marker, in the interspecific back-cross progeny [(C. canephora × C. heterocalyx) ×
C. canephora], showed mono locus Mendelian segregation
pattern (Figure 1A). In addition, in situ BAC hybridizations (BAC-FISH) showed a unique and chromosomespecific sub-terminal/terminal labeling for 46C02 in a
non-45S rDNA chromosome pair (Figure 1B).

37.3% GC content and a GC content of the predicted coding sequences (CDS) of 45.7%.
Ab initio predictions gave 30, 43 and 55 predicted gene
structures with the FGENESH gene finder trained respectively for grapevine, tomato and tobacco gene models. We
evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by comparative
analysis between predicted gene structures and results of
similarity searches of the BAC sequence against proteins
and nucleotides sequences databases. Manual controls
between ab initio predictions and sequences alignments
suggest numerous incongruities. Over prediction of inaccurate gene models, imprecise exons, mainly located at
the 3' ends of predicted genes supported by EST alignments and inexact predictions of exon-intron boundaries
(start, stop and splicing sites) was observed. These results
indicate a relatively low quality of the ab initio predictions
in C. canephora when using training set of gene models
from different eudicots model genomes. In absence of
available C. canephora training set, we conclude that prediction of the gene structures may be used cautiously.

In total, 21 genes were identified and validated by
sequence alignments, giving an overall gene density of
about one gene per 7.8 kb, considering the partial gene
(g1) that covers the 5' part of the BAC insert (Table 1; Figure 2). Similarities with plant Expressed Sequence Tag
sequences (EST) were found for the 21 identified genes
(Table 1). Eight genes (g2, g4, g5, g6, g7, g14, g15 and g16)
have almost perfect matches with C. canephora ESTs and
mRNA, with sequence identities higher than 97%, suggesting that these genes are expressed. All the remaining
genes have significant matches with plant ESTs (> 70%
identity). On the 10 genes analyzed, seven (g3, g7, g8, g9,
g10, g11 and g13) showed PCR amplifications on two C.
canephora cDNA libraries (Table 1). For genes g3 and g7,
sequencing of PCR products allowed the fine determination of the gene model and then the re-annotation of the
gene predictions. Gene 6 (g6) encodes an ethylene receptor with a high sequence identity (85.7%) with the
tomato ethylene receptor neverripe gene (ETR5 accession
AY600439, [17]). This gene, called CcEIN4 (position from
36174 to 40482 bp), was previously cloned and analyzed

in our lab [15]. On the 19 remaining coding genes, 16
contain known protein domains in pfam database [18]
(Table 1). Among them, a gene coding for an ERF/AP2
transcription factor has been identified from 75,661 to
76,365 bp (g12, CcERF1).
Finally, an unequal distribution of genes was observed
along the BAC sequence. The identified genes were distributed in two main locations (from 1 to 76,365 bp and
from 119,888 to 160,243 bp, Figure 2) with respectively
twelve (g1 – g12) and seven genes (g14 – g20) in the 5'
proximal and 3' distal parts of the BAC. The g1–g12 group
of gene covers ~76 kb with a gene density of approximately one gene per 6.3 kb whereas the g14–g20 group
covers a distance of 40.5 kb with a gene density of one
gene per 5.7 kb. The central part of the BAC, containing
only one gene (g13), covers a distance of 43 kb (Figure 2).

Repeated sequences
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
The availability of the first C. canephora BAC sequence
allowed us to identify the SSR density in genomic
sequences. There were 39 SSRs along the 160,404 bp of
the BAC 46C02, giving an overall genomic SSR density of
one SSR every 4.1 kb. Most of them (32 SSRs) were simple
repeat motifs. The remaining SSRs were di-nucleotides
[CT]20, [CT]9, [TC]9, [AT]9 and [TA]18 and tri-nucleotidesmotifs [GAA]6 and [ATG]7. One of the di-nucleotides SSRs [TC]9, called BAC-37, found in the fourth
intron of the gene g16, coding for a putative Glycosyl
transferase, was mapped on the same linkage group H of
the [(C. canephora × C. heterocalyx) × C. canephora] genetic
map as the EIN4 marker (Figure 1A and 2). The two markers were 1.4 cM apart.

Transposable elements (TEs)
In addition to Simple Sequence Repeats, transposable elements (TE) were identified. In total 23 TEs were annotated, accounting for 7.4 kb of sequence and representing
4.6% of the BAC sequence (Table 2). The TE density
reached one element per 6.97 kb. Transposable elements
appeared uniformly distributed along the BAC sequence
and no particular accumulation was observed. Only one
putative element, weakly similar to the 3' part of a nonLTR retrotransposon in Arabidopsis (AAB82639), falls
into the class I retrotransposon group. However, this element appears truncated and highly degenerated. Most
annotated TEs belong to the class II transposon group.
These identified elements are divided into non-autonomous transposons (five elements), and MITEs (Miniature
inverted repeat transposable elements, 17 elements) representing respectively 21.7% and 73.9% of all identified
elements in the BAC clone. One MITE, called Alex-1 was
found nested within the 13th intron of an expressed gene
encoding a putative protein (g3, position 12,468–12,645
bp, Figure 2).

Similarity searches, using newly identified TEs as query,
against publicly available C. ESTs and genomic sequences
(to date 57,198 and 6,232 sequences, respectively from C.
canephora and C. arabica) were conducted by BLAST with
an E-value cutoff of 10e-5. Similarities were found for
most of the identified elements (Table 2). Interestingly,
two MITE families called Alex and Gerard were found as
the most abundant in each sequence database, suggesting
that these two elements belong to large copy number families in the C. canephora genome.
Identifications of homologous regions between C.
canephora BAC sequence and reference dicotyledonous
genomes
Microcollinearity studies were conducted between the C.
canephora BAC and the genomic sequences of five reference plants (tomato, grapevine, barrel medic, black cottonwood and Arabidopsis) belonging to Asterid and
Rosid clades. Comparisons were achieved with completely and partially sequenced genomes.

The C. canephora BAC shows a partial conservation with a
single BAC clone (Le_HBa0008H22 CU104691) located
on the chromosome IV of tomato (S. lycopersicum,
Solanaceae). Four C. canephora distal genes (g15, g16, g17
and g21), separated by an interval of 28 kb, were conserved in the same order and orientation in tomato on a
distance of 24 kb (51,150–75,409 bp), giving a percentage of collinearity of 32%. In this interval, three C.
canephora contiguous genes (g18, g19 and g20) were not
found neither in the tomato counterpart nor in any other
sequenced tomato BAC clones. Similarly, the other C.
canephora genes were not found conserved in all released
tomato BAC sequences (Figure 3).
The recently released grapevine genome (Vitis vinifera,
Vitaceae [19]) allowed us to identify an additional conserved region with the C. canephora BAC sequence. In total
nine C. canephora predicted genes (g4, g5, CcEIN4, g7, g8,

Scaffold127 of about 1,150 kb length (Le Cunff, L. and

kb (675–945 kb), which represents an expansion of a factor 4.9 compared to the homologous counterpart in C.
canephora. The increase of distances is primarily due to
expansion of intergenic regions. Close examination and
fine annotation of the grapevine 249 kb segment reveal
the presence of numerous transposable elements in intergenic regions such as LTR retrotransposons and transposons (data not shown). Based on the identification of
specific coding regions, the annotation showed the presence of nine complete and large size transposable elements. They account together for approximately 50 kb of
sequence, indicating that the expansion of distance relag10 g11

Overview
Overview of the microcollinearity between C. canephora 46C02 BAC and genomic regions in Arabidospsis
(Arabidopsis thaliana), tomato (S. lycopersicon), Medigago (Medicago truncatula), grapevine (V. vinifera) and
black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) genomes. Colored arrows with names indicate orientation of predicted coding
regions. Stars indicate transcribed genes as suggested by strong EST similarities (see Additional file 1). Colored lines link putative orthologous genes between collinear regions and distances between the most distant collinear genes with C. canephora
BAC are indicated in each conserved fragment. Black arrows indicate non-conserved predicted genes. S. lycopersicon is a fragment (51–75 kb) of the Le_HBa0008H22 BAC clone located on chromosome 4. V. vinifera is a part of the scaffold127 of 1,150
kb long.Medicago truncatula indicates a fragment covered by two BAC clones (AC146861, AC173834). Populus trichocarpa corresponds to two fragments located in the linkage group XIII (3,073–3,289 kb) and in the unlinked scaffold 201 and Arabidopsis
thaliana to two conserved fragments on chromosome III (A: 1,221–1,241 kb and B: 8,255–8,310 kb). Brackets link identify intragenomic duplicated regions. The fragment sizes are not to scale.

tive to the C. canephora segment may be due to a local
accumulation of mobile elements in the grapevine counterpart.
The CcEIN4 region shows a strong microcollinearity relationship with two overlapping barrel medic (M. truncatula; Fabaceae) BAC clones (AC146861 and AC173834) on
chromosome 1 (Figure 3). In total, eight pairs of coding
regions (g5, CcEIN4, g7, g8, g9, g11, g14 and g15) were
found in the same order and orientation between scaffold
201 and Medicago, representing a percentage of collinearity of 40%. The Medicago conserved region spans 101 kb
representing a limited contraction compared to the C.
canephora conserved interval (107 kb), despite the identification of ten extra predicted genes in the Medicago interval compared to C. canephora. To date, the other C.
canephora genes were not found by BLAST searches in
Medicago sequences.
Comparisons between the C. canephora BAC and the complete black cottonwood genome (P. trichocarpa, Salicaceae) revealed extensive conservations with two
different genomic fragments in populus, within a complex
network of microcollinearity. Ten C. canephora coding
regions (g1, g5, CcEIN4, g7, g8, g9, g11, CcERF1, g14 and
g15) were first found in the same order and orientation
with a fragment of 215.9 kb on chromosome XIII (positions on chr. XIII, 3,073–3,289 kb). In addition, four C.
canephora coding regions (g1, g4, g5 and CcEIN4) were
also conserved with a 37 kb part of the unanchored scaffold 201 (111–148 kb) (Figure 3). The percentage of collinearity is 49% and 32% for respectively the segment on
chromosome XIII and the scaffold 201. Comparisons
between C. canephora and black cottonwood homologous
segments indicate a limited expansion of distance in black
cottonwood compared to C. canephora of a factor 1,6 and
1 in chromosome XIII and scaffold 201 segments respectively (Figure 3).
Finally, comparisons between C. canephora and the A.
thaliana (Brassicaceae) genome reveal a complex network
of microcollinearity with two distinct regions located in
the Arabidopsis chromosome III (Figure 3). Homologs of
six C. canephora genes (g5, CcEIN4, g8, g9, g11 and g15)
were conserved in the same order and orientation (collinearity of 44%) with a fragment 20 kb long on Arabidopsis Chromosome III at the position 1,221–1,241 kb.
Here, four genes (g7, g10, CcERF1 and g13) on the C.
canephora interval were not found conserved within the
Arabidopsis homologous fragment. In C. canephora, conserved genes were separated by a distance of 107 kb, indicating an expansion of the fragment length by a factor 5.3
compared to Arabidopsis (Figure 3). Furthermore, three
additional C. canephora genes (CcEIN4, CcERF1 and g19)
were found conserved with an extra part of the Arabidop-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/22

sis chromosome III. Here in the 55 kb of this later fragment (positions on Chr III 8,255–8,310 kb), eleven
Arabidopsis genes were not found in the C. canephora
sequence, that is indicated by the low collinearity percentage (17%). Compared to this second Arabidopsis homologous fragment, a 2.2 × expansion of the coffee segment
length was observed. Analysis of the two Arabidopsis conserved fragments indicates an ancestral segmental duplicated block involving the two homologous Arabidopsis
segments [20-22].

Discussion
The high gene density in the CcEIN4 region represents a
gene-rich segment of the C. canephora genome. The organization and composition of the trancriptionally active
gene part of the C. canephora genome remain unexplored
so far. At the CcEIN4 region, the gene density reaches one
gene per 7.8 kb. Most of these genes (75%) were shown to
be active or potentially active. This value is similar to the
gene density observed in different euchromatic regions in
tomato (genome size 950 Mb), one gene per 6.7 kb [23]
and in the tomato ovate and JOINTLESS loci, one gene per
6.2 and per 8 kb, respectively [7,24]. Similarly, the gene
density in the C. canephora 46C02 BAC clone is comparable to euchromatic regions in M. truncatula (genome size
~500 Mb), one gene per 6.7 kb [25] and in rice, one gene
per 6.7 kb [26]. However this density is relatively low
compared to the Arabidopsis genome (125 Mb) by a factor ~2, one gene per 4 kb, [22,27], but still significantly
high compared to the Populus genome (genome size 550
Mb), one gene per 11.1 kb, [28] and the euchromatic
regions in sorghum (genome size 735 Mb), one gene per
12.3 kb, [29]. The C. canephora nuclei have been estimated
to contain ~1.43 pg of DNA corresponding to a diploid
genome, giving an estimated haploid genome size of ~690
Mb [10]. An extrapolation of the gene number identified
in the 46C02 BAC clone to the whole C. canephora
genome would lead to a predicted gene content of approximately 88,000 genes. This obvious over estimation is significantly higher than the average number of predicted
genes in diploid reference plant genomes such as in
tomato, ~38,000 [30], Arabidopsis, ~25,000 [22], grapevine ~30,000, Populus, 45,000 [28] and rice, ~37,000
[31]. Then, our data suggest that the high density observed
at the CcEIN4 region may be not representative of the
overall gene density of the C. canephora genome but to a
high gene density zone. Gene enriched regions were previously identified in dicotyledonous plant genomes such
as tomato and Medicago [23,32]. The tomato genome
may cluster most of the active genes within 25% of the
950 Mb genome representing the euchromatin [23]. In
Medicago, euchromatin, identified by FISH hybridization
with gene-rich BAC clones, represents 20% of the 500 Mb
genome [32]. These gene rich regions in the genomes of
tomato and Medicago are currently targets of large-scale

genome sequencing projects. Because genes are probably
not uniformly distributed along C. canephora chromosomes, we hypothesize that the high gene density in the
CcEIN4 region represents a gene-rich segment in the C.
canephora genome.
The presence of a high number of identified MITEs in the
CcEIN4 region is correlated with the presence of a high
gene density. The transposable element composition of
the BAC indicates a strong bias in the presence of Class II
elements compared to Class I. With the exception of a
degenerated part of a non-LTR retrotransposon, all identified elements have short lengths and are considered as
non-autonomous because they lack coding capacities for
a transposase involved in their mobility [33]. Due to their
structural characteristics such as their small size (usually
less than 500 bp), the presence of short Terminal Inverted
Repeat (TIR) at both ends and a high A/T content, most of
these elements (73.9%) were identified in C. canephora as
Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITE),
a shorter derivative of non-autonomous class II DNA
transposons [34,35]. MITE families were shown to be the
most abundant TEs in plant genomes, with probably
more than 90,000 copies in the rice genome [36]. Particularly, MITEs were frequently found associated with coding
regions in plant genomic sequence with insertion into
introns as well as into untranslated and promoter regions
[24,37,38], which was confirmed with the complete
sequencing of the Arabidopsis and rice genomes. Here,
the identified MITEs were closely associated with coding
regions as demonstrated by their distribution on the C.
canephora BAC and their redundancies in C. canephora EST
sequences.
The CcEIN4 region is located in the euchromatic part of
the C. canephora. Although the organization of gene-rich
regions along C. canephora chromosomes remains
unknown, previous cytological observations in C.
canephora and C. arabica chromosomes have clearly
shown a pattern of deeply and lightly staining regions
indicating an overall chromosome organization in respectively condensed heterochromatin and decondensed
euchromatin regions [39,40]. Similarly to Medicago and
tomato chromosome architecture, C. canephora heterochromatin regions are mainly located around centromeric
regions while euchromatin constitutes the distal parts of
chromosomes [13,32].

Comparison of the gene order between a C. canephora
BAC clone and reference dicotyledonous genome
sequences shows extensive conservation. Comparative
genomic studies are essential approaches to understand
the evolution of genome structure and to investigate the
conservation of gene order between closely and distantly
related plant species. The evaluation of the genome conservation allows the transfer of information from model
species as references to "orphan" genomes lacking the
availability of resources and may enhance the identification of gene of interest through map-based cloning strategies [41]. The sequencing of a gene rich region in C.
canephora and the availability of several complete or forthcoming sequenced model dicotyledonous genomes such
as Arabidopsis, black cottonwood, barrel medic, tomato
and grape allowed us to investigate multiple microcollinearity relationships over distantly related species covering
two different clades: Asterids and Rosids.
The CcEIN4 region is clearly microcollinear with one
homologous region in tomato, grapevine and Medicago
and two homologous regions in Arabidopsis and in Populus genomes. Phylogenetically, C. canephora is closely
related to tomato since they belong to the Asterid I clade
and diverged from a common ancestor about 83–89 Million Years Ago (MYA) (Figure 4)[42]. Arabidopsis, Medicago, Populus and grapevine are more distant than
tomato since they are all members of the Rosid clade,
which diverged from the Asterid one 114–125 MYA (Figure 4). In the region studied here the number of collinear
segments per genome and the degree of microcollinearity
appeared heterogeneous. The CcEIN4 region is microcollinear with one homologous region both in tomato,
grapevine and Medicago chromosomes, but scattered on
two regions in Arabidopsis and in Populus genomes with
a different degree of collinearity for each pair of homologous segments. These extra microcollinear segments lead

euchromatic part of the C. canephora chromosome corresponding to the LG H of C. heterocalyx.

to a complex network of conservation similar to that
observed between tomato and Arabidopsis [6,7], Medicago and Arabidopsis [4,5], Medicago, soybean and Arabidopsis [43], Populus and Cucumis [9] and Arabidopsis
and legumes genomes [5]. Such a network of conservation
was recently suggested at synteny level between markers of
the C. arabica SH3 region and Arabidopsis chromosomes
1, 3, 4 and 5 [44]. The analysis of networks of collinearity
contributed to the discovery of recent large-scale chromosome duplications that shaped the genomes of Arabidopsis, Populus and Medicago, as well as the understanding
of the evolutionary mechanisms that reorganized the
duplicated blocks [20,21,28,45]. Moreover, recent comparative analysis between grapevine and the different reference genomes such as Arabidopsis, Populus and rice
suggested no recent duplication, but an ancestral contribution of three genomes in grapevine common to all
Eurosid plants [19], The data reported here confirm the
paleopolyploid structure of the Arabidopsis and the Populus genomes. However, few collinear genes were found
conserved between paralogous segments in Arabidopis
and Populus, corresponding to the C. canephora CcEIN4
region. In Arabidopsis an extensive process of selective
gene loss has shaped the paralogous segments while in
Populus the duplicated block appeared very limited in
length. Similar observations were described in other
regions of paleopolyploid plant genomes where duplicated blocks were found subjected to intense mechanisms
of gene movements and large rearrangements [20,28].
Although the presence of genome duplications and
ancient triplication were respectively established in Medicago and suggested in grapevine, no network of collinearity was found between the C. canephora CcEIN4 region
and these model species. Similar observations were found
between the melon linkage group 11 and Medicago
sequences [9] and between chickpea and Medicago
sequences [46] reflecting the incomplete sequence of the
Medicago genome or a region not covered by ancient
polyploidization events in the Medicago and the grapevine genomes.

sequence overlapping the entire homologous C. canephora
BAC sequence is publicly available, suggesting that the
homologous CcEIN4 region was not completely
sequenced as part of the tomato genome project. Progress
in the tomato sequencing project and future large scale
genomic sequencing in C. canephora will allow us to reevaluate the microcollinearity over several regions and to
determine the limits of tomato genome as a tool to identify candidate genes in C. canephora. Nine genes were
found strictly collinear and only two coding regions,
located in the grapevine interval, were absent in the C.
canephora counterpart. In contrast, an unexpected degree
of microcollinearity was found between C. canephora and
all Rosid plant genomes used in this study. The higher
degree of microcollinearity (56%) corresponds to the
comparisons between C. canephora and grapevine regions.
In this later case, nine genes were found strictly collinear
and only two coding regions, located in the grapevine
interval, were absent in the C. canephora counterpart.
Despite the high degree of microcollinearity, an expansion of distance of a factor 4.9 in grapevine was observed
due to differential accumulations of transposable elements in intergenic spaces. This expansion of distance in
grapevine is not correlated with the genome sizes in grapevine (~504 Mb, [47]) and in C. canephora (~690 Mb,
[10]).

Considering the divergence between C. canephora and the
model dicotyledonous plant genomes studied in this
work, we expected a higher degree of microcollinearity
between the Rubiaceae and the Solanaceae families than
between Asterid and the distantly related Rosid clades. Synteny was observed between tomato and C. canephora in
preliminary comparative mapping using COSII markers
and microcollinearity relationships were previously demonstrated between tomato and the distant species Arabidopsis [6,7,24]. However, in the present work, only four
genes were conserved in the same order and orientation
over a similar distance and homologs of other Coffea
genes were not present in all currently released tomato
BAC sequences. Unfortunately, to date no tomato BAC

The level of microcollinearity is still fairly high with Populus (LG XIII, 49%), Arabidopsis (segment A, 40%) and
Medicago segments (40%) but lower than with grapevine.
Several disruptions of the microcollinearity were observed
between C. canephora and Populus, Arabidopsis and Medicago giving a mosaic pattern of conservation. In Populus
and Medicago, the disruptions of the microcollinearity are
due to the presence of numerous nonconserved genes
with the C. canephora counterpart. Most of the extra genes
in Populus and Medicago are not collinear across the
Rosid model species suggesting that these gene insertions
may arise from independent events of gene translocation
mechanisms. Five genes located downstream the collinear
region between Medicago and C. canephora were found to

As it was previously observed in comparative analysis in
grass genomes, massive insertions and deletions of TEs
may promote a rapid genome evolution and may participate in the disruption of the microcollinearity [48]. Our
analyses suggest that beside the alteration of distance,
insertions of TE in grapevine show no impact on microcollinearity. Our observations indicate that a significant
microcollinearity may be expected between C. canephora
and grapevine. Phylogenetically, grapevine belongs to the
Vitaceae family that is the earliest diverging lineage of the
Rosid clade [49]. To date, it remains unclear whether the
phylogenetic relationships of Vitaceae are at the origin of
the local genome conservation with C. canephora.

be collinear between Medicago and tomato. The extension of the microcollinearity pinpoints the complete
absence in Medicago of a cluster of six genes present in C.
canephora (g16 to g21), reinforcing the mosaic pattern of
the gene conservation.
Despite the observation of the microcollinearity disruption, and considering the large number of collinear genes
and distantly related species involved in this analysis, we
conclude that the C. canephora CcEIN4 region is significantly conserved with all reference dicotyledonous species
used in our analysis. Such observations raise the question
whether the microcollinearity observed at the CcEIN4
region can be representative of the conservation between
distantly related species or indicative of a larger conservation of the genome organization. So far, no other comparative analysis has been performed between C. canephora or
any other Rubiaceae genomic sequences, and model
dicotyledonous plant species. Further comparative mapping across dicotyledonous species will provide useful
information about the conservation of the plant genome
structure and also to determine a set of model genomes to
infer positional information of candidate genes in C.
canephora.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our exploration of the first sequenced BAC
clone in the Rubiaceaae family represents the first step in
the understanding the C. canephora genome composition,
structure, and evolution. Particularly C. canephora shows a
remarkable level of microcollinearity with the distantly
related Rosid species. In the absence of the complete
tomato genome sequence, our data suggest the grapevine
genome may be useful to obtain information to identify
candidate genes in C. canephora.

Methods
Screening C. canephora BAC library and manipulation of
BAC DNA
The screening of the C. canephora (clone IF 126) BAC
library [12] representing approximately 9 genome equivalents was carried out using specific probe located in the
previously isolated CcEIN4 gene [15]. The probe was
amplified from the CcEIN4 cDNA with the following specific primers: SEIN4F 5'-GCCCTTGCGATTAATGAACCAG-3'
and
SEIN4R
5'AGGCACAAGCACTTAACCAAACAA-3'. Probe preparation and BAC library high-density filters hybridization
were performed as described in [16]. Through the hybridization, the BAC 46C02 was selected for further analysis.
DNA of BAC 46C02 was isolated using the Plasmid Midi
Kit (Qiagen Courtaboeuf, France) and used for further
analyses. The insert size estimation was carried out by
pulsed field (BioRad CHEF Gel Apparatus) with BAC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/22

DNA digested by NotI with the following parameters:
volts/cm = 5.0; included angle 120°; run time = 15 hours
at 14°C; initial switch time = 5 sec; final switch time = 15
sec.
BAC-FISH mapping
The 46C02 BAC clone was labeled by random priming
with biotin-14-dUTP (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise,
France). The ribosomal probe used in this study was pTa
71 [50] which contained a 9-kb EcoRI fragment of rDNA
repeat unit (18S-5.8S-26S genes and spacers) isolated
from Triticum aestivum. pTa 71 was labelled with Alexa488 dUTP by random priming (Fisher Bioblock Scientific,
Illkirch, France).

Chromosome preparations from C. canephora (genotype
BB62, from Central African Republic) were incubated in
Rnase A (100 ng/μL) and pepsin (0.05%) in 10 mmol
HCL, fixed with paraformaldehyde (1%), dehydrated in
an ethanol series (70%, 90% and 100%) and air-dried.
The hybridization mixture consisted of 50% deionized
formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 × SSC, 1% SDS and
labelled probes (200 ng per slide), was denatured at 92°C
for 6 min, and transferred to ice. Chromosomes were
denatured in a solution of 70% formamide in 2× SSC at
70°C for 2 min. The denatured probe was placed on the
slide and in situ hybridization was carried out overnight in
a moist chamber at 37°C. After hybridization, slides were
washed for 5 min in 50% formamide in 2 × SSC at 42°C,
followed by several washes in 4 × SSC-Tween. The chromosomes were mounted and counterstained in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 2.5 μg/mL 4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence images
were captured using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Ariz) on an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) and analysed using MetaVue™
(Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA).
BAC sequencing
The BAC DNA was first sub-cloned into the TOPO vector
(Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and 70 sub-clones
were randomly selected for low-pass sequencing. Complete sequencing of the BAC 46C02 was performed by
MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). A total of 1105
reads were produced giving an average coverage of 5.4×.
After shotgun sequencing, sequences were assembled
using the Phred/Phrap software [51], producing an assembly of 13 contigs. Regions of low quality as well as gaps
between contigs were filled by PCR amplifications with
specific primers and then sequenced (MWG Biotech). The
final error rate for the BAC sequence was below 1 base per
10 kb. The BAC sequence was deposited in GenBank
under the accession number EU164537.

Genetic analysis
Two internal primers in the CcEIN4 gene were first
designed (EIN4-RTF: AGAAGCTAGTTGGCATGTCCGGAT
EIN4-RTR: GCAACTCGCAGCACCAAGTACTGA) and
used as STS (Sequence Tag Site) for genetic mapping. The
resulting marker was denominated EIN4. Using the SSR
pipeline program [52], a microsatellite repeat [TC]9
(called BAC-37) was detected in silico at 105 kb away from
the CcEIN4 gene. Flanking primers were designed (BAC37-F: TCATTTTTGTCCGGGGATAC, BAC-37-R: ATGGAAA
CCGAAGAGGAAAG), and tested for amplification. PCR
amplification was carried out on genomic DNA as
described in [53]. Segregation analyses were performed on
the interspecific progeny (74 individuals) derived from
the back-cross [(C. canephora × C. heterocalyx) × C.
canephora], which had been used to build a genetic map
([54] and unpublished results). Linkage analyses were
performed using MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0b [55,56], and
Mapdisto (version 1.37, available via http://map
disto.free.fr) software packages.
Sequence Analysis and Gene Annotation Methods
The final BAC sequence was analyzed using BLAST algorithms [57] against public and local plant nucleotide and
protein databases. Coding regions were first ab initio predicted using the FGENESH [58] gene finder software
trained for three different eudicot gene species (N. tabacum, S. lycopersicum and V. vinifera) since no training set
for C. canephora was available so far. Evaluation of predicted gene structures (i.e. coding regions, spliced sites,
start and stop codons), were manually conducted by
alignments with protein and nucleotide genomic
sequences and confirmed by local alignments with Coffea
public ESTs or specific cDNA PCR amplifications followed
by sequencing. An additional genes structure validation
was conducted by Felipe Rodrigues da Silva from the Cenergen (Embrapa) on C. arabica ESTs isolated by the Brazilian
Coffee
Genomic
Consortium
http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/cafe/. Predicted genes with no
similarity hits in all protein and nucleotide sequence databases were rejected in final annotation and considered as
putative inaccurate predictions. Detailed analysis was performed with the EMBOSS Analysis software [59] and the
final annotation was performed using Artemis [60].
Annotation and classification of repeated sequences
Microsatellite (SSR) markers were identified using the SSR
pipeline program with previously described parameters
[52]. Putative transposable elements (TEs) were first identified and annotated by RepeatMasker http://www.repeat
masker.org searches against local databases of nucleotide
and protein sequences of known plant TEs. De novo prediction of TEs was performed according to the structure of
the different class of TEs such as tandem and inverted
repeats using dot-plot alignments, (Dotter software [61]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/22

Putative TEs were named according to the following
nomenclature: the first two letters of each TE name represent the acronym of the species (i.e. Cc for Coffea
canephora), the following two letters indicate the type of
TE (RT for retrotransposon; TR for transposon; MT for
MITE, HL for helitron and UN for unknown class of
repeat) and following a hyphen the specific name of the
element.
PCR Amplifications on cDNA libraries
Two C. canephora cDNA libraries, prepared from young
leaves and fruits at different stages of development and
maturation [62] were used for PCR amplifications with
specific primers designed from genes identified on the
BAC clone 46C02 (5'-GGCTGAGTTGGAACACTGGT-3'
and 5'-TTAGGCTGGAAGCAAGAAGC-3' for 46C02_g1,
5'-GTTTGGTTGCTGGGTCTCAT-3' and 5'-CGACAAGAGGAAAGCCTCAC-3' for 46C02_g3, 5'-ACGAGTGGGTTTCCTGAGTG-3' and 5'-TGGGTCTCTGGAACTTACCG-3'
for 46C02_g7, 5'-ACTCGGAGGCCTAGAGGAAG-3' and

46C02_g9,
5'-GAAAACTTTCG

5'-ACGCAGTCCTATGCTCCTGT-3' for 46C02_g11, 5'ATTCCCAGCATTGTCAGTCC-3' and 5'-TGCATCTGCTTCAACGACTC-3' for 46C02_g12, 5'-CTACTGCTTTGCTCGGGAAC-3' and 5'-GGAGCATGATCGTCTCCAAT3' for 46C02_g13, 5'-GATGGAGAAATCCCAAATGC-3'
and 5'-GACTGCAGGATGTTCAGCAA-3' for 46C02_g17,
5'-TCAAAAGTTTGAGTCGTTTGGA-3' and 5'-ACCAGCA

TGCTG-3' for to 46C02_g20). Amplified products were
directly sequenced without cloning.
Analysis of the microcollinearity with plant genomes
To study in detail the microcollinearity relationships
between C. canephora and model dicotyledonous
genomes, the nucleotide and protein sequences of twenty
predicted coding genes and one tRNA from the C.
canephora BAC were used as queries for BLAST searches
against a local database composed of A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum, M. truncatula, P. trichocarpa and V. vinifera nucleotide and protein sequences downloaded respectively
from TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org, SOL http://
www.sgn.cornell.edu/, M. truncatula sequencing resources
http://www.medicago.org/, JGI http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html and the V. vinifera genome
database
http://www.plantgdb.org/VvGDB/down
load.php. Coding regions in non-annotated genomic
sequences were identified using FGENESH [58] trained
with the appropriate genome matrix. Collinear regions
were defined as the conservation of a minimum of three

genes in a maximum distance of 200 kb between compared sequences. In order to specify the robustness of the
observed collinearity relationships we calculated a percentage of collinearity as the number of genes involved in
the collinearity relationships in the two segments, divided
by the total number of genes only present in the collinear
part of the two segments compared.
