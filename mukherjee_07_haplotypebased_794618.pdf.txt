Abstract
Background: Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a common sporadic form of the illness,
affecting individuals above the age of 65 yrs. A prominent hypothesis for the aetiopathology of
Alzheimer's disease is that in the presence of a β-amyloid load, individuals expressing a pathogenic
form of tau protein (MAPT) are at increased risk for developing the disease. Genetic studies in this
pursuit have, however, yielded conflicting results. A recent study showed a significant haplotype
association (H1c) with AD. The current study is an attempt to replicate this association in an
independently ascertained cohort.
Results: In this report we present the findings of a haplotype analysis at the MAPT locus. We failed
to detect evidence of association of the H1c haplotype at the MAPT locus with LOAD. None of the
six SNPs forming the H1c haplotype showed evidence of association with disease. In addition,
nested clade analysis suggested the presence of independent mutations at multiple points in the
haplotype network or homoplasy at the MAPT locus. Such homoplasy can confound single SNP tests
for association. We do not detect evidence that the set of SNPs forming the H1c haplotype in
general or rs242557 in particular are pathogenic for LOAD.
Conclusion: In conclusion, we employed two contemporary haplotype analysis tools to perform
haplotype association analysis at the MAPT locus. Our data suggest that the tagged SNPs forming
the H1c haplotype do not have a causal role in the pathogenesis of LOAD.

Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD [MIM 104300]) is a common,
genetically influenced disorder with a prevalence rate of
5–10%. A majority of AD cases manifest as the sporadic
late onset form (LOAD [MIM 606626]), typically with
onset above the age of 65 years. Clinically, the disease is
characterized by subtle memory loss at onset followed by

a slowly progressive dementia. Pathological inclusions
include β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
(NFT) of hyperphosphorylated tau protein [1]. Many
shared pathological processes such as production, aggregation, metabolism and removal of specific proteins are
now recognized among neurodegenerative diseases [2]. In
this context the microtubule associated protein, tau

(MAPT) gene serves as a logical candidate gene for susceptibility for AD, however studies testing for association
between polymorphisms within MAPT and AD have
resulted in equivocal results [3-5]. Positive association
studies of MAPT and neurodegenerative diseases divide
the MAPT locus into two divergent clades, H1 and H2,
with H2 being a single haplotype covering several genes
on the long arm of chromosome 17. The H2 haplotype
represents a sub-chromosomal inversion of over 1 megabase, resulting in reduced recombination in this region of
chromosome 17 [6]. The H1 haplotype, on the other
hand, shows considerable variation [7,8]. A recent report
suggested a strong association between a specific variant
of the H1 clade (H1c) with AD and other sporadic tauopathies [5,9]. In this report we sought to replicate this association in a large clinical cohort of LOAD from the same
genetic pool.

Results
Single SNP association
None of the six markers tested showed significant differences in the allelic distribution between LOAD cases and
control samples. Table 1 summarizes the single SNP association results. Allele frequencies estimated using the control samples were comparable to previous published
reports [5]. The del-In9 polymorphism, defining the H1/
H2 clades was the only marker showing a trend towards
association with AD (Table 1; fig 1b). This is in contrast to
several previous reports [5,10,11].
Linkage Disequilibrium analysis
Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was carried
out for all of the SNPs in the 358 unrelated control individuals using the Haploview program. The position of the
relevant SNPs and the resulting D' plot is presented in figure 1c. We observed high to moderate D' scores between
the tagging SNPs and del-In9. Haplotype frequencies were
estimated using WHAP. Most of the haplotypes inferred in
this dataset matched with a previous report [5]. We did
not, however, observe a difference in the haplotype frequencies between the cases and controls (Table 2).
Nested Clade analysis
To further our analysis and confirm the above negative
report; we performed an independent robust haplotype
analysis which incorporates evolutionary information.
HAP inferred a total of 38 phased haplotypes in our dataset. The haplotype network constructed using all of the
haplotypes showed several loops indicating ambiguous
connections. Due to ambiguity in the network, we did not
use this network for association analysis; however we did
observe homoplasy for all six SNPs. In order to decrease
the ambiguity in the network it was estimated using haplotypes with a frequency of 5% or greater. The resulting
network included a single ambiguous loop. Using the fre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/3

quency criterion, the loop was broken and the resultant
network is presented in figure 2[12]. There was no significant difference in the haplotype frequencies between the
cases and the controls across any branch of the haplotype
network in the nested contingency analyses (table 3). It is
interesting at this point to mention that even when only
common haplotypes were considered homoplasy was
inferred for the promoter polymorphism rs242557.

Discussion
The assortment of conflicting results at the MAPT locus
makes it difficult to assign a pathological role for MAPT in
LOAD. Several reasons could contribute to this failure
including methodological differences, variation in sample
size and, most importantly, the use of unphased genotype
data to analyze regions showing evidence of recurrent
mutation and recombination. The current case control
study was designed to investigate the relationship
between the H1c haplotype, formed by six htSNPs in
MAPT, with LOAD. We used a regression-based haplotype
association suite as employed in the program WHAP and
confirmed the negative results using a cladistic approach.
Nested clade analysis provides a design to group haplotypes based on evolutionary relatedness to test for disease
association [13]. This approach of grouping closely
related haplotypes together increases the power of analysis by reducing the degrees of freedom. Since closely
related haplotypes are grouped together, mutations of
biological consequence can be localized to a small subset
of haplotypes. This also guards the analysis against comparing rare haplotypes. Thus, nested clade analysis was
the most appropriate method to re-evaluate the H1c association. The uncertainty of the correct haplotype network
(due to ambiguity in this study) decreases the power of
the approach, although it was helpful in revealing important information, such as the presence of homoplasy and
historical recombination at the locus being studied. The
presence of homoplasy may prove to be an important factor in the analysis of candidate regions for disease association. Although the network estimated from all the
inferred haplotypes contained a large number of ambiguous connections, we were able to identify the occurrence
of multiple mutations at each of these six loci at independent parts of the network. Even after removing all the
rare haplotypes and constructing the haplotype network,
homoplasy was observed for the marker rs242557. This
marker has been previously implicated as an important
risk factor for sporadic tauopathies such as PSP and CBD
[9] as well as for AD [5]. The lack of association of this
marker in our sample set coupled with the results of the
nested clade analysis, suggests that rs242557 may not
have a causal effect on AD, but may be in LD with another
marker which does. It is also important to note that the
samples used in this study differed from those used by
Myers et al. (2005) [5]. Our samples were clinically diag-

nosed while the samples in their study were pathologically confirmed cases and controls. This is one possible
cause for the difference in the association findings,
although it would have been expected that the H1c frequency in the controls might have been higher in our

study because some clinical controls may have undetected
preclinical AD. However, we observed that the frequency
of the H1c haplotype in our AD cases was similar to our
controls and to the controls in the study of Myers et al
(2005) [5].

The names of the haplotypes are as per Myers et al., (2005) [5]. Unnamed haplotypes were inferred only in this dataset. The status at del-In9 is
represented by (-) for the deletion and (+) for the insertion.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we used two robust haplotype analysis
tools to test for association of the H1c haplotype with
LOAD using a case control design. Our data does not support the positive association of htSNPs forming the H1c
haplotype within MAPT with LOAD and suggests that
rs242557 is unlikely to be the functional allele as previously suggested in some positive associations reported for
tauopathies (Myers et al., 2005) [5].

Methods
Subjects
The case-control series used in this study was collected
through the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center (ADRC) patient registry. Cases in this
series received a diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's
type (DAT), using criteria equivalent to the NINCDSADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and
Related Disorders Association) [14], modified slightly to
include AD as a diagnosis for individuals aged > 90 years
[15]. A total of 361 unrelated DAT cases with a minimum
age at onset of 60 years were recruited for the study. DNA
from 358 age and sex matched non-demented controls
aged > 60 years at assessment were obtained through the
ADRC. A detailed description of the sample can be found
elsewhere [16,17].

Genotyping
A total of 6 tag SNPs, including two promoter polymorphisms (rs1467967 and rs242557), three intronic SNPs
(rs3785883, rs2471738 and rs7521) and the intron 9
insertion-deletion (del-In9) polymorphism, were used in
this study [5]. Written informed consent was obtained
from all subjects and/or their caregiver who participated
in this study. Approval from the Institutional Review
Board was obtained prior to any genetic analysis. The delIn9 polymorphism was assayed by Pyrosequencing as
described earlier [18]. Genotyping for the rest of the SNPs
was performed using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(Sequenom). PCR primers and primer extension assays
were designed by using SPECTROGEN software (Sequenom). SNP assays were designed to generate extension
products of different masses resulting in genotype
dependent peak appearance.
Statistical analysis
To measure linkage disequlibrium (LD) between the tag
SNPs, Lewontin's standardized pairwise LD coefficient
(D') and the Pearson's correlation (r2) were calculated
using haploview [19]. The distribution of frequencies at
the allelic and haplotypic level between cases and controls
was compared using WHAP [20]. The single marker analysis is a χ2 test with empirical significance with multiple

testing adjustments determined by permutation. Haplotype analysis used a regression-based association test
through a likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is a χ2 test
with n-1 degrees of freedom to determine the associated
p-value.
Nested clade analysis
Placing haplotypes in their evolutionary context improves
their biological information [21]. For this analysis,
phased haplotypes were reconstructed from genotype data
by employing the imperfect phylogeny method implemented in the program HAP [22]. A set of 95% plausible
haplotype trees, connecting the haplotypes by mutational
steps, was constructed using statistical parsimony in the
program TCS [23]. The presence of loops in the resulting
haplotype network indicates that there are alternative,
equally parsimonious ways of connecting the haplotypes.
Such ambiguity in a haplotype network may be due to
either recurrent mutations (homoplasy) and/or recombination within the region.

The nested statistical design proposed by Templeton and
Sing (1993) was used to derive a nested design for analyzing the haplotypes [24]. The methodology involves
grouping haplotypes into "clades" based on their evolutionary relatedness. Association between the phenotype
and the haplotypes is performed by a series of 2 × 2 contingency tests. For each test the number of cases and controls was compared between adjacent clades using a
Fisher's exact test.
