the extent of nucleotide polymorphisms and low
recombination

Abstract
Background: Most of the DNA variations found in bacterial species are in the form of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), but there is some debate regarding how much of this variation comes from mutation
versus recombination. The nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria Rhizobium etli is highly variable in both genomic
structure and gene content. However, no previous report has provided a detailed genomic analysis of this variation
at nucleotide level or the role of recombination in generating diversity in this bacterium. Here, we compared draft
genomic sequences versus complete genomic sequences to obtain reliable measures of genetic diversity and then
estimated the role of recombination in the generation of genomic diversity among Rhizobium etli.
Results: We identified high levels of DNA polymorphism in R. etli, and found that there was an average divergence
of 4% to 6% among the tested strain pairs. DNA recombination events were estimated to affect 3% to 10% of the
genomic sample analyzed. In most instances, the nucleotide diversity (π) was greater in DNA segments with
recombinant events than in non-recombinant segments. However, this degree of recombination was not
sufficiently large to disrupt the congruence of the phylogenetic trees, and further evaluation of recombination in
strains quartets indicated that the recombination levels in this species are proportionally low.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that R. etli is a species composed of separated lineages with low homologous
recombination among the strains. Horizontal gene transfer, particularly via the symbiotic plasmid characteristic of
this species, seems to play an important role in diversity but the lineages maintain their evolutionary cohesiveness.

Background
Bacterial species typically contain large amounts of
genetic variation in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which originate by mutation and
have dynamics that depend on the balance between natural selection and genetic drift [1,2]. There is some
debate on whether or not most of these polymorphisms
are selectively neutral at the molecular level [3]. Species
have been genetically defined through the analysis of
DNA variation using comparative techniques such as
hybridization, the sequencing of gene markers, and
(more recently) complete genome sequences [4,5]. It has

been proposed that similarity values greater than 70%
obtained in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments are
sufficient to define a coherent group of organisms as
belonging to the same species [6]. These estimates are
very rough, subject to experimental variation, and they
only indirectly measure similarity (i.e. via hybridization
efficiency) [7]. A comparative analysis of complete genomes minimizes most of these limitations. Several measures of genomic relatedness, such as the Average
Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and the Maximal Unique
Matches (MUM) have been proposed for such analyses
[8,9]. Both ANI and MUM are based on pairwise
nucleotide comparisons of complete genomes, and several reports have shown good correlations between the
results from these analyses and other measures of
genetic relatedness, such as those based on Multilocus
Sequencing Typing (MLST), 16S sequencing, and gene

content [10]. However, these comparative methods rely
on the availability of complete genome sequences and
are affected by the quality of the DNA sequencing data,
which in the case of draft genomes might not be optimal [10]. The latter issue has not been thoroughly
addressed in past studies. One exception was the comparisons made by Richter and Roselló-Mora [10], who
suggested that low genome sequence coverage can be
sufficient for inferring DNA similarity values comparable
to ANI obtained with complete genomes.
Bacterial species have mechanisms for gene exchange
(transformation, conjugation and transduction), and
genetic recombination is believed to play a prominent
role in diversifying species by distributing variation and
generating new allele combinations [11]. Horizontal
gene transfer is an important source of genomic variation within and between species [12-16], and homologous recombination frequently results in the exchange
of small genomic regions between members of the same
or closely related species [17]. The estimated rates of
homologous recombination vary widely among bacteria;
in some instances, recombination seems to have contributed to species diversification to a greater extent than
even point mutations, whereas in other species homologous recombination appears to be rare [18].
Recombination has typically been assessed by molecular techniques such as Multilocus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism
(AFLP), or Multi Locus Sequence Typing MLST
[19-21]. These methods primarily measure linkage disequilibrium (LD), and are based on the degree of allele
association at different housekeeping loci. For example,
E. coli strains show strong LD, reflecting infrequent
genetic mixing within local populations [22]. More
recently, the availability of complete genomic sequences
has allowed recombination to be assessed more accurately [23]. Interestingly, genomic sequencing combined
with analyses of population genetics have shown that
the recombination rates within E. coli are higher than
the mutation rates, but not to the extent that the phylogenetic signal is distorted [24]. Despite frequent recombination between strains, therefore, the genes seem to
coexist in an organized genome, resulting in a chromosomal plasticity that accelerates the adaptation of E. coli
to various environments.
In this work, we studied the intraspecific variability
and recombination in Rhizobium etli, a soil bacterium
that associates with bean roots to fix nitrogen. Previous
studies have noted that this species has a variable gene
content and high genomic divergence [24], as well as a
low rate of recombination (in housekeeping genes)
among isolates from the same geographical site
[22,25,26]. However, in isolates (from the same geographical site) of Sinorhizobium medicae, it was found that

frequency of recombination was higher in plasmids and
megaplasmids, as compared to the chromosome [27].
The first purpose of this work was to perform a detailed
genomic analysis of the nucleotide variation in this species. Accordingly, we used stringent methods to identify
SNPs from a set of complete and draft genomes of R.
etli, assessed the value of draft genomes and low coverage data when seeking to obtain global measures of
genetic relatedness, and then examined the nucleotide
differences among various strains of R. etli. The second
purpose was to assess the role of recombination in generating genomic diversity in R. etli. Our results confirm
and extend the previous estimations on the genomic
diversity of R. etli, and indicate that recombination
might play only a minor role in generating such diversity. Therefore, we conclude that the species R. etli is
composed of separate genomic lineages that share a low
rate of recombination but have a common symbiotic
phenotype.

Results
Nucleotide variation assessment in complete and draft
genomes

Since accurate SNP identification relies largely on the
quality of the sequence data, the use of draft genome
sequences could potentially introduce errors into the
variation estimates. Therefore, stringent parameters (see
Methods) were used to identify high-quality SNPs in a
set of two complete R. etli genomes, CFN42 and
CIAT652, isolated from México and Costa Rica respectively, and six draft genome sequences from strains isolated in different places of the world: BRASIL5 (Brazil),
CIAT894 (Colombia), GR56, IE4771 (México), KIM5
(USA), and 8C-3 and GR56 (Spain) [24]. All the Sanger
reads were collected from the draft genomes (about
13,000 reads of 1000 nucleotides in length per genome
on average) were aligned against the predicted ORFs of
the CFN42 or CIAT652 genomes, and the alignments
were evaluated using Polybayes (additional file 1 Figure
S1), which determined the probability that a nucleotide
site was polymorphic, based on the Phred quality of the
read. A Phred value of Q20 and a probability greater
than 0.90 are generally considered acceptable for the
detection of SNPs [28]. Most of the SNPs in our data
set had probability scores > 0.975, indicating that more
than 100,000 SNPs per genome had Phred qualities over
Q45 (additional file 1 Figure S1). To avoid the possible
inclusion of false positives (in average 27,000 SNPs by
each strain), we used only SNPs with a minimum Phred
score of Q45 and the highest Bayesian probabilities (>
0.99) throughout this work [29].
Additional errors in SNP determination might arise
from poorly aligned regions. Since R. etli genomes have
a high proportion of paralogous sequences [24,30], a

1× coverage versus those obtained with the complete
genome assembled at about 10× coverage, indicating
that 1× coverage of the genome sequence could be considered a robust proxy of full variation at the genomic
level in this species.
SNP frequencies among the R. etli strains

We quantified the SNPs in R. etli by computing the
pairwise nucleotide differences between individual draft
genomes versus the complete genomes of strains CFN42
or CIAT652. More SNPs were found in comparisons
made versus the CFN42 genome (Figure 2, gray boxes)
than the CIAT652 genome (Figure 2, blue boxes). For
example, the BRASIL5 strain had a median of 5% SNPs
per aligned fragment when compared with CFN42 but
only 2% compared to CIAT652, indicating that BRASIL5
is more closely related to CIAT652 than CFN42. Similarly, variance was higher when BRASIL5 was compared
with CFN42 rather than CIAT652 (Figure 2). A very
similar pattern was found for strain 8C-3. The other
strains showed similar levels of variation, on the order
of 6% (CFN42) and 4% (CIAT652), with the latter comparison always showing a lower variance. Comparison
between the complete genomes of CFN42 and CIAT652
(Figure 2, red box) result in a median variation of 9%,
that is high but still lower than the comparisons
between CFN42 and R. leguminosarum bv viciae 3841
(Figure 2 green box). Moreover, when we compared R.
leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 with all of the R. etli

stringent identification of orthologous segments of genes
was performed. We aligned the contigs of each draft
genome sequence against the ORFs from the complete
genomes of either CFN42 or CIAT652, using both
ungapped and gapped alignments, along with the reciprocal best hit criteria. We considered DNA gene segments as being orthologous to the reference sequence if
they had nucleotide identities higher than 85% and coverage higher than 60% of the reference gene. Various
numbers of orthologous segments were identified from
the draft genomes, covering about 40% of the total gene
contents of the reference strains. The total amount of
data collected by this procedure is about 2 to 2.5 Mb
per draft genome (additional file 1 Table S1).
To determine the robustness of the above-described
procedure, we simulated a draft assembly by using Sanger read samples of the complete genomes of different
E. coli strains at low coverage (1x) (see Methods). The
contigs of the simulated assembly were aligned with the
genome of E. coli K12, and SNPs were detected as
described above. On average, the obtained nucleotide
variation ranged from about 1% to 2% (SNPs/alignment
length) (Figure 1). There was no significant difference

Figure S2), the greatest difference in SNP percentage
(median 11%) was seen in the comparison with strain
CFN42 (Figure 2 green boxes, and discussion section).

We sought to obtain a single measure of the nucleotide
variation across the whole set of genomes. To this end,
we averaged the medians of the SNP distributions for
each alignment (i.e., the number of SNPs/alignment
length of each draft genome with respect to CFN42 or
CIAT652) and generated average confidence interval
(obtained and adjusted by distribution of genes size
medians) using Predictive Analytics Software PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). This statistical test of
proportions compares the observed proportions of an
event (here, SNPs) in k samples (here, strains), uses a
chi-squared test to seek significant differences among
the proportions, and subsequently adjusts the confidence intervals for each sample. The generated measure,
herein called the average nucleotide variation (ANV),
might represent the species-level variation. We obtained
ANV values of 4% and 6% when we compared all the
analyzed strains against CIAT652 and CFN42, respectively (Figure 3). Although the largest numbers of SNPs
were found in comparisons with the CFN42 genome, all
strains were similarly divergent according to the 95%
confidence intervals with respect to the median (blue
lines in Figure 3). This observation indicates that
CFN42 is almost equally divergent with respect to all
other strains. Comparisons with the CIAT652 genome
showed that strains BRASIL5 and 8C-3 were closer to
this strain than to CFN42. Moreover, the CIAT894
strain yielded the highest number of SNPs, causing its
average SNP proportion to fall outside the average confidence interval (red lines in Figure 3). Strains CIAT894
and IE4771 showed greater divergences than the rest of
the strains, regardless of the reference strain (CFN42 or
CIAT652) used in the comparison.
Nucleotide variation profiles in homologous genomic
segments from different R. etli strains

To explore how SNPs are distributed in the R. etli genomes, we first identified orthologous segments for which
we had sequence information in all eight studied strains
(Figure 4). A total of 240 segments with a median size
of 275 bp were common to all strains, and spanned a
total of about 71,630 bp that represent about 1% of the
genome length. These sequences mapped mainly to the
chromosomes of CFN42 and CIAT652 (92%), with a
lower proportion (8%) distributing to plasmids. We generated a concatenated alignment of these shared segments according to the gene order found in the CFN42
genome, and then inferred a consensus sequence and
computed the number of nucleotide differences across

windows of 250 bp. Using this procedure, we detected
the patterns of shared and unique (singleton) SNPs particular to each strain. As shown in Figure 4, we were
able to distinguish two classes of shared SNPs: biallelic
SNPs (Figure 4 gray smoothed areas), which showed
only one nucleotide difference with respect to the consensus; and polyallelic (Figure 4, white bars), which
showed multiple differences at the same nucleotide site
with respect to the consensus. Some of these SNP patterns were shared in some strains but not others. For
example, as shown in Figure 4, pattern A was shared by
strains CIAT652, CIAT894 and 8C-3, whereas pattern B
was found in strains GR56, IE4771 and Kim5. Further
shared patterns were identified through a careful inspection of the plot. In addition, a large number of polymorphisms were not shared, but instead appeared to be
strain-specific variants. Interestingly, strain CFN42 was
found to have the greatest number of differences with
respect to the consensus (Figure 4, black bars). Even
thought this approach is limited by the amount of common segments among the eight strains, we were able to
cover 3.7% (223) of the total gene content (5,963) of the

Figure 4 SNP distribution profiles. Alignments were performed on a total of 240 sequence segments available for all tested strains of
Rhizobium etli. Each nucleotide position in the alignment is represented by a consensus. In instances where half of the strains had the same
nucleotide and the other half a different nucleotide, the consensus was defined as the nucleotide present in R. etli CIAT652. Common segments
were concatenated according to the gene order found in the CFN42 genome (chromosome and after plasmids), yielding 71,630 aligned base
pairs. The numbers of nucleotides differing from the consensus are plotted as bars, across independent windows of 250 nucleotides. The black
bars (running downwards) show SNPs present in a single strain; the gray areas indicate when the same SNP pattern was present in at least two
strains at the same position within the alignment (patterns A and B); and the white bars indicate polymorphic sites where at least three alleles
were present in at least two strains, again within the alignment. Segments showing significant recombination events are indicated by bars at the
bottom of the plot, and with bars indicating the genomic location of segments with respect to CFN42 (chromosome, white; plasmids, black).

categories and subcategories (see Methods). For
instance, metabolism (transport and metabolism of
sugar, amino acids, and carbohydrates); cellular processes and signaling (envelope biogenesis, signal transduction); information storage and processing
(transcription, replication, and recombination); and
poorly characterized proteins (function unknown). A
detailed annotation of the gene segments can be seen in
additional file 2 Table S1.
Phylogenetic congruence

Since recombination can distort phylogenetic trees such
a way that no two individual trees are topologically
equivalent, we decided to perform phylogenetic reconstructions using a) a neighbor-joining network [31]; and
b) a comparison of a consensus tree with individual
trees constructed using the 187 segments common to
the eight studied R. etli genomes and R. leguminosarum
bv viciae 3841 (RLEG). The consensus trees obtained
from the concatenated alignments had identical topologies when constructed by maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and neighbor joining network methods (see
Methods). Only the tree based on neighbor joining network is shown in Figure 5. This tree was found to contain six internal branches (denoted by split numbers).
There are two main clusters in the tree, separated by
branches 2 and 3 that group the most closely related
strains: one containing KIM5, IE4771, and GR56
(branch 2) and another grouping BRASIL5, 8C3, and
CIAT652 (branch 3). These branches are internal in

relation to branch 5, which separates CFN42, CIAT894,
and RLEG that are the strains with the longest branches
(greatest number of nucleotide substitution per site). A
few inconsistencies were found among the topologies
recovered from reconstructions based on individual
gene segments (187), as compared to the topology of
the consensus tree (not shown). These alternative topologies are mainly due to the position of CIAT894 and
RLEG, whereas the splits 2, 3, and 5 where consistently
recovered. Thirty out of 187 trees supported the placement of RLEG as the most distant strain, 39 trees supported placement of CIAT894 as the external strain,
whereas the most frequent topology shows that these
strains are equally distant to the rest of strains (Figure
5). These alternative topologies could be the result of
shared ancestral polymorphisms, as suggested by the
long branches coupled with low frequency of recombination. Altogether, the phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that the levels of recombination were insufficient
to erase the phylogenetic signal, thus allowing for the
identification of the most probable strain tree. Consistent with this conclusion, only nine (3.75%) of the 223
gene segments common among the eight R. etli strains
(Figure 4) showed at least one recombination event.
Extent of recombination

To evaluate the extent of the probable recombination
events among strains of R. etli, we performed a recombination analysis in orthologous quartets (see Methods).
We aligned the shared gene segments from each draft
genome with the corresponding segments of the ORFs
from CFN42, CIAT652, and the R. leguminosarum bv
viciae 3841 complete genomes, yielding six different
groups of quartets (one group for each incomplete genome; Figure 6). The proportion of aligned segments varied across the six groups of quartets, from ~2,781
segments in the group containing BRASIL5, to ~3,672
in the group containing CIAT894. The segments ranged
from 200 to 4651 bp in length and covering approximately 50% of the genome (additional file 1 Table S2).
For each group of quartets, we performed four different
recombination tests (see Methods), and determined the
number of recombination events (only those that were
detected by at least two methods) for each quartet
(describe above) (Figure 6). The lowest proportions of
recombination events were detected for the quartets
containing strains BRASIL5 and 8C-3, which showed
4.42% (123 out 2781) and 3.57% (102 out 2854) recombination events, respectively. The other groups showed
approximately twice as many recombination events, with
frequencies ranging from 8.67% (KIM5 quartets) to
10.86% (GR56). In addition, for each group of recombinant quartets, we determined the number of events of
recombination between pairs of strains (Figure 6). In

each group is indicated at the left side of the diagrams. The percentages of recombinant quartets between pairs of strains are shown inside the
diagram and by dashed and continuous lines defined below the diagram. To facilitate searching each test strains o incomplete genome has its
own color.

general, recombination events were more frequently predicted between R. etli strains pairs than between any
given R. etli strain and R. leguminosarum bv viciae 3841
(Figure 6). For instance, in the group of quartets containing BRASIL5, the percentage of recombinant segments is about 7% in CFN42-RLEG, 5% in BRASIL5RLEG, and 20% in CIAT652-RLEG pairs, whereas
recombinant segments were detected more frequently
between pairs of R. etli strains: 18% (CFN42-BRASIL 5),
25% (CFN42-CIAT652), and 25% (CFN42-CIAT652).
The same pattern was seen for the other five groups of
quartets. This effect is because homologous recombination depends on a high nucleotide identify, and greater

divergence is associated with less homologous recombination [32]. Therefore, recombination might be more
frequent between strains (populations) that are closely
related. Indeed, we observed the same recombination
events in different groups of quartets (of different
strains), as indicated by a presence/absence matrix. In
general, the number of common recombination events
(small number of events) was related to the phylogenetic
proximity of the strains, for instance BRASIL5 and 8C-3
share the most recombination events in common (data
not shown).
To explore whether the recombination is particularly
acting on some classes of genes, we assigned the

Genetic diversity

Together the above-described data suggest that recombination may not be a major driver of genomic diversification in R. etli, but rather might have relatively limited
effects. To directly examine this point, we estimated the
mean nucleotide diversity per nucleotide site (π) for the
recombinant and non-recombinant gene segments of
each strain (Figure 7a). In general, recombinant segments showed higher π values than non-recombinant
segments. These differences were significant only for
strains CIAT894, GR56, IE4771 and KIM5 (Student’s ttest, p < 0.001), but the combined data for the π values
of the 240 recombinant and non-recombinant gene segments common to the eight strains showed the lowest π
values (0.06 on average). Although there was no significant difference between recombinant (red circles) and
non-recombinant segments (blue circles) with regard to
the regions common to all eight strains (Figure 7b),
most of the recombinant segments had higher-thanaverage π values and generally showed the highest transition/transversion ratios (indicated by the size of the
circles in Figure 7b). Since the probability of transitions
is higher than transversions [34], high ratios of transition/transversion suggest that they were under strong
purifying selection, because transitions at the third ‘wobble’ position are more likely to be synonymous than
transversions [35].

Discussion
In the present work, we used a genomic approach to
detect and measure variation in the form of SNPs, and
to analyze the contribution of recombination to the
genomic diversification of R. etli strains. Our results
demonstrated that draft genomic sequences samples
representing ~1× of the genome can be used to measure

classes annotated in the CFN42 genome are present in
the draft genomes but they are represented unevenly in
the recombinant segments. For instance, the categories:
amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate
transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, lipid transport and metabolism, general function
prediction only and function unknown appear overrepresented among the recombinant segments. In counterpart, some other categories like transcription and signal
transduction mechanisms are in lower frequency among
the recombinant segments than in CFN42. Even though
we performed a chi-square and Range tests [33] to
assess the significance of these differences, the incomplete nature of draft genomes does not allow to conclude about some bias toward recombination in certain
classes of genes.

variation at the whole-genome level in this species. In R.
etli we found a great amount of variation (more than
161,998 SNPs) when any draft genome was compared to
the complete genomes of CFN42 and CIAT652. To
assess the reliability of this method for identifying SNPs,
we quantified the SNPs in E. coli genomes at 1× and in
complete genomes assembled at about 10× coverage.
We found the same variation level using either draft or
complete E. coli genomes, indicating that draft genomes
produced estimations of DNA variability comparable to
those generated using complete genomes even at only

1× coverage. Richter and Roselló-Mora [10] previously
reported on the use of partial sequences representing
about 20% of the genomes of several bacterial species to
infer reliable values of DNA divergence between strains.
The authors of the prior paper showed that ANI values
obtained with these samples correlated well with the
DDH values, indicating that draft genome sequences are
an acceptable data source. At present, the rapid
improvement of DNA sequencing technology is allowing
researchers to use multiplex sequencing to simultaneously process an increasing number of genomic
sequences. These experiments will produce additional
draft genome sequences of different qualities, and the
approach proposed herein should prove useful for their
early analysis.
We identified a higher proportion of SNPs in R. etli
strains than in E. coli strains, and the differences
between the various R. etli strains and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae 3841 ranged from 7% to 11%
(median; additional file 1 Figure S2), with the latter figure corresponding to the CFN42 comparison. R. etli and
R. leguminosarum are different species according to 16S
comparison; however, they share a common genomic
core and are distinguished by variable accessory components (e.g., plasmids) [24,36,37]. Therefore, an ANV
range of 7-11% might be a good indicator of speciation
within Rhizobium. Despite of the variability in ANV
among the tested strains of R. etli (about 4-6%), none
had ANV values comparable to those obtained with
respect to R. leguminosarum. The levels of ANV were
higher for comparisons using CFN42 than those done
with CIAT652. For taxonomic purposes, CFN42 is the
type strain of R. etli [38]. In the present analysis, however, we found that CFN42 was the most differentiated
of the studied samples, had the highest proportion of
unique SNPs, and clustered as a divergent independent
branch when the strain phylogeny was explored. We
recently re-sequenced strain CFN42 using Solexa-Illumina technology and compared it with the former complete genome sequence. Very few indels and SNPs (less
than 20 SNPs) and no rearrangements were found.
Therefore, very small variation can be expected from an
in vitro lifestyle. In contrast, most of the strains analyzed were more closely related to CIAT652 than to
CFN42. A prior study noted that CIAT652 and CFN42
have a low ANI value (90.44%) [10] and suggested that
CIAT652 is improperly classified as R. etli. We previously showed that CFN42 and CIAT652 share a very
conserved symbiotic plasmid, but have high divergence
throughout the rest of their genomes [24]. Given that all
isolates of R. etli have been recovered from nitrogen-fixing bean nodules, this characteristic would be expected
to dominate the classification criteria. The genomic
divergence described herein is thus consistent with a

Page 9 of 13

model in which the species R. etli is composed of divergent genomic lineages that share the symbiotic phenotype conferred by the symbiotic plasmid [24], which is
called a common symbiovar [39]. Indeed, our analysis
suggests that in some instances, the use of type strains
could lead to misleading taxonomic classifications, especially when gene transfer mechanisms are active. R. etli
is known to have mobile elements such as conjugative
plasmids, insertion sequences and bacteriophages
[40-42]. Therefore, gene flow and recombination among
strains of R. etli might be important to the production
of genomic diversity, as reflected in its pangenomic
structure [24]. However, no prior study has assessed the
role of homologous recombination in promoting the
genomic diversity of R. etli. Earlier works using MLEE
or MLST concluded that R. etli populations are essentially clonal, with low recombination even in sympatric
populations [22,25,26,43]. More recently, Flores et al.
[44] showed that despite the high conservation of the
symbiotic plasmid pSym sequences from a collection of
different strains of R. etli, some regions shared identical
SNP distribution profiles. This observation was interpreted as evidence of homologous recombination. Here,
we obtained similar findings for a set of common genomic DNA segments, mainly chromosomal in origin,
belonging to eight strains of R. etli. Quantification of
probable recombination events and the extrapolation of
our findings to the whole genome suggested that a minimum of 260 recombination events had occurred in the
genome of each strain. Strains CFN42 and CIAT894
were the more variable in terms of SNPs, and the latter
also showed the most evidence for recombinant events
in our quartet analysis (within the orthologous segments). Even though there were some discrepancies
within the clades of the various phylogenetic trees we
generated, most of the trees were congruent with the
consensus tree. Moreover, although the estimated
recombination was correlated with genetic diversity (Figure 7a), it was low overall (3-10%). In comparison, the
whole-genome recombination estimates reported for
Rickettsia and Streptococcus were on the order of 1837% and 28%, respectively [45,46]. These data suggest
that only a minor fraction of the R. etli genome has
undergone recombination, which thus accounts for only
a low proportion of the polymorphism in this species.
In bacteria, the frequency of RecA-mediated homologous recombination depends on the level DNA identity,
and small DNA fragments are often introduced into the
cell via conjugation, transformation or transduction.
Consequently, only a fraction of the genome might be
targeted by recombination [47]. Several other factors
might account for the low recombination frequency
detected in the isolate of R. etli studied here. Among
them, the ample degree of divergence among the studied

Acosta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:305
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/305

R. etli strains, their distant geographical origins (USA,
México, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, and Spain) [24],
and the small number of sampled strains. Recently,
Bailly et al., reported a population genomics analysis of
sympatric strains of Sinorhizobium medicae [27]. They
found very low levels of polymorphism and recombination in the chromosome in comparison with the megaplasmids. Future studies using our methodology on R.
etli isolates from single sites could be used to improve
our understanding of how recombination impacts the
diversification of this species.

Conclusion
In summary, our results and the previous reports on R.
etli support a model in which the species is composed
of evolutionarily independent lineages that share a symbiotic phenotype but have low levels of recombination
among the various lineages. However, although genetic
barriers imposed by divergence or other barriers such as
geographical distance might preclude homologous
recombination among the strains, gene flow (e.g., by
plasmids and chromosomal islands) is an ongoing process that shapes the genomic and pangenomic structures
of R. etli.

were performed using the Dds2 program [48], which
produces ungapped alignments of fragments having
similarities greater than 80%. Each duplicated paired
alignment (i.e., segments for which paralogous existed in
the reference genome) was filtered using the reciprocal
best hits option of the Fil program [48] under the following parameter set: coverage > 60% with respect to a
reference gene and a percentage differential score cutoff
< 10%. When two alignments had the same coverage,
we selected the alignment with the higher score. Once
the results were filtered, we created a gapped alignment
using the Gap22 program [48] on segments for which
the identity was greater than 85%. Both sequences were
extracted using an ad hoc Perl script (homemade)
formed for each paired alignment. To avoid frameshifts,
we realigned each pair using cross-match [49] with the
following parameters: discrep_lists masklevel, 0; tags
gap_init, 3; gap_ext, 2; ins_gap_ext, 2; del_gap_ext, 2;
minmatch, 14; maxmatch, 14; max_group_size, 20; minscore, 30; bandwidth, 14; and indexwordsize, 10. Finally,
for each alignment, we determined the probability that a
site was polymorphic using the Polybayes program [50],
with the probability set at greater than 0.99 and a minimum Phred of Q45 [51,52].

Methods

Assessment of methodological accuracy at low coverage

Genomes used

To determine if differences in coverage among the studied strains affected the reliability of the variability estimations, we took readings representing ~1× sequence
coverages of seven E. coli genomes and complete-genome readings (about 10×) of the same genomes from
GenBank
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/)
and
assembled these readings using the Celera assembler
[53]. The above-described analysis was applied to both
the 1× and 10× coverage datasets, and the results were
compared using the Mann-Whitney and KolmogorovSmirnov tests [33]. The utilized E. coli draft genomes
were: 101-1 [GenBank:NZ_AAMK00000000], 53638
[GenBank:NZ_AAKB00000000], B171 [GenBank:
NZ_AAJX0000000],

[GenBank:

HS [GenBank:NC_009800], and O157_H7_ec4024 [GenBank:NZ_ABJT0000000]. The complete genome
sequence of E. coli K12 [GenBank:NC_000913] was used
as the reference.

Complete genome sequences were downloaded from GenBank as follows: for R. etli CFN42: chromosome [GenBank:NC_007761], and plasmids pCFN42a [GenBank:
NC_007762], pCFN42b [GenBank:NC_007763], pCFN4c
[GenBank:NC_007764], pCFN42d [GenBank:NC_004041],
pCFN42e [GenBank:NC_007765], and pCFN42f [GenBank:NC_007766]; for R. etli CIAT652: chromosome
[GenBank:NC010994], and plasmids pCIAT652a [GenBank:NC010998], pCIAT652b [GenBank:NC010996], and
pCIAT652c [GenBank:NC010994]; and for R. leguminosarum 3841: chromosome [GenBank:NC_008380], and
plasmids pRL7 [GenBank:NC_008382], pRL8 [GenBank:
NC_008383], pRL9 [GenBank:NC_008379], pRL10 [GenBank:NC_008381], pRL11 [GenBank:NC_008384], and
pRL12 [GenBank:NC_008378]. We also used reads and
contigs from the draft genomes of R. etli strains 8C-3
[GenBank:NZ_ABRA00000000], BRASIL5 [GenBank:
NZ_ABQZ00000000],
CIAT894

Determination of SNPs and pairwise nucleotide
differences

Paired alignments between the draft genomes (contigs)
and the ORFs from the genomes of CFN42 or CIAT652

Determination of triplets (homologous segments)

For the comparisons between all ORFs of the reference
genomes (both CFN42 and CIAT652 were used
throughout the work) and each incomplete genome (the
contigs), we obtained the coordinates of all homologous
segments (triplets) using the Mauve program [54]. Our
analysis was standardized by aligning p42F (CFN42)
against (R. leguminosarum bv viciae 3841) pRL12 using

Acosta et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:305
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/305

the following parameters: backbone-size = 100; maxbackbone-gap = 50; weight = 90; island-size = 100.
These plasmids were chosen because they contain
shared syntenic blocks [36]. Sequence extraction, realignment of each conserved segment (backbone) and
SNP determination were all performed as described
above (see determination of SNPs section).
Determination of quartets (orthologous segments)

To detect recombination events among DNA sequences,
at least four sequences are required for the analysis [55].
Here, we first identified SNPs that distinguished each
draft genome from the two reference genomes (CFN42
and CIAT652), and then determined the fragments that
were shared between each draft genome and the ORFs
from CFN42 and CIAT652, together with all replicons
of R. leguminosarum 3841 (chosen because of its extensive synteny with CFN42) [36]. Sharing was determined
using the Mauve program [54] (see determination of triplets section) and the shared fragments were realigned
with the Muscle program (default parameters) [56]. To
eliminate any large gaps within the alignments (rare in
orthologous fragments), we used the Gblocks program
under its default parameters [57].
Detection of recombination

A variety of methods for detection of recombination
have been reported in the literature [58], but no one
strategy performs optimally under all evolutionary scenarios [59]. Therefore, a reasonable approach is to
employ multiple methods and consider recombination
events predicted by at least two methods as being the
most reliable. Here, we used this strategy and considered recombination events that were detected by at least
two of the following four programs [46]:
A) Geneconv [60]: Using this program, we ran 100,000
simulations for each quartet with the following parameters chosen: Dumptab; Dumpjseq; Dumpfrag; Annotate;
WideCol;
ShowBlast;
Indel_blocs;
ShowBcPwKaPvals; SortGfragsBySeq; Show_maxmeansims; ShowUnal; Gscale = 1; ListPair; ListBest; Bcsims;
Allouter; Numsim = 100000/sp. This allowed us to
detect possible genetic conversion events.
B) Pist [61]: With this program, we first identified the
best-fit DNA substitution model for each shared fragment using the Akaike information criterion. We then
used the best model to reconstruct the phylogeny using
a maximum likelihood method (Phyml [62]) with 100
non-parametric bootstrap replicates. We next determined the invariant sites, alpha values, ts/tv ratios, base
frequencies, and constant sites using the PAML program
[63] and the GTR model. Finally, we ran Pist with the
REV model and 10,000 permutations. Pist uses

Page 11 of 13

parsimony-informative sites to detect recombination
events and is robust for highly divergent genes.
C) PhiPack [64]: We used the parameters of 10,000
permutations and a window size of 25 nt, and implemented the Pairwise Homoplasy Index, Maximum X2,
and the Neighbor Similarity Score.
D) Hyphy program [65]: We used the routine GARD,
which enables automated phylogenetic detection of
recombination. We employed the GTR model and betagamma rate variation.
To determine if a recombinant gene was present in
two different quartets or strains, we constructed a binary presence/absence matrix (1/0) for each gene that
was found in two or more strains. These profiles were
hierarchically clustered using the Cluster program [66].
Phylogenetic analysis

Regions shared among all strains of R. etli and R. leguminosarum bv viciae 3841 were identified using the
Mauve program [54], realigned by Muscle using the
default parameters [56], and filtered for long gaps with
Gblocks [57]. We then obtained the phylogeny of each
region using a maximum likelihood approach employed
by the Phyml program [62] (with 1,000 non-parametric
bootstrap replicates) and the best nucleotide substitution
model identified by the Akaike information criterion
[67,68]. We used three methods to construct the phylogeny from the concatenated dataset, in order to determine the species tree. The first was the RAxML
program (maximum likelihood) [69], in which we ran
the GTR nucleotide substitution model and a GAMMA
+P-Invar estimation of rate heterogeneity. This analysis
yielded a Maximum Likelihood ML estimate of the
alpha parameter and 1,000 distinct randomized Maximum Parsimony trees. The second program used was
Phyml (maximum likelihood) [62], running 1,000 nonparametric replicates and the GTRG model. Finally, we
employed the MrBayes program (Bayesian analysis) [70]
running the Nucmodel 4by4 for DNA. The number of
rate categories for the gamma distribution was set at
four, with an allowance for a proportion of invariable
sites. Because of the high computational burden, we performed two runs with four chains, for 500,000 generations in total. Trees were sampled every 500
generations, 25% of all samples were removed as reflecting burn-ins, and a consensus was obtained. Moreover,
to assess differences in topology among the probable
strain trees and individual gene trees, we used the Consel program [71], which calculated expected likelihood
weighting and performed the Shimodaira-Hasegawa SH
test [72]. Finally, a neighbor-net network was generated
using the concatenated sequences and the Splits tree4
program [31].

Nucleotide diversity and ts/tv ratios

For each shared fragment (quartet), we determined the
nucleotide diversity and segregating sites using R. leguminosarum 3841 as an outgroup and employing the libsequence library [73]. The transition/transversion ts/tv
ratios were determined for each quartet by using the
PAML program [63] and applying the best model of
nucleotide substitution obtained from each orthologous
segment (see determination of quartet).
Functional assignment

We used the COGs database [74] to undertake functional annotation across the four broad categories and
sub categories to shared regions (all strains) as well as
recombinant quartets. Quartets that had not been functionally assigned within the COG database were placed
in the “Poorly Characterized’’ category. For assignation
to a category, we used the reciprocal best hits technique
with an E-value < 1 × 10-7.
