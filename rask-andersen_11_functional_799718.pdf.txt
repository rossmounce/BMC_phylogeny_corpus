Abstract
Background: The Fat mass and obesity gene (FTO) has been identified through genome wide association studies
as an important genetic factor contributing to a higher body mass index (BMI). However, the molecular context in
which this effect is mediated has yet to be determined. We investigated the potential molecular network for FTO
by analyzing co-expression and protein-protein interaction databases, Coxpresdb and IntAct, as well as the
functional coupling predicting multi-source database, FunCoup. Hypothalamic expression of FTO-linked genes
defined with this bioinformatics approach was subsequently studied using quantitative real time-PCR in mouse
feeding models known to affect FTO expression.
Results: We identified several candidate genes for functional coupling to FTO through database studies and
selected nine for further study in animal models. We observed hypothalamic expression of Profilin 2 (Pfn2), cAMPdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta (Prkacb), Brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), neurotrophic
tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2 (Ntrk2), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), and Btbd12 to be
co-regulated in concert with Fto. Pfn2 and Prkacb have previously not been linked to feeding regulation.
Conclusions: Gene expression studies validate several candidates generated through database studies of possible
FTO-interactors. We speculate about a wider functional role for FTO in the context of current and recent findings,
such as in extracellular ligand-induced neuronal plasticity via NTRK2/BDNF, possibly via interaction with the
transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein b (C/EBPb).

Background
Genome-wide association studies consistently show that
fat mass and obesity-related gene (FTO) gene polymorphism is the strongest known genetic factor associated with the development of higher BMI and obesity
[1-5]. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in this gene have been linked with elevated BMI in various populations [3,6-12]. Recent studies have shown
that FTO risk alleles are preferentially transcribed in
heterozygote individuals, and this is facilitated by
increased binding of transcription factor CUX1 to the
regulatory elements in FTO intron 1 [13-15]. Transgenic
mice carrying additional copies of the Fto gene also

show an Fto expression-dependent body weight
response [16].
Data obtained in studies on Fto knockout and mutant
mice (FtoI367A) suggest that FTO is involved in energy
homeostasis, metabolism and adipogenesis [17].
Hypothalamic FTO is highly regulated in mouse and rat
feeding models [18,19]. However, our knowledge of the
molecular and physiological functions of FTO is still
very limited. The FTO protein has some structural similarities to canonical demethylase enzymes and its
demethylating activity has been demonstrated in vitro
[20]. Recent data suggest a role for FTO in co-regulation of transcription. Using a reporter assay, Wu et al.
were able to observe co-expression of FTO and
CCAAT-enhancer binding protein b (C/EBPb) to
increase expression of a reporter gene driven by a C/
EBP response element (CEBPRE). This element

contained three CpG-sites for methylation and additional analysis showed coexpression of FTO and C/
EBPb to partially attenuate the reduced reporter gene
expression induced by methylation of CEBPREs [21]. C/
EBPb can be termed an “early-response” transcription
factor, as it links extracellular signaling pathways to
gene regulation and long-term changes in the cell’s differentiation. It has been associated with a wide range of
functions, from adipogenesis and energy homeostasis
control to immune responses, neuroprotection, and
synaptic plasticity [22,23]. In line with that, dysregulation of FTO may lead not only to the impairment of
energy homeostasis, but also to other abnormalities,
including improper formation of neuronal networks. For
example, a rare loss-of-function mutation documented
in a Palestinian family showed that FTO deficiency leads
to growth retardation and severe developmental defects
of the central nervous system [24].
In order to determine a molecular mechanistic context
for FTO, we utilized information from co-expression-,
and protein-protein interaction databases and identified
nine candidate genes for functional coupling to FTO.
We then performed qRT-PCR expression analysis of
murine hypothalami to detect whether the network candidate genes were co-regulated with FTO in a feeding
restriction paradigm known to affect FTO expression in
a differential manner. We found changes in the expression of Pfn2, Prkacb and Bdnf to parallel FTO mRNA
upregulation during food deprivation. We also observed
co-regulation of Fto and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and its receptor TrkB (Ntrk2) in the sated
state, and of Fto and Btbd12, Pfn2 and Stat3 in the
food-deprived state.

Methods
Databases and gene interaction analysis

The FunCoup database (http://funcoup.sbc.su.se) predicts protein functional coupling through integration of
data from a number of high-throughput functional
assays. It uses information from 51 data sets containing
mRNA and protein co-expression, protein-protein interaction, subcellular colocalization, phylogenetic profile
similarity, shared transcription factor binding, shared
miRNA targeting and domain associations. The database
uses Bayesian statistics to predict the probability of functional coupling between two proteins and presents this as
a probabilistic confidence value pfc) ranging from 0 to 1
[25]. The Coxpresdb (coexpressed gene database) (http://
coxpresdb.jp) uses Affymetrix GeneChip array data
(Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 array and Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array) and presents interactions between
genes based on probe-to-probe expression pattern similarities and estimates the strength of the interaction by
combining the ranks of co-expression for the

Page 2 of 9

corresponding gene pair [26]. The protein-protein interaction database IntAct (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/main.
xhtml) collects data from protein-protein interaction
experiments, e.g. yeast two hybrid screenings and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The database allows submissions from independent research groups and currently encompasses data on approximately 200,000
protein-protein interactions in several species. IntAct
also contains links to the publications describing the
interactions [27]. Databases were queried in default settings with “FTO” as the search term. Human FTO interactions were queried in Funcoup and results for the
human FTO gene were selected in the Coxpresdb
database.
Mouse feeding models

In the gene expression analysis, we utilized the tissue
collected in the experiments described previously [19].
In short, male C57BL/6J mice (Scanbur, Sweden) were
housed individually or in groups of two in macrolon
cages with LD 12:12 (lights on at 07.00). Animals were
twelve weeks old at the beginning of the experiment.
Water and standard chow (Lactamin, Sweden) were
available ad libitum unless specified otherwise. All animal procedures were approved by the Uppsala Animal
Ethical Committee (ID: C228/7 & C262/7) and followed
the guidelines of Swedish legislation on animal experimentation (Animal Welfare Act SFS1998:56) and European Union legislation (Convention ETS123 and
Directive 86/609/EEC).
16-hr food deprivation

Chow was removed just before the onset of darkness
and mice were sacrificed 16 hours later. Control mice
had ad libitum access to chow. Each group contained 8
animals. Hypothalami were dissected and immersed in
RNAlater.
Ad libitum chow fed cohort

A larger group of ad libitum chow fed animals was used
to better study co-regulation of FTO with other genes.
10 group-housed mice had ad libitum access to chow
for 48 hours before sacrifice and dissection of
hypothalami.
Generation of cDNA and qRT-PCR

The tissue was kept in RNAlater at room temperature
for 2 h and then stored at -80°C until further processing. Tissues were homogenized by sonification (Branson sonifier B 15) and RNA was purified from the
samples using the TRIzol (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden)
method [28]. Samples were treated with Dnase I (Roche
Diagnostics, Scandinavia) to remove residual DNA contamination. DNA contamination after Dnase I treatment

Rask-Andersen et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:117

was checked with PCR. Complementary DNA, cDNA,
was then generated using reverse MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. PCR reactions were run in a
total volume of 20 ul using Taq polymerase (Biotools,
Sweden). Each reaction was performed in duplicate and
contained 75 mM Tris/HCL, 50 mM KCl and 20 mM
(NH 4)2 SO 4, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 0.25 mM dNTPs, 1:20
DMSO, 20 mU/ul Taq polymerase, 50 mM forward and
reverse primer and 1:4 SYBR-green (Invitrogen, Sweden). Reactions were run on iCycler temperature cyclers
and fluorescence was measured using MyiQ single color
real time PCR detection system. Data were analyzed
using iQ5 software (BioRad, Sweden). Gene expression
was normalized between the samples using the geometric mean of the most stable housekeeping genes, in
accordance with the geNorm-method as previously published by Vandesompele et al. [29].
Statistical analysis

D’agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test was used
to test normal distribution of gene expression data. Student’s t-test was used to test the difference in gene
expression between ad libitum chow fed, and food
restricted mice. Linear regression was used to determine
the relationship between expression of FTO and candidate genes. FTO was considered to correlate to candidate genes if the slope of the trendline significantly
deviated from zero. For all tests nominal p-values < 0.05

Page 3 of 9

were considered significant. The statistical analysis was
performed with Prism v5.02 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, California, USA, http://www.graphpad.com).

Results
Database analysis suggests several FTO-interaction
candidates

The FTO-interaction networks generated by Coxpresdb
and FunCoup are presented in Figure 1 and genes
selected for further analysis are presented in Table 1. A
cut-off pfc-value of 0.4 was selected to remove the
weakest interactions generated by the FunCoup database (see Figure 1a). The four genes with the highest
pfc-score were then selected for analysis in animal models (Table 1). Candidate genes in close proximity to
FTO in the network generated by Coxpresdb, were
selected for further analysis. The FLJ42393-transcript
was excluded from further analysis as it does not
encode a functional protein according to Ensembl. The
gene encoding neurolysin (NLN) was included instead
due to its high connectivity and proximity to several
candidate FTO interactors generated by this database
(Figure 1a). We were unsuccessful in generating primers
for the Aft7ip gene. The IntAct database generated only
one candidate gene, SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease subunit homolog (BTBD12). This interaction was
observed in an anti-tag co-immunoprecipitation experiment aimed at finding protein-protein interactions to
BTBD12 [30].

genome u133 plus 2.0 array and mouse genome 430 2.0 array) run on 3749 human and 2226 mouse samples [26]. The FunCoup database (b)
integrates heterogenous data from 51 unique datasets, containing information on mRNA co-expression, protein-protein interaction, sub-cellular
location etc., and uses Bayesian statistics to generate a probabilistic score for functional coupling between genes [25].

Feeding deprivation causes up-regulation of
hypothalamic Fto, Pfn2 and Prkacb as well as downregulation of Bdnf

Fto was significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus of
food-deprived mice (p = 0.0012) in good agreement
with previously published findings [18,19]. Several FTO
network interaction candidates were also regulated in
these mice (Figure 2). Pfn2 showed a twelve-fold
increase in expression (p = 0.0001). Prkacb was up-regulated as well (p = 0.0017). Bdnf, the ligand for Ntrk2,
was down-regulated in food-deprived mice (P = 0.04).
Ntrk2 and Stat3 showed a trend toward up-regulation,
however these differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 and p = 0.17, respectively). We also
observe hypothalamic expression levels of Pfn2, Stat3
and Btbd12 to correlate with Fto-expression in food
deprived mice but not in chow fed mice (see Figure 3).
Hypothalamic FTO is co-regulated with Ntrk2 and BDNF
in chow fed mice

In the cohort of 48 hour chow fed mice we observed the
expression of FTO to show a higher degree of variation
compared to chow fed animals in the 16 hour paradigm,
which is most likely due to larger individual differences
in food consumption. The variation in gene expression
was shown to follow a normal distribution. Analysis also
showed that Ntrk2-expression correlated positively to
expression of Fto (p = 0.0105) while Bdnf correlated
negatively (p = 0.0193) (see Figure 3 & Table 2).

Discussion
We identified nine candidate genes for functional coupling and interaction to FTO through database analysis

and previous publications. In order to test the validity of
this network, expression of network candidate genes was
analyzed in a food deprivation model known to induce
up-regulation of Fto. We confirmed increased levels of
Fto mRNA and observed simultaneous up-regulation of
four out of the nine genes in the hypothalamus during
food deprivation: Pfn2, Prkacb, TrkB and Stat3; as well
as down-regulation of Bdnf. Bdnf, Ntrk2 and Stat3 have
been previously implicated in the regulation of energy
homeostasis. Bdnf inhibits feeding and increases energy
expenditure when injected into the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMH) and paraventricular nucleus of
the hypothalamus (PVN) [31-34]. Stat3 is required for
the anorexic effect of leptin-receptor signalling in the
ARH [35]. Stat3 is also up-regulated in response to
overexpression of AAV injection-induced Fto overexpression in the arcuate nucleus [36]. However, two of
the genes, Prkacb and Pfn2, have not previously been
implicated in any feeding/obesity paradigms. Intriguingly, we observed the expression of Fto to correlate
with expression of Ntrk2 and Bdnf in the hypothalamus
of chow-fed mice (p = 0.019 and 0.011, respectively)
(Figure 3 & Table 2). We also observed a strong linearity between Fto expression and that of Ntrk2 and Bdnf
(R2 = 0.52 and 0.63, respectively) (Table 2).
The expression and co-regulation analysis provides
additional evidence for a functional coupling of FTO to
the network candidate genes and validates these databases in terms of co-expression [37,38]. From this viewpoint, FunCoup has provided the most valuable leads as
the genes it reports as candidates are shown not only to
be regulated during starvation in a similar way as Fto,
but also follows the expression of Fto in a linear fashion.

Fto is upregulated (see figure 2).

FTO has been shown to exhibit de-methylase activity
[20] with a putative role in epigenetic regulation of gene
expression. However, a recent study found evidence that
FTO increased binding of transcription factor CCAATenhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPb) to methylated
as well as de-methylated promoter sites. This study suggests a unique functional role for FTO: the enabling of
transcription factors to bypass methylation specific epigenetic control of gene expression [21]. Also of great
interest is that C/EBPb has been reported to mediate
the immediate early gene response induced by BDNF
signaling via NTRK2 [39], by acting as an inducible
transcription factor downstream of MAPK/ERK in the
NTRK2 signaling pathway. We have prepared a
hypothetical model for the involvement of FTO in the
BDNF-NTRK2 signaling pathway, which integrates our
data and previous findings on BDNF-NTRK2, FTO and
C/EBPb (Figure 4).
Based on our observations, we speculate that FTO
may affect the regulation of ligand-induced neuronal
plasticity via BDNF-NTRK2, PRKACB, STAT3 and
PFN2. BDNF is involved in neuronal survivability, differentiation and formation of memory [40] and has also
been associated to obesity in recent GWA-studies [41].
Pfn2-encoded profyllin 2 regulates important cellular
functions such as endocytosis, vesicle recycling and
actin assembly in CNS neurons [42]. Its effect on actin
turnover may indicate a function in the regulation of
neuronal plasticity in response to food intake. Neuronal
plasticity occurs e.g. in the arcuate nucleus (ARH) in
response to leptin signaling [43] and within the ARH -

The expression of genes in bold text are significantly correlated to expression of Fto (p < 0.05). Genes in cursive text were run on chow fed mice in the 16 hour
food restriction paradigm. Hypothalamic expression of Ntrk2 and Bdnf correlate to Fto-expression positively and negatively, respectively, in ad libitum chow fed
mice. Pfn2, Stat3 and Btbd12 were positively correlated to expression of Fto in hypothalami of 16 hour food restricted mice.

PVN pathways which develop during the perinatal period [44]. Interestingly, some FTO polymorphisms are
associated with lower brain volumes in the frontal and
occipital lobes [45]. As obesity itself is in some cases
also associated with lower brain volume as well as cognitive deficits [46], FTO may be one of the genes bridging body weight dysregulation and other physiological
abnormalities that oftentimes accompany abnormally
low or high body weight. PRKACB (cAMP-dependant
protein kinase catalytic subunit beta) encodes a catalytic
subunit isoform of the protein kinase A holoenzyme
(PKA). PRKACB phosphorylates the transcription factor,
cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB,
in turn, regulates expression of several genes, including
CEBPb, BDNF, NTRK2, NPY and the glucocorticoid
receptor. PRKACB has been linked to depression as
lower expression of PRKACB in the prefrontal cortex
occurs in major depression [47]. STAT3 is a transcription factor involved in cell growth, embryogenesis, apoptosis and cell motility. It is also one of the mediators of
leptin signaling and regulates the expression of appetite
regulators Agouti related peptide (AGRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) [48]. This again suggests the
potential role of Fto and its network of genes as a common molecular mechanism underlying co-regulation of
body weight and processes related to cognition.

Conclusions
We identified several candidate genes for functional
coupling to FTO through database analysis and validated these by expression studies in relevant feeding
models via qRT-PCR. Based on these findings, we
hypothesized about the molecular context of FTO, discussing a putative involvement in neuronal plasticity by
association to transcription factors downstream of ligand
activated signaling pathways such as BDNF/NTRK2.
These functional results provide new ideas for deducing
the mechanisms affected by obesity related FTO-risk
alleles.

Figure 4 In silico analysis and gene expression studies suggests functional coupling between FTO and the BDNF/NTRK2-signalling
pathway. Ablation of C/EBPs has been shown to reduce the expression of transcription factors Egr1, Egr2 (early growth response protein 1 and
2) and Fos (proto-oncogene c-Fos) following BDNF exposure in cultured neuronal cells [21,39] linking BDNF-NTRK2 to gene transcription via C/
EBPs. C/EBPb is a substrate for phosphorylation by MAPK, one of three downstream pathways of BDNF-NTRK2 signalling [49,50]. C/EBPs mediate
the immediate early gene response of NTRK2-signalling. Recent findings by Wu et al. suggest FTO to attenuate epigenetic control of gene
regulation via methylation of CpG-sites in C/EBPb response elements (CEBPREs) [21]. In silico analysis, as well as expression studies, point to a
functional coupling between FTO and the BDNF/NTRK2-signalling pathway, potentially mediated by the increased binding of C/EBPb methylated
response elements
