Abstract
Background: Although DNA sequence analysis is becoming a powerful tool for identifying
species, it is not easy to assess whether the observed genetic disparity corresponds to
reproductive isolation. Here, we compared the efficiency of biological species identification
between nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA sequences, focusing on an Asian endemic
perennial lineage of Mitella (Asimitellaria; Saxifragaceae). We performed artificial cross experiments
for 43 pairs of ten taxonomic species, and examined their F1 hybrid pollen fertility in vitro as a
quantitative measure of postzygotic reproductive isolation.
Results: A nonlinear, multiple regression analysis indicated that the nuclear ribosomal DNA
distances are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of F1 hybrid pollen fertility, and
supplementation with chloroplast DNA distance data does not improve the explanatory power.
Overall, with the exception of a recently diverged species complex with more than three biological
species, nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences successfully circumscribed ten distinct biological
species, of which two have not been described (and an additional one has not been regarded as a
distinct taxonomic species) to date.
Conclusion: We propose that nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences contribute to reliable
identification of reproductively isolated and cryptic species of Mitella. More comparable studies for
other plant groups are needed to generalize our findings to flowering plants.

Background
Plant systematics is one of the most active areas of biology
because of marked progress in molecular phylogenetics
during recent decades [1]. Many of the long-standing
enigmas regarding systematic positions of various taxonomic groups, for example, the relationships among gymnosperms, basal angiosperms, monocots, and dicots, have
been resolved, and overall agreement has now been

reached regarding circumscription of the major orders and
families, with current practical taxonomic systems now
following the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system [2,3] with little controversy. The number of research
articles on plant molecular phylogenetics has increased
markedly in recent years, focusing mainly on extending
studies to lower taxonomic groups. At the same time, the
rapid accumulation of DNA sequence data for phyloge-

netic studies has prompted recent endeavors to use them
for precise and efficient delineation of biodiversity (DNA
taxonomy [4,5]).
Many studies attempting to resolve plant evolutionary
relationships and/or to identify plant species using DNA
sequences have assumed that intraspecific genetic diversity is usually lower than interspecific genetic diversity
and that sequences derived from a species usually form a
monophyletic group. Consequently, sampling of a few
individuals (or even only one) is considered sufficient to
represent the genetic characteristic of the species. However, these assumptions are not thoroughly supported by
empirical data. For example, a recent survey of DNA
sequences of a nuclear-encoded gene in the Pinus subgenus Strobus indicated that 58% of the taxonomic species
studied did not form a monophyletic group [6]. These
authors also reported that many published studies that
include multiple accessions per taxonomic species failed
to reconstruct species monophyly for up to 100% of the
species examined. If such species non-monophyly is common among plants, any attempt at DNA-based
approaches for taxonomy would lose their relevance.
Moreover, the frequency of allelic non-monophyly
among plant biological species is not only methodologically but also conceptually crucial for our understanding
of plant speciation. Assuming that long-term maintenance of reproductively distinct species results in allelic
uniqueness of some, if not all, gene loci for each species,
this should directly lead to a classic debate on the nature
of plant species [7-10], because a species that cannot be
recognized genetically may not be a real entity (but see
[11]). Nevertheless, very little information is available
regarding whether a plant species can indeed be regularly
recognized as a genetically distinct group (e.g., only 17
studies are available [6]). More specifically, most of these
studies examining the correspondence between supported
clades in a phylogenetic tree and species rely heavily on
traditional taxonomic species circumscriptions, obscuring
whether such patterns of species non-monophyly, if
observed, can be attributed to true non-monophyly or
only to poor resolution of the present taxonomic system.
A more constructive approach to establish methodologies
for plant DNA taxonomy would be to find genetic markers
that are most likely to achieve species monophyly of the
group under study, because the probability of supporting
species monophyly should vary across markers and lineages in response to the marker-specific coalescence time
and lineage-specific life history traits. Importantly,
although many recent papers on plant DNA barcoding
have placed strong emphasis on the use of markers on the
chloroplast genome [12-15], the chloroplast genome constitutes a non-recombining, single linkage group so that
the differences among markers on the chloroplast genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/105

might be limited to differences in the amount of information or its resolution, but not to their accuracy.
Assuming that biological species are the entities that have
some, if not a complete, degree of reproductive isolation
from each other, such an ideal marker for species delimitation should also have the capacity to estimate the degree
of reproductive isolation among the plant individuals,
from which sequence data are available but species identities are unknown. Nevertheless, few studies have compared the relationship between genetic divergence and
reproductive isolation in plants. To our knowledge, only
three empirical studies (genus Glycine [Fabaceae], Silene
[Caryophyllaceae], and Streptanthus [Brassicaceae]) have
been published in which a general trend of correlation
between pre-/postzygotic reproductive isolation and
genetic distance was observed, and each of these studies
used only one measure of genetic distance (nuclear ribosomal ITS DNA sequences for the former two, and allozyme distance for the last [16]). In fact, no study has
compared the relationship of different gene loci to the
degree of reproductive isolation.
Here, we report that species within the Asian Mitella section Asimitellaria can mostly be recognized as a distinct,
monophyletic clade that exhibits reproductive isolation
(measured by sterility of pollen from F1 hybrids) based
on nuclear ribosomal external and internal transcribed
spacer (ETS and ITS) DNA sequences. In contrast, we
found that the relatively long sequence reads (> 1.5 kbp)
of the chloroplast psbA-trnH interspecific spacer plus the
matK gene, which are the most frequently used markers
for plant DNA barcoding, were much less effective for recognizing the biological species boundaries likely due to
natural hybridizations in Asimitellaria.
Asimitellaria is a monophyletic group of perennials that
diversified into more than ten species exclusively within
Japan and Taiwan, which enables comprehensive sampling of genetic diversity that presumably derived from a
single ancestor. All Asimitellaria species and varieties have
the same chromosome number (2n = 28), with very few
exceptions of intraspecific variations in chromosome
number, that is, some triploid plants of M. pauciflora in
the northernmost populations [17], implying that a complex polyploid formation has not been responsible for
speciation. By analyzing a comprehensive collection of
nuclear ribosomal ETS and ITS DNA sequences and the
chloroplast psbA-trnH spacer and matK gene DNA
sequences from samples of Asimitellaria plants throughout
their distribution range, we first examined if distinct genotypic clusters reflect species circumscription. Furthermore, we examined pollen fertility of 43 lines of
artificially crossed F1 hybrids to determine whether reproductive isolation occurs between species and how the

parental genetic distances are related to the observed
degrees of reproductive isolation. Furthermore, we determined whether the distinct cluster recognized by the
nucleotide sequence data corresponds to a distinct taxonomic or biological species. Finally, we discuss the utility
and limitations of these DNA sequences as identification
tools for plant species.

Methods
Study organisms
The genus Mitella section Asimitellaria (Saxifragales; Saxifragaceae in the APG system) is a monophyletic group of
perennials endemic to Japan and Taiwan. Nine species
and an additional two varieties endemic to Japan and one
species endemic to Taiwan have been described to date
[18]. We sampled 158 individuals of all ten Asimitellaria
species and two varieties throughout their distribution
range (Figure 1) for DNA sequencing, of which 17 individuals were only sequenced for nuclear ribosomal DNA
but not for chloroplast DNA because of sample loss. For
each species and variety, sequences from 2 to 20 populations encompassed the entire distribution range (Figure 2;
Additional file 1: Table S1). Nine other species of the
genus Mitella were used as outgroups, as they are clearly
not included in Asimitellaria [19]. Overall, 105, 150, and
116 individuals were newly sequenced for nuclear ribosomal DNA, chloroplast psbA-trnH, and matK, respectively,
whereas the remaining sequences were obtained from previous studies [19,20].

The plants used in the present study were either cultivated
at Tsukuba Botanical Garden, or deposited as voucher
specimens in the Kyoto University Herbarium (KYO).
Analyses of nucleotide sequences
Generally, DNA extraction and sequencing followed
methods described elsewhere [19,20]. A detailed description of the method is available in additional file 2. The
primer sequences used in the present study are listed in
Additional file 1: Table S2. The DNA sequences newly
generated in this study were deposited in DDBJ (National
Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) under accession
nos. AB492287–AB492762. The obtained sequences of
nuclear ribosomal ETS and ITS regions and the chloroplast matK gene were easily aligned manually, with very
few insertions/deletions (indels). In contrast, sequence
alignment of the chloroplast psbA-trnH spacer was less
straightforward. For example, an 8- to 26-base stretch of
poly-T sequences with very few other bases on the aligned
site 170–195 of the chloroplast psbA-trnH spacer was
impossible to align and therefore excluded from the data.
Moreover, a careful inspection revealed a 37-base inversion on the aligned site 100–136 of the chloroplast psbAtrnH spacer. We therefore excluded this region and instead
coded it as a single binary character with character states

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/105

inverted or non-inverted. The indels in the aligned matrix
were unambiguously coded as separate characters using
the methods described in Simmons and Ochoterena [21].
The 5.8S region that is flanked by the ITS-1 and ITS-2
regions was removed from the dataset, as this region is
missing in some of the sequences from previous studies.
Genetic distances between all pairs of plant individuals
were calculated separately with PAUP*4.0b10 [22] for
each of the nuclear and chloroplast DNA datasets, using
the Tamura-Nei + I + Γ model of nucleotide substitutions
(gamma shape = 0.8578, proportion of invariable sites =
0.3018) for the nuclear dataset, and the K81uf + Γ model
(gamma shape = 0.2834) for the chloroplast DNA dataset,
both of which were selected using ModelTest 3.7 [23]. The
relationship between all pairwise genetic distances calculated from each of nuclear and chloroplast dataset (hereafter referred to as nuclear genetic distance and
chloroplast genetic distance, respectively) were also examined. All statistical analyses were performed using the R
package version 2.7.0 [24] unless otherwise mentioned.
For cladistic grouping of collected nucleotide sequences,
maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ), and
Bayesian (Bayesian inference: BI) tree searches were performed using PAUP*4.0b10 for MP and NJ analyses and
MrBayes 3.1 [25] for BI. A heuristic search with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 100 additional sequence replicates, saving a maximum of 100 trees
per replicate, was used for the MP tree search, and a distance measure under the maximum likelihood settings
was used for the NJ tree search. To assess topological
uncertainty, bootstrapping (1000 and 10,000 replicates
for MP and NJ, respectively) was also performed, using the
same settings as in the original tree searches, except that
we reduced both the maximum tree number and additional sequence replicates to ten in the MP analysis. For
BI, the GTR + I + Γ base substitution model, F81 base substitution model, and GTR+ Γ base substitution model
were used with an uninformative prior for combined
nuclear ribosomal ETS and ITS, chloroplast psbA-trnH,
and chloroplast matK, respectively. The standard model
with equal rate variation among sites was used for indel
and inversion data. The nucleotide substitution models
for BI were selected using MrModelTest 2.2 [26]. Two
independent runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation were allowed for 1.2 or 2.2 million generations each (for nuclear and chloroplast datasets, respectively), with trees sampled every 1000 generations, to
achieve independence among samples. The likelihood
scores of the obtained trees were plotted to confirm that
the two independent runs reached virtually identical stationarity well before the first 201 or 1201 trees of each
run, which were discarded as burn-in. As a result, 2000
trees were retained, and a majority-rule consensus tree

constructed using these trees.
Examination of F1 hybrid fertility via artificial cross
experiments
To examine the presence of reproductive isolation among
and within the genotypic clusters identified from the ETS
and ITS sequence data, we performed artificial cross experiments using 55 individuals of ten Asimitellaria species
and two varieties collected from 26 populations. Specifically, because we observed genotypic clusters within each
of M. stylosa, M. japonica, and M. yoshinagae, we suspected
that these clusters may form distinct species, and therefore
examined the presence of hybrid sterility among these
clusters. We also checked for the presence of hybrid sterility among M. furusei, M. pauciflora, and M. koshiensis, as
this species complex could not be separated by genotypic
clustering, implying the need for assessment of concordance between taxonomic species and boundaries of biological species within the complex.

We used the pollen germination ratio of F1 hybrids for 43
combinations of crosses (corresponding to cross strain
nos. 10–52 listed in Table 1) as a measure of F1 hybrid fertility, because this measure was highly quantitative and
highly variable among the cross designs. The other measures, such as fruit/seed set of crossed plants and F1 plant
growth were generally high, with a few exceptions in
crosses between very distantly related species.
Just prior to flowering, potted plants used for the crosses
were transferred from the garden to growth chambers (NK
System, Osaka, Japan) from which potential pollinator
insects were excluded. Hermaphrodite flowers of maternal plants were emasculated before anthesis (this procedure was omitted for female flowers of several sexually
dimorphic species), and subsequently used for the cross.
A sufficient amount of pollen was applied onto the stigma
of an emasculated flower using a toothpick. Three to 5
weeks after the cross, mature seeds were collected from
these crossed fruits. The collected seeds were surface-steri-

lized for ~15 min with 0.04% TritonX-100 and sodium
hypochlorite solution (~0.05% chlorine) and then plated
onto sterilized nutrient agar in plastic Petri dishes. The
resultant seeds germinated normally within 3 weeks of
sowing. Two to 5 months after germination, the seedlings
were transplanted to pots filled with well-fertilized soil
and grown in the garden to examine their pollen viability
in the next flowering season (March-May). Pollen grains
were collected from each individual plant from just dehiscent anthers using a toothpick, and the pollen was scattered on a spot of liquid culture dropped onto a 1.5 cm ×
1.5-cm square 1% agar culture, optimized for Asimitellaria
pollen germination with 5% sucrose and 5.0 × 10-3%
boric acid. After a 24-h incubation at 25°C in a humid
plastic case, the agar culture with pollen grains was fixed
with 3:1 ethanol: acetic acid, stained with 0.1% aniline
blue for > 5 h, washed with 1% acetic acid, and dried to
prepare microscope slides. For each slide specimen, 100
pollen grains were chosen at random to assess their germination ability under a binocular microscope, and the
count was used as the measure of fertility for each individual plant. Accordingly, 1–19 individual measures of fertility were obtained for each of 43 intra- and interspecific
cross strains. In addition, two to eight wild-collected individuals from each of nine Asimitellaria species were used
to confirm their high pollen germination ability under
our experimental conditions. To maximize the number of
cross designs within limited time and space, we conducted the cross within a genotypic cluster as a control
only in clade C, and instead used the measures of fertility
for the wild-collected individuals originating presumably
from spontaneous crosses within each genotypic cluster.
The average pollen fertility was calculated for each of the
43 crossed strains and the nine wild-collected species. The
artificially crossed strains within each of clades A-C
observed in nuclear DNA phylogeny (Figure 3) with more

than five individual plants were examined statistically for
any reduction in hybrid fertility, compared to pollen fertility of corresponding wild-collected species using the
Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. The
crossed strains across the clades were always nearly or
completely sterile (Table 1); thus we did not assess these
statistically for fertility reduction.
We further examined the correlations between genetic distance of parental plant individuals and their F1 hybrid fertility by plotting the results of the artificial cross
experiments with parental nuclear or chloroplast genetic
distances of the crossed lines. Genetic distance was simply
calculated using the DNA sequences of parental individuals when available, whereas in several cases, a different
plant individual of the same geographic origin was used as
the representative of the accidentally lost plant used for
the cross, as the intraspecific sequence divergence within
a single population was always negligible (< 0.001 for
chloroplast DNA and < 0.002 for nuclear DNA). For wildcollected plants and the intraspecific cross of plants from
the same population (strain ID nos. 1–9, 15 in Table 1),
their parental genetic distances were regarded as zero to
discriminate them from the intraspecific cross of plants
from different populations. A multiple regression analysis
using a generalized additive model with smoothing
splines was performed using each of the nuclear and chloroplast genetic distances as the independent variable and
F1 hybrid pollen fertility as the dependent variable, applying the gam and smooth.spline function of the R package.
An optimal regression model was selected by comparing
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values for all possible models, whereby nuclear and chloroplast genetic
distance terms as well as their interaction term were incorporated in the full model.

Results
The numbers of sites in the aligned data matrices of
nuclear ribosomal ETS, ITS-1, ITS-2, and indels were 453,
276, 224, and 30, of which 84, 68, 47, and 24 were parsimony-informative, respectively, whereas those of psbAtrnH, matK, and indels (and an inversion) were 500, 1164,
and 15, of which 28, 48, and 11 were parsimony-informative, respectively. Statistical summaries of genetic diversity observed within taxonomic species and varieties of
Asimitellaria are listed in Table 2. Because chloroplast
genetic distances in Asimitellaria were found to have very
different information from that of the nuclear genetic distance, we regarded the nuclear and chloroplast DNA
sequence data as different sources of information, and
analyzed each separately.
Cladistic grouping of the nuclear ribosomal DNA
sequences using MP, NJ, and BI all resulted in nearly identical topology, subdividing the entire ingroup into three
subclades, A-C, in which two to five distinct genotypic
clusters were consistently recognized (Figure 3). In total,
at least 11 distinct subclades were found within Asimitellaria (Figure 3), and the identified clades were not largely
incongruent with the present taxonomic system. Mitella
koshiensis, M. stylosa, M. kiusiana, M. doiana, and M. formosana were always supported to be monophyletic, with
moderate to high MP (65–100%) and NJ (76–100%)
bootstrap values and high Bayesian posterior probability
(> 93%). The monophyly of M. acerina was not supported
by BI, although this was apparently due to genetic introgression of ITS sequences with sympatric M. furusei var.
subramosa, which has been reported previously [20].
Intriguingly, as expected from the excess of their intraspecific genetic diversity (Table 2), none of the four taxo-

nomic species, M. pauciflora, M. furusei, M. japonica, or M.
yoshinagae, formed a monophyletic group, with the former
two species forming an inseparable clade together with M.
koshiensis, whereas M. japonica and M. yoshinagae were
each composed of two non-sister clades with very high
nodal support (> 97%; Figure 3). In addition, M. stylosa
was further subdivided into two strongly supported
(100%/100%/100% and 76%/74%/100% in MP, NJ, and
BI, respectively) monophyletic clades, with each corresponding to the two taxonomic varieties, M. stylosa var.
stylosa and M. stylosa var. makinoi.
The pairs of two distinct clades found within both M.
japonica and M. yoshinagae have not been recognized previously, but careful reexamination of morphological characters found some support for these clusters from the
morphology of petal and leaf surface structure (Figure 3).
The measure of F1 hybrid sterility by artificial crossing
experiments revealed the presence of clear reproductive
barriers between the clusters. The cross between M.
japonica individuals of the same genotypic cluster (Kyushu
and Shikoku populations), each collected from geographically well isolated (279–335 km) populations, showed
little hybrid sterility (Figure 4, Table 1, strain nos.16 and
17). Therefore, the significant reduction in pollen fertility
in the F1 hybrids resulting from the inter-genotypic
crosses cannot be explained by ordinary isolation by distance within a single species, whereby a gradual decrease
in hybrid fertility is expected, but by an incompatibility
between reproductively isolated, discontinuous species.
Similarly, the two genotypic clusters observed in M. stylosa, corresponding to the taxonomic varieties M. stylosa
var. stylosa and M. stylosa var. makinoi, would be two distinct species, as a significant reduction in hybrid fertility

between them was observed. An exception is the species
complex of M. koshiensis, M. furusei, and M. pauciflora
(henceforth referred to as M. pauciflora complex), in
which fairly large genetic variations were observed. Nevertheless, each of the three taxonomic species cannot be recognized as a distinct genotypic cluster.
Surprisingly, we found that the genetic information from
chloroplast DNA sequences was very different from that
from nuclear ETS and ITS DNAs in Asimitellaria. As shown
in Figure 5, less nucleotide divergence in chloroplast DNA
did not necessarily coincide with less divergence in ETS

and ITS, and vice versa. In addition, unlike the nuclear ETS
and ITS data, very few genotypic clusters that potentially
correspond to species were found in chloroplast DNA.
Actually, eight out of ten taxonomic species in Asimitellaria were recovered to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic in
the chloroplast DNA data (e.g., subclades D1, E1, and E2
in Figure 6), although none of these groupings was supported morphologically. Only M. formosana and M. doiana, both of which are strictly allopatric with other
Asimitellaria species, each formed an exclusively monophyletic group, although the nodal support for the M. formosana clade was weak (Figure 6). This pattern is

consistent with our previous finding that chloroplast
DNA in Asimitellaria is highly sensitive to rare interspecific
gene flow [20]. This finding is further supported by the
fact that the pattern of F1 hybrid pollen sterility expected
from chloroplast genetic distances (Figure 7a; deviance
explained = 52.8%) fitted the data much less compared to
that from nuclear genetic distances (Figure 7b; deviance
explained = 88.5%), and multiple regression analysis
indicated that only the nuclear genetic distances are necessary and sufficient to explain the observed pattern of F1
hybrid pollen fertility (the AIC value for the optimal
model was -64.04, whereas that for the full model was 63.62).

Discussion
The relationships among genetic divergence, postzygotic
isolation, and taxonomic species boundaries in Asian
Mitella, and their implications for DNA taxonomy
A rapidly evolving endeavor in recent taxonomy is to utilize DNA sequences for precise and efficient delineation
of biodiversity [5], but the information regarding how
observed genetic disparity corresponds to reproductive
isolation has been critically lacking. In the present study,
we have comprehensively illustrated the relationships
among genetic divergence, postzygotic reproductive isolation, and taxonomic species boundaries using Asimitellaria as a model group. In Asimitellaria, we found that the
degree of postzygotic reproductive isolation correlates

consistently with genetic distance measured by nuclear
ribosomal DNA only (Figure 7).
Consequently, the distinct subclades observed in the phylogeny (Figure 3) each corresponded to a distinct biological species, with the cross among which always result in at
least 39% fertility reduction compared to the cross within
the subclades (Table 1, Figure 4). Furthermore, we found
that the genotypic clustering based on nuclear ribosomal
DNA distance was mostly concordant with a morphologybased system (Figure 3). These findings have several significant implications for application of DNA taxonomy in
flowering plants. Together with the previous finding in
other three genera (Glycine, Silene, and Strepthanthus [16]),
now we have a strong evidence to assume that in general
the degree of postzygotic reproductive isolation well correlates with genetic distance (note here we assume no
polyploidy, although it is undoubtedly a major factor generating reproductive isolation in plants). Nevertheless, the
goodness of correlation can vary largely among genetic
markers used for the distance measure, and thus careful
examination is necessary to determine which marker
should be chosen. In the marker choice for DNA taxonomy, comparing the relative goodness of fit to a morphology-based system might be very helpful; in the case of
Asimitellaria, the marker that fit better to the pattern of
reproductive isolation also fit better to the morphologybased system. Accordingly, in the case when artificial cross
experiments are impractical, it would be a good practice
for researchers to compare multiple, unlinked markers
such as chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA for
goodness of fit to the morphology-based system of the
plant group under study.
We would note, however, that the postzygotic reproductive isolation measured by pollen fertility in the present
study is only a very small fraction of reproductive isolation that exists in nature. It is suggested that the prezygotic
isolation has more important role in keeping different
species genetically distinct in both plants and animals
[27]. Whether the degree of prezygotic reproductive isolation correlates consistently with genetic distance is not
clear because prezygotic isolation involves many adaptive
traits such as flowering time, pollinator difference, and
floral morphology, which can be direct targets of natural
selection [28]. Nevertheless, the general trend of strong
correlations between genetic distance measured with a
specific genetic marker and postzygotic reproductive isolation can be used (after the choice of appropriate markers) as a strong basis for regarding that phylogenetically
supported distinct clusters can be used for a minimum
assessment of biological species diversity.
Surprisingly, until now, limited examples of cryptic species within higher plants, including angiosperms, have

been reported [29-32]. This may suggest that cryptic species are less frequent in flowering plants because the morphology-based taxonomic system is highly reliable;
however, there have been too few empirical studies to
make conclusive inferences regarding the prevalence of
cryptic species within flowering plants. Nevertheless, considering the present findings of at least three cryptic species present within Asimitellaria, a relatively taxonomically
well examined lineage with regard to comparative morphology, embryology, and cytology (e.g., [17,33,34]), it is
likely that many angiosperm lineages contain at least
some cryptic species (see also [30], who reported cryptic
species diversity of the genus Draba in the Arctic region).
Thus, the establishment of a concrete framework for DNA
taxonomy would be valuable to unravel cryptic diversity
of flowering plants.
Utility and limitations of nuclear ribosomal DNA
sequences for delimiting species
In the present study, genotypic clustering using nuclear
ribosomal ETS and ITS sequences was shown to be fairly
successful for delimiting biological species of Asimitellaria
(ten of 11 clusters corresponded to distinct biological species), except for the M. pauciflora complex. This good correspondence was achieved from low intraspecific
sequence diversity and consistent sequence monophyly
for each biological species, in addition to the high overall

variability of the sequences, an essential prerequisite for
DNA taxonomy. It is noteworthy that recent plant DNA
barcoding studies have suggested the potential utility of
ITS regions for identifying plant taxonomic species, partly
because it is the most frequently sequenced locus in plant
phylogenetic studies. Importantly, Kress and colleagues
found the highest interspecific sequence divergence of ITS
among ten genetic markers tested [35], and Chase and colleagues reported a high probability (93.21%) of assigning
taxonomic species using the ITS-1 region as a BLAST query
sequence against GenBank [36]. However, in addition to
these previously suggested advantages of ITS, it is especially important to achieve consistent species monophyly
(each clade or genotypic cluster corresponding to one species) to be useful for species recognition and identification. Accordingly, the identifier loci are required to have a
relatively short coalescence time. This may be the case in
ETS and ITS regions because, unlike other nuclear loci, the
sequence homogeneity within a genome is strongly maintained by concerted evolution [20,37,38]. Note that Asimitellaria is a paleotetraploid lineage (2n = 28), which has
double chromosome number compared to most of the
remaining species of Mitella and its allies (Heuchera group;
mostly 2n = 14). Therefore, even the case in which ribosomal DNAs are likely located in multiple chromosome
blocks, each of the species can be recognized consistently
as a monophyletic group because of concerted evolution

process comparable to those of diploids (see also [37,38],
in which clear evidence for rapid concerted evolution
among different chromosomal locations is reported).
Another ideal property of potential loci for plant species
delimitation is their robustness for genetic introgression
via interspecific hybridization, as plant species with morphological and/or ecological distinctiveness are often
reported to have intensive gene exchange (e.g., [39]). It is
theoretically predicted that the loci under divergent selection and those linked to hybrid incompatibility are
unlikely to introgress across species [40], but it is usually
very difficult to find such loci for many non-model plant
lineages. The nuclear ribosomal gene is an exception, as in
most eukaryotic genomes, including those of flowering
plants, whereby the physical locations of highly repetitive,
nuclear ribosomal gene clusters are confined within telomeric regions (e.g., [41,42]; the physical locations of
ribosomal RNA genes for various model organisms are
also available in the MapViewer at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) where recombination is presumably suppressed [43,44]. Importantly, in a recent
genome-wide survey of genetic differentiation between
frequently hybridizing, sympatric sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris, Yatabe and colleagues
found that the chromosomal segments that differentiated
these species are usually very small (even undetectable in
sunflowers) except for the regions neighboring chromosomal breakpoints [39]. Consequently, it is possible that
the ribosomal ETS and ITS sequences, which are located
near the chromosomal breakpoints, remain distinct under
a substantial degree of interspecific genetic introgression,
as in the case of Asimitellaria [20].
Taken together, we propose that the ETS and ITS regions
are the most promising currently available candidate
markers for DNA taxonomy of flowering plants, with presumably short coalescent times and robustness against
introgressive hybridization [20]; note, however, that there
have been several reports of interspecific gene flow in the
ITS regions [45,46]. Even in Asimitellaria, there is a clear
example of interspecific gene flow in ITS region (but not
in ETS) between M. acerina and M. furuei var. subramosa
[20]. Therefore, it is worth testing in Asimitellaria and
other plant lineages whether nuclear ribosomal DNA is
indeed more robust against interspecific gene flow compared to other loci such as protein-coding nuclear genes.
Of course, in either case, it would be better to keep in
mind that there is unlikely to be any genetic markers free
of interspecific gene flow, which is always a major challenge in plant taxonomy.
Moreover, in some cases, another caution is needed for
use of the ETS and ITS because there are non-negligible
numbers of reports for the presence of multiple divergent
paralogs of ribosomal DNA in a single genome [47-49],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/105

which makes it impossible to compare orthologous
sequences among individuals, an essential step for DNA
taxonomy. Such a problematic nature of ribosomal DNA
for plant DNA taxonomy might be more general phenomenon, considering even reporting bias might be present
for the plant group in which ribosomal DNAs cannot be
sequenced directly in a simple manner as in Asimitellaria.
Also note that even our genotypic clustering approach
failed to recognize the three taxonomic species within the
M. pauciflora complex (Figure 3), especially to discriminate between M. furusei and M. pauciflora (M. koshiensis
could be recognized with a species-specific sequence
nested within the complex in the phylogenetic tree). This
does not mean that the complex should be grouped as a
single biological species, as the phenotypic discontinuity
among the three taxonomic species is obvious ([17,18];
Figure 3), and M. furusei and M. pauciflora co-occur in
many populations and have very distinct life history traits,
including flowering phenology, pollinator species, and
modes of reproduction [19,50]. In addition, the artificial
cross experiments within the M. pauciflora complex (Figure 4) also supported the conclusion that the three taxonomic species are reproductively isolated. Even the cross
between genetically divergent populations of M. furusei
var. subramosa was found to result in strong hybrid sterility
(< 10% pollen fertility; strain ID nos. 12 and 13 in Figure
4). Therefore, it is clear that the species complex comprises more than three biological species, although clarifying a comprehensive pattern of reproductive isolation
within the M. pauciflora complex is beyond the scope of
the present study. The divergence between M. furusei and
M. pauciflora appears to have occurred very recently compared to other speciation events outside the M. pauciflora
complex, and this observation probably indicates limitation to the sole use of ETS and ITS sequences for recognizing plant biological species that have undergone recent
speciation. Accordingly, it is expected that a recently radiated plant lineage would be most difficult for biological
species recognition based on ETS and ITS sequences, even
if sequence variations are present, as in the case of the M.
pauciflora complex. At present, there is no conventional,
DNA-based methodology for recognizing these recently
diverged biological species (amplified fragment length
polymorphism-PCR may be a candidate, although this
method is fairly labor-intensive; e.g., [51,52]). A recent
simulation-based study suggested that sampling of a moderate number (up to ten) of loci could correctly delimit
recently diverged biological species with a coalescent theory-based approach, even without relying on their reciprocal monophyly [53]. Thus, there is no doubt that adding
the data from different loci would result in more precise
delimitation of biological species, including those that
have differentiated recently, although the cost and effort
would also increase substantially.

Conclusion

Acknowledgements

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
links quantitative measures of postzygotic reproductive isolation to genetic distinctness observed in an angiosperm
lineage. We showed that with appropriate selection of
genetic markers, most reproductively isolated species of
Asimitellaria could be recognized as distinct genotypic clusters. With only the present results being available, however,
we could not conclude whether the low efficiency of biological species recognition using chloroplast DNA is a general trend in flowering plants. It is widely appreciated that
chloroplast DNA has a general advantage of the availability
of nearly universal primers that are applicable to entire
flowering plants, and less risk of sampling multiple copies
from one plant individual, which in turn is one of the
major obstacles in using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences
[47-49]. Nevertheless, extensive introgression of chloroplast DNA via interspecific hybridization is a well-known
and frequently reported phenomenon not restricted to
Asimitellaria (e.g., [54-57]; older examples are reviewed in
[58]). Therefore, it would be necessary to reassess how
common chloroplast DNA introgression is among flowering plants, especially after sampling a sufficient number of
individuals for each taxonomic or biological species. Also,
it might be helpful to compare the use of nuclear ribosomal
and chloroplast DNA in plant lineages without chloroplast
DNA introgression. Further attempts at DNA taxonomy in
plant lineages with various life history traits (annuals, perennials, trees, aquatics) and evolutionary backgrounds
(recent and old radiations, oceanic island endemics) are
required to generalize the utility of ETS and ITS for accurate
and efficient delimitation of plant biological species.
