Abstract
Recently, Imjin virus (MJNV), a genetically distinct hantavirus, was isolated from lung tissues of the Ussuri whitetoothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) captured near the demilitarized zone in the Republic of Korea. To clarify the
genetic diversity of MJNV, partial M- and L-segment sequences were amplified from lung tissues of 12 of 37
(32.4%) anti-MJNV IgG antibody-positive Ussuri white-toothed shrews captured between 2004 and 2010. A
531-nucleotide region of the M segment (coordinates 2,255 to 2,785) revealed that the 12 MJNV strains differed by
0-12.2% and 0-2.3% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. A similar degree of nucleotide (0.2-11.9%)
and amino acid (0-3.8%) difference was found in a 632-nucleotide length of the L segment (coordinates 962 to
1,593) of nine MJNV strains. Phylogenetic analyses, based on the partial M and L segments of MJNV strains
generated by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods, showed geographic-specific clustering, akin
to the phylogeography of rodent-borne hantaviruses.
Findings
Genetically distinct hantaviruses have been discovered
recently in several species of shrews (Order Soricomorpha, Family Soricidae) across four continents, including
the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus) [1],
Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) [2],
Therese’s shrew (Crocidura theresae) [3], masked shrew
(Sorex cinereus) [4], dusky shrew (Sorex monticolus) [4],
northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) [5] and
flat-skulled shrew (Sorex roboratus) [6]. Also, a novel hantavirus, named Imjin virus (MJNV), has been isolated from
tissues of the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura
lasiura) captured in the Republic of Korea [7]. As demonstrated recently, Seewis virus (SWSV) harbored by the
Eurasian common shrew throughout its broad geographic
range exhibits geographic-specific genetic variation, similar
to the phylogeography of rodent-borne hantaviruses [8,9].

the prevalence of Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in

striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) populations near
the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Korea, provided an
opportunity to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeography of MJNV in the crocidurine shrew species
reservoir.
A total of 466 Ussuri white-toothed shrews were live
caught in multiple sites, located 30 to 370 kilometers
from Seoul, during March 2004 to May 2010 (Figure 1):
Paju City, Yeoncheon-gun, Pocheon City, Dongducheon
City, Yangpyeong-gun, Osan City, Suwon City and
Pyeongtaek City in Gyeonggi province; Sincheorwongun and Pyeongchang-gun in Gangwon province;
Gunsan City in Jeollabuk province; and Haenam-gun in
Jeollanam province [10-12]. Sera collected from
C. lasiura were initially diluted 1:32 in phosphate buffered saline and examined for IgG antibodies against
MJNV, using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody
(IFA) test [7]. In the absence of a crocidurine shrew species-specific secondary antibody, an equal mixture of
fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse
and rat IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH)
was employed.

Figure 1 Map of Paju City, Yeoncheon County, and Pocheon
City near the DMZ, showing the locations of the trap sites in
Gyeonggi province. MJNV RT-PCR-positive Ussuri shrews (boxes)
were trapped in three cities and/or counties (gun), in the Republic
of Korea during 2004-2010.

Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues of antiMJNV IgG antibody-positive shrews, using the RNABee™ isolation kit (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood,
TX), and reverse transcribed, using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and a universal
primer (OSM55: 5’-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3’). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 50-μL
mixtures, containing 200 μM dNTP, 0.5 U of SuperTherm Taq DNA polymerase (JMR Holdings, London,
UK), 1 μg of cDNA and 5 pM of each primer. Oligonucleotide primer sequences for nested PCR were
MJN-M2235F: 5’-CATGGAAGAGTGCAACATGT-3’
and MJN-M2855R: 5’-TATGGTCCCTAGATGTACT3’, MJV-M2235F and MJN-M2805R: 5’-TCTATAAT
AGGATCAGTCAT-3’ for the M segment; MJN-L942F:
5’-TCAGAATATAAACCTATGAC-3’ MJN-L1636R: 5’GATCAACAAACCCATATC-3’, then MJN-L942F and
MJN-L1612R: 5’-CTTACATGAGCAGTGGCTA-3’ for
the L segment. Initial denaturation was at 94°C for
5 min, followed by 15 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 40 sec, annealing at 50°C for 40 sec, elongation at
72°C for 1 min, then 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 40 sec, annealing at 52°C for 40 sec and elongation
at 72°C for 1 min, in a Mastercycler ep gradient S
(Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany).
PCR products were purified by the QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and
DNA sequencing was performed in both directions of
each PCR product, using the Big-Dye® Terminator v3.1
cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) on an automated sequencer (Model 3730, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) [1,13]. For phylogenetic
analysis, the neighbor-joining (N-J), maximum likelihood

Page 2 of 6

and MrBayes methods were employed [14]. Genetic distances were computed by PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis
Using Parsimony, version 4.0b), and topologies were
evaluated by bootstrap analysis of 1,000 iterations [14].
Host identification of shrews infected with MJNV was
confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using
previously described universal primers [7,15].
Sera from 37 of 466 (7.9%) Ussuri white-toothed
shrews contained IgG antibodies against MJNV by the
IFA test (Table 1). Of 242 male and 224 female Ussuri
shrews, anti-MJNV IgG antibodies were found in sera of
20 males (8.3%) and 17 females (7.5%). Infection rates in
shrews from the northern part of Gyeonggi province
(Paju City: 10.7%, 6/56; Yeoncheon-gun: 19.4%, 14/72;
Pocheon City: 6.9%, 9/130) were higher than rates in the
southern part (Yangpyeong-gun: 0%, 0/1; Osan City: 0%,
0/2; Suwon City: 0%, 0/1; and Pyeongtaek City: 4.5%,
8/179). No seropositive shrews were captured in Sincheorwon-gun (0%, 0/7) and Pyeongchang-gun (0%, 0/1)
in Gangwon province; Gunsan City (0%, 0/2) in Jeollabuk province; and Haenam-gun (0%, 0/10) in Jeollanam
province.
Of the 37 anti-MJNV IgG antibody-positive Ussuri
shrews, MJNV RNA was detected in 12 (nine males and
three females) by RT-PCR. This difference in genderspecific prevalence was not statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.09), possibly because of the small
sample size of infected shrews. However, the higher
proportion of MJNV RNA-positive male shrews was
reminiscent of the over-representation of hantavirus
infection in male Norway rats [16], male deer mice
[17,18], and male marsh rice rats [19].
All 12 MJNV strains were detected in shrews captured
in Gyeonggi province: five in Paju City (04-3, 05-10,
05-11, 09-3, 10-8), three in Yeoncheon-gun (04-39,
04-55, 05-14), three in Pocheon City (05-8, 09-21, 09136), and one in Pyeongtaek City (08-29) (Figure 1,
Table 2). Prevalence of MJNV infection, as determined
by IFA and RT-PCR, was highest during the summer
and spring, respectively (Figure 2), but only a few shrews

were captured during the summer compared to other
seasons.
Overall genetic analysis of a 531-nucleotide region
(coordinates 2,255 to 2,785) of the Gc glycoprotein-encoding M segment revealed that MJNV strains from Korea
differed by 0-12.2%. However, the amino acid sequences
were highly conserved (0-2.3%) (Table 3). This degree of
genetic diversity was higher than that of HTNV strains
among striped field mice in Korea [20]. In a 632-nucleotide region of the L segment (coordinates 962 to 1,593),
MJNV strains differed by 0.2-11.9% and 0-3.8% at the
nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively (Table 4).
This level of interstrain difference for the MJNV L segment was similar with that of SWSV strains in Eurasian
common shrews from Russia [9]. The genetic distance
between MJNV strains and other crocidurine and soricine
shrew-borne hantaviruses, including Thottapalayam virus
(TPMV) and Cao Bang virus (CBNV), based on the M segment was 26.9 to 42.2% and 16.9 to 50.8% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, and the nucleotide
and amino acid distance based on the L segment was 28.5
to 50.5% and 31.9 to 61.0%, respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses of partial L-segment sequences of
MJNV strains, using the N-J, maximum likelihood and
Bayesian methods, showed geographic-specific genetic variation (Figure 3). In the N-J tree based on the M segment,
MJNV strain 04-39 from Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi province, was the most divergent. This was similar to the phylogeography of rodent-borne hantaviruses, including
HTNV in Apodemus agrarius [20], Soochong virus in Apodemus peninsulae [13], Puumala virus in Myodes glareolus
[21,22], Muju virus in Myodes regulus [23] and Tula virus
in Microtus arvalis [24]. Moreover, as recently shown for

infection, as determined by IFA and RT-PCR, in Crocidura
lasiura captured in the Republic of Korea during the spring,
summer, autumn and winter of 2004-2010.

SWSV in Sorex araneus [8,9], the geographic-specific
genetic variation of MJNV suggested a long-standing
virus-host relationship between MJNV and C. lasiura,
with local host-specific adaptation.
Genetic studies of MJNV in Ussuri white-toothed
shrews captured beyond Korea, in northern China and
far eastern Russia, are warranted to further explore if
host sharing exists for MJNV among sympatric and syntopic crocidurine shrews. Also, future research on the
genetic diversity of other hantaviruses harbored by
shrew species that have broad geographic distributions
(such as prototype TPMV carried by the Asian house
shrew) might provide additional insights into the phylogeography and evolutionary history of hantaviruses and
their soricid hosts.
