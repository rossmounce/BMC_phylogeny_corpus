Phylogeographic divergence in the widespread
delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) corresponds
to dry habitat barriers in eastern Australia

Abstract
Background: The mesic habitats of eastern Australia harbour a highly diverse fauna. We examined the impact of
climatic oscillations and recognised biogeographic barriers on the evolutionary history of the delicate skink
(Lampropholis delicata), a species that occurs in moist habitats throughout eastern Australia. The delicate skink is a
common and widespread species whose distribution spans 26° of latitude and nine major biogeographic barriers
in eastern Australia. Sequence data were obtained from four mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND4, 12SrRNA, 16SrRNA) for
238 individuals from 120 populations across the entire native distribution of the species. The evolutionary history
and diversification of the delicate skink was investigated using a range of phylogenetic (Maximum Likelihood,
Bayesian) and phylogeographic analyses (genetic diversity, FST, AMOVA, Tajima’s D, Fu’s F statistic).
Results: Nine geographically structured, genetically divergent clades were identified within the delicate skink. The
main clades diverged during the late Miocene-Pliocene, coinciding with the decline and fragmentation of
rainforest and other wet forest habitats in eastern Australia. Most of the phylogeographic breaks within the delicate
skink were concordant with dry habitat or high elevation barriers, including several recognised biogeographic
barriers in eastern Australia (Burdekin Gap, St Lawrence Gap, McPherson Range, Hunter Valley, southern New South
Wales). Genetically divergent populations were also located in high elevation topographic isolates inland from the
main range of L. delicata (Kroombit Tops, Blackdown Tablelands, Coolah Tops). The species colonised South
Australia from southern New South Wales via an inland route, possibly along the Murray River system. There is
evidence for recent expansion of the species range across eastern Victoria and into Tasmania, via the Bassian
Isthmus, during the late Pleistocene.
Conclusions: The delicate skink is a single widespread, but genetically variable, species. This study provides the
first detailed phylogeographic investigation of a widespread species whose distribution spans virtually all of the
major biogeographic barriers in eastern Australia.

Background
The coastal regions of eastern Australia are currently
dominated by wet forest and drier sclerophyllous habitats that harbour a highly diverse fauna [1,2]. While the
majority (~70%) of the Australian continent is covered
by arid or semi-arid vegetation, eastern Australia provides a narrow, but largely continuous expanse of habitat for mesic-adapted species [1,3,4]. These mesic
habitats are generated through the presence of the

Great Dividing Range (GDR), which abuts the entire
length of the east coast (~2,500 km) in a north-south
alignment ([5-7]; Figure 1). In the context of an expansive continent that is characterised by low topographic
relief, the moderate elevation (~1000-1300 m, maximum
~2300 m) provided by the GDR generates altitudinal,
climatic and environmental variation, and precipitates
the required moisture to support mesic vegetation
[3,5,7].
Although widespread glaciation never occurred in
Australia [8,9], climatic oscillations have driven repeated
altitudinal and distributional shifts in mesic habitats
along the eastern margin of the continent (reviewed in

Kroombit Tops is shown in Figure 2. Inset: The coastline of the Bass Strait region 14 kya. Tasmania has repeatedly been connected to the
mainland during the Pleistocene by land bridges, with the most recent connection occurring 43-14 kya during the last glacial maxima. The
western land bridge was severed 17.5 kya, with the eastern connection (the Bassian Isthmus) being inundated 13 kya, isolating Tasmania from
the mainland (after [16]).

[4]). Palaeoclimatic studies indicate that the extent and
composition of the vegetation has fluctuated dramatically over the last 10 myr, although there has been a
general transition from rainforest towards drier environments and sclerophyllous vegetation [1,3,8]. The rainforests that had previously dominated eastern Australia
contracted between the mid- and late-Miocene, giving
way to woodland and open forest vegetation that was
more suited to the drier climates [3,10-12]. Lowered sea
level associated with globally drier conditions facilitated
the expansion of vegetation into the low lying regions of
south-eastern Australia (e.g. Gippsland Basin, Murray
Basin; Figure 1) that had previously been subject to marine inundation [3,11,12]. Although the extent of rainforests briefly expanded again during the early Pliocene
due to a temporary return to warm and wet conditions,
by the end of the Pliocene open woodlands, sclerophyllous forests and grasslands dominated the landscape of
eastern Australia [3,6,8,10].
The cool-dry to warm-wet climatic fluctuations that
commenced during the Pliocene intensified throughout
the Pleistocene and led to the repeated expansion and
contraction of mesic habitats in eastern Australia and
the regular encroachment of drier habitats into the
coastal fringes [4,8,13,14]. There was periodic flooding
of the low lying coastal and inland basins in eastern
Australia during the sea level changes associated with
these climatic cycles [3,6,15], which also resulted in the
connection of Tasmania (TAS) to the mainland during
glacial periods by Bass Strait land bridges [16] (Figure
1). At present, the once widespread rainforest and wet

Page 3 of 18

forest vegetation is restricted to small, scattered remnants within a mosaic of dry sclerophyll woodlands and
open forests along the east coast [1,17].
The evolutionary history of the resident fauna of the
narrow mesic strip along the east coast has been influenced by both habitat barriers and physical barriers (e.g.
mountain ranges, sea straits), which led to genetic divergence and, in some cases, speciation of allopatric populations [1,18]. The most well-studied barrier in eastern
Australia has been the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC)
in the Wet Tropics region of north Queensland (QLD).
This thin strip of rainforest currently connects the
northern and southern rainforest block of the Wet Tropics but was repeatedly severed in the past by dry forest
habitats during globally drier climates [18,19]. Intensive
research has revealed largely concordant patterns of
genetic divergence across the barrier in a wide range of
rainforest taxa [e.g. [19-24]], and improved our understanding of how these barriers, in concert with climatic
oscillations, have generated the high levels of biodiversity evident in eastern Australia [18,25]. However, at
least nine other biogeographic barriers have been identified in eastern Australia (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 1), several of which have yet to be investigated in detail. These
include dry habitat barriers (Burdekin Gap, St Lawrence
Gap, Hunter Valley), mountain ranges that act as topographic barriers (McPherson Range, southern New
South Wales [NSW]), disjunct inland mountains
(Kroombit Tops), sea straits (Bass Strait), and marine
basins (Gippsland Basin, Murray Basin) (Tables 1 and 2;
Figure 1).

A recent study investigated the impact of five biogeographic barriers in south-eastern Australia [26]; however, here we adopt a broader approach and examine
the influence of nine biogeographic barriers (Tables 1
and 2) throughout eastern Australia on the evolutionary
history of the resident biota. In particular, we focus on
the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata (De Vis, 1888
[27]), which is unusual in that its distribution is so
broad that it spans all of these barriers in eastern Australia (Figure 2, 3). The delicate skink is a small lizard
(adult snout-vent length 35-51 mm) whose distribution
extends across 26° of latitude from Cairns in north QLD
to Hobart in TAS, with disjunct populations in far western Victoria (VIC) and south-eastern South Australia
(SA) ([28]; Figure 2, 3). It is a common species that
occurs across a range of moist habitats, including rainforests, wet sclerophyll forests, woodland and heaths
[28]. However, it also thrives in disturbed habitats and is
one the most common skink species in suburban gardens along the east coast [28].
Here we examine the phylogeography of the delicate
skink using 2426 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence
data (ND2, ND4, 12SrRNA, 16SrRNA) from across the
entire native range of the species (Figure 2, 3). Due to
its presence in TAS and eastern VIC, Rawlinson [29]
suggested that the delicate skink was a glacial relic
that had occurred in southern Australia for a prolonged period of time. However, it has been implied
that the delicate skink might not be native to TAS,
instead reaching the state via human-assisted colonisation. This is because the delicate skink was not
detected in TAS until 1963, although subsequent
examination of museum collections revealed that previously mis-identified specimens had been collected
during the 1920s and 1930s [30]. Unlike many reptile
species whose distribution spans Bass Strait, the delicate skink does not occur on Wilsons Promontory (the
most southerly projection of the Australian mainland),
but it does occur on a Bass Strait Island (Flinders
Island) that formed part of the Bassian Isthmus during
the last glacial maxima ([28]; Figure 1, 2). We conduct
a range of phylogeographic analyses to examine Rawlinson’s [29] hypothesis, determine the status of the
Tasmanian population, and investigate the impact of
historical processes on the evolutionary history of the
delicate skink.

Methods
Sampling

We obtained tissue samples from 238 Lampropholis
delicata, representing 120 different populations, from
across the entire Australian range of the species (Figure
2, 3; Additional files 1, 2). Samples were obtained from
the frozen-tissue collections of several Australian

Page 5 of 18

Museums (Australian Museum, South Australian
Museum, CSIRO Australian National Wildlife Collection), along with our own field collections (Additional
files 1, 2). We included the closely related L. guichenoti
(Australian Museum NR2639) and an Australian Eugongylus-lineage skink Niveoscincus pretiosus (Australian
Museum NR391) as outgroups in our study.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from liver, muscle,
toe or tail-tip samples using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood
and Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
For each sample we sequenced portions of four mitochondrial genes: ND2 (~600 bp), ND4 (~700 bp),
12SrRNA (~700 bp), and 16SrRNA (~500 bp). These
regions were targeted because work across several taxonomic levels in squamate reptiles has indicated useful
levels of variability [e.g. [26,31-34]]. The primers used to
amplify and sequence these regions are provided in
Additional file 3. PCR was conducted as outlined in
Greaves et al. [35], except on a Corbett Research GC1960 thermal cycler. PCR products were purified using
ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio USA).
The purified product was sequenced directly using a
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems) and then analysed on an ABI 3730XL capillary sequencer.
Sequence data were edited using CONTIGEXPRESS in
VECTOR NTI ADVANCE v9.1.0 (Invitrogen), and
aligned using the default parameters of CLUSTAL X
v1.83[36]. We translated all coding region sequences to
confirm that none contained premature stop codons.
Sequence data were submitted to GenBank [GenBank:
JF438009-JF438959, EF567304, EU567726, EU567768,
EU567769, EU567927, EU567928, EU568019,
EU568020] (Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic analyses

Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian tree building
methods were used. We used MODELTEST 3.7 [37] to
identify the most appropriate model of sequence evolution based on the AIC criterion. MODELTEST, conducted in PAUP* 4.0b10 [38], was also used to estimate
base frequencies, substitution rates, the proportion of
invariable sites (I) and the among-site substitution rate
variation (G). These values were then used as settings in
PhyML 3.0 [39] to generate a ML tree with 500
bootstraps.
MRBAYES 3.1.2 [40] was then used to complete Bayesian analyses. Preliminary analysis of each mtDNA
region revealed congruent tree topologies. In order to
evaluate partitioning strategies, we used MODELTEST
to determine the most appropriate model for each partition. We then conducted a Bayesian analysis for each

partitioning strategy, applying the appropriate model of
evolution to each partition, and allowing among-partition rate variation. We ran each Bayesian analysis for
five million generations, sampling every 100 generations
(i.e. 50,000 sampled trees). We ran each analysis twice,
using four heated chains per run. We discarded the first

25% of samples as burn-in and the last 37,500 trees
were used to estimate the Bayesian posterior probabilities. In order to calculate the AIC and BIC scores for
different partitions strategies, we calculated the number
of parameters for each. Following McGuire et al. [41],
for each parameter we added the number of substitution

Chapple et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:191
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/191

rates for the model suggested by MODELTEST for that
partition (6 for GTR, or 2 for HKY), the number of free
equilibrium base frequencies (3 for GTR and HKY), plus
one parameter per partition where appropriate for each
of I and/or G. For multi-partition strategies, we also
added one parameter per partition, corresponding to the
among-partition rate multiplier. To calculate the AIC
and BIC scores, we used the equations: AIC = -2Li + 2ki
and BIC = -2Li + (ki).(ln n) (where Li is the harmonic
mean log likelihood for partitioning strategy i, ki is the
total number of parameters for partitioning strategy i,
and n is the total number of nucleotides). The program
TRACER 1.5 [42] was used to check for chain convergence and mixing. Specifically, raw traces of sampled
values versus MCMC step numbers were examined to
confirm that there was no trend away from the mean
and that there were no large fluctuations in the likelihood values.
Bootstrap values (500 ML bootstraps) and Bayesian
posterior probabilities were used to assess branch support. We considered branches supported by bootstrap
values of 70% or greater [43], and/or posterior probability values greater than or equal to 95% [44] to be supported by our data.
Molecular diversity and population divergence

Estimates of genetic diversity within L. delicata clades
(number of haplotypes, h; haplotypic diversity, Hd; number of polymorphic sites, S; nucleotide diversity, π) were
calculated in DNASP v4.50 [45]. Tamura-Nei (TrN)-corrected genetic distances within and among clades were
calculated in MEGA 4 [46]. Genetic differentiation
among clades within L. delicata was estimated in ARLEQUIN v3.5 [47]. Pairwise FST values (an analogue of
Wright’s fixation index FST) were calculated to estimate
among clade differentiation. We conducted hierarchical
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA; [48]) to
investigate the impact of the a priori (Tables 1 and 2)
and a posteriori biogeographic barriers on the partitioning of genetic variation within L. delicata. Both tests
used TrN genetic distances with gamma correction
(using the value calculated from MODELTEST). Significance levels of all the estimated values were calculated
by 10,000 permutations, and adjusted according to the
Bonferroni correction procedure [49] for multiple pairwise comparisons as described by Holm [50].
We used Tajima’s D [50], Fu’s F statistic [51] (calculated in ARLEQUIN) and mismatch distributions to test
for signatures of population expansion within L. delicata

statistic values are indicative of possible population

population history [52]. A smooth bell shape signifies
either population expansion or spatial range expansion,
whereas a multimodal distribution represents a long history in situ [53-56]. To distinguish between these two
types of distribution, a raggedness index (RI, sum of the
squared difference between neighbouring peaks) and the
sum of squared deviations (SSD) between the observed
and expected mismatch were calculated using the methods of Schneider & Excoffier [57] in ARLEQUIN. The
spatial expansion hypothesis (both RI and SSD) was
tested using a parametric bootstrap approach (200
replicates).
As there are no suitable fossil calibration points
available for Lampropholis skinks, we estimated the
divergence time of L. delicata clades using an evolutionary rate of 1.3-1.63% sequence divergence per million years, based on mitochondrial DNA calibrations
from other squamate reptile groups (1.3%, [58]; 1.421.63%, [59]; 1.55%, [60]; 1.62%, [61]; 1.63%, [62]). A
strict molecular clock (0.0065-0.00815 per lineage substitution rate), implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [63], was
used to estimate the divergence times within L. delicata. The Australian Eugongylus lineage is estimated to
have originated ~20 mya [64], and this information
was used as the maximum age of the tree root. A GTR
+I+G model of evolution was employed with a coalescent (Bayesian skyline) tree prior. The analysis was run
twice, with 20 million generations per run (total 40
million generations). The output was viewed in TRACER to check that stationarity had been reached, and
ensure that the effective sample size (ESS) exceeded
200 [63]. The two separate runs were then combined
using LOGCOMBINER v1.6.1, with a maximum clade
credibility tree generated in TREEANNOTATOR
v1.6.1 and visualised in FIGTREE v1.3.1. A Bayesian
skyline plot [65] was also generated in TRACER to
examine the magnitude and timing of population size
changes in L. delicata.

Results
Molecular diversity and phylogeographic structure

The edited alignment comprised 2426 characters (550
bp ND2, 671 bp ND4, 708 bp 12SrRNA, 497 bp
16SrRNA; Additional file 4), of which 813 (33.5%) were
variable and 587 (24.2%) were parsimony-informative.
For the ingroup only, the alignment contained 638
(26.3%) variable characters, of which 543 (22.4%) were
parsimony-informative. Base frequencies were unequal
(A = 0.3694, T = 0.2172, C = 0.2889, G = 0.1245), but a
c2 test confirmed the homogeneity of base frequencies
among sequences (df = 498, P = 1.0). The phylogenetic
analyses were conducted on a dataset comprising the
165 unique haplotypes that were present within L. delicata (Table 3).

The AIC from MODELTEST supported the GTR + I +
G substitution model as the most appropriate for our
unpartitioned dataset. Parameters estimated under this
model were: relative substitution rates (A↔C = 2.1053,
A↔G = 44.1898, A↔T = 2.5350, C↔G = 1.1020, C↔T
= 29.2135, relative to G↔T = 1.00), proportion of
invariable sites (0.5241), and gamma distribution shape
parameter (0.7015). We evaluated three partitioning
strategies for our dataset (Table 4). The unpartitioned
and by gene partitioning strategy were analysed using
the GTR + I + G model for all nucletotides. When the
data was partitioned by codon, we used a mixture of
GTR and HKY models for each partition (Table 4). Both
the AIC and BIC scores ranked the most highly parameterised strategy (by gene and codon) as the most appropriate. However, the topologies of the ML, unpartitioned
Bayesian and partitioned Bayesian trees were congruent,
therefore we present the optimal ML tree (-ln L =
14501.43296) with ML bootstrap (BS) values and unpartitioned Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) indicating

branch support (Figure 4, 5). Nine well-supported, nonoverlapping clades (labelled from the top to bottom of
the tree, and roughly related to their north to south
geographic distribution) are present within L. delicata
(Figure 2, 3, 4, 5), with high levels of haplotypic and
nucleotide diversity within each clade (Table 3). The
PP’s of the main clades and subclades in the partitioned
Bayesian analysis were identical to those from the
unpartitioned Bayesian analysis presented in Figure 4
and 5, except that the support value for Clade 9 was
lower (0.85 rather than 0.95).
Clade 1 encompasses populations from coastal northern and eastern QLD, and is comprised of three subclades (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Subclade 1a includes
populations north of Townsville, subclade 1b contains
populations in the Mackay region, and subclade 1c
stretches from the Rockhampton region to Bania State
Forest (inland from Bundaberg) in south-east QLD (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 2 is restricted to Kroombit Tops
(Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). A complex mosaic of geographically

non-overlapping clades occurs throughout south-eastern
QLD and northern NSW (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 3
includes populations from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane region of south-eastern QLD (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5).
There is strong support for a close affinity between
Clade 2 and Clade 3 (Figure 4, 5). Subclade 3a occurs
within Cooloola National Park, while subclade 3b is
restricted to the Bunya Mountains (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5).
Subclade 3c extends from the Maryborough region to
the northern suburbs of Brisbane, with subclade 3d containing populations from the southern suburbs of Brisbane to Barney View on the western side of Lamington
National Park (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5).
Clade 4 (96 BS) occurs along the Main Range and
throughout the QLD/NSW border region, and in inland
northern NSW (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Subclade 4a (93 BS)
extends from Deongwar State Forest and other areas in
south-eastern QLD (Lamington NP, Main Range)
through the elevated regions of inland northern NSW to
Riamukka State Forest, inland from Port Macquarie
(Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Subclade 4b is restricted to the more
coastal regions of northern NSW (Mt Warning NP, Border Ranges NP, Nightcap NP, Whian Whian State Forest, Alstonville), while subclade 4c occurs further inland
at Bolivia Hill, Torrington State Forest and near Armidale (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 5 extends along the northern NSW coastal region from Yamba to Cairncross
State Forest near Port Macquarie, and is comprised of
two subclades: subclade 5a (Yamba to Coffs Harbour)
and subclade 5b (Styx River State Forest to Cairncross
State Forest) (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 6 represents a disjunct inland population on the Blackdown Tableland in
southern QLD (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5).
Clade 7 is geographically widespread, occurring from
the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and inland
southern NSW (subclade 7a) across to western VIC (Little Desert NP) and south-eastern SA (subclade 7b) (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 8 is a disjunct population that
occurs in Coolah Tops National Park in inland northern
NSW (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Clade 9 is distributed from the
central coast of NSW and throughout eastern VIC and
TAS (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). Subclade 9a encompasses the
central coast of NSW and the Sydney region, subclade
9b occurs at Brayton, while subclade 9c comprises
populations from coastal southern NSW (Figure 2, 3, 4,

5). Subclade 9d represents a shallow clade that is distributed throughout eastern VIC and TAS (Figure 2, 3,
4, 5).
Genetic differentiation among clades and divergence time
estimates

Considerable genetic differentiation was evident
amongst the nine L. delicata clades, with extremely high
and statistically significant pairwise FST values among
clades (Table 5). The only comparisons that were not
significant were those involving clades with low sample
sizes (e.g. Clade 8). Substantial genetic distances are evident among the clades (4.3-7.4%; Table 5), indicating
that the divergences within L. delicata occurred during
the late Miocene-Pliocene (Figure 6, Additional file 5).
The intra-clade genetic divergences in L. delicata were
0.0-2.6% (Table 3). The vast majority (97.7%) of genetic
variation in L. delicata was partitioned among populations (Table 6). The nine a priori biogeographic barriers
(Tables 1 and 2) accounted for 64.1% of the genetic variation in L. delicata (Table 6). This value increased to
66.5% when the two barriers identified a posteriori
(Blackdown Tableland, Coolah Tops) were included in
the analysis (Table 6).
The Bayesian skyline plot indicated recent (i.e. last 0.2
myr) contraction then expansion of L. delicata populations (Figure 7), although there was no consistent support for the model of spatial expansion in L. delicata
clades or subclades. Three main clades (2, 4 and 7) and
four subclades (3a, 4b, 7b and 9d) deviated significantly
from the expectations of neutrality (Tajima’s D, Fu’s F
statistic) (Table 3), suggesting recent population expansion. However, the RI and SSD values indicated that a
model of population expansion could only be conclusively rejected for two main clades (1 and 4) and two
subclades (1c and 4c) (Table 3).

Discussion
The nine main clades of Lampropholis delicata appear
to have diverged during the late Miocene-Pliocene.
Although the current study relied solely on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, the same tree topology is evident in a molecular phylogeny for the Lampropholis
genus (including representatives from each main L. delicata clade) based on mitochondrial DNA and five

nuclear genes (C. Hoskin, C. Moritz & D. Chapple,
unpublished data). The divergence of L. delicata corresponds to a time when rainforest habitat in eastern Australia was in decline as a result of a drying climate,
resulting in restriction of rainforest to a series of disjunct remnants that have been described as an ‘archipelago of refugia’ [1,3,17]. The delicate skink occurs in
rainforest or rainforest fringes and therefore likely

experienced similar reduction and fragmentation, resulting in genetic divergence among geographically isolated
populations. Despite evidence for the expansion and
contraction of some clades throughout the Pleistocene,
each is geographically structured and non-overlapping
(Figure 2, 3). This pattern that has been observed in a
range of other taxa (Table 2; [1]), including L. guichenoti

generally correspond to dry habitat and topographic barriers (i.e. Burdekin Gap, St Lawrence Gap, Kroombit
Tops, McPherson Range; Hunter Valley, southern NSW;
Figure 1, 2, 3). However, contrary to the hypothesis of
Rawlinson [29], the delicate skink appears to be a relatively recent arrival in south-eastern Australia and exhibits no evidence of restricted geneflow across the
barriers in this region (e.g. East Gippsland, Bass Strait).

Phylogeographic structure in the delicate skink
corresponds to dry habitat and elevational barriers

Despite its widespread distribution along the east coast
of Australia, there is substantial phylogeographic structure across the native range of the delicate skink (Figure
4, 5). In many instances these breaks are concordant
with dry habitat corridors, indicating that regions of
drier vegetation represent effective barriers to dispersal
for the mesic-adapted delicate skink. For instance, the
delicate skink exhibits a moderate genetic break (4.5%,
subclade 1a vs 1b; Figure 6) across the Burdekin Gap in
North QLD. Equivalent Pliocene divergences between
populations either side of the Burdekin Gap have been
reported in open forest frogs [66,67], rainforest lizards
[22], woodland lizards [68], rainforest birds (Pleistocene;
[19]) and freshwater fish (Miocene; [69]) (Table 2). In
contrast, the St Lawrence Gap north of Rockhampton
on the central QLD coast has only been identified as a
significant barrier for one lizard species (late Pleistocene-early Pliocene, [68]; Table 2). Although divergence
is also evident across the St Lawrence Gap in the delicate skink (4.8%, mid-late Pliocene, subclade 1b vs 1c), a
more substantial break is evident a little to the south,
between clades 1 and 3 (7.1%, late Miocene) in the
Gladstone region (Table 5, Figure 2, 3, 4, 5).
Two high elevation areas (Kroombit Tops, Blackdown
Tableland) inland from the main range of L. delicata in
southern QLD were found to harbour genetically divergent lineages. Both areas are remnant patches of moist
forest that are surrounded by drier lowland eucalypt
woodland, and are disjunct from the main distribution
of the delicate skink along the east coast ([70]; Figure 2,
3). Kroombit Tops (~730 m) was identified a priori as a
potential habitat isolate for the delicate skink, as the
region provides a cooler and wetter refuge for mesicadapted species ([70,71]; Tables 1 and 2). The Kroombit
Tops population of the delicate skink diverged from the
surrounding coastal populations during the mid Pliocene
(4.9%, Clade 2 vs 3; Table 5, Figure 6), a pattern that has
also been observed in a rainforest bird [71], two open
forest frogs [66,67], and several open forest reptiles [72]
(Table 2). The Blackdown Tablelands are a moderate
elevation plateau (~600 m) that provides an isolated
refugium for numerous mesic-adapted species. Our
results for the delicate skink (4.3-6.7%, Pliocene; Figure

Separate analyses are conducted for the nine biogeographic barriers that were identified a priori (Tables 1 and 2), and including the two additional barriers
identified a posteriori (i.e. Blackdown Tableland, Coolah Tops). The degrees of freedom are indicated in parentheses. Statistical significance (P) was tested with
10,000 permutations.

6) provide evidence that the fauna of this region may
also be genetically divergent from the coastal populations, a pattern also seen in other open forest reptiles
[72].
The Coolah Tops are a high elevation (1200 m) plateau located in inland northern NSW, just to the north
of the Hunter Valley (Figure 2, 3). The refugial population of the delicate skink that occurs on the Coolah
Tops was found to have diverged from the nearby populations in northern NSW during the early-mid Pliocene
(4.6-4.8%; Table 5, Figure 6). The dry habitat in the
Hunter River Valley has been demonstrated to represent
a major barrier to dispersal in both woodland and wet
forest species ([73-76]; Table 2). While the divergence
across the Hunter Valley was estimated to have
occurred in the Miocene in the congeneric L. guichenoti,
which is frequently sympatric with L. delicata [26], an
early-mid Pliocene break was observed across this barrier in the delicate skink (subclade 9a vs Clades 4-5; Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). The divergence estimate for the delicate

skink is consistent with those reported for most other
species across the Hunter Valley (Table 2).
Our analyses revealed a complex mosaic of geographically structured, non-overlapping clades and subclades
(Clades 3-5) in the delicate skink in south-eastern QLD
and northern NSW (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). The McPherson
Range that occurs along the border region (Figure 1) is
concordant with the phylogeographic break between
Clades 3 and 4 (Figure 2, 3). The distribution of Clade 4
extends northwards into south-east QLD to the Main
Range, which runs perpendicular to the western edge of
the McPherson Range (Figure 1). Similar biogeographic
patterns involving the Main and McPherson Ranges
occur in wet forest (Litoria pearsoniana; [77]) and open
forest frogs (Litoria fallax; [66]) (Table 2). The earlymid Pliocene split found across the McPherson/Main
Ranges in the delicate skink (4.8%; Figure 6) is concordant with that observed in L. guichenoti, which also
inhabits open woodlands and dry sclerophyll forest [28],
but intermediate between that reported for frogs (Miocene; [66,77]) and a wet forest snake (Pleistocene; [78])
(Table 2).
Some relatively minor phylogeographic structure is
evident among the populations in the Maryborough,
Sunshine Coast and Brisbane regions of south-east QLD
(subclades 3a-d; Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). A more substantial
break occurs between inland (Clade 4) and coastal
(Clade 5) delicate skink populations north of the Hunter
Valley in NSW (4.5%, early-mid Pliocene; Table 5, Figure 6). A similar coastal vs inland divergence in northern NSW is shared with White’s skink (Liopholis whitii,
[74]), and reflects an equivalent pattern that is regularly
observed in southern NSW (Table 2). Indeed, an analogous pattern is evident within Clade 4 in northern
NSW, with subclade 4b occurring near the coastal margin, subclade 4a present in intermediate areas (with secondary contact between 4a and 4b occurring in the
Border Ranges NP), and subclade 4c occurring further

Chapple et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:191
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/191

inland (Figure 2, 3). These biogeographic patterns, combined with the break observed in southern NSW (Figure
2, 3), indicate that high elevation areas may represent
barriers to dispersal in the delicate skink.
The delicate skink is a relatively recent arrival in southern
Australia

The five phylogeographic studies that have had sufficient
sampling to examine the impact of the elevational and
habitat barriers in southern NSW have reported a
genetic break between the inland (including the ACT)
and coastal regions ([26,71,73,74,79]; Table 2). The
impact of this barrier is pronounced in the delicate
skink, as populations from the ACT and inland southern
NSW are more closely related to the SA populations
(3.0%, early Pleistocene-late Pliocene) than the adjacent
populations along the NSW coast (5.3%, mid-Pliocene;
Figure 2, 3, 4, 5). This indicates that the delicate skink
most likely reached SA from the southern NSW region
via an inland route, rather than along a coastal dispersal
pathway through VIC. The delicate skink may have dispersed through the mesic vegetation that is located
along the Murray River, which forms the border
between NSW and VIC for the majority of its length
(Figure 2, 3). Indeed, the eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii) has a continuous distribution through the
Murray-Darling River system that connects populations
along the east coast (North QLD to southern NSW) to
an isolated population in south-eastern SA [28]. This
biogeographic pattern was not previously suspected for
the delicate skink and explains the large distributional
gap across western VIC between the eastern suburbs of
Melbourne and Little Desert NP in north-western VIC
(Figure 2, 3). Given this pattern, it was not possible to
examine the impact of the Murray Basin on the delicate
skink (Table 2).
Several frog and lizard species exhibit deep phylogeographic breaks in the East Gippsland region
[26,67,74,79], a pattern that is believed to be the result
of repeated marine inundation of the area since the
Miocene (Tables 1 and 2). However, the East Gippsland
region does not appear to constitute a barrier to dispersal in the delicate skink, with an extremely shallow clade
(intraclade divergence 0.2%) distributed across eastern
VIC and across Bass Strait into TAS (Figure 2, 3). The
coastal area in East Gippsland has been relatively stable
since the late Pleistocene [15,80], enabling the delicate
to disperse across eastern VIC from southern NSW.
The delicate skink has colonised TAS during the late
Pleistocene, with the presence of shared haplotypes
between populations in eastern VIC and TAS indicating
a connection between these two regions until relatively
recently (~12-15 kya; Table 5, Figure 6, Additional file
2). The timing coincides with the inundation of the

Page 15 of 18

Bassian Isthmus, which connected eastern VIC (Wilsons
Promotory) to north-eastern TAS between 43-14 kya
([16]; Table 1, Figure 1). Although the delicate skink
does not currently occur on Wilsons Promontory, it is
present on Flinders Island (which formed part of the
Bassian Isthmus) and is common throughout north-eastern TAS ([[28,81], DGC, personal observation]). While a
second land bridge was located from western VIC,
through the King Island region to western TAS from
~43-17.5 kya [16], the absence of the delicate skink
from western VIC would have precluded dispersal of the
species via this western route. Fossil evidence for a
Nothofagus tree species on King Island 38 kya suggests
that moist forest vegetation occurred along the Bass
Strait land bridges [82], enabling dispersal of the delicate
skink into TAS. Although some other species appear not
to have used these recent land bridges (frog: Crinia signigera, [79]; reptiles: Acritoscincus duperreyi, [76]; Lerista
bougainvilli, [83]; mammals: Dasyurus maculatus, [84]),
others appear to have dispersed across these Bass Strait
land bridges (frogs: Limnodynastes peronii and tasmaniensis, [67]; reptiles: Liopholis whitii, [73]; Notechis scutatus, [85]) (Table 2). The repeated presence of the land
bridges has also restricted east-west gene flow across
Bass Strait in several marine invertebrate species
([86-89]; Table 2).
There is no evidence to support the hypothesis of
Rawlinson [29] that the delicate skink is a ‘glacial relic’
with a relatively long presence in southern Australia. In
contrast, our analyses indicate that the delicate skink
only colonised VIC and TAS during the late Pleistocene
from coastal southern NSW. Although the delicate
skink (also known as the rainbow or plague skink in its
introduced range) is a successful invasive species in the
Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand, and Lord Howe Island
[90], there is no strong evidence to suggest that it represents an introduced species in TAS. However, given the
relatively shallow genetic divergences within subclade
9d, we are unable to completely exclude the possibility
that the delicate skink reached TAS via human-associated colonisation.

Conclusions
We performed a detailed phylogeographic study of a
species found in mesic forests down almost the entire
length of eastern Australia. Lampropholis delicata is a
single widespread, but genetically variable, species consisting of nine geographically structured, non-overlapping clades. This structuring is likely the result of
population subdivision across dry habitat barriers (Burdekin Gap, St Lawrence Gap, Hunter Valley), topographic barriers (McPherson Range, southern NSW) and
to upland habitat isolates (Kroombit Tops, Blackdown
Tableland, Coolah Tops). In contrast, in the south-east

Chapple et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:191
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/191

of its range, the delicate skink exhibits evidence for
recent dispersal into SA via an inland route, and
through eastern VIC and across the Bassian Isthmus
into TAS. Previous studies have demonstrated geographic variation in morphology, reproductive ecology
and life history in the delicate skink [91,92]. Given the
presence of multiple divergent lineages across the range,
this regional variation in morphology and life history
may have a genetic, as well as climatic or environmental,
basis.
