Abstract
Background: Post-transcriptional control of gene expression is suspected to play an important
role in malaria parasites. In yeast and metazoans, part of the stress response is mediated through
phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which results in the selective
translation of mRNAs encoding stress-response proteins.
Methods: The impact of starvation on the phosphorylation state of PfeIF2α was examined.
Bioinformatic methods were used to identify plasmodial eIF2α kinases. The activity of one of these,
PfeIK1, was investigated using recombinant protein with non-physiological substrates and
recombinant PfeIF2α. Reverse genetic techniques were used to disrupt the pfeik1 gene.
Results: The data demonstrate that the Plasmodium falciparum eIF2α orthologue is phosphorylated
in response to starvation, and provide bioinformatic evidence for the presence of three eIF2α
kinases in P. falciparum, only one of which (PfPK4) had been described previously. Evidence is
provided that one of the novel eIF2α kinases, PfeIK1, is able to phosphorylate the P. falciparum
eIF2α orthologue in vitro. PfeIK1 is not required for asexual or sexual development of the parasite,
as shown by the ability of pfeik1- parasites to develop into sporozoites. However, eIF2α
phosphorylation in response to starvation is abolished in pfeik1- asexual parasites
Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that a mechanism for versatile regulation of translation
by several kinases with a similar catalytic domain but distinct regulatory domains, is conserved in P.
falciparum.

Background
Human malaria is caused by infection with intracellular
protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that are
transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Of four species that
infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for
the most virulent form of the disease. The transition from
one stage of the life cycle to the next must be tightly regulated, to ensure proliferation and differentiation occur
when and where appropriate; this is undoubtedly linked
to differential gene expression. Analysis of the P. falciparum transcriptome during the erythrocytic asexual cycle
reveals an ordered cascade of gene expression [1], and the
various developmental stages display distinct transcriptomes; how this is orchestrated remains obscure. Initial
investigation of the P. falciparum genome revealed a paucity of transcriptional regulators [2], although this picture
has recently been challenged by the recent identification
of the ApiAP2 transcription factor family [3]. There is nevertheless a large body of evidence suggesting that posttranscriptional control is an important means of gene regulation in P. falciparum. Examples include the relatively
small number of identifiable transcription-associated proteins, abundance of CCCH-type zinc finger proteins commonly involved in modulating mRNA decay and
translation rates [2] and translational repression during
gametocytogenesis [4-6].
In mammalian cells, regulation of gene expression is a key
mechanism in the mediation of stress responses, which
may be achieved by influencing transcription or translation. The Stress Activated Protein kinases (SAPKs), specifically JNKs and p38 kinases, are subfamilies of mitogen
activated protein kinases (MAPK) that are expressed in
most eukaryotic cells, and respond to a variety of stress
conditions [7]. Although the parasite kinome includes
two MAPK homologues, none of these are members of the
SAPK subfamily [8-10]. In contrast, the P. falciparum
kinome contains a phylogenetic cluster of three kinases
with homology to eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α (eIF2α
kinases, which in other organisms regulate translation in
response to stress [10]. Interestingly, the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been shown to differentiate from tachyzoites to bradyzoites on exposure to
a number of cellular stresses, concomitant with an
increase in phosphorylation of TgeIF2α, indicating a possible role for this mechanism in parasite differentiation
[11].
Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α at residue Ser51 in response to stress is a well-characterized
mechanism of post-transcriptional control that regulates
initiation of translation [12-17]. In mammalian cells this
phosphorylation event is mediated by four distinct protein kinases, called the eIF2α kinases: general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), haem-regulated inhibitor kinase

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/99

(HRI), RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and PKRlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). These
enzymes contain a similar catalytic domain allowing
them to phosphorylate the same substrate, but have different accessory domains that regulate kinase activation in
response to different signals. In GCN2 the functional
kinase domain is followed by a histidyl-tRNA synthetase
(HisRS)-like domain [18], which is the major motif for
sensing amino acid starvation and triggering kinase activation; PERK has a transmembrane domain allowing it to
reside in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; the Nterminal domain can protrude into the lumen of the ER to
sense unfolded proteins, while the catalytic domain
extends into the cytoplasm where its substrate and effector
mechanism lie; human PKR contains an RNA binding
domain and responds to viral infection; and HRI contains
haem binding sites to modulate translation of globin
chains according to the availability of haem. In this way
the eIF2α kinases can integrate diverse stress signals into a
common pathway [12-14,19].
Translation initiation requires the assembly of the 80S
ribosome on the mRNA, which is mediated by proteins
known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Formation
of the 43S pre-initiation complex depends on binding of
the ternary complex that consists of the heterotrimeric Gprotein eIF2 (α, β and γ subunits), methionyl-initiator
tRNA (met-tRNAi) and GTP [13]. Initiation of translation
and release of the initiation factors involves hydrolysis of
GTP to GDP, which leaves an inactive eIF2-GDP complex.
Before further rounds of translation initiation can occur
eIF2 must be reactivated by exchange of GDP for GTP
[13]. The presence of a phosphate group on the α subunit
of eIF2 inhibits recycling of inactive eIF2-GDP to active
eIF2-GTP by limiting the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B [20]. The consequence of
activity of the eIF2α kinases therefore is global translation
repression, since initiation complexes cannot form. In
spite of the generalized reduction in translation, selected
mRNAs are translated, whose products shapes the subsequent stress response. Reduced translation conserves
energy and nutrients, allowing time for the cell to adapt
appropriately to the stress conditions. This mechanism is
conserved in the vast majority of eukaryotes. One notable
exception is the Microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi,
whose kinome does not include eIF2α kinases (or other
stress-response kinases), a probable adaptation to its parasitic lifestyle [21]. It is, therefore, of interest to investigate
the extent to which malaria parasites may rely on eIF2α
phosphorylation for stress-response and/or life cycle progression.
A cluster of three sequences that includes PfPK4, a protein
kinase that was previously described as a putative eIF2α
kinase [22], was identified in the P. falciparum kinome on

the basis of catalytic domain similarity [10,23]. Here, evidence is provided that the P. falciparum eIF2α orthologue
is phosphorylated in response to amino acid starvation.
Bioinformatics analysis reveals that P. falciparum encodes
three eIF2α kinases, one of which, Plasmodiumfalciparum
eukaryotic Initiation Factor Kinase-1 (PfeIK1), is indeed
be able to phosphorylate P. falciparum eIF2α in vitro.
Reverse genetics experiments show that inactivation of the
pfeik1 gene does not affect asexual growth, gametocytogenesis or further sexual development, since pfeik1- sporozoites can be formed in the mosquito vector; in
contrast, pfeik1- parasites are unable to phosphorylate
eIF2α in response to amino-acid starvation.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis
BLASTP analysis was used to identify the closest human
and Plasmodium berghei orthologues of the PfeIF2α
kinases. Catalytic domains of the putative PfeIF2α kinases
as defined by the alignment of P. falciparum kinases [10]
were aligned with the four human eIF2α kinases and
other P. falciparum and human sequences that were
selected to represent all kinase subfamilies. The sequences
were aligned using the HMMER package against a profile
generated from our previous kinome analysis [10]. After
removal of gaps and positions with a low quality of alignment, alternate phylogenies generated with the neighbour
joining method were visualized using NeighbourNet
implemented on SplitsTree version 4 [24].

BLASTP searches of PlasmoDB using metazoan eIF2α
sequences as queries identified PF07_0117 as the P. falciparum homologue of eIF2α, which was then confirmed by
reciprocal analysis. Alignment of these sequences was performed using ClustalW.
Molecular cloning
PfeIK1
A 1278 bp fragment encoding the catalytic domain of
PfeIK1 (PF14_0423) was amplified from a P. falciparum
cDNA library using the Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes),
using the following primers: forward, GGGGGGATCCATGGGGAAAAAAAAACATGG, reverse GGGGGTCGACCGTAAAAAGTACACTTTCGTG. The primers contained
BamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively (underlined).
The Taq polymerase (Takara) was used to add adenine
tails to enable cloning of the product into the pGEM-T
Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. The correct
sequence was removed by digestion with BamHI and SalI
and inserted into the expression vector pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia). A catalytically inactive mutant was obtained by
site directed mutagenesis of Lys458 to Met using the overlap extension PCR method [25] (forward: CTTATGCATTAATGATTATAAG,
reverse:
CTTATAATCATTAATGCATAAG).

PfeIF2α
Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the
complete coding sequence of PfeIF2α (PF17_0117) by
PCR from a cDNA library of the P. falciparum clone 3D7,
using the Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes). The primers
used were as follows: forward, GGGGGGATCCATGACTGAAATGCGAGTAAAAGC and reverse, GGGGGTCGACTTAATCTTCCTCCTCCTCGTC (restriction sites are
underlined). Taq polymerase (Takara) was used to add
adenine tails to enable cloning of the 990 bp product into
the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for amplification and
sequencing. The correct sequence was removed by digestion with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the expression
vector pGEX-4T3 (Pharmacia). A mutant of PfeIF2α
designed to be refractory to phosphorylation was
obtained by site directed mutagenesis (Ser59 – Ala) using
the overlap extension PCR technique [25], (primers: forward,
CTTATGCATTAATGATTATAAG,
reverse,
CTTATAATCATTAATGCATAAG).

All inserts were verified by DNA sequencing (The
Sequencing Service, Dundee, UK) prior to expression of
recombinant proteins or transfection of P. falciparum.
Recombinant protein expression
Expression of recombinant GST fusion proteins was
induced in E. coli (strain BL21, codon plus) with 0.25 mM
Isopropyl Thiogalactoside (IPTG). After induction, bacteria were grown at 16°C overnight and the resulting bacterial pellets were stored at -20°C until use. All subsequent
work was done on ice, centrifugation steps at 4°C. Protein
extraction was performed by digestion of bacterial pellets
for 5 min. with lysozyme (Sigma), followed by 10 min. in
lysis buffer (1 × PBS, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% Triton
×100, 1 mM Phenyl Methyl Sulphonate (PMSF), Benzamidine Hydrochloride Hydrate (BHH), 1× complete cocktail protease inhibitors (Roche)). Bacterial lysates were
sonicated at 20% amplitude (Bioblock Scientific, Vibracell 72405), 5 × 15 sec. pulses/15 sec. rest, and cleared by
centrifugation 13000 g, 15 min. GST-fusion proteins were
purified by incubation of cleared lysates on glutathione
agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 hours, followed by four
washes with lysis buffer and eluted for 20 min. in elution
buffer (Tris 40 mM, pH8.7, 75 mM NaCl, 15 mM reduced
glutathione). Protein concentration was monitored using
the Bradford assay (Biorad reagent). Kinase assays were
carried out immediately after purification.
Kinase assay
Kinase reactions (30 μl) were carried out in a standard
kinase buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, phosphatase inhibitors; 10 mM
NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 μM ATP and 0.1
MBq [γ-32P] ATP, using 2 μg recombinant kinase, and 10

μg non-physiological substrate (α-casein, β-casein), or
recombinant GST-PfeIF2α. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min. at 30°C and stopped by addition of
reducing Laemmli buffer, 3 minutes, 100°C. Samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation of
kinase substrates assessed by autoradiography of the dried
gels.
Plasmodium falciparum genetic manipulation
A gene disruption plasmid was produced for PF14_0423
in the plasmid pCAM-BSD [26] that contains the gene
conferring resistance to blasticidin. The oligonucleotide
pair
GGGGGGATCCGTAATGAAAGTAAAAAATAAG/
GGGGCGCCGGCGAGGTGAAATATAATGAATTGTTCC,
containing BamHI and NotI sites (underlined) was used to
amplify a 789 bp fragment for insertion to pCAM-BSD.
Ring stage parasites were electroporated with 50 – 100 μg
plasmid DNA, as previously described [26]. Blasticidin
(Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 2.5
μg/ml 48 hours after transfection to select for transformed
parasites. Resistant parasites appeared after 3–4 weeks and
were maintained under selection. After verification by
PCR that pfeik1- parasites were present, the population was
cloned by limiting dilution in 96 well plates (0.25/0.5/1.0
parasite per well). Genotypic analysis enabled selection of
independent pfeik1- clones for further phenotypic analysis.
Parasite culture and mosquito infection
Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 was cultured as previously described [27]. In brief, asexual cultures were maintained in complete RPMI at a haematocrit of 5%, between
0.5% and 10% parasitaemia. Asexual growth cycle was
analyzed by flow cytometric assessment of DNA content
as previously described [28]. Gametocytogenesis was
induced as described previously [29]; briefly, gametocyte
cultures were set up at 0.5–0.7% parasitaemia in 6% haematocrit (using human blood not more than 7 days after
the bleed), in an initial volume of 15 ml in 75 cm2 flasks.
Cultures were maintained for 4–5 days until 8–10% parasitaemia was reached and parasites appeared stressed,
after which the volume was increased to 25 ml. For each
clone a mixture of day 14 and day 17 gametocyte cultures
were fed to Anopheles gambiae, through membrane feeders
as described [29]. Female mosquitoes were dissected 10
days post-infection and midguts examined by light microscopy for presence of oocysts. Sporozoite invasion of salivary glands was assessed by removal of salivary glands 16
days post-infection and examination by light microscopy.
DNA was extracted from oocyst-positive midguts using
previously published methods [30]. Fisher's exact test was
used to compare infection prevalence between oocyst and
sporozoite stages, where appropriate.

Preparation of parasite pellets
Parasite pellets were obtained by saponin lysis: erythrocytes were centrifuged at 1300 g for 2 min. at room temperature, washed in an equal volume of Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS), pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 1300 g
for 2 min. at 4°C. Erythrocytes were lysed on ice by resuspension and repeated pipetting in 0.15% saponin in PBS.
The PBS volume was then increased and parasites recovered by centrifugation at 5500 g for 5 min., at 4°C. After
two washes in PBS, the parasite pellets were stored at 80°C.
Plasmodium falciparum amino acid starvation assay
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 parasites and clonal lines of
pfeik1- and pfeik2- parasites were synchronized to the late
ring stage, cultured in complete RPMI at 2% haematocrit,
and grown to approximately 8 – 10% parasitaemia. The
parasites were washed two times in 1× PBS, equally partitioned and washed with either complete RPMI or RPMI
medium lacking amino acids, after which, the parasites
were re-plated in their respective medium. The plates were
incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 5 hours. After 5 hours,
one culture maintained in amino acid free medium was
supplemented with complete RPMI, and re-incubated at
37°C for an additional 45 minutes. Post-incubation, the
parasites were isolated by tetanolysin (List Biological)
treatment, washed with 1× PBS buffer containing Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 2 mM NaF,
and 2 mM Na3VO4. Samples were resuspended in 2× SDSLaemmli buffer. Parasite proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting.
Antibodies and immunoblotting
Rabbit anti-phosphorylated eIF2α (Ser 51) was purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Rat antiBiP was acquired from the Malaria Research and Reference
Reagent Resource Center (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Secondary antibodies used were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). For immunoblotting, nitrocellulose
membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-0.1%
Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature. Rabbit
anti-phosphorylated eIF2α (Ser 51) was diluted 1:1000 in
TBST. Rat anti-BiP was diluted 1:10,000 in TBST. Respective secondary antibodies were diluted 1:20,000. Bound
antibodies were detected with Western Lightning™
Chemiluminescence reagent (Perkin Elmer).
Southern blotting
To obtain genomic DNA, parasite pellets were resuspended in PBS and treated with 150 μg/ml proteinase K
and 2% SDS at 55°C for 4 hours. The DNA was extracted
using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and
precipitated in ethanol with 0.3 M sodium acetate at 20°C. Restriction digests were carried out with HindIII.

Probes were labelled with alkaline phosphatase using the
Gene Images AlkPhos Direct Labelling kit (Amersham).

Results and Discussion
Stress-dependent phosphorylation of the P. falciparum
eIF2α orthologue
BLASTP searches of PlasmoDB using metazoan eIF2α
sequences were used to identify PF07_0117 as the P. falciparum orthologue, which was confirmed by reciprocal
analysis. The alignment of P. falciparum eIF2α with
sequences from T. gondii, human, rice and E. cuniculi is
shown in Figure 1A. Overall, the P. falciparum sequence
shares ~70% identity with T. gondii eIF2α and ~50%,
~40% and ~28% with the orthologues in humans, rice

and E. cuniculi, respectively. Importantly, the serine that is
targeted for phosphorylation is conserved in all species.
Furthermore, eIF2α contacts the kinase through a large
number of residues that interact with the surface of the
kinase domain. These residues are also conserved in most
species, as are residues that protect the regulatory serine
from the activity of other kinases [31] (Figure 1A); interestingly, several of these are not conserved in the E.
cuniculi orthologue, which is consistent with the absence
of eIF2α kinases in this organism [21].
The presence of the target serine residues, and of residues
which in other species are involved in interaction with
eIF2α kinases, suggests that PfeIF2α may be regulated by

Growth of the parasites was continued up to 5 hours at 37°C in either complete RPMI medium (CM) or in RPMI lacking amino
acids (-AA). CM was added back to one amino acid-deprived culture, and re-incubated for an additional 45 minutes. Total
lysates from the parasites were prepared for SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphorylated
eIF2α (anti-phospho eIF2α) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, BiP (anti-BiP), which served as the loading control.

phosphorylation under stress conditions. To test this
hypothesis, cultured intraerythrocytic parasites were
starved of amino acids, and the phosphorylation status of
PfeIF2α was monitored by western blot using an antibody
that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form
(Ser51) of human eIF2α, reasoning that the high level of
sequence conservation between the human and plasmodial sequences would allow cross-reaction of the antibody
(Figure 1B). Indeed, the antibody recognized the expected
37-kDa band in parasite extract, and the intensity of the
signal was considerably stronger in the lane containing
extracts from parasites that had been stressed by aminoacid starvation than in extracts from unstressed parasites,
despite equal quantities of the eIF2α factor (as quantitated with a non-phosphodependent antibody). Furthermore, this effect was removed by restoring the amino
acids in the culture medium. This demonstrates that the P.
falciparum equivalent residue of human eIF2α Ser51 is
phosphorylated in response to starvation.
Identification of eIF2α kinases in P. falciparum
Bioinformatics approaches were then used to identify P.
falciparum protein kinase(s) potentially responsible for
this response. An analysis of the complete complement of
P. falciparum protein kinases [10] identified a distinct phylogenetic cluster of three sequences, PF14_0423,
PFA0380w and PFF1370, the latter of which (called
PfPK4) had previously been characterized as an eIF2α
kinase [22]. Reciprocal BLASTP analysis using the putative
catalytic domains as queries confirmed the homology of
these three genes with the eIF2α kinase family. A Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) was used to generate an alignment
of the three P. falciparum sequences with those of human
eIF2α kinases; sequences of kinases from other families
were included as outgroups. The resulting alignment was
used to generate a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A), which
clearly shows that the three P. falciparum genes cluster
with the eIF2α kinases, as opposed to other kinase families, confirming their relatedness to this family. Interestingly PfeIK1 (PF14_0423), on which the present study
focuses, clusters most closely with GCN2, which is suggestive of a role in response to nutrient levels.

The PF14_0423 gene model proposed in PlasmoDB [32]
predicts a single intron that falls close to the 5' end of the
sequence so that the kinase domain is encoded entirely
within the second exon. All the residues that are required
for catalytic activity [33] are present in the kinase domain,
suggesting the gene encodes an active enzyme. The
sequence shares the feature of insertions within the catalytic domain with other eIF2α kinases [34] (Figures 2B
and 2C). Three of the human eIF2α kinases have N-terminal extensions containing regulatory domains; the fourth,
GCN2, has extensions on either side of the kinase domain
(reviewed in [35]). As PfeIK1 has extensions on both sides

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/99

of the catalytic domain, it is most similar to GCN2 not
only in the sequence of its catalytic domain, as the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A) demonstrates, but also in overall
structure (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the C-terminal extension of PfeIK1 contains an "anti-codon binding" domain
(Superfamily entry SSF52954) that may mediate binding
to uncharged tRNAs, a function that is performed in
GCN2 by the HisRS domain present in the C-terminal
extension (Figure 1C) [18]. This adds weight to the possibility that PfeIK1 is involved in the response to amino
acid starvation, like GCN2. The other functional domains
present in the GCN2 extensions were not recognisable in
PfeIK1.
Kinase activity of recombinant PfeIK1
In order to verify that the pfeik1 gene encodes a functional
kinase, the catalytic domain was expressed as a GST fusion
protein in E. coli. A recombinant protein of the expected
size (76 kDa) was obtained and purified for use in kinase
assays. The protein appeared as a doublet in most preparations, with both bands reacting with an anti-GST antibody. Kinase assays were performed with α- or β-casein as
substrates, in the presence or absence of GST-PfeIK1 (Figure 3A). A weak signal was detectable with β-casein on the
autoradiogram even in the absence of the kinase, indicating a low level of contaminating kinase activity in the substrate itself. This signal was much stronger in the presence
of GST-PfeIK1, and a signal was also observed with αcasein, which was not labelled in the absence of the
kinase. Furthermore, a signal at a size matching that of the
upper band in the GST-PfeIK1 doublet was also seen, indicating possible autophosphorylation, an established
property of at least some mammalian eIF2α kinases,
including GCN2 [34,36-38]. GCN2 autophosphorylation
occurs on two threonine residues in the activation loop
[36], only one of which conserved in PfeIK1 (Figure 2B).
Autophosphorylation was more clearly seen in the
absence of any exogenous substrate (Figure 3B). The possible functional relevance of PfeIK1 autophosphorylation
remains to be determined. Taken together, these data suggest that PfeIK1 possesses catalytic activity. To ensure that
the signals were not due to co-purified activities from the
bacterial extract, the assays were repeated using a catalytically inactive mutant (Lys458→Met) of GST-PfeIK1. These
reactions yielded an identical pattern as the reaction containing no recombinant kinase (Figure 3A), confirming
that the phosphorylation of the caseins is due to GSTPfeIFK1, and that the recombinant kinase can autophosphorylate.

In order to establish whether PfeIK1 is an eIF2α kinase as
predicted, its activity was tested towards recombinant P.
falciparum eIF2α expressed as a 64 kDa GST fusion. Figure
3B (left lane) shows that GST-PfeIK1 can phosphorylate
wild-type GST-PfeIF2α. The signal appears very weak,

kinase domains and regions with no identified function are white. Additional characterized domains of GCN2 are as follows:
red; N-terminal GCN1 binding domain (GB), green; pseudo-kinase domain (ΨKD), blue; histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS), yellow; ribosome binding and dimerisation domain (RB/DD).

which may be explained by the fact that the recombinant
kinase contains only the catalytic domain and may not
mimic the enzyme in a fully activated, physiological status. Indeed, an activation mechanism for GCN2 has been
proposed [37], in which a conformational alteration of
the so-called "hinge region" of the catalytic domain is
induced by uncharged tRNA binding to the HisRS
domain, which would favour productive binding of ATP
to the active site. Such a positive effect of the regulatory
domain would not be possible with GST-PfeIK1, since it
contains only the catalytic domain.
Consistent with the hypothesis that PfeIK1 may regulate
translation through PfeIF2α phosphorylation, mutation
of the predicted target for phosphorylation in the substrate (Ser59→Ala) prevents labelling with the recombinant enzyme (Figure 3B).
Generation of pfeik1- clones
Microarray data available in PlasmoDB [1,39] indicate
that pfeik1 is expressed in asexual parasites; it can be
hypothesized that the kinase plays a role in the parasite's
stress response, and may therefore (i) not be essential for
the asexual cycle, and (ii) be involved in regulation of
gametocytogenesis, similar to the function of a eIF2α
kinase in T. gondii stage transition from tachyzoite to
bradyzoite. P. falciparum clones that do not express PfeIK1
were generated to test these hypotheses. The strategy used
to disrupt expression of the kinase relies on single crossover homologous recombination, and has been used successfully to knock-out other P. falciparum protein kinase
genes [40,41]. Briefly, a plasmid based on the pCAM-BSD
vector [26] containing a cassette conferring resistance to
blasticidin and an insert comprising the central region of
the PfeIK1 catalytic domain, was transferred by electroporation into asexual parasites of the 3D7 clone. Homologous recombination is expected to generate a pseudo-

diploid locus in which neither of the two truncated copies
encodes a functional kinase: the 5' copy lacks an essential
glutamate residue in subdomain VIII and all downstream
sequence including the 3'UTR; the 3' copy lacks the both
the promoter region and the essential ATP orientation
motif in subdomain I (Figure 4A).
Blasticidin-resistant parasite populations were obtained
and shown by PCR analysis to contain parasites whose
pfeik1 locus was disrupted. Clonal lines deriving from two
independent transfection experiments were established
by limiting dilution, and their genotypes were analysed by
PCR (Figure 4B). The amplicon corresponding to the
wild-type locus was not detected in clones C1 and C8
(lane 1), but was observed in wild-type parasites (lane 5).
In contrast, PCR products that are diagnostic of both the
5' (lanes 3 & 7) and 3' (lanes 4 & 8) boundaries of the integrated plasmid were amplified from C8, but not 3D7 parasites (lanes 11 & 12). The C1 and C8 clones also yielded
a signal with primers that are specific for the transfection
plasmid, and detect retained episomes or integrated concatemers. Integration was verified by Southern blot analysis of HindIII-digested genomic DNA (Figures 4C and 4D);
the 12 kb band containing the wild-type locus is replaced
in clones C1 and C8 by the expected two bands (10.4 kb
and 6.8 kb) resulting from integration. The remaining 5.3
kb band is derived from linearized plasmid, or from digestion of concatemers of plasmid (which may or may not be
integrated into the chromosome). These results confirm
that the pfeik1 locus was indeed disrupted in clones C1
and C8, and demonstrate PfeIK1 is not required for completion of the asexual cycle in in vitro cultures. Additionally, asexual parasite cultures were synchronized and
carefully monitored through several life cycles; samples
were taken every 30 minutes and assessed for DNA content by flow cytometry [42]. No significant difference was
observed in asexual cycle duration of the parental 3D7

Disruption of previous page)
Disruption of the pfeik1 gene. A. Strategy for gene disruption. The transfection plasmid contains a PCR fragment spanning
positions 1467–2255 of the entire 4.8 kb pfeik1 coding sequence (as predicted on PlasmoDB). The fragment excludes two
regions essential for catalytic activity, labelled 'ATP' (a glycine-rich region required for orientation of ATP) and 'E' (a glutamate
residue required for structural stability of the enzyme). The positions of primers used for genotyping clones, and for nested
PCR to genotype oocsyts are indicated by numbered arrows. B: PCR analysis. Genomic DNA isolated from pfeik1- clones C1
and C8, and from 3D7 wild-type parasites, was subjected to PCR using the indicated primers (see Figure 4A for primer locations). Lanes 1, 5, 9: primers 1 + 2 (diagnostic for the wild-type locus); lanes 2, 6, 10: primers 3 + 4 (diagnostic for the pCAMBSD-PfeIK1 plasmid); lanes 3, 7, 11: primers 1 + 4 (diagnostic for 5' integration boundary); lanes 4,8,12: primers 3 + 2 (diagnostic for 3' integration boundary).

clone and that of pfeik1- parasites; cycle times of 49.0 h +/
- 0.5 and 49.2 h +/- 0.7, respectively, were measured (Figure 5).
eIF2α is not phosphorylated in pfeik1- clones during amino
acid starvation
To determine whether pfeik1- parasites were defective in
responding to amino acid-limitation, we cultured these
parasites in RPMI medium containing either all or no
amino acids and assayed for eIF2α phosphorylation
through western blot analysis (Figure 6). We observed
that pfeik1- parasites were unable to modulate the phosphorylation state of eIF2α in response to changing amino

acid conditions, in direct contrast to wild-type parental
clone 3D7. A further control was provided by performing
the assay using a parasite clone lacking PfeIK2, another
enzyme related to eIF2α kinases (see Figure 2A; a full characterisation of PfeIK2 and pfeik2- parasite clones is to be
published elsewhere). The pfeik2- parasites, which were
generated using the same strategy as that described here
for pfeik1 and were therefore also resistant to blasticidin,
readily phosphorylated eIF2α in amino acid starvation
conditions, like wild-type 3D7 parasites. This demonstrates that the abolition of eIF2α phosphorylation
observed in pfeik1- parasites is not due to non-specific
effects resulting from the genetic manipulations per-

pfeIK1- parasites do not phosphorylate eIF2α in amino acid-limiting conditions. pfeik1- clones C1 and E6, as well as
the 3D7 parent clone and a pfeik2- clone used as controls, were synchronized to the late ring stage and equally partitioned into
individual cultures. Growth of the parasites was continued up to 5 hours at 37°C in either complete RPMI (CM) or in RPMI
lacking amino acids (-AA). CM was added back to one amino acid-deprived culture, and re-incubated for an additional 45 minutes. Total lysates from the parasites were prepared for SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphorylated eIF2α (anti-phosho eIF2α). Antibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP (anti-BiP) served as the
loading control.
formed to obtain the mutant clones. Taken together, these
data identify PfeIK1 as a crucial regulator of amino acid
starvation stress response of intra-erythrocytic parasites.
pfeik1- clones are competent for sexual development and
mosquito infection
The pfeik1- parasites were able to differentiate into gametocytes (data not shown). Further, qualitative results
showed that pfeik1- male gametocytes were competent to
differentiate into gametes (in vitro exflagellation). To
investigate whether PfeIK1 plays an essential role in subsequent life cycle stages, mosquitoes were fed with cultures of pfeik1- gametocytes. The numbers of oocysts
associated with midguts dissected 10 days post-feeding,
and the numbers of mosquitoes with sporozoite-positive
salivary glands 16 days post-feeding, were then determined. This revealed that the complete sexual cycle can
occur in the absence of PfeIK1, resulting in formation of
oocysts and sporozoites (Table 1). Infection rates and
median numbers of oocysts per infected mosquito are low
relative to what is routinely observed in transmission
experiments with the wild-type clone 3D7. However, this
is to be expected from parasites that have been kept in
continuous culture for a long period of time; in the
present case it had taken ~7 months in culture to obtain
knockout clones suitable for mosquito infection experiments. Circumstantial evidence that low infection levels
are not a direct consequence of pfeik1 disruption is provided by the observation that our control for these experiments (mock-transfected 3D7 that had been cultured for

the same duration, in parallel to the pfeik1- parasites), had
completely lost the ability to produce gametocytes and
therefore infect mosquitoes. Importantly, to verify that
the parasites infecting the mosquitoes had not reverted to
the wild-type genotype, midguts from infected mosquitoes were collected 10 days post-feeding, from which total
DNA was extracted and used in nested PCR experiments.
The wild-type locus could be amplified from mosquitoes
infected with wild-type 3D7 parasites, but not from those
infected with pfeik1- C8 parasites (Figure 7, lower panel,
lanes 1, 3, 5). Conversely, the amplicon diagnostic of the
3' boundary of the integrated plasmid could only be
amplified from midguts of pfeik1- C8-infected mosquitoes, but not from mosquitoes infected with wild-type
parasites (lanes 2, 4, 8).
On the basis of the similarities between PfeIK1 and
GCN2, we hypothesized that PfeIK1 is involved in modulating the response to amino acid starvation depicted in
Figure 1B. That this is indeed the case was demonstrated
through a reverse genetics approach: parasites lacking
PfeIK1 do not phosphorylate eIF2α in response to aminoacid depletion (Figure 6). Future work will determine the
impact of PfeIK1 activation on both the rate of translation
and the possible selection of specific messages that are
translated under stress conditions. Overall, the data presented here suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation in
response to amino-acid starvation is not essential to parasite survival during the erythrocytic asexual cycle (at least

Analysis of the parasite genotypes in mosquito infections. Genomic DNA extracted from a wild-type 3D7infected mosquito and from two mosquitoes infected with
clone C8 was analysed by nested PCR; primer positions are
indicated in Fig. 3A. The inner PCR product is shown. Lanes
1, 3 & 5 are diagnostic for the wild-type locus (primers 1 + 2,
followed by 5 + 6). Lanes 2, 4 & 6 are diagnostic for the 3'
boundary of plasmid integration (primers 3 + 2, followed by
7 + 6). The 3D7 infected mosquito used here serves as a
control for PCR amplification of the wild-type locus from a
midgut, but came from a separate experiment and hence did
not provide a control for infection prevalence or intensity.

another protein kinase family, it was observed that disruption of the gene encoding one of the two P. falciparum
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), pfmap-1,
does not cause any detectable phenotype, but that pfmap1- parasites overexpress the second parasite MAPK, Pfmap2 [40]. A similar compensation mechanism may operate
between the three PfeIKs represented in the parasite
kinome (Figure 2A). Even though compensatory mechanisms to permit sexual differentiation are presumably less
likely to occur than those allowing the survival of asexual
parasites (because of the absence of a true selection pressure), it cannot be formally excluded that PfeIK1 plays a
role in gametocytogenesis in a wild-type parasite background. Investigating this possibility will require inducible and/or multiple knock-outs and the availability of
mono-specific antibodies to monitor the levels of each
PfeIK in parasites lacking one of them.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the P. falciparum
kinome includes three putative eIF2α kinases. One of
these, PfPK4, was previously shown to phosphorylate a
peptide corresponding to the target region of human
eIF2α [27]. It is demonstrated here that PfeIK1 is able to
phosphorylate the conserved regulatory site on the Plasmodium orthologue of the translation factor in vitro, and
that eIF2α phopshorylation in response to amino-acid
starvation does not occur in pfeik1- parasites. The present
study thus establishes that malaria parasites possess the
molecular machinery that pertains to stress-dependent
regulation of translation, and that this machinery is actually used in stress response.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Commitment to gametocytogenesis has been proposed to
be linked to stress response, and eIF2α might possibly be
involved in this process. At first sight, the data presented
here suggest that PfeIK1 does not regulate gametocytogenesis, since pfeik1- parasite are able to undergo sexual development. However, caution must be exercised, as
compensatory mechanisms can be at play in knock-out
parasites. Indeed, in a similar situation concerning
