Abstract
Background: The recently described Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) represents a new paradigm of protein secretion
in bacteria. A number of bioinformatic studies have been conducted to identify T6SS gene clusters in the available
bacterial genome sequences. According to these studies, Salmonella harbors a unique T6SS encoded in the Salmonella
Pathogenicity Island 6 (SPI-6). Since these studies only considered few Salmonella genomes, the present work aimed to
identify novel T6SS loci by in silico analysis of every genome sequence of Salmonella available.
Results: The analysis of sequencing data from 44 completed or in progress Salmonella genome projects allowed the
identification of 3 novel T6SS loci. These clusters are located in differentially-distributed genomic islands we designated
SPI-19, SPI-20 and SPI-21, respectively. SPI-19 was identified in a subset of S. enterica serotypes including Dublin,
Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis. In the later, an internal deletion eliminated most of the island. On the
other hand, SPI-20 and SPI-21 were restricted to S. enterica subspecies arizonae (IIIa) serotype 62:z4,z23:-. Remarkably,
SPI-21 encodes a VgrG protein containing a C-terminal extension similar to S-type pyocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
This is not only the first evolved VgrG described in Salmonella, but also the first evolved VgrG including a pyocin domain
described so far in the literature. In addition, the data indicate that SPI-6 T6SS is widely distributed in S. enterica and
absent in serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Agona, Javiana, Paratyphi B, Virchow, IIIa 62:z4,z23:- and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7).
Interestingly, while some serotypes harbor multiple T6SS (Dublin, Weltvreden and IIIa 62:z4,z23:-) others do not encode
for any (Enteritidis, Paratyphi B, Javiana, Virchow and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7)). Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate
that the 4 T6SS loci in Salmonella have a distinct evolutionary history. Finally, we identified an orphan Hcp-like protein
containing the Hcp/COG3157 domain linked to a C-terminal extension. We propose to designate this and related
proteins as "evolved Hcps".
Conclusion: Altogether, our data suggest that (i) the Salmonella T6SS loci were acquired by independent lateral transfer
events and (ii) evolved to contribute in the adaptation of the serotypes to different lifestyles and environments, including
animal hosts. Notably, the presence of an evolved VgrG protein related to pyocins suggests a novel role for T6SS in
bacterial killing. Future studies on the roles of the identified T6SS loci will expand our knowledge on Salmonella
pathogenesis and host specificity.

Background
The recently described Type VI Secretion System (T6SS)
represents a new paradigm of protein secretion in bacteria
maintaining pathogenic or symbiotic interactions with
eukaryotic organisms (reviewed in references [1-4]). In
this context, T6SSs have been linked to a variety of functions such as adherence, cytotoxicity, host-cell invasion,
biofilm formation, survival within macrophages, and persistence within the host [2,4].
T6SS are encoded in loci initially known as IAHP (IcmF
associated homologous protein) clusters. These gene clusters were characterized by the presence of approximately
15 ORFs surrounding a homolog of IcmF, a protein associated with type IV secretion in Legionella pneumophila [57]. In addition to the variable genetic architecture presented by IHAPs in several microbial genomes, low level
of sequence identity between components of the system
in different bacteria has hampered the identification of
new T6SS loci. In spite of this, in silico analyses identified
a set of 13 conserved proteins defined as the T6SS "core
components" [8]. These components carry a distinct COG
ID (Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins), most of
which are unique for T6SS function [1,8]. In addition,
there are 15 conserved accessory proteins widely distributed among T6SS loci that include specific transcriptional
and post-transcriptional regulators [8].
Most T6SS core components correspond to structural elements of the secretion machinery. The DotU and IcmF
homologs (COG3523 and COG3455, respectively) are
conserved inner membrane proteins essential for secretion [9,10]. A role for IcmF and DotU homologs in membrane stabilization of the T6SS apparatus has been
proposed based on observations made for homolog proteins involved in stabilization of the T4SS apparatus in L.
pneumophila [6]. The ClpV homologs (COG0542) belong
to the AAA+ family of ATPases and are hypothesized to
energize the system, enabling protein secretion [9,11,12].
Recently, it has been reported that V. cholerae ClpV interacts through its N-terminal domain with a tubular structure formed by VipA (IglA, COG3516) and VipB (IglB,
COG 3517), two conserved and essential T6SS components. Remodeling of VipA/VipB tubules by ClpV-mediated threading is crucial for type VI protein secretion [13].
In addition, it has been recently proposed that the VipA/
VipB structure corresponds to a structural and possibly
functional homolog of the tail sheath in bacteriophage
T4, as both structures present similar dimensions, symmetry and overall organization [14].
Several other T6SS core components resemble proteins of
bacteriophage origin. This is the case of the hemolysin
coregulated protein Hcp (COG3157), the valine-glycine
repeat protein VgrG (COG3501) and the gp25-like protein (COG3518), which are homologs to components of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

the tail and baseplate in bacteriophage T4 [14,15]. Interestingly, both Hcp and VgrG appear to be structural and
secreted components. Thus, the detection of both proteins
in culture supernatants has become an indicator of T6SS
functionality [10,16,17]. Some VgrG proteins known as
"evolved VgrGs" present a C-terminal extension including
"effector domains" that have been linked to a variety of
functions, such as crosslinking of host actin, degradation
of the peptidoglycan layer, and ADP-ribosylation of host
proteins [4,16]. The evolved VgrGs have been identified in
a limited number of bacteria and are usually encoded outside T6SS loci, scattered throughout the genome.
Following the initial characterization of IAHP clusters [5],
several in silico analyses have identified T6SS loci in bacterial genome sequences available. In 2008, a screen for
homologs to the conserved T6SS components VipA/IglA
and VipB/IglB identified 37 T6SS loci in 29 bacteria [1].
Later that year, a similarity search for orthologs of T6SS
components described in Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia mallei identified T6SS loci in 42
bacterial species [18]. Even though both analyses greatly
expanded the number of T6SS loci reported, they were
based on the detection of homologs to T6SS components
present in only three organisms, overlooking the existence
of phylogenetically distant T6SS loci. A more recent study
addressed this limitation by analyzing the presence of
conserved protein domains rather than orthologous proteins, to identify 176 T6SS loci from 92 different bacteria
[8].
The first report for a T6SS in Salmonella corresponds to the
genetic characterization of the Salmonella Pathogenicity
Island 6 (SPI-6), formerly known as SCI (Salmonella enterica centisome 7 island), which is adjacent to the tRNAencoding gene aspV [19]. SPI-6 is a ~47 kb genomic island
presenting a mosaic structure characterized by the presence of the saf and tcf fimbrial operons. Analysis of the
region upstream of the fimbrial operons revealed numerous ORFs encoding putative periplasmic, outer membrane and secreted proteins, suggesting that SPI-6
encoded a novel secretion system [19]. After the classification of SPI-6 as an IAHP locus [5] and the discovery of
T6SSs in V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa [9,20] it was clear
that SPI-6 encoded a T6SS, although there is no experimental evidence on the functionality of this system. Conflicting reports associate SPI-6 T6SS with Salmonella
pathogenesis. A S. Typhimurium mutant in STM0285
(IcmF homolog) presented an increased intracellular
growth in macrophages and was hypervirulent in BALB/c
mice [21]. On the other hand, mutations in STM0272
(ClpV homolog) and STM0291 (Rhs element) have been
reported to cause a ~30% reduction in the ability of S.
Typhimurium to replicate in macrophages [22]. In addition, overexpression of a dominant negative version of

STM0272 impaired the ability of S. Typhimurium to
invade epithelial cells [12].
Despite the recent advances in our understanding of the
structural and genomic organization of T6SS gene clusters,
every in silico analysis performed so far to identify these
loci in bacteria has taken into account a limited number
of the currently available Salmonella genome sequences.
Considering that many bacterial species harbor multiple
T6SS in their genomes, it is plausible to think that there
could be more than one T6SS in the genus Salmonella in
addition to SPI-6 T6SS waiting to be uncovered. In the
present work we performed a genome-wide in silico analysis of all currently available Salmonella genome sequences
to identify T6SS loci. Our analysis revealed the presence of
3 novel T6SS gene clusters encoded in differentially-distributed genomic islands presenting distinctive evolutionary histories.

Results and Discussion
Identification of T6SS gene clusters in Salmonella
Representatives of the 13 T6SS core components recently
defined by Boyer and coworkers [8] were used as baits to
identify T6SS loci by sequential BLASTN, BLASTP and
TBLASTX searches using all publicly available sequences
from 44 Salmonella genome sequencing projects (completed or in progress). The data analyzed included both
chromosome and plasmid sequences covering 24 different serotypes of Salmonella enterica (22 in subspecies I, 1
in subspecies IIIa and 1 in subspecies IIIb) (Additional
file 1).

To maximize the power of the screen, representatives of
each core component from 3 different organisms belonging to each of the different branches in phylogenetic trees
previously defined for T6SS loci [1,8] were used as baits.
The analysis revealed the presence of 3 novel T6SS loci in
addition to the gene cluster encoded within SPI-6 (Table
1). The novel T6SS gene clusters are located in 3 genomic
islands we have designated SPI-19, SPI-20 and SPI-21,
respectively. These islands are differentially distributed
among the Salmonella serotypes analyzed and contain
each of the 13 T6SS core components described to date
(Figure 1). Most Salmonella present a unique T6SS
encoded either by SPI-6 or SPI-19. On the other hand, a
limited number of Salmonella carry two T6SS, encoded
either by SPI-6 and SPI-19 or by SPI-20 and SPI-21.
Finally, no T6SS locus was identified in the available
genomes of S. enterica subspecies enterica (I) serotypes
Paratyphi B, Virchow and Javiana, and S. enterica subspecies diarizonae (IIIb) serotype 61:1,v:1,5,(7).

SPI-19 is a novel T6SS locus present in a subset of serotypes belonging to S. enterica subspecies enterica (I),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

including Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and
Enteritidis. Remarkably, serotypes Dublin and Weltevreden also carry the T6SS encoded in SPI-6, while serotype
Enteritidis only presents a truncated version of SPI-19 (see
below). The ORFs, product sizes, conserved protein
domains and genome coordinates of SPI-19 genes in serotypes Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis are detailed in Additional file 2.
The island corresponds to a ~45 kb element located in the
vicinity of a gene cluster encoding putative proteins
involved in sugar transport and utilization (STM1127 to
STM1133 in serotype Typhimurium), and is not directly
linked to a tRNA-encoding gene (see below). Although
the average G+C content of the island is similar to that of
the whole genome (e.g., 54.3% versus 52.2% in serotype
Gallinarum), the nucleotide content is not evenly distributed. For instance, regions of SPI-19 in serotype Gallinarum encoding Hcp-like proteins and proteins of
unknown function presents a low G+C content (34.5%),
while the rest of the island presents a G+C content significantly higher (59.1%).
SPI-19 encodes ~30 ORFs, including each T6SS core component (Figure 1 and Additional file 2). Notably, the
island includes two ORFs encoding Hcp-like proteins that
only share 27% of sequence identity (e.g., SG1029 and
SG1043 in serotype Gallinarum). We refer to these proteins as Hcp-1 and Hcp-2, respectively (Figure 1 and Additional file 2). Hcp-1 is encoded in a putative operon that
includes most of the T6SS functions. On the other hand,
Hcp-2 is encoded upstream of a VgrG homolog at the
opposite end of the island. This VgrG protein does not
present a C-terminal extension or a putative effector
domain. Additionally, the island includes 2 distantly
related ImpA homologs (e.g., SG1030 and SG1032 in
serotype Gallinarum), as reported for other T6SS loci [18].
SPI-19 does not encode transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators present in others T6SS gene clusters
[11,20], but encodes a protein containing the forkheadassociated (FHA) domain. It is known that an FHAdomain containing protein interacts with a Ser/Thr kinase
(PpkA) and a phosphatase (PppA) to regulate type VI
secretion in P. aeruginosa [11]. Although SPI-19 does not
encode kinases and phosphatases, the possible interaction
of the FHA-domain containing protein with other kinases
and phosphatases to regulate secretion by this T6SS cannot be ruled out. In addition to T6SS-related components,
a small "Sel1-like repeat protein" was identified in SPI-19
(Additional file 2). Serotypes Agona and Weltevreden
encode a full version of the protein (SeAg_B1116 and
SeW_A1263, respectively), while serotypes Enteritidis,
Gallinarum and Dublin encode different truncated forms
of it (SEN1008/SEN1009, SG1050/SG1051 and
SeD_A1237, respectively). Notably, SeAg_B1116 and
SeW_A1263 share ~31–38% sequence identity with sevPage 3 of 17

eral secreted Sel1-like proteins of L. pneumophila involved
in manipulation of vacuolar trafficking in macrophages
[23].
The genetic architecture of SPI-19 is highly conserved in
serotypes Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona and Gallinarum.
The main structural differences observed are circumscribed to the right end of the island, a region encoding a
variable number of proteins with unknown function
flanked by Rhs elements (Figure 2). Gene content variability in this region can be explained by deletions and rearrangements involving recombination events between Rhs
elements. In serotype Gallinarum we identified a small
ORF downstream of SG1040 that is absent in the genome
annotation. This ORF encodes a gp25-like protein
homolog to the T6SS-related ORF VCA0109 in V. cholerae
(Additional file 2), and is annotated in the genome of the
other SPI-19 positive serotypes.
In serotype Agona, the cluster of genes related to sugar
metabolism flanking the left end of SPI-19 is missing. The
absence of these genes has been reported previously [24].
The existence of 3 ORFs (SeAg_B1087 to SeAg_B1089)

encoding transposase remnants at this junction may be
related to the absence of these genes. In addition, SPI-19
in serotype Agona includes a third ImpA homolog
(SeAg_B1094) adjacent to a truncated second copy of
IcmF (SeAg_B1095). Probably, these ORFs were generated
by a duplication of neighboring genes encoding complete
versions of both ImpA and IcmF proteins (SeAg_B1098
and SeAg_B1099, respectively).
In serotype Enteritidis, SPI-19 presents an internal deletion of ~24 kb with respect to the island in serotypes Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona and Gallinarum (Figure 2). As the
result of this deletion, the island in Enteritidis only
encodes 16 ORFs, 3 of which correspond to T6SS core
components: SEN1002 (a putative Hcp-1 protein),
SEN1003 (an ImpA homolog) and SEN1004 (a truncated
form of IcmF). The absence of essential components suggests that the T6SS encoded in this serotype is not functional. Interestingly, the internal region of SPI-19 absent
in Enteritidis has been defined as the "region of difference
9" (ROD9) in a comparative genome analysis of serotypes
Gallinarum and Enteritidis [25]. It is tempting to speculate that the presence of an active T6SS is somehow related

to differences in host adaptation presented by these serotypes.
As mentioned before, SPI-19 is not obviously linked to a
tRNA-encoding gene. Comparative genomic analyses
revealed that SPI-19 is located at the left junction of a large
chromosomal region (~900 to 960 kb, depending on the
serotype) inverted with respect to the genome of serotype
Typhimurium [25]. The right end of the inverted region is
flanked by a functional copy of the tRNA-encoding gene
serX. A more detailed sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 109 bp-long scar located at the left border of SPI19 in the genomes of serotypes Dublin, Weltevreden,
Gallinarum and Enteritidis. In serotype Agona, the last 48
nucleotides of the scar are lost. Notably, in each case the
scar includes 15 nt in the 3' end of serX. Thus, a truncated
version of serX is flanking the left end of SPI-19. These
observations suggest that SPI-19 was originally inserted at
the 3' end of serX, being flanked by a truncated and a functional copy of this tRNA-encoding gene. A posterior inversion event repositioned the functional copy of serX to a
location distant from SPI-19 in the genome of serotypes
Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis.
It has been reported that insertions of new horizontally
acquired genetic material could trigger compensating
genomic rearrangements in order to maintain genome stability [26]. Thus, the acquisition of SPI-19 could be one of
the events leading to the observed inversion. These events
must have occurred after the divergence of serotype Typhimurium and a common ancestor of serotypes encoding
SPI-19.
Subspecies arizonae (IIIa) encodes two novel T6SS gene
clusters
Besides SPI-6 T6SS and SPI-19, two additional T6SS loci
were identified in Salmonella. The novel gene clusters, now
designated SPI-20 and SPI-21, are present only in the
genome of S. enterica subspecies arizonae (IIIa) serotype
62:z4,z23:-. Notably, SPI-6 and SPI-19 are not encoded in
the genome of this serotype.

SPI-20 corresponds to a ~34 kb genomic island encoding
28 ORFs (SARI_02707 to SARI_02736, coordinates
2617346-2651626) with an average G+C content of
53.1%. Seventeen ORFs related to T6SS function were
identified, 13 of which correspond to core components
(Figure 1 and Additional file 3). Among the T6SS-related
components, the island encodes an Hcp-like protein
(SARI_02729) and a VgrG protein with no C-terminal
extension (SARI_02724). In addition, 3 ImpA homologs
were identified: SARI_02718, SARI_02719 and
SARI_02709 (Additional file 3). Sequence analyses
revealed that SARI_02718 and SARI_02719 encode truncated proteins corresponding to the C-terminal and N-terminal of an ImpA homolog, respectively. Most probably,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

both ORFs were generated as the result of a point mutation that introduced a stop codon in SARI_02719. On the
other hand, SARI_02709 encodes an ImpA homolog distantly related to SARI_02719/SARI_02718. SPI-20
encodes neither transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulators nor FHA-domain containing proteins present in
other T6SS loci [11,20]. As in the case of SPI-19, the G+C
content of SPI-20 is not uniformly distributed. While
most of the island has a G+C content of 55–60%, regions
with low G+C content (~42%) encoding proteins with
unknown function were detected. Although SPI-20 is
located in the proximity of the tRNA-encoding gene aspV
(Figure 3), the island is not flanked by obvious direct
repeats. Interestingly, aspV corresponds to the insertion
site of SPI-6 in many serotypes of S. enterica, indicating
that different T6SS have been acquired at the same
genomic location during Salmonella evolution.
SPI-21 is a second island encoding a T6SS in the genome
of serotype IIIa 62:z4,z23:-. This island has an extension
of ~55 kb and is delimited by transposase remnants
(Additional file 4). Again, the average G+C content of the
island (49.6%) is unevenly distributed, presenting regions
with low G+C content (41.3%) encoding hypothetical
proteins of unknown function and regions with higher
G+C content (54.3%) encoding T6SS-related ORFs. SPI21 is flanked by 2 horizontally acquired genetic elements
(Figure 3). Adjacent to its right junction, a cryptic lambdoid phage (SARI_02636 to SARI_02688) is inserted at
the 3' end of thrW. This tRNA-encoding gene corresponds
to the insertion site of P22 and related phages in Salmonella [27]. In addition, a small genomic island encoding 8
ORFs (SARI_2570 to SARI_02577) was found in the vicinity of the left junction of SPI-21. Five of these ORFs share
extensive homology to ORFs in SPI-14 (STM0855 to
STM0859 in serotype Typhimurium), initially described
as a locus encoding genes required for full virulence of
serotype Gallinarum in chickens [28].
SPI-21 includes 57 ORFs (SARI_02578 to SARI_02635,
coordinates 2504768-2560524), 20 of which encode
T6SS-related components (Figure 1 and Additional file 4).
Among the ORFs not linked to T6SS, a putative chitinase
(SARI_02620) and a protein (SARI_02608) containing
the PASTA (penicillin-binding protein and Ser/Thr kinase
associated) domain [29] were identified. Notably, SPI-21
presents additional ORFs linked to T6SS besides the core
components shared with SPI-20. Hence, the island
encodes not one but two VgrG proteins without C-terminal extension (SARI_02599 and SARI_02626). In addition, SPI-21 encodes an evolved VgrG protein
(SARI_02603) containing a C-terminal extension that
presents two conserved domains: COG5529 (S-type
pyocin family) and PF01844 (HNH endonucleases) (Figure 4A). This constitutes one of the main findings of the

present study as this is not only the first evolved VgrG
described in Salmonella, but also the first evolved VgrG
including a pyocin domain described so far in the literature. The C-terminal extension in SARI_02603 shares
extensive sequence identity with the uropathogenic specific protein (Usp), a putative S-type pyocin encoded by
UPEC strains [30] (Figure 4B). S-type pyocins are protease-sensitive, colicin-like bacteriocins produced by P.
aeruginosa strains. These bacteriocins are normally constituted by two proteins: a large component that carries the
killing activity and a small component that serves as an
immunity protein [31]. Noteworthy, SPI-21 includes 4
ORFs encoding putative colicin/pyocin immunity proteins (SARI_02581, SARI_02585, SARI_02586 and
SARI_02602), one of which is encoded just downstream
of SARI_02603 (Additional file 4). Altogether, the presence of putative bacteriocin immunity proteins and an
evolved VgrG with potential bacteriocin activity in SPI-21
suggests for the first time that bacteria could use a T6SS to
kill other bacteria.
The SPI-6 T6SS gene cluster is widely distributed in
Salmonella enterica
As mentioned before, the only T6SS identified to date in
Salmonella is located in SPI-6, a pathogenicity island that
also encodes the Saf and Tcf fimbrial systems [19,32]. The
presence of the T6SS associated to SPI-6 was confirmed in
16 of the genomes surveyed, all of them belonging to S.
enterica subspecies enterica (I). This group includes serotypes Typhimurium, Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi C,
Kentucky, Newport, Heidelberg, Saintpaul, Schwarzengr-

und, Tennessee, Hadar, Infantis, Choleraesuis, Weltevreden, Dublin and I 4, [5], 12:i:- (Table 1). The ORFs,
product sizes, conserved protein domains and genome
coordinates of SPI-6 T6SS genes in representative strains
of the mentioned serotypes are detailed in Additional file
5. Furthermore, the presence of the saf fimbrial operon
was also detected in each of these serotypes, and the additional presence of the tcf fimbrial operon was confirmed
in serotypes Paratyphi A, Choleraesuis and Typhi. This
indicates that the 16 serotypes encoding the T6SS within
SPI-6 harbor a complete version of this pathogenicity
island.
Depending on the serotype, SPI-6 T6SS corresponds to a
region of ~35 to 50 kb that encodes ~30 to 45 ORFs,
including each of the 13 T6SS core components (Figure 1
and Additional file 5). Noteworthy, critical T6SS components in many SPI-6 T6SS are encoded by pseudogenes, as
the case of SciI (VipB homolog) in serotype Typhi, and
SciG (ClpV homolog) in serotypes I 4,[5],12:i:- and Choleraesuis (Additional file 5). This observation suggests that
these T6SS are not functional.
The genetic architecture of SPI-6 T6SS is highly conserved
among serotypes (Figure 5 and Additional file 5). However, structural differences limited to 3 particular regions
in the island were observed. The first region is located
downstream of sciI (vipB homolog), and encodes a variable number of proteins with no known function and
embedded Hcp-like proteins. The obvious consequence of
such variability is the presence of either one or two copies

of Hcp-like proteins in different serotypes. The second
region is located downstream of sciS (icmF homolog) and
encodes a variable number of proteins with unknown
function. The third region is located downstream of vrgS
(vgrG homolog) and encodes a variable number of Rhs
elements. In contrast to SPI-19, the variability observed in
this region is not explained by deletions involving recombination between Rhs elements. More likely, different
serotypes have acquired a distinct repertoire of unrelated
Rhs-like elements.

Differences in the genetic structure of SPI-6 T6SS among
strains of the same serotype were only detected in the case
of S. Saintpaul. In this serotype, strain SARA29 presents a
~15 kb deletion in SPI-6 with respect to strain SARA23
(Figure 5). As the result of this deletion, SPI-6 T6SS in
SARA29 does not encode critical components such as SciS
(IcmF homolog), SciI (VipB homolog) and the two Hcplike proteins, suggesting that the only T6SS encoded in
this strain is not functional.

Figure architecture of SPI-6 T6SS in Salmonella enterica serotypes
Genetic 5
Genetic architecture of SPI-6 T6SS in Salmonella enterica serotypes. DNA-based comparison of SPI-6 T6SS in 13 different serotypes of S. enterica was performed by BLASTN analysis with WebACT and visualized with ACT software. The three
major regions presenting structural differences between serotypes are indicated.
The analysis also revealed that SPI-6 in serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Agona, Paratyphi B and Virchow does
not encode a T6SS (Table 1), but maintain the saf fimbrial
operon. Furthermore, SPI-6 in serotype Javiana neither
encodes a T6SS nor a fimbrial operon. These observations
support the notion that the T6SS and the associated fimbrial operons saf and tcf have been acquired independently during the evolution of Salmonella to produce a
complex SPI-6. A more detailed sequence analysis
revealed that SPI-6 in serotype Javiana only includes 5
ORFs, one of which corresponds to an ImpA-like protein
associated to the SPI-6 T6SS. Several additional remnants
of T6SS-related ORFs associated with SPI-6 were identified
in serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Agona, Paratyphi B
and Virchow (Additional file 6). The presence of these
remnant ORFs suggests that an ancestor of SPI-6 T6SS was
originally present in the genome of these serotypes, and
was subsequently lost during evolution. In addition, a
remnant of the first ORF in SPI-20 (and not linked to the
T6SS function) was identified within SPI-6 in serotypes
Gallinarum, Paratyphi B and Virchow (Additional file 6),
suggesting that an ancestor of SPI-20 may have been

present at this location. This hypothesis is supported by
the fact that the insertion site for both SPI-6 and SPI-20 in
Salmonella corresponds to the same tRNA-encoding gene,
aspV.
Organization of genes encoding core components in T6SS
loci
Boyer and coworkers identified three groups of T6SS core
components presenting a conserved genomic organization [8]. These conserved "modules" were defined by
computing the number of loci in which every pair of T6SS
core components (identified by their distinct COG ID)
could be co-transcribed. The first module includes
COG3521 (putative lipoprotein), COG3522, COG3455
(DotU) and COG3523 (IcmF). The second module
includes COG3516 (VipA), COG3517 (VipB) and
COG3157 (Hcp). The third module includes COG3518
(gp25-like protein), COG3519 (VasA) and COG3520 [8].
When we analyzed the conservation of these modules for
each T6SS locus in Salmonella, important differences were
identified:

Page 9 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:354

• In the first module, components COG3521,
COG3522 and COG3455 are linked in SPI-6 and SPI19, while COG3523 is disconnected. In contrast, only
COG3522 and COG3455 are linked in SPI-20 and
SPI-21, while both COG3521 and COG3523 are disconnected. Furthermore, SPI-21 includes a second
copy of COG3521 that is also unlinked to the proposed module.
• In the second module, COG3516 and COG3517 are
linked in the 4 Salmonella T6SS loci, while COG3157
(Hcp) is not linked to either COG3516 or COG3517.
In addition, both SPI-6 T6SS and SPI-19 encodes two
Hcp proteins in different regions of each T6SS locus.
Furthermore, in SPI-19 one of these ORFs (Hcp-1) is
located adjacent to COG3516, but in a divergent orientation, clearly indicating that COG3516/COG3517
and Hcp have evolved independently. This is consistent with the report of Hcp proteins involved in T6SS
function that are encoded outside the T6SS locus in V.
cholerae [20], and also to the presence of "orphan
Hcps" apparently unlinked to the T6SS function in Salmonella and other bacteria (see below).
• Finally, a conserved third module is present in SPI-6
T6SS and SPI-19. On the other hand, while COG3519
and COG3520 are linked in SPI-20 and SPI-21,
COG3518 is disconnected from the module. Furthermore, SPI-21 includes 2 additional copies of
COG3518 that are also disconnected from the module, and one from each other.
The similarities detected between modules in SPI-20 and
SPI-21 indicate a close phylogenetic relationship, while
differences between modules in SPI-6 T6SS, SPI-19 and
SPI20/SPI-21 suggest that these loci have been acquired
through independent horizontal transfer events, or have
evolved independently to perform specialized functions.
Comparative analysis of Salmonella T6SS gene clusters
A basic comparative analysis of the Salmonella T6SS loci
described in this study revealed that they share very limited homology one to each other at the DNA level (Additional file 7). This result supports the notion that these
genomic islands were acquired by independent horizontal gene transfer events during Salmonella evolution. To
identify evolutionary relationships between these T6SS
gene clusters, we followed the approach used by Bingle
and coworkers to study phylogeny between T6SS loci [1].
The concatenated aminoacidic sequences of conserved
components VipA and VipB from 66 T6SS loci (including
the original 37 loci used by Bingle and coworkers [1] and
22 loci representing every T6SS in Salmonella) were analyzed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

Notably, the T6SS loci in Salmonella differentially clustered in the mayor phylogenetic groups described for T6SS
gene clusters [1] (Figure 6). Thus, every SPI-6 T6SS locus
included in our analysis belongs to Group A, also including the T6SS gene clusters h16_A0645-h16_A0657 in Ralstonia eutropha strain H16 and tss-2 in Burkholderia
pseudomallei strain 1106a. This result agrees with previous
reports on the evolutionary relationship between SPI-6
T6SS in Typhimurium and tss-2 [1,8]. In addition, SPI-20
and SPI-21 belong to Group C, which includes the T6SS
cluster within PAI-metV in the uropathogenic E. coli
(UPEC) strain CFT073. Finally, each SPI-19 analyzed
belongs to Group D, also including the T6SS cluster
within OI#7 in E. coli O157:H7 strain Sakai, and the AGI1 island in the avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strain O1
(Figure 6). According to the nomenclature established in
a recent phylogenetic analysis performed by Boyer and
coworkers [8], SPI-6 T6SS, SPI-19 and SPI-20/SPI-21
belong to sub-groups III, I and II, respectively.
In a second analysis, we determined identity at the protein
level of each Salmonella T6SS gene cluster, as a whole, to
the closest phylogenetic relatives identified by our previous analysis. Notably, SPI-6 T6SS presented extensive
identity and shared a similar genetic architecture with
T6SS gene clusters tss-2 in B. pseudomallei and h16_A0645h16_A0657 in R. eutropha (Figure 7A). The same was true
for SPI-19 and the whole T6SS gene cluster within OI#7 in
EHEC and the AGI-1 island in APEC (Figure 7B). On the
other hand, SPI-20 and SPI-21 present several differences
with its relative T6SS within PAI-metV in UPEC (Figure
7C). Thus, although SPI-20 conserves the overall genetic
architecture of the T6SS locus in UPEC, the island includes
several additional ORFs encoding proteins of unknown
function (Additional file 3). In addition, SPI-21 presents
a genetic architecture similar to SPI-20 and to the T6SS
gene cluster in PAI-metV. Nevertheless, the island includes
additional embedded ORFs encoding multiple copies of
VgrG and gp25-like proteins, putative transposases, a
putative chitinase and colicin/pyocin immunity proteins
(Additional file 4). In spite of this, the phylogenetic proximity of SPI-20 and SPI-21 is evident.
The results obtained from both phylogenetic analyses
reached the same conclusions, validating the evaluation
of divergence in the aminoacidic sequence of VipA and
VipB homologs to determine phylogenetic relationships
between different T6SS loci. Altogether, these results
strongly suggest that SPI-6 T6SS, SPI-19 and SPI-20/SPI21 were acquired by independent horizontal transfer
events from several unrelated bacterial species during the
evolution of Salmonella. This is supported by the following observations: (i) each cluster is encoded in or corresponds to a genomic island that includes every T6SS core
component, (ii) SPI-6 T6SS and SPI-20 are located adja-

cent to the tRNA-encoding gene aspV, a known hot-spot
for insertion of genetic elements by horizontal transfer,
(iii) SPI-19 is linked to a large chromosomal inversion,
presumably caused by its insertion in the tRNA-encoding
gene serX, and (iv) SPI-6 T6SS, SPI-19 and SPI-20/SPI-21
belong to different T6SS phylogenetic groups (Figure 6).
Finally, the similar genetic organization presented by SPI20 and SPI-21 (Figure 1), the presence of conserved
regions sharing extensive sequence identity at the protein

level (Figure 7), and the fact that they belong to the same
T6SS phylogenetic group (Figure 6) support a common
origin for these T6SS loci. Thus, the presence of SPI-20
and SPI-21 in the genome of S. IIIa serotype 62:z4,z23:can be explained either as the result of the acquisition of
one of these clusters by lateral transfer and a posterior
duplication event, or by sequential lateral transfer of each
island from closely related donor organisms.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:354

We can hypothesize evolutionary origins for each T6SS
locus in Salmonella considering both phylogenetic analyses performed. Thus, SPI-6 T6SS may have been acquired
from a beta-proteobacteria in the Burkholderiaceae family,
related to Burkholderia pseudomallei and Ralstonia eutropha
(recently reclassified as Cupriavidus necator). In contrast,
SPI-19 seems to have been acquired from a pathogenic E.
coli strain related to EHEC and APEC. Finally, SPI-20 and
SPI-21 may have been acquired from a UPEC strain. In
any case, each T6SS locus seems to have further evolved
independently to generate systems performing specialized
functions.
Orphan Hcp-like proteins in Salmonella
Several ORFs encoding additional Hcp-like proteins in
Salmonella were identified in this study (Additional file 8).
Because these proteins are not directly linked to T6SS gene
clusters, we referred to them as "orphan Hcp-like proteins". According to their distribution, these proteins can
be attributed to three major groups: (i) those present in
every S. enterica serotype analyzed (e.g., STM4509.s and
STM3131 in serotype Typhimurium), (ii) an unique representative present only in serotypes Agona, Paratyphi A,
Kentucky and Typhi (e.g, SeAg_B3284 in serotype Agona),
and (iii) those present only in S. IIIa serotype 62:z4,z23:(i.e., SARI_00061, SARI_00912, SARI_01363 and
SARI_03217). The genomic location and distinctive features of each of these proteins are detailed in Additional
file 8.

Homologs of STM4509.s and STM3131 are widely distributed among S. enterica serotypes. Noteworthy, STM4509.s
corresponds to HilE, a 148 aa protein that negatively regulates the expression of hilA, which encodes the master
regulator controlling the expression of SPI-1 T3SS in Salmonella [33]. Folkesson and coworkers were the first to
identify a similarity between HilE and Hcp proteins
encoded in SPI-6 [19]. On the other hand, STM3131 corresponds to a 161 aa protein with no known function
encoded in SPI-13, a locus including genes required for
full virulence of serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum and
Typhimurium in different animal hosts [28,34,35]. The
genes encoding STM3131 and STM3130 constitute a
small operon predicted to be part of the PmrAB regulon
[36]. Remarkably, STM3130 belongs to a family of proteins including the baseplate gp25 protein in phage T4
and relatives of a conserved T6SS core component [8].
As mentioned, an orphan Hcp-like protein present only in
serotypes Kentucky, Paratyphi A, Agona and Typhi was
also identified. Depending on the serotype, this orphan
Hcp corresponds to a protein of either 40 or 66 aa. In all
cases, this small ORF is encoded in SPI-8 and is located
downstream of an integrase remnant in the vicinity of the
tRNA-encoding gene pheV. Finally, S. IIIa 62:z4,z23:- har-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

bors four additional orphan Hcp-like proteins, each of
them placed adjacent to transposase remnants or regions
acquired by lateral gene transfer. Notably, SARI_03217
corresponds to an unusually long Hcp-like protein (403
aa versus ~160 aa in regular Hcp proteins) containing the
Hcp/COG3157 domain at the N-terminus (150 aa) and a
C-terminal extension (253 aa) including no conserved
protein domain.
There are reports of other unusually long Hcp proteins
carrying C-terminal extensions due to acquisition of novel
protein domains. This is the case of Usp, a putative bacteriocin related to S-type pyocins containing an Hcp
domain at the N-terminus [30]. To date, there is no experimental evidence confirming the putative bactericidal
activity of Usp or explaining the role played by the Hcp
domain in its function. However, the usp gene has been
widely used as a virulence marker in UPEC strains [37-39].
Another example corresponds to the hypothetical protein
YhhZ of E. coli. This protein also contains an Hcp domain
at the N-terminus and a degenerate HNH domain at the
C-terminus. The yhhZ gene has been reported to be
induced during growth of E. coli in biofilms [40]. The
structural features presented by these long Hcp proteins
(i.e. an Hcp/COG3157 domain linked to an additional Cterminal domain) resemble those presented by the
evolved VgrG proteins. Because of this similitude, we propose to designate these proteins as "evolved Hcps". Apparently, both Usp and YhhZ correspond to evolved Hcps not
linked to T6SS function and seem to serve different roles
for the bacterial cell. This could also be the case for
SARI_03217 in S. IIIa 62:z4,z23:-.
In order to identify evolutionary relationships between
these orphan Hcp-like proteins and those directly linked
to T6SS loci, the sequence divergence among these proteins was analyzed. As a reference, 5 Hcp proteins
described in P. aeruginosa strain PA01 (PA0263, PA1512,
PA5267, PA2367 and PA0085) and 2 described in V. cholerae strain V52 (VCA_0017 and VC_1415) were included
in the analysis. The results revealed the presence of 4
groups of Hcp relatives (Figure 8). Group A includes
PA0085 and every Hcp protein encoded in SPI-6 T6SS.
Group B includes PA2367 and every STM3131 homolog.
Group C includes only HilE homologs, and Group D
includes PA1512, PA5267, PA0263, VCA_0017,
VC_1415, Hcp proteins in SPI-19, SPI-20, SPI-21, and the
orphan Hcp-like proteins in S. IIIa 62:z4,z23:- (Figure 8).
Although evolutionary relationships between Hcp-like
proteins were determined, the analysis failed to predict a
role for many of them in T6SS function. We believe that
this reflects the fact that the Hcp domain is linked to a particular folding pattern or structure rather than to a specific
function or activity. Altogether, our data support the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/354

notion that SARI_03217 and HilE homologs arose from a
common ancestor of every Hcp protein and further
evolved to gain new functions, while keeping structural
properties of its relatives directly linked to T6SS function.

Conclusion
This study expands the current knowledge on bacterial
type VI secretion by the identification and description of
3 novel T6SS loci in Salmonella. We have determined that
each T6SS locus has a distinct evolutionary history, indicating acquisition through independent horizontal gene
transfer events. Interestingly, while some serotypes harbor
multiple T6SS loci others do not encode for any. This
observation indicates that T6SS function is not essential
for virulence but may provide an additional advantage in
certain environments. On the other hand, the presence of
2 T6SS in many serotypes perhaps reflects specific roles for
each of them in different steps during infection or in different environments or hosts. Our analysis also identified
an evolved VgrG protein that contains a C-terminal extension sharing identity to S-type pyocins. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first description of a VgrG protein
carrying a bacteriocin effector domain and suggests a
novel role for T6SS in bacterial killing. The functionality
of the 4 T6SS described here and their roles in Salmonella
pathogenesis and host-specificity are currently under
study in our laboratory.

subspecies IIIa and 1 in subspecies IIIb). Genome accession numbers and information about the Salmonella
genome sequencing projects utilized in this work are
detailed in the Additional file 1.
In silico identification of T6SS loci
Nucleotide sequence of ORFs representing T6SS core components were obtained from public sequence databases.
Three representatives of each branch in T6SS phylogenetic
trees previously described [1,8] (Additional file 9) were
used as baits in sequential BLASTN, BLASTP and TBLASTX
searches [43-45] to identify T6SS homologs in the 44 Salmonella genomic sequences listed in Additional file 1.
When a core component was identified, a systematic analysis was performed to detect adjacent T6SS components.
A T6SS locus was defined as a gene cluster encoding at
least 5 core components. Boundaries of the genomic
islands encoding T6SS were defined by thorough nucleotide sequence analysis. A systematic analysis of gene content and genetic architecture of the whole T6SS gene
clusters identified was performed for 31 annotated and
fully assembled genomes. The remaining 13 genomes correspond to unfinished projects; therefore in many cases an
exhaustive ORF-by-ORF analysis of T6SS genetic architecture was not possible. In this case, we only determined the
presence/absence status for T6SS core components in
unassembled contigs.
DNA and protein sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the sequence visualization and annotation tool Artemis version 10 [46]
and the Vector NTI Advanced software version 11.0 (Invitrogen). Graphical representations of T6SS gene clusters
were generated with the CLC Sequence Viewer software
version 6.0.2 (CLC bio). For comparative analysis, nucleotide sequences were aligned by BLASTN and TBLASTX
with the WebACT online resource ([47], web site: http://
www.webact.org/) and visualized with the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) release 6 [48]. Presence of conserved
protein domains in each ORF encoded in the identified
T6SS loci was determined by cross-reference of several
publicly available databases: The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) ([49], web site: http://
smart.embl.de/), the Conserved Domain Database and
Search Service version 2.16 ([50], web site: http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) and the
Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) database ([51], web site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
COG ).

Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version
4.0.2 [52] based on the approach described by Bingle and
coworkers [1]. In the case of T6SS loci, the concatenated
aminoacidic sequences of VipA and VipB homologs
encoded in 66 T6SS loci (Additional file 10) were aligned
using ClustalW [53] with the default parameters. A similar
alignment was carried out using 113 Hcp-like proteins
from strains representing each serotype of Salmonella studied, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA01 and Vibrio cholerae
strain V52 (Additional file 8). Phylogenetic trees were
built from the alignments by the bootstrap test of phylogeny (3,000 replications) using the neighbor-joining
method with a Poisson correction model.
