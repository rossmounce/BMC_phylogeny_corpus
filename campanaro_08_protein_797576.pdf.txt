Abstract
Background: Abyssal microorganisms have evolved particular features that enable them to grow
in their extreme habitat. Genes belonging to specific functional categories are known to be
particularly susceptible to high-pressure; therefore, they should show some evidence of positive
selection. To verify this hypothesis we computed the amino acid substitution rates between two
deep-sea microorganisms, Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Shewanella benthica KT99, and their
respective shallow water relatives.
Results: A statistical analysis of all the orthologs, led to the identification of positive selected (PS)
genes, which were then used to evaluate adaptation strategies. We were able to establish "Motility"
and "Transport" as two classes significantly enriched with PS genes. The prevalence of transporters
led us to analyze variable amino acids (PS sites) by mapping them according to their membrane
topology, the results showed a higher frequency of substitutions in the extra-cellular compartment.
A similar analysis was performed on soluble proteins, mapping the PS sites on the 3D structure,
revealing a prevalence of substitutions on the protein surface. Finally, the presence of some flagellar
proteins in the Vibrionaceae PS list confirms the importance of bacterial motility as a SS9 specific
adaptation strategy.
Conclusion: The approach presented in this paper is suitable for identifying molecular adaptations
to particular environmental conditions. The statistical method takes into account differences in the
ratio between non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, thus allowing the detection of the
genes that underwent positive selection. We found that positive selection in deep-sea adapted
bacteria targets a wide range of functions, for example solute transport, protein translocation,
DNA synthesis and motility. From these data clearly emerges an involvement of the transport and
metabolism processes in the deep-sea adaptation strategy of both bathytypes considered, whereas
the adaptation of other biological processes seems to be specific to either one or the other. An
important role is hypothesized for five PS genes belonging to the transport category that had been
previously identified as differentially expressed in microarray experiments. Strikingly, structural
mapping of PS sites performed independently on membrane and soluble proteins revealed that
residues under positive selection tend to occur in specific protein regions.

Background
During the last 30 years, a variety of extremophiles have
been isolated from abyssal and hadal environments in
diverse locations [1]. These habitats are of particular interest since they are characterized by high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, lack of nutrients and absence of
light. Recently, deep sea adaptation has been investigated
by sequencing two genomes of psychropiezophilic bacteria which are considered in this study. These cold and
pressure-loving microorganisms are Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 [2] and Shewanella benthica strainKT99
[3], hereafter called SS9 and KT99. SS9 belongs to the
Vibrionaceae family and is a moderately piezophilic, γproteobacterium, extensively studied for its importance as
a model organism for deep-sea adaptation [4]. It was isolated from an amphipod in the Sulu Sea at 2551 m depth
and displays optimum growth at 28 MPa and 15°C. On
the other hand, KT99 is a deep-sea obligate piezophile
heterotroph, isolated from a sample taken at 9000 m
depth in the Tonga-Kermadec Trench in the Pacific Ocean
[3]. Both bacteria have a remarkable number of phylogenetically closely-related species that are adapted to shallow water conditions. In order to perform a comparative
genome analysis we considered only the species for which
complete genomes are available, namely V. parahaemolyticus, V. fisheri, V. vulnificus for the Vibrionaceae family and
S. baltica, S. oneidensis, S. frigidimarina for the Shewanellaceae family, all of which are mesophilic aquatic bacteria.
The Shewanella genus can be subdivided into two major
branches, the first one characterized by high-pressure
adapted species includes S. benthica and the other group
characterized by pressure-sensitive species contains S. baltica, S. oneidensis and S. frigidimarina [5]. A bioinformatic
procedure was applied independently on both families,
revealing a valuable number of orthologous genes in each
of the two bacterial taxa.
Genetic and biochemical experiments have revealed that
both physiological and structural adaptations are essential for high-pressure life. It has been demonstrated that
membrane lipids, proteins and solutes accumulation (piezolytes) can influence bacterial growth in deep sea environments [4]. Pressure effects on DNA replication and
topology, as well as on cell division, have also been widely
discussed as have the nature and regulation of genes that
are important for pressure-sensing and the relevance of
the transport process in piezophilic bacteria [6].
The object of this study is to further characterize the effect
of abyssal conditions on the evolution of SS9 and KT99
genomes. It is not obvious to establish the biological,
physical and chemical parameters that are relevant to protein adaptation because abyssal and shallow water environments are extremely different in term of pressure,
temperature, light and nutrients. This is an important

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/313

point to be considered when the two abyssal species
described in this paper are compared to phylogenetically
related mesophilic species for which our knowledge on
their optimal growth conditions is not always fully established. In fact, we are not able to exclude that other
parameters, different from hydrostratic pressure, play a
role in protein adaptation. Temperature, for example,
could influence our analysis as it is one of the parameters
that separates P. profundum SS9 from the other shallowwater bacteria considered in our comparison. This parameter has probably less influence in shewanellaceae comparison since growth curves determined for
shewanellaceae [5] indicate that only S. oneidensis can be
considered a mesophilic bacterium, whereas S. benthica, S.
frigidimarina and S. baltica are psychrophiles. Furthermore
all shallow-water bacteria considered in our comparison
contain the deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase gene
involved in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage,
whereas the SS9 and KT99 genomes do not code for this
enzyme, which is consistent, since there is a distinct
absence of sunlight in their normal deep sea environment.
In Table 1 are summarized the main features of the bacteria considered in our study. Growth optimum was
obtained from [7] for P. profundum SS9, from [8] for V.
parahaemolyticus, from [5] for S. baltica, S. benthica e S. frigidimarina, while growth data for S. oneidensis were kindly
provided by Daniel I. of the University Claude Bernard
(Lyon).
We investigated the presence of positively selected genes
in the two bacteria adapted to an abyssal environment,
using as a control the phylogenetically related mesophilic
species. The computation most frequently used to carry
out this analysis is the non-synonymous to synonymous
substitution rate ratio, defined omega (ω) [9,10]. In general, an excess of non-synonymous substitutions (dN)
over synonymous substitutions (dS) is considered a clear
indicator of positive natural selection, because non-synonymous mutations are typically subject to strong purifying selection, whereas synonymous changes are typically
neutral.
It should be considered that if we take any two species we
would expect to find some genes that underwent positive
selection due to the respective evolutionary history of
each species. In this study we consider two families of bacteria, each represented by four species. We can assume
that some genes underwent positive selection during the
evolution of each species, whereas other genes underwent
positive selection in clades including more than one species. To identify the genes that underwent positive selection during the evolution of a species we designed the
following approach. Firstly, we chose the species for
which we wanted to detect genes that underwent positive

selection, in our case the deep-sea bacteria. Secondly, we
compared the chosen species with the other three control
species of the same family, calculating the ω values for
each orthologous pair. Thirdly, we performed the calculation of the ω values also within the three control species.
Finally, we selected the genes that resulted positive (i.e.
underwent positive selection) in each of the three comparisons of the chosen species versus the control species but
were negative in the three comparisons within the control
species.
It is important to consider that it is likely that the genes
selected by this approach specifically underwent positive
selection in the chosen species, but this does not automatically imply that they are involved in deep-sea adaptation.
This point should be considered for a correct interpretation of the results.
It is known from the literature that evolution of bacterial
genes is influenced by several factors, such as protein
expression level, functional class and metabolic cost of
amino acid residues [11]. Therefore we further considered
the distribution of Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) versus
ω values for each orthologous gene, both in Shewanellaceae and Vibrionaceae. It had been previously defined
that CAI is negatively correlated with dN [11]. In fact, proteins expressed at high levels are generally associated with
the usage of the "best" synonymous codons, resulting in a
direct influence of the codon usage bias on the rate of
non-synonymous substitutions in bacteria.
Genome-wide studies have already identified a number of
biological processes involved in high pressure adaptation
[12]. We used genes that we obtained from the comparison between piezophiles and mesophiles (PS genes) to
establish which Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of
Ortologous Groups (COG) functional classes are targeted
by natural selection in bacterial evolution. Moreover PS

proteins, belonging to particular categories, can easily
show PS sites mainly localized in specific domains. In
order to better define the role of amino acid substitutions
on deep sea adaptation, we mapped PS sites on the 3D
structure as well as on protein topology in respect of transmembrane regions.

Results
In order to identify genes under positive selection in deepsea adapted bacteria we analyzed 4 Vibrionaceae and 4
Shewanellaceae from which we selected 2,174 orthologous genes shared by the former and 2,180 shared by the
latter. These numbers are high enough to allow us to
explore all the main biochemical and physiological cellular processes. The two groups were obtained by firstly considering the three mesophilic bacteria V. parahaemolyticus,
V. fisheri and V. vulnificus for the comparison with P. profundum and secondly by using S. baltica, S. oneidensis and
S. frigidimarina for the comparison with S. benthica (see
details in Table 1).
For each orthologous gene pair we aligned DNA
sequences and computed amino acid substitution rate.
Most of ω values were included in the 0 to 0.2 range (Figure 1A) and the median dN/dS calculated was 0.08 in
Vibrionaceae and 0.07 in Shewanellaceae. Using Spearman statistics we verified the inverse correlation between
CAI and ω values achieving ρ coefficients included in the
-0.27 to -0.33 range in Vibrionaceae ortholog comparison
and -0.18 to -0.36 in Shewanellaceae (Figure 1B). Moreover PS genes do not have a biased CAI value and their distribution is in accordance with those of all the orthologs.
This homogeneous distribution confirms that the ω values of PS genes are not determined by low CAI values but
mainly by deep sea adaptation.
It is known that orthologs generally have low ω values (<
0.05), which implies that the proteins are subject to rela-

tively strong purifying selection. Genes with dN/dS > 1 are
formally defined as being subject to positive selection, in
fact amino acid changes are accumulating faster than
would be expected given the underlying silent substitution rate. Even so, proteins with dN/dS < 1 may still contain sites under positive selection, but their contribution
to the dN/dS for the whole protein is masked by the purifying selection at other sites [13]. To overcome this problem we only considered the orthologous genes having
values significantly higher in the comparison between piezophilic and mesophilic bacteria, with respect to the comparison within mesophiles. Thus, we identified 213 PS
genes in the Vibrionaceae family and 61 in Shewanellaceae respectively (see report in Additional files 1, 2). The
list includes many different functional classes of proteins,
ranging from transporters, that are definitively the most
represented, to metabolic enzymes, chaperons and ribosomal proteins.
Processes Involved in Deep Sea Adaptation
To better understand the role of these genes in the evolution of extremophiles all orthologs were assigned to functional categories according to COG and GO annotations
[14,15]. The evidence of PS genes enrichment in COG
specific groups was calculated using hypergeometric distribution. Furthermore we used the Fisher exact test on
GO in order to give an overview of bacterial adaptation at
a higher level of detail, for example specific biological
mechanisms. In fact COGs give a more general idea of the

processes involved. We obtained two COGs showing evidence of positive selection both in SS9 and KT99: "Nucleotide transport and metabolism" (F) and "Inorganic ion
transport and metabolism" (P). There are three additional
COG categories only enriched in SS9: "Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis" (M), "Intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport" (U), "General
function prediction only" (R). The "Defense mechanisms"
(V) class is KT99 specific, as shown in Table 2. From these
data clearly emerges an involvement of the transport and
metabolism processes in the deep-sea adaptation strategy
of both piezophiles considered in this study, while the
adaptation of other biological processes seems to be peculiar to either one or the other.
A similar analysis was performed using the Gene Ontology classification (GO) that takes into account biological
processes, cellular components and molecular functions.
Both bacterial families reveal an enrichment of PS genes
belonging to the "Localization" process, that is the action
by which a substance or other structures are transported to
(or maintained in) a specific location, see details in Additional file 3. In GO this term is strictly related to "Transport" activity. It is relevant that there are specific
"Transport processes" enriched in both piezophiles,
instead "Protein folding" and "Cell motility" are present
only in SS9. Several genes belonging to the last category
are involved in the flagellar basal structure as shown in
KEGG representation on Additional file 4[16]. The only

significant Cellular Component obtained from the analysis in Shewanellaceae was the "Membrane" category. It
emerges also that in Shewanellaceae there is a higher
number of enriched categories, but most of them contain
only a single gene. For this reason we considered them less
noteworthy, even if we cannot exclude that their specific
role in the process of adaptation may have been relevant.
All genomic analyses were done separately in both bacterial families. This allowed the identification of individual
adaptation mechanisms that developed independently in
the two extremophiles considered as well as those in common. In fact examining the two lists of PS genes we found
only 12 shared by both families, corresponding respectively to 5.6% (12/213) in SS9 and to 18% (12/61) in
KT99, see details in Table 3. As a validation of the previous
results these genes belong to the most relevant classes:
Transport, Membrane and Cell motility. These proteins
will be further considered in the Discussion section, due
to their highly relevant role in adaptation to these extreme
environmental conditions.
Localization of PS Sites on Protein Structure
For a better comprehension of the variable amino acids
functional role we mapped them on protein structures,
domains and trans-membrane regions. We identified
amino acids specifically different from a chemical-physical point of view in piezophiles, compared to mesophiles.
Hereafter we will call them PS sites.

Position analyses were done using two distinct strategies
for soluble and membrane proteins, due to the different
meaning of amino acid substitutions in these categories.
Among the 213 PS proteins identified in Vibrionaceae
family, 65 of them have predicted trans-membrane
regions and 149 are predicted as soluble. By querying the
ModBase database [17] we obtained 42 models having
more than 40% similarity with known protein structures.
Using these models we mapped the PS sites on the 3D
structure of soluble proteins using PyMol software (Figure
2).
Generally the variable amino acids are localized on the
protein surface. To confirm their distribution, we evaluated the number of solvent exposed PS sites (Additional
file 1). This computation was performed for all SS9 models with the exception of PBPRA0158, as it is trans-membrane.
In 27 proteins more than 75% of the PS sites are located
on the surface while in other 14 cases they fall in the 50%
– 75% range. We verified that the variable amino acids are
predominantly solvent exposed, as reported in Figure 3.
Moreover, considering the total amino acid number, we
found 4 proteins with more than 75% of solvent exposed
residues, 37 fell in the 50% – 75% range and one had less
than 50% exposed residues. All these results indicate that
in only three cases the fraction of solvent exposed PS sites

is lower or equal to the one calculated for the entire structure. Finally, in nine cases we detected PS sites involving
ligand binding sites.
In the analysis of the PS sites of membrane proteins, particular relevance was given to their position. We looked at
protein topology, inside or outside the membrane, and at
trans-membrane helices. We found 21 proteins with a
higher number of PS sites in trans-membrane region, 18
in the external region and 22 in the cytoplasmic region.
However these numbers are heavily dependent on the correspondent region length and normalization was required
to obtain comparable results between different proteins.
The outcome indicates that the higher fraction of PS sites
is externally located in 41% of proteins, cytoplasmic in
35% and trans-membrane in 24% (Figure 4A). Moreover,
comparing membrane PS sites with extracellular and cytoplasmic together, only 33% of the proteins had the higher
variable amino acids in the trans-membrane helices.
Finally, we calculated the mean number of cytoplasmic,
external and trans-membrane PS sites normalized with
respect to each portion length obtaining respectively 1.03,
1.06 and 0.86. Due to their relevance in our study, we also

executed the same procedure considering only transporters, in this way we got higher mean values, respectively
1.02, 1.28 and 0.77 for cytoplasmic, external and transmembrane regions. Among the PS genes of Shewanellaceae we could only analyze 12 trans-membrane proteins
because no 3D model of soluble proteins was available in
ModBase. Despite the low number of genes, structural
mapping of PS sites on trans-membrane proteins revealed
that the residues under positive selection occur preferentially in the extracellular region (5 proteins), as shown in

cytoplasmic, external and trans-membrane PS sites, we
obtained respectively 1.05, 0.99 and 0.91.
It has to be considered that only some portions of the proteins are under positive selection and this influences the ω
value computed for the entire sequence. We searched for
genes under intensive selective pressure to recognize
regions with overrepresented nonsynonymous mutations
unevenly distributed along the alignment, previously unidentified using conventional rate comparison analysis
[18]. We were interested in genes with overabundant
mutation regions localized in specific domains that were

present in all the comparisons between piezophiles and
mesophiles, but absent in mesophilic bacteria only. We
discovered just one fast evolving region (FER) in
PBPRA0616 among all Vibrionaceae orthologs and we
found 10 genes with overabundant mutation rate (OMR).
Four of these are trans-membrane proteins and six are soluble proteins. In KT99 we found one FER in the
KT99_15170 gene, whilst one trans-membrane protein
and five soluble proteins have OMRs (Additional files 1

and 2).
Finally we investigated if the SS9 PS proteins had been
previously identified as involved in high pressure and low
temperature adaptation and we compared our data with
SS9 microarray experiments results [6] and with genes
found by systematic mutagenesis screening [19]. Among
the 14 PS genes found differentially expressed by microarray analyses, 4 of them were identified as up-regulated
under high hydrostatic pressure (28 MPa) compared to

identified in the list from the systematic mutagenesis

mutants.

Discussion

families we obtained about 2,180 shared orthologous
genes. The general rationale of our study is to identify,
independently for each family, the genes that underwent
positive selection in the deep-sea adapted species. Thus,
using Gene Ontology associations, we should be able to
see whether any biological processes or molecular functions are particularly affected in one or both bacterial families.

Vibrionaceae and Shewanellaceae represent a significant
portion of the culturable heterotrophic bacteria of oceans,
coastal waters and lakes. Some species belonging to these
families also inhabit deep-sea environments and, due to
the increasing interest in high pressure adaptation, various studies have been undertaken to clarify their characteristics from a genomic point of view [12]. Our study is
based on an exhaustive comparison of orthologous genes.
It is therefore important to discuss the criteria used for
their selection. Two main factors affect the number of
orthologous genes shared amongst the considered species: the number of species and their phylogenetic distance. Therefore, we kept the two bacterial families
separated and selected two independent sets of orthologous genes, one for each of the two families. Furthermore,
for each family we limited the number of species to four:
one from deep sea and three from shallow water. In both

PS Genes Detection
In both families about 2180 ortologues were identified
and utilized in six different two by two ω value calculations, three between piezophiles-mesophiles and three
between mesophiles, the latter considered as a negative
control. The level of divergence among the species of a
bacterial family is high enough to detect the signature of
selection, yet low enough to have a high number of
orthologous genes. In previous works computations performed using the dN/dS substitution rate were complicated by the uncertainty of the threshold to be considered
for genes under positive selection. For this reason, instead
of a direct selection of all the instances above a given
threshold, we decided to consider only those genes that
had statistically higher ω values in the three piezophilemesophiles comparisons. The approach employed

allowed us to identify both specific and common functional categories involved in SS9 and KT99 adaptation
strategies. In fact, both of them are piezophiles but they
were isolated from distinct environments and showed
optimum growth at different pressures and temperatures.

Functional classes
To clarify the role of PS genes we analyzed their statistical
over-representations in all functional classes. As expected
evaluation of both COG and GO results confirmed the
key role of transport proteins in abyssal adaptation. It is
known from the literature that the transport of com-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:313

pounds like Trp, Lys, His and Leu is reduced at high pressure, owing to the volume change of activation needed in
the transport process [2]. In fact, the tat2 gene enables
transformed yeast cells to grow at high hydrostatic pressure by encoding a high-affinity tryptophan permease
which counteracts the significant inhibition of tryptophan
uptake into the cells due to high pressure [20]. It was previously determined that SS9 up-regulates certain transporters mainly at low pressure. This could indicate that
these proteins may have evolved a particular structure
adapted to elevated pressure because their up-regulation
could compensate the reduction of functionality.
Five PS genes previously identified as differentially
expressed in microarray experiments probably play a crucial role (Additional file 1). Among these, there are three
permease components that are part of an ABC transporter:
"hypohetical ABC transporter, permease protein"
(PBPRA2115); "putative ABC-type arginine transport system, permease component" (PBPRA2740); "putative
ABC-type metal ion transport system, permease component" (PBPRA2941). The remaining are a "periplasmic
peptide binding protein" belonging to a putative peptide
ABC transporter (PBPRA0525) and a "putative glycerol-3phosphate transporter" (PBPRA0158). PBPRA0525 is part
of the ABC transporter coded by PBPRA0521-PBPRA0525
that was previously shown to be up-regulated at 28 MPa
and 4°C, while a second peptide ABC transporter, coded
by PBPRA2934-PBPRA2938 genes, was down-regulated at
28 MPa. These data indicated that SS9 can express proteins adapted to different pressures [6]. The fact that only
PBPRA0525 was identified in our study is a further indication that this protein has been selected to work better in
the abyssal environment, and gives indirect evidence that
SS9 probably evolved from some mesophilic strains.
Moreover, the number of PS sites in the piezophile permease compared to those of the mesophiles is twice (66/
559 versus 30/608) in PBPRA0525, which is over
expressed at high pressure and low temperature.
Another class of transporters that are influenced by pressure is that of the voltage-gated channels-. Using the patch
clamp technique, it has been demonstrated that pressure
acts on the movement of the charge sensor and on the
conformational change involved in opening the channel
pore [21-23]. For certain channels the ΔV value for the
closed/open transition is -105 ml mol-1, that is, the open
state occupies a smaller volume than the closed state [24]
thus implying that pressure could have a large influence
on this process. In this work we verify that in deep-sea
organism transporters there are PS sites, a finding that had
previously been hypothesized -by other authors [21]. --In
light of these points the demonstration that many PS
genes belong to the GO transport category is noteworthy.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/313

Despite the high number of different classes of transporters made difficult to discuss the role of the localization of
the PS sites on protein structure, their high frequency in
the external part of the membrane proteins is noteworthy.
Another significant group of proteins is that involved in
protein export across the outer membrane [25]. Two of
them, "protein export protein SecD" (PBPRA0745) and
"protein export protein SecF" (PBPRA0746), belong to the
translocation complex and were identified as positive
selected (Additional file 4). SecDF of B. subtilis is implicated in early translocation steps, whereas in E. coli these
polypeptides are required to release mature proteins. It
was found that strains lacking intact secDF are cold-sensitive and this conditional phenotype probably reflects the
thermal sensitivity of protein translocation [26]. As previously noted high pressure and low temperature have a
similar effect on bacterial membranes and are probably
responsible for positive selection acting on these two proteins and globally on SS9 transporters [27]. The maintenance of biological membranes in a narrow range of
viscosity, homeoviscous response, or within a liquid-crystalline phase, homeophasic response, is essential for
growth and survival [28,29]. This is not surprising,
because a great number of biological processes such as
membrane transport, protein-protein interactions within
the lipid bilayer, metabolic electron transport, intracellular signaling and gene regulation are dependent on a suitable membrane physical structure [30]. Due to the key
role played by membrane proteins, we computed the distribution of PS sites in different domains; however, our
analysis showed that in 40% of the proteins, considering
normalized values, the higher fraction of PS sites is
located in the external part and not in trans-membrane
region, the opposite of what was expected considering the
putative influence of the membrane composition mentioned above. This finding is in agreement with similar
results obtained in mouse, where, compared with the
intracellular (cytoplasmic and nuclear) domains, a greater
proportion of extracellular domains possess higher ω values [13] and are subject, on average, to greater positive
diversifying selection. Moreover other studies comparing
transporters of Bacteria, Archea and Eucarya [31] indicate
that the major differences in terms of size between
orthologs are in the hydrophilic regions, the most important from a regulatory point of view.
Some of the SS9 PS orthologs we identified belong to the
GO categories related to the following terms: "Locomotion", "Ciliary or flagellar motility" and "Cell motility"
(Additional file 3). This is probably related to the importance of bacterial motility in enhancing bacteria-organicmatter coupling and reducing the ability of protozoa to
graze on bacteria [32]. It was shown that the P. profundum
deep sea adapted strains (SS9 and DSJ4) contain an addi-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:313

tional gene cluster absent in the shallow bathytype
(3TCK) which resembles genes for the production of lateral flagella [6]. The function of this additional cluster is
unknown, but preliminary results have provided evidence
that the SS9 strain displays high motility at 28 MPa pressure and swims very slowly at atmospheric pressure, while
the opposite phenotype has been observed in the shallow
water 3TCK [33]. Proteins coded by the PS genes, which
we recognized as part of this pathway, are the "putative
flagellar basal-body rod protein FlgF" (PBPRA0905) and
the "putative polar flagellar FlgG" (PBPRA0906) located
on the external membrane region. Also involved in this
process are the "flagellar basal body-associated protein
FlgB" (PBPRA0901) and the "flagellar basal body protein
FliH" (PBPRA0925), both part of the motor switch (Additional file 4). Flagellar assembly and motor function are
known to be the most pressure-sensitive cellular processes
[4,34] therefore we hypothesized this modification of
flagellar structure to be a strategy specific to SS9. In fact in
the KT99 PS gene list there are no flagellar proteins and
the only one related to the cell motility class is "MSHA
biogenesis protein MshL" (KT99_07703), part of the Type
II secretion system.
We have already stated that independent analysis done on
Shewanellaceae and Vibrionaceae allowed the detection
of functional classes involved in SS9 and KT99 specific
and common adaptations. In order to further investigate
the most interesting pathways we compared the two PS
gene lists using BLAST and we found 12 genes shared by
them (Table 3). They are respectively 18% and 5.6% of the
corresponding total of PS genes. Among the proteins
coded by them there are three transporters and this
stresses their importance in deep-sea adaptation.
The presence of the "hypothetical Primosomal Replication Protein N" is relevant as it has a role in the assembly
of the primosome and has a helicase activity [35]. The
same function is present in RecD protein of SS9 that also
enhances the pressure resistance in E. coli [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/313

tion we computed the fraction of solvent exposed PS sites
in 41 SS9 proteins for which a modeled structure was
available in database. Comparing the fraction of the solvent-exposed amino acids with that of the PS sites, we
found the latter higher in 93% of the proteins. Despite the
higher tendency of the exposed amino acids to change, we
could hypothesize that protein surface has a role in deepsea adaptation. For example [39] it has been reported that
the increased exposure of hydrophobic residues and the
reduction of solvent exposed charged amino acids determines a destabilization of the protein surface. This is
linked to cold adaptation, reduction of activation energy
and to an increased catalytic efficiency [40,41].

Conclusion
In this paper we propose a new statistical approach that
could be applied to identify genes under positive selection
by means of omega value calculation. Using this method
we investigated the problem of molecular adaptation in
deep-sea adapted bacteria. Genes obtained in vibrionaceae and shewanellaceae were grouped using COG
and GO and the results showed that positive selection in
piezophiles targets a wide range of different functions
such as transport of solutes, protein translocation, DNA
synthesis and flagellar motility. Transport was identified
as the most notable biological process that underwent
positive selection in the two deep-sea bacteria that we
studied. This result is particularly interesting because it
confirms some previous findings obtained by other
approaches such as the analysis of expression profiles at
high and low pressure [2] and the analysis of laterally
transferred genes in deep-sea bacteria [6]. We can therefore conclude that the proteins involved in transport represent a bona fide class of proteins that requires consistent
modifications to adapt to the deep-sea environment.
Structural mapping of PS sites in membrane proteins
reveals that they tend to occur preferentially in extracellular regions of membrane proteins.

Methods
Positive selection acting on this protein could counteract
the reduction in DNA and RNA biosynthesis at high pressure in mesophiles but also the inhibition of cellular division that could determine the formation of highly
filamentous cells [37,38].
Localization of PS sites in the Protein Structure
It has been proposed that solvent exposed amino acids
have a lower purifying selection and for this reason could
vary more easily. An explanation could be the lower functional constraint of the residues located on the protein
surface with respect to the buried residues. For most of the
proteins this is clearly evidenced from the PhyMol software generated images (Figure 2). To verify this assump-

Among the completely sequenced bacterial genomes
deposited in the NCBI database [42], we chose those with
the larger number of orthologous genes with respect to
the two piezophiles that we wanted to investigate. To
select these microorganisms all protein-coding gene
sequences in SS9 and KT99 were blasted --respectively
against the Vibrionaceae and Shewanellaceae available at
NCBI's ftp site [43]. BLAST results were parsed using PERL
scripts in order to select only those orthologs satisfying
alignment criteria defined in literature [14]: alignment
extension over 70% and e-value cut-off 10-5. All identity
values were higher than 40% and most of e-value indicated an exact match. To discard paralogous genes from
our analysis, reciprocal BLAST searches were performed

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:313

and the selection was limited at best reciprocal hits. Then
we selected the definitive orthologous genes choosing
those of the three mesophilic bacteria with the higher
number of matches in the pair comparison with the piezophile. Only SS9 or KT99 proteins with a valuable scoring
match in each of the three mesophilic bacteria were considered. All the following procedures were carried out separately for Shewanellaceae and Vibrionaceae families.
Tests for positive selection
The positive selection analysis was performed considering
all the possible pairs of bacteria and six ω values series
were calculated. This kind of test required a specific DNA
alignment for each gene based on the corresponding protein alignment. For this reason, orthologous protein
sequences were aligned with ClustalW [44] and then were
back-translated to the corresponding DNA sequences
using RevTrans software. This allowed the preservation of
gaps obtained during protein alignment, essential to
avoid in-dels causing frameshifts in DNA sequences.

To test for positive selection each ortholog pair of the six
series was compared using the method implemented in
yn00 software of PAML package [45] that evaluates the
presence of PS sites calculating the dN/dS ratio (ω)
between sequences pairs. The results were six groups of
values: three from the comparison of the piezophilic bacteria with the mesophiles and three from the mesophilic
bacteria between them.
Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)
CAI values for orthologous genes were obtained for all
bacteria using CodonW [46]. This software performs correspondence analysis of the Relative Adaptiveness (RA) of
the codon usage of a gene towards the codon usage of
highly expressed genes. RA of each codon is the usage
ratio with respect to that of the most abundant codon for
the same amino acid. This estimate was done selecting
genes identified in SS9 and S. oneidensis MR-1 from those
having high expression values (fluorescence arbitrary
units higher than 10000) in microarray experiments performed on these bacteria. SS9 microarray results were
obtained from ArrayExpress database (E-MEXP-210) [47],
instead S. oneidensis's ones where taken from GEO database
(GSM100358,
GSM100396,
GSM100872,
GSM100873, GSM87832, GSM88468, GSM88473,
GSM88474) [48].
SAM analysis
The six values reckoned for each ortholog were therefore
analyzed in order to identify those significantly higher in
the comparison between piezophilic and mesophilic bacteria with respect to the values obtained from the mesophiles only. These genes could possibly be affected by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/313

positive selection in piezophiles (PS genes) and could
play a role in bacterial adaptation to deep-sea environment.
Statistical analysis was performed using SAM [49]. This
software was initially developed for microarray data analysis and implements a modified t-test useful to verify large
number of independent hypothesis. SAM employs
repeated permutations to settle which of the values
obtained in the piezophile-mesophiles comparisons are
significantly higher than those identified comparing mesophiles only. The cutoff for significance is determined by
a tuning parameter delta, chosen by the user and based on
the false discovery rate (FDR) set at 10%. All the following
bioinformatics analyses were executed on PS genes lists
obtained as described above.
COG and GO functional classes
PS genes were evaluated to identify enrichment of GO and
COG categories relative of what would have been
expected by chance alone.

While GO enrichment was calculated using GoMiner software [50], the COG calculation was done according to the
hypergeometric distribution. With this analysis we identified the chance of observing the number of genes annotated with a particular COG category among the selected
group of orthologs. The probability P of finding at least k
genes of a functional category within a group of n genes is
given by:

n

P=

∑
i=k

⎛ f ⎞⎛ g − f ⎞
⎜ ⎟⎜
⎟
⎝ i ⎠⎝ n −i ⎠
⎛g⎞
⎜ ⎟
⎝n⎠

where f is the total number of genes within the same category (in the matrix) and g is the total number of genes
identified using SAM software. Hypergeometric distribution was calculated using R statistical package [51] and the
significance threshold considered is 0.05.
Fast evolving regions prediction
A variant of the TL method [52] was used on the PS genes
to detect regions with significantly higher variability
within each sequence pairs. The number of nonsynonymous mutations is estimated on every codon position in
the alignment and regions with overabundant mutation
rate are reckoned using Faster software [18]. These sections were further selected and considered in the study
only if present in piezophile-mesophiles comparisons
and discarded if also identified comparing mesophiles.

PS sites mapping on 3D structures of proteins in
Vibrionaceae
When available, we downloaded from ModBase the 3D
structure PDB file calculated by comparative modeling for
each PS gene [53]. To get more reliable results we considered only the proteins with a percentage of identical residues higher than 40% in the alignment between the target
and the template. For each ortholog we aligned the three
mesophile sequences first independently and then with
the piezophile sequence using ClustalW. In this way we
identified amino acids conserved among the three but variable with respect to the piezophile sequence. We considered as variable only those amino acids having strongly
different physical-chemical properties. These sites, along
with the position of the ligand binding site downloaded
from ModBase, were highlighted in the 3D protein structure using PyMol software. We also mapped in the structure the position of the overabundant mutation region,
when present. Then the DSSP software was utilized to estimate solvent accessible surface areas (ACCs) for all residues of each ortholog PDB file selected above [54]. Finally
we compared each protein mean ACC value with those
obtained only for the PS sites.

PS sites localization on trans-membrane proteins
For each selected membrane protein we estimated the
trans-membrane helices positions and the protein orientation, as predicted by Phobius software [55]. Therefore
we localized the PS sites position in all sequences and we
mapped them with respect to the protein topology, inside
or outside the membrane, and on trans-membrane helices. For each of these sections the number of PS sites was
normalized for their total number and the protein region
length. The values for exposed (ext), trans-membrane (tr)
and cytoplasmic (cyt) PS sites are given by:

(ext N° of PS sites/tot N° of PS sites)/(ext N° of AA/tot N°
