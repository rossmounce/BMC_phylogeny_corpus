Abstract
Background: Published molecular phylogenies are usually based on data whose quality has not
been explored prior to tree inference. This leads to errors because trees obtained with
conventional methods suppress conflicting evidence, and because support values may be high even
if there is no distinct phylogenetic signal. Tools that allow an a priori examination of data quality
are rarely applied.
Results: Using data from published molecular analyses on the phylogeny of crustaceans it is shown
that tree topologies and popular support values do not show existing differences in data quality. To
visualize variations in signal distinctness, we use network analyses based on split decomposition and
split support spectra. Both methods show the same differences in data quality and the same cladesupporting patterns. Both methods are useful to discover long-branch effects.
We discern three classes of long branch effects. Class I effects consist of attraction of terminal taxa
caused by symplesiomorphies, which results in a false monophyly of paraphyletic groups. Addition
of carefully selected taxa can fix this effect. Class II effects are caused by drastic signal erosion. Long
branches affected by this phenomenon usually slip down the tree to form false clades that in reality
are polyphyletic. To recover the correct phylogeny, more conservative genes must be used. Class
III effects consist of attraction due to accumulated chance similarities or convergent character
states. This sort of noise can be reduced by selecting less variable portions of the data set, avoiding
biases, and adding slower genes.
Conclusion: To increase confidence in molecular phylogenies an exploratory analysis of the signal
to noise ratio can be conducted with split decomposition methods. If long-branch effects are
detected, it is necessary to discern between three classes of effects to find the best approach for
an improvement of the raw data.

Background
Assuming a reliable alignment is available, phylogenetic
tree topologies inferred from molecular data usually are
regarded to be informative, if support for clades as esti-

mated with bootstrapping or jackknifing methods or with
Bayesian approaches is high and if at the same time a systematic bias can be excluded [e.g. [1-12]]. Even though it
is well known by scientists interested in theory that boot-

strap values give no indication of whether there is a systematic problem within the data set [13], that Bayesian
support values may be too optimistic [14], and that a bias
may cause convergence to an incorrect tree, most biologists still rely on bootstrapping or on Bayesian support
values. However, "bootstrap support of 100% is not
enough, the tree must also be correct" [15].
Phylogeny inference is an inductive science that depends
on sampling of empirical data. Usually, in natural sciences the quality of empirical data must be evaluated to
detect sampling errors and differences in quality of sampled data before any conclusions are derived.
However, in molecular systematics raw data are generally
not tested for their suitability to detect the phylogenetic
history of organisms before tree construction. All popular
methods used to assess the reliability of an analysis compare the fit between results and data (e.g. via bootstrapping). This approach can be misleading. Clades may get a
good support whenever parts of the topology are based on
compatible patterns in an alignment, even if these patterns are not traces of the real phylogeny. It also may happen that several contradicting phylogenies get high
support values depending on the method used [15]. This
is not only a problem of model selection but also of the
amount and quality of available information.
A number of implausible phylogenies have been published by very confident authors who proclaimed the discovery of surprising relationships that clearly contradict
most of the available background knowledge. Examples
are the improbable Marsupionta hypothesis (monophyly
of {Monotremata, Marsupialia}) that was based on analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes [16-18], which
later was refuted several times due to morphological evidence and because of results obtained with alignments of
nuclear genes [19-23]. According to Phillips and Penny
[23], the Marsupionta clade can be explained by parallel
shifts in base frequencies in mitochondrial genomes of
Monotremata and Marsupialia. Another case is the prominently published mollusc phylogeny with polyphyletic
snails and mussels [24], which also is extremely improbable in view of the bulk of information available to zoologists [e.g. [25-29]]. Until now, nobody has proposed that
the bauplan of snails or mussels evolved independently
several times and that e.g. characters shared by mussels are
convergences. In both examples the authors did not check
whether their alignments contain contradicting signal-like
patterns. Many other examples exist, some are analysed in
the following. Even though tools have been published
that allow an a priori check of data quality [30-36], it
seems that most biologists are not aware of the necessity
to ask whether their data are suitable for a phylogenetic
analysis or not.

Real data sets always contain conflicting information. The
processes producing conflicts are well understood.
Excluding cases of horizontal gene transfer, the structure
of the data may not be tree-like due to lack of historical
signal or due to presence of non-historical signals and stochastic errors. Remember that historical signals are always
real homologies, and that only those homologies that
evolved on the stem-lineage of a real clade, the so-called
apomorphies, can substantiate the existence (monophyly) of this clade [37]. Apomorphies shared by different
taxa are called synapomorphies.
It may be that multiple substitutions destroy synapomorphies (process of signal erosion), homoplasies can accumulate along "long branches". Substitution processes not
only produce phylogenetic signal (apomorphic character
states) but also chance similarities that may attract distantly related clades in a topology. If species radiated
quickly or if stem-lineages are short, apomorphies that
evolved in stem-lineages may be rare and chance similarities that evolved later can dominate in the form of signallike patterns [38-41]. It has been shown in simulations
and it is often claimed that substitution models can correct some of these effects [42-47], but there is no way to
discover without background knowledge whether the
phylogeny is plausible and whether the selected model
conveniently corrects for misleading events. With unrealistic models likelihood methods can converge on the
wrong tree [48-50].
Under an ideal model of DNA evolution, a random
Markov process would produce randomly distributed
analogies. As long as some phylogenetic signal is conserved, this random noise in the data can be corrected
with an appropriate substitution model. However, in
nature selection by environmental parameters and developmental constraints produce non-random patterns.
Even assuming that gene conversion between paralogous
genes and lateral (horizontal) transfer of genes between
species are rare, effects of unknown population bottle
necks and other unknown factors influencing substitution
rates in different sequence regions and different lineages
can produce non-phylogenetic signals that can not always
be recognized. Therefore, any phylogenetic analyses
should begin with an exploratory assessment of the quality of the data set.
Our concept for the terms signal and noise must be
explained here. For the purpose of phylogenetic analyses,
a signal is an identifiable trace left by phylogeny in heritable characters, in our case, in genes. Signal consists of
character states which are homologous, which can be
identified due to their identity or which can be derived
from each other with an appropriate model of character
evolution. For our discussion, noise is any modification of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:147

sequences that destroys the true signal or that produces
false signals. Noise can consist of random data [40], it can
be the effect of randomly distributed substitutions, but
also of convergence triggered by selective forces and affecting base composition, site variability and covariation, or
evolutionary rates. Presence of paralogous sequences can
also introduce noise in form of conflicting signals. Different types of false signals, classified by us as noise, have
also been named compositional signals, heterotachous
signals, or rate signals [51].
For any phylogenetic analysis two different sets of questions must be discerned. There are questions concerning
data quality: How informative is the data set? Does it contain compatible signal-like patterns or do contradicting
signals dominate? Is there enough phylogenetic signal to
infer the correct substitution model? Is it possible to discern signal and noise? And there are questions concerning
the fit between data and tree topology: How likely are specific alternative tree topologies? What is the difference in
support for distinct clades? Is the substitution model adequate? Can a clade support be explained by a bias in
nucleotide substitution or in rate differences alone?
The first set of a priori questions is neglected in current literature. A priori analysis of data quality is a little explored
field, and there exist few tools that are independent of tree
construction. The most promising approach is to examine
bipartitions (splits) that are present in a DNA-alignment,
to compare their support by nucleotide patterns, and to
check the compatibility of these patterns. This exploratory
examination of an alignment does not need tree topologies and models. The rationale requires two assumptions:
(a) If the alignment contains conserved apomorphies supporting real monophyletic groups, then these patterns
should be mutually compatible. Compatibility means
here that different species groups supported by patterns of
nucleotides should fit to a single tree (or to a Venn diagram without intersections). Note that it is not required to
infer a tree. It is sufficient to test if supported groups of
species or sequences are mutually compatible. (b) The
alignment is informative, if compatible signal-like patterns are based on more conserved sequence positions
than contradicting (mutually incompatible) patterns. In
other words, the signal should be discernible from the
background noise of the data.
The first convincing tool that could be used to visualize
split support present in DNA- alignments was spectral
analysis based on Hadamard conjugation [52,53]. A nice
application of the method was the study of pinniped phylogeny [13] based on mtDNA sequences. In this publication it could be shown that in an informative data set
monophyletic groups show a support that is always much
better than that of further incompatible splits present in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/147

the data set. This type of spectral analysis allows a correction of distances between clades using substitution models. Lento et al. [13] showed that using substitution
models filters out a large part of incompatible signal. Of
course, the effect depends on the model selected. However, until now this convincing visualization of effects of
models has not found a broader application. One problem is that computing time grows exponentially with the
number of sequences because Hadamard conjugation
considers the complete split space of an alignment. Therefore computer programs like SPECTRUM [54] or Spectronet [55] can not be used on single work stations for
more than 20 to 30 sequences. This is why we developed
a simpler method that searches only for those splits that
are represented in the data. The algorithm briefly
explained below is implemented in SAMS, a new computer program developed by C. Mayer.
We present here a comparison of published phylogenies
of crustacean taxa with those signal-like patterns that can
be found in the original alignments used for those publications. These examples clearly show that visualization of
alignment patterns tells more about the structure of the
data at hand than the popular tree constructing methods.

Results
Strong differences in clade support visualized with split
support spectra and phylogenetic networks
Phylogenetic trees do not show how strong the difference
in clade support really is in the raw data. We use for the
following example one of the first convincing molecular
analyses of crustacean phylogeny: the phylogeny of Cirripedia (Crustacea) based on 18S rDNA published by [56].
The published parsimony tree shows a long branch separating basal taxa (Ascothoracida, Acrothoracica) from the
remaining Cirripedia. The same phenomenon is also seen
in the phylogenetic network calculated from the original
alignment (Fig. 1). Searching the alignment, one finds
245 conserved sequence positions that support the strongest split, many of these with a single character state in the
ingroup. For comparison: in this data set the sessile barnacles are only supported by 3 conserved positions. Drastic
differences in split support and conflicting evidence for
different splits within Thoracica are also seen in the split
support spectrum (Fig. 2), the differences are similar to
those seen in the network.

A second example concerns the phylogeny of Branchiopoda, also inferred from 18SrDNA sequences [57]. The
published tree topology is shown in Fig. 3. Clades with
high parsimony bootstrap consensus support are Malacostraca, Branchiopoda, Anostraca, Cladocera, Anomopoda, Notostraca. Cyclestheria seems to be misplaced.
Usually, Cyclestheria is classified as genus of Spinicaudata,
in the tree it appears as sistertaxon to Cladocera. The

The split support spectrum (Fig. 5) provides information
similar to the phylogenetic network. In addition, it shows
a ranking order of support quality and it shows splits that
are excluded in the phylogenetic network since not all
splits can be drawn in a planar graph. It is clear from the
spectrum that there are only 5 splits that are distinctly
stronger than the first incompatible one, a product of
chance similarities. Remaining splits, even those that are
compatible with the tree and which make sense morphologically (e.g. for the clade {Cladocera, rest}) have no
conserved support better than the background noise.

Note that with the exception of a small subnet to the right
(Calantica to Chelonibia) the graph has a tree-like structure.
This means that there is more signal-like information than
contradicting evidence (original alignment from [55] ; outgroup: Branchinecta).

authors argue that there are also morphological characters
indicating that Cyclestheria might not be a spinicaudatan
genus. Another feature in the most parsimonious tree
which is not compatible with morphology is that Notostraca are nested within Conchostraca. However, the boostrapped 50% majority rule consensus topology does not
recover this grouping. Fig. 4 is a phylogenetic network
based on the original alignment [57]. Obviously, for the
crustacean taxa a number of conserved sequence positions
contain distinct phylogenetic signals in favour of the
groups Myriapoda, Chelicerata, Insecta, Malacostraca,
Branchiopoda, Anostraca, Anomopoda. The Notostraca
split is already weaker than the other ones. Other bifurcations of the maximum parsimony topology in the original
publication are contradicted by conflicting patterns and
placement of several taxa is not plausible when compared
with morphological data. There are no edges distinctly
better than conflicting signals that allow a safe placement
of Notostraca, Spinicaudata, Lynceus, or Cyclestheria. This
observation is in accordance with the observed collapse of
corresponding nodes in the bootstrap consensus topology
of Spears and Abele [57]. If gap sites and distant outgroups are excluded (not shown), the network is more
tree-like and more similar to the current classification of
Branchiopoda, with monophyletic Cladocera and Anostraca at the base of the branchiopod clade.
At this point one must remember that the phylogenetic
network is not a phylogeny. In comparison with tree
graphs the network (Fig. 4) clearly shows the relative differences in clade-supporting patterns and also effects of
parts of the data that do not have a tree-like structure.

Class I long-branch effects: the symplesiomorphy trap
A symplesiomorphy is a homology. However, it is an old
conserved character state that does not substantiate
monophyly of a clade [37].

In the above-mentioned publication on cirripedes [56] a
basal clade was postulated which contradicts morphological data: the sistergroup relationship between Ascothoracida (represented by Ulophysema) and Acrothoracica
(represented by Berndtia and Trypetesa, a split also seen in
Fig. 1). Using maximum likelihood methods and adding
more outgroup sequences, Pérez-Losada et al. [58] could
show that this monophylum disappears. They point out
that the additional outgroup sequences enable the recovery of the correct tree even with the maximum parsimony
optimality criterion.
These statements do not really explain the mechanism
that produces the wrong topology. The problem lies in the
raw data of the original alignment and is independent of
the tree constructing method. It has been shown previously that the nucleotide pattern supporting the clade
Ascothoracida + Acrothoracica also shares some character
states with the single outgroup sequence in this data set,
indicating that the supporting characters for the clade
Ascothoracida + Acrothoracica are plesiomorphic [59].
This means that the supporting characters are homologous, however, they are old and did not evolve in the
stem-lineage of this clade. Fig. 6 illustrates the effect: old
shared similarities are substituted on the long branch and
conserved in basal clades. They have the effect of synapomorphies.
This certainly is a long-branch effect, however, it is not
based on accumulation of analogies, but on substitution
of synapomorphies. Plesiomorphies will be retained in
slowly evolving taxa and they can also be apparent plesiomorphies that evolved by "back mutations". Signal substitution increases the ratio of plesiomorphies to conserved
apomorphies. This ratio decides whether the basal paraphyletic group appears as false monophylum or not. We
call this the class I long-branch effect. If in Fig. 6 there
would have been new characters on the short inner

Split support spectrum for the data used in Fig. 1. Each column represents the number of sequence positions (indicated
by the height of the column) that provide support for a given split, showing how many positions have conserved character
states for each partition of a split (above and below the horizontal axis). Splits are sorted according to column height. Blue columns represent splits that are not compatible with a binary topology constructed with the strongest and further compatible
splits. The four strongest splits at the left of the spectrum are the same seen in Fig 1. The right tail of the spectrum consists of

branch (arrow A) conserved in following taxa, or if there
were no black squares substituted to other characters, the
correct phylogeny could be inferred. Note that in this case
the branch separating Ascothoracida and Acrothoracica is
short. Therefore, the number of character states that could
support the correct monophylum (in Fig. 6 {(Acrothoracica,(clades 4 and 5)} is too small.
There is a cure for this effect if there exist species that are
closer to the paraphyletic group than those used for the
first analysis. A species added at point B in Fig. 6 sharing
character states with the outgroup would reduce the
number of characters unique to the paraphylum. Adding
species at point C can also help if these species conserve
some of the older character states (black squares in Fig. 6).
Class II long-branch effects: erosion of phylogenetic signal
Class I effects are based on the conservation of old phylogenetic signal in form of plesiomorphies. Branches are
attracted not due to accumulation of homoplasies but by
old homologies. The evolutionary mechanism can be

absence of new character states for younger clades in the
studied genes or subsequent substitution of synapomorphies (saturation effects on long branches). Class II effects
are similar, but they require substitution of phylogenetic
signal with the effect that a clade shares only character
states with distantly related taxa. The resulting false group
is not a paraphylum. This phenomenon has also been
coined "long branch repulsion" [48], however, this term
does not explain the mechanism.
Cases of signal erosion (class II effects) are difficult to
detect. A conflict between morphology and molecular
data in combination with the occurrence of long branches
should be alarming. An example is the case of cladoceran
phylogeny studied by Omilian and Taylor [60]. The data
set consists of nearly complete 28S rDNA sequences of
daphniids. Both maximum parsimony and maximum
likelihood recovered a tree lacking a clade that is robustly
supported by morphological data and also by alignments
of other sequences (16SrDNA and HSP90). The clade
should have been composed of Daphnia dentifera, Daphnia

towards the outgroup taxa (Simocephalus, Ceriodaphnia).
This explanation is illustrated in Fig. 8. If synapomorphies
are substituted on a long branch, a monophylum can be
irrecoverable and the long branch slips down to a wrong
place.
The best remedy for data sets showing class II effects is the
use of genes with lower substitution rates. In the case of
daphniids it seems that 16SrDNA and HSP90 conserve
more signal than the 28SrDNA data set.

laevis and Daphnia dubia. D. laevis and D. dentifera are
morphologically indistinguishable, but nevertheless are
not included in the same clade in the LSU topology.
Instead, the species D. laevis and D. dubia are placed at the
end of a long branch, and both sequences group with D.
occidentalis, which also has a long branch. Omilian and
Taylor [60] attribute this artefact to a long-branch phenomenon. They assume that accelerated evolution of the
LSU gene in the laevis lineage causes the observed effect.
Unfortunately, no other closely related species is known
that could help to break the long branches. Evidence for
the existence of a systematic error comes from the already
mentioned morphology and from other genes.
The phylogenetic network of this data set confirms the
assumptions of Omilian and Taylor [60]. In Fig. 7 there
are several long edges, the most conspicuous ones leading
to {Daphnia laevis, Daphnia dubia} and to D. occidentalis.
The morphologically similar species D. dentifera and {D.
laevis, D. dubia} appear in different species clusters. However, these false groupings can not be attributed to shared
homoplasies because removal of D. occidentalis does not
change the situation (not shown), D. dentifera still retains
its place at distance from its assumedly closest relatives.
This indicates that synapomorphies originally shared by
{D. dentifera, D. laevis, D. dubia} do not exist any more.
The best explanation is that multiple substitutions
occurred along the lineage leading to {D. laevis, D. dubia},
which is the longest inner edge of the topology, with the
result that the correct placement of these species can not
be recovered. The longest branch slips down the tree

Class III long-branch effects: misleading and invisible
attraction due to non-homologous similarities (parallel
substitutions)
If identical character states evolve independently on different branches in greater number, these branches can
cluster to form nonsense clades supported only by chance
similarities. This is the long-branch effect that was first
noted by Felsenstein [61], who found that parsimony
methods are more sensitive to branch attraction than
maximum-likelihood methods. The same phenomenon is
well known in phylogenetic systematics when convergent
morphological characters are used (e.g. the famous case of
neotropical vultures that are not related to old-world
Accipitridae: [62]). The basic cause for class III effects is
that homoplasies can outnumber apomorphies. The
mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 9.

splits exist which are invisible in the published tree topol-

is proportional to the weight of the associated split [30]. The
strongest split separates the outgroups from Branchiopoda,
and within Branchiopoda the best splits support Anomopoda,
Cladocera and Anostraca. For part of the data (small subnet
to the left) there is little signal. These differences in clade
support are not seen in Fig. 3.

ogy is the study of freshwater crayfish by Crandall et al.
[63] based on 16S, 18S and 28S sequences. The phylogenetic network for the original alignment (Fig. 10) shows
facts not recognized in the original publication. The split
between the freshwater clades (Cambaridae, Astacidae,
Parastacidae) and the Nephropidae is most prominent in
this alignment. Very distinct are also {(Cambaridae,
Astacidae), rest)} and {(Virilastacus, Parastacus), rest}. The
other clades of the original paper have a very weak support. Cambaroides, traditionally classified as member of
Cambaridae, shares unique character states with Pacifastacus.
The three most prominent splits found with SplitsTree
(Fig. 10) are also the strongest mutually compatible ones
in the corresponding split support spectrum (Fig. 11).
However, it is clear that splits no. 2, 4, and 7 are mutually
incompatible, each caused by attraction of Cherax to other
taxa. Splits no. 7, 8 and 9 are combinations of Geocherax

and other taxa. Geocherax and Cherax sequences form also
the longest terminal branches in Fig. 10. Since these
sequences are included in several clusters of species with
prominent split support their placement in the published
tree can be the result of class III long-branch attraction
(apparent monophyly based on chance similarities). A
critical clade is the Parastacidae, which seem to be more
diverse and have longer branches than Astacidae and
Cambaridae, implying more conflicting character states.
Split spectra clearly improve after the removal of long
branches. The difference between alignments with and
without long branch taxa increases confidence in the quality of the smaller data set. An example is the 18S rDNA
alignment of Remerie et al [64] used to study the phylogeny of Mysidae (Crustacea, Peracarida), where the placement of the longest branches should not be accepted
without further background information. Fig. 12 shows a
maximum likelihood tree obtained with a GTR + G + I

and 5, the clade Ascothoracida and Acrothoracica is supported by false apomorphies (in reality plesiomorphies, black
squares). This effect occurred in the study of cirriped phylogeny ([55], see also Figs 1 and 2). Short inner branches (arrow

increase the probability of obtaining the false tree.

model. The topology is identical with that of the original
publication, however, the latter did not show branch
lengths. It is obvious that there are three very long
branches (Diastylis sp., Schistomysis spiritus, Acanthomysis
longicornis) which may distort the true phylogeny. Fig. 13
is the corresponding phylogenetic network, while Fig. 14
shows the result after deletion of long branches. The well
supported clades are the same as in the published topology, however, the basal branching patterns are only
weakly supported. Interestingly, deletion of the three
longest branches has in this case little effect on the network, but a strong effect on the spectrum. The split support spectrum of the complete data set clearly
demonstrates the existence of class III effects caused by the

long branches: Fig. 15 is a spectrum for the original data
set, Fig. 16 shows how noise decreases after deletion of
three long branch sequences. In Fig. 15 asterisks mark
some splits that are mutually incompatible and include at
least one of the long branch sequences. In Fig. 16 these
splits disappear among the best 50 splits. Clearly, the
reduced data set is less noisy and should be more reliable.
Whether the accumulation of chance similarities influences the topology of inferred trees must be tested empirically.
A deep phylogeny dominated by long branches and conflict
One of the most debated phylogenetic relationships is
that of nematods with arthropods, which often appears in
molecular phylogenies [65-74] but is contradicted by
other molecular data and by morphology [30,75-86]. We
will not contribute new data to this discussion but point
out that many of the published data sets are not convincing. We use as an example Mallatt et al. [3].

A 50% majority rule consensus topology estimated with
Bayesian inference from an alignment with combined 18S
and 28S rRNA sequences as published by Mallatt et al. [3]
is shown in Fig. 17. Many clades in this topology have
high support values and suggest that this is a reliable analysis. However, the neighbournet graph (Fig. 18) reveals
that this alignment is very problematic. The network contains many long terminal and few distinct internal
branches. Stemminess (relative length of internal
branches) increases when the longest branches are deleted

(not shown), the best support in the interior of the network is that for Pancrustacea. The corresponding split support spectrum (Fig. 19) also reflects these problems: The
four strongest splits are those that are of little interest
(Diptera, Nematomorpha, Onychophora, Nematoda).
None of the deeper nodes is found among the 50 best
splits.
That the data of Mallatt et al. [3] are not reliable is also
indicated by strong contradictions with morphological
data. For example, the published tree has a "mixed" clade
composed of insects and copepods (bootstrap support:
99). Until now not a single morphological character is
known that allows to postulate such a phylogeny. Another
clade has the structure {scorpion, {Limulus, spider}}
(bootstrap support: 100). This would imply polyphyletic
Arachnida. Of course, it is possible to get a binary tree
from weak data. Such a tree shows the best of all mutually
compatible splits, and bootstrap or Bayesian support can

be high if the real phylogenetic signal eroded along long
branches. However, it can not be recommended to trust in
these results because nonsense splits can also be mutually
compatible in an optimal tree.
Phylogenetic signal drowned in noise
Of the examples presented herein, the worst is the data set
published by Pisani et al. [87], a contribution dedicated to
arthropod phylogeny. The authors concatenated nine
nuclear and fifteen mitochondrial genes, however,
sequences are hybrids composed of fragments from several species belonging to the same clade, wherefore a
sequence is named e.g. "Branchiopoda" and not "Artemia
salina". There are only eight hybrid sequences. The
authors stress that they used a very long alignment
(21,313 bp), that inner nodes got high support values,
and that support for a close relationship between myriapods and chelicerates is consistent. The number of
sequence positions is larger than the 10.000 proposed by

Dopazo et al. [79] as necessary to obtain a correct tree, but
nevertheless the data set is not convincing:
The exploratory analysis of this data set is disappointing.
The phylogenetic network shows a Cambrian explosion
without internal resolution (Fig. 20). Fig. 21 is the spectrum for this alignment. In this case we show the complete
spectrum. It contains all possible 127 splits obtainable
from combination of 8 taxa and there is with two exceptions no distinct increase in signal at the left part of the
spectrum. The exception are the first two splits, which
unfortunately are mutually incompatible. This means that
it is not possible to discern here with conserved alignment
positions any phylogenetic signal that is better than the
background noise. The high bootstrap support should not
surprise. It is known that in large alignments bootstrap
replicates will all be very similar [30].

Discussion
We do not intend to discuss here the phylogeny of Metazoa or of Crustacea or all methods proposed in published
literature to improve phylogeny inference. It is the goal of
this contribution to show that data used for published
trees differ extremely in signal to noise ratio despite comparable good node supports. These differences can be
observed only when using tree-independent methods of
visualization of patterns actually present in alignments.
In our analyses, noise is detected when splits are mutually
incompatible. Excluding cases of horizontal gene transfer
(which are very rare among animals), the only explanation for incompatibility is that shared character states are
not homologous at least in one of two mutually contradicting splits. To demonstrate effects of noise we did not
use simulations, but analyzed real data which show

unpredictable patterns. These patterns are real, each position and nucleotide contributing to a pattern can be identified, and nothing is transformed by model assumptions.

ture on modelling of sequence evolution and on adapting
model parameters to empirical data. However, two fundamental problems have not been solved:

For example, the alignment of cirriped rDNA has few
splits with very strong support in comparison with the
right tail of the spectrum (Fig. 2). The support for these
outstanding splits certainly can not be explained with
accumulation of chance similarities. In contrast, the data
set of Pisani et al. [87] has no mutually compatible splits
with a distinctly better support than the multitude of
incompatible splits representing all possible taxon combinations (Fig. 21). There is no evidence for the presence of
compatible signal-like patterns that can not be explained
with chance similarities alone.

(a) As the history of population dynamics in ancestral lineages and the real historical effects of selection and of
population size on site and rate variability usually remain
for ever unknown, substitution models will always be
nothing but averaged approximations. There exists no test
for how close to the historical reality a model is.

It has often been shown that some of the problems caused
by noise can be overcome with adequate substitution
models and also that inadequate models can converge on
the wrong tree [e.g. [5,88-99]]. There exists a huge litera-

(b) There is no test to examine whether available raw data
are good enough to find the correct model parameters.
Models of sequence evolution can be adapted to patterns
present in a real data set. However, it has never been asked
how to test if the information content of an alignment is
sufficient to find a realistic model.
Simulation studies have shown that even if the real model
parameters are known, a tree found by a maximum likeli-

hood method with carefully adapted model parameters
may not be optimal or may not be the only optimal topology [e.g. [100]]. In the end, the probability that trees are
based on historical signal is correlated with the amount of
information conserved in the raw data, no matter what
method of tree inference is used.
Grant and Kluge [101] evaluated in their comprehensive
review a large number of methods used for data exploration. In contrast to split support spectra, none of these
methods is tree-independent. The authors distinguish
between sensitivity analyses (the responsiveness of conclusions to changes or errors in parameter values and
assumptions) and quality analyses (assessment of abilitiy
of data to indicate the true phylogeny). Examples for sensitivity analyses are the bootstrap, jackknife, and other
methods that use pseudoreplicates of character distribution of the same set of data, and also the Bayesian phylogenetic inference, Bremer support, and Wheeler's
sensitivity analysis [102,103]. For a critique of these methods see [101].

Beside bootstrapping, popular tools frequently used by
systematists were for some time the estimation of consistency and of tree length distribution under the parsimony
criterion [104-108] and derived tests that measure departure from a model of randomness. An example for an
elaborate detection of noise with these tools is the study
of the phylogeny of Trichoptera by Kjer et al. [109]. The
authors analysed the skewness of tree length distribution
for the complete data set and for subsets of taxa, the accumulation of substitutions along a "highly corroborated
tree", the consistency index as guide for character weighting. These approaches depend on the assumptions of the
maximum parsimony method or of other optimality criteria and do not identify conflicting splits and differences in
the quality of clade support.
Data quality is for us an estimation of the probability that
phylognetic signal is conserved, without reference to a tree
topology. Several methods have been proposed to identify
quality of alignments in this sense. Grant and Kluge [101]
list among this class of methods spectral analyses, RASA,
and data partition methods. RASA (relative apparent

number of characters shared by two taxa in a three-taxon
comparison. A test statistic is derived essentially from the
rate of increase in pairwise shared character states in comparison with a null model based on randomly distributed
characters (for further details see [36,110,111]). Simmons
et al. [33], using hypothetical and empirical examples
have shown that RASA is not effective to measure phylogenetic signal.
Spectral analysis in the sense of Hendy and Penny [52] is
a tool that visualizes the treeness of data and the amount
of conflict. The more tree-like the data are, the higher is
the probability that shared similarities are homologies.
Our SAMS method also must be classified as a quality
analysis. In this case, the stronger the support of the best
compatible splits is, the higher is the probability of
homology for character states in corresponding supporting positions.

Strategies to improve the signal to noise ratio discussed in
many publications comprise increased taxon sampling,
addition of more genes, deletion of highly variable positions (e.g. third codon positions), R-Y recoding, deletion
of highly variable sequence regions. The application of
better models of sequence evolution is another option
that does not involve manipulation of raw data. The more
costly approaches are increased taxon and gene sampling.
To reduce problems caused by the frequently cited longbranch effects [e.g. [61,112-117]] it is important to know
whether it is more promising to collect additional species
or to sequence additional genes. To decide this it is relevant to distinguish the three long-branch effects.
Class I long-branch effects (the symplesiomorphy trap) can
be overcome with better taxon sampling as already
explained above (Fig. 6). A data set may contain strong
signals consisting of plesiomorphic character states and

erroneously supporting monophyly of paraphyletic
groups. If long internal branches are detected, one should
try to find species that probably attach to these. Addition
of more genes would not help because increasing the
number of shared plesiomorphic homologies would only
stabilize the wrong grouping. The advantages of increased
taxon sampling, especially when taxa addition is not random but controlled by the investigator, have been noted
earlier [e.g. [118,119]], however, an explanation of the
possible mechanisms was missing. For example, Pollock
et al. [120] made simulations in which phylogenetic
reconstruction was affected more by taxon addition and
by sequence length than by moderate variations in substitution rates. The fact that symplesiomorphies may be a
problem was not discussed. Wherever addition of a taxon
changes the topology, the breakup of class I effects may be
the underlying mechanism.

It has been observed earlier that attraction by symplesiomorphies is a phenomenon that occurs simultaneously
with long branch attraction, typically when the four-taxon
case is studied [e.g. [77]]. In the latter case, the two long
branches share analogies, the shorter ones share conserved character states. This is not the same as the class I
effect defined herein: terminal taxa sharing symplesiomorphies must not necessarily evolve slowly (Fig. 6), and
a single long internal branch can already cause the effect
when synapomorphies erode along this branch.
Class II effects (signal erosion) can not be cured by addition
of taxa. What is needed are slowly evolving genes that
hopefully conserve old homologies. Spectra can be used
to control improvement of the signal to noise ratio with
increasing alignment length [121].
Class II effects are expected to be more frequent in deep
phylogenies. The probability that apomorphies are substi-

it would be useful to search for biases (e.g. comparing
nucleotide frequencies in different genes for the same
clades), to remove terminal long branches, to break long
branches by adding taxa, and to consider alternative and
concatenated genes. Of course, a long alignment is no
guarantee for the recovery of the real phylogeny [e.g.
[125]], since more genes will not necessarily correct
biases, the effects of wrong substitution models and class
I long-branch effects. Genome-wide phylogenetic analyses [e.g. [82]] are promising, however, the small number
of available taxa bears a risk [77] because topologies are
composed of many long branches. Another strategy that
can help is to delete highly variable sequence positions to
reduce the number of non-homologous similarities. The
effects of noise reduction are immediately visible in split
support spectra (compare e.g. Figs 15 and 16).

tuted increases with time. This has two consequences: the
certainty for the identification of homologies decreases
with the age of clades, and the evolutionary rate of genes
may seemingly slow down with age because the number
of conserved apomorphies decreases [122,123]. As a consequence, taxa with long branches may be placed at the
base of a tree because of erosion effects. Stiller and Hall
[116] discovered that clustering of eukaryotic protists
basally of a crown group can be explained entirely by the
sequential attachment of longer branches in the absence
of phylogenetic signal. Morin [124] describes long branch
"attraction" as responsible for the basal placement of
Diplomonadida, Microspora and Parabasalia at the base
of the Eukaryota. This certainly is another case of signal
erosion and not of artificial attraction.
Class III long-branch effects (misleading attraction due to nonhomologous similarities) are caused by stochastic accumulation of non-homologous character states due to high substitution rates, old age of lineages, but also by systematic
biases such as convergent shifts in nucleotide frequencies.
It is well known that to strengthen the phylogenetic signal

It has been shown that long-branch effects (usually referring to class III effects) are not only a problem occurring
with maximum parsimony methods; maximum likelihood is not immune to long-branch attraction
[48,59,126]. It is therefore interesting to identify possible
sources of long-branch effects no matter which method of
tree inference is used. In most publications no difference
is made between attraction due to accumulation of analogies, the dominance of symplesiomorphies, or slipping of
a branch down the tree due to signal erosion. An interesting test for putative occurrence of long-branch effects is
the simulation of sequence evolution along topologies,
alternatively with and without junction of long branch
taxa, followed by an analysis of the artificial data to check
for deviations from the true tree [117]. A problem may be
that branch lengths can not be determined accurately
when sequences are saturated in more variable regions
(hidden long branches). If parsimony and likelihood
topologies differ or if a likelihood model with equal rates
gives a topology different from a tree obtained considering rate heterogeneity, then class III phenomena (accumulation of chance similarities) can be the cause.
The saturation phenomenon is part of the long branch
problem. Multiple hits can destroy signal and cause class
II effects when too few conserved synapomorphies remain
after some time, or they cause class III effects when substitutions produce non-homologous similarities.
What are the implicit assumptions of SAMS? The calculation of split support spectra as implemented in SAMS is
based on the assumption that the probability of homology for shared nucleotides is larger if (a) sequence positions are conserved and if (b) a large number of sequence
positions support the same split. Conserved positions are
those that evolve slowly, implying that multiple nonhomologous substitutions should be rare in such sites.
Taking the sum of positions as a single pattern supporting

a split, then splits with larger, more complex patterns are
thought to be more reliable as potential traces of phylogeny than splits with patterns consisting of few positions
(criterion of character complexity as discussed in [121]).
As expected, the spectra of split supporting positions
always show many hundreds of incompatible splits supported by few (e.g. 2–5) positions, but only few that are
backed by a large number (e.g. in Fig. 2). The latter are less
prone to stochastic effects.
The criterion of character complexity used to evaluate support spectra is not the same as the congruence criterion
used in cladistics because cladistic congruence [127,128]
requires a tree topology and does not discern between
character qualities (slow vs. fast evolving characters). The
selection of positions that contain split-supporting infor-

mation is a sort of differential weighting. However, in
contrast to successive weighting schemes it is not intended
to select characters and weights that maximize congruence
on a most parsimonious tree, but we select characters that
maximize the probability that a support consists of
homologous nucleotide patterns in a topology-independent exploration of the alignment. Grant and Kluge ([101]
p. 411) complain that "most methods of quality analysis
function as data purification routines, whereby evidence
is discarded or manipulated to make it conform with
some notion of goodness". We confess that we also want
to discard part of the characters, namely those which bear
with less probability traces of phylogeny and which introduce noise in the data set (difference between Figs 15 and
16). We are convinced that this is legitimate and that the
search for reliable evidence is good practice in science.

Figure 19
Split support spectrum for data as in Fig. 18
Split support spectrum for data as in Fig. 18 (excluding the long-branch taxon Hanseniella). The most prominent
splits are not interesting for the question asked (relationship of major metazoan groups). The data set is not of high quality.

However, we want to avoid circular argumentation, e.g.
we do not select characters that fit to a tree.
Grant and Kluge [101] point out that explorative methods
should perform empirical tests with the potential to refute
a hypothesis. The spectral analysis implemented in SAMS
fulfils this requirement. Empirical data are used to test
either if clades proposed by previous phylogenetic analyses are represented with nucleotide patterns that are
stronger than the background noise, or to test if a given
data set contains distinct signal-like patterns.
The a priori analyses presented herein are fast tools for the
assessment of data quality and we found that results are
intuitively comprehensible. However, we must confess
that even though the split support spectra proved to be
from our point of view of heuristic value, the method is
still imprecise and needs further development. The
threshold of position variability that defines which posi-

tions are accepted as part of a supporting pattern is chosen
arbitrarily (25% variation per column and group) and is
conservative, rejecting many positions that may still fit to
a pattern. Therefore, our spectra show only the contribution of slowly evolving positions. A more objective
method, e.g. derived from entropy theory, or a more flexible tool that allows selection of positions according to
rate differences is still missing. Also, simulations are necessary to study in greater detail effects of systematic biases.

Conclusion
Split support spectra and network analyses are not meant
to replace tree building methods. As used herein, the spectra show only distinct conserved patterns, and many
clades that appear in trees are not represented among the
best splits whenever they are supported by very few conserved positions. This does not mean that such clades are
not real. If some groups of species are closely related, the
number of synapomorphies will be small. However, spec-

alignment contains distinct signals or not, whether a clade
is strongly contradicted, and which clades have the best
support. If mutually compatible signal-like patterns that
surpass the background noise are absent, any tree derived
from such an alignment may contain mainly nonsense
clades.
We found in the examples studied by us that usually all
compatible strongest splits are also represented in trees
obtained with optimality criteria. They determine the
topology. The remaining clades of this topology contain
only those of the weaker splits that are compatible with
the strongest ones. There is one exception, where strong
signals inspire trust in an incorrect phylogeny, namely
when class I long-branch effects occur. Plesiomorphies are
homologies and therefore real historical signal, however,
they do not prove monophyly. Distinction of different
types of long-branch effects as defined herein will help to
decide how to improve molecular data sets.

Methods
A split is a bipartition in a species set, which separates two
groups that comprise together all species of the data set
[129-132]. To find splits present in a data set and to visualize split support we used SAMS. This software written by
one of us (CM) is a successor of the program PHYSID used
for previous publications [34,84,133-135]. An executable
file, a manual and example data blocks are attached here
as additional files (files 12345). SAMS (Splits Analyses
Methods, available from CM upon request) is a tool that
searches for splits present in a data set. The method does
not estimate distances between clades, but offers simple
counts of sequence positions that fit to a bipartition. The
absolute number of positions is not relevant, it is only
informative within a split support spectrum (Fig. 2). The
comparison of split support in spectra allows to discuss
competing hypotheses. These hypotheses can refer (a) to
the monophyly of a group of species or (b) to the phylogenetic information content of an alignment (e.g. "gene A
is better than gene B to infer the history of taxon X"). If
proposed clades are weakly supported, the conclusion is
that evidence for this clade is poor or lacking in a given

alignment. This does not necessarily mean that the group
is not monophyletic.
The most conserved informative positions supporting a
clade are binary, i.e. with two character states only. Each
character state is potentially a plesiomorphy or an apomorphy for a group of a split. Since the real monophylum
and its outgroup are not identified to avoid prior assumptions, it is sufficient to observe that a position clearly supports a certain split. Binary positions are rare, especially if
taxon samples are large because substitutions can occur
on any branch within a clade. Therefore, SAMS adds to a
split-supporting pattern also noisy positions, i.e. positions with more than two character states, if a majority
state within a group still can be identified. One should
expect that noise has a random distribution in supporting
positions. If deviations from a majority character state
accumulate in a single sequence, the corresponding characters could be plesiomorphic states. This phenomenon is

observed in sequences of slowly evolving or of less derived
taxa. Therefore positions with putative plesiomorphies are
not counted (see also [34,121]).
SAMS does not polarize characters. It can be used without
knowledge about the root or the real outgroup species.
Split support is visualized similar to Lento plots [13].
Since character states are often conserved within one
taxon and variable in the outgroup, SAMS counts supporting positions for each group of a split separately. Thus, for
each split of a data set two numbers of supporting positions are given in the spectra, one for each group of species, shown above and below the horizontal axis (Fig. 2).
In Figs 2, 5, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 21 splits (columns) compatible with a published topology are shaded differently
from incompatible ones. In addition, in each column
three different types of positions are discerned: binary

(only two character states), asymmetrical (one partition of
the split with only one character state, the other with more
than one state), and noisy positions (more than one state
in each partition). For further details see [34,135]. If not
stated otherwise, the spectra show only the 50 best splits.
We only labelled splits of special interest, however, SAMS
allows the identification of every split.

SplitsTree V.4 was used to calculate phylogenetic networks
(see [30] for a review of applications). We compare the
network structure based on the neighbornet algorithm
[136] and applying the LogDet transformation
[95,137,138]. LogDet is a distance transformation that
corrects for biases in base composition. Alignments were
obtained directly from the cited authors. Some case studies could not be carried out because the original alignments were not available.
