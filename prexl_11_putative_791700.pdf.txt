Abstract
Background: The Notch signalling pathway is conserved in pre-bilaterian animals. In the Cnidarian Hydra it is
involved in interstitial stem cell differentiation and in boundary formation during budding. Experimental evidence
suggests that in Hydra Notch is activated by presenilin through proteolytic cleavage at the S3 site as in all animals.
However, the endogenous ligand for HvNotch has not been described yet.
Results: We have cloned a cDNA from Hydra, which encodes a bona-fide Notch ligand with a conserved domain
structure similar to that of Jagged-like Notch ligands from other animals. Hyjagged mRNA is undetectable in adult
Hydra by in situ hybridisation but is strongly upregulated and easily visible at the border between bud and parent
shortly before bud detachment. In contrast, HyJagged protein is found in all cell types of an adult hydra, where it
localises to membranes and endosomes. Co-localisation experiments showed that it is present in the same cells as
HvNotch, however not always in the same membrane structures.
Conclusions: The putative Notch ligand HyJagged is conserved in Cnidarians. Together with HvNotch it may be
involved in the formation of the parent-bud boundary in Hydra. Moreover, protein distribution of both, HvNotch
receptor and HyJagged indicate a more widespread function for these two transmembrane proteins in the adult
hydra, which may be regulated by additional factors, possibly involving endocytic pathways.

Background
Early embryonic development is regulated in all animals
by common signalling pathways such as the Wnt-, FGF, Hedgehog-, TGFb/BMP- and Notch pathways. They
have been shown to be present in basal metazoans such
as Cnidarians [1-5]. The fresh water polyp Hydra consists of a simple tube-like body made of two epithelial
layers, the inner endoderm and the outer ectoderm
separated by an acellular mesoglea. It further possesses
a hypostome and a ring of tentacles at the apical end
and a foot at its basal end. Interstitial cells are located
in the spaces between the epithelial cells of both cell
layers. They constitute a pluripotent stem cell lineage
that differentiates nerve cells, gland cells, germ cells and

nematocytes. The latter carry nematocyte capsules used
for catching prey and are unique to Cnidarians [6-9].
The Notch signalling pathway has recently been
shown to be involved in nematocyte and female germ
cell differentiation, as well as in budding [5,10]. Whilst
an inductive function of Notch for terminal differentiation of nematoblasts and oocytes has been suggested the
precise mechanisms are completely unclear. During budding Notch signalling was shown to be important for
the formation of a sharp boundary between the bud and
the parent animal. This seemed to be the preposition
for the bud to make a constriction at its base and form
a foot. As has been shown at many other developmental
boundaries Notch signalling here appears to have the
potential to create patterns where two adjacent cells
adopt different fates. These are signal receiving cells,
which have the Notch receptor, and signal sending cells
carrying a Notch ligand. Notch ligands possess a

characteristic domain, the DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag)
domain, followed by several EGF repeats and a transmembrane domain. Serrate/Jagged-like ligands have an
extra domain, the cysteine rich von Willebrand type C
(VWC) domain, between the EGF repeats and the transmembrane domain. Interaction with Notch receptors
takes place via the DSL domains of the ligand and the
EGF repeats of the receptor [11].
We have now identified a potential Notch ligand in
Hydra. Here we present its sequence and expression
pattern. Comparison of its amino acid sequence with
that of other Notch ligands of the DSL family shows
similarity to Serrate/Jagged-like ligands. We thus named
it HyJagged. Its mRNA expression levels in adult animals were not detectable by in situ hybridisation with
the exception of a remarkable upregulation at final
stages of budding in cells of the parent animal at the
site where the bud detaches. However, immunofluorescence studies with anti-HyJagged antibody revealed the
presence of HyJagged in all cells of adult animals where
it is localised at membranes and in endosomes.

Results
Isolation and characterization of the Hydra Jagged gene

Database searches of the Hydra genome [12] led to a
core sequence prediction for a DSL protein with similarity to Jagged/Serrate-like Notch ligands. After performing 5’ and 3’ RACE experiments the full-length
Hyjagged sequence was amplified from Hydra cDNA
[GenBank:JN036823]. The resulting HyJagged protein
sequence is shown in Figure 1 in an alignment with
mouse Jagged1. It contains a signal peptide (1-22aa), a
DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag) domain (181-252aa), which is
characteristic for Notch ligands (Figure 2) [13], and
five EGF repeats (255-540aa). A cysteine rich domain,
the von Willebrand type C (VWC) domain (549616aa), is located N-terminally of the transmembrane
domain (763-785aa), followed by a short non-conserved intracellular region. Comparison with Notch
ligands from worms, insects and vertebrates further
shows that the modular structure is conserved in
HyJagged (Figure 3). The presence of the von Willebrand type C domain, which is characteristic for Serrate/Jagged-like ligands, led us to name the Hydra
protein HyJagged.
Interestingly, comparison of HyJagged with the predicted sequence of a Notch ligand from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, another Cnidarian, shows
a generally similar domain structure between the two
proteins but also an important difference (Figure 3).
The Nematostella gene encodes a protein with 17 EGF
repeats, whereas HyJagged has only six, which in both
cases nearly matches the number of EGF repeats in
their respective Notch receptors. The DSL domains

between the Notch ligands from Nematostella and
Hydra are also highly conserved (Figure 2).
HyJagged consists of 835 amino acids that are
encoded by 16 exons on a stretch of 11.452 nucleotides.
Comparison of the gene organisation of mouse jagged1
with Hyjagged is shown in Figure 4. All exon-intron
boundaries are flanked by the conserved GT-AG
sequences, 14 of these boundaries appear to be conserved between mouse and Hydra (Figure 4, indicated
by arrows). These reflect the modular organisation of
Jagged proteins in all animals. Most EGF repeats and
the transmembrane domain are encoded by single
exons. However the Hydra DSL domain and the mouse
VWC domain, as well as the signal peptides of both
proteins are encoded within two exons, respectively.
mRNA expression of Hyjagged

To look for expression of the Hyjagged gene in adult
hydra in situ hybridisation experiments were performed.
These showed no signal, indicating that Hyjagged is
expressed at very low levels in contrast to the expression
of HvNotch, which shows very high levels of mRNA all
over the animal [5]. This is in accordance with the fact
that no ESTs encoding HyJagged could be identified in
the libraries.
However, when we looked for Hyjagged mRNA during
budding we found a very strong expression of the gene
during budding stage 9. This is when the bud begins to
form foot cells. The signal was present in cells of the
ectoderm of the parent animal and coincided with the
expression zone of the Hydra FGF-receptor homolog
kringelchen (Figure 5).
Protein localisation of HyJagged

In order to study the subcellular distribution of
HyJagged in hydra cells the protein was overexpressed
as a GFP fusion protein in single cells of intact animals
and observed in vivo (Figure 6). For detection of plasma
membranes and endosomes the membrane-selective dye
FM4-64 was injected into the gastric cavity and the animals were imaged at different time points afterwards.
FM4-64 is usually detected at membranes first but is
then increasingly enriched in endosomes, which become
larger over time [14]. In Figure 6 we show the distribution of FM4-64 in cells of live imaged animals over a
period of 20 hours. HyJagged-GFP hardly co-localised
with FM4-64 at membranes at the time points indicated.
However, it was seen in punctuate and ring-like structures in the cytoplasm. Some of these clearly corresponded to FM4-64 positive structures and thus most
likely constituted early and late endosomes. We then
compared this HyJagged-GFP distribution with the localisation of HvNotch-RFP in epithelial cells. Figure 7
shows that both proteins are localised in punctuate and

ring-like structures, however they only partially colocalised.
In the absence of detectable mRNA for the putative
Notch ligand Hyjagged we thought to look for the endogenous HyJagged protein. We therefore raised an antibody in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding
to 18 amino acids of the intracellular domain of
HyJagged. The antibody recognised the intracellular
domain of HyJagged when it was expressed in E.coli
after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Additional file
1A). In addition, on a Western blot with a vesicle fraction from Hydra the antibody recognised a band at an
apparent molecular weight of 130 kDa. This is larger
than the HyJagged primary sequence suggests (96 kDa),
most probably due to post-translational modification of
mature HyJagged. Heavy glycosylation of EGF repeats is
well documented for Notch ligands (recently reviewed
in [15]).
The anti-JAG-IC antibody also detected HyJagged in
immunofluorescence experiments, when we expressed it
as GFP fusion protein in human HEK293T cells. This is
shown in Additional file 1 D-G. In a transient transfection experiment in HEK293T cells HyJagged-GFP did
not reach the membrane but was instead trapped in the
ER as can be seen by strong staining of the nuclear
envelope. This incorrect distribution of HyJagged is
most probably due to incomplete post-translational processing of the hydra protein in human cells [16].

Nevertheless this experiment clearly shows that the antibody recognises HyJagged specifically in immunofluorescence. It did not react with any other human protein in
HEK293T cells. We therefore used this antibody for
immunofluorescence on Hydra whole mounts. Here it
stained membranes and punctuate structures in the
cytoplasm of epithelial cells all over the animal (Figure
8). A weak increase of the staining in comparison with
the surrounding tissue was detected in budding animals
at stage 9 at the base of the bud in the ectoderm of the
parental animal (Figure 9). This is in accordance with
the in situ hybridisation data, which indicated strong
mRNA expression in this region.
In addition to epithelial cells, cells of the interstitial
cell lineage were also stained with the antibody. This
was seen especially in nerve cells of the basal disc (Figure 10). Co-immunofluorescence experiments with the
anti-JAG-IC- and anti-Nv1-antibodies were performed
in order to relate HyJagged-positive cells to a specific
cell type. The anti-Nv1-antibody is specific for sensory
neurons in the tentacles and ganglion cells in the peduncle [17]. Co-staining with anti-JAG-IC showed that
these ganglion cells also contained HyJagged, but in
addition, HyJagged was also present in Nv-1 negative
neurons (Figure 11).
In order to identify HyJagged proteins in cells of the
nematocyte line we used a rat monoclonal antibody
against HyZic protein since Hyzic mRNA is known to

be expressed in proliferating nematocyte precursors [18].
Rats were immunized with HyZic protein that we produced in E.coli. The resulting monoclonal antibody antiZIC7A12 detected the recombinant protein on Western
blots. Moreoever, it stained a band of 46 kDa, which
corresponds to the predicted size of HyZic in Western
blots from hydra lysates (Additional file 2). In addition,
in immunofluorescence experiments it recognised a
HyZic-GFP fusion protein when expressed in hydra cells
(see Additional file 2). On Hydra whole mounts the
anti-ZIC7A12 antibody strongly stained single and double interstitial cells and nests of nematoblasts before
their exit from mitosis. Weaker staining was observed in
post-mitotic nematoblasts, which already had formed a
small vacuole. In further developed nematocytes HyZic
was not detected anymore. This distribution of HyZic

protein in Hydra is in good agreement with published
data about the localisation of its mRNA in proliferating
nematoblasts [18]. Figure 12 shows that single and pairs
of interstitial cells highlighted with the anti-ZIC7A12
antibody also contained HyJagged in a punctuate pattern. This was also the case in proliferating nematoblasts. However, in finally differentiated nematocytes
negative for HyZic very strong HyJagged staining was
observed (Figure 12 Q-T, nc). In conclusion, while all
cells of the nematocyte line seem to have HyJagged protein, its abundance increases in terminally differentiated
cells.
Finally, we wanted to compare the cellular localisation
of HyJagged with that of HvNotch. To this end we
raised an antibody in chicken against HvNΔE (the Hydra
Notch receptor HvNotch without its extracellular

domain) after its expression in E.coli. It detected HvNΔE
after expression in E.coli by SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting down to a concentration of 8, 9 ng (see Additional file 3A). Furthermore it recognised overexpressed
HvNotch-GFP fusion protein in human HEK293T cells
in immunofluorescence experiments (see Additional file
3). We thus used it for co-immunofluorescence staining
on Hydra whole mounts together with the anti-JAG-IC
antibody. Both antibodies stained membranes of epithelial cells and cells in the interstitial spaces, however, the
patterns did not completely overlap. Moreover, both
antibodies stained punctuate structures in the cytoplasm. From co-localisation experiments of live images

where HvNotch and HyJagged clearly co-localised with
the membrane selective dye FM4-64 we concluded that
these punctae most likely correspond to endosomes.
However, HyJagged- and HvNotch antibody signals in
endosomes do not generally co-localise. Moreover,
HyJagged signals appear stronger localised on the membranes in comparison with Notch, this is especially
obvious in interstitial cells (Figure 13).

Discussion
In this work we have identified a potential ligand for
HvNotch in Hydra, HyJagged. It has the same modular
structure as Notch ligands from higher animals and the

closely related Cnidarian Nematostella, which is also
reflected in the conserved exon-intron structure of its
gene between Hydra and mouse. The protein includes a
DSL domain, which is responsible for the interaction
with the extracellular EGF repeats of the Notch receptors in flies and mammals [11]. Moreover, HyJagged
possesses a relatively small number of EGF repeats and
a transmembrane domain. Comparison of the abundance of EGF repeats in Notch ligands and receptors
shows some interesting similarities: Species with large
extracellular domains in their Notch receptors (e.g.
Nematostella, Drosophila and mouse) also have a high
number of EGF repeats in their Serrate/Jagged-like proteins (however not in Delta) and vice versa (Figure 3
and [5]).
Thus, although we have not provided experimental
evidence, we suggest that HyJagged constitutes the only
canonical Notch ligand in Hydra. A second gene encoding a DSL domain is also present in Hydra. It has been
identified previously and was shown to be expressed in
gland cells [19]. The resulting protein is 332 amino
acids long, has a signal peptide and a DSL domain and
thus shows some structural homology with DSL2, a
soluble Notch ligand from C.elegans. It would be

interesting to see whether this protein is involved in
Notch signalling in Hydra.
In situ hybridisation showed that Hyjagged was not
visibly expressed on the mRNA level in intact Hydra
with the exception of a very strong upregulation at budding stage 9. We have previously described that Notch
signalling is important for late budding stages in Hydra.
Whilst as early as at budding stage 5-6 HvWnt8 and the
Hydra FGFR-homolog kringelchen demarcate the
boundary between the parent animal and the bud
[20,21] budding cannot be completed without Notch
signalling. The gene expression zone of kringelchen
remains diffuse and a crucial metalloprotease, MMP-A3
is not induced. Thus the bud cannot constrict and does
not form a foot. Two stripes of gene expression are
required for correct patterning of the bud, one leading
to constriction involving MMP-A3 and the other leading
to differentiation of the buds foot cells involving expression of foot specific genes such as ppod-1. For these to
form we proposed a model including mutual inhibition
and lateral activation on the basis of Notch signalling at
this boundary [10].
Our model required that cells which express kringelchen at the boundary express a Notch ligand. The data

shown here are partially in accordance with this
assumption because Hyjagged is expressed in cells that
also express kringelchen at the boundary between parent
and bud. However, the timing of this upregulation is
unexpected. While constriction begins in budding stage

8, Hyjagged mRNA could only be detected at the beginning of budding stage 9. Hyjagged expression during
earlier budding stages probably occurs in too low
amounts to be detectable by in situ hybridisation experiments. Antibody staining clearly shows the presence of

HyJagged at the basis of buds, however, only a weak
increase in its level at this position in comparison with
the remaining tissue is detectable (Figure 9). At this
point we clearly have not used techniques suited to
uncover precise quantitative differences in the amounts
of HyJagged mRNA and protein at the cellular level during the final stages of budding. Therefore we cannot
exclude the possibility that the observed requirement for
Notch signalling at the boundary between parent and
bud involves a mechanism that does not include a direct
HyJagged-HvNotch interaction.
In contrast to the generally undetectable levels of
mRNA expression outside the boundary between parent
and bud, HyJagged protein is clearly present in all cells
of the animals. The same is true for HvNotch. Although

this makes it difficult to conclude whether there is
active Notch signalling going on, the presence of the
proteins is not unexpected. Notch signalling is highly
regulated by factors involved in post-translational modification of the receptors (e.g. Fringe) [22], by the activity
of metalloproteases like ADAM [23] and of presenilin as
catalytic subunit of the g-secretase complex and also by
endocytosis of both, the Notch receptors and the ligands
[24,25]. Endocytosis is part of a mechanism that leads to
mutual inhibition of the signal sending and signal
receiving cells. This means that signalling cells have
higher levels of ligand but inhibit the propagation of
Notch signals from adjacent cells and vice versa [26].
That way signalling can be induced by small differences
in the concentration of receptors and ligands in this

system, which might be hard to detect in immunofluorescence experiments [27]. We have shown that GFP/
RFP-tagged HyJagged and HvNotch are indeed localised
in endosomes (this work and [5]). However, the fluorescently tagged protein did not completely co-localise
with each other within these structures. Differences in
the localisation of the endogeneous proteins were also
seen in immunofluorescence experiments. HyJagged
appeared stronger localised at membranes whereas
HvNotch showed a slightly stronger staining of punctae
in the vicinity of the membranes. In interstitial cells
membrane staining was completely lacking with the
HvNotch antibody.
In Hydra, Notch signalling might also be regulated
through post-translational modification of receptor and
ligand as genes encoding metalloproteases of the
ADAM family, the glycosyltransferase Fringe and the

ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb, which regulates endocytosis
of Notch ligands, are present in the genome [12]. Their
expression patterns might be conclusive in the future in
order to understand the precise molecular mechanism
by which Notch signalling exerts its profound impact on
pattern formation and stem cell differentiation in Hydra.

Conclusions
We report here the identification of the Hyjagged gene,
which encodes a protein with great similarity to canonical Notch ligands from worms, insects and vertebrates.
Its mRNA is especially strongly expressed at the constriction site of budding animals, confirming the conserved role for Notch ligands during boundary
formation. Furthermore, both HvNotch and HyJagged
proteins are found in all cells of adult animals indicating
a general role for Notch signalling in regulating cellular

communication in Hydra. The differential distribution of
both proteins in endosomes indicates that endosomal
pathways may play an important role in modulating
Notch signalling.

Denatured His 6 -tagged-HyJagged-ICD, -HvN ΔE ,
-HvNICD, -HyZic, -HyHES and -CnASH were produced
in E.coli and affinity-purified using nickel sepharose
(Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant HvN ΔE and
HyZic were used for antibody production, recombinant
HyJagged-ICD, HvNICD, HyZic, HyHES and CnASH
were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot using
anti-Notch (dilution 1:100), anti-JAG-IC (dilution
1:500), anti-ZIC7A12 (dilution 1:1), anti-HES (dilution
1:500) and anti-CNA7B10 (dilution 1:1) antibodies.
Antibody production

PCR amplification of Hyjagged sequences

Hydra cDNA for RACE experiments was obtained with
the GeneRacer Kit with Superscript III (Invitrogen). 5’
and 3’RACE experiments were performed using the
gene specific primers 5’-CCCATTTGTT GTGAGGC
GTA AAGCTGATGT AAGTGC-3’ and 5’-GGAGTTGCAA AATGTACAGA TGCATGGTGT GG-3’. Fulllength Hyjagged was then amplified from Hydra cDNA
by PCR.
Whole mount in situ hybridisation experiments

Single whole mount in situ hybridisation experiments
were carried out using Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes
as described before [17,28].
Construction of GFP and RFP fusion proteins

Full-length Hvnotch was cloned into the NheI and SmaI
sites of the HoTRed expression vector. Full-length
Hyjagged as well as Hyzic were cloned into the modified
EGFP expression vector HoTG(reen) [29] into the NheI
and SmaI sites for overexpression from the Hydra actin
promoter in hydra cells.
For expression in mammalian cells HvNotch and
Hyjagged genes were cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI
sites of the expression vector pEGFP (Clontech), leading
to expression of C-terminally GFP-tagged proteins.

Anti-Notch antibody was produced in chicken by Davids
Biotechnologie GmbH by immunisation with recombinant HvNΔE. A portion of the resulting polyclonal antibody was then affinity purified.
For the anti-JAG-IC antibody a peptide corresponding
to a stretch of the intracellular domain of HyJagged
(VNKDNLKKGIFKTISRKS) was produced by Davids
Biotechnologie GmbH and used for immunisation of
rabbit. The resulting antibody was then affinity purified.
For the anti-HES antibody a peptide corresponding to
a stretch of the region shortly before and the begin of
the basic domain of HyHES (RHPMKEKRRANKPLLER)
was produced by Davids Biotechnologie GmbH and
used for immunisation of rabbit. The resulting antibody
was then affinity purified.
Monoclonal anti-ZIC7A12- and anti-CNA7B10-antibodies were produced in rat as described in [30].
Recombinant HyZic and CnASH were used for
immunisation.
Cultivation and transfection of HEK293T

Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS
and 5% Pen/Strep at 37°C and 5% CO2. 293T cells were
transfected using PEI pH 7,0.
Antibody staining of HEK293T

Transfection of Hydra cells

GFP- and RFP-constructs were introduced into hydra
cells using a particle gun (Biorad) as described previously [29]. After 1-2 days cells expressing the GFP and
RFP fusion proteins were clearly visible.
Production of recombinant proteins

To allow expression in E.coli the coding sequences for
HvN ΔE (HvNotch without its extracellular domain),
HvNICD , Hyjagged-ICD, Hyzic, HyHes and Cnash were
cloned into the vector pRSET (Invitrogen) using the
BamHI and EcoRI sites for HvNΔE, HvNICD, HyjaggedIC and Hyzic, and the EcoRI and XhoI sites for Cnash
and HyHes.

HEK293T cells at 70-80% confluence were seeded on
glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates and incubated
for 24 h at 37°C. After that the cells were transfected
with the specific DNA. After 24 h the coverslips were
washed twice with PBS, and the cells were fixed in 4%
PFA in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. After
washing the cells again, they were permeabilized for 15
minutes with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed twice
with PBS and incubated in blocking solution (10% FCS,
0,2% Tween 20, PBS) for one hour at room temperature.
Cells were then incubated with primary antibody (antiNotch antibody (dilution 1:100) or anti-JAG-IC antibody
(dilution 1:50)) for further 60 minutes at room temperature. After that, they were washed three times for 10

minutes in washing solution (1% BSA, 0,2% Tween 20,
PBS) before they were incubated in secondary antibody
for one hour at room temperature. Finally, cells were
washed three times for 10 minutes with washing solution, incubated with TO-PRO 3 (Molecular probes, 1
μg/ml in PBS) for 5 minutes and mounted on slides
with Vectashield (Alexis Biochemicals).
Subcellular fractionation

500 hydra were dissociated into single cells in dissociation medium (3.6 mM KCl; 6 mM CaCl 2 ; 1.2 mM
MgSO4; 6 mM sodium citrate; 6 mM sodium pyruvate;
6 mM glucose; 12.5 mM TES; and 50 mg/ml rifampicin,
pH6.9) by pipetting. After centrifugation the resulting
cell pellet was resuspended and incubated for 4 hours at
18°C on a rotator in 20 μM of the proteasome inhibitor
MG-132 (Sigma). The cells were then incubated on ice
in 500 mM Saccharose, 10 mM Tris, 2 mM EGTA
pH7,4, 10 ng/ml Pepstatin A, 10 ng/ml Aprotinin, 10
ng/ml Leupeptin, 0,5 mg/ml Pefablock for 20 min before
homogenization with a Potter-Dounce homogenizer.
The homogenate was differentially centrifuged. The
1000 g and 100.000 g pellets were separated by SDSPAGE and Western Blots were stained with the antiJAG-IC (dilution 1:500), rabbit preimmune serum
(1:1000), anti-HES (dilution 1:500), anti-ZIC7A12 (dilution1:1) or anti-CNA7B10 (dilution1:1) respectively.

they were mounted on slides with Vectashield (Alexis
Biochemicals).
Confocal imaging

Living animals with GFP-expressing cells were stained
with FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) for detection of plasma
membranes and endosomes. 1 μl of 500 μM FM4-64 in
hydra medium was injected into the gastric cavity of
Hydra. The animals were then incubated in 50 μM
FM4-64 in hydra medium for 20 minutes to 20 hours.
Living animals with GFP- and RFP-expressing cells
were relaxed in 2% urethane and scanned immediately.
Light optical serial sections were acquired with a Leica
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) TCS SP confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an oil
immersion Plan-Apochromat 100/1.4 NA objective lens.
Fluorochromes were visualized with an argon laser with
an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission filters
of 520-540 nm for EGFP and Alexa488 and 640-760 nm
for FM4-64, and with a helium-neon laser with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm and emission filter of 660760 nm for TO-PRO3. For Cy3 and RFP the excitation
wavelength was 561 nm and an emission filter of 570580 nm was used. Image resolution was 512 × 512 pixel.
The 8-bit grey scale single-channel images were overlaid
to an RGB image assigning false color to each channel,
and then assembled into tables using Adobe Photoshop
10.0 and ImageJ 1.37 k software.

Antibody staining of whole Hydra

For membrane staining of endogenous HvNotch and
endogenous HyJagged whole animals were relaxed with
2% urethane and fixed with PFA/EtOH (2% PFA, 70%
EtOH, PBS) for 30 minutes. They were then washed
twice for 5 minutes with PBS followed by an ethanol
treatment. Therefore hydra were treated with 20%, 30%,
40%, 50%, 75% EtOH in PBS and 100% EtOH, followed
by 75%, 50%, 40%, 30% and 20% EtOH in PBS, each for
5 minutes. Further staining was performed as below,
starting with permeabilization.
Other immunofluorescence staining experiments were
performed by relaxing animals with 2% urethane and
fixation with 4% PFA in hydra medium for 1 hour.
Hydra were then washed three times for 10 minutes
with PBS before they were permeabilized for 15 minutes
with 0,5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Animals were blocked
for 15 minutes with 0,1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA in PBS
and incubated in anti-Notch antibody (dilution 1:100),
anti-JAG-IC antibody (dilution 1:50), anti-Nv1 (dilution
1:2) or anti-ZIC7A12 (dilution 1:1) for 1 h at room temperature. Hydra were washed three times 10 minutes in
PBS followed by incubation in secondary antibody for 2
h at room temperature. Before the animals were stained
with TO-PRO3 (Molecular probes, 1 μg/ml in PBS) they
were washed in PBS three times 10 minutes. Finally
