Modern and ancient red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in
Europe show an unusual lack of geographical
and temporal structuring, and differing responses
within the carnivores to historical climatic change
Amber GF Teacher1,2*, Jessica A Thomas1 and Ian Barnes1

Abstract
Background: Despite phylogeographical patterns being well characterised in a large number of species, and
generalised patterns emerging, the carnivores do not all appear to show consistent trends. While some species
tend to fit with standard theoretical phylogeographic expectations (e.g. bears), others show little obvious modern
phylogeographic structure (e.g. wolves). In this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new
phylogeographical study of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) throughout Europe, using a combination of ancient DNA
sequences obtained from museum specimens, and modern sequences collated from GenBank. We used
cytochrome b (250 bp) and the mitochondrial control region (268 bp) to elucidate both current and historical
phylogeographical patterning.
Results: We found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern populations, as well as differentiation
associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic drift. Despite high sequence
diversity (11.2% cytochrome b, 16.4% control region), no evidence for spatial structure (from Bayesian trees) is
found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either gene, and Bayesian skyline plots suggested little
change in the effective population size over the past 40,000 years.
Conclusions: It is probable that the high dispersal ability and adaptability of the red fox has contributed to the
lack of observable differentiation, which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of years.
Generalised patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical climatic change are not
necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting
how species will be affected by future climatic change.

Background
Many studies have looked at the phylogeographic patterns of species, primarily using mitochondrial DNA
sequence comparisons, and linked the patterns seen
today to severe climatic changes in the past [1,2]. During
the Pleistocene (approximately 2.6 million to 12,000
years ago), Europe experienced cyclical glacial and interglacial periods, with the last glacial period ending

approximately 10,000 years ago [1]. These fluctuations in
climate had profound effects on species distributions,
and during glacial periods temperate species in Europe
are thought to have been forced south into warmer refugial areas, primarily in Iberia, Italy and the Balkans,
although other smaller cryptic refugia have also been
proposed [3-6]. Following the retreat of the glaciers
towards the North, species were able to recolonise the
now warmer and more habitable northern regions of Europe. These patterns of range contraction and expansion
have shaped the genetic diversity in modern populations
through a combination of genetic drift and gene flow.

Within Europe, genetic studies on terrestrial species
typically find divergent clades which represent the refugial
origins of the focal species during the glacial periods [3,4].
Many taxa show a deep split between Eastern and
Western European clades, which likely reflects two main
refugial origins in Iberia and the Italo-Balkan region [2],
and generally speaking, we now have a good understanding of the routes of post-glacial expansions for various terrestrial species [1,4](Hewitt, 1999, Hewitt, 2004).
Furthermore, we also have a good understanding of how
these expansions occurred; theory suggests that long-distance migrants become founders of new populations [7,8],
replacing the previous orthodoxy which suggested that
expansions were a result of substantial genetic drift [9,10].
A loss of genetic variability typically accompanies such
range expansions, with populations that are further from a
refugium tending to have lower genetic diversity [3].
However, carnivores in particular seem to show discordant patterns, with some species showing strong phylogeographical structuring, whilst others show no evidence of
structuring. For example, population divergence is found
in brown bears in Europe and North America [2,11] and
black bears in North America [12], whilst no such phylogeographical structuring is found in North American coyotes [13]. Likewise, little evidence for partitioning of
haplotypes at a regional or even continental scale has been
found for another carnivore, the grey wolf [14,15]. It
seems probable that species with relatively high dispersal
rates, combined with high adaptability to a range of habitats (i.e. high capabilities for migration and gene flow) may
show less phylogeographical structuring. The swift fox, kit
fox and arctic fox have also been shown to have little
within-species phylogeographical structuring [16,17], however these species are refined to relatively small, specific
habitat regions and so might not be expected to show
structure within such restricted areas (see http://www.
canids.org for distribution maps).
We present a phylogeographical study within Europe of
a species that is widespread throughout the Northern
hemisphere; the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Previous studies
on the red fox have indicated that three distinct subclades
exist in North America, reflecting two recent colonisation
events from North to South, and one widespread clade
representing an earlier colonisation event from South to
North [18]. However, an allozyme and cytochrome b study
of modern red fox from ten locations in Southern Europe
and Israel revealed little geographical structure in this limited region [19]. Our study provides a substantially wider
geographical coverage of Europe, and includes ancient
DNA samples dating approximately up to 40,000 years
old, allowing us to add a temporal component to the
study. In this study we aimed to assess the evidence for
separate clades that might be associated with different

refugial origins, and whether there is any evidence for a
population bottleneck and subsequent expansion (as
might be related to the Last Glacial Maximum). In addition, we considered the impact of genetic drift, by looking
for patterns of isolation by distance and time-associated
changes in haplotypes. To approach these questions, we
examined variation in two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
genes, cytochrome b and the control region. Cytochrome
b (Cytb) is relatively conserved, and as such can be used to
resolve deeper splits, whilst the control region harbours
higher diversity and can provide higher resolution [20,21].
The use of two mtDNA gene fragments allows us to have
more confidence in the results, and to help to resolve any
potential ambiguities. Mitochondrial DNA is the most
appropriate marker in this instance as the mutation rate is
rapid enough to provide variability over the time scales in
question, and recombination is very unusual, enabling
straightforward interpretation of the patterns observed
[21].

Methods
Modern data

Published modern red fox sequences were collated from
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for both cytochrome b and the control region. Accession numbers,
location information and references are listed in additional
file 1, and a map is shown in Figure 1. On the occasions
where multiple GenBank entries were found with an identical location and sequence, the data were collapsed into a
single sequence and only one accession number is given.
For incidences where a source had listed one haplotype
for multiple countries, this was expanded so that there
was a separate sequence for each country where this haplotype was found; multiple sites within the same country
were given unique sample names.
Ancient samples

In total, 165 European red fox bone or tooth specimens
dating to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene were collected from museums and colleagues (locations, dates and
donors of samples successfully amplified are listed in additional file 2). Samples were drilled onto UV-sterilised aluminium foil to ensure that there was no crosscontamination, using a clean 0.8 mm engraving cutter.
Approximately 10-40 mg of bone powder was used for
DNA extraction using a standard protocol for ancient
bone samples [22]. Blank extractions were performed with
every batch. Extractions were performed in a separate isolated laboratory, and standard precautions were taken for
working with ancient DNA [23]. Six primer pairs were
designed to amplify the cytochrome b and control region
in six overlapping fragments for each marker, using Primer3 [24]. The cytochrome b primers were as follows

Primers were initially tested for efficacy using modern
samples (donated by Dr. Peter Wandeler, Universität
Zürich-Irchel and Dr. Frank Zachos, ChristianAlbrechts-Universität Zu Kiel). Samples were amplified
using PCR with the following reaction mixture at a total
volume of 25 μl: 15.1 μl sterile double-distilled water,
2.5 μl BSA (1%), 0.4 μl each primer at 10 pmol (MWG,
Germany), 0.25 μl dNTP mix (Invitrogen, UK), 0.3 μl

Taq Platinum (Invitrogen, UK), 2.5 μl PCR buffer (supplied with Taq), 1 μl MgSO4 (supplied with Taq), 4 μl
DNA. The samples were denatured at 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a final elongation step of 72°C for 7 min to complete fragment extension. Negative controls were run using blank extraction
samples for each PCR run. Purification and sequencing
was outsourced to Beckman-Coulter Genomics (Essex,
UK). Six overlapping sequences were obtained for each
gene, and all sequences were inspected manually to
ensure that they were correctly scored.
Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were aligned using Sequencher v.4.8 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Michigan, USA) and the resulting
contigs consisted of 250 base pairs cytochrome b and
268 base pairs control region for the 35 ancient samples
which successfully amplified at all 12 fragments. Modern
sequence data was trimmed to cover the same regions.

All ancient samples had sequence for both gene fragments, but because the modern sequences were
obtained opportunistically from GenBank, we were not
able to obtain sequence data for both markers for the
majority of the modern samples.
We used jModeltest v.0.1.1 [25,26], and the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), to select the best-fit model
of evolution for each gene fragment individually. A Bayesian consensus tree of the sequences was constructed
using MrBayes v.3.1.2. [27]. Cytochrome b and control
region sequences were concatenated for each individual,
and for modern individuals where both gene sequences
were not available the sequences were simply coded as
missing data. The data was run as a partitioned dataset,
with the evolutionary model for each gene (as determined
by jModelTest) coded in, and allowing for each partition
to evolve under a different rate. Only those models that
did not include a proportion of invariant sites were considered, owing to the intra-specific nature of the data.
Sampling was set to every 100 generations for 3 × 106
generations with four chains (average standard deviation
of split frequencies < 0.02). We coded the chosen model
of nucleotide substitution, and excluded the first 25% of
samples as burn-in. The arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) was
used as an outgroup (Accession numbers: Cytochrome b
AY598511, control region DQ500882). To see if they
provided any additional information, maximum likelihood trees were also produced using MEGA version v5.0
[28], using 500 bootstraps and the HKY model of evolution for the following datasets: (i) Cytb modern samples,
(ii) Cytb modern+ancient samples combined, (iii) control
region modern samples, (iv) control region modern
+ancient samples combined, and (v) Cytb and control
region combined for ancient samples.
Sequences were then collapsed into haplotypes using
TCS v.1.21 [29], converted to Arlequin format [30]
using FaBox v.1.35 online [31], and the resulting files
were used to obtain network distance connections using
Arlequin v.2.000 [30]. Networks were then drawn separately for each gene fragment (as it is not possible to
allow for a partitioned dataset for such analyses) using
HapStar [32].
Isolation by distance

In order to check for a geographical signal within our
dataset, we correlated genetic distance to geographical
distance. Pairwise nucleotide distance matrices were
produced for seven datasets using MEGA v.5 [28]: (i)
Cytb modern samples, (ii) Cytb ancient samples, (iii)
Cytb modern+ancient samples combined, (iv) control
region modern samples, (v) control region ancient samples, (vi) control region modern+ancient samples combined, and (vii) Cytb and control region combined for
ancient samples. Approximate co-ordinates were

Page 4 of 9

identified for each site (see additional files 1 and 2)
using Google Earth http://www.google.com/earth/index.
html, and geographical distance matrices were created
for each dataset using the Geographical Distance Matrix
Generator [33]. Mantel tests were performed for each
dataset using the Isolde function in GenePop on the
Web [34,35], with 10,000 permutations.
Temporal analyses

Past population dynamics can be reconstructed by estimating demographic parameters using the coalescent
approach implemented in BEAST [36]. Ancient DNA can
provide both temporal and phylogenetic information
through the use of tip-dated sequences. In order to determine whether there was sufficient temporal signal in the
data to estimate substitution rates accurately, we first conducted a date randomisation test following Firth et al.
[37]. This test involves generating 20 datasets in which the
tip-dates of each sequence are randomly shuffled. The estimates of substitution rate from these ‘randomised’ datasets
can then be compared to the rates estimated for the ‘real’
dataset. The presence of sufficient temporal signal is
assessed by determining whether the mean rate estimates
of the real dataset fall outside the 95% highest posterior
density (HPD) intervals for the rate estimates of the randomised datasets. Ancient sample ages for tip-dating were
inferred through stratigraphic correlation (layer dating);
any samples without dates, or with approximate or infinite
ages were not included in the BEAST analysis (see additional file 2). The arctic fox outgroup A. lagopus was also
excluded. For the BEAST analysis, models of sequence
evolution for each partition were determined in jModelTest [25,26], with the nucleotide frequencies and substitution rate parameters estimated from the data. A strict
clock was assumed (linked across partitions), with a constant size coalescent tree prior.
The dynamics of population size through time can be
estimated using the Bayesian skyline plot in BEAST
[36]. This analysis was run for 50 million generations,
with parameters (described above) and genealogies
sampled every 10,000 iterations and the first 20% discarded as burnin. As a number of sequences were
obtained from layer-dated samples, with their ages given
as ranges rather than as point estimates; uniform priors
were used to model the uncertainty in these ages, rather
than point-estimates (see additional file 2).

Results
We successfully sequenced all six ancient DNA fragments for 35 samples out of the 165 collected, though
some small sequence gaps were present (Figure 1, additional file 2, GenBank accession numbers JN232446JN232515; this success rate of 21% is similar to comparable ancient DNA studies [e.g. [38,39]]. The successful

Teacher et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/214

samples represent 24 localities and 9 countries. We also
obtained 38 modern cytochrome b sequences from GenBank, from 22 localities in 12 countries, and 39 control
region sequences from 15 localities in 7 countries.
Sequence diversity was high within the datasets; 26 haplotypes were identified in the cytochrome b sequences
(modern + ancient), and 47 haplotypes in the control
region sequences. We identified 28 (11.2% of bases) and
44 (16.4% of bases) polymorphic sites in the cytochrome
b and control region fragments respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses

The jModelTest analyses determined that the least complex
model of evolution with the best fit to the cytochrome b
data was the HKY model (Ti/Tv = 6.4802, unequal base
frequencies freqA = 0.289, freqC = 0.231, freqG = 0.156,
freqT = 0.324), and for the control region was the TIM2+G
model (unequal base frequencies freqA = 0.295, freqC =
0.241, freqG = 0.137, freqT = 0.328, unequal substitution
rates rAC = 0.244, rAG = 5.916, rAT = 0.244, rCG = 1.000,
rCT = 2.133, rGT = 1.000, scaled to rGT, and gamma shape
distribution = 0.130).
The Bayesian tree (Figure 2) showed no obvious geographically or temporally based clades, despite reasonable
sequence diversity (see above). Although some smaller
clades can be seen, the posterior probabilities do not show
particularly high support, all but one (Luxembourg) of the
locations found in the smaller clades are also found in the
larger main clade (England, France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Poland and Switzerland), and it is of note that the
most basal sample is not an ancient sample, but a modern
Austrian sample. The maximum likelihood trees were less
informative than the Bayesian tree, with very low bootstrap support values (typically < 60) and consequently
have not been included. Haplotype networks for cytochrome b and the control region (Additional files 3 and 4)
also show no indication of haplotype clustering, and both
networks show a star-like construction, which is consistent
with gradual population expansion. Furthermore, there
appears to be no clustering by sample age; ancient samples
do not seem to cluster together, nor do they appear only
at the centre of the networks (as might indicate an expansion event from the ancient samples), nor do they appear
only at the edges of the networks (as could indicate a bottleneck). Specifically, it is worth noting that the oldest
samples (Austria 30 ka, Austria 35-40 ka and England 5928 ka) do not cluster together.
Isolation by distance

We detected a slight but statistically significant signal of
positive isolation by distance in one dataset: (iv) control
region modern samples (R 2 = 0.048, p(one-tailed) =
0.026). No evidence for isolation by distance was
detected for the remaining datasets: (i) Cytb modern

Page 5 of 9

samples, (ii) Cytb ancient samples, (iii) Cytb modern
+ancient samples combined, (v) control region ancient
samples, (vi) control region modern+ancient samples
combined, and (vii) Cytb and control region combined
for ancient samples.
Temporal analyses

The models of sequence evolution for the BEAST analysis were determined by jModelTest as the HKY model
for the cytochrome b data and the TIM1+G model for
the control region (this differs slightly from the cytochrome b model used for the phylogeny, as a reduced
dataset comprising of only dated samples was used for
the BEAST analysis; see additional file 2). The date randomisation test indicated there was sufficient temporal
signal in the data to estimate substitution rates, with the
mean rate estimates for the real datasets falling outside
the 95% HPD intervals of the date-randomised datasets
(see additional file 5). The mean substitution rate was
estimated as 2.987 × E-7 substitutions/site/year. The
Bayesian skyline plot (Figure 3) indicates a marginal
increase in population size over the last 40,000 years,
compatible with the hypothesis that there was no substantial change in red fox population size during the last
glacial maximum and into the Holocene.

Discussion
We detected signals of isolation by distance (in modern
control region samples), as well as differentiation associated with time, but we did not detect any evidence for a
historical bottleneck or for phylogeographical structure
within Europe. Furthermore, this lack of structure
appears to have been consistent over tens of thousands
of years, though it is also possible that structure existed
historically but that we were unable to detect it. Our
results imply that low levels of random genetic drift have
caused slight changes over space and time, but that fox
populations in Europe were most likely not forced into
glacial refugia, instead managing to survive the glaciations as a single large interbreeding population.
Isolation by distance and time

Evidence for isolation by distance was only detected in
the modern control region sequences; however it is
probable that the modern cytochrome b data simply did
not have the resolution to detect this pattern. No isolation by distance was detected in any of the ancient datasets tested (or the combined modern and ancient
datasets for either gene), most likely because while the
modern dataset represents a snapshot in time, the
ancient samples come from a very wide time range, and
so patterns of isolation by distance may be obscured.
The degree of isolation by distance detected most likely
represents the effects of random genetic drift.

Figure 2 Bayesian tree. This tree was produced using a partitioned dataset including cytochrome b and the control region for all ancient
samples and modern samples. Many modern samples only had one gene represented, and so the other gene was coded as missing data.
Ancient samples are marked with a black circle and an approximate date, whilst all others are modern samples.

Date randomisation tests revealed differentiation associated with time, i.e. there is a detectable correlation
between genetic distance and temporal distance.
Several haplotypes are shared between modern and
ancient samples (despite several tens of thousands of
years separating some of the samples), and the ancient
samples do not form a separate or basal clade, providing
supporting evidence that changes over time have not
been severe. Again, these changes over time can probably be attributed to random genetic drift.
Lack of phylogenetic structure or evidence for a
bottleneck

Phylogenetic studies frequently detect separate lineages
in Europe which reflect population bottlenecks, isolation
in glacial refugia, and subsequent recolonisation.

However, we found no evidence for separate lineages
within our data, and our Bayesian skyline plots indicate a
relatively constant population size. Furthermore, there is
no evidence of a severe loss of unique haplotypes dating to
before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, circa 23,300 to
27,800 years ago [40]) as might be expected from a bottleneck (Figure 3). These results combined suggest that the
red fox was present in Europe throughout the glaciation,
rather than being forced into glacial refugia with re-emergence and population expansion during the warmer periods. However, it is also possible that historical population
structure may have existed but is undetected in our study,
perhaps due to a relatively small sample size from each
time period. Undetected historical phylogeographic structure could have since been reduced by gene flow, leading
to a lack of structure in modern samples.

Our findings provide strong support for those of previous smaller scale studies, which found little genetic
structuring in modern red foxes in the South of Europe
and Israel [19], or in France [41]. Our findings do however appear to be contradictory to a previous study in
the red fox which found some evidence for phylogeographic structuring in North America [18], however it is
probable that this difference reflects the very different
histories of the two regions. American red foxes are
thought to have been isolated for a long time (during
the Wisconsin glaciation, between 110,000 and 10,000
BP) in two disjunct refugia [42,43], However, there is no
evidence for such a prolonged glaciation and subsequent
isolation of populations in Europe; as such, the results
of our study and that of Aubry et al. [18] are not necessarily contradictory to each other. It is probable that
two characteristics of the red fox may have contributed
to the lack of structuring found in our study; a high dispersal rate, and high adaptability to different habitats.
Dispersal and adaptability

Dispersal ability is expected to have a strong effect on
genetic differentiation, as high dispersal can mean high
gene flow and thus lower levels of differentiation. The
red fox has a highly flexible social system, with both dispersing and non-dispersing males and females [44].
Those that do disperse are known to do so over large distances, for example a mark-recapture study showed that
a single fox, tagged as a pup, had dispersed 302 km in
North Dakota [45]. Mean dispersal distances of tagged
pups were quoted within the same study as 35 km
for males and 25 km for females, with the majority of

recoveries of tagged individuals occurring by 1 year.
Another species that shows little phylogeographic structure, the grey wolf, also has a very high dispersal rate,
with movements of over 1,000 km recorded for an individual [14], and coyotes also show low structuring and
high dispersal (50-100 km) [13,46,47]. However, dispersal
rates alone are not enough to explain why some carnivores show phylogeographic structure whilst others do
not. The degree of specialisation versus adaptability is
also likely to play a key role. The red fox is highly adaptable, as exemplified by a range that encompasses almost
the entire Northern hemisphere, including regions above
the arctic circle, and South as far as Yemen and Northern
India [48]. Sub-fossil assemblages indicate that between
38-25 BC (i.e. before the LGM), the distribution of the
red fox is likely to have covered central Europe, and at
least as far north as Southern England [49]. A radiocarbon date from the UK of 28,641 ± 468 cal BP [50] confirms that this species was present in Northern Europe
up to a very short time before the LGM. Following the
LGM, and the retreat of the glaciers, the red fox is
thought to have quickly returned to central Europe, and
fossils have been found within assemblages that date to
15,500 BP in northern Germany [51], and from 16,00015,500 BP in south-eastern Germany [52]. When this
information is combined, it seems that the red fox was
likely only forced into the warmer South for a short period during the LGM. Iberia, Italy, Southern France, the
Balkans, the Carpathians and the Crimean peninsula
have all been suggested as possible glacial refugia for the
red fox, based on the sub-fossil record [reviewed in
[49,53]]. However, there are records of this species being
present in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia during the
LGM, indicating a wide and continuous range during this
period [53]. This information from the fossil record, and
circumstantial evidence that this species highly adaptable
and able to survive in sub-arctic conditions today, both
support our genetic findings in indicating that the red
fox may not have been strictly restricted to refugia during
the European glaciations.
Differences in dispersal ability and adaptability can
cause very different outcomes, as respectively exemplified
in the following two species studies, brown bears and
artic fox. In a study on brown bears (Ursus arctos), Valdiosera et al. [38] showed that although bears in modern
Europe do show differentiation into major lineages, this
pattern breaks down in ancient samples. The authors
concluded that this highly adaptable species, with its very
flexible diet, was able to survive across a large area in
Southern Europe during the glaciations, as we are suggesting was also the case for the red fox. However, in
contrast our findings for the red fox, brown bear lineage
separations occurred later, most likely due to low

Teacher et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:214
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/214

dispersal distances and decreasing population sizes. A
rather different pattern can be found within the Arctic
fox however, which is a relatively specialist species but
with good dispersal abilities. A recent phylogeographic
study on the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) examined the
haplotypes that were present in Europe during the Pleistocene and compared these with the present-day haplotypes. This study indicated that arctic fox populations
from mid-latitude Europe became extinct as the climate
warmed at the end of the last ice-age, and that this species did not track its arctic habitat as it shifted North to
Scandinavia; the present-day Scandinavian arctic foxes
are thought to originate from a later expansion event
from Siberia [39]. This is strongly in contrast to our findings from red fox, which indicate little change in haplotypes present despite substantial climatic change.

Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a
study has found such a spatially and temporally wide-scale
lack of phylogeographic structure in a terrestrial species
within Europe. Our study adds to a collection of phylogeographical studies on carnivores, which when looked at
together indicate that there may be a difference in
response to historical climatic change between species
with differing traits such as dispersal rates and adaptability.
It seems likely that the high dispersal abilities, and adaptability to a wide habitat range, has led to the lack of observable differentiation in the red fox, and it is possible that
such traits mean that this species may respond well to
future climatic changes. However this also raises our
awareness that quite similar species can respond very
differently.
A comprehensive study into the life-history traits of carnivores, including their niche breadth, dispersal abilities,
home range, body size, and responses to historical climatic
change would perhaps be enlightening, allowing a deeper
understanding of the traits that determine how a species is
likely to be affected by changes in habitat availability.
Realising that generalised patterns are unlikely to be
applicable to all species, and understanding the differences between how species responded to historical climatic changes may help us to create better predictions
of how animal species will be affected by climate
changes in the future.
