Abstract
Background: Union of the Comoros suffered a severe East Coast Fever epidemic in 2004. Rhipicephalus
appendiculatus was probably involved in pathogen transmission as this competent tick species, although previously
absent from Comoros, was sampled on 4 animals on one geographical site during the epidemic. We carried out an
entomological survey on all three islands of Union of the Comoros to establish cattle tick species distribution with
a special emphasis on R. appendiculatus. We investigated R. appendiculatus intraspecific diversity as this species has
been previously shown to be split off into two main cytoplasmic lineages with different ecology, physiology and
vectorial competence. This survey also included sampling of live cattle imported from Tanzania to investigate the
possibility of tick introduction through animal trade.
Results: Our data show that Comoros cattle are infested with Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus microplus and
R. appendiculatus. This latter species has established throughout Grande Comore but is absent from Anjouan and
Moheli. Interestingly, 43 out of the 47 sequenced R. appendiculatus ticks belong to one single highly competent
lineage while ticks from the other lineage where only found on imported cattle or on cattle parked at the vicinity
of the harbor. At last, 2 ticks identified as R. evertsi, a species so far virtually absent on Comoros, were sampled on
imported cattle.
Conclusions: This survey shows that importation of live cattle is clearly a source of vector introduction in
Comoros. The wide distribution of one highly competent R. appendiculatus lineage on Grande Comore, together
with the absence of this species on the two neighbouring islands is in accordance with the rapid and disastrous
spread of East Coast Fever epidemics on Grande Comore Island only. Whether the other R. appendiculatus lineage
as well as R. evertsi species will succeed in establishing permanently on Grande Comore needs to be monitored.

Introduction
The Comoros archipelago lies in the north entrance of
the Mozambique Channel, roughly 180 miles East of
Tanzania and 180 miles West of the North Western tip
of Madagascar. The archipelago is composed of 4
islands, one of them, Mayotte, being under French
administration. The islands of Grande Comore, Moheli
and Anjouan, compose Union of the Comoros. In the
last 10 years, the country has been affected by three successive epidemic waves whose causative agents were
highly suspected to spread from East Africa. In 2002/
2004, an East Coast Fever epidemic, a tick-borne disease

transmitted by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, led to the
death of 10% of cattle on Grande Comore [1]. The isolated Theileria parva strains, once genotyped, were
shown to be closely related to the strain Muguga, widely
used for vaccination in East Africa. In the following
year, a severe Chikungunya epidemic hit the country [2]
before spreading to Reunion Island [3], then to most of
the Indian Ocean islands and continental countries and
eventually to Europe, where indigenous transmission
was recorded in 2007 [4]. Finally, in 2008, a first case of
human Rift Valley Fever was diagnosed in Mayotte Hospital Center in a child arriving from Union of the
Comores [5]. This first human case was followed by several human deaths on Madagascar and partial sequence
analysis showed that viral strains circulating in Madagascar were very similar to strains circulating in Kenya

in 2006-2007 [6]. Only scarce epidemiological data are
available as far as Comoros are concerned. However,
phylogenetic studies carried out on Chikungunya [3],
the timing of spreading of both Chikungunya and Rift
Valley Fever viruses in the region together with T.
parva genotyping in Grande Comore [1] strongly suggest that Comoros are a main entrance gate for pathogens introduced from East Africa. The emergence of
these pathogens to the other island states probably
depends on human and trade exchanges among these
islands, as well as on the presence of competent vectors
and putative reservoirs in the newly colonized areas.
Therefore, entomological investigations on Comoros
and the neighbouring islands, together with a dedicated
surveillance of human and animal exchanges between
East Africa and Comoros are of primary importance in
controlling emerging vector-borne diseases in the whole
South Western Indian Ocean region.
Comoros capital Moroni is located on Grande
Comore. Most international trade goes through Moroni
international airport or harbor and is then distributed to
Anjouan and Moheli. The country has been importing
goods and livestock from Tanzania since the year 2000
after the signature of a free trade bill between Union of
the Comoros and Tanzania. It is interesting to note that
most cattle movements inside Union of the Comoros
unidirectionally target Grande Comore where traditional
weddings require important bovine slaughtering. As a
result, cattle imported from East Africa or reared in
Grande Comore are only rarely sent to Anjouan and
Moheli while cattle movements between Moheli and
Anjouan and from both islands towards Grande Comore
are common. These movements certainly have important implications in terms of vector and pathogens
dissemination.
In this paper, we report a comprehensive entomological survey carried out on Union of the Comoros cattle.
A special emphasis was put on Rhipicephalus appendiculatus species as a known vector of Theileria parva.
Although only a few specimens were previously sampled
on four animals at a single site [1], this tick species is
suspected to have established permanent populations on
Grande Comore since the East coast Fever epidemic was
widespread in 2004. This species has not been previously described on either Moheli or Anjouan Islands.
In this survey, ticks were collected from the whole
country as well as on imported cattle arriving by boat
from Tanzania into Moroni harbor. In addition to morphological identification of collected samples, we conducted molecular investigations to assess the intraspecific genetic diversity of the Comorian populations of
R. appendiculatus. Indeed, former studies have shown
that this species may be separated in two genetically distinct cytoplasmic lineages with marked different ecology

Page 2 of 8

and distribution [7-10]. Phylogenetic investigations were
thus carried out on R. appendiculatus to identify their
lineage and origin. The consequences of our findings on
the epidemiology of tick-borne disease in the Comorian
archipelago are discussed.

Methods
Study sites and tick sampling

All the islands of the archipelago are distributed 25 to
40 miles apart. Despite their volcanic origin, they differ
markedly in their geographical and geological features:
Grande Comore is the youngest island and its active
Karthala volcano the highest summit (2361 m) of the
archipelago. The porosity of its ground leads to the
absence of watercourses while both Anjouan and Moheli
exhibit developed hydrological systems. This geological
diversity may have important consequences in terms of
arthropod-borne diseases. Ticks were sampled throughout the three islands of Union of the Comoros during
the rainy season, from January to February 2010. Sampling sites were randomly selected in the frame of a cattle surveillance program conducted by CRVOI (Centre
de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Emergentes
dans l’Océan Indien). Fourteen sites were sampled on
Grande Comore, 14 on Anjouan and six on Moheli.
Altogether, 16 of the 17 districts of Comoros were
sampled. On each farm, up to five animals, cows and
goats, were sampled as follows: animals highly infested
were first identified by a rapid visual check-up and
examined; in the absence of highly infested animals, five
were randomly chosen and carefully examined. All ticks
were collected on animals with low infestation. Animals
with more than 150 ticks were sampled as follows: up to
20 ticks were collected sequentially from feet, legs, anus,
scrotum, udder, neck, ears and eyes. All ticks collected
from one anatomical part on a single animal were
pooled regardless of species and stadia. In the case of
farms possessing less than five animals, an adjacent farm
was investigated to complete the sampling.
Complementary to the sampling of ticks in farms,
samples were collected from imported cattle parked in
quarantine paddocks located in the vicinity of the harbor within 24 h after cattle landing, since it was not
possible to sample ticks directly on board of merchant
vessels. Cattle from three distinct vessels between 2009,
December 12th and 2010, February 11 th were studied.
The name of the boat, the references of the trader were
taken and each sampled cattle anonymously identified.
Diagnosis and spatial analysis

Ticks were identified morphologically with the help of
the key provided by Walker et al. [11]. Diagnosis was
confirmed on some of the samples by using cytochrome
oxydase 1 (co1) encoding a gene sequence widely used

Yssouf et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:38

in barcoding projects [12]. The geographical positions of
the collection sites were localized by a Global Positioning System. These coordinates were used to create maps
with ArcGIS 9.3 management data software (ESRI,
Union of the Comoros) by using sampling data (species
and tick number) or R. appendiculatus haplotype number as inputs.

in Table 1 and Figure 1-A, R. microplus is the most frequently occurring species on all three islands with a
maximum in Anjouan where 98% of the collected ticks
belong to this species. Our data show that R. appendiculatus species is widely distributed on Grande Comore
but is absent on the neighboring Anjouan and Moheli
islands, despite substantial sampling efforts to detect
this species.

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

DNA was extracted with Qiagen DNA and tissue kit following the instructions of the manufacturer except that
an additional overnight proteinase K step was added to
the provided protocol. Mitochondrial co1 locus was
amplified by PCR with LCO1490 and HCO2198 primers
as previously described [13]. Amplicons were directly
sequenced after PCR purification and primers sequences
were removed before alignments. In addition to the produced sequences, available R. appendiculatus sequences
were downloaded from GenBank and added to the analysis (accession numbers: AF132833 from Zimbabwe,
DQ859261-1, DQ859262-1, DQ859265-1, DQ859266-1,
DQ901361-1, DQ901363-1 and DQ901364-1 from Zambia, DQ901356-1 from South Africa, DQ901357-1 from
Grande Comore, DQ901358-1 and DQ901359-1 from
Kenya, DQ901360-1, DQ901362-1 and DQ901363-1
from Rwanda). Two additional sequences, one for R. turanicus (DQ859260) and one for R. evertsi (AF132835)
were included as outgroups. Alignments were conducted
with ClustalW. However, no insertion-deletion was
observed in the alignment file. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted in MEGA4, using the Neighbor-Joining
method [14] and the Kimura 2-parameter method [15].
Bootstrap values were calculated with 10 000 replications.
All positions containing missing data were eliminated
only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion
option). Median spanning network was also constructed
using version 4.5.1.6 of the Network software [16].

Results
Distribution of tick species in Union of the Comoros’
cattle

The identification of 1986 collected ticks showed that
cattle are infested with 3 tick species: A. variegatum, R.
appendiculatus and R. microplus. Goats were sampled
on Grande Comore and some of them were found to be
infested with A. variegatum (data not shown). As shown

Tick species introduction through livestock trade

Each of the 3 investigated boats carried between 6 and
54 cows and altogether 132 tick specimens were collected. As shown on Table 1 and Figure 1-A, imported
cattle display a different infestation pattern since they
are mainly infested with A. variegatum although R.
appendiculatus and R. microplus were also sampled.
Two specimens belonging to Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi species were sampled on imported cattle.
Genetic characterization of the Rhipicephalus ticks found
in Grande Comore

Forty-three R. appendiculatus specimens collected
throughout Grande Comore and six specimens sampled
on imported cattle (4 R. appendiculatus and 2 R. evertsi)
were sequenced for the co1 locus. The identification of the
two ticks found in the quarantine paddocks as belonging
to R. evertsi (AB002 and AB013) was confirmed by their
co1 sequence. Among the R. appendiculatus sequences
that were already available in GenBank, sequences range
from 793 (AF132833 and AF132835) to 478 nucleotides
sites. The new sequences obtained in the present study
range from 633 to 699 nucleotides sites. The NeighborJoining phylogenetic tree based [8] on co1 sequences (Figure 2) shows the presence of two clades, an “eastern
clade”, supported by a 99% bootstrap value, gathering samples from eastern Zambia, Rwanda and Grande Comore,
and a “southern clade” supported by a bootstrap value of
86% and gathering samples from southern Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa and Grande Comore. When
considering the alignment of 478 nucleotides sites
described by Mtambo et al. 2007 [9], respectively six and
three haplotypes can be recognized in the eastern and the
southern clades. Within the southern clade, in addition to
the previously described haplotypes H1 and H2, we have
identified a new haplotype, that we have named haplotype
H9 (see Figure 3) corresponding to the sequences

DQ901358 and DQ901359 from Kenya. This new haplotype is due to the variable position number 261 and 339.
The H1 and H2 haplotypes (with 36 and 53% of the individuals from Grande Comore respectively), are by far the
most frequent haplotypes in Grande Comore. The H2
haplotype has not been found so far outside from this
archipelago. When considering a longer alignment, we
have been able to identify four new variable sites. On the
basis of those additional variable sites, two new variants
can be identified within the haplotype H1: H1a with an
“A” at position 222 of AF132833 sequence from Zimbabwe - also found in AY020 specimen sampled in a farm
on Grande Comore, and H1b with a “G” at this position,
found in the 16 other H1 haplotype collected in Grande
Comore. Among the six haplotypes found in the eastern
clade, the H3 haplotype is the most common one and is
represented by five ticks in our sampling (i.e. 11% of the
individuals from Grand Comore): three from ticks collected on the imported cattle and two from ticks sampled
in a farm located 1.5 mile away from the harbor.

Discussion
Recent human or animal outbreaks have illustrated that
the Comoros archipelago may have constituted a bridge
for the colonization of pathogens in the Indian Ocean

islands from East Africa. In this frame, entomological
surveys dedicated at inventorying tick species may be
especially useful to prevent future epidemic events.
Investigating intra-specific genetic variability may also
be used, especially if the genetic variants have different
vectorial competence for a given pathogen agent, or can
inform on the geographical origin of an introduced
vector.
The present study has revealed that A. variegatum, R.
microplus and R. appendiculatus are the three species
infesting Comoros cattle. R. microplus is the most common species in the country while R. appendiculatus was
found on Grande Comore Island only, where it is widespread. Such a distribution is in accordance with the
spreading of East Coast Fever on the entire Grande
Comore island during the 2002-2004 epidemic while no
case was reported on Moheli and Anjouan. The actual
distribution of R. appendiculatus on Comores relieves at
least temporarily the threat for an East Coast Fever epidemic on Moheli, Anjouan as well as on the French
administrated Mayotte Island.
Beside locally reared cattle, it appears that imported
cattle are also infested with ticks, although displaying a
different infestation pattern. These cattle are infested
with A. variegatum, R. microplus, R. appendiculatus and

sequences provided by the present study are indicated by a black dot (ticks collected in farms) or a black triangle (ticks collected from imported
cattle) in front of the sequence name (containing the accession number). The values above nodes correspond to bootstrap values, with only
values superior to 80 indicated [20]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances
used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [15] and are in the units
of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons
(Pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 793 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [21].

R. evertsi evertsi. This latter species is the most widespread of all Rhipicephalus species in Africa [11] but
was not previously described in Comoros. This species
is a known vector for babesiosis as well as a potential
vector for Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever [17] and
must therefore be considered as a potential threat.
Although this species was not found outside from the
cattle parked in the quarantine paddocks, whether or
not this species will succeed in establishing on Comoros
will need to be monitored.
Morphological, physiological and phylogenetical data
support the existence of at least two distinct R. appendiculatus stocks representing two ecological groups
[8-10,18], i.e. a group found in Southern and Eastern
Africa (Southern stock, distributed in South Africa,

Southern Zambia and Zimbabwe) and a second group
distributed mainly in Eastern Africa (Eastern stock,
found in parts of Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda). Both stocks display major morphological, ecological and epidemiological differences [7]. Ticks from
the southern stock are larger, display a unimodal phenology and obligatory diapause while ticks from the
Eastern stock are smaller than their southern stock
counterparts, display a bimodal phenology and require a
photoperiod induction for diapause. Additionally, ticks
from the southern stock were reported to be more competent for T. parva than ticks from Eastern stock [19].
Our phylogenetic tree, based on the mitochondrial gene
cytochrome oxydase 1, clearly shows that 89% of the
sequenced ticks from Grande Comore belong to the

Yssouf et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:38
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/38

southern stock clade. Two ticks sampled on cattle
within farms displayed an East African stock haplotype
and were noteworthy collected just 1.5 mile off the
Moroni harbor. Four R. appendiculatus specimens collected on imported cattle were shown to belong to both
clades. Therefore, although both lineages are imported
from East Africa, it seems that the eastern lineage has
not established a stable and permanent population on
Grande Comore. This difference in the colonization pattern of the two lineages may be due to a better fit of the
ticks from the southern stock to the ecological conditions found on Grande Comore. Alternatively, this pattern might result from a founder effect. However, it is
interesting to note that we observe a higher haplotypic
and species diversity in imported cattle and in the harbor neighborhood. Such pattern rather supports a better
adaptation of ticks from the southern stock to Grande
Comore ecological conditions.
The geographical origin of the H2 haplotype, only
found in Grande Comore to date, may be identified in
coastal areas of East Africa by extensive sampling surveys. Moreover, additional and more discriminatory
genetic markers could be developed to trace the route
of colonization followed by R. appendiculatus in the
Comoros archipelago.
