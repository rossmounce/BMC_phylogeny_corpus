molecular analysis and phylogenetic
characterization of viral surface proteins
isolated between 1997 and 2009 from the
human population

Abstract
Background: H9N2 avian influenza A viruses have become panzootic in Eurasia over the last decade and have
caused several human infections in Asia since 1998. To study their evolution and zoonotic potential, we conducted
an in silico analysis of H9N2 viruses that have infected humans between 1997 and 2009 and identified potential
novel reassortments.
Results: A total of 22 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences
were retrieved from the NCBI flu database. It was identified that mature peptide sequences of HA genes isolated
from humans in 2009 had glutamine at position 226 (H3) of the receptor binding site, indicating a preference to bind
to the human a (2-6) sialic acid receptors, which is different from previously isolated viruses and studies where the
presence of leucine at the same position contributes to preference for human receptors and presence of glutamine
towards avian receptors. Similarly, strains isolated in 2009 possessed new motif R-S-N-R in spite of typical R-S-S-R at
the cleavage site of HA, which isn’t reported before for H9N2 cases in humans. Other changes involved loss, addition,
and variations in potential glycosylation sites as well as in predicted epitopes. The results of phylogenetic analysis
indicated that HA and NA gene segments of H9N2 including those from current and proposed vaccine strains
belong to two different Eurasian phylogenetic lineages confirming possible genetic reassortments.
Conclusions: These findings support the continuous evolution of avian H9N2 viruses towards human as host and
are in favor of effective surveillance and better characterization studies to address this issue.

Background
The H9N2 influenza A viruses have been known to
cause infection in the poultry population around
the globe including Ireland, Iran, Germany, Italy,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and USA since
mid-1990 s [1]. In 1998, domestic pigs from Hong
Kong were also observed to be infected with H9N2
influenza Y280-like viruses [2]. Several human cases
of H9N2 infection have been recorded since 1997
from Hong Kong and China in children and adults

exhibiting influenza like symptoms and mild upper
respiratory tract infections [2-6]. Genetic analysis of
H9N2 viruses from Hong Kong live bird markets
showed the preferential binding of viruses to 2,
6-linked sialic acid, human-like receptors [6,7]. All
these findings pointed towards the possibility of interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses and its persistent threat to the human population.
Influenza viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviradae
family of viruses are divided into eight single stranded
RNA segments encoding ten proteins. These include
two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA), along with nucleoproteins (NP),
three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, PB2) two matrix

proteins (M1, M2) and non-structural proteins (NS1,
NS2) [8-11]. Of these ten proteins HA and NA are primarily responsible for facilitating influenza virus infection. There are 16 HA and nine NA subtypes. HA is
involved in the early stages of infection, causing the
binding of the sialic acid receptor present on the host
cell surface, and leading to fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane and subsequent entry into the host
cell [11]. Virus aggregation is prevented by the NA glycoprotein and by the cleavage of the a-ketosodic linkage
between sialic acid and an adjacent sugar residue. This
facilitates the movement of the virus to and from the
site of infection by destruction of receptors recognized
by HA [12]. Previous studies have defined two distinct
lineages of H9N2 influenza viruses: North American and
Eurasian. The Eurasian lineage can be further divided
into three major sublineages; the G1 lineage, represented by A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (G1-like); the
Y280 lineage, represented by three prototype viruses
A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (Y280-like), A/Chicken/
Beijing/1/94 (BJ94-like), and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/
97 (G9-like) and the Korean lineage, represented by
A/chicken/Korea/38349-p96323/96 (Korean-like) and
A/duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97 (Y439-like) [7,13,14].
It is important to study the evolution of H9N2 viruses
because of their constant prevalence in poultry flocks and
repeated emergence in the human population. The present
study involved computational molecular analysis and phylogenetic characterization of 11 influenza A (H9N2)
viruses which have been isolated between 1997 and 2009.
The aim of this study was to aid in understanding the evolution of pandemic H9N2 strains, which have circulated
various animal populations in the indicated period.

extent of antigenic variations between viruses was
checked by the CTL epitope prediction method [18].
Each amino acid sequence of HA and NA was evaluated
separately using consensus approach.
Phylogenetic characterization and tree construction

Phylogenetic patterns of NA and HA nucleotide sequences
of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated between 1997 and 2009
from humans were observed using MEGA4.0.2 [19]. The
selected nucleotide sequences based on local alignment
and homology searches using BLAST were aligned by
using CLUSTALW. Unrooted phylogenetic trees were
constructed by using minimum evolution analysis with
maximum composite likelihood and the Tamura-Nei
model. Internal branching probabilities were determined
by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates and are indicated
by percentage value on each branch.

Results and Discussion
Molecular Analysis

Influenza A viruses of subtype H9N2 are now considered to be widespread in poultry and have demonstrated
the ability to infect humans [20]. The recurring presence
of H9N2 infections in humans has raised concerns
about the possibility of H9N2 viruses evolving into pandemic strains. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the
potential pandemic threat posed by H9N2 viruses using
experimental and computational approaches. During
this study, bioinformatics analysis of HA and NA from
H9N2 viruses was performed and the key residues in
receptor binding sites (RBS), the cleavage motifs of HA
and NA hemadsorbing sites (HB), stalk length and
enzyme active sites were studied in detail.
Hemagglutinin

Methods
Viruses

To perform this study, a computational search of all
reported cases of influenza A H9N2 human infections
from 1997 to 2009 was conducted. A total of eleven
nucleotide and their respective deduced amino acid
sequences for each of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments were retrieved from the NCBI flu
database [15] accessed on April, 19, 2010. The viruses
used in this study are listed in Table 1. Sequencing data
was obtained together with information of the host, subtype, isolation year, and isolation place. The selected
sequences of H9N2 human cases were then aligned and
compared by using multiple sequence alignment software
ClustalW2 [16].
Potential Glycosylation sites and antigenic variations

Identification and comparison of N-glycosylation sites
into reported protein sequences of HA and NA was performed by an online server ScanProsite [17] and the

It has been well documented that the receptor binding
site motif of HA is critical for cellular receptor specificity and determining virus host range [21,22]. Out of
five conserved amino acids in the pocket of the HA glycoprotein, two positions showed the maximum number
of mutations (198, 234) and three remained 99% conserved (191, 235, and 236). The pattern of observed
mutations at position 198 was E198T, E198A, E198V and
E198D, whereas for position 234 was L234Q, Q234L and
Q234M as summarized in Table 2. Mutations in these
regions are considered strong factors for change in
sugar specificity thus leading to change in host specificity. The presence of glutamine (Q) at position 234 (H3
numbering: 226) is a typical avian virus signature, and it
has been reported that presence of this amino acid
results in a preference for binding to 2,3-linked sialic
acid (avian receptors) whereas, in the case of leucine (L)
at the same position, there is a preference for 2,6-linked
sialic acid (human receptors) and potential cause of
reported human infections [5,6,23-25]. However, upon

analysis of amino acids at the receptor binding site of
HA glycoproteins, we have identified that H9N2 viruses
isolated in 2009 from infected patients in Hong Kong
possessed glutamine at position 234 (H3 numbering:
226) instead of leucine as has been found in previous
isolates, yet still somehow managed to bind with human
sialic receptors. As shown in Table 2, this residue variation in avian H9N2 viruses has not been reported before
in human cases. This observation can be correlated
with a number of phenomena such as genetic evolution
of influenza viruses in order to evade host defense
mechanisms, and transfer of this virus from swine to
humans instead of avian to human transmission. It is
also known that pigs act as a “mixing vessel” because
viruses isolated from pigs recognize both types of sialic
receptors [26] and most importantly represent the balance that exists between the activities of HA and NA.
Both the genes PB2 and HA are known to be critical for
the pathogenicity of the virus. Therefore, the role of
other proteins such as the PB2 segment [4,27] must be
viewed as potential causes of zoonotic H9N2 possibly
resulting in future human to human transmission.
Analysis of the HA cleavage site showed that strains
isolated in 2009 have a different cleavage site compare to
those previously reported. From 1997 to 2008, all H9N2
viruses retained a conserved amino acid pattern at the
cleavage site; 335RSSR338GLF341 except for the sublineage
prototype strain (A/chicken/Kr/38349-p96323/96) that
had the cleavage site 335ASYR338GLF341. Presence of the
R-S-S-R motif is suggestive of H9N2 viruses with low
pathogenicity that have adapted to chicken host [28-30].
However, it has been observed that viruses isolated in
2009 have the different pattern (335RSNR338GLF341) due
to the substitution mutation S 337 N (Table 2). To our

knowledge, this is the first report to show presence of the
R-S-N-R motif in avian H9N2 influenza viruses isolated
from human patients although the R-S-N-R motif had
been reported before in different studies on avian H9N2
viruses from around the globe [31-33]. The significance
of this mutation on viral stability or increased pathogenicity is not fully understood as yet and requires further
studies, as the cleavage site is considered an indicator of
pathogenicity [34,35]. Comparison with vaccines strains
also revealed variations at positions 198 and 234 in the
HA glycoprotein. The currently available vaccine virus to
the virus has an E and an L at positions 198 and 234,
respectively, whereas strains associated with human
infections reported in 2009 contain D and Q residues at
these respective positions.
Neuraminidase

The major factors known to influence the functional
activities of the NA glycoprotein are enzyme active sites,
the stalk length, HB site and potential glycosylation
sites. The HB site is located on the surface of the NA
molecule, away from the neuraminidase enzyme active
site [36]. Analysis of the HB site showed substitutions
similar to those detected in the Y280 lineage prototype
strain (A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97) and in H9N2
human isolates from Hong Kong in 1999. These mutations are typical of human pandemic H2N2 and H3N2
viruses [7,14]. The most prominent mutation is at position 402 from isoleucine to asparagine/serine and at
position 403 from arginine to tryptophan/serine. Strains
from 1999 - 2009 also showed mutations at position 367
from lysine to glutamic acid and at position 432 from
glutamine to lysine as described in Table 2. However,
the biological significance of any of these substitutions
in the HB site is not yet known.

The NA protein consists of a box-like head with an
enzymatic active site that is connected to a fibrous stalk
region of variable length. The NA stalk is important for
balancing the complementary activity of HA and NA
and has been correlated with efficiency of virus replication and pathogenesis. From various studies previously
performed it has been concluded that longer stalk length
of the virus results in better replication [37-40]. Analysis
of stalk length revealed that the two prototype viruses,
Qa/Hong Kong/G1/97 and A/Hong Kong/1073/97, of
the G1-lineage contained a two amino acid deletion in
the NA stalk region at positions 38 and 39, a deletion at
position 62 - 64 was observed in A/Duck/Hong Kong/
Y280/97, A/Shaoguan/408/98 and A/Shaoguan/447/98.
The particular 46-50 amino acid deletion, which is
important for poultry adaptation of the virus [41], is not
found in any of the analyzed sequences even though
these viruses are thought to be transmitted from avian
species to humans. Furthermore, as shown in Table 2,
from 1999 - 2009 none of the reported strains contained
a stalk deletion at any position, which may also be an
indication of evolution in the viral structure leading to a
NA protein with better replication rate in humans.
Sequence analysis of binding pocket residues in NA
for drugs such as zanamivir (Relenza®) and oseltamivir
(Tamiflu®) was also performed. These analyses showed
that for each virus, amino acids in the enzyme active
site were conserved and no substitution mutations were
seen, which may lead to an evolution of sialidase inhibitor resistant viruses (Table 2). It is known that mutations at positions other than the active sites still tend to
alter the activity of active site amino acids; therefore this
possibility cannot be excluded. Such mutations are not
always captured or extensively studied in homology
models. Therefore, wet lab studies are required to check
the level of effectiveness possessed by NA inhibitors
against recently reported strains.
Phylogenetic characterization

Evolutionary relationships of HA and NA nucleotide
sequences were determined by comparing H9N2 human
isolates from 1997 - 2009 with the established Eurasian
H9N2 lineages: namely, the G1, Y280 and Koreanlineages represented by their respective prototype
viruses (Table 1). The strains of current and proposed
vaccines were also included in this analysis.
Two distinct groups were observed in the unrooted
phylogenetic tree for HA (Figure 1). Viruses isolated
from Hong Kong in 1997, 1999, and in 2009 showed a
more intimate relationship with the G1 lineage strain
and clustered together in one group. Sequences from
Hong Kong isolated in 2003 and 2008, along with Chinese strains from 1998 and 1999 showed the close association with the Y280 lineage and clustered together in

Page 5 of 11

second group. None of the reported sequences clustered
within the Korean-like lineage.
The phylogenetic tree for NA (Figure 2) showed clustering pattern different from that observed in the HA
phylogenetic results. Similar to HA, none of the
sequences grouped within the Korean-like lineage. However, sequences isolated from Hong Kong in 2003, 2008
and 2009 clustered within G9-like lineage which is one
of the prototype strains from the Y280 lineage. It was
observed that the proposed vaccine strain and the 2009
strain from Hong Kong appear in the same sub group
with 100% similarity. Sequences isolated from Shaoguan,
China in 1998 clustered together with the Y280 lineage
strain in one subgroup, while another contained the G1
lineage strain along with available vaccine strain and
strains from Hong Kong isolated in 1997 and 1999.
Collectively, we observed that phylogenetic relationship of strains at different times and geographical
regions displayed complexity and diversity. It was identified that both HA and NA glycoproteins do not belong
to a single lineage but originate from different Eurasian
sublineages which relates to genetic heterogeneity of
H9N2 viruses. These results were also in consensus with
the sequence analysis results of strains exhibiting high
sequence similarity in the same lineages and sublineages.
N-Glycosylation sites of HA and NA

The N-linked glycosidic moieties have been found to play
a vital role in mediating viral infectivity, receptor binding
capacity and cell associated host immune responses, as
well as protecting critical viral protein epitopes from
immune attack [42,43]. Potential glycosylation sites with
the N-X-T/S motif (in which X may be any amino acid
except proline) were identified, which revealed the region
based similarities and yearly variations. For H9N2 HA
protein sequences, the N-glycosylation sites of viruses
isolated from Hong Kong in 1997 were similar to those
isolated in 1999 (current vaccine strain) from Hong
Kong. The strains isolated from China in 1998 exhibited
a different pattern of glycosylation sites in terms of position and sequence pattern. A similar case was observed
for another virus isolated from China (A/Guangzhou/
333/99) in 1999, which showed a totally different pattern
of glycosylation sites as shown in Table 3. It may be
because viruses from China fall into the Y280 lineage
while other cases are closest to the G1 sublineage as
shown in our phylogenetic analysis. Sequence analysis
results also showed that Chinese isolates contained mutations in the HA receptor binding site at positions 191N
and 198A, as compared to other viruses having 191 H
and 198E or 198 D (Table 2). Viruses from Hong Kong
isolated during 2003 contained altogether different Nglycosylation sites at different positions, which were not
found in the analysis of previous entries. Glycosylation

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationships of HA genes in H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from humans between 1997 and 2009.
A phylogenetic tree was generated using minimum evolution analysis with maximum composite likelihood using the Tamura-Nei model with
MEGA software version 4.0.2. Numbers below branches indicate bootstrap value percentages from 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents the
distance unit between sequence pairs. Representative prototype viruses for different Eurasian lineages are indicated as red. The sequences of
H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from the human population are indicated as blue.

sites of viral strains from 2008 and 2009 again had high
similarity with each other but were different from all the
previous strains except at one site with a single mutation
305 - 308 (NISK - NCSK) in 2008 strains, which was also
present in Hong Kong viruses from 1997 - 1999.

Similar to HA, NA sequences isolated from Hong Kong
in 1997 and 1999 showed similar glycosylation sites, as
did the sequences isolated from China in 1999 and from
Hong Kong in 2003. Sequences isolated from Hong Kong
in 2008 and 2009 also had similar glycosylation sites. An

phylogenetic methods and abbreviations were as described for figure 1.

interesting observation was that in some cases of HA and
NA, the glycosylation sites remained the same as those
seen in previous or later strains. However, there was a
change of position for these sites, such as 198 - 201
(NATA) in Hong Kong/1074/1997 and 183 - 186
(NATA) in Shantou/239/98 (Table 4).

Antigenic sites of HA and NA

Analysis of antigenic sites of HA and NA also showed
region based similarities and yearly variations as
observed for glycosylation sites distribution. Viruses
isolated from Hong Kong in 1997 and 1999 had the
same antigenic sites as strains isolated from China in

1998 and 1999, except for A/Shaoguan/447/98 which
had only one antigenic site (219 - GRIDYYWSV) similar to other Chinese strains. Strains isolated from
Hong Kong in 2003, 2008 and 2009 had similar antigens as the earlier strains from the region but at different positions compared to the strains from 2008 and
2009, but again presenting similar antigenic site positions (Table 5).
For NA, the sequences isolated from Hong Kong in
1997 and 1999 had the same antigenic sites. Sequences
from China isolated in 1998 had similar antigenic sites
but at different positions with variation at one site. Chinese sequences from 1999 had three sites that were the
same as those in the Hong Kong viruses isolated during
2003. Sequences isolated from Hong Kong in 2008 and
2009 also had similar antigenic sites as previous strains
from the region but at different positions. Furthermore,
in 2008, one new antigenic site was observed in a
sequence (102 - ASGDIWVTR) and another two in 2009
sequences at positions 19 (ALFATTMTL) and 240
(GRADTRILF) as shown in Table 6. Another observation
was that both the available and proposed vaccine strains
are not fully coordinated with the antigenic epitope
regions of the HA and NA genes. Therefore, in case of
reappearance of incompatible viral strains, vaccine products may become less effective.
The potential for differences in antigenic variations is
high, especially when compared across sublineages of
H9N2 viruses. Xu et al [44] demonstrated antigenic
diversity in H9N2 viruses using monoclonal antibodies,
which corresponded with phylogenetic relationships.
Findings of the study by Xu et al also correspond with
our results where H9N2 viruses showed sequence variations and antigenic diversity based on evolution.
Furthermore, differences in glycosylation of the virion
surface proteins may contribute to antigenic variations,
however this requires further evaluation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported an in silico molecular
analysis of HA and NA genes and respective deduced
amino acid sequences from H9N2 avian influenza
viruses that were isolated from humans between 1997
and 2009. We found that H9N2 surface genes belonged
to two distinct lineages - G1 and Y280, indicating that
they have different sources of origin. Sequence analysis
revealed unique variations in antigenic and N - linked
glycosylation sites. Drug binding pockets remained
highly conserved in all reported strains and hence, the
activity of NA inhibitors should remain unaffected.
However, matching with vaccine strains showed variations, requiring further investigations in animal models.
The RBS modification of leucine to glutamine (Leu226Glu) instead of glutamine to leucine and a new cleavage

site motif (R-S-N-R) for HA is related to the balancing
activity of NA. Findings from the study support the
genetic instability of influenza A (H9N2) viruses and
highlight the necessity for more comprehensive surveillance and further evaluation of H9N2 viruses with
proper in vitro and in vivo models.
