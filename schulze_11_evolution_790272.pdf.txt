Evolution of embryonic development in
nematodes
Jens Schulze and Einhard Schierenberg*

Abstract
Background: Nematodes can be subdivided into basal Enoplea (clades 1 and 2) and more derived Chromadorea
(clades 3 to 12). Embryogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans (clade 9) has been analyzed in most detail. Their
establishment of polarity and asymmetric cleavage requires the differential localization of PAR proteins. Earlier
studies on selected other nematodes revealed that embryonic development of nematodes is more diverse than
the essentially invariant development of C. elegans and the classic study object Ascaris had suggested. To obtain a
more detailed picture of variations and evolutionary trends we compared embryonic cell lineages and pattern
formation in embryos of all 12 nematode clades.
Methods: The study was conducted using 4-D microscopy and 3-D modeling of developing embryos.
Results: We found dramatic differences compared to C. elegans in Enoplea but also considerable variations among
Chromadorea. We discovered ‘Polarity Organizing Centers’ (POCs) that orient cleavage spindles along the anteriorposterior axis in distinct cells over consecutive cell generations. The resulting lineally arranged blastomeres
represent a starting point for the establishment of bilateral symmetry within individual lineages. We can discern six
different early cleavage types and suggest that these variations are due to modifications in the activity of the POCs
in conjunction with changes in the distribution of PAR proteins. In addition, our studies indicate that lineage
complexity advanced considerably during evolution, that is we observe trends towards an increase of somatic
founder cells, from monoclonal to polyclonal lineages and from a variable (position-dependent) to an invariable
(lineage-dependent) way of cell fate specification. In contrast to the early phase of embryogenesis, the second half
(’morphogenesis’) appears similar in all studied nematodes. Comparison of early cleavage between the basal
nematode Tobrilus stefanskii and the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini revealed surprising similarities indicating that the
presence of POCs is not restricted to nematode embryos.
Conclusions: The pattern of cleavage, spatial arrangement and differentiation of cells diverged dramatically during
the history of the phylum Nematoda without corresponding changes in the phenotype. While in all studied
representatives the same distinctive developmental steps need to be taken, cell behavior leading to these is not
conserved.

Background
Over many decades various suggestions have been made
concerning phylogenetic relationships among nematodes. With the availability of an increasing number of
gene sequences the phylogeny of this phylum was put
on a more objective basis and resulted in major revisions of previous classifications [1-4]. In this work we

refer to the phylogeny of Holterman et al. [5], dividing
the phylum Nematoda into 12 different clades (Figure
1a). We followed the proposal of De Ley and Blaxter [2]
based on molecular and morphological criteria and subdivide nematodes into the two classes Enoplea (clades 1
and 2) and Chromadorea (clades 3 to 12). The former
consists of two subclasses Enoplia (clade 1) and Dorylaimia (clade 2). Molecular and morphological data indicate that clade 1 comprises representatives closest to the

germline cell P3 (red) generated with the next division are shown. c. Alignment of early blastomeres (colored circles) along the a-p axis. Colored
columns indicate fate assignments (’AB’ = AB-like and so on, for definition, see materials and methods). From clade 2C onward all early
blastomeres can be assigned one of the six basic fates, however the position in the sequence of cells varies between species. Striated area
indicates that in Prionchulus S3-S5 form largely bilaterally symmetric clones (for further description, see text). In some Chromadorea the initial
order of founder cells is different to that in C. elegans due to the absence of PR in the germline. After cellular rearrangements (’cell sorting’) they
all merge into a single, standard pattern prior to the onset of gastrulation. PR, polarity reversal in the germline.

common ancestor of nematodes while Chromadorea
include phylogenetically more derived species [2,5,6].
Our current picture of embryonic development in
nematodes is essentially shaped by the striking similarity
between the classic model system Ascaris megalocephala
(Clade 8; Figure 1a; [7,8]) and Caenorhabditis elegans
(clade 9; [9]; http://www.wormbook.org). Work on C.
elegans and its closer relatives has provided an initial
insight into the recent evolution of embryonic and postembryonic development in clades 8 to 10 and discloses
wide homologies in features, phenotypes and cell
lineages [4,10-19]. Nevertheless, our understanding of
the evolution of embryogenesis in the nematode phylum
is still fragmentary. Species studied so far were usually
chosen because of easy accessibility and amenable
breeding conditions, and therefore represent a biased
minority of the taxon. But generalizations from developmental characters of model organisms have to be taken
with caution, because these organisms are often highly
derived [20].
Embryonic studies revealed distinct developmental
characters of nematode species and higher taxa that can
be related to their phylogenetic position [14,21-26]. But
not only inter-species but also intra-species variations
have been uncovered, for example plasticity in pattern
formation in Acrobeloides nanus [21] and Diploscapter
coronatus [27] or postembryonic mouth dimorphism in
Pristionchus pacificus (clade 9; [28,29]). A high regulative potential was demonstrated by the hierarchy of
somatic cell fate transformations after cell ablation in
the early embryo of A. nanus (clade 11; [30]). Even
more dramatic peculiarities are found in Enoplea.
Asymmetric cleavages and distinct cell lineages are initially missing in clade 1B (Enoplus brevis, Pontonema vulgaris) and only a gut lineage is present [22,31].
Development of Tobrilus diversipapillatus (clade 1C) is
characterized by a prominent coeloblastula [32], a developmental character thought to be absent in nematodes.
Compared to C. elegans, Romanomermis culicivorax
(clade 2C) displays major differences in the establishment of embryonic polarity, pattern formation, programming of somatic founders and cell lineage
complexity [33,34]. Hence, embryonic development of
nematodes is much more diverse than the essentially
invariant development of C. elegans and its closer relatives indicates.
Although in the Enoplea, development is usually much
slower than in C. elegans, and their embryos are less
transparent, we performed an extended analysis of
development in selected species of this poorly studied
basal group. Additionally we studied development in
more detail in those clades of Chromadorea where only
limited embryonic data have been available so far (Figure 1a). With these results, we now can address to what

extent (i) nematodes follow a common general developmental program to generate the body plan typical for
this phylum and (ii) developmental differences can be
related to phylogenetic position (that is whether specific
points can be defined where during evolution certain
characters first appeared). The question which type of
early cleavage was followed by the last common ancestor of nematodes has been controversially discussed in
the past [35,36]. Therefore, we explored the notion that
a nematode species with invariant polyclonal lineages
generated by a fixed set of founder cells, such as C. elegans may have evolved from an ancestor such as Enoplus with just a single monoclonal lineage and a
predominantly variable early embryogenesis.

Cell nomenclature and cell fate assignments

Projection of the C. elegans standard cell nomenclature
[9,37] onto other nematodes implies the presence of
similar cell differentiation patterns, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, we apply neutral lineage names
(S1-S4/S5, somatic founder cells; P1-P4/P5, germline).
We use the standard nomenclature (AB, MS, C, D) to
indicate cell fates that correspond to those in C. elegans
as described in [34]. In this species but not necessarily
in other nematodes S1 = AB, S2 = EMS, S3 = C, S4 =
D.
Although we traced cell divisions only up to a few
hundred cells, we could assert the degree of variation
from the pattern found in C. elegans (fixed lineages with
unambiguous fate assignments). As we did not observe
prominent rearrangements of cell clones after gastrulation we were able to assign fate categories (’AB’-like, ‘S’like, and so on; Figure 1c) to each of the founder cells
based on position, structure and behavior of their descendants [34]. These cell fate categories imply similarities to C. elegans in terms of cell types derived from this
lineage (for example ‘AB’, generates at least the majority
of neurons; ‘S’ contributes to the pharynx) but may differ in detail. ‘E’ stands exclusively for gut fate in all studied species.
Microscopy

With the exception of Enoplus (see below) 1-cell and 2cell stage embryos collected from culture plates or cut
out of gravid adults were mounted on slides carrying a
thin 3% agarose layer as a mechanical cushion. The
cover slip was sealed with melted petroleum jelly.
Embryonic development was studied with DIC optics
using a 100 × objective. Stacks of optical sections were
digitally recorded at 30 to 60 second intervals and at 23°
C with a 4-D microscope (Zeiss, Axioscope 2 mot). 3-D
tracing of cell behavior and generation of cell lineages
were software-supported (Simi Biocell; Unterschleißheim, Germany) essentially as described in [34].
Due to a sticky surface Enoplus 1-cell stages adhered
reliably to an untreated microscope slide. This was
immersed into a petri dish filled with brackish water
(ratio sea water to tap water, 2:1) and then covered with
aluminum foil. Development was recorded on time lapse
video tape with a 20 × water immersion objective. Evaporated water was replaced daily. If not stated otherwise
the development of at least three embryos per species
has been analyzed.

Results
Embryogenesis of Enoplus brevis

We confirmed, with photo documentation, the observations of Russian researchers (see introduction). First
cleavages are equal (Figure 2a1-a2) and lead to variable

Page 4 of 16

spatial arrangements. In the 8-cell stage one blastomere
divides after a delay (Figure 2a3, black asterisk). This
cell is the founder of the gut lineage. During gastrulation its two daughter cells are translocated into the
interior of the embryo (Figure 2a4-a5) as in C. elegans.
Embryogenesis of Tobrilus stefanskii

While in the early E. brevis embryo, only a single fixed
cell lineage exists [31], in Romanomermis culicivorax
already six fixed lineages are present as in C. elegans
even though with different fate assignments [34].
Searching for species occupying intermediate evolutionary steps between these two extremes, we analyzed early
embryogenesis of the basal nematode Tobrilus stefanskii
(n = 11; clade 1C). With its early symmetric cleavages,
the absence of visible cell lineages and its prominent
coeloblastula, first described for another member of the
genus [32], embryogenesis differs strikingly from C. elegans (clade 9A; [9]) and R. culicivorax (clade 2C;
[33,34]).
T. stefanskii is a gonochoristic species with oviposition
at the 1-cell stage preceding pronuclear fusion (Figure
2b1). The first division generates cells of equal size (Figure 2b2). Both spindles in the 2-cell stage orient at right
angles to the first division, following the ‘centriolic principle’ (that is during consecutive cleavages spindles form
at right angles to each other due to changing positions
of centrioles; [38,39]). We named this early cleavage pattern ‘H-Type’ (Figure 1b). The first two cell division
rounds produce descendants of equal size (Figure 2b2b3). In the 4-cell stage various spatial arrangements are
found [22,32]. Then the first asymmetric cleavages are
observed. Based on these and subsequent asymmetries,
and on specific cell behavior and lineage analysis
described below, cells could be assigned lineage names
in retrospect (for cell nomenclature, see materials and
methods). One blastomere of the 4-cell stage shows the
stem cell behavior and additional features typical for a
germline cell in other nematodes (for example permanent contact with gut precursors; see below). Hence, we
named it P2 and its sister S2. The remaining two cells
are then daughters of S1. For better comparison with
other species we named them S1a and S1p, although
position relative to each other is variable. The nuclei in
the cell cousins S1p and P2 leave their central position
and become located side by side at the cell membrane
(not shown). This is as found in R. culicivorax where,
however, cell asymmetry starts to form already in the 2cell stage (Figure 2c1; [33]). With the onset of division,
the forming mitotic spindles in S1p and P2 become
oriented and asymmetrically displaced toward a common point (green square, Figure 2b3). The orientation
of these two spindles corresponds to the anterior-posterior (a-p) axis of the embryo. The resulting P3 is

much smaller than its sibling S3, while size differences
between S1pa and S1pp are less prominent (Figure 2b4).
The events described above are repeated when the
cousins S1pp and P3 (Figure 2b4 to b6) and S1ppp and
P4 (Figure 2b7 to b9) cleave asymmetrically (marked in
Figure 3m). Spindles in S1pppp and P5 are oriented

along the a-p axis as well but the divisions of these cells
are not obviously asymmetric. The soma/germline cell
pairs named above remain firmly attached to each other
and their mitotic spindle microtubules appear to find
distinct anchorage sites in the area of cell attachment
(Figure 2b3 to b10) leading to a linear orientation of

Schulze and Schierenberg EvoDevo 2011, 2:18

spindles. Consequently an array of cells forms along the
future midline as a prerequisite for the establishment of
bilateral symmetry (see paragraph below). This strongly
resembles cell behavior in the early embryo of R. culicivorax (Figure 2c1 to c5; [33]) induced by the ‘Region of
First Midbody’ (RFM). As we do not know whether the
underlying mechanism is the same in both species we
named it more generally ‘Polarity Organizing Center’
(POC). To distinguish it from other centers found in the
higher-numbered clades (see below) we call it ‘primary
POC’ (marked in green in Figures 2 to 5).
After having identified a germline, we traced the fate of
the remaining cells. In the 8-cell stage S1pp and P3 are
neighbors with nuclei asymmetrically positioned adjacent
to the primary POC (Figure 3a), and both divide with
delay (Figure 3m). S1pp turns out to give rise to the alimentary tract (that is gut+pharynx; Figure 3a to 3f). This
is different from R. culicivorax [34] and Enoplus [31,40],
where the founder cell for the alimentary tract is already
present one cell generation earlier (Figure 1c). In Chromadorea the differences are more dramatic as there the
gut is generated by S2p (Figure 1c and below; [7,9,21,22]).
As in other nematodes [21,41] the germline in T. stefanskii remains in permanent contact with the gut founder and its descendants. In contrast to C. elegans, in T.
stefanskii P4 performs another asymmetric division
resulting in S5 and P5 (Figure 2b10). The latter behaves
like P4 in C. elegans, in that it divides symmetrically. Its
daughters follow the gut precursors into the center of
the embryo (Figure 3p, t).
Typical for all three of the Tobrilus species we looked
at, is the formation of a prominent coeloblastula (Figure
3b). They undergo a ‘canonical’ gastrulation, with the
invagination of a layer of alimentary tract precursor cells
(Figure 3c, g to j, n to 3u; [32]). The blastocoel starts to
form as early as the 4-cell stage and grows to its full
size before the 100-cell stage. Gastrulation starts with
the invagination of the eight S1pp descendants (Figure
3g, o, s). Other cell groups join them but their lineage
origin varies among the analyzed embryos. As divisions
continue, the immigrated cells fill the blastocoel (Figure
3c, g to 3i), leaving an oval-shaped blastopore furrow on
the ventral side (Figure 3d) that reaches deep into the
alimentary tract primordium (Figure 3k). Eventually it
closes from the center in both directions along the a-p
axis like a zipper, resulting in future mouth and anus at
its ends (not shown) similar to R.culicivorax and other
basal nematodes [22,34]. After immigration of future alimentary tract cells (leaving only small remnants of the
blastocoel), body muscle precursors of various lineage
origin move between these and the outer layer of cells
(Figure 3f, j to 3l).
Lineage analysis and 3-D reconstructions (n = 9)
revealed that in contrast to members of clade 1B in

Page 7 of 16

the early T. stefanskii embryo, three distinct cell
lineages can be defined (Figure 1c), for gut (’E’), pharynx (’S’; additional cells contribute variably to this
organ) and germline (’P’). For the remainder no fixed
correlation between lineage and fate exists, that is the
spatial arrangement of these blastomeres and their
contributions to tissues is variable. This is exemplified
in the two embryos shown in Figure 3. In embryo #1
(Figure 3p) descendants of S1pa (orange; left side) and
S2 (brown; right side) form separate clones. Cells of
both origins migrate in (Figure 3q) to contribute to the
mesoderm. In embryo #2 (Figure 3t) S1pa descendants
are located on both sides and at this stage cells
between the inner and outer cell layer are all members
of this lineage branch (Figure 3u). Among the other
specimens of T. stefanskii we found various combinations of S1a, S1p and S2 lineages contributing to body
muscle cells.
Embryogenesis of Prionchulus sp

To narrow this gap between Tobrilus with three and
Romanomermis with six lineages we studied a second
representative of clade 2B, Prionchulus sp. (Mononchida,
n = 4). In earlier studies contradictory conclusions had
been drawn concerning the existence of early asymmetric cleavages and distinct cell lineages in this genus
[42,43].
We found several basic similarities to R. culicivorax
(Figure 2c1 to c5; [33,34]) in that the first division in
Prionchulus is symmetric, nuclei of the 2-cell stage
occupy adjacent positions (Figures 2d1, 4b), and both
spindles become oriented along the a-p axis (Figure 4c
to 4d). The latter indicates the action of a primary POC
already in the 2-cell stage. We call this the ‘I-Type’ of
cleavage. As it differs from similar I-Type cleavage patterns seen in higher-numbered clades (see below) we
named it ‘I 1 -Type (Figure 1b). In Prionchulus, S1p is
definitely larger than S1a while size differences between
S2 and P2 are less prominent (Figures 2d2, 4e). A similar pattern can be identified in (Longidorus elongatus
Figure 1a; [44])
Restricted by the limited space in the eggshell, 4-cell
stage blastomeres arrange themselves in two alternative
rhomboid variants, whereby either S2 or P2 occupy a
position adjacent to S1a (Figure 2d2, n = 2; Figure 4f, n
= 2). In both of these S1p and P2 touch each other and
form lineally oriented spindles (Figure 4f) resulting in
daughter blastomeres arranged in tandem (Figure 2d3).
The same process is repeated with the division of the
cell pairs S1pp-P3 (Figures 2d3 to d4, g to 4h) and
S1ppp-P4 (Figures 2d4 to d5, 4h to 4i). The fact that
members of each pair do not move relative to each
other underlines the continuous presence of a centrally
located POC.

Gastrulation starts with the immigration of S1pppa
+S1pppp in the absence of a coeloblastula (Figures 2d5,

contribute to the pharynx. Thus, they show some
resemblance to the behavior of MS (S2a) in C. elegans.

However, as we could not find any contribution to body
muscles we marked their fate with ‘S’ in Figure 1c. The
same applies to Tobrilus (see above) and Romanomermis
[34]. Contacts remain between P5, still positioned on
the surface, and S1pppp and its posterior daughter

S1ppppp (Figure 4i to 4k). Prionchulus shows high similarities to Tobrilus with respect to blastopore formation
(Figure 5l) and the behavior of S1a, S1pa and S2 descendants. A further similarity, revealed by 3-D reconstructions of two embryos (Figure 4n to u) is the
considerable positional variability of blastomeres.
As in Tobrilus we could only identify lineages for the
alimentary tract (’S’ + ‘E’) and the germline (’P’). However, here additional cells (S3-S5) occupy essentially
invariant positions. They participate in the formation of
bilaterally symmetric structures (Figures 1c, 4 p, q, t, u;
see below) and appear to contribute to body muscles
and hypodermis roughly corresponding to the C and D
lineages in C. elegans. Due to limited transparency we
could not ascertain whether S3-S5 make fixed contributions to the developing embryo. In any case these differ
from the pattern found in Romanomermis and in C.
elegans.
Embryogenesis in Prionchulus is much slower than
that in Tobrilus. Initially, in both species cell cycles of
all blastomeres are close to synchronous. Later, descendants of P3 and S1pp divide more slowly than other
blastomeres. This is more obvious in Tobrilus than in
Prionchulus (Figures 3m and 4m).
Our finding that cell lineages exist in the early
Prionchulus embryo accords with the report of

Drozdovskiy [42], however, we did not find the Ascarislike invariant cleavage pattern with strict early bilateral
symmetry and invariant cell positioning as shown in his
sketches.

T1-type, Clades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9A, 10, 12A (Figure 1b, blue
lineage branches)

In the standard C. elegans (clade 9A; Figure 2g1 to g5),
the first division is unequal, generating a larger S1 and a
smaller P1 cell. While AB divides with transverse spindle orientation (following the centriolic principle; see
above) P1 reorients its spindle to divide into a larger
anterior S2 and a smaller posterior P2 (Figure 2g1 to
g2). We named this early cleavage pattern ‘T-typ’. In P2
a reversal of cleavage polarity (PR) takes place [41]. To
distinguish this cleavage pattern we call it ‘T1-type’.
In Achromadora (clade 3; Figure 2e1 to e5), the first
division is more or less equal in size (Figure 2e1) otherwise early cell behavior is similar to C. elegans. Our limited observations in representatives of clades 4 and 5
(Desmodorida and Monhysterida) correspond well with
descriptions by Malakhov [22] and make clear that, like
C. elegans, early cleavages follow the T1 -type pattern
(data not shown). The same is true for species of clade

6 (Plectus; Figure 2f1 to f5 and Tylocephalus; [26]), clade
7 (Teratocephalus; [26]), clade 8 (Ascaris; [7]), clade 10
(Panagrolaimus; Figure 2i1 to i5) and clade 12A (Aphelenchus; Figure 2k1-k5). A slight variation of the T1-type
cleavage pattern (green lineage branches) was detected
in two representatives of the genus Rhabditis, where PR
was found in either P2 or P3 [45].
I2-type, Clade 9B (Figure 1b, red lineage branches)

More prominent is a modification found in clade 9B
with the genera Protorhabditis (Figure 2h1 to h5) and
Diploscapter [27]. There, both first blastomeres divide
with a-p oriented spindles resulting in a tandem
arrangement of blastomeres [14] resembling the I1-type
cleavage pattern found in Romanomermis and Prionchulus (Figures 2c1 to c5; d1 to d5). The elongate eggshell
allows a strictly linear order of blastomeres after the
divisions of S1, P1 and P2 (Figure 2h2, h3). The germline cells, due to the absence of PR, end up occupying
positions posterior to their somatic sisters. To establish
the d-v axis and to reach the typical neighborhood
between the primordial germ cell P4 and the gut precursor S2p, prominent rearrangements (’cell sorting’; Figure
1c) are required (Figure 2h3 to h5) as described for D.
coronatus [27].
T2-type, Clade 11 (Figure 1, purple lineage branches)

Acrobeloides nanus [21] and Zeldia punctata (Figure 2
j1-j5) follow the T-type of cleavage; however, in contrast
to the T1-type PR is absent and therefore germline cells
occupy the most posterior positions. Consequently, cell
rearrangements among P2 descendants are required to
reach a C. elegans-like pattern prior to the onset of gastrulation as described above for the ‘I2-type’.
I3-type, Clade 12 (Figure 1, pink lineage branches)

Belonolaimus longicaudatus (Figure 2 l1 to l5) and
Meloidogyne incognita [14] follow the I-Type of cleavage. However, this differs from the two ‘I-types’ introduced above (PR in P1 or absent) in that PR takes place
in P2.
In summary, in nematodes we found six different early
cleavage patterns, two among Enoplea and four among
Chromadorea. In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1a) I2-,
T2- and I3-types are restricted to distinct branches indicating they are apomorphic modifications of the prevalent T1-type.
The POC, a general developmental principle in
nematodes?

Having detected the action of a POC in three representatives of Enoplea we wanted to determine whether such
a mechanism is also characteristic for early embryogenesis of Chromadorea and thus may constitute a general
developmental principle in nematodes.
In contrast to Tobrilus, Prionchulus and Romanomermis, three POCs can be defined in C. elegans which are

Page 10 of 16

involved in longitudinal spindle orientation and serial
arrangement of founder cells. Laser ablation experiments in 2-cell embryos revealed a microtubule-pulling
force at the anterior pole of P1 [46]. Located in the
RFM, it resembles the ‘primary POC’ described above,
although normally it only acts in P1 (Figure 2g1; green
arrowhead). However, in embryos with defects in the
expression of par genes, spindle orientations in P1 and
S1 are altered (Figure 2p, q), suggesting an interaction
between PAR proteins and the primary POC (see discussion). Another POC (’secondary POC’; marked in
purple in Figure 2) positioned in the ‘region of the second midbody’ (RSM), initially orients spindles in the
two sister cells S2 and P2 and subsequently in the cell
cousins S2p+P3 and S2pp+P4 (Figure 2g2 to g5). This
differs from the situation in Enoplea described above
where S1, not S2, descendants are involved. For C. elegans it has been shown that the polarizing function of
the secondary POC depends on the presence of MES-1/
SRC-1 proteins (see discussion). A third POC (’tertiary
POC’; marked in yellow in Figure 2) is established at the
posterior pole of the 1-cell stage as a consequence of
sperm entry [47]. It polarizes the fertilized egg, is crucial
for asymmetric divisions of germline cells and depends
on the polar distribution of PAR proteins (Figure 5c; see
discussion).
As the majority of Chromadorea studied follow the
T1-type of cleavage (Figure 1a; blue branches; Figure 2e
to 2g, i, k) and early cell behavior is very similar to C.
elegans, it indicates the activity of all three POC types.
The other cleavage types (Figure 1b) can be explained
with an altered expression pattern of PAR proteins
affecting the function of the primary POC and the presence or absence of a PR in the germline (Figures 2, 5
and discussion).
POC-based establishment of polarity beyond nematodes?

Our studies on early embryogenesis in nematodes
revealed a characteristic cleavage pattern where, through
several cell generations, two blastomeres orient their
spindles towards a POC resulting in a series of asymmetric cleavages (Figure 2). We wondered whether this
pattern is unique for nematodes and therefore compared
it to early development of the tardigrade Hybsibius
dujardini studied by Gabriel et al. [48]. According to
the Ecdysozoa hypothesis [49] tardigrades are a sister
group of nematodes. We found that early development
of Hybsibius shows unexpected similarities to Tobrilus
(Figure 2b). The first two divisions are equal with subsequent spindles perpendicular to each other (Figure 2r1
to r3), typical for the ‘H-Type’ of cleavage (Figure 1b).
Then, tandem orientation of spindles in two neighboring
cell cousins and subsequent asymmetric divisions indicate the presence of a POC (Figure 2r3, r4). As in

Schulze and Schierenberg EvoDevo 2011, 2:18
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/18

Tobrilus, two adjacent cell cousins perform asymmetric,
longitudinally oriented cleavages (Figure 2r5). Thus, a
distinct POC-controlled division pattern is obviously
shared between nematodes of clade 1C and at least one
representative of tardigrades. In a species belonging to a
different branch of tardigrades the H-type of early cleavage was observed, too, but not the reproducible
unequal divisions [50].
Establishment of bilateral symmetry

We found that despite considerable differences with
respect to early development (for example H-, I-, Tcleavage types; PR in P1, P2, P3 or absent; Figures 1b, 2,
3m, 4m, 5), in all studied embryos with the exception of
Enoplus (clade 1B; Figure 2a), a linear sequence of cells
with different fates is generated along the a-p body axis
due to the action of one or more POCs. Some or all of
these divide into left and right descendants with equivalent fates on both sides of the midline. This way bilateral symmetry is established within individual cell
lineages. To determine to what extent nematodes with
different cleavage patterns vary in the way they develop
bilateral symmetry, we compared early pattern formation in all 12 clades (Figure 1). Three representative species for the H-, I-, and T-types are shown in Figure 5.
In T. stefanskii (Figure 5a) a visible polarity is established in the 4cell stage (see above) and descendants of
S1p and P2-P5 are aligned along the future midline.
However, only three somatic cells (S1pppa, S1ppppa,
S1ppppp) perform left-right oriented cleavages resulting
in bilateral symmetric clones. Adhering to the centriolic
principle (see above) the remaining blastomeres divide
with variable spindle orientations giving rise to clones
with indeterminate spatial positions.
In Prionchulus sp. (Figure 5b) in addition to three descendants of S1p also S4 and S5 execute divisions with
transverse spindle orientation and subsequently generate
bilaterally symmetric clones. S3 divides with oblique
spindle orientation forming an imperfect early l-r symmetry (Figure 4p to 4u). The other cells show variable
arrangements.
Thus, in Tobrilus and Prionchulus part of bilateral
body symmetry must be established later, probably in a
position-dependent manner as a result of cell-cell
interactions.
In contrast, in C. elegans (Figure 5c) and all other studied members of clades 2C-12 all somatic founder cells
or their early descendants form bilaterally symmetric
clones (for modification of this principle in S1a cells, see
[9]), independent of whether they follow the T1-(Figure
5c), T2-, I2- (Figure 5d) or I3-type of cleavage.
Comparing the three examples shown in Figure 5 a
tendency can be observed towards an earlier and complete fixation of bilateral symmetry. The start of

Page 11 of 16

asymmetric divisions shifts from the 4-cell stage (Tobrilus) to the 1-cell stage (C. elegans) while the number of
cell generations needed to perform all the l-r divisions
described above decreases from seven (Tobrilus) to five
(C. elegans) and the number of somatic lineages
involved in early symmetry formation (Figure 1c)
increases from two (Tobrilus) to five (C. elegans).
Differences and similarities during ongoing
embryogenesis

Our study makes clear that early embryogenesis differs
dramatically among species, particularly within Enoplea.
In addition, tissue formation varies during later stages.
In a previous publication we showed that hypodermis is
generated in Romanomermis very differently from that
in C. elegans [34]. Preliminary data indicate that hypodermis formation in Prionchulus does not follow the
pattern found in Romanomermis, in spite of both being
members of the same clade. The peculiarities of gastrulation in Tobrilus (Figure 3) including the way cells
assemble to form the gut are not only different compared to C. elegans but also to Enoplus (see above). We
also found indications that founder cells contribute differently to the pharynx [9,34] and how this organ is
formed (data not shown). However, eventually all variants seem to merge into a common pattern. The process of transforming a ball of cells consisting of three
germ layers into an elongated worm during the “morphogenesis phase” starts with a ventral indentation
separating head and tail regions in all studied nematodes. The progressive elongation of the embryo looks
similar to C. elegans [51], although the degree of elongation varies considerably (that is juveniles may be longer
and thinner). From this we conclude that the developmental constraints during the second half of embryogenesis are higher than during the early phase.

Discussion
In this paper representatives of all 12 nematode clades
(according to the phylogeny by [5]) have been compared
with respect to their early embryogenesis. Our data
document that the very similar and reproducible development found in the reference systems Ascaris and C.
elegans (see introduction) exemplifies only one of many
ways to generate a nematode worm from a 1-cell
embryo. They indicate that the cleavage and differentiation program of blastomeres diverged dramatically during evolution. This is particularly obvious in Enoplia
(clade 1) and Dorylaimia (clade 2). In each of these taxa
developmental peculiarities and variations appear to be
higher than in all Chromadorea (clades 3 to 12) combined. Because of distinct developmental features (Figures 1b, 2 to 5) it appears reasonable to break down
clades 1, 2, 9 and 12 into subgroups (Figure 1a).

Schulze and Schierenberg EvoDevo 2011, 2:18

We believe that major developmental characters found
in Enoplea but absent in Chromadorea (clades 3 to 12;
Figures 1, 2) are plesiomorphic. These include the ‘canonical’ gastrulation in the genus Tobrilus with its large
blastocoel (Figure 3; [32]) found in many other animal
phyla including Nematomorpha (our unpublished
results), the nearest phylogenetic neighbors of nematodes, and the similarity of early cleavage patterns
between Tobrilus (Figure 2b) and the tardigrade Hybsibius (Figure 2r) which according to the Ecdysozoa
hypothesis [49] belongs to a neighboring phylum. Thus,
our findings support the positioning of Enoplea close to
the base of the phylogenetic tree of nematodes postulated on grounds of molecular sequence data [2,5,6].
This implies that the route of lineage evolution went
from an S1 to an S2 origin of the gut (Figure 1c;
[22,40]), which required considerable modifications in
cleavage pattern and fate assignment [34]. Furthermore,
comparison of embryogenesis between nematodes,
nematomorphs and tardigrades suggests that certain features (for example the absence of initial asymmetric
cleavages) were shared by their last common ancestor.
Variations, evolutionary trends and developmental
system drift

Our data including those on Romanomermis (clade 2C)
indicate a boost in lineage complexity, that is a stepwise
increase from a single to five somatic lineages (Figures
1c, 5) and a change from a monoclonal to a polyclonal
fate assignment [34]. This change, which appears to
have coincided with the transition from Enoplea to
Chromadorea (Figure 1), is correlated with an increase
in early fate decisions, which in turn reduces the
amount of cell migration necessary for proper tissue formation [12,34,52].
Comparing embryogenesis of representatives along the
nematode phylogenetic tree (Figure 1a) we find that
intra-species variation of early cell patterns decreases
due to an increase of founder cells that generate descendants occupying fixed positions. Hence, our data are in
favor of the conception that invariant development following distinct lineage programs is a derived and not an
original feature (see introduction).
From the degree of individual variation within a species we can deduce how strongly fixed the developmental program must be and thus how a change in cleavage
type (Figure 1b) may have been established during evolution. In Plectus (clade 6) we observed rare cases (2/<
100 embryos) where S1 cleaved with longitudinal (Figure
2o) rather than transverse spindle orientation (Figure
2f2), meaning a switch from a T 1 - to an I 2 -cleavage
type. As this deviation was found to be compatible with
normal embryogenesis it demonstrates that the developmental program must possess a sufficient degree of

Page 12 of 16

plasticity to allow the disregard of the ‘centriolic principle’ (see results section). Such an embryo must potentially cope with altered segregation of cytoplasmic
components and changes in relative cell positions which
in turn may affect inductive signaling. In addition, our
observation suggests that the change from one to
another cleavage type started with a modification that
was initially rare in the population.
The divergence of developmental pathways without
corresponding changes in the emerging phenotype
(’developmental system drift’; [53]) seems to be a widely
spread phenomenon in the animal kingdom. The present study gives additional examples for this. Moreover,
it indicates that embryogenesis in nematodes includes
general distinctive steps that need to be taken. However,
cellular events leading to these are not conserved
among species suggesting that evolutionary constraints
have been low on cell behavior but high not only on
structure and function of the juvenile but also on intermediate embryonic stopovers. Two examples may suffice
to put our idea across. (i) The contact beween gut and
germline (a critical feature in many systems; [54]) can
be achieved via PR in either P1, P2 or P3 or alternatively
via ‘cell sorting’ in species where PR is absent. (ii) Cell
fate assignment can be reached in the absence of a fixed
early cleavage program or alternatively via monoclonal
or polyclonal cell lineages. Recent findings by Lin et al.
[19] show that a similar relationship can be found
between cells and molecules. In two closely related
nematode species behavior of early blastomeres with
alternative fates is identical while the underlying signaling network differs.
The enormous differences in genomes among even
closely related species [55] in contrast to the conserved
morphology indicate a particularly relaxed relationship
between genotype and phenotype in nematodes. This
discrepancy can be attributed to the special construction of nematodes including a single chamber hydroskeleton which allows adaptation to very diverse
habitats but leaves little room for modifications of the
body plan.
Polarity organizing centers (POCs) and embryonic pattern
formation

One of our central findings is the general presence of
one or more POCs in early nematode embryos. While
in the Enoplea Romanomermis [33], Tobrilus and
Prionchulus (Figures 2b to 2d; 5a to 5b) we found evidence that early embryogenesis involves just a single
(primary) POC, in Chromadorea up to three (primary,
secondary and tertiary) POCs appear to be active in
organizing orientation and asymmetry of divisions. Only
for C. elegans do we have information about the molecular basis of the secondary and tertiary POC.

Schulze and Schierenberg EvoDevo 2011, 2:18

Laser ablation experiments in C. elegans [46] revealed
a ‘cortical pulling site’ at the anterior pole of P1. Observations by Keating and White [56] support the view that
the midbody between AB and P1 specifies a region of
the cortex that directs rotational alignment of the centrosome-nucleus complex. This region of the first midbody (RFM; [33]) corresponds to our primary POC.
Most prominent is the activity of the tertiary POC at
the posterior pole. Sperm entry initiates asymmetric distribution of PAR and LET-99 proteins [47,57-60] and
subsequently anterior-posterior (a-p)-oriented spindles
and asymmetric divisions in the germline [61,62]. However, in a member of clade 11 (Figure 1A) axis polarity
was found to be independent of the sperm entry point
[63].
Mutants and RNAi phenotypes of pkc-3, par-2, par-3
and par-6 in C. elegans demonstrate that a knockout of
any of these genes changes the orientation of the cleavage spindle in the 2-cell stage and this way leads from
the T-type to H- or I-types of cleavage (Figure 2p, q),
even though followed by abnormal development [64-68].
To explain the different cleavage types in Chromadorea we propose that in contrast to Enoplea (where the
primary POC always induces a-p spindle orientation in
two adjacent cells; Figures 2b to d, 5a, b), the polarizing
function in Chromadorea is controlled by PAR proteins
[27]. This view is supported by mutations and RNAi
experiments in C. elegans leading to abnormal cleavage
patterns. The par-2/par-3 double mutant follows the Itype of cleavage, demonstrating that neither of these
genes is required for longitudinal orientation of cleavage
spindles [64]. According to our model the prevalent Ttype (Figure 1b) can be explained with the anterior PAR
complex suppressing the activity of the primary POC in
S1. At the same time it gives a simple explanation why
uniform distribution of anterior PAR proteins (after
knockout of par-2) results in transverse spindle orientation in S1 and P1 (H-type; Figure 2q) and uniform distribution of posterior PAR proteins (after knockout of
anterior par genes) leads to longitudinal spindle orientation in both cells (I-type; Figure 2p).
In C. elegans PAR proteins switch function after the 4cell stage has been reached and are involved in the
establishment of apical-basal polarity [69]. Instead the
MES-1/SRC-1 system is required to continue a-p polarization of blastomeres [70-72] and to induce the reversal
of cleavage polarity (PR) in P2 [41] as is the case in the
T1- and I3-cleavage types (Figures 1b, 2). The expression
domain of MES-1/SRC-1 corresponds to our secondary
POC. Berkowitz and Strome [72] suggested that species
without PR may have lost the MES-1/SRC-1 system
(accordingly a secondary POC is not indicated in Figure
2h, j). However, the question then remains how a-p divisions in the germline can be maintained in the I2- and

Page 13 of 16

T2-types. A straightforward explanation could be a prolonged activity of posterior PAR proteins. Indeed, in
Protorhabditis (clade 9B, Figure 2h) an extended posterior expression of PAR-1 in the germline was observed
by Brauchle et al. [18].
The peculiarities of early development in those Enoplea that we followed in some detail (Figure 2a to d)
gave no indications that par genes are involved in cell
polarization along the a-p axis as found in C. elegans.
Although it would appear that this function may have
been newly acquired in Chromadorea, our fragmentary
data from two other Enoplida indicate that the situation
is less clear. Trichuris muris (clade 2A) performs an
extremely asymmetric first division (Figure 2n; see also
[22]), and in Ironus (clade 1A) three consecutive longitudinally oriented cleavages result in a tandem of eight
cells (Figure 2m). Both patterns cannot be readily
explained with the activity of a primary POC alone. As
our preliminary analysis of the R. culicivorax (clade 2C)
genome indicates that par genes are present it remains
to be determined whether at least in some Enoplea they
may play a role in establishing the primary body axis.
Consecutive asymmetric divisions following a POClike principle are not restricted to invertebrates like
nematodes and tardigrades but have been described for
posterior blastomeres of the ascidian embryo as well
[73]. In equivalent cells in the left and right half of the
bilaterally symmetric embryo asymmetric positioning of
cleavage spindles is induced by centrosome attracting
bodies (CAB; [74,75]). The CAB contains proteins that
are homologous to the anterior PAR proteins in C. elegans [76]. It remains to be determined whether this
asymmetry generating mechanism can be traced back to
the last common ancestor or has been acquired independently in all three taxa.
Midline formation and bilateral symmetry

A bilaterally symmetric body is typical for all higher animals. For C. elegans it has been shown that this symmetry is generated early within individual lineages [9]. The
construction of a bilateral body plan requires the presence of a midline, separating left from right. Our studies revealed that in all analyzed nematodes, except
clade 1B, such a midline can be defined during early
embryogenesis.
In contrast to the models proposed by Meinhardt [77]
for planarians, insects and vertebrates, in nematodes
bilateral symmetry is generated in a surprisingly simple
way. Due to the actions of one or more POCs (described
above) which cause longitudinal spindle orientations and
cleavage asymmetries over consecutive rounds of division, an array of cells is formed along the a-p axis.
Depending on the species, part or all of these divide
into left and right daughters (Figure 5) from which

Schulze and Schierenberg EvoDevo 2011, 2:18
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/18

bilaterally symmetric clones arise. It appears likely that
such a strategy requires specific conditions, for example
a low number of blastomeres and their early specification on a single cell basis, features typical for
nematodes.
Cell lineage and cell specification

The case of C. elegans demonstrates that even in a system with essentially invariant development and complex
polyclonal lineages, inductive interactions are an integral
part of the developmental program which requires specific cell contacts during narrow time windows [78-81].
The different early cleavage patterns described above
(Figures 1b, 2) result in different cell neighborhoods.
Either changes in cell contacts did not pose a problem
during nematode evolution because interactions like
those in C. elegans did not exist yet, or the network of
interactions was adjusted simultaneously. Our data are
in accordance with a stepwise establishment of such
interactions going along with increasing invariance of
cell positions. Experimental interference like recombining blastomeres [70,82] in basal representatives could
give us a better idea to what extent the pattern and relevance of embryonic inductions changed during evolution. Analysis of cell-specification patterns and their
molecular underpinnings, particularly in Enoplea, should
help to discern between two alternative visions. (i)
Inductive interactions in early nematode embryos are
historic remnants. They reach back to times when fixed
lineages where mainly absent (for example Enoplus;
[31]) or only simple, monoclonal lineages existed (for
example Romanomermis; [34]) and were required for
diversification of cell fate. (ii) Alternatively, they are
more recent acquisitions made possible after fixed
lineages assured invariant cell neighborhoods.

Conclusions
Nematodes are suitable objects to study evolution of
development because species from all branches of the
phylogenetic tree can be analyzed, embryos develop
outside the mothers and most of them are transparent
enough to perform cellular analysis in vivo. Our findings that early embryogenesis varies considerably
among species indicates that constraints are high on
the preservation of crucial developmental steps but not
on cellular behavior leading to these. We argue that
the direction of evolution went from indeterminate
early cleavage without initial polarity to invariant
development with establishment of polarity before division of the zygote. The observed action of a primary
POC gives a clue how polarity in certain nematodes
and other related taxa like tardigrades can be established in a way that differs from C. elegans, that is
independent of the sperm entry point.
