Abstract
Background: Trypanosomes mostly control gene expression by post-transcriptional events such
as modulation of mRNA stability and translational efficiency. These mechanisms involve RNAbinding proteins (RBPs), which associate with transcripts to form messenger ribonucleoprotein
(mRNP) complexes.
Results: In this study, we report the identification of mRNA targets for Trypanosoma cruzi U-rich
RBP 1 (TcUBP1) and T. cruzi RBP 3 (TcRBP3), two phylogenetically conserved proteins among
Kinetoplastids. Co-immunoprecipitated RBP-associated RNAs were extracted from mRNP
complexes and binding of RBPs to several targets was confirmed by independent experimental
assays. Analysis of target transcript sequences allowed the identification of different signature RNA
motifs for each protein. Cis-elements for RBP binding have a stem-loop structure of 30–35 bases
and are more frequently represented in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. Insertion of
the correctly folded RNA elements to a non-specific mRNA rendered it into a target transcript,
whereas substitution of the RNA elements abolished RBP interaction. In addition, RBPs competed
for RNA-binding sites in accordance with the distribution of different and overlapping motifs in the
3'-UTRs of common mRNAs.
Conclusion: Functionally related transcripts were preferentially associated with a given RBP;
TcUBP1 targets were enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism, whereas
ribosomal protein-encoding transcripts were the largest group within TcRBP3 targets. Together,
these results suggest coordinated control of different mRNA subsets at the post-transcriptional
level by specific RBPs.

Background
Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite of the order Kinetoplastida, is the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin
America. This protist, like the African trypanosome
Trypanosoma brucei, has a complex life cycle and alternates
between insect vectors and mammalian hosts. Being a sin-

gle cell that suffers continuous environmental changes, T.
cruzi needs to quickly regulate the expression of many
genes to allow rapid adaptation (reviewed in references
[1] and [2]). Such microorganisms control protein synthesis mostly by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Transcription in trypanosomes is polycistronic [3] and, in contrast

to what occurs in bacterial operons, polycistronic units
must be co-transcriptionally processed before translation
[4], by coupled 5'-trans-splicing and 3'-polyadenylation
events [5-7]. However, with a single exception [8], no classical promoters have been identified in trypanosomes,
and thus there is no evidence for controlled transcriptional initiation of genes through modulation of RNA
polymerase II activity [9]. Given these peculiarities,
trypanosomes represent an interesting model for studies
on mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression [3,10], in which mRNA degradation/stabilization is the main control feature. Active deadenylation systems have been found in trypanosome cells [11,12]. After
removal of the poly(A) tail and the 5'-cap, the mRNA can
be degraded from both ends by XRN1-related exoribonucleases (5'-3' direction) and the exosome (3'-5' direction)
(reviewed in reference [13]; see also references [14] and
[15]). RNA interference is also involved in gene-silencing
phenomena in some species of the Trypanosomatidae
family [16,17].
Mature transcripts contain regulatory motifs located in the
5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) that modulate
transcript abundance by specific interaction with RNAbinding proteins (RBPs). These cis-elements are involved
in the control of mRNA transport, stability, and translation efficiency [18,19]. Several RBPs form, together with
mRNAs, a network of messenger-ribonucleoprotein
(mRNP) complexes directing post-transcriptional regulation in response to diverse stimuli [20]. An important
class of these factors contains an RNA-binding domain
called RNA-recognition motif (RRM) [21].
The genome sequencing projects of three trypanosomatids (T. cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania major) was completed in 2005 [22-24], providing crucial data for study of
gene content and genome organization. Specifically, a
superfamily of more than 100 RRM-type proteins was discovered in the T. cruzi genome [25]. Some are involved in
alternative splicing processes, mRNA stabilization/degradation, polyadenylation, or translational control. However, the majority do not have clear homologs in other
species, even though they are highly conserved in Kinetoplastids. Among them, a family containing about 20
members, shares a common RRM sequence but contain
different auxiliary domains [26]. One member of this protein family is T. cruzi U-rich RBP 1 (TcUBP1) [27], a single
RRM domain cytoplasmic RBP with a characteristic
βαββαβ-fold flanked by N-terminal Gln-rich and C-terminal Gly-Gln-rich extensions that are likely involved in protein-protein interactions [28]. This protein shares almost
the same RRM sequence (99% identity) with a second
RBP family member termed TcUBP2. Previous work from
our laboratory has shown that both proteins can form a
complex with poly(A)-binding protein PABP1 at the 3'-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/107

UTR of mucin transcripts, producing selective destabilization of such mRNAs [27]. T. cruzi RBP 3 (TcRBP3) is a
third RBP family member that shares less than 60% identity with the RRM domain of TcUBP1 [26]; this is reflected
in different in vitro binding characteristics (see below). T.
brucei has homologous RBPs, two of these, termed
TbUBP1 and TbUBP2, are involved in stabilization of cyclin F box mRNA and a transmembrane protein gene family [29,30].
To understand the possible roles of trypanosome RBPs, it
is necessary to identify mRNA targets whose half-lives or
activities are modulated by interactions with the RBPs.
TcUBP1 has been reported to bind to 3'-UTR sequences
encompassing AU-rich elements (AREs) with AUUUA,
AUUUUA, and AUUUUUA motifs, and showed specificity
for poly(U) and poly(G) homoribopolymers. TcRBP3 displayed a different homoribopolymer-binding pattern,
showing specificity for poly(A), poly(C), and poly(G)
[26]. In this study, we systematically identified cellular
targets for TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 and report on structural
RNA elements conserved in each group of transcripts.
These signature RNA motifs were successfully used to predict putative TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 target mRNAs from
trypanosome databases.

Results
Identification of TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 mRNA targets
A comparative RNA-protein interaction analysis was performed using mRNP immunopurification assays, with the
aid of specific antibodies raised against each RRM-type
protein, TcUBP1 and TcRBP3. These two RBPs show distinct amino acid compositions in their RRM regions (Fig.
1). In particular, the sequences demonstrate differences
within the loops of the RNA-binding domain spatial
structure, which has been shown to confer specificity for
RNA-binding in other proteins [31,32]. In addition, both
proteins differ at one amino acid position (Asn153 in
TcRBP3 vs Ala120 in TcUBP1), which is one of the four
TcUBP1 residues (Phe88, Arg113, Lys115 and Ala120) predicted to be involved in RNA recognition [28]. To determine if this change might influence the nature of
transcripts with which the RBPs can associate, cytosolic
cell-free extracts of T. cruzi epimastigotes prepared under
conditions that preserved mRNA-protein interactions
were incubated with either anti-TcUBP1 or anti-TcRBP3
antibodies. The RNA extracted from mRNP complexes
was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer, amplified by PCR, and used to construct a library of transcripts
associated with each protein (see Fig. 2A for the experimental approach and Methods for details). A fraction
(10%) of the immunoprecipitation (IP) material was used
to analyze proteins by Western-blot assays. As shown in
Figure 2B, each antibody can specifically detect unique
bands of the expected sizes in protein extracts (Input).

Furthermore, TcUBP1 was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-TcUBP1 antibody, whereas TcRBP3 was
found in the TcRBP3-IP material. In contrast, both proteins were undetectable in the reciprocal IP assay or when
the IP was performed using preimmune serum.
Our analysis revealed that, among the identified TcUBP1bound mRNAs, 24 sequences shared significant similarity
(>95%) to known genes and 10 to hypothetical protein
transcripts. A large proportion of the transcripts identified
code for proteins involved in metabolism or glycoproteins. The list of TcUBP1 target hits is shown in Table 1.
Transcripts found in TcRBP3 IP material comprise 3 hypothetical proteins and 21 annotated mRNAs, including 12
different ribosomal protein-encoding (RPC) genes of
large and small subunit proteins (see Table 2 for a complete list of RBP3-bound RNAs). RPC transcripts are abundant cellular mRNAs that may co-precipitate nonspecifically; their detection might thus be attributable to
non-specific association. However, these transcripts were
not immunoprecipitated by preimmune serum or an
unrelated RBP antibody (see Additional File 1), indicating
that the RPC genes identified are bona fide targets.
Sequences reported as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)
were also present in both IPs. In addition, common tar-

Specific mRNA targets are differentially represented when
comparing TcUBP1- and TcRBP3-containing mRNP
complexes
The presence of target mRNAs in mRNP complexes was
validated in IP reactions using antibodies against individual RBPs. Bound RNAs were reverse transcribed and the
presence of several randomly chosen targets from each
library was analyzed by PCR. All transcripts expected to
bind to TcUBP1 or TcRBP3 were confirmed to be present
in each IP sample. A control mRNA encoding TcRBP3
(RBP3), a transcript that does not bind to any of the RBPs
tested, gave negative results. In all cases, samples were
incubated with RNAse-free DNAse before reverse transcription and negative controls without reverse transcriptase were included to exclude the possibility of
contamination with genomic DNA (results not shown).
Non-specific RNA-protein associations were determined
by parallel incubations with preimmune serum, and
undetectable or low levels of PCR amplification signals
were obtained from these controls (Fig. 3A). We and other
authors [33,34] have observed PCR products in immunoprecipitates performed with control serum. However,
these bands were in all cases much fainter than bands
present in IP samples obtained using antibodies against
the RBPs. Some TcUBP1 targets derived from the library
were found in TcRBP3-IP material, and sequenced targets
for TcRBP3 were also present in the group of purified transcripts obtained using anti-TcUBP1 antibodies. However,
semiquantitative RT-PCR reactions demonstrated that
specific transcripts were enriched in each sample (see the
500-fold dilution data in Fig. 3A). To further analyze these
results, TcUBP1- and TcRBP3-associated transcripts in
each IP were measured using real-time PCR. Specific primers for Zinc Finger Protein 1 (ZFP1) (Tc00.10470535
11511.6), Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta (PDH)
(Tc00.1047053510091.80), Ribosomal protein S2 (RpS2)
(Tc00.1047053506213.60), and Calpain-like cysteine peptidase (CALP) (Tc00.1047053509001.40) were used. Realtime PCR was performed on samples immunoprecipitated with antibodies against TcUBP1 or TcRBP3, so it was
not possible to use a reference transcript to standardize
the assays. To overcome this drawback, we compared the
ratios of the values obtained for each TcUBP1 target
mRNA over each TcRBP3 transcript within TcUBP1-IP or

TcRBP3-IP material (see Methods for details). The data
presented in Figure 3B are representative of three independent assays. The results indicated that TcUBP1 target
transcripts were enriched in TcUBP1 IP material. Thus,
ZFP1 (a TcUBP1 transcript target) levels were 24- and 14fold more abundant than those of CALP and RpS2 (both
TcRBP3 targets), respectively; and PDH levels (PDH is also
a TcUBP1 transcript target) were 3- and 1.7-fold higher
than those of CALP and RpS2. These ratios were lower in
the group of TcRBP3-associated transcripts (black bars in
Fig. 3B, left panel).
Reciprocal analysis of the relative ratios of TcRBP3 over
TcUBP1 targets in the pool of TcRBP3-bound mRNAs
showed that CALP levels were 1.5- and 1.6-fold higher
than those of ZFP1 and PDH, respectively, and similar values (1.5 and 2.1, respectively) were found when RpS2 was
analyzed. As anticipated, these ratios were significantly
lower in the TcUBP1-IP material (gray bars in Fig. 3B, right
panel).
Mitochondrial transcripts and rRNAs were repeatedly
found in both TcUBP1- and TcRBP3-IP samples. As these

transcripts are highly abundant, and as neither RBP is
localized in mitochondria ([35] and G. Noé, J. De Gaudenzi and A. C. Frasch, unpublished work), they probably
correspond to background noise arising from non-physiological association during isolation [36]. To address this
controversial result, and to obtain evidence for the occurrence of the observed interactions in intact cells, formaldehyde treatment prior to cell lysis was performed to
crosslink RNP complexes in living parasites. Analysis of
RNA present in IP-samples isolated from treated cells further supported the endogenous interaction of both proteins with rRNAs and confirmed several TcUBP1- and
TcRBP3-associated transcripts as in vivo targets (Fig. 3C,
and data not shown). In contrast, mitochondrial transcripts were not found in association with either RBP in
cells treated by crosslinking, thus demonstrating that such
interactions were non-physiological (Fig. 3C). In summary, these data allow us to conclude that most mRNAs
identified in our libraries (Tables 1 and 2) are likely to be
RBP-target transcripts. Although both TcRBPs can share
target transcripts, each preferentially binds a given set of
mRNAs.

List of transcripts found in association with immunoprecipitated TcRBP3. Excluding rRNAs and mitochondrial transcripts, the total number of

were of minor occurrence in the entire T. cruzi RefSeq
database (see Table 3). A common stem-loop structure
within these sequences was observed, suggesting that the
TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 proteins might recognize structural
elements rather than a particular sequence in the mRNAs.
This means that different mRNAs might harbor the same
structural motif even though they do not share the same
sequence. Figure 4 shows the frequency of nucleotides at
each position obtained from multiple alignment of the
elements found within all of the target transcripts. Five
representative examples of sequences and secondary
structures in distinct mRNAs are also graphically represented (Figs. 4A and 4B).
Covariance model searches [37] allowed us to identify
transcripts in databases that contained each of the motifs
analyzed. These mRNAs are novel putative targets for each

of the TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 proteins (database targets). A
total of 1,547 additional EST targets (~10% of the total T.
cruzi EST database) were identified using UBP1m in the
search. In addition, 355 database transcripts (~2% of the
database) bearing RBP3m were found. Table 3 shows the
percentages of experimentally selected transcripts harboring the motifs and compares it with the percentages of
transcripts in the RefSeq database (T. cruzi-filtered) bearing the motifs. The results show that the selected motifs
are enriched in the experimental dataset compared with
the entire transcriptome. Although most of the TcUBP1
experimental targets (70.27%) contain one or two copies
of UBP1m, some lack this motif, indicating that other
motifs may also be relevant for TcUBP1 binding. Similarly, RBP3m was represented in ~70% of the experimental dataset, which also suggests the existence of alternative

Validation of experimental transcripts
Validation of experimental transcripts. A) IP assays and semiquantitative RT-PCR amplification (25–30 cycles) were done
to test library and non-related targets (RBP3) in the fraction of mRNAs bound to each protein. Specific set of primers shown at
the right side of each panel were used. Only representative dilutions are shown. B) Abundance of transcripts present in
TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 IP samples was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Two mRNA targets for each protein in each IP sample
were quantified. The relations of TcUBP1 over TcRBP3 targets in TcUBP1, and in TcRBP3 IP samples are plotted. The inverse
relations are also shown. C) Parasites were in vivo treated with formaldehyde to maintain endogenous mRNP previous to IP
and RT-PCR assays. PS, preimmune serum.

motifs involved in TcRBP3 binding (see following sections).
We next assigned relative frequencies to both motifs,
reflecting the number of hits found in each group of transcripts divided by its sequence length (represented as hits
per kb). UBP1m and RBP3m were 16.5- and ~19-fold,
respectively, overrepresented in the experimental dataset
compared with the T. cruzi RefSeq database (Table 3).
Moreover, when the relative frequencies of motifs within
5'-upstream genomic sequences (5'-US), coding
sequences (CDS), and 3'-downstream genomic sequences
(3'-DS), of the experimental dataset and the T. cruzi CL
Brener genomic sequence database were compared, a
higher enrichment in the 3'-DS was observed, denoting a
preferred 3'-UTR localization for both motifs (Table 4).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the structural elements identified in trypanosomal transcripts are
conserved and enriched within the experimental set of
transcripts and that these motifs are preferentially localized in the 3'-UTRs.
RNA motifs enhance RNA-TcUBP1 or -TcRBP3
interactions
The capacity of each RRM-type protein to bind biotinylated transcripts harboring the described motifs was
tested. The RNA-protein complexes were pulled-down
with streptavidin-coated beads and the presence of the
protein revealed by Western blotting. ZFP1m is a short
region of the ZFP1 mRNA that contains UBP1m, whereas
RpS5m is a portion of the RpS5 transcript harboring
RBP3m (Fig. 4C). Both fragments were inserted into a
pGEM-T polylinker transcript and are termed pGEM-T
ZFP1m(+) and pGEM-T RpS5m(+), respectively. A pGEMT polylinker transcript without any insert was used as a
negative control because in silico predictions indicated
that this sequence did not contain any of the motifs under
analysis. RNAs were transcribed in vitro in the presence of
CTP-Biotin and incubated with recombinant GST-tagged
TcUBP1, TcRBP3, or GST alone (as a control). pGEM-T

failed to show binding to TcRBP3 or to control GST protein. In contrast, pGEM-T RpS5m(+), pulled-down
TcRBP3 but not TcUBP1 or GST (Fig. 4D). The control
transcript (pGEM-T) failed to show binding to any of the
TcRBPs.
To analyze if the stem-loop structures identified might be
involved in the interaction of proteins with target mRNAs,
the following transcripts were transcribed and used in
RNA-binding assays: (1) RNAs comprising short flanking
regions with either UBP1m or RBP3m (ZFP1m and
RPS5m); (2) RNAs lacking the motifs but containing only
the flanking regions [ZFP1m(-) and RPS5m(-)]; and, (3)
RNAs in which the motifs of interest were replaced by different sequences [ZFP1m (mut) and RPS5m (mut)]. As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, weak binding was seen when
the motifs were absent [ZFP1m(-) and RPS5m(-)] or when
they were substituted by other sequences [ZFP1m (mut)
or RPS5m (mut)]. It is to be noted that RBP3 did not bind
to RpS5m (mut) construct albeit it folds into a stem-loop
structure. Besides, it did not bind other predicted stemloops such as the one present in the ZFP1 3'-UTR showed
in Figure 4D, indicating that slight differences in the RNA
structure affect RNA-binding. Contrary, transcripts bearing complete UBP1m or RBP3m motifs showed considerably enhanced interactions with the corresponding RBPs.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the identified RNA elements are involved in interactions with RBPs
and that transcripts can be rendered targets for UBP1 or
RBP3 by addition of the correct RNA motif.
Assessment of the validity of novel target transcripts
identified in databases
To test the usefulness of UBP1m and RBP3m elements in
predicting novel targets, we first manually classified (into
nine functional categories) all motif-containing
sequences obtained from dbEST, which had been previously filtered using the annotation file provided by TIGR
[38] (Additional files 2 and 3). Target mRNAs present in
each experimental dataset were also classified (as listed in

Tables 1 and 2). The overall distribution of transcripts in
these groups was similar when comparing database and
experimental targets for each of TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 proteins, but was different when the comparison was performed between targets of both proteins (Fig. 6A). Thus, a
statistically significant difference (chi-square, p < 0.001)
was found between the distribution of UBP1 and RBP3
database targets. Although mRNAs from various categories were identified, groups with larger numbers of transcripts were found. mRNAs coding for proteins involved
in general metabolic pathways are overrepresented in
both datasets of TcUBP1 targets analyzed. Conversely,
RPC transcripts are the most distinctive group among
TcRBP3 database and experimental targets.
We then investigated whether some of the putative database targets identified in silico might indeed be able to
interact with the corresponding RBP. In vivo IP assays
were performed and RT-PCR was used to detect transcripts
encoding the 29-kDa proteasome subunit class II mRNA
(PROT) (TCU75302) and Paraflagellar rod component 1
mRNA (PARB1) (Tc00.1047053506755.20), both of
which are putative targets for TcUBP1, and Ribosomal
protein S8 mRNA (RpS8) (Tc00.1047053511903.110)
and Membrane transporter protein mRNA (MTP)
(Tc00.1047053511307.3), both of which are predicted
targets for TcRBP3. The association of database targets
with the two proteins was then investigated by RNA
extraction from purified mRNP complexes followed by
RT-PCR. All database targets studied were found in the
pool of bound RNAs (Fig. 6B). In summary, the motifs
identified for TcUBP1 or TcRBP3 binding can be effectively used to identify novel target transcripts for both
RBPs. Furthermore, these results allowed us to recognize
groups of mRNAs with common functions as potential
binding partners for each protein.
Common target RNAs for TcUBP1 and TcRBP3
Based on the above data on RNA-protein interactions,
demonstrating that both RBPs can share transcripts, we
sought to identify whether some targets might also contain both previously described motifs, UBP1m and
RBP3m. Eleven database transcripts might potentially be
common to both proteins (Table 5). This list includes
RPC genes (RpS6, RpL29), PDH, and Histones, among others.
Interestingly,
the
HYPO1
gene
(Tc00.1047053506811.120) is a library-derived target for
both RBPs (Fig. 7A, Tables 1 and 2), bearing a region in
which UBP1m intersects RBP3m. Here, the two motifs are
superimposed in the same region inside the 3'-UTR
(RBP3m nt 79–112, UBP1m nt 90–115) (see Fig. 7B). In
vitro binding assays were performed to investigate whether
both proteins could bind to and compete for this region.
As shown in Figure 7C, increasing amounts of TcRBP3 in
the presence of fixed amounts of TcUBP1 caused a reduc-

that both proteins bind to common sites in HYPO1 3'UTR in a competitive manner and support the view that
TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 can share RNA targets.

Additional motifs can also govern the binding of TcRBPs to
target transcripts
To obtain additional evidence for the existence of common transcript targets for both RBPs, we analyzed the list
of other possible cis-elements mentioned above. About 15
motifs enriched in the group of experimental targets for
each RBP were found (Table 6), and all shared a common
stem-loop structure. The overall distribution of motifs

within some transcripts was analyzed. A 'hot spot' region
for motifs was observed, and some overlapped at the primary sequence level, suggesting that binding sites could
not be defined simply by structure. TcRBP3 motifs can be
found in some TcUBP1-bound mRNAs and vice versa.
There are also regions bearing TcUBP1 and TcRBP3
motifs. For example, a portion of UBP1m in the ZFP1 3'UTR coincides with UBP1-m3 and UBP1-m4. Down-

stream, the putative motifs detected for TcUBP1 extend
beyond the potential motif for TcRBP3 (see Fig. 8A).
Some mRNAs contain several motifs for either TcUBP1 or
TcRBP3, indicating that certain RNA signals may be
redundantly present. Thus, binding of both RBPs might
occur at distinct sites of 3'-UTR target mRNAs (Additional
file 4). In accordance with previous results, TcRBP3 database targets with several motifs include RPC genes [RpS10

PARB1 3'-UTR that contains overlapping motifs (UBP1m14 and RBP3-m2) for each protein was analyzed (Fig.
8B). First, RT-PCR with IP samples was performed to show
that PARB1 3'-UTR is a target for both proteins. Second,
the ability of both RBPs to bind the region of the PARB1
3'-UTR that contains UBP1-m14 and RBP3-m2 was confirmed (a in Fig. 8C). In contrast, both RBPs were incapable of interacting with a portion of the UTR deficient in
these motifs (b in Fig. 8C). These data demonstrate that
TcRBPs can bind to more than one motif and suggest that
subsets of cellular targets for each protein may be determined by the combination of different possible motifs
within these transcripts.

The functionality of the RNA molecule depends not only
on primary sequence information but also on secondary
folding. Work on RNA motif discovery is relevant to better
understand the metabolism of RNA, which essentially
relies on interaction of transcripts with proteins. In recent
years, high-throughput techniques have been developed
to map post-transcriptional networks; these combine the
isolation and identification of mRNAs from cell extracts
(such as the RNP IP-microarray/Chip [39]) with Ribotrap
analysis to determine bound proteins [40]. Methods to
detect structural elements in a set of RNA molecules were
recently published [41], and a web server for RNA data
analysis, with significant capabilities for RNA secondary
structures prediction was released [42]. In this work, RNA
structural elements were identified in target transcripts of
two different RRM-containing trypanosomal RBPs
[25,26,29,35]. This subject is particularly relevant to work
with Kinetoplastid parasites, because gene expression in
such cells is basically controlled at the post-transcriptional
level. It is known that regulatory regions of transcripts
contain cis-elements that determine the fate of monocistronic mRNAs by interaction with specific trans-acting
RBPs, but much work remains to be done to determine
these molecular mechanisms [43]. Targets for trypanosome RRM-type proteins have been studied for only a few
RBPs, such as the PUF family members in T. brucei and T.
cruzi [44-46]. In the present work, a library of transcripts
extracted from TcUBP1- or TcRBP3-containing mRNP
complexes allowed the identification of target mRNAs.
Signature motifs in these transcripts were found and
shown to be useful, in turn, in the prediction of other
putative transcript targets in databases. Some of these
mRNAs were shown to be complexed with the relevant
proteins, thus confirming the feasibility of the approach
for the identification of groups of transcripts binding to a
given RBP.

Distinct categories of sequence motifs involved in multiple levels of mRNA metabolism have previously been
mapped in trypanosomes (reviewed in references [19] and
[47]). For example, a 26-mer U-rich bloodstream-form
instability element [48] and a 16-mer stem-loop required
for efficient translation [49] were both described in the 3'UTR of the EP procyclin T. brucei transcript. These regulatory signals are common to several genes. In Leishmania, a
450-nt 3'-UTR element conserved among a large number
of amastin mRNAs is responsible for stage-specific gene
regulation [50], and a consensus motif UAUUUUUU has
also been described for the nuclear-encoded components
of the cytochrome oxidase complex in T. brucei [51]. The
cis-elements UBP1m and RBP3m characterized in this
work are the best signature motifs for the RBPs examined
here, and they are necessary for RNA-binding activities.
However, the motifs were present in only a subset of
experimental transcripts, indicating that several sequence
elements might be involved in RNA-protein recognition.
Therefore, our findings suggest the existence of a wide
variety of RNA target motifs for each factor, as was previously described for other RBPs such as TIA-1, TIAR, HuR,
and Puf proteins [33,34,52]. Additional motifs were also
functional in TcRBP binding and we found 3'-UTRs in several transcripts bearing different motifs for either TcUBP1
or TcRBP3 (Additional file 4). Bibliographical reports
indicate that redundancy of cis-elements constitutes a
mechanism to ensure or modulate the functionality of
RNA-protein interaction with a given target transcript
[53,54].
Motifs conserved within the group of TcRBP3-bound transcripts were also found in a number of TcUBP1 experimental mRNA targets, and vice versa, and some of these
regions overlapped. For instance, HYPO1 mRNA, a
library-derived target for both TcRBPs, had a 3'-UTR where
UBP1m intersected RBP3m. This region was able to bind
both proteins, similar to what was recently described for
binding of the yeast Puf1p and Puf5p family members to

a motif within the TIF1 3'-UTR [54]. More generally, we
have demonstrated here that both proteins might share
and bind to common targets, as has been published for
HuR and AUF1 proteins that bind to many common AUrich transcripts [55,56], and yeast Puf4p and MpT5p that
negatively regulate a single mRNA [57].
Results shown in Figure 3 suggest that experimental targets for each protein, TcUBP1 or TcRBP3, could also be
associated with the other protein. Although these findings
are consistent with the relatively non-specific binding
capacity of TbUBP1 and TbUBP2 postulated in T. brucei
[29], real-time PCR experiments have provided evidence
that each RBP preferentially binds a given group of transcripts (Fig. 3B). Thus, the association of mRNAs with
TcUBP1 or TcRBP3 probably depends on many dynamic
factors, including: (1) the abundance of the transcript
itself; (2) the combination of multiple elements the transcript bears in the 3'-UTR; (3) the affinity of each protein
for the different motifs; (4) the accessibility of each RBP
and additional mRNA binding factors; and, (5) the condition of the parasite at any given moment. In this regard, it
has recently been reported that during nutritional stress
TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 re-localize in large cytoplasmic granules [35] containing other RRM-type proteins and polyadenylated mRNAs. Interestingly, under normal
conditions RBPs are also present in discrete, but small,
cytoplasmic granules (G. Noé, J. De Gaudenzi and A. C.
Frasch, unpublished data). The composition of these
mRNP granules might determine the fate of the transcripts
they contain under natural conditions. Further work
should indicate the minimal set of RBPs associated with a
single transcript and will measure the stability, translation, or degradation of such transcripts.
RNA-binding domains are well conserved among Kinetoplastids, so the presence of the identified RNA motifs in
ortholog mRNA targets from T. brucei and L. major was
investigated. To this end, we obtained trypanosomatid

dataset and trypanosome EST database are shown. Δ, indicates the
difference between both percentages.

transcripts that were orthologs of the experimental targets
using the GeneDB web server http://www.geneDB.org,
and searched for RNA structural motifs. Interestingly,
more than 80% (27 of 32) of the UBP1 ortholog transcripts contained UBP1m and 32.4% (12 of 37) of the
ortholog RBP3 targets encompassed RBP3m (data not
shown), suggesting that these RRM proteins could share a
similar set of mRNA targets in the three trypanosomatids.
Functionally related groups of transcripts within the list of
experimental and database targets for each protein were
found. The model that emerges from our results is in line
with the results of an increasing number of studies [5860] that suggest coordination of gene expression by combinatorial binding of RBPs to different subsets of functionally related mRNAs, thus defining a posttranscriptional operon that increases regulatory flexibility
following biological perturbations. Many of the mRNAs

identified in TcUBP1-containing mRNP complexes
encode proteins involved in general metabolic pathways.
Additionally, we found mRNAs encoding several surface
proteins, including SMUG mRNA, a known target for
TcUBP1 [26]. Notably, one of the sequences found
matches the 3'-UTR of four glycoprotein-coding genes
(Gp85, Mucin-like protein, Host cell signaling surface protein
and Trypomastigote surface antigen TSA-1); all possess
nearly the same sequence in their 3'-UTRs and harbor
UBP1m (data not shown). Among the TcRBP3-associated
transcripts experimentally obtained, and also confirmed
in databases (Fig. 6), a large number of RPC genes were
found, thus suggesting the possibility that TcRBP3 may
regulate and coordinate ribosome biogenesis, as has been
previously described for other RRM-type proteins [61,62].
As mentioned, the observations are consistent with the
idea that functionally related mRNAs of trypanosomes
might be coordinately regulated at the post-transcriptional level by specific RBPs, in agreement with the RNA
operon/regulon model suggested for other cells (reviewed
in reference [60]). This or other alternatives are interesting
in the context of a single cell, the trypanosome, which
likely makes RNA metabolism the sole mechanism to regulate gene expression.

Conclusion
In this paper we identified and validated target mRNAs for
two phylogenetically conserved RRM-containing RBPs
among Kinetoplastids. TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 can share target transcripts, although they preferentially bind given
sets of mRNAs. These trypanosomal target transcripts contain conserved structural elements, involved in RNA-binding, in their 3'-UTRs. Moreover, the elements identified
for TcUBP1 or TcRBP3 binding were successfully used to
determine novel database targets that were classified
within groups of common functions. In addition, we
found that trypanosome RBPs can associate with more
than one motif, and the combination of elements is the
main factor in determination of RNA-protein recognition.

Methods
Parasite cultures and transfections
T. cruzi CL Brener cloned stock was used [63]. Culture
conditions and protein extract preparations were according to Di Noia et al. [64].
Databases
Trypanosome database (T. cruzi CL Brener genomic
sequence Release 5.1) utilized in this work was obtained
from TcruziDB server http://www.tcruzidb.org. 5'
upstream genomic sequences (5' US) and 3' downstream
genomic sequences (3' DS) were obtained using TcruziDB
sequence retrieval tool. A length of 50 nt upstream to the
CDS was used to obtain sequences resembling the 5' UTR,
while 300 nt downstream to CDS were used for 3' UTR, in

agreement to previously reported data from trypanosomes [65]. Reference Sequence (RefSeq) and EST databases (T. cruzi filtered) were downloaded from NCBI. The
TIGR T. cruzi Gene Index database http://www.tigr.org/
tdb/tgi was used to analyze and classify all T. cruzi EST
sequences.
Western blot analysis
Protein samples resolved by SDS-PAGE gels were transferred onto Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences), probed with primary
antibodies and developed using horseradish peroxide
conjugated anti rabbit antibodies and Supersignal® West
Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology).
The antibodies used in this work were: polyclonal rabbit
anti-peptide antibody reacting with amino-terminal
domain of TcUBP1 (anti-TcUBP1) and anti-TcRBP3 serum
raised against the complete protein (anti-TcRBP3) [26].
Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays
A cytosolic protein extract corresponding to 109 parasites
was precleared for 30 min at 4°C using rabbit preimmune
serum and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma)
that had been previously swollen in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS). Extract was then incubated with preimmune serum
(as a control), a non-RBP serum anti-T. cruzi Ribose 5phosphate isomerase Type B (TcRpi, used as a control)
[66], anti-TcUBP1 or anti-TcRBP3 serum at 4°C with gentle mixing during 16 h. Beads (100 μl) were added to the
mixture and after 2 h, extensive washes were made with
TBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween-20. An aliquot (10%
of the sample) was separated to asses the present of proteins in the immunoprecipitated material, proteins were
extracted using Laemmli buffer and detected by Western
blotting. The rest of the sample was used for RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions.
In vivo formaldehyde fixation of parasites
Formaldehyde was added to T. cruzi cell cultures to a final
concentration of 1% (v/v) and incubated at 28°C for 15
min with mixing. Crosslinking reactions were quenched
by addition of glycine (final concentration, 250 mM) and
incubation at RT for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with
ice-cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.6, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 M sucrose and 50 mM KCl) and
lysed by 3 rounds of sonication, 30 s each in a Branson
450 sonifier with 0.25 vol of 400 microns glass beads
(Sigma). The lysate was centrifuge at 11 000 g for 10 min
at 4°C and the supernatant was used for IP assays. Reversion of crosslinkings was done by incubation of proteinA-Sepharose beads in 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.6, 5 mM
EDTA, 10 mM DTT and 1% SDS during 45 min at 70°C.

RNA was extracted from IP material using Trizol and the
presence of proteins confirmed by Western blot analysis.
Library constructions and RT-PCRs
RNA extracted from the mRNP complexes was used to perform reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and to construct the library using BD Smart™ PCR
cDNA synthesis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were cloned into
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. RT-PCRs
of RNA extracted from mRNP complexes and serial dilutions of the samples were also used to detect the presence
of target mRNAs using gene specific oligonucleotides
(Additional file 5).
Computational analysis
Modifications to the method previously described by
Silanes et al. were done [33]. The following protocol was
performed for both sets of co-immunoprecipitated
sequences (TcUBP1 and TcRBP3 sets). Briefly, trypanosome records were identified by doing BLAST against five
different databases (TcBr v2.0 genomic DNA, TcruziDB
v5.1 CDS, Swissprot, NR, NT and RefSeq). More than 20
target transcripts (including 3' UTRs) for each gene were
entered in two motif prediction tools using default motif
range (30–100 bp). Using FOLDALIGN [67], sequences
up to 550-bases were divided into 100-bases long subsequences with 50-bases overlap between consecutives
sequences and were organized into 8 random data sets.
Consensus motifs were predicted from each data set.
Using CMfinder [68], sequences up to 500-base long were
submitted to the web server http://bio.cs.washing
ton.edu/yzizhen/CMfinder/. Candidate motifs obtained
with both programs were used to build the stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) model (COVE program). The
SCFG for each candidate motif was used to search against
the experimental 3' UTR data set and the RefSeq database
to obtain the number of hits for each motif (COVELS program) [37]. The motif with the highest enrichment in the
experimental data set over the literature database was considered to be the best candidate motif. The motif logo was
constructed using WebLogo http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/
. Finally, RNAfold tool [69] was used to plot the secondary
structure of the representative RNA motifs. The alignments were done using the on-line workbench server from
the University of California, San Diego http://work
bench.sdsc.edu.
Plasmid constructions
Regions from 3' UTRs of motif-containing transcripts were
amplified by PCR using specific primers (Additional file
6) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The
following genes (with the amplified fragments indicated
between parentheses) were used in this work: ZFP1 (372
to 425), RpS5 (109 to 207), HYPO1 (29 to 158) and

PARB1 [184 to 280 (a) and 184 to 464 (b)]. Construction
of mutated/deleted stem-loop sequences was done by
annealing of synthetic complementary oligonucleotides
(see Additional file 6) followed by ligation into pBS(-)
(Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were mixed, heated to
95°C and allowed to cool slowly producing doublestranded oligonucleotides with added EcoRI and HindIII
cohesive ends in 5' and 3' ends, respectively, that were
inserted by ligation into pBS vector previously digested
with those enzymes.
In vitro Biotin pull-down assay
pGEM-T Easy and pBS(-) plasmids containing the motifs
were digested with SpeI and HindIII, respectively, for in
vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega)
and biotin-14-CTP (Invitrogen). The integrity of each
biotinylated RNA was verified in 1.5% agarose gels. Purified recombinant GST-TcUBP1, GST-TcRBP3 or GST alone
(25 nM) were incubated with 10-fold molar excess of
biotin-RNA in Binding buffer (BB) (100 mM KCl, 1 mM
DTT, 1% glycerol, 1 mM Cl2Mg, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6,
400 μg/ml tRNA, 200 μg/ml BSA and 10 units of RNase
inhibitor) in a final volume of 50 μl for 30 min at room
temperature (RT). 20 μl of Streptavidin-paramagnetic
beads (Promega) previously washed in BB were added
and incubated for 10 min at RT. Magnetic beads were then
isolated and washed 5 times with BB supplemented with
1% Tween-20 and boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer to detect
proteins by Western blotting. For competitive binding
assays, increasing levels of TcRBP3 (12.5, 25 and 150 nM)
were incubated with a fixed concentration of TcUBP1 (25
nM).
Real-time PCR analysis
For RT-PCRs, 50% of total RNA isolated from IPs was
reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and SSII RT
(Invitrogen). Products were diluted in water and amplified by quantitative PCR using specific primers (Additional file 5) in a Gene Amp 5700 Sequence detection
system (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem). PCR was carried out in a final volume of 12.5 μl reaction mixture containing 0.3 μM of each primer, 1× SYBR Green reaction
mix (Applied Biosystem) and 4 μl of cDNA template.
Standard curves were prepared for each run using known
quantities of DNA and estimations of DNA levels were
obtained using the Sequence detection System data analysis software. Two experimental targets were measured for
TcUBP1 (ZFP1 and PDH) and two transcripts for TcRBP3
(CALP and RpS2) in TcUBP1- and in TcRBP3-IP materials.
Relations of quantities found for TcUBP1 over TcRBP3 targets were done for each IP, as well as the inverse relation
(TcRBP3 over TcUBP1 transcripts). The data was analyzed
by comparing those relations in each IP.
