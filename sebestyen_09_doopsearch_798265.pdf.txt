Abstract
Background: The comparative genomic analysis of a large number of orthologous promoter regions of
the chordate and plant genes from the DoOP databases shows thousands of conserved motifs. Most of
these motifs differ from any known transcription factor binding site (TFBS). To identify common conserved
motifs, we need a specific tool to be able to search amongst them. Since conserved motifs from the DoOP
databases are linked to genes, the result of such a search can give a list of genes that are potentially regulated
by the same transcription factor(s).
Results: We have developed a new tool called DoOPSearch http://doopsearch.abc.hu for the analysis of
the conserved motifs in the promoter regions of chordate or plant genes. We used the orthologous
promoters of the DoOP database to extract thousands of conserved motifs from different taxonomic
groups. The advantage of this approach is that different sets of conserved motifs might be found depending
on how broad the taxonomic coverage of the underlying orthologous promoter sequence collection is
(consider e.g. primates vs. mammals or Brassicaceae vs. Viridiplantae). The DoOPSearch tool allows the
users to search these motif collections or the promoter regions of DoOP with user supplied query
sequences or any of the conserved motifs from the DoOP database. To find overrepresented gene
ontologies, the gene lists obtained can be analysed further using a modified version of the GeneMerge
program.
Conclusion: We present here a comparative genomics based promoter analysis tool. Our system is based
on a unique collection of conserved promoter motifs characteristic of different taxonomic groups. We offer
both a command line and a web-based tool for searching in these motif collections using user specified
queries. These can be either short promoter sequences or consensus sequences of known transcription
factor binding sites. The GeneMerge analysis of the search results allows the user to identify statistically
overrepresented Gene Ontology terms that might provide a clue on the function of the motifs and genes.

Background
The traditional bioinformatics approach for transcription
factor binding site (TFBS) discovery uses collections of
known (experimentally verified) TFBS sequences to find
their occurrences in a promoter. These sequences are usually described by a consensus sequence or a position specific matrix (PSM). There are several different databases,
whose main goal is to collect these consensus sequences
and matrices. Two of the better known collections are the
TRANSFAC [1] and JASPAR [2] databases. They contain
information for a large number of different TFBS groups.
Although the consensus sequence and matrix-based
approach has been used for almost twenty years [3], it still
has fundamental problems, such as having either too
many false positives or false negatives.
Another approach is to use sophisticated computer algorithms designed for the ab initio prediction of overrepresented sequence motifs in a collection of promoter
sequences [4,5]. In this case the user provides a number of
promoter regions, thought to be co-regulated or coexpressed, and the computer algorithm identifies statistically overrepresented sequence oligos, putative TFBSs. As
the TFBSs are usually short, the promoter regions long,
and the bases can vary in certain positions, there are similar problems, as in the method mentioned previously.
Besides the traditional analysis methods, the motif discovery algorithms can also be used to find possible TFBSs in
the promoter regions of homologous gene sets. This
method is called phylogenetic footprinting [6], and an
important prerequisite of it is to collect as many orthologous promoter sequences as possible [7]. These sequences
are available in public DNA databases or in broadly
known genome browsers like ENSEMBL [8] or UCSC [9].
The most simple way to collect them however, is to use an
orthologous promoter database, such as OMGProm [10]
for the promoters of mammals, or DoOP [11] for the promoters of chordates and plants. Recent developments in
comparative genomics allow us to search for conserved
motifs in the full genome of a large number of species. The
first collections of conserved sequence motifs are now
available for downloading and/or browsing. Xie et al. [12]
analysed the human, mouse, rat and dog whole genome
alignments, and described 174 sequence motifs that were
highly conserved. These motifs are now part of the JASPAR
database [2], thereby they can be used in a promoter analysis. The cisRED [13] database and the CORG [14] framework are based on the human genome annotation from
ENSEMBL and on the COMPARA database respectively,
complemented by other sources. The extracted homologous gene sets in the cisRED database were analysed using
different motif discovery programs in order to find conserved sequence regions. The DoOP database [11,15] contains more than one million different conserved sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S6

motifs from the promoters of chordate and plant homologous gene sets. These motifs are derived from the conserved regions of DIALIGN [16] alignments of the
orthologous promoters and thus represent a collinear set
of possible TFBSs.
There are a growing number of methods and websites that
offer promoter analysis tools and use different combinations of the abovementioned approaches. In general, they
are more or less relying on the extra information coming
from comparative genomics methods, and orthologous
promoter collections [17-19].
Our aim was to develop a collection of web-based tools to
search with known or de novo discovered TFBSs, as well as
with longer promoter sequences, in order to collect and
examine in detail genes with similar conserved motifs in
their promoter regions. In this paper we describe the
DoOPSearch tool that provides a new and unique method
to search the motif collections of the DoOP database with
a new program called MOFEXT. The server also provides a
simple pattern search, based on FUZZNUC, in the promoter regions of chordate and plant genes. To analyse the
Gene Ontology terms associated with a given gene in the
results, we integrated the GeneMerge program into DoOPSearch. In addition, a Perl API called Bio::DOOP was also
developed for the easy manipulation and querying of the
DoOP database content.

Methods
Determining conserved motifs from orthologous promoters
of different taxonomic groups
In the original DoOP database [11], we used all the available orthologous promoter sequences of each gene to generate the multiple alignments and to determine the
evolutionary conserved motifs. Now we are using four
and ten different taxonomic categories in the chordate
and plant collections when selecting sequences for the
multiple alignments (Figure 1). The narrowest category
amongst the plants is the Brassicaceae family (Table 1),
which includes the Brassica species besides Arabidopsis
thaliana (as the originating species of the orthologous
clustering process). The following is the eudicotyledons
category, which also includes additional dicot species like
Medicago truncatula, Solanum lycopersicum, Populus trichocarpa, Ricinus communis and others. The next one is the
Magnoliophyta, which includes the monocot species like
Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and finally the Viridiplantae,
which incorporates every species involved in the analysis.
We have defined ten taxonomic categories in the chordate
section (Table 2). The first one is the Primates, which contains the Homo sapiens as the originating species and all
the monkeys. The following is the Euarchontoglires, which
contains the Primates and rodent species like the mouse
and rat. The next category is the Eutheria with all the pla-

Different number of conserved motifs from different taxonomic groups
Different number of conserved motifs from different taxonomic groups. The PTPN23 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 23) promoter cluster contains sequences from 19 different species. If the multiple alignment is
made from all the sequences (subset F) we only find one conserved motif (m1). If we narrow down the taxonomic group to
Theria (subset T), Eutheria (subset E) or Primates (subset P), we find 7, 9 and 23 conserved motifs respectively. The screenshots have been taken from the 500 base pair promoter cluster pages of the PTPN23 gene in the DoOP database.

cental mammals. The Theria category also includes the
marsupials like the opossum, and the mammalian category contains all the mammals including the egg-laying
platypus. The subsequent categories are the Amniota
(mammals as well as birds and reptiles), the Tetrapoda
(Amniota together with the amphibians like the Xenopus
species). The Teleostomi category also covers the fishes like
the fugu, zebrafish or Tetraodon nigroviridis. We also have
a category for the Vertebrate and Chordate taxonomical
groups, but due to the drawbacks of our orthologous finding algorithm [11], they contain only a small number of
conserved motifs and are practically unusable.
Searching in the conserved motif collections and promoter
sequences
As a result of the orthologous promoter analysis, several
motif collections were defined, which consist of 6–50
base pair long consensus sequences. We developed a simple new program called MOFEXT (MOtiF sEarch and
EXTension) to perform fast gapless searches in the motif
collections containing even more than a million of consensus sequences.

The data is taken from the DoOP database. The description of the
taxonomic groups is written in the text. The method for the
generation of the taxonomic groups and conserved motifs is detailed
on the DoOP database web page. http://doop.abc.hu/creation.php.

As input, the MOFEXT program requires one or more
query sequences and one or more motif lists. The program
slides a given length of window specified by the user, over
the query sequence, and starts to compare it with the first
consensus motif from the motif collections. Sliding the
window over the consensus motif, the program calculates
a score for each position using a predefined scoring
matrix. The overall score is then calculated by adding the
individual scores of each position together. The program
also calculates the maximum possible score for each window of the query sequence by comparing it with itself.
Using these scores, the program calculates a percentage
value for each pair of query and motif sequence window.
If this percentage value is larger than the cut-off value, and
the length of the query and the consensus motif from the
list is longer than the window size, the program tries to
extend the match in both directions. This means that the
program calculates the score as above for each possible
overlapping window with an increasing size between the
query and consensus sequence, and keeps the one with
the highest score. The MOFEXT program accepts the
standard IUPAC nucleotide.
For the search in the sequences of individual promoter
regions, the FUZZNUC program was used from the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS)
[20].
Developing a Perl API for handling and analysing the
DoOP data
In order to allow simple access of the data available in the
DoOP database we have developed a set of Perl modules
called Bio::DOOP. These modules are following the style
of the BIOPERL modules [21], and used mainly for querying the MySQL backend of the DoOP database. The
Bio::DOOP modules are available from the CPAN Perl
repository http://search.cpan.org/~tibi/ with a complete
documentation. They are suitable for using in individual
PERL scripts for querying the DoOP database through the
net, and for building more complex promoter analysis
tools. It is possible for example to simply download species-specific promoter sequences, determine the positions
of conserved motifs, or to download the conserved motif
sequences. The Bio::DOOP Perl modules also run and
parse the results of the MOFEXT program, the FUZZNUC
program from the EMBOSS package [20], and the GeneMerge Perl script [22].
Construction of the DoOPSearch tool
The DoOPSearch tool is running on a two processor Linux
server. The forms are generated using PHP scripts. The
programs are called and their results processed using Perl
scripts. Most of the data, including the search results, are
stored in a MySQL database. The reading and writing of
the MySQL database is carried out with the Bio::DOOP

Perl modules. The standalone MOFEXT program was written in standard C language. It is available upon request as
source code or in precompiled binaries for different platforms. A typical MOFEXT or FUZZNUC search with
default parameters ranges in about 10–20 seconds.
Depending on the input data and search parameters, however, running a query and processing the results can take
several minutes or up to an hour. The database design is
basically the same as in the DoOP database, with an additional motif search layer, which can't be implemented
with MySQL queries [11], and provides a simple and easy
to use interface for searching, browsing and analysing the
results [15].

Results
The DoOPSearch tool provides an easy to use interface for
searching in the promoter data provided by the chordate
and plant sections of the DoOP database. The searches
result in lists of genes, containing similar sequences to the
query in their promoter regions. These gene lists can be
further analysed with the GeneMerge program to discover
statistically overrepresented Gene Ontology terms [23].
The first step of the workflow is similar to that of the
DoOP database. After choosing the chordate or plant section, the user can enter different queries and parameters
for searching in the conserved motif collections and promoter sequences. The query types and parameters
together with the results returned will be described in
detail in the following sections.
Searching in the conserved motif collections
The MOFEXT search is suitable for searching in the different conserved motif collections. The input sequence can
be a consensus sequence motif or part of a promoter/UTR
sequence. The purpose of this type of search is to find
genes sharing the same putative TFBSs or promoter fragments. Finding a similar sequence in a conserved position
can be a strong indication of some kind of biological function. The sensitivity and specificity of the search depends
on the parameters used. The word size parameter heavily
influences the sensitivity and speed of the initial search. It
is worth considering using a large word size, or even the
whole length of the motif if the query is a known TFBS,
and set a rather low cut-off value. In the case of smaller
word sizes, the number of hits will increase dramatically,
as the MOFEXT program applies the cut-off value prior to
extending the hit motif sequence and the results will contain a large number of similar but small motifs. After testing several alternatives the EDNAFULL scoring matrix was
chosen from the EMBOSS package [20]. The consensus
sequences from the DoOP database are post-processed
and divided into different sub-collections of motifs. The
DoOP database for example, contains orthologous promoters with three different sizes (500, 1000 or 3000 base
pair length), and so the motifs fall into three different cat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S6

egory according to the length of the originating promoters. It is also possible to pick motif collections with the
consensus generated using promoter sequences only from
a strictly defined monophyletic taxonomic group
(described in the Methods section). Users can combine
the available motif collections, but in the case of larger
collections, the running time increases significantly.
The results include the cluster id of the promoter cluster
containing the motif similar to the query, a short description, the type and size of the cluster, and the score of the
motif. The results are sorted by the MOFEXT scores, the
cluster containing the motif with the highest score coming
first. It is also possible to sort the results by cluster id or
filter them by the score value, cluster type or size. Furthermore, the sequences can be downloaded from here in
FASTA format, and a GeneMerge analysis (described later)
can be launched.
Searching in the full promoter regions
The FUZZNUC search tool utilizes the FUZZNUC program of the European Molecular Biology Open Software
Suite (EMBOSS). The users can choose between the 500,
1000 and 3000 base pair promoter sets. There are also
options to search only in the promoter sequences of a
given reference organism (Homo sapiens in the case of
chordates and Arabidopsis thaliana in the case of plants), or
every sequence from different species available in each
cluster of promoters. The result page is similar to the
MOFEXT result page with the same options, such as
observing a given promoter cluster, sorting or filtering the
results, downloading the sequences or launching a GeneMerge analysis.
Gene Ontology analysis of the gene lists
If we use a single TFBS as the query in a MOFEXT or FUZZNUC search, we can assume that the genes containing the
same putative TFBS in their promoter regions are under
similar transcriptional control, and thus their function
can also be similar. Based on this approach the gene lists
can be analysed in a way similar to those coming from
microarray experiments. Since most of these genes are
associated with one or more Gene Ontology (GO) term
[23], we can test the gene lists with different statistical
methods to find over-represented GO categories. We have
chosen the GeneMerge program [22] to do this on our
DoOPSearch website. As the original GeneMerge program
proved to be quite slow, we slightly modified it, to make
it usable in our DoOPSearch tool.

The result of the statistical analysis greatly depends on the
size of the input lists. In our case, both the population,
and the study size can vary between different runs. The
population size depends on the motif collection subsets
or promoter sequence collections used in the original

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 6):S6

MOFEXT or FUZZNUC search. The study size can be
altered by selecting and using different number of genes
on the MOFEXT or FUZZNUC search result page. Since
the results of the GeneMerge runs (especially the significance of the evaluated GO terms) can vary considerably by
changing the initial MOFEXT and FUZZNUC search
parameters and/or the number of genes fed to the GeneMerge program, it is worth trying several runs and several
filtering parameters to find the best result.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S6

promoter regions than other type of genes, but to confirm
this, we need to perform other analyses.
In the other case study (Figure 3) we used the binding site
of the NF-kappa B gene [25]. As a control we used the (not
reverse) complement of the NF-kappa B binding site. The
results clearly show the strength of our approach.
Although there are some significantly enriched GO terms
at the fake site as well, the difference proves the value of
our analysis.

Discussion
Searching for evolutionary conserved motifs
The first motif collections of the DoOP database were generated using all the available sequences of a given promoter cluster. We noticed however, that using promoter
sequences from smaller taxonomic groups improves the
alignments significantly and thus can yield different conserved motifs. The evolutionary sense of this approach is
the following. If for example a new TFBS had arisen in the
placental mammals (Eutheria), it would appear as conserved motif only in an alignment made with only from
the Eutherian sequences. In the other alignments, which
in turn contain evolutionary more distant species, it can
be a non-conserved and so unnoticed region. It must be
also mentioned that different orthologous promoter clusters can have different number of species, which in turn
can affect the determination of conserved motifs in our
algorithm. We defined the taxonomic categories based on
this logic. To our knowledge there are no similar motif
collections available, taking into account the evolutionary
distance between the species used in the phylogenetic
footprinting.
Case studies
Basically two types of analysis can be carried out with the
DoOPSearch tool. Either a longer promoter fragment, or a
short conserved motif, known TFBS can be used as a query
in the MOFEXT or FUZZNUC search.

First we demonstrate how a longer sequence can be used
for promoter analysis (Figure 2). Earlier we determined
both with experimental and in silico analysis tools, a promoter element in the upstream region of the matrilin-1
gene [24]. In this example we used a 300 base pair
upstream fragment starting from the ATG start codon of
the human matrilin-1 gene available at the DoOP database
[15]. As a control, we chose the FABP4 gene and used the
same promoter region. After the MOFEXT search with
exactly the same parameters, we filtered the result and ran
the GeneMerge analysis. It is clear that there are specific
Gene Ontology categories overrepresented in each example. It is also obvious that some categories like "transcription" or "transcription factor activity" can be found in
both results. The explanation for this can be that the transcription factors contain more conserved motifs in their

These examples show how can the DoOPSearch tool help
the in silico annotation of longer promoter regions, known
TFBSs or conserved motifs with unknown functions. It
must be mentioned however, that to reach these result we
had to try different parameters both in the MOFEXT
search (word size, cut-off value and motif collection), and
also in the GeneMerge analysis.

Conclusion
The DoOPSearch tool in combination with the
Bio::DoOP Perl modules and the MOFEXT program are
suitable to search for conserved promoter motifs or
sequence patterns. Although there are a number of tools
and services available for computational analysis of transcriptional regulation using different methods, to our
knowledge DoOPSearch is the first tool which gives the
opportunity to search in chordate or plant conserved
motif collections. To perform such a search, we have
developed a program called MOFEXT which utilizes a
simple gapless word matching and scoring algorithm in
order to search in a collections of conserved motifs, like
our motif collections from the DoOP database.
DoOPSearch is an ideal bioinformatics tool for researchers looking for potentially co-expressed genes, or putative
TFBSs in the upstream regions of different genes. Using
the MOFEXT search it is relatively easy to find genes containing conserved motifs in their promoter regions similar
to the query. The query can either be a short experimentally verified binding site or a promoter region with
unknown TFBSs but proven regulatory functions. By recognizing that the results from the MOFEXT or FUZZNUC
searches might contain co-expressed genes similar to the
results of microarray experiments, we offer a unique tool
to assign Gene Ontology terms and functions to a motif.
The method cerainly contains a lot of ambiguity and
might give false positive results, but after a detailed analysis it might be a good indicator of the role of a TFBS in
gene regulation. We believe that using improved multiple
alignments (with more species for example) and using
more accurately defined promoter regions, our method
could be improved significantly and help in the in silico
annotation of TFBSs.

We downloaded the 500 base pair promoter region of the matrilin-1 (A1) and FABP4 (B1) genes. We used the last 300 base pair
of these sequences as a query in the MOFEXT search with the following parameters: wordsize: 8, cutoff: 70 and the 1000 base

151-40 (MATN1) and 105-40 (FABP4) for the GeneMerge analysis (A3 and B3). The genes in the GO term "Extracellular matrix
(sensu metazoan)" are listed in the panel A4. Some genes in the GO term "positive regulation of transcription from RNA

We constantly develop and update the data and the web
interface. Due to the growing number of genome annotations and available genome sequences, the quality of the
conserved motif collections will improve considerably.
We also: (I) try to refine and improve the existing motif
collections; (II) define and use new conserved motif collections; (III) implement new filtering functions, allowing
the user to define a subset of genes (for example co-regulated genes from microarray experiments) used in the
search; (IV) transfer the server to faster hardware and
improve the speed of the MOFEXT search by preliminary
runs, comparing the available motifs with each other
using default parameters.
