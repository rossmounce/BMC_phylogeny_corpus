Abstract
Quantifying the impact of scientific research is almost always controversial, and there is a need for
a uniform method that can be applied across all fields. Increasingly, however, the quantification has
been summed up in the impact factor of the journal in which the work is published, which is known
to show differences between fields. Here the h-index, a way to summarize an individual's highly
cited work, was calculated for journals over a twenty year time span and compared to the size of
the journal in four fields, Agriculture, Condensed Matter Physics, Genetics and Heredity and
Mathematical Physics. There is a linear log-log relationship between the h-index and the size of the
journal: the larger the journal, the more likely it is to have a high h-index. The four fields cannot be
separated from each other suggesting that this relationship applies to all fields. A strike rate index
(SRI) based on the log relationship of the h-index and the size of the journal shows a similar
distribution in the four fields, with similar thresholds for quality, allowing journals across diverse
fields to be compared to each other. The SRI explains more than four times the variation in citation
counts compared to the impact factor.

Background
Measuring quality in science can be a difficult and lengthy
process [1-7]. Verbal descriptions are probably best for
describing the major achievements of individuals, with
descriptors such as "revolutionised biology by formulating the theory of natural selection" to "honest toiler in the
field". Although this is the favoured method of thinking
of individuals, i.e., one does not introduce someone as
Dr. Brown, whose work has been cited 3,000 times and
who has an h-index [1] of 29 (or 29 articles cited 29 or
more times), these qualitative statements of major
achievements can be difficult to quantify. Further, choices
often have to be made between individuals from different
fields, or levels of remuneration have to be set, and some
objective method is often required. While this ranking

may be invidious [3], of journals, their scientific content
and, by extension, the scientists themselves, it is also now
quite firmly entrenched, and universal methods for assessing quality are required.
A first approach to a universal method of objective quantification of quality or usefulness would be to count citations, but using citation counts is not without its
problems. Part of the difficulty in using citation counts is
that different fields have different rates of citation. One
has only to compare human genetics to cnidarian phylogeny (9940 vs 36 articles, highest citation count 1768 vs
112 see Methods). So comparing number of citations
across diverse fields is inappropriate, although within a

narrow field it may be the best way to quantify the impact
of an article [2].
The impact factor of the journal suffers from the same limitation, that of differences in citation rate between fields,
and although the data are normalised against the total
number of citations that the journal receives, there are
large differences in median impact factor between fields
[8]. Many scientists and administrators use the impact factor to gauge scientific worth, or where to send their next
manuscript [9], even if it is a poorer measure of quality of
the individual article than the citation count [2,8],
because impact factor is seen as a reliable guide to the performance of a journal within a particular field. Nevertheless, impact factor is a poorer measure of quality of the
individual article compared to the citation count because
most articles receive fewer citations per year than the
impact factor of the journal they appear in [8,9], and there
is usually a gap between a mean value and values contributing to that mean, so impact factor is always a crude
replacement for the citation count of the individual article. Furthermore, a substantial amount of science can be
published in several fields, and where the impact factor
differs substantially between those fields, the impact factor by itself will not be a reliable indicator of the relative
quality of two journals.
Although impact factor is a poorer predictor of quality of
the individual article than citation count, impact factor,
like any other index, has the advantage over citation count
because one has to wait a few years for the overall citation
count of an article to accumulate, and in the mean time it
would be useful to know whether the journal has a reputation for quality. This is the advantage of an index, but
indices should be comparable across fields. Although, the
impact factor of the journal should not be used to compare journals in different fields [9], this need for comparability between fields has arisen through the setting of
universal thresholds for acceptable impact factors for journals. This will clearly favour some fields, and may distort
the editorial policies of some journals.
As one approach to a more universal or unbiased
approach to ranking journals, I examined the h-index and
journal size to derive a strike rate index for ranking journal
quality. The h-index has recently been proposed [1,10] as
an alternative method for the ranking of the output of a
scientist, and is defined as the lowest rank of an article that
has the same or more citations as its rank irrespective of
what it is or where it is published. The characteristics of
the h-index have been examined in depth [11,12] and it
has been proposed as an index for journals [6,7]. However, journals vary greatly in size, so to apply it to journals
one would need to take into account the very large differences that occur between publications, from quarterlies

http://www.bio-diglib.com/content/4/1/3

with irregular deadlines to weeklies with more than a
dozen articles per issue. Publication sizes can range over 4
orders of magnitude; the h-index was formulated for scientists where productivity has a range of an order of magnitude and so differences in productivity may therefore be
ignored in that context. Therefore a raw h-index could be
expected to favour publications with a greater volume of
articles and should be normalised in some way if it is to
be used in a universal measure of journal quality. The
characteristics of a strike rate index based on journal size
and the h-index of the journal were examined, and it was
applied to the citation counts in a narrow field of genetics
to determine whether it was a better predictor of quality
than impact factor.

Methods
To calculate the h-index the articles to be compared are
ranked in descending order of number of citations and h
is the lowest rank for which an item has the same or more
citations as its rank. An h = 100 means that there are 100
articles with 100 or more citations – if the 100th ranked
item has 105 citations but the 101st has fewer than 101
citations then h = 100. All journals in Agriculture (AG),
Condensed Matter Physics (CMP), Genetics and Heredity
(GH) and Mathematical Physics (MP) were considered.
These fields were chosen since they provide a four-way
comparison, i.e., a field with low citations to that with
high citations, and biological sciences compared to physical sciences. To obtain the h-index for a journal, the citation count for all its articles were obtained from ISI Web
of Science in June 2006 for the period 1986 – 2006. The
journal name was inserted into the General Search tool,
which then returned all the articles for that journal. These
were then sorted by number of citations and the h-index
obtained by inspection. The search tool also gives the total
number of items returned by the search, which is N. Journals sometimes change names, and all name changes were
followed up and the new and old were combined
together.
After analysis of the distribution of h vs N for these journals, the strike rate index (SRI) was formulated as 10logh/
logN – multiplying by 10 gives an index between 0 and
10. The SRI need not be calculated on a 20 year time scale,
it can be calculated for any arbitrary period, and rolling
estimates may be a useful tool to evaluate changes in SRI;
however, the shorter the period the more likely it is that
the SRI will be biased towards articles of immediate attractiveness, and a shorter period would be expected to
change any empirical thresholds for quality.
In this study, the citation count (CC) of articles in a narrow discipline are compared to the IF and SRI of the journals they appeared in. To make the comparisons accurate,

were examined. This was done to ensure that differences
would be due to the qualities of the individual papers and
the journals they occurred in rather than to any differences in popularity of the subject matter. Cattle QTL can
be published in multidisciplinary (MD), GH and AG journals, which have very different impact factors (IF) [8].
The citations for Cattle QTL studies were counted in April
2006 using ISI Web of Science. Journals were classified as
in the Journal Citation Reports into AG, GH or MD. For
those journals that were listed under AG and GH, they
were treated as GH. All citations were counted for articles
published in 2003 and 2004, these years were chosen
because that is what the 2005 impact factors would have
been based on. Mean numbers of citations were compared
using a one way analysis of variance with the P value
obtained using 10000 permutations. Regressions were
performed using the R statistical package [13]. Standard
linear regressions of CC on IF or SRI were performed in a
preliminary analysis. Due to the presence of at least one
outlier – the outliers were different comparing SRI to CC
and IF to CC – as determined using Cook's Distance [14]
and the plot of the residuals against the quantiles of the
standard normal, robust regressions were performed
using the rlm tool of the MASS package in R [15] instead
of removing the outliers. As CC, SRI and IF cannot have
negative values, the intercept was constrained to be greater
than or equal to zero.
To get a snapshot of citation in human genetics and cnidarian phylogeny, the two phrases were inserted into the
TOPIC tool of the General Search of the ISI Web of Science
on 16 March 2007. All articles were retrieved and then
ranked by CC. The highest cited article that was actually
about human genetics or addressed cnidarian phylogeny
was determined. For human genetics this was the most
cited article in the list, but for cnidarian phylogeny, this
was the second most cited article, the first was about C.
elegans molecular biology that happened to have the
words cnidarian and phylogeny in the abstract.

Results
The h-index and N the total citable items were calculated
for the 161 AG, 60 CMP, 124 GH, and 38 MP journals.
The h-index and N show a linear relationship in a double
logarithm plot (Figure 1), that is, the more a journal publishes the more likely it is to have highly cited works and
a high h-index. The slope of this relationship was 0.57 and
the R2 was 55%. Journals from the four different fields
cannot be separated into clusters in this plot. Journals
with a high h-index for their size represent those with a
higher than average track record for publishing articles
that are well cited.

slope of 0.57.

To illustrate the relationship between h-index, IF and N,
the maximum h-indices for a GH and an AG journal were
295 and 100 respectively, with many AG journals having
a higher h-index than GH journals – only 17 of the 124
GH journals had h ≥ 100. Moreover, when an AG journal
was matched to its nearest GH journal for both h and N,
the GH journal had a higher impact factor. For example,
the pair of the Australian Journal of Agricultural Research
and Animal Genetics had almost identical h and N (44 &
2549 compared to 44 & 2429) but the IF were 0.993 and
2.437 respectively.
To determine if there were any features of the SRI that
might be common to all fields, the SRI for journals from
all fields were ranked on one scale from 1 to 383 and plotted in ascending order (Figure 2). When all the journals
are plotted on the one axis (Figure 2 combined) it is obvious that the graph has flat shoulders, or a bend at SRI ~ 4
and at SRI ~ 6, with most journals having an SRI between
3.0 and 7.0. Because this is a graph of ranks, it means that
there are relatively few journals with SRI < 4 or SRI > 6. To
determine whether the form of the graph was the same in
all 4 fields, the SRI of each journal was separated into its
field but was still plotted against its overall rank across all
fields (Figures 2 Agriculture – Genetics). This allows the
relative position of each journal to be seen clearly both
within and across fields, as well as any consistent differences between fields. In all fields, most journals occurred
between SRI ~ 4 and SRI ~ 6. A similar shape of the graph
is seen in each field, although smaller fields show sparser
plots. GH seems to have slightly more journals with SRI
between 5 and 6, as can be seen in the density of the

Genetics graph compared to the others. In contrast to the
similarity between maximum and minimum SRI values in
the different fields, the maximum IF in AG, CMP, GH and
MP was 3.063, 17.857, 25.797 and 3.584 respectively.
The four fields showed similar median values for SRI but
not similar medians for IF. Journals for AG, CMP, GH and
MP showed medians of 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 4.5 respectively.
This compares to median impact factors for these fields of
0.57, 0.97, 2.68 and 1.10 [8], a five fold range. There were
more AG journals below 4, although the highest percentage was in MP (34%), and more GH journals above 6,
although the two highest journals were review journals in
CMP.
Most of the journals with SRI ≥ 6.0 were review journals
(14 out of 20), most of which were in GH (n = 8). Most of
the journals with SRI ≤ 4.0 were regional or published
infrequently. Agriculture has, understandably, more
regional journals than the other fields in both absolute
numbers (41/161) and in percent, and has the largest

number but not percent of journals with SRI below 4 –
one should not generalise here since some of the best AG
journals also have a country name in their title.
The SRI is not particularly biased against young journals
in fast growing fields. Genome Biology, an Open, web based
journal, is a case in point, 2005 is the first year it received
an IF (9.712) and it has an SRI already of 5.34. While this
is not yet up to that of Genome Research (IF 10.139, SRI
6.05), the journal is now in its 8th volume. BMC Genomics
is the highest of the other Open GH journals, with IF
4.092 and SRI 4.75, which compares to Genomics with IF
3.181 and SRI 5.45. While BMC Genomics has the higher
impact factor it does not yet have the track record of
Genomics of publishing highly cited articles.
Once the SRI is above approximately 4.5, the IF shows little relationship to the SRI (Figure 3) or the record of the
journal for publishing highly cited work. Journals with
very similar SRI will show markedly different IF. Journals
in GH or CMP with very high IF did not show correspond-

while the median impact factors were 5 times larger in
some comparisons. Secondly, extreme values were similar
in the different fields, with most fields showing few journals below 4 or above 6; the highest impact factor in a
field differs by 8 fold over the same fields, from IF = 3.063
to IF = 25.797. An SRI = 4.0 could be a lower limit for
quality while that of SRI = 6.0 would correspond to
extremely high quality or to review journals, the latter of
which usually attract large numbers of citations. Indeed, it
is of interest to see the strike rate index pick out review
journals as a group. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that these thresholds are empirical and are based on
a strike rate index calculated over 20 years. Shortening the
number of years in the index would be expected to shift
these thresholds. Thirdly, a linear double log relationship
means that increases in the strike rate index should represent a linear quality scale.

ingly higher SRI either to other journals in GH or CMP
respectively, or to journals in AG or MP. Apart from those
journals with high IF in these two fields, the plot of SRI by
IF shows no differentiation between fields.
SRI explained a greater percentage of the variance in CC in
cattle QTL studies than IF and, unlike IF, showed a significant slope of increasing CC with increasing SRI. There
were a total of 375 citations to cattle QTL studies for 58
articles published in 2003 and 2004. The plot of CC versus IF is shown in Figure 4a. The slope of the robust regression of CC on IF was 0.34 (s.e. 0.30, t = 1.13 n.s.), and the
model explained a non-significant 1.7% of the variance.
Of these articles, 37 had between 0 and 5 citations and of
these, eight had 0 or 1 citations. When grouped into journal type, the mean CC were significantly different. For
citations for cattle QTL work published in 2003 and 2004,
the mean CC for AG was 7.67 (N = 27, s.e.m. = 1.42), for
GH was 4.79 (N = 28, s.e.m. = 0.99) and for MD was
11.33 (N = 3, s.e.m. = 4.26). These differences are significant with F = 2.3, P < 0.05. The CC for cattle QTL papers
showed a strong trend when plotted against SRI (Figure
4b). The slope of the robust regression of CC on SRI was
1.09 (s.e. 0.12, t = 8.80 P < 0.001) and the model
explained a significant 6.9% of the variance (P < 0.05).
The SRI explained at least 4 times as much of the variation
in CC compared to the nominal variation explained by IF.

Discussion
The strike rate index showed some useful characteristics
for a metric of journal quality that can be applied in any
field of study. Firstly, the median values of the strike rate
index of the fields tested in this study are very similar,

The slope of the relationship between h-index and journal
size shows that a journal should not increase its size just
to increase the h-index, because the slope is less than 1.
This means that the h-index does not increase as fast as the
journal size, making it more difficult for extremely large
journals to have a strike rate above 6, unless their editorial
policies are highly selective. One example of a highly
selective large journal is Science, with an SRI = 6.01. Journals may be better off improving quality first before
increasing their size. Indeed, it appears that a journal
should not be too young, too thin or hide itself away, but
it should be fussy.
Not surprisingly, there were journals from Agriculture
with low impact factor that contained articles with higher
citation counts than journals from Genetics and Heredity
with several times higher impact factor, although once the
strike rate index was used, the citation counts were
explainable, since these were well cited articles that
appeared in highly ranked Agricultural journals such as
the Journal of Dairy Science and the Journal of Animal Science. The strike rate index appeared to be more responsive
to the rank or reputation of the journal in the field, which
is often determined by the record of the journal in publishing highly cited articles.
The strike rate index and impact factor together provide a
complementary analysis. High impact factors indicate
journals that publish results that are highly relevant to a
wide audience, at least in the short term, and may indicate
those journals that do not publish work the editor thinks
will be uncited in the first 2–3 years. The strike rate index
identifies journals that maintain standards of content over
the long term, irrespective of how those works may at first
perform. A journal with a low impact factor but a high
strike rate index would be one that put quality over immediate attractiveness, or was in a small field. One that had

a high impact factor but an average strike rate index would
be a journal that published work of immediate attractiveness but not long-term importance, or one that had an
uneven or inconsistent policy of accepting manuscripts,
or, perhaps, one that was a second tier journal in a very
active field.

CC Citation Counts or number of citations an article
receives over its lifetime

The strike rate index appears to identify journals that are
superior in their field and to allow different fields to be
compared without recourse to additional data. A good
way to select journals is to rank them within a narrow field
on impact factor, then ask how difficult is it to get published in that journal, how respected is the editor and
their staff, who else publishes in that journal, and how
long does it take to get published. All of that is valid, but
once the impact factor is reified into a universal measure
of journal ranking, those other aspects are apt to be forgotten. When organizations or governments set universal
thresholds based on the impact factor, it can be hard for
individual scientists to argue against them. The strike rate
index helps to address the gap in knowledge of the metadata associated with the publishing of science, by looking
at the long term record of a journal in publishing highly
cited material relative to the number of articles published.
