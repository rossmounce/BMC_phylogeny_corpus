information

Conclusion: This study identified distinct proteomic profiles associated with specific growth
points for O. anthropi, while the use of emPAI allowed semi-quantitative analyses of protein
expression. It was possible to reconstruct central metabolic pathways and infer unique functional
and adaptive processes associated with specific growth phases, thereby resulting in a deeper
understanding of the physiology and metabolism of this emerging pathogenic bacterium.

interactions

Results: This first gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS) temporal
proteomic analysis of O. anthropi led to the positive identification of 131 proteins. These were
functionally classified and physiochemically characterized. Utilizing the emPAI protocol to estimate
protein abundance, we assigned molar concentrations to all proteins, and thus were able to identify
19 with significant changes in their expression. Pathway reconstruction led to the identification of
a variety of central metabolic pathways, including nucleotide biosynthesis, fatty acid anabolism,
glycolysis, TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism. In late phase growth we identified a number of
gene products under the control of the oxyR regulon, which is induced in response to oxidative
stress and whose protein products have been linked with pathogen survival in response to host
immunity reactions.

Background: The α-Proteobacteria are capable of interaction with eukaryotic cells, with some
members, such as Ochrobactrum anthropi, capable of acting as human pathogens. O. anthropi has been
the cause of a growing number of hospital-acquired infections; however, little is known about its
growth, physiology and metabolism. We used proteomics to investigate how protein expression of
this organism changes with time during growth.

Background

As with its closest genetically related genus, Brucella, the
genomes of O. intermedium and O. anthropi are composed of
two independent circular chromosomes [28]. Recent work by
Teyssier et al. [29] revealed an exceptionally high level of
genomic diversity within Ochrobactrum species, possibly
reflecting their adaptability to various ecological niches.
Whilst there is currently no publicly available genome
sequence data for any Ochrobactrum species, genome information does exist for 20 α-Proteobacteria species, including
four species of Brucella. The availability of such information
not only offers an excellent model system to study the forces,
mechanisms and rates by which bacterial genomes evolve
[30] but also to carry out functional genomic and proteomic
investigations of these and closely related organisms.

Until 1998, Ochrobactrum anthropi was considered to be
both the sole and type species of the genus Ochrobactrum,
despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity visible
within isolates of the species [4]. Subsequent analysis by
Velasco et al. [5] resulted in the description of O. intermedium as a second species. Two new species, O. grignonense
and O. tritici, were isolated from soil and wheat rhizoplane
systems by Lebuhn et al. [6], and most recently, O. gallinifaecis was isolated from a chicken fecal sample, O. cystisi from
nodules of Cystisus scoparius and O. pseudintermedium
from clinical isolates [7,8].

Beynon [31] identified a number of phases in the proteomic
study of an organism or disease process. In the initial 'identification' phase, scientists are predominantly concerned with
gaining insight into the identities of proteins present within
the system with which they are working. Recently, we
reported such a study of the soluble sub-proteome of O.
anthropi [32]. This allowed the identification of 249 proteins
involved in a variety of essential cellular pathways, including
nucleic acid, amino and fatty acid anabolism and catabolism,
glycolysis, TCA cycle, pyruvate and selenoamino acid metabolism. In addition, we identified a number of potential virulence factors of relevance to both plant and human disease.
This previous study is a valuable reference point for the proteome of this emerging pathogen. These types of 'identification' studies, whilst useful, tell us very little about the
functional role of these proteins within cellular networks.
Further developmental phases were described by Beynon
[31], including 'characterization' proteomics, and finally
'quantitative' proteomics in which the emphasis is on the
pair-wise comparison of two proteomes and the quantifying
of specific proteins present. To develop further our understanding of O. anthropi we have performed a comparative
and semiquantitative proteomic analysis to identify the temporal changes in expression and abundance of proteins during growth of this organism. The soluble sub-proteome of O.
anthropi grown aerobically in nutrient broth was compared
at early phase and late phase growth, with 19 proteins having
significant changes in their observed expression. Pathway
reconstruction analysis was carried out and led to the identification of a variety of core metabolic processes, thus giving
insights into the underlying physiology and biochemistry of
this organism. During the late phase of growth of O.anthropi
a number of gene products normally induced in response to
oxidative stress were identified. These expressed gene products, part of the OxyR regulon, have been linked with pathogen survival in the host environment.

The α-Proteobacteria are a biologically diverse group with
many members capable of interaction with eukaryotic cells
and able to function as intracellular symbionts or as pathogens of plants and animals. Some members are important
human pathogens, some can establish asymptomatic chronic
animal infections, and others are agriculturally important,
assisting plants with nitrogen fixation [1]. The α-2 subgroup
of the Proteobacteria contain the well-known genera Rhizobacteria, Agrobacterium, Rickettsia, Bartonella and Brucella, which include species of widespread medical and
agricultural importance [2]. A less well known member of this
group is the genus Ochrobactrum, which is genetically most
closely related to the genus Brucella [3].

Ochrobactrum species have been described as being environmentally abundant free-living α-Proteobacteria. A number of
reports exist in the literature describing the use of Ochrobactrum species as either a source of biotechnologically useful
enzymes [9-11] or in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds such as halobenzoates [12-16]. The ability of Ochrobactrum species to act as legume endosymbionts in
temperate genera such as Lupinus, Musa and Acacia has also
recently been demonstrated [17-19].
O. anthropi has been identified in clinical samples [20] and
has been the cause of a growing number of hospital-acquired
infections usually, but not always, in immunocompromised
hosts [21-25]. The organism has been found to adhere, possibly as a result of biofilm formation, to the surface of catheters,
pacemakers, intraocular lenses and silicon tubing, thus representing potential sources of infection in the clinical environment [26,27]. Upon infection, O. anthropi has been shown to
cause pancreatic abscess, catheter-related bacteremia, endophthalmitis, urinary tract infection and endocarditis [21]. O.
anthropi strains usually are resistant to all β-lactams, with
the exception of the antibiotic imipenem. Nadjar and coworkers [20] demonstrated that in at least one isolate, such
resistance was due to an extended spectrum β-lactamase.
Other than imipenem, the most effective antimicrobial agents
for treating human infection that have thus far been reported
are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin
[23,24].

Proteomic analysis of the origin of the identified proteins in
this study supports previous genomic studies showing that,
phylogentically, the genus Ochrobactrum is most closely
related to Brucella, with 93.9% of the proteins identified having closest match to this genus. The remaining proteins were
matched to other members of the α-2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria (Rhizobacteria (3.8%), Bartonella (1.5%) and Agrobacterium (0.8%)).
Of the 131 proteins detected in this study, functional roles for
125 proteins (95.4%) were known or could be predicted from
database analysis. Proteins within this soluble sub-proteome
were assigned to functional categories utilizing methodologies as previously described by Takami et al. [38] and Wasinger et al. [39]. Figure 2 shows that proteins of the largest
category of identified proteins under both growth conditions

Proteins identified within the two growth conditions were
quantified using the Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) and can be seen in Table 1 (for those
proteins unique to early phase growth), Table 2 (for those
proteins common to both growth conditions) and Table 3 (for
those proteins unique to late phase growth) [37]. This method
allows the quantification of individual identified proteins by
utilizing database and Mascot output information, in order to
give an emPAI value. The emPAI value can then be used to
estimate the protein content within the sample mixture in
molar fraction percentages. In addition, the fold change in
expression level of proteins identified under both growth conditions can be estimated, thus giving further insights into cellular processes. The most abundant protein as calculated by
molar fraction percentages under both conditions was the
30S ribosomal protein S1 (Table 2). The least abundant protein under early growth conditions was 30S ribosomal protein S17 (Table 1) and under late phase growth conditions was
Valyl-tRNA synthetase (Table 3).

Within the protein subset identified from the soluble subproteome, 34 proteins were uniquely identified in the early
phase of growth, 55 proteins were found under both growth
conditions and 40 were found to be unique to the later growth
phase. The identified proteins had a wide range of physiochemical properties in respect to pI and molecular mass (Mr)
(Figure 1). This two-dimensional visualization showed that
the smallest protein identified in early growth was the 30S
ribosomal protein S17 (Mr = 9,123 Da) whilst at the late
growth condition it was the cold shock protein CSPA (Mr =
8,963 Da). The largest protein identified under both conditions was DNA directed RNA polymerase beta chain (Mr =
153,688 Da). The most acidic protein identified under both
conditions was the 30S ribosomal protein S1 (pI = 4.28) while
the most basic in the early growth condition was the 30S
ribosomal protein S5 (pI = 10.49) and in the late growth condition was the 30S ribosomal protein S20 (pI = 11.63).

reports

As previously reported, [35] due to the complex nature of the
peptide mixtures to be analyzed, the separation capabilities of
the liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)
systems are often exceeded. In this study all peptide fractions
were analyzed three separate times in order to increase overall peptide identifications. In the current study, automated
curation of our initial dataset by the heuristic bioinformatic
tool PROVALT [36], along with manual curation, led to the
positive identification of 89 proteins at early phase and 95
proteins at late phase growth.

Characterisation of the O. anthropi soluble subproteome at early and late phase growth

reviews

In this study we report the first gel based comparative proteomic analysis of the α-Proteobacterium O. anthropi at two
distinct phases of growth. This multidimensional analysis
involved the soluble sub-proteome being first separated by
one-dimensional PAGE. The resultant gel was then cut into
nine fractions based on the SeeBlue™ Plus 2 molecular mass
markers. Each gel fraction was then trypsinized and the
extracted peptides separated on a reversed phase C18 column
over a 60 minute time period prior to being introduced onto
the mass spectrometer. This methodology allowed the identification of a total of 131 proteins from the soluble sub-proteome under the two growth phases. This expressed gene
product subset represents an estimated 3% of the total O.
anthropi proteome, employing data based upon the typical
predicted genome size [29]. No data are currently available in
the literature on the expected distribution of proteins within
sub-proteomic fractions of O. anthropi. As a benchmark,
however, a study concentrating mainly on the analysis of the
cytosolic proteins of Brucella melitensis 16M, a phylogenetically closely related organism, identified 187 proteins equating to 6% of its predicted proteome [33,34].

one to have proteins present from the Adaptation to atypical

the Metabolism of nucleotides category, by the anaplerotic

could also have been classified within the Metabolism of
amino acids category.

esses; however, there are still a significant number of potential gene products for which we know nothing, save that they
are classified as 'hypothetical proteins'. Indeed, within the
genome sequence of B. melitensis strain 16M, the closest relative phylogenetically of O. anthropi for which genomic data
are available, some 716 predicted gene products, equivalent to
22% of the total genome, are predicted to be either hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function. In previous
work we have underlined the necessity to assign, where possible, an element of biological functionality to such gene
products in order to develop both systems biology and our
understanding of cellular processes within these organisms.
Within the current study we have established the presence of
six proteins that had previously been annotated as hypothetical conserved proteins. The identification of such proteins
within the cell-extract of O. anthropi establishes the biological functionality of these 'hypothetical' predicted protein coding sequences, and once more elegantly demonstrates the

potential of

bioinformatics

Having established the presence of such proteins and wishing
to understand how they contribute to functional processes,
we further examined them using NCBI BLASTp [40]. Such an
approach allows conserved domains within protein
sequences to be identified and thereby enables a degree of
inferred functionality. Using this methodology, however,
allowed us to assign putative function to only one of these
proteins, NCBI:23463995. The search identified two conserved domains, pfam 01480, GFO_IDH_MocA; Oxidoreductase family involved in utilization of NADP or NAD and
COG 1748; Saccharopine dehydrogenase and related proteins
involved in amino acid transport and metabolism.

PSortB [41,42], SignalP [43,44] and SecretomeP [45,46] were
utilized. These bioinformatics tools endeavor to assign a subcellular location for each protein. These tools use a set of
descriptor rules and a variety of computational algorithms
and networks to analyze a protein's amino acid composition
in an attempt to identify known motifs or cleavage sites. The

information

Utilizing the emPAI calculation for measuring protein abundance within our proteomic investigation allowed us to use
the molar fraction percentage values for proteins common to
both growth conditions; this enabled us to compare the fold
change in protein expression that occurs under the two
different conditions [37,49,50]. Two ranges are generally
used in comparative proteomics to ascertain if the fold change
in expression is significant. In the isobaric labeling technology iTRAQ™, a ≥20% change is considered significant and
sufficient to take account of systematic errors; therefore, fold
changes of ≥1.2 or ≤0.8 are significant, with a fold change

had the required architecture that would allow them to be
assigned to the Sec pathway (NCBI:17982453, 17984491,
17982015, 17982340, 17982154, 17983192 and 86283673).
The remainder of the proteins, whilst containing the correct
cleavage site for a signal peptide, did not, in fact, have the full
amino-terminal architecture that would be required to allow
us to classify them as secreted proteins [47,48]. This once
again highlights the limitations of some of the present generation of bioinformatic tools, which presently are concentrated
largely on motif-based predictors. This aptly demonstrates
the absolute necessity of manual interpretation of results in
order to gain any level of biological significance.

value of 1 representing no difference in protein levels between
the two states [51,52]. In the comparative two-dimensional
PAGE technologies, a ≥50% change is considered significant
and sufficient to take account of systematic errors; therefore,
fold changes of ≥1.5 or ≤0.5 are significant, again with a fold
change value of 1 representing no difference in protein levels
between the two states [53,54]. The fold change in protein
expression between proteins from the two growth conditions
can be seen in Table 2. Taking the ≥20% cut-off value, 44
proteins significantly changed in expression; at the ≥50% cutoff value this is reduced to 19 proteins that significantly
changed in expression between the two growth conditions.
Utilizing the more stringent ≥50% value as a measure of differential protein expression, it can be seen that 11 proteins
have much higher expression levels in the early growth condition and 6 have higher expression levels in the later growth
condition (Figure 6).
Using the available genome sequence of B. melitensis 16M,
the closest relative of O. anthropi, and assuming a high
degree of synteny between the genomes of these organisms,
we investigated the genomic context of each gene found to be
differentially expressed in this study. In this manner, we
hoped that predicted transcriptional units for these proteins
would be identified, thus elevating our functional understanding of the processes occurring within the organism.
Of the 30S ribosomal proteins identified as differentially
expressed, all were predicted to be transcribed independently
[55], and four (30S ribosomal proteins S3, S5, S7 and S17)

were found within the same region of the B. melitensis 16M
genome. The reported differential expression of ribosomal
proteins is not unusual in proteomics investigations; however, little information is available as to why certain component proteins of the 30S ribosome should be present at
different levels. Of the remaining 12 proteins that were differentially expressed, the available in silico evidence suggests
they are independently transcribed within the B. melitensis
16M genome [55].

Pathway identification
Previously, Djordjevic et al. [56] reported the necessity to
identify within a proteomic study three enzymes present in a
particular biochemical pathway in order to definitively state
that such a pathway is present and active within the system
under study. Ergo, in conjunction with the pathway reconstruction tool BioCyc [57], we have been able to identify the
following pathways: superpathway of glycolysis, pyruvate
dehydrogenase and TCA cycle (10 proteins) (Additional data
file 1); superpathway of glyoxylate cycle (3 proteins)
(Additional data file 1); fatty acid elongation (4 proteins)
(Additional data file 2); de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (9 proteins) (Additional data file 3); arginine biosynthesis
(3 proteins). Lying outside of our stringent rules for pathway
identification but nonetheless worthy of note are two additional short pathways for which two out of four proteins (nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway) and two
out of three proteins (phenylalanine biosynthesis II) were
identified in the current study.

evidence for the activation of gluconeogenesis was found as a
likely result of nutrient depletion, with expression of malate

phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase and pyruvate
phosphate dikinase, essential for the production of PEP from
oxaloacetate and pyruvate, respectively, detectable for the
first time. It is of note that this pathway is considered to be
important for the establishment of host infection by certain
bacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis and Xanthomonas
campestris [60,61]. Similarly, the presence of serine
hydroxymethyltransferase, which converts glycine to L-serine prior to its potential conversion to pyruvate, was found
only in late phase growth. Intriguingly, the enzymes involved

refereed research

At both time points it is clear, as would be expected, that central metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle and fatty acid
biosynthesis are active in O. anthropi. In addition, two key
enzymes involved in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase and transaldolase, are also found. These
enzymes are essential in the recycling of excess pentose
phosphate, formed when there is high demand on NADPH2dependent biosynthetic pathways. In addition, this pathway
also provides intermediates for nucleotide biosynthesis, and
indeed nucleotide biosynthetic pathways are also apparently
active, as might be expected, at both sampling points [58]. In
early phase growth, enzymes necessary for peptidoglycan and
lipid A biosynthesis were specifically detected, presumably
due to the high demand for new cell wall and outer membrane
layer components at this growth point [59]. Whilst the
enzymes essential for ribonucleotide biogenesis were present
at both conditions, only in early phase growth was nucleoside

lalanine were also unique to late phase growth. Whilst this
may reflect a cellular demand for these amino acids, it is of
note that the co-product of arginine synthesis is fumarate,
which has the dual role of being an intermediate in both the
TCA cycle as well as in gluconeogensis.

grxA, gorA and hence other genes of the OxyR regulon (Figure 7). Glutathione is an essential element in the regulatory
cycle of oxyR, which may explain the presence of N-methylhydantoinase in late phase growth, as it is an integral part of the
γ-Glutamyl pathway, which is responsible for the generation
of glutathione from 5-oxoproline. During oxidative stress
thioredoxin is produced and in its reduced form it acts as an
acceptor of oxygen radicals generated as a result of the catalytic activity of thiol peroxidase on H2O2, thus scavenging and
detoxifying the damaging oxygen radicals and concomitantly
forming H2O and thioredoxin disulphide [69]. Thioredoxins
may also be involved in a cascade that triggers the transcription of other detoxifying genes, as they have also been shown
to interact with DNA gyrase and thus influence a multitude of
transcriptional responses in the cell by increasing or decreasing DNA supercoiling. This strongly suggests that the gyrasemediated effect of thioredoxins on gene expression is a common redox-dependent signaling pathway in bacterial
adaptation [70]. Intriguingly, AhpC has also been found to be
an important conserved bacterial allergen that interacts with
mammalian Toll-like receptors, specifically the MyD88 protein, thus activating innate and adaptive immune responses
within the host [71].

One additional feature of late phase growth is the presence of
a number of stress response proteins, particularly those of
importance in oxidative stress resistance. The proteins
thioredoxin (TrxC), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC)
and thiol peroxidase have been reported to be important for
the survival of pathogenic bacteria within a host organism
[62,63]. Indeed, these proteins have also been detected in
both transcriptomic and proteomic studies investigating the
role of oxidative stress in a number of important pathogenic
organisms that include Escherichia coli, Candida albicans
and Porphyromonas gingivalis [64-68]. The TrxC and AhpC
genes are subject to control by the oxyR regulon, which is
induced in response to oxidative stress resulting from hydrogen peroxide and other free oxygen radicals. During this process, the regulatory protein oxyR becomes oxidized by these
reactive oxygen species to form an intramolecular disulphide
bond, thus allowing the activation of expression from trxC,

reports

In this study we were able to identify distinct proteomic profiles associated with specific growth points for the emerging
nosocomial pathogen O. anthropi. For those proteins common to both growth phases, the use of emPAI allowed a semiquantitative analysis of protein expression to be made and it
was possible to reconstruct core metabolic pathways functioning within this organism. It was also possible to infer
unique functional and adaptive processes associated with
specific growth phases and, therefore, gain a much deeper
understanding of the physiology and metabolism of this pathogenic bacterium. Of particular interest was the identification
of a number of protein products involved in oxidative stress
response that are known to be regulated as part of the oxyR
regulon and have previously been shown to be key in pathogen survival within host environments.

reviews

O. anthropi cultures were harvested under two separate
growth conditions, at early phase (D600 = 0.3) and at late
phase (D600 = 1.2) growth, by centrifugation at 9000 × g for
10 minutes at 3-5°C. The cell pellet was weighed and resuspended in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8) at a
ratio of 1 g cells to 2 ml buffer. The cells were then broken
using sonication as described previously by Graham et al.
[32]. The soluble proteome fraction was isolated by centrifugation of the homogenate at 25,000 × g for 30 minutes at 35°C (Beckman J2-HS, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA,
USA) followed by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 2
hours at 3-5°C (Beckman L8-M, Beckman Instruments) to
sediment the insoluble fraction. The supernatant was
decanted and stored frozen in 1 ml aliquots at -70°C until
required. The total soluble protein content was measured
using the Bradford assay [72].

comment

The popularity of 'identification' proteomics is evident from
the abundant studies reported in the literature, and their
contribution to our understanding of the diversity of protein
expression in cells and organisms has been immense;
however, these studies have clear limitations with regard to
the amount of insight they can give on the function of a system. The trend within the proteomics community has, therefore, moved from this cataloguing approach towards the
development of comparative and quantitative analyses that,
as outlined in the present study, give greater insights into the
functional processes occurring. Combining both of these
techniques with rigorous data curation and interpretation,
coupled with the vast array of bioinformatics tools available
to the life scientist is the only way to ensure that these processes are accurately described such that meaningful data can
be provided for the wider scientific community.

Netherlands). A μ-Precolumn™ Cartridge (300 μm × 5 mm, 5
μm particle size) was placed prior to the C18 capillary column
(75 μm × 150 mm, 3 μm particle size) to enable desalting and
filtering. Both columns contained the reversed phase material
PepMAP™ 100 (C18 silica-based) with a 100Å pore size
(Dionex/LC Packings). The elution buffers used in the gradient were Buffer A (0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile) and
Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile). The nanoLC
gradient used was 60 minutes in length: 0-55% B in 45 minutes, 10 minutes at 90% B followed by 5 minutes at 100% A.
The flow rate of the gradient was 300 nlmin-1. The detector
mass range was set at 400-1,800 m/z. MS data acquisition
was performed in positive ion mode. During MS acquisition,
peptides with 2+ and 3+ charge states were selected for
fragmentation.

Database searching, protein identification and
PROVALT analysis
Protein identification was carried out using an internal MASCOT server (version 1.9; Matrix Science, London, UK) searching against the bacteria sub-set of the MSDB database (latest
version at the time of processing). Peptide tolerance was set
at ± 1.2 Da with MS/MS tolerance set at ± 0.6 Da and the
search set to allow for one missed cleavage. In order to expedite the curation of the identified protein list from MASCOT,
the result files were re-analyzed against an extracted database
comprising eleven α-proteobacterial genome databases
downloaded from NCBI using the heuristic method known as
the protein validation tool PROVALT [36]. This automated
program takes large proteomic MS datasets and reorganizes
them by taking multiple MASCOT results and identifying
those peptides that match. Redundant peptides are removed
and related peptides are grouped together associated with
their predicted matching protein; thus, the program dramatically reduces this portion of the curation process. For identification purposes the minimum peptide length was set at 6
amino acids, the minimum peptide MOWSE score was set at
25 and the minimum high quality peptide MOWSE score was
set at 40. PROVALT also uses peptide matches from a random database (in this case the extracted α-proteobacterial
database was randomized) to calculate false-discovery rates
(FDRs) for protein identifications as previously described by
Weatherley et al. [36]. Briefly, identifications from searching
the normal and random databases are used to calculate the
FDRs and set score thresholds and thus identify as many
'actual' proteins as possible while encountering a minimal
number of false-positive protein identifications. Rather than
calculate error rates at the peptide level, the FDR calculations
employed by PROVALT provide a reasonable balance
between the number of correct and incorrect protein assignments. In this study the FDR was set at 1%, meaning that 99%
of the reported proteins identified should be correct.

quantification of individual identified proteins by utilizing
database and Mascot output information, in order to give an
emPAI value. The emPAI value can then be used to estimate
the protein content within the sample mixture in molar fraction percentages. Also, the fold change in expression levels of
proteins identified under both growth conditions can be estimated, allowing further insights into cellular processes.

Pathway reconstruction
Pathways were reconstructed utilizing the BioCyc database
[57], a collection of 160 pathway/genome databases for most
eukaryotic and prokaryotic species whose genomes have been
completely sequenced. The BioCyc collection provides a
unique resource for computational systems biology by enabling global and comparative analyses of genomes and metabolic networks. Identified proteins can be entered into the
database and searched against specific species, thus allowing
scientists to visualize combinations of gene expression maps
of these organisms and thus reconstruct pathways that are
present.

Bioinformatics
PSORTb version 2.0.4 [41,42] was used for the prediction of
bacterial protein subcellular localization. SignalP 3.0 [43,44]
was used to predict the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences, for classically
secreted proteins. SecretomeP 2.0 [45,46] was used for the
prediction of non-classical protein secretion (that is, protein
secretion that is not triggered by signal peptides).
