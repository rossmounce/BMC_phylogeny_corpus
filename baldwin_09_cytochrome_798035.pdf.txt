Abstract
Background: Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in animals fall into two categories: those that synthesize
or metabolize endogenous molecules and those that interact with exogenous chemicals from the
diet or the environment. The latter form a critical component of detoxification systems.
Results: Data mining and manual curation of the Daphnia pulex genome identified 75 functional
CYP genes, and three CYP pseudogenes. These CYPs belong to 4 clans, 13 families, and 19
subfamilies. The CYP 2, 3, 4, and mitochondrial clans are the same four clans found in other
sequenced protostome genomes. Comparison of the CYPs from D. pulex to the CYPs from insects,
vertebrates and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) show that the CYP2 clan, and to a lesser
degree, the CYP4 clan has expanded in Daphnia pulex, whereas the CYP3 clan has expanded in
insects. However, the expansion of the Daphnia CYP2 clan is not as great as the expansion
observed in deuterostomes and the nematode C. elegans. Mapping of CYP tandem repeat regions
demonstrated the unusual expansion of the CYP370 family of the CYP2 clan. The CYP370s are
similar to the CYP15s and CYP303s that occur as solo genes in insects, but the CYP370s constitute
~20% of all the CYP genes in Daphnia pulex. Lastly, our phylogenetic comparisons provide new
insights into the potential origins of otherwise mysterious CYPs such as CYP46 and CYP19
(aromatase).
Conclusion: Overall, the cladoceran, D. pulex has a wide range of CYPs with the same clans as
insects and nematodes, but with distinct changes in the size and composition of each clan.

Background
The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) have widespread and
diverse functions in animals. CYPs in families 1–4 are critical and often inducible components of the phase I detoxification systems of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants
[1-4]. They are also important in lipid metabolism,
including fatty acids, retinoids, eicosanoids, steroids, vitamin D and bile acids, and some are regulated in a sexually
dimorphic fashion through endocrine mechanisms [5-8].

In addition, the CYP26 family contributes to maintenance
of sharp retinoic acid boundaries between rhombomeres
in the developing mammalian embryo and in the eye [911]. In insects CYPs are essential to the function of sensory
organs such as antennae, where they may be involved in
odorant clearance [12].
CYPs are important in the metabolism of and tolerance to
anthropogenic chemicals [13] and plant allelochemicals

[14,15]. Inducibility, constitutive overexpression, and
genomic studies investigating quantitative trait loci (QTL)
mapping have demonstrated tolerance or resistance to
environmental chemicals due to CYPs [13,16,17]. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that pesticide sensitivity in honeybee is associated with reduced CYP numbers
[18]. In addition, hormone structure is dependent on
CYPs [19], and therefore small differences in the hormones utilized (i.e. juvenile hormones, methyl farnesoate) may be dependent on the CYPs available or the
timing of expression.
Daphnia pulex, commonly known as the waterflea, is the
first crustacean to have its genome sequenced. D. pulex has
a genome of approximately 200 Mb with 31,000 genes
http://wfleabase.org. Daphnid species are globally distributed zooplankton, in the order Branchiopoda, suborder
Cladocera, and there are several daphnid species, including Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulicaria, Daphnia pulex, and
Ceriodaphnia dubia. Daphnids are commonly studied zooplankton because of their importance to aquatic ecosystems, ability to contend with environmental challenges,
amenability to culture, short life-cycle, and parthenogenic
reproduction. Furthermore, daphnids are commonly used
in several toxicity tests for multiple applications. Studies
on the Daphnia pulex genome and specifically the CYPs
may provide important insight on how genome and gene
expression alterations promote individual and population-level fitness following environmental change.
It has become clear in the genomic era that previous estimates for the number of CYPs in daphnids such as D.
magna [20] was a gross underestimate, and that most
metazoans have a large number of CYP genes. For example, humans have 57, mice have 102, Stronglyocentrotus
purpuratus (sea urchin) have 120, Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) have 106, and Drosophila melanogaster have 83
functional CYPs (Additional file 1). In continuation of
this P450 research, we are working with the Daphnia
Genomics Consortium to assemble, annotate, and compare the CYPs in the Daphnia pulex genome with several
other species. We have also assigned names to all of the
CYPs and CYP pseudogenes based on previously published rules using phylogenetic trees and amino acid
sequence identity to determine clan, family and subfamily
membership [21]. Clans represent the deepest diverging
gene clades in the CYP nomenclature. There are ten P450
clans among animals, but only four are present in the protostomes: CYP2, CYP3, CYP4 and mitochondrial. The
general web repository for P450 nomenclature and
sequence
data
is
http://drnelson.utmem.edu/
cytochromeP450.html. Overall, this work provides a continuation of earlier projects to comprehensively annotate
CYPs and determine the putative role of Daphnia pulex
CYPs in sensory adaptation, sensitivity to toxicants, adap-

tation to environmental challenges, and as biomarkers of
chemical or endocrine stimulation.

Results and discussion
Manual Annotation
Manual annotation and curation of the CYPs in Daphnia
pulex v1.1 draft genome sequence assembly (September,
2006) produced 73 full length P450s and three pseudogenes. In addition, there are two ESTs in the CYP4 clan
that were not found in the D. pulex genome of the chosen
parthenogenic individual, but partial sequences
(Cyp4C32, Cyp4AN1) were observed previously in specific D. pulex ecotypes [15]. Overall, this number is similar
to other CYP genomes (Additional file 1), but slightly
lower than the typical invertebrate or insect with the
exception of honeybee [22].

The Daphnia pulex full length CYPs are divided into four
distinct clans; mitochondrial, CYP2, CYP3, and CYP4, the
same clans that are found in insects [22]. The four clans
can be further subdivided into 13 families, 19 subfamilies, and 75 putatively functional isoforms, and 3
pseudogenes (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic tree in combination with the previously described rules for naming CYPs
(40% identity for family designation, 55% identity for
subfamily designation) were used to name the different

CYPs in D. pulex [21]. Six new CYP families were discovered; mitochondrial clan families CYP362 and 363, CYP2
clan families CYP364 and 370, and CYP3 clan families
CYP360 and 361 (Fig. 1, 2).
Phylogenetic tree
Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony yielded
nearly identical topologies, so we have presented the tree
in which branch lengths are proportional to the amount
of change occurring in each lineage (Fig. 2). This tree is
also available in a detailed, expandable, readable pdf document as supplementary material (Additional file 2). The
Bayesian tree includes posterior probabilities at nodes
which reflect the proportion of trees sampled during the
search that included each particular node. The sea anemone genome has not been manually curated and therefore
the data are subject to potential assembly errors until validated. However, the sea anemone provides an ancient
anthozoan class cnidarian, and more importantly a
diploblast, to the analysis as the only non-triploblastic
species in our phylogenetic tree. The honeybee and fruitfly
provide a protostome insect CYP genome for comparison,
while the human CYPs provide a deuterostome for comparison to the Branchiopod crustacean, D. pulex.

In general, the tree shows six distinct monophyletic
clades, all but one supported by posterior probabilities of
1.00. These include the mitochondrial, CYP2, CYP3, and
CYP4 clans, and two deep branches that do not include
any arthropod CYPs. The non-arthropod lineages are
nearly deuterostome exclusive and would be if not for the
two anemone CYPs that show their closest relationships
to CYP26. These anemone CYPs found nested within a
vertebrate lineage indicate that a CYP26-like ancestor may
have existed in cnidarians but was lost in protostomes.
Similar inferences concerning CYP loss in protostomes
have already been made about CYP51, CYP20 and possibly CYP7. The history of CYP20 in protostomes may be
complex since an ortholog has been detected in the annelid leech Haementeria depressa (CN807321). In addition,
CYP19 (aromatase) clusters with the CYP2 and mitochondrial clans, and CYP46 and related sea anemone CYPs are
part of a sister clade to the CYP4 clan (Additional file 2).
Overall, the tree demonstrates that the four major clans
found in insects (mitochondrial, CYP2, 3, 4) encompass
all of the CYPs in D. pulex. An Excel table of each of the
CYP genes and pseudogenes found in the Daphnia pulex
genome, their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and
links to their scaffold position is available as supplementary material (Additional file 3).
The mitochondrial clan of D. pulex contains six members
in five families and five subfamilies. Three of the members
are highly conserved Halloween genes involved in ecdys-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/169

one synthesis [19,23]. Specifically, disembodied
(Cyp302A1; dib), shade (Cyp314A1, shd), and shadow
(Cyp315A1; sad) are all mitochondrial CYPs involved in
the last three steps of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) synthesis. Cyp314A1 is the CYP required for the conversion
of ecdysone to its active form, 20-HE [19,23]. The other
three CYPs are divided into two new families CYP362
(Cyp362A1, Cyp362A2) and Cyp363A1, indicating that
these CYPs are not as well conserved and probably have
taken on new roles. A tree of the mitochondrial CYP clan
is available as supplementary material (Additional file 4).
The CYP2 clan of D. pulex contains 21 members, including one pseudogene (not shown in Fig. 2, 3), separated
into five distinct families (Cyp18, 306, 307, 364, 370) and
six subfamilies. Two of the genes, phantom (Cyp306A1;
phm) and spook (Cyp307A1; spo) are conserved Halloween genes involved in the early stages of ecdysone synthesis [19,24]. The exact role of Cyp307A1 in ecdysone
biosynthesis is unknown, but appears to be part of the
"Black box" of reactions involved in the earlier steps of
ecdysone synthesis from cholesterol. Daphnia pulex only
contains one Cyp307 gene similar to sequenced lepidopterans, but different than Drosophila that use two Cyp307
genes at different stages of their lifecycle [24,25]. Interestingly, the Cyp307 genes are a sister group to the nonarthropod CYP2 members (Fig. 3).
The other three CYP2-clan families in D. pulex (Cyp18,
364, 370) are divided into four subfamilies and contain
19 genes. Interestingly, a sister-group in the CYP2 clan
contains no arthropod CYPs. This group primarily contains anemone CYPs, but also contains CYP17, CYP21,
and the CYP1 family members inducible by chlorinated
hydrocarbons in vertebrates [26](Fig. 3; also available as
Additional file 5). The Cyp370 family is the largest of the
CYP2-clan families, containing 15 members with 13
members in the 370A subfamily and 2 members in the
370B subfamily (Cyp370B1,2). There is also one pseudogene in the Cyp370A subfamily, Cyp370A3P.
The Daphnia CYP370 family is greatly expanded relative
to the single gene CYP15 and CYP303 families in insects
it most closely resembles. Cyp15A1 is a regio- and stereospecific epoxidase critical in the formation of juvenile hormone III (JH III) from methyl farnesoate in the corpora
allata of the cockroach [27]. However, methyl farnesoate,
a juvenile hormone precursor, is considered the major terpenoid hormone in crustaceans [28]; therefore, a methyl
farnesoate epoxidase is unnecessary and it is unlikely that
the CYP370A and CYP370B subfamily members specifically perform this function. The role of the Cyp370 family
in Daphnia is currently unknown. Cyp18 and Cyp364 are
both close relatives of Cyp306 (phantom), suggesting
potential involvement in ecdysone synthesis or catabo-

lism (Fig. 3). The Cyp364 family is a new family that contains three genes (Cyp364A1,2,3). Cyp18, which is also
found in insects, is induced by 20-HE in Drosophila [29].
The CYP3 clan consists of numerous CYPs involved in
detoxification of xenobiotics and endobiotics [30-33].
Some CYP3 clan members are inducible by hormones
such as progesterone [34] and ecdysone [17], and are
responsible for the metabolism and elimination of steroid
hormones in vertebrates [20,35,36]. Although the posterior probability at the base of the CYP3 clan is low (0.54),
this only reflects the uncertainly of the position of the first
two Drosophila lineages at the base of the CYP3 clan. The
CYP3 clade is strongly supported when Drosophila is not
included in the analysis (1.00). In Daphnia pulex, the
CYP3 clan contains 12 genes and one pseudogene,
arranged into two new families (Cyp360, Cyp361) and
three subfamilies. Eleven of these thirteen genes are in the
Cyp360A subfamily leaving just Cyp361A1 and
Cyp361B1 outside this subfamily in the Cyp3 clan of D.
pulex. The closest relatives of the Cyp360 subfamily in the
tree are the Cyp6 and Cyp9 subfamily members of insects
involved in endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism and
detoxification. Similarly, the closest relatives of the two
Cyp361 subfamily members are the anemone CYP3-like
group, and the human CYP3A and CYP5A subfamily
members involved in detoxification and thromboxane A2
biosynthesis. In general, the CYP3 clan in insect species
has more CYPs than the Daphnia pulex CYP3 clan. Most
CYP families in insects have only a few members, but the
CYP6AS subfamily has 18 members, 37.5% of the honeybee P450s, and there are 35 members of the CYP3 clan
distributed between seven families making up 42% of the
D. melanogaster P450s. The CYP3 clan in insects, and in
particular the CYP6AS subfamily in honeybee was
recruited for major gene expansion as were the CYP360
and CYP370 families in D. pulex, and to a lesser degree the
CYP4C subfamily. A tree of the CYP3 clan is available as
an additional file (Additional file 6).
The CYP4 clan, which is the sister-group to a clade containing the CYP3 clan plus one of the two "non-arthropod" clans, consists of 38 members all in the same family
(Cyp4) and arranged into five subfamilies (Cyp4C,
Cyp4AN, Cyp4AP, Cyp4BX, Cyp4BY) with 4–10 members
in each subfamily (Additional file 7). There is also a pseudogene in the Cyp4C subfamily. Two members of the
Cyp4 family were not observed in the Daphnia pulex
genome v1.1 draft genome sequence assembly (September, 2006), but were cloned by degenerative PCR in a previous study in which nine CYP4 members were partially
cloned [15]. The two absent CYPs, Cyp4C32 (95% identical to 4C34v1; 89% to 4C34v2 from the Daphnia pulex
genome) and Cyp4AN1 (92% to 4AN2v1; 96% identical
to CYP4AN2v2 from the Daphnia pulex genome), are avail-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/169

able on GenBank (BQ703381 and BQ703379, respectively). The D. pulex genome sequence coverage was 8.7×,
therefore our inability to find these two CYPs may be due
to the known gaps in the genome assembly. It is also possible that these two genes were deleted from the Daphnia
Genomics Consortium's chosen parthenogenic D. pulex or
"chosen one" due to strain differences.
The Cyp4 members are considered the least studied of the
CYP clans in insects [22] and are involved in fatty acid
metabolism, including inflammatory arachidonic acid
metabolites, and xenobiotic metabolism in mammals
[37]. Some CYP4 members may be involved in sensory
perception in insects as they are found in the antenna
[38]. A Cyp4c member is also involved in the biosynthesis
of juvenile hormone, and another is inducible by hypertrehalosemic hormone, a key hormone in arthropod carbohydrate metabolism [39]. Furthermore, some Cyp4
members are down-regulated by ecdysteroids [40], indicating that Cyp4 members may play a key role in sensory
and hormonal functions in D. pulex.
Primarily CYP3, but some CYP4 and mitochondrial clan
members have been associated with resistance to pesticides [17,30,41-44]. Several Cyp3 clan members, such as
Cyp6g1 and Cyp6a5 are associated with DDT or pyrethroid resistance, respectively [41,44]. Cyp4D10 and
other CYP4 members in Drosophila are inducible by plant
alkaloids and may be important in plant host interactions
[45]. In D. pulex, differential expression of two Cyp4 genes
is associated with resistance to tannic acid and leaf litter
[15]. Cyp4C32 expression is much higher in ecotype 1
and Cyp4AP1 shows much higher levels of transcription
in ecotype 2, which is exposed to high amounts of leaf litter and polyphenols, and in turn resistant to toxic leaf litters [15]. Interestingly, the CYPs that show differential
expression based on ecotype and leaf litter exposure, are
the two CYPs that are not found within the D. pulex v1.1
genome sequence assembly. The complete sequence of
these two CYPs is not available [15].
Expansion of the CYP 2 and 4 clans
A comparison of the number of genes in each of the CYP
clans from D. pulex, silkmoth (Bombyx mori), human
(Homo sapiens), pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), honeybee
(Apis mellifera), sea urchin (Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus),
and fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) indicates both subtle
and demonstrative differences in CYP clan numbers
between species (Fig. 4). In general, the protostomes
(fruitfly, honeybee, D. pulex) have significantly fewer
CYP2 clan members than deuterostomes, indicating an
expansion of the CYP2 clan in deuterostomes (Fig. 3). Of
the protostomes investigated, D. pulex has the greatest percentage of CYP2 clan members. The CYP2 clan encompasses approximately 5.5–10% of the total CYPs in most

Comparison of the number of genes in each of the
CYP clans from Daphnia, Honeybee, Sea Urchin,
Fugu (pufferfish), Silkmoth, Drosophila, and Human
genomes. The data was derived from [22,46-49] and manual
curation of the Daphnia pulex genome.

insects with honeybee the exception at 17.4% of its CYPs
in the CYP2 clan [22]. In contrast, D. pulex has 21 CYPs in
the CYP2 clan, nearly double of any sequenced insect (11/
132 in Aedes aegypti), and D. pulex's CYP2 clan members
encompass 26.9% of its CYPs, indicating a significant
expansion of this clan relative to the insects. No other
crustacean has been sequenced, so whether the expansion
of the CYP2 clan is typical of crustaceans is unknown.
The CYP4 clan is also slightly expanded in D. pulex relative
to the insects. There are 38 CYP4 members that encompass 49% of the CYPs in the genome. The CYP4 clan varies
from 8.6–42% of the CYP genome in sequenced insects
[22]. Excluding the honeybee, which only has 4 CYP4
members, the rest of the insect's CYP4 members vary from
30.7–42% of the total CYPs. Relative increases in CYP2
and CYP4 members in D. pulex leaves a relative reduction
in the CYP3 clan compared to insects. Only 16.7% (13/
78) of the members of the D. pulex CYP genome are CYP3
clan members; whereas 38–61% (28–76) of the insect
CYPs are CYP3 clan members.
There are several CYP2-clan members similar in structure
to other ecdysone metabolizers (CYP18, CYP364 members). However, the formation of juvenile hormone III
from methyl farnesoate by CYP15A1 is unnecessary in
crustaceans and D. pulex in turn lacks the CYP15A1 gene.
In addition, D. pulex lacks the CYP303 subfamily members with unknown but putative external sensory development function [5]. Nevertheless, the CYP370 family,

which is phylogenetically related to the CYP15 and
CYP303 families, has expanded dramatically in D. pulex,
and this family lacks a specific enzyme with a known function. Based on our current knowledge of CYPs, the expansion of the CYP370 family is probably necessary for
responses to environmental stressors such as toxicants,
and/or other growth or behavioral stimulators such as
plant alkaloid toxins.
Tandem repeat regions
Tandem duplicates are genes that are within intron distances of each other, nearly identical (95+% identity), and
may harbor some interesting biology. Gene expansion by
tandem duplication is common in P450 evolution but the
basis for recruitment of a founder gene is not understood.
There are several CYP tandem repeat regions in the D.
pulex genome (Fig. 5). Overall, 45 of the 77 (58%) CYP
genes are located within tandem repeats. Twenty-eight of
the 37 (76%) CYP4 family members, including Cyp4C53,
are found in tandem repeat regions, which explain in part
the expansion of the CYP4 clan in D. pulex. In contrast, the
CYP3 clan has 69% (9/13) of its genes found in tandem
repeat regions, including 9/11 of the Cyp360 family
members. However, the CYP3 clan is small relative to the
insect genomes, thus presence in tandem repeats is not
correlated to the size of the clan. Lastly, none of the mitochondrial CYPs, many of which have specific functions in
ecdysone synthesis [19], are members of a tandem repeat
region (Fig. 4). Expansions of conserved endogenous
functions are rare and may be selected against. Conversely, tandem duplications may indicate diversity in
exogenous xenobiotic substrates [3].

The CYP2 clan is highly expanded relative to the insects,
but only 9 of the 21 CYP2 (43%) clan genes are members
of a tandem repeat region. Initially, we thought this indicated that tandem repeat regions had little to do with the
expansion of the CYP2 clan in D. pulex. However, all nine
of the tandemly repeated CYP2 clan members are in the
CYP370 family. It is interesting that the rest of the CYP2
clan members are not found in tandem repeat regions,
and it is tempting to speculate that most D. pulex CYP2
clan members, just as many of the mitochondrial CYPs,
have highly specific functions such as ecdysone biosynthesis. Needs for P450s are often met by expansion via
tandem duplication leading to gene clusters. This suggests
that the CYP370 family expanded while under selective
pressure. Which genes expand may be independent of
clan or family membership and depend on substrate specificity required to cope with a new xenobiotic stress. The
C. elegans genome has almost half of its P450s in the CYP2
clan, yet it only has one mitochondrial clan member,
CYP44. Insects have expanded the CYP3 clan into the
large CYP6 and CYP9 families and several spinoff families. Deuterostomes have expanded CYP2 extensively,

Figure 5
The Cytochrome P450s are often found in tandem repeats on the genome
The Cytochrome P450s are often found in tandem repeats on the genome. Forty-five of the seventy-seven discovered CYPs are found on tandem repeat regions, and an additional CYP (Cyp4C53; 1481785) is found adjacent to the Cyp4Crich region on scaffold 5 (not shown). The scaffold numbers are presented on the left hand side of the figure and the positions
of each tandem repeat on the scaffold are presented before and after each break in the tandem repeat region. Arrows indicate
the direction of the repeat regions, and the names of each CYP are provided above each block that represents a single CYP
gene.

while Trichoplax adhaeren has only one CYP2 clan member
(e_gw1.8.275.1|Triad1 at JGI).
Scaffold 4 is especially rich in tandem repeat regions. It
contains 26 of the 44 (59%) CYP genes located in tandem
repeats, and 19 of these genes are CYP4 family members.
Scaffold 4 contains tandem repeats for CYP4AN, 4AP,
4BX, and 4BY subfamilies. Interestingly, a Cyp4BY subfamily member (Cyp4BY5) is located in the middle of the
Cyp4AN subfamily tandem repeat region. This is unusual
as most of the genes adjacent to each other in a tandem
repeat belong to the same subfamily. As the genes diversify a single gene cluster may contain multiple subfamilies
as in the CYP2ABFGST and the CYP4ABXZ gene clusters in
mammals [46]. An error could have been made in the
annotation of this CYP; however, re-examination of

Cyp4BY5 gene provided no evidence of this and this CYP
firmly fits in the Cyp4BY subfamily based on identity and
phylogenetic status (Fig. 2).

Conclusion
The cladoceran, D. pulex has a wide range of CYPs with the
same clans as insects, but with distinct changes in the population of each clan. Of note is the expansion of the newly
discovered CYP370 family. Elucidation of the function of
the different CYP families and subfamilies will no doubt
provide important insight into the ability of D. pulex to
respond to environmental changes, predator-prey relationships, hormonal changes, plant allelochemicals, and
sensory stimuli. Ultimately, the understanding of the evolution of animals will require deciphering the history of
the P450s and the Daphnia genome may contribute to

unraveling molecular aspects of the ecology and physiology of this commonly used crustacean species.

Methods
Manual curation
The Joint Genome Institute (JGI) http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
Daphnia/ and wFleaBase http://wfleabase.org generated
gene models for protein-coding genes in Daphnia pulex
using multiple algorithms. The models were constructed
and filtered in order to reduce redundancy based on
homology and EST support, which in turn produced the
Dappu v1.1 gene builds (July, 2007). The gene models
were directly compared to other genomes such as human,
mouse, Drosophila, zebrafish (Danio rerio), Xenopus, and
bovine (Bos taurus) on the Daphnia genome portal. We
searched for cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene models using
KEGG and KOG pathways in addition to the Advanced
Search Options on the JGI Daphnia pulex portal, and then
manually curated each of the CYPs with the help of the
gene models and genome comparisons detailed above.
Our manual annotations included corrections to several
models based on knowledge of intron-exon boundaries in
related genes and BLAST searches as described previously
[47], and later assigning gene names based on the homology of Daphnia CYPs to other species using defined
nomenclature and naming rules for complete genes and
pseudogenes [21,46].
Gross Comparisons and Phylogeny
The different CYP clans and families from Daphnia pulex
were compared to CYP genomes from human (Homo sapiens), honeybee (Apis mellifera), fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), silkmoth (Bombyx mori), purple sea urchin
(Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus), and pufferfish (Fugu
rubripes) [22,46-49]. In addition, phylogenetic comparisons of the different full length Daphnia pulex CYP genes
were performed with full length human (Homo sapiens),
fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), and honeybee (Apis mellifera), and select starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) CYPs. Honeybee, fruitfly, and human CYPs have been
manually curated, but the anemone CYPs are only available through GenBank, http://www.stellabase.org, or the
Nelson cytochrome P450 webpage [49], and have not
been curated or officially named yet. This genome was
chosen as an ancient, diploblast for comparison to protostome (honeybee, fruitfly, Daphnia) and deuterostome
(human) CYP genomes.

To construct phylogenetic trees, all of the Daphnia,
human, fruitfly, honeybee, and anemone CYP amino acid
sequences were first aligned using default parameters in
ClustalX [50]. Trees were constructed using two methods.
First, we used maximum parsimony as implemented in
PAUP 4.0b10 [51], a method that minimizes the number
of evolutionary events but does not use an explicit substi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/169

tution model. The parsimony tree was based on a heuristic
search with 10 random addition sequence replications
and tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping, with
gaps treated as missing data. A 50% majority-rule tree was
computed for all equally parsimonious trees.
Next, we constructed several trees using Bayesian inference, a probabilistic model-based method of phylogeny
reconstruction that is similar to maximum likelihood but
which has substantially reduced computation time. Bayesian trees were constructed with MrBayes version 3.1.2
[52] on a computing cluster provided by the Computational Biology Service Unit of Cornell University http://
cbsuapps.tc.cornell.edu/mrbayes.aspx. We built trees
using the "mixed-model" approach in which the Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampler explores nine different fixedrate amino acid substitution models implemented in
MrBayes. We used 4 chains with runs of 2.5 million generations with chains sampled every 100 generations and
with a burnin of 10,000 trees; the WAG [53] model was
selected as the best fitting substitution model by MrBayes.
Due to the difficulty in choosing an outgroup for such a
diverse and ancient gene family, we elected to present
phylogenies with a midpoint rooting in which the root is
placed halfway between the two most divergent
sequences. Midpoint rooting will accurately determine
the root of a phylogeny provided that rates of substitution
do not vary across the tree. To examine this assumption of
a molecular "clock", we repeated the Bayesian analyses
with the added constraint of constant rates of amino acid
substitution and rooted the resulting trees with a midpoint rooting. The "clock" constrained trees yielded the
same overall topology and root position as the unconstrained analyses, indicating that our application of a
midpoint rooting is justified.
Tandem repeat regions
Automated genome annotation software that relies on
alignment with gapping, from BLAST and BLAT thru
GeneWise, Exonerate and similar tools, may have problems identifying tandem genes and pseudogenes in areas
with highly identical exons [54]. Software may skip over
one exon and link to its nearly identical downstream gene
model in tandem repeat regions. The Daphnia pulex
genome appears rich in tandem genes, and CYPs are often
found in tandem repeat regions. Tandemgenes, or 'Tandy',
software http://eugenes.org/gmod/tandy/ was used to
address this problem, and potential CYPs found in tandem repeat areas were provided by Don Gilbert, Biology,
Indiana University http://wfleabase.org/genome-summa
ries/gene-duplicates/tdpageCytochrome_P450_15.html.
Areas potentially containing tandem repeats were carefully mined and manually curated using the newly generated models, and maps were made of each of the tandem
repeat regions.
