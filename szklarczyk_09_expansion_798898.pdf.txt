<p>The human mitochondrial proteome is shown to have expanded due to duplication of protein encoding genes and re-localization of
Mitochondrial proteome expansion
these duplicated proteins.</p>

Abstract
Background: Mitochondria are highly complex, membrane-enclosed organelles that are essential
to the eukaryotic cell. The experimental elucidation of organellar proteomes combined with the
sequencing of complete genomes allows us to trace the evolution of the mitochondrial proteome.
Results: We present a systematic analysis of the evolution of mitochondria via gene duplication in
the human lineage. The most common duplications are intra-mitochondrial, in which the ancestral
gene and the daughter genes encode mitochondrial proteins. These duplications significantly
expanded carbohydrate metabolism, the protein import machinery and the calcium regulation of
mitochondrial activity. The second most prevalent duplication, inter-compartmental, extended the
catalytic as well as the RNA processing repertoire by the novel mitochondrial localization of the
protein encoded by one of the daughter genes. Evaluation of the phylogenetic distribution of Nterminal targeting signals suggests a prompt gain of the novel localization after inter-compartmental
duplication. Relocalized duplicates are more often expressed in a tissue-specific manner relative to
intra-mitochondrial duplicates and mitochondrial proteins in general. In a number of cases, intercompartmental duplications can be observed in parallel in yeast and human lineages leading to the
convergent evolution of subcellular compartments.
Conclusions: One-to-one human-yeast orthologs are typically restricted to their ancestral
subcellular localization. Gene duplication relaxes this constraint on the cellular location, allowing
nascent proteins to be relocalized to other compartments. We estimate that the mitochondrial
proteome expanded at least 50% since the common ancestor of human and yeast.

Background

Mitochondria, next to their widely recognized function in respiration and ATP production, also play a role in key cellular
processes such as lipid metabolism, synthesis of steroid hormones, regulation of apoptosis [1] and calcium signaling [2].
Instrumental to mitochondrial function is the proteome of

the organelle, consisting of an estimated 1,500 proteins in
human [3]. Recently, owing to advanced proteomics techniques, major progress has been made in elucidating the content of the mammalian mitochondrial proteome. The
integration of many types of experimental data and computational predictions resulted in a list of mitochondrial proteins

approaching saturation, with a reasonably small false discovery rate of 10% [4]. At the same time analyses of the list of proteins revealed that only a minor fraction of the present day
mitochondrial proteome, less than 20%, shows convincing
evidence of having originated from the alpha-proteobacterial
ancestor [5-7]. This brings the origin of the large majority of
mitochondrial proteins into question and suggests that other
cellular compartments may have been a source for new mitochondrial proteins. We can examine this hypothesis by comparing organellar proteomes between species.
Detailed, large-scale studies of the inter-species evolution of
subcellular localization have begun only recently and have
shown conservation between Schizosaccharomyces pombe
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [8]. There are a number of
specific discoveries that indicate that present-day localizations for mitochondrial enzymes and complete pathways do
not necessarily reflect their evolutionary origin and there is
evidence for the relocalization of multiple metabolic pathways between subcellular compartments. For example, a citrate synthase has been relocalized from mitochondria to the
peroxisome in S. cerevisiae [9], and most of the proteins that
were derived from the ancestor of the mitochondria are not
mitochondrial in present day species [6]. It has been observed
that Frataxin and Isu1P, which are involved in the iron-sulfur
cluster assembly in mitochondria, are localized mainly in the
cytosol of the microsporidian species Trachipleistophora
hominis [10]. After the whole genome duplication event in the
ancestor of S. cerevisiae a great majority of duplicated genes
were purged from the genome [11]. Of those retained, at least
25% functionally diversified via a localization change, altering
their amino acid composition, interaction partners and level
of expression [12]. But what are the quantitative trends in the
evolution of mitochondria in the lineage leading to human?
The composition of the human and mammalian mitochondrial proteome has received great attention in the past years
[13-17]. Most recently, probabilistic integrative strategies,
which are less plagued with false discoveries specific to any
single approach, have allowed the estimation of the mammalian mitochondrial proteome at a level nearing saturation [4].
Next to the human mitochondrion, a wealth of data is available specifically on the localization of mitochondrial proteins
in various species: S. cerevisiae [18,19], Arabidopsis thaliana
[20] and Tetrahymena thermophila [21]. More than 500 proteins have been found in the mitochondria of the ciliate T.
thermophila and the estimate for yeast reaches approximately 1,000 proteins [19]. The mammalian mitochondrion
is larger still and leads to the question: which biological processes and molecular functions of proteins were introduced to
the organelle? Furthermore, how and when were these integrated? We examine the evolutionary history of gene families
that contain mitochondrial proteins to answer these questions.

The phylogenomic evidence indicates that the mitochondrial
proteome expanded not only by duplications of mitochondrial proteins, but also by relocalizations of paralogs to the
organelle, when a copy of a non-mitochondrial protein
became targeted to the mitochondrion. We also found that
the dates of the appearance of mitochondrial targeting signals
indicate that the relocalization of proteins followed promptly
after gene duplication.

Results

Human nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins were collected from MitoCarta, the state-of-the-art compendium for
the mammalian mitochondrial proteome, created using a
combination of experimental identification, bioinformatics
analysis, and literature curation [4]. The mitochondrial proteome of S. cerevisiae, containing published experimental
data [18,22-24] was obtained from the MitoP2 database [25]
together with the most comprehensive yeast mitochondrial
proteome dataset to date [19]. For the dataset of non-mitochondrial proteins required for our analysis, we used proteins
known to localize to 1 of 24 other subcellular compartments
(see Materials and methods for details).

Conservation of mitochondrial localization among
one-to-one orthologs
We first ask to what extent mitochondrial localization is conserved between man and yeast for unambiguous one-to-one
orthologs that have not been duplicated since the common
ancestor of the two species. Mitochondrial localization
appears to be very well conserved, with a few notable exceptions. From 143 one-to-one orthologous pairs localized to
mitochondria in either of the two species, we find that 124
proteins (87%) are found in this organelle in both species and
only 19 proteins localize to mitochondria in one species, but
not the other (13%; Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Of the
19 differentially localized proteins, 17 are localized to mitochondria in human and not in yeast, with experimental evidence supporting the localization for all but one protein
(Table S1 in Additional data file 1). The two remaining yeast
proteins (SEN2 and DNM1), unlike the 17 human mitochondrial proteins, do not enter the yeast mitochondrion, but
instead attach to the outer membrane [26,27]. We can infer
the ancestral localization of the human mitochondrial proteins by using the A. thaliana mitochondrial proteome. Of all
143 unambiguous human-yeast orthologs, 27 proteins were
found in plant mitochondria in a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry study [20], a number that includes
only 1 of the 19 differentially localized proteins. With this lack
of corroborated mitochondrial localization in the outgroup
species, we propose that a gain of mitochondrial localization
in the human lineage, rather than a loss in the yeast lineage,
has been the main cause of this disparate localization.
A search for a discernible functional coherence among the
retargeted proteins revealed the relocalization of a multi-pro-

tein functional module in human. Three enzymes participating in ornithine metabolism can be found in mitochondria in
human and ureotelic mammals, but not in yeast: OTC,
CPSase I and P5CS. Of these, OTC and CPSase I are part of the
urea cycle whose evolutionary relocalization has been
reported extensively [28,29].
At least 8 of the 17 proteins relocalized in human were concomitantly found in other subcellular compartments of the
mammalian cell as indicated in the published literature based
on small-scale experiments (Table S2 in Additional data file
1). It should therefore be noted that complete relocalizations
to the mitochondria that also involve the loss of the ancestral
localization are even more rare than proteins that gain mitochondrial localization without the loss of the ancestral one.
Apparently, a protein tends to gain a novel localization without losing the ancestral subcellular localization - for example,
by adding a mitochondrial targeting signal to one of its isoforms, as in the case of dUTP pyrophosphatase (DUT) and
peroxiredoxin-5 [30,31]. Although interesting in themselves,
these observations emphasize that relocalizations of products
of single copy genes between subcellular compartments are
rare and limited to a relatively small set of cellular functions.

Increase of the human mitochondrial proteome via
intra-mitochondrial protein duplication
Investigations of the subcellular localization of one-to-one
orthologs do not explain the expansion of the mitochondrial
proteome. We therefore examined the evolutionary history of
duplicated genes containing mitochondrial paralogs. We analyzed eukaryotic gene trees reconciled with the species phylogeny to identify gene duplications that followed the
divergence of human and yeast (see Materials and methods
for details). We observed two prevailing ways in which gene
duplications contributed to the expansion of the metazoan
mitochondrial proteome (Table 1). In the first mode, 65 duplications of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins
gave rise to a set of 118 mitochondrial proteins, with up to four
proteins per family as in the case of pyruvate dehydrogenases
or ADP/ATP translocases (see Table S3 in Additional data file
1 for the list of proteins). With all human paralogs and the
yeast ortholog localized to mitochondria, the ancestral protein was most likely targeted to this organelle as well, which is
confirmed by the presence of approximately 50% orthologous

proteins in plant mitochondria in the study [20]. Figure 1
shows the specific cellular functions performed by intra-mitochondrial protein duplications. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis reveals enrichment of proteins involved in carbohydrate
metabolism ([GO:5975], P < 2e-4) and various components of
transport ([GO:6810], P < 6e-4, amino acid transport, ion
transport and protein transport complexes embedded in the
inner and outer membranes). Additionally, 11 out of 23 calcium ion binding proteins [GO:5509] originate from intramitochondrial duplications (P < 7e-4; see Table S5 in Additional data file 1 for the list of all categories). These functional
gene classes are significantly overrepresented relative to the
composition of the whole mitochondrial proteome, and therefore reflect a specific characteristic of intra-mitochondrial
duplications.

Increase of the human mitochondrial proteome via
inter-compartmental protein duplication
The second most common type of duplication associated with
increasing the mitochondrial proteome is characterized by
human mitochondrial proteins with a human non-mitochondrial paralog (Table 1; Table S6 in Additional data file 1). For
those gene families that have a non-mitochondrial ortholog in
yeast, the most parsimonious scenario suggests a non-mitochondrial localization in the common ancestor of human and
yeast, and a subsequent gain of mitochondrial localization.
We hypothesized that these proteins can constitute gains of
mitochondrial localization in the human lineage. To validate
this hypothesis, we inspected the localization of plant
orthologs of inter-compartmental duplications, identifying
only two mitochondrial proteins among 29 orthologs in A.
thaliana. This suggests that the majority of mitochondrial
proteins with a non-mitochondrial paralog were ancestrally
non-mitochondrial and represent gains of mitochondrial
localization in the lineage leading to human. A detailed GO
analysis of the entire set of inter-compartmental duplications
reveals enrichment among biological processes responsible
for molecular functions, such as cofactor binding (P < 2e-3,
[GO:48037]), intramolecular oxidoreductase (P < 5e-3,
[GO:16863]), ceramide kinase (P < 4e-4, [GO:1729]), catalytic activity in general (P < 2e-3, [GO:3824]), but also the
process of 12S rRNA methylation (P < 4e-3, [GO:154]; Table
S7 in Additional data file 1) necessary for the stability of the
small ribosomal subunit [32].

The assumption that we can use the non-mitochondrial localization in yeast as a proxy for the ancestral localization enables us to recognize protein retargeting events between
mitochondria and other subcellular compartments, including
the nucleus (8 out of 29 proteins; Table S8 in Additional data
file 1), peroxisome (6 out of 29) and endoplasmic reticulum (5
out of 29 proteins). Four of the six peroxisomal relocalization
events encode proteins responsible for fatty acid beta-oxidation in yeast (PCD1, ECI1, DCI1, POX1) and their duplicated
orthologs are found in human mitochondria.

Relocalized proteins often originate from ancient, premetazoan duplications
Using phylogenetic trees of genes that encode the modern
human mitochondrion, we inferred the timing of duplications
(see Materials and methods). Around 80% of duplications are
equally divided between two evolutionary stages: before the
divergence of bilateria and before the divergence of vertebrates (Figure 2). Intra-mitochondrial gene duplications were
found to be representative of the general duplication trends
across the whole genome (no statistical difference with the
genome-wide duplication trend, P > 0.6 Fisher exact test). By
contrast, the duplications associated with relocalizations to
the mitochondria happened predominantly in the earlier
stage of evolution, before the divergence of bilateria. At this
evolutionary time point they significantly exceed the genomewide fraction of duplications (P < 0.003). Following the massive duplication events before the radiation of vertebrates
(the 2R hypothesis [33,34]; although alternative hypotheses
exist [35]), mitochondrial protein content continued to evolve
as exemplified by the recent duplication of glutamate dehydrogenase [36]. And even though the reference mitochondrial
proteome used in this study is derived from mouse tissues,
and therefore the accurate protein localization data for primate-specific duplications is limited, we encountered 16 gene
duplications of mitochondrial proteins in primates (Table S11
in Additional data file 1).

Szklarczyk and Huynen R135.5

Relocalizations promptly follow duplications
An unmentioned assumption in the analysis of inter-compartmental protein duplications is that the protein relocalization followed shortly after the gene duplication. Even though
the pre-sequence mitochondrial import pathway is only one
of four presently recognized means of protein import
(reviewed in [37]), many mitochondrial proteins contain a
short, amino-terminal localization sequence that is indicative
of this pathway. This sequence feature is amenable to computational methods [38]. For proteins imported to the mitochondria via the pre-sequence pathway, the gain of a novel
localization may be caused by the acquisition of an amino-terminal targeting signal. Indeed, when examining all proteins
with a novel mitochondrial localization, a potential mitochondrial targeting signal can be identified in 50% of the proteins, five times more often than in their non-mitochondrial
human paralogs (P < 0.00005, Fisher exact test). Assuming
that in these proteins the targeting signal is responsible for
the mitochondrial localization, we examined whether its
appearance in evolution coincides with the gene duplication,
and thus whether the duplication was concomitant with a
gain of mitochondrial localization.
Among human mitochondrial proteins with a non-mitochondrial paralog we find 12 proteins with a recognizable short,
amino-terminal targeting sequence. Despite the limitations
of computational targeting sequence prediction (for example,
[20]) in 9 out of the 12 gene families the phylogenetic analysis
indicates that the mitochondrial targeting signal was gained
in the same era as, or shortly after, the gene duplication
(Table 2).

Tissue-specific expression of novel mitochondrial
proteins
Using mass spectrometry total peak intensity data available
for 14 different mouse tissues [4], we performed quantitative
analysis of tissue-specific protein expression by counting the

number of tissues in which the protein was detected (specifically, the number of tissues with log10 peak intensities of at
least 7). A typical mitochondrial protein is abundantly
expressed and detectable in 12 (median value) out of 14 tissues (Table S12 in Additional data file 1). Only proteins that
underwent inter-compartmental duplications are expressed
in significantly fewer tissues (median 5; P < 0.01 using a twosided Wilcoxon rank sum test performed pairwise with other
datasets). These novel mitochondrial proteins (proteins that
possess a non-mitochondrial paralog and a non-mitochondrial yeast ortholog) more often exhibit a tissue specific
expression pattern with 45% expressed in three tissues or
fewer (compared to the mitochondrial average of 23%), and
are more rarely widely expressed (in more than 10 tissues;
28% novel mitochondrial proteins compared to 55% on average) (Figure 3).

Subcellular differentiation via independent gene
duplications
While tracing the history of duplications that extend the mitochondrial proteome, one can imagine, in the most drastic scenario, that independent duplications in unrelated lineages
with subsequent parallel relocalizations to mitochondria
could lead to a convergent evolution in the mitochondrial
protein content. Several paralogs present this unusual evolutionary pattern (Table 3). For example, branched-chainamino-acid aminotransferase underwent duplication at the
root of vertebrates, in addition to an independent event in
yeast as a result of whole genome duplication. In both species
one copy is targeted to the mitochondria (BCAT2 in human),
the other is cytosolic (BCAT1). In the case of this gene family,

the targeting signal sheds light on the likely ancestral localization. Using MitoProt II [39] and TargetP [38] the signal can
be detected in the fly sequence as well as Leishmania major
orthologs, suggesting that the ancestral BCAT protein was
part of the mitochondrial proteome in the ancestor of human
and yeast (Figure 4).

The growth of the mitochondrial proteome by gene
duplication
Knowing the homology of proteins with a determined localization in human and yeast, we reconstructed the (partial)
protein complement of mitochondria of the common ancestor
of human and yeast, comprising circa 200 proteins in total.
Starting with this ancestral proteome, we counted 128 duplications of mitochondrial proteins in the human lineage,
including intra-mitochondrial duplications and proteins
novel to the mitochondria (relocalizations following the
duplication of non-mitochondrial proteins). As not all types
of evolutionary events allow us to easily infer the ancestral
localization, this puts a lower bound on the protein count,
concluding that the metazoan mitochondrion in the human
lineage expanded by 64% (128 out of 200) by means of gene
duplication and relocalization since the evolutionary split
with the yeast lineage (see Materials and methods for details).
These counts are likely to be an underestimate of a real mitochondrial proteome expansion, as we disregard proteins
without recognizable orthologs in S. cerevisiae that appeared
in the metazoan lineage.

Discussion and conclusions

Our investigation reveals a dynamic mitochondrial proteome
and paints a picture of a eukaryotic organelle with a functional repertoire evolving by gene duplication. In the absence
of gene duplication, we find little room for functional diversification of the mitochondrial proteome by relocalization of
proteins. The subcellular localization of proteins that did not
duplicate since the divergence of human and yeast is almost
always conserved in evolution, with a few notable exceptions.
In the presence of duplication events the mitochondrion
expanded via two major modes. In the first, more conservative mode, intra-mitochondrial duplications expanded the
mitochondrial proteome by duplication of proteins that were
already localized to mitochondria. In the second and a more
radical mode of proteome growth, inter-compartmental
duplications expanded the metazoan and human mitochondrial proteome by the duplication of non-mitochondrial proteins and redirecting the newly arisen gene products to the
mitochondria.
The two modes of proteome expansion comprise different
functional protein classes. Duplications of genes responsible
for carbohydrate metabolism, calcium ion binding and various forms of transport appear to be specific to intra-mitochondrial protein duplications, whereas cofactor binding,
intramolecular oxidoreductases, ceramide kinase and rRNA

of eutheria). The duplication pattern of post-translational
regulators of the PDH complex differs from that of the complex itself. The inactivating phosphorylation of the PDH complex is carried out by four paralogs of PDH kinase, and all
duplication events occurred before the divergence of the vertebrates. Prior to the catalytic activation, PDH must be
dephosphorylated by one of the two paralogous proteins:
PDP1 (PPM2C) and PDP2. PDP1, in contrast to its paralog, is
activated by calcium ions and, therefore, might mediate the
effects of calcium-mobilizing hormones [43]. It is difficult to
establish the evolutionary origin of a domain responsible for
the binding with Ca2+, as the binding site is created upon the
formation of a complex with the E2 subunit of the PDH complex and requires the lipoyl groups of E2 [44]. Nevertheless,
the calcium-dependence of PDP1 is consistent with a trend
present in mitochondrial proteins. We identify duplications
of Ca2+-binding mitochondrial solute carriers [45], as well as
proteins responsible for calcium-sensitive mitochondrial
trafficking along microtubules [46,47]. Overall, 11 out of 23 of
the calcium ion binding proteins originate from intra-mitochondrial duplications that occurred at the root of vertebrates
(P < 7e-4, [GO:5509]).
In general, it appears that the regulation of cellular complexes
is more evolutionarily recent than the complexes they control.
That the duplications of the PDH complex occurred before
the vertebral duplications of their regulators, kinases and
phosphatases, is not a unique case. Also, the soluble mitochondrial matrix deacetylase SIRT3 has a relatively recent
origin, and was shown to augment Complex I activity by binding with the 39 kDa subunit of Complex I, NDUFA9 [48]. It is
known that the growth of many mitochondrial protein complexes occurred early in evolution, with mitochondrial Complex I and the mitochondrial ribosome expanding
significantly at the root of eukaryotes [49-51]. Interestingly,
regulators of activity of the complexes via phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation (as for PDH) or deacetylation (Complex I) did not appear concomitantly in evolution and were
not adapted from existing regulators, but emerged long after
the metazoan diversification.
When analyzing duplications of proteins that expanded the
mitochondrial proteome, it would be interesting to know the
selective forces driving duplication events. We show that the
novel mitochondrial localization that is detectable at the
sequence level has been gained rapidly after the duplication
event. On the one hand, we know that only a small fraction of
duplicated genes is retained in the genome in the long term,
and this holds also for large-scale genomic events such as
whole genome duplication [52]. On the other hand, the acquisition of an amino-terminal targeting signal coinciding with
the gene duplication event could provide the rationale for the
retention of the duplicated gene. As the change of localization
alters the role of a protein in the cell, it could be accompanied
by further functional diversification. This diversification may
be extensive, even for relatively recent duplications, as in the

case of HTRA2 protease (Table 2). The membrane-bound
HTRA2, unlike its secreted paralogs, promotes or induces cell
apoptosis through caspase-dependent and -independent
pathways [53] and its loss of function mutations cause neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease [54].
Analysis of the timing of duplication events reveals that the
majority of inter-compartmental duplications occurred further back in time than the genomic trend would suggest and
that they contributed little to the expansion of the mitochondrial proteome in the vertebrate lineage. The fact that most
inter-compartmental duplications occurred before animals
diverged suggests that cellular differentiation is partly
responsible for inter-compartmental duplications. We propose that the inter-compartmental duplicated proteins could
have helped to satisfy the variable energy demands that
emerging metazoan tissues presented. There is some anecdotal evidence that could support this hypothesis. For example,
the pattern of tissue-specific expression of TOP1MT (Table 2)
has adapted to meet the requirements for higher mitochondrial activity in specific organs - for example, skeletal muscle,
heart, and brain [55]. Additionally, we observed that intercompartmental duplications/relocalizations are characterized by a more narrow, tissue-specific expression than average mitochondrial proteins (see Table S12 and Figure S2 in
Additional data file 1).
Our quantitative results of the evolution of the mitochondrial
proteome match anecdotal evidence for the role of inter-compartmental duplications in the expansion of the proteomes of
other eukaryotic organelles. Some pathways and key enzymes
were known to have duplicated between plastids and other
cellular compartments [56], as observed in the case of sulfate
assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis found in the chloroplasts, cytosol and mitochondria of plants [57]. In addition,
the evolutionary history of 12 Calvin cycle enzymes shows
that plant proteins encoded by the nucleus have relocalized to
alternative compartments, regardless of their origin, cyanobacterial or otherwise [58].
With 87% of mitochondrial proteins preserving their ancestral compartment between human and yeast, a gene duplication event appears to be a necessary prerequisite to release
the localization constraint, allowing nascent proteins to be
retargeted to distinct compartments. We therefore conclude
that non-mitochondrial protein duplications followed by the
gain of a novel mitochondrial localization comprise a qualitatively and quantitatively important mode of expansion of the
mitochondrial proteome.

Materials and methods
Mitochondrial proteomes
Mammalian nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins were
downloaded from MitoCarta, the state-of-the-art compendium of the human mitochondrial proteome established

using combination of experimental identification, bioinformatic analysis, and literature curation [4]. We mapped 1,001
human orthologous proteins onto Ensembl identifiers using
human-mouse ortholog lists from Ensembl v44 (April 2007)
[59] and Mouse Genome Database [60]. For yeast, to assure
specificity of its mitochondrial proteome, a reference set was
downloaded from the MitoP2 database [61]. This set of 545
proteins contains published experimental data based on various studies [18,22-24] and was subsequently manually
curated. To exclude non-confirmed mitochondrial proteins,
for which a mitochondrial localization was only predicted or
derived from early high-throughput studies, we also required
mitochondrial proteins to be present among 851 proteins
from the most comprehensive dataset of the yeast mitochondrial proteome to date [19]. The proteomes selected as
described assure few false positive proteins, but do not completely cover mitochondrial protein content. Because of the
incomplete coverage, the absence of evidence for mitochondrial localization cannot be taken as evidence for the absence
of mitochondrial localization. For the non-mitochondrial
proteins set, only proteins localized to other eukaryotic subcellular compartments were taken into account. This
included proteins explicitly assigned to 24 non-mitochondrial
compartments as annotated in GO of human genes (see Table
S10 in Additional data file 1 for the full list of the compartments), analogous to the non-mitochondrial reference dataset from [62].

Gene trees of mitochondrial proteins
To take into account the evolutionary history of every protein,
including gene losses and duplications, we performed analysis of individual gene trees reconciled with the species phylogeny, as provided by the Ensembl team [59]. The
phylogenomic Ensembl pipeline provides a dataset of gene
trees across multiple species, constructed using both dS, dN
(substitution rates), nucleotide and protein distance measures [63]. These data, together with the standard species tree,
informs the gene tree construction performed by the TreeBeST program [64] (L Heng, AJ Vilella, E Birney, R Durbin,
in preparation). First, all protein coding genes are queried
using WUBLASTP against the whole protein database. Subsequently, a graph of proteins is constructed, with edges created
for best reciprocal hits or when score(P1, P2)/max(score(P1,
P1), score(P2, P2)) >0.33. Connected components of the
graph are extracted and aligned subsequently with MUSCLE
[65]. The back-translated multiple alignment is passed to the
tree constructing program, TreeBeST, together with the species tree for the reconciliation and the duplication calls on
internal nodes, as the coverage of genomes in the Ensembl
database provides topologically based timings in order to
label duplication events [63]. All human gene trees with a
mitochondrial gene product (mitochondrial proteins in either
human or yeast) were downloaded from Ensembl database
v44 [59]. When integrating datasets from human and yeast
for 50% human genes and 46% yeast proteins, we did not

Volume 10, Issue 11, Article R135

Szklarczyk and Huynen R135.9

detect homologs in the other species, representing a likely
gene loss or gain in one of these lineages.

Unambiguous one-to-one orthologs between human
and yeast
The trees for gene families were separated at the speciation
branches into opisthokont orthogroups and the number of
paralogs in human and yeast lineages was counted. One-toone unambiguous orthologs were represented by trees with a
single gene in both lineages.

Gene duplications
For each gene family of n genes, we infer n-1 duplications,
each duplication corresponding to an internal tree node. The
dating of the duplication was inferred from the analysis of the
tree topology, as annotated by the Ensembl team. We use
rooted trees of homologous genes, where branching points
are labeled with the inferred time of duplication. For example, a gene tree ((GeneA, GeneB):Euteleostomi,(GeneC,
GeneD):Euteleostomi):Chordata yields a single chordate
duplication that is followed by two vertebrate duplications.
For the inter-compartmental duplication a divergence time of
a mitochondrial and a closest non-mitochondrial paralog was
inferred from the internal node giving rise to the duplication.
To asses the quality of gene duplication calls, we used the
duplication consistency score [63]. The score measures the
intersection of the number of species post-duplication over
the union; one expects that most duplications should have the
gene persisting in an equally likely manner in subsequent lineages [63]. All of the three duplication datasets (intra-mitochondrial, inter-compartmental or duplications outside
mitochondria) had similar, high consistency scores, with
median values of 0.85, 0.86, 0.85, respectively (Figure S1 in
Additional data file 1). The datasets tested with two-sided
Wilcoxon rank sum test do not exhibit statistically significant
differences (P-value > 0.65).

Differential localization
Of the differentially localized one-to-one orthologs, we find 17
proteins localized to mitochondria only in human and 16 of
these are either reference mitochondrial proteins known
from the literature or were experimentally verified in the
Pagliarini et al. study [4]. For families with gene duplications
and differentially localized human paralogs, localization was
predicted computationally for only three mitochondrial proteins, with the remaining proteins validated experimentally
in the Pagliarini et al. study by either green fluorescent protein marker (4 proteins), proteomics approaches (7 proteins)
or being part of a mammalian mitochondrial reference set
based on the literature curation (15 proteins).

A. thaliana orthologs
Of the one-to-one human-yeast orthologs, 104 possess an
ortholog in plants (determined using the homologene database [66] and 27 were found in mitochondria in Heazlewood
et al. [20]. With regard to intra-mitochondrial duplications,

47 plant orthologs were found, 23 of which are in the mitochondria.

Estimation of the expansion of the mitochondrial proteome
We identified 122 unambiguous one-to-one nuclear encoded
gene products with a reliable mitochondrial localization in
human and yeast (Table S1 in Additional data file 1), with 17
differentially localized orthologs likely to be mitochondrial
gains in the human lineage (see Results). Genes that underwent duplications originated from at least 66 ancestral
opisthokont genes (for which we can find at least one protein
from the family in mitochondria of both human and yeast;
family counts are 53 + 8 + 4 + 1 from Table S4 in Additional
data file 1, with each family stemming from a single ancestral
gene), or 78 if we add families with uncertain common ancestry (mitochondrial only in human; an additional 12 families).
This, together with one-to-one orthologs, gives 188 to 200
ancestral proteins. Given the present human mitochondrial
protein compendium, restricted to proteins with an ortholog
in yeast with a known localization, we arrive at 128 to 140
mitochondrial acquisitions in the human lineage. Given 188
to 200 ancestral mitochondrial proteins and 128 to 140 gains
in the metazoan evolutionary branch, we estimate an expansion of the mitochondrial proteome between 64% (128/200)
and 74% (140/188).

Dating mitochondrial relocalization
For the prediction of the amino-terminal targeting signal in
the protein sequences, Target P was used [67] for all known
isoforms of a given gene. It is important to mention that the
pre-sequence analysis programs do not use homology to
known mitochondrial proteins or mitochondria-specific
domains as an indicator of presence/absence of targeting signal.
