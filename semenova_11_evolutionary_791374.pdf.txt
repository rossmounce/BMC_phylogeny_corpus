Evolutionary patterns of proteinase activity in
attine ant fungus gardens
Tatyana A Semenova1,2,3, David P Hughes1,4, Jacobus J Boomsma1, Morten Schiøtt1*

Abstract
Background: Attine ants live in symbiosis with a basidiomycetous fungus that they rear on a substrate of plant
material. This indirect herbivory implies that the symbiosis is likely to be nitrogen deprived, so that specific
mechanisms may have evolved to enhance protein availability. We therefore hypothesized that fungal proteinase
activity may have been under selection for efficiency and that different classes of proteinases might be involved.
Results: We determined proteinase activity profiles across a wide pH range for fungus gardens of 14 Panamanian
species of fungus-growing ants, representing eight genera. We mapped these activity profiles on an independently
obtained molecular phylogeny of the symbionts and show that total proteinase activity in lower attine symbionts
peaks at ca. pH 6. The higher attine symbionts that have no known free-living relatives had much higher
proteinase activities than the lower attine symbionts. Their total in vitro proteinase activity peaked at pH values
around 5, which is close to the pH that the ants maintain in their fungus gardens, suggesting that the pH
optimum of fungal proteinases may have changed after the irreversible domestication of evolutionary more
derived fungal symbionts. This notion is also supported by buffering capacities of fungus gardens at pH 5.2 being
remarkably high, and suggests that the fungal symbiont actively helps to maintain garden acidity at this specific
level. Metalloproteinases dominated the activity profiles of lower attine gardens and may thus represent the
ancestral type of proteinase production, whereas serine proteinase activity dominated the activity profiles of the
higher attine gardens reared by Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex, suggesting that there may be trade-offs in the
production of these enzyme classes. Remarkably, the single symbiont that is shared by species of the crown group
of Atta and Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants mostly showed metalloproteinase activity, suggesting that recurrent
changes in enzyme production may have occurred throughout the domestication history of fungus-garden
symbionts.
Conclusions: Proteinase pH optima and buffering capacities of fungal symbionts appear to have evolved
remarkable adaptations to living in obligate symbiosis with farming ants. Although the functional roles of serine
and metalloproteinases in fungus gardens are unknown, the differential production of these classes of proteolytic
enzymes suggest that substrate specificity may be important and that trade-offs may prevent the simultaneous
upregulation of both classes of enzymes.

Background
Organisms that engage in an obligate mutualistic lifestyle often experience a drastic change in environmental
conditions. Well known examples are symbiotic bacteria
in the rumen of ungulates and the mitochondria in
eukaryotic cells, which function under quite different
growth conditions than free-living bacteria, and have

genomes that became modified or reduced in response
to these specialized dependent life styles [1,2]. However,
the expression of derived symbiotic traits is difficult to
study in endosymbiotic bacteria, because they can normally not be grown on artificial media [3] or otherwise
be studied separately from the host. This is easier in
obligate ectosymbioses where hosts and symbionts can
often survive and function without their partner-mutualist for at least a short period, and where relatively pure
samples of symbiont biomass can often be obtained and
analyzed.

Attine ants live in obligate mutualistic association with
specific fungi that they rear for food in underground
gardens. The cultivated fungi mostly belong to the tribe
Leucocoprini (Basidiomycotina: Agaricales: Agaricaceae)
[4,5] which primarily consists of free-living saprotrophic
genera that grow in the lower litter layer of forest floors,
usually characterized by high pH levels [6] The ants
supply their mutualistic fungi with substrate and protect
their gardens from infections [5]. One of the defense
mechanisms to control diseases is the secretion of the
ant’s metapleural glands [7-10], which generates acidic
conditions in fungus gardens, discouraging microbial
growth relative to the surrounding soil with higher pH.
Acetic acid is being produced in the fungus gardens, but
this has to be tightly regulated as it has the potential to
inflict more harm to the symbiont than to alien fungi
[10]. The domestication of fungal symbionts by the ants
may therefore have required specific adaptations for
growing under lower but more controlled pH conditions, both in terms of pH buffering and with regard to
the activity optima of the extracellular enzymes that are
produced to degrade the substrate that the ants collect.
Nitrogen is a limiting factor for growth and maintenance in many organisms, particularly those living on a
herbivorous diet as the attine ants indirectly do. Recent
findings show that leaf-cutting ants partly overcome
nitrogen limitation by living in association with N2-fixing
bacteria that may supply as much as 50% of a colony’s
nitrogen requirements [11]. Such bacterial nitrogen
will be incorporated into proteins, so that the fungal
symbionts of the ants must secrete proteinases to
digest these into amino acids that can be assimilated.
The fungal symbiont is also likely to compete for
nitrogen with other, non mutualistic microorganisms
living in the fungus garden [12,9,13], imposing further
selection for effective protein degradation by the fungal
symbiont. Finally, proteolytic enzymes are known to be
strongly pH dependent, so in order to have effective
protein degradation the pH optimum of the proteolytic
enzymes should ideally match the pH of the fungus
garden.
Several studies have been devoted to the role of pH in
controlling in vitro proteolytic enzyme secretion in fungi
[14], but to our knowledge in vivo studies of pH-dependent proteolytic enzyme activities in fungi have not
been done. The objective of our present study was thus
threefold: 1. To use the unique growth form of ant fungus gardens to determine the feasibility of pH buffering
studies in fungi, 2. To determine the pH activity optima
of different classes of extracellular proteinases across a
series of genera and species of fungus-growing ants, and
3. To map the observed differences on an independently
obtained phylogenetic tree of the fungal symbionts to
obtain insight in the evolutionary pathways that may

have generated differences in pH-dependent activities of
proteinases.

Results
The pH conditions of fungus gardens and their buffering
capacity

All 29 attine ant colonies used in this study (see Table 1
for details) displayed the same pH (5.2 ± 0.1) for 1:1
water extracts taken from the middle layer of the fungus
gardens. Adding acid/alkaline solutions to the fungus
garden extracts did not noticeable change the color of
pH paper compared to controls (data not shown) indicating that all tested fungus gardens exhibited approximately the same buffering strength.
Approximate buffering capacities for attine symbionts
and non-symbiotic basidiomycetous fungi (Table 2)
showed that fungus garden symbionts and plated L. gongylophorus (ca 6 - 22 mekv/L) tended to have higher
buffering capacities than free-living fungi (ca 2 - 10
mekv/L) (t23 = -8.6, p < 0.001). The buffering capacity
of plated fungi did not depend on the composition of
the cultivation media. The relationship between the pH
and the amount of added base was approximately linear
(R2 not less than 0.976, data not shown) suggesting that
all measurements were performed in the pH zone close
to the buffer point of the tested solutions where they
exhibit their maximal buffering capacity [15].
Differential production of proteinase classes across
fungus gardens

All tested colonies displayed significant proteinase activity
(Table 1). The mean total activity values ± SE were 127 ±
11, 270 ± 19 and 360 ± 28 U·103 (± SE) for lower attine,
higher attine and leaf-cutting ant gardens, respectively,
which implies that total proteinase activity increases with
the degree of evolutionary “advancement” of the symbiosis.
However, the garden of Apterostigma collare was an
exception to this rule, expressing relatively high total proteinase activity compared to the other lower attine ants.
This is remarkable as these ants rear a phylogenetically
distant fungus, belonging to the family Pterulaceae, while
all other attines cultivate fungi belonging to the Leucocoprini tribe of the family Agaricaceae [4,5].
Inhibition analyses revealed that proteinases belonging
to all four catalytic classes could be detected in the fungus gardens (Table 1), but the activity of aspartic and
cysteine proteinases was very low compared to the activity of serine- and metalloproteinases. This result was not
unexpected as cysteine and aspartic proteinases are
rarely produced by fungi [16,17]. The serine proteinases
belonged to the subtilase-like superfamily as they were
inhibited by PMSF, but not by TLCK and TPCK [18],
and they displayed activity towards the chromogenic
substrates Glp-AAL-pNa and Suc-AAPF-pNa, but not

could not be further identified.
The activities of the two dominant classes of proteinases
varied considerably between fungus gardens (Figure 1),
with lower attine symbionts having low activities for both
classes and the basal higher attine- and leaf-cutting

symbionts specializing in producing mostly only one class.
Leaf-cutting ant gardens were characterized by high activity of metalloproteinases, similar (at least in relative activity) to the lower attine gardens, whereas the gardens of
basal higher attine ants, with one exception, primarily
showed serine proteinase activity (Figure 1).

Mapping proteolytic activity profiles on the phylogenetic
tree of the fungal symbionts

serine proteinase activity, U*103

Mapping the pH optima curves of proteinase activity on
the phylogenetic tree of the fungal symbionts (Figure 2)
showed distinct correlations between symbiont clades
and the classes of proteinases that were primarily active.
High serine proteinase activity was typical for the symbionts of Sericomyrmex amabilis, Trachymyrmex sp3,
and T. cf. zeteki, which formed a monophyletic group.

metalloproteinase activity, U*103

Figure 1 Fungal proteolytic activity (see Table 1) partitioned
between serine- and metalloproteinases. Lower attine, basal
higher attine and leaf-cutting ant activities are plotted in blue,
green and red, respectively.

In contrast, the symbionts of T. cornetzi had a proteinase profile resembling that of the Acromyrmex and
Atta leaf-cutting ants, and formed a sister group to the
remaining Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex symbionts.
The only exception to this pattern was one of the four
symbionts of T. cornetzi (Trcor4), which had an intermediate proteinase profile with almost equal serine- and
metalloproteinase activity, and which formed the most
basal branch of the T. cornetzi clade of symbionts (number 17, Figure 2).
The pH optimum of total proteinase activity in the
gardens reared by lower attines averaged 6.0 ± 0.11,
while the peak of proteinase activity in basal higher
attines and leaf-cutting ants colonies was closer to
the pH levels (ca. 5) in the fungus gardens (Figure 3;
Table 1) (t 36 = 9.3, p < 0.001), as one would expect
when the higher attine fungus gardens would have
become adapted to growing under more acidic conditions. However, in three of the four clades of higher
attine and leaf-cutting symbionts, the total proteinases
activity profiles between pH 5 and 7 were remarkably
flat, as serine proteinases became increasingly active at
higher pHs (Figures 2 and 3). For example, the serine
proteinases in Sericomyrmex amabilis colonies were
most active at pH conditions of 7.0 ± 0.05, similar to
lower attine gardens (7.0 ± 0.09) where serine proteinase
activity is rarely seen, whereas an additional peak of serine proteinase activity at pH 5.2 ± 0.11 (different from
the 7.0 mean above: t6 = 17.0, p < 0.001) was observed

Figure 2 pH-dependent proteolytic enzyme activity profiles mapped on the fungal symbiont phylogeny. The pH optima curves concern
total proteinase activity (solid lines) and metallo- and serine proteinase activity separately (dashed and dotted lines, respectively). Vertical lines
on the graphs represent the respective pH conditions of fungus gardens (5.2) and the typical pH optimum for alkaline proteinases (7.0). The
profiles of lower attines plus higher attines with mainly serine proteinase activity and higher attine and leaf-cutting ants with mainly
metalloproteinase activity are outlined with blue, green and red backgrounds, respectively, to match color-coding in Figure 1. The single
Trachymyrmex cornetzi garden with an intermediate proteinase profile is plotted against a brown background and the single Apterostigma collare
colony rearing a pterulaceous fungal symbiont against a grey background. The numbering of fungus gardens corresponds to the numbers used
in the Table 1. The Myrmicocrypta ednaella (Myred1) profile is representative for all lower attine gardens. The Sericomyrmex amabilis (Serama1)
garden was chosen as illustrative example because it showed a relatively high metalloproteinase activity, so that a clearer pH profile could be
obtained. For Trachymyrmex species with predominantly serine proteinase activity we plotted the average profile for Trachymyrmex sp3 (Trsp3-3)
and Trachymyrmex cf. zeteki (Trzet3), which were very similar. As representatives of the basal higher attine and leaf-cutting ant symbionts with
predominantly metalloproteinase activity we plotted gardens of colonies Trcor10 and Acech322 as gardens of other colonies with this symbiont
displayed very similar profiles. The phylogenetic tree is based on the LSU rRNA and Elongation Factor 1-alpha genes, except for samples 20 and
23 for which only the LSU gene could be sequenced. Only aLRT (approximate likelihood ratio test) support values > 0.5 are given.

for the symbionts of Trachymyrmex sp3 and T. cf. zeteki,
but not for Sericomyrmex symbionts (Figures 2 and 3
and Table 1). Similar patterns were observed for
metalloproteinases. The relatively low amounts produced in the symbionts of lower attine ants were most
active under slightly acidic pH conditions (6.0 ± 0.11)
and shifts towards more acidic optima were detected
for the symbionts of Trachymyrmex cornetzi (5.6 ±
0.09) (t 4 = 3.45, p = 0.026) and the leaf-cutting ants

mutualists (5.2 ± 0.08) (t6 = 10.0, p < 0.001) (Figures 2
and 3 and Table 1).

Discussion
Fungus-garden pH buffering capacity is remarkably high

Acidification of the environment increases the difference
between the extracellular surroundings and the intracellular milieu, so that compensating metabolic activities
are required to maintain the pH within cells at the

Figure 3 The class-specific pH optima for serine (vertical axis)
and metalloproteinases (horizontal axis) for the fungus
gardens in Table 1 for which both pH optima could be
measured from the same samples. The vertical axis is interrupted
to allow the pH-optimum to be plotted for metalloproteinase
activity in gardens where serine proteinase activity could not be
measured. The overall pattern indicates that pH optima for
metalloproteinases are always between ca. 5 and 6, whereas serine
proteinase pH optima tend to fall between 7 and 8. All values are
means ± SEMs. Dotted lines connect observations for the same
species. See Table 1 for details.

Although the production and secretion of buffering
agents may impose significant metabolic costs, this may
be sustainable because domestication implies that the
ants provision the fungus with ad libitum resources. The
benefits of buffering at a constant pH of ca. 5.2 might
then be that this value represents a compromise
between enhancing efficiency of degradation enzymes
and discouraging the growth of parasitic microorganisms that infect fungus gardens [10,31]. If such dynamic
equilibrium would exist, it might imply that acidification
by the ants and/or the symbiont can be maintained continuously because pH-buffering ensures the necessary
stability required for vital fungus garden functions. It
seems unlikely that fungal buffering compounds are primarily targeted towards neutralizing the antimicrobial
metapleural gland secretions of pH 2.5 [9,10], as a
recent study has shown that the ants apply these secretions in very small portions and with great care [32].
The main cause of fungus gardens acidification thus
remains unknown, but may be based on a combination
of fungal secretions and contributions from other glands
of the farming ants.
The evolution of proteinase activity in the fungal
symbionts

approximately neutral values that normally optimize
growth and survival of fungal hyphae [20]. In vitro,
these metabolic activities include the synthesis of pH
regulating compounds and the modification of excreted
compounds so they can function under acidic conditions
[21,22,14,23]. This is particularly important for the
extracellular proteolytic enzymes secreted by the fungal
symbiont of the leaf-cutting ants, because these enzymes
secure the decomposition of proteins that ultimately
supply nitrogen to the ant colony [24,25].
Fungi are known to modify the environmental pH in
vitro [14] and to regulate pH in vivo by secreting weak
organic acids [23] with buffering properties [26,27].
However, fungi normally avoid natural habitats with
unsuitable pH [6], possibly because of the metabolic
costs of this type of adjustments in competition with
more specifically pH-adapted microorganisms. This may
explain why there are only few documented examples of
active pH adjustment by organic acid production in
free-living fungi [21,23] and to our knowledge no active
pH regulation by alkaline production has ever been
observed in fungi. This implies that the pH-buffering
characteristics of attine fungus gardens are relatively
unique. Although the chemistry of the garden buffering
mechanism is unknown, its value of ca. 20 mekv/L is
comparable to the pH buffering capacity of human
blood (37 mekv/L; [28]) and much higher than any
value observed outside metazoan bodies - cf. ocean
water with 2.4 mekv/L [29] or soil with 2.2 mekv/L [30].

Fungi normally produce a wide range of proteolytic
enzymes to degrade substrate proteins. The fungal symbionts of lower attines that we investigated (four species
from three different genera) had almost exclusively
metalloproteinase activity, and virtually no serine proteinase activity. The known phylogenies of attine symbionts [4,33,34] (see also Figure 2) indicate that the
lower attine ants rear a paraphyletic group of symbionts
that also includes closely related free-living fungi. This
implies that we expect these symbionts to have similar
enzyme profiles as free-living fungi, which was recently
confirmed over a wide range of garden symbionts by De
Fine Licht et al. [25]. Our observations thus indicate
that the production of metalloproteinases may be an
ancestral trait among the attine ant symbionts and suggest that metalloproteinase activity has been evolutionarily conserved while the pH optimum has shifted (or in
some cases expanded) from values of ca. 6.0 for the
lower attine ant symbionts to values of ca. 5.2 in the
higher attine ant and leaf-cutting ant symbionts, which
coincide with the acid pH that these ants maintain in
their gardens [9,10]. The most parsimonious explanation
for these findings is that the free-living relatives of the
fungal symbionts would also have proteinases with pH
optima of ca. 6, as there seems to be no reason to
assume that initial fungus domestication events happened in very acid forest soils. If anything, the average
free-living Lepiotaceous fungi prefer mull soils with pH
values of at least 6.0 [6]. However, the symbionts of

Semenova et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/15

higher attine and leaf-cutting-ants, which have a long
evolutionary history as domesticated symbionts, the
symbionts of lower attine ants are repeatedly acquired
from free-living populations and would thus have had
much less time to evolve proteinases with adjusted
activity profiles at lower pH.
While metalloproteinase activity appears to be conserved throughout, it appears not to have been upregulated in garden symbionts of basal higher attine ants.
The monophyletic group of fungal symbionts reared by
S. amabilis, T. cf. zeteki and T. sp3, had reduced metalloproteinase activity and significantly enhanced serine
proteinase activity (Figure 2). It has previously been
shown that the enzymatic profiles of attine ant symbionts may have a certain amount of plasticity in
response to the plant substrate that they grow on [35].
However, differences in the properties of proteinases
found in fungal gardens were unlikely to be caused by
variations in food substrate composition, as all lab colonies used in the present study were provided with the
same leaf material. It seems likely therefore, that the
proteinase activity profiles that we obtained have a
significant genetic component. Phylogenies of attine ants
show that S. amabilis is more closely related to T. cf.
zeteki than to T. cornetzi (T Schultz, pers. comm.),
which together with our present results suggests that
these ants may have co-evolved with the proteinase
activity profiles of their cultivars.
Our quantitative analyses showed that the respective
activities of metallo- and serine proteinases in gardens
of higher attine ants (including the leaf-cutting ants)
tend to be negatively correlated (Figure 1). In most symbionts, the split is very pronounced, with almost complete specialization on one of the two classes of
proteinases, although the symbiont of T. cornetzi colony
17 is an exception showing almost equal, intermediate
activities of the two proteinase classes. This suggests
that there may be a trade-off in the expression of proteinases and that there may be adaptive reasons of substrate processing that make the production of either
serine- or metalloproteinases most appropriate. Both
serine proteinases and metalloproteinases are very widespread in nature and are involved in a wide variety of
biological processes. Enzymes belonging to these classes
vary significantly in substrate specificity which may correspond to the requirements of fungal ecological niches
[36]. One explanation for the shift towards almost
exclusive serine proteinase activity might therefore be
that the ants that rear these symbionts forage for leaf
and flower material that can be more effectively
degraded by serine proteinases [37].
Recent studies by Mikheyev et al. [38,34] have shown
that North American Trachymyrmex rear at least four
different species of fungal symbiont, whereas virtually all

Page 7 of 11

leaf-cutting ants throughout Latin America appear to
rear a single species (Leucocoprinus gongylophorus (Möller)
(http://www.indexfungorum.org), which has likely been
derived secondarily no longer than 2-3 million years ago
and swept horizontally through most if not all species of
Acromyrmex and Atta leaf-cutting ants, who themselves
had their last common ancestor 8-12 million years ago
[39]. Whether this selective sweep had any connection
with the symbiont being a strain with upregulated activity
of metalloproteinases is presently unknown, but it would
be of interest if rare leaf-cutting ants could be found that
rear gardens that are more closely related to the serine
protease producing Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex
symbionts.
We have so far assumed that the measured proteinase activities originate from enzymes produced by the
fungal symbiont of the ants. They could also possibly
originate from the additional microorganisms found in
the fungus gardens of attine ants [40-42]. However, as
earlier mentioned [25], the fungal symbiont comprises
by far the largest microbial biomass fraction of gardens, so that contributions from other microorganisms
should be quantitatively negligible unless they would
be specialized symbionts selected for specific enzyme
production (for which there is no indication so far).
Furthermore, we find consistent patterns of proteinase
activity among fungus gardens of the same strain, but
differences between strains, which would imply that
fungal strains should be obligatorily associated with
specific microbial floras if these were to be the predictable sources of the proteinase activities that we measured. Also this would only make sense if these
microbial floras would have coevolved symbiont adaptations with specific functions. We cannot exclude that
such additional symbionts might exist, but find it hard
to base our discussion on such assumption in the
absence of any evidence.
Do leaf-cutting ants suffer from proteinase inhibitors in
the leaves that they cut?

Plants produce substantial amounts of proteinase inhibitors to reduce their nutritional value for herbivores [43],
who in turn have evolved various mechanisms to circumvent such proteinase inhibitors. As herbivory in
attine ants is indirect, it would seem most likely that the
ants have come to rely on their fungal symbiont to
evolve compensatory measures against proteinase inhibitors, but this may not have been an easy process as the
ancestral leucocoprinous fungi that the ants domesticated are leaf litter saprotrophs [6] rather than plant
pathogens, and can thus not be expected to have possessed pre-adaptations that enabled them to easily overcome the defense mechanisms present in live plant
material.

Semenova et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/15

Putative symbiont adaptations to tackle proteinase
inhibitors are unlikely to have arisen in Trachymyrmex
or Sericomyrmex symbionts as these ants mostly use
shed flowers and fragments of fallen leaves that are unlikely to be actively defended [37]. Only the most evolutionary advanced leaf-cutting ants, and in particular the
genus Atta, cut fresh leaves at a large enough scale of
defoliation to encounter significant plant defenses by
proteinase inhibitors. It would thus be interesting to
measure proteinase inhibition in naturally obtained live
plant material that Trachymyrmex, Sericomyrmex, Acromyrmex and Atta workers provide to their symbionts, to
see whether any of these might be specifically targeted
towards either serine- or metalloproteinases.

Conclusions
We have obtained clear indications that the pH optima of
proteinases produced by the fungal symbionts of higher
attine ants and leaf-cutting ants have become adapted to
the acid pH conditions of fungus gardens relative to the
surrounding soil. We have also shown that fungus gardens in general have very high pH buffering capacities,
and that the production of serine- and metalloproteinases
has a distinct phylogenetic pattern, suggesting at least
some form of coevolution with the ant farmers. Our data
further suggest that trade-offs may exist with respect to
the simultaneous production of serine and metalloproteinases across the different species of fungal symbionts.
These results are consistent with the symbiosis being
constrained by nitrogen availability, due to the low N/C
ratio of the plant substrates of fungus gardens [44].
Methods
There are four main catalytic classes of proteolytic
enzymes: aspartic-, cysteine- (thiol-), serine-, and metalloproteinases [45]. It has been inferred that aspartic proteinases are mostly active under acidic pH conditions,
that metallo- and serine proteinases usually work optimally under alkaline conditions, and that cysteine proteinase activity is high over a broader range (pH 4 - 7)
[46]. We compared both the total and the class-specific
proteolytic activity of attine ant symbionts and their
free-living relatives across a gradient of different pH
conditions.
Sample material, fungal tissue extract preparation and
buffering

Colonies of fungus-growing ants Apterostigma collare
(nest number Apcol1), Myrmicocrypta ednaella
(Myred1, Myred2), Mycocepurus smithii (Mycsmi9,
Mycsmi15, Mycsmi32), Cyphomyrmex costatus (Cycos6,
Cycos9, Cycos16), Cyphomyrmex longiscapus (Cylon5,
Cylon12, Cylon24), Sericomyrmex amabilis (Serama7,
Serama8, Serama12), Trachymyrmex cornetzi (Trcor1,

Page 8 of 11

Trcor3, Trcor4, Trcor10), Trachymyrmex sp. 3 (Trsp3-3,
Trsp3-6), Trachymyrmex cf. zeteki (Trzet2, Trzet3,
Trzet6), Acromyrmex echinator (Acech322), Acromyrmex
octospinosus (Acoct367), Atta colombica (Atcol27), Atta
sexdens (Atsex1), and Atta cephalotes (Atcep16) were
collected in Gamboa, Panama and maintained under
standard laboratory conditions at ca. 25°C and 60 - 70%
RH. The ants were supplied with oatmeal (Apterostigma,
Mycocepurus and Cyphomyrmex), oatmeal and fragmented bramble leaves (Myrmicocrypta, Sericomyrmex and
Trachymyrmex) or entire bramble leaves, dry rice and
pieces of apple (Atta and Acromyrmex).
Strains of non-symbiotic fungi Agaricus bisporus,
Pleurotus ostreatus, P. pulmonarous and Lentinula
edodes, which belong to the same fungal order as the
leaf-cutting ant symbiont (Agaricales), were obtained
from the Department of Mycology and Algology, Moscow State University, Russia. Pure cultures of Leucocoprinus gongylophorus were obtained by inoculating
mycelium collected from fungus gardens on potato dextrose agar plates and subsequent incubation at 25°C.
Fungal cultures were maintained on wort-agar medium
and Czapek medium enriched by tryptone (10 g/L) and
peptone (10g/L).
Fungi are known to modify environmental pH by producing pH regulating compounds. To detect whether the
acidity of fungus garden extracts was due to instantaneous acid production or active buffering, we examined
the buffering properties of the extracts. First buffering
abilities of the fungal extracts were determined by mixing
one μl of fungus garden water extract (1 g in 1 ml) with
an equal volume of 0.04 M acid solution (containing
phosphoric, boric and acetic acids) or an alkaline solution
(0.02 M NaOH), and the resulting pH levels were measured as color changes on pH test paper. The resulting
pH change was compared to the pH change obtained
using a control acid solution diluted with an equal
volume of distilled water, or an alkaline solution two
times diluted with distilled water. Next we determined
the buffering capacity of the extracts, and compared it to
the buffering capacity of extracts made from related nonsymbiotic basidiomycete fungi. To measure the approximate buffering capacity of the different fungal species,
one gram of fungal biomass or one gram of fungus garden material was homogenized with a pestle in 1 ml of
distilled water. Samples were centrifuged (5 min, 5200g)
and the supernatant was used for buffer capacity measurements, i.e. the quantity of 1M NaOH that needed to
be added to 1 ml the fungus extract in order to change
the pH of the suspension by one unit.
Proteolytic activity assays

Proteolytic activity was measured spectrophotometrically
using azocasein (Sigma-Aldrich Co) and the chromogenic

Semenova et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/15

p-nitroanilide substrates: Glp-Ala-Ala-Leu-pNa, N-benzoyl-Arg-pNa, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa (prepared
by The State Research Institute of Genetics and Selection of Industrial Microorganisms, Russia). Total and
class-specific proteinase activity towards azocasein was
tested by determining the rate of hydrolysis after
homogenizing pieces of fungus garden material with a
pestle in an Eppendorf tube using 2.5 volumes (w/v) of
distilled water (in order to keep the natural pH of
the sample). Samples were centrifuged at 8000g for 15
minutes and the supernatant transferred to a clean
tube. Ten μl of extract was mixed with 15 μl of 2%
(w/v) azocasein solution and incubated for 1 hour at
26°C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of
120 μl of 10% TCA after which the suspension was
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14000g and 140 μl of
supernatant was added to an equal volume of freshly
prepared NaOH (1M). Absorbance was measured at
440 nm using a VERSA max microplate reader. Reactions in control samples were terminated immediately
after adding azocasein. The difference between treatment and control absorbance (A 440 , at t°C 26°C,
1 hour) was used as a relative measure of enzyme
activity. All measurements were performed four times
producing means that are presented ± SE.
In order to measure class-specific proteinase activity,
the assays were performed in the presence of a protease
inhibitor that specifically targets proteases of a certain
class. The decrease in activity caused by the inhibitor
was used as the class-specific activity value. The inhibition assays were performed using azocasein as described
above. 10 μl of sample was preincubated for 3 hours at
room temperature with 1 μl of inhibitor resulting in the
following final concentrations of the inhibitors (all purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co): For serine proteinase
inhibition we used phenylmethane-sulphonul-fluoride
(PMSF, 0.57 mM), tosyl lysil chlormethyl ketone (TLCK,
10 μM) and tosyl phenilalanine chlormethyl ketone
(TPCK, 10 μM). For cysteine proteinase inhibition we
used L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucyl-amide-4-guanidinobutane (E64, 5 μM). Activity was also measured after
the addition of thyol protecting agent DTT (10mM),
which may increase the activity of cysteine proteinases.
For metalloproteinase inhibition we used ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 8 mM) and for aspartyl proteinase inhibition we used pepstatin (2 μM).
Serine proteinases can be further divided into subclasses based on which substrates they are able to
degrade. To determine which sub-classes of serine proteinases were active in fungal gardens, we measured
activity towards p-nitroanilides after mixing 5 μl of fungal garden extract, 5 μl of substrate (10mg/ml) and 200
μl of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1M) of pH 5.0 or
7.0 and incubating the reaction mixture at 26°C. The

Page 9 of 11

change in absorbance was analyzed using a VERSAmax
microplate reader spectrophotometer at 410 nm. The
linear part of the obtained kinetic curve (the dependence of absorbance on time) was used to calculate the
enzyme activity.
The effect of pH on total and class-specific proteolytic
enzyme activity was measured across a pH range of 3 to
8 (actual measurements at 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.2, 6.0, 7.0, 7.5,
8.0) using 0.2 M Britton - Robinson buffers (A mixture
of 0.4 M phosphoric-, 0.4 M acetic-, and 0.2 M boric
acid was mixed with different quantities of 0.2 M NaOH
to give buffer solutions with the required pH values).
The relatively high molarity of the buffers was used to
make the natural buffering capacity of the extracts negligible compared to the experimentally induced ones.
To measure the pH dependent proteolytic activity of
non-symbiotic fungi, culture fluid of A. bisporus was
used. Modified Czapek medium (0.7 g KH 2PO 4 , 0.3 g
K2HPO4·3H2O, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g FeSO4·7H2O,
23.3 g casein in 1 L H2O) was inoculated with mycelium
from seven days old plated fungus culture and incubated
for six days on a rotary shaker (130 rpm, 24°C). Culture
liquid was centrifuged (14000g, 20 min) and filtered
through filter paper. After adding sodium azide (8%
water solution, 2.5 μl to 1 ml of culture liquid) to prevent contamination, fifty μl of culture liquid was mixed
with 100 μl of Britton - Robinson buffer (0.1M, pH
range from 3 to 8; actual measurements at 3, 4, 5, 5.2,
6, 7, 7.5, 8) and 150 μl of 0.5% water azocasein solution.
Reactions were kept overnight (37°C) because of relatively low enzyme activity and then terminated by adding 300 μl of 10% TCA. The reactions were placed at 4°
C for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20 min (5200g).
400 μl of suspension was mixed with an equal volume
of freshly prepared NaOH (0.5 M) and absorbance at
440 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer
(Genesys 10 - UV). The reactions of the control samples
were terminated with TCA immediately after adding
azocasein. The difference between the absorbance of the
treatment and control samples was used as a relative
measure of enzyme activity. All measurements were performed three times and presented as means ± SE. Classspecific proteinase activity pH optima were measured in
the presence of a protease inhibitors PMSF and EDTA
as described above.
Proteolytic activities were finally compared across the
different stages of advancement of the symbiosis (lower
attine ants, higher attine ants, leaf-cutting ants).
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequencing of the LSU rRNA gene and the Elongation
Factor 1-alpha gene of the fungal symbionts was done
by extracting DNA by the Chelex method [47]. Small
amounts of fungal tissue were ground in 200 μl of 10%

Semenova et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:15
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/15

Chelex-100 and heated for 15 min at 95°C. The samples
were centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000g after which 1 μl
of supernatant was used for PCR. The primer pair LR0R
5’-ACC CGC TGA ACT TAA GC-3’ and LR5 5’-TCC
TGA GGG AAA CTT CG-3’ was used to amplify a fragment of the LSU rRNA gene of about 920 bps, using the
following PCR scheme: one cycle of 95°C for 5 min,
then 35 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec, 56°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 1.5 min, ending with one cycle of 72°C for 7
min. The primer pair EF1a-F 5’-GTT GCT GTC AAC
AAG ATG GAC ACT AC-3’. [48] and EF1a-R5 5’-CAG
GCA ATG TGG GCT GTG TGA CAA TC-3’ was used
to amplify a fragment of the Elongation factor 1-alpha
gene of about 820 bps, using a PCR scheme similar to
the one above, although for some of the samples the
annealing temperature had to be decreased to 50°C in
order to obtain a PCR product. PCR products were
sequenced by Eurofins MWG Operon. Nucleotide
sequence data are deposited in GenBank with Accession
Numbers HQ191224-HQ191277.
The gene sequences were aligned with Clustal W [49],
and after deletion of regions that could not be unambiguously aligned, a phylogeny was constructed by maximum-likelihood PhyML-aLRT [50]. The nucleotide
substitution model was GTR [51] and the transition/
transversion ratios, the proportion of invariable sites and
the Gamma distribution parameter were estimated by
maximizing the likelihood of the phylogeny. The substitution rate category was set to four, and the input tree
to be refined by the maximum-likelihood algorithm was
set to BIONJ. The aLRT statistics were performed using
the non-parametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. Two of the fungal colonies (Trsp3-6 Trzet6) died
during the experiment, so that only the LSU gene could
be used for these two samples when constructing the
phylogenetic tree.
