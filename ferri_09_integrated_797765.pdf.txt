Abstract
Background: We compared here the suitability and efficacy of traditional morphological approach
and DNA barcoding to distinguish filarioid nematodes species (Nematoda, Spirurida). A reliable and
rapid taxonomic identification of these parasites is the basis for a correct diagnosis of important
and widespread parasitic diseases. The performance of DNA barcoding with different parameters
was compared measuring the strength of correlation between morphological and molecular
identification approaches. Molecular distance estimation was performed with two different
mitochondrial markers (coxI and 12S rDNA) and different combinations of data handling were
compared in order to provide a stronger tool for easy identification of filarioid worms.
Results: DNA barcoding and morphology based identification of filarioid nematodes revealed high
coherence. Despite both coxI and 12S rDNA allow to reach high-quality performances, only coxI
revealed to be manageable. Both alignment algorithm, gaps treatment, and the criteria used to
define the threshold value were found to affect the performance of DNA barcoding with 12S rDNA
marker. Using coxI and a defined level of nucleotide divergence to delimit species boundaries, DNA
barcoding can also be used to infer potential new species.
Conclusion: An integrated approach allows to reach a higher discrimination power. The results
clearly show where DNA-based and morphological identifications are consistent, and where they
are not. The coherence between DNA-based and morphological identification for almost all the
species examined in our work is very strong. We propose DNA barcoding as a reliable, consistent,
and democratic tool for species discrimination in routine identification of parasitic nematodes.

Background
The identification of living species is one of the major
goals of modern biology. Species can be delimited only in
relation to other species, it is trivial, but many discriminators and species concepts can be used for this purpose.
Molecular data have become widely used to aid rapid
assessment of species diversity, and the DNA barcoding
initiative [1] is one prominent line of research within this
field, coordinated by the Consortium for the Barcode of
Life (CBoL, http://barcoding.si.edu). DNA barcoding
involves rapid sequencing of one or a few genes from several representatives of a species, as well as comparisons of
these sequences within and between species. The method
has revealed examples of cryptic species diversity in various taxa [2,3]. DNA barcoding aims at the development of
a universal, standardized and economical tool, but the
fear is that to gain a sufficient accuracy the sampling
should be massive, and, accordingly, the PCR and
sequencing efforts expensive. Finding a balance between
standardization, low costs and accuracy is difficult, and
researchers have to take key decisions on the level of accuracy they want to get and the costs they can reasonably
sustain.
A major strength of DNA barcoding is that it allows correlating any life stages of a living organism, or also a small
part of it, to a single molecular entity (Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit, MOTU; sensu Floyd et al. [4] and
does not necessarily require taxonomy skilled personnel,
at least in the step of the molecular data generation, to be
used in the analysis. Nevertheless, the power and pitfalls
of the DNA barcoding approach have not yet been fully
evaluated. In particular, the proper methods to analyse
DNA barcoding data are still under study (e.g. see the
progress at CBoL working groups, http://www.bolin
fonet.org/casestudy/index.php/browse).
coxI sequences are widely used for DNA barcoding of
metazoans, but several markers have been proposed as
putative barcodes [5,6] and different authors underline
the importance of a DNA barcoding approach based on
multiple markers [7,8]. Ribosomal mitochondrial genes
are often used as alternatives to coxI marker for different
reasons: easy to amplify, good source of synapomorphies
in loop regions and abundance of sequences in databases
[8-10].
Predicted problems in DNA barcoding studies include:
poor taxonomy (e.g. single species misidentified as two or
more species and viceversa); insufficient sampling within a
taxon, or insufficient sampling of taxa (see for instance
[11] and consequent criticisms in [12-14]); polyphyletic
or paraphyletic species [15].
This work focuses on an integrated approach at the identification of a group of nematodes, belonging to the order

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/1

Spirurida, which includes the relevant superfamily Filarioidea. Several species of filarioid nematodes are agents of
tropical diseases both for human and other animals of
economical value. All the filarioids are transmitted
through haematophagous vectors in which they span different juvenile stages [16-18]. The identification of these
juvenile stages is a necessary condition for establishing the
potential of transmission in endemic areas but it is difficult, due to the small size of the juvenile stages (about 1
mm) and paucity of characters. Identification of juvenile
stages is also useful to detect any possible emergent
zoonotic filarial disease at its beginning. Laboratories typically deals with fragments of parasitic nematodes recovered from host tissues, or with specimens representing a
single developmental stage, and the diagnostic characters
are often not present in these pieces of worms.
The identification of filarioid and related nematodes via
DNA barcoding is an ambitious and desirable goal for
many reasons: 1) a fast identification engine, available
not only for taxonomists, but validated by them, is useful
for quicker diagnoses of filariasis; 2) filarioids cause diseases of high relevance in medical and veterinary fields
throughout the world; 3) DNA barcoding can be useful for
those cases of difficult or impossible identification by traditional procedures, such as co-infections with more than
one filarioid species (e.g. Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa;
see [19]); 4) parasites conferred to diagnostic laboratories
are often of poor quality due to the difficult of sampling
adults and undamaged organisms; 5) the model of filarioid nematodes being based on a very good classical taxonomy (starting from [20]) allow to avoid (as much as
possible) problems of 'bad taxonomy' (see discussion in
[15]); 6) DNA barcoding can offer a reliable method for
the identification of filarioid nematodes in vectors, allowing widespread campaigns of epidemiological surveys; 7)
nematode biodiversity is still highly underestimated both
at the morphological and molecular level [21], and a
molecular approach will speed up the estimation of this
taxonomic diversity [3].
Despite molecular data from representatives of filarioids
and deposited in public databases are quite abundant for
species of medical or veterinary relevance, very few DNA
barcodes are available if compared with other taxa of similar dimensions; this is mostly caused by the difficulties of
sampling many species of parasitic nematodes. Most of
these DNA sequences are relative to mitochondrial genes,
in particular 12S rDNA and coxI [9,22].
Here we present a double approach (morphological and
molecular) to the taxonomic identification of filarioids
and related nematodes on the widest (in term of species
number) molecular collection of these parasites ever
achieved. Morphological identification was performed by
well known international experts, whilst molecular disPage 2 of 12

tance estimation was performed with two different mitochondrial markers (coxI and 12S rDNA) and under
different combinations of data handling (see below). The
performance of DNA barcoding with different parameters
was compared measuring the strength of correlation
between morphological and molecular identification
approaches. In order to provide a useful tool for easy identification of filarioid nematodes this work aims to answer
the following questions: 1) which is the performance of
DNA barcoding on filarioids and related nematodes? 2)
which is the better marker (between coxI and 12S rDNA)
for identification these organisms at the species level? 3)
can DNA barcoding be a useful tool for detection of putative new species?

Methods
Biological samples, DNA extractions, PCR conditions,
DNA sequencing and accession numbers
Filarioids and related nematodes belong to the order
Spirurida, a group of heteroxenic parasites with arthropod
intermediate hosts [20,23]. In vertebrate definitive hosts,
they are found in the digestive tract or in other different
tissues, from the lymphatic to blood vessels and heart
chambers, from abdominal and thoracic cavities to skin
and subcutaneous tissues. Well preserved biological samples are not easily obtained for these parasites, since dissection of vertebrate hosts is generally required for
collection. We emphasize that most of the specimens for
which we generated DNA sequences derive from wild naturally infected hosts, and most of the samples have been
recovered at necropsy. In spite of these difficulties, we
have included in this study the most important filarioid
parasites of humans and other animals, including
Onchocerca volvulus, agent of human river blindness,
Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, agents of human
tropical elephantiasis, Loa loa, agent of human ocular
filariasis, Dirofilaria immitis, agent of heartworm disease of
dogs and cats, plus a collection of specimens recovered
from the tissues of wild animals such as bats, ungulates,
monkeys, tropical toads, reptiles and birds, collected all
around the world (see Table 1 for a summary of the species considered in this study; for further details on these
organisms see additional file 1: 'Investigated specimens').

All the biological material analysed have been stored following the procedures specified in the Biorepositories initiative http://www.biorepositories.org and belong to the
collection identified as ':zpl' of MIB institution (which
represents a confirmed record at Biorepositories initiative). Details on parasite species included in this work are
given in additional file 1: 'Investigated specimens'
DNA extraction procedures, PCR conditions and sequencing of amplified DNA fragments were performed follow-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/1

ing standard procedures (details are found in the
additional file 2: 'Experimental conditions'). Primers used
for amplification are: coxI: coIintF and coIintR [22]; 12S
rDNA: 12SF and 12SR [9]. The sequences generated have
been deposited in the EMBL Data Library according to the
EBI Barcoding Procedure (see details available at http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Documentation/
Barcode_submission.html) under the following accessions: coxI: [GenBank:AM749226–AM749298, GenBank:AM886173]; 12S rDNA: [GenBank:AM779769–
AM779855]. The detailed list of accession numbers is
found in the additional file 1: 'Investigated specimens'.
The datasets have been deposited in EMBL data alignment
under the following accessions: coxI alignment [GenBank:ALIGN_001178]; 12S rDNA alignment: [GenBank:ALIGN_001179].
The morphological identification procedure
For species identification, a morphological anatomical
analysis is performed with worms cleared in lactophenol
and using an optical microscope equipped with a camera
lucida. The characters studied have been validated since
years [24] and are the basis of the key of identification
[20]. They include the measurements, the number and
disposition of the sensory papillae on head and male tail,
the different parts of the digestive tract and of the genital
apparatus. A series of other characters have been introduced for precise identification; these are thought to be
important during mating and able to discriminate close
species: the cuticular ornamentation of male posterior
region, or area rugosa, which acts as anti-slit system; the
spicule distal extremities; the muscular-hypodermal anatomy. In filarioids, the first stage larva or microfilaria is a
good discriminative character and is particularly studied:
specimens are fixed in extension and measured; the
cephalic hook and other cuticular head ornamentation
are analysed as well as caudal extremity. For the correct
observation of many characters manipulations are necessary: dissection of spicules and ovijector, head cut and orientation in front view, etc. (see [25-27]).
Definition of molecular datasets
The DNA sequences used in this study were obtained by
direct sequencing of PCR products or collected from GenBank; only sequences meeting a priory defined criteria of
length, position, similarity and taxonomy were analysed.
Each DNA sequence analysed belong to one of the four
following groups: (1) sequences originated from organisms morphologically identified by international experts
of our group; (2) sequences collected from GenBank and
morphologically identified by international experts not
affiliated to our group; (3) sequences originated from
organisms collected by our group and morphologically

the standard marker coxI two datasets called A and B have
been produced.
Dataset A encompasses only sequences derived from specimens for which morphological identification was sure
(cases 1 and 2) and was used to test the coherence
between morphological and molecular approaches following a 'classical' DNA barcoding analysis: generation of

a Kimura 2-parameters (K2P; [28]) distance graph and
cumulative error plots. coxI dataset A includes 151
sequences 627 bp long representing 46 morpho-species
(with an average of 3.3 specimens per species; standard
deviation 3.4; range: 1–20).
Dataset B encompasses all coxI sequences available (cases
1, 2, 3 and 4) and was used for standard DNA barcoding
analyses with the most comprehensive dataset (we underlined that this dataset contains also sequences derived
from morphologically undetermined organisms. coxI
dataset B includes 168 sequences 630 bp long (gaps are
taken into account).
Finally, two datasets identified as as type C (one relative
to coxI and one relative to 12S rDNA) encompass
sequences derived from organisms belonging to cases 1
and 2 and for which both genes were available. These two
types of C datasets were used to compare the molecular
identification performance of different markers, and of
different data handling. The two datasets C include 86
sequences (coxI are 627 bp long; 12S rDNA are 643 bp
long including gaps) representing 44 morpho-species
(with an average of 2.0 specimens per species; standard
deviation 1.5; range: 1–6).
DNA barcoding analyses
In order to evaluate the performance of the DNA barcoding approach performed on filarioid nematodes, the
degree of correlation between the species identification
based on morphology and on molecular divergences was
measured. This test was developed for the mitochondrial
gene coxI on the widest molecular dataset of filarioid nematodes identified by morphological experts (dataset A).

Intraspecific, interspecific, overall mean K2P distances
[28] and relative standard errors were calculated with
MEGA 4.1 [29] – options = Kimura 2-parameters, pairwise
deletion.
Typical DNA barcoding analyses are based on the comparison between intraspecific and interspecific distribution of
nucleotide divergence that allow the inference of a molecular threshold to help taxonomic decision. Based on this
approach two kinds of error can occur. Type I errors (false
positive) occur when co-specific specimens show a genetic
distance greater than threshold value. In contrast, type II
errors (false negative) occur when genetic distance minor
to the threshold value is found between different species.
Cumulative error plots show the error rates generated by
both type I and type II errors based on different values of
threshold [14]. In this context, the threshold value relative
to the minor rate of cumulative error is called optimum

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/1

threshold (OT). When not a single value, but a range of
threshold values is relative to the same minimum cumulative error, the formal OT is calculated as the average
value of the range. Differently, a standard threshold (ST)
value was calculated as 10 times the mean intraspecific
variability according to Hebert et al. [11]. Cumulative
error rates relative to ST and OT were also compared.
DNA taxonomy analyses
According to Lefebure et al. [8] we will refer to the terms
DNA barcoding and DNA taxonomy respectively for: 1)
identification of organisms based on DNA sequence variability and assignment to a certain species previously
described; 2) prediction and classification of new taxa
using DNA.

On the bases of the results obtained with dataset A, the OT
generated has been used to perform DNA barcoding and
DNA taxonomy approaches on dataset B.
The resulting K2P distance matrix has been used: 1) to
infer MOTUs delimited by OT; 2) to analyse the MOTU
composition testing the congruence with previously
described species (DNA barcoding); 3) to perform prediction and classification of potentially new taxa (DNA taxonomy).
A phenetic tree was also generated for type B dataset of
coxI marker using MEGA 4.0 [29] – options = tree inference method: neighbor-joining; phylogeny test and
options: bootstrap (100 replicates); gaps/missing data:
pairwise deletion; codon positions: 1st+2nd+3rd+noncoding; substitution model: K2P; substitutions to include:
transitions + transversions; pattern among lineages: same
(homogeneous); rates among sites: uniform rates.
MOTUs previously identified from K2P distance matrix
have been showed on the tree with squared brackets.
Differential performance of DNA barcoding
Different works show the importance of a proper data
management (from the choice of alignment software to
the gap treatment) in the context of DNA barcoding analyses (see for instance [30]). The relevance of a DNA barcoding approach based on multiple marker is also
underlined by different authors [7,8].

In this work we compared the performance of DNA barcoding performed with different combination of data
handling and with different DNA barcodes. The performance comparison was based on the measure of the
strength of correlation between morphological and
molecular approaches (cumulative error rates were compared).

In this connection homologous DNA sequences of coxI
and 12S rDNA type C datasets were aligned with two different multiple alignment software: MUSCLE [31] –
default options – and ClustalX [32] – default options.
Alignments were hand corrected with BioEdit [33] in
order to discard the terminal misalignments and were
pruned to 627 bp for coxI and 643 bp for 12S rDNA (gaps
included). K2P distances [28] were calculated with two
different applications, and the gaps were treated in two
different ways: MEGA [29] – options = Kimura 2-parameters, both pairwise deletion and complete deletion were
set in separate runs – and TREECON [34] – options =
Kimura 2-parameters, both 'not take into account' and
'take into account' were set in separate runs. K2P distance
graph and cumulative error plots were produced for the
sixteen combination of software/parameters tested on two
type C datasets. A schematic representation of the different approaches used is illustrated in Table 2. Intraspecific,
interspecific, overall mean K2P distances [28] and relative
standard errors were calculated for coxI and 12S rDNA
datasets (after alignment with MUSCLE) with MEGA 4.1
[29] – options = Kimura 2-parameters, pairwise deletion.

Results
Morphological identification
A total of 89 specimens collected from 21 localities have
been analysed by morphological experts. 76 specimens
have been identified as 28 morpho-species, belonging to
12 genera, while 11 specimens (forming 5 distinguishable
morphological groups) have not been assigned, at this
level of the work, to any described species.
Analyses on the molecular datasets
The datasets generated in this work comprise a total of
254 gene sequences, 141 of which were produced in this

study (for details see additional file 1: 'Investigated specimens'). For a total of 11 morphologically identified species, the DNA gene sequences here reported represent the
first entries in GenBank.
DNA barcoding: coherence between molecular and
morphological identifications
The multiple alignment of coxI gene sequences forming
dataset A presents no insertion/deletion (indels). coxI
mean nucleotide distance within species is 0.5% (standard error: 0.6%; range: 0 – 2.4%); coxI mean nucleotide
distance between species is 16.2% (standard error: 3.7%;
range: 0 – 27.8%); coxI overall mean diversity is 16.0%
(standard error: 1.0%).

Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of intraspecific
and interspecific genetic divergences in coxI dataset A. An
overlap between the two distributions is observable at values minor to 2%. Since some interspecific divergences are
as low as 0% it is not possible to set any threshold value
that allow to exclude false negatives (type II errors).
The minimum cumulative error is 0.62% (see Figure 1) at
a threshold level of 4.8% (OT). ST (10 times intraspecific
mean divergence) assumes the value of 5.0% and generates the same cumulative error (0.62%). As shown in K2P
distance graph (Figure 2), using OT or ST, no overlap of
intraspecific and interspecific nucleotide divergence
occurs at distance values greater than threshold values
(hence no false positive occur, type I errors). In contrast,
as stated before, at distance values lower than OT or ST, a
degree of overlap is observable (false negatives, type II
errors). This percentage of false negatives (that represents
the overall amount of cumulative error) are generated by
two couples of congeneric species: 1) O. volvulus and O.

ochengi (mean interspecific distance is 1.9%); 2) C. bulboidea and C. longa (mean interspecific distance is 0.2%). If
O. volvulus and C. bulboidea are discarded from dataset, no
overlap between intraspecific and interspecific distributions are observable, and the OT allows to reach 0% of
cumulative error. In summary, identification based on
molecular divergence threshold for coxI is coherent with
morphological approach for 44 species out of 46.
DNA taxonomy: a direct application of DNA barcoding
Sequences in dataset B (that encompasses all of the coxI
sequences of filarioid nematodes provided by GenBank)
were used to generate a new K2P distance matrix. This has
been used to identify the MOTUs whose boundaries are
delimited by the OT value (4.8%) calculated at previous
point. This approach was used to reach two different purposes: DNA barcoding (MOTUs composition were
checked to correspond to previously identified species)
and DNA taxonomy (which allow to identify potentially
new species). 51 MOTUs were identified: 46 belong to
species previously described, and five belong to not morphologically identified organisms (potentially non
described species) of filarioid nematodes.

Molecular cryptic species (complexes composed by different morpho-species grouped into single MOTUs) are still
present: all of the sequences of C. bulboidea and C. longa

form a single MOTU and all of the sequences of O. volvulus
and O. ochengi form also a single MOTU. This result is
concordant with the results obtained from dataset A.
The five unidentified MOTUs encompass specimens collected from avian and mammals hosts. Three out of these
contain specimens collected from African mammals (Oryx
gazella, Redunca fulvorufula and Equus zebra hartmannae)
and the remaining two contain specimens collected from
three bird species (Sitta europea, Paradoxornis webbianus
and Sturnus vulgaris). Despite a phenetic tree is not the
most important output of a DNA barcoding analysis, it
can be used to show clearly the pattern of MOTUs composition. For this reason, we provided a NJ tree for dataset B
with MOTUs delimited by squared brackets (see additional file 3: 'NJ tree').
DNA barcoding performance: comparison of different
markers and different data handling
Type C datasets were built with sequences deriving from
the same specimens in order to allow the comparison of
the performances of different markers and different data
managements. The performances were evaluated calculating the minimum cumulative error (MCE) rate relative to
both optimum threshold and standard threshold values.
The lesser the MCE, the better is the performance.

K2P distance graph of coxI filarioid nematodes
K2P distance graph of coxI filarioid nematodes. Frequency distribution of intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergences in morphologically identified filarioid nematodes. Graph shows 877 intraspecific and 21775 interspecific comparisons
across 46 filarioid species. Distances were generated after alignment with MUSCLE, and calculated with MEGA (pairwise deletion), using Kimura's two parameter substitution model.

The multiple alignment of coxI gene sequences (dataset
type C) presents no indels. coxI mean nucleotide distance
within species is 0.5% (standard error: 0.5%; range: 0 –
2.0%); coxI mean nucleotide distance between species is
15.5% (standard error: 3.7%; range: 0.2 – 27.8%); coxI
overall mean diversity is 15.0% (standard error: 1.0%).
As expected, the multiple alignment of 12S rDNA gene
sequences (dataset type C) shows several indels, which
were in most cases concentrated in the variable regions.
12S rDNA mean nucleotide distance within species is
2.2% (standard error: 1.7%; range: 0 – 6.0%); 12S rDNA
mean nucleotide distance between species is 17.4%
(standard error: 4.2%; range: 0.2 – 34.5%); 12S rDNA
overall mean diversity is 17.0% (standard error: 1.1%).

ST assume very similar values, and the rates of MCE relative to the different thresholds are the same (see Table 2).
Differently, using 12S rDNA, the eight different combinations of data handling show rates of MCE remarkably different indicating that the performance of DNA barcoding
with the marker 12S rDNA is very susceptible to different
data handling. With this marker, OT and ST assume very
different values, and the performance of DNA barcoding
with the two thresholds is extremely dissimilar (mean
MCE relative to OT is 0.7%; mean MCE relative to ST is
50.5%).

Based on MCE (relative to OT) rate comparison, the two
DNA barcodes used show different performances (mean
MCE for coxI is 0.3% and mean MCE for 12S rDNA is 0.7%).

Interestingly, the two markers show very different manageability: coxI has revealed to be less susceptible than 12S
rDNA to changes in alignment algorithm, software used
for distance estimation, and gap treatment. The lower
manageability observed for the marker 12S rDNA is certainly caused by the presence of numerous indels.

Using the marker coxI, the eight different combinations of
data handling show the same value of MCE indicating
that the performance of DNA barcoding with the marker
coxI is not susceptible to the tested data handling. OT and

Also for datasets C, the errors of DNA barcoding performed with the better data handling are all attributable
to false negatives and are relative to the couples of species:
O. volvulus and O. ochengi; C. bulboidea and C. longa.

Discussion
On type A dataset a really good discrimination level is
achievable, with 44 species out of 46 identifiable via DNA
barcoding. For two couples of species, the interspecific
divergence is less than the optimal threshold and hence
two morpho-species of filarioid nematodes are not
resolved by DNA barcoding approach. These two species
belong to Onchocerca and Cercopithifilaria genus. Despite
O. volvulus and O. ochengi are easily identified based on
morphology and host specificity, their nucleotide divergence is quite low (mean interspecific divergence 1.9%).
If O. volvulus infects human patients only in Africa (originally) and South America (following the transatlantic
slave trade) and O. ochengi infects only cattles, the two
species could derive from a recent speciation event [35].
This event could decrease the resolution power of DNA
barcoding.
Another putative recent speciation has been proposed for
two species of Cercopithifilaria genus (C. longa and C. bulboidea), showing a mean interspecific divergence of 0.2%.
These parasites are restricted to two Japanese mammals
(Naemorhaedus crispus and Cervus nippon), and a recent
speciation event has also been hypothesized using both
molecular and morphological data [27,36]. It should be
noted that these evolutionary dynamics are often difficult
to identify as reported in [37].
Dataset B (that encompasses all the coxI sequences of filarioid nematodes available in GenBank) has been used to
perform DNA barcoding and DNA taxonomy with a treebased method. Coherently with the results obtained with
dataset A, this phenetic approach shows a clear separation
of MOTUs representing separated groups of morpho-species with the exception of O. volvulus-O. ochengi and C. bulboidea-C. longa. Anyway, closely related species could be
characterized by a certain level of interspecific hybridization, because the reproductive isolation could not be total
since the very beginning of the natural history of a species.
These effects are particularly evident in mitochondrial
gene trees, and represent a serious problem for DNA barcoding (at least in most metazoans, for which mitochondrial markers are widely used). Problems of this nature are
likely to have occurred in the O. volvulus-O. ochengi and C.
bulboidea-C. longa cases where traditional taxonomy identified good species [27,38]. As a consequence, the usage of
a tree-based method alone for species identification could
be dangerous and deceptive. Moreover, in a gene tree, a
'true' species may be wrongly represented by a paraphyletic group of alleles/haplotypes, due to introgression
or incomplete lineage sorting (see [15]). In such cases, the
gene tree could appear misleading or uninformative about
the species identification because of retention, and consequent random sorting, of ancestral polymorphisms.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/1

It is important to underline that GenBank entries are not
absolutely free from identification errors. The results of
DNA barcoding analyses performed on coxI sequences
obtained from GenBank (dataset B) do not show such
type of problem. However, an example of error is represented by the entry [GenBank:AY462911] identified as
Litomosoides carinii. This species parasites sciurids in Brazil
[39] and was described by Travassos in 1916. The congeneric species Litomosoides sigmodontis was described by
Chandler in 1931, parasites the murid Sigmodon hispidus,
and is spread worldwide in the laboratories as model species for the studies on filarioses. For some reasons there is
the tendency to confound these two clearly distinct species, and it is relatively common to observe the erroneous
name L. carinii used instead of L. sigmodontis for laboratory strains of these filariods. In this context, it should be
noted that basically all the results on L. sigmodontis published till now are relative to these laboratory strains
established since 1970s. Here we present a molecular
identification of L. sigmodontis directly collected from wild
hosts. Laboratory strains and wild specimens show no
molecular differences.
The five unidentified MOTUs present in dataset B encompass parasites of three avian hosts, a taxonomic group
where biodiversity and distribution of filarial nematodes
are underestimated. As described above, these are cases
where molecular analysis can help to discover new species
(DNA taxonomy).
It must be underlined that DNA taxonomy performed
with simple molecular data can only suggest the presence
of potential new species, whose real existence must be corroborated by integrated approaches [40].
Type C datasets reveal that two different markers have
similar discrimination power, but if coxI shows high manageability in data handling, the marker 12S rDNA is more
susceptible to the data handling (especially in gap treatment). Processing 12S rDNA type C dataset with MUSCLE
and MEGA (pairwise deletion), DNA barcoding performs
6.3 time better than using MUSCLE and MEGA (complete
deletion). In addition, processing 12S rDNA type C dataset with MUSCLE it is possible to obtain 0.3% of MCE (see
Table 2), whilst using ClustalX, it is possible to obtain
0.4% of MCE (see Table 2). This is a quite relevant observation: the generation of a reliable alignment is a major
impediment limiting the use of 12S rDNA gene sequences
for barcoding purposes. For this reason, Chu et al. [41]
have proposed to use ribosomal DNA sequences for DNA
barcoding without performing an alignment, showing
congruence between their approach and a tree reconstruction (based on neighbour-joining algorithm). Anyway,
12S rDNA offers practical benefits: it is much shorter com-

pared with coxI, and therefore more likely to be readily
amplified from chemically damaged (i.e. formalin fixed)
or badly conserved specimens [9].
It is important to underline that the presence of nuclear
mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts [42]) could introduce serious ambiguity into DNA barcoding and their
presence cannot be known a priori [43]. In nematodes,
numts seems to be rare [42], despite their presence has
been reported (see for example [44] were a short fragment
of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA of W. bancrofti included
into the nuclear LDR region is used for the screening of
this parasite). In our study, the results of BLAST search,
multiple alignment analyses and the quality of trace files
for bidirectional processing of our sequences seems to
exclude any interference caused by numts.
Our results indicate that the proposal to use the ST (10
times intraspecific variability) as described in [11] must
be evaluated case by case. Indeed, in the case of coxI, the
OT is equivalent to ST (both the thresholds generate the
same value of MCE), but for 12S rDNA OT performs
extremely better than ST (mean MCE relative to OT is
0.7%, mean MCE relative to ST is 50.5%). The extremely
high values of MCE relative to ST are caused by the moderately high intraspecific K2P distances of the marker 12S
rDNA that are enhanced of a 10 times magnitude. The
data handling has also a relevant effect on the mean
intraspecific divergence: MUSCLE, TREECON and considering gaps are all alternatives that enhance K2P distances.
The sampling of filarioid nematodes is clearly not exhaustive and particularly difficult, due to complications associated with their collection (i.e. recovery at necropsy in
most of the cases), that requires highly skilled personnel
and enduring logistic efforts all over the world. The datasets presented encompass also species for which only one
sequence is available. This is a circumstance that avoid to
evaluate the intraspecific variability of the marker, and
consequently the discrimination power of the method
decreases. However, we want to remark the importance of
the datasets here reported: filarioid nematodes represent a
relevant neglected, vector-borne, tropical diseases.

Conclusion
DNA barcoding represents a powerful tool for taxonomy,
but without the integration of traditional approaches
could become a simple collection of MOTUs. Recent studies showed that different approaches to species recognition can generate similar results, encountering the favour
of scientific community [45] suggesting that an integrated
approach to species recognition is a possibility [46]. In
our opinion, the establishment, improvement and maintenance of DNA barcoding as a taxonomic tool will
require a long-lasting interaction between traditional tax-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/1

onomy and DNA-based approaches. In this work traditional and molecular approaches have been considered as
an integrated method for achieving the goal of species
identification.
DNA barcoding is a good method for taxonomical identification of filarioid nematodes, and it has shown a high
coherence with classical taxonomy. The results of the integrated approach to species identification clearly show
where DNA-based and morphological identifications are
consistent, and where they are not.
This study suggests that both coxI and 12S rDNA appear to
be appropriate molecular markers for identification of
filarioid nematodes at species level via DNA barcoding.
More in detail, the results of DNA barcoding has been
shown to be more consistent under different data handling when performed with coxI than 12S rDNA. On the
opposite, 12S rDNA is less manageable, but it is easier to
amplify than coxI.
The threshold value proposed by Hebert (10 times mean
intraspecific divergence) [1] has revealed to be applicable
for coxI, and not for 12S rDNA. In the case of coxI, the
threshold value 4.8% can also be used to separate potentially new filarioid species. We conclude that nucleotide
sequences of coxI from filarioids are of high interest for
species identification throughout DNA barcoding.
Despite the databases here reported encompass only few
specimens of medical interests, they represent a useful
starting point for rapid identification of these parasites
and for applications such as epidemiological surveys and
populational dynamics.
Using coxI with a threshold that minimise the error rate,
all of the filarial nematodes involved in medical or veterinarian context (with the exception of O. volvulus and O.
ochengi) can be coherently identified as morphological
(species) and molecular entities (MOTUs). Finally, it
should be noted that the two approaches for species identification (i.e. morphological and molecular) are not consistent at 100%. This is not unexpected, both methods are
susceptible to different bias: sibling species, morphological polymorphisms, introgression and coalescence can,
for instance, confound identifications. One way to seriously cope with these difficulties is to follow the cross
control given by different approaches (for works about
integrated taxonomy see [8,40]). The possibility to identify how and where the different approaches are not
coherent can be the first step for developing of a true integrated approach to taxonomy.
