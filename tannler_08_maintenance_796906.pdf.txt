Abstract
Background: Selection of an appropriate host organism is crucial for the economic success of
biotechnological processes. A generally important selection criterion is a low maintenance energy
metabolism to reduce non-productive consumption of substrate. We here investigated, whether
various bacilli that are closely related to Bacillus subtilis are potential riboflavin production hosts
with low maintenance metabolism.
Results: While B. subtilis exhibited indeed the highest maintenance energy coefficient, B.
licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens exhibited only statistically insignificantly reduced maintenance
metabolism. Both B. pumilus and B. subtilis (natto) exhibited irregular growth patterns under glucose
limitation such that the maintenance metabolism could not be determined. The sole exception with
significantly reduced maintenance energy requirements was the B. licheniformis strain T380B. The
frequently used spo0A mutation significantly increased the maintenance metabolism of B. subtilis.
At the level of 13C-detected intracellular fluxes, all investigated bacilli exhibited a significant flux
through the pentose phosphate pathway, a prerequisite for efficient riboflavin production. Different
from all other species, B. subtilis featured high respiratory tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes in batch
and chemostat cultures. In particular under glucose-limited conditions, this led to significant excess
formation of NADPH of B. subtilis, while anabolic consumption was rather balanced with catabolic
NADPH formation in the other bacilli.
Conclusion: Despite its successful commercial production of riboflavin, B. subtilis does not seem
to be the optimal cell factory from a bioenergetic point of view. The best choice of the investigated
strains is the sporulation-deficient B. licheniformis T380B strain. Beside a low maintenance energy
coefficient, this strain grows robustly under different conditions and exhibits only moderate acetate
overflow, hence making it a promising production host for biochemicals and riboflavin in particular.

Background
Optimal choice of the host organism for cell factory engineering is pivotal to the economic success of biotechnological processes. Typical host selection criteria are
available genetic tools and methods, safety status, genome
annotation, well-characterized process characteristics and
scale-up behavior. For many products, in particular for

bulk chemicals, cellular energetics is another key criterion
whose impact becomes most relevant in near optimized
processes [1]. In particular in the frequently employed
fed-batch processes, where the production phase is prolonged by controlled feeding of the growth-limiting substrate, cells are placed in the domain of slow growth [2].
During this phase, cells devote increasing percentages of

the consumed energy substrate not only for growth and
product formation, but also for maintaining cellular
homeostasis [3]. The relevant physiological parameter is
the maintenance energy coefficient that specifies the
amount of energy cells required for maintaining homeostasis in the absence of growth [4]. For optimal design of
fed-batch processes with extended slow-growth conditions, choice of cell factories with appropriate cellular
energetics and low maintenance energy coefficient thus
becomes increasingly relevant [1].
An important class of industrial production hosts are the
gram-positive bacilli as efficient secretors of enzymes and
producers of antibiotics, purine nucleotides or vitamins.
The industrially and scientifically most relevant representative of this group is B. subtilis, which is used extensively
for enzyme and biochemicals production [5], in particular
for the large-scale production of vitamin B2, riboflavin [68]. While B. subtilis fulfills most of the industrially desirable host criteria, it does not have a particularly low maintenance energy coefficient (0.44 mmol g-1 h-1 [9]) when
compared to, for example, B. licheniformis (0.24 mmol g-1
h-1 [10]) or Klebsiella aerogenes (0.3 mmol g-1 h-1 [11]).
Another industrially undesired feature of B. subtilis is its
ability to form spores upon nutrient limitation [12]. To
prevent sporulation during production, typically the first
regulatory sporulation gene, spo0A, is deleted. Beyond
sporulation, however, the Spo0A protein regulates several
other cellular processes, and the spo0A mutation has been
implied to increase the maintenance energy coefficient of
riboflavin producing B. subtilis [9]. Here, we investigate
specifically whether the spo0A mutation causes indeed
increased maintenance demands.
Another important host characteristic is the distribution
of intracellular fluxes as the starting point for metabolic
engineering. For the production of riboflavin – synthesized from three pentose units, glycerin and two C1 units
– significant fluxes through the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway deem intuitively advantageous [13].
While significant catabolic fluxes through the PP pathway
are found in common lab strains of Escherichia coli, B. sub-

tilis [14], B. clausii [15] and B. megaterium [16], many
other bacteria exhibit exceptionally low PP pathway fluxes
that only match the anabolic demand [14,17]. Partly
related to the PP pathway flux, catabolic NADPH overproduction is another preferred host property because 3
NADPH are required per riboflavin molecule, and catabolic overproduction could be utilized for riboflavin biosynthesis [13]. To assess the potential of close B. subtilis
relatives as alternative riboflavin cell factories, we quantified their distribution of fluxes as well as NADPH and
maintenance metabolism. Specifically we focus on the
growth rate-dependent flux distribution in glucose-limited chemostat cultures because of their similarity to the
conditions during riboflavin production in fed-batch with
continuously decreasing growth rates.

Methods
Bioreactors
A recently described mini-scale chemostat setup was used
for parallel operation of 12 chemostats [18]. Briefly, bacteria were grown in sealed 17 ml Hungate tubes. To avoid
stepwise feeding by dripping medium, the feed needle
was placed directly in the culture liquid. The culture volume was kept constant at 10 ml by level control with a second needle placed at the desired level to suck off excessive
culture broth. The medium removal pump was set to a
speed of two culture volumes per minute, thereby also
removing air from the headspace. The resulting underpressure caused air influx through a third needle, which
was placed at the bottom of the reactor. The rising bubbles
both aerated and mixed the cultures.

Due to sedimentation in the mini-scale reactors, B. amyloliquefaciens was the only species that was cultivated in
500 ml bioreactors (Infors AG, Switzerland). The cultivation volume of 250 ml was kept constant by level control.
Throughout the cultivation, active mixing was achieved
with a magnetic stirrer, and aeration was kept constant at
two volume of air per volume of culture and minute.

Species and growth conditions
Species used in this study are listed in Table 1. Frozen glycerol cultures were used to inoculate 5 ml Luria-Bertani
(containing per liter: 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, 10 g tryptone) precultures, supplemented with antibiotics where
necessary. From these LB precultures, we inoculated (1 to
500 diluted) 5 ml M9 minimal medium with 5 g/l glucose. From these overnight precultures, aerated Hungate
tubes were inoculated at a ratio of 1 to 10. First, batch
growth was allowed to proceed for 4 to 8 hours, and cultures were analyzed after continuous dilution of the
medium for at least 6 volume changes at 37°C. For each
steady state, a new chemostat culture was started from frozen stocks.

The M9 minimal medium was composed of the following
components (per liter final volume): 5.64 g Na2HPO4, 3 g
KH2PO4, 0.5 g NaCl, 1 g NH4Cl, 0.246 g MgSO4·7H2O,
0.014 g CaCl2, at pH 7.4 and 10 ml trace element solution
containing (per liter) 1.35 g FeCl26H2O, 0.1 g
MnCl2·H2O, 0.17 g ZnCl2, 0.043 g CuCl2·2H2O, 0.06 g
CoCl2·6H2O, 0.06 g Na2MoO4·2H2O [19]. Filter-sterilized glucose was added to a final concentration of 1 g per
liter. For 13C-labeling experiments, glucose was added
either as a mixture of 20% (wt/wt) U-13C-labeled isotope
isomer (99%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover,
MA) and 80% (wt/wt) natural glucose or as 100% 1-13Clabeled isotope isomer (99%; Cambridge, Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). Labeled glucose was used throughout the experiment, including the batch phase.
Batch experiments were done at 250 rpm in 500 ml baffled shake flask with a culture volume of 50 ml and 5 g/L
glucose for non-labeled experiments and 30 ml volume
and 3 g/L glucose for labeling experiments. The medium
composition and preculturing were identical to the chemostat experiments. For B. subtilis natto and B. pumilus,
biotin and adenine were added from sterile stock solutions to final concentrations of 0.1 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml,
respectively.
Analytical procedures and physiological parameters
Cell growth was monitored by determining optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Glucose and acetate concentrations in culture supernatants were determined by using
refractive index (RI) and UV detectors, respectively, on a
HPLC system (Agilent/Hewlett Packard Series 1100) with
an Aminex HPX-87H column (Biorad, Hercules, CA).

For continuous cultures, all physiological parameters
were determined during steady state between 5 to 7 volume changes after inoculation. Since dilution and thus
growth rate are constant in chemostat cultures, consumption and production rates were determined from the differences between substrate (S) and product (P)

concentrations in the feed medium and culture supernatant. The relationship qS(or P) = ΔS (or P) (D/X) we calculated specific production and consumption rates, where X
is the biomass concentration. For determination of maintenance energy coefficients glucose consumption rates
(qglc) were plotted against dilution rates. The maintenance
energy coefficients were determined as the y-axis intercept
of the weighted least square (WLS) regression line using
the SPSS statistical software package (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
IL).
In batch culture, the growth rate (μ) was determined as
the coefficient of the log-linear regression of OD600 versus
time. The biomass yield on the substrate (YX/S) was determined as the coefficient of a linear regression of biomass
concentration versus substrate concentration during the
exponential phase. The specific substrate consumption
rate was determined as the coefficient of a linear regression of substrate concentrations versus biomass concentrations multiplied by μ. The same relationship holds for
the specific rate of formation of (by-)products.
To calculate specific biomass yields, maintenance coefficients, consumption and production rates, a correlation
factor for cellular dry weight (CDW) to OD600 was used.
To determine the cellular dry weight, 10 ml culture broth
was transferred into preweighted 15 ml glass tubes and
centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 g at 4°C. The pellets were
washed twice with 0.9% NaCl and dried at 105°C for 24
h to constant weight. Except for the spo0A mutant, a single
correlation factor (gCDW/OD) was used for all dilution
rates (D) of a given species: i.e., B. subtilis wild type 0.48,
B. subtilis sigE 0.41, B. licheniformis T218a 0.55, B. licheniformis T380B 0.48, B. subtilis natto 0.54, B. pumilus 0.61
and B. amyloliquefaciens 0.36. For the B. subtilis spo0A
mutant the CDW-to-OD correlation varied with the
growth rate (data not shown), hence we determined the
correlation factors for this mutant at dilution rates of 0.05,
0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 h-1 from mini-scale cultivations. These
values were confirmed in a 1 l working volume stirred
tank reactor (data not shown). The resulting correlation
factors for the spo0A mutant were 0.39 gCDW/OD for D
of 0.05 h-1, 0.51 gCDW/OD for D of 0.2 to 0.3 h-1 and
0.44 gCDW/OD for D of 0.4 to 0.5 h-1.
Metabolic flux ratio analysis
Samples for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis were prepared as described previously
[20,21]. Briefly, biomass from 13C-labeled chemostat cultures was harvested after stable OD600 for at least 2 volume
changes (at least 6 volume changes in total). For shake
flask experiments, cells were harvested during mid-exponential growth at an OD600 of 1–1.5. Cell pellets were
hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl at 105°C in sealed microtubes
overnight. Hydrolyzates were then dried under a constant

air stream at 60°C. Derivatization was carried out at 85°C
in 30 μl dimethylformamide (Fluka, Switzerland) and 30
μl
N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide with 1% (v/v) tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane
(Fluka, Switzerland) for 60 min. Derivatized amino acids
were analyzed on a series 8000 GC, combined with an
MD 800 mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Beverly,
MA). The GC-MS-derived mass isotope distributions were
then analyzed using the software FiatFlux [22]. Briefly,
from the mass distributions of the amino acids the 13Clabeling patterns of their related precursor molecules in
central metabolism were inferred. A set of probabilistic
equations and the mass distributions of selected amino
acid fragments were then combined to calculate the relative contribution of converging fluxes to a given metabolite pool [21].

faciens and B. licheniformis, while B. pumilus is somewhat
more distal [25].

13C-constrained

None of the investigated bacilli contain genes encoding
enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and absence
of this pathway was also confirmed from the obtained
13C-labeling patterns (data not shown). In addition to
the B. subtilis network, the B. licheniformis genome contains the two glyoxylate shunt-encoding genes, which enables B. licheniformis to grow on two-carbon units such as
acetate or 2,3-butanediol [29]. For the experiments shown
here, however, we verified the absence of in vivo glyoxylate shunt fluxes from the calculated fraction of labeled
CO2 [18]. This result is consistent with the normally
observed glucose repression of this shunt [30].

metabolic flux analysis
Intracellular fluxes were estimated by fitting a flux distribution to the above flux ratios and quantitative physiological data within a stoichiometric model described by
[23] using the software FiatFlux [22]. Reaction reversibilities were chosen according to [23]. The reaction matrix
contained 24 unknown fluxes and 21 metabolite balances, including balances for glucose, acetate, CO2, O2,
and the cofactors NADH and NADPH. Precursor requirements for biomass formation were taken from [23]. To
solve this under-determined system of linear equations,
five additional constraints in the form of the above calculated flux ratios were used, i.e. serine derived through glycolysis, oxaloacetate originating from pyruvate,
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) originating from oxaloacetate, upper and lower bound of pyruvate originating from
malate and PEP derived through the PP pathway. The sum
of the weighed square residuals of the constraints form
both metabolite balances and flux ratios was minimized
using the MATLAB (The Mathworks) function fmincon
and the residuals were weighed by dividing through the
experimental error [24]. The computation was repeated at
least five times with randomly chosen initial flux distributions to ensure identification of the global minimum.

Results
Physiology and fluxes during batch growth on glucose
A desirable physiological characteristic of cell factories is
rapid and fully respiratory growth. For riboflavin production, in particular, an active PP pathway is expected to be
a second relevant criterion because the product is primarily synthesized from pentose units. To investigate the
potential suitability of B. subtilis 168 and four closely
related bacilli as cell factories for biochemicals production, we determined their physiological parameters and
fluxes during exponential growth in glucose batch cultures. The subspecies B. subtilis natto is phylogenetically
the closest relative to B. subtilis, followed by B. amylolique-

The 13C-flux data obtained for B. subtilis 168 compare
favorably with previously reported data from other B. subtilis strains [26] and also with reported metabolic flux
ratios for the type strain 168 [27]. To extend flux analysis
to other bacilli, we first verified their network topologies
by comparison with the KEGG database [28]. All four
genomes contained the genes for the reactions of the B.
subtilis network, with the exception of an absent 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in B. pumilus (Additional
file 1). Since our labeling experiments with both [U-13C]
and [1-13C] glucose demonstrated significant PP pathway
fluxes also in B. pumilus (Figure 1), we assumed the presence of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.

During unlimited growth on glucose, intracellular fluxes
(Figure 1) and physiology (Table 2) varied significantly
among the investigated bacilli. The growth physiology of
B. subtilis natto was similar to B. subtilis, with the obvious
difference of elevated acetate secretion and a concomitantly lower TCA cycle flux. B. amyloliquefaciens and B.
pumilus both grew rather slowly and were the most distinct
from the others. B. amyloliquefaciens has the lowest biomass yield and low relative flux through the PP pathway.
Moreover, its overflow metabolism is entirely different,
secreting massive amounts of pyruvate instead of acetate.
B. pumilus exhibited mostly respiratory metabolism with
high relative TCA cycle fluxes. As a peculiarity, it has unusually high fluxes through the pyruvate shunt from malate
to pyruvate and on to oxaloacetate that are indirectly
inferred from the 13C data.
The two B. licheniformis strains are derivatives of the parent strain T5, a producer of thermostable alpha-amylase
[31,32]. Specifically, strain T380B is a sporulation-deficient, direct descendant of T218a that was obtained after
multiple rounds of classical mutagenesis and screening
for traits that improved alpha-amylase production. Under
the investigated conditions, however, less than 10 μg/ml
protein was secreted in the medium, which did not signif-

icantly affect the mass balances. Both strains grow at intermediate specific growth rates with relatively high biomass
yields (Table 2). In terms of intracellular fluxes, both B.
licheniformis strains have about half of the TCA cycle flux
of B. subtilis.

coneogenic flux through the PEP carboxykinase (PEP originating from oxaloacetate) increased continuously with
decreasing growth rate (Figure 2). The latter result is consistent with the notion of decreasing catabolite repression
at the severe glucose limitation at low dilution rates [33].

In addition to B. subtilis wild type 168, we analyzed also
the otherwise isogenic B. subtilis 168 mutants spo0A and
sigE. In particular, we were interested whether the frequently used spo0A mutation has unfavorable effects on
metabolism through one of its many pleiotrophic effects
rather than through the intended block of sporulation. As
control for block of sporulation we used the sigE mutant
that cannot enter stage III of sporulation [12]. The phenotypic differences of B. subtilis wild type and spo0A compared to earlier work [27] is mainly due to different
cultivation systems that lead to higher growth rates in the
present experiments and possibly also to differences in
strain background. While the sigE mutation is phenotypically silent under this condition, the spo0A mutant has a
significantly increased glucose consumption and acetate
formation rate (Table 2). The consequence is a strongly
induced overflow metabolism and hence a reduced yield
of biomass (Table 2), indicating spo0A as a suboptimal
choice to suppress sporulation.

Absolute in vivo fluxes were then quantified by integrating the determined extracellular fluxes (Additional file 4)
and the intracellular flux ratios (Additional file 2) by 13Cconstrained flux analysis [24]. In contrast to the flux distribution during unrestricted growth on glucose (Figure
1A) glucose-limited chemostat cultures of B. subtilis show
i) no overflow metabolism, ii) about doubled relative
TCA cycle flux that remained stable over different dilution
rates, and iii) significant gluconeogenic flux through the
PEP carboxykinase at the lowest dilution rate (Figure 3A).

Influence of growth rate on fluxes
Since most industrial processes are based on carbon
source-limited fed-batches at low growth rates, we quantified growth rate dependent physiology and fluxes in 10ml glucose-limited chemostat cultures [18]. In contrast to
the discontinuously decreasing TCA cycle flux with
decreasing growth rate that was described for glucose-limited E. coli chemostat cultures [18], all ratios of intracellular fluxes in B. subtilis and its sporulation mutants
changed continuously or remained constant with decreasing growth rates (Figure 2). While the anaplerotic flux
ratio of oxaloacetate derived from pyruvate remained
almost invariant, the proportion of glycolytic versus PP
pathway (serine derived through glycolysis) and the glu-

The other bacilli exhibited generally rather similar trends
in their flux ratios as seen for B. subtilis (Figure 2A and 2B).
The sole exception was the in vivo PEP carboxykinase
activity (PEP from oxaloacetate) of B. licheniformis. While
this flux ratio was high at low dilution rates but absent at
higher values in all other investigated bacilli, we observed
a significant but constant fraction of PEP molecules originating from oxaloacetate in both B. licheniformis strains.
At the representative dilution rate of 0.2 h-1, we then calculated flux distributions for both B. licheniformis strains
and B. subtilis natto (Figure 3B). The main differences to
B. subtilis were the rather low respiratory TCA cycle fluxes
in all three species.
NADPH metabolism
Since the distribution of fluxes differed significantly in the
investigated species, we were interested whether their catabolic NADPH formation matched the anabolic demand.
For this purpose, we quantified NADPH formation from
the previously quantified carbon fluxes through the
NADPH-dependent reactions catalyzed by the oxidative
PP pathway and the isocitrate dehydrogenase. The anabolic demand of NADPH was directly quantified from the

known biochemical requirements of NADPH for growthdependent macromolecules biosynthesis [34]. Within the
resolution of the analysis most B. subtilis strains exhibited
balanced NADPH production and consumption during
unrestricted growth on glucose (Figure 4A). Under glucose limitation however, there was clearly a catabolic
overproduction for B. subtilis wild type (Figure 4B) and
the two mutants (data not shown), as was reported earlier
[35].

The NADPH balance was significantly different in the
other bacilli. Firstly, the summed catabolic NADPH formation of both B. licheniformis strains was clearly insufficient to match the anabolic demand in batch and in one
case also in chemostat culture (Figure 4A and 4C). This
consistent catabolic underproduction was primarily
caused by the rather low TCA cycle fluxes in B. licheniformis. Secondly, no species appeared to exhibit a catabolic NADPH overproduction like B. subtilis under any of

the investigated conditions (data partially shown in Figure 4A and 4C). The sole exception might be the batchgrown B. pumilus due to its exceptionally high malic
enzyme flux (Figure 4A). Since it is unclear which of the
two malic enzymes with different cofactor specificities
was active, however, this result is not conclusive.
Maintenance metabolism
Finally, to assess the bioenergetic suitability of the different species as biochemicals production host, we determined their maintenance metabolism; i.e. the amount of
energy required to maintain cellular homeostasis in the
absence of growth. Typically this non-growth-associated
maintenance energy coefficient is quantified by applying
Pirt's chemostat model [4]:

q glc =

m
+ m glc
max
Y
glc

where qglc is the specific glucose consumption rate, mglc the
max
maintenance energy coefficient and Y glc the maximum

molar growth yield. Using the physiological data from the
above described chemostat cultures, we found, consistent
with the Pirt model, a linear dependency of the glucose
consumption rate over the whole range of tested dilution
rates for B. subtilis (Figure 5), B. licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens (Figure 6). For the B. subtilis spo0A mutant we
determined growth rate specific OD600 to cell dry weight
conversion factors, because they did not remain constant,
in contrast to the other species.
For these bacilli with linear dependencies of the specific
glucose consumption rate with dilution rate, the maintenance energy coefficients were determined as the intercept
of the weighted least square regression line with the y-axis
(Table 3). The determined coefficient of 0.39 mmol
g(cdw)-1 h-1 for B. subtilis wild type 168 compares favorably to the previously reported 0.44 mmol g(cdw)-1 h-1 of
the related B. subtilis wild type 1012 [9]. The spo0A
mutant, but not the sigE mutant, exhibited an increased
maintenance coefficient of 0.49 mmol g(cdw)-1 h-1, which
is qualitatively consistent with the previously reported
high maintenance energy coefficient of riboflavin-producing spo0A mutants of B. subtilis [9,36]. Together, these
results provide strong evidence that the spo0A mutation
has a stimulating and biotechnologically undesirable
effect on maintenance metabolism.
Both B. licheniformis strains and B. amyloliquefaciens exhibited lower maintenance energy coefficients than B. subtilis
wild type (Table 3). In most cases, however, the difference
was minor and not statistically significant. The sole excep-

tion with significantly reduced maintenance energy
requirements was B. licheniformis T380B, despite a large
confidence interval. For B. pumilus and B. subtilis natto, the
maintenance coefficients could not be determined
because their specific glucose consumption rates did not
show a linear relationship with dilution rate (Figure 6).
The reasons are strong fluctuations in their steady state
biomass concentrations, which, at least for B. pumilus, are
related to dilution rates close to the maximum specific
growth rate (Table 2).

Discussion
The requirements for successful biotechnological production hosts are diverse and depend greatly on the product
of interest. Here we characterized several important metabolic properties that are critical for biochemicals production in different bacilli: i) general growth physiology, ii)
maintenance metabolism, and iii) a favorable distribution of intracellular fluxes for production of the vitamin
riboflavin, including catabolic overproduction of
NADPH.

the highest maintenance energy requirements of all bacilli
investigated here. The maintenance advantage of most
other bacilli, however, was rather small and was counterbalanced by several other disadvantages such as slow
growth and/or metabolism that render them even less
favorable to production than B. subtilis. The by far best
choice would be B. licheniformis T380B, which had only
about half of the maintenance energy coefficient of B. subtilis wild type. Since this strain grows also robustly in different cultivation devices and shows only moderate
acetate overflow, it is a promising cell factory host for biochemicals production in general, and riboflavin production in particular.

From a bioenergetic point of view, B. subtilis is not a preferred cell factory for riboflavin production because it had

Just how important are these differences in maintenance
metabolism on a process scale? In fermentation for penicillin production, for example, up to 70% of the carbon
source is utilized for maintenance [37]. Similarly during
industrial riboflavin production with the production
strain RB50::pRF69, maintenance metabolism expends on
the order of 45% of the consumed glucose (based on published data from [36] with a maintenance coefficient of
0.67 g g(cdw)-1 h-1). Reduction of the maintenance coefficient by 50% through a host switch, for example to B.
licheniformis T380B, seems possible as demonstrated here.
Provided a similar riboflavin formation is engineered, this
could reduce the glucose consumption in the overall riboflavin fed-batch process by 15–20%. Even at otherwise
unaltered riboflavin titers, this constitutes a major yield
improvement with high commercial relevance for a lowcost, feed chemical like riboflavin because substrate costs
are the key driver in this process.
Obviously, changing production hosts is a major undertaking that must be justified by the potential gains. Even
within one strain line, however, maintenance metabolism
can become a key process factor. Firstly, maintenance
metabolism is not a constant but can be affected by various genetic manipulations. While a similar maintenance
energy coefficient as reported here was described in a dif-

ferent B. subtilis wild-type (0.44 mmol g(cdw)-1 h-1), its
riboflavin producing counterpart exhibited a 50% higher
coefficient of 0.66 mmol g(cdw)-1 h-1 [9]. This is even
more surprising when considering that this particular
strain was only subtly engineered; i.e. it contained only a
single copy of the modified rib operon, the deregulating
ribC mutation, and the spo0A mutation. A key finding in
the present work is that the frequently used spo0A mutation [6] does not only influence the host physiology
under all conditions tested, but that it is also a major contributor to increased maintenance metabolism. The riboflavin manipulations themselves do not appear to be of
particular relevance because the industrial RB50 strain
with its much higher production level and multiple copies
of the rib operon in the genome as well as further uncharacterized mutations had the virtually identical maintenance coefficient of 0.67 mmol g(cdw)-1 h-1 as the above
subtly engineered strain [9,36]. Further down the sporulation regulation cascade, the sigE mutation, in contrast,
also prevents sporulation but had no detectable physiological phenotype and a wild-type-like maintenance coefficient. It thus appears to be the preferred choice for B.
subtilis, and this seemingly simple change in sporulation
mutations has the potential to significantly decrease glucose consumption in the above mentioned riboflavin fedbatch process [36] because the spo0A mutation alone
increased the maintenance coefficient of the wild-type by
20%.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/19

the opposite mechanism, i.e. an additional supply of
NADPH. How this may be achieved remains elusive at this
point because these species contain no homologue of the
NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB of E. coli
[41].

The intracellular fluxes reported here for B. subtilis are consistent with previous reports on particular growth conditions in disparate studies [9,13,26,27,34,35,38-40]. In
particular, we observed absence of overflow metabolism
and high relative TCA cycle fluxes in glucose-limited chemostats. In consequence, these fluxes lead to a significant
excess formation of NADPH in chemostats. Compared to
the other investigated bacilli, B. subtilis exhibited rather
high respiratory TCA cycle fluxes under all conditions. At
a dilution rate of D 0.2 h-1, the absolute TCA flux of B. subtilis was 2.9 ± 0.45 mmol g-1 h-1 while the maximum values of other bacilli were in the range from 1.3 ± 0.26 to 1.9
± 0.29 mmol g-1 h-1 and thus significantly lower. As a
result of their comparatively low TCA cycle fluxes, the
other bacilli produced much less NADPH in the isocitrate
dehydrogenase reaction. Consequently catabolic NADPH
formation was either balanced or even insufficient to
match the anabolic demand in all non-B. subtilis species.
Although not a rigorous criterion like maintenance
metabolism, the tendency towards catabolic overproduction of NADPH renders B. subtilis more attractive for riboflavin production than the other species.
To balance NADPH metabolism, B. subtilis thus requires a
transhydrogenase-like biochemical mechanism to counteract catabolic NADPH overproduction, at least in chemostat culture. Most of the other bacilli, in contrast, require
