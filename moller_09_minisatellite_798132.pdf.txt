Abstract
Background: Amos [1] suggested recently that a previously reported positive relationship
between minisatellite mutation rates and extra-pair paternity among species of birds [2] was
confounded by transcription errors and selective inclusion of studies. Here we attempted to
replicate the results reported by Amos [1], but also tested for the relationship by expanding the
data base by including studies published after our original paper.
Results: We were able to replicate the positive association between mutation rate and extra-pair
paternity in birds, even after controlling statistically for the confounding effecs of mean number of
bands scored, using 133 species, compared to 81 species in our first report [2]. We suggest that
Amos [1] failed to reach a similar conclusion due to four different potential causes of bias. First,
Amos [1] missed 15 studies from the literature that we were able to include. Second, he used
estimates of mutation rates that were based on both within- and extra-pair offspring, although the
latter will cause bias in estimates. Third, he made a number of transcription errors from the original
publications for extra-pair paternity, mutation rates, number of novel bands, and mean number of
bands scored per individual. Fourth, he included Vireo olivaceus although the mutation rate estimate
was based on one single offspring!
Conclusion: There was a positive association between mutation rates and extra-pair paternity in
birds, accounting for an intermediate effect size that explained 5–11% of the variance; estimates
that are bound to be conservative due to many different causes of noise in the data. This result was
robust to statistical control for potentially confounding variables, highlighting that it is important to
base comparative studies on all available evidence, and that it is crucial to critically transcribe data
while simultaneously checking published estimates for their correctness.

Introduction
Our current understanding of the factors accounting for
interspecific differences in mutation rates is at best poor
[3]. We made a first attempt to address this lacuna by
assembling a data base on mutation rates of minisatellites

in different species of birds, produced as a result of a
recent surge in studies investigating the evolution of extrapair paternity [2]. The hypothesis tested was that sex differences in cell divisions could cause sex differences in
mutation rates, and such sex differences should be more

common in species with more intense sperm competition
(see review of literature and justification for assumptions
in [2]).
Amos [1] suggested that we made numerous transcription
errors from the original sources, omitted key species, and
selectively included species that supported our hypothesis. We contest these assertions strongly and later explain
in detail how they arose. We also provide a comprehensive data base with all our data, and we show that our previous conclusion remains even when increasing sample
size from 81 to 133 species due to recently published data
that have become available after we finished our first
study, and when controlling for a number of novel, potentially confounding variables.

How to estimate mutation rates
We were puzzled to learn that Amos [1] had apparently
not read or understood how we had estimated mutation
rates, when we in fact described our procedures extensively [[2], p. 3, first column]. Given that Amos did not
adopt the procedure that we used for estimating mutation
rates, and given that he did not refute it on logical or other
grounds, it is unsurprising that he finds extensive discrepancies between mutation rate estimates in the original
papers and the rates that we reported. This does not justify
claims about transcription errors or selective inclusion,
but instead highlights the importance of reading papers
before criticizing them.
Since Amos [1] apparently cannot understand our explicit
descriptions [[2], p. 3], we have no other choice than
repeating ourselves. Whenever possible we estimated
mutation rates directly from data in the original publications by extracting information on the distribution of
novel bands that could not be attributed to extra-pair
paternity directly from the text or figures. We also
extracted information on the total number of bands
scored and the number of individuals used for these analyses. However, as we explicitly stated in Møller & Cuervo
[[2], p. 3], we should not include all individuals in such
estimates because offspring caused by extra-pair parentage
((male attending a nest is not the father) and extra-pair
maternity (female attending a nest is not the mother) and
intraspecific nest parasitism (neither male nor female
attending a nest are parents)) will bias mutation rate estimates. We explicitly provided two examples in Møller &
Cuervo [[2], p. 3], but we restrict this repeated explanation
to the first of our examples. This first example concerns
the indigo bunting Passerina cyanea for which Westneat [4]
analyzed extra-pair paternity of 63 young of which 22
were extra-pair offspring. He found that 28 nestlings had
0 novel bands, 10 had 1 novel band, and 3 had 2 novel
bands, in total 16 novel bands in 41 nestlings. Westneat
[4] scored on average 37.5 bands or 41 young × 37.5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/100

bands/young = 1537.5 bands in total. The mutation rate
is therefore 16/1537.5 = 0.010407. However, many
papers also included extra-pair offspring in their reported
estimates of mutation rates. If we had done so, we would
have had 63 young × 37.5 bands/young = 2362.5 bands
in total. That would have given a mutation rate estimate
of 16/2362.5 = 0.006772, or a reduction in mutation rate
estimate by 35%. We justified clearly why extra-pair offspring should be excluded from such estimates because
extra-pair offspring have many novel bands (in the example with the indigo bunting on average 8.2 novel bands).
We stated explicitly in Møller & Cuervo [[2], p. 3] and we
re-iterate here that "The latter precaution was taken since
a single or a few novel band(s) in an individual due to
mutation cannot readily be distinguished among a large
number of novel bands due to extra-pair paternity". Thus
'hidden' mutational bands in extra-pair offspring will
cause a bias in mutation rate estimates, and, therefore,
they have to be excluded. Here we now report the frequency distribution of novel bands, the mean number of
bands scored per individual and the number of individuals used for estimating mutation rates in Additional file 1,
allowing readers to assess all the data and confirm our
estimates.
Finally, we note that some of the estimates of mutation
rates reported in the original publications were at conflict
with what could be estimated using the number of novel
bands, the mean number of bands scored and the number
of individuals, and also in these cases have we used our
own estimate rather than what was reported in the paper.

Transcription of data
Amos [1] suggested that we made extensive transcription
errors of mutation rates. We have already explained above
why Amos [1] did not find consistency between our estimates and what was reported in the original publications.
He also explicitly stated that the mutation rate estimate
that we reported from Gibbs et al. [5] could not be found
in the paper. Opening the pdf file of Gibbs et al. [5] with
Acrobat reader allows anybody to search for 'mutation'
and find the estimate of 0.018 on p. 368!
We do not have access to Amos' complete data set, because
he chose not to publish it, although we assume that this is
the data in his Additional file 1 combined with the data
that we reported as corrected by him, but adjusted for what
he terms 'our transcription errors'. However, we cannot
know if that is the case because this is never stated explicitly. We have copied the data listed in Additional file 1 in
Amos [1] and compared these values with what is reported
in the original publications from which these data are
claimed to have been extracted. We have found numerous
errors. These range from the more mundane spelling errors
in 9% of the species names (Actitis hypoleucos, Carduelis tris-

addition, there are numerous errors in the frequency of
extra-pair paternity, mutation rate, sample size and number
of bands scored as reported in his Additional file 1. We
report his data together with the data from the original publications in our Additional file 1 to allow readers to visualize these discrepancies. We suggest that someone who
corrects others should be particularly careful not to make
errors himself.

Data selection criteria
Meta-analyses are strongly influenced by the data sets on
which they are based, and it is always good scientific practice to report the data selection criteria adopted, but also
to use multiple sources for accessing all available data [68]. We used all estimates of minisatellite mutation rates
known to us in our first publication [2], and we would
like to emphasize that one of us (APM) has kept an extensive list of all published studies of extra-pair paternity in
birds since 1988, used for extensive analyses of the function of sperm competition [9,10]. We have never deliberately excluded any data, nor did we exclude Vireo olivaceus,
contrary to what was suggested by Amos [1]. Close scrutiny of the original publication [11] for this species
revealed that although the estimate of extra-pair paternity
was based on 19 nestlings, in fact only 8 nestlings had
information on minisatellite bands for both parents.
Among these 8 nestlings, no fewer than 7 were extra-pair
offspring, leaving one single nestling for scoring mutational bands. Inclusion of an estimate of mutation based
on a sample size of one should be clearly inadequate to
anybody including Amos!

Møller & Cuervo [2], but now also include Hackett et al.
[17].

As a measure of the completeness of the entire data base
we would like to emphasize that we have identified 18
publications that were not in our original data set nor in
the data set reported by Amos [1]. These papers are listed
in our Additional file 2. As a second measure of completeness, we have kept a record of 48 manuscripts on extrapair paternity that APM has refereed. Only one of these
remains unpublished to date, suggesting that there is very
little scope for any effects of publication bias in the analyses, contrary to what is commonly the case in meta-analyses [6-8].

New analyses
Here we re-analyze the relationship between mutation
rate and extra-pair paternity using the previously
described procedures from Møller & Cuervo [2] and an
extensive data set based on 133 species. In addition, we
include five potentially confounding variables in the analyses. First, estimates based on large sample sizes will be
more reliable than estimates based on small sample sizes,
because the variance in estimates for small samples is
greater than for large samples. Such patterns of decrease in
sample variance with increasing sample size are ubiquitous in meta-analyses [6-8], and that is the main reason
for including sample size as a confounding factor in the
analyses. Thus it is not surprising that the variance also
decreases with sample size in the present data for both
mutation rates and extra-pair paternity. However, there is
no reason to expect, as did Amos [1], that estimates of
extra-pair paternity and mutation rates will be inherently
small and hence under-estimated at small sample sizes,
because they will simply only be more variable. Hence,
there is good reason to control for sampling effort. Second, the mean number of bands scored varied among
studies, and a larger number of bands may suggest a
greater level of precision and hence a greater probability
of detecting novel bands. Third, as we have argued previPage 3 of 5

ously [2], and also in the present study, correction of
mutation rate estimates for extra-pair paternity may
reduce bias because novel bands due to mutation 'hidden'
among bands due to extra-pair parentage will not contribute to estimates. Therefore, we included this variable as a
factor (with studies where we extracted the information
on mutation rate directly from the publication being
scored as 0, and studies where we estimated mutation rate
after exclusion of extra-pair parentage were scored as 1) in
the analyses because we could not correct all mutation
rate estimates due to missing values. Fourth, while we
originally analyzed minisatellite mutations, Amos [1] also
included other molecular markers in the analyses. Hence,
we included a factor that coded markers as minisatellites
or other markers. Fifth, as we have already emphasized
[2], molecular labs may differ in their procedures causing
systematic differences in estimates of mutation rates
among studies, and Amos [2] also suggested that there
was a lab effect on estimates. Thus we included molecular
lab as a factor in the analyses. Data for all these variables
are provided in our Additional file 2 to allow readers to
replicate our results and make further analyses. If more
than one mutation rate and extra-pair paternity estimate
was available for a species, we used mean estimates
weighted by sample size for the analyses.
The best-fit model relating extra-pair paternity to mutation rate including no potentially confounding variable
explained 5.1% of the total variance (Table 1A). A model
weighted by the square-root of sample size minus three
(the standard error, [12]) did not provide a better fit
(Table 1B). The relationship between mutation rate and
extra-pair paternity is shown in Fig. 1. There was no significant additional effect of whether or not we extracted the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/100

mutation rate from the publication (F = 0.33, d.f. = 1,129,
P = 0.57), whether the molecular marker was a minisatellite or not (F = 0.93, d.f. = 1,129, P = 0.34), or identity of
the molecular lab (F = 1.05, d.f. = 50,80, P = 0.41). We
constructed a phylogeny of all species (Fig. 2) for analyses
of the relationship between mutation rate and extra-pair
paternity, while simultaneously considering similarity in
phenotype among species due to common phylogenetic
descent. This phylogenetic analysis provided similar conclusions to the analysis based on species-specific data,
explaining 8.6% of the variance (Table 1C). A phylogenetic analysis [12] weighted by the square-root of sample
size minus three [13] explained 10.6% of the variance
(Table 1D).

The relationship is conservative
The literature on mutation rates, and in particular the literature on mutations in minisatellites, is replete with
comments on the difficulty of quantifying these, and
Amos [1] cites a number of these references. We are the
first to acknowledge these difficulties. However, we deliberately attempted to quantify the influence of any of these
sources of error by calculating repeatabilities, using standard procedures from the quantitative genetics literature
based on one-way analysis of variance [14]. In this way
Møller & Cuervo [2] could show that despite large heterogeneity in estimates, there were still significant repeatability in mutation rate estimates and estimates of extra-pair
paternity. We could also show that restriction enzyme as a
factor (code 1 for a given study using an enzyme and 0 for
all other studies) did not explain variation in mutation
rate estimates [2]. We showed that the minimum size of
fragments scored did not explain mutation rate estimates
[2]. Finally, we showed that there was no significant effect

of molecular lab [2], and there was no temporal improvement in techniques as shown by no significant effect of
year of publication [2]. The absence of significant effects
still holds in the currently much larger data set.
The main finding of our study is that mutation rates and
extra-pair paternity are significantly positively related, and
this relationship accounts for 5.1% of the variance in an
analysis of species-specific data, and 8.6–10.6% of the variance in phylogenetic analyses, which equals a small to
intermediate effect size (sensu Cohen [15], explaining 1%
to 9% of the variance). We note that the effect size
reported here is of the same magnitude that we originally
reported (7.8%, [2]). This effect size is also very close to
the average effect size in all meta-analyses in biology
(around 5–7% of the variance explained [16]). Amos [1]
emphasized all the difficulties in estimating mutation
rates, and that any relationship will be conservative. We
can only concur that the many sources of noise in the data
will render any biological signal much weaker than the
true underlying signal. Hence, we consider the effect size
of 3.9% to be an underestimate.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have corroborated our previous conclusion [2] that mutation rates increase with extra-pair paternity in birds, with an effect size of small to intermediate
magnitude. This conclusion is robust to inclusion of a
number of potentially confounding variables and to statistical control for similarity in phenotype among species
due to common phylogenetic descent.
