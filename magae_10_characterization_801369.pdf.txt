Characterization of a mycovirus associated with
the brown discoloration of edible mushroom,
Flammulina velutipes
Yumi Magae*, Masahide Sunagawa

Abstract
Background: A mycovirus previously identified in brown discolored fruiting bodies of the cultivated mushroom
Flammulina velutipes was characterized. We tentatively named the virus the F. velutipes browning virus (FvBV).
Results: Purified FvBV particles contained two dsRNA genomes (dsRNA1 and 2). The complete sequence of
dsRNA1 was 1,915 bp long, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) that encoded 580 amino acids of a
putative 66-kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). dsRNA2 was 1,730 bp long containing a single ORF
encoding 541 amino acids of a putative 60-kDa coat protein (CP1). Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp sequences
revealed FvBV to be a Partitivirus, most closely related to Chondrostereum purpureum cryptic virus. An RT-PCR assay
was developed for the amplification of a 495-bp cDNA fragment from dsRNA encoding the CP1. When wild F.
velutipes isolated from various parts of Japan were examined by RT-PCR assay, three isolates from the central
region of Japan contained FvBV. One wild strain infected with FvBV was isolated in Nagano prefecture, where
brown discoloration of white cultivated strains has occurred. Fruiting bodies produced by virus-harboring and
virus-free F. velutipes were compared.
Conclusions: Cap color of the fruiting bodies of F. velutipes that contained Partitivirus FvBV was darker than FvBVfree fruiting bodies. The use of RT-PCR enabled association of FvBV and dark brown color of the fruiting body
produced by F. velutipes strains.

Background
At the time mycoviruses were discovered in the white
button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, in 1962 [1], Lentinula edodes was the only artificially cultivated mushroom in Japan. Since then, the number of cultivated
mushroom species has greatly increased: L. edodes,
Flammulina velutipes, Hypsizygus marmoreus, Pholiota
nameko, Grifola frondosa, and Pleurotus eryngii are cultivated daily. As the mushroom industry in Japan continues to grow, various abnormal symptoms during
cultivation have been observed. Symptom that
resembled abiotic disorders of A. bisporus [2] first
became apparent with cultivated strains of F. velutipes
[3,4]. One of the abnormal symptoms was the spontaneous appearance of brown discolored fruiting bodies
among the white ones. We detected spherical virus

particles in the brown discolored fruiting bodies of two
different cultivated F. velutipes [3,5]. We tentatively
named the virus FvBV, for Flammulina velutipes browning virus.
Browning is also a typical symptom observed in MVX
(Mushroom virus X) disease in A. bisporus [6-8]. With
MVX, complex patterns of more than 26 dsRNA bands
are detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Four low
molecular weight dsRNAs have been specifically linked
with the browning syndrome [6] together with some
bacterial agent [8].
In the present study, we determined the sequences of
the dsRNA genomes of FvBV. The two dsRNA isolated
from the purified virus particles potentially coded for
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a coat
protein. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp
sequence, FvBV belongs to the family Partitiviridae.
From the nucleotide sequence of the FvBV coat protein,
RT-PCR primers were designed. To estimate the

influence of FvBV on fruiting body color, fruiting bodies
produced by virus-harboring strains and virus-free
strains of F. velutipes were compared. Based on the RTPCR assay developed in this study, FvBV and the dark
brown cap color of the fruiting bodies were clearly
linked.

Results
Molecular characterization of FvBV

The complete nucleotide sequences of the two dsRNAs
isolated from the purified virions (Figure 1) were determined. The sequences are deposited in DDBJ under the
accession numbers of AB465308 and AB465309.
dsRNA1: The sequence of dsRNA1 was 1,915 bp in
length, containing a single open reading frame (ORF)
starting at position nt 56 and ending at nt 1798, which
encoded a putative protein of 580 amino acids with a
deduced molecular mass of 66,716 Da (Figure 2). A PSIBLAST [9] search of the deduced amino acid sequence
of dsRNA1, revealed the presence of the conserved
motif (pFam cd01699 RNA_dep_RNAP, 3e-6)) [10] for
RdRp within the ORF. RdRp is an essential protein
encoded in the genomes of all RNA containing viruses
with no DNA stage.
Sequence identities and E values of proteins deposited
in GenBank that showed significant similarity with the
putative RdRp encoded by dsRNA 1 are listed in Table
1. All of these viruses belonged to the family Partitiviridae [11]. Multiple alignments of RdRp amino acid
sequences of the viruses listed in Table 1 were constructed using the MAFFT program [12]. Conserved
motifs III-VIII of RdRp of dsRNA viruses [13] were

found (Figure 3). An unrooted phylogenetic tree based
on the alignment with bootstrap of 1000 was made (Figure 4). RdRp of FvBV was grouped together with a partitivirus in the basidiomycete fungus Chondrostereum
purpureum and placed adjacent to a group containing
two partitiviruses of pathogenic basidiomycete fungus:
Helicobasidium mompa dsRNA mycovirus and Heterobasidion RNA Virus (Figure 4).
dsRNA2: The sequence was 1,730 bp, with a single
ORF starting at nt 71 and ending at 1,460 (Figure 2).
The deduced amino acid sequence coded for putative
protein of 541 amino acids with a molecular mass of
60,513 Da. Sequence identities and E values of proteins
deposited in GenBank that showed significant similarity
with the putative coat protein encoded by dsRNA 2 are
listed in Table 2. Multiple alignments of coat protein
amino acid sequences of the viruses listed in Table 2 are
shown (Figure 5).

Among the 14 wild isolates (Table 3) examined for
dsRNA, five from the central region of Japan contained
dsRNA (Figure 6). Based on the RT-PCR analysis, three
of the five isolates contained FvBV (Figure 7). Among
the five dsRNA-harboring wild isolates, isolate No. 4 did
not produce fruiting bodies. Also, Isolate No. 6 did not
produce enough fruiting bodies (yield 37 g) to make an
accurate comparison that it was eliminated from the
test. Other dsRNA-harboring wild isolates, including
isolate 5 (yield 107 g), 7 (yield 62 g) and 8 (yield 100 g)
produced enough fruiting bodies for color comparison.
As shown in the photograph (Figure 8), dsRNA-free
wild isolate No. 2 (yield 104 g) and No. 11 (yield 98 g)
produced fruiting bodies with paler-colored caps while
fruiting bodies of the two isolates (No.7 and 8) containing FvBV were dark brown (Figure 8). Color of fruiting
bodies produced by isolate No.5, which contained
dsRNA but not FvBV, was much paler compared to isolate 7 and 8. All the F. velutipes harboring FvBV (two

Discussion
In our previous study, we investigated the presence of
dsRNA elements in cultivated strains of F. velutipes to
determine whether viruses are involved in the malformation of fruiting bodies. All of these strains were, however, dsRNA free [3]. Unexpectedly, spherical
mycoviruses were detected in F. velutipes that showed
brown discoloration during cultivation. This finding suggested that mycovirus causes brown discoloration of the
mushroom. We tentatively named the virus Flammulina
velutipes browning virus, or FvBV. Because browning
reduces the crop value of white mushrooms, FvBV was
further characterized in this study.
In this study, the sequences of two dsRNAs contained
in the viral particles of FvBV were determined. dsRNA1
coded for putative RdRp with a sequence showing significant homology with members of the family Partitiviridae (Table 1). The family Partitiviridae consists of
fungal and plant viruses with isometric virions, 30-35

nm in diameter, with a genome of two dsRNA segments
each of 1.4-2.2 kb. The viruses are associated with latent
infections of fungal or plant hosts [11]. dsRNA2 coded
for putative coat protein with a sequence showing high
homology with partitiviruses (Table 2). But the E-values
were much larger compared to RdRp sequences.
It is noted that one of the three wild isolates (Isolate
No. 8) harboring FvBV was isolated in Nagano prefecture, where spontaneous discoloration of cultivated F.
velutipes has occurred at two independent locations
(Figure 6). Because the mycelium of strain S6B does not
show incompatibility against strain S6 (data not shown),
it is unlikely that strain S6B is a wild F. velutipes contaminated during cultivation. Thus, presumably, there
was horizontal transfer of the virus from a wild isolate
to a cultivated strain of F. velutipes within Nagano
prefecture.
The result of mushroom cultivation (Figure 8) shows
that most of the isolates harboring mycoviruses in F.
velutipes do not influence fruiting body development.
All the virus-harbouring isolates except for Isolate No.4
produced fruiting bodies. The colony of strain No.4
showed very slow growth, flat morphology and incompatibility as well as fruiting body productivity is lost.
These characteristics are similar to the hypovirulence
identified in pathogenic fungi [14]. dsRNA of mycovirus
in this degenerate wild strain (designated as F. velutipes
isometric virus; FvIV), has been sequenced and deposited in DDBJ under the accession no. of AB428575.
FvIV is studied in detail in another study and submitted
for publication.
The color of the fruiting body, as can be seen in the
photograph, shows that virus-free F. velutipes fruiting
bodies are whiter (Figure 8). Based on the results of the
RT-PCR assay and fruiting body production, the presence of FvBV in mycelium and the dark brown color of
fruiting bodies were clearly correlated.
In A. bisporus, brown discoloration of fruiting body
caused by bacterial or fungal infection is known [15,16].
Toxins produced by the bacteria can induce brown coloration of A. bisporus [17]. A quantitative trait locus of
A. bisporus resistance to P. tolassi is closely linked to
natural cap color [18].

Conclusions
Partitivirus in fungi has been associated with only symptomless infections [11]. For example, a partitivirus in
oyster mushroom does not affect its host’s phenotype
[19]. In this respect, FvBV is possibly unique because it
is associated with a specific symptom of F. velutipes.
Although Koch’s postulates have not been established
yet, an association between a browning of fruiting body
and a partitivirus in F. velutipes became evident in this
study.

isolated using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Chatsworth, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. dsRNA for agarose gel electrophoresis was
prepared from the viral RNA by DNase I (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and S1 nuclease (Takara Bio,
Ohtsu, Japan) digestion. The nuclease-digested product
was precipitated with isopropanol after extraction with
Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).
Total dsRNA was electrophoresed on agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide, and observed under UV
illumination.

Methods
Strains

Viral particles were purified from mycelium of F. velutipes strain S6B. Strain S6B is a variant of the cultivated
F. velutipes strain Shinano No. 6 (designated as S6) that
contained dsRNAs and showed brown discoloration of
the fruiting bodies [5]. The 14 wild isolates and 2 cultivated strains used in this study are listed in Table 3.
Culturing

The strains were routinely maintained on MA (2% malt
extract, 1.8% agarose). Cultures for extraction of dsRNA
were grown in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 150
ml of GYM (1% glucose, 0.4% yeast extract, and 1%
malt extract) at 24°C, stationary for 3 to 4 weeks.
dsRNA extraction

Viral particles of F. velutipes were precipitated with PEG
8000 and NaCl as described previously [3]. Total RNA
from the PEG precipitate suspended in TES (10 mM
Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.0) was

Purification of viral particles

The PEG precipitate of viral particles was subjected to
30-40% sucrose density-gradient centrifugation for 2 h
at 100,000 × g at 4°C. After the ultracentrifugation, the
sample was fractionated into 2-ml volumes, and 100 μl
of each fraction was assessed for the presence of dsRNA
using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Fractions containing the dsRNA were collected, and viral
particles were confirmed by electron microscope observation using a transmission electron microscope
(H-7000; Hitachi, Tokyo) after negative staining with 2%
aqueous uranyl acetate. dsRNA was extracted from the

purified viral particles using the RNeasy Mini Elute
Clean-up Kit (Qiagen).
dsRNA sequence

dsRNA extracted from the purified virions was cloned
using the Takara small RNA Cloning Kit (Takara Bio)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a
slight modification: RevaTraAce (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan)
was used for cDNA synthesis instead of the M-MLV
RTase included in the kit, with the aim of generating a
longer cDNA. The cDNA was cloned into the pGEM-T
easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to

program on the Web server http://align.genome.jp/
mafft/ was used. Sequences used for constructing the
phylogenetic tree are summarized in Table 1.
RT-PCR

the manufacturer’s instructions and transformed into E.
coli DH5a (Toyobo). Cloned DNA was PCR amplified
using Insert Check Ready (Toyobo). The DNA was
sequenced using the BigDye Terminators v1.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) with an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
Sequence analysis

A PSI-BLAST search [9] was performed with the predicted amino acid sequences of the cDNA generated
from dsRNA1 and 2. Sequence alignment was performed using the MAFFT program L9INS-I (available at
http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/
index.html) [12]. Neighbour joining with 1,000-boot
strapping was performed and phylogenetic tree was constructed with sequences of bootstrap value above 70%.
For visually constructing phylogenetic tree, the MAFFT

Primers for RT-PCR were designed from the sequence
of the putative CP1. Primers CP-F (5’-GCCCGCATCATTACTGTTCT-3’) and CP-R (5’-TATCGGTATCAGGGCCGTAG-3’) were designed for the
amplification of the 495-bp product from nt 479 to 973
of the CP1 DNA using Primer version 3.0 (Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Science). RT-PCR was performed with PEG-precipitated dsRNA prepared as
described above with 20 pmol of both primers and RTPCR quick Master Mix (Toyobo). The dsRNA was denatured at 100°C for 10 min. and immediately cooled on
ice. Reverse transcription was performed as follows: 90°C
for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 min, and 94°C for 1 min. The following PCR amplification was 40 cycles at 94°C for
30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min with a final extension of 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and
observed under UV illumination.
Fruiting body production

Fruiting bodies were produced using sawdust supplemented with rice bran as the substrate, contained in
polypropylene bottles of 800 ml as described in [4].
