Clostridium botulinum group III: a group with dual
identity shaped by plasmids, phages and mobile
elements
Hanna Skarin1,2, Therese Håfström1, Josefina Westerberg1 and Bo Segerman1*

Abstract
Background: Clostridium botulinum strains can be divided into four physiological groups that are sufficiently
diverged to be considered as separate species. Here we present the first complete genome of a C. botulinum strain
from physiological group III, causing animal botulism. We also compare the sequence to three new draft genomes
from the same physiological group.
Results: The 2.77 Mb chromosome was highly conserved between the isolates and also closely related to that of
C. novyi. However, the sequence was very different from the human C. botulinum group genomes. Replicationdirected translocations were rare and conservation of synteny was high. The largest difference between C.
botulinum group III isolates occurred within their surprisingly large plasmidomes and in the pattern of mobile
elements insertions. Five plasmids, constituting 13.5% of the total genetic material, were present in the completed
genome. Interestingly, the set of plasmids differed compared to other isolates. The largest plasmid, the botulinumneurotoxin carrying prophage, was conserved at a level similar to that of the chromosome while the medium-sized
plasmids seemed to be undergoing faster genetic drift. These plasmids also contained more mobile elements than
other replicons. Several toxins and resistance genes were identified, many of which were located on the plasmids.
Conclusions: The completion of the genome of C. botulinum group III has revealed it to be a genome with dual
identity. It belongs to the pathogenic species C. botulinum, but as a genotypic species it should also include C.
novyi and C. haemolyticum. The genotypic species share a conserved chromosomal core that can be transformed
into various pathogenic variants by modulation of the highly plastic plasmidome.

Background
Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by some of the
most potent toxins known, the botulinum neurotoxins
(BoNTs). The toxins are proteins mainly produced by
the species Clostridium botulinum but some Clostridium
butyricum and Clostridium baratii strains are also capable of producing BoNTs. Due to their extreme potency,
the BoNTs are classified as high risk threat agents for
bioterrorism [1]. In addition to causing severe intoxications in humans, BoNT-producing bacteria can also produce serious problems in wild and domesticated animals
such as birds, cattle, horses, sheep and minks. Outbreaks
with high mortal outcome in waterfowl and poultry have

become an increasing environmental and economical
problem [2].
C. botulinum is an anaerobic, spore-forming Grampositive bacterium commonly found in soil and aquatic
environments [3]. The species C. botulinum is divided
into four physiological groups (I-IV), which produce
BoNTs of seven different serotypes (A-G) [4]. The four
groups represent distinct phylogenetic clades and are
separated by a distance large enough to merit classification as four separate species [5]. Physiological group I
(proteolytic) includes C. botulinum strains producing
toxins of serotype A, B or F and is mainly associated
with human cases. Physiological group II (non-proteolytic) consists of strains producing toxins of serotype B, E
or F; these strains also cause human botulism. Group III
produces toxins of serotype C or D and is associated
with avian and nonhuman mammalian botulism.

Genetic studies have shown that strains belonging to
physiological group III are more closely related to C.
novyi and C. haemolyticum than to C. botulinum serotypes from group I and II [6]. Physiological group IV is
a rarer and less characterised group that produces toxin
of serotype G.
The neurotoxin genes of C. botulinum type C and D
are carried by bacteriophages, which express unstable
lysogeny and are frequently lost during cultivation. The
BoNT prophage propagates in the bacterium as a large
plasmid and strains cured from the phage can be reconverted to toxigenic strains by either type C or D phage
particles [7]. The distinction between types C and D is
not absolute because chimerical sequences exist [8]. In
general, the neurotoxin genes analysed from avian isolates comprise parts from both BoNT/C and BoNT/D
genes and are referred to as type C/D or D/C [9]. The
chimeric types are more lethal to avian species than
either type C or D [9,10]. C. botulinum types C and D
also produce a minor amount of a binary toxin, the C2
toxin, which genes are located on a plasmid [11]. The
C2 toxin has a translocation domain as well as an ADPribosylating domain that targets actin.
Several completed clostridia genomes have been
reported in the last ten years, including C. difficile, C.
perfringens, C. novyi-NT and C. botulinum types A, B, E
and F [12-16]. The genome sizes of species in the Clostridium genus vary between 2.5 and up to at least 6 Mb
and their GC contents are often low. Sequences from
three large plasmids from C. botulinum group III strains
have been released: the BoNT prophage from strain CStockholm [17]; the C2 toxin plasmid from strains
C203U28 [11] and D-1873; and another large plasmid
from strain D-1873. Two draft whole genome shotgun
(WGS) assemblies from type D strain 1873 and type C
strain Eklund are also deposited in the sequence
database.
Here we report and analyse the first complete genomic sequence from a C. botulinum group III strain. The
sequence comes from a recently isolated C. botulinum
type C/D strain originating in 2008 from an outbreak in
a Swedish poultry farm. We also release three draft genomes: one from a wildfowl outbreak in 2007, another
from a poultry outbreak in 2007, and finally the CStockholm strain isolated from a mink outbreak in 1949
[18]. The results have revealed a genome with a conserved core that is shaped by plasmids, phages and
mobile elements.

the draft genomes of strains 07-V891 and C-Stockholm
(including the completed plasmid p6CSt) are presented
in Table 1. Data from the draft genome of strain
07-BKT028387 (accession number [GenBank:
AESB00000000]) are not shown but were very similar
to those for BKT015925 with the exception that the
BoNT prophage plasmid (p1) was missing due to loss
during cultivation. The table also includes features and
accession numbers of the genomic sequence of the
related C. novyi-NT strain (chromosome only) and all
available completed C. botulinum group III plasmids. In
contrast to the previously completed plasmids originating from isolates before 1960, the BKT015925 sequences
came from a recent isolate (2008). The C. botulinum
group III genome was comparably small in relation to
other clostridium genomes with a circular chromosome
of 2.77 Mbp and a low GC content. Larger deviations of
the GC content were only found in association with
rRNA operons (Figure 1A). In addition to the chromosome, there were five circular plasmids in the
BKT015925 genome, with sizes varying between 12 kb
and 203 kb. A sixth plasmid of 55 kb was found in the
draft genomes of V891 and C-Stockholm. The plasmid
sizes were also verified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of S1 nuclease-treated genomic DNA (Additional file 1, Figure S1). The GC contents of all plasmids
were similar to that of the chromosome and varied
between 26 and 28%. A total of 3026 coding sequences
(CDS) were predicted in BKT015925, of which 2546
were located on the chromosome and 480 on the plasmids. In total, 78% of the plasmid content and 86% of
the chromosome consisted of CDS. The genes were
strongly clustered on the leading strand of the chromosome that was enriched in Gs as seen by the GC skew
plot (Figure 1A). The largest plasmid, p1, had a GC
skew and a strand-biased distribution of genes similar to
the chromosome, indicating two replichores of opposite
polarity (Figure 1B). In the second- and third-largest
plasmids, p2BKT015925 (p2) and p3BKT015925 (p3),
there was less difference in base composition between
the strands and no strand-biased gene distribution was
observed (Figure 1C-D). The two smallest plasmids/prophages, p4BKT015925 (p4) and p5BKT015925 (p5), and
the plasmid found in C-Stockholm, p6CSt (p6), had
most of their genes clustered on the same strand (Figure
1E-G). Putative functions were assigned to 2012 (66%)
of the chromosomal CDS and to 183 (38%) of the CDS
in the total plasmidome. There is often a high number
of rRNA operons in clostridium species and the Clostridium botulinum group III genome was no exception.
We identified 10 rRNA operons and 85 tRNA genes. A
noticeably large number of insertion sequence (IS) elements were distributed throughout the genome on both
replichores (Figure 1).

Phylogenomic comparison

Results from several methods show that the physiological groups of C. botulinum are so distant from each
other that they could be considered to be different species [4,19,20]. rRNA comparisons have also shown that
C. novyi and C. haemolyticum are closely related to C.
botulinum group III [6]. We used the Average Similarity
of the Conserved core (ASC) method [20] to compare
the pairwise average nucleotide distance between the
available completed and draft genomes from C. botulinum group III and representative genomes from other
C. botulinum groups and Clostridium species (Figure
2A). The distinct phylogenetic separation of the C. botulinum group I-III was obvious. Our results also unequivocally showed that the C. novyi-NT genome belongs to
the same lineage as the C. botulinum C-Eklund genome
within C. botulinum group III. This provides further

evidence that the distinction between C. botulinum
group III and C. novyi does not have a phylogenomic
basis. Rather, the distinction has arisen from phenotypic
traits linked to clinical symptoms. The C. botulinum
group III genome sequence contributes further evidence
that the current bacterial species classification, at least
for some lineages, is inadequate. On one hand, it would
be impractical for clinical reasons to change the species
name of the physiological groups, where all constituents
are causing botulism. Furthermore, it would be confusing to include strains that can cause completely different
diseases within the group III species. On the other hand,
the current taxonomy conflicts with a phylogenetic concept of the species. We would therefore like to classify
C. botulinum group III as a dual species. The pathotypic
species (pathospecies) C. botulinum would include all
botulism-causing strains, while the genotypic species

(genospecies) C. novyi sensu lato would include C. botulinum group III, C. novyi and C. haemolyticum.
Upon comparing the available genomes of group III
strains, we found three different clades (Figure 2B). Our
recently isolated strains formed one lineage, the D-1873
and the C-Stockholm strains formed a second one and
the C -Eklund (type C/D ) together with the C. novyiNT strain formed a third lineage. The average genomic
variation within group III (C. novyi sensu lato) was
large, but not exceptionally so.
Features of the chromosome

The isolates from 2007 and 2008 shared a 98-99%
sequence similarity with each other on the nucleotide
level in their core genomes, which account for 97-99% of
the chromosome. Overall, the BKT015925 chromosome

Page 5 of 13

also showed a high resemblance to the C. novyi chromosome. The non-conserved regions between BKT015925
and C. novyi were scattered throughout the sequence.
The BKT015925 chromosome was approximately 9% larger than that of C. novyi and the extra genetic material
was relatively evenly distributed. Using a BLASTP cut-off
at e < 10e-9, 313 proteins were specific for C. novyi-NT
and 511 were specific for BKT015925 (Additional file 2,
Table S1). Hypothetical proteins and mobile elementrelated proteins constituted 58% and 8% of the
BKT015925-specific proteins respectively. Among the
remaining proteins were components of a phosphotransferase system (PTS) and several large repeat-domain proteins. Most toxin genes were located on the plasmids but
there were two tetanolycin O genes found in the chromosome. These tetanolycin genes were also conserved in the

the largest number of plasmids in any completed clostridia genome. In fact, in all the currently completed
microbial genomes, less than 5% of them contain five or
more plasmids. The copy number, as determined by
coverage, was close to one for the BKT015925 plasmids
except for the smallest one, where it was approximately
two. By mapping the draft genome reads onto the
sequences of plasmids from BKT015925, we concluded
that p1-p4 also were present and highly similar (99%,
98%, 97% and 99% nucleotide similarity respectively) in
V891. However, the p5 plasmid was absent. By PFGE
and analysis of de novo contigs unique to V891 and CStockholm we could also detect the presence of a sixth
plasmid of about 55 kb. This plasmid was completed
using the C-Stockholm genome sequence and was therefore called p6CSt. We believe that the plasmids we present here are part of a pan-plasmidome existing in C.
botulinum group III. Conjugative transfer of BoNT
encoding plasmids has previously been reported between

the chromosome and plasmidome are summarised in
Table 2.
Bacterial genomes frequently undergo replication-directed translocations. When aligning closely related species
these are seen by symmetric inversions around the replication origin [21,22]. There was a high conservation of
gene synteny between the BKT015925 and the C. novyi
chromosomes and only a few symmetric inversions were
visible (Figure 3A). The degree of symmetrical inversions between two arbitrary genomes with this particular
genetic distance varies tremendously. A few examples
are shown in Figure 3B. In conclusion, C. novyi sensu
lato genomes show a comparably low replication-directed translocation activity.
Features of the Plasmidome

The five plasmids together comprised 13.5% of the total
genomic content of strain BKT015925. To date, this is

Figure 3 Genetic synteny and replication-directed translocations visualized by MUMmer alignments. (A) A comparison of the
chromosomes of C. botulinum group III (BKT015925) and C. novyi-NT. The conserved gene synteny and the low replication-directed translocation

strains of C. botulinum, and it is likely this mechanism
that is responsible for exchange of plasmids between
strains [23].
Many of the plasmids contained phage genes and
several toxin genes were present in the plasmidome
(Table 2). Two of the plasmids also contained clustered,
regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)
regions and genes encoding CRISPR-associated (Cas)
proteins, providing acquired immunity against foreign
DNA [24]. Typically, CRISPR regions are located on the
chromosome and the C. novyi-NT genome is no exception with four chromosomal CRISPR regions. Interestingly, CRISPR loci and cas genes were found exclusively
on the plasmidome in BKT015925. The number and
identity of the spacer sequences on p2 were identical to
matches found in the other poultry strain, BKT028387,
confirming that the two poultry strains are very closely
related.

mechanisms and that they probably have co-existed for
a period of time. If genetically diverged strains coexisted in the same habitat, loss of the BoNT prophage
in combination with re-infection by one from another
strain, could phylogenetically unlink the phage from the

The largest extrachromosomal element, the BoNT-carrying prophage, was found to be a 203 kb circular plasmid in the BKT015925 and V891 genomes. Compared
to the BoNT phage from the C-Stockholm stain [17],
which has a size of 186 kb, the BKT015925 phage contained 9% more genetic material. A comparison between
p1 and phage C-Stockholm is shown in Figure 4A. The
synteny of the conserved genetic material was well preserved. For this pair of plasmids, the average nucleotide
similarity of the conserved core was in the same range
as between the corresponding chromosomes (72% vs.
80%). This indicates that the BoNT prophage and the
chromosome are evolving under the influence of similar

chromosome. Our data does not support such scenario
but more isolates need to be analysed before this
hypothesis can be ruled out. The non-conserved regions,
compared to the phage from C-Stockholm, were evenly
distributed throughout the replicon and consisted of 110
genes, of which 70% coded for hypothetical proteins, 6%
for phage proteins and 8% for mobile elements. Among
the remaining proteins specific for p1 were proteins
involved in prophage maintenance (death-on curing protein) and defence systems (Cas and abi-alpha proteins).
Three CRISPR regions, along with two cas genes, were
found in p1, containing 20, 8 and 12 spacers. Only two
small CRISPR regions were present in phage C-Stockholm, with 5 and 2 spacers. The majority of the 93 proteins specific for the C-Stockholm phage were also
hypothetical proteins (76%), mobile elements (10%) and
phage proteins (3%). Phage C-Stockholm and p1 specific
proteins are listed in Additional file 3, Table S2.
The progenitor neurotoxin cluster in Group III strains
consists of a regulatory protein (BotR), hemagglutinin
(HA) proteins and a non-toxic non-hemagglutinin
(NTNH) protein. These proteins are suggested to be
involved in protection and transportation of the neurotoxin [25]. The complete gene cluster was found in p1,
together with the mosaic neurotoxin gene coding for
the C-type light (L)-chain and the C/D chimerical heavy
(H)-chain. The L-chain (residues 1-444) showed a 98%
sequence identity with the corresponding residues in CStockholm, but only 48% identity for the same region in
type D-1873. By contrast, the C-terminal part of the Hchain (residues 863-1280) shared 42% sequence identity
with phage C-Stockholm, but 95% to D-1873. The N
terminal part of the H-chain gene showed high similarity to both C and D types and was probably the place
where the recombination event once occurred.
p2BKT015925

The second-largest plasmid was nearly 100 kb. An interesting feature found in it was an alpha-toxin with conserved domains of the aerolysin superfamily. It showed
highest similarity to the alpha-toxin of C. septicum, which
has both necrotic and haemolytic properties [26]. Another
interesting feature was a homologue to the gene coding
for clostripain, which was found downstream of the alphatoxin. This type of cysteine endopeptidase has been found
in many clostridia, for example in C. novyi and C. botulinum group I genomes, but in those cases it was located on
the chromosome. The a-clostripain from C. perfringens
has been suggested to be involved in pathogenesis [27].
Two genes coding for metallo-beta lactamases and one for
penicillin amidase were also found in this plasmid; these
may contribute to resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
Three CRISPR regions were found, consisting of 28, 5 and
7 spacers. We also identified three Cas proteins (Cas3, 5
and 6) in proximity to the CRISPR loci.

Page 8 of 13

We compared the p2 plasmid to other group III plasmids (Figure 4B). Some conserved regions were present,
especially in the pCLG2 plasmids from C. botulinum
type D strain 1873. Interestingly, two large, conserved
blocks contained all putative virulence factors (except
for one protease), two of the Cas genes, and the penicillin amidase gene. Small, scattered, and conserved
regions were also shared with pC2C203U28 (and
pCLG1) and p3, indicating that genetic crossover events
have occurred. This is in contrast to the chromosome
and BoNT phage where rearrangements have been few.
p3BKT015925

Among the more interesting features of this 80 kb plasmid were two genes coding for putative lantibiotic ABC
transporters, and the two genes coding for C2 toxin.
Interestingly, the two C2 toxin genes were also found
on plasmid pC2C203U28 (and pCLG1), which otherwise
shared little resemblance with the p3 plasmid (Figure
4B). The amino-acid sequence of the C2I component
shared 96% sequence identity with that of plasmids C203U28 and pCLG1 and 100% with the C2I sequence of
C. botulinum strain (C) 2300 [28]. In contrast, the C2II
component was more diverged compared to strains
2300 and C-203U28 (88% identity to both). The C-terminal extension found in strain 2300 was also missing.
Consistent with previous observations [28], the divergence in the C-terminus of the C2II sequence contributed to most of the differences in sequence identity.
p4BKT015925

The majority of the coding sequences in this 40 kb plasmid were phage related, suggesting that this is a prophage. However, it also contained genes coding for
plasmid segregation and replication. Interestingly, the
GC content and GC skew were different for the prophage and the plasmid-replication part. This could indicate
that the prophage may have hijacked a plasmid-replication system.
p5BKT015925

The smallest of the plasmids (12 kb), found only in the
poultry isolates, contained two putative Epsilon type B
toxins. The sequence identity between the two toxin
genes was quite low (~40%). A putative homologue was
also found in the pCLG1 plasmid but the conservation
was low there as well. Two CDS were phage related and
all genes but one were located on the same strand.
Interestingly, this was a repressor-coding gene that
might regulate the transcription of the opposite, genedense, strand.
p6CSt

Among the CDS identified in this 55 kb plasmid found
in C-Stockholm (and V891), eleven were phage related,
suggesting that it is a prophage as well. Other genes of
interest were two for penicillin amidase and one for a
bacteriocin. The latter possibly inhibits growth of

competing bacterial strains. All CDS, except for four,
were located on the same strand.

It has been found that mobile element abundance in
clostridia varies between species and between strains
within the same species [13,29,30]. In the C. botulinum
group III genome BKT015925, many mobile elements
were found and some types were present in a high-copy
number indicating that the genome is influenced by
high transposon activity. To also compare the transposon distribution in the draft genomes (V891 and
BKT028387), we mapped reads spanning the insertion
points of the elements onto an in silico created transposon-free chromosome. The two poultry isolates
BKT028387 and BKT015925 had an identical transposon insertion pattern (data not shown). By contrast, the
wildfowl isolate V891 had a very different distribution of
transposons in its genome (Figure 5). It remains
unknown if these elements have moved sporadically
during a longer time or if there has been a massive
burst of relocations. An overview of the mobile elements
present in the chromosomes of BKT015925 and V891
compared to C. novyi-NT are presented in Table 3.
Included among the high-copy mobile elements that
showed an elevated transposon activity, there were elements related to the IS6, IS21, IS256 and IS1182
families. There was also a trans-located cassette of two,
tandem reverse-transcriptase (RT) genes. In total, the
mobile elements accounted for 3.4% of the genetic content of the BKT015925 chromosome and tended to be
placed in non-coding regions of both replichores (Figure

Figure 5 The transposon activity of high-copy mobile
elements. The mobile elements from the chromosome of
BKT015925 and V891 were mapped on a transposon-free consensus
chromosome generated in silico. The positions of the elements are
displayed with arrows. The high-copy elements displayed are
ISCbo1 (red), ISCbo5 (blue), ISCbo4 (green), ISCbo2 (brown), and a
tandem reverse-transcriptase; ISCbo3 (purple). ISCbo2 has in several
cases been inserted into the ISCbo3 element.

C. novyi-NT

1). Except for the IS21-related element, the mobile elements were inserted in intergenic regions, thereby
avoiding gene disruptions. IS elements were also found
on the three largest plasmids. Two types of elements
belonging to the IS200/IS605 family were found exclusively in the plasmidome. In fact, the density of mobile
elements was highest on p2 and p3, where 8 and 12%
respectively of the total genetic content constituted of
such elements. This was interesting because these two
plasmids seem to be more genetically dynamic than the
chromosome and p1 plasmid. The exchange of plasmids
between strains further increases the possibility of horizontal gene transfer facilitated by IS elements.
The IS6 element, ISCbo1, was most related to an IS
element, ISCpe7, found in C. perfringens. The ISCbo1
elements were found in 25 places (two broken) in the
BKT015925 chromosome, of which only eight were on
the same place in the V891 draft genome (Figure 5).
ISCbo1 elements were also found on p2 and p3. In most
cases, the elements were located directly upstream a
gene and were surrounded by 8-9-bp non-conserved,
direct repeats flanking a 10-bp inverted repeat (Additional file 4, Table S3). Although these elements were
not found on the BoNT-carrying prophage in
BKT015925, they had previously been identified in a
truncated form, between orfX and botR in the bont cluster of C. botulinum group I strains. It has been suggested that these elements, together with other closely
located transposons, have been the responsible machinery causing horizontal transfer of the bont cluster
between strains of C. botulinum [31].
The IS21-related element, ISCbo2, consisted of two
adjacent genes, integrase and istB. This element was also
found in the C. beijerickii NCIMB 8052 genome. IstB
has an ATP-binding motif, and is thought to be involved
in facilitating the contact between target DNA and a
transposase, in this case an integrase [32]. The ISCbo2
element was found on six positions on the chromosome
of BKT015925, and was also present on the three largest
plasmids. It showed a tendency to be incorporated into
another mobile element, a tandem reverse-transcriptase
(ISCbo3), thereby disrupting its structure. The incorporations were not at the same positions within the RT
gene. Small remnants of the IsCbo3 element were found

Skarin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:185
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/185

at several places in the genome which could be a consequence of ISCbo2 insertions.
The IS256 family element, ISCbo4, found in the C.
botulinum group III genome showed high amino-acid
sequence similarity (71% identity) to ISCpe3 found in C.
perfringens. The ISCbo4 element was identified on five
locations on the BKT015925 chromosome and on p1p3. The insertion pattern in V891 was quite different
from that in BKT015925 (Figure 5). The element was
also found on one location in the C. novyi-NT genome.
The IS1182 element ISCbo5 was previously identified
(as ISbma2) in numerous copies in the genome of C.
novyi-NT and Burkholderia pseudomallei/B. mallei
strains (4 and 48 copies, respectively) [14,33]. Seventeen
copies (including one broken) of this element were
located on the BKT015925 chromosome, while only
twelve copies were found in V891. Six of the copies in
V891 were found on the corresponding loci in
BKT015925. However, in some cases the insertion sites
were slightly altered, which indicates that they have
once left and then been reinserted in the same position.
There was only one copy within the plasmidome (on
p3). All insertion sites except one were composed of
inverted repeats forming a hairpin structure. The hairpin
structures were exclusively located at the end of genes
and most likely act as transcription stop signals. The
ISCbo5 element without a surrounding hairpin seems to
indicate that it is transcribed together with the upstream
gene. It has previously been suggested that such an element is the ancestral one [14]. This specific ISCbo5 element was also broken, indicating it might not be
tolerated by the host. The equivalent element (without a
surrounding hairpin) in the C. novyi-NT genome was
located next to a resolvase gene, but in strain
BKT015925 it was next to a cysteine desulfurase gene.
To test the hypothesis that it is a fused transcript, we
amplified the mRNA of the cysteine desulfurase gene by
RT-PCR. The gene was transcribed but was not fused
with ISCbo5 (data not shown).
Seven different elements belonging to the IS200/IS605
family (ISCbo6-12) were found in p1, and one in p2
(ISCbo13), where five of the IS605 elements were
located autonomously and two were found adjacent to
IS200 elements. ISCbo7 existed in two copies, both
autonomously and adjacent to ISCbo6. Interestingly, this
class of elements was only found in the plasmidome.
One of the IS200/IS605 elements was highly conserved
in the phage C-Stockholm (there called ISCbt4) but it
was not located at the same position. By comparing
flanking sequences, we located all IS200/IS605 elements
to the same positions in the V891 genome, suggesting
that these elements are less active than the previously
discussed ones.

Conclusions
The completion of the genome of C. botulinum group
III has revealed a relatively small chromosome indicating a low tolerance for redundant or excessive genetic
material. Acceptance for genes on the lagging strand
was also low indicating that high transcription efficiency
is crucial for this organism. Although there was a low
tendency for rearrangements in the chromosome, size
variation between strains indicated that there is an ongoing insertion and removal of genetic material. It is
probable that the abundant mobile elements are contributing to the genome remodelling process. The C. botulinum group III is genetically remote from the types
that can cause human botulism, but closely related to C.
novyi. There are larger differences between certain pairs
of C. botulinum group III strains than between some
group III strains and C. novyi. On the basis of these
facts, and in analogy with the handling of the Bacillus
cereus group, we propose a new genotypic name (genospecies), C. novyi sensu lato, for C. botulinum group III,
C. novyi and C. haemolyticum. However, it is unlikely
that the pathotypic name (pathospecies) is going to be
changed from C. botulinum.
In contrast to the conserved chromosome, we discovered that physiological group III has a remarkably large
and variable plasmidome where closely related isolates
can have different sets of plasmids. The largest plasmid,
the BoNT phage, seemed to obey the same evolutionary
rules as the chromosome. In the medium-sized plasmids, and to some extent in the smaller ones, genetic
material had been rearranged at a much higher rate and
with fewer constrictions. We hypothesise that these
plasmids are part of a larger pan-plasmidome and that
strains can exchange plasmids.
Mobile elements were abundant also within the plasmidome, where the medium-sized plasmids had the
highest transposon density, and they may have been
contributing to the mechanism of rearrangements. Interestingly, five out of six toxin types found within the C.
botulinum group III genome were located in the plasmidome. Our results suggest a model for genome evolution where a conserved core is located in the
chromosome while factors affecting pathogenicity are
located on a more plastic plasmidome to allow faster
environmental adaption without disturbing core
functions.
Methods
Bacterial strains and preparation of genomic DNA

Three toxigenic C. botulinum type C strains (07-V891,
08-BKT015925 and reference strain C-Stockholm) and
one non-toxigenic strain (07-BKT028387) were used in
this study. Strain V891 was isolated by the authors from

Skarin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:185
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/185

a wildfowl herring gull that had died from botulism in
Sweden in 2007. Strains BKT015925 and BKT028387
were isolated by the authors from poultry broilers that
had died during two separate botulism outbreaks in
Sweden in 2008 [2]. Bacterial strains were cultured overnight in anaerobic jars (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at
37°C in 9 ml pre-reduced TPGY broth. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min before
DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was purified using the
DNeasy blood-and-tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
DNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop
2000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA) and
the DNA was analysed by gel electrophoresis.
Genome sequencing and assembly

Sequencing of the genomic DNA was done by the
whole-genome-shotgun sequencing approach on the
Roche Genome Sequencer Titanium system (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The C-Stockholm and BKT028387 strains were sequenced with the
FLX chemistry. Approximately 5 μg genomic DNA was
subjected to standard 454 shotgun sequencing. The
BKT015925 strain was sequenced on a full picotiterplate resulting in 853 000 sequences with an average
length of 288 nucleotides. The coverage was approximately 80×. The draft genomes (V891, BKT028387 and
C-Stockholm strain) were produced on half a picotiterplate and yielded 385 000, 260 000, and 104 000
sequences respectively.
The sequences were assembled de novo using the GS
assembler (Newbler, Roche Applied Science). Gaps were
closed with help of the Consed package [34]. Sanger
sequencing of PCR products and local reassembly were
used to resolve gaps, misassemblies and unclear regions.
In total, 241 Sanger reads were incorporated into the
assembly. Reference guided assemblies were produced
with GS mapper or Consed-crossmatch. Genome alignments were made, primarily with Mummer [35] and
with the Artemis comparison tool (ACT) [36].
S1-PFGE

Agarose plugs of strains BKT015925, V891, and CStockholm were produced [2] and the gel plugs were
incubated with 0.1 units of S1 nuclease (Sigma, St.Louis,
MO, USA) for 45 min [37]. The digested DNA was analysed on a 1% agarose gel (Agarose NA; GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK) and electrophoresis was performed
in 14°C in HEPES buffer (16 mM HEPES-NaOH, 16
mM sodium acetate, 0.8 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The settings were 4 V/cm for 26 hours at pulse switch time
ramped from 0.5-15 s in a CHEF DRII apparatus
(BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). DNA from Salmonella
Branderup strain H9812 digested with XbaI and a

Page 11 of 13

lambda PFG marker (New England BioLabs, Ipswich,
MA, USA) were used as size markers.
Reverse transcription-PCR

Strain BKT015925 was cultured as described and RNA
was extracted using Trizol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RNA was converted into cDNA using random oligonucleotides and the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
procedure. PCR was carried out with gene-specific primers using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with denaturation at 95°C
for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s and extension at 72°
C for 1 min.
Gene annotation

Genes were defined with Glimmer 3 [38]. The annotation process was handled using Artemis software [39].
Circular plots were drawn with DNAplotter [40].
Further comparisons were made to Swissprot and NCBI
non-redundant protein database. Well-conserved genes
were automatically annotated but less certain annotations were manually assigned. The length, identity, and
coverage of the sequences of the subject versus query
were inspected. tRNAs were identified with tRNAscanSE [41] and rRNA by homology comparison to the C.
novyi-NT genome. CRISPR loci were found and analysed
using CRISPRFinder [42].
Mapping positions of mobile elements in draft genomes

A mobile-element-depleted genome sequence was generated by removing all high-copy mobile elements from
the chromosome of BKT015925. This depleted genome
sequence was then used as a consensus for all three
genomes (BKT015925, BKT028387 and V891). The
positions of the same multi-copy mobile elements in the
draft genomes were identified by making a set of GS
reference-guided assemblies for the elements and mapping the reads spanning the elements borders back to
the mobile-element-depleted genome sequence.
Phylogenomic comparisons

Phylogenomic distance was measured using the Average
Similarity of the conserved Core method (ASC) [20].
When the distance was large and the core was poorly
defined on the nucleotide level, total average similarity
was used. The dendrogram was created by converting the
similarity matrix to a distance matrix and calculating a
tree using the neighbor-joining method [43] and PHYLIP
3.67 through the Mobyle platform http://mobyle.pasteur.
fr/. The phylogenetic tree was plotted using PhyloDraw
0.82 http://www.bioinformatics.org/wiki/PhyloDraw.
