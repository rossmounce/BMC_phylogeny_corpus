Abstract
Background: Identifying the set of intrinsically conserved genes, or the genomic core, among
related genomes is crucial for understanding prokaryotic genomes where horizontal gene transfers
are common. Although core genome identification appears to be obvious among very closely
related genomes, it becomes more difficult when more distantly related genomes are compared.
Here, we consider the core structure as a set of sufficiently long segments in which gene orders
are conserved so that they are likely to have been inherited mainly through vertical transfer, and
developed a method for identifying the core structure by finding the order of pre-identified
orthologous groups (OGs) that maximally retains the conserved gene orders.
Results: The method was applied to genome comparisons of two well-characterized families,
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and identified their core structures comprising 1438 and 2125
OGs, respectively. The core sets contained most of the essential genes and their related genes,
which were primarily included in the intersection of the two core sets comprising around 700 OGs.
The definition of the genomic core based on gene order conservation was demonstrated to be
more robust than the simpler approach based only on gene conservation. We also investigated the
core structures in terms of G+C content homogeneity and phylogenetic congruence, and found
that the core genes primarily exhibited the expected characteristic, i.e., being indigenous and
sharing the same history, more than the non-core genes.
Conclusion: The results demonstrate that our strategy of genome alignment based on gene order
conservation can provide an effective approach to identify the genomic core among moderately
related microbial genomes.

Background
A growing body of evidence is supporting the idea that
horizontal gene transfers (HGT) have played a significant
role in prokaryotic genome evolution [1-6]. Although
these observations have stimulated researchers to develop
a new paradigm of HGT-driven reticulate evolution that
challenges the traditional tree-based phylogeny concept
[7-9], it can be argued that prokaryotic phylogeny can still

be inferred using a certain subset of genes ("core genes")
that have mainly transferred vertically throughout evolution [10-12]. In fact, the genes constituting a prokaryotic
genome appear to be divided into two classes: a "core
gene pool" that comprises intrinsic genes encoding the
proteins of basic cellular functions, and a "flexible gene
pool" that comprises HGT-acquired genes encoding proteins which function under particular conditions, such as

genomic islands [13]. Therefore, the identification of the
genomic core conserved among each taxonomic group is
crucial, not only for establishing the identity of each taxonomic group, but also for understanding prokaryotic
diversity and evolution. Moreover, in a practical sense, the
genomic core concept should also play a key role in summarizing genomic databases, which continue to grow
explosively [14,15].
However, the best way to define core genomes is yet to be
established. Although the term "core genome" has been
used in various contexts, in the context of intraspecific
comparisons, "core genome" is typically defined as a set of
genes shared by all strains, while "pan-genome" is defined
as the union of genes contained in all the strains considered [16-18]. This definition of "core genome" can also be
applied to genus-level comparisons [19], and actually,
similar types of analyses have been conducted for comparisons of even more distantly related genomes [20,21].
However, with such strict criteria, the number of core
genes often decreases excessively as the number of target
genomes increases [22], since the sets of genes required
for life can vary between organisms living in different
environments. The problem can be avoided by using a
relaxed conservation criterion rather than strict universality [22], but the problem of how to define a biologically
meaningful core still remains. Moreover, despite several
studies on how to establish plausible orthologous groups
[23-26], the problem of identifying genuine orthologs is
still difficult, especially for the comparison of prokaryotic
genomes where horizontal transfers are common. In fact,
in a strict sense, "genuine ortholog" is only meaningful
when the genes have been transmitted vertically, and in
that sense, "core genome" and "genuine ortholog" are
closely related concepts.
Due to the accumulation of microbial genomic data, we
can now compare genomes at various levels of relatedness
[14]. In this work, we focused on comparisons of moderately related genomes (more specifically, in the taxonomic
rank family), which we consider to be key for understanding prokaryotic evolution since they bridge the gap
between the knowledge of short-term evolution and that
of long-term evolution. Among such genomes, typically
the gene orders are partially conserved, and this information can be used to identify genuine orthologs (except in
the case where HGT is included by homologous recombination or independent insertions of segments carrying the
same set of genes at orthologous loci in different
genomes; see the Discussion section).
Here, we consider the structural core gene set, or simply
the core structure, of moderately related genomes; this
core gene set is defined as the set of sufficiently long consecutive genomic segments in which gene orders are con-

served among multiple genomes so that they are likely to
have been inherited from a common ancestor mainly
through vertical transfer (hereafter, unless otherwise
stated, by "core" we mean this type of core gene set,
whereas we use "universal" to refer to the genes shared by
all the genomes considered). For this purpose, we developed a graph-based algorithm for aligning conserved
regions of multiple genomes, which finds the order of preidentified gene families that retains to the greatest possible extent the conserved gene orders (Figure 1). To confirm that our definition of the core structure is indeed
biologically meaningful, we applied our method to
genome comparisons of two well-characterized families,
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, and characterized the
resulting core structures in terms of gene functions, essentiality, G+C content homogeneity and phylogenetic congruence.

Results
CoreAligner: procedure for constructing a core genome
alignment
Our program for constructing core structures, named
CoreAligner, requires a set of well-conserved orthologous
groups (OGs). Here, we compiled a set of OGs using the
DomClust algorithm [24] on the MBGD server [14], and
considered an OG as "conserved" when it was present in
at least half of the genomes (the parameter CONS_RATIO
= 0.5). Next, conserved neighborhood pairs were extracted
from the pairs of conserved OGs. We considered that two
OGs are in a neighborhood in a given genome if they are
located within 20 genes (MAX_GAP = 20) in that genome,
and that the OG pair is conserved if the two OGs in that
pair are in the same neighborhood in at least half of the
genomes (the parameter NBR_CONS_RATIO, which was
set equal to CONS_RATIO throughout this work). A
neighborhood graph, G0 = (V, E), was then constructed
with the set of conserved OGs, V, and the set of conserved
neighborhood relationships, E.

Our algorithm for constructing the alignments of the core
genome structures is based on finding the longest path of
the conserved neighborhood graph (Figure 1). A similar
algorithm has been previously developed [27] mainly for
identifying much shorter but more widely conserved gene
clusters such as operons and über-operons [28], but
unlike their method, our method considers not only
genes in the same direction but also those in the opposite
direction as neighboring genes, and thereby generally generates longer alignments. In addition, our method uses
the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for calculating
the longest path. To apply the DP algorithm, we devised a
heuristic scheme comprising a series of preprocessing procedures to convert the initial conserved neighborhood
graph, G0, into a directed acyclic graph, G3 (see Methods).
After that, the extracted longest path is added to the core

Schematic illustration of the core genome construction procedure
Schematic illustration of the core genome construction procedure. (A) A "core genome alignment" is defined as the
order of pre-identified conserved OGs (vertical lines) which retains to the greatest possible extent the conserved neighborhood relationships on the chromosomes (horizontal lines). (B) A neighborhood graph of (A), where a node (square) represents an OG, and an edge (line) represents a neighborhood relationship between OGs. Here, for simplicity, only OGs that are
directly adjacent to each other are connected, but, actually, the CoreAligner procedure connects all pairs of OGs that are
within MAX_GAP genes of each other in at least a given ratio (NBR_CONS_RATIO) of the total number of genomes.

structure when the path consists of more than 10 OGs
(MIN_CLUSTER = 10) and at least half of the genes (OGs)
in that path are present in every genome (SP_COVER =
0.5). The procedure is repeated to find the next longest
path in the remaining graph and the iteration is continued
until all such paths are found.
Core genome structure of Bacillaceae and
Enterobacteriaceae
We used two sets of moderately related genomes: eight
species belonging to the family Bacillaceae and eight species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae (Table 1),
among which gene orders are partially conserved (see
Additional file 1 for pairwise dotplots). In addition, we
used Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholerae as outgroup
species. We excluded endosymbionts with extremely
reduced genomes such as Buchnera and Wigglesworthia
from the Enterobacteriaceae set, although we included in

the analysis an endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, that has
a chromosome of more than 4 Mb containing 2432 open
reading frames (ORFs) [29]. On the basis of the pairwise
comparisons among these genomes (Additional file 1),
we considered that two pairs of genomes (Bacillus subtilis
and Bacillus licheniformis; Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus
cereus) in the Bacillaceae set and a set of three genomes
(Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Enterobacter sp.
638) in the Enterobacteriaceae set are related sufficiently
closely that they can be counted only once (Table 1). Consequently, the effective number of genomes was six in
both sets.
By applying the CoreAligner program to these datasets, we
obtained the alignments of the core structures of the Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae genomes comprising 1438
and 2125 OGs, respectively (Figure 2 and Additional file
2; for a full list of core genes, see Additional file 3). The

In the Group column, organisms with the same number are those considered to be so close that they are counted only once; organisms with an
asterisk are representative genomes for each of the closely related genome groups, which were used in the robustness test and the phylogenetic

number of Bacillaceae core genes is about a third of the
number of genes in the B. subtilis genome (4105), and the
number of Enterobacteriaceae core genes is about half of
the number of genes in the E. coli genome (4237),
although the actual numbers of core genes and total genes
are different among the organisms.
Table 2 shows the number of deleted core OGs for each
organism. The number of core genes is generally not correlated with the total number of genes in that genome. In
fact, although the B. anthracis genome (5311) contains
many more genes than the Geobacillus kaustophilus
genome (3498), B. anthracis has lost many more core
genes than G. kaustophilus; this is partly due to the partial
loss of the motility-related genes in the former genome
(see Figure 2D). This indicates that the substantial size difference among genomes is primarily accounted for by the
non-core genes, and any event yielding such a size difference affects the core genome structure to a lesser extent.
On the other hand, among the Enterobacteriaceae, the S.
glossinidius genome, which has the smallest number of
genes, has lost the largest number of core genes; the
number of its core genes is even smaller than that of the
outgroup species V. cholerae. The genome sequence of S.
glossinidius exhibits massive genome erosion, which sup-

ports the idea of the recent establishment of its endosymbiosis with the tsetse fly [29]. In this case, this erosion
process appears to have had an influence even upon the
reduction of the core structure. Similarly, the Serratia proteamaculans genome, which has the largest number of
genes, also has the largest number of core genes among
the Enterobacteriaceae (Table 2), although it is unclear
whether or not this extremely high conservation of the
core structure in the S. proteamaculans genome is indeed
related to its large genome size.
The chromosomal arrangements of the core structures are
somewhat different between these datasets (Figure 3).
Especially, a remarkable conservation was observed in the
chromosomal arrangement of the Bacillaceae core structure: the core genes are highly clustered and their overall
arrangements are well conserved, except some symmetrical inversions near the replication terminus, a typical pattern of bacterial chromosomal rearrangement [30]. In
contrast, the sizes of the gaps between the core regions
vary substantially among genomes, and most of the species-specific genes are inserted in these flexible regions.
On the other hand, the core genes of Enterobacteriaceae are
less clustered and more highly shuffled, although from
the sequence comparisons they generally appear to be

more closely related to each other than the Bacillaceae
genomes (see Additional file 1, upper right). Nonetheless,
they also primarily show the typical symmetrical inversion pattern around the replication origin.
Functional characteristics of the structural core gene sets
Next, we examined what kinds of genes are included in
the core gene sets. We considered the B. subtilis and E. coli
genomes as reference genomes and characterized each
gene in these genomes using the functional categories

defined in the KEGG Orthology database [31]. We also
categorized each gene in these genomes into the following
six classes: A) universal core, B) conserved core C) universal non-core, D) conserved non-core, E) non-conserved
and non-unique, and F) unique, where "universal" means
that the genes are conserved in all the genomes tested,
"conserved" means that the genes are conserved in at least
half of the genomes examined (the condition included in
the definition of "core"), and "unique" means that the
genes are unique to the reference genome (B. subtilis or E.

similarity of these distributions. Since those categories
with a smaller core proportion mentioned above are likely
to be related to adaptation to specific environments, this
observation supports the notion that the genes included
in the core structures indeed tend to play core functional
roles.

Figure 4 shows the proportion of these six classes for each
KEGG functional category. Although the overall proportions of core genes (A+B) are quite different between these
families, the two graphs primarily exhibit a similar tendency: the functional categories related to primary metabolism, genetic information processing and cellular
processes generally contain a higher proportion of core
genes, while the categories of membrane transport, signal
transduction and secondary metabolism contain a lower
proportion thereof. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the two 20-dimensional vectors of the core
gene proportions is ρ = 0.86, which confirms the high

genes conserved in all genomes but not included in the
core set (i.e., syntenically not conserved).

To see to what extent the core gene sets cover the functionally important genes, we examined the existence of the
essential gene sets that were identified from the systematic
gene deletion experiments in B. subtilis [32] and E. coli
[33]. In total, 251 out of 271 essential genes (92.6%) were
included in the B. subtilis core gene set, and 275 out of 297
essential genes (92.6%) were included in the E. coli core
gene set (Additional file 4). Therefore, most of the essential genes were included in our core gene sets in both
cases. In effect, the coverage of the essential genes in the
core gene sets might be even larger, because most of the
non-core essential genes are not universally conserved.
For example, among the B. subtilis essential genes that are
not included in the core gene set are the cell-wall teichoicacid biosynthesis genes (tag), the lack of whose orthologs
in G. kaustophilus genome has been previously reported
[34], suggesting that the essentiality of this system is not
universal. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the
comparison of the two independently identified E. coli
essential gene sets [33,35]. When we consider the intersection of the essential gene set of Baba and that of Kato, the
coverage increases up to 98.1% (256 out of 261 essential
genes; genes without an asterisk in Additional file 4).

Figure 4
Proportion of core and other classes in each KEGG functional category in the reference genome
Proportion of core and other classes in each KEGG functional category in the reference genome. The numbers
in parentheses after each category name are the numbers of genes in B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively.

Actually, the core gene sets of Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae share some common orthologs. To visualize this,
we identified the orthologous relationships between these
datasets by applying the DomClust program to the combined dataset (Figure 5A). The two core gene sets share
637 combined OGs that contain 703 and 682 OGs in
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively (class CC:
core to core), where the increase in the number of OGs in
each set is primarily due to lineage-specific duplications in
each family. On the other hand, 142 and 559 core OGs in
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively, have some
orthologs in the counterpart families that are not included
in the core OG set (class CO: core to non-core ortholog),
and 593 and 884 core OGs, respectively, are specific to
each family (class CN: core to none). As expected, the
majority of the essential genes (around 200 genes for
each) are included in the CC class. To further examine the
difference among these types, we studied the proportions
of the KEGG functional categories (Figure 5B). The "core
functional" characteristics of the core genes described
above appear to be mainly linked to the CC class. In fact,
most of the genes involved in primary metabolism and
information processing are included in the CC class (Figure 5B; see also the KEGG map shown in Additional file
5). On the other hand, one prominent feature of the CN
class in the Bacillaceae core is the larger proportion of the
sporulation function, an obvious Bacillus-specific function. In the CN class, the majority of OGs are uncategorized, while in the CC class the proportion of
uncategorized OGs is around 30%.

Parameter dependency and robustness of the method
Our method of core structure extraction includes some
arbitrary parameters, among which the two most important ones are CONS_RATIO and MAX_GAP, which define
the degree of conservation required for core genes and the
neighborhood of each gene, respectively (note that we set
NBR_CONS_RATIO = CONS_RATIO). Here, we examined
the dependency of these parameters on the results of the
core extraction in terms of the total number of genes in
the core set and the number of essential genes contained
in the core set (Figure 6A).

When the CONS_RATIO parameter was tightened from
0.33 (2/6) to 1.0 (6/6), the number of the resulting core
gene set decreased from 1690 to 834 in Bacillaceae and
2196 to 818 in Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 6A, left). Thus,
the size of the core gene set can be greatly influenced by
the CONS_RATIO parameter. On the other hand, the
effect of the MAX_GAP parameter was relatively small
(Figure 6A, right). The number of essential genes included
in the core gene set generally increased as the number of
core genes increased, but this number appeared to almost
reach the maximal value with our default parameter set
(CONS_RATIO = 0.5, MAX_GAP = 20). Thus, we can very
roughly say that, by using our default parameter set, we
were able to obtain the smallest core gene set that almost
maximally covers the essential genes.
Next, we examined the robustness of the resulting core
structures when changing the set of input genomes. In this

Figure 6
Results of the parameter dependency test and the robustness test
Results of the parameter dependency test and the robustness test. (A) The parameter dependency test. The total
number of OGs (line, left axis) and the number of essential genes (bar, right axis) included in the core set generated from the
Bacillaceae (red lines and peach bars) and Enterobacteriaceae (green lines and light blue bars) datasets are shown for each parameter value of the conservation ratio (left) and allowed gap size (right). (B) The robustness test. The average number of structural core (red), universally conserved (green) and ≥ 50% conserved (blue) OGs for each number of input genomes in the test
datasets that are generated as subsets of the original dataset of Bacillaceae (left) and Enterobacteriaceae (right). The error bars
show the standard deviations.

test, we extracted six genomes for each family by choosing
a representative genome from each set of closely related
genomes (organisms with an asterisk in Table 1), and generated all the possible subsets containing two to five
genomes. Then, using each of these subsets as the input
genome, we ran the CoreAligner program to define the
core structure and counted the number of resulting core
OGs. We also examined the numbers of universal
(CONS_RATIO = 1) and conserved (CONS_RATIO = 0.5)
OGs (regardless of whether they belonged to the core or
not) that were counted using the same subsets of
genomes. Figure 6B shows the average number of the core,
universal and conserved gene sets for each number of
input genomes. As expected, the number of universal
genes decreases monotonically as the number of genomes
increases. In contrast, the number of conserved genes fluctuates widely with the change in the number of genomes,
probably because the actual CONS_RATIO values fluctu-

ate due to the rounding-up effect even when a constant
cutoff value (0.5) is used. Curiously, the distributions of
these average values appear to be very similar between
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, although the latter has
much larger variances than the former. On the other
hand, the number of core genes is quite different in the
two families, as already mentioned in the previous sections. This clearly indicates that our criterion based on
syntenic conservation defines a quite different set of core
genes than the criterion based only on the presence of
genes in each genome. Moreover, the number of core
genes shows a relatively stable pattern in both families
(Figure 6B). In fact, although similar fluctuations, probably due to the rounding-up effect, are again observed, the
magnitude of fluctuation is much smaller than that for the
conserved genes described above. These observations suggest that the use of synteny information with a relaxed
conservation criterion (CONS_RATIO < 1) helps the Core-

Aligner program to identify robust and reliable core gene

still remains somewhat arbitrary.

butions with relatively sharp peaks. Similar distributions
can be seen in classes B (core-conserved), C (noncore-universal) and D (noncore-conserved), but their shapes and
sizes are different depending on the organism. The distributions of classes E (nonconserved) and F (unique) are
generally broader and of a more irregular shape. The range
of each distribution can be seen more clearly in the box
plots (Figure 7, lower), which show that, generally, the
core genes (A and B) are distributed within smaller ranges
than the non-core genes. To examine the relationship in a
more quantitative manner, we calculated the mean and
the standard deviation for each distribution and compared the results (Additional file 6). We can confirm that
the standard deviation generally increases in the order of
A to F, and more specifically, that the relationship A, B <
C, D < E, F holds in all of the 16 genomes, except that the
latter inequality does not hold in the S. glossinidius
genome where the number of non-core genes is extremely
small. The smaller variance of the GC3 percentage of the
core genes appears to support our working hypothesis that
the core structure is generally indigenous to each genome.

G+C content of the third codon positions
Our main working hypothesis is that the core structure
extracted here is mainly inherited through vertical transfers throughout evolution. Several methods have been
developed for identifying horizontally transferred genes
[4], and detecting anomalous nucleotide compositions is
a common approach for identifying them using a target
genomic sequence alone [36-40]. Among them, the G+C
content of the third codon positions (GC3) is the most
basic but still an effective characteristic, although the
"amelioration" process unfolding in the course of
genomic evolution may diminish its effectiveness [41].
Since it is known that highly expressed genes such as
ribosomal proteins also have specifically biased codon
usage that generally correlates with tRNA abundance [42],
we predicted highly expressed genes based on the codon
usage of ribosomal proteins [43] and eliminated them
from the analysis.

From the box plots in Figure 7, we can see that there are
some outliers in the core classes, and in some cases the
number of outliers in the core classes is even larger than
that of outliers in the non-core classes. However, we
should notice that the number of genes and the distribu-

We calculated the GC3 values of the genes in each genome
and examined their distribution for each of the six classes,
A-F, defined above (Figure 7, upper). The GC3 values of
the class-A genes (core-universal) show bell-shaped distri-

Figure 7
Distribution of the GC3 percentages
Distribution of the GC3 percentages. The distributions are shown for each of the six classes, A-F, as a histogram (upper)
and a box plot (lower) for each genome. In each box plot, whiskers are extended at most 2.5 times the interquartile range, and
outliers are indicated by vertical bars.

tion shapes are quite different among the classes, and thus
a direct comparison of the number of outliers in these
plots is meaningless. To understand this point more precisely, we identified the genes with significantly biased
GC3 values using the condition |x-μ|/σ > 3.29, where μ
and σ are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively, of the GC3 values of the core genes (classes A and
B), and the cutoff value corresponded to p < 0.001 (for a
single comparison) when normal distribution was
assumed. Then, we compared the ratios of genes with
biased GC3 values to the total number of genes between
classes (Additional file 7). The result indicates that the
ratios of the biased genes again generally increase in the
order of A to F. Especially, the ratios are less than 1% in
class A for all species and class B for most of the species,
which is again consistent with our working hypothesis.
Phylogenetic analysis
If the core structure in each genome indeed shares the
same evolutionary history, we can construct a very reliable
phylogenetic tree by using a long concatenated sequence
comprised of the core genes. For this purpose, we collected the universally conserved, one-to-one correspondence core OG sets comprising 712 and 1081 OGs for
Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively, and constructed phylogenetic trees using the concatenated alignments of the conserved blocks in these sequences
comprising 199502 and 334889 residues, respectively.
Using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [44] and the
maximum likelihood (ML) method [45], we were able to
obtain highly resolved phylogenetic trees in which most
of the branches, except some very short branches in the NJ
trees, had bootstrap values of 100%, but the tree topologies constructed by different methods did not exactly
coincide with each other (Figure 8A). In fact, such high
confidence levels can be attained simply because of the
extremely large sample sizes (number of alignment columns) and do not necessarily indicate the true reliability
if there exists a systematic bias [46]. To examine whether
the data indeed support tree-like phylogeny, we also constructed phylogenetic networks using the NeighborNet
algorithm [47] (Figure 8B). The results showed that some
internal branches exhibited a network-like (non-tree-like)
structure that generally indicates a reticulate event such as
horizontal transfer [48]. Especially, in the Enterobacteriaceae phylogeny, a network-like structure was found
around the center of the phylogenetic radiation where the
internal nodes were concentrated. Although the degree of
incongruence appears not to be so large, this structure can
obscure the phylogenetic relationship among organisms
branching from there, and probably caused the above discrepancy of phylogeny.

To further investigate the congruence among the core gene
phylogenies, we constructed ML trees of individual core

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/515

OGs and compared them. As a result, we found 208 and
370 distinct topologies in the Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae datasets, respectively, which are fairly large considering that there exist only 945 possible topologies among
the 7 taxa examined here; the majority-rule consensus
trees of these individual trees showed the same or a similar topology to the concatenated ML trees (Figure 8A)
(data not shown). We visualized the set of the resulting
tree topologies using multidimensional scaling (MDS)
analysis based on the Robinson-Foulds topological distance [49] (Figure 8C). The results were again contrasting:
there are three distinct major topologies that correspond
to the alternative topologies of the ambiguous relationship in the Bacillaceae dataset (enclosed by the dotted
ellipse in Figure 8C, left), whereas a more dispersed distribution can be observed in the Enterobacteriaceae dataset
(Figure 8C, right). These observations clearly indicate that
there is a severe limitation when inferring phylogeny
using only a single or very few genes. The problem cannot
be avoided even when using some "gold standard" genes;
the phylogenetic topologies of the 16S and 23S rRNA
sequences, the genes most conventionally used for inferring phylogeny, are located far from the representative
topologies in our MDS plot (except Bacillaceae 23S rRNA,
which is fairly close to the representative one) (Figure 8C).
Unfortunately, the observed topology dispersion (Figure
8C) also appears to challenge our working hypothesis that
all core genes share the same evolutionary history. However, we should consider the effect of the statistical fluctuation behind the variation of tree topology. To examine
this, we performed a Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [50]
for each of the core OGs and estimated the number of
OGs whose individual ML tree topologies are significantly
different from that of the representative genomic tree
topology taken from the ML tree of the concatenated core
sequences (see Figure 8A). In this test, we also performed
the same test using the non-core OGs that have a one-toone correspondence; here, we considered non-universal
OGs as well as universal ones because there are only a few
universal non-core OGs, and summed up the results for
each of the effective number of genomes (N) contained in
the OGs (Table 3). When using a significance level of 5%,
we found that 4.3% (32/739) and 4.1% (45/1099) of the
core OGs of Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively, with N = 7 had significantly different topologies
from the representative one (Table 3). In other words, the
observed number of significantly different cases was
within the expected value (5%). Therefore, the number of
incongruent cases may not be as large as it appears to be
in Figure 8C. In contrast, in total, around 20% of the
tested non-core OGs had significantly different topologies
at the 5% level (Table 3). Fisher's exact test showed that
the number of incongruent cases of the non-core OGs was
significantly larger than that of the core OGs, except in the

The SH test was performed for all OGs (both core and non-core)
that have a one-to-one correspondence using the TREE-PUZZLE
program with the ML topology (or its subtree) of the concatenated
core sequences (Figure 8A) as a reference tree, and the numbers of
rejected (significantly incongruent) cases were compared between
core and non-core classes using the Fisher's exact test. The first
column (N) indicates effective number of genomes where genomes of
closely related species were counted only once. The column
"rejected" indicates the number of cases rejected by the SH test at a
significance level of 0.05; the number in parentheses is the percentage
of rejected cases. The last column indicates the p-value of a one-sided
Fisher's exact test.

case of N = 7 in Enterobacteriaceae, where the sample size
of the non-core cases was extremely small (Table 3).
Therefore, we can conclude that the core genes indeed
have a greater tendency to exhibit congruent phylogenies,
at least in comparison with the non-core genes. Note that
a greater congruency of the core than that of the non-core
is observed in virtually every group of effective number of
genomes (N), indicating that the issue of whether it is the
core or not is more directly connected to phylogenetic
congruency than the universality of genes. Note also that
the dataset used to construct the reference tree of this test
is included in the cell of (N = 7, core) in Table 3, which
means that the comparison at N = 7 may be somewhat
unfair but the comparisons at other N are not.

Discussion
In this work, we developed a method for identifying the
core structure among moderately related microbial
genomes by constructing a genome alignment based on
the consensus gene order. We applied the method to the

genome sets of the families Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and characterized the resulting core structures in
terms of gene function, essentiality, nucleotide content
and phylogenetic relationship. The results showed that
the core structures covered functionally important genes
(Figure 4 and Figure 5), including most of the essential
genes (Additional file 4), and generally had more homogeneous GC3 values (Figure 7) and phylogenetic tree
topologies (Table 3) than the non-core genes. All of these
characteristics are to be expected in light of the core
genome concept. We also examined the parameter
dependency and robustness of our method, and found
that it can offer a more robust core genome definition
than simpler approaches that consider only universality
or a fixed conservation ratio as the criterion (Figure 6B).
This robustness enabled us to define plausible core structures even when some of the genomes have degenerated
due to changes in environmental conditions such as those
arising from symbiosis (Table 2) that have made the existence of certain core genes unnecessary (as long as the ratio
of degenerate genomes is sufficiently smaller than the
CONS_RATIO parameter; actually, it is probably better to
eliminate extremely small genomes to avoid unexpected
effects). On the other hand, our method is dependent on
the conservation ratio parameter (Figure 6A). Although
we believe that the parameter setting used here is better
for defining plausible core gene sets in terms of coverage
of the core functions for both Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, we might need to use different parameters when
we consider different taxonomic groups. In fact, it might
be better to use more relaxed conditions when we analyze
genomes whose core structure is subject to substantial disruption. Another related issue is the size of the core, which
is likely to decrease when the diversity of the group for
which the core is determined increases. Here, we showed
that the core of Enterobacteriaceae (2125 genes) is larger
than that of Bacillaceae (1438 genes), and that Bacillaceae
is indeed more diverse than Enterobacteriaceae, at least in
terms of sequence diversity (see Additional file 1, upper
right and Figs. 8A and 8B). However, the relative frequencies of genomic rearrangement and nucleotide mutation
may be different among different lineages, and to investigate this issue in a more quantitative manner, we need to
extend the analysis to a broader range of taxonomic
groups. Applying our method to more varied taxonomic
groups is an important future task.
In this work, we used the coverage of the essential genes as
an indicator for evaluating the core gene sets. Consequently, most of the functionally important genes are
included in the resulting core gene sets, especially in the
intersection of the two core gene sets (Figure 5). On the
other hand, the resulting core gene sets also include substantial uncharacterized genes, and many of the taxonspecific core genes are still functionally uncharacterized

mosomal position. Although both the GC3 analysis and
the phylogenetic analysis generally support the hypothesis that the extracted core genes are indigenous and share
the same evolutionary history, there are some exceptional
cases. For example, several genes with extremely biased
GC3 values were found in the core genes (Figure 7) and
some core genes appear to have significantly different
phylogenetic tree topologies from that of the concatenated core sequences (Figure 8 and Table 3). Although the
SH test showed that the number of incongruent cases may
not be as large as it appears to be (Table 3), it should be
noted that the SH test has been suggested to be too conservative [12,51].

The rationale behind our definition of "core genome" as
an indigenous, vertically transmitted structure based on
syntenic conservation is that horizontally transferred
genes are unlikely to insert themselves at the same chro-

Actually, we used a relaxed criterion for syntenic conservation (CONS_RATIO < 1) in our core genome alignment
procedure. Therefore, some of the exceptional cases could
have arisen due to this relaxed criterion. Notable exam-

(see Figure 5, but note that the genes to which a KEGG category is assigned are not necessarily uncharacterized). It is
natural to think that such taxon-specific core genes have
some important but to date uncharacterized functions
that are related to taxon-specific features, since they are
likely to have been inherited in that taxon throughout
evolution, although we generally need more extensive
analysis with a greater variety of genomes to claim taxon
specificity. However, we should also note that the significance of the gene order conservation of individual core
genes can vary from gene to gene, and that some of them
could be less important but co-inherited simply as "hitchhikers."

ples are shown in Figure 9, where two possible operons
related to the histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways, respectively, contain genes with significantly incongruent phylogeny identified by the SH test (Table 3). In
both cases, the operonic structures are apparently translocated in the B. anthracis, B. cereus and O. iheyensis genomes
from the conserved core arrangement (Figure 9A), and
genes in the same set of genomes also form a cluster distinct from the other Bacillaceae genes in the phylogenetic
tree of each family (Figure 9B), suggesting that these operonic structures were likely to be replaced with horizontally acquired ones in these organisms. Although only a
limited number of significantly incongruent cases were
found in the core by the SH test here, this phenomenon
might be more common because we can find similar
small local rearrangements in the resulting core structure
(see Additional file 2). Nevertheless, we dot not consider
it a serious problem, since it is an expected consequence
of our definition of the core, where genes are inherited
"mainly" rather than "exclusively" through vertical transfer. On the other hand, a more serious concern may arise
if the gene order in the resulting core structure is only very
poorly conserved, especially when one uses too large a
MAX_GAP: the similarity of the relative gene location
rather than the conservation of the exact gene order might
be a result of convergent evolution, which is not what we
expect. Although we think that the resulting core structures presented here are so well-ordered that they are
unlikely to suffer from this problem, in order to avoid the
problem in more general cases, we may need to introduce
some solution, such as a statistical measure, to give guideline to users who must choose appropriate parameter values.
In addition to the problems arising from the relaxed conditions, there are more fundamental exceptions to the
above rationale. One such exception occurs when horizontally transmitted segments insert themselves into the
same (orthologous) target sites. In fact, we encountered
such a case during the experimental construction of the
Enterobacteriaceae core structure (Additional file 8), where
the region is conserved in only four genomes, but in three
of the four cases the region is located at the same site
(adjacent to the yjdC gene). This region in the S. enterica
genome indeed corresponds to the genomic island named
"Stic134F" defined in the Islander database [52], and
there are Phe-tRNA genes at both ends of each of these
regions, which are likely to have been a common integration site of this island. We eliminated these regions by
introducing a procedure to identify locally non-conserved
regions in each genome (see Method, step 5). However,
the current procedure depends on the somewhat ad hoc
assumption that inserted segments exceed a certain
length. Therefore, although we believe that the procedure
worked at least for the dataset of this study, additional evi-

dence, such as genes (or pseudogenes) or repetitive elements related to some mobile elements, might be needed
to correctly identify such regions in more general cases,
and one may need other tools (e.g., [53]) for such tasks.
Homologous recombination is another factor that can
disrupt the evolutionary homogeneity of the core genes
defined through synteny. Although the importance of
recombination within a bacterial population has been
demonstrated in several species [54,55], direct genetic
exchange among the genomes compared here is very
unlikely, because here we compared only moderately
related genomes where nucleotide identities between
orthologs are in many cases only 60–70% and hence there
is little chance of having the sufficiently long identical segments required for successful homologous recombination
[56-59]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that
recombination occurred frequently during a certain
period after speciation, which might explain the observed
network-like phylogeny (Figure 8B). In addition, a successive chain of recombination events between closely
related sequences could result in genetic exchange
between more distantly related genomes, and the recombination rate might have been elevated by inactivation
followed by the reacquisition of mismatch repair proteins,
as suggested for E. coli strains [60]. On the other hand,
there are some exceptions to the above nucleotide identity
range, among which the most notable ones are the rRNA
genes; the identities between the rRNA genes are generally
more than 90%. This might give a plausible explanation
why the topologies of the rRNA gene trees are so different
from those of the concatenated trees (Figure 8C), as
pointed out previously [8,55]. In any case, the possibility
of homologous recombination across a species boundary,
if any, should be an inherent feature of prokaryotic
genome evolution, and could have been involved in the
core genome formation. Therefore, the extraction of core
structures among genomes at various levels of relatedness
can provide a basis for further studies of this phenomenon.
Although we have focused on the problem of identifying
the genomic core among moderately related prokaryotic
genomes throughout this work, our genome alignment
method itself does not assume any particular prokaryotespecific features, and thus, in principle, can be applied to
more general purposes, including eukaryotic genome
comparison. There have been numerous studies on multiple genome comparison, which we think can be primarily
classified into the following categories: (1) nucleotide
sequence alignment among closely related genomes [6164]; (2) gene order comparison among moderately
related genomes for investigating the genomic rearrangement history [65-67]; (3) finding conserved gene clusters
among distantly related genomes for identifying operons

and über-operons [27,68,69]. At first glance, the problem
of the present study may appear to be most similar to (2).
In fact, the problem of finding consensus gene orders considered here can also be formulated as a median breakpoint problem assuming a star-like phylogeny [65].
However, here we used a strategy similar to that of
Rogozin et al. [27], mainly because the core genome identification problem has a "local alignment"-like nature, in
that its goal is to extract well-conserved genomic segments, in contrast to the general median problem whose
goal is to find a consensus order that spans the entire
genome. We think that our approach has a practical
advantage especially for the bacterial core genome extraction described here, but possibly also for eukaryotic
genome comparison when well-conserved regions are
limited. One drawback of our current approach is that it
assumes star-like phylogeny and cannot treat hierarchical
phylogenetic relationships among genomes. One way of
incorporating such relationships is to introduce a weighting scheme, which has been investigated in the field of
multiple sequence alignment (e.g., [70]). Another more
interesting approach is to consider the evolutionary scenario more explicitly when constructing an alignment
(e.g., [71]). In any case, the incorporation of phylogenetic
relationships is crucial for investigating the evolution (formation or erosion) of the core structure, which is an
important next step toward understanding prokaryotic
genome evolution.

Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that the procedure (CoreAligner) for multiple genome alignment based on gene
order conservation can provide an effective approach to
identify the genomic core among moderately related
microbial genomes. Identifying the genomic cores among
various taxonomic groups will provide a basis for further
comparative studies utilizing the rapidly accumulating
genomic data for understanding microbial diversity and
evolution.

construct the OGs, we used the DomClust algorithm
implemented on the MBGD server, which can handle
both inparalogous relationships and domain fusion/fission events in the process of ortholog grouping [24],
although, in principle, other programs or databases can
also be used for this purpose. Figure 10A gives an overview of the CoreAligner procedure, which consists of the
following steps: 1) extraction of the conserved neighborhood relationships and construction of an initial conserved neighborhood graph, G0; 2) assignment of a
consistent orientation based on the minimum spanning
tree of G0 and construction of a directed graph, G1; 3) conversion of G1 into a triplet graph, G2, in which each edge
represents the arrangement of three genes rather than two
genes; 4) elimination of the loops from G2 and construction of a directed acyclic graph, G3; 5) identification of the
paths of maximum weight on G3 using the dynamic programming algorithm; 6) construction of an alignment by
restoring the original graph. In the following, we describe
the procedure step by step.
Step 0: Extraction of the conserved OGs
Before the procedure, we retained only those OGs that are
conserved among at least a given ratio (CONS_RATIO) of
the total number of genomes. Throughout this procedure,
the genomes that are close enough to each other are
grouped so that the genomes in each group are counted
only once in order to avoid bias; here, we used the species
groups shown in Table 1, which were determined through
visual inspection of the pairwise comparison data (see
Additional file 1). Let F denote the resulting set of conserved OGs, and let G be the set of genomes compared.
We consider each genome, G ∈ G, as an ordered gene list,
LG = [g1, g2,..., gN], where each gene, gi, in LG is ordered
according to the genomic position on G and belongs to
one of the conserved OGs, Fj ∈ F. Let orderG(g) denote the
ordinal position of the gene, g, in the list LG. We define the
distance between genes g1 and g2 on the circular genome,
G, as Dist(g1, g2) = min [Diff(g1, g2),| LG|-Diff(g1, g2)],
where Diff(g1, g2) = |orderG(g1)-orderG(g2)|.

Methods
Preparation of genomic data
We used the Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD) [14,72] in order to construct the
orthologous groups (OGs) of the specified sets of related
genomes. In this work, we used two sets of genomes
belonging to the families Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae
(Table 1), as per the NCBI Taxonomy database for taxonomic classification.
Construction of a core genome alignment by ordering the
OGs
Our procedure, CoreAligner, for constructing an alignment of the core structure basically consists of finding the
best conserved ordering of a pre-identified set of OGs. To

Step 1: Generation of the initial conserved neighborhood graph
In this step, we extract the OG pairs that are located within
MAX_GAP genes in at least NBR_CONS_RATIO (=
CONS_RATIO, by default) of the total number of
genomes and construct a conserved neighborhood graph.
First, let us define a neighboring OG pair. A gene pair, g0,
g1 ∈ G, is a neighboring gene pair if Dist(g0, g1) ≤
MAX_GAP, and an OG pair, F0, F1 ∈ F, is a neighboring
OG pair if there exists a neighboring gene pair g0, g1 such
that g0 ∈ F0, g1 ∈ F1. Let Ng(F0, F1) denote the set of neighboring gene pairs between F0 and F1. We also consider a
relative direction for each neighborhood OG pair. The relative direction between two neighboring genes, denoted
by Rdir(g0, g1), is either (L, L), (L, R), (R, L) or (R, R),

The procedure for constructing a core genome alignment
The procedure for constructing a core genome alignment. (A) Overview of the procedure, which consists of the following steps: (1) Initial conserved neighborhood graph. The color of each edge (red or blue) indicates that two genes incident
to it are in the same or opposite directions, respectively. (2) Assignment of a consistent orientation based on the MST. The
edges included in the MST are drawn with sold lines, and other edges are drawn with broken lines. The node colors represent
node directions, Dir(F). The edges are directed according to the resulting orientation, except the edge indicated by the X mark
that cannot be assigned a consistent orientation; vertices incident to a blue edge should be in opposite directions (assigned different colors) in a consistent orientation. (3) Conversion of the original graph (gray) to the triplet graph (red). (4) Elimination
of loops. The eliminated vertex is indicated by the X mark. (5) Identification of the maximum path of the graph. The maximum
path is indicated in red. (6) Restoration of the original graph and construction of the genome alignment. (B) Determination of
the representative relative direction between two neighboring OGs, F0 and F1, by majority vote. (C) An example of conversion
of an original neighborhood graph to a triplet graph. (1) A neighborhood graph comprising six nodes (OGs) and seven edges.
The red and blue lines indicate the two genomes used to construct the graph. Node 2 contains two (in)paralogous lineages that
cause loop formation. (2) A triplet graph resulting from the conversion of graph (1). Note that the graph contains no loop. (3)
A neighborhood graph resulting from a conversion back from the triplet graph (2). Note that node 2 is divided into two nodes.

where L and R signify the left and right end of each gene,
respectively, and the relative direction between two neighboring OGs, denoted by Rdir(F0, F1), is determined by
majority vote among (g0, g1) ∈ Ng(F0, F1) (Figure 10B). In
this majority vote, each neighboring gene pair is weighted
as a function of the reciprocal of distance, weight(g0, g1) =
[1/Dist(g0, g1)]α, with the parameter α. Throughout this
work, we simply set α = 1.
Let c be the number of neighboring gene pairs in the
majority direction, i.e., |{(g0, g1)|Rdir(g0, g1) = Rdir(F0,
F1)}|. The pair (F0, F1) is considered to be a conserved OG
pair if c satisfies the conservation criterion (c/N ≥
NBR_CONS_RATIO)). Among the conserved OG pairs,
we further extract the proximal OG pairs, which are
defined as follows: a conserved OG pair F0, F1 is a proximal conserved OG pair if there exists a pair of neighboring
genes, g0 ∈ F0, g1 ∈ F1, between which there is no gene g2
∈ F2, such that either (F0, F2) or (F2, F1) is a conserved OG
pair. Finally, the conserved neighborhood graph, G0 = (V0,
E0), is constructed with vertices V0 = F and edges E0 ⊆ V0 ×
V0 that are the set of proximal conserved OG pairs. On
each edge, an edge weight is assigned as the sum of the
weights
of
the
neighboring
gene
pairs:

Weight(F0 , F1) =

∑

g 0 , g 1∈Ng( F0 , F1 )

1 / Dist( g 0 , g 1) .

Step 2: Conversion to a directed graph (direction assignment)
In this step, we construct a minimum spanning tree
(MST), TM, of the conserved neighboring graph, G0, and
assign a consistent orientation to each vertex and edge
based on the relative direction on each edge of the tree,
TM; thus the procedure converts the undirected graph, G0,
into a directed graph, G1. To construct the MST, a
weighted distance is assigned to each edge (F0, F1) as
Wdist(F0, F1) = 1/Weight(F0, F1), so that highly weighted
edges are likely to be incorporated into the MST. For each
F ∈ F, a vertex orientation, Dir(F) = {1, -1}, is determined
based on the MST TM as follows: starting from an arbitrary
vertex, F0 ∈ F, for which we set Dir(F0) = 1, the orientation
is determined along each edge, (Fi, Fj) ∈ TM, by Dir(Fj) =
Dir(Fi) × sgn [Rdir(Fi, Fj)], where sgn(rdir) = 1 if rdir ∈ {(R,
L), (L, R)} and sgn(rdir) = -1 otherwise (see Figure 10B; in
Figure 10A2, the node colors and edge colors represent
Dir(Fi) and sgn [Rdir(Fi, Fj)], respectively, where red = 1
and blue = -1). In addition, the orientation of each edge,
(Fi, Fj) ∈ TM, is determined by Dir(Fi, Fj) = Dir(Fi) ×
side(Fi, Fj), where side(Fi, Fj) = 1 if Fj is on the right side of
Fi and side(Fi, Fj) = -1 otherwise (Dir(Fi, Fj) is represented
by an arrow in Figure 10A2). Here, the edge orientation
represents the consensus gene order, and the node orientation represents the consensus gene orientation along the

virtual genome. The orientation can be consistently
assigned as long as it is done along a tree. In addition, for
each remaining edge, (Fi, Fj) ∈ {e|e ∈ E0, e ∉ TM} (broken
lines in Figure 10A2), the edge orientation is calculated by
the same formula, Dir(Fi, Fj) = Dir(Fi) × side (Fi, Fj), but
the orientation is assigned only when the values calculated from both directions is consistent, i.e., Dir(Fi, Fj) = Dir(Fj, Fi); otherwise, the edge is removed from the converted graph, G1 (X mark in Figure 10A2). Finally, a
directed graph, G1 = (V1, E1), with vertices V1 = F and edges
E1 ⊆ V1 × V1 is constructed by connecting the vertices from
Fi to Fj if Dir(Fi, Fj) = 1 and from Fj to Fi if Dir(Fi, Fj) = -1.
Step 3: Conversion to a triplet graph
In this step, the directed graph, G1, is converted into a triplet graph, G2, in which each edge represents the order of
three OGs (Fi, Fj, Fk), rather than two OGs (Fi, Fj), as in
each edge of the graph G1. For this purpose, a neighborhood OG list, Nf(g, side) = {F'|Dist(g, g') ≤ MAX_GAP,
side(g, g') = side, g' ∈ F'}, is prepared for each g ∈ F and
side ∈ {-1,1} (-1 and 1 signify the left and right sides,
respectively). To convert G1 = (V1, E1) into G2 = (V2, E2),
we set V2 = E1, and connect each pair of edges in G1 incident to a node, Fj ∈ V1, i.e., (Fi, Fj), (Fj, Fk) ∈ E1 = V2, in G2
in this direction if there exist some genes, g ∈ Fj, such that
Fi ∈ Nf(g,-1) ∧ Fk ∈ Nf(g,1). This conversion guarantees
that the triplet order (Fi, Fj, Fk) represented by each edge
of the graph G2 will actually appear in at least some
genomes (the parameter NBR_CONS_NUM2; default 2).
Figure 10C shows a simple example illustrating the effect
of this conversion. Here, the OG represented by node 2
contains two inparalogous subgroups, due to which the
graph contains a loop (Figure 10C1). However, the triplet
graph conversion linearizes the graph (Figure 10C2),
since the path of 5-2-3 in the original graph, which is
responsible for the loop formation, does not exist in the
actual sequences.
Step 4: Conversion to a DAG (loop elimination)
Although the triplet graph conversion at the previous step
can eliminate some trivial loops as described above, generally there still remain loops in the directed graph, G2. In
this step, we eliminate all loops by removing some vertices from the graph G2 (corresponding to the edges of the
graph G1) to make a directed acyclic graph (DAG), G3.
Since the problem of finding the minimum number of
vertices to cut in a directed graph required for making a
DAG (the minimum feedback vertex set problem) is NPhard, we used a heuristic method called a "contraction
algorithm" [73], which returns a correct answer when the
graph is completely contractible through a series of contraction operations defined in the algorithm; otherwise,
the algorithm still returns a valid answer within a reasonable time period, although its optimality is not guaranteed. Fortunately, it turned out that all cases treated here

Page 18 of 22

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:515

were contractible and hence the algorithm could solve the
problem correctly. We conjecture that the graph G2 is contractible in most cases if the compared genomes are sufficiently close.
Step 5: Extraction of the set of paths of maximum weight
In this step, we find the longest paths in the DAG, G3 =
(V3, E2), using a DP algorithm. For this purpose, we assign
a weight to each vertex, v ∈ V3 = E1, which actually corresponds to a neighboring relationship (Fi, Fj), as Weight(v)
= Weight(Fi, Fj). The basic recursion formula for finding
the path of maximum weight is as follows:
TotalWeight(v m ) =

max (TotalWeight(v n ) + Weight(v m )),

v n ∈Out( v m )

where vn, vm∈ V3 and Out(vm) is the set of vertices in which
the out-edges of vm enter. The pair of vertices in the above
formula is saved as an arc (vm, vn) of a directed graph (a set
of trees, or forest), TP, which can be backtracked to find
the path of maximum weight. The extracted maximum
path, which we here call a "cluster," is added to the core
structure if it meets the following criteria: (1) it contains
at least a given number of OGs (the parameter
MIN_CLUSTER; default 10), and (2) at least a given proportion of OGs are present in each genome (the parameter SP_COVER; default 0.5). The latter criterion is required
to eliminate lineage-specific clusters, which are likely to
belong to phages or genomic islands rather than the
genomic core.
In some cases, a "local version" of this latter criterion is
needed to eliminate problematical cases. In fact, during
experimental applications of the CoreAligner procedure
to the Enterobacteriaceae dataset, we encountered such a
case where an apparent genomic island was included in
the core structure (Additional file 8; see also Discussion).
To eliminate such regions, we first identified locally sparse
regions on each genome by finding a maximal scoring segment with a scoring system of absence = +1 and presence
= -1, and if this score exceeded a certain cutoff point (here
we used 20) in at least one genome, the resulting region
was subjected to the test with the above SP_COVER criterion to determine whether the region should be removed
or not.
To find out the path of the next maximum weight, we used
a similar strategy to that for finding non-intersecting suboptimal sequence alignments [74]: each vertex of the maximum path is marked as deleted and assigned a bad score
(-∞), and all of its descents are once removed from TP.
Step 5 is repeated and the scores of the removed nodes are
recalculated by DP and TP is reconstructed to find the next
maximum path. The procedure is repeated until no (undeleted) vertex remains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/515

Step 6: Construction of an alignment from the paths of maximum
weight
The set of paths extracted in the previous step is actually a
triplet graph, which should be converted back to the original graph. This conversion can be done straightforwardly:
for example, a path of 1:2-2:3 can be simply converted
into 1-2-3. However, an interesting situation arises when
an OG contains some inparalogous lineages, as in the
example in Figure 10C, which may cause multiple appearances of the same node in the alignment path. Even in
such a case, a genuine ortholog can typically be found
among the inparalogs by examining the context of the
alignment path (nodes 2.1 and 2.2 in Figure 10C3). To
solve this problem, CoreAligner scores each gene according to the matching of the local context around it, and
takes the best-scoring gene as a genuine ortholog. Here,

the weight of the gene, g0 ∈ F0, is defined as

∑ 1/

g 1∈F1

Dist G ( g 0 , g 1)Dist C (F0 , F1) , where DistG and

DistC are the distances along the genome, G, that contains
g0 and g1 and the consensus alignment, C, respectively,
and the summation is taken over all g1 ∈ F1 such that
DistG(g0, g1) ≤ MAX_GAP and DistC(F0, F1) ≤ MAX_GAP.
Identification of orthologs between Bacillaceae and
Enterobacteriaceae
To examine the correspondence between the core gene
sets of Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, we generated the
OGs of the combined dataset of these two families by the
DomClust program. Each OG of an individual family, say
FB of Bacillaceae, is considered to correspond to an OG of
the combined dataset, say FC, if more than half of the
members of FB are included in FC. Then, we considered
that two OGs of Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, say
FBand FE, respectively, correspond to each other if both FB
and FE correspond to the same OG of the combined dataset, say FC.
Essential gene analysis
The sets of B. subtilis essential genes (271 genes) [32] and
E. coli essential genes (300 genes) [33] were taken from
the original papers. Three genes (yabQ, yafF, yibJ) were
eliminated from the E. coli set, since those ORFs are
treated as pseudogenes in the current RefSeq database. For
the E. coli essential gene set, we also referred to the essential gene set of Kato et al. (302 genes) [35] obtained from
the PEC database [75]. By taking the intersection of these
two data sets, we obtained a more rigorous essential gene
set containing 261 genes.

G+C content of the third codon positions (GC3)
For the calculation of the GC3 values, we used only genes
comprising more than 100 codons. We also eliminated
from the dataset putative highly expressed (PHX) genes
that have specifically biased codon usage patterns. Here,
we used a simplified version of the previously proposed
procedure to define the PHX genes [43]: a gene, g, is considered to be a PHX gene if the predicted expression level
of g defined as ERP (g) = B(g|All)/B(g|RP) exceeds 1.05,
where B(g|G) is the codon usage difference of g relative to
the given gene set, G, according to Karlin and Mrázek [43],
and All and RP denote the sets of all genes and ribosomal
proteins in a given genome, respectively. This procedure
eliminated around 150–300 genes for each genome in our
dataset as PHX genes.
Phylogenetic analysis
To simplify the phylogenetic analysis, we used only OGs
that have a one-to-one correspondence (i.e., those containing neither duplication nor domain fusion/fission
events). For each OG, a multiple sequence alignment was
generated by CLUSTALW [76], and from that alignment
the conserved alignment blocks suitable for phylogenetic
analysis were extracted by the Gblocks program [77]. In
order to create the phylogenetic trees of the core structure,
we constructed a concatenated sequence alignment of the
universally conserved one-to-one core OGs, and created a
neighbor joining tree [44] using the CLUSTALW program
and a maximum likelihood tree using the MOLPHY program [45] under the JTT model [78]. In addition, we created a phylogenetic network using the Neighbor-Net
method [47] implemented in the SplitsTree program [48].

We also conducted phylogenetic analyses for individual
core genes; here, maximum likelihood tree construction
and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test were performed using
the TREE-PUZZLE program [79] under the JTT model. In
this test, the relationships among the closely related species shown in Table 1 were fixed, and all the remaining
possible topologies (maximally 945 topologies among
the 7 taxa) were generated and tested. Here, we considered
the ML topology of the concatenated core sequences (Figure 8A), or an appropriate subtree of it when considering
a non-universal OG, as a representative genomic tree, and
compared it with the ML topology of the individual OG.
