Abstract
Background: Members of the pacifastin family are serine peptidase inhibitors, most of which are
produced as multi domain precursor proteins. Structural and biochemical characteristics of insect
pacifastin-like peptides have been studied intensively, but only one inhibitor has been functionally
characterised. Recent sequencing projects of metazoan genomes have created an unprecedented
opportunity to explore the distribution, evolution and functional diversification of pacifastin genes in the
animal kingdom.
Results: A large scale in silico data mining search led to the identification of 83 pacifastin members with
284 inhibitor domains, distributed over 55 species from three metazoan phyla. In contrast to previous
assumptions, members of this family were also found in other phyla than Arthropoda, including the sister
phylum Onychophora and the 'primitive', non-bilaterian Placozoa. In Arthropoda, pacifastin members were
found to be distributed among insect families of nearly all insect orders and for the first time also among
crustacean species other than crayfish and the Chinese mitten crab. Contrary to precursors from
Crustacea, the majority of insect pacifastin members contain dibasic cleavage sites, indicative for
posttranslational processing into numerous inhibitor peptides. Whereas some insect species have lost the
pacifastin gene, others were found to have several (often clustered) paralogous genes. Amino acids
corresponding to the reactive site or involved in the folding of the inhibitor domain were analysed as a
basis for the biochemical properties.
Conclusion: The absence of the pacifastin gene in some insect genomes and the extensive gene expansion
in other insects are indicative for the rapid (adaptive) evolution of this gene family. In addition, differential
processing mechanisms and a high variability in the reactive site residues and the inner core interactions
contribute to a broad functional diversification of inhibitor peptides, indicating wide ranging roles in
different physiological processes. Based on the observation of a pacifastin gene in Placozoa, it can be
hypothesized that the ancestral pacifastin gene has occurred before the divergence of bilaterian animals.
However, considering differences in gene structure between the placozoan and other pacifastin genes and
the existence of a 'pacifastin gene gap' between Placozoa and Onychophora/Arthropoda, it cannot be
excluded that the pacifastin signature originated twice by convergent evolution.

Background
According to the NCBI platform (National Center for Biotechnology Information) more than 150 metazoan
genome projects are in progress or completed and up to
36 million EST sequences are available http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. Comparative analysis of this
huge dataset, covering numerous species of both vertebrates and invertebrates, has already proven to be a powerful tool to predict new gene products, facilitating their
molecular characterization, illustrating cross species
sequence homology, unraveling gene structures and
revealing expansion or reduction of gene families during
evolution. This report focuses on inhibitors of serine
peptidases and more specifically on an inhibitor family of
the S1 peptidases. According to the MEROPS peptidase
database [1], the S1 family is, by far, the largest family of
serine peptidases, comprising 144 known members in
humans, 314 and 318 members in the two mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, and 264 in Drosophila melanogaster. The number of identified peptidase
inhibitors, however, is lower in insects than in humans.
While in the MEROPS database 150 peptidase inhibitors
are listed from humans, only 32, 11 and 42 have been
annotated in the genomes of the Diptera A. aegypti, A.
gambiae and D. melanogaster, respectively. In spite of this
apparent discrepancy, previous studies have reported several members of the pacifastin peptide inhibitor family
(I19 in the peptidase/inhibitor MEROPS database), all of
which have been identified in arthropod species.
All pacifastin members that have been identified at the
molecular level are precursor peptides sharing a common
domain organization; an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a variable number of inhibitor domains. These
domains are designated as PLDs (Pacifastin Light chain
Domain) in reference to the light chain of pacifastin, the
first member of the pacifastin family that was found in the
crustacean species, Pacifastacus leniusculus [2,3]. All other
pacifastin-related precursors (PP) that have been identified by cDNA cloning originate from only one other crustacean species, the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis,
and from a few insect species belonging to the orders of
Orthoptera and Hymenoptera [4-8]. However, previous in
silico data mining studies have predicted additional pacifastin members in various other insect orders [9-11].
In crayfish, the pacifastin precursor consists of nine inhibitor domains or PLDs which are not processed into single
domain peptides [3]. In insects, however, nearly all identified PPs are believed to be processed into smaller inhibitor peptides conforming to the presence of putative
dibasic cleavage sites between inhibitor domains [58,12,13] and the detection of several insect (locust) PLDrelated single domain peptides in the haemolymph [12].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/97

The structural and biochemical characteristics of locust
pacifastin-related inhibitors have been intensively studied
by 1H NMR, crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis
and activity studies [8,12-20]. All PLD-related domains
have a characteristic conserved pattern of six cysteine residues (Cys1 – Xaa9–12 – Cys2 – Asn – Xaa – Cys3 – Xaa –
Cys4 – Xaa2–3 – Gly – Xaa3–6 – Cys5 – Thr – Xaa3 – Cys6).
Detailed analysis of the 3-D structure has shown that
these six residues form three disulfide bridges (Cys1-4,
Cys2-6, Cys3-5), giving members of the pacifastin family
a typical fold and remarkable stability [16,18-21]. Each
pacifastin-like inhibitor domain contains a reactive site
(P1-P1') that is involved in the binding of the target peptidase and is located near the C-terminal end between the
last two cysteine residues [20]. Inhibitor activity studies
on the crayfish pacifastin and on locust pacifastin-like
inhibitors have confirmed that the peptidase specificity is
mainly determined by the residue at the P1-position
[8,12-14,16,17,20]. Although pacifastin-related peptides
share a common conformation, the family can be divided
into at least two separate groups (I & II) based on different
intramolecular interactions in the inner core region [22].
The variability of the reactive site residues (P1-P1') and of
the inner core structure, as well as the occurrence of additional interaction sites, contribute to peptidase specificity
and species selectivity of the pacifastin family members
belonging to these two groups. Contrary to the detailed
knowledge on structural and protease-inhibiting properties of locust pacifastin-like peptides, very little is known
about their in vivo function(s) [9].
In crayfish, pacifastin itself is involved in the regulation of
an immune response process (the prophenoloxidase cascade) [3,23-26]. In insects, however, there is no direct
proof for a particular physiological function of the pacifastin family. Contrary to the situation in crayfish, locust
pacifastin-like PI (SGPI- and SGPI-2) were not able to
inhibit the endogenous prophenoloxidase activation cascade [27]. Nevertheless, detailed PP transcript profiling
studies led to the suggestion that insect pacifastin-related
peptides [6-8,27-29] may possess multiple functions as
regulators of a wide diversity of serine peptidase-dependent processes [12,17,30].
This paper reports on a detailed, comparative in silico analysis of the sequences, the phylogenetic distribution and
the domain organization of pacifastin-related precursors
among Arthropoda and other phyla. In addition, based
on a wide range of metazoan genome data, the structure,
distribution and evolution of pacifastin genes among
metazoan species were studied in an attempt to make predictions concerning the possible 'origin' of the ancestral
pacifastin gene.

Methods
Database searches
In search of (novel) members of the pacifastin family in
the available genome and EST databases, BLASTN and
TBLASTN algorithms were performed, using a list of 16
known pacifastin-related precursor sequences from the
Uniprot protein database as a query [9]. For both BLAST
programs the expected threshold was adjusted to 0.1. In
addition, for the TBLASTN program the BLOSUM62
matrix was used and a word size of 3 was selected when
blasting PP sequences, while for the shorter PLD-like
domains the word size was 2. For precursor sequences
Detailed searches were performed on the vast number of
nucleotide sequences available via the NCBI platform
(National Center for Biotechnology Information) http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. As a complementary
approach, various databases of individual species containing new sequences that are not yet incorporated into the
NCBI platform were analyzed [see Additional file 1]. In
addition, annotated databases as Butterflybase and Ensembl
were searched via keywords and/or protein family accession numbers in clustered EST data and/or predicted gene
structures. In silico predicted genomic sequences were
manually verified using EST sequences (if possible). The
identity of the newly predicted pacifastin-related members was further confirmed by scanning the Interpro protein database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/. This
also provided a more detailed view on the domain organization of PP. The open reading frame (ORF) of the
sequences and the presence of a signal peptide were predicted using BESTORF http://www.softberry.com and SignalP
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/,
respectively. To check and further complement previous
search results, novel sequences were used as additional
queries.
Strategy
The data mining search was performed in a systematic
way; covering as many phyla, classes and orders as possible. Per phylum of the animal kingdom (as defined by
NCBI taxonomy), sequence data sets were analyzed for
the presence of PP-encoding sequences and, whenever
this was possible, additional searches were performed in
subphyla, classes, orders and families of the phylum. All
predicted PP-encoding sequences were assigned to simplified phylogenetic trees (see below) to obtain an overview
of the presence of pacifastin-like peptides in numerous
(sub)phyla, classes, orders, families and species, as well as
to visualize the origin and evolution of the pacifastin gene
family.
Cloning of TCPP-1
Whole bodies of adult red flour beetles were added to
reaction tubes containing 'Green Beads' (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Then, the samples were homogenized,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/97

total RNA was extracted and the resulting RNA was reverse
transcribed as described by Breugelmans et al. (2008)[28].
Three different gene specific primers (U1: 5'-ATGAAGACCCTCATCCTGTG-3'; D1: 5'-ACAGTACACAGTAATTAGAG-3' and D1b: 5'-GGCTGGCAAACGGTATTTCT-3',
SIGMA) were designed based on the genome predicted
TCPP-1 sequence [GenBank: XM_966374]. PCR reactions,
cloning and sequence analysis were preformed as
described by Simonet et al. (2005)[8]. Subsequently, the
nucleotide sequences were compared with genomic
sequence data to analyze the gene structure as well as the
precursor domain organization of the cloned sequences,
as described below.
Gene organization of pacifastin-related precursors
In combination with genomic sequences, EST-sequences
were used to confirm the predicted ORF and to identify
possible splice variants of the PP transcripts. To study the
intron-exon organization of pacifastin genes in more
detail, EST and/or cDNA sequences were aligned with
genomic
sequences
using
Splign
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/splign/splign.cgi. If no
complete ORF was found, the Softberry splice finder tool
(FSPLICE) was used to search the missing intron-exon
junctions in pacifastin-related genes http://linux1.soft
berry.com/berry.phtml.
Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments were performed on subsets of the
obtained PLD-related domains http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/clustalw2/index.html in order to compare amino
acid sequences of the reactive site, the core region and
other regions that might be involved in enzyme-binding
and/or inhibitor stability. To study the evolution of pacifastin genes, simplified phylogenetic trees were composed
with different metazoan taxa based on the most recent
molecular phylogenomic data [31-38] and on the Tree-ofLife web project http://www.tolweb.org/tree/phylog
eny.html. Additional information on the classification
system (phylum, class, order, family and genus) and on
the number of known genomes, nucleotide and protein
sequences was obtained from the NCBI taxonomy

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/
Browser/wwwtax.cgi.

Results and Discussion
Novel pacifastin-related precursors
Identification of pacifastin-related precursor peptides
All sixteen pacifastin-related precursor peptide sequences
from the Uniprot protein database were used as queries
for an initial search of genomic/EST databases. Then, in
search for additional PP-encoding sequences the query list
was extended with newly found pacifastin-related
sequences from other phyla, orders and classes.

A list of all identified PPs (83), the number of PLD-like
domains per PP and the nature (genomic, EST, cDNA and
protein) and accession numbers of the encoding
sequences are provided as Supplementary data [see Additional file 2]. In contrast to previous studies, novel PPs
were not only identified in many arthropods, but, for the
first time, also in species belonging to other phyla. A pacifastin-related precursor was predicted in a non-bilaterian
species belonging to the phylum of Placozoa, Trichoplax
adhaerens. This precursor, named TAPP-1 according to the
nomenclature of Simonet et al., (2002) [5], codes for 42
PLD-related inhibitor domains and is by far the longest
member of the pacifastin family that has been identified
so far. Another non-arthropod PP was found in the velvet
worm, Epiripatus sp. [see Additional file 2]. Four PLDrelated inhibitor peptides were predicted based on two
sequences from a small cDNA library [39] of this onychophoran species. However, additional sequence information will be needed to verify whether (or not) these
domains belong to the same precursor.

The amino acid sequences of all previously and newly
identified members of the pacifastin family are provided
as supplementary data [see Additional files 3 and 4]. In
total, 83 PP and 284 PLD-related inhibitor domains were
analyzed. Even though in most species one or two PP have
been found, the presence of additional PP in these or
other species can not be excluded as their genome is not
yet (fully) assembled and/or due to very few EST sequence
data. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable variation in the number of genes with a pacifastin-like signature in the assembled genomes of insect species, ranging
from only one or two pacifastin genes [e.g. ampp-1 in the
honey bee (Apis mellifera), aapp-1 in the yellow fever mosquito (A. aegypti), agpp-1 in the African malaria mosquito
(A. gambiae), tcpp-1 and tcpp-2 in the red flour beetle (T.
castaneum)] to at least 8 PP-encoding genes in the jewel
wasp, Nasonia vitripennis [see Additional file 2]. Other
examples of species that express a multitude of PPs are the
locusts, Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria (7 and
4 known PPs, respectively).

In line with previous findings, members of the pacifastin
family appear to be present in a wide variety of insects. In
addition to the earlier identified PPs [2,3,5-8,12,13,40],
more than 70 new pacifastin-like precursors have been
identified, distributed over 26 families covering nearly all
insect orders. Interestingly, a pacifastin-like precursor was
also discovered in a springtail species belonging to
another class of Hexapoda, the Ellipura. This PP codes for
three PLD-like inhibitor peptides.

Although the vast majority of PPs contain between 1 and
5 PLD-like domains, the number of domains per PP varies
from 1 to 42 [cf. the PP from T. adhaerens (Placozoa)]. The
number of PLDs in crustacean PPs varies between one in
Calanus finmarchicus, and nine PLDs in the crayfish, P. leniusculus, while the variability in the number of PLDrelated domains in insect PPs is even bigger; ranging from
one in SGPP-2 of the desert locust, till nine and thirteen
PLDs in the PPs of the dipteran, Culex quinquefasciatus and
the caterpillar, Bombyx mori, respectively [see Additional
file 2].

Contrary to the wide distribution of pacifastin members
in Hexapoda, previous studies had only identified two
crustacean PP (pacifastin in the freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, and ESPP-1 in the Chinese mitten crab, E. sinensis) [2-4]. A detailed in silico search of the subphylum of
Crustacea resulted in the prediction of seven new PPs, that
altogether code for 22 PLD-like inhibitor domains, in six
different species of various crustacean orders [see Additional file 2]. Thus, the pacifastin family appears to be
widely distributed within Crustacea and ongoing or future
genome projects are expected to reveal the existence of
even more members of this family.
Domain organization of pacifastin-related precursors
All pacifastin-related precursors that have been identified
so far, share a common domain organization that resembles the one of neuronal peptide precursors; they contain
a signal peptide leading to the extracellular secretion of
the mature protein, followed by one or more PLD-related
inhibitor domains. Depending on the presence and the
position of dibasic cleavage sites the secreted precursor
peptide will subsequently be processed into smaller, single and/or multi domain inhibitor peptides.

Previous studies showed that all multi-domain pacifastinrelated precursors in insects contained dibasic cleavage
sites between the PLD-like inhibitor domains, while no
cleavage sites were found in pacifastin itself. To verify
whether this characteristic is systematically different in
these subphyla, and what is the situation in other phyla,
the primary structure of all identified PPs was compared
[see Additional file 3]. While dibasic cleavage sites
appeared to be absent in PPs of crustacean species, with
the exception of a PP in the flat porcelain crab, Petrolisthes
cinctipes, they were found to be very common in insect
PPs. In insects, nearly 90% of all predicted multi-domain
PPs possess dibasic cleavage sites. In 60% of these PPs,
PLD-related domains are separated by dibasic cleavage
sites in such a way that a full post-translational processing
would result in single domain inhibitor peptides.
Although the processing of PPs is still hypothetical for
most species (since the analysis is mainly based on in silico
predictions), several locust PPs have already been shown
to be cleaved into single domain inhibitors [12]. The
apparent higher complexity of post translational processing of insect PPs may coincide with an additional level of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:97

regulation by prohormone convertases. Spatio-temporal
differences in the expression of processing enzymes may
therefore result in a more selective production of inhibitor
peptides. Comparison of the primary structures of nonarthropod PPs revealed the presence of dibasic cleavage
sites between sequential PLD-like domains of the PP
found in Onychophora. In the PP of the more primitive
placozoan species, T. adhaerens, that has 42 PLD-like
domains, only one putative dibasic cleavage site was
found.
Based on this information, it seems likely that pacifastin
genes encoding multiple PLDs that are separated by dibasic cleavage sites already occurred before the divergence
between Arthropoda and Onychophora, implying that
most crustaceans PPs may have 'lost' these cleavage sites
more recently, after their divergence from Hexapoda.
Obviously, additional PP sequences of onychophoran
and other more 'primitive' ecdysozoan species are needed
to confirm this hypothesis.
Enzyme specificity of pacifastin-related inhibitor peptides
Each pacifastin-like inhibitor domain is composed of an
exposed 'canonical' peptidase binding loop (P3-P3') (for
nomenclature see Schechter and Berger [41]) that is
anchored to the compact core region by two disulfide
bridges. The 'canonical' loop contains the reactive site
(P1-P1') that is involved in the binding of the target peptidase and is located near the C-terminal end between the
last two cysteine residues [13,17,42]. The peptidase specificity of pacifastin-like inhibitors is, as in other canonical
inhibitors, mainly determined by the residue at the P1position. Inhibitor activity studies of locust pacifastinrelated PI have shown that these peptides are serine peptidase inhibitors of either trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like
peptidases according to the nature of the residue at the P1
position [8,12-14,16,17,20].

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of all predicted
pacifastin family members revealed 17 different residues
at the P1 and 14 at the P1' position, together forming as
many as 74 different pairs [see Additional file 4]. The high
variability of both residues of the reactive bond suggests
that pacifastin-like PI cover a wide range of serine peptidase specificities. Based on the nature of the P1 residue,
nearly half of all predicted metazoan PI (45%) are trypsinlike inhibitors, while 30% are predicted inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like peptidases. A small fraction (5%) contains
a small, neutral amino acid (Gly, Ala and Val) at the P1
position corresponding to the interaction with a third
type of serine peptidases, the elastase-like enzymes.
Although the effect of an acidic or amide P1-residue (Asp,
Glu, Asn and Gln) on the inhibitor's specificity is not yet
known, 13% of all predicted PI contain such a residue.
The remaining 7% also have unknown peptidase specifi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/97

city, though the peptidase inhibitors with an unconventional Thr or bulky Met residue at the P1-position might
be specific towards chymotrypsin-like peptidases.
In the 'most ancient' predicted pacifastin precursor (TAPP1), 30 of the 42 PLD-related domains can be predicted as
trypsin-like protease inhibiting, 4 PLDs can be expected to
inhibit elastase-like enzymes, while the specificity of the
remaining 8 PLDs is unknown. Noteworthy is the apparent absence of chymotrypsin-like enzyme inhibiting peptides in this phylum. In contrast, all PLDs of the PP from
Epiperipatus sp. (Onychophora) appear to have chymotrypsin-like specificity. In Crustacea and Hexapoda the
peptidase specificity of the pacifastin-related inhibitor
peptides is more variable. In crustacean species, most
multi-headed pacifastin-like inhibitor peptides contain
the three types of specificity, suggesting that they can
inhibit a broad spectrum of peptidases. As in crustaceans,
these three PI specificity types are present in most insect
orders. However, PI with specificity towards elastase-like
enzymes are rare. In addition, a number of PI with
unknown specificity was found in Diptera, Lepidoptera,
Hymenoptera and Hemiptera (Supplement 4). The
processing of insect PP into single or double domain
inhibitor peptides with a high variability in enzyme specificity is in line with the idea that insect pacifastin-related
members play a role in a variety of physiological processes.
Gene structure
Simonet et al. (2003) were the first to report the gene
structure of a pacifastin-related member in the African
malaria mosquito, A. gambiae [11]. The growing amount
of assembled insect genomes has led to the prediction of
more pacifastin-related genes in insects. However, these
predictions are the result of automated genome sequence
analyses and are not always accurate. Therefore, the PP
gene structures of six insect species from five different
orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenopteran
and Phthiraptera) and of the 'ancient' placozoan Trichoplax PP were analyzed and compared. In all except the latter species, EST sequences were used to verify the
predicted gene structure. The tapp-1 gene of T. adhaerens
has a remarkable intron/exon architecture (Figure 1). The
gene consists of 88 exons, and is the most complex pacifastin-like gene studied so far. The signal peptide is
encoded by the first exon, while each of the 42 PLD-like
inhibitor domains is coded for by two neighboring exons
as illustrated in Figure 1. Each exon of the Trichoplax pp
gene codes for nearly half of the PLD-like domain including three cysteine residues. As a result, only when both
exons are combined three S-S-bonds, critical for the PI
conformation, can occur.

Figure 1
Gene structure of the tapp-1 gene of Trichoplax adhaerens
Gene structure of the tapp-1 gene of Trichoplax
adhaerens. The upper part of the figure visualizes the tapp-1
gene structure. The 88 exons are depicted as boxes and
numbered accordingly, while the horizontal connecting lines
represent the intron regions. The first box corresponds to
the exon that codes for the signal peptide (S). The exons in
grey and white encode the respective first and last half of a
particular PLD-related domain. Exons 4, 87 and 88 correspond to regions of the tapp-1 gene that do not code for
PLD-related inhibitor domains. The last box (exon 88) contains the stop codon (shown in black). The bottom part of
the figure shows in more detail how the combination of two
exons (7 and 8) is needed to form one PLD-related domain
(e.g. PLD-3). For every 'exon-pair', the first exon codes for
the first three cysteine residues of the PLD-related domain
(in grey), while the last three cysteines are encoded by the
second exon (in black). The diagram underneath illustrates
the topography of the three disulfide bridges stabilizing the
typical pacifastin-like fold.

Also in insect PP-encoding genes, the first exon codes for
a signal peptide. One exception is the signal peptide of
NVPP-1 that is encoded by two neighboring exons. Contrary to the Trichoplax tapp-1 gene, a single PLD-like
domain or even multiple PLDs are coded for by one exon.
This observation indicates that exon duplications,
whether or not followed by in-frame exon fusion, are one
of the evolutionary events that may have led to the formation of more complex pacifastin genes, encoding PPs with
multiple inhibitor domains combining two exons into a
single PLD-like domain encoding exon. Despite this general characteristic for insect PP genes, there are some variations in the intron/exon structure and transcript splicing.
Two pacifastin-like genes (tcpp-1 and tcpp-2) are present in
the genome sequence of the red flour beetle, T. castaneum.
The tcpp-1 gene is annotated to code for a single PP containing
three
PLD-related
domains [GenBank:
XM_966374]. Analysis of the gene structure shows that
the first exon codes for a signal peptide and that the second and third exon code for one and two PLD-like
domains, respectively. However, manual analysis of additional EST sequence data revealed two splice variants of
the TCPP-1 transcript, both of which are different from
the annotated transcript. To verify our observation, prim-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/97

ers were designed to amplify both predicted splice variants. Using the primer set (U1-D1) two fragments of
different length were amplified by means of RT-PCR. In
addition, a second reverse primer (D1b) was derived to
specifically amplify the presumed shorter variant. Analysis
of the different PCR products, confirmed the occurrence
of a short (279 bp) and a long (399 bp) transcript. Further
sequence analysis showed that the difference between
both variants is due to differential splicing of the third
exon of the tcpp-1 gene. The (long) transcript codes for a
pacifastin-related precursor (TCPP-1a) that contains a signal peptide and two PLDs (TCPD-1 and TCPD-2). Due to
a stop codon at the end of the TCPD-2 encoding sequence,
the third PLD is not translated (Figure 2A: splicing scenario a). The TCPP-1b-mRNA, on the other hand, is
shorter because the first part of exon III (encoding TCPD2) is spliced out (Figure 2A: splicing scenario b).
Splice variants of PP-encoding genes are also found in
mosquito species (Diptera) and seem to be a more common phenomenon for the insect members of the pacifastin family. In A. aegypti; a 'manual' EST analysis of the
aapp-1 gene revealed the existence of at least two transcript
variants (Figure 2B). Because splice variants are confirmed
with EST sequences, the lack of splice variants in the other
studied insect pacifastin genes can be due to a limited
availability of EST sequence data. The previously incorrect
prediction of TCPP-1 shows that, in some cases, conventional cloning techniques and 'manual' corrections based
on ESTs are necessary for a correct annotation. This is also
illustrated by the automated prediction of the agpp-1 gene
of A. gambiae: while the previously predicted gene product
only contained three PLDs, our 'manual' analysis of the
genomic sequence has revealed a more complete ORF
encoding 4 PLD-like domains.
While A. aegypti, A. gambiae and the hemipteran pea
aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, contain only one pacifastin
gene, other insect species (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and
Phthiraptera) have multiple pacifastin gene copies (Figure
3). These genes are often clustered, indicating recent gene
duplication events. In case of the Jewel wasp, N. vitripennis, at least eight pacifastin genes are predicted in the
genome (Supplement 1). The nvpp-2, -4 and -5 genes are
clustered, as are the nvpp-1, -3, and -8 genes and the nvpp6
and -7
genes [GenBank: NW_001815570,
NW_001817237 and NW_001815682 respectively]. EST
sequence data are available for the nvpp-1, -2, -4, -5 and 7 genes and more in depth analysis showed that the nvpp1 gene has a rather exceptional gene structure (Figure 3).
This gene contains eight exons and codes for four PLDlike domains. In contrast to all other insect PP genes, the
signal peptide is encoded by two neighboring exons
instead of one. In addition, the exons III and IV of the
nvpp-1 gene code for an internal fragment that does not

Gene structure and alternative splicing of the tcpp-1 gene (A) and the aapp-1 gene (B)
Figure 2
Gene structure and alternative splicing of the tcpp-1 gene (A) and the aapp-1 gene (B). The left part of the figure
visualizes the tcpp-1 and aapp-1 gene structure; the silver boxes correspond to the untranslated regions, the three exons are
indicated as white and grey boxes, while the horizontal connecting lines represent the intron regions. In both genes, the third
exon encodes multiple PLD-related domains (grey and white boxes) and contains a stop codon (pictured in black). The right
part of the figure visualizes two splicing scenarios (a and b) that finally lead to two different pacifastin-related precursor peptides. (A) Splicing of the tcpp-1 gene according to scenario a results in a precursor polypeptide that codes for a signal peptide
(white arrow), and two PLD-related domains visualized by a white and a grey box (TCPD-1 and TCPD-2, respectively). In scenario b, differential splicing of the tcpp-1 gene results in a precursor polypeptide with the same signal peptide and PLD-1
domain, but a different second pacifastin-like inhibitor domain (TCPD-3). In both precursors, the two domains are separated
by putative dibasic cleavage sites (grey small bars). Full processing of both PP variants results in single-domain inhibitor peptides. (B) According to scenario a, all 7 PLD-related peptide encoding sequences of the aapp-1 gene are transcribed. In scenario b on the other hand, an additional splicing occurs in the third exon, resulting in the removal of the fourth PLD-related
domain (grey box). In both precursors, all domains except PLD-1 and PLD-2 are separated by putative dibasic cleavage sites
(grey small bars). Upon processing this results in the cleavage into one double-headed inhibitor peptide (PLD-1 and PLD-2) and
6 or 5 single inhibitor domain peptides.
contain a PLD-like signature. For the nvpp-3, nvpp-6 and
nvpp-8 genes no EST sequence data are available.
FGENESH analysis of the nvpp-8 genomic sequence [GenBank: XM_001601664], however, suggests that the exon
3–4 junction was not correctly predicted. Instead of one
gene composed of 5 exons encoding a PP with a signal
peptide and four PLDs, it is more likely that the last exon
is part of an additional PP gene. More EST sequence data
and/or cDNA cloning are needed to clarify this hypothesis.

to arthropods and in particular to insects and crustacean
species [5-8,12,13]. However, this study is the first to
report the occurrence of pacifastin members in two other
phyla, including the Placozoa. In the animal kingdom,
the Bilateria (containing phyla such as Arthropoda, Chordata, Annelida and Mollusca) are the most 'evolved'
clades. Whole-genome phylogenetic analyses suggest that
Placozoa, that contain only one species, T. adhaerens, represent a sister group to all other Eumetazoa (Cnidaria and
Bilateria) and form a separate clade [43].

These data indicate that recent gene and/or exon duplication events in combination with the occurrence of splice
variants underlie the considerable differences in the
number of PP/PLD between different insect species, varying from a single PP with only one PLD in A. pisum to 8
PPs with more than 20 PLDs in N. vitripennis.

The 'primitive' placozoan species, T. adhaerens, is a small,
flat and disc-shaped (1–2 mm) animal having only four
morphologically different somatic cell types, excluding
nerves and sensory or muscle cells [44]. Surprisingly,
genome analysis has shown that the relatively small
genome of this 'primitive' animal encodes the basic
machinery (e.g. with a rich repertoire of transcription factors and signaling pathways) required for complex developmental processes and neural/muscle differentiation
that is typically associated with Bilateria [43]. Based on
these observations, on mitochondrial sequencing analysis

Based on the phylogenetic position of Placozoa, the PP
endocing gene found in Trichoplax can be considered as
the closest relative of the ancestral pacifastin gene, suggesting that the pacifastin genes of bilaterian species
evolved by in-frame exon-fusion. However, since pacifastin genes have only been found in two related bilaterian
phyla, this hypothesis would imply that during bilaterian
divergence the pacifastin gene was 'lost' in the evolutionary lineages leading to Deuterostomia and to most phyla
belonging to the Lophothrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. Therefore, a second hypothesis, which suggests that the pacifastin signature may have arisen twice by convergent
evolution, appears equally plausible. According to this
scenario, one pacifastin gene has emerged rather early in
animal evolution and evolved to the currently known pacifastin gene in Trichoplax. Independently, the 'ancestor' of
the pacifastin genes in Panarthropoda may have emerged
within the ecdysozoan clade after the divergence from
Nematoda and before the split between Arthropoda and
Onychophora.

and on particular morphological characteristics of T.
adhaerens, it is very likely that Placozoa appeared rather
late in metazoan evolution and are more closely related to
Bilateria than previously expected based on their primitive morphology [43,45-50].
No pacifastin-related sequences were found in Deuterostomia, nor in Annelida and Mollusca, the best characterized lophotrochozoan phyla (Figure 4). Unfortunately,
very few sequence data are available of the remaining
lophotrochozoan phyla and, therefore, it is not clear
whether pacifastin-like genes are entirely absent in Lophotrochozoa. In addition, no significant hits were found in
the ecdysozoan phyla, Tardigrada and Nematoda, despite
the large amount of available sequence data from the latter phylum. However, the occurrence of pacifastin related
genes in Tardigrada cannot be excluded, since sequence
information is scarce in this phylum. Bilaterian pacifastinlike genes have been found in Panarthropoda, more specifically in the sister phyla, Arthropoda and Onychophora.

Pacifastin-like peptides in Arthropoda
The phylum of Arthropoda contains the highest number
of animal species on Earth, with more than one million
species described. To investigate the distribution and evolution of the pacifastin-related genes in this monophyletic
group, we searched for new pacifastin members in the
four subphyla: Chelicerata (horseshoe crabs, spiders and
pycnogonids), Myriapoda (centipedes, millipedes, etc.),
Hexapoda (insects and springtails) and Crustacea
(shrimps, crabs, etc.). In the two sister groups, Chelicerata
and Myriapoda, no pacifastin-like genes were found (Figure 4). However, the presence of pacifastin members in
these subphyla can not be fully excluded, since the
amount of available sequence data is still limited. On the
other hand, precursor peptides with the 'pacifastin signature' were discovered in the two remaining subphyla,
Crustacea and Hexapoda (Figure 4).

Based on the presence of pacifastin-like genes in both
Arthropoda and Onychophora, the common ancestor of
the Panarthropoda most likely possessed a pacifastin-like
gene. Consequently, the Chelicerata and Myriapoda may
have 'lost' this gene after their divergence from the other
Arthropoda, estimated less than 600 million years ago.
This observation is in line with both phylogenomic data
(ribosomal sequences, mt genome, hox genes, EST
sequences) and morphological characteristics (similarity
in a neurogenesis developmental mechanism), suggesting
that Myriapoda and Chelicerata constitute a separate
clade (the Paradoxopoda) from the Hexapoda and Crustacea clade (the Pancrustacea) [31,51-54].

sequences according to the NCBI taxonomy platform were taken into account. The (sub) phyla, in which pacifastin-related
members were predicted, are highlighted. A question mark is used when the origin of the (sub) phylum is uncertain.
Pacifastin-related peptides in Crustacea
More than twenty years ago, the crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, was the first crustacean in which a pacifastin
member was identified [2,3]. Contrary to the subsequent
identification of many PPs in insects, only two crustacean
PPs had been reported. Several genome projects of economically important shrimp, lobster and crab species currently generate a growing amount of sequence data,
showing that pacifastin members are more widely spread
in this phylum (Figure 5). In the class of Maxillopoda, a
zooplankton species (C. finmarchicus) expresses a pacifastin-like precursor peptide [see Additional file 2]. Nevertheless, no pacifastin-like sequences have been found in
the related order of Siphonostomatoida, despite the large
amount of available EST sequences. In the large class of
Malacostraca, pacifastin-like sequences were found in several species of Peracarida and Decapoda, two orders for
which a significant amount of nucleotide sequences are
available. Most of these species are commercially important, such as the Common freshwater shrimp (Gammarus
pulex), the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vanmei) and
the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Remarkably,
pacifastin-like sequences appear to be absent in the class

of Branchiopoda. The more than 200,000 ESTs and the
fully sequenced genome of Daphnia pulex do not contain
any pacifastin-like transcripts or genes, suggesting that the
pacifastin gene was 'lost' in the Daphnia lineage, and,
maybe, in the entire class. Noteworthy is the uncertain
phylogenetic relationship of this class to other pancrustaceans. Recent phylogenetic studies suggested that some
crustacean lineages, namely Malacostraca and Branchiopoda, are sister groups to Hexapoda, with the exclusion of
other crustaceans, and that insects frequently emerge as a
nested clade within Crustacea, which may constitute a
paraphyletic group [55-59].
Pacifastin-related peptides in Hexapoda
The subphylum of Hexapoda is currently subdivided in
three important classes, the Ellipura or springtails (Collembola), the Diplura or two-pronged bristletails and the
Insecta (Figure 5). The presence of pacifastin genes in
insects has been proven in several previous studies, but for
the first time a pacifastin member was found in the springtails and more precisely in Folsomia candida. This springtail
of the family Isotomidae is blind, unpigmented and parthenogenetic as some insect species, such as aphids, some

bees and parasitic wasps. On the contrary, no sequences
encoding the pacifastin-like signature were found in
Diplura. This apparent absence may be due to the lack of
available sequence data for this class (less than 1000
nucleotide sequences). On the other hand, pacifastin family members were found in the majority of insect orders;
from heterometabolous (hemimetabolous) orthopteran,
blattarian and isopteran species to holometabolous
hymenopteran, lepidopteran, dipteran and siphonapteran species. In these orders, members of the pacifastin family occur in nearly all branches, while their absence
in the remaining insect orders may be accounted for by
the low amount of available nucleotide sequences (Figure
5). In Hemiptera, PPs are found in all three important
clades, i.e. the clade of the true bugs (Heteroptera), the
cicadas (Auchenorrhyncha) and the aphids (Sternorhyncha). Also in Lepidoptera, PPs were identified in both butterflies and moths and in all other superfamilies of the
Neolepidoptera. There is one remarkable exception in the

order of Diptera or 'true flies'. Contrary to the Suborder of
the Nematocera that contains many species expressing
PPs (mosquitoes, sand flies and other bloodsucking flies),
no pacifastin-related members have been identified in the
suborder of the Brachycera (Figure 5). This large suborder
contains a huge variety of highly specialized dipteran species. However, the available sequence data are mainly
restricted to the family of Drosophilidae and a few other
species such as the horn fly (Haemotobia irritans) and the
Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata). Whether the
pacifastin gene is 'lost' in the entire suborder of the Brachycera, as it seems the case for the family of Drosophilidae,
can therefore not yet be confirmed.
Another noteworthy observation is the variation in the
number of pacifastin genes in Hymenoptera. Only one
PP-encoding gene is present in the genome of the honey
bee, Apis melifera, while at least eight PPs were found in an
endoparasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. Based on the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:97

function of pacifastin as a regulator of the innate immune
system in the crayfish [26], it seems rational to assume
that some pacifastin-related inhibitors might play a similar role in insect immunity. The expression of multiple
pacifastin PPs, and their processing into several pacifastinlike inhibitors, suggests that at least some pacifastinrelated PI may have additional functions. In the case of N.
vitripennis, pacifastin gene duplications and adaptive evolution might be correlated with a functional diversification of (some) pacifastin-like PIs as repressors of host
immune systems. In analogy, a pacifastin-related inhibitor was identified in the venom of a closely related
endoparositoid wasp (Pimpla hypochondriaca) and this
venom includes different compounds that are known to
interfere with the immune system of the host organism
[60,61].

Conclusion
This paper is the first to report on a large scale in silico
study of the pacifastin family. The primary structures of all
identified PPs and PLDs were analyzed, as well as the
organization of pacifastin genes. In addition, sequences
were manually corrected, splice variants were determined
and gene structures were verified, whenever possible,
using EST sequences and/or conventional cloning techniques. By this combined approach pacifastin members
were identified in 55 species, divided over three distinct
animal phyla. Within Arthropoda, PPs were identified in
Insecta, Ellipura and Crustacea, suggesting a wide distribution of members of the pacifastin family in these
branches of the phylum. An additional PP showing high
sequence similarity with some arthropod PPs was identified in Onychophora. Surprisingly, an exceptionally large
PP was predicted in the genome of the placozoan, T.
adhaerens. Genome analysis and comparison of the amino
acid sequences suggested that the Trichoplax gene may
constitute an ancestral gene to the pacifastin family members present in arthropods and onychophorans. However,
it can not be excluded that the pacifastin signature may
have originated twice during metazoan evolution.
Detailed analysis of the domain and gene organization of
different insect PPs, indicated that gene duplication, exon
duplication (PLD-like domain duplication) and alternative splicing of the corresponding transcripts have
occurred during insect evolution. Together with a high
variability of the residues of the reactive site, the different
core types and the presence of putative cleavage sites
between PLDs, these evolutionary events seem to be
linked with adaptive functional diversification of this
family, in response to differences in the ecological niches
of the insects.
For many species, none or very few sequence data are
available. However, ongoing genome and EST projects are
expected to generate additional sequence data and to lead

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/97

to an even more detailed view on the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of the pacifastin gene family in
Metazoa.
