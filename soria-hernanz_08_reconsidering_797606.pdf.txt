Abstract
Background: Differences in plant annual/perennial habit are hypothesized to cause a generation time effect on
divergence rates. Previous studies that compared rates of divergence for internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and
ITS2) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) in angiosperms have reached contradictory conclusions
about whether differences in generation times (or other life history features) are associated with divergence rate
heterogeneity. We compared annual/perennial ITS divergence rates using published sequence data, employing
sampling criteria to control for possible artifacts that might obscure any actual rate variation caused by annual/
perennial differences.
Results: Relative rate tests employing ITS sequences from 16 phylogenetically-independent annual/perennial
species pairs rejected rate homogeneity in only a few comparisons, with annuals more frequently exhibiting faster
substitution rates. Treating branch length differences categorically (annual faster or perennial faster regardless of
magnitude) with a sign test often indicated an excess of annuals with faster substitution rates. Annuals showed an
approximately 1.6-fold rate acceleration in nucleotide substitution models for ITS. Relative rates of three nuclear
loci and two chloroplast regions for the annual Arabidopsis thaliana compared with two closely related Arabidopsis
perennials indicated that divergence was faster for the annual. In contrast, A. thaliana ITS divergence rates were
sometimes faster and sometimes slower than the perennial. In simulations, divergence rate differences of at least
3.5-fold were required to reject rate constancy in > 80 % of replicates using a nucleotide substitution model
observed for the combination of ITS1 and ITS2. Simulations also showed that categorical treatment of branch
length differences detected rate heterogeneity > 80% of the time with a 1.5-fold or greater rate difference.
Conclusion: Although rate homogeneity was not rejected in many comparisons, in cases of significant rate
heterogeneity annuals frequently exhibited faster substitution rates. Our results suggest that annual taxa may
exhibit a less than 2-fold rate acceleration at ITS. Since the rate difference is small and ITS lacks statistical power
to reject rate homogeneity, further studies with greater power will be required to adequately test the hypothesis
that annual and perennial plants have heterogeneous substitution rates. Arabidopsis sequence data suggest that
relative rate tests based on multiple loci may be able to distinguish a weak acceleration in annual plants. The failure
to detect rate heterogeneity with ITS in past studies may be largely a product of low statistical power.

Background
Comparative studies of molecular substitution rates
between lineages provide insights into the mechanisms
that cause evolution of DNA sequences. Under the neutral
theory [1,2] rates of nucleotide substitutions are expected
to be equal to rates of mutation, thus a constant rate of
nucleotide substitution in homologous DNA sequences
should be observed among lineages that share mutation
rates. Neutral theory assumes that genetic drift is the primary evolutionary mechanism causing molecular evolution and predicts that rates of sequence change would be
both constant over time and independent of the effective
population size. Heterogeneity in substitution rates can
be explained under neutral theory by either unevenness of
mutation rates at individual loci (manifested as locus
effects) or correlated mutation rates across all loci within
species (manifested as lineage effects). Alternatively, natural selection may cause rate heterogeneity among loci and
lineages via purifying selection that reduces the probability of substitution due to functional constraint or through
the increased probability of substitution associated with
positive natural selection [3-6]. Identifying causes of rate
heterogeneity as well as specific variables that affect
underlying mutation and substitution rates is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms that cause evolution
of DNA sequences (reviewed in [7]).
Differences in generation time could affect substitution
rates, causing lineage effects on substitution rates if organisms with shorter generation times experience more mutations per unit of chronological time than organisms with
longer generation times. This neutral explanation for rate
heterogeneity among lineages is commonly called the
generation time hypothesis. Under the generation time
hypothesis, lineage-specific heterogeneity in rates of
divergence can be explained by differences in the number
of germ line cell divisions per unit time among lineages
that otherwise share constant mutation rates. Therefore,
under the generation time hypothesis substitution rates
are expected to be negatively correlated with generation
time [5,8,9]. Generation time effects on synonymous substitution rates have been widely observed at multiple loci
for several mammalian species [2,3,9-15]. Generationtime-like effects have also been tested for in organism
such as RNA viruses where faster substitution rates were
correlated with higher frequencies of replication [16] and
in spore-forming bacteria where rates of divergence were
not related to spore dormancy [17].
In angiosperms, expected generation time impacts on
rates of molecular evolution are not as clear as in animals
since plants lack distinct germ and somatic cell lines. Plant
cells are totipotent and the number of cell divisions
between germination and gamete production can vary
from individual to individual and even among parts of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/344

single individual. The generation time hypothesis modified for plants assumes that variation in the frequency of
cell replication is correlated with differences in annual/
perennial habit. Since annuals have shorter minimum
time to first flowering than perennials, it has been
assumed that annuals would also experience a higher frequency of cell replication per chronological time and
thereby a faster rate of divergence when compared to perennials [18]. The generation time hypothesis has been
invoked to explain why annual species exhibited higher
rates of molecular evolution than perennial species for
several nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast loci (e.g.
[19-23]). However, results from studies that support a
generation time effect in plants have two primary limitations [24]. First, some studies used multiple non-independent comparisons in their analyses that may lead to
statistical difficulties as well as potential phylogenetic
bias. Second, the taxa compared were highly divergent so
that other evolved differences in addition to generation
time could also have caused the rate variation observed.
Comparing divergence rates in phylogenetically-independent sets of annual/perennial pairs that are recently
diverged can correct for these two pitfalls when testing for
a generation time effect in angiosperms [24].
Loci that can be used to estimate divergence rates are limited in the vast majority of angiosperms, which restricts
comparisons of substitution rates in multiple independent sets of recently diverged plant taxa. For example, the
plant mitochondrial genome exhibits a fast pace of structural evolution but the lowest rate of nucleotide substitutions of all three plant genomes making it especially
difficult to obtain sequences in multiple plant lineages
with sufficient divergence [18,25-28]. Universal primers
are available for multiple chloroplast regions but, like
mitochondrial regions, the utility of these regions is often
limited by low sequence divergence at shallow phylogenetic relatedness. Nuclear loci are not widely available in
multiple plant lineages since nuclear genomes have variable architecture, abundant multigene families with rapid
duplication and loss complicating the identification of
orthologous loci [18,27]. There is also a wide range of
substitution rates among nuclear DNA sequences in
plants [29], requiring multiple loci in comparative studies
to average rates over independent loci.
The internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of
nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) are the only nuclear
DNA markers currently available for comparative tests of
the generation time hypothesis in a broad range of
recently diverged plant taxa for several reasons. First, ITS
regions are universally amplifiable in plants and many
plant taxa have been sequenced. Second, ITS regions are
highly variable at the nucleotide level. Third, it is commonly believed that ITS multicopy arrays are homoge-

nized by concerted evolution so that intraspecific
polymorphism does not complicate estimates of divergence [30,31]. Moreover, ITS regions have been used
extensively in molecular evolution studies of plants such
as demonstrating that rates of ITS nucleotide substitution
are associated with species diversity [32], reproductive isolation and life history [33], and environmental variables
([33]; but see [34]).
Two recent studies compared rates of ITS1 and ITS2 divergence using phylogenetically independent sets of
angiosperms differing in life history but reached opposite
conclusions about whether differences in life history
affect rates of divergence. In the first study, Whittle and
Johnston [24] did not find an association between relative
rates of nucleotide substitution and annual/perennial life
history in 22 species pairs, leading them to conclude that
the generation time hypothesis does not apply to
angiosperms. In another recent study, clades with a predominantly herbaceous life history exhibited an almost
twice-faster average rate of divergence than predominantly long-lived woody clades using 28 independently
calibrated absolute rates of ITS nucleotide substitution
[35]. Both studies consistently did not reject the null
hypothesis of constant divergence rates when comparing
life histories. Since low statistical power of rate tests was
suspected, both papers also treated substitution rate differences qualitatively or categorically (e.g. annual is faster
or perennial is faster regardless of the magnitude of the
rate difference). These conflicting results mandate further
research into whether differences in generation times are
correlated with substitution rates in angiosperms.
Given that ITS1 and ITS2 are currently among the only
sequences available to test for rate heterogeneity among a
wide sampling of plant taxa, it is essential to assess the statistical power of rate heterogeneity tests based on ITS
sequences. It is critical to determine the magnitude of rate
heterogeneity required to reliably reject the null hypothesis of rate constancy when evaluating whether differences
in annual/perennial habit have heterogeneous substitution rates. Low statistical power will result in type II errors
(incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis of rate
constancy) that could lead to an erroneous conclusion
that annual/perennial habit is not associated with divergence rates. One main cause of low statistical power is a
small number of nucleotide substitutions available to estimate divergence, a common situation when recently
diverged species are being compared. Simulations have
shown that the power of Tajima's relative rate test [36],
distance-based relative rate tests [9], and the maximumlikelihood relative ratio test [6] are all dependent on
sequence lengths, the relatedness of the outgroup taxa,
and the employment of an appropriate model of nucleotide substitution [37,38]. The alternative approach of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/344

categorical treatment of substitution rate differences in
annual/perennial comparisons is based on the assumption that the direction of rate differences would accurately
test rate heterogeneity. However, this approach has not yet
been subjected to a rigorous power analysis.
In this article, we test whether annual/perennial habit
affects rates of divergence by comparing both relative rates
of molecular evolution and categorical branch length differences in 16 independent annual/perennial species
pairs. ITS1 and ITS2 sequences were obtained from GenBank under strict sampling criteria designed to control for
artifacts contributing additional variation in divergence
rates that could obscure any rate variation caused by differences in life history. The criteria were that each annual/
perennial pair was recently diverged, had at least eight
nucleotide changes between taxa, had ITS sequences for
two outgroup taxa available, and the ITS sequences were
originally obtained from a single PCR amplicon. The
power of maximum likelihood relative rate tests was
investigated by determining the degree of rate heterogeneity required to reliably reject rate constancy for DNA
sequences simulated under average nucleotide substitution parameters of ITS sequences. We also used simulations to assess whether categorical treatment of branch
length differences is an appropriate method to test for rate
heterogeneity when a relative rate test does not reject rate
constancy. In addition, we utilized sequences of three
nuclear loci, two chloroplast regions and multiple intraspecific nrDNA ribotypes for the annual Arabidopsis thaliana and two closely related perennials (Arabidopsis lyrata
subsp. lyrata and A. lyrata subsp. petrea) to test whether
substitution rate differences at the ITS regions were correlated across multiple loci as expected under the generation
time hypothesis.

Results
ITS annual/perennial substitution rates
The edited sequences had between 210â267 sites for ITS1,
between 183â257 sites for ITS2 and between 420â505
sites for the combined ITS region. Results from the maximum-likelihood relative rate test and the categorical treatment of branch length differences, as well as the estimated
rate differences in 16 independent annual/perennial comparisons for the ITS1, ITS2 and combined ITS data using
two outgroup taxa, are summarized in Table 1. The maximum-likelihood relative rate test rejected the null hypothesis of rate constancy in 12 out of 48 comparisons with
less divergent outgroups and in 13 out of 48 comparisons
with more divergent outgroups. In most tests where the
null was rejected, annual species exhibited faster rates of
nucleotide substitution than perennial species (10 annuals versus 2 perennials with less divergent outgroups and
8 annuals versus 5 perennials with more divergent outgroups). Similar results for relative rate tests were

obtained with Tajima's 1D relative rate test (results not
shown). After treating branch length differences categorically, a sign test showed a significant excess of faster substitution rates in annual taxa for all ITS sequence regions
with both more and less diverged outgroups with the
exception of ITS1 using more diverged outgroups (Table
1). In summary, the results indicated rate homogeneity
for many comparisons but annuals more frequently
exhibited significantly faster rates of nucleotide substitution when there was significant rate heterogeneity.
Using two outgroup taxa with different levels of divergence in each annual/perennial comparison showed that
substitution rates varied slightly but did not change the
general conclusion that annuals exhibited faster rates of
substitution than perennials. For ITS1 using less divergent
outgroups, relative rate tests rejected rate constancy in
three of 16 comparisons, indicating that three annual species exhibited a significantly faster rate of substitution. In
the same way, annual taxa exhibited longer branch
lengths in 12 of the 16 categorical comparisons (sign test,
p = 0.038). When the same annual/perennial species pairs
where compared using more divergent outgroups, two
annuals and one perennial showed significantly faster
rates by relative rate tests while 11 of 16 qualitative comparisons (sign test, p = 0.105) exhibited longer branch
lengths for annual taxa. For the ITS2 data, four cases
(three annuals and one perennial) rejected rate constancy
when less divergent outgroups were employed and in 13
of 16 qualitative comparisons (sign test, p = 0.011) annuals showed longer branch lengths. If more divergent out-

groups were used, five cases (three annuals and two
perennials) rejected rate constancy and 12 of 16 qualitative comparisons (sign test, p = 0.038) exhibited longer
branch lengths for annual taxa. For the combined ITS
sequence data with less diverged outgroups, four annuals
and one perennial species exhibited significantly faster
substitution rates by relative rate tests and 13 of 16 qualitative comparisons (sign test, p = 0.011) exhibited longer
branch lengths for the annual taxa. If more divergent outgroups were used with combined ITS sequence data, three
annuals and two perennials rejected rate constancy and 12
of 16 qualitative comparisons (sign test, p = 0.038) exhibited longer branch lengths for annual taxa.
Power simulations
The phylogeny used in the simulations is shown in Figure
1 and the nucleotide substitution parameter sets implemented in simulations are given in Table 2. The Kimura 2
parameter nucleotide substitution model (K80 or K2P),
which assumes equal base frequencies and variable transition and transversion frequencies [39], was the one most
frequently estimated for each of the 16 annual/perennial
species pair comparisons for all six ITS sequence datasets
(results not shown, substitution models available from
the authors). Overall, the simulations indicated that a
maximum likelihood relative rate test had an increasing
chance to detect rate heterogeneity for ITS-like sequences
as the rate difference between ingroup taxa increased (Figure 2). Relative rate tests rejected the null hypothesis in no
more than 80% of replicate simulations for a given set or
parameters for both ITS1-like and ITS2-like sequences,

used (see solid lines in Figure 2A, B, D and 2E). With a 3fold or less rate difference between ingroup taxa, ITS1-like
and ITS2-like simulated sequences rejected rate constancy
for no more than 50% of replicates. For combined ITS-like
sequences, the power of the test increased and rate constancy was rejected in about 80% of replicates with a 3.5fold or greater rate difference between ingroup taxa (see

The proportion of replicates where the faster evolving

Categorical rate comparisons identified the annual-like

The proportion of replicates with significant rate heterogeneity for each of the ITS-like sequences was similar

(see Table 2) are shown in Figure 3. Estimated rate differences within a nucleotide substitution parameter exhibited high variation and extremely long tails for all six
nucleotide substitution parameter sets. The mean and
coefficient of variation were not appropriate to summarize the distributions because of non-normality (20 or so
very extreme values at each tail lead to a large difference
between the mean and mode). Medians and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of estimated substitution rate differences for replicate simulations were: median = 1.74, CI =
-2.2 â 14.6 for ITS1-like sequences; median = 1.52, CI = -

2.9 â 10.1 for ITS2-like sequences; median = 1.77, CI = 1.4 â 5.8 for combined-ITS-like sequences with a less
diverged outgroup. Using a more diverged outgroup, replicate simulations exhibited rate difference distributions
of median = 1.56, CI = -3.2 â 25.1 for ITS1-like sequences;
median = 1.17, CI = -4.9 â 8.4 for ITS2-like sequences;
median = 1.42, CI = -2.1 â 4.2 for combined-ITS-like
sequences. The median value of the estimated rate differences was nearly identical in each case to the rate difference parameter in Table 2 and 95% CIs of estimated rate
differences overlapped extensively.
Arabidopsis annual/perennial substitution rates
Results of relative rate tests, estimates of substitution rates
and estimated substitution rate differences between the
annual A. thaliana and the perennials A. lyrata and A.
petraea for various nrDNA ribotypes, the three nuclear loci
and two chloroplast regions are summarized in Table 3.
Rate constancy was rejected in a single instance, where the
chloroplast region had a significantly faster substitution
rate for the annual A. thaliana. Qualitatively, substitution
rate differences estimated at each of the three nuclear loci
were similar and uniformly indicated a faster rate for the
annual species. The average substitution rate difference for
all nuclear loci was 1.35-fold between A. thaliana and A.
lyrata and 1.32-fold between A. thaliana and A. petraea.

When the three nuclear loci were concatenated into a single sequence, a Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution
model with a gamma parameter was obtained (results not
shown). When the entire concatenated nuclear sequence
was used in the likelihood relative rate test, A. thaliana
showed significantly faster divergence rates when compared to both A. lyrata (p = 0.017) and A. petraea (p =

used to simulate DNA sequences (Seq-Gen) continues to add nucleotide changes until threshold divergence values have been
reached. These threshold divergence values were obtained by averaging the estimated sets of branch lengths from actual ITS
sequences for 16 annual/perennial/outgroup comparisons (Table 1). These averaged values are given in Phylip format in Table
2. The threshold divergence values for the perennial-like taxon (DIA-perennial) and the outgroup-like taxon (DR-outgroup, DR-IA)
were kept constant for each outgroup (closer and further) and each set of nucleotide substitution parameters (ITS1-like, ITS2like and Combined-ITS-like). To model rate heterogeneity, the threshold divergence value of the annual-like taxon (DIA-annual)
for each set of replicate simulations was determined by multiplying the perennial-like taxon divergence threshold (DIA-perennial)
by1.5 to 5 in steps of 0.5.

sequences, the average substitution rate difference was
1.35-fold between A. thaliana and A. lyrata and 1.33-fold
between A. thaliana and A. petraea.
When the two chloroplast regions were concatenated into
a single sequence, a Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano nucleotide
substitution model best fit the data (results not shown).
In contrast with the results from the concatenated nuclear
sequences, relative rate tests did not reject the null
hypothesis of rate constancy for the concatenated chloroplast sequences between A. thaliana and both A. lyrata (p
= 0.093) and A. petraea (p = 0.092; results not shown).
Categorical analyses for the concatenated chloroplast
sequences indicated a faster divergence rate for A. thaliana
when compared to A. lyrata (1.7-fold difference) and A.
petraea (1.8-fold difference).
No relative rate tests rejected rate constancy for any comparison of Arabidopsis ITS sequences. For all ITS sequences

in Arabidopsis, categorical treatment of substitution rates
as well as estimated rate differences between annual and
perennial taxa showed a roughly equal number of cases
where the annual and the perennial exhibited a faster substitution rate. Sometimes the taxon with the faster rate for
ITS1 had the slower rate for ITS2, such as when A. petraea
(R1 ribotype) had a qualitatively higher substitution rate
at ITS1 but qualitatively lower substitution rate at ITS2. In
another case, using the alternative ribotype R2 for A.
petraea both ITS1 and ITS2 exhibited qualitatively higher
substitution rates in the annual taxon. When additional
outgroups and nrDNA ribotypes were used in the annual/
perennial/outgroup comparisons for ITS (data not
shown), both A. thaliana and the perennial taxa had qualitatively faster substitution rates with about equal frequency. The alternating pattern of either the annual or
perennial taxon exhibiting a faster estimated substitution
rate for ITS sequences was in contrast to the consistent
pattern of faster estimated substitution rates for the

Discussion
Overall, the null hypothesis of rate constancy for ITS
sequences was not rejected in the majority of annual/perennial comparisons based on both maximum-likelihood
and Tajima's 1D relative rate tests. When rate constancy
was rejected, annuals exhibited higher rates of nucleotide
substitution in most cases. Categorical treatment of
branch length differences indicated that an excess number

of annual species had higher rates of nucleotide substitution. Because these two patterns are expected under the
generation time hypothesis for plants, these results support the hypothesis that differences in the annual/perennial habit are associated with rates of molecular evolution
in angiosperms.
The simulations reported in this paper supply several
insights. First, the simulations showed how often relative
rate tests based on ITS-like sequences reject the null
hypothesis of rate constancy when rates are in fact une-

tively low power to reject rate constancy seemed possible.
Indeed, the simulations showed that the statistical power
to detect rate heterogeneity using ITS sequences is generally low for rate differences less than 3-fold. For simulations based on ITS1-like and ITS2-like nucleotide
substitution parameter sets, the relative rate test only
achieved an 80% probability of rejecting rate homogeneity with 4.5 or 5-fold rate differences. These power analyses for ITS-like sequences agree with a more general
previous study that demonstrated a high type II error for
Tajima's 1D test when the DNA sequences compared are
short and have few diverged sites [38]. The simulations
further suggest that categorical treatment of branch length
differences is a more powerful indicator of rate heterogeneity at low to moderate substitution rate differences
compared to relative rate tests, at least for ITS-like
sequences. However, conclusions about the statistical
power of the categorical rate comparisons only apply to
the average nucleotide substitution model and divergence
parameters used in the simulations and may not be a general phenomenon.
The best-documented case of a generation time effect is
the 2- to 3-fold faster substitution rate in rodents compared to hominids [12,7]. This well studied example provides some perspective on the magnitude of rate
differences we might expect to observe in plants if a generation time effect actually operates. In plants, the magnitude of rate differences between annual and perennial
taxa was 2-fold at synonymous sites in the mitochondrial

coxI gene [40], 4-fold at both synonymous and non-synonymous sites in the chloroplast rbcL gene [20,21,27],
and 2.5-fold at synonymous sites in nuclear Adh loci [20]
(Eyre-Walker and Gaut 1997). All of these studies were
limited to comparisons of highly divergent annual and
perennial species and therefore confounding factors other
than differences in generation time might have lead to an
overestimation of the impact of annual/perennial habit
on substitution rates. In a study focused on phylogenetically independent comparisons, Kay and collaborators
[35] found that clades with a predominantly herbaceous
life history exhibited divergence rates for ITS sequences
almost two times faster than clades with a predominantly
long-lived woody life history in 28 phylogenies representing 21 different angiosperm families. The overall substitution rate differences estimated for the annual/perennial
species comparisons in this paper were of similar magnitude to the ITS rate differences observed by Kay et al. [35].
Here, annuals evolved on average 1.6 times faster rate
than perennials when a less divergent outgroup was used,
while a slightly lower 1.4-fold average acceleration of
annuals was observed with more divergent outgroup taxa.
Categorical comparisons for ITS sequences also indicated
that faster rates of substitution were correlated with
annual habit. Therefore, the ITS results in this paper support a weak substitution rate acceleration for annuals consistent with a generation time effect in plants. We also
believe that our sampling methods controlled for rate heterogeneity caused by variables other than annual/perennial habit and helped to better detect a weak generation

time effect. This explains in part why our results are distinct from those of Whittle and Johnston [24], even
though both studies were based on some of the same ITS
data and used similar relative rate tests.
The Arabidopsis sequence data also support a weak annual
acceleration in substitution rates. The annual A. thaliana
had a significantly faster substitution rate for the chloroplast rbcL locus when compared with A. petraea. In addition, categorical rate comparisons consistently showed a
faster substitution rates for A. thaliana for all the nuclear
loci and chloroplast regions, even though rate constancy
was not rejected by relative rate tests. When the three
nuclear loci were combined, A. thaliana had a significantly
faster substitution rate than either perennial. The only
exception to the pattern of faster divergence rates for A.
thaliana were at ITS sequences. The lack of any relative rate
tests rejecting rate homogeneity and about half of qualitative comparisons indicating annuals were faster, all suggest that the ITS sequences showed no evidence of a faster
substitution rate for A. thaliana. However, the simulation
results showed that ITS-like sequences have little power to
reject rate constancy when substitution rates are less than
2-fold different. So the pattern of about half of the qualitative rate comparisons showing a faster substitution rate
for annuals is consistent with random variation about a
mean rate difference of zero. Interestingly, similar results
indicating a consistently higher number of synonymous
substitutions (but rate constancy was not rejected by
Tajima's relative rate test) in A. thaliana than in A. lyrata
were observed in five out of six loci using the closely
related outgroup species Capsella rubella and Arabidopsis
graba [41].
Recent divergence of annual/perennial taxa is an advantage when attempting to infer the possible causes of rate
heterogeneity because it reduces the number of evolutionary changes that distinguish the taxa in addition to
annual/perennial habit. Unfortunately, that advantage
may come at the cost of statistical power to detect potential rate heterogeneity. Recent divergence also means that
few substitutions have occurred in the two taxa being
compared so that the number of nucleotide changes will
be small. The Arabidopsis data further suggest that statistical power to compare annual/perennial substitution rates
is limiting. The individual Arabidopsis nuclear loci did not
show significant rate heterogeneity. However, the larger
sample of changes in the three loci combined showed the
approximately 1.4-fold rate difference between annual
and perennial was significantly faster for the annual. Since
we did not distinguish among synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the Arabidopsis sequences, the significant
rate difference is an average across all types of nucleotide
sites and reflects the net substitution rate of neutral sites
and any sites influenced by positive or negative selection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/344

In addition to the low power of ITS sequences to test relative rate hypotheses, ITS sequences may have other limitations that further hamper their ability to detect rate
heterogeneity. There is the possibility that the ITS1 and
ITS2 sequences might be subject to different selective pressures [42] resulting in region-specific rates of ITS substitution when natural selection is stronger than genetic drift.
The ITS sequence data in this paper indicated a pattern of
annual taxa exhibiting faster substitution rates that was
consistent between both ITS1 and ITS2 regions. Such a
pattern is not expected if ITS1 and ITS2 regions experience
locus-specific selection pressures. In addition, it has been
hypothesized that incomplete concerted evolution could
independently affect rates of molecular evolution at either
ITS1 or ITS2 [30]. Reports of multiple nrDNA haplotypes
within individuals are becoming increasingly common
[e.g. [43-51]] suggesting that complete concerted evolution should not always be assumed for ITS sequences. The
different intraspecific nrDNA ribotypes used in the Arabidopsis annual/perennial comparisons did in fact change
the perception of substitution rates between ITS1 and
ITS2 regions. Either ITS1 or ITS2 was observed to have the
faster substitution rate for annuals depending on the
nrDNA ribotypes used in the Arabidopsis annual/perennial
comparison. Thus, the Arabidopsis ITS data suggest that
estimates of substitution rates may depend on the nrDNA
ribotype employed in comparisons. If selection pressures
or polymorphism dynamics have a greater impact on estimates of substitution rates than does a weak generation
time effect, any acceleration in the substitution rate of
annuals will be difficult to detect with ITS.
The underlying biological mechanisms that might cause
an acceleration of substitution rates in annuals are still
unclear [18,35], although life history features that influence the number of rounds of DNA replication per unit of
calendar time are capable of altering the relative substitution rate when mutation rates are constant. Identifying the
underlying cause or causes of rate heterogeneity is difficult
because variables such as the combined effects of organism size and temperature on metabolic rate [52,53], the
influx of environmental energy that may lead to mutation
[54], and mating system [55] are potentially confounded
with differences in generation time. Annual or perennial
habit may itself have a variable relationship to the generation time pertinent to substitution rates. For example,
many perennials are able to flower in their first year like
annuals while other perennial species may require many
years until first flower. The total range of possible generation times in plants is very large since some woody perennials may live for thousands of years. The species in this
study all fall at the short generation time end of this range
since they are either annuals or short-lived perennials.
Therefore, the suggestion of a weak annual/perennial substitution rate difference in our study may not apply if

Page 11 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:344

plant groups containing perennials with longer lives and
greater time to first flower were compared.

Conclusion
ITS substitution rates in 16 phylogenetically-independent
comparisons of annual and perennial taxa and from the
combination of nuclear loci and chloroplast genome
regions in annual and perennial Arabidopsis suggest a
modest rate acceleration of less than 2-fold in annuals.
These results support an association between rates of
nucleotide substitution and annual/perennial habit in
plants as expected under the generation time hypothesis.
Separately, simulations showed that relative rate tests
employing ITS-like sequences are not expected to be powerful enough to reject rate homogeneity when substitution rate differences are small. Given that the power of ITS
sequences to test for generation time effects is very low,
the conclusion by Whittle and Johnston [24] that no
annual/perennial effect on substitution rates exits seems
unwarranted. The small substitution rate differences
observed here and in other studies points out that testing
the generation time hypothesis among closely related
plant species will require multiple loci to achieve sufficient power, as was the case in the now classic examples of
animal generation time effects. While their availability in
many plant taxa facilitates phylogenetically-independent
comparisons, ITS sequences by themselves are not likely
to be a powerful tool to test hypotheses involving substitution rate heterogeneity. Further studies with greater statistical power have to be carried out before drawing a
definitive conclusion about patterns of relative substitution rate heterogeneity in annual and perennial plants
and its possible causes.

tandemly repeated arrays. Each nrDNA copy is organized
into less constrained ITS1 and ITS2 regions separated by
the 163â164 base pair 5.8S region, which is highly conserved when functional copies are compared within genera or between recently diverged genera [42,56]. A
rigorous method to detect pseudogenes is to compare estimated divergence at conserved sequence regions with estimated divergence at unconstrained sequence regions [57].
Thus, we compared nucleotide divergence for 5.8S, ITS1
and ITS2 regions for each set of nrDNA sequences from
the annual/perennial/outgroup comparison. We excluded
from further analyses nrDNA sequences that exhibited
either 1) a high divergence at the 5.8S region relative to
the others 5.8S regions, or 2) divergence of the 5.8S region
that was approximately equal to divergence at the ITS1
and ITS2 regions within a species, because these are patterns consistent with a lack of 5.8S functional constraint.
This is a conservative sampling approach to prevent inadvertently combining functional and non-functional
nrDNA copies in comparisons of annual and perennial
taxa that could hamper our ability to detect possible associations between divergence rates and life history. The criterion of using nrDNA sequences from the same PCR
amplicon was restrictive in that it caused us to exclude
numerous possible ITS sequences available in GenBank.
The second criterion was that pairs of annual/perennial
taxa sampled had nrDNA sequences from two outgroup
taxa that were relatively closely related within the same
family. This permitted examination of the impact of outgroup divergence on relative rate comparisons between
annual and perennial taxa and prevented our relative rate
estimates and hypothesis tests from being contingent on
the peculiarities of a single outgroup.

Methods
DNA sequences
Partial nrDNA sequences from 64 different species representing 13 angiosperm plant families were retrieved from
GenBank (Table 4). Because rate heterogeneity at nrDNA
sequences may have multiple causes, we established three
criteria designed to control for artifacts possibly contributing to rate heterogeneity that may obscure any rate variation caused by differences in annual/perennial life
history.

The first criterion was that only ITS1 and ITS2 sequences
obtained from the same PCR amplicon were sampled to
distinguish between functional and non-functional copies. A functional copy is expected to be under strong selective constraints limiting its substitution rate while a nonfunctional copy (pseudogene) is expected to exhibit a
higher rate of nucleotide substitution when compared to
a functionally constrained copy. Nuclear ribosomal DNA
regions are usually located in chromosomal regions
within nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) in the form of

The third criterion was that each of the ITS1 and ITS2
sequences were required to have at least eight nucleotide
changes between annual and perennial species. Complete
ITS sequences (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) were approximately
600 base pairs long on average so that eight nucleotide
changes in 600 base pairs is equal to 1.3% divergence.
Since the power of relative rate tests depends on the
number of substitutions, this criterion prevented sampling of sequences likely to have little statistical power to
reject the null hypothesis of rate homogeneity.
The annual Arabidopsis thaliana and the perennials A. lyrata subsp. lyrata (A. lyrata) and A. lyrata subsp. petraea (A.
petraea) met the three sampling criteria for nrDNA and
also offered three additional nuclear loci (Chs, Adh and
PgiC) and the rbcL and matK chloroplast regions (see
accession numbers in Table 5). The Arabidopsis taxa also
offer intra-specific variation in nrDNA ribotypes and consequently polymorphic ITS1 and ITS2 sequences that per-

nrDNA sequences were obtained from the same PCR product but sequenced independently so there are two GenBank entries [66].

mitted us to test whether relative rate comparisons were
influenced by nrDNA polymorphism.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were aligned into contigs for each comparison
of an annual, perennial and an outgroup taxon and edited
using Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Mich.).
Gapped positions were pruned from alignments before
analyses. Modeltest 3.5 [58] was used to determine the
most likely nucleotide substitution model and the associated parameters for each triplet annual/perennial/outgroup sequence comparison. Branch lengths for each
annual/perennial comparison were determined for ITS1,
ITS2 and for the combination of both ITS1 and ITS2
regions (the combined ITS region) using PAUP* v.4.0b10
[59] and HyPhy [60] under the parameters of the substitution model determined in Modeltest. To express differences in nucleotide substitution rates between annual/
perennial pairs, the substitution rate of the taxon exhibiting longer branch length was divided by the substitution
rate of the taxon with the shorter branch length. In addition, the generation time hypothesis has been tested via
categorizing branch length differences (e.g. annual faster

than perennial or perennial faster than annual) even
when rate homogeneity is not rejected by a relative rate
test [24]. Thus, annual/perennial branch length differences were also summarized by a categorical variable to
indicate whether the annual or perennial species exhibited the higher rate of substitution. Following Whittle and
Johnston [24], we performed sign tests of the null hypothesis that annuals and perennials exhibited a longer branch
length with equal frequency. In contrast to Whittle and
Johnston [24], we employed one-tailed versions of the test
because under the alternative hypothesis of rate heterogeneity annuals are expected to have a faster substitution
rate than perennials.
Relative rate tests
To test for differences in substitution rates among taxa,
both maximum-likelihood [61] and Tajima's 1D [36] relative rates tests were applied to the ITS sequences for each
independent annual/perennial species pair. The relative
rate test compares the number of nucleotide substitutions
that occurred in one of the ingroup species to the number
of substitutions that occurred in the other ingroup species
utilizing the outgroup to identify those substitutions that

can be unambiguously assigned to one of the ingroup taxa
[62,63]. Under the null hypothesis of equal substitution
rates in each lineage, the number of nucleotide changes is
expected to be equal for the two taxa. The maximum-likelihood relative rate test is considered one of the most powerful and flexible tests for rate heterogeneity, but it
requires knowledge of the nucleotide substitution pattern,
any substitution rate variation among sites in addition to
the phylogenetic relationship among sequences [27]. The
maximum-likelihood relative rate tests were implemented
in HyPhy [60] and used the nucleotide substitution models from Modeltest.
An alternative relative rate test which does not require an
explicit nucleotide substitution model is Tajima's 1D test
[36]. Although Tajima's 1D test cannot correct for saturation, apparent divergences are not expected to be gross
under-estimates of true divergences for recently diverged
taxa. The null hypothesis of rate constancy can be tested
with Tajima's 1D using a chi-square with one degree of
freedom as implemented in the T1Dand2D v4OS program [64]. Because sites with gaps or ambiguous base calls
can be considered as an additional change by the Tajima's
1D program, they were excluded from the analyses.
Computer simulations
We investigated the power of maximum likelihood relative rate tests for each of the ITS1, ITS2 and combined ITS
regions by computer simulation by utilizing empirically
estimated sequence substitution parameters. Simulation
parameters were based on nucleotoide substitution
parameters estimated from ITS sequences and were
divided into two groups based on divergence of the outgroup within each annual/perennial pair (Table 2). Transition/transversion
ratio,
sequence
length
and
substitution rate difference between annuals and perennials were averaged over all independent annual/perennial
pairs. Because the nucleotide substitution models for
annual/perennial/outgroup triplets were somewhat variable (see Results), the most frequently obtained nucleotide
substitution model was employed in the simulations.

The combination of SG Runner (T. Wilcox;
homepage.mac.com/tpwilcox/) and Seq-Gen [65] were
used to model each of the ITS regions. Seq-Gen simulates
nucleotide substitution within lineages until a given
threshold of divergence between the ingroup taxa has
been reached. This threshold divergence value was
obtained by averaging the estimated divergences (or
branch lengths) from all annual/perennial/outgroup triplets (see Figure 1). Each ITS-like data consisted of 1000
DNA sequence triplets simulated with one of the ingroup
taxon having a substitution rate between 1.5 and 5 times
faster than the other ingroup taxon. The threshold branch
length values of the taxon with the slower substitution

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/344

rate parameter sets (also denoted as the perennial-like
taxon) and the outgroup taxa were kept constant. The
threshold branch length value of the taxon with the faster
substitution rate parameter sets (also denoted as the
annual-like taxon) was simulated with a rate difference of
1.5 to 5 times increasing in steps of 0.5 times the threshold branch length value of the perennial-like taxon.
Each set of triplet sequences was analyzed in PAUP* to
calculate the relative branch lengths and the maximum
likelihood values of each constrained and unconstrained
tree. Then, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was carried out for
each of the 1000 replicates using an Excel spreadsheet and
used to calculate the proportion of replicates where the
null hypothesis of rate constancy was rejected. The percent
of cases where the LRT rejected rate constancy was divided
into instances where either the faster evolving annual-like
taxon or the slower evolving perennial-like taxon had the
longer estimated branch length. In addition, branch
length differences in each replicate simulation were categorized into qualitative outcomes of annual-like taxon
faster or perennial-like taxon faster, independent of
whether or not the relative rate test rejected rate constancy. This provided an estimate of the proportion of replicates where the categorical comparison of rates detected
rate heterogeneity. In order to evaluate the variation in
estimates of annual/perennial rate differences in
sequences most similar to actual ITS data, one set of 1000
replicate simulations were carried out using the nucleotide substitution model parameters and average rate differences estimated from the ITS sequences of the 16
annual/perennial pairs (see bottom rows of Table 2). The
distribution of the estimated rate differences between the
ingroup taxa in 1000 replicate triplet sequences was plotted in histograms for the six combinations of three ITS
nucleotide substitution models and more and less
diverged outgroups.
