From 15th International Conference on Human Retroviruses: HTLV and Related Viruses
Leuven and Gembloux, Belgium. 5-8 June 2011
Background
Among the four types of HTLV (1,to 4), only three have
their simian counterparts (STLV-1, 2 and 3). STLV-1
and 3 have been found in a large number of captive and
wild-living monkeys and great apes from Africa and
Asia. STLV-2 was reported only in a limited number of
captive bonobos (P. paniscus) from Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), but so far never documented in wildliving populations.
Material and methods
Between March and July 2010, fecal samples from wildliving bonobos were collected at Malebo forest in the
Bandundu province, western DRC. We confirmed the
species by mitochondrial (mt) DNA analyses and we
screened all samples for STLV infection using a generic
PCR allowing amplification of partial fragment in tax
(220bp) as well as targeting different fragments in the
LTR.
Results
We collected a total of 268 bonobos fecal samples.
Overall, 3 (1.1%) samples amplified the tax fragment.
Among these, one (Pp5538) was identified as STLV-2
and two (Pp5489 and Pp5560) as STLV-3 by phylogenetic analysis. Additional analysis on the LTR fragment
showed that the new STLV-2 from Pp5538 clustered
with STLV-2 strains previously described in captive
bonobos. All PCR attempts to amplify the LTR fragment
of Pp5489 and 5560 samples were unsuccessfull.

Conclusion
Our study shows that faecal samples can be used to
screen for STLV infection in endangered apes, although
most likely with lower sensitivities. We confirmed
STLV-2 infection in wild-living bonobos and showed
that bonobos are also infected with STLV-3.
