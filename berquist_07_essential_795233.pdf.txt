Abstract
Background: Information transfer systems in Archaea, including many components of the DNA
replication machinery, are similar to those found in eukaryotes. Functional assignments of archaeal
DNA replication genes have been primarily based upon sequence homology and biochemical
studies of replisome components, but few genetic studies have been conducted thus far. We have
developed a tractable genetic system for knockout analysis of genes in the model halophilic
archaeon, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and used it to determine which DNA replication genes are
essential.
Results: Using a directed in-frame gene knockout method in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we
examined nineteen genes predicted to be involved in DNA replication. Preliminary bioinformatic
analysis of the large haloarchaeal Orc/Cdc6 family, related to eukaryotic Orc1 and Cdc6, showed
five distinct clades of Orc/Cdc6 proteins conserved in all sequenced haloarchaea. Of ten orc/cdc6
genes in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, only two were found to be essential, orc10, on the large
chromosome, and orc2, on the minichromosome, pNRC200. Of the three replicative-type DNA
polymerase genes, two were essential: the chromosomally encoded B family, polB1, and the
chromosomally encoded euryarchaeal-specific D family, polD1/D2 (formerly called polA1/polA2 in
the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome sequence). The pNRC200-encoded B family polymerase,
polB2, was non-essential. Accessory genes for DNA replication initiation and elongation factors,
including the putative replicative helicase, mcm, the eukaryotic-type DNA primase, pri1/pri2, the
DNA polymerase sliding clamp, pcn, and the flap endonuclease, rad2, were all essential. Targeted
genes were classified as non-essential if knockouts were obtained and essential based on statistical
analysis and/or by demonstrating the inability to isolate chromosomal knockouts except in the
presence of a complementing plasmid copy of the gene.
Conclusion: The results showed that ten out of nineteen eukaryotic-type DNA replication genes
are essential for Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, consistent with their requirement for DNA replication.
The essential genes code for two of ten Orc/Cdc6 proteins, two out of three DNA polymerases,
the MCM helicase, two DNA primase subunits, the DNA polymerase sliding clamp, and the flap
endonuclease.

Background
Archaeal microorganisms, though prokaryotic, are phylogenetically distinct from bacteria [1] and exhibit considerable similarities to eukaryotes in their macromolecular
biosynthetic machinery, particularly with respect to their
DNA replication system. Among the Archaea, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 provides an excellent model system to
address questions of fundamental DNA replication biology using bioinformatic, genomic, and genetic
approaches [2]. The genome is relatively small, comprised
of a 2 Mbp large chromosome and two minichromosomes, pNRC200 (365 kbp) and pNRC100 (191 kbp),
and codes 2,682 putative genes. Of these, only 2,532
genes are unique, due to duplication of 145,428 bp
between the two extrachromosomal replicons [3]. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is easily cultured in the laboratory in
hypersaline media containing 4.3 M NaCl and has welldeveloped genetic methodology, including a facile transformation system, plasmid shuttle vectors, selectable
markers, and a directed gene knockout/replacement system [4,5].
For gene knockouts in the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 system, we developed a method employing the selectable
and counterselectable ura3 gene (Fig. 1) [6,7]. The system
also utilizes a suicide plasmid vector with two essential
elements, a wild-type copy of the Halobacterium sp. NRC1 ura3 gene plus its native promoter, and at least 500 bp
of 5' and 3' DNA flanking the targeted gene. Transformation of an isogenic Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 strain containing a deletion of the chromosomal ura3 gene with the
suicide vector, followed by selection for uracil prototrophy results in an integrated copy of the suicide vector at
the genomic locus homologous to the targeted gene.
Counterselection for suicide vector loss is accomplished
by selection for 5-fluoroorotic acid (Foa) resistance and
colonies are then screened via polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to discriminate between knockout and wild-type
alleles. Excision of the suicide plasmid vector can occur on
the same side as the integration, yielding restoration of
the wild-type allele, or excision can occur on the opposite
side of the integration, yielding replacement of the wildtype gene with a deletion of the targeted gene. In cases of
essential genes, a functional copy of the targeted gene
must be provided on a replicating plasmid to recover
deletants. This gene knockout system has been successfully employed for studies of several gene clusters in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [2,5].
In addition to the gene knockout system, a genetic screen
for the isolation of autonomously replicating sequences
(ARS) was established for Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Earlier genetic work identified two likely replication origins
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 via cloning of ARS elements,
one on the large chromosome, and another located

A. Gene knockout strategy in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. In
this approach, a targeted gene allele, shown here as a deletion, is first cloned into the suicide plasmid, pBB400, which is
capable of replication in E. coli (but not in Halobacterium). The
plasmid also contains the native ura3 gene under the control
of its own promoter. The resulting plasmid is introduced into
a Halobacterium sp. NRC-1∆ura3 host via transformation.
Integrants are then selected by uracil prototrophy (Ura+)
using commercially available uracil-dropout media components (HURA+ media). Subsequently, plasmid excisants are
selected via counterselection of ura3, 5-Foa-resistance (Foar).
This gives rise to derivatives containing either the original or
mutant allele, which may be distinguishable by PCR or phenotypic analysis. B. A method for construction of chromosomal knockouts of essential genes. A complementation
strategy is shown where an autonomously replicating plasmid
vector which contains a functional gene of interest, geneX, is
introduced into the host strain, e.g. by selection for mevinolin resistance (Mevr). Strains containing a knockout of the
chromosomal copy may then be selected using the method
described in part a, with the additional selection for the complementing plasmid with Mevr.

within the common region of pNRC100 and pNRC200
[8,9]. Sequence analysis of the pNRC minimal replicon
showed the requirement of a unique gene, repH, and an
AT rich region 5' to the gene. Mutation or deletion of
either the AT rich sequence or the repH gene was found to
abolish autonomous replication ability of plasmids [9].
For the large chromosome, the ARS element was found
directly 5' to orc7, one of ten orc/cdc6 genes in the genome,
in a region of GC skew polarity switch [10] and global
minimum in Z curve analyses [11]. However, regions
proximal to two other chromosomal orc/cdc6 genes, orc6
and orc8, could not confer autonomous replication ability. The chromosomal ARS region contained unusual
sequence elements: a large (33 bp) inverted repeat flanking an AT rich region of 189 bp plus the orc7 gene. Genetic
analysis showed that both the inverted repeats, the AT rich
region, as well as the orc7 gene were required for autonomous replication ability [8]. Work in other archaeal
organisms identified chromosomal DNA replication origin(s) comprised of similar sequence elements proximal
to orc7 homologs in the genomes of Pyrococcus abyssi [1214] and Sulfolobus spp. [15,16].
In addition to genetic studies, predicted replisome components of haloarchaea have been identified via bioinformatic analysis [17]. One of the most interesting findings
was the presence of a large family of orc/cdc6 genes in
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and other haloarchaea, homologous to eukaryotic origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins 1, 4, and 5 as well as to the eukaryotic replicative
helicase loader Cdc6 (Fig. 2) [8,18]. This finding suggested that multiple Orc proteins in Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 may be required for replication, perhaps through
formation of heteromeric protein complexes for origin
recognition. Many additional genes coding eukaryotictype DNA replisome components have also been found,
with homology to replicative helicase proteins (MCM),
ssDNA binding proteins (RFA), processivity clamp loader
proteins (RFC), processivity clamp protein (PCNA), primase proteins, Okazaki fragment maturation proteins
(Rad2 and RNaseH), ATP dependant DNA ligase, DNA
polymerases (B family), and type IIB topoisomerase
(Top6A and B). The novel heterodimeric family D DNA
polymerase found only in the euryarchaea is also present
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [19]. A few genes for bacterialtype replication proteins, e.g. a primase (DnaG), and type
IA (TopA) and IIA DNA topoisomerases (GyrA and B), are
also present [17].
With the availability of an inventory of replication factors
likely acting at haloarchaeal DNA replication origins and
a facile gene knockout system, we sought to answer basic
questions regarding the essentiality of DNA replication
gene assignments in an archaeon. The inability to recover
deletion mutants indicates the requirement of genes cod-

ing two Orc/Cdc6 proteins, two different replicative DNA
polymerases, a replicative helicase, a eukaryotic-type primase, a DNA polymerase sliding clamp, and the flap
endonuclease. Eight of the orc/cdc6 genes and a polB gene
are dispensable to cells. This study shows the first in vivo
evidence for genes likely to be critical for DNA replication
in Archaea.

Results
Bioinformatic analysis of Orc/Cdc6
Halophiles are unique among the Archaea in possessing a
large gene family of Orc/Cdc6 genes, as other archaeal
organisms most commonly encode only two Orc/Cdc6
homologs [8]. In Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, ten orc/cdc6
genes are present, with orc6, orc7, orc8, and orc10 genes
located on the large chromosome, orc1-5 located on
pNRC200, and orc9 located on both the pNRC100 and
pNRC200 replicons. The gene products are quite diverse,
ranging from 21–91% similarity (data not shown), with
Orc2 and Orc4 being the most similar overall and Orc8

and Orc10 being the most similar encoded chromosomally. The haloalkaliphilic archaeon, Natronomonas
pharaonis, encodes the fewest number of orc/cdc6 genes
among haloarchaea (five), while Haloarcula marismortui
encodes the most (seventeen). Phylogenetic reconstruction of Orc/Cdc6 protein sequences from sequenced
haloarchaeal genomes and representative eukaryotes indicated the presence of five distinct haloarchaeal/archaeal
clades, all distantly related to eukaryotic Orc1 and Cdc6
(Fig. 2). The general archaeal clades, Orc6 and Orc7, have
just single members from each haloarchaeon, while all
other haloarchaeal-specific clades have multiple members
from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and H. marismortui, and a
single member from N. pharaonis (Fig. 2).
Knockout of orc/cdc6 Genes
One of our primary goals was to determine how many
and which of the orc/cdc6 genes in the Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 genome are essential (Table 1). Using a directed
gene knockout approach all ten orc genes were individually targeted for in-frame deletion. To this end, we constructed suicide plasmids containing at least 500 bp of 5'
and 3' flanking DNA sequences of all ten orc genes
(designed to leave only 5–13 codons after deletion, see
Table 1) and introduced them into a ∆ura3 derivative of
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Excision of the integrated suicide plasmid may occur on the same side as integration
(yielding restoration of the wild-type allele), or on the
opposite side as the integration (yielding replacement of
the wild-type gene with the deletion allele). In theory, for
a nonessential gene, either event should be recovered with
the same frequency, yielding 50% wild-type restoration
and 50% deletion allele replacement (Fig. 1A). In contrast, for essential genes, loss of the wild-type gene allele
would results in loss of viability, so only the wild-type
recombinant would be recovered.

Based upon the requirement of orc7 for minichromosome
plasmid replicon autonomous replication and orc6 conservation in the genome sequences of other Archaea [8],
we expected that these two orc genes would likely be
essential for normal growth. Surprisingly, we found that
neither orc7 nor orc6 were essential, nor were orc3, orc4,
orc5, orc8, or orc9 (Fig. 3A and 3B), since knockouts were
readily obtained for those genes (Table 2). [Interestingly,
during the process of screening for orc1 knockout strains
it was observed that a natural event in the host strain
deleted orc1, indicating non-essentiality for orc1 (data not
shown).] In all these cases, between 15 and 30 % of Foar
isolates of integrants were knockouts. In contrast, however, we did not find any deletions of two orc genes, orc10,
located on the large chromosome, and orc2, present on
pNRC200, indicating that these genes are essential, which
is consistent with their involvement in DNA replication.
Orc10 belongs to a clade of uniquely haloarchaeal Orc

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/31

proteins along with Orc8, eight other Orc/Cdc6 members
from the distantly related archaeon H. marismortui, and a
single member from N. pharaonis (Fig. 2). Orc2 also
belongs to part of a larger haloarchaeal clade of Orc/Cdc6
homologs that includes Orc3, Orc4, Orc5, four additional
members from H. marismortui, and one member from N.
pharaonis (Fig. 2).
Two replicative-type DNA polymerases are essential in
euryarchaea
All euryarchaeal genomes encode DNA polymerases
belonging to two different families (B and D) [20]. In
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, four DNA polymerase genes
were targeted for individual deletion: polD1 and polD2,
the chromosomally encoded small and large subunits of
the heterodimeric euryarchaeal specific D family DNA
polymerase, and polB1 and polB2, two genes encoding separate B family DNA polymerases, one on the large chromosome and one on pNRC200. In each case, suicide
plasmids containing ~500 bp 5' and 3' to the genes
(including 3–6 codons; Table 1) were constructed and
integrants were selected by uracil prototrophy. After isolation and screening of 40 Foar colonies via PCR, we found
that deletion alleles could not be recovered for either gene
of the D family DNA polymerase, polD1 and polD2, or for
the gene encoding the chromosomally encoded B family
polymerase, polB1, indicating that they are essential to this
organism (Fig. 4A and Table 2). In contrast, deletions of
the second B family DNA polymerase gene, polB2,
encoded on pNRC200, were readily obtained (25 % of
Foar colonies), indicating that this gene is dispensable to
the cell (Fig. 4A).
Archaeal mcm is an essential gene
MCM is an essential complex for DNA replication in
eukaryotes and is the likely replicative DNA helicase. To
investigate whether mcm is required in Archaea, we targeted the single mcm gene in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 for
deletion. A suicide plasmid containing ~500 bp flanking
the mcm gene (including 6 codons; Table 1) was constructed and integrants were selected by uracil prototrophy. Screening of 40 Foar colonies via PCR, resulted in no
recovery of deletants of the mcm gene (Fig. 5A and Table
2), even though Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 possesses genes
for over a dozen other predicted DNA/RNA helicases [17],
displaying that this gene is essential.
Genes of the eukaryotic-type DNA dependent RNA
primase are essential in Archaea
In order to address whether the eukaryotic-type primase
was essential, directed in-frame deletions of Halobacterium
sp. NRC-1 pri1 and pri2 genes were attempted. Once
again, suicide plasmids containing ~500 bp 5' and 3' to
the genes were constructed (including 8 or 4 codons,
respectively, Table 1) and integrants were selected by

uracil prototrophy. After isolation and screening 40 Foar
colonies of each integrant, we observed no deletants for
either pri1 or pri2 providing in vivo data supporting the
requirement of eukaryotic-type primases in Archaea (Fig.
5A, Table 2).
Archaeal PCNA is essential
The gene for PCNA is known to be essential in eukaryotes,
so we wanted to determine whether pcn is essential in
Archaea as well. Utilizing the ura3 based targeted gene
knockout system in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, a suicide
plasmid containing ~500 bp 5' and 3' to the pcn gene,
including an in-frame deletion with 8 codons (Table 1),
was constructed and integrants were selected by uracil
prototrophy. After isolation and screening 40 Foar colonies, we were unable to observe any deletants of pcn, indicating that this gene is indeed essential (Fig. 5A, Table 2).
The Rad2 family flap endonuclease is essential in Archaea
In order to determine whether the Halobacterium sp. NRC1 rad2 gene likely coding for the putative flap endonuclease was essential, the gene was targeted for deletion via
our ura3 based knockout system. A suicide plasmid vector
which contained ~500 bp 5' and 3' to the rad2 gene,
including an in-frame deletion containing 5 codons was
constructed (Table 1). After isolation and screening 40
Foar colonies, we were unable to recover any deletants of
rad2 (Fig. 6A), indicating that this gene is essential.

Statistical analysis of DNA replication gene knockouts
In our knockout experiments, we observed the average frequency for wild-type restoration to be ~75% and the frequency for deletion allele replacement to be ~25% for
non-essential genes regardless of the genomic locus
[6,7,21-23]. To determine the confidence with which we
could conclude the essentiality of genes for which we did
not obtain knockouts, we tested for rejection of the null
hypothesis. For a typical case, where H0=geneX is nonessential, and the probability of identifying the wild type
allele, PWT, is 0.75, by screening 40 Foar colonies, the
probability of finding 100% wild-type restoration is calculated to be 10-5, if the gene is non-essential. In other
words, there is a 1 in 100,000 chance that a gene knockout
would not be obtained if the gene was non-essential, providing a confidence level of greater than 99.999 % probability of identifying a knockout of a non-essential gene
when screening through 40 individual Foar colonies.
Therefore, very strong evidence is provided to reject the
null hypothesis that the gene is non-essential, indicating
that the target gene is indeed essential.

All target genes where no deletion was obtained were
tested for rejection of the null hypothesis. A minimum of
40 and a maximum of 80 colonies were screened in each
case. For the orc2, mcm, polD1, polD2, polB1, pri1, pri2, pcn,
and rad2 genes, 40 Foar colonies were screened without
recovering a single knockout, indicating that the probability of these genes being essential is > 99.999 % (i.e. less

than a 1 in 100,000 chance that these genes are non-essential). For orc10, 80 Foar colonies were screened without

99.9999999 % of this gene being essential (i.e. less than a
1 in 10,000,000,000 chance that this gene is non-essential) (Table 2).
Complementation and knockout analysis of essential DNA
replication genes
To further validate the strong statistical evidence supporting the essential nature of some DNA replication genes,
we performed knockout analysis in the presence of a complementing gene for a select subset of the essential genes.
This complementation analysis involved placing a wildtype copy of the gene of interest, plus its native promoter,
on a plasmid capable of replication and the selectable
mevinolin-resistance (Mevr) gene in Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1. This replicating plasmid vector was then transformed into the respective Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ∆ura3
strain containing the gene deletion plasmid which had
been stably integrated into the specific targeted gene
locus. Excisants of the gene deletion vector were selected
using Foar while the replicating plasmids were maintained
with mevinolin selection (Fig. 1B). Individual colony isolates were screened for the presence of wild-type or deletion alleles of the chromosomal copy of the gene of
interest, in the same manner that the aforementioned
non-essential gene knockout strains were screened (Figs
4B, 5B, 6B and Table 2).

orc3, orc4, orc5, and orc9, knockout alleles where obtained are
~2000 bp in size, while wild-type alleles are approximately 800,
300, 1200, 1400, and 1000 bp larger, respectively. B. Chromosomal orc genes. Primers residing ~500 bp 5' and ~500 bp 3' to
each chromosomally encoded orc gene (orc6, orc7, orc8, orc10) in
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 were used with total genomic DNA
from individual colony isolates in PCR reactions to screen for orc
gene knockouts. For orc6, orc7, orc8, and orc10, knockout alleles
have a size of ~1000 bp where obtained, wild-type alleles are
approximately 1100, 1500, 1200, and 1400 bp larger, respectively.

Replicating plasmids containing a functional, polD1
(pBBpolD1all), polB1 (pBBpolB1all), mcm (pBBmcmall),
pri2 (pBBpri2all), or rad2 (pBBrad2all) gene plus the
native promoter were introduced into a Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 ∆ura3 strain containing the corresponding deletion plasmid, respectively, integrated into the chromosome. After selection for excisants using Foar and Mevr
selection, candidate clones were screened for wild-type or
deletion alleles of either polD1, polB1 (Fig 4B), mcm, pri2
(Fig 5B) or rad2 (Fig 6B) genes using PCR with primers
external to the genes. Since the plasmid borne genes contained only ~100 bp of 3'-flanking region and the 3'-end
primers mapped > 500 bp downstream, the PCR assay was
specific for the chromosomal genes. Our results showed
that one or more chromosomal deletants were obtained
for polD1, polB1, mcm, pri2, and rad2 genes (Figs 4B, 5B,
6B, and Table 2) only when a complementing wild-type
copy was provided on a replicating plasmid. These results
confirm the requirement of the five genes for cell viability
using both statistical and genetic criteria. Attempts to cure
selected replicating plasmid vectors in strains containing a
chromosomal gene deletion by growing in media lacking
mevinolin selection for many generations and screening
for presence of the mevinolin resistance marker displayed
that these vectors were stably maintained in the absence of

Discussion
Analysis of DNA replication components in archaeal systems has been restricted primarily to bioinformatic analysis and in vitro biochemical characterization. However, in
our investigations, we have utilized the power of genetics
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, to study DNA replication in
this model Archaeon. Previously, we defined the cis acting
elements required for chromosomal and pNRC100/200
DNA replication [8,9]. In the current study, we have examined the in vivo essentiality of nineteen genes for predicted
components of DNA replication initiation and elongation. Ten genes are most likely required, encoding two
Orc/Cdc6 origin recognition proteins, two DNA polymerases (one B and both subunits of the D family), four accessory proteins, the replicative helicase protein MCM,
primase proteins Pri1/Pri2, processivity clamp protein
PCNA, and Okazaki fragment maturation protein Rad2.
Taken together, our results provide a better view of the
likely in vivo requirements for DNA replication in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.
Significantly, our study has targeted the largest number of
genes for deletions in any archaeon to date [6,7,21-33].
For the first time, we have used statistical analysis of gene
knockout frequencies and in several cases complementation analysis to critically evaluate the essentiality of genes
for which deletions could not be recovered. Statistical
analysis showed that the probability of recovering knock-

out mutants is > 99.999 % in all cases where 40 potential
candidates were screened. Where no mutants were
observed (orc2, orc10, polD1, polD2, polB1, mcm, pri1, pri2,
pcn, and rad2), we have very strong evidence for the
requirement of these genes for cell viability. In five cases
tested by complementation analysis (polD1, polB1, mcm,
pri2, and rad2), knockouts were recovered when a functional copy of the gene was present on a replicating plasmid, confirming that the genes were essential to cells and
also dominant in trans. These results provide a genetic system for further analysis of essential DNA replication genes
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.
Interestingly, we found that only two of ten orc genes
encoded in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 are essential. We had
previously hypothesized that orc7 and likely orc6 would
be essential for viability, based upon our previous genetic
work showing the requirement of orc7 for autonomous
replication ability of a minichromosome plasmid replicon [8]. Biochemical work performed on an Orc7
ortholog in S. solfataricus [15] and a chromatin immunoprecipitation study in Pyrococcus abyssi [13] are also consistent with the function of Orc7 proteins in
chromosomal origin binding proteins in Archaea. However, we found the orc7 gene of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1
to be dispensable under standard growth conditions.
Because NRC-1 contains ten orc/cdc6 homologs, it is possible that another gene may be functionally redundant to
orc7 in this archaeon. In contrast, Orc7 orthologs are
found in a single gene copy in most other Archaea, with
the exception of Sulfolobus spp. which have two orc7

orthologs linked to two chromosomal DNA replication
origins [15,16].
Most Archaea encode an orc6 gene ortholog in their
genomes [8], but our genetic analysis shows this gene is
also not essential to Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Sulfolobus
spp. Orc6 proteins have been found to bind origin DNA
sequences, although in partially synchronized cultures,
expression of the Orc6 ortholog appears to be in G2 phase
cells [15]. It is possible that Orc6 orthologs act as negative
regulators of DNA replication initiation, preventing rereplication by binding to origin sequences and blocking
binding of replication initiation factors. Both the Orc7
and Orc6 orthologs from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus have also been shown to interact with MCM

and inhibit helicase activity, with the Orc6 ortholog being
a more potent inhibitor [34,35]. It is also possible that
Orc6 orthologs in Archaea act as Cdc6 does in eukaryotes,
recruiting the replicative helicase complex to DNA replication origins. In Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, the orc6 gene is
not essential for viability and no discernable phenotypes
are observed when it is deleted, possibly as a result of
functional redundancy.
Surprisingly, we found orc10 on the large chromosome,
and orc2 on pNRC200 are essential. Although these genes
are not found to be conserved in the genomes of non-

halophilic Archaea, there are likely orthologs and paralogs
found in all halophilic Archaea. Orc10 shares 50%
sequence similarity to the non-essential Orc8 protein
from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. It also shares sequence
similarity to Cdc6-3 from N. pharaonis and eight
homologs from H. marismortui, including a previously
unrecognized Orc/Cdc6 homolog on the pNG500 replicon (Fig. 2), and at least three homologs from Haloferax
volcanii (data not shown). Interestingly, the orc10 genetic
locus harbors an ISH12 element 100 bp from the orc10
predicted translational start codon and is also an area of
the large chromosome with extrachromosomal characteristics, e.g. an increased AT% and a higher concentration of
IS elements [10]. Orc2 is over 90 % identical in amino
acid sequence to Orc4 and shares sequence homology
with Orc5 and Orc3 from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and
forms a clade with Cdc6-5 from N. pharaonis, four
homologs from H. marismortui, and at least seven
homologs from H. volcanii (data not shown). At this time
we cannot strictly state that the orc10 and orc2 genes are
essential for DNA replication, only that they are essential
for viability of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, although their
homology to the other haloarchaeal, archaeal, and
eukaryotic orc/cdc6 genes would strongly indicate that
they are involved in some essential and thus far uniquely
haloarchaeal role in DNA replication (Fig. 2). It is tempting to speculate that these two orc gene products play an
important role in coordinating cell cycle and DNA replica-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/31

tion of the chromosome and extrachromosomal replicons
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. It is possible that they function as the origin binding proteins for the large chromosome and pNRC200, respectively, or they may be required
to recruit the replicative helicase, or additional replisome
components in haloarchaea. Moreover, our recent unpublished work has shown that the orc10 and orc2 genes are
essential in mutants harboring multiple orc gene knockouts, while also indicating that some orc gene products are
non-essential even in strains already having knockouts of
other orc genes.
All sequenced haloarchaea to date contain at least one
homolog in each of the five Orc/Cdc6 phylogenetic clades
(Fig. 2). The large haloarchaeal orc/cdc6 gene family may
therefore represent an evolutionary scenario, similar to
eukaryotes, in which gene duplication events followed by
functional divergence have led to evolution of heteromeric protein complexes for origin recognition. With discrimination of essential vs. non-essential orc genes, it will
be interesting to determine if heteromeric Orc/Cdc6 complexes form in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and to identify
specific functions and interactions of individual gene
products.
Our results also show that two replicative-type DNA
polymerases are absolutely required for Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1. Both of the chromosomally encoded DNA
polymerases, the B family polB1 polymerase, and the D
family polD1/polD2 polymerase, are essential. From in
vitro biochemical characteristics determined with the Pyrococcus B and D family DNA polymerases [36,37], it would
appear that the euryarchaeal specific heterodimeric D
family polymerase, PolD1/PolD2, may act at the lagging
strand and the B family polymerase, PolB1 may act at the
leading strand. The B family polymerase can only use
DNA primers for extension, while the D family polymerase can use either RNA or DNA primers for extension,
though it requires PCNA for efficient DNA synthesis [38].
However, these points are speculative and require more
direct genetic and biochemical experiments to confirm.
The non-essentiality of polB2 is also interesting. PolB2
contains the ten conserved polymerase and exonuclease
motifs of archaeal B family DNA polymerases (data not
shown), so it would appear to be a functional DNA
polymerase. A PolB2 homolog is also found in the
genome of the distantly related halophile, H. marismortui,
on extrachromosomal replicon pNG600. Of interest, as
well, is the fact that in both Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and
H. marismortui, the polB2 gene is divergently oriented with
respect to an Orc5 clade member gene [17]. The function
of this evolutionarily conserved genetic linkage between
polB2 and an Orc5 clade member gene in these two
haloarchaea is currently unknown, but in Halobacterium

sp. NRC-1 both orc4 and polB2 are non-essential genes.
While much in vitro work has been directed at determining the properties of archaeal DNA polymerases, especially since the discovery of a novel DNA polymerase
family in euryarchaea [19], no in vivo analysis had previously been performed to determine whether these DNA
polymerase family members were essential, consistent
with a requirement for DNA replication.
For the other five accessory genes examined here, whose
products comprise four protein complexes, the results
were as expected: mcm, pri1, pri2, pcn, and rad2 are essential for normal growth of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. The in
vitro biochemical work done on these various gene products had indicated that it was likely that they would function in an analogous manner to their eukaryotic
homologs. Though no biochemical work has been done
on the haloarchaeal MCM, our genetic analysis is consistent with its predicted function as a replicative helicase.
With Pri1/Pri2 (homologs of the eukaryotic p48 and p58
proteins), the archaeal complex likely acts as the DNAdependent RNA primase for DNA replication. The finding
of the essential nature of the pri1 and pri2 genes in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is consistent with their role as a replicative primase. In contrast, the function of the bacterialtype primase, DnaG, coded by most archaeal genomes,
including Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is unknown, although
in S. solfataricus it has been reported to be associated with
the archaeal exosome [39]. For PCNA, the function is
likely to be as a DNA polymerase sliding clamp. While
most Archaea possess a single gene for pcn, similar to
eukaryotes, two crenarchaea, S. solfataricus and Aeropyrum
pernix, are exceptions, with three pcn genes each, reminiscent of the eukaryotic 9-1-1 complex [40,41]. In Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we have found that the single pcn gene
is essential, consistent with PCNA acting as the homotrimeric DNA polymerase sliding clamp. Rad2 family flap
endonucleases are important in both the processes of
DNA replication, (during Okazaki fragment maturation),
and repair (in nucleotide excision repair). Organisms can
possess multiple homologs, although just a single flap
endonuclease gene was detected in the genome of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [17]. Genetic studies in yeast indicate
that rad27, the rad2/FEN1 homolog in S. cerevisiae, is not
essential unless a recombination gene (e.g. rad51 or exo1)
is also deleted [42]. In the present investigation, we have
shown that the rad2 gene is essential for viability of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. This finding is consistent with flap
endonucleases being required for DNA replication via
their role in Okazaki fragment maturation in this
archaeon.
The results obtained in this and a previous investigation
[8] are relevant to most other archaeal organisms, with the
large orc gene family representing a unique aspect of DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/31

replication in haloarchaea. In our emerging model,
archaeal chromosomal DNA replication origins are comprised of a large inverted repeat flanking an AT rich DNA
sequence proximal to the gene encoding an origin binding protein, an orc/cdc6 gene that is an orc7 ortholog.
These large inverted repeats likely serve as binding
sequences for the origin binding protein, probably Orc7,
although a multimeric ORC complex or other Orc proteins, especially the orc2 and orc10 gene products cannot
be ruled out. Binding of origin recognition protein(s)
would lead to local DNA helix destabilization of the intervening AT rich region allowing for recruitment of the
essential mcm gene-coded replicative helicase complex,
potentially by the orc6 gene product, followed by association of other replisome components, such as the essential
eukaryotic-type primase (pri1/pri2 gene products). Once
the primase lays down an RNA primer at the origin, the
essential pcn gene product may be loaded onto the primed
template and essential B (polB1) and D (polD1/polD2)
family replicative DNA polymerases. The rad2 gene product encodes the likely flap endonuclease which helps to
mature Okazaki fragments. During the replication process, the polB1 gene product coding the B family DNA
polymerase may act as the leading strand DNA polymerase and the polD1 and polD2 gene products coding the D
family DNA polymerase may act as the lagging strand
DNA polymerase for processive and faithful duplication
of the genome.
By utilizing a well developed in-frame gene knockout system in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we have established a
foundation on which to explore further the in vivo roles of
these DNA replication genes. With facile genetics, complete genome sequence, and established post-genomic
methodologies, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 provides an
excellent model system to further study the characteristics
of archaeal DNA replication. In addition, the gene knockout and complementation methodology used for studying DNA replication in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 may be
applied to the investigation of many other aspects of
archaeal biology [2].

Strains and culturing
Escherichia coli DH5α was grown in Luria-Bertani medium
supplemented with 100 µg of ampicillin/mL at 37°C.
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ∆ura3 was cultured in CM+
medium containing 4.3 M NaCl, trace metals, and 250 µg/
mL of 5-Foa at 42°C [4,5]. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ∆ura3
containing integrated suicide plasmids were grown in
HURA+ medium at 42°C [7].
Gene knockouts
To generate gene knockout suicide plasmid vectors,
regions surrounding the target gene were PCR amplified
from wild-type Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genomic DNA
(see Table 1 for pBB∆ plasmid series, oligonucleotide
sequences, and number of codons remaining after deletion). PCR products were then digested with appropriate
restriction enzymes and cloned into the multiple cloning
site (MCS) of plasmid pBB400, which contains a wildtype copy of the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ura3 gene plus
its native promoter [5]. Two independent suicide plasmid
vector isolates for each gene were then individually transformed into Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ∆ura3 via the PEGEDTA methodology [4]. Transformation cultures were
then plated onto HURA+ solid media and grown 7–10
days at 42°C. DNA from individual colony isolates was
then used as template in PCR reactions to verify suicide
plasmid integration into genomic DNA. Two isolates were
then plated onto CM+ solid media containing 250 µg/mL
of 5-Foa and grown at 42°C for 7 days. Colonies were
then picked from the CM+ solid media containing 250 µg/
mL of 5-Foa and grown at 42°C for 7 days in liquid CM+
media containing 250 µg/mL of 5-Foa. Genomic DNA
was extracted from these cultures and used as template in
PCR reactions to screen for knockout alleles using primers
which flanked the target gene.

P-value calculation
Taking the null hypothesis H0=geneX is non-essential with
the probability of identifying the wild type allele PWT =
0.75, the probability of identifying 40 out of 40 wild-type
alleles is P = 10-5, providing strong evidence to reject H0.
Sequence analysis
Protein sequences for Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were downloaded
from KOG1514 and KOG2227 at NCBI. Protein
sequences for Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Haloarcula
marismortui were generated locally. Sequences for Natronomonas pharaonis and Arabidopsis thaliana were downloaded
from NCBI. Protein sequences were aligned using
CLUSTAL_X1.83 and alignments manually inspected.
Quartet puzzling maximum likelihood phylogenic analysis was performed with TREEPUZZLE5.2 using the JTT
amino acid substitution matrix.

Complementation
To further address the question of essential genes we
developed a complementation strategy [5]. In this
method, a wild-type copy of the gene of interest plus its
native promoter was PCR amplified (see Table 1 for
pBBall plasmid series and primers sequences) and cloned
on a replicating plasmid vector, pNG168 [3,4], containing
a selectable marker (mevr) and then transformed into the
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1∆ura3 strain harboring an integrated copy of the original suicide vector. Subsequent
selection for suicide plasmid excision (Foar) and replicating plasmid maintenance (Mevr), by plating on CM+ solid
media containing 20 µg/mL of mevinolin and 250 µg/mL
of 5-Foa, results in selection of chromosomal knockouts,
even if the targeted gene is essential, due to complementation in trans by the plasmid borne wild-type allele of the
gene.
