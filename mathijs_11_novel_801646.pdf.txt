Abstract
Background: Noroviruses (NoVs) are an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. To gain
insight into the epidemiologic patterns of NoV outbreaks and to determine the genetic variation of NoVs strains
circulating in Belgium, stool samples originating from patients infected with NoVs in foodborne outbreak
investigations were analysed between December 2006 and December 2010.
Results: NoVs were found responsible of 11.8% of all suspected foodborne outbreaks reported in the last 4 years
and the number of NoV outbreaks reported increased along the years representing more than 30% of all
foodborne outbreaks in 2010. Genogroup II outbreaks largely predominated and represented more than 90% of all
outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with 63 NoV-positive samples for the partial polymerase (N = 45)
and/or capsid gene (N = 35) sequences. For 12 samples, sequences covering the ORF1-ORF2 junction were
obtained. A variety of genotypes was found among genogroups I and II; GII.4 was predominant followed in order
of importance by GII.2, GII.7, GII.13, GI.4 and GI.7. In the study period, GII.4 NoVs variants 2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2008
and 2010 were identified. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses identified different recombinant NoV strains that were
further characterised as intergenotype (GII.e/GII.4 2007, GII.e/GII.3 and GII.g/GII.1) and intersub-genotype (GII.4
2006b/GII.4 2007 and GII.4 2010/GII.4 2010b) recombinants.
Conclusions: NoVs circulating in the last 4 years in Belgium showed remarkable genetic diversity either by smallscale mutations or genetic recombination. In this period, GII.4 2006b was successfully displaced by the GII.4 2010
subtype, and previously reported epidemic GII.b recombinants seemed to have been superseded by GII.e
recombinants in 2009 and GII.g recombinants in 2010. This study showed that the emergence of novel GII.4
variants together with novel GII recombinants could lead to an explosion in NoV outbreaks, likewise to what was
observed in 2008 and 2010. Among recombinants detected in this study, two hitherto unreported strains GII.e/GII.3
and GII.g/GII.1 were characterised. Surveillance will remain important to monitor contemporaneously circulating
strains in order to adapt preventive and curative strategies.

Background
Noroviruses (NoVs) are on the rise as a causative agent
of gastroenteritis in humans of all ages and are responsible for approximately 90% of epidemic non-bacterial
outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the world. Transmission
can occur through direct contact with shedding persons,
contaminated food, sewage-contaminated water, contaminated aerosols and environmental contamination
[1]. Food-borne transmissions have been estimated to
account for 14% of infections due to NoV [2]. The
major issue with NoV infections is their frequent occurrence in large outbreaks in community settings such as
hospitals and nursing homes [3,4].
The genus Norovirus belongs to the family Caliciviridae along with 4 other genera (Vesivirus, Lagovirus,
Sapovirus and Nebovirus). NoVs are non-enveloped
viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense, polyadenylated RNA genome of about 7500 nucleotides (nt) in
length [5]. Three overlapping ORFs encode the nonstructural (ORF1) and structural (ORF2 and ORF3) viral
proteins. The ORF1-encoded polyprotein is cleaved
further by the viral proteinase into six mature products
including the genome-linked virus protein (VPg), the
proteinase and the highly conserved RNA-dependent
RNA-polymerase [6]. Due to its high conservation, the
polymerase has been a widely used target for molecular
detection assays [7]. ORF 2 encodes the major capsid
protein (VP1) that contains an N-terminal arm, a shell
or S-domain and a protrusion or P-domain. The Pdomain is divided into 2 sub-domains called P1 and P2,
the latter corresponding to the most variable region of
the capsid. ORF3 encodes for a small minor structural
protein of the virion [8].
NoVs are genetically highly diverse and are divided
into five genogroups (GI-V) which are further subdivided into at least 29 genotypes based on genetic differences in the capsid gene [9-11]. GI and GII NoVs are
responsible for most human infections. The absence of a
regular cell-culture system or small-animal model for
human NoVs led to the development of molecular tools
to study the epidemiology of NoVs. GII.4 has been by
far the most detected genotype being responsible for 60
to 70% of the outbreaks globally reported to the Foodborne Viruses in Europe (FBVE) network between 1990
and 2008 [12]. During this same period, 4 large pandemics (1995-1996, 2002, 2004-2005 and 2006) have
been identified corresponding each time to the emergence of one or two new variants of the GII.4 lineage
and the displacement of the previously predominant circulating ones [13,14]. Frequently reported as second
most prevalent NoVs after GII.4 strains, are GII.b
recombinants [15]. Since the first detection in France in
August 2000, they have been involved in outbreaks

Page 2 of 13

across the globe thereby demonstrating their spreading
capacity among human populations [16,17]. Along with
small-scale mutations, recombination events seem to
contribute to the genetic variability between NoVs. This
phenomenon was identified by incongruent clustering of
different regions of the genome in phylogenetic analyses
for NoVs from all 5 genogroups [18-20]. Based upon
predictive models, the majority of NoV recombinants
have breakpoints located either within or close to the
ORF1-ORF2 junction. Consequently, this region has
been suggested to constitute a recombination hotspot in
NoVs [21].
To gain insight into the epidemiologic patterns of
NoV outbreaks and to determine the genetic variation
of NoVs strains circulating in Belgium, we analyzed
stool samples originating from patients infected with
NoVs in foodborne outbreak investigations conducted
by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health
(IPH). These studies involved predominantly large outbreaks occurring in community settings between
December 2006 and December 2010.

Methods
Definitions

At European level a food-borne outbreak (FBO) is
defined as an incidence, observed under given circumstances, of two or more human cases of the same disease and/or infection; or a situation in which the
observed number of human cases exceeds the expected
number and where the cases are linked, or are probably
linked, to the same food source (Directive 2003/99/EC,
Article 2(d)). A human NoV infection is described as a
case with the typical gastroenteritis symptoms as started
between 12-24 h after infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and in some cases also slight fever along with the
laboratory confirmation of the presence of NoVs in clinical samples.
Sample collection and stool specimens

Since 2005, the IPH harbors the National Reference
Laboratory for foodborne outbreaks (NRL FBO) and it
is responsible for collecting, centralizing the information, reporting and follow up of FBOs in Belgium. In
case of an outbreak, stool samples were sent to the IPH
by the Health Inspectors or clinical laboratories at hospitals. Food samples were sent to the NRL FBO by the
local inspectors of the Federal Agency for Safety of the
Food Chain (FASFC). Samples were stored refrigerated
(2-8°C) during transport and analyses started the day of
arrival at the NRL FBO. In total, 164 NoV-positive stool
specimens from cases of acute gastro-enteritis were collected during the 4-year period from December 2006
through December 2010.

Laboratory investigation: norovirus detection

Stool suspensions (10%, [weight/volume]) were prepared
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). One hundred microliters supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 5
minutes at 13000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415D, Rotselaar, Belgium). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Leusden, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s instructions. NoV was extracted from foodstuff
according to the protocol as previously described with
slight modifications [22]. Briefly, 10 g of food was homogenized with 8 ml TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and shaken for 20 min at room
temperature to allow contact. After centrifugation for 10
minutes (13000 rpm) at 4°C (Eppendorf 5804R, Rotselaar,
Belgium) the aqueous phase is transferred into a new
tube for further concentration/purification. Two hundred
microliters of chloroform is added for each ml of TRIzol®
reagent used, and mixed for 15s followed by 2-3 min settling before centrifugation (13000 rpm, 15 min, 4°C).
One hundred microliters of the upper (aqueous) phase
was used for RNA extraction using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Leusden, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The reverse transcription (RT)
step was performed using the Transcriptor High Fidelity
cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Vilvoorde, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-Time PCR
(qPCR) was performed using available primers and
probes for the detection of the majority of the human GI
(QNIF4, CGCTG GATGCGNTTCCAT; NV1LCR,
CCTTAGACGCCATCATCATTTAC; NV1LCpr, FAMTGGACAGGAGAYCGCRATCT-TAMRA) and GII
(QNIF2, ATG TTCAGRTGGATGAGRTTCTCWGA;
COG2R, TCG ACGCCATCTTCATTCACA; QNIFS,
FAM-AGCA CGTGGGAGGGCGATCG-TAMRA) NoV
strains, recommanded by the CEN/TC/WG6/TAG4
research group [23,24]. Double stranded DNA (plasmid
DNA GI and plasmid DNA GII) was used as positive
control of the qPCR at a concentration of 2500 copies
per reaction [25].
RNA preparation, genomic amplification for genotyping

For all samples tested positive for norovirus by RTqPCR, viral RNA was re-extracted from 140 μl sample
supernatant with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Leusden, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extracts were stored at -80°
C before use. For genotyping, published primers were
used for the amplification and sequencing of the 3’ of
the polymerase gene (region A in ORF1), the 5’ end of
the capsid gene (region C in ORF2) and the nearly full
length major capsid gene [7,26,27] (Table 1 and 2).
First-stranded cDNA was generated by an iScript cDNA
Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium). PCRs were
carried out on 4 μl cDNA in 50 μl nuclease-free water

containing 300 nM of both forward and reverse primers,
0.1 mM dNTPs, 2.5% DMSO, 20 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton
X-100 and 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase (New England
Biolabs, Leusden, The Netherlands). The nearly complete capsid gene and ORF1-ORF2 junction were amplified using Iproof High Fidelity polymerase (Biorad,
Nazareth, Belgium). Sequences covering the overlap
between ORF1 and ORF2 were amplified when phylogenetic analyses indicated incongruent clustering for the
partial sequences of the polymerase and the capsid
genes for the same samples. After amplification, the
amplicons were visualized by electrophoresis and purified by using either a standard ethanol precipitation protocol or the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
Leusden, The Netherlands) according to instructions
given by the manufacturer. Direct sequencing of PCR
products was carried out by GATC Biotech sequencing
facilities (Konstanz, Germany) in both directions using
an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Lennik, Belgium).
Molecular typing, phylogenetic analysis and
recombination study

All sequences were typed with the genotyping tool for
NoVs, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, The Netherlands at http://www.rivm.nl. Database searches for related sequences were conducted
using BLAST. Reference strains for phylogenetic analysis
were selected from the Norovirus genotyping tool and
are given in the Additional file 1 Table S1. All
sequences were aligned at the protein level using the
MUSCLE algorithm [28] to produce more robust alignments and were back-translated into nucleic acid
sequences for subsequent analyses. Phylogenetic trees
were inferred on the previously aligned sequences under
a maximum-likelihood framework using PhyML [29]
under a GTR evolutionary model [30] with optimized
invariable sites and a discrete gamma model with 4classes of optimized rates to model the variability of
substitution rates across sites [31]. Branch support was
inferred using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like non-parametric procedure [32]. To accommodate for weak phylogenetic signal, a thorough exploration of the tree
space was made through topological rearrangements
using a combination of Nearest Neighbor Interchange
and Subtree Pruning and Regrafting topology search
methods as implemented in PhyML [33,34]. Finally, for
visualization purposes, the trees were then arbitrarily
rooted.

Results
Characterisation of NoV outbreaks in Belgium, 2006-2010

From December 2006 to December 2010, a total of 458
gastroenteritis outbreaks, suspected to be food-borne,
were reported to the Belgian IPH (Additional file 2
Table S2). During this period, NoVs were involved in 54
(11.8%) of the reported outbreaks and affected 34.5% of
all patients reported ill. Classification of NoVs into genogroups GI and GII was possible for all samples tested
positive by RT-qPCR but more accurate genotyping
(genotype and sub-genotype) was only possible for over
half of the NoV outbreaks (Additional file 2 Table S2).

Indeed, phylogenetic analyses were performed with 63
NoV-positive samples for the partial polymerase (N =
45) and/or capsid gene (N = 35) sequences. For 12 samples, sequences covering the ORF1-ORF2 junction were
obtained. Despite the fact that NoVs were detected in
some food samples, no sequences could be obtained as
amplification by conventional RT-PCR was unsuccessful.
With the exception of 2009, the number of reported
NoV outbreaks increased throughout the years; particularly in 2010 where NoV outbreaks represented more
than 30% of the reported outbreaks. When the monthly
distribution of NoV outbreaks over the 4-year study period was plotted, two peaks in NoV activity could be
seen; one in the autumn-winter 2008/2009 and another
from December 2009 to September 2010 (Figure 1A). In
both cases, the increase in NoV activity coincided with
the detection of novel NoV strains. From 2006 until

Figure 1 Characteristics of noroviruses detected in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks reported in Belgium. A) Monthly distribution of
norovirus (NoV)-associated outbreaks in Belgium from December 2007 to December 2010. Months corresponding to the primer detection of
novel NoV genotypes (GII.e and GII.g) or sub-lineages (GII.4 variants 2007, 2008 and 2010) are indicated by an arrow; Diversity of NoV
genogroups (B), genotypes and GII.4 sub-lineages (C) detected in gastro-enteritis outbreaks in Belgium during 2006 and 2010. Percentages
of genogroup prevalence are indicated in the vertical bars. Typing results were obtained by phylogenetic clustering with reference strains
(http://www.noronet.nl/) either for the partial polymerase gene sequence (grey) or the partial capsid gene sequence (black).

2010, GII NoVs outbreaks largely predominated and
represented 90.4% of the NoVs either in single infections or in co-infection with GI NoVs (Figure 1B). GI
single infections and GI-GII co-infections represented
respectively 16 and 28% of the outbreaks reported in
2010. Phylogenetic analysis allowed GII NoVs clustering
into 7 different genotypes: GII.4 strains (15 outbreaks,

50%), recombinant GII.g/GII.1 (5 outbreaks, 16.7%),
recombinant GII.e/GII.4 (3 outbreaks, 10%), GII.2 (2
outbreaks, 6.6%), GII.7 (2 outbreaks, 6.6%), GII.13 (1
outbreak, 3.3%) and recombinant GII.e/GII.3 (1 outbreak, 3.3%) (Figure 1C). Two GI NoV outbreaks were
successfully genotyped and clustered into GI.4 and GI.7.

identified since 2006: 2006a, 2006b, 2007, 2008 and
2010; of all the GII.4 variants the majority clustered
with the new GII.4 2010 variant. The only outbreak
reported in 2006 was linked with GII.4 2006b whereas
GII.4 2006a was identified in the only typed outbreak of
2007. The 2006b variants were detected until March
2009 in co-circulation with GII.4 variants 2007 and
2008; subsequently they were displaced by the 2010 variant first described in December 2009 (Figure 1A).
Detection of novel GII.4 variants

Phylogenetic clustering with GII NoV reference strain
sequences from the Noronet European genotyping tool
(Additional file 1 Table S1) allowed the characterisation
of NoV circulating during the period of this study. Phylogenetic trees were drawn for both the partial polymerase
and capsid gene sequences (Figure 2 and 3) and genotyping results for the amplified region of each sample are
shown in table 1. GII.4 NoV sequences were shown to
group within 4 and 6 clusters for the polymerase and
capsid genes respectively. Besides the pandemic variants
GII.4 2006a and GII.4 2006b, GII.4 sequences clustered
with newly reported GII.4 sequences; 2007 (for the capsid
gene only), 2008 and 2010. One single outbreak in 2008
was caused by GII.4 2008 variant whereas GII.4 2007
capsid gene sequences were amplified from samples originating from 4 outbreaks in late 2008 and early 2009. In
two of these outbreaks, the 2007 variant was detected
with the 2006b variant either in the same sample
(IPH2839) or in two samples from the same outbreak
(IPH3060 and IPH3069). In a sample from a third outbreak, a GII.4 2006b polymerase was found in combination with a GII.4 2007 capsid gene sequence (IPH2700).
A GI.7 NoV was found co-circulating with GII.4 2010 in
samples originating from an identical outbreak. Since
December 2009, GII.4 2010 was the only GII.4 variant
detected. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all GII.4
2010 sequences amplified from the polymerase gene
grouped into one single cluster whereas the corresponding partial capsid gene sequences formed two different
genetic clusters. Of these capsids, only two (IPH161 and
IPH1010) belonged to the cluster formed by the GII.4
2010 reference strain. Although highly related (97.2 and
98% similarity between the 253 bp long partial capsid
gene sequences), the other strains grouped into a novel
GII.4 capsid variant that we called GII.4 2010b.
Identification of a novel GII recombinant

The identification of inconsistent genotype or sub-genotype clustering for the partial polymerase and capsid
gene sequences for NoV strains (Figure 2 and 3) allowed
the description of 5 types of recombinants involved with
14 outbreaks: GII.4 2010/GII.4 2010b (5 outbreaks), GII.
g/GII.1 (4 outbreaks), GII.e/GII.4 2007 (3 outbreaks),

Page 7 of 13

GII.e/GII.3 (1 outbreak) and GII.4 2006b/GII.4 2007 (1
outbreak). Except from the GII.4 intergenotype recombinants, recombinants identified in this study had GII
polymerase genes for which no associated capsid genes
have been described, namely GII.e and GII.g which
shared 93.1 - 94.2% and 95.6 - 100% nucleotide identity
with reference strains OC07138/07/JP and NSW199U/
08/AU, respectively. GII.e polymerases were either
detected in association with GII.4 2007 or GII.3 capsids
(Figure 2; Figure 3; Figure 4C and 4D) whereas all GII.g
polymerases were identified with GII.1 capsids (Figure 2;
Figure 3 and 4B). Simplot analyses showed potential
recombination cross-over for all the recombinant types
to be located at, immediately upstream or downstream
the ORF1-ORF2 overlap (Figure 4).

Discussion
During the monitoring of NoVs implicated with outbreaks in Belgium, the detection of novel GII recombinants and of GII.4 variants came along with increased
outbreak reporting in 2008 and 2010. This is the first
report of GII.e/GII.3 and GII.g/GII.1 recombinants
implicated in outbreaks and molecular data obtained in
this study for NoVs could be representative of the current epidemiological situation for Western European
countries.
NoVs implicated in suspected foodborne outbreaks
reported in Belgium between December 2006 and
December 2010 emphasised their importance and implication in public health. Considering that, similarly to
previously published data [35], the aetiology remains
unknown for 20 to 50% of the reported outbreaks (data
not shown), the implication of NoV in 11.8% of the outbreaks showed the importance of NoVs in foodborne
outbreaks in Belgium. The presence of NoV in food was
confirmed in 16 of the 35 (46%) suspected foodborne
outbreaks for which food samples were provided (data
not shown). Unfortunately, no sequences could be
obtained from these matrices. Also, epidemiological
information never involved the consumption of primary
infected foodstuffs in outbreaks caused by NoV [36].
Thus, outbreaks analysed in the study period mainly
consisted in NoV outbreaks where human-to-human
transmissions were involved either by the consumption
of food contaminated by a foodhandler or by direct contact. Hence, NoVs detected from these outbreaks reflect
the panel of NoVs circulating among individuals in a
contemporaneous population.
As commonly reported in the literature, GII NoVs largely predominated (90.4% of all outbreaks) and GII.4
genotype NoVs were identified in 16 of the 29 typed
outbreaks (55.2%). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that
GII NoV strains detected in Belgium formed different
clades and even subclusters in the pylogenetics trees,

especially for GII.4 NoVs (Figure 1C, 2 and 3). GII.4
subtyping identified the circulation of 5 different variants since the winter of 2006 namely 2006a, 2006b,
2007, 2008 and 2010. GII.4 2008 was identified in one
single outbreak in 2008 and disappeared the same year.
This GII.4 2008 variant has been associated at its primary description in Germany with a very severe case of
gastroenteritis in a young boy [37]. Further data on the
success of this sub-lineage in Europe and Asia are rather
contradictory and report either discreet circulation

[38,39] or stark implication [40,41] in epidemics for
similar study periods. GII.4 2006b variants were repeatedly reported until 2009 in co-circulation with variants
2007 and 2008 before being displaced by newly emerged
GII.4 2010 variants the following year. Multiple reports
showed that until 2009, GII.4 2006b variants predominated upon the newly emerged GII.4 2007 and 2008 variants in other countries [38,42]. The emergence of the
GII.4 2008 sub-lineage did not lead to a larger disease
burden during the following winter season suggesting

analyses were conducted with partial polymerase and capsid gene sequence alignments. Sequences, either a concatemer of partial polymerase

that some GII.4 variants do not dispose of selective
advantages allowing their massive spread and longer
persistence. In Belgium, GII.4 2010 constituted the only
GII.4 variant circulating in 2010 and was involved in 8/
18 typed outbreaks reported in the winter 2009-2010.
Since its first detection in December 2009, the GII.4
2010 variant seemed to have definitively displaced the
2006b sub-lineage suggesting a perfect candidate for the
generation of the observed new burden in NoV epidemics in 2010. Highly similar GII.4 2010 variants were

identified in France as early as February 2009 [40], and
also in Asia, Germany and Hungary since 2008 (BLAST
analyses, data not shown) indicating its dissemination
might have been widespread. More surveillance data
from other continents will be needed to determine the
implication of the GII.4 2010 sub-lineage in global epidemics. In this 4-year study period a diversity of GII.4
subvariants was observed with the subsequent emergence of three GII.4 variants. Our results clearly support
that GII.4 variants evolve more rapidly than any other

genotypes as suggested by the reported 5 to 36-fold
higher mutation rate in GII.4 compared to non GII.4
strains [43].
NoV outbreaks were not exclusively linked with GII.4
viruses, 6 distinct genotypes were identified for both the
polymerase (GII.g, GII.e, GII.2, GII.7, GI.4 and GI.7)
and the capsid (GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.7, GII.13 and
GI.4) genes. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences of
the polymerase and of the N-terminal conserved region
of the capsid protein resulted in trees with different
topologies for 5 different NoV strains, suggesting that
recombination had occurred within these viruses. Four
novel GII intergenotype and intersub-genotype recombinants (GII.e/GII.3, GII.g/GII.1, GII.4 2006b/GII.4 2007
and GII.4 2010/GII.4 2010b) were detected along with 1
previously published recombinant (GII.e/GII.4 2007).
Since the end of 2008, GII.e and GII.g polymerase gene
sequences were amplified in samples from 9 outbreaks
in association with GII.3 or GII.4 2007 and GII.1 capsid
gene sequences, respectively. Previously published
sequences covering the ORF1-ORF2 junction showed
that similar polymerase gene sequences have been
described exclusively in association with GII.4 2007 capsids for GII.e [44-46] and GII.12 capsids for GII.g
[41,44]. The fact that GII.e and GII.g recombinants
identified in this study harboured other capsids than
previously described might indicate that they emerged
after undergoing a recent recombination event. As previously described for GII.b recombinants, several different capsid sequences can be associated with the GII.e
and GII.g polymerase genes [17]. The association of
these polymerases with distinct capsid gene sequences
could provide them some selective advantages over
monophylogenic strains. Indeed, GII.e and GII.g were
both the second most prevalent genotype after GII.4 in
2008-2009 and 2010, respectively. These observations
suggest that the emergence of the GII.e and GII.g
recombinant NoVs could partly explain the increase in
NoV activity observed for these periods. Data upon the
NoVs implicated with the latest NoV epidemics across
the world will be needed to confirm the importance of
these polymerases in NoV epidemiology. The origin of
these polymerases, however, still remains unclear as no
parental full-length sequences yet have been detected.
An intersub-genotype GII.4 2006a/GII.4 2007 recombinant was described based upon a concatemer of partial
polymerase and capsid gene sequences. Direct sequencing did not show any sign of co-infection but in the
absence of a sequence covering the ORF1-ORF2 junction, this could not be ruled out. GII.4 2006b and GII.e/
GII.4 2007 were shown to co-circulate in some 2008
outbreaks offering an opportunity for recombination in
case of a multiple NoV infection. A recent study showed
that part of the GII.4 genotypes circulating in Japan

Page 11 of 13

were in fact mosaics of former GII.4 sub-lineages [46].
Consequently, genetic recombination, in combination
with small-scale mutations, is believed to play a role in
the divergent evolution of GII.4 NoVs. A second potential intersub-lineage recombinant was identified based
upon discordant tree topologies between the partial
polymerase and capsid gene sequences of some GII.4
2010 variants. Indeed, in these samples all polymerase
sequences clustered into one single group whereas the
capsid gene sequences grouped into 2 distinct clusters.
In the absence of a reference strain for the partial capsid
gene sequences that did not cluster with GII.4 2010,
they were referred to as GII.4 2010b. Although, sequencing of whole capsid genes would allow accurate characterisation of this novel variant. In this study, the highly
conserved region C in the capsid gene was amplified for
nearly all strains and only few full capsid gene
sequences were successfully amplified. Amplifying long
sequences from clinical samples remains challenging
and in this study efforts were focused on the obtaining
of sequences covering the ORF1-ORF2 overlap for the
study of recombination breakpoints. SimPlot analyses
confirmed all recombination points to be located at this
junction which corresponds to the previously proposed
hotspot for NoV recombination [21,47].
The nomenclature used in our study is based upon the
clustering with NoV reference strains given for the NoV
genotyping tool of the Dutch National Institute of Public health and the Environment made available by Noronet [48]. Great discrepancy is observed for NoV
genotypes in the literature in particular for GII.4 sublineages that are commonly named after the year of
detection. For instance, NoV strains related to the GII.4
2007 variants detected in this study were referred to as
Cairo & Osaka 2007 in France and Australia [40,44],
GII.4 2007a in Japan [46], GII.4 2008a in Canada [49]
and cluster C in India [15]. Therefore, a common language still needs to be adopted in order to compare
data between research teams. We have chosen reference
strains provided by Noronet because one of the aims of
the Noronet network is the elaboration of a well
founded standardized nomenclature for NoVs.

Conclusions
Although highly diverse, NoVs circulating in Belgium in
the past 4 years were predominantly GII.4 sub-lineages
and GII NoV recombinants indicating that both the
accumulation of mutations and genetic recombination
constitute major driven forces in NoV evolution.
Furthermore, the emergent new GII.4 variants or GII
recombinants might have had an impact on the magnitude of NoV epidemics suggesting that these strains dispose of some selective advantages over other circulating
NoV strains.

A comprehensive study of the NoVs strains predominantly and contemporaneously involved in large and
cost-effective gastro-enteritis outbreaks would help targeting the development of vaccines, therapeutic strategies and/or preventive measure on these particular
strains.
