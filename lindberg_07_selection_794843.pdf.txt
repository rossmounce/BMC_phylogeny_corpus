Abstract
Background: The genetic and molecular mechanisms of tameness are largely unknown. A line of
silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) selected for non-aggressive behavior has been used in Russia since the
1960's to study the effect of domestication. We have previously compared descendants of these
selected (S) animals with a group of non-selected (NS) silver foxes kept under identical conditions,
and showed that changes in the brain transcriptome between the two groups are small.
Unexpectedly, many of the genes showing evidence of differential expression between groups were
related to hemoproteins.
Results: In this study, we use quantitative RT-PCR to demonstrate that the activity of heme
related genes differ between S and NS foxes in three regions of the brain. Furthermore, our
analyses also indicate that changes in mRNA levels of heme related genes can be well described by
an additive polygenic effect. We also show that the difference in genetic background between the
two lines of foxes is limited, as estimated by mitochondrial DNA divergence.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that selection for tameness can modify the expression of heme
related genes in canid brain regions known to modulate emotions and behavior. The possible
involvement of heme related genes in behavior is surprising. It is possible that hemoglobin
modulates the behavior of canids by interaction with CO and NO signaling. Another possibility is
that hemorphins, known to be produced after enzymatic cleavage of hemoglobin, are responsible
for behavioral alterations. Thus, we hypothesize that hemoglobin metabolism can be a functionally
relevant aspect of the domestic phenotype in foxes selected for tameness.

Background
Domestication of animals can be described as the process
by which wild animals adapt to coexistence with humans
and to the environment we provide. Behavioral adapta-

tion to the human environment is achieved through
genetic changes occurring over generations together with
environmental stimulation and experience during an animals lifetime [1]. A common aspect of early domesticaPage 1 of 10

tion is strong artificial selection for animals showing weak
defensive behavior and low aggression towards humans
[1], resulting in tame behavior.
The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) originated from the
domestication of wild gray wolves (Canis lupus) at least
15,000 years ago [2,3]. The molecular mechanisms
responsible for the behavioral changes associated with
domestication in dogs are not known. We have previously
shown that the brain gene expression profile of domestic
dogs has diverged from that observed in their wild ancestor the gray wolf, suggesting that behavioral selection during domestication has modified mRNA expression levels
of genes with multiple functions [4]. However, from the
comparison of domestic animals with their free-living
wild ancestor it is not possible to separate phenotypic differences that have a genetic background from those that
are caused by differences in the animal's external environment and experiences. We therefore decided to study
domestication in another model where environmental
conditions could be well controlled. In the 1960s D.K.
Belyaev, the late director of the Institute of Cytology and
Genetics in Novosibirsk, initiated a domestication experiment on farmed silver foxes, a color morph of the red fox
(Vulpes vulpes), to test the hypothesis that physiological
and morphological changes in the domestic dog could
have resulted from selection for tameness alone [5]. In
this experiment, that still continues, farmed foxes have
been selected for non-aggressive behavior towards man
for more than 40 generations. The selection has resulted
in animals that not only are friendly towards humans, but
also are skilled as dogs in communicating with people [6].
Moreover, developmental, morphological and neurochemical changes (including modulations of the serotonergic system and the activity of the hypothalamuspituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) are associated with the
behavioral changes in the selected foxes [7-10].
We have previously compared the global brain gene
expression of descendants of the selected (S) silver foxes
with a group of non-selected (NS) foxes, raised under identical conditions in a Norwegian farm [11]. Our microarray
results suggested that behavioral changes caused by selection for tameness may be associated with only limited
changes in the brain transcriptome. Moreover, our results
indicated that expression of several genes related to heme
have been affected by behavioral selection [11]; as many
as six of the 14 clones showing the largest expression differences coded for hemoproteins.
In our previous experiments, mRNA samples from foxes
were cross hybridized to human cDNA microarrays.
Although this is a well accepted method for comparing
transcriptional profiles within species [12], it requires an
additional step of identifying the orthologous genes in fox

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/3/1/18

that were responsible for the signals. Few fox mRNA
sequences are available in public databases. However,
chromosomal organization is almost the same in dogs
and red foxes [13,14], and the sequence homology may be
as high as 99.5% for individual genes [15]. Consequently,
in this study we used dog sequences to design primers for
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to compare the mRNA
levels of five heme-related canine sequences in the brains
of the original sample set of S and NS foxes. To determine
whether the mode of inheritance is primarily additive, we
included animals which resulted from crossing the two
original lines. In addition, we assess the divergence in
genetic background between the S and NS lines, by comparing the left domain of the mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) control region.

Results
Estimation of mtDNA divergence between selected and
non-selected farm foxes
To estimate the genetic variability and degree of differentiation between S, NS and wild foxes we compared 333
base pair (bp) sequences of the left domain of the mtDNA
control region. These sequences were complemented with
others corresponding to wild red foxes deriving from public databases (GenBank). The comparison of the mtDNA
sequences were made for a total of 29 NS, 23 S, 23 Cross,
12 wild foxes and an additional 26 wild foxes retrieved
from databases. Five different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were observed in farm foxes, three of them in the NS
and two in the S foxes. All hybrids (Cross) shared one of
the S haplotypes as the females for line crosses always
were from the S line and the mtDNA is maternally inherited. All sequences observed in farm foxes were very similar. Their pair-wise sequence divergence was lower than
3% in all cases and all clustered in one clade in a neighbor-joining tree (Figure 1). The genetic divergence
between all farm fox haplotypes was similar to that
observed in wild foxes sampled in a geographically limited region in Sweden. The four haplotypes observed in
this wild population occupy different positions in the
neighbor-joining tree. This indicates that the differences
observed among farm animals (either selected or not) are
comparable to the differences observed within one single
natural population, and that S and NS lineages are closely
related, with their haplotypes intermixed within one
clade.
Sequence similarity of heme-related genes between
humans and canids
Since the expressed sequences in foxes should be very similar to sequences in dogs, we identified dog mRNA species
that could have yielded one or more of the signals from
the heme-related human clones on the arrays in our previous study [11] (Table 1). These dog mRNA species corresponded to five predicted dog genes, including four

hemoglobins, namely, the beta (HBB) and epsilon (HBE)
chains (located on canine chromosome 21), the alpha
(HBA) and zeta (HBZ) chains (ESTs that mapped to
canine chromosome 6), and the heme binding protein 1
gene (HEBP1) (located on canine chromosome 27). The
canine mRNA sequence of HBB [GenBank accession
number: LOC480784] and HBE [GenBank: LOC485256]
were similar, as evident from a pair-wise blast (364 identities of 450 bp, e-value = 5e-55), and consequently,
hybridization of either of the two mRNA species in foxes
could have yielded the signals after hybridization to three
human clones: 242594, 292528 and 239611. Similarly,
the two canine ESTs, similar to human HBA [GenBank:
CN003912] and HBZ [GenBank: DN366534], showed a
high sequence similarity (207 identities of 270 bp, e-value
= 4e-33), and either of the sequences expressed in fox
could have yielded the signals on the two human clones
207558 and 248463. Finally, we could only identify one
canine gene, [GenBank: LOC477690] which showed
sequence similarities with the human clone 730346,
encoding HEBP1.
Expression levels of hemoglobin related genes are modified
by selection for tameness
To examine which of the canine heme-related genes were
differentially expressed in brains of selected silver foxes,
and whether the mRNA levels showed evidence of a polygenic additive mode of inheritance, we designed primers
based on canine sequences and quantified the mRNA lev-

els corresponding to HBB, HBE, HBA, HBZ and HEBP1 in
three regions of the brain in 9 S foxes, 17 NS and 12 Cross
and 12 wild. Three hemoglobin genes, HBE, HBB and
HBA, and the heme binding protein HEBP1 showed significantly lower mRNA levels in S foxes than in NS foxes
in all brain regions (Figure 2). The response was similar in
all three brain regions and there were no significant interactions between origin and region (Table 2). The difference between S and NS foxes was 3.1-fold for HBE, 2.3fold for HBB, 2.2-fold for HBA and 1.5-fold for HEBP1
(Table 3). The mRNA levels of the foxes resulting from the
crosses did not provide any strong evidence for a composite dominance effect (p-values > 0.13 for all genes, Table
3), and thus the major variation in mRNA levels between
S and NS foxes appears to be due to a composite additive
genetic effect. However due to the limited sample sizes,
this study was underpowered to detect a moderate dominance effect. The power to detect a dominance effect
between the two parental lines (d = a) were 0.21, 0.47,
0.40, and 0.19 for HBA, HBB, HBE and HEBP1, respectively. Consequently, it is possible that a true dominance
effect of this size may have been overlooked.
To estimate heme-related gene expression in blood cells,
we also performed qPCR on dog blood, where all five
examined transcripts were detected. Thus to evaluate the
potential effect of blood perfusion on HBE and HEBP1
expression levels, we assumed that the average HBA and
HBB levels (HB) could represent the maximum effect of
blood perfusion caused by e.g. a systemic stress response.
The HBE levels clearly increased with the normalized HB
expression (p-value < 0.0001). However, even in presence
of a perfusion effect S foxes had a 1.8-fold lower HBE
mRNA levels than NS foxes (p-value = 0.031). The normalized HB level did not significantly affect the expression of HEBP1 (p-value = 0.18). Still if the perfusion effect
was included in the statistical model, the difference in
HEBP1 levels were reduced to 1.3-fold, suggesting that
part of the HEBP1 difference between the S and NS foxes
may be linked to the average HB mRNA levels. These
results suggest that, while we cannot exclude a perfusion
effect, part of the heme-related gene alterations is independent of this effect.
When we compared farmed foxes (S, NS, Cross) versus
wild animals, we noted that HBE was the only gene to
have mRNA levels that differed significantly between
these two groups, with 2.7-fold higher levels in the wild
foxes as compared to farmed (Table 3). This difference is
difficult to explain as changes in environment and time
post-mortem are confounded with the differences
between the groups. Possible differences in HBZ levels
could not be reliably quantified with our qPCR protocol
because its mRNA levels were below the detection limit
for almost half of the investigated samples.

Discussion
We have previously shown that dramatic behavioral
changes caused by selection for tameness may be associated with only limited changes in the brain transcriptome.
In this study, we first evaluated whether differences in
genetic background between S and NS farm foxes (rather
than genetic differences due to selection for tameness)
may be responsible for the observed expression differences, by estimating the mtDNA divergence between S
and NS lines. Our results showed that the mtDNA lineages present in S and NS lines were similar to each other
and did not cluster in reciprocally monophyletic groups.
Although both NS and S foxes were likely to have reduced
genetic diversity due to founding effects and subsequent
drift, our results suggest that they are not likely to derive
from wild populations that had been isolated from each
other for a long time [16]. In fact, all farmed silver foxes
are said to have originated from animals captured in Canada over a Century ago [17]. This could explain their differentiation from wild red foxes from Sweden and implies
that S and NS foxes have a common origin.
Our previous microarray results suggested that hemerelated genes in particular, show pronounced expression
differences between S and NS foxes. Thus, in this study we
used qPCR to quantify mRNA levels of five heme-related
genes in S, NS, and foxes resulting from crossing the two
parental lines, to determine whether we could find any
evidence of an additive genetic effect underlying transcriptional differences between S and NS animals. We found
that four of the five investigated genes, HBA, HBB, HBE
and HEBP1, showed decreased expression levels in foxes
selected for tameness compared to non-selected farm
foxes. If multiple loci controlling gene expression have
been under selective pressure, then we would expect that
the expression variation between the two experimental
populations (and the crosses between them) should primarily follow an additive mode of inheritance. For three
of the genes, HBA, HBE and HEBP1, an additive genetic
component did indeed appear to explain the observed

expression variation. Thus, our results suggest that a selective pressure for tameness may result in direct or indirect
modulation of heme and hemoglobin metabolism. However, for the fourth gene, HBB, the mRNA levels in foxes
resulting from crossing and back-crossing the parental
lines exceeded those of both the S and NS lines, and a simulation analysis revealed that moderate deviations from
additivity could not be ruled out for any of the investigated genes given the limited power of the experiment.
The comparisons with animals in the wild are more difficult to interpret. However, from the comparison of S foxes
with wild foxes it is clear that the abundance of each individual transcript does not predict tameness independently
of context. These results are not surprising since we have
previously shown that environmental effects together
with adaptation to life in captivity have a much larger
influence on brain gene expression in foxes, than selection
for tameness [11]. It is possible that mRNA levels of heme
related genes also are affected by the living conditions of
foxes, and that mRNA levels in wild foxes have been further modified by mRNA degradation (since the post mortem interval in wild foxes was unknown). Thus strict
interpretation of the comparisons of mRNA levels in wild
and farmed foxes is not possible, due to the confounding
effect of selection with systematic differences in environmental variables. Our results thus demonstrate the need
for rigorous control of living environment and experimental conditions when studying the evolution of the
brain transcriptome.
Four of the five investigated genes encode hemoglobin
subunits. The HBA, HBB, HBE and HBZ genes encode
globins (alpha, beta, epsilon and zeta) which, together
with iron-containing heme groups, form hemoglobin
subunits [18]. The fifth gene, HEBP1, encodes a monomeric and soluble protein that binds heme in both man
and mouse [19]. HEBP1 is induced during erythroid differentiation and the protein is likely to be involved in utilization of heme for synthesis of heme proteins [20]. The

coordinated response to selection for tameness in these
genes suggests that heme metabolism and hemoglobin
levels may have been modulated in the brains of tame animals.
In humans, hemoglobin alpha- and beta transcripts are
known to be expressed in both leukocytes and reticulocytes of circulating blood [21,22]. In the normal human
adult, alpha- and beta chains account for more than 98%
of the total globin chains in blood [21]. As hemoglobin
alpha- and beta also are the two dominating globins in fox
blood [23], it is possible that the increased mRNA levels
of these genes in NS foxes could be a manifestation of an
increased perfusion in the brain as a direct consequence of
a stronger stress response to human handling. However,
HBA and HBB differences between S and NS foxes could
only partly account for the observed decreased levels of
HBE and HEBP1 in selected foxes. Thus, although a sys-

temic response to stress may have contributed to the
observed differences in levels of hemoglobin transcripts,
our results suggest that selection may also have direct
effects on the heme metabolism in the brain of tame animals. Possible consequences of an altered heme metabolism in the brain on tame behavior are discussed below.
Although involvement of hemoglobin genes in behavior
is surprising, several observations support this possibility.
First, a gene involved in behavior should be expressed in
brain cells, and both hemoglobin α and β are expressed in
neurons and glial cells [24]. Second, besides the well
known role as an oxygen transport molecule, hemoglobin
also binds carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO)
with high affinity, and acts as an extra-cellular scavenger
of these signaling molecules in the mammalian brain
[20]. Evidence from in vivo studies demonstrates that CO
produced from the enzymatic cleavage of heme, has

important biological functions in the control of the stress
response of mammals [25,26]. Nitric oxide also modulates the neuroendocrine responses and behavior that is
linked to serotonin and the HPA-axis [27-29]. A third evidence for a potential role of hemoglobin in behavior is
based in the knowledge that β-, κ-, δ- and ε-chains of
hemoglobin also serve as the main precursors for hemorphins, a class of endogenous "non-classical" opioid peptides [30]. Hemorphins are naturally occurring peptides
in brain, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, with high binding affinity to μ- and δ-opioid receptors [30]. Although the
function of hemoglobin in the brain is not known,
hemorphins induce release of β-endorphin and dynorphin, endogenous opioids that are released in response to
acute stress or pain [31,32]. From these results we postulate that hemorphins may also modulate stress responses

in the fox. Similarly, it has been suggested that hemorphins produce dampening of exploratory and aggressive
behavior in mice [33,34].
We have previously showed that genetic changes in behavior caused by selection for tameness may be associated
with only limited changes in the brain transcriptome [11].
In this study, we present evidence indicating that selection
for tameness has modulated heme and hemoglobin
metabolism in the brain, and that the (additive) mode of
inheritance of mRNA expression is similar to that of tame
behavior. It can not be ruled out that part of the observed
response of heme related transcripts is the result from a
systemic stress response. However, our results indicate
that selection has also had direct effects on the heme
metabolism in the brain of tame animals, and we hypoth-

esize that heme-related genes are directly, or indirectly,
involved in behavior related to tameness.

Experimental Procedures
Animals
Samples from two groups of farm silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes), selected (S) and non-selected (NS) for tame behavior,
were used in this study. The selected (S) foxes were
descendants from two male and three female Russian silver foxes that were imported to Norway in 1996 from the
Institute of Cytology and Genetics at the Russian Academy
of Sciences (Novosibirsk, Russia) and belonged to a line
of foxes that had been selected for tame behavior for more
than 40 generations [8]. The non-selected (NS) animals
consisted of Norwegian farm-bred silver foxes that had
not been selected for tame behavior. We also included
animals from crossing (Cross) the two parental lines(F1)
and fromback-crossing the F1 animals to the NS line. The
silver foxes were kept at a farm belonging to the Norwegian University of Life Science (Ås, Norway) and housed
in cages of standard dimensions in accordance with the
regulations of the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and
Food. Foxes of the S and NS lines were randomly located
in cages within the same building, were treated in the
same way, had equal amount and kind of interaction with
humans and were fed simultaneously. The foxes were
euthanized in a random order for all groups during two
consecutive days during January 2004, and all brains were
removed and frozen to -80°C within 20 minutes after
death. Samples of wild red foxes (wild) from central Sweden were used for comparison. These animals were shot
during fox hunts in February 2004 and submitted by
hunters to the Swedish National Veterinary Institute for
necropsy, where brains were collected and frozen to 80°C. This resulted in a wider variation in postmortem
intervals, which might have affected transcript levels,
along with several other environmental differences (e.g.
living conditions, diet, method used to kill them). Sex and
age of individual foxes used in this study can be found in
Table S1 in the Supplementary Material (see Additional
file 1). All foxes studied died for other reasons than their
participation in this study.
Tissue samples and isolation of nucleic acids
Amygdala, frontal lobe and hypothalamus were morphologically identified with the support of a pathologist at the
Swedish National Veterinary Institute. Samples from the
three regions were processed as previously described
[4,11]. Briefly, frozen tissue was homogenized in TRIzol®,
and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturers'
instructions (Invitrogen™, Life Technologies). About 10–
30 μg of tissue were digested over night at 37°C in 500 μl
of Laird's buffer (0.1 M Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 7
mM SDS, adjusted to pH 8.5) with 0.3 mg proteinase K.
DNA was extracted using a modified phenol/chloroform

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/3/1/18

protocol [35]. For some samples, DNA was extracted from
the TRIzol® leftovers after RNA isolation using the PureGene® DNA kit (Gentra systems). The concentrations of
extracted RNA and DNA were measured using a NanoDrop® ND-1000 instrument (NanoDrop Technologies,
USA).
MtDNA control region amplification and sequencing
For the mtDNA analysis, DNA was extracted from 29 NS,
23 S, 23 Cross (16 F1 + 7 backcrosses) and 12 wild foxes.
The left domain of the mitochondrial control region was
PCR-amplified and sequenced using the primers, Thr-L
15926 5'-CAA TTC CCC GGT CTT GTA AAC C-3' and DLH 16340 5'-CCT GAA GTA GGA ACC AGA TG-3' [36]. The
amplification was done in a reaction volume of 10 μl,
which included 1 × HotStar buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer,
0.2 mM dNTP, 2.25 mM MgCl2, 0.45 U HotStarTaq® and
20 ng DNA. A negative control was included in the PCR
reaction to check for contamination. The PCR profile
included an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 7 min
followed by 35 cycles of amplification (denaturation at
95°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 2 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min and 30 s) and a final extension at
72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were then purified
with ExoSAP-IT (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing of
the purified PCR products was done on a MegaBACE™
1000 (Amersham Biosciences) following protocols and
using chemistry recommended by the manufacturer. The
forward and reverse sequences for each fragment were
aligned with Sequencher 4.1.4 (Gene Codes Corporation,
Ann Arbor, MI) and consensus sequences were constructed.
Phylogeny reconstruction
A neighbor-joining tree was built with sequences corresponding to the farm foxes and wild foxes. Additionally to
these, 26 red fox sequences were obtained from public
databases as well as one arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) that was
used as outgroup. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree
was obtained with PAUP 4.0b10 [37] using the Kimura 2parameter model of sequence evolution, with a gamma
shape parameter a = 0.5. The support for the tree topology
was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates.
Real-Time RT-PCR assay
Messenger-RNA was isolated from amygdala, hypothalamus and frontal lobe from a total of 50 foxes, including
17 NS, 9 S, 12 Cross (6 F1 + 6 backcross) and 12 wild foxes
as described previously [11]. In brief, each sample was
extracted with PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation Systems
(Promega) and converted to cDNA using TaqMan® Gold
RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). Preparations of 21 μl
qPCR reactions using SYBR® Green PCR Core Reagents kit
(Applied Biosystems) were added to plates where 4 μl of
all 150 samples (50 individuals × 3 brain regions) were

randomly distributed on two 96-well plates according to
a balanced incomplete block design with respect to origin
(S, NS, Cross and wild), sex and tissue. The sequences of
the human clones corresponding to HBG1, HBG2, HBE,
HBZ/HBA1, HBZ, and HEBP1 present in the arrays used
for the study of Lindberg et al. (2005) were used for BLAST
searches of the dog genome, and the homologous dog
sequences were used to design qPCR primers. Primers
were also designed for the reference genes GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and ACTB
(Actin, beta); all primer sequences are available in the
Supplementary Material (see Additional file1). The qPCR
reactions were run on an ABI PRISM® 7000 Sequence
Detector System (Applied Biosystems) using the default
thermal profile; 50°C for 2 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of amplification with denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds and annealing/extension at
60°C for 1 min.
Real-Time RT-PCR data analysis
The qPCR data was analyzed with the following mixed
ANCOVA model:

yjkli = μ + Pi+ Oj+ F(O)jk+ Rl+ (OR)jl+ β Gikl + ε
where yjkli refers to the mRNA expression in lth brain region
of fox jk, P to the ith PCR-plate, O to the jth group of origin
(wild, S, NS, Cross), F the kth fox within group j, R to the lth
region of the brain, OR to the interaction between the jth
group and the lth region, G to the reference gene expression in region l of fox jk and β to the regression coefficient.
Initially, both age and sex were included in the statistical
analysis but the effect of these parameters was not shown
to be significant. When included as potential confounders, neither age nor sex affected the expression difference
between S and NS foxes, and consequently these variables
were excluded from the final model. In the analysis, the
differences between origin (S, NS, Cross, wild) is assessed
using the between-animal variability, whereas the effects
of region and the interaction between region and origin is
assessed using the variability of samples within animal.
We used three contrasts to: 1) compare the average mRNA
levels of S and NS foxes (corresponding to an additive
genetic effect), to 2) test the dominance deviation by comparing the mRNA levels of the foxes resulting from crosses
to the weighted average of the parental lines (5/8 NS + 3/
8 S, which represents the expected value for the crossed
foxes under an additive model), and 3) to test the difference between wild foxes and the average of all farmed
foxes. To account for variation in mRNA quantity, the geometric mean of the expression of the two reference genes
ACTB and GAPDH [38] were included as the covariate (G)
in the model [39]. The analysis was carried out in Proc
Mixed, SAS v8.2. A modified version of the above linear
model was used for power analysis of a genetic model

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/3/1/18

including a composite additive (a) and a composite dominance (d) effect. That is, mRNA levels of the target genes
were simulated, replacing "O" value in the formula above
with "a" for S foxes, "-a" for NS foxes, "d" for F1 animals,
and "0.5 d" for backcrosses. The interaction terms OR
were dropped from the model as there were little evidence
for any interactions between origin and region (Table 2).
For the simulations, observed reference genes expression
was used together with estimated effects for: "a", "P", "R",
"Owild", and "β," and the dominance effect "d" was set to
equal "a". The random effects "Fjk" and "εijkl", were drawn
from two normal distributions (0, σF) and (0, σε) respectively, again using estimates of the between and within
animal variance components from our data. For each gene
10 000 simulations were carried out and the power to
detect an additive effect was defined as the fraction of simulations in which the contrast S versus NS was significant
at α = 0.05. The power to detect dominance was defined
as the fraction of simulations in which the contrast Cross
vs. (5/8 NS + 3/8 S) was significant at α = 0.05.
To examine if an increased blood perfusion could be the
main driver of the observed mRNA differences between S
and NS foxes, we assumed that the average HBA and HBB
levels (HB) may reflect the maximum effect of blood perfusion. Since the average HB level was correlated to the
reference gene expression (r2 = 0.52, slope = 1.0 p-value <
0.0001), we normalized the HB levels prior to the analysis. This was done by regressing the average HB expression
onto the total reference gene expression and storing the
residuals as the normalized HB expression. This orthogonalized HB expression is positive when the amount of HB
is larger than expected from the reference gene expression,
and is negative when the average HB amount is lower than
expected from the reference gene expression. The HB
mRNA level was then included as an additional covariate
in the original model, and thus the expression difference
of HBE and HEBP1 was evaluated taking the maximum
perfusion effect into account.
