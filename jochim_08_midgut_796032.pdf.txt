Abstract
Background: In the life cycle of Leishmania within the alimentary canal of sand flies the parasites
have to survive the hostile environment of blood meal digestion, escape the blood bolus and attach
to the midgut epithelium before differentiating into the infective metacyclic stages. The molecular
interactions between the Leishmania parasites and the gut of the sand fly are poorly understood.
In the present work we sequenced five cDNA libraries constructed from midgut tissue from the
sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis and analyzed the transcripts present following sugar feeding, blood
feeding and after the blood meal has been processed and excreted, both in the presence and
absence of Leishmania infantum chagasi.
Results: Comparative analysis of the transcripts from sugar-fed and blood-fed cDNA libraries
resulted in the identification of transcripts differentially expressed during blood feeding. This
included upregulated transcripts such as four distinct microvillar-like proteins (LuloMVP1, 2, 4 and
5), two peritrophin like proteins, a trypsin like protein (Lltryp1), two chymotrypsin like proteins
(LuloChym1A and 2) and an unknown protein. Downregulated transcripts by blood feeding were
a microvillar-like protein (LuloMVP3), a trypsin like protein (Lltryp2) and an astacin-like
metalloprotease (LuloAstacin). Furthermore, a comparative analysis between blood-fed and
Leishmania infected midgut cDNA libraries resulted in the identification of the transcripts that were
differentially expressed due to the presence of Leishmania in the gut of the sand fly. This included
down regulated transcripts such as four microvillar-like proteins (LuloMVP1,2, 4 and 5), a
Chymotrypsin (LuloChym1A) and a carboxypeptidase (LuloCpepA1), among others. Upregulated
midgut transcripts in the presence of Leishmania were a peritrophin like protein (LuloPer1), a
trypsin-like protein (Lltryp2) and an unknown protein.
Conclusion: This transcriptome analysis represents the largest set of sequence data reported
from a specific sand fly tissue and provides further information of the transcripts present in the sand

fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. This analysis provides the detailed information of molecules present in the
midgut of this sand fly and the transcripts potentially modulated by blood feeding and by the
presence of the Leishmania parasite. More importantly, this analysis suggests that Leishmania
infantum chagasi alters the expression profile of certain midgut transcripts in the sand fly during
blood meal digestion and that this modulation may be relevant for the survival and establishment
of the parasite in the gut of the fly. Moreover, this analysis suggests that these changes may be
occurring during the digestion of the blood meal and not afterwards.

Background
Leishmaniasis is a spectrum of diseases caused by numerous species of the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania
which are transmitted by Phlebotomine sand flies. Different forms of disease presentation can be linked with the
various species of Leishmania parasites, with the visceral
form of the disease being caused mainly by the Old World
Leishmania infantum or the New World variant Leishmania
infantum (chagasi). Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease
which is commonly fatal if left untreated. Currently, there
is no licensed vaccine for the prevention of visceral disease
in humans and current drug treatment with antimonials
and other components is a lengthy and arduous procedure with undesirable secondary effects [1].
The sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, the principal vector of
the parasite Leishmania infantum chagasi, is the most significant source of American visceral leishmaniasis. As with
many other arthropod-borne diseases, transmission of the
Leishmania parasite, occurs during the act of vector blood
feeding upon a vertebrate host. Upon blood meal ingestion a large number of events are induced, including
digestion, metabolism, diuresis, and ultimately oogenesis. Unlike arboviruses, Plasmodium or Borrelia, Leishmania can complete the necessary developmental changes
and propagate to numbers sufficient for transmission and
infection solely within the confines of the midgut tissue of
the sand fly [2]. Several sand fly proteases involved in
blood meal digestion and implicated in the species specificity between Leishmania and the respective vectors have
been characterized and include trypsins, chymotrypsins
and chitinases from both L. longipalpis and Phlebotomus
papatasi [3,4].
More global approaches to identifying and characterizing
sand fly molecules has been accomplished through the
sequencing of whole sand fly-derived expressed sequence
tags [5]. While that study contributes to the knowledge of
the molecular components of the sand fly it does not provide the specific molecules of the midgut tissue, which
would interact with the developing parasites. The construction and sequencing of midgut tissue-specific cDNA
libraries aims therefore, to identify those molecules
involved in blood meal digestion and metabolism, peritrophic matrix formation, and possible parasite associa-

tions. Here we have generated and sequenced five cDNA
libraries from the midgut tissue from L. longipalpis; investigated the molecules present during sugar and blood
feeding as well as after the blood meal has been processed
and excreted, both in the presence and absence of L. infantum chagasi. In addition to the identification of midgutassociated molecules, sequence analysis and phylogenetic
comparison of the sequences of L. longipalpis allows a better understanding of blood meal processing in sand flies
and the differences between visceral (Lutzomyia longipalpis) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (Phlebotomus papatasi)
sand fly vectors.

Results and discussion
As the midgut is the primary organ of the sand fly in which
the Leishmania parasite develops, cDNA libraries of the
midgut tissue were constructed, sequenced and analyzed
to investigate the molecules present which may have
important interactions between these two organisms. In
total, five cDNA libraries were constructed from the midgut tissue of female L. longipalpis during different conditions of feeding and digestion. These conditions included
one library combining the midguts from sand flies
allowed to feed on a sucrose solution (SF), a pool of midgut tissue from sand flies fully engorged from an artificial
blood meal 1, 2, and 3 days post blood meal ingestion
(BF), and a pool of midguts from gravid sand flies 5, 6,
and 7 days post blood meal digestion (PBMD). The conditions chosen and the pooling of those times after blood
meal ingestion allows better coverage of the most abundant molecules transcribed in the midgut as well as a comparison of the molecules present prior to blood feeding,
while the blood bolus is present, during digestion of the
blood meal, and after the blood byproducts have been
excreted. Two cDNA libraries were constructed from the
equivalent pools of time points after blood feeding in L.
longipalpis midgut tissue from sand flies which had
ingested amastigote-infected macrophages in an artificial
blood meal (BFi and PBMDi), a more natural presentation of parasites to the blood-feeding sand fly.
Once constructed, approximately 2300 phage plaques
were picked and ultimately sequenced for each of the five
cDNA libraries; generating a total of 9601 high quality
sequences from the midgut tissue of L. longipalpis. These

sequences have been submitted to the NCBI EST database
under accession numbers EW987149 â EW996682. Table
1 summarizes the results of sequence quality and bioinformatics analysis of each library and the combination of
all libraries by the number of sequences analyzed, the
number of high quality sequences used in the bioinformatics analysis, the number of contigs, the number of singletons and the average number of sequences per contig.
Each library generated a similar number of sequences and
sequence recovery from the phage plaques ranged from
79â85%. After discarding low quality sequences, each
library retained 71â80% sequences with an average of
73% of the total 11,520 phage producing high quality
sequence data. Clustering similar sequences into contigs,
based on sequence homology, produced a comparable
number of contigs for each library as well as a similar
number of singletons. The comparable number of high
quality sequences, contigs and singletons produced from
each library allows for a better comparison between the
sequence abundance of specific molecules of interest and
the respective biological condition of the midgut under
which they were recovered. The average number of
sequences used in the cluster of the contigs varied slightly
between libraries. The BF, PBMD, and PBMDi cDNA
libraries contained an average sequence per cluster ratio of
8.4, 8.10 and 8.76, respectively. The SF cDNA library had
a sequence per cluster ratio of 6.86 and the BFi cDNA
library produced an average of 6.34 sequences per cluster.
The combining of all cDNA library sequences produced
655 contigs, 2279 singletons and an average of 9.45
sequences per contig. Each cluster was assigned a putative
function and placed in a functional class based on the
sequence homology to molecules identified by the BLAST
results from the NCBI non-redundant protein, the Gene
Ontology, the conserved domain, rRNA and mitochondrial databases. Figure 1 shows an overall view of
sequence abundance of the functional classes that occurs
during the processes of sugar feeding, blood feeding and
after the digestion of the blood meal. The clusters of those
three cDNA libraries, with an E-value less than 10E-5
result of the KOG BLAST, were grouped according to the
general functional class. Although this is a summation of
a large number of different clusters, the total number of
sequences in each functional class can highlight overall

trends that are potentially important in the processes of
blood feeding and digestion.
Following is a more detailed description of the most
abundant transcripts identified in this analysis:
Proteases
Proteases were among the most abundant transcripts captured in the random sequencing of the midgut cDNA
libraries and included trypsin-like serine proteases, chymotrypsins, carboxypeptidases, and an astacin-like metalloprotease. Table 2 shows the putative proteases identified
in the midgut transcriptome. The Sanger Institute's Lutzomyia longipalpis EST database was searched using BLAST to
find the best matches and results are shown with the corresponding E value. The proteases described here are most
similar to those described in the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi, the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti or Anopheles gambie,
with the exception that cluster 91 encodes a putative carboxypeptidase that shares homology with a molecule
from the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Table 3 shows the

transcript producing a full length, high quality sequence
for each cluster and the putative function of the identified
transcripts. The number of sequences that each cluster
contributed to each of the cDNA libraries is also shown
and from this it can be seen that most proteases are more
abundant, as expected, in the blood fed (BF) and blood
fed-Leishmania infected (BFi) libraries. An interesting
observation is that cluster 18, which encodes a putative
trypsin, is most abundant in the SF, PBMD and PMBDi
cDNA libraries, indicating that this putative trypsin may
have a role other than blood meal digestion or is produced and stored prior to the ingestion of a blood meal.
Table 4 describes the predicted localization, molecular
weight and isoelectric point of these proteases. All of the
identified proteases posses a potential signal peptide and

the molecular weight and isoelectric point given is that of
the predicted mature and secreted protein.
Trypsin
Four trypsin-like transcripts were identified in the transcriptome with high homology to the described P. papatasi
midgut trypsins [3,6]. Clusters 18, 35, 60 and 83 are similar to P. papatasi Pptryp1, Pptryp4, Pptryp2, and Pptryp3,
respectively. Recently, two transcripts from L. longipalpis
midgut EST sequencing were partially characterized and
named Lltryp1, which corresponds with Cluster 35 identified in our cDNA libraries, and Lltryp2, which corresponds
with Cluster 18 [3]. Lltryp2 was found in highest abundance, 434 sequences, with the unique sequence distribution among the five cDNA libraries in that most sequences

were contributed by the sugar fed and post blood meal
digestion groups. In order of decreasing abundance of
sequences are Lltryp1, LuloTryp4, and LuloTryp3. LuloTryp3
and LuloTryp4 had relatively homogenous sequence distribution among the cDNA libraries, although LuloTryp3 was
underrepresented in the PMBDi cDNA library with only
one sequence identified. The distribution of Lltryp1
sequences between the cDNA libraries correlates with
reverse transcriptase-PCR results published showing the
expression of Lltryp1 during the presence of a blood meal
in the female sand fly midgut [3]. Further information
about the putative trypsin molecules can be found in
Table 4, showing the range of molecular weight ranging
from 26.0 to 26.2 kDa. The isoelectric points (pI) of these
putative trypsin vary with Lltryp1 having a higher pI of
6.32, Lltryp has a lower pI of 4.95, and LuloTryp3 and
LuloTryp4 have similar pI of 5.67 and 5.52, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences from Dipteran trypsin molecules and a trypsin from Blattella germanica resulted in two major clades, one containing the A.
gambiae trypsin molecules (group I) and another containing the remaining sequences. Within the other major
clade the sand fly trypsins from L. longipalpis and P. papatasi form two subclades (Group II) (Figure 2A). As previously published[3], Pptryp1 and Pptryp2 form a clade
apart from the clade containing Pptryp3 and Pptryp4. The
putative trypsin molecules identified in L. longipalpis midgut share a high homology with the P. papatasi molecules,
being grouped into the same clades. Multiple sequence
alignment of the trypsin molecules of L. longipalpis depicts
the potential secretory signal peptide, the H/D/S catalytic
site residues and substrate specifying residues (Figure 2B).
A novel midgut-associated serine protease, LuloSerPro, was
identified in the sequencing and annotation of these midgut cDNA libraries. LuloSerPro is predicted to be secreted

and have a mature molecular weight of 29.0 kDa, slightly
larger than the other trypsin-like serine proteases in the
midgut, and has an unusually high predicted pI of 8.26
(Table 4). This molecule, while found in low abundance,
was present in the sugar fed, blood fed-Leishmania
infected, and post blood meal digestion-Leishmania
infected cDNA libraries (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis
and multiple sequence alignments of the midgut trypsin
molecules and LuloSerPro show that while this molecule is
very similar to other trypsin molecules and retains the catalytic residues, this is a distinctly different serine protease
(Figure 2). Additionally, there is a difference in the residues that determine the substrate specificity (Lys to Val)
between the other midgut trypsins and LuloSerPro (Figure
2B).
Chymotrypsin
Chymotrypsin is another serine protease found in abundance in the midgut of this hematophage midgut. This
study identified five clusters with homology to chymotrypsin molecules described in P. papatasi and one cluster
with homology to a putative larval chymotrypsin found in
A. aegypti (Tables 2, 3, 4). Clusters 33, 32, 64, 87, 30 and
31 were named LuloChym1A, LuloChym1B, LuloChym2,
LuloChym3, LuloChym4 and LuloChym5, respectively.
LuloChym4 was found in higher abundance in the sugar
fed cDNA library and LuloChym5 sequences were found in
relatively equal numbers between blood fed and sugar fed
cDNA libraries. In contrast the other chymotrypsin molecules appear in highest abundance in the blood fed and
blood fed-Leishmania infected cDNA libraries (Table 3).
According to sequence numbers between the cDNA libraries it appears that chymotrypsin transcription is quiescent
after the blood meal has been digested and excreted. The
L. longipalpis chymotrypsin sequences have a predicted

LuloChym1B, LuloChym4 and LuloChym5 form a subclade within a clade containing only sand fly chymotrypsin
molecules. The short phylogenetic distance between
LuloChym1A and LuloChym1B and the 95% amino acid

identity they share suggests that these transcript sequences
may represent polymorphisms. Further comparisons
between the amino acid sequences of the midgut-associ-

ated chymotrypsin molecules show that the cysteine and
catalytic residues H/D/S are conserved (Figure 3B).
Carboxypeptidases
The three longest transcripts encoding putative proteases
identified in the analysis are similar to zinc metallocarboxypeptidases found in other insects and significant similarity to ESTs from the Sanger Institute database (Table
2). These transcripts from clusters 104, 107 and 91 were
named LuloCpepA1,LuloCpepA2 and LuloCpepB, have
molecular weights of 45.8, 46.0 and 45.9 kDa and a pI of
5.36, 5.41 and 4.73, respectively (Table 4). Although
LuloCpepA2 appears to be an incomplete transcript with a
5' truncation, based on homology and predicted signal
peptide sequences a putative mature protein can be used
in further characterization and comparison. Most of the
sequences grouped to produce the carboxypeptidase clusters were captured from the blood fed library, suggesting
that these molecules are likely induced by the ingestion or
presence of blood in the midgut of the sand fly (Table 3).
The classification of these molecules as members of the A
or B class of metallocarboxypeptidases was determined by
the output from phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid
sequences (Figure 4A). The phylogenetic tree produced by
this analysis shows distinct clades containing insect
sequences nearly all annotated as either carboxypeptidase
A or carboxypeptidase B molecules. The high node support values of the sand fly carboxypeptidases in the phylogenetic tree imply conservation of these molecules when
comparing the Old World sand fly P. papatasi and that of
the New World sand fly L. longipalpis. Similarity between
the two sand flies, with regards to the carboxypeptidase
molecules, can be seen in amino acid sequence alignments, depicting the high level of identity and retention of
the catalytic residues necessary for metallocarboxypeptidase activity (Figure 4B, 4C). Furthermore, the amino acid
sequence alignment depicts the incongruousness that separates LuloCpepA1 from LuloCpepA2 (Figure 4B).
Astacin
A putative zinc metalloprotease was identified as a likely
astacin-like molecule based on results for a search of the
conserved domains database. This molecule was derived
from clusters 58 and 59, both encoding the same putative
protein, but separated due to differing lengths of 5'- and
3'- UTRs by the bioinformatics software. The astacin-like
metalloprotease was named LuloAstacin and is predicted
to have a molecular weight or 28 kDa once secreted and
pI of 5.36 (Table 4). LuloAstacin was most abundant in
the sugar fed cDNA library in contrast to PpAstacin, an
astacin-like molecule identified in P. papatasi midgut,
which was most abundant in the blood fed cDNA library
(Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis of other putative astacin
amino acid sequences illustrate that one clade is an assemblage of the Dipteran sequences. LuloAstacin branches

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/15

out of the subclade containing PpAstacin and away from
the other Dipteran sequences (Figure 5A). Further differences in amino acid sequence can be visualized in the
multiple sequence alignment of Dipteran astacins and
while LuloAstacin diverges from the other astacin molecules, the residues responsible for zinc-binding and activity are conserved (Figure 5B).
Peritrophin-like proteins
A number of molecules were identified as containing chitin binding domains based on results from the conserved
domains database (Tables 5, 6, 7). Three of the transcripts
resembled previously identified peritrophin molecules
based on sequence homology with peritrophin-A
domains. The most abundant of these putative peritrophin transcripts was named LuloPer1 (Cluster 77/78)
and was overrepresented in the blood fed Leishmaniainfected cDNA library and encodes a likely secreted protein of 27.8 kDa (Tables 6 and 7). LuloPer1 consists of
four chitin-binding domains (Fig. 6A); contrasting the
other two peritrophin molecules, LuloPer2 and LuloPer3,
which are molecules of a single chitin-binding domain
(Figure 6). LuloPer2 and LuloPer3 sequences originated in
higher numbers from blood fed midgut cDNA libraries
and were in relatively equal numbers between the infected
and uninfected sand flies. These small putative peritrophins are predicted to have a mature molecular weight
of 9.2 and 7.5 kDa and isoelectric points of 4.38 and 3.8
for LuloPer2 and LuloPer3, respectively (Table 7).
LuloPer1 is likely to have a role in cross linking chitin
fibrils that will form the peritrophic matrix around the
ingested blood bolus. LuloPer2 and LuloPer3 may have
roles in capping the ends of chitin fibrils or sequestering
free chitinous molecules within the midgut lumen. However, the two sequences share only 39% identity and 44%
similarity, conserving primarily the cysteine residues, suggesting they may have very different ligand specificities or
roles in peritrophic matrix formation or chitin management within the midgut (data not shown). Phylogenetic
analysis of the individual chitin-binding domains from
several other insect peritrophin and mucin molecules
demonstrates conservation of the LuloPer1 domain
arrangement when compared with P. papatasi PpPer1, suggesting that if the domains are gene duplication events
that those events occurred prior to speciation (Figure 6).
Additionally, the small putative peritrophin molecules
domains from LuloPer2 and LuloPer3 form a clade containing another chitin-binding domain from a small peritophin of P. papatasi (Figure 6).

In addition to the putative peritrophin molecules a transcript with homology to a predicted chitin-binding
domain was identified from the clustering of 6 sequences
collected primarily from the blood fed Leishmaniainfected cDNA library. This domain has homology to a

(cluster 48) sequences were underrepresented in the
blood fed cDNA libraries and was relatively equally identified in the sugar fed and post-blood meal ingestion

cDNA. LuloMVP1, LuloMVP2 and LuloMVP5 are of
nearly equal mature molecular weight of 21 kDa based on
the cleavage of the predicted signal peptide present in all
of the microvillar proteins and LuloMVP3 and LuloMVP4
are slightly larger; around 23 kDa. A notable difference in
the isoelectric point among the microvillar proteins was
observed at a predicted value of 8.84 for LuloMVP3,
whereas the other microvillar molecules isoelectric point
ranges from 4.46 to 5.12 (Table 10).
The L. longipalpis microvillar proteins share respective
homology with similar molecules identified in the midgut
of P. papatasi, as demonstrated by amino acid phylogenetic analysis (Figure 7). The sand fly microvillar proteins
are separated from the clade containing cockroaches.
Additionally, LuloMVP2 and LuloMVP5 are in a subclade
with the microvillar proteins of A. aegypti and A. gambiae
while the other molecules pair with the P. papatasi microvillar proteins (Figure 7A). Sequence alignment of the L.
longipalpis microvillar proteins shows little sequence
homology suggesting that the classification of microvillar
proteins is rather broad and in fact these molecules may
have different functions altogether.

Oxidative stress molecules
The sand fly, being an obligate blood feeding insect, must
cope with the physiological challenges posed by the digestion of blood which includes the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) released by free heme and metabolic radicals produced in abundance during the digestion of the blood meal [7]. Five molecules were identified
in the midgut cDNA libraries which have putative roles as

antioxidants such as glutathione s-transferase (GST), catalase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxiredoxin (PRX) (Table 11). In addition to the protection
these molecules may impart on the regulation of ROS due
to blood meal digestion there is evidence that antioxidants interact with and can impact the outcomes of infection by bacterial and parasitic agents [8]. Two transcripts
were identified with homology to GST molecules of the
Class Sigma and Class Delta and Epsilon subfamilies and
were named LuloGST1 and LuloGST2, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative GST molecules supports
the separation and classification of into the subfamily
classes of Sigma and Delta/Epsilon. Additionally,
LuloGST1 is grouped in a subclade with other dipertan
GST molecules while LuloGST2 diverges from the dipteran Delta/Epsilon GST molecules (Figure 8). The
LuloGST1 cluster was generated from sequences from each
of the cDNA libraries made and analyzed while LuloGST2
consists of one sequence from the sugar fed library and
two sequences from the blood fed Leishmania-infected
cDNA library. Additional antioxidant molecules include a
catalase (LuloCAT), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase
(LuloSOD), and peroxiredoxin (LuloPRX) of which
LuloSOD and LuloPRX are both predicted to be secreted
based on the presence of a likely signal peptide sequence.
ROS and reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS) are
important in host defenses against microorganisms and
LuloCAT, LuloSOD and LuloPRX are molecules which
may serve to regulate and prevent damage of the sand fly
midgut by the ROS and RNOS defenses similar to the protective effect of a peroxiredoxin in Anopheles stephensi [9].

Upon the ingestion of a blood meal by a hematophagous
insect a large amount of iron and heme is released during
digestion. To combat the toxic effects of free iron and the
generation of damaging reactive oxygen species ferritin is
produced to sequester the iron and hemoglobin that is
liberated by the digestion of red blood cells. Ferritin molecules are commonly associated with iron metabolism
and it is likely that the molecules identified in this transcriptome engage in metabolic function; however, given
the relative size of the blood meal in comparison with the
sand fly ferritin molecules within the midgut likely serve
a large role in preventing the generation of oxygen radicals
by the Fenton reaction. Two transcripts from clusters 76
and 79 were identified with homology to ferritin lightchain and ferritin heavy-chain molecules and were named
LuloFLC and LuloFHC, respectively (Tables 11 and 13).
The expression of LuloFLC and LuloFHC appears to be
constitutive based on the number of sequences generated
in each cDNA library spanning the condition of sugar fed,
blood fed, and post blood meal digestion (Table 12).
Serine protease inhibitors
Two types of serine protease inhibitors were identified in
the cDNA libraries; a single sequence with homology to
SERPIN and a cluster of 17 sequences with homology to a
Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor (Tables 14, 15, 16).
SERPIN molecules within the midgut of the sand fly may
serve to counteract damaging proteases produced by
microorganisms; however LuloSRPN lacks a predicted signal peptide sequence and thus may serve an intracellular
housekeeping function. LuloKZL, identified from cluster
112, is a small molecule of 6.3 kDa and is predicted to be
secreted. Comparison of LuloKZL with Kazal-type serine
protease inhibitors found in a transcriptome analysis of

the midgut of P. papatasi identified PpKZL1 as a highly
conserved homolog (data not shown). Kazal-type protease inhibitors, such as rhodniin and infestin identified
in Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans, respectively,
have been characterized as thrombin inhibitors; thereby
these molecules would prevent coagulation of ingested
blood to facilitate successful digestion of the blood meal
[10,11]. LuloKZL sequences are more abundant prior to
and during blood meal digestion based on the number of
sequences in the sugar fed, blood fed and post blood meal
digestion cDNA libraries. Additionally, LuloKZL was not
identified in an EST analysis of whole sand fly L. longipalpis and is therefore more likely a midgut-specific molecule found in abundance only in the alimentary tissue [5].
Thus, a prudent hypothesis would be that LuloKZL serves
a similar function, allowing the blood bolus to remain in
a colloidal suspension within the gut to facilitate peristalsis and digestion.
Anti-bacterial molecules
Two molecules, originating from clusters 235 and 1960,
encode a putative peptidoglycan recognition protein
(LuloPGRP) and defensin (LuloDEF), respectively. LuloPGRP is similar to other predicted peptidoglycan recognition proteins found in Glossina morsitans morsitans and
mosquitoes and is phylogenetically distinct from lepidopteran molecues (Figure 9). This is the first report of a putative PGRP identified in sand flies and in searching a
midgut transcriptome database of P. papatasi a molecule
was identified with 87% identity. LuloPGRP may serve as
a pattern recognition protein, specifically for the conserved structure of peptidoglycan indicated by the conservation of the amino acid sequence among insects, as a
component of the sand fly immune system defense

against bacterial pathogens (Figure 9). PGRP molecules
characterized in Bombyx mori and Trichoplusia ni have been
shown to be expressed primarily in the fat body and
hemocytes and it is conceivable that the identification of
LuloPGRP transcripts arose due to a contamination of the
tissue sample [12,13]. It is possible that the midgut tissue
of sand flies express a PGRP for protection against microorganisms ingested during sugar and blood feeding as a
PGRP was identified as preferentially expressed in the
midgut of Samia cynthia ricini [14].
Defensins are another type of innate immune defense that
insect possesses to ward off pathogenic bacteria. A single
sequence, named LuloDEF, was identified in the post
blood meal digestion midgut cDNA library with homology to a defensin molecule characterized in A. aegypti. Like
other insect defensin molecules, LuloDEF has a predicted
secretion signal peptide and most homology is given by
the carboxyl half of the sequence and conservation of
cysteine residues (Figure 10). LuloDEF shares 47% identity and 61% similarity with a defensin characterized in
Phlebotomus duboscqi which is induced by the presence of
wild type Leishmania major [15]. Both immunity-associated genes, LuloPGRP and LuloDEF, may have an impact
on the progression and result of a midgut infection by
Leishmania parasites, either directly or by indirect effects
if co-colonization of the midgut with bacteria is an intermediary confounding factor.

libraries was conducted using Pearson's chi-square equation to identify overrepresented transcripts within each
cluster. As was previously seen in P. papatasi a number of
digestion-associated transcripts were overabundant in the
blood fed cDNA library [6]. We envisioned similar results
in the analysis of the L. longipalpis midgut cDNA libraries
with the enhanced advantage of a cDNA library produced
from midguts that had fully processed and excreted the
blood meal byproducts. It was our hypothesis that the
post blood meal midgut transcript abundance is most
similar to the sugar fed midgut transcript abundance prior
to a blood meal. Overall, the number of sequences per
cluster was similar in the sugar fed cDNA library to those
in the post blood meal digestion cDNA library and most
transcripts are overrepresented in the blood fed library
(Table 17). Several exceptions to both overall observations do occur, however. Most of the microvillar protein
transcripts are abundant in the blood fed cDNA library
except for LuloMVP3, which is highly represented in the
sugar fed and post blood meal digestion cDNA libraries.
This reinforces the suggestion that the microvillar proteins
are likely functionally different molecules grouped solely
on homology to previously annotated sequences. In general, proteases appear to be induced by the act of blood
feeding or the presence of a blood meal within the midgut; with the exception of Lltryp2 which is significantly
more abundant in the sugar-fed and also in the post blood
meal digestion cDNA libraries and also LuloAstacin which
is more abundant in the sugar-fed cDNA library (Tables
17 and 18). These molecules may be produced and stored
prior to blood feeding for immediate use in digestion or
perhaps have a role other than digestion altogether, such
as immunity. Other proteases such as LuloChym4 and

LuloCpepA2 are present in higher or near equal numbers in
the sugar fed library when compared with that of the
blood fed library. Other molecules such as Peritrophin
LuloPer1 and LuloPer2, are also more plentiful in the blood
fed cDNA library, suggesting that these molecules may be
transcribed only in response to blood feeding. A transcript
encoding a predicted protein of unknown function
derived from cluster 40 was identified as being most
abundant in the post blood meal digestion cDNA library,

Transcripts differentially expressed by the presence of
Leishmania infantum chagasi
To evaluate the effects of the presence of L. infantum chagasi parasites on the transcript abundance in the midgut
tissue of the sand fly we compared the number of
sequences in each cluster between the blood fed and
blood fed Leishmania-infected cDNA library and the post
blood meal digestion and post blood meal digestion
Leishmania-infected cDNA library using chi-square analysis (Tables 19, 20, 21, 22). We hypothesized that the
effects of the parasites presence in the blood engorged
sand fly would likely mirror what we had observed in a
similar comparison of P. papatasi infected with L. major.
Additionally, we hypothesized that the analysis of the
post blood meal digestion midgut tissue would reveal a
large number of differentially abundant transcripts as during this time period Leishmania parasites are interacting
with the midgut epithelium, replicating, and differentiating to the metacyclic form. In accordance with what we
observed previously in blood engorged P. papatasi
infected with L. major, there was an under representation
of the microvillar protein transcripts [6]. Similar trends in
abundance between infected P. papatasi and infected L.
longipalpis also occur for transcripts encoding the putative
digestion enzymes trypsin (Lltryp2) and chymotrypsin
(LuloChym1A). Two other digestive proteases, LuloAstacin
and LuloCpepA1, were identified as differentially abundant in the presence of L. infantum chagasi with a reduction in the number of transcripts captured in the blood
fed Leishmania-infected library, however only the
LuloCpepA1 difference was statistically significant. There is
a striking contradiction of the modulated abundance of
peritrophin transcripts. In the midgut of infected P. papatasi peritrophin transcripts decrease whereas in L. longipalpis infected with L. infantum chagasi has a significant
over representation of peritrophin (LuloPer1) and over
representation of the putative chitin-binding molecule
(LuloChiBi). There appears to be a downregulation of actin
transcripts by the presence of the L. infantum chagasi para-

sites in the midgut. We speculate that this could be a tactic
of the parasite to decrease the cytoskeletal rearrangement
that occurs after blood feeding as a means of decreasing
peristalsis, which may aid in the retention of the parasite
within the gut of the sand fly.
In the context of abundant transcripts, the post blood
meal digestion midgut infected with L. infantum chagasi
is relatively quiescent. Only one transcript, encoding a

putative trypsin molecule, was identified as significantly
different in abundance. Lltryp2 sequences were 1.54 times
more abundant in the L. infantum chagasi-infected post
blood meal digestion cDNA library which corroborates
the observed overrepresentation of Lltryp2 sequences in
the blood fed infected cDNA library. It is possible that the
increase in sand fly Lltryp2 occurs due to the presence of
a perceived pathogen or as a consequence of a non-specific perception of contents within the midgut. Con-

Conclusion

capability of a comparative analysis between these cDNA
libraries. Several molecules were identified in this midgutspecific transcriptome that were not identified in the EST
database of whole sand fly sequences, including LuloKZL
and LuloDEF.

Leishmania parasites develop to a transmissible and infective form entirely within the confines of the alimentary
tract of the sand fly, in contrast to numerous other arthropod-borne pathogens. We wished to further investigate
the response of the sand fly midgut tissues that are occurring in response to blood meal ingestion and interactions
with Leishmania parasites. The previously reported extensive sequencing of whole sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis
ESTs provided a large overview of the transcripts present
in this vector; however, it did not provide information
regarding tissue specific transcripts, particularly from the
sand fly midgut or information regarding the midgut molecules which may be transcribed in response to blood
feeding and digestion or interact with the Leishmania parasite. In the present work, the production of five different
cDNA libraries generated a large number of redundant tissue specific transcripts for analysis as well as provided the

The present analysis of midgut tissue from L. longipalpis
further increases our knowledge of the molecular events
which occur throughout the adult lifecycle of the sand fly.
In general, it appears that the midgut reverts, after complete digestion and excretion of the blood meal, to a state
nearly mimicking the midgut of a sand fly that has only
taken a sugar meal. Comparing data generated from the
sugar fed and blood fed sand fly midguts resulted in comparable global changes found in the same analysis of the
midgut of P. papatasi [6]. Microvillar proteins, digestive
proteases and peritrophin molecules are some of the transcripts identified as differentially represented between
cDNA libraries when comparing unfed and blood fed
sand flies. Interestingly, many molecules, such as microvillar proteins and digestive proteases, were found to be
over or under represented when comparing the blood fed

with the blood fed Leishmania-infected cDNA libraries.
Similar results were observed in the midgut of P. papatasi
when infected with L. major. This not only demonstrates
the reproducibility of this technique of analyzing transcript abundance across cDNA libraries, but the redundancy present in the biology of blood feeding and
digestion in sand flies as well as the Leishmania-vector
interactions occurring between Old World and New
World sand fly species. When comparing the uninfected
and L. infantum chagasi-infected post blood meal digestion library we were astounded by the scarcity of differentially abundant transcripts when considering the number
and volume of Leishmania parasites present in the midgut
at the time points encompassed by the cDNA library. This
data suggest the Leishmania parasite affects the midgut
expression profile during the blood digestion process and
not afterwards. It is likely that Leishmania parasite modulates the expression profile of other molecules but our
approach was not able to detect these proteins probably
for their low abundance.

Further testing employing more direct techniques such as
real time PCR or other expression profiles approaches are
still required to test the hypothesis that L. infantum chagasi
is altering the expression of specific gut transcripts from
the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. However, the information presented on the current work and previous work on
P. papatasi and L. major strongly suggest that Leishmania
parasites can alter the expression of midgut transcripts
that may be relevant for the survival and establishment of
the parasite in the gut of the fly and that these changes
may be occurring during the digestion of the blood meal
and not afterwards.

Methods
Sand flies
Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies (Jacobina strain) were
maintained at the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector
Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases. Three to four-day post eclosion sand flies were
allowed a 20% sucrose solution (sugar fed/unfed) or fed
blood on anesthetized BALB/c mice (blood fed).

Leishmania and sand fly infection
L. longipalpis sand flies infected by an artificial blood meal
containing Leishmania infantum chagasi-infected macrophages (blood fed, infected) was based on the work of
Tesh and Modi [16]. Briefly, L. infantum chagasi MHOM/
BROO/MER/Strain 2 promastigote cultures were maintained in M199 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 20% (V\V) fetal bovine serum(FBS) (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 100 units/ml Penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml
Streptomycin, and 0.292 mg/ml Glutamine (PSG) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 25Â°C. Macrophage cell line
J774A.1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,
VA) was cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS and PSG at 37.0Â°C, 95% air, 5% CO2. At
confluency, the macrophages were scraped from the culture flask and washed twice by centrifugation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 380 Ã g for 10 minutes
before resuspension in culture media. The washed macrophages were then placed in 5 wells of a 24-well culture

plate at a concentration of 2 Ã 106 cells/ml and allowed to
adhere for 90 minutes at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. Stationary-phase
L. infantum chagasi culture was washed by centrifugation
in PBS at 1200 Ã g for 15 minutes and resuspended in
macrophage culture media. Nonadherent macrophages
were removed by the replacement of the culture media
and Leishmania parasites in macrophage added at a 5:1
ratio of parasite to macrophage. The parasites were co-cultured with the macrophages for 5 hours at 26Â°C. The culture was then washed to remove extracellular parasites
and the macrophages scraped from the wells. Macrophages were confirmed to contain intracellular amastigotes by staining with QUICK III (Astral Diagnostics, Inc.,
West Deptford, NJ) according to the manufacture's protocol and visualized by light microscopy. The infected macrophage culture was centrifuged at 380 Ã g for 10 minutes
and resuspended in 500 Î¼l fresh whole mouse blood collected in heparin. The blood containing amastigoteinfected macrophages were used for artificial blood feeding of sand flies as described [17].
cDNA library construction
The conditions of the Lutzomyia longipalpis midguts harvested for the construction of the five cDNA libraries
included: unfed/sugar fed four-day post-eclosion female
midguts; midguts containing blood 1, 2, and 3 days post
blood meal from female flies allowed to feed on BALB/c
mice; midguts containing blood 1, 2, and 3 days post
blood meal from female flies allowed an artificial blood
meal containing L. infantum chagasi infected macrophages; midguts devoid of blood 5, 6, and 7 days post
blood meal from gravid flies allowed to feed on BALB/c
mice; midguts devoid of blood 5, 6, and 7 days post blood
meal from gravid flies allowed an artificial blood meal
containing L. infantum chagasi infected macrophages. All
midguts used for the construction of cDNA libraries containing infected sand fly midguts were verified by microscopy as carrying Leishmania parasite infections
comparable to mature infections seen in sand flies that are

used routinely in transmission experiments. L. longipalpis
midguts were dissected in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and placed in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) and stored at 4Â°C prior to cDNA library construction. Libraries constructed using midguts at different time
points consisted of two midguts at each day the midguts
were dissected. L. longipalpis midgut mRNA was isolated
from six midguts using the MicroFastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cDNA libraries
were constructed using the SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) as described
previously [18].
DNA Sequencing
Phage plaques lacking Î²-galactosidase activity were picked
from the soft top agar using a sterilized wooden stick and
placed into 75 Î¼l of ultrapure water in a 96-well v-bottom
plate. PCR was used to amplify the cDNA insert from 3 Î¼l
of the phage in water using FastStart PCR Master premixed
PCR reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
and primers PT2F1 (AAGTACTCTAGCAATTGTGAGC)
and PT2R1 (CTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAGCTG). Reaction
conditions were 75Â°C, 3 min; 94Â°C, 4 min; 33 cycles of
94Â°C, 1 min; 49Â°C, 1 min; 72Â°C 2 min; a final extension
of 72Â°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products were cleaned of

buffering salts, dNTPs, and primers using ExcelaPure 96well UF PCR purification plates (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) using three washes of 100 Î¼l of ultrapure
water and recovery in 30 Î¼l of ultrapure water. Cycle
sequencing was accomplished using in a reaction using
BigDye Terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA), primer PT2F3 (TCTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATTGT),
and 5 Î¼l of the cleaned PCR product. The cycle sequencing
products were prepared for sequencing by centrifugation
through hydrated Sephadex G-50 (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ), desiccation, and rehydration with 10 Î¼l
sequencing buffer. Sequencing was performed using a
3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA).
Bioinformatics
Detailed reports of the bioinformatic analysis of the data
are previously reported [19,20]. Succinctly, high N (unidentified nucleotide) content was removed at the 5' and 3'
ends of each sequence any primer and vector nucleotides
removed. Sequences from all five libraries were combined
and contigs constructed from the clustering of homologous sequences based on 100% identity over 64 nucleotides while sequences with greater than 5% N's were
discarded. Three frame translated sequences were sup-

plied to the appropriate BLAST algorithm for comparison
to the contents of the NCBI non-redundant protein database, the Gene Ontology database [21], the conserved
domain database [22] which contains the eukaryotic clusters of orthologous groups (COG), Simple Modular Architecture Tool (SMART) and Protein Family Database
(Pfam)[23,24]. Customized databases of mitochondrial
and ribosomal RNA nucleotide sequences were also used
for the comparison of cDNA sequences. The predicted
presence of a signal secretion peptide or transmembrane
helices was determined using the SignalP [25]or TMHMM
server [26], respectively. A custom program, Count Libraries, was used to identify the number of transcripts that
each library contributed to the formation of a contig (JMC
Ribeiro). The contigs, information regarding each contig,
the BLAST and SignalP results were combined in a hyperlinked Excel spreadsheet and each contig annotated by
manually assigning the most likely predicted function
based on BLAST results. Sequences were aligned using
Clustal X, version 1.83, and converted to graphical aligned
sequences using BioEdit, version 7.0.5.3[27]. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on amino acid alignments
using TREE-PUZZLE, version 5.2, generating trees by maximum likelihood using quartet puzzling with 10,000 puzzling steps to calculate node support [28]. Statistical
significance in the number of transcripts per cluster within
that same cluster, between cDNA libraries, was analyzed
using Pearson's Chi-square test.
