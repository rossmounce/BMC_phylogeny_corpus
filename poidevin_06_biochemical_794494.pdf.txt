Abstract
Background: DNA ligases are required for DNA strand joining in all forms of cellular life. NAD+dependent DNA ligases are found primarily in eubacteria but also in some eukaryotic viruses,
bacteriophage and archaea. Among the archaeal NAD+-dependent DNA ligases is the LigN enzyme
of the halophilic euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, the gene for which was apparently acquired by
Hfx.volcanii through lateral gene transfer (LGT) from a halophilic eubacterium. Genetic studies
show that the LGT-acquired LigN enzyme shares an essential function with the native Hfx.volcanii
ATP-dependent DNA ligase protein LigA.
Results: To characterise the enzymatic properties of the LigN protein, wild-type and three mutant
forms of the LigN protein were separately expressed in recombinant form in E.coli and purified to
apparent homogeneity by immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). Non-isotopic
DNA ligase activity assays using λ DNA restriction fragments with 12 bp cos cohesive ends were
used to show that LigN activity was dependent on addition of divalent cations and salt. No activity
was detected in the absence of KCl, whereas maximum activity could be detected at 3.2 M KCl,
close to the intracellular KCl concentration of Hfx.volcanii cells.
Conclusion: LigN is unique amongst characterised DNA ligase enzymes in displaying maximal
DNA strand joining activity at high (> 3 M) salt levels. As such the LigN enzyme has potential both
as a novel tool for biotechnology and as a model enzyme for studying the adaptation of proteins to
high intracellular salt levels.

Background
DNA ligases play key roles in all forms of cellular life [1].
Two families of DNA ligase, differing in their cofactor specificity, are characteristic of the two major branches of
evolution, the eubacteria and the eukarya/archaea. NAD+dependent DNA ligases (EC 6.5.1.2) are encoded predominantly by eubacteria [2] but also by certain eukaryotic

viruses, such as the entomopoxviruses [3] and mimiviruses [4], and by some bacteriophage [5,6]. In contrast,
ATP-dependent DNA ligases (EC 6.5.1.1) are characteristic of eukaryotic and archaeal cells but are also found
encoded by certain eukaryotic viruses, bacteriophage and
eubacteria [7]. The mechanism of DNA ligation is similar
for both types of enzyme [1]. In the first step, attack on the

α-phosphorus of either NAD+ or ATP by the enzyme
results in formation of an enzyme-adenylate intermediate
(AMP is covalently linked to a lysine residue) and release
of either NMP or pyrophosphate. In the second step, the
AMP moiety is transferred to the 5' end of the nicked DNA
strand to form a DNA-adenylate complex. Finally, attack
by the 3'OH group of the nicked DNA strand on the DNAadenylate, catalysed by the enzyme, results in DNA strand
joining and AMP release [1].
The euryarchaeal organism Haloferax volcanii is a halophile that was originally isolated in samples taken from
the Dead Sea [8]. The organism grows aerobically with an
optimal temperature of 45°C in medium containing 20%
NaCl. Previously, this organism was shown to encode
both ATP- and NAD+-dependent DNA ligase enzymes,
designated LigA and LigN respectively [9]. Protein
sequence analysis indicated that the gene encoding the
LigN enzyme had been acquired by LGT from a eubacterium. At the sequence level, LigN closely resembles an
archetypal eubacterial NAD+-dependent ligase enzyme
[10]: it possesses a core ligase domain that is made up of
adenylation and OB-fold sub-domains and which is
flanked on the N-terminal side by a putative NAD+-recognition domain (domain 1a) and on the C-terminal side by
a C4 zinc finger motif, a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)
domain and a BRCT domain (see Figure 1A). Genetic
analysis showed that neither of the genes encoding the
LigA or LigN enzymes is essential for Hfx.volcanii cell viability, but simultaneous deletion of both is lethal, indicating that the two enzymes, native and acquired, share at
least one essential function, presumably the ligation of
Okazaki fragments during chromosomal DNA replication
[9].
Two different strategies allow halophilic organisms to
cope in high salt environments [11,12]. The most widespread, seen in most aerobic halophilic eubacteria as well
as in halophilic archaeal methanogens, involves the synthesis or accumulation of high intracellular levels of low
molecular weight organic osmotic solutes, so-called compatible solutes, such as trehalose, betaine or proline
[11,12]. Intracellular salt levels are kept to a minimum by
active pumping of ions out of cells, so ensuring that the
cells' enzymes, which are not salt-adapted, can function
normally.
The alternative strategy is to accumulate high intracellular
concentrations of KCl, to balance the concentrations of
NaCl and other salts present in the extracellular environment [11,12]. This strategy is used by halophilic archaea
of the order Halobacteriales, such as Hfx.volcanii, Halobacterium salinarum and Haloarcula marismortui, as well as
eubacteria such as Salinibacter ruber [13-15] or members
of the anaerobic order Haloanaerobiales [16]. In the case of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/44

Hfx.volcanii, the intracellular KCl concentration has been
measured as 3.6 M [17]. Not surprisingly, the presence of
such high intercellular salt levels has greatly influenced
protein sequence and enzyme mechanism in these organisms. One such adaptation is reflected in the amino acid
composition of proteins expressed in halophilic archaea.
These are enriched in the acidic amino acids, glutamic
acid and aspartic acid, and are reduced in basic and hydrophobic amino acids. These modifications are presumably
required to maintain protein solubility, stability and function in high salt. Likely mechanisms for this have been
discussed elsewhere [18].
Here we report biochemical analysis of the properties of
the NAD+-dependent DNA ligase LigN from Hfx.volcanii.
Using a non-isotopic DNA ligase assay based on λ DNA
[19] we show that LigN enzyme has no activity in the
absence of added KCl and increasing activity up to KCl
concentrations greater than 3 M. LigN is the first DNA
ligase enzyme to be characterised with such extreme salt
tolerance.

Results
Expression and purification of recombinant LigN proteins
Hfx.volcanii LigN was expressed in E.coli from the kanamycin-resistant plasmid pET47b-HfxLigN as described previously [9]. To facilitate protein purification, the
recombinant LigN protein carries an N-terminal hexahistidine tag as part of a 20 amino acid leader sequence that
also contains a cleavage site for the HRV 3C protease,
although the latter was not used in this study. Two additional expression vectors were constructed by introducing
mutations into the LigN coding region by PCR overlap
extension mutagenesis (see Methods). The resulting proteins differed from the wild-type in having either lysine
139 (mutant LigN-K139A) or aspartate 141 (mutant LigND141A) replaced with alanine. These amino acids are
located within the adenylation domain of the enzyme in
conserved ligase motif I (Figure 1A).

Protein expression was performed in E.coli Rosetta 2
(DE3) [pLysS]. This strain carries the pACYC184-derived
chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid pRARE2 that harbors
genes encoding tRNAs for the codons AUA, AGG, AGA,
CUA, CCC, GGA and CGG, to enhance translation of nonnative proteins where this would otherwise be limited by
the codon usage of E.coli (note that the ligN+ ORF has a
GC content of 70%), as well as genes encoding T7 lysozyme and the lac repressor. The strain is also lysogenic
for the λ DE3 prophage that contains the T7 RNA
polymerase gene under the control of the IPTG-inducible
lacUV5 promoter (see Methods).
Cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37°C for 4
hours. All three proteins were expressed in soluble form

and could be purified to apparent homogeneity by NiNTA affinity chromatography in buffers containing 2 M
KCl. Figure 1B shows the purified proteins. All three proteins migrate with an apparent molecular weight of ~100
kDa, significantly slower than would be expected from the
predicted molecular weight of the proteins (75.8 kDa).
This property is shared by many halophilic proteins and
has been attributed to the high charge on the protein surface [12]. Slight differences in the mobility of the three
proteins in relation to one another (see Figure 1B) can be
attributed to the K139A and D141A amino acid substitutions and perhaps also to adenylation state of the recombinant proteins (see below).
Adenylation assay
As described above, the first step of the ligation reaction
requires that the ligase enzyme becomes adenylated to
form a covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate [2]. Adenylation takes place on a conserved lysine residue in the
motif I sequence KxDG. In the Hfx.volcanii LigN sequence,
this crucial catalytic residue is lysine 139. In other NAD+dependent DNA ligases, the aspartate residue in motif I
(equivalent to aspartate 141 in LigN) is generally not
required for adenylation but is required for subsequent
steps [2].

Previously we showed that the recombinant LigN protein
could be adenylated in vitro by [32P]NAD+ but not [α32P]ATP [9]. Under the conditions used, approximately
65% of the LigN molecules became adenylated in the in
vitro assay (data not shown). To examine the roles of
lysine 139 and aspartate 141, we tested the ability of the
two mutant proteins, LigN-K139A and LigN-D141A to be
adenylated by [32P]NAD+. We found that both mutations
reduced incorporation of radiolabel into LigN by > 99%
(Figure 1C and data not shown, see also Discussion).
Non-isotopic DNA ligase assay
To assay the ligation activity of the recombinant LigN protein, bacteriophage λ DNA digested with the restriction
endonuclease BstEII was used as a substrate in assays performed according to the method developed by Muerhoff
and colleagues to measure the activity of the NAD+dependent ligase from Thermus thermophilus [19]. Digestion of λ DNA with BstEII produces fourteen DNA fragments ranging in size from 702 to 8454 bp. Fragments 1
and 4 (8454 and 5686 bp respectively) have 12 bp cohesive ends that are stably annealed and can therefore act as
the substrate in a ligation reaction performed at 45°C, the
optimal growth temperature of Hfx.volcanii. Following the
ligation reaction, separation of the ligated 14 kb product
from non-ligated substrate fragments is accomplished by
ethidium bromide staining and agarose gel electrophoresis [19]. Imaging software is used to quantify the amount
of product formed (see Methods).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/44

Initially, the activity of the recombinant LigN protein was
assayed at 45°C under conditions optimised for the commercially-available NAD+-dependent ligase from Thermus
aquaticus (Taq DNA ligase) but supplemented by addition
of KCl to a final concentration of 2.5 M. Figure 1D shows
the results of this assay. LigN activity was readily detectable, with the product quantity reaching a maximum by 7.5
minutes (Figure 1D, lanes 1–5). Under these conditions,
~90% of the input substrate DNA was converted to product; longer incubations periods did not result in an
increase in product amount (data not shown). As predicted, no activity could be detected with either of the adenylation-defective mutants LigN-K139A or LigN-D141A
(Figure 1D, lanes 6 and 7 respectively). This is the first
time that ligase activity has been demonstrated for the
LigN protein and the first time that DNA ligase activity has
been observed at such high salt concentrations.
As part of a separate study motivated by the discovery of a
split NAD+-dependent DNA ligase encoded by bacteriophage T5 [5], we also expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated form of the LigN protein comprising only
domain 1a and the adenylation and OB fold domains
(amino acids 1–417, see Figure 1A). This protein (LigN∆C) was expressed in soluble form and could be purified
to apparent homogeneity on Ni-NTA agarose (Figure 1E).
Incubation of the LigN-∆C protein with [32P]NAD+
resulted in formation of an enzyme-adenylate complex at
similar efficiency to the full-length LigN protein (Figure
1F). That the C-terminal region of the protein encompassing the ZnF, HhH and BRCT domains is not required for
formation of the enzyme-adenylate complex is consistent
with results obtained with other NAD+-dependent DNA
ligase enzymes of eubacterial and viral origin [3,20-22].
However, despite being efficiently adenylated, the LigN∆C protein was inactive in ligase assays using the λ BstEII
substrate (Figure 1G). This result indicates that the region
of the protein encompassing the ZnF, HhH and BRCT
domains plays an important role in overall LigN function
in one or more steps subsequent to enzyme adenylation.
Again, similar results have been seen with other NAD+dependent DNA ligases [3,20-22]. Unfortunately, the Cterminal part of LigN comprising the ZnF, HhH and BRCT
domains could not be stably expressed in E.coli, either
alone or in combination with LigN-∆C, and so prevented
our attempts to reconstitute enzyme activity from two separate polypeptides (data not shown).
LigN is active at high salt concentrations
As noted above, the intracellular KCl concentration of
Hfx.volcanii cells has been determined as 3.6 M [17].
Using the non-isotopic method described above [19], we
tested the activity of LigN at KCl concentrations increasing
from 0 to 3.2 M at 400 mM intervals. No activity could be
detected in the absence of added KCl or in the presence of

BMC Molecular Biology 2006, 7:44

either 0.4 M or 0.8 M KCl (Figure 2A, lanes 1–3 respectively). LigN activity was first detected at 1.2 M KCl and
increased to a maximum at the highest KCl concentration
tested, 3.2 M (Figure 2A, lanes 4–9). The quantitative data
shown in Figure 2A might suggest that LigN activity would
be higher still at KCl concentrations above 3.2 M but for
technical reasons this could not be tested.
To investigate whether KCl specifically was required for
LigN activity, similar assays were performed using 3.2 M
NaCl, 3.2 M potassium acetate and 3.2 M sodium acetate.
The results are shown in Figure 2B. LigN activity was highest with 3.2 M KCl (lane 1), reduced with 3.2 M potassium
acetate and 3.2 M sodium acetate (lanes 3 and 4 respectively) and greatly reduced with 3.2 M NaCl (lane 2).
Additional properties of the LigN enzyme
A general feature of the NAD+-dependent ligases is a
requirement for a divalent cation for catalysis [2]. Figure
2C shows that this is also true of LigN, since in the absence
of a divalent cation, the enzyme is inactive on the λ DNA
substrate (Figure 2C, lane 2). The requirement for a divalent cation can be satisfied by 10 mM magnesium or manganese (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), to a much lesser
extent by calcium (lane 5) but not by cobalt, nickel or zinc
(lanes 6–8).

We also examined temperature and pH dependence for
LigN activity in 3.2 M KCl. Figure 3A shows the results of
assaying LigN activity at a range of temperatures, from 40
to 55°C, while Figure 3B shows the activity of LigN protein that had been preincubated at 45°C, 55°C, 65°C or
75°C for 30 minutes prior to assaying ligase activity at
45°C. The LigN protein was active over a range of temperatures up to 55°C, significantly higher than the optimum
growth temperature of the organism (45°C). Preincubation at temperatures above 45°C resulted in some loss of
activity but even after 30 minutes at 75°C, the amount of
product formed was reduced by only 40% compared to
enzyme that had been preincubated at 45°C. Thus, LigN
is a relatively thermostable enzyme. We also found that
activity of the enzyme was essentially unchanged over a
pH range from 6.8 to 8.8 (data not shown).
To confirm that LigN was NAD+-dependent, assays were
performed in the absence of the cofactor. We found that
the LigN activity was dependent upon the addition of
NAD+, as expected, but only when the enzyme was present
at concentrations significantly lower than the substrate
concentration (Figure 3C, lanes 5 and 10). When enzyme
concentration equalled or exceeded the substrate concentration (lanes 1–4, 6–9), it was not necessary to add additional NAD+ for efficient ligation, presumably because a
significant proportion of the enzyme purified from E.coli
is in the adenylated state, as observed with other purified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/44

recombinant DNA ligases, and one round of nick-sealing
is possible.

Discussion
Since their discovery in the late 1960's [23-27], DNA
ligases have been identified and biochemically characterised from a wide variety of cellular organisms and viruses
from all three domains of life [1,28]. In this paper we
describe the first biochemical analysis of a DNA ligase,
LigN, from an extreme halophilic microorganism, the euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. First isolated from the Dead
Sea [8], Hfx.volcanii can be easily grown in the laboratory
in medium containing 2.5 M NaCl and has attracted
attention as a model system for genetic studies of archaeal
cell function [29]. By using available genetic tools, we previously showed that LigN was non-essential for Hfx.volcanii cell viability but that the enzyme shared an essential
function with the archetypal archaeal ATP-dependent
ligase LigA [9]. By analogy with other systems, this essential function is most likely to be ligation of the Okazaki
fragments generated during chromosome replication.
In common with other haloarchaeal organisms [11,12],
Hfx.volcanii cells balance the high salt of the extracellular
environment by accumulating high intracellular concentrations of potassium chloride, estimated at up to 3.6 M in
the case of Hfx.volcanii [17]. The success of this strategy
obviously requires that Hfx.volcanii proteins are active at
such extreme salt concentrations. We show here that the
Hfx.volcanii NAD+-dependent DNA ligase family member
LigN is inactive in the absence of KCl and displays increasing activity at least up to 3.2 M (Figure 2A), close to the
measured intracellular KCl concentration [17]. Using the
data from the experiment shown in Figure 3C, it was possible to estimate the specific activity of the recombinant
LigN enzyme: in reactions containing 1 mM NAD+, 1 fmol
of LigN was capable of ligating 9.5 fmol of substrate 5' termini in 300 minutes at 45°C. High activity was also seen
when potassium acetate or sodium acetate was substituted
for KCl, but not when NaCl was used (Figure 2B), and was
shown also to be dependent on the presence of a divalent
cation (either magnesium or manganese, Figure 2C) and
NAD+ (Figure 3C).
Mutation of the presumptive adenylated lysine, lysine
139, prevented adenylation of the enzyme and subsequent ligation activity (Figure 1C, 1D) while removal of
the zinc-binding, helix-hairpin-helix and BRCT domains
did not affect adenylation but did prevent ligation (Figure
1F, 1G). Adenylation of the enzyme was also prevented
when aspartate 141 was mutated to alanine (Figure 1C),
suggesting that the structural change that results from loss
of aspartate 141 is sufficient to prevent either NAD+ binding or the adenyltransferase reaction from taking place.

In an earlier study, we investigated the evolutionary origins of the gene encoding the LigN protein using a dataset
of ~80 eubacterial NAD+-dependent ligases [9]. Since that
analysis was published, two additional archaeal NAD+dependent ligases have been identified by genomic and
metagenomic sequencing projects. The first of these is
encoded by Haloquadratum walsbyi[30]. This protein,
which has been designated HQ3698A [31], is closely
related to previously-identified haloarchaeal LigN proteins at the primary sequence level (Table 1). Including
the sequence of the H.walsbyi protein in phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 4) does not alter the conclusion that the
gene encoding LigN was most likely acquired by a common ancestor of the four haloarchaeal species from a δproteobacterial organism [9].
NAD+-dependent

ligase is
The second potential new
encoded by a fosmid clone (designated HF70_B12) from
an uncultured marine archaeon isolated from a depth of
70 m in the North Pacific [32]. The fosmid carries genes
encoding archaeal-type RNA polymerase and ribosome
subunits, amongst others; the sequences of these protein
are suggestive of a euryarchaeal origin for the fosmid [32].
The overall predicted domain structure of the HF70_B12
encoded enzyme (referred to here as the HF70 ligase) is
similar to that of other NAD+-dependent ligases including
LigN (see Figure 1A) and all the residues predicted to be
required for catalysis are present in its primary sequence
(data not shown). However, the HF70 ligase is only distantly related to the haloarchaeal enzymes (Table 1).
Instead, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the HF70
enzyme is most closely related (typical pairwise protein
sequence identities of ~45%) to NAD+-dependent ligases
from spirochaete eubacteria, represented in the database
by two species of each of the genera Borrelia and
Treponema and a single species of the genus Leptospira (Figure 4). Thus, the gene encoding the HF70 was almost certainly acquired by an LGT event distinct from that that
introduced the gene encoding LigN to the haloarchaea.

Beneficial lateral gene transfer presumably requires that
the donor and recipient of the transferred information
occupy the same environmental niche. This is an obvious
requirement in the case of the halophilic microbes whose
proteins are highly salt-adapted. However, many of the
sequenced archaeal genomes are from species (such as
extreme hyperthermophiles) that do not appear to share
their extreme habitats with eubacterial organisms, significantly restricting the opportunities for cross-domain gene
transfer. In contrast, marine ecosystems contain an abundance of both eubacterial and archaeal organisms [32].
With this in mind, it seems highly likely that additional
cases of LGT of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases will be
found in marine archaea in the future.
To complement our phylogenetic analysis of the NAD+dependent enzymes, we undertook a related investigation
of the ATP-dependent DNA ligases encoded by archaeal
organisms. A total of 41 proteins were identified from 37
species by database searching, including one enzyme
encoded by a fosmid (designated 74A4) derived from an
uncultured marine crenarchaeon [33] and one encoded
by a fosmid (C03G11) derived from Cenarchaeum symbiosum, an uncultured crenarchaeon that lives in a highly specific symbiotic association with a marine sponge [34].
Figure 5 shows a phylogenetic tree based on multiple
sequence alignments of the 41 proteins. A single eubacterial ATP-dependent DNA ligase enzyme (from Aquifex
aeolicus) is also included, as discussed below.
Several features of this tree of worthy of comment. Firstly,
there is no clear branching of the tree that separates
enzymes from euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal organisms.
Four enzymes, from the euryarchaeal species T.volcanium,
T.acidophilum, P.torridus and F.acidarmanus, appear more
closely related to crenarchaeal rather than euryarcheal
enzymes (Figure 5). It is possible that a common ancestor
of these four species acquired an ATP+-dependent ligase
from a crenarchaeal organism and then proceeded to lose
the gene encoding its own euryarchaeal-type ATP+dependent DNA ligase. Secondly, four euryarchaeal species have the capacity to encode two ATP-dependent DNA
ligase enzymes: the newly-sequenced haloarchaeon
H.walsbyi and three members of the genus Methanosarcina.
The former is unique amongst sequenced archaea in having the ability to encode three distinct DNA ligase
enzymes: two ATP-dependent enzymes (HQ2327A and
HQ2659A, see HaloLex [31] database) and one eubacterial-type NAD+-dependent enzyme (HQ3698A, discussed
above). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that one of the
two H.walsbyi ATP-dependent enzymes (HQ2659A, indicated as Hqw 1 in Figure 5) is most closely related to ATPdependent ligase enzymes from the other sequenced
haloarchaeal organisms (see Table 2), suggesting that this
enzyme is native to the organism, while the other

(HQ2327A, indicated as Hqw 2) is most similar to that of
the hyperthermophilic obligate symbiont Nanoarchaeum
equitans (Figure 5), suggesting an LGT origin for the corresponding gene. Similarly, one of the two enzymes
encoded by each of the three Methanosarcina species (designated Mba 1, Mac 1 and Mma 1 in Figure 5) is closely
related to the sole ATP-dependent ligase seen in the
related Methanococcoides and Methanosaeta species, while
the other (designated Mba 2, Mac 2 and Mma 2 in Figure
5) is more closely related to the crenarchaeal enzymes.
Again, LGT is likely to have played a major role in the
transfer of ligase genes from organism to organism within
the archaea and between the archaea and the eubacteria.
Database searching reveals genes encoding putative ATPdependent DNA ligases are present in many eubacterial
species [35]. Biochemical and genetic analysis has demonstrated that the encoded proteins can have important
functions in the repair of DNA damage [36] as well as in
the mechanism of genome circularisation employed by
certain bacteriophage [37]. While a detailed analysis of
the evolutionary origins of the members of this diverse
group of enzymes lies outside the scope of this report, the
enzyme encoded by the hyperthermophilic eubacterium
Aquifex aeolicus is worthy of comment. This DNA ligase is
most closely related to enzymes encoded by hyperthermophilic crenarchaeal organisms such as Acidianus ambivalens, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Aeropyrum pernix and
Pyrobaculum aerophilum (Figure 5). In each case, the protein sequence identity is ~50% (Table 3), suggesting that
acquisition of the gene by A.aeolicus by LGT was a relatively recent event.

Conclusion
The results reported here represent the first biochemical
analysis of a DNA ligase enzyme derived from an
extremely halophilic organism. Hfx.volcanii LigN enzyme
activity is completely dependent upon addition of salt
and is optimal at concentrations of 3.2 M or higher, consistent with the measured intracellular KCl concentration
of Hfx.volcanii cells. LigN has great potential both as a
novel tool for biotechnology and as a model enzyme for

studying adaptation of proteins to high intracellular salt
levels.

Methods
Bacterial strains and media
For routine cloning procedures, E.coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used. Recombinant protein expression was carried out using E.coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) [pLysS] (Novagen).
LB medium [38] was used throughout, with appropriate
antibiotic supplements to select for plasmids. Antibiotics
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Molecular biological and biochemical reagents
Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Taq DNA ligase
buffer and BstEII-digested λ DNA were obtained from
New England Biolabs, [32P]NAD+ from GE Healthcare,
and oligonucleotides from DNA Technology A/S. All
other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Amplification of Hfx.volcanii DNA was accomplished
using the GC-rich PCR system (Roche Applied Science).
DNA sequencing was performed in-house using
DYEnamic ET dye terminator reagent (GC Biotech) and
an ABI 310 Gene Analyzer. Plasmid DNA was prepared
using either of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep or QIAfilter
Plasmid Midi kits (Qiagen). DNA fragment purification
was accomplished using various MinElute DNA purification kits (Qiagen).
LigN expression plasmids
Plasmid pET47b-HfxLigN has been described previously
[9]. For expression of LigN-K139A and LigN-D141A, the
ligN+ insert in this plasmid was modified using the PCR
overlap extension mutagenesis technique [38]. With
pET47b-HfxLigN as the template, PCR products were generated using oligonucleotide pairs K1 (specifically oligos
PET47B-5SEQ and HVOLIGN-KR, see Table 4) and D1
(PET47B-5SEQ and HVOLIGN-DR), combined with the
products generated using pairs K2 (HVOLIGN-PCR-1R
and HVOLIGN-KF) and D2 (HVOLIGN-PCR-1R and
HVOLIGN-DF) respectively, and subjected to further
amplification using the flanking primers PET47B-5SEQ
and HVOLIGN-PCR-1R only. The final ~950 bp PCR

product was then restricted with XmaI and BglI and the
500 bp fragment containing the mutated region re-cloned
into pET47b-HfxLigN from which the corresponding nonmutated XmaI- BglI region had been removed. The resulting plasmids (pET47b-HfxLigN-K139A and pET47b-HfxLigN-D141A) were sequenced to confirm the success of
the mutagenesis procedure and the absence of unwanted
sequence changes.
For expression of LigN-∆C, a ~1300 bp region of the ligN+
gene, corresponding to sequences encoding amino acids
1–417, was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides
HVOLIGN-N-5BAM and HVOLIGN-N-3H (see Table 4),
restricted with BamHI and HindIII, and cloned into plasmid pETDuet-1 (Novagen) that had been digested with
the same enzymes. Again, the resulting plasmid (pETDuet-1-HfxLigN-∆C) was sequenced to confirm the
absence of unwanted sequence changes.
Expression and purification of recombinant LigN proteins
1 litre cultures of E.coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) [pLysS] (Novagen) cells transformed with either pET47b-HfxLigN plasmids or pETDuet-1-HfxLigN-∆C were grown with shaking
at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 µg/ml) and either kanamycin (25 µg/ml, for
pET47b plasmids) or ampicillin (100 µg/ml, for pETDuet1-HfxLigN-∆C) to an OD600nm of 0.6, at which point IPTG

was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and growth
continued for a further 4 hours at 37°C. Cells were then
harvested by centrifugation in a pre-chilled Sorvall GS-3
rotor (4°C, 6000 g, 10 minutes) and pellets stored at 20°C overnight. The cell pellets were then thawed at room
temperature for 30 minutes, resuspended in 20 ml of
buffer 1 (20 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM imidazole, 2.0 M KCl,
0.1% Igepal CA-630, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication (on
ice, using six 10 second pulses at 10% power output with
15 second rest periods on a 200 W, 20 kHz Bandelin
Sonopuls HD2200 sonicator). The lysate was then centrifuged in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor (4°C, 27000 g, 10 minutes
× 4) and the cleared supernatant applied to a 1.5 ml
NiNTA Superflow column (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed five
times with 10 ml of buffer 2 (20 mM NaH2PO4, 2.0 M
KCl, pH 8.0) and the bound proteins then eluted with five
2 ml aliquots of ice-cold buffer 3 (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500
mM imidazole, 2.0 M KCl, pH 8.0). 500 µl fractions were
collected and analysed by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions (generally 3–4 fractions were selected) were pooled and dialysed overnight against 2 litres of buffer 2 at room
temperature with stirring. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Purified proteins were then stored at 4°C. The yield from 1 litre of culture was ~8 mg. The purified proteins appeared essentially
homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (see Figures 1B, 1E).

Adenyltransferase activity assays
Reaction mixtures (20 µl) contained 20 mM NaH2PO4, 10
mM MgCl2, 2.0 M KCl, pH 8.0, 1 µM [32P] NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine [adenylate-32P] dinucleotide, from GE
Healthcare) and 10 pmol of ligase protein. After incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes, the reaction was
desalted using a Zeba desalt spin column (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 µl of 2× SDS
PAGE sample buffer was then added and the reaction
heated to 95°C for 5 minutes prior to 10% SDS-PAGE.
Dried gels were then exposed to BioMax XAR film (Kodak)
at -20°C. Quantitation was achieved using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System and OptiQuant software (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Ligase assays
DNA ligase assays were performed according to the
method of Muerhoff et al. [19] with minor modifications.
Unless otherwise stated, standard reactions (20 µl) contained 6.4 pmol (0.5 µg) of LigN in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.6 at 25°C), 3.2 M KCl, 25 mM potassium acetate, 10
mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM NAD+, 0.1%
Triton X100 and 500 ng of BstEII-digested λ DNA (New
England Biolabs) and were performed at 45°C for 10
minutes. Reactions were stopped by addition of 4.0 µl of
50 mM EDTA. The samples were then desalted using the
MinElute reaction clean-up kit (Qiagen), according to the
manufacturer's instructions, eluted in 22 µl of EB buffer
(10 mM Tris pH 8.0), heated to 65°C for 5 minutes and
chilled on ice for 5 minutes prior to loading onto a 1%
agarose gel prepared in 1 × TAE buffer. The gel was run at
120 V for 120 minutes. Both the gel and the buffer contained 175 ng/ml ethidium bromide. Band intensities
were determined by measuring UV fluorescence using 1D
Image Analysis software (Kodak) with exposure times
maximised to give high band intensity without pixel saturation. Activity values were calculated by measuring the
net intensity of the product band (indicated as 1+4 in the
figures) relative to a non-substrate fragment (fragment 7).

Authors' contributions
LP performed most of the biochemical work and prepared
some of the expression plasmids. SM conceived of the
study, prepared the remaining plasmids, performed some
of the biochemical experiments, analysed the data and
wrote the manuscript. Both authors read and approved
the final manuscript.
