Abstract
Background: Avoidance of noxious stimuli is essential for the survival of an animal in its natural
habitat. Some avoidance responses require polymodal sensory neurons, which sense a range of
diverse stimuli, whereas other stimuli require a unimodal sensory neuron, which senses a single
stimulus. Polymodality might have evolved to help animals quickly detect and respond to diverse
noxious stimuli. Nematodes inhabit diverse habitats and most nematode nervous systems are
composed of a small number of neurons, despite a wide assortment in nematode sizes. Given this
observation, we speculated that cellular contribution to stereotyped avoidance behaviors would
also be conserved between nematode species. The ASH neuron mediates avoidance of three
classes of noxious stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans. Two species of parasitic nematodes also utilize
the ASH neuron to avoid certain stimuli. We wanted to extend our knowledge of avoidance
behaviors by comparing multiple stimuli in a set of free-living nematode species.
Results: We used comparative behavioral analysis and laser microsurgery to examine three
avoidance behaviors in six diverse species of free-living nematodes. We found that all species tested
exhibit avoidance of chemo-, mechano- and osmosensory stimuli. In C. elegans, the bilaterally
symmetric polymodal ASH neurons detect all three classes of repellant. We identified the putative
ASH neurons in different nematode species by their anatomical positions and showed that in all six
species ablation of the ASH neurons resulted in an inability to avoid noxious stimuli. However, in
the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, the ADL neuron in addition to the ASH neuron contributed to
osmosensation. In the species Caenorhabditis sp. 3, only the ASH neuron was required to mediate
nose touch avoidance instead of three neurons in C. elegans. These data suggest that different
species can increase or decrease the contribution of additional, non-ASH sensory neurons
mediating osmosensation and mechanosensation.
Conclusion: The overall conservation of ASH mediated polymodal nociception suggests that it is
an ancestral evolutionarily stable feature of sensation. However, the finding that contribution from
non-ASH sensory neurons mediates polymodal nociception in some nematode species suggests
that even in conserved sensory behaviors, the cellular response network is dynamic over
evolutionary time, perhaps shaped by adaptation of each species to its environment.

Background
Despite a more than 1000-fold range in the sizes of different nematode species, nematode nervous systems are
composed of a small number of neurons: Caenorhabditis
elegans, which is 1 mm long, has 302 neurons [1], whereas
the parasite Ascaris lumbricoides, which grows to be 20 cm
long, has 298 neurons [2]. This constancy in number of
neurons suggests a constraint in the nervous system of
nematodes.
Free-living nematodes use amphids and phasmids as sensory structures to seek food and avoid harmful stimuli
[3,4]. In C. elegans, the functions of several of the amphidial neurons and their roles in various behaviors have been
characterized in detail [3-5]. Parasitic nematodes, on the
other hand, use amphids to either actively seek the host
(Strongyloides stercoralis) [6,7] or passively seek the host
(Haemonchus contortus) [8,9]. Electron microscopic reconstruction of the amphids of the free-living nematode C.
elegans and several parasitic nematodes such as H. contortus and Ancylostoma caninum, have shown that the sensory
neuroanatomy is remarkably similar between the different species [1,6,7,10,11]. For instance, the amphid sensilla in H. contortus, a passively ingested parasite of sheep,
shows the presence of 12 sensory neurons just like in C.
elegans [1,8,9,11]. This conservation of neuroanatomy
between H. contortus and C. elegans is in perfect correlation
with the current phylogeny wherein this parasitic nematode is in the same order as C. elegans [12,13]. However, it
is surprising that even in the distantly related nematode
parasite S. stercoralis, there is remarkable similarity of the
amphid structure with C. elegans [6,7,10]. Given this similarity, it is highly likely that similar cells would mediate
the same behaviors across these diverse nematode species.
Studies by Schad and colleagues on the role of homologous neurons mediating chemotaxis, thermotaxis and
development in parasitic nematodes have shown that
positionally homologous neurons perform similar functions in these species, suggesting that neuronal function is
conserved between free-living and parasitic nematodes
[10,14,15]. Infective juveniles in parasitic nematodes use
chemical, physical and thermal signals to find their host
and resume development [14,16,17]. For instance, the
finger cell AFD neurons in H. contortus and the dog hookworm A. caninum act as thermosensors just as in C. elegans
[17,18]. Even in a more distantly related nematode S. stercoralis, ablation of the ASE neuron and ASH neuron
resulted in loss of attraction to sodium chloride at lower
concentrations and avoidance of high salt concentration
respectively [19,20]. These results suggest that C. elegans
can serve as a useful model in understanding the role of
different sensory neurons in diverse nematode species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/52

Involvement of other amphidial neurons such as the ADL
neuron in chemorepulsion to SDS in A. caninum suggested that the sensory repertoire could change in nematodes [21]. We have now extended the work of Schad and
colleagues by comparing multiple avoidance behaviors in
diverse free-living nematode species to further investigate
sensory response evolution. In particular, we studied
avoidance responses to aversive stimuli mediated by the
polymodal neuron ASH. In C. elegans, the bilaterally symmetric pair of 'polymodal nociceptive' ASH neurons
mediates stereotyped avoidance to high osmotic strength,
certain odorants, nose touch, acidic pH, heavy metals, and
alkaloids [5,22-25]. Avoidance of these stimuli involves a
highly stereotyped withdrawal response that is well characterized in C. elegans [5,26,27] (Figure 1A). The ASH neuron is also involved in mediating avoidance of high salt
concentrations and the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) in the parasitic nematode S. stercoralis [20,21].
For our comparative analysis, we chose six representative
free-living species from different groups of rhabditids with
a range of phylogenetic distances to C. elegans (Figure 1B).
Based on molecular data, rhabditids can be distinguished
into two major clades: the Eurhabditis and the Pleiorhabditis [13]. C. elegans, along with other members of the
Caenorhabditis genus, belongs to the Eurhabditis clade
[13]. From the genus Caenorhabditis, we chose C. elegans
(N2), Ceanorhabditis briggsae (AF16), and the less closely
related Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (PS1010) [12,13]. C. elegans
and C. briggsae were isolated from compost and
Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (PS1010) was isolated from galleries
of palm and sugarcane weevils [28]. Cruznema tripartitum
(SB202) is also a member of Eurhabditis but belongs to a
different branch than Caenorhabditis [13]. This species has
been isolated from different kinds of rotting organic material, and also from garden soil and compost [29]. From
the group of diplogastrids, we chose the satellite model
system Pristionchus pacificus (PS312) [30,31], which
belongs to a genus that associates with beetles [32]. Panagrellus redivivus (PS2298) was chosen as a representative of
the outgroup and has been isolated from sugar-rich environments such as sap of rubber trees and brewery mash
[33] (Figure 1B). The choice of nematode species provided a broad phylogenetic spectrum for our comparative
analysis.

Results
Comparative neuroanatomy and identification of amphid
neurons in different nematode species
Cellular anatomy is essentially invariant between individuals of the same nematode species and the number of
neurons is highly conserved between nematode species,
allowing the identification of neurons across different
species of nematodes [6,10,17,34,35].

Using the neuronal map of C. elegans (Figure 2A) [35], we
identified the amphid cell bodies in other species. The
amphidial neurons are present posterior to the nerve ring
in all the species. In C. elegans, the ASH neuron is part of
a five neuron group (ASJ, AUA, AWC, ASH, and ASE)
arranged in the shape of a 'V' (Figures 2A and 2B). The
position of these neurons is more lateral than all other
neurons in the same focal plane. An important feature of
this arrangement is the presence of two neurons anterior
to the AWC neuron, RMD and SIBD (Figures 2A and 2B).
These two neurons along with the five neurons form a 'Y'.
We found that this arrangement is conserved in all species
examined (Figures 2C–E). We observed that in all species,
the position and size of the putative ASH neuron was similar to C. elegans (Figures 2C–E). However, in C. tripartitum and P. redivivus, the putative ASH neurons are larger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/52

than those in C. elegans, consistent with the larger size of
these species (Figures 2F and 2G). The RMD and SIBD
neurons, which are small in C. elegans, are also larger in
these species (Figures 2F and 2G). The dorsal triplet
amphid neurons ASI, ADL, and ASK are found in a different focal plane and these cells were also found in the other
species in the same position (Figure 2A).
Visualization of the amphid neuron morphology using
fluorescent dye uptake in different nematode species
In C. elegans, amphid and phasmid neurons take up
lipophilic dyes such as DiI, DiO, and DiD from the environment [36-38]. These dyes have been used to visualize
the ASI, ADL, ASK, AWB, ASH, and ASJ amphid neurons,
as well as the PHA and PHB phasmid neurons [39]. We
used DiI to visualize the amphid and phasmid neurons in

all the species, and found that all species labeled most of
the amphid neurons (Figures 3A–E). In addition, DiI
staining showed that the morphology of the amphid neurons was very similar in most of the species as they label
all parts of the neuron (Figures 3A–E). In C. elegans, all
amphid neurons showed relatively strong dye uptake (Figure 3A). C. briggsae and Caenorhabditis sp. 3 also showed
strong staining of all the amphid neurons (Figures 3B and
3C). In C. tripartitum, we could visualize only four of the
six amphid neurons: ASI, ADL, ASK, and ASJ. We did not
observe any staining of the ASH neuron in this species
even though we were able to identify the neurons using
differential interference contrast microscopy (Figures 3D
and 2E). In P. pacificus, the ASH, ADL, and AWB neurons
were stained relatively weakly compared with the other
species (Figure 3E) and P. redivivus had the weakest stain-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/52

ing for ASI, AWB, and ASJ neurons, respectively (Figure
3F). The differential dye uptake in the diverse species indicates that dye uptake is not sufficient to define equivalent
neurons; however, it is consistent with general conserved
properties of amphid neurons as having open sensory
endings, and could have revealed major differences in
morphology or position of neuronal cell bodies [7,11].
ASH neuron mediates avoidance to the volatile chemical
1-octanol in all six nematode species
Based upon standard assays, avoidance of the volatile
odorant 1-octanol is remarkably conserved across all species tested (Figure 4). C. elegans responds quickly to 100%
octanol (~2–3 seconds) [40,41] Additonal File 1. In C. elegans, in the presence of food, response to 100% octanol is
primarily mediated by the ASH neuron, and in the

Octanol4
Figure avoidance behavior is highly conserved in nematodes and is mediated by ASH neurons
Octanol avoidance behavior is highly conserved in nematodes and is mediated by ASH neurons. Most species had
similar avoidance times to Caenorhabditis elegans. Panagrellus redivivus showed significantly higher avoidance time to 100% octanol than Caenorhabditis elegans. ASH neuron ablations in different species resulted in animals not sensing 100% octanol. A
mutant defective in the C. elegans vesicular glutamate transporter eat-4 was used as a negative control [56]. Data are represented as mean avoidance time (in seconds) and error bars indicate standard error of mean (s.e.m). Mean avoidance time of
different species was compared by ANOVA. Presence and absence of neurons is denoted by '+' and '-' respectively. P values
are denoted as follows: ***, P < 0.0001. For unablated and ablated conditions, n = 30 and n = 15 animals, respectively.

absence of food ASH, ADL, and AWB neurons are responsible for sensing 100% octanol, suggesting that feeding
status of the animal affects response to 1-octanol in C. elegans [40]. All the species except P. redivivus responded
after ~2–3 seconds of octanol exposure, indicating that
these species are similar in sensitivity to C. elegans [42]. P.
redivivus showed significantly delayed sensitivity to 1octanol, responding in an average of 5.9 seconds. The
delayed response could be due to the requirement for a
higher concentration of the chemical to generate a
response. To confirm the identity of the putative ASH neuron identified by position and morphology (Figures 2B–
G), we used a laser microbeam to kill the ASH neuron and
assayed for octanol avoidance. Ablation of the ASH neuron in all the species is sufficient to abolish 1-octanol
avoidance (Figure 4). As a control, we ablated the AWC

neuron in all the species and found that ablation of this
neuron did not result in loss of avoidance response to 1octanol, suggesting that the ASH neuron is specifically
required for avoidance to 1-octanol in all species (Figure
S1 in Additional file 2).
Nose touch avoidance behavior shows contraction of
sensory network
Nose touch avoidance behavior also showed a high degree
of conservation among five of six species tested (Figure
5A). In C. tripartitum, after the first few positive trials, the
animals failed to respond to nose touch, showing an overall avoidance of < 10%, suggesting that C. tripartitum
adapts to the nose touch stimulus faster than C. elegans
and the other species tested (Figure 5A). However, during
the first three trials, C. tripartitum showed a quantitatively

Figure 5 (see previous behavior is primarily mediated by ASH neuron in different species of nematodes
Nose touch avoidance page)
Nose touch avoidance behavior is primarily mediated by ASH neuron in different species of nematodes. Data
are represented as mean percent avoidance and error bars indicate standard error of mean (s.e.m). (See Supplementary Materials and Methods in Additional file 1 for details). Presence and absence of neurons is denoted by '+' and '-', respectively. For
unablated and ablated conditions, n = 30 and n = 10 animals, respectively. (A) Most species exhibit similar avoidance responses
when challenged with a mechanosensory stimulus. Ablation of the ASH neurons results in reduction of nose touch avoidance in
all species. In Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (PS1010), ASH ablation results in complete abolishment of nose touch response compared
with ASH ablated animals in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mean percent avoidance of different species was compared using ANOVA.
P values are denoted as follows: ***, P < 0.001. (B) FLP and OLQ neurons do not mediate nose touch response in Caenorhabditis sp. 3. In C. elegans, FLP-ablated animals were significantly different than unablated animals. ASH/FLP-ablated animals were significantly different than ASH-ablated animals. OLQ ablations did not affect nose touch in C. elegans. Ablation of FLP/OLQ had
significantly lower nose touch response than either of the single ablated animals. Ablations of ASH/FLP/OLQ-ablated animals
had significantly lower response than ASH-ablated animals but were similar in response to ASH/FLP-ablated animals in C. elegans. In Caenorhabditis sp. 3, FLP-ablated animals were not significantly different than unablated animals (P > 0.05). There were
no significant differences in nose touch avoidance between ASH-ablated, FLP/ASH-ablated, and ASH/FLP/OLQ-ablated animals
(P > 0.05). Other ablations tested for statistical significance: ASH-ablated vs. unablated animals, P < 0.001; FLP-ablated vs. ASH/
FLP-ablated, P < 0.001; FLP-ablated vs. FLP/OLQ-ablated, P < 0.01; OLQ-ablated vs. FLP/OLQ-ablated, P < 0.001. P values were
generated by ANOVA and denoted as follows: **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.

similar response to that of C. elegans (Figure S2 in Additional file 2). Ablation of the ASH neurons in five nosetouch responsive species resulted in loss of nose touch
avoidance (Figure 5A). Four of five species showed nose
touch responses in 20–30% of the trials (Figure 5A). However, in Caenorhabditis sp. 3, ASH-ablated animals completely lacked the ability to respond to nose touch (Figure
5A). Ablation of the AWC neuron did not affect response
to nose touch in the different species (Figure S3 in Additional file 2).
In C. elegans, nose touch response is mediated by two
non-amphid neurons, FLP and OLQ, in addition to the
ASH neurons [25]. To test whether nose touch response
might be mediated by a single sensory neuron (ASH) and
to check the role of the non-amphid neurons, we assayed
nose touch response in FLP-ablated, OLQ-ablated, FLP/
OLQ-ablated and FLP/OLQ/ASH-ablated animals in both
C. elegans and Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (Figure 5B). In C. elegans, FLP-ablated animals were significantly less responsive to nose touch compared with unablated animals.
OLQ-ablated C. elegans showed no effect on nose touch
compared with unablated animals (Figure 5B). However,
ablation of both the non-amphid neurons FLP and OLQ
in C. elegans resulted in significantly decreased nose touch
avoidance compared with either of the single neuron
ablations, suggesting that among the non-amphid neurons, FLP plays a major role in mediating nose touch
whereas OLQ plays a minor role [25] (Figure 5B). In C.
elegans, FLP/ASH-ablated animals were significantly different from ASH-ablated animals (Figure 5B). Animals
lacking FLP, ASH, and OLQ neurons were significantly
different from ASH-ablated animals but not different
from ASH/FLP-ablated animals (Figure 5B).

In Caenorhabditis sp. 3, the FLP and OLQ neurons have no
effect on nose touch response (Figure 5B). Moreover,
ablation of both the two non-amphid neurons (FLP,
OLQ) did not show any significant difference from either
of the single ablated animals (Figure 5B). In Caenorhabditis sp. 3, ablation of all three neurons (ASH, FLP, and
OLQ) did not significantly differ from ASH-ablated animals (Figure 5B). These results suggest that the ASH neuron completely mediates nose touch avoidance behavior
in Caenorhabditis sp. 3, as compared with three neurons in
C. elegans. It is conceivable that in Caenorhabditis sp. 3,
other neurons could be involved in mediating nose touch
behavior. However, ASH-ablated animals in Caenorhabditis sp. 3 show less of a nose touch response compared with
ASH/FLP/OLQ-ablated animals in C. elegans, suggesting
that ASH mediates most of the nose touch response in
Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (Figure 5B). The sensory response network for mechanical stimuli in Caenorhabditis sp. 3 thus
shows a reduction in the number of neurons involved
compared with C. elegans.
Expansion of the sensory network mediating osmotic
avoidance behavior
Osmotic avoidance behavior was assayed using the standard drop assay [23] (Figure 6A). C. elegans responds
within a second of drop delivery by backing away from
the drop of osmotic solution [23]. The avoidance index
(a.i.) was calculated by dividing the number of positive
responses to the total number of trials [23] (Additional
file 1). Within the Caenorhabditis clade, all three species
tested responded similarly to C. elegans with respect to
response times to 2 M glycerol. However, the phylogenetically distant species, P. pacificus, C. tripartitum, and P. redivivus, had longer response times compared with C. elegans
(Table 1). The average response times for P. pacificus, C.

Osmotic avoidance behavior evolves at the cellular level in different nematodes. Data are represented as mean
avoidance index (see Supplementary Materials and Methods in Additional file 1 for details) and error bars indicate standard
error of mean (s.e.m). Presence and absence of neurons is denoted by '+' and '-', respectively. Ablated animals were tested
with 2 M glycerol. For unablated and ablated conditions, n = 30 and n = 10 animals, respectively. (A) Most species showed similar responses to osmotic avoidance to Caenorhabditis elegans. Panagrellus redivivus (PS2298) showed significantly low sensitivity
to both 1 M and 2 M glycerol concentrations compared with C. elegans. In all species tested, ablation of the ASH neuron
resulted in failure of animals to avoid osmotic stress. Ablation of ASH neurons in P. redivivus resulted in animals not responding
to the 2 M glycerol. ASH-ablated C. elegans significantly differ from ASH-ablated Pristionchus pacificus. P values were generated
by ANOVA for the different species and are denoted as follows: *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.0001. (B) Cellular additivity of osmotic

pacificus resulted in complete loss of osmotic avoidance. P values were generated using ANOVA. P values are denoted as follows: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.

tripartitum, and P. redivivus were 5.2, 7.4, and 8.1 seconds,
respectively (Table 1). P. redivivus, the most distant species
tested, showed significantly decreased sensitivity to 2 M
glycerol compared with the other species (Figure 6A). We
speculate that P. redivivus could be adapted to high
osmotic conditions because it was initially isolated from
high sugar concentration environments.
Ablation of the ASH neuron almost completely abolishes
osmotic avoidance response in C. elegans [23]. In the parasitic nematode S. stercoralis, avoidance response to high
salt concentrations is completely mediated by the ASH
neuron [20]. Ablation of the ASH neuron in the other species resulted in reduced a.i. (Figure 6A). ASH ablation
does not completely abolish osmotic avoidance in P.
pacificus, suggesting the possibility of ASH-independent
mechanisms of osmotic avoidance (C. elegans a.i. = 0.15
vs. P. pacificus a.i. = 0.36; Figure 6A). In C. elegans, ASH,
ADL, ASK, and ASE neurons are known to mediate avoidance of chemical repellents [23]. The residual osmotic
avoidance seen in ASH ablated animals of P. pacificus
could be mediated by these neurons. In C. elegans, ablation of the ADL neuron had no effect on osmotic avoidance (Figure 6B). Ablation of both ASH and ADL neurons
in C. elegans did not show a significant change in osmotic

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the animal backs away from the stimulus
almost instantaneously within a second. However, avoidance to high
osmolarity conditions by more distant species varies. Panagrellus
redivivus was the slowest in response time in our assay. Data

species tested over multiple days.

avoidance index compared with ASH-ablated animals
(Figure 6B). In P. pacificus, ablation of ADL neuron results
in a significantly lower avoidance index compared with
unablated animals (Figure 6B). Ablation of both ASH and
ADL neurons in P. pacificus had a significantly lower
avoidance index compared with ASH-ablated or ADLablated animals, suggesting an additive effect of both the
neurons in osmotic avoidance behavior (ASH/ADLablated a.i. = 0.17 vs. ASH-ablated a.i. = 0.36; ASH/ADLablated a.i. = 0.17 vs. ADL-ablated a.i. = 0.62) (Figure 6B).
Ablation of the ASK and ASE neurons did not change the
osmotic sensitivity of P. pacificus, indicating that these
neurons do not play any role in osmotic avoidance (data
not shown). Hence, we believe that the ASH neuron is the
primary sensory neuron for mediating osmotic avoidance
in all nematode species, but additional sensory neurons,
such as ADL neuron in P. pacificus, may contribute to
mediating osmotic avoidance.
In C. elegans, the ADL neuron, along with ASH and ASE
neurons, mediates avoidance response to heavy metal
ions, but does not play a role on its own in mediating this
avoidance [43]. In the dog hookworm A. caninum, both
ASH and ADL neurons are required to mediate avoidance
of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate [21]. Ablation
of only the ADL neurons in the hookworm results in an
assortment of responses, from avoidance to non-responsive behavior, suggesting that the animal is not able to
decide whether to respond to the chemical [21]. In P.
pacificus, ablation of ADL neuron resulted in a significant
reduction of avoidance response, indicating that this neuron is necessary for mediating avoidance to high osmotic
conditions. The role of the ADL neuron during avoidance
behaviors in different species thus remains unclear. Perhaps analysis of the genes expressed in the ADL neuron
would provide insight into the role of this neuron in the
different species.

We cannot rule out the possibility that ablation of specific
neurons results in functional replacements by other neurons. However, if this occurs, then this aspect of nematode
neurobiology varies among cells, behaviors, and species.
Sensory sensitivity to noxious stimuli varies between
different nematode species
We hypothesized that nematodes would display habitatspecific sensitivity to the same stimuli rather than phylogeny based sensitivity. Therefore, we tested several different
concentrations of the different noxious stimuli (chemosensation and osmosensation), and used a cluster algorithm to generate a behavioral dendrogram for the
different avoidance behaviors (see Methods).

For octanol avoidance, we tested concentrations ranging
from 0.1% to 100% octanol. The data for the different
species was then normalized for each concentration with
the maximal value for that concentration giving a normalized avoidance index for the different species (see Methods). P. redivivus displayed the least sensitivity to octanol
compared with the other species at the different concentrations (Figure 7A). C. elegans and C. tripartitum show
similar sensitivity to 1-octanol (Figure 7A). Also, in C.
briggsae, Caenorhabditis sp. 3, and P. pacificus, sensitivity to
octanol avoidance was more similar to each others' than
to the other species' (Figure 7A).
As with osmotic avoidance behavior, we found that P.
redivivus was the least sensitive to glycerol compared with
the other species (Figure 7B). This observation correlates
with the fact that P. redivivus has been isolated from high
osmotic strength environments and hence could be
adapted to high osmolarity [33,44]. However, at the highest concentration tested (4 M glycerol), P. redivivus also
exhibited a very high avoidance, as did the other species
(Figure 7B). C. briggsae, Caenorhabditis sp. 3, C. tripartitum,
and P. pacificus exhibited similar sensitivity to osmotic
avoidance (Figure 7B). C. elegans exhibited slightly different osmotic sensitivity different from all these species
with the exception of P. redivivus (Figure 7B). Hence, other
than P. redivivus, all other species exhibited similar sensitivity to different osmolarity conditions.
Finally, we combined the data of octanol and osmotic
avoidance behaviors including the ASH neuron ablation
data for all the species and found that P. redivivus exhibited the most different behavior in our analyses (Figure
7C). Based on relative distances computed by the algorithm, C. tripartitum is the next closely related species to P.
redivivus. C. elegans, along with the other species, forms a
whole branch on the behavioral dendrogram, with P.
pacificus being closely related to it. C. briggsae and
Caenorhabditis sp. 3 form a sub-branch, suggesting that
these two exhibit similar behaviors. Comparing our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/52

behavioral dendrogram for octanol and osmotic avoidance behaviors with the phylogenetic tree, we see some
interesting features (Figures 7C and 7D). We observe that
for these two behaviors, the relative positions of P. redivivus and C. tripartitum resemble that of the phylogenetic
tree (Figures 7C and 7D). P. pacificus seems to be behaviorally similar to the branch of Caenorhabditis sp. 3 and C.
briggsae. Given the association of Caenorhabditis sp. 3 with
rice weevils [28] and P. pacificus with beetles [45], this correlation makes sense. Unexpectedly, C. elegans does not
exhibit similar behavioral properties like its close siblings
C. briggsae and Caenorhabditis sp. 3. These data suggest
that sensitivity to different stimuli varies among species
and that the differential sensitivity could be linked to the
functional sensory receptor repertoire of these species
[46].

Conclusion
By comparing multiple aversive behaviors in many nematode species at a cellular level, we demonstrate the relative
flexibility of the sensory system of nematodes. This suggests that the sensory architecture mediating certain polymodal behaviors can evolve (Table 2). We observed that
all species tested in our analysis avoided the three different aversive stimuli with the exception of the nematode C.
tripartitum, which showed a high degree of adaptation to
nose touch. Similarly, parasitic nematodes also avoided
several aversive stimuli [14,18,34,47]. Such conservation
of avoidance behaviors in the different nematode species
suggests that natural selection maintains these behaviors
[48,49].
At a cellular level, avoidance response to the chemical 1octanol was mediated by the ASH neuron in all species. In
parasitic nematodes, avoidance of high salt concentration
and sodium dodecylsulfate is also mediated by the ASH
neuron [20,21]. However, for nose touch response behavior, we observed a reduction in the number of sensory
neurons relative to C. elegans, with only the ASH neuron
mediating this response in Caenorhabditis sp. 3 as compared with three neurons in C. elegans (ASH, FLP, and
OLQ). On the other hand, we see an increase in the set of
sensory neurons mediating osmotic stress with the ADL
neuron partially mediating osmotic avoidance in P. pacificus along with the ASH neuron (Table 2). We also
observed that sensory sensitivity to certain stimuli varied
between the different species tested. These differential
responses could be attributed to adaptation of the species
to their respective niches. For example, P. redivivus has a
slower response time in response to 1-octanol and is
highly resistant to high osmotic conditions (Figures 4 and
6). Since P. redivivus was isolated from the sap of rubber
trees and brewery mash, these responses could be attributed to adaptation to sugar-rich environments.

Figure sensitivity to different concentrations of the stimuli varies in the different nematode species
Sensory 7
Sensory sensitivity to different concentrations of the stimuli varies in the different nematode species. (A) Concentration curves for octanol avoidance. We tested concentrations ranging from 0% octanol to 100% octanol on the species
and found that Panagrellus redivivus did not avoid this noxious chemical to the same extent as the other species. Caenorhabditis
elegans and Cruznema tripartitum displayed similar trends in avoidance and Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis sp. 3 and Pristionchus pacificus responded very similarly. Data for each species is represented as normalized avoidance index (see Methods
for details). (B) Concentration curves for glycerol avoidance. Concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 4 M glycerol were tested
on the different nematodes. We found that P. redivivus showed least avoidance of glycerol at concentrations wherein the other
species fully responded to glycerol. At the highest concentration tested, P. redivivus also responded strongly to glycerol. All the
other species displayed similar avoidance of different concentrations of glycerol. Data for each species is represented as normalized avoidance index (See Methods for details). (C) Behavioral dendrogram for osmotic avoidance and octanol avoidance
and its relation to the phylogenetic tree. The dendrogram was generated using hierarchical clustering for these two sensory
behaviors. This data set incorporated all the different ablations done in the different species for the different behavioral assays.
As expected P. redivivus and C. tripartitum exhibited the most different behavioral repertoire compared with the other species.
(D) Phylogenetic tree of the species used in our analysis.

The conservation of several properties of a multi-functional neuron across diverse lifestyles is not surprising,
given the constancy of neuron number in these nematodes. However, to understand how sensory responses
evolve, comparison of closely related species is an essential prerequisite. Such studies can uncover selection pressures that act within a shared evolutionary history to cause

either differences in their behavior or changes in cellular
contribution to these behaviors [50]. These changes may
evolve by alterations in the number and type of sensory
receptors each neuron expresses, by the efficacy of signal
transduction in sensory neurons, or by the strength of
connectivity of the neuron to its postsynaptic partners.
Our results provide a clear demonstration of change in the

Most species respond similarly to the volatile odorant 1-octanol. This response is completely mediated by the ASH neuron. However, nose touch
and osmotic avoidance responses evolve: in Caenorhabditis elegans, three neurons mediate nose touch whereas in Caenorhabditis sp. 3, only ASH
mediates this response. Avoidance to high osmolarity conditions is primarily mediated by the ASH neuron, but in Pristionchus pacificus, the ADL
neuron also contributes to this sensory response. '+' denotes the degree of involvement of the neuron in mediating the behavior; '+++', completely

relative contributions of nociceptive neurons in a sensory
network in diverse free-living nematode species. These
studies allow inference of ways in which sensory
responses in free-living nematodes might evolve, and suggest how such evolution might occur in medically and
agriculturally relevant nematodes.

Methods
Nematode cultures and maintenance
All strains were raised at 20°C unless indicated otherwise,
using standard methods [51]. Strains used in this study
were C. elegans (N2 Bristol isolate) [51], C. elegans eat4(ky5) MT6308 [52], C. elegans glr-1(n2461) KP4 [41], C.
briggsae (AF16)[53], Caenorhabditis sp. 3 (PS1010), P.
pacificus (PS312) [54], C. tripartitum (SB202), and P. redivivus (PS2298/MT8872) [55].
Staining of amphid neurons using the lipophilic dye DiI
A stock solution of DiI (2 mg/ml) was prepared in dimethyl formamide and stored at -20°C [38]. Worms from
the different species were washed from plates and resuspended in a small eppendorf tube to a 100 μl volume. The
worm pellet was washed thrice in M9 buffer and worms
allowed to settle down using gravity. To this pellet we
added a 1:200 dilution of DiI solution and incubated in
the dark for 2–3 hours. After the incubation, the worms
were washed three times in M9 buffer and then mounted
on a slide to visualize the amphid neurons. For some species, we used a longer incubation time (5–7 hours) to visualize neurons.
Laser ablations and behavioral assays
For all species tested, we used the L1 larva stage for our
ablations as described previously [26]. All behavioral
assays were performed as described previously [23,25,42].
A detailed description of the ablations and behavioral
assays is given in the Supplementary Materials and Methods in Additional file 1. Ablation of one of the two bilat-

erally symmetrical neurons did not affect the avoidance
response to different stimuli.
Sensory sensitivity assays and cluster analysis of the
behavioral phenotypes
For octanol avoidance sensitivity, we made different dilutions of 100% octanol (0.1%–100%) and each species
was tested with each concentration at least on three different days. Data was represented as average avoidance time
for each concentration.

Similarly, for sensitivity to osmotic avoidance, we tested
concentrations ranging from 0.1 M to 4 M glycerol. Data
was represented as mean a.i. (see Supplementary Materials and Methods in Additional file 1 for details).
For each of the behavioral assays, the normalized a.i. was
computed for each species. This was done by normalizing
the value for each species at each concentration to the
maximum value for that concentration. The normalized
values for the different concentrations were then plotted
for each species in Matlab. For obtaining the dendrogram,
data was then clustered using a Matlab hierarchical clustering algorithm (Euclidean distances and average linkage). The x-axis of the dendrogram indicates relative
distance between the different species.
Statistical analysis
The statistical tests employed are described in Additional
file 1.
