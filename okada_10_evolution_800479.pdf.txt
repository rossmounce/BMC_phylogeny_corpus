Abstract
Background: The unfolding speed of some hyperthermophilic proteins is dramatically lower than that of their
mesostable homologs. Ribonuclease HII from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase
HII) is stabilized by its remarkably slow unfolding rate, whereas RNase HI from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus
thermophilus (Tt-RNase HI) unfolds rapidly, comparable with to that of RNase HI from Escherichia coli (Ec-RNase HI).
Results: To clarify whether the difference in the unfolding rate is due to differences in the types of RNase H or
differences in proteins from archaea and bacteria, we examined the equilibrium stability and unfolding reaction of
RNases HII from the hyperthermophilic bacteria Thermotoga maritima (Tm-RNase HII) and Aquifex aeolicus (Aa-RNase
HII) and RNase HI from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii (Sto-RNase HI). These proteins from
hyperthermophiles are more stable than Ec-RNase HI over all the temperature ranges examined. The observed
unfolding speeds of all hyperstable proteins at the different denaturant concentrations studied are much lower than
those of Ec-RNase HI, which is in accordance with the familiar slow unfolding of hyperstable proteins. However, the
unfolding rate constants of these RNases H in water are dispersed, and the unfolding rate constant of thermophilic
archaeal proteins is lower than that of thermophilic bacterial proteins.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the nature of slow unfolding of thermophilic proteins is determined by the
evolutionary history of the organisms involved. The unfolding rate constants in water are related to the amount of
buried hydrophobic residues in the tertiary structure.
Background
Proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles generally exhibit higher stability than their mesostable counterparts [1-4]. Recent research in this field has indicated
that some proteins from hyperthermophiles are stabilized
by their remarkably slow unfolding rates [5-17]. At present, the molecular mechanism of slow unfolding is not
completely clear. Recently, using hydrophobic mutant
proteins, Dong et al. [18] demonstrated that the hydrophobic effect is one of the reasons for the slow unfolding
of ribonuclease HII from the hyperthermophilic
archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase HII).
However, the attributes of proteins that exhibit unusually
slow unfolding are unclear. For example, Tk-RNase HII is
kinetically robust [19], whereas RNase HI from the ther* Correspondence: ktakano@mls.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp

mophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus (Tt-RNase
HI), which has equivalent thermostability but no
sequence similarity to Tk-RNase HII, unfolds rapidly.
Moreover, the unfolding rate of Tt-RNase HI is comparable with to that of RNase HI from Escherichia coli (EcRNase HI) [20,21]. The reason for the difference in the
unfolding rate is unknown.
Both equilibrium stability and kinetic unfolding/refolding experiments can improve our understanding of the
nature of hyperstable proteins. Luke et al. [22] listed the
hyperthermophilic proteins for which kinetic folding/
unfolding parameters have been reported. These are generally oligomers or monomers that show irreversible
unfolding. Monomeric proteins with reversible unfolding
are suitable for detailed analysis of the essentials of slow
unfolding. Only RNase H, cold shock protein (Csp), and
ribosomal protein S16 (S16) satisfy these prerequisites
[23]. Csp from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (Tm-Csp) and ribosomal protein S16

from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus
(Aa-S16) do not exhibit extremely slow unfolding [24-27].
Data for the unfolding kinetics of RNase H, Csp, and S16
suggest that differences in the type of protein, i.e.,
whether it is RNase HI or RNase HII, or differences in the
organism kingdom, i.e., whether the host organism to
which the protein belongs originates from archaea or
bacteria, may be the reason for the differences in the
unfolding reactions of Tk-RNase HII and Tt-RNase HI.
Based on their sequence similarity, RNases H are classified into two major types--Type 1 RNase H and Type 2
RNase H [28,29]. RNase HI is a member of Type 1 RNase
H, whereas RNase HII is a member of Type 2 RNase H.
Comparison of the crystal structures of Ec-RNase HI, TtRNase HI, and Tk-RNase HII indicates that these
enzymes share a folding motif referred to as the RNase Hfold due to its characterization in Ec-RNase HI [30],
although there is no sequence similarity between RNase
HI and RNase HII. The stability and folding of Ec-RNase
HI, Tt-RNase HI, and Tk-RNase HII have been well studied [18-21,31-40].
Archaea and bacteria have divided at an early stage of
evolution [41]. Hyperthermophiles and thermophiles in
archaea originated in a hot environment but those in bacteria recolonized at a later stage under extreme conditions. The differences in the unfolding characteristics of
hyperstable proteins may be ascribed to such differences
in the evolutionary history of thermophilic archaea and
bacteria.
In this study, we focused on Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase
HII, and Sto-RNase HI (Sulfolobus tokodaii) and compared these proteins with Tk-RNase HII, Tt-RNase HI,
and Ec-RNase HI in terms of their stability and unfolding
kinetics [19-21,31]. Tm-RNase HII and Aa-RNase HII are
proteins from hyperthermophilic bacteria and are Type 2
RNase H proteins. Sto-RNase HI is a protein from a
hyperthermophilic archaeon and is a Type 1 RNase H. All
these proteins are monomeric. Table 1 summarizes the
types and origins of RNases H studied in this paper. The
crystal structures of Ec-RNase HI, Tt-RNase HI, StoRNase HI, Tk-RNase HII, and Tm-RNase HII have
already been determined (PDB ID 2RN2, 1RIL, 2EHG,
1IO2, and 2ETJ) [42-45] (see additional file 1). We used
circular dichroism (CD) to study the equilibrium stability
and kinetic aspects of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase
HII, and Sto-RNase HI. These proteins exhibited reversible unfolding during GdnHCl-induced unfolding. The
unfolding of these hyperthermophilic origin RNases H
induced by GdnHCl concentration jumps is apparently
quite slow and similar to that of several hyperthermophilic proteins that exhibit irreversible unfolding. However, the unfolding rate constant in water depends on the
kingdom (archaea or bacteria) to which the host microor-

ganisms belong. Based on the results obtained, we discuss
the origin of slow unfolding in relation to the attributes of
the proteins.

Results
CD spectra and reversible unfolding in GdnHCl

The far-UV spectra of Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase HII, and
Sto-RNase HI were recorded in the absence and presence
of GdnHCl at 25°C (see additional file 2). The spectra
represent the proteins in their native and GdnHCl denatured states in the absence and presence of GdnHCl. The
spectra of the folded condition obtained from the denatured state by dilution of GdnHCl were also recorded.
The results demonstrate that GdnHCl-induced unfolding
of these proteins is almost completely reversible under
each condition (see additional file 2). Experiments on
GdnHCl-induced unfolding of these proteins were carried out under conditions of reversible unfolding (see
below). It has been shown that Tk-RNase HII, Tt-RNase
HI, and Ec-RNase HI undergo reversible unfolding in the
presence of denaturants [19,20,31]. RNases H are considered to be good models for clarifying the mechanisms of
conformational stability and folding of hyperstable proteins. RNase HI from the psychotrophic bacterium Shewanella onedensis MR-1 was also shown to unfold
reversibly in the presence of chemical denaturants [4648].
Equilibrium stability of GdnHCl-induced unfolding and
stability profile

The equilibrium stabilities of Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase
HII, and Sto-RNase HI were evaluated by GdnHClinduced denaturation, and the changes were monitored
by CD at various temperatures (see additional file 3).
Reactions reached equilibrium within 3 days for TmRNase HII and Aa-RNase HII and within 3 weeks for StoRNase HI, suggesting that the unfolding of these proteins
was slow. These proteins exhibit a two-state transition.
The ΔG(H2O) value at each temperature was calculated
using Eqs. (1) and (2). The resultant ΔG(H2O) values
were plotted as a function of the temperature (stability
profile) in Figure 1 and were fitted to Eq. (3). When fitting
these values to Eq. (3), the Tm value, which is the thermal
denaturation temperature obtained from the heatinduced unfolding experiment (see below), was used
(ΔG(H2O) = 0 at Tm). Figure 1 shows the data for TkRNase HII, Tt-RNase HI, and Ec-RNase HI. The values of
Tm, ΔCp, ΔHm, Ts, and ΔG(Ts) of RNases H are summarized in Table 2. ΔCp represents the difference in the heat
capacity of the native and unfolded states; ΔHm is the
enthalpy change of the unfolding at Tm; Ts is the temperature at which the protein exhibits the maximal ΔG(H2O)
value; and ΔG(Ts) is the ΔG(H2O) value at Ts.

RNases H from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles
are more stable than Ec-RNase HI over most of the temperature ranges examined. In particular, Sto-RNase HI
has much higher stability. However, the thermodynamic
parameters and stabilization mechanism from the viewpoint of equilibrium stability for the hyperstable RNases

below).

and Tk-RNase HII (82.8°C) [19,20].
Kinetics of GdnHCl-induced unfolding

The kinetics of GdnHCl-induced unfolding of Tm-RNase
HII, Aa-RNase HII, and Sto-RNase HI were measured at
25°C. The reaction was initiated by jumps to various
GdnHCl concentrations followed by CD measurements.
The representative curves were plotted, as shown in Figure . All kinetic traces are described well by a single exponential. Figure
shows the GdnHCl concentration
dependence of the logarithms of the apparent rate constant (kapp) for the unfolding of RNases H. The logarithms
of kapp linearly increase with an increase in the GdnHCl
concentration. Figure also shows the GdnHCl-induced
unfolding data for Tk-RNase HII and Ec-RNase HI. The
kapp values for RNases H from hyperthermophiles were
significantly lower than those of Ec-RNase HI at all the
GdnHCl concentrations examined. By fitting the data to

Thermal stability of heat-induced unfolding

Heat-induced unfolding of Sto-RNase HI has already
been analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
[44]. The Tm of Sto-RNase HI is 102.0°C. The thermal
denaturation curves of Tm-RNase HII and Aa-RNase HII
were recorded by measuring the change in CD. The thermal denaturation of these proteins was almost completely
reversible in the presence of various concentrations of
GdnHCl (see Methods). Tm was calculated by curve fitting the resultant CD spectrum versus temperature based
on a least-squares analysis using Eq. (4). The Tm values of
Tm-RNase HII and Aa-RNase HII in the absence of GdnHCl were estimated to be 78.6°C and 84.0°C, respectively,

to characterize super slow unfolding and elucidate its
mechanism by examining several RNase H proteins from
thermophiles and hyperthermophiles.

Equilibrium stability of hyperstable RNases H

The stability of proteins in solution is quantitatively evaluated by the Gibbs energy changes (ΔG) observed upon
unfolding when the reaction is reversible under experimental conditions. The temperature dependence of ΔG
(stability profile) provides some information on the thermodynamic stability of proteins and can be expressed by
Eq. (3).
Three thermodynamic models have been proposed to
explain the high stability of thermostable proteins [49]. In
the first model, the entire stability curve is raised to a
higher ΔG; in the second, the stability curve is flattened;
and in the third, the curve is shifted to a higher temperature. Adherence to all three models is observed in nature,
and in many cases, proteins from hyperthermophiles utilize various combinations of these mechanisms [50-55].
The outcome depends on the model used to adapt the
proteins to a high temperature.
RNases H from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles
are more stable than Ec-RNase HI over most of the temperature ranges examined (Figure 1). In the case of hyperstable RNases HI, Tt-RNase HI adopts the first and
second models, and Sto-RNase HI uses the first and third
models (Figure 1 and Table 2). There is no data on mesophilic RNase HII. Among the hyperthermophilic RNases
HII, Tm-RNase HII has a flatter curve than Aa-RNase HII
and Tk-RNase HII as a result of its lower ΔCp. The Ts
value of Tm-RNase HII is also lower than that of AaRNase HII and Tk-RNase HII. However, ΔG(Ts) of TkRNase HII is higher than that of Tm-RNase HII and AaRNase HII. These results suggest that the thermodynamic stabilization of RNases H from thermophiles and
hyperthermophiles is achieved through different mechanisms.

3. Figure shows the urea-induced unfolding data for EcRNase HI and Tt-RNase HI [21,33]. The ku(H2O) values
for RNases H are dispersed over six orders of magnitude.
The ku(H2O) value of Aa-RNase HII is similar to that of
Ec-RNase HI, whereas the unfolding of Tk-RNase HII
and Sto-RNase HI is remarkably slow.

Discussion
Proteins from hyperthermophiles often exhibit slower
unfolding than those from organisms that grow at moderate temperatures [5-17]. However, the extent of the
decrease in the unfolding rate of hyperthermophilic proteins relative to that of their mesophilic counterparts varies, depending on the type of protein involved. The

Estimation of the unfolding speed of hyperstable RNases H
at zero denaturant concentration

All the RNases H from the hyperthermophiles examined
showed a remarkably slow rate of unfolding in the presence of GdnHCl, as described above. However, the
dependencies of the apparent rate constants of the
unfolding reactions on the GdnHCl concentration varied
according to the type of protein (Figure 3). By extrapolating the unfolding rate constants to zero, the denaturant
concentration yields the semilogarithmic unfolding rate
constants in water (ln ku(H2O)). It has been reported that
ku(H2O) at 25°C is 1.1 × 10-5 s-1 for GdnHCl-induced
unfolding and 1.7 × 10-5 s-1 for urea-induced unfolding of
Ec-RNase HI. Furthermore, the values are 1.3 × 10-5 s-1 for
urea-induced unfolding of Tt-RNase HI and 6.0 × 10-10 s-1
for GdnHCl-induced unfolding of Tk-RNase HII
[19,21,31,33]. These values indicate that Tt-RNase HI
unfolds in water on a time scale similar to that of EcRNase HI; however, the unfolding rate of Tk-RNase HII is
dramatically lower than that of Ec-RNase HI. Therefore,
the unfolding of Tk-RNase HII is much slower than that
of Tt-RNase HI, although the equilibrium stabilities of TtRNase HI and Tk-RNase HII are comparable. Furthermore, although there are no unfolding kinetics data for
Ec-RNase HII, it is possible that Ec-RNase HII may not
exhibit slow unfolding because Ec-RNase HII is less stable than Ec-RNase HI [56].

Globular proteins usually unfold in the presence of GdnHCl. Unfolding takes less than 1 min in most small globular proteins. To measure such fast unfolding rates, a
stopped-flow instrument is required. Ec-RNase HI is
unfolded within 10 s by a final concentration of 3.0 M
GdnHCl [31]. In contrast, the unfolding of some hyperstable proteins may take a few hours to several days. Pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase from the hyperthermophilic
archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf-PCP) is unfolded over a
period of 1 day or more by a final concentration of 7.7 M
GdnHCl [6], and the unfolding of Tk-RNase HII by a final
concentration of 3.9 M GdnHCl requires 2 h [19]. The
observed unfolding of all hyperstable proteins examined
here is much slower than that of Ec-RNase HI in the presence of GdnHCl (Figures 2 and 3). For example, TmRNase HII is unfolded by 4.8 M GdnHCl within approximately 2 h; Aa-RNase HII is unfolded by 3.5 M GdnHCl
within 1 h; and Sto-RNase HI is unfolded by 7.0 M GdnHCl within about 8 h. Our results suggest that such super
slow unfolding in the presence of a chemical denaturant
might be a common strategy for achieving higher stability
and could be related to the adaptation of hyperthermophilic RNases H to higher temperatures.

Tt-RNase HI. In contrast, Sto-RNase HI has remarkably
slow unfolding characteristics, as in the case of Tk-RNase
HII. The unfolding of Tm-RNase HII is slower than that

Tk-RNase HII. This finding is supported by data from
other monomeric proteins with reversible unfolding. TmCsp and Aa-S16 from hyperthermophilic bacteria do not
exhibit extremely slow unfolding [24-27].

of Ec-RNase HI, but the difference is much less than that
between Ec-RNase HI and Sto-RNase HI. Thus, TmRNase HII does not show the extremely slow unfolding
reactions.
For Tk-RNase HII and Sto-RNase HI, which exhibit
slow unfolding, the experimental conditions were pH 9.0
[19] and pH 3.0, respectively, because the proteins unfold
reversibly at each of these pH conditions. At neutral pH
where these proteins do not show completely reversible
unfolding, the ku(H2O) value due to GdnHCl-induced
unfolding at 25°C was not very different from the value
obtained under reversible conditions. For example, the
ku(H2O) value was 9.3 × 10-10 s-1 for Tk-RNase HII at pH
7.5 and 3.3 × 10-11 s-1 for Sto-RNase HI at pH 5.5. Therefore, Tk-RNase HII and Sto-RNase HI unfold extremely
slowly at neutral pH.
It should be noted here that the differences in the
unfolding rates of hyperstable RNases H reflect the
organism kingdom from which the host microorganisms
of RNases H originate, i.e., archaea or bacteria. RNases H
from thermophilic bacteria, such as Tt-RNase HI, AaRNase HII, and Tm-RNase HII unfold faster than similar

As described above, the nature of slow unfolding depends
on the evolutionary history of the organisms. What is the
difference between thermophilic archaeal and bacterial
proteins? Berezovsky & Shakhnovich [57] reported that
proteins from archaea that originated in a hot environment are more compact and hydrophobic than their
mesophilic homologs. In contrast, proteins from some
bacteria, such as Tm, that recolonized at a later stage
under extreme conditions are stabilized by specific interactions such as salt bridges. Mizuguchi et al. [58] have
shown differences in the amino acid composition of
archaeal and bacterial proteins. They concluded that
thermal adaptation is achieved in different ways in the
archaeal and bacterial kingdoms.
The pie diagrams shown in Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C
depict the fraction of hydrophobic, polar, and charged
residues in the interior of the tertiary structure of hyperstable RNases H. Because the structure of Aa-RNase HII
has not been solved and some regions in the crystal structure of Tm-RNase HII have not been determined, we
used the structures of Tt-RNase HI, Sto-RNase HI, and
Tk-RNase HII. The results reveal that Sto-RNase HI and
Tk-RNase HII from archaea are richer in hydrophobic
residues than Tt-RNase HI from bacteria. This indicates
that super slow unfolding in water is related to the
amount of buried hydrophobic residues. The strong
effect of hydrophobic interactions on the slow unfolding
of Tk-RNase HII supports this hypothesis [18]. We also
calculated the fractions of buried amino acid residues of
other hyperstable RNase H homologs, the crystal structures of which have been determined. Similar to StoRNase HI and Tk-RNase HII, RNases HII from the hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus furiosus (1UAX) and
Archaeoglobus fulgidus (1I39) have more buried hydrophobic residues than Tt-RNase HII (see additional file 4).
Furthermore, phylogenetic trees based on thermostable
RNases HI and HII clearly show the difference in the
characteristics of archaea and bacteria proteins (see additional file 5). These results suggest that archaeal RNases
H are stabilized by super slow unfolding but bacterial
RNases H are not.
We also calculated the buried area of the polar (O and
N) and nonpolar (C and S) atoms in the interior of the
proteins because the buried area contributes to protein
stability [59]. The buried areas of nonpolar atoms in TtRNase HI, Sto-RNase HI, and Tk-RNase HII were 62.6%,
67.3%, and 64.5%, respectively (see additional file 6). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between

bacterial and archaeal proteins, although the hydrophobicity of archaeal RNases H (Sto-RNase HI and Tk-RNase
HII) was higher than that of bacterial RNase H (Tt-RNase
HI). Therefore, we suggest that the overall hydrophobicity, calculated from the buried area of atoms, does not differ greatly between bacterial and archaeal proteins and
contributes to their equilibrium stability. The equlibrium
stability of Sto-RNase HI, which is the most hydrophobic
RNase H, is considerably higher than that of Tt-RNase HI
and Tk-RNase HII (Figure 1). It has been reported that
100 Å2 of buried nonpolar atoms contributes to an equilibrium stability of about 15 kJ mol-1 [59]. In contrast, the
estimate from the sequence/structure data (the fractions
of amino acid residues in the interior of proteins) differs
between bacterial and archaeal proteins [57,58], as
described above. This suggests that the hydrophobic
interaction arising from the partially exposed hydrophobic side chains may affect the unfolding rate (see below).
Figures 4D and 4E represent the amino acid sequence
alignments, buried residues (Tt, Sto and Tk), and hydrophobic residues of thermophilic RNases H. In RNases HI,
Sto-RNase HI has 24 buried hydrophobic residues with
nonburied or nonhydrophobic counterparts in Tt-RNase
HI, whereas Tt-RNase HI has 11 such residues. Tk-RNase
HII also possesses 10 buried hydrophobic residues with
nonhydrophobic counterparts in Aa-RNase HII and TmRNase HII. These residues in Sto-RNase HI and TkRNase HII may be possible causes of the slow unfolding
rate. These results will be confirmed in the near future by
amino acid substitution experiments. Figures 4F, 4G, and
4H show the crystal structures of the buried hydrophobic
residues of Tt-RNase HI, Sto-RNase HI, and Tk-RNase
HII. Among RNases HI, Sto-RNase HI has more buried
hydrophobic residues than Tt-RNase HI. Furthermore, it
seems that the the 24 buried hydrophobic residues in StoRNase HI, which have nonburied or nonhydrophobic
counterparts in Tt-RNase HI, are located near the surface
of the protein. Tk-RNase HII also shows a similar tendency. The results suggest that buried hydrophobic sidechains near the protein surface may contribute to slow
unfolding. Unfortunately, at present, the mechanism of
slow unfolding by buried hydrophobic side-chains near
the protein surface remains unclear.
Energy diagram of the stability and folding of hyperstable
proteins

It has been reported that some hyperthermophilic proteins have a remarkably slow unfolding rate but a normal
refolding rate in comparison with their homologous
mesophilic proteins [6,8]. Tk-RNase HII unfolds
extremely slowly but folds rapidly [19]. In contrast, TtRNase HI, which has thermostability equivalent to that of
Tk-RNase HII, unfolds and folds quickly, similar to the
behavior of Ec-RNase HI [19,21]. We can consider the

Page 8 of 12

energy diagrams of the folding process (see additional file
7). The first is for a mesophilic protein and is a two-state
model. The second is for hyperstable proteins with super
slow unfolding, whereas the third is for hyperstable proteins without super slow unfolding. In the second model,
the increase in the equilibrium stability (ΔG) between the
native and denatured states is accompanied by an
increase in the unfolding barrier (N to T). In contrast, the
third model includes an intermediate state in the folding
process, which results in an increase in ΔG without an
increase in either the folding or unfolding barriers. It has
been reported that although Tt-RNase HI has an intermediate folding state, Tk-RNase HII folds according to the
two-state model [19,36,60]. Therefore, Tt-RNase HI and
Tk-RNase HII are represented by the third and second
models, respectively. For Aa-RNase HI and Tm-RNase
HI, the refolding experiments show that there is an intermediate state in the folding process (data not shown),
suggesting that these proteins can be represented by the
third model. When Sto-RNase HI folds according to the
two-state model, kf(H2O) = 9.3 × 10 s-1, mf = -2.98 M-1 s-1,
and ΔGkinetics(H2O) = 73.9 kJ mol-1 (unpublished data).
This indicates that Sto-RNase HI is represented by the
second model. On the other hand, the tetrameric protein
Pf-PCP both folds and unfolds quite slowly [6]. Therefore, this protein is represented by the fourth model, in
which the increase in equilibrium stability (ΔG) between
the native and denatured states is accompanied by
increases in both the unfolding (N to T) and folding (D to
T) barriers. As a result, the unfolding barrier of the fourth
model is higher than that of the second model. The
unfolding rate of Pf-PCP (1.6 × 10-15 s-1) is lower than
those of Tk-RNase HII and Sto-RNase HI (6.0 × 10-10 s-1
and 5.7 × 10-11 s-1) [6].

Conclusion
In summary, we have presented the stability and unfolding kinetics of hyperstable RNases H. This is a good protein family for investigating the stability and folding
mechanisms from the viewpoints of thermal adaptation
and evolution because the proteins are in the monomeric
form and undergo reversible unfolding. Although different mechanisms are responsible for the equilibrium stabilization of hyperstable RNases H, unfolding depends on
the evolutional history of the host organisms from which
the proteins originate. This has led to the use of different
strategies for thermal adaptation by thermophilic archaea
and bacteria.
Methods
Construction of plasmids

Plasmids pET800TM and pET600AA, used for overproduction of Tm-RNase HII and Aa-RNase HII, were con-

structed by ligating 714bp and 588bp DNA fragments,
respectively, into the NdeI-SalI sites of pET25b (Novagen). The DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using
the genomic DNA of Tm and Aa as a template. The
sequences of the PCR primers for Tm-RNase HII are 5'GAAAGGAGACGGCATATGGGAATAGATGA-3' for
the 5' primer and 5'-GCGGTCGACCTTTGTGTTCGGAGATAAAG-3' for the 3' primer, and the PCR primers
for Aa-RNase HII are 5'-AACCATATGCTTAATTACGAATTAGAACTTTG-3' for the 5' primer and 5'-GCGGTCGACCTAAAAAAGTTTTTTCTTAAGGGG-3' for
the 3' primer, where the bold bases indicate the positions
of the NdeI and SalI sites. The DNA sequence of the PCR
products was confirmed with a Prism 310 DNA
sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).
Overproduction and purification

E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET800TM and
pET600AA then grown in NZCYM medium (Novagen)
containing 50 mgL-1 ampicillin 30 mgL-1 chloramphenicol
at 30°C. When the optical density at 660 nm of the culture reached 0.5, 1 mM IPTG was added to the culture
medium and cultivation continued at 30°C for four hours.
Cells were transformed with pET800TM, harvested by
centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, suspended in 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 10 mM EDTA, disrupted
by sonication lysis, and centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min.
The supernatant was subjected to heat treatment at 75°C
for 20 min and centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. The
supernatant was applied to an anion-exchange column (5
mL) of a HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences)
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8). The protein
was eluted from the column with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8)
containing 10 mM EDTA. The flow-through containing
the protein was pooled and applied to a Hitrap Heparin
and SP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated
with the same buffer. After the column was washed, the
protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient
of NaCl from 0 to 1 M in the same buffer. The fractions
containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 200 mM NaCl. Cells
were transformed with pET600AA, harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, suspended in 20 mM
Acetate-NaOH (pH 5.5) containing 10 mM EDTA, disrupted by French press lysis, and centrifuged at 30,000 g
for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to an anionexchange column (5 mL) of a HiTrap Q HP column equilibrated with 20 mM Acetate-NaOH (pH 5.5). The protein
was eluted from the column with 20 mM Acetate-NaOH
(pH 5.5) containing 10 mM EDTA. The flow-through
containing the protein was pooled and applied to a Hitrap
SP column equilibrated with the same buffer. After the
column was washed, the protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M in the

same buffer. The fractions containing the protein were
pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Acetate-NaOH (pH
5.0). The fractions containing the protein were pooled
and applied to a Hitrap Heparin column equilibrated with
the same buffer. After the column was washed, the protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of
NaCl from 0 to 1 M in the same buffer. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20
mM Acetate-NaOH (pH 5.0).
Sto-RNase HI was overproduced and purified as previously described [44,61]. The purity of the protein was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel,
followed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
Protein concentration

The protein concentrations were estimated by assuming
absorbances at 280 nm of 0.24 for 1 mgmL-1 Tm-RNase
HII and 0.89 for 1 mgmL-1 Aa-RNase HII. These values
were calculated using 1576 M-1cm-1 for Tyr and 5225 M1cm-1 for Trp at 280 nm [62].
CD spectra measurements

The CD spectra of Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase HII, and
Sto-RNase HI in the absence and presence of GdnHCl
were measured on a J-725 automatic spectropolarimeter
(Japan Spectroscopic). The optical path length was 2 mm
and the protein concentration was 0.16 mgml-1. The buffers we used were 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl at pH
7.5 for Tm-RNase HII, 20 mM Acetate-NaOH at pH 5.0
for Aa-RNase HII, and 20 mM Glycine-NaOH at pH 3.0
for Sto-RNase HI. The measurements were done at 25°C.
For the spectra of a refolded protein, the protein that was
completely unfolded at a 7.0 M GdnHCl concentration
was diluted with buffer for refolding, and the diluted protein solution was incubated at the selected temperature
until refolding reached equilibrium. The mean residue
ellipticity, θ, in units of degrees square centimeters per
decimole, was calculated using an average amino acid
molecular weight of 110.
Equilibrium experiments on GdnHCl-induced unfolding

GdnHCl-induced unfolding was examined by monitoring
the CD at 220 nm as described previously [19]. RNases H
were incubated in GdnHCl at different concentrations
and at different temperatures for unfolding. The GdnHCl-induced unfolding curves were determined, and a
nonlinear least-squares analysis [63] was used to fit the
data to
y = ((b 0 n + a n[D])
+(b 0 u + a u [D]) exp((ΔG(H 2O) − m[D]) / RT )) /
(1 + exp((ΔG(H 2O) − m[D]) / RT ))

is the CD signal for the native state, b0u is the CD signal
for the unfolded states, an is the slope of the pre-transition of the baseline, and au is the slope of the posttransition of the baseline. ΔG(H2O) is the Gibbs energy change
(ΔG) of the unfolding in the absence of GdnHCl, m is the
slope of the linear correlation between ΔG and the GdnHCl concentration [D], and Cm is the GdnHCl concentration at the midpoint of the curve. The raw experiment
data were directly fitted to Eq. (1) using SigmaPlot (Jandel
Scientific). The equilibrium experiments were conducted
in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.5 for TmRNase HII, 20 mM Acetate-NaOH at pH 5.0 for AaRNase HII, and 20 mM Glycine-NaOH at pH 3.0 for StoRNase HI. To use Tris-HCl buffer at different temperatures, the pH was adjusted at 25°C so that the final pH
would be 7.5 at the desired temperature [64]. The protein
concentration when the CD measurements were taken
was 0.16 mgmL-1.
ΔG(H2O) was examined at various temperatures to determine the stability curves for Tm-RNase HII, Aa-RNase
HII, and Sto-RNase HI. The stability curves obtained
were fitted to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, Eq. (3):

CD signal for the unfolded states, an is the slope of the
pretransition of the baseline, au is the slope of the posttransition of the baseline, ΔHm is the enthalpy of unfolding at the transition midpoint temperature (Tm), T is the
temperature, and R is the gas constant. Curve fitting was
performed using SigmaPlot. Because the Tm values of
these proteins increased in proportion to a decrease in
GdnHCl concentration, the Tm values in the absence of
GdnHCl were estimated by linear extrapolation [46].

data to

of unfolding at the reference temperature To, and ΔCp is
the difference in heat capacity between the native and
unfolded states.
Heat-induced unfolding experiments

Heat-induced unfolding was examined by monitoring the
CD at 220 nm. CD measurements were carried out on a J725 automatic spectropolarimeter as described previously [65]. The optical path length was 2 mm. The thermal denaturation curves of these proteins were measured
in the presence of various concentrations of GdnHCl to
determine the Tm values of Tm-RNase HII and Aa-RNase
HII in the absence of GdnHCl, where thermal denaturation of these proteins is not reversible. The buffer used
was 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.5 in the
presence of 1.0 to 2.0 M GdnHCl for Tm-RNase HII and
20 mM Acetate-NaOH at pH 5.0 in the presence of 1.2 to
2.0 M GdnHCl for Aa-RNase HII. The thermal denaturation of these proteins was reversible under these condi-

The unfolding reactions were followed by CD spectra
measurement at 220 nm, using 2 mm and 1 cm path
length cuvettes as described previously [19]. CD measurements were conducted using a J-725 automatic spectropolarimeter. The unfolding reactions of proteins were
induced by a concentration jump in GdnHCl, with various differing concentrations. The protein solution was
stirred using a spinning mixer with a magnetic stirrer in a
cuvette with a 1 cm path length for the unfolding, and the
CD was recorded at 220 nm as a function of time. The
dead time of this method was 2 s. The protein solution
was stirred manually during use of a cuvette with a 2 mm
path length. The dead time of this method was 10 s. The
kinetic experiments were performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl,
200 mM NaCl at pH 7.5 for Tm-RNase HII, 20 mM Acetate-NaOH at pH 5.0 for Aa-RNase HII, and 20 mM Glycine-NaOH at pH 3.0 for Sto-RNase HI. The protein
concentrations when CD measurements were taken were
0.0338 to 0.169 mgmL-1. The kinetic data were analyzed
using Eq. (5).

examined. The rate constants for unfolding in the

to Eq. (6):

where [D] is the concentration of GdnHCl and mu represents the slopes of the linear correlations of ln ku with
the GdnHCl concentration.
