Abstract
Background: Human adenovirus type 37 (HAdV-37) is a major etiologic agent of epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis, a common and severe eye infection associated with long-term visual morbidity
due to persistent corneal inflammation. While HAdV-37 has been known for over 20 years as an
important cause, the complete genome sequence of this serotype has yet to be reported. A detailed
bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of HAdV-37 is extremely important to
understanding its unique pathogenicity in the eye.
Results: We sequenced and annotated the complete genome of HAdV-37, and performed
genomic and bioinformatics comparisons with other HAdVs to identify differences that might
underlie the unique corneal tropism of HAdV-37. Global pairwise genome alignment with HAdV9, a human species D adenovirus not associated with corneal infection, revealed areas of nonconserved sequence principally in genes for the virus fiber (site of host cell binding), penton (host
cell internalization signal), hexon (principal viral capsid structural protein), and E3 (site of several
genes that mediate evasion of the host immune system). Phylogenetic analysis revealed close
similarities between predicted proteins from HAdV-37 of species D and HAdVs from species B and
E. However, virtual 2D gel analyses of predicted viral proteins uncovered unexpected differences
in pI and/or size of specific proteins thought to be highly similar by phylogenetics.
Conclusion: This genomic and bioinformatics analysis of the HAdV-37 genome provides a valuable
tool for understanding the corneal tropism of this clinically important virus. Although disparities
between HAdV-37 and other HAdV within species D in genes encoding structural and host
receptor-binding proteins were to some extent expected, differences in the E3 region suggest as
yet unknown roles for this area of the genome. The whole genome comparisons and virtual 2D gel
analyses reported herein suggest potent areas for future studies.

Background
Adenoviruses (AdV) in the Adenoviridae family have been
divided into four genera: Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus,
Atadenovirus, and Siadenovirus [1]. The AdV was first isolated from human adenoids and characterized by two different research teams [2,3]. Human AdV (HAdV) fall
within the genus Mastadenovirus, and cause a wide array of
diseases including acute respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, and ocular surface infection [4-6]. The AdV is nonenveloped with a double stranded linear genome that
ranges from 26 to 45 kb in size. The icosahedral shaped
capsid ranges from 70 to 100 nanometers in diameter [7].
There are 51 known HAdV serotypes classified into 6 species (A-F), based on restriction enzyme analysis and
hemaglutination assays, later confirmed by genome analyses and phylogenetic calculations. Recently, a proposed
fifty-second HAdV serotype was identified and placed into
a new species G [8].
HAdV-37 was originally isolated in 1976 from 62 eyes and
9 genitourinary sites, and subsequently characterized as a
new serotype in 1981 [9]. HAdV-37 is a major etiologic
agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, an explosive and
highly contagious infection of the conjunctiva and cornea, and continues to cause outbreaks [10]. HAdV-37 also
was recently implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity
[11].
Although HAdV species D contains the most serotypes,
complete sequence is available for only 6 – HAdV-9,
HAdV-17, HAdV-26, HAdV-46, HAdV-48, and HAdV-49 –
and none of these have been associated with epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis. In this study, we have sequenced the
complete genome of HAdV-37 and describe its overall
organization. The HAdV-37 genome appears in most
respects typical of other HAdV. However, global pairwise
genome alignments, phylogenetic analyses, and in silico
comparisons of putative viral proteins revealed unique
characteristics of the genome, including areas of non-conserved sequence in the penton, hexon, E3, and fiber
regions, and differences in size and/or pI of select predicted HAdV-37 proteins. Understanding the disparities
between the HAdV-37 genome and those of species D
HAdV with dissimilar tissue tropisms may lead to
improved understanding of the genomic determinants of
infection.

Results
General features
The genome length of HAdV-37 was found to be 35,213
base pairs with a base composition of 22.8% A, 20.6% T,
28.3% C, 28.3% G. The 56.6% GC content is on the lower
end of the 57–59% range previously reported for HAdVs
within species D [7]. CpG dinucleotide analysis of HAdV37 performed using FUZZNUC software [12] revealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/213

2389 CpG dinucleotides located within the genome (data
not shown). We identified the predicted 4 early, 2 intermediate, and 5 late transcription regions similar to those
described in other completely sequenced HAdVs (Figure
1), including 35 predicted coding sequences within the
HAdV-37 genome and 8 hypothetical ORFs.
The 5' and 3' termini of the HAdV genome are composed
of inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences which for
HAdV-37 were determined to be 159 bp in length. These
sites serve as replication origins for the virus [7]. The motif
located at the extreme termini of the HAdV-37 genome
consists of a CATCATCATAAT, which is unique among
previously sequenced HAdV serotypes. Unique sequences
for the extreme termini have been also observed in other
HAdVs including HAdV-4 [13]. The conserved
ATAATATACC motif within the ITR, which interacts with
the terminal protein precursor (pTP) and polymerase
complex during DNA replication [14], was determined at
base pairs 8–17. A NFIII/Oct-1 recognition site (TATGCAAAT) was identified within the ITR of HAdV-37 at
nucleotides 40–48. A Sp1 binding site (GGGGCGGA) was
identified at nucleotides 73–80. Also, a NFI/CTFI
(TGGGGCGGAGCCA) site was located at overlapping
nucleotides 72–84.
Global pairwise alignment
The mVISTA Limited Area Global Alignment of Nucleotides (LAGAN) tool was used to align and compare
paired viral sequences [15]. We compared genomic
sequence correspondence across the whole genome of
HAdV-37 to representative HAdV serotypes from each of
the six HAdV species. Comparison of the HAdV-37
genome with that of HAdV-9, also within species D,
showed a much higher degree of conservation than with
representative HAdVs from other species, but demonstrated disparity in the penton, hexon, E3, and fiber
regions (Figure 2).
Early genes
E1A is the first transcriptional unit to be expressed during
infection [7]. A common RNA from this region is the
source of several alternatively spliced E1A transcripts [16].
The E1A proteins regulate the transcription of viral and
cellular genes [17,18]. Based on splice donor and acceptor
sites, two putative proteins of 253 and 191 amino acids
with corresponding molecular weights of 28.2 kDa and
21.2 kDa, respectively, were identified in the HAdV-37
genome (Table 1). The HAdV-37 E1A 21.2 kDa protein is
89% identical and 96% similar to the HAdV-9 homologue
(Table 2). A protein corresponding to the previously predicted 10S protein from previous studies of HAdVs was
not identified in our analysis. The predicted TATA box was
identified at nucleotide 477 and the polyadenylation signal predicted to be at position 1451.

The block arrows represent the predicted protein coding regions. The early transcription units (E1-E4) are highlighted. The late transcription units (L1-L5) are designated by parentheses.

E1B proteins potentiate viral replication by blocking
apoptosis. E1B 19K blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway by inactivating BAK and BAX [19]. E1B 55K
inhibits the ability of p53, the host tumor suppressor protein, to initiate cell cycle arrest [20,21]. The putative TATA
box for the E1B messages was predicted at nucleotide
1525. Two predicted proteins of molecular weights of
21.1 and 55.2 kDa were identified within E1B which correspond to 19- and 55-kDa proteins, respectively, as
reported for HAdV-9. Amino acid sequence analysis
revealed that the predicted 21.1 kDa protein was 99%
identical and 100% similar to the 19 kDa homologue
found in the HAdV-9 genome (Table 2). The polyadenylation signal for these transcripts was predicted at nucleotide 3863.
The E2 region of the genome consists of two transcription
units, E2A and E2B, which encode three proteins that are
required for viral replication [7]. These three proteins are
known as the DNA binding protein (DBP), terminal protein precursor (pTP), and DNA polymerase. The E2A 54.9
kDa DNA binding protein was identified on the comple-

mentary strand between nucleotides 21305 and 22777.
Also on the complementary strand, but located within the
E2B region, we identified the pTP and DNA polymerase.
The polyadenylation signal for these transcripts was not
identified.
The HAdV E3 region encodes proteins that modulate the
host immune response to infection but are not required
for viral growth in vitro [22,23]. HAdVs within species D
have previously been suggested to encode eight ORFs
within the E3 region [24,25]. Seven classical and one
hypothetical E3 ORFs were identified in our annotation of
HAdV-37. The predicted molecular weights for these are
12.2, 21.8, 18.6, 48.9, 31.6, 10.47, 14.7, and 14.8 kDa.
The TATA box was predicted at nucleotide 25879 with a
TATAAA motif. One polyadenylation signal for this transcription unit was identified at nucleotide 30837.
Open reading frames located in the E4 transcription unit
produce proteins that have a wide variety of functions
[26]. For example, E4 ORF 3 and E4 ORF 6 enhance the
stability of late viral mRNAs and increase their export

from the nucleus thereby increasing viral mRNA accumulation in the cytoplasm [26]. E4 ORF 6 also binds to p53
and can block apoptosis [27,28]. We found 6 predicted
ORFs in HAdV-37 located on the complementary strand.
Surprisingly, the E4 ORF 1 from the HAdV-37 genome
was predicted at 65 amino acids in length corresponding
to a molecular weight of 7.4 kDa. In contrast, the HAdV-9
homologue of E4 ORF 1 is 125 amino acids in length, and
contains three regions essential for tumor transformation
(region I, residues 34 to 41; region II, residues 89 to 91;
region III 122 to 125). The E4 ORF 1 of HAdV-9 has struc-

tural similarity to other viral dUTPase enzymes [29,30].
ClustalW analysis of the HAdV-37 E4 ORF 1 compared to
the HAdV-9 homologue revealed a 100% similarity from
residues 61–125, including regions II and III and a truncated dUTPase domain. Further work will be needed to
evaluate the significance of this truncation. The TATA box
for this region was identified at nucleotide 34665 and the
polyadenylation signal at nucleotide 32184.

Intermediate genes
The intermediate genes of HAdV are IVa2 and IX. The IVa2
protein interacts with L1 52/55K during viral DNA packaging, and assists in the activation of the major late promoter (MLP) [14,31-33]. The HAdV-37 IVa2 gene, found
on the complementary strand, was predicted using the
splice site finder [34], with a 448 amino acid protein and
99% amino acid homology to HAdV-9 IVa2. The IX protein is a minor capsid protein and also assists in the activation of the major late promoter [35,36]. A coding

sequence for a 13.7 kDa protein corresponding to IX was
found at nucleotides 3454–3858.
Late genes
The late transcription units of HAdVs are transcribed from
the MLP, which consists of an inverted CAAT box (5777–
5780 bp) and TATA box (5827–5832 bp). The late
mRNAs have been grouped into five families (L1 to L5),
based on the location of the polyadenylation signal. Proteins expressed by these five families are involved in cap-

sid production for mature virions [7]. The L1 transcription
unit encodes two proteins, 52/55K and IIIa. The 52/55K
protein is involved in scaffolding of the capsid and therefore facilitates virus assembly [37]. The 52/55K protein
also interacts with the intermediate gene product IVa2 to
facilitate DNA packaging [31,33,38]. Polypeptide IIIa is a
structural protein that has been located on the inner capsid surface below the penton base [39]. The 52/55K and
polypeptide IIIa in HAdV-37 were predicted to have
molecular weights of 42.2 kDa and 26.6 kDa, respectively.
The predicted polyadenylation signal for the L1 region
was found at nucleotide 13484.
The proteins encoded on the L2 transcription unit also are
involved in capsid formation [7]. The penton base (protein III) is found at each of the 12 vertices of the virion [7].
The penton base contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
sequence which interacts with host integrins to induce
internalization of the virus [40]. The HAdV-37 penton
base is located at nucleotides 13530–15089. The length of
the protein was predicted to be 519 amino acids with an
estimated molecular weight of 58.4 kDa. The RGD
sequence was located at amino acid position 309–311.
The predicted protein was 100% identical to the previously published penton base protein identified for HAdV37 [41]. The HAdV-37 penton base homologue is 90%
identical and 95% similar to the predicted HAdV-9 penton base protein (Table 2). The V, VII, and X proteins constitute the HAdV core proteins and facilitate packaging of
viral DNA within the capsid [42]. The HAdV-37 pVII protein-coding sequence was identified at nucleotides
15093–15683, and the protein was predicted to have a
molecular weight of 21.7 kDa. Proteins with an amino
acid length of 334 and 74 were predicted in the HAdV-37
genome for proteins V and X at nucleotides 15716–16720

and 16750–16974, respectively. The L2 transcripts share a
putative polyadenylation signal at nucleotide 16982.
Three open reading frames corresponding to pVI, hexon,
and protease proteins, with respective molecular weights
of 25.5, 106.8, and 23.4 kDa, were identified within the
L3 transcription unit. The pVI protein contains two
nuclear export signals and two nuclear localization signals, and plays a role in transporting the hexon protein to
the nucleus for viral assembly [43]. The C terminus of this
protein has also been implicated in regulation of the viral
protease [44]. The HAdV-37 pVI protein was located at
nucleotides 17030–17734. This predicted 234 amino acid
protein was 100% identical to its HAdV-17 homologue.
The hexon protein, the most abundant virion component,
constitutes 240 of the 252 subunits of the protein shell of
the virus [7]. The HAdV-37 hexon protein is 949 amino
acids in length and was nearly identical to that predicted
by Ebner et al. [45]. Our sequence data suggests an additional 10 amino acids on the N-terminus of the protein,
similar to the predicted hexon gene for HAdV-46 and
HAdV-9, both within species D. The final protein encoded
in the L3 transcription unit is the 23 kDa viral protease
protein. The HAdV-37 homologue was predicted to be
207 amino acids in length. This protein cleaves other viral
proteins allowing for assembly and viral maturation [46],
and the transcript shares a predicted polyadenylation signal at nucleotide 21256 with other L3 transcripts.
Three L4 proteins, 100 kDa, pVIII, and 22 kDa, were predicted from our annotation. The 100 kDa protein is a nonstructural protein that assists in the translation of late viral
mRNAs, and inhibits translation of cellular mRNAs
[47,48]. More recently this protein has been implicated as
a scaffold for trimerization of the hexon [49]. The pre-

dicted 100 kDa protein for HAdV-37 genome was 732
amino acids in length and had a molecular weight of 82.3
kDa. This protein is 98% identical to the published HAdV46 100 kDa protein. Protein VIII is a minor capsid protein
that plays a role in the stability of the virion capsid [50].
The pVIII protein of HAdV-37 is 24.6 kDa in molecular
weight and has a 99% identity to the published HAdV-46
pVIII protein. The 22 kDa protein is involved in the packaging of HAdV DNA [51]. A 22 kDa homologue was identified in HAdV-37 with a predicted protein of 137 amino
acids and molecular weight of 15.8 kDa. Its highest percent identity was to the HAdV-9 22 kDa protein (99%).
The predicted polyadenylation signal for the L4 transcription unit is at nucleotide 26507.
The L5 region of the HAdV genome consists entirely of the
fiber protein gene. Fiber protein trimerizes to produce the
functional unit which projects from the 12 penton vertices
of the virus capsid. The fiber protein's carboxyl (C)-terminal globular domain, known as the fiber knob, acts as the
primary ligand for host cell receptor binding. The HAdV37 fiber genome sequence was previously reported, and
our predicted protein of 365 amino acids was identical
[52]. The HAdV-37 fiber was only 76% identical and 89%
similar to its homologue in the HAdV-9 genome (Table
2). The polyadenylation signal for this transcript was predicted at nucleotide 32143. Nucelotide sequence encoding a potential heparan binding site, previously reported
in the fiber shaft of HAdV-5, was not present in the HAdV37 fiber gene [53-55].
Virus-associated RNA
Most HAdVs contain two virus-associated (VA) RNA
genes, VA RNAI and VA RNAII. VA RNAI acts against cellular antiviral defense by blocking the activation of the
protein kinase PKR, which when activated turns off protein synthesis in infected cells [56]. VA RNAII binds to
RNA helicase A and NF90, the latter a component of the
nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) [57]. These VA
RNAs also have been recently shown to suppress RNA
interference [58]. The VA RNA genes for HAdV-37 were
previously identified [59]. Our sequence for VA RNAI is
located at nucleotides 10253–10410 and is 99% identical
to the previously reported sequence, differing by only one
base pair. VA RNAII is located at nucleotides 10471–
10620 and was 100% identical to that previously
reported.
Protein and phylogenetic analysis
The annotation of the HAdV-37 genome allows for its
comparison with other HAdV serotypes within species D
as well as serotypes from other species. Percent identity
and similarity of predicted proteins from each of the
major transcription units were identified for representative serotypes using Fasta3 [60], and are shown in Table 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/213

In this analysis, highest identities outside of species D
were seen with species B (HAdV-7) and species E (HAdV4) viruses. Projected protein sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 3.1. Bootstrap
confirmed neighbor joining trees also suggested that outside of HAdV species D, the serotypes phylogenetically
closest to HAdV-37 were within HAdV species B and E
(Figure 3). We further selected specific proteins for analysis by virtual 2D gel (JVirGel 2.2.3b) [61,62], based on
ClustalW alignments of predicted protein amino acid
sequences comparing serotypes from different HAdV species. The accuracy of these virtual 2D gels with regards to
pI has been judged to be within ± 1 pI unit of the true
migration of the physical protein, even when subsequent
post-translational modifications are taken into account
[61,63,64].
Migration patterns for select protein homologues in the
virtual 2D gel showed projected differences in size and/or
pI (See Additional file 1: Supplemental figure 4). The
HAdV-37 DNA binding protein migrated to a predicted
molecular weight of 54.9 kDa and a pI of 8.52 (Table 3
and Additional file 1). The range of pI for the DNA binding protein among all serotypes tested was from 6.30 to
8.57. The DNA polymerase homologues also revealed
substantial differences in predicted size among the
selected serotypes, and a range in pI from 6.19 to 8.18
(Table 3). HAdV-37 and HAdV-9 polymerase both
migrated to a predicted molecular weight of 125 kDa with
pI's of 6.28 and 6.19, respectively. The HAdV-40 homologue had a predicted pI of 8.14. The predicted molecular
weights of the penton and hexon proteins differed
between serotypes by less than 10 kDa, with a pI range
that was probably within the range of accuracy of the software (Table 3 and additional file 1). The L3 protease
homologues migrated to almost identical areas on the virtual gel (Additional file 1), consistent with very high percent similarity between HAdV-37 protease and the other
homologues (93 to 100%, Table 2). In contrast, despite
high percent similarity in the pVIII protein between
HAdV-37 and HAdV-4 (94%), the predicted HAdV-37
pVIII migrated to a pI of 8.80, while the HAdV-4 pVIII
migrated to a pI of 6.22 (Table 2 and Additional file 1).
Further review of the ClustalW alignment for these 2
homologues revealed that despite their high similarity,
there were 3 specific amino acid differences in HAdV-37
that when changed to match the residues in HAdV-4,
resulted in a pI for HAdV-37 of 5.78 (G46D, Q57E,
Q172E, data not shown).
Hypothetical proteins
During annotation of HAdV-37, we located 8 hypothetical
ORFs similar to ORFs predicted from sequences previously archived in GenBank for other HAdVs (Table 4),

with a blast value for each of less than e-5. GeneMark identified one of these putative proteins (HAdV-7 13.6 kDa
agnoprotein), and JCVI's annotation engine identified
another (E3B 31.6 kDa), while the rest were identified by
NCBI's ORF finder. Four of the 8 proteins were located on
the complementary strand and 5 were clustered in the area
between the intermediate and late ORFs.

Discussion
We have determined the complete 35,213 base pair
genome of HAdV-37 and identified 35 putative adenoviral genes along with 8 hypothetical ORFs conserved with
at least one other HAdV for each ORF. Comparison of the
HAdV-37 genome to that of HAdV-9, another species D
virus, identified areas of substantial divergence in the penton, hexon, E3, and fiber regions. Disparities between
these two HAdV species D viruses in genes encoding struc-

tural and host receptor-binding proteins were somewhat
expected and also consistent with known differences in
host tissue tropism, for example the propensity of HAdV37 to cause corneal infection, as compared to the association of HAdV-9 with urethritis and follicular conjunctivitis [7,65]. Differences between HAdV-9 and 37 in the E3
region, known to be important to immune evasion and
regulation by the virus, but not essential to viral replication in vitro, suggest as yet undiscovered functions for this
region [22,23]. Divergence in the E3 region, possibly relevant to cellular and tissue specificity during infection,
might be due to positive selection. Sequencing of other
HAdVs within species D would provide further insight
into this area of the HAdV genome.
By phylogenetic analyses and paired comparisons of predicted proteins, HAdV-37 and HAdV-9 of species D
appeared most closely related to HAdV-7 of species B and
HAdV-4 of species E. Subsequent virtual 2D gel analyses
suggested that for a few proteins, a relatively few amino
acid substitutions between otherwise similar proteins
conferred significant effects on protein charge. If our analyses prove correct, such differences suggest that the function of such proteins in HAdV species D could be quite
different than previously described for serotypes of other
HAdV species. We acknowledge that our predictions represent a first approximation of protein characteristics, and
could be subject to over-interpretation for at least two reasons. First, our comparisons to other viruses are only as

reliable as the quality of GenBank viral sequence and
annotation. Secondly, post-translational modifications
may alter both charge and molecular weight of any given
protein. Actual 2D gel analysis will be necessary to confirm such predicted differences.
There is growing concern over the accuracy of in silico ORF
prediction in AdVs due to splice variants, as well as inconsistencies in banked annotations [66]. To address such
concerns, we compared HAdV-37 annotation using three
different methods: NCBI ORF finder, JCVI's annotation
engine, and GeneMark Heuristic model. We narrowed our
annotation to 35 ORFs by comparison with previously
determined adenoviral annotations, but we consider our
annotation provisional. We identified 8 hypothetical
ORFs similar to those previously identified in other HAdV
species. The very suggestion of hypothetical proteins
implies that our understanding of the HAdV is far from
complete. Transcriptome analysis using viral microarrays
may help to clarify the best annotation [67]. We suggest
that the true transcriptome and proteome of HAdV-37
remain to be determined.
Future sequencing of HAdVs may permit new insights into
viral origin, evolution, and pathogenesis. Recently, HAdV22 was isolated for the first time from an outbreak of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. The HAdV-22 isolate was
shown to contain both HAdV-8 fiber gene and HAdV-37
penton base gene [68]. These recombination events

apparently conferred corneal tropism to HAdV-22, a virus
not normally known to infect the cornea. As more HAdV
species D viruses are sequenced, new insights into tropism
and pathogenesis are likely to emerge.

Conclusion
In summary, the complete genome sequence of HAdV-37
was determined and annotated. The organization of the
HAdV-37 genome is similar to other human species D
adenoviruses except in the penton, hexon, E3, and fiber
regions. Phylogenetic analysis of HAdV-37 proteins
revealed close relation to species B and E human adenoviruses, while virtual 2D gel analysis identified differences
in proteins thought to function similarly. The availability
of the HAdV-37 complete genome sequence will facilitate
future studies into the pathogenicity of this important
human pathogen.

Methods
Cells, virus stock, DNA purification
HAdV-37 strain GW was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Virus stocks were grown
in A-549 cells (CCL-185), a human alveolar epithelial cell
line that was previously shown to support HAdV-1 virion
production [69]. Virus was purified by CsCl gradient and
subsequent dialysis, and stored at -80°C. DNA extraction
was accomplished by the addition of proteinase K, phenol:chloroform extraction, and finally ethanol precipitation.
Sequencing
Standard PCR methodology was used to amplify regions
of the genome to be sequenced. HAdV type 17 was used as
a reference strain for the design of initial PCR primers. To
close gaps in the sequence and improve overall sequence
quality, Primer 3 [70] and CONSED [71] software were
used to design primers from newly acquired sequence.
Shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I treatment
were used to dephosphorylate and degrade residual PCR
primers present together with the PCR products. Sequencing was performed using the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1
cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The sequencing reaction mixture was purified using
Sephadex G-50 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and the
reaction products analyzed on ABI 3700 or ABI 3730 XL
capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems). To sequence the viral inverted terminal repeat
(ITR) ends, primers were designed from newly determined adjacent sequence, and direct sequencing was performed using whole genome DNA as the template [69].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/213

assembly contained 664 high quality reads with an average length of 834 bps. The fold coverage for both strands
of the genome was 15. The Phrap average quality score
was 89.0. Genome annotation was performed using JCVI's
automated annotation system [74], and the data was
stored in a MySQL database. Manatee [75] was used to
manually review the data from the annotation engine.
Additionally, we used GeneMark Heuristic Models gene
prediction [76], and NCBI's ORF Finder [77] to examine
the sequence. Open reading frames were searched against
available databases in GenBank, PIR, SWISS-PROT, and
JCVI's CMR database. Splice sites were predicted using a
splice site finder program [34]. An online sequence alignment program, mVISTA LAGAN [78] was used for global
pair-wise sequence alignment [15]. CpG analysis was performed with FUZZNUC [12].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The nucleotide sequence for the following HAdVs can be
found in GenBank: HAdV-2 [AC_000007], HAdV-4
[AY487947], HAdV-7 [AC_000018], HAdV-9 [AJ854486],
HAdV-12 [AC_000005], HAdV-17 [AC_000006], HAdV40 [L19443]. Previously sequenced HAdV-37 penton base
protein, hexon protein, fiber protein, and VA RNA gene
accession numbers are AAG00906, ABA00016,
AAB71734, and U10679, respectively. The GenBank
accession number for HAdV-37 is DQ900900.
In silico protein analysis
Percent identities and similarities between proteins of
HAdV-37 and other HAdVs were determined using Fasta3
[60,79] and Blastp software [80]. Proteins from the GenBank database were analyzed by an in silico 2D gel program JVirGel 2.2.3b [61]. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
(MEGA) 3.1 [81]. Bootstrap confirmed neighbor joining
phylogenetic trees were designed with MEGA 3.1 with 500
replicates.
