Abstract
Background: The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family represents the largest and most
important group of targets for chemotherapeutics. They are extremely versatile receptors that
transduce signals as diverse as biogenic amines, purins, odorants, ions and pheromones from the
extracellular compartment to the interior via biochemical processes involving GTP-binding
proteins. Until recently, the cyclic AMP receptors (cARs) were the only known G protein coupled
receptors in Dictyostelium discoideum. The completed genome sequence revealed the presence of
several families of GPCRs in Dictyostelium, among them members of the family 3 of GPCRs, the
GABAB/glutamate like receptor family, which in higher eukaryotes is involved in neuronal signaling.
Results: D. discoideum has seventeen Family 3 members of GPCRs, denoted GrlA through GrlR.
Their transcripts are detected throughout development with increased levels during early and late
development. We have examined here GrlJ. GFP-tagged GrlJ localises to the plasmamembrane and
to internal membranes. Inactivation of the grlJ gene leads to precocious development, and the
mutant completes development ~6 hours earlier. Alterations were also noted at the slug stage and
in spore formation. grlJ- slugs were longer and broke apart several times on their way to culmination
forming smaller but proportionate fruiting bodies. Spores from grlJ- fruiting bodies were malformed
and less viable, although the spore differentiation factors were synthesized and sensed normally.
Expression of a GFP-tagged full length GrlJ rescued the phenotype.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that GrlJ acts at several stages of Dictyostelium development and
that it is a negative regulator in Dictyostelium development.

Background
The seven-transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) represent a major group of cell-surface
detectors and constitute 3.5 % of the genome in verte-

brates [1]. They play a key role in the physiology of multicellular organisms as they transduce a broad variety of
extracellular signals into the cell. Of the 1000 genes
thought to encode GPCRs in humans, about 300–400

mediate effects by endogeneous ligands, with the remainder being sensory receptors. GPCRs can be grouped into
six families based on the sequence similarity of their common heptahelical domain (7TM). Four of the families are
present in Dictyostelium discoideum.
D. discoideum, a soil-living amoeba feeds on bacteria in
decaying vegetation and reproduces by binary fission.
Growing amoebae chemotax toward folic acid and other
nutrients, whereas starved cells aggregate by chemotaxis
toward cAMP. cAMP is sensed by cAMP-receptors, which
form an unusual family of GPCRs [2]. Signalling via cARs
is mediated by Gα2, one of the 14 Gα proteins of D. discoideum, however, many cAMP responses are also independent of G proteins [3]. Several other signaling
molecules such as cell density factors, folate and related
pterins, LPA (lysophosphatidic acid), PSF (prestarvation
factor), CF (conditioned media factor), small metabolites
and numerous small peptides are known to be acting via
GPCRs as well [4,5]. Their receptors have not been identified so far.
The family 3 (or C) of GPCRs contains receptors for a wide
range of signals: for the main neurotransmitters glutamate
and γ-aminobutyric acid, for Ca2+, for sweet and amino
acid taste compounds, for pheromones and for odorants.
Accordingly they fall into six groups, the metabotropic
glutamate receptors, the Ca2+-sensing receptors, the γ-aminobutyric acidB receptors, the pheromone receptors, the
sweet and amino acid receptors and the orphan family 3
receptors. They possess a seven transmembrane domain
(HD or 7TM) responsible for G-protein activation, and a
large extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding.
This domain is similar to bacterial periplasmic proteins
that are involved in the transport of small molecules, and
is called Venus Flytrap module (VFTM). The metabotropic
GABAB/glutamate like receptor family was considered animal-specific and was not found outside the metazoan
branch until the Dictyostelium genome was sequenced
[2,6,7]. Altogether, 17 genes encoding GABAB like receptors were identified based on the homology of the HD.
They are named GrlA through GrlR (GABAB or metabotropic glutamate – receptors like) proteins (Dale Hereld,
Dictyostelium Genomics, 2005).
In the present study we undertook an investigation of
GrlJ, located on chromosome 2 [6]. GrlJ is expressed
throughout growth and development with a strong
increase in development. It has a crucial role at several
stages of development leading to precocious development, the formation of longer slugs that break apart several times while migrating and to the production of spores
that have an abnormal morphology and exhibit reduced
viability.

Results
Dictyostelium family 3 of GPCRs
The Dictyostelium genome possesses 17 genes encoding
receptors belonging to the Family 3 of GPCRs and all of
them resemble GABAB or metabotropic glutamate likereceptors [2]. They are represented as Grl (metabotropic
GABAB or glutamate – receptor like) proteins. Grl encoding genes are present on all chromosomes. Some of them
such as GrlA, B and O are close together. Their molecular
masses range from 78.000 for GrlL to 181.000 for GrlR.
However most of them have masses below 100.000 and
only GrlP, Q and R are significantly larger. The increase in
mass is mainly due to an extended N-terminal region.
Most of them have a signalpeptide and a BMP (basic
membrane protein) domain in their amino terminal
region, a domain which was first found in outer membrane proteins of bacteria, and which is similar to the
VFTM that forms the ligand binding site in the N-termini
of metabotropic GPCRs [8]. Exceptions are GrlE, N, P, Q
and R (Table 1). The N-terminal region of GrlE has
homology to the mouse and the Dorsophila glutamate
receptor and was identified as a true GABA receptor in D.
discoideum [9,10]. GrlP, Q and R have a region of homology with Chlamydia polymorphic membrane protein in
their amino terminal sequences.

In a phylogenetic tree that was constructed using the full
length sequences of all Grl receptors three major clusters
were formed, consisting of GrlA, B, F, J in one group, GrlP,
Q, R forming the second and GrlC, D, G, H, K and M
forming the third and largest one. Four of the Grls (GrlO,
GrlE, GrlN and GrlL) diverted out separately (Fig. 1).
When analysing the transcript levels of all Grls throughout the developmental stages by semiquantitative RT-PCR
analysis we detected the transcripts for all genes at all
times. We found increased levels from early aggregation
(GrlA, D, E, J, M, N, Q) or the tight aggregation stage
onward (GrlB, C, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, R), when the contact
site A is expressed. The levels stayed high during late
development and transcripts were clearly present at t24
when fruiting body formation is close to completion.
GrlA transcripts were still quite abundant at this stage
(Table 2). Additionally we quantified the mRNA amounts
for GrlJ using the actin mRNA for comparison. We found
that the GrlJ message is of very low abundance throughout
development ranging from 2.8 to 11.1 pg, whereas for
actin we obtained amounts between 382 and 605 pg in
these samples (Table 3).
GrlJ is a 783 amino acid containing protein possessing a
typical signal sequence for secretion followed by a Bmp
(Basic membrane protein) domain and a seven transmembrane domain. The fold of the Bmp domain is similar to the fold of the bacterial periplasmic binding
proteins (PBP) which function in scavenging or sensing

nutrients in the environment [11]. Sequences coding for
PBP domains can occur in combination with diverse
sequences coding for integral membrane domains. In 7
transmembrane receptors they act as the extracellular ligand binding site such as in the Glutamate/glycine gated
channels, metabotropic glutamate/GABAB, Ca2+sensing,
pheromone and atrial natriuretic peptide-receptors [12].
While the full length sequence of GrlJ appears closer to
GABAB receptors than other characterised members of the
family 3, a detailed analysis revealed that the similarity
was pertaining specifically to the transmembrane regions
(Fig. 2A–C). GrlJ clustered more closely to the GABABR2
subtypes in a phylogentic analysis that was performed
with only the transmembrane domains (Fig. 2D). 13
members of the Dictyostelium Family 3 GPCRs share this
domain organisation with GrlJ. GrlN, P, Q and R are different (Table 1).
Subcellular localisation of GrlJ
The subcellular localisation of GrlJ was studied by expressing a full-length GrlJ-GFP fusion protein. The expression
of the fusion protein was under control of the actin15 promoter which is a strong promoter and will lead to an overexpression. GrlJ-GFP was present at the plasma
membrane, the majority of the protein was however
found on internal structures. At the plasma membrane
GrlJ-GFP overlapped to a good extent with Annexin C1, a
protein present at the plasma membrane and at internal
membranes [13,14]. In the cell there was partial colocalisation with interaptin, a protein found at the nuclear
envelope and the ER [15] (Fig. 3A). We also monitored for
colocalisation of GrlJ-GFP with antibodies against VatA,

which is present on endosomal membranes and the contractile vacuole of D. discoideum (A subunit of vacuolar
ATPase) [16], lysosomal antigen (mannose-6-sulfate containing carbohydrate epitope present in lysosomal
enzymes) [17]], and Vacuolin [18], a protein on post lysosomal vacuoles. However, we did not note colocalisation
with any of these proteins (data not shown). The presence
of GrlJ-GFP on ER- and Golgi-membranes may may reflect
the transport pathway of the protein towards the plasma
membrane. An analysis of the GrlJ-GFP localisation during development (6 h and 16 h) did not indicate changes
in its subcellular distribution (data not shown). Western
blot analysis of subcellular fractions of GrlJ-GFP expressing cells supported a membrane association as GrlJ-GFP
was exclusively present in the 100.000 g pellet like the
Golgi component comitin (Fig. 3B).
GrlJ gene disruption and mutant behaviour
To gain insight into the in vivo functions of GrlJ, mutants
carrying a disruption of the grlJ gene were generated (Fig.
4). Growth of grlJ- was not affected and the mutant
reached slightly higher cell densities when grown in suspension culture in axenic medium as compared to the
wild type A×2 (Fig. 5). On a lawn of Klebsiella aerogenes
growth was comparable. Cytokinesis and cell size were
unaltered in the mutant as well.

As GrlJ is expressed throughout the development with a
induction of the expression at later developmental stages
we studied whether its loss affects development of the
mutant. Starvation was carried out on phosphate agar
plates. grlJ- cells aggregated well and formed mounds similar to the wild type cells but exhibited an accelerated

of prestalk specific genes may be explained by the findings
that they are regulated by different transcription factors
[19]. We also tested aggregation in monolayer and
observed timely formation of aggregation centres with
thick streams for grlJ- comparable to the wild type cells
(data not shown). Expression of GrlJ-GFP in the mutant
led to normal progression during development (Fig. 6).
The chemotactic response to folate in D. discoideum
requires G-proteins and is expected to be mediated by a
yet unidentified GPCR. When we tested GrlJ null cells they
responded normally to folate both during growth and
development.
Premature expression of adhesion proteins in grlJDictyostelium multicellularity is maintained by expression
of several cell adhesion systems. During the initiation of
development, DdCAD-1 (gp24), a small, secreted glycoprotein, mediates EDTA-sensitive cell-cell adhesion
[20,21]. At the onset of aggregation, expression of contact
sites A (csA)/gp80 leads to EDTA-resistant cell-cell adhesion [22,23], and gp150/LagC mediates EDTA-resistant
cell-cell adhesion in the post-aggregation stages [24,25].
The temporal regulation of expression was not altered in
the GrlJ- strain. DdCAD-1 was expressed throughout the
developmental timecourse followed by csA at the onset of
starvation and LagC. For csA and LagC we noticed however comparatively higher levels at the onset of aggregation (4 h time point) (Fig. 8). These observations may be
explained by data from csA mutant analysis that suggested
that the expression of one cell adhesion molecule is coupled to the transcriptional control of another [25]. The
time point of early aggregation was not noticeably altered
in GrlJ-.

development after the aggregation stage and slugs were
formed at 12 h, culminated at 16 h and formed relatively
smaller fruiting bodies within 18 to 20 h (Fig. 6). The
expression pattern of cell-type specific developmental
markers confirmed these observations. The pattern of
transcription for the early aggregation specific genes car1
and acaA was similar in wild type and mutant. There was
however an accelerated expression of the prestalk specific
gene ecmB and another prestalk specific gene, carB (car2),
whereas the levels of ecmA and the prespore specific pspA
transcripts were timely (Fig. 7A). The different regulation

undergo characteristic changes and differentiate into different cell types which sort to specific regions in the multicellular organism. We also generated A×2 and grlJ strains carrying plasmids that allowed the expression of
the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the ecmO
and pspA promoter (pspA-Gal, ecmO-Gal) to study pattern
formation during development. The EcmO promoter is
active in a subpopulation of the prestalk cells, pspA is a
well characterised prespore specific marker [26]. We did
not note significant differences in the staining pattern of
the β-galactosidase driven by either promoter between the
mutant and wild-type strains pointing at the defect in the
timing of the expression of the developmental markers
but not in pattern formation (Fig. 7B).

tively more motile than the prespore cells and they form
the tip of the slug acting as a signalling centre and organiser [27]. A very high level of interaction and coordination
occurs between the two cell types in the migrating slugs
and they have to make a coordinated decision about the
right time to stop migration and start culmination [28].
The grlJ- strain produced slightly longer slugs (Fig. 9A),
which could sense light and phototax. However, they did
not migrate as far as wild type slugs and migrated with a
wider angle towards the light (59° +/-12) in comparison
to the wild type (27° +/-9). Furthermore, we observed the
breaking up of slugs in the grlJ- strain, which is clearly
viewed in the enlarged version indicated by the arrows
pointing towards the breaks just in the path of one migrating slug (Fig. 9B). This pattern was observed for most of
the slugs traced. We applied live cell microscopy wherein

we captured time-lapse images of the grlJ- development
and compared it with the wild-type development (Fig.
10A,B). The slugs indeed broke several times on their way
while migrating.
Defective sporulation in grlJSporulation is a tightly controlled process that involves
cell-type differentiation with morphogenesis wherein the
prespore cells appear early in development and progressively accumulate components of the spore coat in prespore vesicles which are secreted to assemble the spore
coat during encapsulation [29]. Most of the strains that
complete development faster produce abnormal spores
with reduced viability [30]. Because lack of GrlJ resulted in
precocious development following mound formation we
studied the spore morphology by staining spores with calcofluor, a fluorescent compound that selectively binds to
cellulose present in the spore coat. A×2 cells produced
well-elongated slightly banana-shaped spores, whereas
35–40% of grlJ- spores were round or misshaped. The
abnormality in the spore morphology was complemented
by the expression of GrlJ-GFP in the mutant (Fig. 11).

The spore viability in the mutants was analysed and compared with A×2 wild type by plating equal amounts of
axenically growing cells on phosphate agar plates and
allowing them to develop for 48 hours until spore formation was complete. Spores were harvested and counted to
determine the number of spores produced in comparison
to the initial number of cells plated. Additionally detergent resistance was checked. The wild type cells showed
recovery of 135 % spores from the cells initially plated

SDF-2 in grlJ- and found that it not only produced comparable levels of both factors but also responded to these factors by inducing sporulation as in wild type (Table 5).
SDF-2 is homologous to the human diazepam binding
inhibitor (DBI) neuropeptides [32], which can bind to
GABAB receptors. GABA and glutamate were recently
reported to be involved in the regulation of spore formation as inducer and inhibitor, respectively [9]. Both molecules seem to act through GrlE, another member of the
family 3 of GPCRs, leading to the induction or inhibition
of SDF-2 formation. Some GPCRs of the family 3 form
homodimers while others form obligatory heterodimers.
The response to GABA and glutamate of GrlJ null cells was
therefore tested in a spore formation assay (Table 5). grlJ responded to both GABA and glutamate like the wild type
cells ruling out the possibility of being a receptor for either
signals and of forming obligatory heterodimers with GrlE.

GFP sequences in such a way that GFP was present at the Cterminus of GrlJ. Shown are grlJ- cells expressing GrlJ-GFP.
The cells were fixed with cold methanol and stained for

and they were all viable and resistant to detergent treatment. grlJ - also produced spores comparable to the wild
type spores (144 %) per cells originally plated. However,
fewer spores were viable in grlJ - (~30 % reduction) and
they were comparatively more sensitive to detergent treatment. This defect in the viability could be rescued by
expressing GrlJ-GFP in grlJ - cells (Table 4).
Spore formation is controlled by two peptides, spore differentiation factor 1 and 2 (SDF-1 and SDF-2). SDF-1
accumulates during the slug stage and is released in a single burst at the onset of culmination, whereas SDF-2 is
released at the mid-culmination stage also in a single
burst [31]. We assayed for the production of SDF-1 and

The Dictyostelium repertoire of seven transmembrane
receptors has been discussed repeatedly [7,33]. Here we
have focused specifically on the family 3 and carried out
additional analysis using all currently available data
which allowed a much more detailed description of the
proteins than had been possible before (Table 1). Our further studies were concerned with GrlJ.
Lack of GrlJ alters the developmental pattern from the
post-aggregation stages onwards. The grlJ- strain aggregates
well and forms mounds at a fairly comparable time as the
wild type cells. There is a boost in the development thereon and the grlJ- strain forms mature fruiting bodies
before 18–20 h of starvation. The precocious development was reflected at the protein and mRNA level of postaggregative genes. Previous studies have found that the
expression of post-aggregation genes is directly controlled
by the G-Box binding factor GBF [34]. The increase in the
expression level of the cell adhesion molecule LagC in the
absence of GrlJ suggests that GrlJ normally acts as a negative regulator of development possibly through down regulation of GBF activity. Precocious development has been
noted in a variety of D. discoideum mutants. Many of them
are affected in the cAMP metabolism [35], others like
DmtA, DimA and DimB code for components of the DIF
signaling pathway [36-38], or are directly involved in
spore formation [39].
Several precociously developing strains such as regA- or
rdeA- are sporogenous and end up forming spores with
abnormal morphology [40]. The rdeA null strain forms
round spores but only when the vegetative cells were
grown in the presence of glucose as carbon source [41]. In
general, precocious sporulation is mediated by an increase
in the intracellular cAMP levels or occurs in strains with an
increased PKA activity [30,42]. grlJ- produced similar

Generation of grlJ- strains. (A) Targeting vector and recombination strategy. Gene disruption vector for GrlJ: The neomycin resistance cassette (2.2 kb) was obtained from pDNeo2 by EcoRV digestion and cloned into the EcoRV site of the GrlJ
gene that was present in the pGEMTeasy vector and the DNA fragment was used for transfection of A×2 cells. (B, C) Confirmation of the recombination event. The recombination event of grlJ- was analysed by Southern blotting. Transformants
were selected with 4 µg/ml G418 for Neomycin resistance. Single colonies were obtained by spreader dilution of the whole
pool of transformants onto SM agar plates overlaid with Klebsiella areogenes. Single transformants were then grown with the
respective selection medium in a 96-well plate and eventually transferred to a 24-well plate and a 6-well plate. The amoebae
were spread on K. aerogenes again and used to isolate genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis. The DNA was digested with
either BglII (B) that has recognition sites in the GrlJ gene near the N terminus and 3' of the end of the gene or with EcoRI (C)
that has recognition sites outside of the GrlJ gene. Separation of the DNA was in agarose gels (0.7 % agarose). The resulting
blot was probed with a C-terminal probe indicated by a bar. WT, A×2; C9 and A4, two independent transformants.

numbers of spores as A×2 wild type, they were however
less viable both with and without treatment with detergent pointing to an inefficient maturation. The grlJ- cells
produced also comparable amounts of the spore differentiation factors SDF-1 and SDF-2 at different culminating
stages and were also able to induce sporulation in
response to these factors. Likewise, sporulation in grlJ- in
response to GABA and glutamate was unaltered.
Our current understanding of GrlJ suggests a role in events
pertaining to post-aggregation development in Dictyostelium as a negative regulator of development. GrlJ is not
involved in GABA, glutamate or folate mediated signalling. However, there are many unexplored molecules and
secreted factors that are known to act via GPCRs and any
amongst them may be a putative ligand for the receptor
under investigation or other yet unexplored GPCRs. Such
compounds isolated from Dictyostelium are for instance
the acylated amino sugar derivatives furanodictine A and
B possessing neuronal differentiation activity in rat PC-12
cells [43]. Other interesting candidates are the acyl alpha
pyronoids having inhibitory effects on the development
of Dictyostelium [44]. However not much is known about
the mechanisms involved therein, but GrlJ can be a putative candidate receptor for any one of these compounds as
the loss of GrlJ prevents a regulatory mechanism which is
normally occuring and ensuring the correct developmental timing of morphogenetic events. In this respect GrlJ
seems to resemble its mammalian counterparts of metabotropic GPCRs which are involved in inhibitory signaling
in the brain.

Development on phosphate agar plates
Development on phosphate agar plates. Axenically
grown cells (A×2, grlJ- and grlJ- expressing GrlJ-GFP) were
plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/cm2 and were monitored
throughout development. Images were captured every 4
hours using a stereomicroscope. The mutant develops faster
after the aggregation stage and forms slugs already after 12
hours of development. Reexpression of GrlJ-GFP in grlJrestored the development. Bar, 1 mm.

Conclusion
GrlJ is a seven transmembrane protein belonging to the
family3 of GPCRs, that contains the GABAB/glutamate
like receptor family. In the brain GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter
and signals through ionotropic and metabotropic receptor systems At its N-terminus it carries a BMP-domain
which is characteristic for most of the members of this
family and is also found in the mammalian homologs.
GrlJ transcripts are present throughout Dictyostelium
development, GFP-tagged GrlJ localises to the plasma
membranes and to internal membranes in the perinuclear
area which partially overlap with ER membranes. GrlJ
deficient cells showed a precocious development indicative of an inhibitory role of GrlJ during this stage of development. Alterations were also observed during later
development and resulted in defective slug formation and

1.2 % agarose gels under denaturing conditions (6% formaldehyde) and transferred to membranes as described [54].
cDNA probes specific for the indicated transcripts were
used for hybridisation. A CAP cDNA probe was used as a
control. The CAP specific message shows an increase during
early aggregation and then returns to the level of growing
cells [55]. Additionally, RNA from the above time course
experiment was used to generate single stranded cDNA (see
Methods) and RT-PCR was carried out for analysis of the
expression of the stalk specific gene carB (cyclic AMP receptor 2). The actin8 gene was amplified as a control. (B) The
grlJ- strain has no pattern formation defect. grlJ- cells
were transfected using electroporation with the ecmB-Gal
and pspA(D19)-Gal plasmids separately. The transformants

altered spore viabilty. We propose that GrlJ is an important regulator of Dictyostelium development.

Methods
Dictyostelium cell culture, vector construction and
mutant isolation
Dictyostelium wild type and mutant cells were cultured as
described in [14]. For generation of the gene disruption
vector, the Neomycin resistance cassette was retrieved as
an EcoRV fragment from pDNeo2 [45] and inserted into
the EcoRV site of a genomic clone encoding the GrlJ gene.
Screening of the transformants was carried out using a
PCR approach [46], confirmation was done by Southern
blot analysis. Rescue experiments were carried out with a
vector encoding blasticidin resistance which allowed
expression of full length GrlJ carrying GFP at its C-terminus under control of the actin15 promoter (generously
provided by R. Blau-Wasser).
RNA isolation and quantitation, northern blotting
Total RNA was extracted from A×2 and grlJ- at different
developmental stages or from different assay conditions
using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. The manufacturer's
protocol for the isolation of RNA from the cytoplasm of
animal cells was used for preparation. The RNA samples
were used directly for northern blot analysis or after
reverse transcription for RT-PCR (Real-Time PCR). cDNA
was generated using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase,
RNAse H minus (Roche) according to the manufacturers
protocol. Usually 1–5 µg of the respective total RNA was
used for each RT reaction. cDNAs generated were used as

progam [46]. For quantitative Real-Time PCR primers
were selected such that the expected product size was
between 250–500 bp. Prior to use in Real-Time PCR
experiments the quality of the cDNA and the primers were
tested by PCR. Real-Time PCR was carried out with the
QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. For each sample gene specific
primers (10 pmole) and 1 µl of cDNA were used. As a
quantification standard defined concentrations (10 ng, 1
ng, 100 pg, 10 pg and 1 pg) of GrlJ's C-terminal gene
sequences in pGEMTeasy were used. The experiments
were carried out using an Opticon Real-Time PCR
machine. Calculations were done using the delta-delta CT
method. Actin specific primers were used as positive control and to ensure comparable concentrations of cDNA in
samples of wild type and mutant cells. For comparative
analysis of the transcript levels of all Grls, a semiquantitative Real-Time PCR analysis was carried out. Equal
amounts of cDNA were used for all experiments and PCR
was carried out for 25 cycles. This allowed a comparison

Equal numbers (5 × 107) of cells were plated onto phosphate agar
plates and allowed to develop completely until 48 hours. The spores
were then harvested and counted. 100 spores per each strain were
plated in association with K. aerogenes with and without treatment
with 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 15 min. The percentage of plaques
obtained with/without detergent and the percentage of spores
harvested from the mutants was calculated setting the spores
harvested from wild type cells as 100 percent. The result shown is
from a representative experiment.

cells were then resuspended in 1 ml Soerensen phosphate
buffer and evenly distributed onto a phosphate-buffered
agar plate (9 cm in diameter) and incubated at 21°C. Different stages of development were observed and the
images were captured using a stereomicroscope at the
indicated time points.
Phototaxis [48]
Axenically growing cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes and washed twice in water
before placing 106 cells each on 1% water agar plates. The
plates were incubated in a petridish storage containers
(thermocool box with walls painted completely black
from within) containing a vertical 3 mm wide perforation

along the length of the container in constant subdued
light for 48 hours at 22°C. The slime trails left behind the
migrating slugs were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and stained with 0.1% amido black in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid (staining solution) for 10
minutes, destained in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic
acid and washed with water and air dried.
Spore viability assay [[49], modified]
Equal numbers (5 × 107) of cells (A×2, grlJ-) were plated
onto phosphate agar plates and spores formed at 48 h
were harvested and counted, respectively. They were then
treated with 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 15 min and diluted
with Soerensen buffer and 100 spores each were plated
onto SM agar plates in association with K. areogenes.
Detergent resistant spores were counted as the number of
plaques formed once they appeared and calculated for the
viability. The experiments were carried out in triplicates.
Spore induction assay and quantification of produced
SDFs factors [31]
Spore induction is performed with cells taken from developing structures. 107 cells of each strain were washed and
allowed to develop on filters till they reached early to midculminant stage (approximately 20 h for most strains, 16
h for grlJ-) then harvested in 1 ml cAMP buffer (without
cAMP) (10 mM MES, pH 6.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl,

the presence of the indicated factors. The proportion of spores was determined under the microscope 2 h after induction and quantified as fold
induction in comparison to uninduced cells. * Either A×2 or A×4: A×2 was initially used for induction by SDF-1 or SDF-2 [30]. A×4 is used for all
factors and responds like A×2 to SDF-1 and SDF-2.

1 mM CaCl2. 1 mM MgSO4), centrifuged and washed
twice in 1 ml cAMP buffer. 105 cells each were plated in 6
wells plates with 2 ml cAMP buffer plus or minus various
factors: 10 nM synthetic SDF-1, 10 pM synthetic SDF-2,
100 nM GABA, 10 nM glutamate. The proportion of
spores was determined under the microscope after 1 h of
incubation for SDF-2 or GABA and 2 h for SDF-1. The fold
induction corresponds to the ratio between the level of
spores observed plus and minus factors. The amount of
SDF-1 and SDF-2 accumulated in terminal structures was
determined as previously described [31,32]. Briefly, fruiting bodies corresponding to 107 cells are dissociated in 1
ml cAMP buffer. Cells are removed by two centrifugations
at 6000 rpm. Aliquots of the supernatants were incubated
with either cation (C-50) or anion (A-25) exchange resins
to trap SDF-1 and SDF-2 respectively. SDF-1 and SDF-2
activity are then determined by serial dilution on test KP
cells (strain constitutive for PKA-C) in a sporogenous
assay. One unit corresponds to the lowest dilution giving
full induction of spore formation. The number of units are
standardized as per 103 producing cells.
LacZ reporter gene expression
A×2 cells and grlJ- cells were transformed using electroporation with the ecmO-Gal and pspA (D19)-Gal plasmids
separately. The transformants were selected with 4 µg/ml
G418 for wild type cells whereas additional 3 µg/ml of
blasticidin was added for grlJ- cells. Single colonies were
obtained by replica plating and they were developed on a
nitrocellulose filter until slug and culminant stages and
then processed for LacZ expression as described [50].
Miscellaneous methods
Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation
studies were done as described in [14]. For western blot
analysis of protein samples from developing cells samples
were prepared at the respective time points of Dictyostelium development and separated by SDS-PAGE gels (8%,
10% or 15% respectively) were blotted on to nitrocellulose membranes. They were blocked with 5 % milk in 1×
NCP and probed with different dilutions of the respective
primary antibodies and POD-conjugated secondary antibodies. They were then detected by ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) reactions.
