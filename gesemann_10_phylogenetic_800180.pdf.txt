Abstract
Background: The composition and expression of vertebrate gene families is shaped by species specific gene loss in
combination with a number of gene and genome duplication events (R1, R2 in all vertebrates, R3 in teleosts) and
depends on the ecological and evolutionary context. In this study we analyzed the evolutionary history of the solute
carrier 1 (SLC1) gene family. These genes are supposed to be under strong selective pressure (purifying selection) due
to their important role in the timely removal of glutamate at the synapse.
Results: In a genomic survey where we manually annotated and analyzing sequences from more than 300 SLC1 genes
(from more than 40 vertebrate species), we found evidence for an interesting evolutionary history of this gene family.
While human and mouse genomes contain 7 SLC1 genes, in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes up to 9
and in actinopterygii up to 13 SLC1 genes are present. While some of the additional slc1 genes in ray-finned fishes
originated from R3, the increased number of SLC1 genes in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes originates
from specific genes retained in these lineages.
Phylogenetic comparison and microsynteny analyses of the SLC1 genes indicate, that theria genomes evidently lost
several SLC1 genes still present in the other lineage. The genes lost in theria group into two new subfamilies of the
slc1 gene family which we named slc1a8/eaat6 and slc1a9/eaat7.

Conclusions: The phylogeny of the SLC1/EAAT gene family demonstrates how multiple genome reorganization and
duplication events can influence the number of active genes. Inactivation and preservation of specific SLC1 genes led
to the complete loss of two subfamilies in extant theria, while other vertebrates have retained at least one member of
two newly identified SLC1 subfamilies.

Background
Genomes of extant species are shaped by extensive gene
loss and duplication events. In the radiation of vertebrate
species, two whole genome duplication events at the base
of the vertebrate lineage (approximately 500 million years
(Mya) ago) [1-3] and a third round of genome duplication
at the base of the teleost lineage (about 350 Mya ago [47]) are proposed to play a crucial role [1-3]. Duplicated
genes are expected to be functionally redundant and

therefore released of selective pressure, consequently
leading to gene loss. Nevertheless many duplicated paralogs are retained in modern genomes, for instance an estimated 15 - 24% of duplicated paralogs are present in
extant teleost genomes [6,8-10]. The duplication-complementation-degeneration model seeks to explain the
retention of duplicated genes by subfunctionalization,
where the function of the essential ancestral gene is distributed to two genes, each fulfilling part of the ancestral
gene's function due to regulatory mutations [11,12].
Another most interesting possible event following gene
duplication is neofunctionalization, in which one of the
two paralogous genes is free to acquire a new function

that differs from the ancestral gene, due to the essential
(ancestral) function being carried out by the unchanged
paralog. Such functionalization events may pave the way
for speciation. An alternative driving force in speciation
might be divergent resolution, where random paralog
losses in two allopatric populations can lead to diversity
[13-15]. While whole genome duplications are one way to
increase the gene repertoire within a genome, tandem
duplication events as well as lineage specific gene loss are
other means to change the number of active genes (e.g.
[16,17].
In the context of lineage specific gene loss and duplication events, we studied members of the vertebrate slc1
gene family of neutral and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), whose presence on glia cells or neurons
is indispensable for precise and sustained synaptic activity [18-22]. EAATs are involved in the removal of glutamate from excitatory synapses, a process not only
essential to ensure precise termination of synaptic transmission but also to avoid neurotoxic accumulation implicated in a number of diseases [23]. Moreover, transport of
glutamate is associated with an increased chloride conductance across the membrane, which hyperpolarizes
cells [24]. Based on these important functions high-affinity glutamate transporters in the nervous system are supposed to be under strong purifying selection (pressure to
stay the same).
In mammals, five EAAT genes (EAAT 1-5) together
with two neutral amino acid transporters form the 'solute
carriers 1' (SLC1) gene family (for detailed information
on nomenclature, refer to Table 1). In these species EAAT
genes have diversified both in spatial and temporal
expression and in functional properties and are expressed

at glutamatergic synapses throughout the central nervous
system. SLC1A3/EAAT1 and SLC1A2/EAAT2 are predominantly expressed in glia cells and presumably mediate the main load of glutamate re-uptake while eliciting
only small chloride currents [18,20]. The neuronal transporters, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/
EAAT5, exhibit larger chloride currents, especially the
cerebellar SLC1A6/EAAT4 and the retina-specific
SLC1A7/EAAT5 [18,20].
In teleosts, given the evidence for a third round of
genome duplication (R3), an increased number of SLC1
genes are expected in their genomes. We indeed identified up to 13 SLC1s in fish genomes. While some of these
additional SLC1 genes clearly are the consequence of the
teleost specific R3, others are evidently members of two
additional subfamilies (now called SLC1A8/EAAT6,
SLC1A9/EAAT7), that were lost in the lineage leading to
human and mouse. Interestingly members of these two
subfamilies can also be found in prototherian, sauropsidan, and amphibian genomes, suggesting that these
genes are specifically retained in these lineages.

Results
The zebrafish genome contains 13 slc1 genes on separate
chromosomal locations

As a basis to study the evolutionary history of a given
gene family, we analyzed the abundance of slc1 genes in
the zebrafish genome. While in the human and mouse 7
different members of the slc1 gene family have been
described, we identified and annotated 13 slc1 family
genes in the zebrafish genome. Cloning from whole
embryo cDNA indicated that all of the 13 annotated slc1
sequences are indeed transcribed. Sequencing of the
amplified cDNA fragments revealed no significant deviation from our predicted sequences, except for some sites
of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
The fact that the slc1 gene family in zebrafish consists
of nearly twice as many genes as present in genomes of
human and mouse suggests that at least some of the
zebrafish slc1 orthologs have originated from the teleost
specific whole-genome duplication. Physical and virtual
mapping indicated that none of the sequences within a
subgroup of slc1 are located within the same chromosomal cluster (Additional File 1), supporting the hypothesis that the genes originated from whole genome
duplications rather than from individual tandem duplications.
Gene duplicates originating from whole genome duplications should be parts of large blocks of duplicated gene
pairs, called paralogons. This holds true for slc1a3a/
eaat1a and slc1a3b/eaat1b, which are located on chromosome 10 and 5 respectively. Moreover, these chromosomes are derived from a common protochromosome,

Gesemann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/117

further supporting a whole genome duplication event
[7,8].
The microsynteny analysis of slc1a2a/eaat2a and
slc1a2b/eaat2b revealed that these genes are located
within two chromosomal regions on chromosomes 7 and
25 that show multiple duplicated genes (Fig. 1a). These
results confirm the assumption that also the chromosomes 7 and 25 are derived from a common protochromosom {Taylor, 2003 #97; Postlethwait, 2000 #208} The
microsynteny analysis for the slc1a7a/eaat5a and
slc1a7b/eaat5b genes however gave a more complex pattern. While the slc1a7b/eaat5b gene is located on a small
chromosomal fragment on chromosome 23 that shows
only a handful of genes with conserved synteny to the
human chromosome 1, the slc1a7a/eaat5a gene is
located on chromosome 2 harbouring many genes that
have a similar alignment on the human chromosome 1
(Fig. 1b). Strikingly the SCP2 gene, which on the human
chromosome is adjacent to the SLC1A7/EAAT5 gene can
also be found next to slc1a7a/eaat5a and slc1a7b/eaat5b
genes in zebrafish, indicating that this region has been as
expected duplicated during evolution.
Evidence for the existence of additional SLC1 subgroups

We subsequently analyzed the phylogenetic relationships
of the identified zebrafish slc1 genes with their corresponding human and mouse orthologs. Interestingly,
zebrafish slc1 family members do not as expected segregate into 7 clearly distinguishable subgroups with two
orthologs each, but rather show a variable number of
zebrafish paralogs within the different groups (see Fig. 2
and Additional File 2). While in zebrafish only one
ortholog for SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A4, SLC1A5 and
SLC1A6/EAAT4 exists, two orthologs for SLC1A3/
EAAT1, three orthologs for SLC1A2/EAAT2 and even
four genes most closely related to SLC1A7/EAAT5 were
found, suggesting that in zebrafish additional slc1 subgroups exist.
Given this unexpected result, we analyzed slc1 gene
families in other teleost genomes (Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes, Gasterosteus aculeatus). Even teleost
genomes only distantly related to zebrafish displayed an
almost identical number and phylogeny of slc1 family
members as those identified in the zebrafish genome (Fig.
3), suggesting that within the teleost lineage this number
of slc1 family members is common. Moreover, members
within the defined subgroups slc1a2/eaat2 and slc1a7/
eaat5 clearly segregate into two separate branches, suggesting that in teleosts two additional slc1 subgroups,
now named slc1a8 and slc1a9, exist.
This assumption was supported by an analysis of the
intron/exon structure of the additional subfamilies.
While we found a high conservation of the exon number
and their corresponding lengths within a given subgroup,

Page 3 of 15

the exon size in the newly defined subfamilies were
altered (Fig. 4).
SLC1 gene retention and loss across vertebrate lineages

Since we saw the loss of two SLC1 subfamilies while comparing teleosts and euarchontoglires (rodents and primates), we decided to extend our analysis to encompass
the whole vertebrate tree (Fig. 5A; for a complete list of
species analyzed see Additional File 3). Therefore we analyzed the genomic information from species, covering the
main vertebrate lineages including marsupials, monotremata, sauropsides, and amphibiens (Fig. 5A). While
the genomic information from the species used for the
following analysis cover the main vertebrate lineages, a
complete set of data can be found in Additional File 3
(common and scientific names, abbreviations and
genomic coverage), Additional File 4 (links to genomic
and transcript information), and Additional File 5
(intron/exon sizes of all species analyzed).
Database analyses indicated that all therian species
have lost SLC1A8 and SLC1A9. In contrast, the members
of egg laying vertebrates (prototheria, amphibia, and sauropsida) display various gene losses and retentions (Fig.
5B). Monotremates (prototheria) and birds have retained
SLC1A8 and lost SLC1A9, whereas the reverse pattern
holds true for lepidosauromorphes (lizards) that have
retained SLC1A9 and lost SLC1A8. Xenopus tropicalis, as
a representative of the amphibians on the other hand has
retained members of both subfamilies. Interestingly,
additional gene losses occurred in a variety of lineages.
For instance, chicken (Gallus gallus) has lost SLC1A5 and
the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) has lost
SLC1A6 (Fig. 5B).
Phylogenetic reconstruction including now SLC1
sequences from teleosts, amphibia, sauropsida and mammalia clearly indicates that the newly assigned SLC1A8
and SLC1A9 each form a separate clade (Fig. 5C).
In order to get an additional glimpse at the evolutionary
history of SLC1 genes, we analyzed the genomes of two
basal vertebrates, namely the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) and the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The elephant shark, belonging to the cartilaginous
fish, represents an independent evolutionary branch of
the vertebrates, whose genomes are thought to have
undergone the same number of genome duplications as
the mammalian branch [25]. The low (1.4×) coverage of
the elephant shark genome prevented the assembly of
complete slc1 cDNA sequences. Nevertheless, our comparison revealed only exons for one ortholog per subfamily, with the notable exception of the SLC1A2/A9
subgroup, where we detected a retained SLC1A9
ortholog. Interestingly we also identified two paralogs of
the SLC1A2/A9 subgroup in the lamprey, a jawless verte-

brate at the base of the vertebrate tree (for a phylogenetic
tree see Additional File 6).
Chromosomal location of putative human SLC1A8 and
SLC1A9 remnants

In order to see if remnants of the SLC1A8 and SLC1A9
genes can still be found within the human genome, we
performed a microsynteny analysis localizing genes
flanking SLC1A8 and SLC1A9. Interestingly, zebrafish
slc1a8a and slc1a8b are both flanked by elavl1, a gene
that can be located to human chromosome 19 (Fig. 6).
This human genomic region shows a highly conserved
synteny with regions flanking the zebrafish slc1a8 genes,
suggesting that the inactivated human SLC1A8 gene
might originally have been located on chromosome 19
in the p13.2/3 region (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the putative
inactivated human ortholog of slc1a9 has also been
located on chromosome 19, however in contrast to
SLC1A8, which is located on the shorter arm of the

Page 4 of 15

chromosome, SLC1A9 has been located on the longer
arm in the region q13.3. This region also displays a
highly conserved synteny, implying that the inactivated
gene might indeed have been part of this chromosomal
region. However, despite extensive attempts we were
not able to identify sequences of the inactivated human
SLC1A8 and SLC1A9 genes, suggesting that the degeneration of these genes has already progressed too far to
allow detection.
Furthermore synteny analysis in Xenopus and chicken
also revealed ELAVL1 in close proximity to SLC1A8
within the same chromosomal fragment. Similarly we
found the NUCB1 gene in the vicinity of SLC1A9 in the
Xenopus and Anolis genome (data not shown).
The expression patterns of zebrafish slc1a3/eaat1 and
slc1a2/eaat2 paralogs suggest subfunctionalization

As an example to compare the spatial and temporal
expression pattern of duplicated genes, we investigated

Figure 1 Synteny of the SLC1A2/SLC1A7 genes. Genes located within the genomic regions from the human chromosomes 11p13 (A) and 1p32.3/
p33 (B) are shown. Synteny between human regions flanking the SLC1A2 and SLC1A7 genes and zebrafish show several genes that are, in addition to
the SLC1 genes, duplicated in the zebrafish genome. Note that slc1a7b is located on a small orthologous region to the human chromosome 1 covering
only 6 genes. Zebrafish chromosomes 7 and 25, harbouring the slc1a2a and slc1a2b genes, have been previously reported to derive from a common
protochromosome [8]. Duplicated genes in the zebrafish genome are shown in green and SLC1 genes are highlighted in red.

The phylogenetic tree was builtusing 370 representative amino acids determined by the program Gblocks after sequence alignment using MUSCLE. Bootstrap values above 50% (0.5) are shown. Zebrafish slc1 genes are shown in red. Note that
in zebrafish several duplicated slc1 genes have been inactivated during evolution, but a duplicated gene for the SLC1A3 family has been retained.

the expression patterns of the zebrafish slc1a3 and slc1a2
subfamily genes.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments show
that slc1a3a transcripts can be found in glia cells of the
larval zebrafish brain at 3 days post fertilization (Fig. 7A
and 7B), similar to the expression of mammalian
SLC1A3/EAAT1 in astrocytes of the brain.
We found non-overlapping expression for the slc1a3b/
eaat1b paralog in neuromasts of the lateral line organ
(Fig. 7C and 7D). Neuromasts consist of sensory hair cells
and support cells that are homologous to mammalian
inner ear hair cells and their adjacent support cells. The
observed expression is consistent with a comparable
function of this transporter in neuromasts, as observed
for the ribbon synapse of the mammalian inner ear [26].

The slc1a2/eaat2 paralogs are both expressed in glia
cells of the larval zebrafish brain (Fig. 7E-H) in a similar
pattern to slc1a3a/eaat1a, which is consistent with
SLC1A2/EAAT2 expression in mammalian astrocytes. In
the retina, however, we found a complementary expression pattern with slc1a2a/eaat2a transcripts in the inner
(Fig. 7E and 7F, arrow) and slc1a2b/eaat2b transcripts in
the outer retina (Fig. 7H, arrow).
While the expression of zebrafish slc1a2b/eaat2b paralogs is in line with mammalian slc1a2/eaat2 expression in
the outer retina, the slc1a2a/eaat2a expression in the
inner retina has not been reported in mammals, suggestive of neofunctionalization.
Taken together our expression data for the slc1a3/eaat1
and slc1a2/eaat2 paralogs reveal subfunctionalization

Figure 3 Teleosts display a conserved number of retained slc1 genes. For this analysis the following species in addition to mouse (mm) and human (hs) were used: Zebrafish Danio rerio (dr), Takifugu rubripes (tr), Medaka Oryzias latipes (ol) and the stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus (ga). The phylogenetic tree was build using the maximum likelihood method on a 331aa stretch determined by the program Gblocks after MUSCLE alignment of
the full-length SLC1 amino acid sequence. Bootstrap values above 50% (0.5) are shown. While zebrafish slc1 genes are shown in dark red, other teleost
slc1 genes are highlighted in light red. Within the teleost family the number and phylogeny of slc1 genes is highly preserved, with the exception of
slc1a7b/eaat5b which could neither be found in stickleback nor in torafugu. In case of slc1a9 the takifugu rubripes gene was replaced by the Tetraodon
gene as the takifugu slc1a9 gene could only be partly assembled. Note that teleost slc1a2c/eaat2c and slc1a7c/d/eaat5c/d genes are phylogenetically
clearly separated from other SLC1 subfamilies pointing towards the existence of two additional species specific subfamilies now called slc1a8 and
slc1a9. The scale bar shows the percentage of amino acid substitutions required to generate the corresponding tree.

Figure 4 Members of the new teleost specific SLC1 subfamilies show changes in coding sequence length and exon size. Analysis of the last
two exons within the slc1a2/9 (A) and slc1a7/8 (B) subfamilies reveals an altered exon size and coding sequence length. While the coding sequence
encoded by the last two exons of the slc1a9 gene are longer than the corresponding coding sequence of the slc1a2 family, exons of the members of
the slc1a8 subfamily have a shorter coding sequence. Changes within the new subfamilies are highlighted in bold. Note that only Danio rerio genes
are shown, but that the exon alignment of other teleost fish species gave comparable results.

events in the zebrafish, since each paralog fulfills presumably parts of the ancestral function as predicted by the
Duplication Degeneration-Complementation model
[11,12].

Discussion
Modern genomes are shaped by frequent duplication and
deletion events. Most dramatic are whole genome duplications that were prominently stated by Susumo Ohno as
the most important driving force in the evolution of
metazoans [1]. This idea has immediate appeal since it
provides an elegant route to the generation of new functions without compromising essential ancestral gene
functions. Following the split from invertebrates, modern
vertebrate genomes harbour remnants of two whole
genome duplications [2,3], and there is now overwhelm-

ing evidence that ray-finned fishes (teleosts) had an additional whole genome duplication dating back about 320350 million years ago (Mya) [5], leading to many unique
teleost specific genes. While analyzing solute carrier family 1 (slc1) genes in zebrafish, we found as expected evidence for many duplicated genes. However, some
zebrafish slc1 genes turned out to be not the result of the
teleost specific R3. Further analyses ruled out the possibility that these SLC1 genes originated from the teleost
specific genome duplication. One possible explanation
for these additional genes is lineage and species specific
gene loss. This has long been recognized in unicellular
organisms [27,28]. However more recent reports demonstrate that such events are also observed in vertebrate
species [16,29-31], where the impact of such species specific gene loss remains unclear. In the case of the SLC1

Major superclasses, classes and infraclasses are indicated and color coded for easier comparison and identification. The species used in the following phylogenetic analysis are shown by representative pictures. (B) The number of active SLC1 genes varies within different
species. Due to the fish specific genome duplication (R3), ray finned fish have an increased number of SLC1 genes as indicated by the presence of 'b'
paralogs, which cannot be found in other vertebrates. Note that also within the actinopterygian lineage selective gene loss occurs (striped background) as no SLC1A7b paralog can be found in the medaka genome. Within the tetrapod lineage, theria have lost both the SLC1A8 and the SLC1A9
gene, whereas prototheria and archosauromorpha have only lost the SLC1A9 and lepidosauromorpha have lost the SLC1A8 gene. Further gene loss
can be observed in some avian species (SLC1A5) and in the green lizard Anolis carolinensis (SLC1A6). (C) Maximum likelihood phylogeny of analyzed

Bootstrap values above 50% (0.5) are shown. Species belonging to the different superclasses, classes and infraclasses are highlighted in the same colors as used in Figure 5A. Note that members of the newly identified SLC1A8 and SLC1A9 subgroups all group
together forming indeed a separate branch within the SLC1 tree (highlighted in red). The scale bar shows the percentage (0.3 equals 30%) of amino

family, where five of the seven human and mouse SLC1
genes are grouped in the functionally defined excitatory
amino acid transporter (EAAT) family, in teleosts we
found members of two additional subfamilies, now called
SLC1A8/EAAT6 and SLC1A9/EAAT7, in teleosts. These
two subfamilies have been lost in all therian mammals.
This is quite surprising, as these proteins are involved in
the removal of glutamate from vertebrate synapses and
are therefore likely under immediate selective pressure.
In order to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of this
gene family we studied a number of vertebrate species
from all major vertebrate lineages. We found representatives of both new subfamilies in all analyzed teleost species, showing that the existence of these genes is common
to teleost species and is not restricted to zebrafish. Analysis of amphibian genomes reveal the existence of one
member of each SLC1A8/EAAT6 and SLC1A9/EAAT7
subfamily, arguing that the tetrapod ancestral species still
contained the full complement of SLC1 subfamilies. In
this respect it is interesting to note that a study of glutamate transporters in the tiger salamander Ambystoma
tigrinum retina reports the cloning of a SLC1A8/EAAT6,
as well as a SLC1A9/EAAT7 gene (referred to as EAAT2b
and EAAT5b in the report, respectively) [32,33], which
indeed group into the two new subfamilies (data not
shown). These findings provide additional evidence for a
scenario where the genes of these subfamilies have been
lost after the amphibia - amnionta split.
A clue to when the first subfamily was lost is provided
by the sauropsida. Here the Lepidsauromorpha (represented by the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis) have
retained SLC1A9 but lost SLC1A8. The situation is
reversed in the archosauromorpha (represented by the
bird species zebrafinch and chicken), where SLC1A9 was
lost but SLC1A8 was retained. This suggests that the
genome of the last common ancestor of the sauropsida
still contained both subfamilies, followed by independent
gene loss in the two branches of the sauropsida. Following this logic the genome of the amniote ancestors should
have contained members of both subfamilies.
In mammals only the protherian species (represented
by the duck-billed Platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus)
have retained the member of SLC1A8, while all other
remaining mammals have lost members of both subfamilies. In the most parsimonious scenario the last common
mammalian ancestor has already lost SLC1A9 but has
retained SLC1A8. Subsequently SLC1A8 was lost at the
base of the therian lineage, whereas a member of this subfamily was retained in the branched off protheria species.
Hence the SLC1A8 and SLC1A9 subfamilies have been
lost independently in a number of lineages. While for
instance SLC1A8 has been lost at least twice independently in the archosauromorpha and therian lineage,
SLC1A9 has been lost independently in the therian and

lepidosauromorpha lineage. In order to infer the ancestral
situation we assessed the SLC1/EAAT repository in species that are at the base of the gnathosomes.
Genome information for two species of interest, the
elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) and the sea lamprey
(Petromyzon marinus), is available. While the former represents the cartilaginous fish, an independent branch of
the vertebrates that has split before the division of the tetrapod and the teleost lineage, the later belongs to a clade
of skulled chordate animals lacking jaws. Since both lineages branched off before R3, cartilaginous fish as well as
lampreys are expected to have undergone the same number of genome duplications as the mammalian branch.
Consequently the gene repertoire between lamprey,
sharks, and mammals should be comparable [25,34].
While we found for each therian SLC1 gene a corresponding elephant shark ortholog, we identified several
exons of a retained SLC1A9 ortholog, demonstrating that
this basal species have retained members of additional
SLC1 gene families. Interestingly we found only one exon
sequence for a putative SLC1A8/EAAT6 ortholog in the
lamprey and no trace of this gene in the elephant shark.
This suggests that either this gene has been lost independently in both of these basal species (assuming that the
putative lamprey exon is a false positive one) or that limited genomic information prevented us from identifying
these corresponding genes.
Up to now, we have focused our discussion mainly on
the SLC1A8 and SLC1A9 subfamilies. An interesting case
is also the loss of SLC1A6/EAAT4 in the green anole lizard. This gene is not duplicated in any species analyzed
and is prominently expressed in the cerebellum. We can
only speculate that another SLC1 gene in lizards must
have taken over the function of SLC1A6 in glutamate
removal from cerebellar synapses. Support for such a scenario comes from a study comparing the similarity of the
glutamatergic sytem in the turtle Chrysemys picta and
rodents [35].
We have documented multiple gene loss in vertebrate
lineages, raising the question if traces of these lost genes
can still be found in extant genomes. Most of these gene
losses must have happened many Mya ago, so finding
defunct gene sequences is rather unlikely. However by
microsynteny analyses, we found the putative genomic
location of both lost SLC1 genes in the human genome.
Intriguingly both lost genes were most likely located on
human chromosome 19. While the putative SLC1A8
location is on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.2/
3), the most likely position of the inactivated SLC1A9 is
on the long arm at position 19q13.3. For this human
chromosome extensive rearrangements within the short
arm and many intrachromosomal breaks in the long arm
have been reported, even since the time of primate rodent
divergence [36]. Therefore it seems well conceivable that

Figure 7 Zebrafish slc1a3/eaat1 and slc1a2/eaat2 paralogs show subfunctionalized expression. The expression patterns of slc1a3/eaat1 and
slc1a2/eaat2 was assessed using whole-mount in situ hybridization on larval (3dpf) zebrafish. While slc1a3a/eaat1a shows expression in glia cells of
the brain (A and B), slc1a3b/eaat1b is expressed in neuromasts of the lateral line organ (C and D). Expression of the slc1a2 paralogs overlap in the brain
(E-H), however, they differ in the retina. slc1a2a/eaat2a is expressed in the inner retina (E and F, arrow), whereas slc1a2b/eaat2b is expressed in the
outer retina (G and H, arrow). Scale bar is 200 μm.

many genes, including SLC1A8 and SLC1A9, may have
been rendered non-functional during these rearrangement events. Our microsynteny analyses indicated that
the ELAVL1 gene is in close proximity of both zebrafish
SLC1A8 genes, and that other genes in this region map
like ELAVL1 to the human chromosome 19. Interestingly
this synteny is conserved in chicken and Xenopus, where
ELAVL1 and SLC1A8 are neighbors on chromosome 28
(890K-930K) and scaffold 112 (300K-400K) respectively
(data not shown).

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis of a gene family spanning multiple taxa can yield important information about their
evolutionary history. In the case of the solute carrier family 1, consistent with the duplication-complementationdegeneration model, most of the 7 human or mouse
orthologs have one or two teleost orthologs. However, for
two teleost SLC1 subfamilies we found no corresponding
therian counterpart. This indicates that therians must
have lost these two subfamilies, now named SLC1A8/
EAAT6 and SLC1A9/EAAT7.
These two subfamilies are not teleost specific, but can
be found throughout different vertebrates. An analysis of
the major vertebrate lineages revealed an intriguing pattern of lineage specific gene losses, shaping the phylogenetic history of SLC1 genes. In all non-therian vertebrate
species we found at least one member of the SLC1A8/9
subfamilies. Amphibians have neither lost SLC1A8 nor
SLC1A9, lepidosauria (extent lizards, snakes and tuatara)
on the one hand have lost the SLC1A8 ortholog, while
birds on the other hand have lost SLC1A9. Interestingly
egg laying mammals (platypus) are the only mammals
that have also retained a SLC1A8 ortholog.
By studying one gene family across a number of vertebrate taxa, inferences can be made about the evolutionary
history of these genes. Such an analysis is needed to guide
the interpretation of functional data obtained for those
genes and provides a fascinating scenario to study the
evolution of vertebrate gene families.
Methods
Zebrafish maintenance and breeding

Wild-type fish of the Tübingen (Tü) inbred strain were
bred and crossed as previously described [37]. Embryos
were raised in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl,
0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4) at 28°C. Stages refer to
the development in days post fertilization (dpf ).
Annotation of zebrafish SLC1 cDNAs

As many genes predicted within GenBank are produced
by automated processes and have been shown to contain
numerous errors such as missing exons and wrong predictions of start and termination sites, all cDNA

Page 12 of 15

sequences for the described slc1 genes were annotated
manually. Sequences from the species listed in Additional
File 3 were used for our analysis. Sequences were identified and annotated using combined information from
EST, genome (GeneBank, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov;
Ensembl, http://www.ensembl.org/index.html; version
50/51, 2008) and WGS http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi?PAGE=Nucleotides&PROGRAM=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=TraceArchive&BLAST_
PROGRAMS=megaBlast&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch
databases. Human and mouse sequences were used as
initial query. Genomic regions coding for SLC1 family
genes were identified by using the tblastx alignment algorithm (for details on intron/exon sizes see Additional File
1). Corresponding genomic fragments were analyzed
using the GENSCAN gene prediction program http://
genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html. The obtained putative
cDNA and protein sequences were compared to the corresponding human and mouse orthologs and GENSCAN
prediction errors were corrected by manual inspection of
the intron/exon boundaries in false predicted regions
(small exons and minor class splice sites are usually not
recognized [38]). Gaps in the assembled sequences due to
inaccurate or incomplete genome sequencing were wherever possible filled by corresponding EST or WGS
sequences. Sequences found by EST and WGS searches
were again blasted against the nr database and only if the
top hits corresponded to the original query sequences
were used in the annotation process. Note that in the case
of duplicated genes annotation errors using WGS
sequences could not be excluded due to the fact that individual exons could not be linked together. Sequence
alignment of cDNA fragments and overlapping EST
sequences was done using the SeqMan software (Lasergene, DNASTAR, Madison WI).
Phylogenetic tree analysis

Coding sequences of slc1 genes (except for the exon 234
analysis which was done on nucleotide sequences) were
translated into proteins using the EditSeq software
(Lasergene, DNASTAR, Madison WI) and obtained protein sequences were used to generate a combined
sequence file in FASTA format (see Additional File 7
(protein FASTA) and Additional File 8 (exon 234 FASTA).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the Phylogeny.fr platform http://www.phylogeny.fr/version2_cgi/phylogeny.cgi.
Sequences
were
aligned using MUSCLE (v3.7, Edgar 2004) configured for
highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings). After
alignment, ambiguous regions (i.e. containing gaps and/
or are poorly aligned) were removed with Gblocks
(v0.91b, [39]) using the following parameters: minimum
length of a block after gap cleaning = 10; no gap positions
were allowed in the final alignment; all segments with

Gesemann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/117

contiguous nonconserved positions bigger than 8 were
rejected; minimum number of sequences for a flank position = 85%. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed
using the maximum likelihood method implemented in
the PhyML program (v3.0 aLRT, [40]. The default substitution model was selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant sites and 4 gamma-distributed rate
categories to account for rate heterogeneity across sites.
The gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from
the data. Reliability for internal branch was assessed
using the bootstrapping method (100 bootstrap replicates) and bootstrap values above 50% (0.5) are shown.
Graphical representation and editing of the phylogenetic
tree was done using TreeDyn (v198.3, [41] and the
obtained svg files were colored using the CorelDraw program. Animal icons in Figure 5 were purchased from
iStockphoto http://www.istockphoto.com.
Alternative alignments and trees were calculated using
the alignment programs ClustalW [42] and T-Coffee [43],
and the neighbour joining (PHYLIP package 3.66 [44]; distances calculated using ProtDist [45] or MRBAYES (v3.1.2,
[46] phylogeny programs. Using these alternative methods
revealed some potential differences in phylogeny and a
Bayesian calculated tree including human, mouse and
zebrafish SLC1 sequences is shown in Additional File 2.
Cloning

Approximately 50 5 dpf zebrafish larvae were homogenized to prepare total RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy kit
(Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Oligo dT primers were used to reverse-transcribe the
total RNA with reverse transcriptase (First Strand Kit,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers. Amplified fragments were ligated into
the pCR-II vector (TA Cloning Kit Dual Promoter, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and at least three independently amplified cDNA fragments per gene were
sequenced to confirm our previously annotated zebrafish
sequences. Accession numbers for the zebrafish SLC1/
EAAT genes are: SLC1A1/EAAT3 (HM138690),
SLC1A2a/EAAT2a (HM138691), SLC1A2b/EAAT2b
(HM138692),
SLC1A3a/EAAT1a
(HM138693),
SLC1A3b/EAAT1b (HM138694), SLC1A4 (HM138695),
SLC1A5 (HM138696), SLC1A6/EAAT4 (HM138697),
SLC1A7a/EAAT5a (HM138698), SLC1A7b/EAAT5b
(HM138699),
SLC1A8a/EAAT6a
(HM138700),
SLC1A8b/EAAT6b
(HM138701),
SLC1A9/EAAT7
(HM138702).
Genomic mapping

All zebrafish slc1 genes except slc1a6/eaat4 were localized in the zebrafish genome by radiation hybrid mapping
[47] using the LN54 panel (Loeb/NIH/5000/4000, M.
Ekker, Ottawa, Canada) and specific primer pairs for the
genomic sequences (see Additional File 9).

Page 13 of 15

Synteny analysis

For microsynteny analyses, genes flanking the slc1 locus
of human or zebrafish were used as initial queries for a
tblastx [48] search against the zebrafish or human database (ncbi nr/nt database) limited to the desired species
(homo sapiens, danio rerio). The different hits were compared with each other and the hit with the highest conservation (identical aa and conserved aa) was selected
(note that due to frequently occurring alignment gaps,
hits with the lowest expect scores (E values) not necessarily representing the ones with highest identity). Only hits
displaying a significant homology in length as well as conservation were used for further analyses. The hit with the
highest conservation was used in a reciprocal tblastx
search against the corresponding database and only genes
which identified the initially used query are depicted.
Whole-mount in situ bybridization

In vitro transcription of DIG-labeled probes was performed using the Roche RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). RNA probes were
hydrolyzed to obtain fragments of about 300 bp length.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization on 3 dpf zebrafish larvae was performed as follows. PTU treated larvae were
anesthetized on ice and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 40
min at ambient temperature (RT). The in situ hybridization was performed according to the Zebrafish Book protocol [50] using an automated in situ hybridization
machine (BioLane HTI, Hölle & Hüttner, Tübingen, Germany).

Additional material
Additional file 1 Genomic localizations of slc1 genes in the zebrafish
genome. Chromosomal localizations were identified both physically, using
radiation hybrid mapping, and in silico. All zebrafish slc1 genes localize to
different chromosomal regions. For details on radiation hybrid mapping,
see Materials and Methods. *The localization of slc1a6/eaat4 could not
unambiguously be determined by radiation hybrid mapping and has been
mapped in silico only.
Additional file 2 Phylogenetic analysis of SLC1 genes using a Bayesian algorithm. Bayesian phylogeny of members of the zebrafish (dr),
mouse (mm) and human (hs) SLC1 family. The phylogenetic tree was build
using 370 representative amino acids determined by the program Gblocks
after sequence alignment using MUSCLE. The tree was reconstructed using
the bayesian inference method implemented in the MrBayes program
(v3.1.2). The number of substitution types was fixed to 6. The Poisson model
was used for amino acid substitution, while rates variation across sites was
fixed to "invgamma". Four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were
run for 10000 generations, sampling every 10 generations, with the first 250
sampled trees discarded as "burn-in". Finally, a 50% majority rule consensus
tree was constructed. Note that in comparison to the maximum likelihood
calculated tree, roots in the Bayesian tree are slightly different. While in the
Bayesian build tree it appears that there is a common ancestor of SLC1A1,
SLC1A2, SLC1A3 and SLC1A6, the tree deriving from maximum likelihood
phylogeny suggests that there is a common ancestor between SLC1A3,
SLC1A6 and SLC1A7/8 (Figure 2). Zebrafish slc1/eaat genes are shown in
red. The scale bar represents the percent of amino acid substitutions
required to generate the corresponding tree.

are indicated. The genome coverage is given. Note that coverage's highlighted in green (high coverage) and yellow (low coverage) belong to species that have been used to generate the phylogenetic tree covering the
major linages. Coverage's shown in red belong to species whose
sequences have been annotated but not included in the phylogenetic tree.

annotated sequences is indicated by different colours. Identical predicted
and annotated sequences are shown in green, whereas sequences with different predicted open reading frames are highlighted in red. Sequences
covering the whole open reading frame are indicated as "Full" sequences
and sequences lacking one or more exons are marked as partial sequences.
Sequences for which neither a genomic nor a transcript link have been
found are given by the letters n.d. (not detected).
Additional file 5 Intron/Exon sizes of SLC1 genes. The different SLC1
gene families are colour coded. Exons serving as identifiers for the corresponding gene family are highlighted in the identical colour as the gene
family. Exons containing the start and the stop codon are highlighted in
red. Intron sequences containing multiple place holders (Ns) are indicated.
Additional file 6 The SLC1A9 subfamily is also present in cartilaginous fish. Database analysis on the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii, cm)
and the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) genome identified sequences
that represent parts of the SLC1A9 gene. For the exon 234 (for more information on slc1 intron/exon sizes see supplementary Figure S5), two corresponding slc1a2 exons could be found, one of them representing a
retained slc1a9 gene. The phylogenetic tree was build using the maximum
likelihood method on the entire nucleotide sequence of corresponding
234 exons. Bootstrap values above 50% (0.5) are shown. Elephant shark
sequences are highlighted in dark red, lamprey sequences are shown in
claret red and teleost genes are depicted in light red. Note that the FSGD
generated two retained SLC1A2 genes and most likely also two SLC1A9
genes of which in modern teleosts only one is still present.
