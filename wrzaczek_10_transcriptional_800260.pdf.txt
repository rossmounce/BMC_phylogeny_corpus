Abstract
Background: Plant Receptor-like/Pelle kinases (RLK) are a group of conserved signalling components that regulate
developmental programs and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. One of the largest RLK groups is formed by the
Domain of Unknown Function 26 (DUF26) RLKs, also called Cysteine-rich Receptor-like Kinases (CRKs), which have been
suggested to play important roles in the regulation of pathogen defence and programmed cell death. Despite the vast
number of RLKs present in plants, however, only a few of them have been functionally characterized.
Results: We examined the transcriptional regulation of all Arabidopsis CRKs by ozone (O3), high light and pathogen/
elicitor treatment - conditions known to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various subcellular
compartments. Several CRKs were transcriptionally induced by exposure to O3 but not by light stress. O3 induces an
extracellular oxidative burst, whilst light stress leads to ROS production in chloroplasts. Analysis of publicly available
microarray data revealed that the transcriptional responses of the CRKs to O3 were very similar to responses to microbes
or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Several mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling
showed changes in basal and O3-induced transcriptional responses.
Conclusions: Combining expression analysis from multiple treatments with mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis
or signalling suggest a model in which O3 and salicylic acid (SA) activate separate signaling pathways that exhibit
negative crosstalk. Although O3 is classified as an abiotic stress to plants, transcriptional profiling of CRKs showed
strong similarities between the O3 and biotic stress responses.

Background
Receptor-like/Pelle kinases (RLKs) are important components in the regulation of plant development, hormone
signalling, abiotic, and biotic stress responses in plants.
RLKs are serine-threonine protein kinases that typically
contain a signal peptide, a variable extracellular domain, a
transmembrane region, and a conserved intracellular
protein kinase domain. The extracellular ligand-binding
domain perceives signals and is commonly used to classify RLKs into distinct subgroups [1]. The RLKs are one
of the largest gene families in Arabidopsis with more than

600 members, [1-4], but only relatively few of them,
mostly leucine-rich repeat RLKs (LRR-RLK), have been
functionally characterized. CLAVATA1, a LRR-RLK,
binds the small extracellular protein CLAVATA3 to regulate meristem proliferation [5]. FERONIA (a member of a
previously uncharacterized group of RLKs) is central to
the regulation of male-female interactions during pollen
tube reception in Arabidopsis [6] and in Brassica the Slocus Receptor Kinase and its ligand are critical determinants of self-incompatibility [7,8]. In Arabidopsis,
ERECTA (a LRR-RLK) is a multifaceted regulator of
development and physiological processes as well as environmental responses [9]. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1, a LRR-RLK) binds the plant hormone
brassinosteroid and dimerizes with BRI1-ASSOCIATED

RECEPTOR KINASE 3 (BAK1/SERK3) [10,11]. BAK1
also inducibly dimerizes with the RLK FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2, a LRR-RLK), which recognizes bacterial
flagellin and is important in plant immunity [12,13].
Other RLKs contributing to pathogen recognition
include EFR (the Arabidopsis receptor for EF-Tu) and rice
Xa21 (a LRR-RLK), which recognizes a sulfonated peptide produced by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae [14-18].
The DUF26 (Domain of Unknown Function 26; PFAM
domain PF01657) RLKs, also known as Cysteine-rich
RLKs (CRKs), form a large subgroup of the RLK family
with more than 40 members [1,19]. The extracellular
region of the protein contains two copies of the DUF26
domain which has four conserved cysteines (three of
them form the motif C-8X-C-2X-C) that may form disulphide bridges as potential targets for thiol redox regulation. The CRKs are transcriptionally induced by oxidative
stress, pathogen attack and application of salicylic acid
(SA) [19-22]. Accordingly several members of the CRK
subgroup of RLKs are involved in the regulation defence
reactions and cell death in Arabidopsis leaves. Constitutive over-expression of CRK5 led to increased resistance
to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae
pv. tomato DC3000 but also to enhanced growth of the
plant leaves [22]. Over-expression of CRK4, CRK5,
CRK19 and CRK20 by a chemically inducible promoter,
on the other hand, caused cell death [19,22]. Genetic
analysis suggested that CRK5 regulated cell death independently of SA [22]. Conversely the enhanced resistance
to Pseudomonas upon overexpression of CRK13 required
increased SA levels [23].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been established as
important signalling molecules for inter- and intracellular
communication in plants, animals and yeast [24-26]. ROS
are produced in strictly defined locations in reponse to
specific stimuli [25]. Pathogen infection rapidly induces
an extracellular oxidative burst while light stress and specific chemicals, including paraquat and norflurazon,
induce ROS production in the chloroplast [27-29]. Plant
cells can differentiate between the type and localization
of ROS resulting in very specific responses. Furthermore,
ROS production in specific cellular compartments can
have impact on ROS generation and signalling in other
locations [30,31]. This crosstalk is likely accomplished
through interplay between separate signalling pathways
rather than direct interaction of the ROS molecules
themselves [30,31]. However, the molecular components
and mechanisms involved are still poorly defined [31,32].
In addition, it is unknown how ROS are sensed and how
specificity in ROS signalling is achieved. The gaseous
molecule ozone (O3) induces a burst of ROS in the apoplast similar to the oxidative burst in plant-pathogen
interactions [24]. Other similarities between O3 and

Page 2 of 19

pathogen infection include the production of SA and ethylene (ET) [24]. O3 is a convenient system to experimentally address the effects of apoplastic ROS since the plant
is not exposed to other effector proteins or toxins which
might induce defence responses. O3 permits the study of
the apoplastic oxidative burst undisturbed by manual
manipulation of the plant material.
Plant hormones are a group of unrelated small compounds which are central to signalling during environmental adaptation and developmental regulation [33,34].
SA, jasmonic acid (JA) and ET are viewed as the main
hormonal determinants of plant pathogen defence
[35,36]. Abscisic acid (ABA) modulates plant defence and
is a negative regulator of SA responses [37]. In addition,
ABA is a key regulator of the high light response [38]. The
interaction of hormone and ROS signalling is well documented. ROS can induce cell death in a SA-dependent
and independent manner [24]. Cell death and ROS
induce ET synthesis, which feeds into a positive forward
amplification loop enhancing ROS production [39]. ROSinduced JA is critical in limiting cell death [24]. Thus, the
successful outcome of a given response is not determined
by one hormone, but is achieved through balance, interaction and constant recalibration of different plant hormones.
Despite extensive research on ROS signalling, the exact
components mediating ROS signalling, ROS sensing, and
perception in particular are still unknown. Here we have
analysed transcriptional regulation and the involvement
of hormonal signalling in regulating the expression of the
whole Arabidopsis CRK gene subfamily by ROS. The
effects of ROS production in different subcellular compartments was analysed by using O3- and light stress
treated plant material and publicly available microarray
data. We show that O3-induced transcriptional responses
are blocked in the defense, no death 1 (dnd1) mutant, and
they are altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling
mutants. Collectively this reveals alternate pathways in
the regulation of ROS responses.

Results
CRK transcriptional response to O3

Several groups of RLKs are transcriptionally regulated in
response to biotic stresses [40]. We identified several
CRKs which were differentially regulated by O3 (MB and
JK unpublished microarray data). These results suggest a
strong transcriptional regulation of the CRKs during
stress responses. Therefore we chose to investigate further the transcriptional regulation of the whole CRK subfamily by ROS.
According to Shiu and Bleecker [1], Chen et al. [19],
and our analysis (see table 1 for nomenclature and reference), the CRK subfamily consists of 44 members. Previ-

contains no identifiable extracellular domain, signal peptide or complete kinase domain; thus both genes were
excluded
from
the
analysis.
We analysed the transcriptional responses of all the 44
CRKs to extracellular ROS produced by O3 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). Out of the 44 CRKs, 25
(nine with statistical significance FDR [False Discovery
Rate]-corrected p-value ≤ 0.1; additional file 1) showed
more than two-fold higher mRNA abundance after 1hour exposure to O3 (Figure 1). After a 6-hour O3 exposure followed by a 2-hour recovery period, 26 CRKs
exhibited a more than two-fold increase in expression
(eight with statistical significance FDR-corrected p-value
≤ 0.1; additional file 1). Only CRK22, CRK30, CRK32,
CRK33 and CRK46 showed decreased expression in
response to O3-treatment. In order to analyze if transcriptional regulation after exposure to O3 was a feature
of a single subset of the CRKs, the protein sequence of the
kinase domain of all CRKs was aligned to construct a
Neighbour-joining tree representing the relations
between the members of the CRK group of RLKs (Figure
2). CRKs that were transcriptionally regulated in response
to O3 are high-lighted. O3-regulated genes were distributed across the tree instead of forming a unique branch.
However, closely related genes showed a tendency to
share similar O3 expression patterns.
CRK transcriptional response to light stress

To determine the effects of light stress-induced ROS production, we monitored the expression of ASCORBATE
PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2), encoding a ROS scavenger and
established marker for light-induced ROS production
[42]. APX2 was strongly induced after 1- and 2-hour
exposure to light stress conditions (Figure 3). In contrast
to O3 (Figure 1), light stress led to rapid transcriptional
repression of several CRKs (Figure 3). Twenty CRKs were
transcriptionally repressed while only eight exhibited
increased expression. However, the light-dependent regulation of the CRKs was not statistically significant. The
lack of transcriptional induction in response to light
stress corresponds to results from Lehti-Shiu et al. [40],
who reported that the CRKs were transcriptionally
strongly induced in response to biotic stimuli but the
expression level decreased in response to abiotic stress
(including heat, cold, drought and salt). Of the abiotic
treatments, only UV-B, osmotic stress and wounding
resulted in increased expression of CRKs [40].
CRK transcriptional response to PAMPs is similar to the O3
response

To more broadly address transcriptional regulation of the
CRKs, we analyzed and compared their expression profiles from publicly available Affymetrix chip data. Raw

Page 4 of 19

data files were obtained from several databases (see material and methods) and RMA (Robust Multi-Array Average) normalized. To take the sample variation into
account, parametric bootstrapping combined with Bayesian hierarchical clustering [43] was applied. This results
in a numerical measure of similarity between treatments
and genes, which can be clustered hierarchically (Figure
4; for a related application, see [44]). The meta-analysis of
the publicly available O3 microarray data revealed high
overlap with our qPCR data; all eight genes with more
than 3-fold increased expression in the publicly available
array data exhibited increased expression in our qPCR
analysis. Treatment with norflurazon (which increases
singlet oxygen [1O2] in the chloroplast causing excess
ROS production) led to decreased expression of four
CRKs. Norflurazon blocks carotenoid biosynthesis and
thus removes this quencher of the triplet chlorophyll and

to oxygen. The O 2 is subsequently dismutated to H2O2.
Paraquat had no effect on CRK expression with the
exception of the latest time point tested (24 hr), whereupon five CRKs exhibited increased expression; four of
which were also regulated in response to O3. However, at
this time point paraquat had most likely induced cell
death. H2O2 treatment selectively led to increased expression of a few CRKs which also displayed increased expression by O3. Rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial
electron transport causing elevated ROS production in
mitochondria) had little impact on CRK expression; only
CRK3 showed increased expression levels. Thus, the CRK
expression profile triggered by O3 was not related to
expression profiles established by other ROS treatments.
Instead, the O3-triggered CRK expression profile clustered together with that provoked by several biotic and
PAMP treatments, including Blumeria graminis var. hordei (Bgh), harpin Z (HrpZ), and the flagellin elicitoractive epitope flg22 (Figure 4).
Our qPCR analysis confirmed the changes caused by
flg22 in the expression profile of the CRKs obtained from
publicly available microarray data (Additional file 2 and
Figure 4). Treatments with benzothiadiazole S-methylester (BTH; an active SA analog) resulted in two-fold or
higher up-regulation of 12 CRKs, some of which also
exhibited elevated expression in response to O3. Interestingly, in the non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1
(npr1) mutant these genes were not regulated by BTH
treatment (Figure 4), indicating that SA regulation of
these genes was dependent on NPR1-mediated signalling.
Application of methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) did not cause
any major changes in CRK expression (Figure 4), whilst
ABA treatment resulted in decreased expression of

CRK25, CRK30, CRK28, CRK29, CRK19, CRK21 and
CRK22 at late time points. Overall, the CRK expression
profile in response to BTH clustered together with that
triggered by O3, pathogen and PAMP treatments;
whereas CRK transcriptional regulation upon ABA application clustered together with paraquat, norflurazon,
rotenone and MeJA treatments (Figure 4).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CRK
expression profile in response to O3 is not related to treatments which mediate ROS production in the chloroplast
or the mitochondria. However, there is a substantial overlap between the transcriptional responses to O3 and
pathogen infection/PAMP perception, which may be a
result of apoplastic ROS commonly generated by all these
stimuli.
CRKs display different expression in hormone mutants

Altered transcriptional regulation of several CRKs has
previously been shown following external application of
the plant hormone SA or its active analog BTH (Figure 4
and [19]). In order to address the impact of hormone signalling on transcriptional regulation of CRKs, we used
several mutants impaired in hormone biosynthesis and/
or signalling. The salicylic acid induction deficient 2
(sid2) mutant is deficient in SA biosynthesis (due to a
mutation in the SA biosynthesis gene ISOCHORISMATE
SYNTHASE 1 [ICS1]), whilst npr1 is impaired in SA signalling. The dnd1 mutant fails to produce a hypersensitive response (HR), but has functional effector-triggered
immunity, constitutive systemic resistance and accumulates elevated SA levels [45-47]. The ethylene insensitive 2
(ein2) mutant is deficient in ET signalling, and the fatty
acid desaturase 3/7/8 (fad3/7/8) mutant is deficient in JA
biosynthesis. We compared the transcript abundance of
CRKs in these mutants to Col-0 wild type plants using
qPCR. The obtained Actin-2-normalized threshhold
cycle values (Ct) were compared between Col-0 wild type
and the mutants. Several CRKs showed lower expression
in sid2 and npr1 (Figure 5A). CRK29 displayed higher
expression in sid2 and ten CRKs (three with statistical
significance FDR-corrected p-value ≤ 0.1) exhibited
higher expression in npr1. In the ein2 and fad3/7/8
mutants, for nine and twelve CRKs, respectively, expression levels were elevated as compared to wild type plants.
Only CRK7 and CRK8 showed lower expression in ein2.
Along with several other defects, dnd1 exhibits constitutive SA responses [48], which might be the cause for the
increased transcript levels of 15 CRKs in dnd1 signalling however, other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled
out due to the pleiotropic nature of the mutant [48].
Expression of some CRKs was unaltered or displayed only
subtle changes in the sid2 mutant, but was elevated in
npr1, ein2, fad3/7/8 and dnd1 mutants (CRK6, CRK23,
CRK26, CRK36, and CRK45). Interaction between hor-

Expression of all members of the CRK group of plant RLKs was analyzed
by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) in Col-0 plants exposed to 250
ppb O3 for 6 h. Samples were harvested at 1 or 8 h (6 h followed by 2 h
recovery under clean air conditions) after the onset of the O3 treatment. Transcript levels were calculated by comparison of O3-exposed
plants with corresponding control plants grown under clean air conditions harvested in parallel with the O3-treated plants. An expression
level of one indicates no change in expression, increased expression is
indicated by values larger than one while decreased expression is
shown by values smaller than one. Increase in expression by 2-fold or
higher is high-lighted in red and decrease in expression by 2-fold or
more in green. NR - no reproducible data could be obtained for this
gene. The experiment was repeated four times; fold change was calculated from the average normalized cycle difference of all biological repeats. Statistical significance (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrected pvalue ≤ 0.1) is indicated with asterisks (see additional file 1).

mone signalling pathways is an established phenomenon
[24,37], and the CRKs above exemplify that altering the
balance of SA, JA or ET response leads to altered gene
expression.
To test the robustness of gene expression in this set of
hormone mutants, we compared two different growth
conditions. These differed in photoperiod, light composition and intensity, soil composition and humidity (see
Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the
differences in the growth conditions), subsequently
referred to as Weiss chamber (Figure 5A) and Phytotron
(Figure 5B). Notably, the dnd1 mutant did not grow
under Phytotron conditions. The higher transcript abundance of CRKs in ein2 and fad3/7/8 observed in plants
grown under Weiss chamber growth conditions was
largely absent in plants grown under Phytotron growth
conditions (Figure 5B). Moreover, the CRKs which
showed higher gene expression in npr1 under Weiss
chamber growth conditions, were unaltered (or had even
reduced transcript levels) in the Phytotron. Taken
together, these results indicate that hormones play a

Page 7 of 19

major role in the transcriptional regulation of many
CRKs. However, environmental growth conditions also
have a large impact on the extent of this regulation especially in soil grown plants [49,50].
O3-response of the CRKs in hormone mutants

To further study the role of SA, ET and JA in ROS signalling, wild type and the sid2, npr1, dnd1, ein2 and fad3/7/8
mutants were exposed to O3. A subset of 23 O3-induced
and one O3-repressed CRKs were selected for expression
analysis in the mutant backgrounds by qPCR (Figure 6).
Most O3-induced CRKs exhibited even higher expression
levels in sid2 and npr1 as compared to wild type, with the
exception of CRK10, CRK11, CRK20 and CRK29. In ein2,
the magnitude of CRK induction was reduced. In the JAdeficient fad3/7/8 mutant, the increased expression of
CRKs in response to O3 was in several cases reduced or
even absent as compared to wild type plants. Remarkably,
O3-triggered increase in expression of CRKs was absent
in dnd1 (Figure 6). In summary, these results suggest that
the plant hormones SA, JA and ET play central roles in

Figure 4 Bayesian hierarchical clustering of the CRKs in abiotic and biotic stress experiments. Biotic and abiotic stress data sets were down
loaded from public databases and included O3, norflurazon, paraquat, BTH (benzothiadiazole S-methylester), various elicitors and pathogens (see materials and methods for complete details). Red and green indicate increased or decreased expression compared to untreated plants, respectively. The
intensity of the colours is proportional to the absolute value of the fold difference.

the regulation of the expression of the CRK subfamily,
both under control conditions (clean air), as well as in
response to O3.
To expand the model for O3 regulated gene expression,
we tested several other O3 inducible marker genes. These
genes were selected to represent "classical" marker genes
for SA (including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1
[PR-1] and PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 2 [PR-2]
and JA/ET (PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 [PDF1.2]). In addition
we selected genes based on our previous O3 microarray
data (SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 21 [SAG21]
[51]), and genes which have previously been described as
JA-regulated
(MONODEHYDROASCORBATE
REDUCTASE [MDHAR] [52]) or SA- and NPR1-regulated (LECTIN-LIKE PROTEIN [LLP] At5g03350 [53]).
The overall regulation of the marker genes was obtained
by clustering them in response to biotic and abiotic stress
and hormone treatments (Figure 7A). Most of the genes
were regulated in response to BTH, biotic stress treatment and O3, and the MDHAR gene was confirmed as a
JA marker gene, as previously reported [52]. However,
there was a lack of overall "specificity" in marker gene
expression, i.e., several hormones or stresses were altering their expression. The marker genes were next tested
with qPCR in the same O3 samples used for CRK expression. The genes were strongly induced in Col-0 wild type
plants and in most mutants. However, in dnd1 the O3induced signalling pathway(s) was evidently blocked
since O3-induced gene expression was not observed or it
was severely reduced. Only PATHOGENESIS-RELATED
GENE 5 (PR-5) was weakly induced in dnd1 at the later
time point. The classical SA marker genes PR-1 and PR-2
had reduced O3-induced increased expression in sid2 and
npr1, indicating a role for SA signalling in response to O3.
The loss of O3 induction of MDHAR in fad3/7/8 confirmed the importance of JA in regulation of this gene.
Light stress response of the CRKs in hormone mutants

To elucidate the role of SA, JA and ET in the regulation of
CRK expression in response to light stress, wild type and
the sid2, npr1, ein2 and fad3/7/8 mutants were exposed
to light stress and the subset of O3-regulated CRKs was
analyzed by qPCR. The transcriptional repression
observed in response to light stress (Figure 3) for a majority of CRK family members was even more pronounced
for some CRKs in sid2 (Figure 8). Interestingly, several
CRKs were specifically transcriptionally induced by light
stress in the ein2 mutant. In fad3/7/8, most CRKs exhibited a transient decrease in gene expression at early time
points. However, statistical significance was overall low
for the light-dependent regulation of the CRKs in the hormone signalling and biosynthesis mutants (Additional file
1).

CRK promoter analysis

Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors and
the promoter elements they bind to. The 500 base pair
(bp) and 1000 bp upstream promoter regions of the
CRKs were inspected for significantly enriched promoter
elements based on a list of verified Arabidopsis promoter
elements
(http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/Atcis
DB/bindingsites.html[54]). The CRKs were divided into
three groups ("CRKs all", "CRKs O3 up" - O3 increased
expression and "CRKs O3 down" - O3 decreased expression) and searched for significant accumulation of single
promoter elements or a combination of promoter elements. Statistical significance was measured with the
Fisher exact test using false discovery rate correction [55].
The enrichment was calculated separately for the motifs
in both forward and reverse orientations. No elements
were enriched in the 1000 bp region for any of the groups
or in the 500 bp region of O3 down genes. One element,
the W-box, a target for WRKY transcription factors frequently found in the promoters of SA-regulated genes
[56], was significantly overrepresented as a single motif in
the group of "CRKs all" and "CRKs O3 up" in the 500 bp
region (Table 2 and Additional file 3). Interestingly, several pairs of promoter elements were present with high
statistical significance in the 500 bp region for the "CRKs
O3 up" and "CRKs all" groups. Since these were mostly the
same for both groups and had high statistical significance
for the all group, this indicated that they were probably
not responsible for the O3-regulation of these genes. The
W-box was the only element enriched as a single motif
but also present in most pairs of promoter elements. This
indicated that the W-box, alone or in combination with
other elements, could be a target for the SA and/or
pathogen regulation of CRKs.

Discussion
The RLK family is one of the largest gene families in the
Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Several RLKs have previously been described to be involved in plant-microbe
interactions [14,15,57-59] and abiotic stress [60,61].
Based on statistical analysis of gene expression data,
RLKs in general, as well as the CRK subfamily, are more
likely to have altered expression in response to abiotic
and biotic stress than other Arabidopsis genes [40,62]. We
analyzed the expression profile of the CRKs in detail
using qPCR and array analysis under various stresses,
growth conditions, and in different genetic backgrounds
to obtain a better understanding of the signalling pathways leading to transcriptional regulation of the CRKs
and to elucidate the role of apoplastic ROS in stress signalling.
The use of ROS as signalling molecules is a common
feature of many stress responses [25]. Pathogen attack

Figure 6 O3-regulation of CRKs is different in hormone mutants. The expression of 24 O3-regulated CRKs was analyzed by qPCR in Col-0 and sid2,
npr1, dnd1, ein2 and fad3/7/8 exposed to 250 ppb O3 for 6 h. Samples were harvested at 1 or 8 h (6 h plus 2 h recovery under clean air conditions) after
the onset of the O3 treatment. Transcript levels for Col-0 or each mutant line were calculated by comparison of O3-exposed plants with corresponding
control plants of the same line grown under clean air conditions. An expression level of one indicates no change of expression, increased expression
is indicated by values larger than one while decreased expression is shown by values smaller than one. Increase of expression by 2-fold or higher is
high-lighted in red and decrease in expression by 2-fold or more in green. NR - no reproducible data could be obtained for this gene. The experiment
was repeated four times; fold change was calculated from the average normalized cycle difference of all biological repeats. Statistically significance
(Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrected p-value ≤ 0.1) is indicated with asterisks (see additional file 1).

and perception of PAMPs are often associated with an
oxidative burst in the apoplast [63]. Similarly, a hallmark
of the early O3 response is the generation of an oxidative
burst in the apoplast [64]. ROS are also produced in other
subcellular compartments, including the chloroplast,
where light stress or treatments with the herbicides paraquat or norflurazon elicit elevated ROS production. In
addition, crosstalk between pathways elicited by apoplastic ROS and chloroplast-derived ROS is important for the
regulation of cell death [32]. The transcriptional response
to apoplastic ROS, e.g. induced by O3, is strikingly different from chloroplast-derived ROS, e.g., induced by paraquat [30]. To further dissect the role of apoplastic ROS,
we clustered several treatments triggering ROS production in distinct subcellular compartments together with
various biotic stress experiments. Our results showed
that the CRK expression profile upon O3 exposure was
most similar to those stimulated by PAMP perception
(flg22 and HrpZ) and pathogen infection (Bgh) (Figure 4).
By contrast, treatments, which increased ROS levels in
the chloroplast (norflurazon and paraquat) or mitochondria (rotenone; which might also lead to ROS production
in the chloroplast [65]) either had no effect on CRK gene
expression or resulted in down-regulation. These results

show that transcriptional induction of the CRKs can be
triggered by apoplastic ROS, whereas chloroplastic ROS
mainly lead to decreased expression. Furthermore, cluster analysis separated the effects of plant hormones: BTH
(SA analog) caused a similar expression profile as O3 and
PAMP treatments, whereas CRK expression in response
to ABA and MeJA was related to norflurazon and paraquat treatments.
To extend the microarray meta-analysis, transcript
accumulation of the CRK subfamily was monitored in
response to O3 and light stress by qPCR. Out of 44 CRKs,
32 showed increased expression after exposure to O3 at
both time points while five members exhibited decreased
expression. Light stress treatment led to a decrease in
expression of the majority of the CRKs. Thus, in agreement with the results from array analysis, ROS production in different cellular compartments produces
strikingly different transcriptional profiles on the CRK
gene subfamily.
To further dissect the O3 response, mutants deficient in
biosynthesis, perception and signalling of SA (sid2, npr1),
JA (fad3/7/8) and ET (ein2) were exposed to O3 and the
expression of a subset of CRKs was analyzed by qPCR.

was higher in sid2 and npr1 implying that SA acts as a
negative regulator of the ROS signalling pathway. The O3mediated transcriptional induction of CRKs was almost
abolished in fad3/7/8 and attenuated in ein2, suggesting
that JA, and to a lesser extent ET are required for the
proper transcriptional induction of CRKs in response to
O3. This role for SA, JA and ET in O3 signalling has been
previously proposed based on the results from cDNA
macroarray analysis [66]. The effect of light stress on the
CRK expression in various mutant backgrounds was very
different compared to the effect of the O3 response.
Whereas ET acts as positive regulator of CRK expression
in the O3 response, it appears to be a negative regulator in
light stress since several CRKs displayed light stressinduced expression only in the ein2 mutant (Figure 8).
Under light stress conditions, the decreased expression of
CRKs seen in wild type was even more pronounced in the
SA mutants sid2 and npr1 and the JA mutant fad3/7/8.
DND1 encodes CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED
CHANNEL2 (CNGC2) which transports Ca2+ into the
cell and regulates nitric oxide production [67]. The complete lack of an effect of O3 on CRK and marker gene
expression in dnd1 suggests an important role for
CNGC2 in the O3 response pathway, possibly by regulat-

ing Ca2+ levels (Figure 6 and 7B). Previous studies have
shown that O3 rapidly invokes Ca2+ transients [68,69] and
blocking of Ca2+ transport can prevent ROS-induced cell
death [70]. The dnd1 mutant also has several pleiotropic
phenotypes which include elevated SA levels and constitutive defence responses [47]. Consequently, the lack of
O3 response in dnd1 could be due to "dominance" of SA
signaling over the ROS signalling pathway, and O3 would
have no effect when the SA pathway is fully stimulated.
Previous reports have shown that several members of the
CRK subfamily were transcriptionally induced through
an external application of SA [19] or BTH (Figure 4). The
response of CRKs to BTH was completely blocked in
npr1, indicating that the SA pathway for regulating CRKs
requires NPR1.
Intriguingly, different growth conditions had a strong
impact on the expression of CRKs in various mutants.
Several CRKs were expressed to higher levels in ein2 and
fad3/7/8 in Weiss chamber-grown plants compared to
Phytotron-grown plants. In contrast, the decreased
expression of several CRKs in sid2 and npr1 was similar
between two different growth conditions (Weiss chamber
and Phytotron, Figure 5). A strong effect of environmental conditions on mutant phenotypes, transcript profiles

The promoters of the CRK family were analyzed for enrichment of Arabidopsis verified promoter elements. Enrichment was calculated for
single and double motifs in both plus and minus orientation. The CRKs were divided into three groups for the analysis: "CRKs all", "CRKs O3 up"

on either forward or reverse strand. The CRKs containing the respective motifs are shown in additional file

and other parameters are well known and a common
problem when comparing results from different laboratories [71]. There could be several reasons for the differences in the expression levels of the CRKs between the
Weiss chambers and the Phytotron growth conditions.
Plants were tested at slightly different ages and grown in
different soil (see materials and methods section). Illumination in the Weiss chambers was provided using fluorescent lamps while in lighting in the Phytotron was using
metal halide lamps with different light spectra. Notably,
the CRKs are responsive to UV-B [40]. This suggests that
light conditions could have an effect on the expression
profile of this RLK family. Another reason for this variation of gene expression could be that under control conditions most CRKs were expressed at very low levels;
consequently, a minor perturbation either by genetic
mutation or growth condition could lead to altered
expression. Thus, expression of CRKs is very sensitive to
the surrounding environment. Similar observations have
been reported for the expression of the classical PDF1.2
marker gene [49,50]. This gene has long been used to
exemplify co-regulation by JA/ET. However, PDF1.2 is
only regulated by both hormones when plants are grown
in vitro [49]. When plants are grown in soil, either hormone alone (JA or ET) is sufficient to induce expression.
Thus, growth in soil is able to induce or prime defence
signalling pathways.

Conclusions
Based on the CRK expression patterns and integrating
current knowledge of ROS signalling, PAMP perception
and light responses [25,26,38,72], we propose a model for
the regulation of increased expression of the CRKs (Figure 9): O3 induces ROS production in the apoplast which
is perceived by putative "ROS receptors" (or by other
mechanisms) amplified by PLANT RESPIRATORY
.−
BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG (RBOH)-mediated O 2
production, thus leading to activation of DND1/CNGC2.
This activates further down-stream signalling events
where JA and to a lesser extent ET act as positive regulators, and SA and NPR1 as negative regulators of CRK
expression. Eventually, the signal reaches the nucleus
where transcription factors bind to a "ROS" promoter element and activate transcription. In parallel, the genes are
also regulated through a SA (synthesized by ICS1) and
NPR1-dependent pathway converging on the W-box promoter element. Microbes and PAMPs could activate both
pathways at different timing; a rapid pathway would act
through a RBOH mediated ROS production and use the
"ROS pathway", while a later "SA pathway" requires
increased SA biosynthesis and NPR1. Further interconnections between the pathways are provided by the primary
ET
transcription
factors
ETHYLENE

INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE
3-LIKE (EIL1) which repress SID2/ICS1 expression and
thus decrease SA levels [73]. Light stress or chemical
treatments that increase ROS in the chloroplast activate
separate signalling pathway(s) mainly leading to repression of CRK expression, which could involve ABA and
negative crosstalk with the SA pathway.
Is it possible to separate the roles of chloroplastic and
apoplastic ROS in the regulation of CRK expression?
Chloroplast-derived ROS production is known to be
involved in the regulation of cell death during pathogen
infection and in response to abiotic stress [74,75]. Specific removal of chloroplastic ROS prevents pathogeninduced cell death but has no impact on defence gene
expression [75]. Furthermore, chloroplastic 1O2 regulates
cell death dependent on EXECUTER1 [31]. In comparison, apoplastic ROS might be involved with intra- and
intercellular signalling [76]. Thus, apoplastic ROS would
have a role in regulating defence gene expression and
chloroplastic ROS in regulation of cell death. In addition,
there is crosstalk between apoplastic ROS and chloroplast ROS; rapid ROS production in the chloroplast can
be detected in response to O3 and blocking of ROS production in the chloroplast reduces O3-induced cell death
[32,77]. Clearly, ROS regulation of defence signalling and/
or cell death is very complex and several other regulatory
components have been identified, including LESION
SIMULATING DISEASE 1 (LSD1), ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and PHYTOALEXIN
DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), which are also involved in acclimation to light stress [42,78]. The only known phenotypes for CRKs have been obtained by ectopic
overexpression, which induces HR-like cell death independent or dependent on SA signalling (depending on
the specific CRK) [22,23]. How this induction of cell
death might be achieved is still unclear since transcriptional regulation of CRKs occurs in response to apoplastic rather than chloroplastic ROS. Some members of the
RLK family might participate in a positive feed-forward
loop to regulate ROS production, defence gene expression, cell death and hormone signalling. This regulatory
loop might be deregulated after overexpression of the
CRKs leading to the observed cell death phenotypes.
However, this will require experimental verification in the
future.
What is the role of CRKs in plants and why are they
regulated by PAMPs and O3 treatment? The external
domain of these RLKs could be the receptor for as yet
uncharacterized PAMPs and they could be part of plant
immune responses. An intriguing feature of the DUF26
domain is the presence of a conserved cysteine motif C8X-C-2X-C. The configuration of cysteines is similar to
the cysteine motif in the GRIM REAPER protein, which

Wrzaczek et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/95

has been shown to be involved in the regulation of ROS
induced cell death [79]. Despite the ubiquitous role of
ROS as signalling molecules in plants, no direct receptor
for ROS has been described. Since cysteines are sensitive
to redox modifications, could the DUF26 domain act as
sensor of ROS in the apoplast and be the putative ROS
sensor as depicted in Figure 9?

Methods
Plant growth conditions and treatments
Weiss chamber growth conditions

For exposure to O3, Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 or mutant
plants were grown in a peat/vermiculite (1:1) mixture for
21 days in Weiss 1300 growth cabinets (photon flux density 250 μmol m-2 sec-1; tubular fluorescent lamps) under
12 hours day length (day: 23°C 70% relative humidity;
night 18°C 90% relative humidity). Lights were switched
on at 7 AM and off at 7 PM. O3 treatments were started at
9 AM. 21-day old plants were used and exposed to 250
parts per billion (ppb) O3 for 6 hours. Samples were harvested at the times indicated in the respective experiments after the onset of the O3 treatment. Samples were
taken in parallel from O3 treated and clean air control
plants and immediately shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Phytotron growth conditions

For light stress treatments, plants were grown on a prefertilized garden soil/vermiculite (1:1) mixture for 28 days
under 8 h/16 h light/dark at 22 or 20°C, respectively, and
50% humidity at a light intensity of 130 μmol m-2 sec-1
photon flux density (Metal halide lamps). For light stress
treatment, plants were shifted to 1300 μmol m-2 sec-1
photon flux density for up to 4 hours. Subsequently,
plants were returned to a light intensity of 130 μmol m-2
sec-1 photons. Controls were kept at 130 μmol photon
flux density throughout the duration of the treatment and
samples were taken in parallel with the light stresstreated plants. Samples were harvested at the times indicated in the respective experiments after the onset of the
light stress treatment and immediately shock-frozen in
liquid nitrogen.
For flg22 treatments, plants were grown on MS plates
with Nitsch vitamins (MSN). After 7 days, seedlings were
transferred to liquid MSN media and cultivated for 7
days. Before the flg22 treatment, fresh medium was
added. After a 1 hour recovery period, the seedlings were
treated with 100 nM flg22. Controls were treated with
H2O. Samples were harvested at the times indicated in
the respective experiments after the onset of the treatment and in parallel from corresponding controls and
immediately shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
RNA extraction and qPCR analysis

RNA was isolated as described [79]. 5 μg total RNA was
DNaseI treated (Fermentas) and used for cDNA synthesis

Page 15 of 19

with RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) and Ribolock RNase Inhibitor (Fermentas)
according to manufacturers' instructions. The reaction
was diluted to a final volume of 50 μl and 1 μl cDNA was
used as template for PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR
Green I master mix (Roche Diagnostics) on a LightCycler
480 (Roche Diagnostics) in triplicate. Primer sequences
and the primer amplification efficiency (Ex; determined
according to manufacturers instructions) are available in
additional file 4.
For the normalization of the data several genes were
evaluated to select a suitable gene for normalization
based on the method of Vandesompele et al. [80]. Actin-2
(At3g18780) was found to be stably expressed in control
and ozone treated plants and was subsequently used for
normalization. The raw Ct values were normalized to
Actin-2 and used to compare the results from untreated
control samples with treated samples using the 2-ΔΔCt
method. The resulting normalized cycle differences were
used to calculate the average (μ) and standard deviation
(σ) of the biological repeats and the p-value (using SPSS)
based on [81]. The p-value was calculated using the onesample t-test in SPSS and calibrated using the BenjaminiHochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction [82]. The
95% confidence intervals (CI±; lower and upper bound)
m
were calculated according to CI ± = E x ±1.96s , where Ex is
the efficiency of the reaction x. The μ, σ, CI and p-value
for all qPCR experiments are shown in additional file 1.
The mean μ of the normalized cycle difference was used
to calculate the fold-change of expression using Ex (Additional file 4).

Phylogenetic analysis

RLK kinase domains were identified using PrositeScan
http://au.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/. Sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW2 program
[83]. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed with 1000
bootstrap sets using the Mega4 software package [84].

pathogen or treatments with pathogen derived elicitors (PAMPs). ROS is hypothetically perceived via a "ROS receptor" which could sense ROS directly
via protein modification, or via sensing of modified apoplastic proteins or other molecules that react with ROS. The perception of ROS initiates downstream signalling events. H2O2 is also able to cross the plasma membrane and enter the cells. Inside the cell, the signalling pathway is split into two
pathways. In the ROS pathway DND1/CNGC2 mediates a required step of the signalling pathway and JA and ET act as positive regulators, and SA and
NPR1 are negative regulators. In the SA pathway ROS or pathogens activate SA biosynthesis via ICS1; and NPR1 is a required component. Since NPR1
is a positive regulator of the SA pathway and a negative regulator of the ROS pathway this implies that the separate signalling pathway use different
transcription factors and promoter elements to regulate CRK expression, although it might be possible that two different transcription factors could
converge on the same promoter element. In addition the pleiotropic nature of the dnd1 mutant, including high SA-levels, could change the place of
DND1/CNGC2 in the model - constitutive SA signalling in dnd1 may limit the possibility for O3 to activate the ROS pathway. Through the transcription
factors EIN3 and EIL1 ET can repress SID2/ICS1 expression and SA levels. Increased ROS production in the chloroplast activates separate signalling
pathway(s) leading to repression of CRK expression. One of these pathways could involve ABA and negative cross talk with the SA pathway.

experiment 2) and The Integrated Microarray Database
System http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/imds (Experiment name: BTH time course, BTH experiment 2).
The raw Affymetrix data was preprocessed with RMA
using probe set annotations (custom cdf files) from http:/
/brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/, version 11.0.1. Biological repeats of each experiment were combined by computing a mean of the measured gene expression. Gene
expression was summarized by computing a log2 ratio of
the treatment and control expressions (differential
expression, DE). A visualization of the DE values is shown
in Figure 4. Variation of differential expression in an
∧

2

experiment e, s e , was estimated by summing the variances of (logarithm of ) treatment and control gene
expressions.
Parametric bootstrapping was implemented by generating 1000 samples for each experiment and each gene
from a Gaussian distribution with the estimated DE as
∧

2

the mean and s e as the variance.
Bootstrap samples were discretized to down regulated
(log2 DE < -1), no regulation (-1 < log2 DE < 1), and up
regulated (log2 DE > 1) genes. Bayesian agglomerative
hierarchical clustering algorithm was then applied to the
discretized bootstrap data. The Bayesian hierarchical
clustering algorithm computes the best number of clusters by Bayesian hypothesis testing. For each pair of genes
(and experiments, depending on the clustering direction),
the number of times they were assigned to the same cluster was computed. These gene (or experiment) similarities were then used as distances for computing the
hierarchical clustering (ward method) shown in Figure 4.
Promoter analysis

TAIR 9 version of promoter sequences of 500 bases and
1000 bases upstream of the Arabidopsis genes was downloaded from http://www.arabidopsis.org/. A list of verified Arabidopsis promoter elements was taken from
http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtcisDB/bindingsites.html[54]. The set of CRKs was divided into three
groups (all, ozone up-regulated and ozone down-regulated) and the plus and minus strands of the promoters
were searched for significant enrichment of single promoter elements or a combination of two promoter elements in either of the strands. Fisher exact test with false
discovery rate correction (q-values; [55]) was used for
measuring the significance of the enrichment; q-value of
0.05 was used as the threshold.

Additional file 2 Transcriptional regulation of the CRKs in response to
flg22. 14-day old Arabidopsis Col-0 were treated with 100 nM flg22 and
samples taken after 30 and 60 minutes (water-treated control samples have
been harvested at the same time points in parallel). Expression of several
CRKs was analyzed by qPCR. Transcript levels were calculated by comparison with the corresponding control plants. An expression level of one indicates no change in expression, increased expression is indicated by values
larger than one while decreased expression is shown by values smaller than
one. Increase in expression by 2-fold or higher is high-lighted in red and
decrease in expression by 2-fold or more in green.
Additional file 3 List of CRKs for promoter motifs in table 2. This file
lists the AGI codes for the CRKs containing the promoter motif combinations shown in table 2.
Additional file 4 Primer sequences for qPCR analysis. All primer
sequences used for qPCR analysis in the manuscript plus the experimentally determined primer amplification efficiencies Ex are listed.
