Abstract
Background: It is known that crustaceans and insects can persistently carry one or more viral
pathogens at low levels, without signs of disease. They may transmit them to their offspring or to
naïve individuals, often with lethal consequences. The underlying molecular mechanisms have not
been elucidated, but the process has been called viral accommodation. Since tolerance to one virus
does not confer tolerance to another, tolerance is pathogen-specific, so the requirement for a
specific pathogen response mechanism (memory) was included in the original viral accommodation
concept. Later, it was hypothesized that specific responses were based on the presence of viruses
in persistent infections. However, recent developments suggest that specific responses may be
based on viral sequences inserted into the host genome.
Presentation of the hypothesis: Non-retroviral fragments of both RNA and DNA viruses have
been found in insect and crustacean genomes. In addition, reverse-transcriptase (RT) and integrase
(IN) sequences are also common in their genomes. It is hypothesized that shrimp and other
arthropods use these RT to recognize "foreign" mRNA of both RNA and DNA viruses and use the
integrases (IN) to randomly insert short cDNA sequences into their genomes. By chance, some of
these sequences result in production of immunospecific RNA (imRNA) capable of stimulating RNAi
that suppresses viral propagation. Individuals with protective inserts would pass these on to the
next generation, together with similar protective inserts for other viruses that could be
amalgamated rapidly in individual offspring by random assortment of chromosomes. The most
successful individuals would be environmentally selected from billions of offspring.
Conclusion: This hypothesis for immunity based on an imRNA generation mechanism fits with
the general principle of invertebrate immunity based on a non-host, "pattern recognition" process.
If proven correct, understanding the process would allow directed preparation of vaccines for
selection of crustacean and insect lines applicable in commercial production species (e.g., shrimp
and bees) or in control of insect-borne diseases. Arising from a natural host mechanism, the
resulting animals would not be artificially, genetically modified (GMO).

Background
Pathologists of shrimp and insects are presented with the
paradoxical situation that individual viral pathogens may
sometimes cause severe disease but may also be carried as
active infections for long periods (including a full lifetime) without measurable signs of disease (see [1,2]for
reviews). In addition, it is curious that the massive viral
disease outbreaks experienced in shrimp cultivation
ponds have not, so far, been reported from natural populations in areas where severe pond outbreaks have
occurred [3]. This is despite the common detection of the
relevant viruses in grossly normal individuals from wild
shrimp populations (e.g., [4]).
Since shrimp and insects are able to survive for long periods with persistent infections, it is important in viral challenge tests to determine whether grossly normal test
animals are free of various viral pathogens prior to challenge and whether survivors are infected with the challenge virus post-challenge. After a challenge test, the
individuals may be "uninfected", "infected but not diseased" or "infected and diseased". Individuals in the
"infected and diseased" group may or may not recover. If
they do recover, they could conceivably end up either
"uninfected" or "infected but not diseased". The latter
would depend upon whether they could clear the pathogen or whether they remained persistently infected. These
different outcomes may vary with such things as viral isolate type and shrimp target species or shrimp life stage
within a single species [5,6]. Although distinguishing
between "uninfected" and "infected but not diseased" survivors has important ramifications for interpretation of
shrimp and insect responses to viral challenges, it is unfortunate that survivors are sometimes ambiguously labelled
simply as "resistant".
The capacity of shrimp and other arthropods to carry single or multiple viral infections without gross signs of disease is evident even with insect cells where persistent
single infections or co-infections can be easily produced
[7]. A theoretical viral accommodation model was proposed to account for the ubiquity of persistent infections
without signs of disease and directions for testing the
model were also proposed [1,2]. Briefly, the updated
model [2] proposed that shrimp and other arthropods
have an active (adaptive) mechanism for accommodation
of viral pathogens in a manner a) that leads to persistent
infections without signs of disease, b) that specifically
blocks viral-triggered, massive apoptosis called kakoapotosis (Greek kako = bad or detrimental) and c) that also
provides some protection against mortality upon subsequent superinfection with the same and possibly other
viruses [8,9]. An essential element for the viral accommodation model was an initially unknown pathogen recognition mechanism or memory mechanism [1] that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/32

allowed the host to respond specifically to each viral pathogen or variant. The recognition mechanism was later
proposed to be based on the presence of the viruses themselves in persistent infections [2]. However, recent information suggests that the specific response mechanism
may be based on heritable, viral genome fragments
inserted into shrimp and insect genomes.

Presentation of the hypothesis
Non-retroviral sequences in arthropod genomes
In 2006, Tang and Lightner [10] reported the occurrence
of non-infectious sequences of Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV) (formerly called infectious hypodermal
and hematopoietic necrosis virus or IHHNV) inserted into
the chromosomal DNA of Penaeus mondon from East
Africa and Australia. This necessitated a change in the routine method for detection of the infectious form of the
virus [11]. WSSV-like sequences have also been reported
from the genome of P. monodon from Australia [12]. In
addition, many viral-like sequences have been found in a
Fosmid clone library constructed from the P. monodon
genome [13]. A similar phenomenon has been reported
from insects [14,15]. Curiously, many of these reported
viral inserts are not retroviral in origin, and it is not
known how they became inserted into host genomes. On
the other hand, the PstDNV fragments in shrimp were
reported to be associated with transposable elements [10].
This raised the question as to whether shrimp and other
arthropods have a mechanism for integration of viral
sequences into their genomes in a manner that may play
some role in subsequent occurrence of persistent infections without signs of disease. For example, PstDNV is
endemic in the range of P. monodon, with which it generally causes no disease [16,17]. It was not discovered until
it jumped from grossly normal stocks of P. monodon
moved to the Americas for cultivation near the native species P. stylirostris with which it caused massive mortality
[18].
Host reverse transcriptases (RT) and integrases (IN)
If general viral sequences inserted into the host genome
constitute a potential mechanism for a specific, heritable
immune response in shrimp and insects, then there
should be a natural process that allows for insertion of
non-retroviral sequences into their genomes. A search of a
shrimp EST database revealed 5 different RT tags and 7 different IN and transposase tags [19]. RT and IN from retrotransposons, "endogenous retroviruses", retrovirus-like
elements with long terminal repeats (LTR) or other virallike elements in the genome are well known in the insect
literature [20-22]. Some of these are referred to as insect
erantiviruses, metaviruses or pseudoviruses [20,23-25].
The widespread occurrence of these virus-like elements in
arthropod genomes suggests that they may play some

Page 2 of 8

Biology Direct 2009, 4:32

functional role in their hosts, especially for those types
that are transmitted via the genome only.
The hypothesis
It is possible that random integration of viral genome
fragments into the host genome by host-derived RT and
IN could lead to antisense mRNA transcripts capable of
suppressing propagation of the same virus. Since the process would give rise to RNA via specific molecular steps, it
could be called an immunospecific RNA (imRNA) generation mechanism. Antisense constructs of Taura syndrome virus (TSV) have been shown to be effective in
protecting against TSV in transgenic shrimp [26]. Similar
results have been obtained using viral antisense sequences
in transgenic plants [27-30]. These antisense sequences
provide protection via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway that has been verified in both shrimp [31,32] and
insects [33,34]. If a natural process for imRNA generation
does exist, it would constitute a new type of heritable,
adaptive response to viral pathogens in crustaceans and
insects, and perhaps other arthropods.

A good target for this imRNA generation process would be
pathogen mRNA, since it constitutes a common metabolite for both RNA and DNA viruses. It would also allow for
molecular mechanisms to distinguish between host and
pathogen mRNA. For example, mRNA of cytoplasmic origin might be a key target. The variety of RT-like sequences
in the shrimp and arthropod databases supports the possibility that they could be involved in a non-self, "pattern
recognition" processes similar to those pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) characteristic of other
innate immune responses of invetebrates [35-37]. However, in contrast to other PAMP-based innate immune
responses, the imRNA generation process would have to
be considered a specific and heritable, adaptive response.
In summary, it is hypothesized that viral mRNA in shrimp
and insects is recognized as foreign (possibly by host RT)
and processed by host RT and IN for insertion of random
cDNA fragments into host genomic DNA. Some of these
fragments generate antisense, imRNA sequences that bind
with viral mRNA to induce the host RNAi mechanism and
suppress viral propagation. This leads to low-level, active
infections where the host exhibits no signs of disease but
may remain infected and infectious for naïve hosts. During reproduction, random assortment of chromosomes
allows for rapid mixing of protective inserts for various
pathogens, and selection from copious offspring allows
for rapid development of a population with multiple virus
tolerance. For example, the black tiger shrimp P. monodon
has 39 pairs of chromosomes leading to approximately
450 billion possible chromosome combinations from
females that produce in the order of 1 million eggs per
spawn in multiple spawns. By comparison, the number of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/32

possible combinations from the 23 pairs of human chromosomes is only in the order of 8 million. For insects
where recombination by crossover would be required
because of small chromosome numbers (e.g., Drosophila),
there may be compensation in the form of extremely large
populations, very short generation intervals and high
numbers of offspring.

Testing the hypothesis
Many experiments can be carried out to test this hypothesis. However, some relatively simple, preliminary tests
would reveal whether further pursuit would be fruitful or
not. For example, it predicts that host RT will be capable
of using viral mRNA sequences as a substrate for generation of cDNA sequences and that these will be inserted
into the host genome. Therefore, viral challenge followed
by genomic analysis of many infected, long-term survivors
(e.g., [38]) should reveal the presence of viral genome
fragments present in the host genome. These inserts
should be different for different individuals. Good candidate viruses would be RNA viruses (not retroviruses) since
it would be easy to prepare total host DNA, treat it with
RNase and probe it by dot blot for positive hybridization
with the total, labelled viral cDNA. Positive samples could
be tested further with labelled viral sub-clones to determine what fragments were inserted. Further analysis
would reveal the locations, polarity and potential imRNA
productivity of the inserts. Natural arthropods with viral
tolerance, or arthropods genetically selected for this character would also be good targets for this type of research.
For example, shrimp genetically selected for high tolerance to the positive-sense ssRNA virus TSV, are widely
used in the shrimp industry and are easily available
[39,40]. Also, the genomes of natural P. monodon specimens should contain inserts of PstDNV additional to
those already reported [10]. For these insert-screening
assays, it would be necessary to include DNA extracts from
eggs and sperm that have been separated from supporting
tissues, since inserts in the germ cells would be required
for heritable immunity.
According to the hypothesis, the host RNAi system should
be critical to the maintenance of low-level persistent infections in animals that survive viral challenges. Thus, knockdown of key gene transcripts such as those critical to the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) should lead to an
increase in viral replication and perhaps mortality in such
individuals. Targeting RT and IN knockdown may be less
informative if the host has more than one form of each.

Implications of the hypothesis
The hypothesized process for random imRNA production
is somewhat analogous to that for random antibody production in vertebrates where many antibodies are produced but only some are protective. By understanding the

Page 3 of 8

Biology Direct 2009, 4:32

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/32

process, it became possible to select only protective antigens for use in vaccination programs. Similarly, preparation of appropriate viral constructs or mimics could lead
to insertion of protective antisense fragments into shrimp
and crustacean genomes by a natural host process that
could not be called artificial genetic modification. Thus,
the resulting animals could not be considered genetically
modified organisms (GMO) and could be used in breeding programs to rapidly develop disease tolerant stocks for
animal production (e.g., shrimp and bees) or special
stocks to control disease transmission by insect vectors of
viral diseases such as Dengue fever. Similar tests could be
carried out in other arthropod groups to determine
whether the process occurs more widely in the phylum.

4. Random synthesis of cDNA fragments from foreign
mRNA by host RT

Conclusion

8. Induction of the host RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism

It is hypothesized that crustaceans and insects recognize
viral mRNA and use it as a target for random insertion of
viral sequences into their genomic DNA using endogenous RT and IN. These inserted sequences can produce
immuospecific RNA (imRNA) that binds with viral mRNA
to induce the RNAi mechanism and suppress viral propagation (Appendix). The hypothesis fits with the general
principle of invertebrate immunity based on a non-host
"pattern recognition" process. If correct, understanding
the process would allow directed preparation of vaccines
for selection of crustacean and insect lines applicable in
commercial production (e.g., shrimp and bees) or in control of insect-borne diseases. Arising from a natural host
mechanism, the resulting animals could not be considered artificially, genetically modified organisms (GMO).

Reviewer's comments
Reviewer's report 1
Akira Shibuya (Department of Immunology, Institute of
Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba

Reviewer Comments
The author describes a hypothesis that explains how
arthropods can persistently carry one or more viral pathogens without signs of disease. His conclusion is that host
endogeneous RT and IN recognize viral mRNA and insert
virus-derived cDNA sequences into the host genome, producing imRNA that suppresses viral propagation. This scenario is very interesting and persuasive, because several
previous reports may support the idea. However, I have
several concerns, as follows:

To inherit the resistance to a virus in the next generation,
it is required that the viral-derived DNA sequence be
inserted into host germ cells. However, this is not clearly
described and discussed.

Competing interests
The author declares that they have no competing interests.

Author's response
This is a very important point that was implicit in the
hypothesis but not specifically stated. It is now included
in the section on testing the hypothesis. As far as I know,
no tests have been done specifically on the presence of
such viral inserts in host germ cells.

Reviewer Comments
In my opinion, the term of "memory" in the title is not
suitable, if this is truly inherited, because memory itself
should be acquired and continue within one generation.
If a viral sequence is inserted into germ cells, this is actu-

ally inherited and programmed, but not acquired by the
next generation.

Reviewer's report 3
L. Aravind (NCBI/NLM/NIH, Bethesda MD, USA)

Author's response
I think this point is debatable, since DNA is a memory
molecule. The hypothesis proposes that the ability of
arthropods to specifically respond to viruses and their variants requires an initial infection event followed by a process that leads to genome insertions and specific RNAi
responses. I believe that the insertion could be considered
a kind of memory that may be passed on via germ cells to
the next generation that would be capable of the same,
specific RNAi response. On the other hand, it is possible
that some new technical term may be required to set this
phenomenon apart from the type of acquired immunity
related to antibodies. To avoid the issue somewhat in this
paper, I have reduced use of the word "memory" in the
text and replaced it with phrases such as a heritable and
specific pathogen response mechanism.

Reviewer Comments
It this article, TW Flegel presents a hypothesis for the phenomenon of specific memory in viral accommodation in
arthropods. This is postulated as being behind the low
level persistence of viruses without noticeable deleterious
effects on the host but instead conferring resistance to
super-infection. The hypothesis for memory presented
here tries to exploit two ideas: 1) Integration of DNA copies of the viral genome or fragments thereof into the host
genome. 2) A post transcriptional gene silencing process
utilizing transcripts derived from RNAs from these integrated copies. The hypothesis as presented here is certainly plausible as it invokes two processes that are known
to occur in eukaryotic genomes. Further, there is already
evidence for small RNA dependent defensive mechanisms
against genomic parasites, such as the piwiRNAs. The
mechanism presented here is not very different in a general sense from this and more well know RNAi based
defenses against RNA viruses.

Reviewer's report 2
Eugene V. Koonin (NCBI, NLM, NIH, Bethesda, MD,
USA).
Reviewer Comments
A very interesting and, in my opinion, promising hypothesis on the mechanism of heritable resistance to pathogens in arthropods. The idea is that short regions of viral
mRNAs are copied by host reverse transcriptase and the
copies are integrated in the genome where a few can be
utilized to produce small RNAs interfering with the
respective virus (imRNAs). The hypothesis is compatible
with the findings of numerous virus-specific inserts in
arthropod genomes and appears quite plausible.

Moreover, the idea seems particularly interesting in light
of the rapidly accumulating similar findings in plants [41]
and especially the discovery of the elaborate system of
defense against mobile genetic elements in bacteria and
archaea that functions on the same principle [42, 43, 44].
It is an intriguing possibility that defense system that
involve integration of foreign DNA into genomes and
thus represent a form of Lamarckian inheritance function
in most cellular life forms.
Author's response
I agree with these comments.

My primary criticism regarding this work is the evidence
the author supplies from existing arthropod genome
sequences for supporting the hypothesis. While the
author uses shrimp as the model, the statements in the
article clearly imply certain generality across arthropods.
Given that in phylogenetic terms the insects are nested
inside the crustacean radiation extending this generalization, at least to insects, is not without foundation. However, more clarification would be useful as to whether the
author implies that this memory phenomenon would be
restricted to crustaceans (including insects) or other all
arthropods or more generally across animals or even
eukaryotes.
Author's response
The hypothesis currently applies to crustaceans and
insects only because my evidence about non-retroviral
inserts comes exclusively from these groups. However, the
possibility that the mechanism may be more widespread
to include all arthropods and perhaps other eukaryotes
may be raised. I have changed the text and the title of the
manuscript to make it clear that I refer specifically to crustaceans and insects.
Reviewer Comments
Further, this generalization technically opens up the scope
for detection of viral sequences such as those postulated
by the author in the several completely sequenced and
publicly available genomic sequences of insects and crustaceans. However, while the author cites earlier papers for
integration of flaviviruses and certain prawn viruses, no
direct evidence from published genomic sequences is

offered. Such an analysis would have made the case much
stronger.
Author's response
I did a very preliminary search of complete insect
genomes using a few complete insect virus sequences but
did not find strong evidence to support my hypothesis.
For example, I used the complete sequence of Aedes
albopictus densovirus (NC_004285) for a discontinuous
Blastn search against Aedes aegypti. I found only small fragments of the densovirus sequence of around 20-40 base
pairs that matched mosquito sequences with identities of
90-100%. Curiously, many of these were associated with
repeat regions including mobile, transposable elements
like Ty1_copia, Ty3_gypsy, tRNA-related SINEs, m8bp
MITEs, PIF transposons, pogo transposons, Jockey NonLTR, Pao_Bel LTR, R1 Non-LTR, etc. Matches to similar
small fragments were obtained using the same virus in a
search against the human genome, but my quick perusal
did not reveal that these were related to repeat regions or
mobile, transposable elements. I was hesitant to make any
conclusion from this very superficial examination. I
believe that more detailed work would be required using
preliminary, pre-assembly sequences that were employed
to arrive at the polished, complete insect genome
sequences. Even then, the hypothesis proposes that different individual crustaceans or insects will be likely to carry
different combinations of inserts, possibly in different
locations in the genome and probably all in "non-functional" regions such as those occupied by transposable
elements and multiple repeats. Thus, use of complete
genome data arising from a very small number of standardized DNA samples (probably derived from laboratory
strains) might also affect the final result. Thus, I suggest
that this type of analysis should be included as another
test of the hypothesis.
Reviewer Comments
Secondly, if this mechanism is indeed widespread across
arthropods the question arises as to whether a dedicated
integrase and RT systems has been set aside for this. The
author mentions the endogenous retroviruses that might
provide integrases and RTs, but there is no more direct evidence presented for their involvement in cycling viral
cDNAs/DNAs into the genome. In mammals there are
some retrovirus derivatives with specialized NYN RNAse
domains and integrases (such as those we reported sometime back, see PMID: 17114934) [45] that could indeed
function in a similar process of anti-viral defense. Detection of such components in insect/crustacean genomes
could further strengthen the case and even provide targets
for directed experimental studies.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/32

Author's response
As with my response to the question on whole genome
searches, these are good questions that can be added to
the list of tests of the hypothesis. The evidence shows that
non-retroviral inserts can be found in insect and crustacean genomes. The hypothesis proposes that they arise
from the activity of host RT and IN that work together in
a directed process that results in an immunological
response. Any host RT or IN would be a potential candidate as a player in this process.
Reviewer Comments
A figure summarizing the processes in the hypothesis
would have been useful.
Author's response
A a figure of the stepwise process has been added to the
manuscript
Reviewer Comments
In terms of testing the hypothesis: Could insect models
such as Apis, Tribolium or Drosophila with already
sequenced genomes be used? There is already some
understanding of the RNA based interference in them.
Author's response
Yes, existing insects with complete genomes would be
excellent models to test the hypothesis. Please see my
response above to the previous question on analysis of
complete genome sequences.
Reviewer Comments
Could the mechanism involve any kind of link to the
ubiquitin-based viral protein degradation system? This
angle is suggested by expansions of F-box and other UbE3 ligase components in various viruses.
Author's response
Although this may be possible, it is not critical to the
hypothesis. It could be another avenue of research.
Reviewer Comments
In discussion of retroviruses like elements in arthropod
genomes the author mentions "pseudoviruses, metaviruses etc" and provides citations such as ref [25]. The elements presented here are not necessarily retroviruses; in
fact they are mobile elements that resemble DNA viruses
such as adenoviruses and NCLDVs in certain ways. For
example we note such elements in PMID: 15466593 [46]
(this describes the same elements mentioned in ref 25 of
this publication well before that publication) and PMID:
18753784 [47]. It would be worthwhile if the author
more clearly distinguishes the other types of virus-like elements which are retrovirus-like.

Author's response
Due to the general nature of the hypothesis, I tried to use
review papers of various retrovirus-like elements or other
viral-like elements that might provide RT and IN that
could participate in the process of viral mRNA recognition
and directed insertion of cDNA fragments into the host
genome. I have modified the text to clarify my intended
meaning.
