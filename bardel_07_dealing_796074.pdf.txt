Abstract
We recently described a new method to identify disease susceptibility loci, based on the analysis
of the evolutionary relationships between haplotypes of cases and controls. However, haplotypes
are often unknown and the problem of phase inference is even more crucial when there are missing
data. In this work, we suggest using a multiple imputation algorithm to deal with missing phase and
missing data, prior to a phylogeny-based analysis. We used the simulated data of Genetic Analysis
Workshop 15 (Problem 3, answer known) to assess the power of the phylogeny-based analysis to
detect disease susceptibility loci after reconstruction of haplotypes by a multiple-imputation
method. We compare, for various rates of missing data, the performance of the multiple imputation
method with the performance achieved when considering only the most probable haplotypic
configurations or the true phase. When only the phase is unknown, all methods perform
approximately the same to identify disease susceptibility sites. In the presence of missing data
however, the detection of disease susceptibility sites is significantly better when reconstructing
haplotypes by multiple imputation than when considering only the best haplotype configurations.

Background
In the last few years, various phylogeny-based approaches
have been developed to test for association between a candidate gene and a disease [1-4]. These tests are based on
the grouping of haplotypes according to their evolutionary relationships represented by a phylogenetic tree. This
grouping reduces the degree of freedom of the association

tests and thus, increases their power. Interestingly, the
haplotype phylogeny can also be used to precisely identify
loci involved in the determinism of the disease. We
recently described a new method to localize disease susceptibility loci (DS loci), based on the definition of a coevolution index (Vi) between the markers and the disease.
The markers showing the highest Vi are assumed to be

putative DS sites [4]. Simulations have shown that the
method performs well at identifying DS loci, especially
when several DS loci exist.
To reconstruct the phylogenetic tree, haplotype information is used. In most situation, this information is not
available from the data and needs to be inferred. In our
method, this was done by determining the most probable
haplotypes of the different individuals and analyzing
them as if they were the known haplotypes. However, this
approach may lead to incorrect inferences because it does
not take into account the uncertainty of the phase that
might be very large, especially in the presence of missing
data. In this context, the use of multiple imputation to
reconstruct missing phase and missing data might be an
interesting alternative. In this paper, we used the simulated data of Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW15) to
compare the relative power of these two approaches to
haplotype reconstruction to correctly identify the simulated DS sites when using a phylogeny-based analysis.

Methods
Data
We analyzed the 100 replicates simulated for GAW 15
(Problem 3). To apply a phylogeny-based method, we
need to work on a candidate region where the disease susceptibility site is typed, and where the recombination rate
is low. We used the answers to choose a 200-kb region of
chromosome 6 around the DR locus that contained two
DS sites: the DR locus and locus C. In this region, nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (including locus
C) were selected. A tenth biallelic locus was added, corresponding to the DR locus in which the lower risk alleles
DR1 and DRX were pooled. The linkage disequilibrium is
low within these ten sites: the highest r2 is between locus
C and SNP 4 (r2 = 0.65) and it is the only pair of loci with
an r2 above 0.2.

For each replicate the first affected child of the first 500
families was selected to obtain 500 trios. Missing data
were generated on the different loci (with the same percentage of missing data on each locus) on both parents
and children. In each replicates, the same individuals had
their genotypes missing at the same loci in order to ensure
a similar pattern of missing data over replicates.
Reconstruction of missing data and missing phases
Missing phases and missing genotypes were reconstructed
either only by an algorithm to infer the most probable
haplotypes without missing data for each individual, or
by a multiple imputation method. For both methods, the
first step was the inference of all the possible haplotypic
configurations and their probabilities. It was performed
with the software ZAPLO [5]. The first method then consists of picking the most likely haplotypes for each indi-

vidual. The only families kept for the analysis were those
with a low level of haplotype uncertainty; i.e., families
with a best configuration posterior probability >50% and
at least 25% difference between the posterior probabilities
of the best and second best configuration. Similar results
were obtained with other cut-off values (data not shown).
The multiple imputation procedure is the same as the one
described in Croiseau et al. [6]. Briefly, it consists of
repeating two steps: 1) given the current values of two
parameters (population haplotype frequencies and
affected child genotype frequencies), sampling a complete
data set according to the posterior probabilities of each
genotypic configuration and 2) given the current data set,
updating the two parameters. After a burn-in period of
1000 iterations, every 1000 iterations, the current complete data file was retained. We ran the algorithm until we
obtained ten complete data sets.
Identification of the susceptibility sites
The identification of the DS sites was performed with the
software ALTree [7]. At first, 1000 equiparsimonious
unrooted trees were reconstructed for the 30 most frequent haplotypes using the parsimony method implemented in the software PAUP*, version 4.0b10 [8]. To
ensure that various tree configurations were explored,
PAUP* was launched 10 times, 100 trees being retained
each time. Then, a new character called S, which represents the disease status, was defined for each haplotypes.
The state of this character depends on the proportion of
cases carrying a given haplotype (state 1 for a large proportion of cases and 0 otherwise). The character state changes
were optimized on the tree for each character (including
S) using the deltran option. A correlated evolution index
(Vi) was calculated between the changes of each site i and
the changes of the character S. This index was defined as
the difference between the number of observed and
expected co-mutations between site i and character S,
divided by the square root of the number of expected comutations [4]. To take into account the 10 imputed data
sets, we calculated the median of the Vi over these 10 data
sets. Finally, the sites with Vi ≤ 0 were discarded and the
two site(s) with the highest Vi are retained as putative DS
sites.

Results
The power to identify the DS sites is measured as the percentage of replicates among the 100 replicates available in
which the simulated DS sites have the highest Vi.
Missing phase
In Table 1, we compare the power to identify the DS sites
on the complete data set in three conditions: 1) when the
phase is known, 2) when only the best haplotype configuration is kept, or 3) when using multiple imputation to

Missing data
Figure 1 shows that for different rates of missing data, the
percentage of replicates in which the site with the highest
Vi (best site) is one of the two true DS site. Interestingly,
this percentage remains very similar for the different rates
of missing data when using multiple imputation. This is
not the case when considering only the most likely haplotypes with more than 15% of missing data. With the multiple imputation, there are fewer errors on the second best
site and more replicates in which no other site is detected
than when using the most likely haplotypes (Figure 1).

any): i) no second-best site is identified with a Vi > 0 (striped

second-best site is not a DS site (colored bars).

Figure 2 shows the percentage of replicates in which the
two best sites are the two simulated DS sites. For up to
20% of missing data, there is no difference of power when
using the most likely haplotypes or the multiple imputation method. For higher rates of missing data, the multiple imputation method leads to higher power but this is
not significant at the 5% level because the 95% confidence intervals overlap. The multiple imputation method
is found to be more accurate: it is significantly more powerful to identify only the two DS sites (no other site having
a Vi > 0).
The error rate, defined as the percentage of replicates in
which the true DS sites are not correctly identified, is presented in Figure 3. With the multiple imputation method,
the locus with the highest Vi is always either DR or locus

detected) and it drastically decreases the error rate for the
DS site identification. In this study, in the absence of missing data, no difference between the three phase imputation methods was found, but this is probably a particular
situation where phase is not very ambiguous thanks to the
familial information available. Indeed, when we use the
most likely haplotypes, only a mean of 12.48 families
(over 500 families in the sample) are discarded from the
analysis because of their high level of phase uncertainty.
The relative performance of the three methods might be

C (more often DR). There is also significantly less error on
the two best sites (sum of the error on the best site and on
the second best site) than when the most likely haplotypes are used. Indeed, this two best site error rate is stable
at around 10% for up to 30% of missing data and
increases to 35% for 50% missing data. On the contrary,
when the most likely haplotypes are used, the two best site
error rate constantly increases and reaches 70% for 50% of
missing data.

To tackle the problem of phase resolution, two types of
strategies were suggested. In one-stage procedures, the
phase inference and the analysis are performed simultaneously. In two-stage procedures, haplotype frequencies that
are estimated in the first stage are used as weights in the
second stage. Concerning phylogeny-based analyses, a
one-stage procedure will be very difficult to develop
because haplotypes need to be known to reconstruct the
phylogenetic tree. This probably explains why only twostage procedures have been proposed [2,9]. The problem
with these different two-stage methods is that the phylogenetic tree is reconstructed on all possible haplotypes,
even if they do not really exist. This can significantly
increase the number of haplotypes considered, and thus,
lead to an increase in the computation time (especially for
parsimony-based tree reconstruction) and possibly, to a
loss in power. With the multiple imputation method, ten
imputed files are analyzed, which will also increase the
computation time, but only the haplotypes observed in
these files are used in the phylogenetic reconstruction.
Further work will need to be done to compare the multiple imputation approach with these two-stage procedures.

Discussion

Conclusion

The analysis of the GAW15 simulated data allowed us to
confirm the power of phylogeny-based tests to identify
several DS sites located in the same region. We have
shown that the method is particularly powerful to identify
locus DR as a susceptibility site. This may be explained by
the very high risks attributed to individuals carrying the
DR4 allele. The method also allowed us to detect locus C,
generally as the second best site and with a lower power
than DR (Figure 3 shows more errors on the second best
site than on the best site). However, this locus only
increases the risk in women, and our analysis has been
performed regardless of the sex of the individuals.

In conclusion, the analysis of the GAW15 simulated data
shows that multiple imputation can be of great value in
dealing with missing genotypes prior to a phylogenybased analysis. In comparison with a strategy using only
the most likely haplotypes, it increases the chances to correctly identify disease susceptibility loci.
