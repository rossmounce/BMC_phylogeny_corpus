Abstract
Background: The nematode Pristionchus pacificus has been developed as a satellite organism in
evolutionary developmental biology for comparison to Caenorhabditis elegans. Comparative studies
have revealed major differences in the regulation of developmental processes between P. pacificus
and C. elegans. To place evolutionary developmental biology and the observed developmental
differences between species in a comprehensive evolutionary context, such studies have to be
complemented with ecological aspects. Knowledge about the ecology of the organism in question
might indicate specific environmental conditions that can result in developmental adaptations and
could account for species differences in development. To this end, we have started to investigate
the ecology of Pristionchus nematodes. In recent field studies in Western Europe we found six
Pristionchus species that are closely associated with scarab beetles and the Colorado potato beetle.
This Pristionchus – beetle association provides the unique opportunity to combine research in
evolutionary developmental biology with ecology. However, it remains unknown how general
these findings from Europe are on a global scale.
Results: Here, we describe the Pristionchus species associated with scarab and Colorado potato
beetles in the Eastern United States and show striking transatlantic differences and unexpected
evolutionary and ecological patterns. Twohundredeighty of 285 (98%) isolates from American
scarab beetles belong to five Pristionchus species, all of which are different from the European
species. We describe four of them as novel Pristionchus species. The five American Pristionchus
species fall into a single phylogenetic clade and have a male-female (gonochoristic) mode of
reproduction, whereas the majority of European isolates are hermaphroditic. Crosses between the
two most closely related species, P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp., follow Haldane's rule in
that heterogametic F1 males are inviable. We observed P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp.
coexisting on the same scarab beetle and obtained two cases of F1 hybrids from wild beetles.
Finally, the Colorado potato beetle is associated with the same nematode, P. uniformis in the United
States and Europe. Given the introduction of the Colorado potato beetle to Europe in 1877, our
results suggest that P. uniformis was introduced together with its beetle vector.
Conclusion: Taken together, the Pristionchus – beetle association provides a powerful tool for
studying biodiversity, biogeography, speciation and species invasion on a global scale.

Background
The diplogastrid nematode Pristionchus pacificus has been
developed as a satellite organism in evolutionary developmental biology [1]. P. pacificus is a hermaphroditic species
that can feed on E. coli and has a 3–4 day generation time
(20°C) [2]. Original studies in P. pacificus concentrated
on the developmental, genetic and molecular analysis of
sex determination, vulva and gonad formation [3]. More
recently, a genomic initiative including the generation of
a genetic linkage map and a physical map has complemented the developmental and genetic studies [4,5]. A
whole genome sequencing project is currently ongoing
and should result in a draft of the complete genome
sequence in the near future [1].
In general, little is known about the ecology of the nematode species used as laboratory organisms, such as P.
pacificus and C. elegans. For example, the environmental
niche of the model organism C. elegans is largely
unknown and only very recently did several studies indicate that C. elegans occurs predominantly in compost
heaps [6,7]. We have recently shown that nematodes of
the genus Pristionchus live in close association with scarab
beetles and the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in Western
Europe [8]. Intensive samplings in 2004 and 2005 generated 371 isolates that fell into six species, most of which
are morphologically indistinguishable from one another.
The two hermaphroditic species P. entomophagus and P.
maupasi accounted for 226 of these 371 (60%) isolates
and occurred on dung beetles and cockchafers, respectively. However, the satellite organism P. pacificus was neither observed on scarab beetles nor on the CPB in Western
Europe.
In total, 27 species of the genus Pristionchus are described
in the literature, but only four of these descriptions are
younger than 1958 and many are from the 19th century
[9]. Also, many of these descriptions are rather short and
lack illustrations. Type material does not exist in most
cases – either because it never existed or because it got lost.
Furthermore, it has long been known that morphometric
values of Pristionchus species change during culture under
laboratory conditions [10]. Taking this high phenotypic
plasticity into account, the 27 species descriptions contain
most likely a number of synonyms. Facing all of these
problems of „classical“ taxonomy, we have started to use
a novel methodology to investigate the biodiversity and
phylogeny of Pristionchus nematodes. Following the isolation of Pristionchus nematodes from wild caught beetles,
we establish isogenic female lines. These isogenic female
lines are first processed by SSU sequence analysis for
molecular barcoding. Previous studies have indicated that
this method is robust and provides a clear indication for
species identity or evidence for the existence of a novel
species [8]. To confirm the species identification by

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/14

molecular barcoding we perform mating experiments of a
new isolate with the reference strain of the representative
species. For the reference strain of a novel species, morphometric measurements are provided in addition to the
molecular sequence tag. Also, a frozen stock collection has
been established, type material is delivered to museums
and strains are available upon request. We strongly
believe that this comprehensive methodology – molecular barcoding, mating experiments, morphometric measurements, frozen stock collection and type material at
museum collections – provides the optimal tool for species identification and analysis in this group of nematodes.
In the present study we surveyed the association of Pristionchus species with scarab beetles and the CPB in the
Eastern United States, particularly in the states of New
York, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, Texas, and
Kansas. The two studies indicate striking differences in the
species composition, mode of reproduction and speciation frequency of Pristionchus species on the two continents. More than 98% of the Pristionchus isolates from the
Eastern United States represent five species, all of which
are unknown from Europe. Given the rationale described
above, we describe four novel Pristionchus species. These
results establish Pristionchus as a nematode model system
for biogeography and biodiversity and represent an
important difference to the biogeography of Caenorhabditis species. In addition, the analysis of Pristionchus species
in the US provided two unexpected cases that help to
establish Pristionchus as a future model system in two
additional areas of evolutionary biology and ecology,
namely speciation and species invasion. Crosses between
the two most closely related American species, Pristionchus
aerivorus and Pristionchus pseudaerivorus n. sp., result in
inviable males following Haldane's rule. Haldane's rule
states that in hybrids between diverging species the sterile,
absent or underrepresented offspring is of the heterogametic sex [11]. Finally, the CPB is associated with the
same nematode, Pristionchus uniformis in the US and
Europe. Given the introduction of the CPB to Europe in
1877, these results suggest that P. uniformis was introduced together with its beetle vector. Species invasion is a
common phenomenon in contemporary ecology and biogeography and the P. uniformis case reported in this study
might represent a useful tool for future genetic and molecular studies on species invasion.

Results
Five of the Pristionchus species found on scarab beetles in
the US do not occur in Europe
To determine if P. pacificus and other species of the genus
Pristionchus are associated with scarab beetles in the
United States, we analyzed beetles from Massachusetts,
New York, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska. The

scarab beetle fauna differs between North America and
Europe. For example, the cockchafer Melolontha melolontha and the dung beetle Geotrupes stercorosus that host
the predominant European Pristionchus species are not
known from North America. However, the subfamily Melolonthinae, which includes the june beetles and chafers,
contains more than 500 species in North America, some
of which are serious pests [12]. We used the same sampling strategies in Europe and the United States and collected scarab beetles from the US that are comparable
with those obtained in our European study. However, we
have not been able to sample identical species on both
continents. In total, we investigated 1241 beetles of more
than 15 genera yielding 285 Pristionchus isolates (Fig. 1,
Table 1). SSU sequence analysis and mating experiments
of the 285 isolates revealed that they fall into seven species, two of which were known to us (Fig. 2). We obtained

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/14

two strains of P. entomophagus (both from beetles from
Ohio), a hermaphroditic species that is one of the most
common Pristionchus species in Europe [8]. We also found
P. pacificus, but in no more than three beetle samples, one
from Ohio, one from Nebraska and one from Massachusetts. Surprisingly, the remaining 280 (98%) isolates represent five Pristionchus species, which had up to then
neither been found by beetle sampling in Western Europe
[8] nor by previous soil sampling in the United States
[13].
Nematode species of the genus Pristionchus have little
diagnostic morphological characters and usually show
overlapping ranges of morphometric values [14,8]. Prior
to our own studies on P. pacificus, only one Pristionchus
species, P. aerivorus, was described for North America by
Cobb in 1916 [9,15]. All previously obtained strains of P.
pacificus from North America result from soil samples
taken by various researchers [8,13]. It is important to note
that all of these soil-derived P. pacificus strains represent
random findings within a sampled locality. P. pacificus
was a rare nematode in these soil samples and multiple
isolates from the same soil sample are not available.
Morphometric analysis revealed that the most common
species in our analysis is very similar to P. aerivorus (Table
2). Thus, we have classified this species as P. aerivorus. The
four other species are described as novel species and we
provide morphological measurements, molecular SSU
sequence data, the results of mating experiments and species designations for all of them (Fig. 2, Table 2, see species diagnosis below). The reference strains of all species
are available as living cultures and frozen stocks in our
laboratory and can be provided to other researchers upon
request. Also, type material has been delivered to museums. Together, these five species account for the majority
of isolates from scarab beetles (Table 1). Specifically, we
obtained P. aerivorus (85 isolates), P. pseudaerivorus n. sp.
(71 isolates), P. marianneae n. sp. (45 isolates), P. pauli n.
sp. (35 isolates) and P. americanus n. sp. (1 isolate) in the
US scarab beetle survey. In the following, we provide the
diagnoses for the four novel Pristionchus species:

from the following sampling sites: Massachusetts (Two locations: Carver and Centerville), New York (six locations: Bellona, Waterloo, Hoover farm, golf court I and II, Geneva),
Ohio (One location : Wooster), Iowa (One location: near
Bellevue, Nebraska), Kansas (One location: Greensburg),
Texas (One location: Austin), and Nebraska (five locations:

Pristionchus marianneae n. sp
Diagnostic character: The species is characterized by a 471
bp sequence of a 1 kb fragment of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) that was amplified by PCR with the
primers shown in Materials and Methods. This SSU
sequence is distinct from the SSU sequence of all other
Pristionchus species, but is identical between all isolates of
P. marianneae. The sequence is shown in Fig. 2.

Pristionchus species sampled on American scarab beetles
are predominantly gonochoristic
The result of the US survey indicates a striking difference
in the mode of reproduction of North American and European beetle associated Pristionchus species. P. aerivorus, P.
pseudaerivorus n. sp., P. pauli n. sp., P. marianneae n. sp.
and P. americanus n. sp. are gonochoristic (male/female)
species and account for 98% of the isolates from scarab
beetles (Fig. 3). In contrast, more than 60% of the isolates
from scarab beetles in Western Europe belong to two hermaphroditic species, P. maupasi and P. entomophagus,
respectively (Fig. 3) [8]. Thus, North America and Europe
differ in the Pristionchus species associated with scarab
beetles and in the mode of reproduction of these nematodes.

The Pristionchus species from the US form a phylogenetic
clade together with P. maupasi
To determine if the Pristionchus biogeography would
match species phylogeny we incorporated the North
American species into the phylogenetic framework of the
genus Pristionchus with a representative of the closely
related genus Koerneria as outgroup (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus n. sp., P. pauli n. sp., P. marianneae n. sp. and P. americanus n. sp. form a single clade
and are much more closely related to one another than
the species found in Europe. P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus
n. sp. and P. americanus n. sp. are the most closely related
species and differ in only one out of 471 base pairs in their
SSU sequence (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the cockchafer-associated hermaphroditic species P. maupasi from Europe
belongs to the same clade and carries an SSU sequence
identical to the P. aerivorus sequence (Figs. 2, 4). A more
detailed analysis including several ribosomal protein
encoding nuclear genes distinguishes the two species and
indicates that P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. are
the two most closely related species and that P. maupasi is
the sister taxon to the P. aerivorus/P. pseudaerivorus n. sp.
species pair (Fig. 5). Specifically, P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. differ in 19 nucleotides of the concatenated sequences of the rpl-26, rpl-28 and rps-14 genes. In
contrast, P. maupasi and P. aerivorus differ in 31 nucleotides and P. maupasi and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. differ in
33 nucleotides of the corresponding sequences (Fig. 5). P.
americanus n. sp. and P. marianneae n. sp. show even more

nucleotide differences to the other species (Fig. 5). Thus,
the investigated genes allow us to clearly distinguish these
four species.

crosses between P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp.
and all of the F1 hybrid animals were phenotypically
female (Fig. 6A). Specifically, F1 hybrids were obtained
after reciprocal crosses of P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. from
Texas with four strains of P. aerivorus. In contrast, P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. from Nebraska produced F1 hybrids only
when males were used for mating with P. aerivorus
females. Another P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. strain from Lincoln, Nebraska (LNE) did not produce F1 hybrids with
any of the P. aerivorus strains. Thus, the occurrence of species hybrids is highly strain-specific and does not correlate

P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. follow
Haldane's rule
The unusually high DNA sequence similarity between P.
aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. suggests that they
result from a recent speciation event. Therefore, these two
species might still possess the potential to mate and form
hybrid offspring. To obtain support for this hypothesis,
we carried out cross-species mating experiments and
found a strong case of Haldane's rule (Fig. 6). Haldane's
rule states that in hybrids between diverging species the
sterile absent or underrepresented offspring is of the heterogametic sex [11]. We found F1 hybrids in 12 of 24

F1 hybrids of P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. follow Haldane's rule. (A) Results of crosses between four
strains of P. aerivorus (P. aer) from New York (NY), Ohio (OH), Texas (TX) and Nebraska (NE) and three strains of P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. (P. pseu) from Texas (TX), Indian Cave, Nebraska (NE) and Lincoln, Nebraska (LNE). Each strain was crossed with
all other strains in a reciprocal manner. Columns represent female animals and rows represent males used for crosses. Mating
was performed in triplicate, placing one virgin female and one male on a plate. Numbers show the total of eggs laid by one
female. In brackets, the number of eggs that developed into phenotypic female vs. male progeny is indicated. The difference
between the upper number and the sum of the numbers in brackets is accounted for by unfertilized eggs and embryonic
lethality commonly observed after crosses within and between animals of these two species. The given numbers represent the
result of the experiment with the highest number of offspring. (B) SSU sequence profile of P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus n. sp.

with the geographic origin of the strains used in the analysis.
The primary signal in P. pacificus and C. elegans sex determination is the ratio of the set of X chromosomes to autosomes [1]. Animals with two X chromosomes develop as
females (XX), whereas animals with a single X chromosome develop as males (XO). Theoretically, the absence of
males among the F1 hybrid animals could result from the
death of the putative XO animals or the sexual transformation of these animals into females. The latter scenario
was observed in crosses of Caenorhabditis remanei with
Caenorhabditis briggsae [16].
Additional support for the results of the laboratory crosses
came from genotyped Pristionchus nematodes from wild
scarab beetles. We found two cases of hybrids between P.
aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. emerging from individual beetles (Fig. 6B). Genotyping of other Pristionchus
individuals from the same two beetles revealed that they
carried both P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp., suggesting that the observed hybrids are the result of crossspecies fertilization (Fig. 6B). However, both hybrid animals were isolated more than a week after the beetle was
placed on the petri dish. Therefore, it remains unknown if
the observed hybrids came from the generation that lived
on the beetle or whether it originated from fertilization in
the laboratory. Taken together, P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. co-exist on the same beetles in nature, they
can form hybrids and laboratory-derived F1 hybrids follow Haldane's rule. In addition, both species have a similar geographic distribution in our sampling.
The Colorado potato beetle hosts the same Pristionchus
species in North America and Europe
Finally, we wanted to know if Pristionchus nematodes
occur in association with the CPB Leptinotarsa decemlineata
in the United States. Our analysis of CPB in Europe had
indicated that one species, P. uniformis, infests these beetles with high specificity [8]. The CPB is a pest species that
originated in Mexico, where it extended its range of host
plants from the wild solanaceae buffalo bur (Solanum rostratum) to include the potato (Solanum tuberosum). It
migrated further north to the United States and was first
described in Colorado in 1811. Spreading towards the
East it reached the Atlantic coast in 1874 and was first
reported in Europe in 1877 [17,18].

We collected CPB from two different locations in Ohio
and New York State and found Pristionchus nematodes
with an infestation rate of up to 60% (Table 1). Sequence
analysis and mating experiments revealed that all of these
isolates belong to P. uniformis, the same species that is
found on European CPB. Thus, in contrast to scarab beetles, the CPB hosts the same (and only one) Pristionchus

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/14

species on both continents, P. uniformis. Given the recent
invasion of the CPB to Europe we speculate that P. uniformis was introduced to Europe together with its beetle
vector, the CPB, at the end of the 19th century.

Discussion
We have shown that the Pristionchus species associated
with scarab beetles in the Eastern United States are different from those found in Western Europe. The four predominant American species P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus
n. sp., P. marianneae n. sp. and P. pauli n. sp. are all
unknown from Western Europe. In general, there is some
preference of certain Pristionchus nematodes for a specific
beetle. However, the nematode – beetle association is not
striktly species-specific, an observation that is similar to
what has been observed in our study in Europe [8]. This
very interesting and important issue awaits further analysis, including more comprehensive studies on additional
continents and exhaustive samplings of one particular
continent.
One surprising observation of our surveys in the United
States and Europe is the difference in the mode of reproduction observed between the two continents. While the
two predominant Pristionchus species on European scarab
beetles are hermaphroditic, the four predominant American species, representing 98% of the American isolates,
are gonochoristic. We speculate that the evolution of hermaphroditism is a chance event that occurs with a very
low probability. Despite this fact, the Pristionchus phylogeny presented in this study strongly suggests that the evolution of hermaphroditism has occurred multiple times
independently: The hermaphroditic species P. pacificus, P.
maupasi and P. entomophagus belong to three different
clades of the genus and all of them have gonochoristic sister species (Fig. 4). Two different explanations can
account for this pattern. First, speciation of hermaphroditic species might be absent or at least not very frequent.
Alternativley, more frequent extinctions of hermaphroditic lineages than gonochoristic ones can also explain the
observed patterns. The latter hypothesis is further supported by the fact that hermaphroditism is mostly
observed in terminal lineages. Similar results have been
obtained for rhabditid species of the genus Caenorhabditis
[19].
The satellite organism P. pacificus represents an independent clade in the Pristionchus phylogeny with only three isolates from scarab beetles from Ohio, Nebraska and
Massachusetts. P. pacificus does not seem to be a common
species on scarab beetles in the United States, a finding
that raises two possibilities. First, P. pacificus occurs in the
United States, but not in association with the beetles that
were investigated in this study. Second, P. pacificus repre-

sents a species that has invaded North America recently
and is not yet very common.
Several observations provide a first hint that the North
American Pristionchus species are the result of relatively
recent speciation events. The four most common beetleassociated species form a single clade in the phylogenetic
tree. The only European species in this clade is P. maupasi,
indicating that there is no complete biogeographic separation. Furthermore, this observation suggests that P. maupasi derives from a lineage that dispersed to Europe from
North America. P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. coexist on the same beetle and cross-species matings were
observed under laboratory conditions following Haldane's rule. All F1 hybrid animals were sterile females. We
speculate that the effect of recessive deleterious alleles in
the heterogametic hybrids causes inviability of males, a
phenomenon known as dominance theory [20]. Given
the easiness with which Pristionchus strains can be
obtained at various places in the United States, Pristionchus nematodes provide an interesting model system to
study if sympatric speciation occurs in nematodes and to
study speciation and hybridization processes in general.
Finally, our studies of the CPB in the United States and
Europe suggest a case of a species invasion. The introduction of the American CPB to Europe represents one of the
first cases in which the invasion of an agricultural pest species was well documented. Recent studies have revealed
that the genetic diversity of the CPB is much higher in
North America than in Europe [21]. This observation is
consistent with the assumption that the original invasion
was due to a small number or even a single founder event.
The fact that the CPB in the United States and Europe
hosts the same nematode, P. uniformis, strongly suggests
that P. uniformis was introduced into Europe with its beetle vector. With more P. uniformis isolates in hand from
both continents we can start to address the question
whether the genetic variability of European P. uniformis
populations is reduced when compared to that of American populations. More generally, such studies can provide
an important model for nematode species invasions
across continents. In this context it is important to note
that the case of Pristionchus is not unique for nematode
invasions by insect vectors. One recent case is of high
commercial interest. The pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is a major pathogen of conifers and has
recently been introduced to Europe by its vector, the beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis [22].
In summary, the observations of the Pristionchus species
pattern on scarab beetles and the CPB, as well as the easiness and frequency with which these nematodes can be
isolated, indicates the potential of this nematode group
for studying speciation, biodiversity, biogeography and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/14

species invasion on a global scale. When future samplings
provide a global pattern of Pristionchus species and associations, the combination of field studies with genetic
manipulation under laboratory conditions will allow
functional investigations into nematode biodiversity and
biogeography.

Conclusion
We describe the Pristionchus – beetle association in the
Eastern United States and show striking evolutionary and
ecological patterns. Most Pristionchus isolates from American scarab beetles belong to five species, all of which differ from the European species. The two most closely
related species, P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp., follow Haldane's rule. The Colorado potato beetle is associated with the same species, P. uniformis in the United
States and Europe, suggesting that P. uniformis was introduced to Europe together with its beetle vector. Together,
the Pristionchus – beetle association provides a powerful
tool for studying speciation, biodiversity, biogeography
and species invasion on a global scale.

Materials and methods
Isolation of nematodes
We collected different beetles at adult stage using sweeping nets, blacklight traps and pitfall traps baited with
dung. The beetles were transferred to the lab alive, sacrificed by cutting them in half transversely, and put on
NGM agar plates (6 cm diameter) seeded with 300 μl of
the slowly growing E. coli strain OP50. The plates were
checked daily using a Zeiss Stemi 2000 dissecting scope
over a period of one to three weeks for emerging and
reproducing nematodes. From the emerging nematodes
we produced isogenic lines by transferring single gravid
females or hermaphrodites to new plates. To see whether
the isolated nematodes belonged to gonochoristic or hermaphroditic species, virgin larvae were singled out onto
plates. The presence of offspring indicated that they represent a hermaphroditic species.

Emerging nematodes were determined to family level
with a Zeiss Stemi 2000 dissecting scope and to genus
level with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope using the key by
Sudhaus and Fürst von Lieven [9]. For determination several worms were transferred onto microscopic slides covered with a 0.5 mm thick layer of 5% agar and either
immobilized by heating the slide over an open flame to
about 60°C for a few seconds or anesthesized with
sodium azide. Within the genus Pristionchus many species
can not be identified by morphological methods. We
therefore chose to use molecular tools and mating experiments with reference strains to distinguish the different
species.

We have originally isolated up to three isogenic female
lines per beetle and have processed them for sequence
analysis. In nearly all cases, these isogenic female lines
had identical SSU sequences. The exceptions were the
observed hybrids between P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. described above, and two cases where isogenic
female lines of P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus or P. aerivorus and P. marianneae were derived from the same beetle. When the SSU sequences of different isogenic female
lines from the same beetle were identical, only one isolate
was further considered. Throughout the text (and in the
Tables and Figures), we consider only one of these identical isolates per beetle. In particular, the numbers and frequencies provided in Table 1 and Figure 3 consider only
one of these isolates. In Table 1, beetle individuals from
the different sampling sites are pooled. There was little
variation in incidence of Pristionchus species on beetles
among sampling sites.
Molecular species identification
Molecular species identification was done using the small
subunit rRNA gene (SSU) as described before [8]. In short,
genomic DNA from single nematodes was prepared using
the NaOH digestion procedure described by Floyd et al.
[23]. A single worm was transferred to 20 μl of 0.25 M
NaOH, incubated overnight at 25°C and heated to 99°C
for 3 min before 4 μl of 1M HC1, 10 μl of 0.5 M Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) and 5 μl of 2% Triton X-100 were added. The
mixture was heated to 99°C for 3 min, frozen at -20°C
and reheated at 99°C for further 3 min. Two microliters of
this extract were used for subsequent polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).

A 1 kb fragment of the SSU was amplified by PCR using
the primers SSU18A (5'-AAAGATTAAGCCATGCATG-3')
and SSU26R (5'- CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-3')
[23,24]. The reactions were performed in 25 μl of 1× PCR
buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) containing 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.16 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.5 μM of each primer, 2 μl of the
lysate, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham).
The reactions were started by initial denaturation at 95°C
for 2 min in a PTC-200 (MJ Research, Biozym, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany) or T gradient (Biometra, Göttingen,
Germany) thermocycler, followed by 35 to 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec, primer annealing at
50°C for 15 sec, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. A final
incubation step at 72°C for 7 min concluded the reaction.
PCR products were purified by the Qiagen PCR product
gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Approximately 500 bp of the 5'-terminal end were sequenced
using the primer SSU9R (5'-AGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTG-3') and the Big Dye terminator protocol (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/3/1/14

Sequences were aligned manually using the Seqpup 0.6f
software for Macintosh [25]. The substitution model for
the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships was
selected by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test as implemented in the Modeltest 3.7 software [26]. The selected
substitution model corresponds to the Kimura 2-parameter model [27] with Ts/Tv = 1.4727, equal base frequencies, and a γ-correction with shape parameter α = 0.2381.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees were determined using the heuristic
search algorithm under the maximum likehood (ML) criterion using PAUP*4.0bl0 program [28]. Trees were
rooted by the Koerneria sp. sequence as outgroup. Neighbour joining (NJ, [29]) and maximum parsimony (MP)
trees were drawn by the same program. Alignment gaps
were eliminated from the analysis. The topological stability of the trees was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replications
[30].
Mating experiments
To confirm the species identification by the molecular
sequence of a novel isolate we performed mating experiments with the reference strain of the respective species
(see below for definitions). Five virgin females were put
on a plate with a small spot of OP50 together with five
males of the reference strain of a certain species. On a second plate we picked the opposite sexes of the two strains
to test for reciprocity. If there was no offspring after one
week, the experiments were repeated two more times. If
fertile offspring occurred we considered the two strains to
belong to the same species.
Isolate and strain definitions
We use the following definitions to distinguish "isolates"
and "strains". An isolate is an isogenic female line, which
is derived from a beetle sample and subjected to molecular and experimental analysis. After species identification
we established one isolate per species and location as a
strain. The strains are permanently cultured in the lab,
have a strain number and are also kept as frozen stocks.
For each new species designated by molecular sequence
analysis and mating experiments, one strain was defined
as a reference strain (see below).
Assigning names to reference strains
According to the designation of reference strains, the 285
isolates obtained from American scarab beetle material
fell into seven Pristionchus species, two of which were
already cultured in our lab (P. pacificus, reference strain
PS312 and P. entomophagus ref. strain RS0144). The other
five could not be identified. We found the morphometric
data of the most common of the unidentified species to
coincide with the description of the only North American
Pristionchus species listed in the catalog provided by Sud-

haus and Fürst von Lieven [9], namely P. aerivorus. The
other four species are novel and are described based on
morphometric analysis, SSU sequence analysis and mating experiments (Fig. 2, Table 2 and species diagnoses). In
total, the following eight Pristionchus species were
obtained from scarab beetles (seven species) and the
Colorado potato beetle (one species) in North America:

of the transcripts and the combination of RH5620 and the
sense primers to obtain the 3' parts. The PCR was performed with the help of the HotStar Taq DNA polymerase
kit (Qiagen) including the Q solution in the reaction mix.
Conditions were initial activation of the enzyme at 95°C
for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 sec, primer annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and
primer extention at 72°C for 3 min. The reaction was
completed by an incubation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR fragments were gel purified using the Wizard SV gel purification kit (Promega) and sequenced directly using the PCR
primers.

Comparison of ribosomal proteins
In order to obtain nuclear protein coding genes to distinguish P. americanus n. sp. from its sister species P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus n. sp. and P. maupasi we isolated
total RNA from 50 to 100 μg of nematodes using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the help of the Omniscript reverse
transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the
primer
RH5620
(5'-GAAGATCTAGAGCGGCCGCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'). Based on EST data
from SL1-transspliced genes from European Pristionchus
species (unpublished data) we designed generic RT-PCR
primers for Pristionchus ribosomal protein genes
(WM8220, 5'-TCGACAACGACAGAAAGAAGA-3', rpl-26,
