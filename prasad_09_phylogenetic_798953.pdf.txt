Abstract
Background: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused on primary DNA
sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures are particularly useful in systematics
because they include characteristics that give “morphological” information, not found in the
primary sequence. In several mountainous regions of Northeastern India, foci of Paragonimus (lung
fluke) infection reportedly involve species that are known to prevail in neighbouring countries. The
present study was undertaken to demonstrate the sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA (ITS2)
of the infective (metacercarial) stage of the lung fluke collected from the edible crab hosts that are
abundant in a mountain stream of the area (Miao, Changlang District in Arunachal Pradesh) and to
construct its phylogeny. Using the approach of molecular morphometrics that is based on ITS2
secondary structure homologies, phylogenetic relationships of the various isolates of Paragonimus
species that are prevalent in the neighbouring Near-eastern countries have been discussed.
Results: Initially, ten predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed and the topology
based only on the predicted RNA secondary structure of the ITS2 region resolved most
relationships among the species studied. We obtained three similar topologies for seven species of
the genus Paragonimus on the basis of traditional primary sequence analysis using MEGA and a
Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach allowed us to include both primary
sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics; each data partition was allowed to have a different

evolution rate. Paragonimus westermani was found to group with P. siamensis of Thailand; this was
best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined analyses. P. heterotremus,
P. proliferus, P. skrjabini, P. bangkokensis and P. harinasutai formed a separate clade in the molecular
phylogenies, and were reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other species. ITS2 sequence
motifs allowed an accurate in-silico distinction of lung flukes.
Conclusion: Data indicate that ITS2 motifs (≤ 50 bp in size) can be considered a promising tool
for trematode species identification. RNA secondary structure analysis could be a valuable tool for
distinguishing new species and completing Paragonimus systematics, more so because ITS2
secondary structure contains more information than the usual primary sequence alignment.

Introduction

The lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus have been known
as one of the most important zoonotic parasites causing
paragonimiasis, also known as endemic haemoptysis, in
man. It is estimated that over 20 million people are infected
worldwide due to several species of Paragonimus [1]. Over 40
species are known to infect the lung of different mammalian
hosts (representing as many as eleven families) throughout
the world [2] and approximately 15 species are known to
infect humans. The parasite can migrate to several other vital
tissues including brain [3]. The best known species is P.
westermani [4] Braun, 1899 - a human parasite that can
undergo development in as many as 16 different snail
species and 50 crustacean species. Beside P. westermani,
several other species namely, P. pulmonalis (Baelz, 1880)
Miyazaki, 1978; P. ohirai Miyazaki, 1939; P. iloktsunensis
Chen, 1940; P. skrjabini Chen, 1959; P. miyazaki Kamo et al.,
1961 and P. heterotremus Chen and Hsia, 1964 - all reported
to be occurring in Asia; P. africanus and P. uterobilateralis
Voelker and Vogel, 1965 in Africa; and P. mexicanus
Miyazaki and Ishii, 1968 in America are considered
pathogenic to man. While P. westermani is distributed
mostly in Asia, P. heterotremus is the predominant causative
agent of paragonimiasis in Thailand [5].
In the context of India, the states of West Bengal, Assam and
some other parts of the country are endemic foci of human
paragonimiasis. This infection has been reported in a
sizeable human population of Manipur, a north-eastern
state of India [6,7]. Very recently in Manipur and Arunachal
Pradesh (Northeast India), the suspected foci of human
infection where consumption of crustacean intermediate
hosts is of regular practice, the Chinese species,
P. hueitungensis and P. heterotremus, respectively were
identified as etiological agents of paragonimiasis [8,9].
However, no or scanty information is available about the
prevalence of the parasite among its molluscan and
crustacean intermediate hosts as even in the suspected foci
of human infection.
Morphology of the encysted and excysted metacercariae,
which occur as the infective stage in the muscle tissue of

the crustacean second intermediate host, has been
conventionally used in identification of species of
Paragonimus. The taxonomy of Paragonimus spp has
been based mainly on morphological data complemented with ecological, cytological and pathological results
as well as clinical manifestations. Morphological differences found on stained and mounted adult specimens
have been widely used to discriminate between platyhelminth species. Thus, identification of closely related
metazoan parasite species based on morphological
characters alone can be difficult. In recent times, the
amplification of specific DNA regions via the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and improved sequencing techniques have been employed to resolve taxonomic issues
related to various helminth parasites by comparing their
DNA. PCR-based techniques utilizing the rDNA ITS2
sequences, which occur between the 5.8S and 28S coding
regions, have proven to be a reliable tool to identify the
helminth species and their phylogenetic relationships
[10-12]. Studies on phylogeny and/or intraspecific
variation in Paragonimus species have also been done
using ITS2 region [13,14].
Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have
focused on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures are particularly useful in
systematics because they include characteristics, not
found in the primary sequence, that give ‘morphological’
information. The molecular morphometrics approach
has been employed in the present study for comparisons
between primary and secondary structure information. It
is an established fact that rRNA structure is highly
conserved throughout evolution as most of the folding is
functionally important despite primary sequence divergence [15]. The novel approach of molecular morphometrics that relies both on traditional morphological
comparison and on molecular sequence comparison by
measuring the structural parameters of the ITS2 secondary structure homologies (geometrical features, bond
energies, base composition etc.) is recently being used to
study the phylogenetic relationships of various species
[16]. It is well known that rRNA is highly conserved

throughout evolution. Thus, the secondary-structure
elements of the RNA molecule, i.e., the helices, loops,
bulges, and separating single-stranded portions, can be
considered phylogenetic characters [17-19].
The present study was undertaken to demonstrate the
sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA (ITS2) of the
infective metacercarial stages of the lung fluke, which
abound in the muscle tissue of the edible crab hosts
abundant in mountain streams of a suspected focus of
infection and to construct its phylogeny using rRNA
secondary structures supplementing the primary
sequence analysis.

Methods
Parasite material and DNA isolation, amplification
and sequencing
Naturally infected freshwater edible crabs (Barytelphusa
lugubris) were collected from a mountain stream of Miao,
Changlang District in Arunachal Pradesh (Altitude - 213
mASL, Longitude - 96°-15’N and Latitude - 27°-30’E).
Metacercariae were isolated from the muscles of the
crustacean host by digestion technique in artificial gastric
juice. The sediments were examined for Paragonimus
metacercariae under a dissecting stereoscopic microscope.

For the purpose of DNA extraction, metacercariae
collected from the same part of stream were pooled. The
70% alcohol-fixed metacercariae were further processed
for DNA extraction and PCR amplification following the
earlier standardised procedure and protocol. The rDNA
region spanning the ITS2 was amplified from metacercarial DNA by PCR; using trematode universal primers
designed based on Schistosoma species [20].
3S (forward): 5’GGTACCGGTGGATCACTCGGCTCGTG-3’
A28 (reverse): 5’-GGGATCCTGGTTAGTTTCTTTTCCTCCGC-3’
The PCR amplification was performed following the
standard protocol with minor modifications as described
earlier [21].
Molecular phylogenetic analysis using
bioinfomatic tools
The DNA sequences were put to further analysis with the
usage of bioinfomatics tools including similarity search
using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool); http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast, and phylogenetic prediction using ClustalW provided at the http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/clustalw for query DNA sequence. A total of 10 ITS2
sequences were selected (4 Indian isolates and 6 Isolates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S25

of Neighbouring countries) depending upon their BLAST
hits and E-value. Only unique sequences were used in
tree construction; ITS sequences arranged with MEGA
format were entered in the MEGA [22] for construction
of phylogenetic trees that were inferred using distance
method like Neighbor Joining and character state
method Maximum Parsimony. Test of phylogenetic
accuracy was done by bootstrapping.
Predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structures and analyses
Secondary structures of ITS2 sequences of various
paragonimid species were reconstructed by aligning
their sequences using Bioedit [23]. The acquired structures with restrictions and constrains were submitted in
MFOLD [24]. RNA was folded at a fixed temperature of
37°C and the structure chosen from different output files
was the desired 6-helicoidal ring or the one with the
highest negative free energy if various similar structures
were obtained.
Motif identification, testing and validation
The ITS sequence motifs were identified from aligned
sequences of the data set for the species using PRATT
software http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pratt/index.html.
The minimum percentage of sequences to match (C%)
parameter was adjusted to report pattern matching at
100% of the sequence input. The motifs were expressed
using the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G) in PROSITE
language [25]. The validation of the motifs was
performed for each species using a “PATTERN MATCHING” Web application http://genoweb.univ-rennes1.fr/
Serveur-GPO/. A motif was considered highly specific to
a Paragonimus species if it matched most or all the ITS
sequences of this species but no other ITS of any other
trematode species.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
DNA sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0.7. The
interleaved NEXUS file was edited manually in order for
it to be recognized by Mr. Bayes V3.1.2 programme.
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the Bayesian
approach with combined datasets (wherein each data
partition is allowed to have a different evolution rate)
using default parameters. The cladogram with the
posterior probabilities for each split and a phylogram
with mean branch lengths were generated and subsequently read by the tree drawing program Tree view
V1.6.6.

Results
Construction of phylogenetic trees
Phylogenetic trees were obtained by comparing the ITS2
sequences of Paragonimus species from different geographical isolates. Phylogenetic analyses using the NJ and

MP methods showed that the topology is similar among
the trees obtained (Fig. 1A & 1B). The Evolutionary
Divergence between sequences was also estimated and
the number of base substitutions per site from analysis
between sequences is shown. All results are based on the
pairwise analysis of 10 sequences. All analyses were
conducted in MEGA4.

In-silico identification of Paragonimus
species based on pattern matching ITS motifs
A total of 10 ITS2 motifs were tested by BLAST
analysis against the generalized GenBank database at
NCBI (Table 1). All the motifs exhibited exact or
perfect matches with that of the genus Paragonimus
from different geographical isolates with 100%

separate clade in the molecular phylogeny and were
reciprocally monophyletic with respect to other species.

Secondary structure analysis
Initially, ten predicted RNA secondary structures were
reconstructed to provide the basic information for
phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with the 6 helicoidal ring model (Figs. 3A-D & 4A-F). The secondary
structural features of ITS2 regions as shown in the figures
were analysed based on conserved stems and loops,
which in order of preference were interior loop, bulge
loop, multiple branch loop, hairpin loop and exterior
loop in all the isolates. We obtained three similar
topologies for seven species of the genus Paragonimus on
the basis of traditional primary sequence analyses using
MEGA and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data
(Fig. 5). The latter approach allowed us to include both
primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics;
each data partition was allowed to have a different
evolution rate. Paragonimus westermani was found to
group with P. siamensis of Thailand; this was best
supported by both the molecular morphometrics and
combined analysis. P. heterotremus, P. proliferus,
P. skrjabini, P. bangkokensis and P. harinasutai formed a

The ITS2 RNA secondary structures yielded homologous
models that grouped conserved species features in the
Paragonimus genus (e.g. long helix IV), though it is
important to note that these molecular structures can
also produce homoplasies because of selective pressures
acting on particular helix features such as the 6helicoidal ring core, conserved among most eukaryotes.
This approach resulted in a supported Bayesian inference
phylogram very similar to the molecular morphometrics
approach. The major difference between the topologies
obtained by the Bayesian (e.g. molecular morphometrics
using partitions) and primary sequence methodologies
was the placement of P. siamensis of Thailand, which
could be due to the lack of phylogenetic signal and the
likely saturation of ITS2 sequences after multiple
alignments. However, P. westermani, grouping with
P. siamensis of Thailand, showed an overall similarity
in the ITS2 rRNA folding and identical secondary
structures, which in the remaining five isolates showed
some variation. Generally RNA secondary structure
prediction programs rely on free energy minimization

using nearest-neighbor parameters for predicting the
overall structural stability in terms of Gibbs free energy
at 37°C. The observed similarities at the secondary
structural level are further reflected at the energy level
(-ΔG). The difference in their topology, however, is due to
differences in nucleotide sequence lengths. Moreover, the
observed phylogenetic trend was identified with respect
to the target accessibility sites for the seven different
isolates. Bayesian analysis of the alignment retained the
same topology and supported the same branches of the
trees derived from the primary sequence data.

Discussion
In sequence analysis of the rDNA ITS2, comparing with
the known sequences of the other lung fluke species, the
present study revealed that the sequence of ITS2 (plus
flanking regions) show close resemblance with that of

Paragonimus westermani. In phylogenetic analysis, as a
general rule, if the bootstrap value for a given interior
branch of a phylogenetic tree is 70% or higher, then the
topology at that branch is considered reliable. Our
results showed a bootstrap value to be >70% among the
trees obtained and the ITS2 sequence resembled Paragonimus westermani, another Indian isolate [GenBank:
DQ336246]. The comparison of ITS sequences from the
parasites of different hosts and of different countries
indicates that there exists a high species-specific homogeneity. In the present study, primary sequence analysis
revealed a close relationship between the query sequence
and other isolates from NER of India and those from
neighbouring countries. Thus, on the basis of absolute
matching of ITS2 sequence that could be used as one of
the species markers, it can be concluded that Paragonimus
species prevailing in Miao region of Arunachal Pradesh is

In phylogenetic studies involving secondary structure
analysis as a tool, RNA folding is used for refining the
alignment. Although the correct alignment with high
precision cannot be determined, in extensively folded
structure, yet this procedure improves multiple alignment and hence phylogeny construction. The measurable structural parameters of the molecules are directly

used as specific characters to construct a phylogenetic
tree. These structures are inferred from the sequence of
the nucleotides, often using energy minimization [26].
Molecular morphometrics appears to be complimentary
to classical primary sequence analysis in phylogenetic
studies as it takes into consideration only the size
variations of homologous structural segments and this
choice implies that the overall architecture of the
molecule remains same among the observed taxa. This
method helps in taking into account the regions where

multiple alignments are barely reliable because of large
number of insertion/deletion operation. Besides, the
secondary structures are built on each sequence separately thereby making it unnecessary for a sharp
computational sequence analysis. Thus homologous

each nucleotide in every other sequence.

metacercaria of distinctive appearance from southern
Yunnan and a number of questions remained unresolved
[28]. Nevertheless, because there were inconsistencies in
the placement of a few Paragonimus species, this study
needs to be extended, in order to gain a better understanding of the systematics of this group as well as the
evolution of their predicted ITS2 RNA secondary structures.

Several patterns of predicted secondary structures of RNA
that were constructed from unique ITS sequences from
different geographical isolates of Paragonimus, provided us
with the additional information for correct identification
of the species prevalent in the region. The secondary
structure analysis of the same data also confirmed the
results mentioned for primary sequence analysis. Differences in their topology are only due to the fact that there
are variable lengths of the sequences. However, there are
difficulties in de fining a distance between two related
structures with variable topologies [27]. Following earlier
studies P. skrjabini, P. miyazaki, P. szechuanensis,
P. hueitungensis and P. veocularis are considered synonyms;
the name of P. hokuoensis was proposed for two individual

Conclusion
The molecular study of the genus Paragonimus, which is the
most common lung fluke throughout the globe, has gained
impetus in the recent times. ITS2 motifs (≤ 50 bp in size)
can be considered a promising tool for trematode species
identification. RNA secondary structure analysis could be a
valuable tool for distinguishing new species and completing Paragonimus systematic, more so because ITS2 secondary structure contains more information than the usual
primary sequence alignment.
