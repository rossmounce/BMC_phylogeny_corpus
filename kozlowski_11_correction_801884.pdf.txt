Abstract
After the publication of the work entitled “Dermatan sulfate in tunicate phylogeny: Order-specific sulfation pattern
and the effect of [®4IdoA(2-Sulfate)b-1®3GalNAc(4-Sulfate)b-1®] motifs in dermatan sulfate on heparin cofactor II
activity”, by Kozlowski et al., BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:29, we found that the legends to Figures 2 to 5 contain
serious mistakes that compromise the comprehension of the work. This correction article contains the correct text
of the legends to Figures 2 to 5.
Correction
After the publication of the work entitled “Dermatan
sulfate in tunicate phylogeny: Order-specific sulfation
pattern and the effect of [®4IdoA(2-Sulfate)b-1®3GalNAc(4-Sulfate)b-1®] motifs in dermatan sulfate on
heparin cofactor II activity”, by Kozlowski et al., BMC
Biochemistry 2011, 12:29 [1], we found that the legends
to Figures 2 to 5 contain serious mistakes that compromise the comprehension of the work. We would like to
correct the legends to these figures as follows:
Figure two: Purification of the dermatan sulfate
(DS) from H. pallida (A and C) and C. intestinalis (B
and D) on a Mono QFPLC column. A and B, the total
polysaccharides extracted from ascidians were applied to
a Mono Q-FPLC column and purified as described
under “Materials and methods”. Fractions were assayed
by metachromasia (open circle), and NaCl concentration
(- -). The fractions under the peaks indicated by

horizontal bracket were pooled, denominated P1.2 and
P1.6 (A) or P0.9, P1.2 and P1.6 (B), dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. C and D, ~15 mg of each
peak from Mono Q-FPLC column were applied to a
0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 100 V in 0.05 M
1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0). The polysaccharides in the gel were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel
was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic
acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v).
Figure three: Agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ascidians and mammalian dermatan
sulfate. A, purified dermatan sulfate (~15 mg) from S.
plicata, H. pallida, H. rotetzi, P. nigra and C. intestinalis
were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at
100 V in 0.05 M 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0).
Glycosaminoglycans were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,
Ntrimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the
gel was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in
acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). To a standard, a
mixture of mammalian glycosaminoglycans containing
10 mg each of chondroitin 4-sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparin (Hep) were applied in agarose gel.

H. pallida, H. rotetzi, P. nigra and C. intestinalis were
applied to 6% 1-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel slab in
0.02 M sodium barbital (pH 8.6) and run for 30 min at
100 V. After electrophoresis the gel was stained with
0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid and then washed
for about 4 h in 1% acetic acid. The molecular mass (M.
W.) markers were high molecular mass dextran sulfate
(S1, ~500 kDa), chondroitin 6-sulfate (S2, ~54 kDa),
chondroitin 4-sulfate (S3, ~36 kDa) and low molecular
mass dextran sulfate (S4, ~8 kDa). Stolidobranchia and
Phlebobranchia are the taxonomic Orders of the
ascidians.
Figure four: Strong anion-exchange HPLC analysis
of the disaccharides formed by chondroitin ABC
lyase digestion of ascidians dermatan sulfate. The disaccharides formed by exhaustive action of chondroitin
ABC lyase on dermatan sulfate from H. pallida, H. roretzi and C. intestinalis were applied to a 25-cm × 4.6mm Spherisorb-SAX column, linked to an HPLC system. The column was eluted with a gradient of NaCl as
described under “Materials and methods”. The eluant
was monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm. The disaccharides of the ascidians DS were identified by comparing the elution positions with those of standard
disaccharides: deltaDi-0S, deltaHexUA-GalNAc; deltaDi6S, deltaHexUA-GalNAc(6S); deltaDi-4S, deltaHexUAGalNAc(4S); deltaDi-2,6S, deltaHexUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S);
deltaDi-2,4S, deltaHexUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S).
Figure five: Direct measurement of the inhibition of
thrombin by heparin cofactor II in the presence of
the different ascidian DSs. A, inhibition of thrombin
activity by HCII in the presence of DSs from H. pallida
(- closed circle/black diamonds -), H. roretzi (- grey circle -), and C. intestinalis (- open square -). HCII (68
nM) was incubated with thrombin (15 nM) in the presence of various concentrations of glycans. After 60 seconds, the remaining thrombin or factor Xa activity was
determined with a chromogenic substrate (deltaA405/
min). B, Table showing the values of the percentage of
deltaDi2,4S, the IC50 (mg/ml) for HCII-mediated thrombin inhibition and the aPTT of the ascidians DSs. C.
Relationship between IC 50 (mg/ml) values for HCIImediated thrombin inhibition in the presence of DSs
containing different percentages of deltaDi2,4S units
obtained from the ascidians H. pallida (- closed circle
-), H. roretzi (- grey circle -), H. pyriformis (- open circle
-), S. plicata (- grey squate -), Porcine intestinal mucosa
(PIM) (- close triangle -), C. intestinalis (- closed square
-) and P. nigra (- open square -).
We apologise for any inconvenience that this inaccuracy in the figure legends in the article [1] might have
caused.
