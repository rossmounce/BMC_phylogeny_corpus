Abstract
Background: Regulation of worker behavior by dominant queens or workers is a hallmark of insect societies, but the
underlying molecular mechanisms and their evolutionary conservation are not well understood. Honey bee and
bumble bee colonies consist of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. The queens' influences on
the workers are mediated largely via inhibition of juvenile hormone titers, which affect division of labor in honey bees
and worker reproduction in bumble bees. Studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Krh1), whose expression in worker brains is significantly downregulated in the presence of a queen or queen pheromone
and higher in forager bees, making this gene an ideal candidate for examining the evolutionary conservation of socially
regulated pathways in Hymenoptera.
Results: In contrast to honey bees, bumble bees foragers do not have higher Kr-h1 levels relative to nurses: in one of
three colonies levels were similar in nurses and foragers, and in two colonies levels were higher in nurses. Similarly to
honey bees, brain Kr-h1 levels were significantly downregulated in the presence versus absence of a queen.
Furthermore, in small queenless groups, Kr-h1 levels were downregulated in subordinate workers with undeveloped
ovaries relative to dominant individuals with active ovaries. Brain Kr-h1 levels were upregulated by juvenile hormone
treatment relative to a vehicle control. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that KR-H1 orthologs are presence across
insect orders. Though this protein is highly conserved between honey bees and bumble bees, there are significant
differences between orthologs of insects from different orders.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that Kr-h1 is associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of reproduction
in bumble bees. The expression of this transcription factor is inhibited by the queen and associated with endocrine
mediated regulation of social organization in two species of bees. Thus, KR-H1 may transcriptionally regulate a
conserved genetic module that is part of a pathway that has been co-opted to function in social behavior, and adjusts
the behavior of workers to their social environmental context.
Background
With recent advances in genomics, it is becoming
increasingly feasible to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying complex behavioral traits in ecologically relevant contexts. One of the key challenges is to
determine the level of conservation of genes and genetic
pathways involved in producing or regulating similar
adaptive behaviors in evolutionarily distinct lineages
(reviewed in [1]). Social insects provide an excellent

model system for these studies, because sociality has
evolved independently multiple times [2]. One of the hallmarks of insect societies is a reproductive division of
labor, in which reproduction is strongly biased toward
one or a handful of individuals in the colony (queens)
whereas most other colony members (workers) are
engaged in very little reproduction or remain sterile. A
second important element is a division of labor among
the sterile workers, in which workers specialize in various
activities such as brood care or foraging (reviewed in
[2,3]). In most insect societies, the interactions between
the queen(s) and workers are critical for regulating these
divisions of labor. In simple societies, direct contact with
the queen and behavioral aggression is often important
for inhibiting worker reproduction, while in larger and

more evolutionarily derived societies, chemical communication via pheromones is the principle means for advertising the queen's presence [2-5].
Socially regulated behavioral pathways, hereafter
referred to as "social pathways", presumably link social
signals from the queen and other workers with alterations
in worker physiology, which in turn lead to changes in
behavioral state (e.g. worker task) that are integrated into
an emerging colony level function. These social pathways
need to include sensory and integrative systems that
ensure that the individual is tuned to the relevant social
signals, as well as neuroendocrine signaling systems that
integrate the molecular and physiological processes
needed for producing the appropriate social behavior.
One of the important challenges in sociobiology is to
characterize these pathways and compare their structure
and function in species showing different levels of social
organization. Previous studies in behavioral genomics
have focused on genes that detect a particular signal, such
as a pheromone, or genes that are involved in the expression of a particular behavior, such as foraging (reviewed
in [1]). While there is ample evidence that the social environment can have significant effects on behavior, physiology, and brain gene expression in a variety of species,
genes involved in the intervening "social pathways" have
been characterized in only a few species (reviewed in [6]).
For example, the serotonergic system is modulated in
crustaceans according to dominance rank, while somatostatin and gonadotropin releasing hormone levels are
associated with dominance rank in male cichlid fish [710]. In social insects, allelic differences at the Gp-9 locus
in fire ants are associated with differences in colony
structure, but the number of linked genes in this locus
and their molecular functions are not known [11].
Honey bees and bumble bees are excellent species for
comparative studies of this kind, since there are both
common elements and important differences in their
social organization [2,3]. Honey bees are highly eusocial
insects living in perennial colonies containing several
tens of thousands of worker bees. The queen signals her
presence by means of a complex set of pheromones that
regulate the function and reproduction of the colony [12].
The division of labor among workers is related to age, and
is regulated in part by queen pheromones [13]. Bumble
bees such as Bombus terrestris are considered "primitively eusocial" because there are no overt morphological
differences between the queen and the workers, and the
division of labor is less structured [3]. Colonies are
founded by a single queen in the spring, and reach a maximal size of only a few hundred workers. Direct contact
with the queen is required to inhibit worker reproduction, though this typically does not seem to require
aggressive interactions [14,15]. There is evidence which
supports the hypothesis that pheromonal queen signals

Page 2 of 13

are involved in the regulation of worker reproduction, but
the relative importance of chemical and behavioral signals has not been resolved [16-18]. Worker division of
labor between brood care and foraging is based largely on
body size rather than on age [2,3].
Neuroendocrine analyses suggest that there are similarities between the social regulation of reproduction in
bumble bees and division of labor in honey bees, specifically concerning the role of juvenile hormone [19]. In
honey bees, exposure to queen pheromone decreases circulating levels of juvenile hormone (JH), and slows the
transition from nursing to foraging [13,20]. Forager bees
have higher circulating levels of JH, and treatment with
JH or JH analogues accelerates the transition to foraging,
while JH depletion delays the onset of foraging [21,22]. In
bumble bees, queen presence or body extracts also
reduces JH levels. High JH levels are associated with
worker ovary activation and reproduction, and high dominance rank in queenless workers [17,23-25]. JH treatment of workers causes a dose-dependent increase in
oocyte length, even in the presence of an inhibitory
queen, but does not affect worker task (division of labor)
[25-28]. Thus, in bumble bees as in most insects, JH levels are associated with ovary activation and reproduction,
while in honey bees and some ant species, juvenile hormone levels are not higher in reproductive queens or
workers (for a recent review see [29]). Thus, this hormonal factor is associated with different behavioral outcomes, but in both cases JH levels are regulated by queen
presence. Given that stimuli produced by the queen lead
to similar changes in worker physiology but different
types of behavioral outcomes, it is possible that the first
portions of the "social pathway" are conserved in honey
bees and bumble bees, but diverge in terms of the downstream pathways regulating behavior.
Previous studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), whose expression
in the brains of workers is consistently downregulated by
exposure to the queen or queen pheromone [30-32]. As
expected, since queen pheromone slows the transition
from nursing to foraging, expression of Kr-h1 is also high
in foragers compared to nurse bees [31]. Thus, Kr-h1
expression levels may be associated with detection of
queen presence, the transition from nursing to foraging,
or some aspect of the foraging behavioral state, such as
high levels of JH. Furthermore, as a transcription factor,
Kr-h1 regulates expression of other genes, and thus may
be a key component of signaling pathways linking social
environment with behavioral and physiological state.
Here, we tested whether the association of Kr-h1 with a
social pathway linking the processing of queen signals
with JH regulated behavior is common to social bee species other than the honey bee. Using bumble bees enabled
us to uncouple the molecular pathways associated with

social inhibition (similar in the honey bee and the bumble
bee) from those regulating behavior (distinct in the two
species). For example, if Kr-h1 is linked to foraging, then
expression should be higher in foragers than nurses in
bumble bees as it is in honey bees. If Kr-h1 is associated
with queen presence/social inhibition, then expression
levels in Bombus should be similar in nurses and foragers,
lower in queenright vs queenless workers, and lower in
subordinate relative to dominant workers. Furthermore,
since JH is linked with foraging behavior in honey bees
but with reproductive behavior and dominance rank in
bumble bees, these studies will allow us to determine if
Kr-h1 expression is correlated with JH levels in both species, regardless of the behavioral state. Finally, we ascertained whether KR-H1 was present and conserved across
insect orders. Sequence differences in transcription factors may alter the timing, location, or types of genes regulated by these proteins, and may be an important factor
contributing to behavioral or phenotypic evolutionary
change [33].

Results
The influence of queen presence on brain Kr-h1 levels in
workers

We performed two experiments to test the influence of
the queen on brain Kr-h1 expression levels in workers.
For the first experiment, we performed three replicates
comparing queenright workers in colonies and queenless
workers that developed in cages in groups of three. Brain
Kr-h1 levels were significantly lower in queenright workers in the second and third trial (t(24) = -2.64, P = 0.014
and t(24) = -3.68, P = 0.001 respectively; Fig. 1A); a similar, but statistically not significant trend was obtained in
the first trial (t(22) = -1.92; P = 0.068). There was a significant difference between queenright and queenless workers in a pooled analysis that included bees from all three
trials (mixed model ANOVA, F = 21.05, df = 1, 72; P <
0.0001).
In the second experiment, queenless workers were
obtained from orphan colonies, with similar results as
above. The workers from the two queenless colonies had
approximately twice the amount of brain Kr-h1 RNA
compared to the workers from queenright colonies (Fig.
1B; one way ANOVA, P < 0.001; LSD post hoc test, P <
0.001). The queenless and queenright workers were of
similar age (4-day-old) and size (queenless colony A,
mean ± SE marginal cell size = 2.88 ± 0.12; queenless colony B, 2.94 ± 0.06; queenright colony C, 2.77 ± 0.13;
queenright colony D, 2.90 ± 0.03; one-way ANOVA, F =
0.55, P = 0.65). These experiments indicate that the brain
expression of Kr-h1 is reduced in the presence of a vital
egg-laying queen.

queenless and queenright workers that developed in colonies with
similar worker and brood populations, but differing in the presence or
absence of an egg-laying queen. Sample size was 6 bees/colony.
Groups with different letters are significantly different in a one-way
ANOVA followed by a LSD post hoc test (P < 0.001 for both tests).

The influence of worker task on brain Kr-h1 levels

We repeated this experiment with three different colonies. In colony A, Kr-h1 transcript levels were similar in
the brains of foragers and nurses (Fig. 2A, t(20) = 0.15, P
= 0.88). In colonies B and C nurse bees had significantly
higher brain Kr-h1 levels (Fig. 2B, C; t(18) = 3.14, P =
0.006; t(9) = 3.85, P = 0.004, respectively). A two-way
ANOVA with data from the three colonies pooled
together produced a significant effect for task, [F = 12.1, P
= 0.01], and task × colony [F = 4.08, P = 0.023]). Nurses
and foragers did not differ in age (colony A, foragers,
mean age = 15.2 days, range = 13-18 days of age; nurses,
mean = 14, range 13-15; t-test t(20) = 1.75 P = 0.094; colony B, foragers, mean = 17.1, range = 9-28; nurses, mean
= 24, range 14-35; t-test, t(18) = 1.896, P = 0.075; Colony

sample is shown in the base of each bar. P-values above plots were obtained from unpaired t-test analyses.

Kr-h1 RNA levels for bees collected at seven days of age
were correlated with the dominance rank. An ANOVA
revealed significantly higher brain Kr-h1 levels for the
most dominant individual (α), compared with the β and γ
subordinate groupmates (Fig. 3A, one way ANOVA, F =
6.72, df = 2, P = 0.004, LSD post hoc test, P < 0.05). In 9 of
12 groups, the most dominant individual also had the
highest Kr-h1 brain RNA levels, which is significantly different from the expected 0.33 probability (4 groups) of
independence for the two traits (Fig. 3B, χ2 = 15 df = 4, P
= 0.005). The bee with the highest Kr-h1 levels always had
developed ovaries, even in groups in which she did not
hold the highest dominance rank. This experiment suggests that brain Kr-h1 levels are relatively low in bees for
which ovarian development is inhibited by the presence
of a dominant groupmate.

C, foragers, mean = 5, range 3-7; nurses, mean 4.5 range
3-8; Mann-Whitney U test, two-tail, P = 0.5). There were
no significant differences in body size but there was a
trend toward larger size for foragers in colony C (Colony
A, wing length [mean ± SE], foragers = 11.84 ± 0.37 mm,
nurses = 11.43 ± 0.48 t-test t(20) = 0.66, P = 0.52; Colony
C, marginal cell length, foragers = 2.92 ± 0.09 mm, nurses
= 2.71 ± 0.07; Mann Whitney U test, two-tail, P = 0.1).
The ovaries were in basal state for all bees in the two
groups except for one nurse in colony A with a largest
oocyte = 2.5 mm. The basal state of the ovaries was probably because these bees were queenright [24,28,34].
These results indicate that by contrast to honey bees, foraging behavior is not associated with elevated brain Kr-h1
RNA levels. Indeed, in 2 out of 3 colonies, nurses have
higher levels of brain Kr-h1 RNA than foragers.
The influence of dominance rank on Kr-h1 levels in groups
of queenless workers

Groups of three queenless workers were reared in cages
and allowed to establish dominance hierarchies. We
observed frequent agonistic interactions on days 3 and 7,
enabling a clear sorting of the dominance order for 12 out
of 13 queenless groups. Only these 12 groups were used
for the analyses summarized below. The α bee was the
most aggressive, had an average dominance index of 0.93,
and could be clearly distinguished from the two subordinate bees in all 12 groups. The β and γ bees, with an average dominance index of 0.37, and 0.06, respectively, were
in some groups harder to differentiate either because they
performed only a few social interactions, or both subordinate bees retreated in almost all their encounters. Brain

The influence of juvenile hormone on ovarian development
and brain Kr-h1 levels in queenright workers

Two trials were completed for this experiment. Measurements for the length of the front wing marginal cell indicate that there were no differences in body size between
the three experimental groups (Kruskal Wallis Test; first
trial: χ2 = 0.38, df = 2, P = 0.82; second trial: χ2 = 4.512, df
= 2, P = 0.1, Table 1). Ovaries at seven days of age were at
a significantly more advance stage of development for the
JH treated bees in the second trial (Table 1; Kruskal Wallis Test, χ2 = 13.45, df = 2; P = 0.0012), and a similar trend
was also seen in the first trial in which sample size was
smaller, although the results were not statistically significant (χ2 = 3.99, df = 2, P = 0.14). This analysis of ovarian
state is consistent with previous JH-treatment studies
[25,26].
JH treated bees in the first trial had significantly higher
brain Kr-h1 RNA levels compared to bees from the DMF
group, but not from the control group (Table 2, one way
ANOVA, F = 4.64, df = 2, P = 0.018, LSD post hoc test, P
< 0.05). In the second trial, Kr-h1 levels were significantly
higher in the JH treatment group compared to the two
other groups (Table 2; one way ANOVA, F = 9.01, df = 2,
P = 0.001; LSD post hoc test, P < 0.05). The effect of treatment (P = 0.003) and colony × treatment (P = 0.032), but
not of the colony (P = 0.14) was significant in a two-way
ANOVA with bees from the two trials pooled together.
Complementary LSD post hoc tests revealed a highly significant difference between the JH and DMF treatments
(P = 0.0004), and a very strong trend for JH vs. control (P
= 0.057). The consistent influence of JH treatment relative to the vehicle (DMF) control suggests that Kr-h1
expression is up-regulated by JH in Bombus terrestris.
Analysis of KR-H1 orthologs across insect orders

KR-H1 orthologs were identified in the 20 insect species
with available genomic information. Alignments of the
full protein sequences of the orthologs revealed that the

zinc-finger DNA binding domains were conserved as
were two regions in the C-terminal domain, but otherwise there was a great degree of sequence divergence (see
Additional files 1, 2 Fig. S1 for alignments of orthologs).
KR-H1 orthologs are characterized by eight classic C2H2
zinc fingers described as CX2CX12HX3H. These types of
proteins have a complex binding capacity: similar multiple-adjacent C2H2 proteins such as TFIIIA, WT1 and
Roaz bind only 24-75% of their zinc fingers to DNA,
while the remaining zinc fingers may bind to proteins and
RNA, including dsRNA and DNA-RNA heterocomplexes
(see [35] for review). A phylogenetic maximum likelihood
analysis using the zinc finger regions for the predicted
KR-H1 proteins is not in conflict with the phylogenetic
relationship of the represented insect orders (Fig. 4) albeit
with weak bootstrap support [36,37]. The KR-H1 tree
should not be regarded as an approximation of insect
species phylogeny: it is intended to represent the relative
relationship of the KR-H1 orthologs of A. mellifera and B.
terrestris to each other and to species from other orders
of insects.
There is a high degree of conservation between the predicted B. terrestris KR-H1 protein and the A. mellifera
protein, with 97% identity across the whole protein without gaps removed. Interestingly, the sequence of the
ortholog from Nasonia vitripennis, a solitary wasp and
the only other hymenopteran ortholog currently available, is highly divergent from the two bee species in the
C-terminal region. Data from other species will be necessary to determine if this sequence divergence is related to
differences in evolutionary lineage or associated with differences in life history or behavior.
While the zinc finger regions are conserved among the
insect KR-H1 orthologs, there are important variations in
the arrangement of these zinc fingers between the lineages, particularly between dipteran and non-dipteran
species, which may have consequences on KR-H1 func-

tion. Most importantly, the coding region between zinc
finger 1 (Z1) and Z2 contains an insertion-deletion
(indel) that varies with taxon. In the dipeteran lineage,
the indel ranges from 34-65 aa, and thus is much longer
than in other taxa, where the length varies from 9-14 aa.
The other zinc fingers are universally separated by 7 residues. In addition to the zinc finger region, there is a conserved region at the C-terminus of KR-H1 orthologs,
characterized by LP(L/P)RKR which is separated by a
variable indel from RX2SVIX2A at the extreme C-terminus. In the dipteran lineages, the indel ranges from 28 to
60 aa, and thus is much longer than in other taxa where
the length varies from 14 to 19 aa.

Discussion
Regulation of worker behavior and physiology by dominant queens and workers is a hallmark of insect society.
In honey bees and bumble bees, this regulation is largely
mediated by inhibition of JH levels in workers, which
results in inhibition of behavioral maturation in honey
bees and reproductive development in bumble bees
[13,19,23]. These observations support a model in which
social stimuli inhibit similar JH-mediated social pathways
in both species, but these pathways ultimately regulate
different behavioral programs. Together, the studies in
honey bees and bumble bees suggest that Kr-h1 is a part
of a conserved genetic module which was co-opted to
adjust the social behavior of workers to their social environmental context.
In the bumble bee, brain Kr-h1 levels are associated
with dominance and reproductive status. Kr-h1 levels are
high in the brains of dominant queenless bees, which are
characterized by rapid oogenesis and high JH titers. Brain
Kr-h1 levels are low in queenright workers and subordinate queenless workers in which oogenesis is inhibited by
the presence of a dominant queen or worker [2325,34,38]. In contrast to honey bees, high Kr-h1 levels
were not associated with foraging behavior. In fact, in two
of the colonies Kr-h1 levels were higher in nurses than in
foragers, which is consistent with the general association
between high Kr-h1 levels and ovarian activity: oogenesis

is typically more rapid in nurses than in foragers of similar age and genotype [34,28,39]. However, in both of these
groups ovarian development is slower than in queenless
workers (see above) which may account for the overall
low ovarian activation measured for 7-day-old bees from
colonies B and C. The association between Kr-h1 expression, JH, and ovarian activity is further exemplified by the
evidence that JH treatment caused an increase in both
Kr-h1 expression and ovarian development.
In honey bees, the regulation of Kr-h1 is different.
Brain Kr-h1 levels were not significantly different
between workers with activated or inactivated ovaries,
and Kr-h1 levels were not regulated by mating or reproductive status in queens [40,41]. While brain Kr-h1 levels
are always higher in foragers relative to bees involved in
in-hive activities, Kr-h1 levels were not significantly different between foragers and foragers that reverted to performing nursing behavior [31,42]. Similarly, there is
increased neural branching in the mushroom bodies
which develops when the bee becomes a forager but does
not change when she reverts to brood care [43]. JH treatment affected this processes in some studies, but neuronal branching did occur in bees with no circulating JH,
suggesting that JH may affect the pace of mushroom body
development, but not its overall occurrence [44]. In this
regard, it is interesting to note that there is some evidence
that Kr-h1 may play a role in modulating neuromorphology in Drosophila, and expression levels of Kr-h1 are specifically regulated in the mushroom bodies of honey bee
workers [32,45]. These recent studies with honey bees
lend credence to the premise that Kr-h1 is more strongly
associated with the detection and processing of social
stimuli than specifically with foraging behavior or reproduction.
The correlation between JH titers and brain Kr-h1 levels under diverse social conditions in both honey bees
and bumble bees suggest that Kr-h1 and JH are involved
in the same pathway (or network) that is influenced by

bee B. terrestris, JH treatment caused a significant
increase in brain Kr-h1 transcript levels relative to a vehi-

cle treatment, suggesting that JH acts upstream of Kr-h1.
This model is consistent with findings in D. melanogaster
and Tribolium casteneum, in which Kr-h1 expression is
increased by treatment with JH analogs during prepupal
and pupal stages [46-48]. In honey bees, it is more difficult to precisely determine the relative position of JH and
Kr-h1 in the signaling pathway, and the relationship

between these two factors may be more complex. Treatment with the juvenile hormone analog methoprene
increased brain Kr-h1 levels in queenright bees [31]. By
contrast, in queenless groups of bees, neither methoprene nor JH III treatment raised Kr-h1 levels above those
found in control bees (Fussnecker and Grozinger, unpublished observations), and Kr-h1 levels are not always high

Shpigler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/120

when JH levels are high [42]. One interpretation for this
apparent discrepancy between the treatment effect in
queenright and queenless conditions is that JH does
influence Kr-h1 expression, but under queenless conditions transcript levels are already high and cannot be
increased further by treatment with JH or its analogs.
Alternatively, Kr-h1 expression may be regulated by additional factors that mask the influence of JH. The influence
of JH treatment on queenless workers has not yet been
tested for bumble bees, and thus the relationship between
Kr-h1 levels and JH titers in bumble bees might also be
affected by social conditions.
Transcription factors like Kr-h1 play an important role
in the evolution of physiological, morphological, and
behavioral traits [33]. Changes in the amino acid
sequence - including the addition or deletion of small
protein-binding motifs or alterations in the arrangement
of DNA-binding domains - could modulate the function
of transcription factors, and the modular architecture of
these proteins suggest these changes can occur without
large pleiotropic consequences. This sequence variation
could alter the types of promoter regions that transcription factors bind to, or modify protein-protein interactions, leading to differences in the signaling pathways that
regulate transcription factors. Kr-h1 plays an important
role during development and metamorphosis, particularly in development of the central and peripheral nervous system in D. melanogaster and Tribolium castanium
[45-49]. However, its function in Hymenoptera at some
level may be quite divergent, particularly given the significant sequence differences between dipteran and nondipteran KR-H1 orthologs. Furthermore, the molecular
function of Kr-h1 in adult insects remains to be determined. It is interesting to note that while the B. terrestris
and A. mellifera orthologs are nearly identical there are
large differences in the C-terminal region of the predicted
Kr-h1 ortholog from N. vitripennis, a solitary parasitic
wasp. Further comparative genomic studies and functional assays will be necessary to determine if Kr-h1's
function truly diverges between social and nonsocial
Hymenoptera, and between different insect orders, or if
the sequence differences are simply due to the accumulation of mutations during evolution in different lineages.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that Kr-h1 is associated with JH
mediated regulation of reproduction in bumble bees. In
contrast, in honey bees Kr-h1 is associated with worker
division of labor. In both bee species however, the expression of Kr-h1 in the brain is inhibited by the queen and
associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of
social organization. The comparative studies with honey
bees and bumble bees suggest that Kr-h1 is part of a conserved pathway linking the perception of social signals

Page 8 of 13

from the queen and other workers to JH regulated
changes in social behavior. Since the KR-H1 orthologs in
honey bees and bumble bees are highly conserved, they
may transcriptionally regulate similar genetic modules.
However, we hypothesize that downstream of Kr-h1, the
pathway may diverge to regulate functions associated
with worker task in honey bees and reproduction in bumble bees. Additional studies on the function of Kr-h1 and
the genes it regulates may allow a better understanding of
the evolution of queen control over worker behavior in
social insects.
There is increasing evidence that the genetic pathways
underlying developmental, physiological, or behavioral
traits are conserved across species, and modifications in
the coordination or expression of these pathways can
have profound effects and produce distinct phenotypes
(reviewed in [50,51]). Comparisons of honey bees and
bumble bees allow us to examine the genetic conservation of socially responsive behavioral pathways, and to
elucidate the interplay of specific genes and physiological
pathways, such as JH. JH is a principle insect endocrine
signal that appears to have a somewhat variable function
in social insects. It retains its "classical" gonadotrophic
function in some species such as the bumble bee B. terrestris, while in other species such as the honey bee A.
mellifera it is instead implicated in the regulation of agerelated division of labor [29,52-54]. Given of the association of social organization, JH levels, and Kr-h1 expression, additional studies on the function of Kr-h1 and the
genes it regulates in bees and other insect species will
allow us to further characterize this pivotal "social pathway", and ultimately shed light on the evolution of complex insect societies and their enigmatic endocrine
regulation.

Methods
General Bumble Bee Rearing

We obtained colonies of Bombus terrestris from Polyam
Pollination Services, Yad-Mordechai, Israel. Each colony
contained a queen, 5-10 workers (about 3 - 7 days after
the emergence of the first worker), and brood at different
stages of development. Colonies were housed in wooden
nesting boxes (30 × 23 × 20 cm) with Plexiglas covers in
an environmental chamber (28 ± 1°C; ~50% RH) in constant darkness at the bee research facility at the Edmond
J. Safra campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
Givat Ram, Jerusalem. Commercial sugar syrup and fresh
pollen (mixed with sugar syrup) were provided ad libitum. All observations and treatments were made under
dim red light that the bees cannot see. As an index for the
degree of ovarian activity, we measured the length of the
largest terminal oocyte [24,26,34]. As an index for body
size, we measured the length of the front wing margin

Shpigler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/120

cell, which is highly correlated with wing length and other
indices for body size (e.g., [55]).
Identification of B. terrestris Kr-h1

Total RNA was extracted from the heads of individual
bumble bees using a PicoPure kit (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA was synthesized using 100 ng of
total RNA with ArrayScript Reverse Transcriptase
(Ambion, Austin, TX). PCR primers designed to A. mellifera Kr-h1 (see Additional file 3 Table S1) were used in a
standard PCR reaction mix which also included 5%
DMSO in a touchdown PCR reaction. PCR products
were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Each primer pair produced a single dominant band. Gel bands were cut for
DNA purification (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). DNA quantity and quality was assayed
with a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington DE). Sequencing was performed
with the PCR primers at the NCSU Genome Research
Laboratory using the BigDye Terminator sequencing protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). This procedure was repeated on a second B. terrestris sample, as
well as an A. mellifera sample from the same apiary at
HUJI, to ensure that there was no cross-species contamination and the B. terrestris and A. mellifera sequences
were distinct. The B. terrestris Kr-h1 sequence is available
in GenBank (GQ903677).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of brain gene
expression

Bees were collected by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen
and immediately transferred to dry ice. Heads were separated and stored at -80°C until RNA analysis. Heads were
partially lyophilized to facilitate dissection of brains. The
total RNA from the dissected tissue was extracted using
an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, for analyses carried out in
NCSU) or Invisorb Spin Tissue RNA Mini Kit (Invitek
GmbH, Berlin, Germany, for analyses carried out in
HUJI), and quantified via a ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies). cDNA was synthesized from
250 ng of RNA. To estimate the level of gene expression
we used an ABI 7900 (NCSU) or an ABI7000 (HUJI)
sequence detector and a SYBR green detection protocol
(Applied Biosystems). Elongation Factor 1 a (EF1a) was
used as a control housekeeping gene (for more details see
[32,56]). Three technical replicates were performed for
each sample/primer set. Quantification was based on the
number of PCR cycles (Ct) required to cross a threshold
of fluorescence intensity, using the 2-ΔCt technique (ABI
User Bulletin 2). For graphical representation, data were
normalized to the sample with the lowest relative Kr-h1
levels (which therefore received the value 1), and fold differences in relative expression levels are depicted as mean
± se. For the statistical analyses we used the ΔCt values,

Page 9 of 13

which are normally distributed. The sequences of the Krh1 and EF1a primers are in Additional file 4, Table S2. We
used 6-15 biological replicates for each sample group; the
sample size for each experiment is presented in the
Results section.
The influence of queen presence on brain Kr-h1 levels in
workers

We carried out two experiments to test the influence of
the queen on Kr-h1 levels in workers. In the first experiment, we collected 1-day-old callow workers from mixed
colony backgrounds (this is done because a single colony
does not produce a sufficient number of newly emerged
bees in a single day), paint-marked them on their thoraces, and assigned them randomly to one of the following
social environments: 1) a queenright colony, or 2) orphan
groups of three workers in wooden cages (10 × 11 × 5 cm)
with a Plexiglas top (3 workers/cage). We placed the colonies and small groups in an environmental chamber (28 ±
1°C) and provisioned them with commercial sugar syrup
(Polyam, Yad Mordechai, Israel) and ground pollen.
Maintaining workers in small groups in cages mimics the
social environment of a queenless colony but allows a
higher proportion of workers to acquire the top (α) dominance rank [24,26,34,57]. Using multiple small queenless
groups therefore results in the production of a higher
proportion of uninhibited bees, because dominant workers typically inhibit reproductive physiology and behavior
in subordinate groupmates [25,26,38,57]. Workers from
the queenless groups and from the queenright colonies
were collected after 4 days into liquid nitrogen. Previous
studies indicate that at four days of age there are significant physiological and behavioral differences between
queenless and queenright workers [23-26,34,58,59].
Three trials were completed, for a total of 43 queenright
and 33 queenless individuals. Brain Kr-h1 levels were
quantified at NCSU using qRT-PCR, as described above.
Data from individual trials were analyzed using a twotailed t-test; data from all three trials were combined and
analyzed in a mixed model ANOVA (proc mixed in SAS
9.2, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) with treatment and trial
as variables.
In the second experiment we compared workers that
were reared in queenless and queenright colonies. We
obtained 4 colonies, each with about 20 workers and a
similar amount of developing brood. After one day of
acclimation to the lab, we removed the queen from two
randomly selected colonies, and within two hours introduced 12 callow bees (from a mixed origin pool of bees
that emerged during the previous 24 hours) into each colony. In order to keep colony size and density intact, we
removed a similar number of workers from each host colony [60]. The bees were collected and analyzed as
described above. Brain Kr-h1 levels were quantified at

Shpigler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/120

HUJI using qRT-PCR. For statistical analysis we used a
one-way ANOVA with colony as a variable (SPSS 15.0).
The influence of task on brain Kr-h1 levels

We placed incipient bumble bee colonies in an environmental chamber (28 ± 1°C). During the first one to three
weeks the colonies were fed ad libitum with commercial
syrup and fresh pollen (collected by honey bees). The
nest box was connected to the outside by a clear plastic
tube (~1 m length, 2 cm diameter) and food provisioning
was gradually stopped. We performed three repetitions,
each with a different colony (termed A, B, and C). We
connected the colonies when they contained ~50 workers
(Colony A, 18 days from the emergence of the first
worker), ~70 workers (Colony B, 19 days after the emergence of the first worker), or 20 workers (Colony C, about
two weeks after the emergence of the first worker). We
performed detailed (1-2 hrs during the morning, and 1-2
hrs during the evening, at a similar time of day) daily
observations, starting three to seven days after connecting the colony to the outside. We marked each bee with a
number tag and observed the colonies for at least three
consecutive days before collection. Foragers were defined
as bees observed returning to the hive with conspicuous
pollen loads on their hind legs (returning from a foraging
trip) every day during the observation period while doing
no, or very little, brood care; nurses were bees observed
caring for the brood, and doing no, or very little, foraging
during this period (for more details, see [55]). We collected samples for RNA analysis (nurses N = 7, 25, 19;
forager N = 15, 14, and 10 from colonies A, B, and C,
respectively) on the last observation day (approximately
32, 33, and 26 days after the emergence of the first worker
for colonies A, B, and C, respectively). During this time
the colonies were self supporting. Colonies were monitored for the remainder of their life cycle, and the presence of open egg cells was used to estimate the initiation
of the "competition phase" (which is characterized by
competition over reproduction between the queen and
workers; [38,61]). Based on this, Colony B was likely in
the competition phase at the point of collection. Data
were analyzed using two-tailed t-tests, and two-way
ANOVA for data pooled from the three trials. In the first
repetition (Colony A), we collected the samples in Israel
and shipped them on dry ice to NCSU for gene expression analysis. In the second and third repetitions (Colonies B and C) we measured the RNA levels in Israel. We
measured ovarian status and body size only for bees from
Colony A and C.
The influence of dominance rank on brain Kr-h1 levels in
groups of queenless workers

One-day old workers from mixed colony backgrounds
were paint-marked and placed in groups of three in small
wooden cages in a constantly dark environmental cham-

Page 10 of 13

ber (28 ± 1°C, ~50%RH). Bees in each group were of similar body size and age. For each queenless group, at least
two sets of observations were carried out (20 min each):
the first on day three, and the second on day seven, just
before collecting the bees into liquid nitrogen. Dominance index was calculated following the method
described in [24]. Briefly, for each encounter, we recorded
which bee advanced and which retreated. The dominance
index was defined as: 1 - retreats/total encounters. In
addition we recorded all agonistic behaviors including
threatening behavior and overt aggression [24,62]. We
classified the bees according to their dominance rank; the
most dominant bee was dubbed "α", the median "β", and
the lowest in the rank "γ". Brain RNA levels were analyzed only for groups in which the degree of aggressiveness matched the calculated dominance rank (the α bee is
the most agonistically active) for a total of 12 groups (out
of 13 groups tested). Brain Kr-h1 levels were quantified in
Israel using qRT-PCR, as described above. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with dominance rank as
the variable, and with a Chi-square goodness of fit test
with the expected probability for dominant individual to
have the highest brain Kr-h1 levels = 0.33.
The influence of juvenile hormone on Kr-h1 levels in
queenright workers

One-day-old workers from a mixed colony background
were paint-marked and assigned randomly to one of the
following treatments (N = 15-17 bees/treatment): 1) JHtreatment, we dissolved 70 μg JH-III (Sigma, cat J2000,
purity ≥ 65%, lot# = 087K26321; St. Louis, MO) in 5 μl
DMF (J.T Backer cat: 7032 - 1L lot: 0509710007 Dimethylformamide) and applied the solution to the dorsal part
of the thorax following the method of [63]. We used JHIII
because it is the only JH analogue found in B. terrestris
[23,24]. 2) DMF treatment, same as in (1), but we treated
the bees with 5 μl DMF; 3) untreated control, we handled
the bees as in the two other groups, but did not treat
them with any solution. Bees from all three treatments
were introduced into a young queenright colony (containing a viable queen and before the competition phase);
all the introduced workers were accepted to the host colonies with no evidence for aggression. After 3 days we
collected eight to ten bees/treatment into liquid nitrogen
for subsequent RNA analysis. At 7 days of age, we collected five to eight additional bees per group for the analysis of ovarian state and body size. We used a mixed
model ANOVA with treatment as the variable for the
analyses of gene expression data and body size, and the
Kruskal Wallis nonparametric test for the analysis of
ovarian state (all proc mixed in SPSS 15.0).
Alignments of Kr-h1 orthologs

Sequences of 20 KR-H1 insect orthologs were obtained
(Additional file 1,2 Fig. S1, GenBank accession numbers

for all orthologs can be found below). For the Drosophila
species, the isoforms orthologous to Drosophila melanogaster KR-H1β were used. The complete protein
sequences were aligned using ClustalW packaging in BioEdit 7.0, using the full multiple alignment feature (Additional file 1,2 Fig. S1)[64]. Alignment parameters were set
to BLOSUM protein weight matrix with a gap opening
penalty set to 10.0 and gap extension penalty set at 0.05.
Sequences were not aligned by eye given the high degree
of divergence outside of conserved regions.
The relatively conserved zinc finger region, which
spans 277 amino acids sites and is indicated by the red
bar in Additional file 1,2 Fig. S1, was used for the phylogenetic analysis. The maximum likelihood tree was constructed using phyML 3.0, under a fixed model of amino
acid substitutions, allowing for substitution rate variation
among site with a gamma distribution [65-67]. The tree
was drawn in MEGA4 [68]. Acyrthosiphon pisum
(Homoptera) was used as the outgroup to the holometabolous insects based on well-established species phylogenetic data [36,37,69-71]. Branch support values are
indicated at each node are from an analysis of 1000 bootstrap replicates. The WAG model of amino acid evolution
was used [72]. The final tree was uploaded into treeBASE
(Accession number SN4664).
Accession numbers are as follows: pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (XM001946159); Aedes aegypti mosquito
(EAT46451); Anopheles gambiae mosquito (EAA13888);
