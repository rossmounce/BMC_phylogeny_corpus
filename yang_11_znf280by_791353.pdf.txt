Y-chromosome gene families in Bovidae

Abstract
Background: Recent progress in exploring the Y-chromosome gene content in humans, mice and cats have
suggested that “autosome-to-Y” transposition of the male fertility genes is a recurrent theme during the
mammalian Y-chromosome evolution. These transpositions are lineage-dependent. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the lineage-specific Y-chromosome genes in bovid.
Results: We took a direct testis cDNA selection strategy and discovered two novel gene families, ZNF280BY and
ZNF280AY, on the bovine (Bos taurus) Y-chromosome (BTAY), which originated from the transposition of a gene
block on the bovine chromosome 17 (BTA17) and subsequently amplified. Approximately 130 active ZNF280BY loci
(and ~240 pseudogenes) and ~130 pseudogenized ZNF280AY copies are present over the majority of the malespecific region (MSY). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both gene families fit with the “birth-and-death” model
of evolution. The active ZNF280BY loci share high sequence similarity and comprise three major genomic
structures, resulted from insertions/deletions (indels). Assembly of a 1.2 Mb BTAY sequence in the MSY ampliconic
region demonstrated that ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY, together with HSFY and TSPY families, constitute the major
elements within the repeat units. The ZNF280BY gene family was found to express in different developmental
stages of testis with sense RNA detected in all cell types of the seminiferous tubules while the antisense RNA
detected only in the spermatids. Deep sequencing of the selected cDNAs revealed that different loci of ZNF280BY
were differentially expressed up to 60-fold. Interestingly, different copies of the ZNF280AY pseudogenes were also
found to differentially express up to 10-fold. However, expression level of the ZNF280AY pseudogenes was almost
6-fold lower than that of the ZNF280BY genes. ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY gene families are present in bovid, but
absent in other mammalian lineages.
Conclusions: ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY are lineage-specific, multi-copy Y-gene families specific to Bovidae, and are
derived from the transposition of an autosomal gene block. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of
ZNF280BYs in testis suggest a role in spermatogenesis. This study offers insights into the genomic organization of
the bovine MSY and gene regulation in spermatogenesis, and provides a model for studying evolution of
multi-copy gene families in mammals.

Background
Sex-determination in Eutheria depends on the X and Y
chromosomes (X/Y-chr) that evolved from a pair of autosomes less than 166 million years ago (Mya), after the
divergence of the monotreme lineage [1,2]. Acquisition of
a sex-determining locus (SRY) transformed the ancestral
autosomes to the proto-X/Y [3] and a subsequent stepwise

suppression of meiotic recombination between X and Y
led to a male-specific region on the Y-chr (MSY) [3,4].
The remaining euchromatic region of the Y-chr, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), retains the ability to recombine with the X-chr during meiosis and shares the same
genes and DNA sequences with its X counterpart [3,5-9].
The Y-chr, compared to the gene-rich (~1600 genes) and
highly conserved X-chr, has degenerated and lost more
than 95% of ancestral genes, and is poorly conserved
among mammalian lineages [7,9-11]. After recombination
was suppressed with the X-chr, degeneration of the Y-chr
was driven by several synergistic evolutionary forces,

including Muller’s ratchet, background selection, the Hill
Robertson effect with weak selection and hitchhiking of
deleterious alleles by favorable mutations [12,13]. Independent Y-chr decay during evolution [3,14] led to different
eutherian lineages retaining different subsets of Y genes,
and a diverse and lineage-specific Y-chr gene content.
Male-benefit genes have accumulated on the Y-chr
through persistence of genes derived from the proto-X/
Y [3], transposition and retroposition from autosomes
and subsequent amplification [15-18]. Y-chr gene amplification with an attendant higher level of expression has
been suggested to enhance gene function particularly
beneficial to the male [4,19]. As a result, gene accumulation and amplification have provided the Y-chr with a
functional coherence in sex determination, spermatogenesis and fertility not observed in other regions of
eutherian genomes [15], with genes in MSY showing
remarkably uniform expression patterns either exclusively or predominantly in the testis [4,19].
To date, several lineage-specific Y-chr gene families,
including the human DAZ, CDY, the mouse Ssty1 and
the cat TETY1 and FLJ36031, have been reported
[4,18,20-22]. DAZ and CDY appear as main candidates
for the human Azoospermia Factor (AZF) [23-32].
Although these two primate lineage-specific Y genes are
autosomal in cattle and other non-primates, their functions in spermatogenesis and male fertility are highly
conserved in the non-primate autosomal orthologs
[4,24,32-34].
Causal reasons for the species-specific accumulation of
Y-genes remain elusive, as little information is available
regarding the gene content of the Y-chr in most eutherian mammals. We believed that the identification of
species-specific Y-genes in individual species will
increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying gene acquisition and evolution, and offer insights
into the genes central to regulation of male fertility and
spermatogenesis.
The bovine (Bos taurus) Y-chr (BTAY) was estimated
to be ~1.77% (~51 Mb) of the entire bovine genome
(2.87 Gb) [35,36]. The MSY region comprises ~95% of
BTAY, approximately 50% of which belongs to the
euchromatic region (~24 Mb) [37]. Previous studies on
BTAY were based on a comparative mapping approach
[37], resulting in several Y-linked genes, such as
AMELY, DDX3Y, SRY, TSPY, UTY and ZFY [38-41].
However, due to the limitation of the comparative mapping approach, lineage-specific Y-chr gene(s) has not
been extensively analyzed in bovid.
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the
MSY region, and to identify and characterize the bovid
lineage-specific Y-chr gene(s). By using a direct testis
cDNA selection approach [20,42], we discovered two
bovine-specific Y-chr gene families–ZNF280BY (Zinc finger

protein 280B Y-link, also known as SUHW2, suppressor of
hairy wing homolog 2) and ZNF280AY (Zinc finger protein
280A Y-link, or SUHW1), which originated from a segmental duplication of their paralogs on the bovine chr 17
(BTA17) and were subsequently amplified to over 100
copies on BTAY. To our knowledge, this is the first report
on an autosome-to-Y “gene block” transposition. The
transposition and amplification of ZNF280B/ZNF280A on
the bovid Y-chr provides a fundamental model for further
studying the expansion of multigene families on Y-chr and
for understanding the evolutionary force that shapes the
gene functions.

Results
Identification of ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY gene families

BTAY-expressed sequences were enriched by hybridizing a mixed testis cDNA with a micro-dissected, PCR
amplified, biotin-labeled BTAY probe [39,43]. The
enriched BTAY cDNAs were sequenced by two different
technologies (see Methods). Among the 273 transcripts
obtained from the Sanger sequencing, 46 (~17%)
matched to an unmapped bovine ZNF280B mRNA
(NM_001078120.1) with a sequence similarity ranging
from 97% to 100%. This mRNA on the Y-chr has differentiated and shares 93% sequence identity with
ZNF280B on BTA17 (NM_001077935.1). Assembly of
~13 million short (36 bp) reads from the next generation sequencing resulted in ~4,500 sequence contigs (to
be published separately). One of the contigs is a fulllength cDNA (1,989 bp, GenBank acc. no. HQ014563)
with 99% similarity to NM_001078120. Another 3,386
bp contig (GenBank acc. no. HQ014564) is a paralog of
the predicted bovine ZNF280A (XM_596386.4 and
XM_002694686.1) with a sequence similarity of 91%.
The bovine ZNF280B (aliases: SUHW2, 5’OY11.1)
(NM_001077935.1) and ZNF280A (aliases: SUHW1,
3’OY11.1) (XM_596386.4) genes map next to each other
on the distal long arm (74.307-74.326 Mb) of BTA17
(Build 4, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/517697). We
have confirmed, by male-specific PCR, that the
NM_001078120 mRNA and the two cDNA contigs
paralogous to either ZNF280B or ZNF280A are all Ylinked in cattle (Figure 1). Therefore, we referred these
two genes as ZNF280BY or ZNF280AY.
In the absence of a BTAY sequence assembly, we
blast-searched ZNF280BY (NM_001078120) against all
sequenced bovine bacterial artificial chromosomes
(BACs) deposited in GenBank (HTGS database) and
identified 252 BACs (240 annotated Y-BACs, the
remaining BACs are draft sequences) that contains a
total of 377 copies of ZNF280BY (1-5 copies/BAC).
A similar search with ZNF280AY (acc. no. HQ014564)
resulted in the identification of 132 BACs (124 annotated Y-BACs, 8 draft sequence BACs), which all

be Y-specific genes via the male-specific PCR (lane marked with ♂).
ZNF280BY is expressed predominantly in the testes and slightly in
liver, adrenal gland and lymph node while the autosomal ZNF280B
is expressed specifically in the testis. The ZNF280AY is expressed
predominantly in the spleen and low in testis and brain, while the

contained the ZNF280BY genes. All ZNF280AY-BACs
harbor a single copy, except for one BAC that contains
two separate copies of ZNF280AY, resulting in a total of
133 copies of ZNF280AY. These results suggest that
both ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY are multi-copy gene
families on BTAY.
Point mutations and insertions/deletions (indels) were
found to be present in many of the ZNF280BY copies
based on sequence alignment and open reading frame
(ORF) analyses, leading to 241 copies with short or no
ORFs. Thus, they are pseudogenes. The remaining 136

copies, in which their ORF varied from 222 aa to 543
aa, were predicted to be active at the transcription level
using Splign program [44] (Additional file 1). Among all
potential active ZNF280BY loci, 113 contain the normal
full-length mRNA of 1,954 bp (acc. no. GU144303,
Figure 2, type A), and encode a peptide of 543 aa, which
is 87% identical to the ZNF280B protein on BTA17
(NM_001077935, 545 aa). The remaining 23 loci encode
peptides of 222 to 469 aa, resulted from nonsense mutations or indels (Additional file 1). Two of the short peptides, 431 aa (type B, acc. no. GU144304) and 424 aa
(type C, acc. no. GU144305), were investigated in details
(Figure 2). All ZNF280BYs have two exons with the coding segment (CDS) in exon 2. The only intron in the
ZNF280BY family is located in the 5’-UTR region, 71 bp
upstream of the start codon, and varies in size ranging
from 9.1 to 31.7 kb among type A, B, and C. The first
exon of type C does not share any homology with type
A or B (Figure 2). RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA
ends) and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the type
B contains a 13 bp insertion at nt 1247 within the CDS,
leading to a frame shift and a stop codon (TAA) at nt
1293, and hence, a shorter peptide of 431 aa (Figure 2).
Type C has an 8 bp deletion at nt 1218, resulting in a
premature stop codon (TAA) at nt 1273 and a 424 aa
peptide. In type B and C, only three and two zinc finger
motifs were detected, respectively, while the normal
ZNF280BY (type A) has four zinc finger motifs.
A series of analyses were carried out to verify whether
the predicted active loci of ZNF280BY are transcriptionally active. First, pairwise alignment of the ZNF280BY
cDNA sequences obtained from the Sanger sequencing

with the Y-BAC genomic sequences identified 28 unique
cDNAs that match perfectly to one or more type A
sequences (a total of 80), and two additional unique
cDNAs matched to type B and C, indicating at least 82
loci of ZNF280BY are expressed in bovine testes (Additional file 2). Second, alignment of the ZNF280BYmatched Illumina reads (pair-end, 2 × 36 bp) to each of
the predicted ZNF280BY loci revealed that at least 96
loci are transcriptionally active (Figure 3A, Additional
file 3). Since the results from Sanger sequencing and
Illumina sequencing overlap ~80%, they complement
each other. Third, 5’- and 3’-RACE confirmed the
expression of the ZNF280BY type B and C. Finally, multiple alignment of promoter sequences indicated that
ZNF280BY type A promoters are highly conserved
(>98% similarity). These results collectively suggest that
all predicted ZNF280BY loci on BTAY may be transcriptionally active.

For the bovine ZNF280AY gene family, the ZNF280AY
cDNA (acc. no. HQ014564) contains a short ORF
(113 aa). Further analysis of all 133 ZNF280AY genomic
sequences predicted short ORFs ranging from 100 to
262 aa, which are less than half the length of the protein
encoded by ZNF280A (538 aa). Therefore, we speculate
that all ZNF280AY loci on BTAY were pseudogenized.
However, our Illumina sequence analysis indicated that
as many as 91 ZNF280AY loci (with an average length
of 2620 bp, ranging from 1656 bp to 3386 bp) could be
transcriptionally active, and that 51 of them were
unquestionably expressed as they matched 100% with
unique read pairs (Figure 3B, Additional file 3).

BACs deposited in GenBank. These BACs were
assembled under stringent criteria that assured overlaps
between BACs were ≥30 kb in size with ≥99.99%
sequence identity. We obtained a 1.2 Mb contig of nine
BACs using Sequencher 4.8 (Genecodes, Ann Arbor,
MI) (Figure 4, Additional file 4) that contained 11 loci
of ZNF280BY (Figure 4), of which three were potentially
coding and shared the same structure as ZNF280BY
type A, while the remainder were pseudogenes. Interestingly, each active ZNF280BY is accompanied by a
pseudo ZNF280AY, forming a ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY
block with a 19 kb interval. The HSFY (heat shock transcription factor, Y-linked) and TSPY (testis-specific protein, Y-linked) gene family also reside within this contig
and amplified similarly to ZNF280BY (Figure 4). The 1.2
Mb contig may represent a typical ampliconic region
reflecting the redundant nature of BTAY DNA.

Interspersed repeats comprise ~58% of the 1.2 Mb contig and contain a high density of long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) and retrotransposable elements
(RTEs), but low density of short interspersed repetitive
elements (SINEs), thus consistent with a previous report
on the bovine genome [35]. Two major directed repeats
(DRs) are present in this region: DR1 and DR2 (Figure
4). DR1 contains three 110 kb repeat units (DR1-1, -2,
and -3), which are 99.40% similar without considering
gaps. DR1 has one ZNF280BY pseudogene in each repetitive unit. DR1-1 and DR1-3 share an extra 65 kb
extended repeat with 99.70% similarity that contains one
active ZNF280BY. DR2 contains two 64 kb units which
are 99.50% similar, as well as pseudogene copies of
ZNF280BY. There are also two inverted repeats (IRs),
IR1 and IR2, over 99.50% similar (Figure 4), which span
60 kb (30 kb per arm) and 134 kb (67 kb per arm),

respectively. One pseudogenized ZNF280BY was
detected in each arm of IR2, but no ZNF280BY
sequence was present in IR1. However, when the identity threshold of IR1 was lowered to 98.50%, we were
able to expand the length of IR1 to 500 kb and identify
a ZNF280BY pseudogene in each arm. The 1.2 Mb contig apparently contains multiple internally repeat units,
with ZNF280BY, ZNF280AY, HSFY and TSPY representing the major gene families (Figure 4).
The origin of the ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY block

In order to gain insight into the evolution of the
ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY gene families, we retrieved

Page 6 of 15

ZNF280B/BY and ZNF280A/AY orthologous sequences
from 10 mammalian species available to date (Figure 5,
Additional file 5) and conducted phylogenetic analysis.
We found that the autosomal ZNF280B-ZNF280A gene
block on BTA17 is highly conserved among all
sequenced eutherians (except for mouse, rat and elephant), including human, chimpanzee, macaque, cow,
dog, pig, and guinea pigs, and even in non-placental vertebrates (opossum, chicken, frog, and zebrafish) (Additional file 6). However, ZNF280BY/AY orthologs were
identified only in bovid (cattle and sheep) Y-chrs. The
Ovis aries Y chromosome repeat region OY11.1 DNA
sequence (acc. no. U30307.1) was first deposited in

Neighboring-joining method implemented in MEGA4 software [77]. The trees are drawn to scale and the evolutionary distances were computed
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [83]. The filled

GenBank in 1995, and confirmed by fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) to be conserved throughout
Bovidae [45].
The OY11.1 repeat sequence covers the ZNF280B
(5’OY11.1), but not the ZNF280A (3’OY11.1) (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gene) sequence. The similarity between the ovine and bovine ZNF280BY is 88% at
the nucleotide level and 86% at the protein level. Due to
the unfinished ovine genome sequencing, we were not
able to retrieve the ovine ZNF280B, ZNF280A and
ZNF280AY sequences in this study.
We built phylogenetic trees (Figure 5) for both gene
families using neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximumlikelihood (ML) methods. The topologies were consistent between the NJ and ML tree. All predicted
ZNF280BY (type A, B, and C) cDNAs (Additional files 1
and 2) were grouped in a single cluster (Figure 5A). The
bovine ZNF280BY gene family together with the ovine
ZNF280BY (OY11.1) were clustered with the bovine
BTA17 ZNF280B and formed one clade with a perfect
bootstrap support (Figure 5A). The autosomal orthologs
of the bovine ZNF280B in eight mammalian species were
clustered in a different clade, also with a strong bootstrap
support (95-100%) (Figure 5A). The phylogenetic tree
of the bovine ZNF280A/ZNF280AY (Figure 5B) is very
similar to the one of ZNF280B/ZNF280BY, although
mouse and rat were excluded in the analysis as their
orthologous sequences were not available. The facts that
the ZNF280B/ZNF280A gene block is located in a region
of conserved synteny in eutherians and that the
ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY gene families are present in
bovid only, strongly suggest that the Y-linked families
were a transposition of the autosomal (BTA17) block.
This autosome-to-Y transposition event occurred most
likely before the divergence of cattle and sheep, which
was estimated to be ~19.6 Mya [46].
We estimated the age of the active ZNF280BY loci by
using the bovine and ovine ZNF280BY sequences with the
neutral rate estimates as the molecular clock (Figure 5A).
The mean Ks value between bovine and ovine ZNF280BY
is 0.1517. The maximum pairwise Ks value of the most
distant ZNF280BY locus (AC172950) to the remaining
active loci in bovine is 0.0443. Based on the previous estimation of the divergence time of 19.6 Mya between the
two species [46], we estimated that the duplication events
for the current active ZNF280BY loci occurred approximately 5.7 Mya (0.0443/0.1517 × 19.6) [47].
The expression profile of ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY

RT-PCR analyses revealed that ZNF280BY expression is
predominant in testis but low in liver, adrenal gland and
lymph node, while the autosomal ZNF280B expression
is specific to testis (Figure 1). The expression of
ZNF280AY pseudogenes is high in spleen but low in

Page 7 of 15

testis and brain, while the ZNF280A expression was not
detected among the nine tissues tested (Figure 1).
In situ hybridization (ISH) with ZNF280BY indicated
that the sense and antisense RNA of this gene are
expressed in adult testis (Figure 6). ZNF280BY sense
RNA was widely expressed (Figure 6A), but the antisense
RNA was detected only in the spermatids (Figure 6B).
The expression of the sense and antisense RNA of the
ZNF280BY over different stages of testis development
(4~20-day, 3-month, 8-month and >24-month) by qRTPCR indicated the expression of ZNF280BY sense RNA
increased significantly with age (p < 0.05). In contrast,
ZNF280BY antisense RNA expression was stable during
testis development (Figure 7). It is noteworthy that
expression between qRT-PCR replicates for the same
individual at each stage (technical replicates) were highly
consistent, whereas the levels between different individuals (3 biological replicates) varied, resulting in relatively high standard deviations (Figure 7).
To address the question of whether different loci of the
ZNF280BY families on BTAY are differentially expressed,
we counted the number of read-pairs unique to a given
locus (read-pairs that are shared by two or more loci
were not counted). As shown in Figure 3A, different loci
of ZNF280BY are differentially expressed with as much
as 60-fold changes. Similar analysis to the different copies
of the ZNF280AY pseudogenes on BTAY indicated that
their expression also varied as much as 10-fold (Figure
3B). However, the expression level of the ZNF280AY
pseudogenes is much lower (one-sixth) compared to the
ZNF280BY genes (Figure 3), which is consistent with the
RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1).

Discussion
Autosome to Y-chr transposition

Autosome-to-Y transposition of male fertility genes is a
recurrent theme in mammalian Y-chr evolution [48]. As
a result, the content of male-beneficial genes in MSY
has increased in spite of a 95% loss of the ancestral
Y-chr genes due to the absence of recombination. Autosome-to-Y transposition events apparently occurred
separately in different lineages with newly acquired
Y-chr genes from diverse genomic locations [20]. This
resulted in lineage-specific Y-chr genes (families) that
account for a significant portion of the gene (and
sequence) variation among mammalian Y-chrs. The
human DAZ gene family was derived from the transposition of the autosomal DAZL that maps to the subtelomeric region on HSA3p24.3 [48], while CDY arrived
on the human Y-chr through retrotransposition of
CDYL on HSA6 [4,49] during primate evolution. The
mouse Ssty1 was derived from a retroposition of an
autosomal gene Spin1 on MMU13 [18]. The feline
FLJ36031and TETY1 gene families originated through

autosome-to-Y transposition before and after the divergence of cats and dogs, respectively [20].
In addition to autosome-to-Y transpositions, a massive
X-to-Y sequence transposition has also been observed in
humans, which occurred after the human and chimpanzee
divergence (~3-4 Mya) and resulted in an X-transposed
sequence block on the Y that contains two single-copy
genes, TGIF2LY and PCDH11Y [4]. This block of the
Y-chr sequence still shares a high similarity with the
X-counterpart (~99%) though it does not recombine during meiosis [4].
We identified two novel Y-chr gene families,
ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY, which are present on both
bovine and ovine Y-chrs, but not on non-bovid Y-chrs
investigated to date. We propose that the ZNF280BY/
AY gene families are lineage-specific in Bovidae. Phylogenetic analysis of the ZNF280B/BY and ZNF280A/AY
family (Figure 5) strongly support that the bovine
ZNF280BY/AY originated from the autosomal genes,
ZNF280B/A, on BTA17. Unlike the human DAZ and

feline TETY1 and FLJ36031 genes, where a single autosomal gene is involved in the transposition, the bovine
ZNF280B/A transposed to the Y-chr as a block. This
autosomal block is located in the sub-telomeric region
that could be a hotspot for segmental duplication [50].
ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY amplification and the “birth-anddeath” evolution

The distribution pattern and differences in copy number
suggest that ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY was differentially
amplified on BTAY after transposition. We identified
136 active ZNF280BY and 241 pseudogenes from
BTAY-BACs, and estimated that the oldest active
ZNF280BY locus emerged via a duplication event ~5.7
Mya. This is significantly later than the estimated divergence time of 19.6 Mya between cattle and sheep [47].
The results lead us to believe that the progressive amplification of the bovine ZNF280BY follows the “birthand-death” model of evolution [51]. Based on this
model, new ZNF280BY loci were created by repeated

The occurrence of palindrome-like IRs indicates that the
Y-Y gene conversion mechanism may apply to these gene
families. When the criteria for sequence assembly was
lowered from 99.99% to 99.85% identity, and the minimum overlap size between BACs decreased from 30 kb
to 20 kb, we obtained another large contig (~2.2 Mb)
from different Y-BACs displaying similar dot-plot and
repeat pattern as the 1.2 Mb contig (Figure 4). It appears
that the majority of the bovine MSY ampliconic region is
enriched with internally repetitive units containing
ZNF280BY, ZNF280AY, HSFY and TSPY.

Figure 7 Expression of ZNF280BY sense and antisense RNA at
different developmental stages of testis. The relative expression
levels of the ZNF280BY sense and antisense RNA at different ages of
testis (X-axis), measured by the strand-specific qPCR, were
normalized by the 18S rRNA (Y-axis). Values are means ± SD of
triplicates. The expression of sense RNA increased gradually with
age. In contrast, the ZNF280BY antisense RNA had a stable
expression level except for a decrease in 3 month old testis. The
significant expression difference was identified when p ≤ 0.05 by
the ANOVA analysis and denoted by (a,b) where the gene
expression at stages of (b) is significantly different from that at (a).

gene duplication with some duplicated genes maintained
on the BTAY and others lost due to mutation and
degeneration, as active gene copies might cooperate to
increase the efficiency of male fertility and damage to a
few copies would not significantly impact the biological
system [52]. Each of the three active ZNF280BY loci in
the 1.2 Mb region is accompanied by a ZNF280AY
pseudogene (Figure 4). If this is true for all 136 active
ZNF280BY loci, we should expect to identify a minimum of 136 ZNF280AY pseudogenes. Interestingly, the
observed 133 copies of ZNF280AY pseudogenes in this
study are very close to the expected number, but we do
not, as yet, know whether co-amplification of the
ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY or the loss of the ZNF280AY in
the gene pair has any role in the activity of ZNF280BY.
A significant feature of the human MSY is the eight
palindromes (24 kb to 2.9 Mb) with arm-to-arm
sequence identities ≥99.94% [4,53]. Y-to-Y gene conversion between the paired-genes on each arm occurs frequently in humans, constraining sequence divergence
and maintaining the critical functions of the MSY genes
[4,53]. Pairwise comparisons of all available BTAY-BACs
and the assembly of a 1.2 Mb ampliconic region located
in MSY revealed several palindrome-like inverted repeats
with an arm-to-arm identity of 99.85% (Figure 4).

One of the most important features of mammalian
Y-chrs is the multi-copy gene families that are exclusively expressed in testis and play essential roles in spermatogenesis and male fertility. The largest Y-gene
family reported to date is TSPY, which is conserved on
most of the mammalian Y-chrs. The human Y-chr harbors 20-70 copies of TSPY [4,54], while the bovine
Y-chr has 50-200 copies [55-57]. Unlike the human
TSPYs that are clustered as a tandem array in a narrow
region (~700 kb) on Yp [4], the bovine TSPYs spread
over the majority of the MSY ampliconic region. Recent
studies in TSPY copy number variation (CNV) has indicated that CNV significantly influenced spermatogenic
efficiency in men [58,59]. However, efforts to study the
expression profile of the multi-copy Y-chr genes have
been impeded because of the high similarity (95-100%)
among different copies (loci). In this work, we have successfully applied the deep sequencing technology to analyze the locus-specific expression of the ZNF280BY and
ZNF280AY gene families. We believe that there are two
important advantages with the deep sequencing
approach. First, by counting the perfectly matched read
pairs, one can directly evaluate the expression level of
any given locus (except for those loci that are 100%
identical). Second, one can also compare the average
expression level among gene families or individuals (biological replicates) based on read counts. We expect that
the combination of CNV and locus-specific expression
analyses on these Y-gene families, including ZNF280BY,
ZNF280AY, HSFY, and TSPY, will help us to understand
how multi-copy gene families regulate and function during spermatogenesis.
Potential function in spermatogenesis

Although zinc finger proteins are among the most abundant and functionally diverse in mammalian genomes
[60], little is known of the functions of ZNF280B
(SUHW2) in mammals. The Drosophila ortholog, suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)], is a transcriptional regulator. The Su(Hw) protein has been found to bind an

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/13

insulator element within a gypsy retrotransposon to
mediate enhancer-blocking of gypsy towards target
genes [61,62]. The conserved syntenic block ZNF280BZNF280A on HSA22 is located within the lambda light
chain loci and is reportedly associated with immune
responsiveness [63,64].
The discovery of the autosome-to-Y transposition and
subsequent amplification of the ZNF280BY-ZNF280AY
gene block on BTAY led us to suggest that the two gene
families may play an essential role in spermatogenesis.
A comparable example is the Ssty1 gene family in mice
which is significantly amplified (>100 copies) after retroposing to the Y-chr and is expressed specifically in spermatids with a function in sperm differentiation [65,66].
As expected, we found that the bovine ZNF280BY family
predominantly and ZNF280B specifically expressed in
testes (Figure 1). The significant age related elevation of
ZNF280BY levels (Figure 7) may be associated with the
maturation of the bovine testes and cell proliferation
throughout spermatogenesis. Antisense RNA may play a
role in regulating the expression of ZNF280BY during
spermatogenesis (Figure 6A &6B). The antisense transcripts of ZNF280BY were over-expressed relative to
sense transcripts in testes ≤3 months of age (Figure 7).
This observation is in contrast to a previous report that
found lower antisense versus sense transcript levels in
genes expressed in germ cells [67]. The antisense RNAs
of the three Y-related and testis-expressed genes in cattle,
including ZNF280BY, DDX3Y and CDYL, all appear to be
expressed in the late stage of spermatocytes and/or spermatids, indicating that antisense RNA is important in
regulating bovine spermatogenesis [34,68].

were pooled, treated twice (before and after mRNA purification) with the DNase I (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA)
and messenger RNA was purified from the pooled total
RNA (Oligotex; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). First strand
cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers and oligoT primers and SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and blunt-ended double-stranded cDNA was developed as described [69].
Adaptors, which are annealed phosphorylated oligonucleotides 1 (5’-CTGAGCGGAATTCGTGAGACC-3’)
and 2 (5’-CCAGAGTGCTTAAGGCGAGTCAA-3’)
(IDT, Coralville, IOWA, USA), were attached to cDNA
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA,
USA) [42]. Adaptor-ligated cDNA products were used
for direct testis cDNA selection.
Y-chr DNA probe labeling

Fragments of BTAY DNA were isolated by a microdissection approach [70], and were labeled with biotin16-dUTP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) using nick
translation (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following a
method described by Del Mastro and Lovett [42].

DNase I, 60 ng whole chromosome amplified (WCA) Y
fragments, biotin-16-dUTP 0.2 nmol, dNTPs 4 nmol,

P-dCTP (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA) 10 μCi, was incubated in 15°C water bath for
90 min. The biotinylated products were purified through
a Probquant G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and labeling efficiency was determined
by incorporation of 32P-dCTP as described [42].
Direct testis cDNA selection and sequencing

Conclusions
The identification of lineage-specific Y genes recapitulates the diversity of Y gene content and signifies the
importance of comparative studies of the mammalian
Y-chr. This study provides a base for further research
on Y-chr evolution and male-fertility. As the expression
of the bovine ZNF280B/ZNF280BY and ZNF280A/
ZNF280AY is predominant in the testis, their autosomal
orthologs in other eutherians may play roles in spermatogenesis. We believe that additional functional analysis
of ZNF280B/ZNF280BY and ZNF280A/ZNF280AY will
offer insights into gene regulation in spermatogenesis,
the evolution of the mammalian Y-chr and advance the
assembly of the bovine Y-chr sequence.
Methods
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from bovine testicular tissue at
4 days, 20 days, 3 months, 8 months and ≥2 years of age
with Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Equal amounts of total RNA from different age groups

Direct testis cDNA selection was carried out as
described [42]. After a pre-hybridization step with
bovine Cot-1 DNA (Applied Genetics Laboratories, Melbourne, FL, USA) to block the repetitive elements, the
adaptor-ligated cDNA was hybridized with the biotinylated BTAY probe for 50 hr in 0.75 mM NaCl, 20 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5 mM EDTA, 5× Denhardt’s solution and 0.1% SDS. Hybridized cDNA was
isolated with streptavidin paramagnetic Dynabeads
M-280 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing twice with wash
solution I (1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature to remove the unbound cDNAs, and washing
with wash solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) 4 times,
20 min each at 65°C to remove the non-specifically
bound cDNAs, the selected cDNA was eluted from the
beads by 1 × SSC at 95°C for 5 min, and then amplified
by PCR with the adaptor oligo 1 as the primer. Selection
efficiency was assessed by qPCR with Y-linked genes,
SRY and DDX3Y, as positive controls and, b-Actin and
CDYL, as negative controls. PCR products were cloned

Yang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:13
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/13

using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). A total of 2,208 random clones were grown overnight at 37°C in 2 ml, 96-deep-well culture plates. Dotblotting the clones with BTAY fragments yielded 753
(most likely) non-redundant clones. Plasmid DNA was
purified by alkaline lysis (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA),
and sequenced on an ABI-3730XL DNA analyzer at the
Pennsylvania State University Genomics Core Facility.
RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from eight different tissues
(including testis, liver, kidney, spleen, cerebellum, adrenal
gland, longissimus muscle, and lymph node) of a two
years old bull and ovarian tissue from a mature cow, treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and reverse
transcribed using SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RT-PCR was
performed with gene-specific primers (GSPs) (Additional
file 7) in a 20 μl volume containing 10 ng cDNA, 200 μM
dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 μM of each primer and 1
unit Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline, Taunton, MA, USA).
The PCR conditions were: 94°C for 7 min followed by 35
cycles each of 95°C for 40 sec, 55-65°C for 40 sec, 72°C
for 40 sec, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels with ethidium
bromide in 1 × TAE buffer.
RACE

Total RNAs from bovine testis (4 d, 20 d, 3 m, 8 m, and
2 years of age) were used for 5’ and 3’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The RACE cDNA template
was synthesized using the ExactSTART Eukaryotic
mRNA 5’- & 3’-RACE kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
amplified by PCR with kit supplied primers 1 and 2.
The 5’-end of ZNF280BY was amplified by a nested
PCR with Primer 1 and GSPs (Additional file 7). PCR
was performed in 20 μl with 10 ng of cDNA (or 1 μl of
the first PCR products), 0.25 μM of both primers, 200
μM of each dNTP, 2.25 mM MgCl2, 0.6 U of hot-start
DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) under
the following cycling conditions: 15 min at 95°C; 35
cycles of 40 sec at 95°C, 40 sec at the annealing temperature (Additional file 7), 1 min at 72°C; and a final
extension of 7 min at 72°C. The PCR products were
electrophoretically separated in 1.5% agarose, purified
with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) and sequenced using GSP primers.
In situ hybridization (ISH)

The bovine testis was fixed [71], embedded in paraffin
and sectioned (4 μM). Sense and antisense RNA of
ZNF280BY were selected (Additional file 8) using
G-PROBE software (Genetyx Co. Tokyo, Japan). The

Page 11 of 15

selected 120 bp probes were subjected to in vitro transcription to produce digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA
with the AmpliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). Uniform labeling of DIGlabeling was confirmed using the NBT/BCIP detection
system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). ISH
[72] was modified by hybridizing in 50% formamide, 2 ×
SSC, 1.0 mg/ml tRNA, 1.0 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA,
1.0 mg/ml BSA, 1.0% SDS and 3.0 μg/ml DIG-labeled
RNA probe at 42°C for 26-64 hr. Serial tissue sections
were used for antisense and sense probe hybridizations.
The spermatid-specific genes Protamine 1 (PRM1) and
LNE120 served as positive and negative controls.
Strand-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR)

First strand sense and antisense cDNAs were synthesized with strand-specific primers (Additional file 7)
(SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the bovine testis total
RNA (4-20 d, 3 m, 8 m and ≥2 years) as templates,
which were then used for the real-time qPCR. All
qPCRs were performed in Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR system following the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification conditions were 2 min at 50°C; 10 min at 95°C; followed by
40 cycles of 20 sec at 95°C, 20 sec at 57°C and 30 sec at
72°C. Cycle threshold (CT) acquisition used default
parameters with CT values for ZNF280BY sense/antisense RNAs normalized to 18S rRNA in each sample.
RNA samples without reverse transcript served as the
negative control. Each qPCR was conducted in duplicate
on 3 independent RNA (age) samples (replicates). Significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA using SAS
(SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA).
Short-read sequencing for locus-specific expression

The selected cDNAs were subjected to mechanical fragmentation by nebulization (compressed air at 32-35 psi
for 6 min on ice). All enzymes used for sequencing were
obtained from Illumina, Inc. The resulting doublestranded (ds) overhang fragments were end-repaired by
incubation in the presence of T4 DNA polymerase and
Klenow polymerase. The polished fragments were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by the
addition of a single ‘A’ base to the 3’ end of the bluntended phosphorylated fragments. This ‘A’ base prepared
the DNA fragments for ligation to adapter oligonucleotides (Illumina paired-read adapters), which have an
overhanging ‘T’ base at their 3’ end. Ligation products
were size-selected by gel electrophoresis and purification
(2% low-range agarose with ethidium bromide). Following 1-2 hr at 80-110 V (room temperature), the library
range was visualized under brief UV and the desired

size (200-300 bp) was excised. Purified DNA libraries
were subjected to a final PCR amplification step (15
cycles). PCR conditions were an initial 30 sec 98°C denaturation, followed by 15 cycles of: 40 sec at 98°C, 30 sec at
65°C, 30 sec at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C and a final
hold at 4°C. Amplified libraries were quantitatively and
qualitatively assessed by Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo
Scientific, DE, USA) UV/Vis spectroscopy and DNA BioAnalyzer 2100 microfluidics (Agilent, CA, USA).
A total of 6,710,574 high-quality paired-end reads of
2 × 36 bp were generated using Illumina GAIIx from
the selected cDNA. These reads were aligned to the
unique ZNF280BY and ZNF280AY sequences identified
through BlastClust with 100% similarity and 100% coverage as the criteria. For aligning the short-reads, the
software GSNAP [73] was used as part of the Alpheus
pipeline [74]. Two mismatches were allowed during
the alignment step and only the reads that hit the
reference uniquely were considered for counting
towards locus-specific expression. Since the reads were
paired-end, only the reads where both ends hit the
same reference were considered. These counts were
further sub-grouped under three categories: (A) both
reads unique hits with 2 mismatches, (B) both reads
unique hits with at least one of them being exact
match and (C) both reads unique hits & both exact
matches. The read counts in these three categories
were considered a measure of expression pertaining to
the specific locus.
The count values were then normalized by the transcript length ratio and number of unique sites:

Sequence alignment, gene prediction and phylogenetic
tree construction

The ZNF280BY (NM_001078120) sequence was Blasted
against the annotated Y-BAC pool in NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to detect potential homologous
regions on BTAY. The SIM4 program [75] was used to
compare RACE and RT-PCR results with identified Y
homologous regions to determine the homologs with
similar intron/exon structures and consensus (GT-AG)
splice sites. BlastClust (NCBI package) was used to cluster the retrieved homologs. Open reading frames of
these homologs were then predicted with the GETORF
program in EMBOSS [76]. Pseudogenes were distinguished from genes on the basis of premature stop
codons or frameshifts.
Ks values were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori
method (Jukes-Cantor correction) in MEGA4 [77,78].
All positions containing alignment gaps and missing

data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). Phylogenetic trees
(Additional file 5) were constructed using the NJ and
ML methods [77]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
method [79].
Y-chr sequence assembly

Sequencher 4.8 (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI) was used
to assemble the BTAY contigs. A cutoff threshold of
≥99.99% sequence identity between overlapped BACs
with ≥30 kb overlapped regions ensure a high quality
assembly of the 1.2 Mb contig (Figure 4, Additional file
4). The 2.2 Mb contig was assembled under a sequence
cutoff threshold set at ≥99.85% identity with ≥20 kb
overlapped regions. Repeat elements were identified by
RepeatMasker [80]. The dot-plot was produced by
Gepard with a word size of 10 nucleotides [81]. Several
purpose-designed scripts were coded to visualize the
assembly, marker labeling and incorporate the Blast [82]
and EMBOSS [76] programs.
