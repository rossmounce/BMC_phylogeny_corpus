Background

Results

According to the general biological theory the development and evolution of humans into complete bio-psychosocial beings are realized through continuous morphological and functional adjustment processes. The basic goals
of these processes are (a) survival in all the different types
of environment that the individual is confronted with,
and (b) assurance of the continuation of the species via
the succession of its generations. In this evolutionary biological theory and in agreement with the value of observing behaviours lie also the roots of ethology.

Many interesting results highlight the importance of
ethology and evolutionary biology to medicine as far as
their special relevance to neurosciences is concerned. Primary examples are the studies of imprinting in newly
hatched goslings and the practical function of aggression
such as the defense of their territory by fish and birds by
Konrad Lorenz. Tinbergen's discovery of so-called displacement activities and Von Frisce's analyses of how bees
communicate with each other represent other key contributions. Animal models, such as the panic of some monkeys that have never been exposed previously to snakes
when placed in the presence of a snake, have also been
used in the study of phobic responses. Moreover, certain
human neuro-endocrine mechanisms such as the pathological substrate in insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes and
the sodium-sensitive type of hypertension can be
approached under a different scope in the framework of
evolutionary biology.

Materials and methods
Ethology mainly studies the behaviour of animals in their
natural settings, trying to describe which behavioural
traits are inherited and which are acquired as time passes
and experiences are earned. By using non-experimental,
observational techniques ethologists try to approach both
nonverbal and verbal behavioural patterns, as well as the
communicative aspects of each. Their study is based on
the comparative method and phylogenetic assumptions.
Moreover, new scientific subsections like neuroethology,
which is particularly interested in the neural basis of naturally occurring animal behaviour and socio-biology have
evolved. In a similar manner, evolutionary biology studies
human behaviour by concentrating on the transmission
and modification of genetically influenced behavioural
traits and the mechanisms regulating these traits: development, function and the environment.

Discussion
Evolutionary studies of human behaviour prove that a
more accurate knowledge of behaviour and the needs
shaped by natural selection can significantly reduce mental suffering and improve psychological well-being.
Because of the influence of genetic information on traits,
humans, like other species, enter the world predisposed to
process and interpret information in species-typical ways,
to engage in certain behaviours and to achieve specific
goals. Genetic influences may also play a role in the development of phobias, since some human phobic responses
may represent exaggerations of adaptive behaviours

formed by evolutionary biology. Through evolutionary
biology, human behavioural characteristics and also basic
neuro-endocrine mechanisms can be investigated from a
different angle allowing a more thorough understanding
of the phylogenetic evolution of all organisms.
