Abstract
Background: Metazoan mitochondrial genomes usually consist of the same 37 genes. Such genes
contain useful information for phylogenetic analyses and evolution modelling. Although complete
mitochondrial genomes have been determined for over 1,000 animals to date, hydrothermal vent
species have, thus far, remained excluded due to the scarcity of collected specimens.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of the hydrothermal vent galatheid crab Shinkaia crosnieri is
15,182 bp in length, and is composed of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and
only 18 transfer RNA genes. The total AT content of the genome, as is typical for decapods, is
72.9%. We identified a non-coding control region of 327 bp according to its location and ATrichness. This is the smallest control region discovered in crustaceans so far. A mechanism of
cytoplasmic tRNA import was addressed to compensate for the four missing tRNAs. The S. crosnieri
mitogenome exhibits a novel arrangement of mitochondrial genes. We investigated the
mitochondrial gene orders and found that at least six rearrangements from the ancestral
pancrustacean (crustacean + hexapod) pattern have happened successively. The codon usage,
nucleotide composition and bias show no substantial difference with other decapods. Phylogenetic
analyses using the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding
genes prove consistent with the previous classification based upon their morphology.
Conclusion: The present study will supply considerable data of use for both genomic and
evolutionary research on hydrothermal vent ecosystems. The mitochondrial genetic characteristics
of decapods are sustained in this case of S. crosnieri despite the absence of several tRNAs and a
number of dramatic rearrangements. Our results may provide evidence for the immigrating
hypothesis about how vent species originate.

Background
Since intraorganellar DNA characteristics were found in
chick embryo mitochondria [1,2], determination of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) has become an
important part of genome research. In 1981, Anderson et
al reported the complete sequence of the human mitogenome [3]. This was the first identified organellar genome.
Until recently, 1,212 metazoan mitogenomes have now
been determined (NCBI Organelle Genome Resource
[4]). With a few exceptions [5-9], animal mitogenomes
always consist of the same 37 genes which incorporate 13
subunits of proteins involved in the respiratory chain and
oxidative phosphorylation, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs),
and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (reviewed in [10]). These
sequences can provide large datasets for phylogenetic
analyses at different levels also serving as ideal models of
gene rearrangement and genome evolution.
152 arthropod mitogenomes have been determined since
Clary and Wolstenholme sequenced that of Drosophila
yakuba in 1985 [11]. Within the subphylum Crustacea,
only 36 mitogenomes have been determined: one for each
of the classes Cephalocarida, Ostracoda, Pentastomida
and Remipedia, four for the Branchiopoda, eight for the
Maxillopoda and 20 for the Malacostraca (including 14
decapods, see Table 1). Within the order Decapoda, the
sampling is imbalanced: four for the suborder Dendrobranchiata and ten for the Pleocyemata (five for the
infraorder Brachyura, two for the Caridea, and one for
each of the Anomura, Astacidea and Palinura). Most decapod mitogenomes share the ancestral pancrustacean
(crustacean + hexapod) gene order that shows only a trnLUUR translocation from the ancestral arthropod arrangement depicted by the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus
[12], or present only minor tRNA translocations. So far
the anomuran mitogenome of the hermit crab Pagurus
longicarpus has been determined to show dramatic gene
rearrangements, including that of several large fragments
[13].
Hydrothermal vents were first discovered along the
Galápagos Rift in 1977 [14]. Up to the present, their presence has been noted at mid-ocean spreading centers in the
east Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic and Indian Oceans, and in the
back-arc basins in the west Pacific (reviewed in [15]).
These vent environments are considered as extreme given
the high pressure, the high temperature (up to 390°C),
the chemical toxicity of the fluids (H2S, CH4 and various
heavy metals), and the total lack of photosynthetic production of animal nutrition. Nevertheless, with the exception of chemoautotrophic bacteria that oxidize hydrogen
sulfide emitted from vents, surprisingly a number of specialized large faunas were also observed in these vents.
Many invertebrates (e.g. vestimentiferan tube worms,
vesicomyid and bathymodiolin bivalves, provannid gas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/257

tropods, bythograeid and galatheid crabs, and bresiliid
shrimps) often thrive with dramatically high densities, by
utilizing (epi- or endo-)symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria or grazing on or filter feeding upon free-living chemoautotrophs [15]. There are two main hypotheses about
how vent faunas originate. The relic hypothesis derives
principally from morphological analyses of extant vent
taxa [16,17], which considers the hydrothermal vent as a
refugium for relic faunas during major historical extinction events. However, molecular studies of several ventdominant taxa suggest that modern vent animals arose
relatively recently [18]. An immigrating hypothesis seems
more reasonable, which speculates that vent species may
immigrate either from the non-vent environments or with
close shallow-water relatives (reviewed in [15]).
Thanks to the effective Crustacea-specific versatile primers
[19,20], mitochondrial DNA fragments can be used for
studying the occurrence and dispersal of these vent species
[21,22]. However, no entire mitogenome data has been
available for any vent species to date. Baba and Williams
first identified Shinkaia crosnieri at the Bismarck Archipelago and in the Okinawa Trough in the west Pacific Ocean
[23]. The discoverers placed it into Decapoda: Anomura:
Galatheidae according to its morphological features.
Chan et al also mentioned this species as the first known
hydrothermal crustacean in Taiwan [24]. Gathering near
the top of the vents, S. crosnieri probably feed on polychaetes and "culture" filamentous bacteria on their abdominal surface [25]. No genetic data has been characterized
for this species so far.
Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the
S. crosnieri mitogenome. It consists of the same 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNAs but only 18 tRNAs, with
trnS-UCN, trnW, trnC and trnY missing from the usual
structure. A mechanism of nuclear DNA-encoded tRNA
import was addressed. Furthermore, the genes show surprising rearrangements from the ancestral pancrustacean
order. Phylogenetic analyses indicate its close relationship
with P. longicapus. No significant difference was found in
the codon usage, nucleotide composition and bias. Our
results may provide useful information on both genomics
and the evolution of hydrothermal vent faunas.

Results and Discussion
Mitogenome organization
The mitochondrial genome of the hydrothermal vent
galatheid crab Shinkaia crosnieri is a 15,182-bp circular
molecule (Figure 1). It is the smallest mitogenome found
in the Malacostraca (15,289 [26] to 18,197 [27]) to date.
The genome contains the same 13 protein-coding genes
and two ribosomal RNAs as in most metazoans. However,
it exhibits incomplete transfer RNA encoding (18 instead
of the usual 22, see below). 22 mitochondrial genes are

transcribed from one strand (the plus strand) and the
remaining 11 from the other (the minus strand). Totally
740 non-coding nucleotides exist intergenically, with the
largest continuous region (327 bp, AT% = 83.5) between
trnQ and rrnS. Due to its location and AT-richness, we
considered this part of the genome as a non-coding control region in the similar manner as in the case of the Australian freshwater crayfish Cherax destructor [28].
However, the control region is considerably smaller than
those of any other decapods (Table 1) and shows no similarities with any previous decapod control region (data
not shown). In the case of Pagurus longicarpus [13],
approximately 300 bp of the control region remain unsequenced due to technical difficulties. Furthermore, as
found in many mitogenomes, some genes overlap. atp8/
atp6 and nad4L/nad4 each share seven nucleotides,
although they are located on different reading frames. No
further overlap of over two nucleotides was identified.
Table 2 shows a summary of the S. crosnieri mitogenome
organization.
Protein-coding genes and ribosomal RNAs
For the protein-coding genes, nine (atp8, atp6, cob, cox1—
3, nad2—3 and nad6) are encoded in the plus strand while
the remaining four (nad1, nad4–5 and nad4L) in the
minus strand (Figure 1; Table 2). This orientation is
shared by all decapod mitogenomes sequenced to date. 12
out of the 13 protein-coding genes appear to start with the

codon ATN (Table 2), typical for metazoan mitogenomes
[29]. The cox1 initiates with GTT, in a case identical to
Neocalanus cristatus [30]. Eight genes possess TAA as their
termination codons (Table 2). Truncated termination
codons (TA or T) are observed in cox1—2, nad4—5 and
cob. Post-transcriptional polyadenylation can subsequently generate mature TAA codons [31].
The rrnL and rrnS genes of S. crosnieri are 1,331 (AT% =
77.8) and 811 bp (AT% = 78.1) in length, respectively.
The lengths are among values typical for crustaceans
whereas the AT contents are slightly higher than those of
other decapod counterparts (Table 1).
Transfer RNAs
We analyzed the entire sequences of the genome and successfully identified 18 tRNA genes by their potential secondary structures (Figure 2). tRNAscan-SE determined 17
of them. The only manually folded trnS-AGN exhibits
three mismatches on the acceptor stem while its DHU,
TΨC and anticodon stems appear intact and well paired.
The TΨC arm of trnS-AGN is often extremely short or
completely missing in arthropods [32-35]. Besides trnSAGN, each of trnI, trnK and trnL-CUN bears a mismatch
on the acceptor stem. Usually tRNAs with a U in the wobble position (the first position) of the anticodons recognize either four-fold degenerate or NNR codons; those
with a G in this position only recognize NNY codons. All

instead of the usual GUC [39]. They found that the cytosine is changed to uridine under a post-transcriptional
RNA editing. Dorner et al discovered a trnK pseudogene in
the same marsupial species by observing its non-functional secondary structure [40]. Cytoplasmic tRNA import
rather than RNA editing solves this problem. In our study,
there seems no candidate template for RNA editing. The
mechanism of tRNA import is therefore a plausible explanation.

Figure 1
The mitochondrial genome of Shinkaia crosnieri
The mitochondrial genome of Shinkaia crosnieri. Protein-coding genes, ribosomal and transfer RNA genes are
presented as the Abbreviations section. The genes outside
the circle are transcribed clockwise, while the genes inside
are transcribed counterclockwise. Gene blocks are filled with
different colors as the cutline shows. The inner ring indicates
the GC content of the genome. The figure was initially generated with OGDRAW and modified manually.

tRNAs of S. crosnieri mitogenome obey this rule except for
trnM, whose anticodon CAU recognizes both ATG and
ATA. The C can be post-transcriptionally modified to 5formylcytidine to pair with the ATA codon [36].
trnS-UCN, trnW, trnC and trnY are missing from the S.
crosnieri mitogenome. We analyzed all fractions between
protein-coding or ribosomal RNA genes [see Additional
file 1], but no extra tRNAs or similar sequences were identified in the genome. This is not an exception in arthropods considering the absence of trnQ in the mitogenome
of the whitefly Aleurodicus dugesii, trnS-AGN in the aphid
Schizaphis graminum [37], and trnD in the scorpion Centruroides limpidus [7]. Deficiencies of tRNA genes were often
observed in protozoans, fungi, algae, plants and low
metazoans (reviewed in [38]). In these cases, the mechanism of nuclear DNA-encoded tRNA import proves
responsible for mitochondrial tRNA compensation. Furthermore, marsupial mitochondrial tRNAs show interesting patterns. Janke and Paabo identified a pseudogenelike trnD in Didelphis virginiana, as its anticodon is GCC

Nucleotide composition and codon usage
The nucleotide composition of S. crosnieri mitogenome is
as follows: A = 5,452 (35.9%), G = 1,415 (9.3%), T =
5,612 (37.0%) and C = 2,703 (17.8%). The genome has
an overall AT content of 72.9%, which appears high for
decapods (62.3–74.9%), but is a little lower than that of
Geothelphusa dehaani [27]. The composition is strongly
skewed away from G in favor of C (the GC-skew is -0.313)
while almost balanced for A and T (the AT-skew is -0.014).
This feature is well conserved within decapods (Table 1).
In mammals, the duration of single-stranded state of the
"heavy-stranded" genes during mitochondrial DNA replication can explain this asymmetry [41]. Whether or not
the same explanation works on our results remains difficult to predict at this time due to the scarcity of information regarding DNA replication of invertebrate
mitochondria.

The S. crosnieri mitogenome totally encodes 3,698 amino
acids of protein-coding genes. Table 3 shows the codon
usage. Although four tRNAs are absent, the corresponding
codons 235 TCNs, 95 TGRs, 42 TGYs and 146 TAYs (for
trnS-UCN, trnW, trnC and trnY, respectively) are used
quite frequently (14% of total codons), evidently raising
the need for tRNA compensation. We observed a strong
AT-bias (AT% = 82.3) in the third codon positions, similar
to those in the Anomura relative P. longicarpus, the Brachyura and the suborder Dendrobranchiata (73.9–84.0%).
The values in the Caridea, Palinura and Astacidea are relatively lower (59.6–66.8%).
Gene rearrangements
The S. crosnieri mitogenome shows a novel arrangement
within arthropods. The gene order diverges in many positions from that of the ancestral pancrustacean pattern
shared by lots of crustaceans and hexapods [42]. Totally,
we identified at least six rearrangements in this species
(Figure 3). Two rearrangements involve protein-coding
genes while the remainders are tRNA translocations. A
major fragment containing nad1, trnL-CUN, rrnL, trnV,
rrnS, control region and trnQ moves to upstream of nad3
from its ancestral position; trnI may translocate before or
after this event. The fraction trnM-nad2 moves to
upstream of trnD. This event, together with the trnG translocations, indicates potential synapomorphic characters

for the Anomura. The location of trnR-trnN changes to
downstream of cox3. The trnP moves to downstream of
nad1. P. longicarpus [13] and Eriocheir sinesis [43] share this
rearrangement. Finally, the trnI moves to the middle of
nad3 and trnA. This translocation is novel within crustaceans. Rearrangements of trnI were observed in Speleonectes tulumensis [44] and Tigriopus japonicus [45], where
trnI is translocated to different positions in both species.
Morrison et al inferred parsimonious rearrangements of
the crab-like form [46]. They pointed out that the Galatheoidea diverged after the translocations of trnQ and trnItrnM-nad2. Our results support their hypothesis.
We also analyzed data gathered thus far on rearrangements of both decapod (Figure 4) and all pancrustacean
mitogenomes (Figure 5). For simplicity of analysis, all
tRNAs and control regions (CRs) were excluded in the
case of the pancrustaceans. The E. sinensis mitogenome

shows the maximum 7 block interchanges within the
Decapoda, and Shinkaia crosnieri exhibits 6 interchanges
from the ancestral pancrustacean arrangement on its
mitogenome (Figure 4). The ancestral pancrustacean pattern depicted by four dendrobranchiatans, two carideans
and one palinuran, has only a trnL-UUR translocation
from the ancestral arthropod order of Limulus polyphemus
[12]. In the analyses of large block (protein-coding genes
plus rRNAs) rearrangements of all pancrustaceans, the
class Maxillopoda shows maximum inversions (3–7)
within crustaceans. In the case of the Hexapoda (81
mitogenomes determined to date), all large block rearrangements have happened within the class Insecta (Figure 5), where more rearrangements (both translocations
and inversions) were observed within the orders
Phthiraptera and Thysanoptera.

Figure secondary structures for the 18 transfer RNAs of the Shinkaia crosnieri mitogenome
Putative secondary structures for the 18 transfer RNAs of the Shinkaia crosnieri mitogenome. 17 structures were
generated by tRNAscan-SE and the rest trnS-AGN was folded manually. CG, AU and GU bonds are denoted by red, blue and
green colors, respectively. The lowercase triplets indicate anticodons.

Phylogenetic analysis
We used both nucleotide and amino acid sequences of
protein-coding genes for the intraorder phylogenetic analyses. For each dataset, the maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian analysis gave the same tree topology (Figure 6)
while the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of the
nucleotides showed a minor difference (Figure 6A). The

nucleotide and amino acid trees are nearly the same
except for the position of the Caridea clade (Halocaridina
rubra + Macrobrachium rosenbergii) and the inner structure
of the Dendrobranchiata clade. In the case of the nucleotides, the clade is placed together with other pleocyematans (Figure 6A), but not well supported (MP/ML/BPP =
<50/60/0.59). However, in the amino acid tree, the Cari-

dea shows a sister position of the Dendrobranchiata (Figure 6B), which also remains modestly statistically
supported (MP/ML/BPP = 61/70/0.80). Therefore,
according to our results, whether the Pleocyemata is
monophyletic or paraphyletic appears ambiguous. The
Dendrobranchiata clade was well reconstructed in the ML
and Bayesian analyses of the nucleotide dataset (Figure
6A) but unresolved in the case of the MP analysis of the
nucleotides and in all three analyses of the amino acids
(Figure 6). The relationship (Marsupenaeus + (Litopenaeus
+ (Fenneropenaeus + Penaeus))) is more believable, as discussed in [47]. In both trees, the two anomurans (S. crosnieri and P. longicarpus) form a separate clade, according
with the relationship derived from the morphology [23].
Whether or not the Anomura is monophyletic needs

intensive sampling. In fact, phylogenetic relationships
within this infraorder remain largely unsettled (reviewed
in [48]). Furthermore, no unexpectedly long or short
branch length of S. crosnieri was observed (Figure 6), indicating that the evolutionary acceleration/retardation is
probably not evident for this vent species. Accurate calculation on evolutionary rates needs fossil records that
remain absent for these vent taxa [49].

Conclusion
This is the first determination of the mitochondrial
genome of a hydrothermal vent organism. It not only
enlarges sampling with the Crustcean, but more importantly, provides useful information for understanding the
evolutionary history of vent species.

Figure 3
Gene rearrangements of the Shinkaia crosnieri mitogenome
Gene rearrangements of the Shinkaia crosnieri mitogenome. At least six rearrangements happen between mitogenomes of S. crosnieri and the ancestral pancrustacean pattern: (1) trnG; (2) trnR-trnN; (3) trnP; (4) nad1-trnL-CUN-rrnL-trnV-rrnSCR-trnQ; (5) trnI; and (6) trnM-nad2. All tRNAs are designated by single letters (except L1, L2, S1 and S2 for trnL-CUN, trnL-UUR,
trnS-AGN and trnS-UCN, respectively). Genes encoded on the minus strand are underlined. The putative control regions (CRs)
are shaded.

Figure 4
Gene rearrangements of decapod mitogenomes
Gene rearrangements of decapod mitogenomes. The ancestral pancrustacean pattern is depicted by four dendrobranchiatans, two carideans and one palinuran. All tRNAs are designated by single letters (except L1, L2, S1 and S2 for trnLCUN, trnL-UUR, trnS-AGN and trnS-UCN, respectively). Asterisks indicate rearrangement from the ancestral order. A cross
shows the insertion of a trnL-CUN in Geothelphusa dehaani. Putative control regions (CRs) are shaded. Genes encoded on the
minus strand are underlined. Numbers on the right of each genome specify block interchanges from the ancestral pattern.
Especially, in the mitogenome calculations on G. dehaani and Shinkaia crosnieri, the additional or absent genes were excluded
respectively.

The mitogenome of Shinkaia crosnieri exhibits almost the
same characteristics with those of other metazoans with
the exception of two differences. Firstly, four transfer
RNAs are missing from the mitogenome. The codons recognized by these four tRNAs are frequently used (14%)
for protein encoding. We proposed a mechanism of
nuclear DNA-encoded tRNA import for this compensation. Secondly, the arrangement of the gene contents is
significantly different from those of other pancrustacen
mitogenomes. The changes are complicated and at least
six rearrangements were observed. Some of them are
shared by other crustaceans. However a novel trnI translocation was identified.
The codon usage, nucleotide composition and bias of S.
crosnieri mitogenome are similar with other decapods.
Phylogenetic analysis shows a close relationship with
another anomuran Pagurus longicarpus, supporting for the
taxonomic classification by the morphology [23]. No
trend of evolutionary acceleration or retardation was
observed. An exterior origin may explain these conserved
features found in S. crosnieri. In fact, one galatheid, Muni-

dopsis subsquamosa, seems to be a non-vent species which
can invade vent habitats for at least short periods of time
[50]. Our results may provide some evidence for the
immigrating hypothesis about how hydrothermal vent
species originate.

Methods
Samples and DNA preparation
One specimen of Shinkaia crosnieri was a generous gift
from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). Sampling was done using manipulators and a slurp gun with single or six canisters set on the
ROV Hype-dophin of JAMSTEC on Apr 24, 2005. The
hydrothermal vent galatheid crab was collected at the Jade
Site of the Izena Hole (27°16.307' N, 127°4.884' E, 1,309
m) in the Okinawa Trough.

150 mg of muscle was dissected in 1.2 ml of extraction
buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM EDTA and
0.5% SDS). Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. Samples were digested thoroughly at
55°C. DNA was precipitated from the supernatant by the

DEnad5F/DEnad5R, respectively [see Additional file 2].
The reactions were carried out with 1.25 units of Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega, Madison, USA) and 125 ng of
genomic DNA as templates, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified fragments were cloned
into pUCm-T vectors (Sangon, Shanghai, China) that
were sequenced using the versatile primers M13F/R. After
determination, the partial sequences were used for designing gene-specific primers. To facilitate the subsequent
long PCR [52], we chose candidates with high melting
temperatures. Long PCRs were performed with 1.25 units
of LA Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) following the manufacturer's commendations. For each long
fragment, we used nested primer pairs [see Additional file
2] and a two-step cycle (denaturation and annealing/
extension). Considering the lack of available genome
arrangement data for this species, all primer combinations were attempted. The long fragments were bidirectionally sequenced using a primer-walking strategy. All
amplifications were done on a TGradient thermocycler
(Whatman-Biometra,
Goettingen,
Germany).
All
sequencing was performed with ABI PRISM Big Dye terminator chemistry and analyzed on ABI 3730 automated
sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).

phenol/chloroform method [51] and dissolved in TE
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4] and 1 mM EDTA).
Genome determination
Partial genic fragments of the genes cytochrome oxidase
subunit 1 (cox1), large ribosomal RNA (rrnL) and NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) were amplified using the
primers LCO1490/HCO2198 [19], 16Sar/16Sbr [20], and

Gene annotation and sequence analysis
All sequences were edited using EditSeq version 5.00
(DNAStar, Madison, USA) and Vector NTI version 9.0.0
(InforMax, Frederick, USA). Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes were identified by aligning with other
decapod mitochondrial genomes (Table 1). Borders of
rRNA genes were determined by adjacent genes. Transfer
RNAs were initially detected by tRNAscan-SE version 1.21
[53] while the rest were identified by their potential secondary structures and anticodons. A circular display of S.
crosnieri mitochondrial genome was depicted by
OGDRAW version 1.1 [54] and modified manually. All
annotation information was imported to Sequin version
7.90 (NCBI) in which generated a standard output of submitted data [see Additional file 3]. The nucleotide
sequences are deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under
the accession number EU420129. Codon usage and
nucleotide composition were analyzed with MEGA 4 [55].
Strand skew values were calculated according to the formulae by Perna and Kocher [56].
Rearrangement analysis
Block interchanges are defined as the minimum rearrangements from one genome to another. We used the
ROBIN website [57] for calculating block interchanges of
each mitogenome deviated from the ancestral pancrustacean (crustacean + decapod) arrangement. For decapod
mitogenomes, we used all 37 genes plus the control
region (CR). Considering the complication and inconstancy of their translocations, tRNAs and CR were omitted

from the calculation on all pancrustacean rearrangements.
Inversions were directly identified by gene orientations.
Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, we chose the 14 other decapod
mitochondrial genomes determined to date (Table 1). The
five
stomatopods
Gonodactylus
chiragra
[GenBank:NC_007442], Harpiosquilla harpax [NC_006916],
Lysiosquilla harpax [NC_007443], Squilla empusa
[NC_007444] and Squilla mantis [NC_006081] served as
outgroups. Both nucleotides and amino acids of 13 protein-coding genes were subjected to concatenated alignments using ClustalX version 1.81 [58], with the opening/
extension gap penalties 15/6.66 and 10/0.2, respectively.
For the nucleotides, we omitted the third position of the
codons before the alignment, according to the result of a
saturation analysis [59] by DAMBE version 4.5.57 [60].
Ambiguously aligned proportions of both alignments
were excluded using Gblocks version 0.91b [61] with
default block parameters. The final nucleotide and amino
acid datasets consisted of 7,027 nt and 3,340 aa, respectively.

For the nucleotide dataset MODELTEST version 3.7 [62]
selected the model GTR+G+I for both the likelihood and
Bayesian analyses. ProtTest version 1.4 [63] chose the
model MtArt+G+I for the amino acid dataset. Both selections were done following the Akaike information crite-

rion (AIC) [64]. As MtArt is so recent a model for the
arthropod evolution [65], we could not implement it in
the Bayesian analysis for the amino acids, where we used
the best scoring alternative MtRev+G+I.
Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses with both datasets
were done using a close-neighbor-interchange (CNI) with
search level 1 method implemented in MEGA 4 [55], with
1,000 bootstrap replicates.
We performed maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of
both nucleotide and amino acid alignments using TREEFINDER version of Mar, 2008 [66] under the models
GTR+G+I and MtArt+G+I, respectively. The alpha shape
parameters were estimated from the datasets. The analyses
started from BioNJ trees. Branch statistical supports were
obtained after 100 bootstrap replicates each.
Bayesian analyses of both nucleotide and amino acid
alignments were carried out using MRBAYES version 3.1.2
[67], under the models GTR+G+I and MtRev+G+I (see
above), respectively. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analyses were performed for 1,000,000 generations in two
runs of eight chains each. The Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) of each tree partition was estimated by sampling the trees every 1,000 generations after discarding the
first 10%.
