Abstract
A 7 amino acid deletion in Gag p6 (P6delta7) emerged in Chinese prevalent HIV-1 strain CRF07_BC from different
epidemic regions. It is important to determine whether this mutation could be transmitted and spread. In this
study, HIV-1 Gag sequences from 5 different epidemic regions in China were collected to trace the transmission
linkage and to analyze genetic evolution of P6delta7 strains. The sequence analysis demonstrated that P6delta7 is a
CRF07_BC specific deletion, different P6delta7 strains could be originated from different parental CRF07_BC
recombinants in different epidemic regions, and the transmission of P6delta7 strain has occurred in IDU
populations. This is for the first time to identify the transmission linkage for P6delta7 strains and serves as a wakeup call for further monitoring in the future; In addition, P6delta7 deletion may represent an evolutionary feature
which might exert influence on the fitness of CRF07_BC strain.
Findings
Several studies reported that mutations in HIV-1 Gag p6
played no role or only marginal role in the infection and
the replication of HIV-1 in vitro[1-3]. However, it
remains unknown whether those mutations in p6 could
exert influences on HIV-1 during natural infection and
thereby cause the transmission of those mutated strains.
Recently, a new Gag p6 mutation pattern, 7 amino acid
(aa) deletion in the central region of p6 domain (PIDKELY at amino acid 30-36, designated as P6Δ7),
emerged in CRF07_BC infected individuals in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region of China and has progressively affected nearly 30% CRF07_BC infected population [4]. In addition, P6Δ7 deletion was also identified
in CRF07_BC strains circulating in other epidemic sites
in China mainland and even in Taiwan region [5-9].
Interestingly, though early cross-sectional observation
by Song et al did not observe significant influences of
P6Δ7 mutation on biological properties of CRF07_BC,
prolonged longitudinal follow-up revealed that P6Δ7
deletion might result in the improvement of CRF07_BC
fitness in vivo. First, after P6Δ7 mutation occurs in vivo,

the mutated strain will subsequently replace its parental
strain and become the predominant strain; In contrast,
the reversion from P6Δ7 strain to non-P6Δ7 strain has
never been observed so far; Second, viral loads in P6Δ7
CRF07_BC infected subjects will be more rapidly
increased than that in non-P6Δ7 strain infected individuals (Additional file 1, unpublished data). These data
suggested that P6Δ7 deletion may have important implications for CRF07_BC prevalence.
Since CRF07_BC strain is one of the most prevalent
HIV-1 strains in China [4-9], the appearance of P6Δ7
CRF07_BC strains in different epidemic regions raised
several important concerns. First, does P6Δ7 represent a
feature only in CRF07_BC or also in other BC recombinant forms? Second, is P6Δ7 strain able to transmit and
spread in population? To answer those questions above,
we analyzed Chinese-derived Gag full-length sequences
collected from all publicly accessible databases and
traced the transmission linkage among CRF07_BC P6Δ7
strains which were derived from 4 different provinces
and 1 region in China. Interestingly, P6Δ7 was proved
to be a CRF07_BC specific mutation and could be originated from different CRF07_BC strains; Furthermore,
the mutant strains of P6Δ7 could be transmitted in
population in epidemic regions and thereby may cause a
new prevalence in the future.

33 CRF08_BC, 31 BC URFs (unique recombinant forms), 2
India-C and 5 Thai-B, were collected and analyzed by
neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Interestingly, though CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and other BC recombinants were derived from the same parental strains (ThaiB and India-C), P6Δ7 was only identified in CRF07_BC

(Figure 1). In total, 27 full-length CRF07_BC Gag
sequences were available in HIV database, these sequences
were derived from 4 provinces and 1 region, including 10
from Yunnan, 8 from Liaoning, 6 from Xinjiang, 2 from
Guangxi provinces and 1 from Taiwan region. Among 27
published sequences, 8 (30%) contain P6Δ7 mutation,

which is in accordance with previous report in population
level that this deletion appeared in 30% CRF07_BC recombinant infected subjects from Xinjiang province [4].
To analyze 27 CRF07_BC sequences, the general timereversible model with a proportion of invariant sites and
gamma distribution (GTR+g+R) was selected as the

[10] and subsequently phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by using a maximum likelihood (ML) heuristic
search in PAUPv4.0b10 [11]. Two P6Δ7 sequences
(07LN134 and 07LN136) were clustered in one branch
with high bootstrap (Figure 2), and epidemiological

study demonstrated that they were derived from an IDU
couple in Liaoning province, China. Another cluster of
P6Δ7 sequences was observed for 00CNLN01 and
00CNLN04, and these two sequences were derived from
two IDUs who had shared injection needles during their
intravenous drug usage. For these two clusters, both
Kishino-Hasegawa test and Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
[12,13] showed that the transmission linkage was
accepted by p value > 0.95.
To test the compatibility of the reconstructed evolutionary relationship with the proposed transmission linkage, the ML trees with different tree topologies were
compared by using the Kishino-Hasegawa test and the
Shimodaira-Hasegawa test in Consel [12,13]. As shown
in Figure 3, all tree topologies are compatible with the
hypothetical transmission from 709N to 07LN134 and
07LN136. However, in this case, the original donor may
be varied in the tree depending on possible transmission.
To test compatibility under this circumstance, we tested
any of these topologies against ML tree. The reconstructed maximum-likelihood tree (Figure 4) showed that
all P6Δ7 strains were clustered together with early
CRF07_BC strains (97CNKM007, 97CN001, CNGL179,
and 98CN009), which were not rejected by the KishinoHasegawa test and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test with p
value in the range of 0.05~0.95, indicating those P6Δ7
strains could be originated from early non-deletion BC
recombinant ancestor strain. However, the possibility
that all P6Δ7 strains form one cluster (Figure 5) was
strongly rejected by the Kishino-Hasegawa test and the
Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (p = 0.013), suggesting those
P6Δ7 strains are not derived from the same deletion
ancestor strain. Furthermore, two important observations

should be noticed. First, as the earliest identified
CRF07_BC P6Δ7 isolates, 00CNLN01 and 00CNLN04
had no obvious transmission linkage with other P6Δ7
isolates even in the same epidemic region (Liaoning province); Second, Yunnan province was considered as BC
recombinant originated region [6,8,9], however, P6Δ7
isolate (01CNKM012) from Kunming city in Yunnan
province was not clustered with other P6Δ7 isolates,
instead, this strain clustered with non-P6Δ7 Kunming
isolate 02CNKM014. Overall, these data further supported that different P6Δ7 strains could be independently
originated and the transmission of P6Δ7 strains only
occurred among IDUs who are closely related and
thereby could be defined at the very early phase.
To further confirm the transmission linkage, Bayesian
phylogenetic inference was also performed by employing
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach
in GTR+g+R model, as implemented in MrBayes 3.1
[11,14]. The MCMC search was run for 107 generations
with trees sampled every 1000th generation. Burn-in
was set at 50% and a posterior consensus tree was generated from 25,000 trees sampled. The posterior probability of nodes on the consensus tree was used as
phylogenetic support for clusters. Based on previously
reports [11,14], significant linkages were considered as
those having bootstrap values > 90% and genetic distances < 0.03 nt substitutions per site for gag sequences.
As expected, the Maximum-likelihood tree constructed
by Bayes method also confirmed the transmission linkage of 07LN134 and 07LN136, 00CNLN01 and
00CNLN04, 01CNKM012 and 01CNKM014 (Figure 6).
Interestingly, although the pairs were supported by high
bootstrap for sequence clusters of 02CNLN41 and
XJN0084, 709N and 07LN134/07LN136, the transmission linkage was not supported by both the KishinoHasegawa test and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test with p
value below 0.95, and those sequences were actually
derived from IDUs who reside in different provinces by
thousands miles apart. These data indicated that
approaches employed here to test the transmission linkage are reliable and CRF07_BC P6Δ7 strains could be
transmitted among IDUs.
The same analysis was performed for additional 43
CRF07_BC gag sequences which were collected from
IDU subjects in Urumqi city in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, as described previously [4]. Maximum-likelihood tree was constructed by MrBayes 3.1
(Figure 7). Among 43 sequences, 10 sequences were
identified containing P6Δ7 mutations. Similar to the
results from the analysis above, the transmission linkages between P6Δ7 isolates (XJN0301 and CBJB309),
or between P6Δ7 isolates and non-P6Δ7 isolates
(CBJB069 and XJN017) were supported by both
Kishino-Hasegawa test and Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (p

> 0.95). These data confirmed the observations above
that P6Δ7 strains could be originated independently and
the transmission of P6Δ7 strains did occur.
It remains controversial whether mutations in p6
could exert influence on the infection and the replication of HIV-1. Pikora CA et al and Bleiber G et al
showed that deletion up to 18 aa (S14-I31) in p6 only
had minor effects on the infectivity of HIV in vitro

[2,3]; In contrast, Lazert C et al observed that 4 aa
deletion in the central region of p6 (Δ25SQKQ28)
increased its association with ALIX which serves as a
chaperone protein to facilitate the viral assembling and
budding process [15]. Different from the artificial deletions in p6 as described above, P6Δ7 deletion in
CRF07_BC strains is naturally occurred as a unique
mutation pattern in a specific subtype, which suggested

that this mutation may have important implication
for CRF07_BC; Indeed, our longitudinal follow-up
observed that P6Δ7 deletion resulted in the rapid
increase in viral loads (Additional file1). In addition,
this deletion was not observed in CRF08_BC. As p6

Gag in CRF07_BC is derived from B clade whereas p6
Gag in CRF08_BC is from C clade, and the backbone
of CRF_BC is derived from C clade, P6Δ7 deletion
may represent a new adaption of B clade derived p6
Gag to C clade derived backbone.

CRF07_BC is the most prevalent Chinese strains and
accounts for nearly half of HIV-1 infection across the
nation [4-9], suggesting that this recombinant has been
highly adapted in Chinese population and any mutations
in this strain needs to be closely monitored. P6Δ7

mutation was observed in a fraction of CRF07_BC infected
subjects [4], the next important question for public health
is whether this mutation could be transmitted and spread.
Our sequence analysis demonstrated that the transmission
of P6Δ7 strains did occur in populations. This is for the

first time to establish the transmission linkage for P6Δ7
strains; Importantly, the transmission has occurred in different epidemic regions. Therefore, these data serve as a
wake-up call for our authority. Since the transmission of
P6Δ7 strains was only observed between epidemiologically

closely related IDUs, it is speculated that this is the initial
phase for the transmission of P6Δ7 strains. In addition,
our data also established that P6Δ7 CRF07_BC could be
originated from different parental strains and thereby had
versatile original ancestors in evolution.

Both the independent occurrence of the P6Δ7 in different CRF07_BC infected individuals and the transmission of P6Δ7 strain among IDUs suggested that this
deletion may have important implications. As known,
HIV-1 Gag p6 protein play a critical role in viral particle
budding by interaction with host factor Tsg101 and
ALIX [15-18], there may exist active mechanisms for
host cells to interrupt this process and thereby block the
viral budding. Therefore, it is rationalized that P6Δ7
may represent a new recombinant form escaping from
anti-p6 based budding mechanism. In this regards, it
will be important to address how P6Δ7 will influence
the engagement of p6 into the budding process.
