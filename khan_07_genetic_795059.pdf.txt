Abstract
Background: India has experienced several waves of migration since the Middle Paleolithic. It is
believed that the initial demic movement into India was from Africa along the southern coastal
route, approximately 60,000–85,000 years before present (ybp). It has also been reported that
there were two other major colonization which included eastward diffusion of Neolithic farmers
(Elamo Dravidians) from Middle East sometime between 10,000 and 7,000 ybp and a southern
dispersal of Indo Europeans from Central Asia 3,000 ybp. Mongol entry during the thirteenth
century A.D. as well as some possible minor incursions from South China 50,000 to 60,000 ybp
may have also contributed to cultural, linguistic and genetic diversity in India. Therefore, the genetic
affinity and relationship of Indians with other world populations and also within India are often
contested. In the present study, we have attempted to offer a fresh and immaculate interpretation
on the genetic relationships of different North Indian populations with other Indian and world
populations.
Results: We have first genotyped 20 tetra-nucleotide STR markers among 1800 north Indian
samples of nine endogamous populations belonging to three different socio-cultural strata. Genetic
distances (Nei's DA and Reynold's Fst) were calculated among the nine studied populations,
Caucasians and East Asians. This analysis was based upon the allelic profile of 20 STR markers to
assess the genetic similarity and differences of the north Indian populations. North Indians showed
a stronger genetic relationship with the Europeans (DA 0.0341 and Fst 0.0119) as compared to the
Asians (DA 0.1694 and Fst – 0.0718). The upper caste Brahmins and Muslims were closest to
Caucasians while middle caste populations were closer to Asians. Finally, three phylogenetic
assessments based on two different NJ and ML phylogenetic methods and PC plot analysis were
carried out using the same panel of 20 STR markers and 20 geo-ethnic populations. The three
phylogenetic assessments revealed that north Indians are clustering with Caucasians.
Conclusion: The genetic affinities of Indians and that of different caste groups towards Caucasians
or East Asians is distributed in a cline where geographically north Indians and both upper caste and
Muslim populations are genetically closer to the Caucasians.

Background
Approximately, 60,000–85,000 years before present
(ybp) the African exodus occurred and early modern
humans got settled in South Asia. They moved further
along the southern Asian coast to reach Southeast Asia,
New Guinea, and Australia [[1,2], and [3]]. The exact entry
date of modern humans into south Asia, which includes
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan,
and Sri Lanka, is uncertain. Various studies have been conducted in Indian specific to mtDNA or Y-chromosome.
However, these macro haplogroups M and N lineages cannot explain the recent admixture from the neighboring
region, which suggest that South Asian people are likely to
have been settled in this region since the middle Paleolithic period [[4-8], and [9]]. Moreover, early Neolithic
migration brought proto Dravidian speakers from the
eastern horn of the Fertile Crescent. Approximately, 3,500
years ago the Indo-European speakers might have arrived
and contributed to the Indian gene pool. The most recent
conquerors from central Asia and the colonizers from
Europe might have also added to this ethnic multiplicity.
It has been shown [10] that Indian populations exhibit
high degree of genetic admixture and a greater genetic
proximity with other world populations. Present day
India is represented by a complex socio-cultural mosaic
comprised of 20 major languages and approximately 750
dialects [11] constituted of 2000 castes and tribal groups
[12]. The vast majority of these ethnic populations (at
least 80%) are the Hindus, socially organized into castes
and sub-castes [13]. Tribal groups comprise about 8 % of
the total Indian population [14]. A third socio-religious
group, the Muslims, which are represented by two sects,
the Sunni and Shia, constitute approximately 12% of the
total Indian population [15]. Several other minor religious and/or ethnic constituents include Jews, Christians,
Buddhists and Sikhs among others. The relative frequencies of these groups vary regionally within the sub-continent [15].

entered India through the northwest, as they moved out
of Africa following a path south of the Himalayas, while
another ancestral group moved north, crossing the Himalayas, settling in southern China, and entering South Asia
later from the northeast [14,17,19]. Basu et al. 2003 [14]
studied mtDNA control region nucleotide diversity and
have shown a high frequency (19%) of the ancient autochthonous haplogroup M2, and lack of the younger haplogroup M4, in these tribal groups. In contrast, recent
analyses of Austro-Asiatic tribal populations showed a
low frequency of the M2 haplogroup (~2%); considering
this frequency, it would be difficult to claim that they were
the earliest inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent [6]. In
addition, mtDNA analysis of two southern Indian tribal
groups in comparison to caste groups suggested that
Indian caste and tribal populations share a common late
Pleistocene maternal ancestry, while no genetic evidence
substantiates the claim that the tribes were the earlier settlers, followed by caste groups derived from them
[3,5,7,22]. Most of the studies have been conducted taking into consideration the mt DNA/Y binary markers. We
have adopted a different approach by taking into consideration highly neutral markers (STRs) to study the genetic
diversity among north Indians from the thickly populated
state of India i.e. Uttar Pradesh.
To meet this objective, we genotyped 20 tetra-nucleotide
STR markers among 1800 north Indian samples from nine
endogamous populations belonging to three different
socio-cultural strata. Three of the upper caste populations
were Bhargavas, Chaturvedis and other Brahmins, while
the middle caste populations were Kayastha, Mathurs,
Rastogies and Vaish. Two Muslim populations were Shia
and Sunni. Selection of the STR markers was based on the
global survey carried out by Perez-Lezaun et al 1987 [23].
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the genetic
similarity and differences of the north Indian populations, various comparisons have been made.

Results
It is believed that the Indian populations were derived
from a small number of female founders, and the ethnic
differentiation occurred subsequently through demographic expansions and geographic dispersal. This is further corroborated by the findings of shared haplogroup
branches, without specific clustering of lineages in correlation with languages or the socio-cultural hierarchies of
caste or tribal populations (except for Andaman tribal lineages) [4,11,16,17]. However, it has often been presumed
that the tribes are the original inhabitants of India and
responsible for most of the genetic pool of India. Linguistically, the tribal populations are classified into AustroAsiatic, Dravidian, and Tibeto-Burman. Previous studies
have revealed that the Austro-Asiatic tribes would have
been the first in India [18]. These tribes might have

Allele frequency distribution
We have observed 176 alleles at 20 STRs. The allele
number ranged from 7 to 9 at sixteen STR loci (THO1,
TPO, FES, VWA, D4S243, DHFRP2, FGA, D7S820,
D5S818, D11S2010, D2S1328, ACPP, D9S926,
D13S1358, D14S306 and D18S848) while ≥ 10 alleles
have been observed at the remaining four STRs i.e.
D3S1358, D16S310, HPRT and F13A. Average number of
observed alleles was 8.8. The maximum numbers of 164
alleles have been observed in Shia, and minimum in
Vaish (146). All the STRs were in HWE. Locus wise average
observed heterozygosity is shown in additional file 1.

Estimation of Genetic distances
Pair wise genetic distances were calculated based on the
allele frequencies of 20 STR markers. The distance matrices were generated [Table 1] and have shown almost similar picture by using Nei's and Renold's Fst method. All the
nine populations were genetically closer to the European
populations with combined Fst being 0.011 and combined DA being 0.034. Interestingly, all the nine population depicted relatively higher distances from Asian
populations. Independently, the three upper caste Brahmin populations (Fst = 0.0116 and DA = 0.0332) were
closest to the Europeans while four middle caste populations (Fst = 0.0167 and DA = 0.0482) were genetically
more distant. The genetic distances with the Asian populations exhibited a totally different pattern where middle
caste populations were least distant from Asians and
upper caste Brahmins and Muslim sects were most distant
[Table 1].

Phylogenetic assessment of 35 Indian populations
In order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the
genetic similarity and differences existing between Indian
populations, a population database comprising of 35
Indian populations was compiled. The criterion of selection was to cover the major geographical and ethnic
groups from North, South, East, Central and Western
India. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out in 35 populations. The phylogenetic assessments were made based on
the allele frequency profile of 6 STR markers studied in all
35 populations. A phylogram was generated using maximum likelihood method [Figure 4]. The 6 STR loci
included for the analysis are THO1, vWA, D5S818,
D7S820, TPOX and D3S1358. All West Indian populations belonging to the state of Maharashtra have clustered
in one group along with the two populations, Gowda and
Muslims of the adjoining southern state of Karnataka. All
West Indian populations belonging to the state of Maharashtra have clustered in one group along with the two
populations, Gowda and Muslims of the adjoining southern state of Karnataka. All the populations analyzed in the
present study, other populations of Uttar Pradesh and of
adjoining state of Bihar formed a distinct cluster. The third
cluster comprised of the populations of Eastern part of the
country (Orissa) along with the south Indian upper caste
Iyengar Brahmins. The fourth cluster was a conglomerate
of populations from different regions. The nine studied
populations of the present study clustered in the group of
other north Indian populations but on a distinct branch.
Another important aspect of the ML phylogram was the
significantly longer branch length of north and West
Indian populations, suggesting a high level of genetic
diversity.

Phylogenetic reconstruction
Comparison with different world populations
We have compared our populations with 16 world populations (Perez-Lezaun et al.1997 [23] which have been
categorized into five major continents. Both NJ phylogram (Nei's DA genetic distance) and ML phylogram based
on variance in allele frequency distribution on 20 STRs
were analyzed [Figure 1a and 1b]. Our results revealed
that middle caste populations (Kayastha, Mathurs, Vaish
and Rastogies) are more similar to Asians while upper
caste i.e. Brahmins, Bhargavas, and Chaturvedies are similar to Europeans. Interestingly Shias and Sunnis are closer
to upper caste and, hence to Europeans. The ML phylogenetic tree and PC plot (Figure 2 and 3) generated from the
allele frequency data of 29 populations (nine populations
of the present study and twenty world populations) also
depicted that the north Indian populations clearly clustered with the Caucasians.

Discussion
An elite historical, demographical and socio-cultural contour makes Indian populations a melting pot for the study
of genetic variation and differentiation. On one hand,
copious migratory events have created an extensive range

of genetic diversity while inflexible and stern socio-cultural barriers have structured this diversity into different
endogamous groups identified by the name of "castes".
This term "Caste" is an assemblage of various socio-cultural customs; traditions and barriers that have created an
abundant number of hierarchically arranged 'endogamous'
groups. This social hierarchy system is unique and exquisite because in the caste system, birth of an individual governs and decides most of the proceedings of the life
including the choice of the mating partner. Marriage
between partners of equal status is preferred, and reproduction in the caste system is largely endogamous [24].
In order to testify the hypothesis of social cleavage resulting into genetic structuring even in a confined geographical area, we have carried out various statistical analyses to
determine the level of genetic differentiation between the
studied populations. As mentioned earlier, the studied

five groups belong to two different religious strata and
practice highly restricted marital patterns. The level of
population structuring triggered by the caste system further gets enhanced due to an additional level of endogamy called 'surname endogamy' practiced mainly by the
most stringent higher caste group [25].
We calculated the genetic distances and pair wise matrices
using two different genetic distance calculations, Nei's
DA, and Reynold's Fst. The distances were calculated from
the European and Asian populations analyzed for the
same set of 20 STR markers by Perez Lezaun et al [14].
Two genetic distance methods have been used to overcome the ascertainment bias resulted from hyper mutability of STR loci [17]. The estimation of genetic distances
between Europeans and Proto-Asians (mainly East
Asians) with north Indians at 20 STR markers clearly
establishes strong genetic relationship of north Indians

with Europeans as both DA (0.0341) and Fst (0.0119)
reveled that north Indians are genetically more closer to
the Europeans than Asians (DA 0.1694 and Fst – 0.0718).
Another imperative finding was the differential pattern of
genetic affinities of the three socio-cultural groups of
north India with the Europeans. The affinity to Caucasians was proportionate to caste rank where upper caste
Brahmins being genetically closest (DA = 0.0332 and Fst
= 0.0116), followed by Muslims (DA = 0.0348 and Fst =
0.0122) while the middle caste populations were most
distant from the Europeans (DA = 0.0482 and Fst =
0.0167) and closure to Asians.
In order to prove the phylogenetic accuracy of STR loci, a
panel of only 10 autosomal STR loci has been used to
infer phylogenetic relationships among well-defined geoethnic population groups and it has been observed that
despite of the high allelic variability, STR loci are successful in reconstructing the accurate human phylogenies. To

achieve this goal, a database of 22 geographically targeted
and racially diverse set – population from forensic literature was compiled [33-41]. Both ML phylogram and PCplot analysis were carried out and it was observed that
basal cluster pattern of ML phylogram carries three geoethnic groups, indicating the role of genetic drift as a
major force of evolution [Figure 2 and 3]. Both the trees
have a longer African branch than any other group. Such
a patristic separation was also visible in the PC-plot analysis [Figure 3]. The edge lengths displayed in these phylograms indicated the amount of evolutionary change along
each branch. The scores next to the nodes characterize the
number of bootstrap replicates (out of 1000) exhibiting
these specific bifurcations. The African populations have
been clustered into central (Cameroon and Lisongo) and
North African (Moroccan Arabs and Saharawasi Africans)
groups. Such clustering was also reported by CavalliSforza and Feldman, (2003) and Underhill et al., (2001)

respectively. This sub clustering further strengthens the
utility of STR loci in deciphering the accurate phylogenies,
even within the same geographical region. Middle Eastern
Arabs displayed a branch nearer to Caucasians and to
some extent closer to Moroccan Arabs suggesting a strong
Caucasian element along with African admixtures. This is
indicative of the Demic expansion of the Middle East
genes, agriculture innovations and languages into North
West Africa [14], which is further supported by the near
medial position of Arabs in the PC-plot. Recently, Y-chromosome SNP analysis by Al-Zahery et al., 2003 [30] also
revealed a similar pattern in other Middle Eastern populations. European branching pattern have resolved Basque,
Spaniards and Portuguese in a separate cluster from that
of German/Austrian branch. All 9 North Indian populations clustered on a separate branch emerging sharing the
same node with the Caucasians in the ML phylogram.

We further compared our populations with other Indian
and the world populations. On the basis of allele frequencies calculated at 6 STR loci in 35 Indian populations
(including nine populations of the present study), we
have deduced that the geographical barriers, and to some
extent ethnic origin have been the major source of genetic
structuring of Indian populations along with little effect
of socio-cultural practices. Similar observations have been
made by Kashyap et al 2002 [27] in their report on 54 distinct Indian populations. Phylogenetic analysis of the 35
populations have yielded a geo-ethnically structured picture [Figure 3], where it has been seen that three well
defined clusters comprising of north, west and east Indian
populations were formed and in each of the geographic
cluster, different caste and Muslim populations have clustered together. For instance, like Karnataka Muslims clustered with Desasth and Chitpavan Brahmins of
Maharashtra and north Indian Muslims clustered with

north Indian Brahmins. Interestingly, most of the populations of these three clusters have a Caucasian origin. The
clustering points towards the possibility the West Eurasian
or central Asian immigrants appointed themselves to predominantly belonged to castes of higher rank and both
lower caste and tribes were least admixed with these
groups [11].
The results based on 20 STR markers have revealed that all
the populations have similar allele frequency distribution
which may be suggestive of a common ancestry or a continuous gene flow among these populations. We did Gst,
Fst and AMOVA assessment for all the nine populations
[Figure 5]. It was interesting to note that between group

percentages variance got increased as the analysis was carried out between two (Muslim population), three (upper
caste populations), five (upper caste) and all the nine
populations. This finding revealed that the amount of
genetic variation attributable to between populations in a
socio-religious group is minimal as compared to variance
between groups. Therefore, the three groups might differ
from each other at the genetic level owing to the socio-cultural structuring. However, the genetic profile of all the
nine populations included in the analysis exhibit extensive genetic overlap either due to the same common
recent ancestor or due to the fact that the caste system is
~3000–4000 years old [26] and the time period is significantly small to create the genetic differentiation. Further-

more, the spread of Muslim population groups in India is
ascribed to heavy admixture with local caste populations
[13].
It has been proposed that the genetic make up of the
Indian populations is an admixture of Caucasians and
Asians. Bamshad et al. 2001 [11] studied 8 south Indian
populations and deduced that they are genetically closer
to Asian populations. The data generated from the present
study has shown that the nine north Indian populations
are genetically closer to the Caucasian than to the Asian
populations. The phylogenetic reconstruction of these
populations along with other world populations has also
shown that all the nine north Indian populations have
clustered with the European populations [Figure 1, 2, 3].
When genetic distance were calculated between Eurasians
(West Eurasia, Middle East and Central Asia) and ProtoAsians (mainly East Asians) with north Indians at 20 STR
and with south Indians at 60 STR loci [11], two different
patterns of genetic distance were obtained [Table 2]. Geographically, genetic distance with the Eurasians increases
from north to South India while that with proto-Asian
populations decreases. The other observation was that
when different caste groups of north India were compared
with Eurasians and proto-Asian populations groups, the
affinity to Eurasians was proportionate to caste rank while
the upper caste and Muslims were more similar to Caucasians than middle caste populations.

(Uttar Pradesh). All the samples were adult with mean age
of 38.8 ± 3.4 years and were residents of Uttar Pradesh
since last three generations. Prior to the sample collection,
regional addresses and detailed computerized lists of the
populations have been prepared from different districts of
Uttar Pradesh. Random numbers were generated with the
help of computer and adult individuals living in different
parts of Uttar Pradesh have been questioned about their
ethnicity caste affiliations and surnames and the birthplaces of their parents as per the order of the random
number. Only unrelated subjects were considered eligible
to participate. The demographic profile and other ethnical
and familial information were filled in a detailed Performa. Three-generation pedigree charts were prepared to
assure un-relatedness in all the samples.
Whole blood was obtained by venipuncture and about 5
ml of blood was collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes after
obtaining the informed consent from the subjects. The
study was performed with the approval of the institutional ethical reviewing committee of Sanjay Gandhi Post
Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow and the government of India.
2. DNA extraction
High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted by
salting out method using phenol-chloroform as described
by Coomey et al. 1993 [31] and was purified by ethanol
precipitation.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis of nine endogamous/consanguineous populations of North India based on 20 STR loci
have unwrapped the information about the genetic affinities of north Indians. Our results have demonstrated that
intra-population differences were marginal still there was
a definite pattern of genetic variation found in different
populations. Finally, we observed genetic affinities of
Indians and that of different caste groups towards Caucasians or East Asians which are differentially distributed
where geographically north Indians and socially both
upper caste and Muslim populations are genetically closer
to the Caucasians. However, the genetic configuration of
Indians is as complex hence more genetic data from the
sub-continent is highly necessitated to unravel the intricacy of Indian genetic composition.

Methods
1. Subjects
Present study is the first and one of the largest population
based analysis (N = 1800) from this part of India. Moreover, we have taken into consideration a statistically significant sample size from all the caste populations. Total 200
samples have been collected from each of the nine populations i.e. Bhargavas, Chaturvedis, Brahmins, Kayastha,
Mathurs, Rastogies, Vaish and Shia and Sunni Muslims

genotyped using PCR based locus specific amplification as
mentioned earlier [23]. One of the primers for each of
marker was labeled with a fluorochrome – VIC (D5S818,
D13S767, D18S848, ACPP, VWA, D16S310 and
D4S243), Ned (TPO, D9S926, FES, D14S306, D7S820
and DHFRP2) and 6-FAM (FGA, D3S1358, Tho1,
D11S2010, D2S1328, F13A1 and HPRT). PCR amplification of all the markers was carried out by co-amplifying 15
STR loci in five multiplex PCR while remaining five markers were genotyped by single PCR. Size fractionation of
the fluorochrome labeled amplicons was carried out by
capillary electrophoresis in ABI-310 automated fragment
size genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Size calling of the alleles at individual loci was done with GENESCAN v 3.1.2 software with the help of 500-ROX size
standard (Applied Biosystems, USA). Once the size calling
was completed, GENOTYPER v2.5.2 software was used to
assign base pair size to each of the allele at respective STR
marker and create the allelic profile of an individual for
different markers.

4. Statistical analysis
Allele frequencies at each of the marker have been
obtained by direct counting method from the observed
number of alleles at a locus divided by total number of
gametes. Deviation from the assumption of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium at genotypic frequencies for all markers
in random north Indian population was estimated using
Fischer's exact test based on 1000 Markov-Chain algorithm steps in Arlequin v2 software. Bonferroni correction
to the p value was applied.

Two different genetic distances Nei's DA , and Reynold's Fst
based on the allele frequency distribution of 20 STR were
calculated to assess the genetic relationship of north Indians with the Europeans and Asians. Both the distance
matrices namely Nei's DA , and Reynold's Fst were calculated using GENDIST option in PHYLIP v3.5c [32].

Phylogenetic analysis carried out for different populations
by two enrooted radial phylograms, Neighbor Joining or
NJ-phylogenetic Tree and Maximum Likelihood or MLphylogenetic Tree. The NJ algorithm was used to construct
the branching array from a matrix of genetic distances calculated from different distance matrices namely Nei's DA ,
and Reynold's Fst using GENDIST option in PHYLIP v3.5c
[32]. The option NEGHBOR in PHYLIP v3.5c was used to
draw the phylogenetic trees from the distance matrices.
Maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm was used for phylogenetic reconstruction using CONTML in PHYLIP v3.5c.
In both NJ as well as ML method, statistical bootstrap
involving 1000 replicates was carried out using SEQBOOT
option of PHYLIP v3.5c. Finally, a consensus of 1000 trees
(NJ and ML both) was drawn using CONSENSE option of
PHYLIP v 3.5 [32].
