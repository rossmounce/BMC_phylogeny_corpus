<p>The chætognath transcriptome reveals unusual genomic features in the evolution of this protostome and suggests that it could be used
Chætognath genomics and evolution

Abstract
Background: The chætognaths (arrow worms) have puzzled zoologists for years because of their
astonishing morphological and developmental characteristics. Despite their deuterostome-like
development, phylogenomic studies recently positioned the chætognath phylum in protostomes,
most likely in an early branching. This key phylogenetic position and the peculiar characteristics of
chætognaths prompted further investigation of their genomic features.
Results: Transcriptomic and genomic data were collected from the chætognath Spadella
cephaloptera through the sequencing of expressed sequence tags and genomic bacterial artificial
chromosome clones. Transcript comparisons at various taxonomic scales emphasized the
conservation of a core gene set and phylogenomic analysis confirmed the basal position of
chætognaths among protostomes. A detailed survey of transcript diversity and individual
genotyping revealed a past genome duplication event in the chætognath lineage, which was,
surprisingly, followed by a high retention rate of duplicated genes. Moreover, striking genetic
heterogeneity was detected within the sampled population at the nuclear and mitochondrial levels
but cannot be explained by cryptic speciation. Finally, we found evidence for trans-splicing
maturation of transcripts through splice-leader addition in the chætognath phylum and we further
report that this processing is associated with operonic transcription.
Conclusion: These findings reveal both shared ancestral and unique derived characteristics of the
chætognath genome, which suggests that this genome is likely the product of a very original
evolutionary history. These features promote chætognaths as a pivotal model for comparative
genomics, which could provide new clues for the investigation of the evolution of animal genomes.

Background

The recent shift of genomic biology from conventional model
organisms to evolutionarily relevant species has led to the
questioning of numerous ideas about metazoan evolution.
For instance, the recently released genome of the starlet
anemone has revealed a striking conservation with its vertebrate counterparts despite an apparent morphological gap
between these organisms [1]. On the contrary, whereas the
Hox gene clusters have been considered for a long time as
structures strictly required for the development of the common bilaterian body plan, they were found to be disorganized
or even dislocated in animals such as nematodes or urochordates [2,3]. These cases illustrate the interest of genomic
insights from organisms that display either peculiar morphological characteristics or have key phylogenetic positions.
Interestingly, chætognaths, also known as arrow worms, fulfill both of these criteria: they have one of the most intriguing
sets of morphological and developmental characteristics
among animals and their phylogenetic position was recently
reevaluated as a pivotal one for the understanding of animal
evolution [4]. These free-living marine creatures represent
one of the major predators of the zooplancton food-chain but
the phylum is mainly known for its original mosaic of morphological characteristics that have puzzled zoologists for
years [5]. Their nervous system exhibits typical protostome
features, such as ventral nervous mid-body ganglions and circum-esophageal fibers [6], whereas the enterocoelous formation of their body cavity and the secondary emergence of their
mouth are embryological features traditionally related to
deuterostomes [7]. Strikingly, this original body plan has
been conserved since the lowermost Cambrian period as
shown by convincing fossil evidence [8,9]. First attempts to
position chætognaths using molecular phylogeny were difficult because small subunits (SSUs) and large subunits (LSUs)
of ribosomal RNA genes display very fast evolutionary rates
that hinder accurate tree reconstruction [10-12]. Subsequent
analysis of their mitochondrial genome prompted classification of chætognaths among protostomes, but their exact
branching in this clade remains elusive [13,14]. The Hox
genes of chætognaths are distinct from those typical of other
protostomes: their original MedPost gene shares similarity
with both median and posterior classes [15] and the posterior
Hox genes that were recently identified in these animals are
neither related to the AbdB nor Post1/2 classes, which are
specific for ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans, respectively
[16].
Recently, the phylogenomic approach has provided the
opportunity to sum up the phylogenetic signal from hundreds
of genes and thereby to increase the resolution of the phylogenies [17]. Two different phylogenomic studies involving different chætognath species and based on different samples of
nuclear genes have assessed the phylogenetic position of chætognaths. They have both provided strong support for the
inclusion of chætognaths within protostomes [17-19]. Matus

et al. [19] suggested the branching of chætognaths at the base
of lophotrochozoans on the basis of 72 nuclear genes
described as valuable phylogenetic markers by Philippe et al.
[20]. Conversely, using a slightly larger taxonomic sampling
and 78 ribosomal protein (RP) genes, Marlétaz et al. [18] proposed that chætognaths are the sister group of all other protostomes. This last hypothesis has deep implications for the
evolution of developmental patterns among bilaterians since
it promotes the view that deuterostome-like developmental
features such as enterocoely or a secondary mouth opening
may be ancestral among bilaterians. Interestingly, recent
insights into the structure of the nervous system of chætognaths suggest that these organisms have an intra-epidermal
non-centralized nerve plexus, such as those observed in
hemichordates or cnidarians [6]. This is another example of a
putative ancestral characteristic in this phylum. Then, both
the phylogenetic position of chætognaths and their peculiar
morphology and development indicate that these organisms
are pivotal for the understanding of animal evolution.
The expressed sequence tag (EST) approach provides an
interesting opportunity to survey genomes and to perform
comparisons between organisms. For instance, whole transcriptome comparisons based on ESTs initially suggested that
the gene repertory shared by all metazoans is larger than
expected [21]. Moreover, in regard to the unexpected genetic
complexity of cnidarians, the evolutionary extent of gene
losses observed in nematodes and Drosophila remains to be
defined [21]. Through their original phylogenetic position,
chætognaths offer the opportunity to check whether the
ancestral protostome transcriptome has already undergone
such gene losses or remains close to the ancestral bilaterian
gene set conserved between vertebrates and cnidarians. Furthermore, the identification of a core set of metazoan conserved genes from a large range of organisms provides
marker genes for phylogenomic analyses and signature genes
as rare genomic changes, which could lead to a reevaluation
of animal phylogeny [22,23].
Here, we describe an overview of Spadella cephaloptera
genomics through fine-scale mining of consistent transcriptomic data. Although the morphology of chætognaths has
been extensively described, only a few molecular studies have
focused on these strange organisms. The transcriptome of
chætognaths reveals a strong similarity with that of other
bilaterians. This comparative framework allowed detection of
molecular signatures and stressed the usefulness of RPs as
marker genes for phylogenomic reconstruction. Along with
the structural RNAs, RPs are major components of the ribosome translation complex [24]. They constitute a set of
remarkably conserved genes among eukaryotes, which have
not been significantly affected by lineage-specific duplication
[25]. We took advantage of their high levels of expression,
which allowed the assembly of a large dataset with extensive
taxon sampling using ESTs. We then investigated the origin
of the polymorphisms observed within the EST collection in

the light of genome duplication or cryptic speciation as alternative explanatory hypotheses. Lastly, we found evidence for
trans-splicing mRNA maturation in chætognaths from this
EST data. This original mRNA processing mechanism
involves the addition of a spliced-leader sequence at the 5'
extremity of transcripts. This mechanism has been discovered in several animal phyla by analyzing other EST collections [26]. Interestingly, the occurrence of trans-splicing in
chætognaths has deep implications for the evolutionary origin and functional significance of this mechanism.

Results and discussion
Partial transcriptome of the chætognath S.
cephaloptera
The sequencing of an EST collection of the juvenile-staged
chætognath S. cephaloptera offered the opportunity to
explore the transcriptome of this evolutionarily significant
organism. The survey of sequence length and quality supported the accuracy of these data (Figure S1 in Additional
data file 1). During these steps, we noticed that 16% of
sequences match mitochondrial rRNA sequences (12S and
16S rRNAs, Figure 1) probably because the long polyadenine
stretches of these rRNA molecules were isolated by the oligosdT employed for mRNA isolation (see Materials and methods). We attempted to build clusters that gathered all transcripts from a unique gene so as to deal with a non-redundant
partial transcriptome. However, the low complexity regions
of some ESTs, which did not include an accurate open reading
frame, hindered this process. Thus, ESTs were sorted into
predicted coding and non-coding sequences using conceptual
translation, and the coding transcripts were retained for comparative analyses. The overall content of the EST collection
was evaluated using these steps (Figure 1). We noticed that up
to 54% of the ESTs could be non-coding polyadenylated RNA,
a striking figure that is, however, similar to that obtained for
the human genome [27]. The removal of non-coding
sequences greatly improved clustering efficiency, yielding
1,447 clusters, of which 459 include more than one sequence
(Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). A total of 694 of these
clusters have significant matches within a protein database
(TrEMBL, score >50) and 250 have clear homologs in this
database with an average of 72% identity (score >150).
Among the transcripts that match nuclear coding genes, the
RP genes are largely represented compared to other genes
similar to SwissProt entries (Figure 1).
The average gene content of the library was checked regarding functional annotation as implemented in Gene Ontology
[28]. The S. cephaloptera library exhibited a broad diversity
of functional classes with a majority of transcripts involved in
metabolism or cellular activities and a non-negligible amount
of transcripts involved in development (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1), which is consistent with the juvenile stage
of the animals used. Hence, this EST collection contains rep-

prominent aspect of this distribution as well as the unexpected presence

resentative, high quality sequences, providing suitable material for comparative analyses.

Gene core conservation
The set of non-redundant chætognath transcripts was compared with several databases using the Blast program. These
databases first included sets of transcripts of representative
species belonging to the most important clades of bilaterians:
Drosophila melanogaster as an ecdysozoan, Lumbricus terrestris as a lophotrochozoan and Homo sapiens as a deuterostome. These comparisons were depicted through the
plotting of respective similarity scores for all transcripts that
have a significant match to at least one of these species (score
>150, Figure 2). This comparison demonstrated that a pool of
141 transcripts is strongly conserved between these distantly
related species (Figure 2a). Conversely, 169 transcripts did
not have significant matches in one or two of the species
despite their strong similarity between chætognath and the
remaining species. This lack of homologs is generally imputed
to extensive gene loss [21]. Therefore, further comparisons
were performed to identify genes whose homology assignment and gene loss in a peculiar lineage were unambiguous.
Interestingly, the number of transcripts that did not match to
one or more databases decreased from 169 to 74 when the
complete set of sequences available for each bilaterian clade
was employed as the database, instead of only one representative species (Figure 2b). The lack of homologous matches in
some species could then be explained by an increase in evolutionary rates, which could have weakened the sequence similarity signal [29]. Additionally, the similarity level of matches
increased when composite databases were employed (Figure
2), which supports the interest in this approach for phylogenomic reconstruction [18].

The candidates for signature genes are the genes inferred to
be lost in one of the investigated clades (Figure 2b). Those
candidates were carefully examined and their presence
checked in the largest sets of available ESTs and full genome
sequences. These data include the newly sequenced full
genomes of lophotrochozoans and is assumed to include an
exhaustive gene set in these species. Numerous candidate
genes were invalidated because their homology relationships
are disputable or because a homolog was retrieved from the
full genome sequences surveyed. Among these candidates,
the guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) enzyme
was recovered in the chætognath S. cephaloptera, in all studied deuterostomes, cnidarians and sister groups of metazoans
(Figure S3 in Additional data file 1) but was not retrieved in
any of the protostomes surveyed. Notably, this GAMT enzyme
was also recovered in the acoel Convoluta pulchra, which was
recently excluded from the protostomes [30]. This enzyme
catalyzes the key step of creatine synthesis, an activity that
was previously checked biochemically in a variety of organisms but was not found in selected protostomes [31]. GAMT
was later noticed as missing in D. melanogaster, Anopheles
gambiae and Caeorhabditis elegans genomes [32]. The presence of this ancient gene provides strong evidence for an early
divergence of chætognaths from other protostomes. Indeed,
the most parsimonious scenario states that this gene was lost
in the protostome lineage after its split with chætognaths
[18].

comparisons and the plotting of respective Blast scores was performed
using Simitri [77] (cut-off score 150). Genes at the center of the plot are
equally related to the three databases and hence represent valuable
phylogenetic markers, whereas genes attracted by a node share a greater
similarity with the corresponding database. Genes on the edge do not
have a match in the database from the opposite vertex and those on the
vertex only have a match in the corresponding database; these two types
of genes constitute candidates for signature genes that have possibly been
lost in a peculiar lineage. The color scale indicates the relevancy of scores.

Two classes of genes provide reliable information for phylogeny inference (Figure 2b). Those that are highly shared
between distantly related taxa constitute a set of conserved
genes that are valuable markers for constructing phylogenomic datasets. In parallel, the genes that lack a homologous
copy in one of the considered clades represent meaningful
signature genes whose loss is attributable to a discrete event
[23].

We attempted to evaluate the phylogenetic properties of the
conserved genes that share equal levels of similarity with the
main animal clades with respect to the convenience of their
orthology assignment, their abundance in EST data and their
molecular evolution properties. The main concerns when
constructing phylogenomic-class datasets, especially from
EST data, are the discarding of paralogous sequences, the
removal of contaminants and the limitation of missing data.
According to these criteria, we argue here that the set of RP
genes is one of the best for setting up phylogenomic analysis
in a large sample of taxa.
Among the 694 chætognath genes similar to a database entry,
only 267 genes have homologs in the three main clades of
bilaterians (score >150, Figure 2b). Copies of each selected
marker were retrieved for all phyla studied for which EST
data are available (Figure 3). In this way, the missing data
were estimated through the occurrence of each gene in EST
collections and preliminary phylogenetic analyses were carried out for all these independent alignments. Such controls
unexpectedly highlighted putative paralogy problems for
many candidate markers. If the orthologous transcript of a
surveyed gene is missing in a non-exhaustive EST collection,
a paralogous relative of this gene could be retrieved instead,
with little chance of detection. Among candidate marker
genes, RPs exhibit no ancient duplicates or out-paralogs and
constitute a class of markers free from potential paralogy

assignment problems [25,33]. Moreover, the gene-specific
trees allowed detection of some contaminants in the EST
collections, through the verification of unexpected clusterings
in the tree (for example, several EST collections of parasitic
organisms being contaminated by transcripts from their
hosts).
Next, the amount of missing data was estimated using these
raw alignments and compared with the number of ESTs in
each available collection (Figure 3). The positive correlation
observed between the number of ESTs and the completeness
of the dataset is stronger when dealing with a dataset composed of RPs. For instance, the 5,235 EST collection of tardigrades yielded a dataset that is 77% complete for RPs, but
only 35% complete for non-ribosomal markers. Thus, their
large representation in EST collections strengthens the usefulness of RPs as phylogenetic markers.

Chætognaths within renewed metazoan phylogeny
In order to assess the branching of chætognaths and to stress
the usefulness of RP genes for phylogenomics, a RP dataset
was assembled using the composite dataset approach [18].
This method depends on the selection of the least diverging
copy of each marker gene in each taxon, such as a phylum,
and thus allows reduction of the branch lengths of composite
taxa (Table S1 in Additional data file 2). To overcome previous
problems, both taxon sampling and inference methods were
improved. Several new phyla were included in this analysis
and, in particular, numerous protostome groups: priapulids,
platyhelminthes, nermerteans, ectoprocts, entoprocts and
rotifers [34-36]. Most rotifer sequences were retrieved from
Oryza sativa (rice) ESTs, where they exist as contaminants,
using their very specific splice-leader sequence as an anchor
(see below and [37]). Rotifers constitute a key phylum with
respect to chætognaths because they were sometimes

grouped together in the gnathifera clade on the basis of
morphological criteria [38]. Alternatively, a splitting of
lophotrochozoans into two main lineages, the platyzoans
(uniting platyhelminthes and rotifers) and the trochozoans
(mainly annelids, molluscs, lophophorates and nermertes)
has been proposed [39,40]. Otherwise, in addition to the traditional site-homogenous WAG model, we have assessed the
phylogeny of bilaterians using the site-heterogeneous CAT
model, which recently improved the limitation of the longbranch attraction artifact, a common pitfall in phylogenetic
reconstruction [41,42]. The inclusion of the most recently
released EST data for this large set of phyla led to a dataset
including 11,730 amino acid positions and 25 taxa (Additional
data file 4).
The analysis of this dataset confirmed the branching of chætognaths at the base of the protostomes with significant support values for both the site-homogeneous WAG model and
the site-heterogeneous CAT model (bootstrap proportion
(BP) of 76 and posterior probability (PP) of 1; Figure 4a,b).
The inclusion of chætognaths within protostomes is still
firmly supported (BP 95, PP 1; Figure 4). The inclusion of new
taxa strengthens support for both the ecdyozoa and lophotrochozoa clades but the exact relationships within these two
clades remain elusive [35,36,43]. Chætognaths and rotifers
do not exhibit any peculiar affinities, prompting us to reject
the gnathifera hypothesis [38]. Conversely, the branching of
rotifers is problematic since this phylum is alternatively
included in ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans depending on
the use of, respectively, site heterogeneous or homogeneous
models (Figure 4). Thus, the clustering of platyhelminthes
and rotifers in a platyzoa clade is supported by the WAG
model but rejected by the CAT model, suggesting that this
grouping may be somehow related to long-branch attraction
(Figure 4). Alternatively, previous studies based on morphology and SSU genes have not argued for the ecdysozoan affinities of rotifers [38,39]. Surprisingly, CAT model analysis no
longer succeeds in recovering the monophyly of the deuterostomes (Figure 4b). Instead, it provides limited support for the
successive divergence of chordates and ambulacrarians (echinoderms and hemichordates; PP 0.9; Figure 4b). This striking topology was recovered by an independent study using the
same heterogeneous CAT model [43] but was neither confirmed by WAG analyses (BP 89 for the monophyly of deuterostomes; Figure 4a) nor supported on morphological bases
[34,38]. One can consider that the two unexpected branchings of rotifers and deuterostomes may be related to some
artifact affecting the CAT model, such as sensitivity toward
compositional biases [44]. Finally, the placozoan Trichoplax
adherens surprisingly clustered within the poriferans, as a
sister group of the homoscleromorphs (BP 91, PP 0.94; Figure
4), although this poriferan status has never been suggested
before [45,46]. These challenging hypotheses will be investigated in further studies because they have deep implications
for the evolution of metazoans (F Marlétaz et al., in progress).

The basal-protostome branching of chætognaths is confirmed through improved inference methods and expanded taxon sampling
The basal-protostome branching of chætognaths is confirmed through improved inference methods and expanded taxon sampling. A RP alignment of
11,730 positions (after GBlock filtration; see Additional data file 4) was analyzed using two classes of models. (a) Site-homogeneous model (WAG)
implemented in a maximum-likelihood framework (PhyML [80] and Treefinder [81]). Similar topology and maximal posterior probabilities were obtained
with Bayesian analyses using the same model (MrBayes). (b) Site-heterogeneous model (CAT) implemented in a bayesian framework (Phylobayes [79]).
Plain colored circles denote nodes for which significant support values were obtained (likelihood ratio statistics based on expected-likelihood weights (LRELW) >0.95 for site-homogenous and PP >0.95 for site-heterogenous). Support values are indicated for selected nodes: LR-ELW statistics and bootstrap
(bold type) for maximum likelihood (ML) using the WAG model and posterior probabilities for Bayesian inference using the CAT model.

Through extended taxon sampling and improved substitution
models, these analyses strongly confirm our previous
statements about basal-protostome branching of chætognaths [18] and exclude the basal-lophotrochozan hypothesis
[19]. Although some areas of bilaterian trees are sometimes
incongruent depending on models and inference methods,
the position of chætognaths remains remarkably stable
throughout our analyses. Furthermore, this branching is not
only supported by the presence of GAMT, an unambiguous
molecular signature, but also by the posterior Hox genes of
chætognaths that are not related to the classes specific to
ecdysozoans (Abd-B) or lophotrochozoans (Post1/2) [16].

Finally, this topology was also recovered by independent
studies involving alternative gene and taxon sampling
[30,35,43]. In a broader perspective, the strengthening of
their phylogenetic position makes chætognaths a key model
for comparative genomics among bilaterians.

Genome duplication in the chætognath phylum
The clustering of similar sequences indicated that alternative
nucleotide forms are present among the transcripts encoding
the same protein. Two distinct forms are observed in most
cases, although three forms encode some proteins. These
forms are separated by a large amount of molecular diver-

Alternative forms of selected markers amplified by PCR in order to assess the origin of polymorphism
Alternative forms of selected markers amplified by PCR in order to assess the origin of polymorphism. (a) Localization of sperm within sperm receptacles
(SR) and sperm ducts (SD) in the body of chætognath S. cephaloptera along with ovaries (Ov) and testis (Te). The double arrow indicates that head and
body of individuals were split to perform independent PCR amplifications with the purpose of detecting possible contamination from the sperm genome.
(b) Paralogous copies of nuclear genes RP L36 and L40 with their intron positions and average lengths, which are distinct in both cases (Additional data

gence and can also be distinguished by their different 5' and
3' untranslated regions (UTRs), suggesting that they
correspond to different genes (Figure 5 and Additional data
files 5 and 6).
Ka/Ks ratios were calculated for all pairs of diverging forms to
consider the impact of the nucleotide divergence on the protein sequences. The values of Ka/Ks range from 0.001-0.154
with a median value of 0.004, which confirmed the strong
conservation of amino acid sequence despite the large synonymous substitutions observed in some cases (Ks values range
from 0.8-75; Table S2 in Additional data file 2). These distinct
forms were mainly retrieved for the most highly expressed
genes, among which RP genes are prominent (Table 1). We
verified that the observed molecular divergence could not be
explained by the clustering of distant paralogous sequences.
For the genes that have clear homologs among metazoans, the
sequences of alternative forms always cluster together in phylogenetic analyses and are thus strongly separated from

homologous genes of other animals. For instance, the RUX
genes have undergone an ancient duplication resulting in the
RUX-E and RUX-G paralogs in all metazoans. Interestingly,
chætognaths display up to three forms of RUX-E and two
forms of RUX-G, all these forms being closely related (Figure
S4 in Additional data file 1; Additional data file 7).
Such a pattern could be explained by either the duplication of
a large set of genes in the genome of chætognaths or, alternatively, it could be explained by the presence of cryptic species
within the sampled population. In the first case, the observed
differences would be attributed to the divergence between
paralogous genes originating through the duplication, where
the genome of one individual is expected to contain the two
alternative nucleotide forms. In the second case, the observed
genetic differences would be caused by the genetic divergence
between the orthologous genes of several cryptic species
spread among the population, where one individual is thus
expected to contain only one of the alternative forms.

Genome Biology 2008,

This cryptic speciation hypothesis may be supported by the
strong polymorphism also observed for all genes of the mitochondrial genome, which constitutes an independent lineage
from the nuclear genome. For example, cytochrome b (Cytb)
transcripts but also cytochrome oxydase I and III are split
into distinct forms separated by large molecular distances
(Figure 5c; Figure S4 in Additional data file 1; Additional data
files 8-10), thus testifying to the presence of distinct mitochondrial lineages within the sampled population.
To decide between these hypotheses, we designed a PCR
screen to survey the alternative forms of selected markers in
independent individuals. The genes for RPs L36 and L40
were targeted because they are nuclear genes displaying two
alternative forms with the highest number of transcripts in
the library (Table S2 in Additional data file 2). The mitochondrial Cytb gene served as an independent reference for the
interpretation of results from nuclear genes. The three distinct forms of this strongly diverging mitochondrial gene
were surveyed in all the individuals tested (Figure 5c). Chætognaths are hermaphroditic and, after fertilization, they
store exogenous sperm in their sperm receptacles (Figure 5a),
which makes it possible to amplify the DNA from another
individual. Hence, in order to detect such contamination, we
performed independent amplifications on heads, which are
considered free from sperm contamination, as well as on the
rest of the body, which contained sperm receptacles (Figure
5a). The experimental design made it possible to detect alternative forms through the amplification of specific DNA fragments of distinct sizes (Figure 5b; Table S3 in Additional data
file 2). The PCR products were characterized by sequencing
and nucleotide polymorphism was subsequently carefully
examined. In addition to their nucleotide divergence in coding sequences, the distinct forms of nuclear genes for RPs L36
and L40 have alternative intron positions and lengths as well
as differences in their 5' and 3' UTR regions (Figure 5b).
Performed on nine individuals, the amplifications revealed
the presence of the two forms of the nuclear genes for RPs L36
and L40 in each individual (Table 2). Conversely, only one
form of the mitochondrial Cytb gene was amplified in each
individual with the exception of the body of individual 1,
which includes two forms, thus suggesting contamination by
exogenous sperm (Table 2). The amplification of the divergent nucleotide forms within one individual indicates that the
alternative nucleotide forms correspond to paralogous
nuclear copies originating through past gene duplication
events (Table 1). Conversely, the alternative forms of the
mitochondrial gene correspond to variation within the population. Because some genes, such as that encoding Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), do not present
paralogous copies despite their high expression levels (112
TCTP transcripts in the EST collection; Table S2 in Additional
data file 2), we addressed the extent of these duplications in
evaluating the quantity of duplicated genes. If the clusters of
transcripts encoding the same protein include all the tran-

Marlétaz et al. R94.8

scripts from alternative paralogous genes and if those paralogous genes have similar levels of expression, the probability
that transcripts from these paralogous genes are represented
in a given cluster is related to the size of this cluster (see Materials and methods). Hence, all the clusters that include more
than six transcripts have at least a 95% chance of including
transcripts from the two copies if they exist. Such clusters of
transcripts were all checked for paralogous copies through
sequence alignments and trees. Paralogs were detected
within 35 of the 66 clusters investigated, which suggests that
up to 69% of chætognath genes are the products of duplications. These paralogs could have arisen through either a
whole genome duplication (WGD) event followed by an
extensive gene loss, or several segmental duplication events.
The hypothesis of a WGD event is reinforced by the high
occurrence of RPs among duplicated genes (Table 1). The
trend to retain RP genes was previously observed after WGD
for Paramecium tetraurelia, yeast and plants [47-49] but is
not a common occurrence in small-scale duplications. Conversely, it is difficult to understand why the paralogous genes
have been retained after their duplication and maintained
under purifying selection as emphasized by Ka/Ks values.
This conclusion is in contradiction with the current view of
gene destiny after genome duplication, which alternatively
predicts that one of the gene duplicates is lost or undergoes
the accumulation of substitutions [50]. Using a genome-level
dataset, similar findings were made about the strongly duplicated genome of Paramecium where the retention of duplicated genes was accounted in part by dosage compensation
constraints [47].
The most plausible dating is that this duplication occurred
before the diversification of the major chætognath lineages.
Two copies of SSU and LSU were retrieved in members of the

phylum dispersed all over the tree of chætognaths [10-12].
Moreover, the survey of 226 ESTs available for Flaccisagitta
enflata also revealed the presence of alternative nucleotide
forms for some genes (data not shown), which would confirm
that the duplication is not limited to SSU/LSU genes at this
taxonomic scale. Further genome data would be required to
date the duplication, for instance, in considering the Ks distribution of the set of paralogs [51], and also to definitively state
the nature of the duplication through the analysis of synteny
in duplicated blocks of the genome. Nevertheless, this preliminary transcriptomic survey stresses the usefulness of the
chætognaths to study phylum-level genome duplication
events and the destiny of paralogous genes.

population. This finding definitely excludes the possibility of
cryptic speciation within this S. cephaloptera population.
Alternatively, the panmixy hypothesis was confirmed by the
unimodal distribution of pairwise divergences in mismatch
analysis, which is consistent with constant population size
and excludes a past hybridization event (Figure S6 in Additional data file 1). Finally, the distinct mitochondrial lineages
are spread within the population but they are not correlated
with any haplotype differentiation at the nuclear level, which
is a strong argument against the cryptic speciation hypothesis. This type of mitochondrial diversity was previously discovered for the planktonic species Sagitta setosa but was also
interpreted with difficulty [52].

Population genomics

Strikingly, these comparisons also highlighted molecular
divergence between the head and the body of some individuals for each of the five markers investigated (Figure 6 and
Additional data file 4). Such substitutions cannot be
explained by a heterozygous status of those individuals
because sequences from head and body were firmly clustered
in the tree (Figure 6). For example, individual 4 exhibits wellseparated alleles present in both head and body but intraindividual substitution took place between head and body for
both of these alleles (Figure 6c). This pattern of substitutions
may be explained by the occurrence of somatic mutations
during the life of individuals. This interpretation is corroborated by the large extent of intra-individual substitutions in
all marker genes and all individuals. Somatic mutations are
considered as rare conditions, mainly known from related
disorders in humans [53]. Less clear are the evolutionary
implications and putative benefits of this phenomenon [54].
They are sometimes suspected to play a prominent role in
apoptosis and possibly in the regulation of cell division [54].
Moreover, somatic mutations have been demonstrated to be
more widespread in Drosophila than in mammals [55], and
are sometimes correlated with extensive chromosome
rearrangement in the Drosophila lineage [56]. However, little
is known about the extent and importance of this process in
the non-model organisms. In the case of the chætognath,
somatic mutation could be due to the high mutation rates that
seem to affect both germline and soma and could explain the
divergence at the population and individual levels. The possible relationship of these accelerated mutation rates with
structural reshaping of the genome after duplication deserves
further evaluation.

Beyond the molecular divergence between the coding
sequences of duplicated paralogous genes, a subsequent survey of the genomic sequences of selected genes revealed that
the level of polymorphism is strong within each paralogous
gene (Table S4 in Additional data file 2). Multiple nucleotide
substitutions as well as insertion/deletion events (indels)
occurred within the introns of the four selected nuclear genes
(paralogous copies of the genes for both RPs L36 and L40;
Additional data files 11-14). Similarly, a large number of substitutions have accumulated in the various mitochondrial
genes, thus revealing distinct mitochondrial lineages within
the sampled population (Figure 5c; Figure S4 in Additional
data file 1). However, these strong levels of divergence remain
consistent with a population genetic structure because of the
regular AT composition and the limited degree of saturation
revealed by Ts/Tv ratios, singleton positions being essentially
transition substitutions (Table S4 in Additional data file 2;
Figure S6 in Additional data file 1).
We attempted to determine the origin of this population
genetic heterogeneity, which could, for instance, be due to a
cryptic speciation or to a past hybridization. For this, the
sequences of each individual were compared using phylogenetic trees and indels as discrete informative characteristics
(Figure 6). For each marker gene, individual sequences split
into several major clades supported by strong bootstrap and
discrete indel events, which allows unambiguous identification of heterozygous individuals (Figure 6). For example,
individual 4 is heterozygous for all markers and individuals 6,
9 and 3 are heterozygous for at least one marker. Moreover,
the occurrence of several cases of putative recombinations
between alleles highlights the heterozygous status of some
individuals (individuals 3 and 4, Figure 6b,d). Notably, our
PCR-based experimental design provided positive evidence
only for heterozygosis because two amplifications (head and
body) were carried out per individual, yielding 0.5 probability
to detect heterozygosity. Heterozygous individuals could thus
be even more abundant than observed. These heterozygous
cases convincingly demonstrate that a shuffling occurs
between the most divergent alleles of each gene, which constitutes strong evidence for interbreeding within the sampled

Notably, this level of somatic mutation generates a strong
background noise that hinders the accurate interpretation of
point mutations related to the diversity of haplotypes. Moreover, traditional hypotheses of population genetics are challenged by our findings: the genetic distances observed
between individuals of a single population reach species-level
without any evidence for cryptic speciation or past hybridization. In parallel, multiple mitochondrial lineages diverge and
are spread and maintained within a single population [52]. If
such features are revealed as more widespread than expected,

the data collected from numerous population genetic or phylogeographic studies require more cautious interpretation.
This observation pleads for an increase of the sampling depth
for population genetics, especially through genomic
approaches [57].

Trans-splicing transcript maturation in chætognaths
The survey of the chætognath EST collection detected a common 36 nucleotide motif shared at their 5' end between transcripts from unrelated genes. Selected cases showed that
these short motifs are absent from upstream genomic regions
of the genes (Figure 7c; Additional data files 15-17). These
findings strongly suggest that mRNA of S. cephaloptera

undergoes trans-splicing maturation. This mRNA processing
occurs through the spliceosomal transfer of a small RNA molecule at the 5' end of the mRNA from an independent splicedleader (SL) gene and has been described in numerous species
[26]. To exclude the possibility of an artifact, the 226 available EST sequences of F. enflata, another chætognath species,
were screened using the identified SL sequences from S.
cephaloptera. This survey led to the recovery of similar SL
sequences at the 5' end of several cDNA sequences. As F.
enflata and S. cephaloptera belong to the two main orders of
chætognaths [10], the trans-splicing mechanism is likely to be
present in the whole chætognath phylum.

The abundance of the forms corresponds to the rate of the forms among all SLs and is calculated only for S. cephaloptera sequences. A 'less-than' sign
indicates that the abundance is below 1%.

An extensive study of trans-splicing in the nematode phylum
has previously revealed the presence of different forms of SL
sequences [58]. Similarly, several different SL sequences
were retrieved from S. cephalotera (Table 3). This number is
consistent with the strong level of polymorphism previously
observed for coding sequences but two distinct SL forms
alone (SL1 and SL2) represent 87% of the SL sequences
(Table 3). These forms do not exhibit any specificity for the
different paralogs since SLs are added randomly to transcripts from these paralogs (Figure 7; Additional data files 5
and 6). In an attempt to understand the evolutionary history
of trans-splicing within the chætognath phylum, the SL forms
of F. enflata were compared with those of S. cephaloptera.
This set of chætognath SL sequences splits into four main
forms: two of them, SL1 and SL3, are present in both the species investigated whereas the two other forms, SL2 and SL4,
are specific for S. cephaloptera and F. enflata, respectively
(Table 3). Otherwise, neither of these chætognath SL forms

display similarity with the SL of another phyla. This finding
suggests that just as in nematodes, the evolution of alternative forms could have occurred at a relatively reduced taxonomic scale [58].
Within the EST collection, 2,914 sequences exhibit SL addition, which represents 30% of nuclear transcripts (Figure 8a).
Among the SL population, 72% are coding transcripts, of
which 46% have a homolog in SwissProt. The clustering of
similar coding trans-spliced transcripts indicated that 41% of
putative genes undergo SL addition. Furthermore, the relationship between trans-splicing and expression level was
tested through the comparison of the number of ESTs per
cluster of trans-spliced or non-trans-spliced transcripts. If we
posit that this number can be considered as an estimate of the
expression level, trans-spliced genes are significantly more
expressed than others (Wilcoxon rank test, p < 2.2e-16). For
instance, among the 50 more expressed genes (that is, biggest

Categories of trans-spliced transcripts for chætognath (a) S. cephaloptera and (b) nematode C. elegans. The presence of a SL sequence is related to coding

EST clusters), only two are not trans-spliced. These values
suggest that trans-splicing is involved in the regulation of a
set of strongly expressed genes responsible for key cellular
functions, for example, the RP set.
Hence, the set of trans-spliced genes of S. cephaloptera was
compared with those of other animals that carry out this RNA
maturation process (Table 4). Particularly, trans-splicing was
characterized in the nematode C. elegans model, for which a
large EST set is available [58,59]. These data were especially
useful for extensive comparisons with S. cephaloptera (Figure 8b). The amount of ESTs with a SL is slightly smaller in C.
elegans (22%) than in S. cephaloptera (29%) and transspliced transcripts are missing from the very reduced noncoding ESTs, only 5% of the total EST collection in C. elegans.
This comparison suggests that trans-splicing is at least as
widespread in S. cephaloptera as in C. elegans. Furthermore,
the set of genes affected by trans-splicing in S. cephaloptera
was comparable with those of C. elegans. Among the 119 different genes that are both trans-spliced and annotated using
SwissProt with high confidence, 79 have trans-spliced homologous genes in C. elegans (Additional data file 3). These
values do not include the 78 RP set, which are conserved and
trans-spliced in both species. While the molecular actors
involved in trans-splicing do not exhibit evolutionary conservation [26], the genes undergoing this kind of processing
could otherwise be similar in distantly related species.
Trans-splicing has been discovered in a set of organisms
spread all over the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes, but the
molecular actors involved in this RNA maturation process do
not exhibit any evolutionary conservation: the SL sequences
cannot be aligned and the ribonucleoproteic machineries

involved in this process have no homologs in other species
[26,37,60-62]. However, the discovery of SL trans-splicing in
new animal phyla strongly argues for an ancient origin of this
process, especially if these phyla have significant phylogenetic positions, such as chætognaths or acoels. Noticeably, we
also found evidence for SL addition in recently released ESTs
from the acoels (unpublished observations), worm-like animals that were recently excluded from the protostomes [30].
Moreover, an extensive comparison of available genomic data
revealed that the set of genes undergoing trans-splicing is
evolutionarily conserved between those species, which is
another indication of a putative common evolutionary origin
of trans-splicing (Additional data file 3 and Table 4).

Operonic transcription in S. cephaloptera
In the nematode chætognath C. elegans and the tunicate
Ciona intestinalis, polycistronic mRNA molecules that contain two or more genes are transcribed from operon structures and subsequently resolved by trans-splicing [58,59]. We
mined for similar eukaryotic operons in our pool of
sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) in looking
for clusters of genes with the same transcription orientation
and very short intergenic regions. The trans-splicing maturation of these putative operons was confirmed by mapping the
tran-spliced ESTs onto these genomic sequences. One operon
including RP S14 and PCNA genes was successfully identified
in the BAC 35A21 that otherwise contains a large number of
genes undergoing trans-splicing (Figure 7a; Table S5 in Additional data file 2; Additional data files 15-17). EST mapping
and ab initio gene prediction suggested that only three bases
separate the polyadenylation site of the upstream RP S14
gene from the acceptor splice site at the PCNA downstream
gene. This distance is even shorter than that in C. intestinalis

operons [61] and clearly excludes the possibility for a re-initiation of transcription between the genes (Figure 7c). This
BAC sequence contains several other predicted genes that are
closely clustered, share the same orientation and could thus
belong to operonic structures (Figure 7; Table S5 in Additional data file 2). The transcripts of gene RP S14 include the
two major SL 1 or 2 forms (Figure 7c). Similarly, transcripts
from both paralogous copies of duplicated genes bear any of
the alternative SL forms. Hence, contrary to C. elegans for
which a SL form is specific for the upstream and the downstream genes in operons [58], no specificity of the SL for gene
position in the operon was recovered in S. cephaloptera (Figure 7).
Hence, we have provided arguments for polycistronic transcription in another animal phylum, the chætognaths. Animal
operons have previously been described in the nematodes
and in the tunicate C. intestinalis and were often interpreted
as an adaptation to the genome size reduction observed in
both these organisms [26]. However, the genome size of S.
cephaloptera is rather large at 1.05 Gb [63] and the transcriptome of chætognaths is conserved among bilaterians, in terms
of gene similarity and content. Furthermore, extensive study
of genes co-transcribed in C. elegans led to the conclusion
that the operons constitute functional units in grouping genes
involved in similar pathways [59]. Hence, the presence of
operonic transcription in the chætognath, a basal protostome, strongly suggests that this mechanism should be more
likely considered as an original mode of gene regulation,
whose evolutionary importance may have been underestimated. Thanks to the pivotal comparative genomic abilities of
chætognaths, the comparison of operon structure and content between nematodes and chætognaths should allow the
extension of the functional results obtained in C. elegans to a
larger set of organisms, including vertebrates. Such an
approach would require further genomic data in the chætognath but will likely lead to the characterization of new gene

regulatory networks, potentially leading to a better understanding of some genetic disorders [59].

Conclusion

Chætognaths have been formerly known for their peculiar
morphological characteristics. The fine-scale analysis of transcriptomic data reported here illuminates significant genomic
features of this phylum, strengthening its very original status
among bilaterians. These genome features may be shuffled
into opposite categories: shared ancestral characteristics of
bilaterians on one hand and lineage-specific rearrangements
and divergences on the other. First, the chætognath transcriptome bears a core set of genes conserved within bilaterians. Together with recent evidence from lophotrochozoans
such as annelids [64], this result confirms that the extensive
gene loss previously observed within insects or nematodes
cannot be extended to the whole protostome lineage. The conservation of such a core gene set was exploited for phylogenomic inference through the definition of RP genes as highgrade marker genes for phylogeny. Subsequent analyses of
these marker genes confirmed the basal position of chætognaths among protostomes, a position that has been previously
supported [18,30,43]. This position strongly impacts on the
understanding of the evolution of embryological characteristics since it rejects some developmental characteristics at the
stem of bilaterians, such as enterocoely or secondary mouth
opening that were considered to be deuterostome-specific.
This interpretation can be extended to the new genome-level
characteristics that we have highlighted here. For example,
the trans-splicing mechanism of mRNA processing as well as
the operonic transcription depicted here were often interpreted as a secondary evolved condition related to peculiar
adaptations in animals such as nematodes or tunicates [26].
Contrarily, the occurrence of these mechanisms in chætognaths and acoels suggests that their evolutionary origins may
be more ancient than originally expected. Together, these

findings strongly argue for the relevance of chætognaths as a
comparative genomics model because of their conserved gene
set, their original phylogenetic position and their original features such as trans-splicing and operonic transcription. For
example, the study of chætognath operons could be a promising approach to identify molecular pathways involved in
human genetic diseases [59].
Some genetic and genomic features of chætognaths we have
illustrated here are unique among the animals. We have discovered a genome duplication event followed by a high retention of duplicated genes that were maintained under strong
purifying selection. The current view of the evolution of duplicated genes in animals or plants mainly predicts a loss of
genes that have not evolved novel functions [50,65]. This view
is contradicted by recent evidence from protists [47], plants
[25] and the whole fungal kingdom [66] that suggests new
modalities of genome evolution and, in particular, strong
retention and constraint of former duplicated genes. Hence,
the chætognath genome duplication deserves further documentation and investigation as one possible special case
among bilaterians. Another unique feature of chætognaths is
the high level of divergence within the population. We demonstrated that this divergence is related to neither cryptic
speciation nor past hybridization but conversely revealed
very high mutation rates within the germ line of individuals
but also within their soma. These observations have deep
implications for the correct interpretation of numerous
population genetics studies. This apparent genome plasticity
with duplications and high mutation rates is in contrast to the
strong morphological conservation of the phylum that has
continued nearly unchanged since the early Cambrian period
[8,9]. This uncoupling between morphological conservation
and genome plasticity makes us wonder how the gene regulatory networks responsible for the establishment of the body
organization of these animals could have remained stable
despite such a genome dynamic?
In summary, these findings promote the study of chætognath
for orienting not only morphological but also genomic characteristics among bilaterians. With the recent rise of lophotrochozoans as promising model systems [67], the
chætognath phylum represents the next step of investigation
within protostomes with its striking combination of distinct
ancestral and derived features that could illuminate the evolution of bilaterians.

Materials and methods
cDNA library and EST sequencing
The juvenile-staged cDNA library of S. cephaloptera, Bush
1851 was previously described in [18]. Briefly, polyA+ RNAs
were isolated from hatchling to one-day-old juveniles collected in the coastal area near Marseille (Le Brusc, La Ciotat).
After reverse transcription and selection of longer transcripts
by size fractionation, cDNAs were cloned into Lambda Tri-

plex 2 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). There were
12,324 clones sequenced from a 5' primer at Génoscope (CNS,
France). A total of 390 sequences were discarded due to vector contamination or cloning artifacts, yielding a total 11,934
sequences.

BAC library
The BAC library was constructed by BioS&T Inc. (Montreal,
Québec, Canada) in the pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre,
Madison, WI, USA) from adult S. cephalotera genomic DNA.
Average insert size is 135 kb. The library was arrayed and
selected clones were sequenced using a shotgun approach at
Génoscope.

Analysis of the EST collection
The sequences were annotated through Blast searches [68]
against SwissProt and TrEMBL databases. The transcripts
were searched for reliable coding sequences using ESTScan
and subsequently sorted into coding and non-coding
sequences [69]. Transcripts from the same putative genes
were grouped into clusters using CLOBB [70]. The functional
Gene Ontology classification was retrieved from SwissProt
matches using Fatigo [71]. Transcripts that bear splice-leader
at their 5' extremity were searched with Blastn using the SL
sequences obtained from a preliminary screen. Data parsing
processes were conducted using Perl scripting language and
the Bioperl resource [72].

Databases and searches for marker genes
The set of databases compared with the chætognath transcriptome includes the transcriptomes of D. melanogaster
and H. sapiens downloaded from Ensembl [73]. The partial
transcriptome of Lumbricus rubellus as well as clade-level
EST databases were obtained from the NCBI EST database
using appropriate keywords [74]. The recently released
genomes of several lophotrochozoans (Capitella capitata,
Helobdella robusta, Lottia gigantea, Aplysia californica,
Schmidtea mediterranea and Schistosoma mansoni) were
accessed directly on the JGI web site [75] or retrieved from
the NCBI trace archive [76]. The respective scores were visualized using Simitri [77].

Duplicated gene detection
All the transcript sequences encoding similar protein coding
sequences were clustered on the basis of a similar SwissProt
hit or a reciprocal blast hit after conceptual translation by
ESTScan [69]. Gene clusters were analyzed using Clustalw
alignment, phylogenetic analyses and visual checking for the
inclusion of potential diverging sequences (Table S1 in Additional data file 2). The minimal EST number (N) per cluster to
detect the occurrence of two duplicated paralogous sequences
at a 5% probability is 6 as estimated by 1 - 2(1/2)N. Ka/Ks were
computed using PAML [78].

Phylogenetic analyses
The RP dataset was built using a composite database
approach so as to select the least divergent sequences for each
taxon [18]. The species set involved in each taxon as well as
the data on missing sequences are available in Table S1 in
Additional data file 2. This dataset was analyzed using the
CAT model as implemented in Phylobayes [79]. Maximumlikelihood and Bayesian inferences were performed using
PhyML [80], Treefinder [81] and MrBayes [82], respectively,
and both assumed a WAG+Γ4+I model. For bayesian analyses (MrBayes and Phylobayes), at least two chains were
launched, their convergence was verified and the corresponding burn-in period discarded.

PCR amplifications of duplicated markers
The individuals of S. cephaloptera employed for polymorphism analysis were collected across the Posidonia seagrass,
in the calanque of Sormiou, in the coastal area near Marseille,
France. Copies of nuclear RP S36 and RP L40 and mitochondrial Cytb genes were amplified by PCR using allele-specific
primers (Table S3 in Additional data file 2). Genomic DNA
extractions were carried out on heads and bodies of S. cephaloptera individuals from the calanque of Sormiou using the
Wizard SV Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and PCR reactions were carried out using GoTaq polymerase (Promega).
PCR conditions were defined according to the melting temperature determined for each pair of primers. Fragments
were subsequently gel-purified, cloned in pGEM-T easy
(Promega) and sequenced. PCR artifacts were excluded by
two approaches: first, amplifications were performed on head
and body of the same individual, which allows checking of the
congruence between the sequences; then, the accuracy of
DNA polymerase was verified by amplifying and sequencing
cloned DNA. These validations were confirmed by the recovery of the amplified sequences in the EST library and by the
high levels of substitutions between sequences, which are too
large to be interpreted as PCR artifacts.

Population genetic analyses
Pairwise sequence comparisons and molecular evolution
analyses were performed with Mega2 software assuming the
kimura 2 parameters model [83]. The demographic history of
the populations was evaluated by mismatch analyses using
Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D neutrality test implemented in
DNAsp software [84].

Accession numbers
The set of sequences analyzed in this paper has been deposited in GenBank with the following accession numbers:
CU555081-CU563075 and CU693608-CU693592 for the
11,934 ESTs, CU672232 for the BAC 35YA21, and EU529890EU529968 for the sequences of RP L36 and L40 paralogs in
nine individuals (Table 2).
