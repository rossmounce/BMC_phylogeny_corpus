Abstract
Amino acid sequence analyses indicate that the Soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) 19K protein
is a cysteine-rich protein (CRP) and shares sequence homology with CRPs derived from furo-,
hordei-, peclu- and tobraviruses. Since the hordei- and pecluvirus CRPs were shown to be
pathogenesis factors and/or suppressors of RNA silencing, experiments were conducted to
determine if the SBWMV 19K CRP has similar activities. The SBWMV 19K CRP was introduced
into the Potato virus X (PVX) viral vector and inoculated to tobacco plants. The SBWMV 19K CRP
aggravated PVX-induced symptoms and restored green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression to
GFP silenced tissues. These observations indicate that the SBWMV 19K CRP is a pathogenicity
determinant and a suppressor of RNA silencing.

Background
Viruses survive in their hosts either by evading or countering host defenses. Viral evasion is a passive mechanism by
which viruses overwhelm host defenses, or invade organs
or cells where the host defenses cannot reach them. The
ability of a virus to counter host defenses requires an
active mechanism to either bypass or disarm the host
machinery. Viruses invading vertebrate hosts produce
virokines and viroceptors which interact with immune
response molecules to inhibit or modulate their anti-viral
activities [1,2]. Recent studies have shown many viruses
infecting a wide range of eukaryotic hosts encode proteins
that suppress the RNA silencing, anti-viral defense
response [3-6]. Silencing suppressors encoded by viruses
limit degradation of viral RNAs by the RNA silencing
machinery. Among plant viruses, some silencing suppres-

sor proteins also affect symptom development and
increase virus titer. The Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b,
the Tobacco etch virus (TEV) HC-Pro, and the Tomato bushy
stunt virus (TBSV) P19 [7-10] proteins are among the best
studied silencing suppressors that are also pathogenicity
determinants. The TBSV P19 protein was unique because
it affects disease severity in a host specific manner [11,12].
Little is known about the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of silencing suppressor proteins. In particular,
viruses belonging to the genera Furo-, Hordei-, Tobra-,
Peclu-, Beny-, Carla-, and Pomovirus encode small cysteinerich proteins (CRPs) near the 3' ends of their genomes,
and some have been identified as both silencing suppressor proteins and pathogenicity factors. For example, the
Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV; a hordeivirus) gamma b

protein and the Peanut clump virus (PCV; a pecluvirus) 15K
protein suppress RNA silencing, modulate symptom
severity, and systemic virus accumulation [13-16]. The
Tobacco rattle virus (TRV; a tobravirus) 16K CRP has been
described as a pathogenicity factor and suppresses RNA
silencing [17]. In complementation studies, the Soilborne
wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV; a furovirus) 19K CRP, the
BSMV gamma b protein, and the CMV 2b (which is not a
CRP) protein functionally replaced the 16K CRP of TRV
[15]. Since deletion of the TRV 16K CRP ORF reduced
virus accumulation in plants, functional replacement by
these heterologous viral ORFs indicates that these CRPs
share some common function. Characterizing the functional similarities among these CRPs is crucial to understanding their evolutionary relationship. Until now the
phylogenetic relationships among these CRPs are unclear
[18].
This study was undertaken to characterize the SBWMV
19K CRP. SBWMV is a bipartite RNA virus and is the type
member for the genus Furovirus [19]. RNA1 encodes the
viral replicase and putative viral movement protein (MP).
The viral replicase is encoded by a single large open reading frame (ORF) and is phylogenetically related to the
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase [20]. The 3' proximal
ORF of RNA1 encodes a 37K MP that shares sequence similarity with the dianthovirus MP [21,22]. SBWMV RNA2
encodes four proteins. The 5' proximal ORF of RNA2
encodes a 25K protein from a nonAUG start codon [23]
and its role in virus infection is unknown. The coat protein (CP) ORF has an opal translational termination
codon and readthrough of this codon produces a large
84K protein [23]. The CP readthrough domain (RT) is
required for plasmodiophorid transmission of the virus
[24]. The 3' proximal ORF of RNA2 encodes a 19K CRP.
To gain insight into the role of the SBWMV 19K CRP in
virus infection, amino acid sequence comparisons were
conducted to determine the relatedness of the SBWMV
19K CRP to other viral CRPs. The Potato virus X (PVX)
infectious clone was used to express the SBWMV CRP and
to study its role in virus pathogenicity and suppressing
RNA silencing.

Results
SBWMV 19K protein is a conserved CRP
The Pfam Protein Families Database reports a family of
CRPs with similar sequences which includes proteins
from BSMV, PSLV, PCV and SBWMV (Pfam 04521.5).
Since there are viruses not included in the Pfam report
that encode CRPs, this study was undertaken to determine
if there is a larger CRP family containing related viral proteins. Further examination in this study reveals that the
CRPs encoded by all known hordei-, peclu- and furoviruses share significant sequence similarity (Fig. 1). Efforts

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/18

to find similarity between these proteins and CRPs
encoded by pomo-, beny- and potyviruses were not successful. Whether these other plant viral CRPs are also suppressors of silencing can not be concluded at this point for
two reasons: insufficient study and only weak sequence
similarity relationships. Sequences of CRPs that affect
virus replication and are encoded by members of other
virus genera were also determined to be unrelated [25].
The SBWMV 19K protein is a CRP because it contains nine
Cys residues [20]. Seven of these Cys residues are conserved in all furovirus proteins and are located in the Nterminal half of the protein. Five of these residues are
within the block of sequences designated as protein family Pfam04521.5 and three of the conserved Cys residues
are also conserved in the hordeiviral and pecluviral proteins. A selection from this alignment was corrected for
several misplacements of short peptide sequences and is
shown in Figure 1. The alignment represents the entire
length of these proteins, although the termini are aligned
with less confidence than the core. Examination of the
tobraviral CRP sequences revealed sufficient similarity to
justify their alignment with the Pfam04521.5 sequences.
The alignment resulted in a significance score between 6
and 7, suggesting that the tobraviral proteins belong to
this family.
The multiple sequence alignment of 33 CRPs from furo-,
tobra-, peclu-, and hordeiviruses (Fig. 1) revealed three
absolutely conserved residues: Cys70, Cys112, and
His116 (numbering based on the aligned sequences).
Gly113 was conserved in all viruses (except TRV-CAN)
and is contained within a Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His motif in
which one of the two Xaa residues is Lys or Arg. There is a
Cys residue at position 7, 8 or 9 which is conserved in all
except PCV and IPCV (pecluvirus) amino acid sequences.
Alignment of the N-terminus is not exact since the PCV
and IPCV proteins are N-terminally truncated. Within the
N-terminal half, there are additional positions containing
Cys residues that are conserved for some but not all
viruses. For example, Cys9 is conserved among hordei-,
tobra-, and some furoviruses; Cys at position 32 and 33 is
conserved among all but pecluviruses; Cys36 is conserved
among hordei- and furoviruses; Cys45 is conserved
among furo and tobraviruses; Cys76 is conserved among
furo and tobraviruses (except for SCSV; the pecluvirus
PCV, but not IPCV, also has Cys76); Cys80 is conserved
among all viruses except PeRSV and PEBV. Lys at position
52 and Arg at position 54 or 55 (Lys-Xaa-Arg or Lys-XaaXaa-Arg) are conserved among all except PSLV. Gly at
position 77 is conserved among all except tobraviruses.
The secondary structure prediction derived from the multiple sequence alignment is a long helical region extending from or slightly beyond the Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His

motif to within 20 residues of the C-terminus. The furoviral proteins have spacings of conserved Leu residues from
positions 89 to 106 consistent with a leucine zipper structure (which was not apparent in the original Pfam
04521.5). The N-terminal halves of the aligned amino
acid sequences, containing most of the Cys residues, have
a mixture of extended, helical and loop predicted
structures.
The pecluviruses PCV and IPCV, and the hordeiviruses
BSMV, LyRSV, and PSLV proteins contain a Ser-Lys-Leu
sequence at the C-terminus. This tripeptide was shown for

PCV to be a peroxisomal targeting signal [16]. This signal
is not present in CRPs of furo- or tobraviruses.
SBWMV 19K CRP aggravates PVX-induced symptoms
The tobravirus and hordeivirus CRPs have been described
as pathogenicity determinants that regulate symptom
severity in infected plants [15]. Since the SBWMV 19K
protein is a similar CRP, experiments were conducted to
determine if it also has an effect on symptom expression.
The SBWMV 19K ORF was inserted into the PVX genome
and PVX.19K infectious transcripts were used to inoculate
N. benthamiana, N. clevelandii, C. quinoa, and C.

Immunoblot and northern analyses were conducted to
verify PVX accumulation in the upper leaves of N. benthamiana plants. Immunoblot analysis was conducted using
anti-PVX CP serum. High levels of PVX CP was detected in
plants that were systemically infected with PVX.GFP (Fig.
3A lanes 1â4) and PVX.19K (Fig. 3A lanes 5â8). The
SBWMV 19K CRP had no obvious effect on PVX accumulation in upper noninoculated leaves. Viral RNA accumulation was analyzed by northern blot and high levels of
genomic RNA was detected in the upper leaves of
PVX.GFP (Figure 3B lanes 2â4) and PVX.19K (Fig. 3B
lanes 5â8) inoculated plants. Thus, the SBWMV 19K CRP
did not seem to have a deleterious effect on PVX accumulation. RT-PCR was used to verify that the SBWMV 19K
ORF was maintained in the PVX genome in systemically
infected plants. RNA samples taken from the upper leaves
of N. benthamiana plants which were used for northern
analysis, were also used in RT-PCR reactions to verify the
presence of the SBWMV 19K ORF in the PVX genome. In
all samples it appeared that the SBWMV 19K CRP was stably maintained in the PVX genome (data not shown).

amaranticolor leaves (Fig. 2). As a control, plants were also
inoculated with PVX.GFP, which has the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) gene inserted into the viral genome. The
spread of PVX.GFP expression was monitored using a
handheld UV lamp to monitor GFP expression and verify
systemic virus accumulation (data not shown).
Symptoms were first observed in plants inoculated with
PVX.GFP and PVX.19K between 10 and 14 dpi. By 21 dpi,
systemic necrosis was evident in N. benthamiana and N.
clevelandii plants inoculated with PVX.19K (Fig. 2A, B and
2D) while PVX.GFP infected plants showed systemic
mosaic symptoms (Fig. 2A and 2C). N. benthamiana
plants infected with PVX.19K were clearly stunted in comparison to plants infected with PVX.GFP (Fig. 2A). The
PVX.19K infected N. clevelandii leaves collapsed by 21 dpi
(Fig. 2D).

PVX.19K produced large necrotic lesions in the C. quinoa
and C. amaranticolor leaves. Local lesions were detected in
plants inoculated with PVX.GFP or PVX.19K between 5
and 7 dpi. PVX.19K-inoculated C. quinoa plants showed
severe necrotic local lesions (Fig. 2E). The necrotic lesions
gradually merged and the infected tissue eventually collapsed. PVX.19K-inoculated C. amaranticolor leaves
showed enlarged chlorotic lesions advancing to necrotic
lesions over time (Fig. 2F). PVX.GFP-inoculated C. quinoa
leaves showed small chlorotic and necrotic local lesions
while PVX.GFP-inoculated C. amaranticolor leaves showed
mild flecks (Fig. 2F). Association of PVX.GFP with the
local lesions was verified using a hand held UV lamp (data
not shown).
SBWMV 19K CRP is a suppressor of RNA silencing
In this study we employed a widely used "reversal of
silencing assay" to determine if the SBWMV 19K CRP is a
suppressor of RNA silencing in plants [28]. In this assay,
GFP-expression in the 16C transgenic N. benthamiana
plants (Fig. 4B) was silenced by infiltrating young leaves
with a suspension of Agrobacterium expressing GFP. The
progression of GFP silencing was viewed first locally and
then systemically using a hand held UV lamp. Within two
weeks, the spread of GFP silencing was viewed systemically (Fig. 4C) and by three weeks, the only visible fluorescence is red fluorescence due to chlorophyll (Fig. 4D). At
this time, the silenced plants were inoculated with
PVX.19K. As PVX.19K viruses spread locally and then systemically, there was no change in GFP expression in the
inoculated leaves or in the upper leaves (Fig. 4E). However, GFP expression was observed in the emerging leaves
(Fig. 4F â H). The SBWMV 19K CRP prevented RNA

silencing only in emerging leaves where RNA silencing
had not developed prior to virus infection. As a control,
plants were also inoculated with PVX.GUS following infiltration with Agrobacterium. There was no evidence of GFP
expression in the inoculated, mature, or new emerging
leaves. The silencing phenotype was unaffected by
PVX.GUS.
Northern analyses was conducted to confirm RNA silencing in the upper leaves of Agrobacterium-infiltrated leaves
and in the plants inoculated with PVX.GUS (Fig. 4I and
4J). GFP specific RNAs were detected in transgenic plants
(Figure 4I lanes 4â7) and emerging leaves of plants
injected with Agrobacterium and inoculated with PVX.19K
(Figure 4J lanes 1â4). GFP specific RNAs were not
detected in untreated nontransgenic plants (Figure 4I
lanes 1â3) or in plants that were injected with Agrobacterium and inoculated with PVX.GUS (lanes 4â8). RNA
samples collected from non silenced and silenced plants
were also tested by Northern analysis to confirm the systemic accumulation of PVX.GUS or PVX.19K (data not
shown). Since, GFP expression was restored in plants systemically infected with PVX.19K but remained silenced in
plants inoculated with PVX.GUS, it is likely that the
SBWMV 19K ORF is a suppressor of RNA silencing.

Discussion
Many viruses encode proteins that suppress RNA silencing
but the phylogenetic relatedness of these proteins is
poorly understood. In this study, one class of viral CRPs,
which were described as suppressors of RNA silencing
and/or viral pathogenicity determinants, were shown to
be phylogenetically related. These CRPs have a conserved
Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His motif in which one of the two Xaa
residues is Lys or Arg. The N-terminus has several conserved Cys residues that likely comprise a zinc finger
motif. In fact, the ability of the gamma b protein of BSMV
to bind Zn(II) was recently demonstrated [25].
Prior to 1999, SBWMV, BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV belonged
to the genus Furovirus. As sequence data from different
furoviruses have become available, it became clear that
there are significant differences in the genome organization of these viruses, and therefore furovirus classification
was revised in 1999 [19]. The genus Furovirus now consists
of viruses similar in genome organization to SBWMV [29].
These viruses are bipartite and have a single MP that is
phylogenetically related to the tobamovirus and dianthovirus MPs [20,22]. BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV were reclassified into the genera Benyvirus, Pecluvirus, and Pomovirus,
respectively, for two reasons [19,29]. First, the MPs of
these viruses are phylogenetically distinct from SBWMV.
BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV each possess a cluster of three
slightly overlapping ORFs known as the "triple gene
block", which has been shown for BNYVV [30] to mediate

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/18

viral cell-to-cell movement. Second, benyviruses and
pomoviruses differ from furoviruses in the number of
genome segments. BNYVV has four or five genome segments while PMTV has three genome segments [31].
Pecluviruses like furoviruses have two genome segments,
thus the primary difference between these virus genera is
the MP ORFs [32]. This is significant because the initial
amino acid sequence comparisons of CRPs from furo-,
hordei-, tobra-, and carlaviruses included BNYVV as the
type-member of the genus Furovirus and concluded that
these small CRPs were unrelated [33]. Reclassification of
the BNYVV as a member of the genus Benyvirus and inclusion of new members into the genus Furovirus led us to
reexamine the relatedness of the viral CRPs. Based on the
most recently defined taxonomic structure, the current
amino acid sequence comparison presented in Figure 1
indicates that the CRPs derived from viruses of the genera
Furo-, Hordei-, Peclu-, and Tobravirus are phylogenetically
related. On the other hand, these proteins are so different
from CRPs encoded by Pomo-, Beny- and Carlaviruses that
the latter ones could not be included in the alignment (Fig
1).
The present study shows that the SBWMV 19K CRP, when
expressed from the PVX genome, functions as a pathogenesis factor and a suppressor of RNA silencing. The SBWMV
19K CRP, when it was expressed from the PVX genome,
induced systemic necrosis on Nicotiana benthamiana, N.
clevelandii, C. quinoa, and C. amaranticolor. These symptoms are distinct from the symptoms associated with PVX
infection in these hosts, and from symptoms induced by
SBWMV in its natural hosts. In systemic hosts, both PVX
and SBWMV typically cause mosaic symptoms that range
from mild to severe. In C. quinoa and C. amaranticolor
both PVX and SBWMV cause mild chlorosis. Severe necrosis and ultimate collapse of the tissue has been reported
for other unrelated viral proteins that are pathogenicity
factors and suppressors of RNA silencing. This include the
Poa semilatent virus (PSLV) gamma b, TBSV P19, Tobacco
etch virus HC-Pro, and the Rice yellow mottle virus P1
proteins[7,11,14,34].
When we introduced the SBWMV 19K ORF into the TBSV
vector and inoculated it to N. benthamiama, N. tabacum, C.
quinoa, and C. amaranticolor (data not shown) plants, the
SBWMV 19K CRP did not have any effect on symptomology (data not shown). However, it was reported
previously that protein expression levels from the TBSV
vector might be too low to test the effects of heterologous
proteins on symptom severity [35]. Since an antibody to
the SBWMV 19K CRP is unavailable, the levels of protein
expression from PVX or TBSV vectors could not be analyzed to determine if gene dosage or protein expression
levels contribute to symptom severity.

In a related study, the SBWMV 19K and the BSMV gamma
b CRPs could substitute for the TRV 16K CRP within the
TRV genome, promoting virus replication and systemic
accumulation [15]. The ability of the SBWMV 19K and the
BSMV gamma b CRPs to induce severe symptoms when
expressed from the PVX genome is reminiscent of phenomena described in relation to viral synergisms. The best
studied viral synergism is between Tobacco etch virus (TEV)
and PVX in which the TEV HC-Pro protein enhances accumulation and disease severity of PVX [34]. HC-Pro promotes infection of PVX by suppressing the anti-viral RNA
silencing defense mechanism that would normally act on
PVX to reduce virus infection. HC-Pro has the ability to
increase PVX accumulation in the same way the SBWMV
19K CRP and the BSMV gamma b proteins were shown
previously to enhance accumulation of TRV in infected
plants [15].

Conclusion
The phylogenetic relatedness of the hordei-, peclu-, and
furovirus CRPs is further substantiated by evidence that
these proteins are all capable of suppressing RNA silencing in emerging leaves. This was demonstrated in the
present and related studies using the same reversal of
silencing assay used in this study. The SBWMV 19K CRP,
the BSMV and PSLV gamma b CRPs, and the PCV 15K
CRPs were each unable to change GFP expression in leaves
where GFP was silenced prior to virus infection. However
in each case, GFP expression occurred in newly emerging
leaves [14,16]. Thus, members of this family of CRPs similarly act on the RNA silencing machinery to block spread
of the silencing signal into newly emerging leaves. In each
case, the silencing suppressor activities of these CRPs have
been compared to CMV and potyviruses in preventing
onset of RNA silencing in new growth [14,16]. While
there is no evidence that the hordei-, peclu- and furovirus
CRPs are related to the CMV or potyvirus silencing suppressors, it seems that the mode of action might be conserved among diverse viruses.

Methods
Amino acid sequence comparisons
Related protein sequences were identified and retrieved
from the NCBI data bank using PSI-BLAST. A PSI-BLAST
search was launched with the amino acid sequence of the
19K CRP of Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV, a furovirus). A similar search began with the amino acid sequence
of BSMV gamma b, a sequence recovered in the CWMV
search. Both searches converged at the second iteration
and retrieved the same set of 22 sequences. This set contained CRPs derived from furo-, peclu- and hordeiviruses
and contained the conserved P18 PFAM domain ("protein
family"URL reference http://pfam.wustl.edu/[36].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/18

A preliminary alignment of the retrieved proteins
sequences was performed using the multiple sequence
alignment mode of ClustalX. These twenty two furovirus
and hordeivirus sequences were aligned using ClustalX
alignments suggested in the BLAST outputs and PFAM.
The tobraviral CRPs were not recovered by the above procedure, but upon manual inspection, appeared to have
Cys residues in a linear arrangement that was similar to
the set of 22 proteins. Eleven tobraviral protein sequences,
exclusive members of a conserved domain in the Conserved Domain database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml were aligned using ClustalX [37].
This tobraviral amino acid sequence alignment and the
alignment of the 22 amino acid sequences sequences were
assembled by ClustalX in profile mode, followed by manual adjustment. Amino acid sequences of aligned furoand hordeiviral proteins were aligned with tobraviral
amino acid sequences in profile mode of ClustalX (a total
of thirty three sequences were aligned). A total of 33
amino acid sequences were aligned. In all cases, adjustments to the alignments were made using Se-Al [38]. Significance scores for the alignment of the two groups of
protein sequences were calculated as previously described,
using a structural conservation matrix, SCM2, for scoring
[39].
Plasmids and bacterial strain
All plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain
JM109 [40]. The plasmids pPVX.GFP is an infectious viral
clone and contains a bacteriophage T7 promoter [39]. The
pPVX.GFP plasmid contains the PVX genome and the GFP
adjacent to a duplicated CP subgenomic promoter. The
plasmid pHST2-14 contains the TBSV genome and a
mutation in the TBSV P19 ORF eliminating expression of
a protein that suppresses RNA silencing [10,42]. The plasmid pTBSV.GFP contains GFP inserted into the TBSV
genome replacing the viral CP ORF [10].

The SBWMV 19K CRP ORF was inserted into the PVX.GFP
genome, replacing the GFP ORF. The 19K CRP ORF was
reverse transcribed and PCR amplified from purified
SBWMV RNA using a forward primer (GCG GGG ATC
GAT ATG TCT ACT GTT GGT TTC CAC) containing added
sequences encoding a ClaI restriction site (underlined)
and a reverse primer (CGC GTC GAC TCA CAA AGA GGA
TAT CTT CTT TGG C) containing sequences encoding a
SalI restriction site (underlined). PCR products and
pPVX.GFP plasmids were digested with ClaI and SalI and
then were ligated to prepare pPVX.19K.
In vitro transcription and plant inoculations
In vitro transcription reactions contained: 0.25 Âµg of linearized DNA, 5 Âµl of 5X T7 transcription buffer, 1.0 Âµl of
0.1 M DTT, 0.5 Âµl of SUPERaseÂ·Inâ¢ ribonuclease inhibitor (20 U/ Âµl) (Ambion, Austin, TX), 2.5 Âµl of an NTP

mixture containing 5 mM ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP (Pharmacia-Pfizer, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), 0.7 Âµl of T7
polymerase (Ambion), and nuclease-free water to a final
volume of 25 Âµl. The reactions were incubated for one and
a half hour at 37Â°C [10].
Nicotiana benthamiana, N. clevelandii, Chenopodium quinoa,
and C. amaranticolor plants were inoculated with infectious transcripts to study disease severity. Four plants, two
leaves per plant, were inoculated in each experiment.
Experiments were repeated at least three times. Ten Âµl of
undiluted PVX.GFP or PVX.19K transcripts were rub-inoculated to each plant.
The transgenic N. benthamiana line 16C was used to study
RNA silencing. This line is homozygous for the GFP transgene at a single locus [44]. Plants were inoculated with
transcripts following infiltration with Agrobacterium (see
below).
Agrobacterium infiltration of leaves
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 (pCH32) carrying
a binary plasmid expressing GFP from a Cauliflower mosaic
virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was used to silence GFP
expression in N. benthamiana line 16C. Agrobacterium cultures were grown overnight at 28Â°C in 5 ml of L-broth
medium containing 5 Âµg/ml of tetracycline and 50 Âµg/ml
of kanamycin. This 5 ml culture was used to inoculate 50
ml L-broth and grown overnight in medium containing 5
Âµg/ml tetracycline, 50 Âµg/ml kanamycin, 10 mM MES,
and 20 ÂµM acetosyringone. Cultures of Agrobacterium containing GFP were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a solution containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
MES, and 150 ÂµM acetosyringone. The final concentration
of Agrobacterium was 0.5 OD600. The suspension was left
at room temperature for 2â3 hours and then loaded into
a 2 ml syringe. The syringe was used to infiltrate the suspension into the underside of the leaf.
Visualization of GFP
A hand-held model B-100 BLAK-RAY long wave ultraviolet lamp (Ultraviolet Products, Upland, CA) was used to
monitor GFP expression in 16C plants infiltrated with
Agrobacterium and in PVX.GFP inoculated plants. GFP fluorescence was recorded with a Sony Digital Still Camera
model DSC-F717 (Sony Corporation of America, New
York City, New York). In all plants analyzed, GFP expression was monitored every 3 days for up to 21 days post
inoculation (dpi) or post infiltration with Agrobacterium.
Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblot analyses were conducted according to [40].
Total protein from uninfected and infected N. benthamiana leaves was extracted in 1:10 (w/v) grinding buffer
(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.50, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/18

400 mM sucrose, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol). Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10
min. Equal volumes of supernatants and protein loading
buffer (2 % SDS, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH
6.8, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10 % glycerol) were
mixed and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was carried out for
1 h at 200 V using 30 Âµl of each sample and 12.5% SDS PAGE and the Biorad Mini-Protean 3 system (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred to
PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) at 4Â°C overnight using protein transfer buffer
(39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris base, 0.037% SDS, and 20%
methanol, pH 8.3) and a BioRad Trans-Blot system (BioRad Laboratories). Immunoblot analyses were conducted
using the ECL-Plus Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp.). PVX CP antiserum (1:200)
(Agdia, Elkhart, IN) was used.
Northern analysis
Northern analyses were conducted according to [40]. For
analyses of PVX infected plants and GFP expressing transgenic plants, a radiolabeled DNA probe was prepared
using Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System
(Amersham Biosciences Corp.). Labeling was conducted
using PCR products corresponding to either the GFP or
PVX CP ORFs.

For detection of TBSV.GFP and TBSV.19K in infected plant
extracts, a DNA probe was labeled with digoxigenin
(DIG). TBSV.GFP plasmids were digested with NcoI and
SalI and a 614 nt fragment was gel eluted and labeled
using Dig High Prime kit (Roche Applied Science Inc.
Indianapolis, IN). The CSPD DIG Luminescence Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science Inc.) was used for chemiluminescence detection of DIG-labeled probes. Special
thanks to Wenping Qui at Southwest Missouri State
University for assistance with studies using TBSV to
express the SBWMV 19k.
The p26SBE-2 plasmid was obtained from Kay Scheets at
Oklahoma State University and contains the 26S ribosomal RNA gene in pBluescript. This plasmid was used to
prepare a DNA probe for membrane detection of rRNA
[45]. The p26SBE-2 plasmid was digested with BamHI and
EcoRI and a 1 kb fragment corresponding to the 26S rRNA
was recovered and labeled using the Dig High Prime DNA
labeling system (Roche Applied Science Inc.).
