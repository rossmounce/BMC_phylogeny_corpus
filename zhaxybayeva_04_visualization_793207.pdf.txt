approach to depict the phylogenetic information content
present in a multiple sequence alignment. We adapted this
approach to represent the phylogenetic information content
present in four completely sequenced genomes (for details
and methodology see [2]; for an extension that improves
taxon sampling and uses bootstrap support values see [4]).
Unfortunately, this approach is limited to the analysis of only
four genomes at a time. In many instances, it is interesting to
compare more than four genomes simultaneously (for example [5]). The number of possible tree topologies for N taxa is
(2N - 5)!/ [2N-3(N - 2)!] [6], and therefore rises dramatically
as N increases. There are 15 possible unrooted tree topologies
for five taxa, 105 for six taxa, and so on. Creating a visually
appealing graphic representation poses a difficult challenge.

Here we report a new mapping approach to visualize data
from the analyses of five genomes. The utility of this approach
is illustrated by applying it to the evolution of photosynthetic
bacteria and by dissecting the eukaryotic genome with respect
to different prokaryotic contributions. Where the majority of
the individual gene phylogenies are unresolved, a histogram

Transfer of genetic information between divergent organisms
has turned the tree of life into a net or web [1], and genomes
into mosaics. Different parts of genomes have different histories; therefore representing the history of genome evolution
as a single tree appears inconsistent with the data. Nevertheless, the assumption of a tree-like process still underlies many
approaches. Recently, we developed a tool that provides an
assessment and graphic illustration of the mosaic nature of
microbial genomes [2]. The tool is based on maximum likelihood (ML) mapping developed by Korbinian Strimmer and
Arndt von Haeseler [3]. They utilized Bayesian posterior
probabilities to assess the phylogenetic information contained in an alignment of four homologous sequences. With
four sequences there are only three possible tree topologies,
and thus the three posterior probabilities corresponding to
these three trees must sum to one. Utilizing a barycentric
coordinate system, the resulting probability vector is represented as a point in an equilateral triangle, where the distances of the point to the three sides represent the three
probabilities. Strimmer and von Haeseler applied this

Background

deposited research

The methods presented here summarize phylogenetic relationships of genomes in visually appealing
and informative figures. Dekapentagonal maps depict phylogenetic information for orthologous
genes present in five genomes, and provide a pre-screen for putatively horizontally transferred
genes. If the majority of individual gene phylogenies are unresolved, bipartition histograms provide
a means of uncovering and analyzing the plurality consensus. Analyses of genomes representing five
photosynthetic bacterial phyla and of the prokaryotic contributions to the eukaryotic cell illustrate
the utility of the methods.

giving the frequency of well-supported bipartitions provides a
useful complement to the support-value maps.

Results and discussion

Using the same dataflow as described in [2], we detect sets of
orthologous proteins for five genomes (quintets of orthologous proteins, or QuintOPs), and for each QuintOP we obtain
posterior probabilities for each of the possible 15 tree topologies. By analogy with barycentric coordinates in ML mapping,
the tree topologies are placed into vertices of a dekapentagon
(that is, a polygon with 15 vertices corresponding to the 15
possible unrooted tree topologies), and each probability vector for a dataset corresponds to the point inside the dekapentagon: the vector is defined as the gravicenter of a
dekapentagon where the posterior probabilities are considered as weights attached to the dekapentagon's vertices. If the
distribution of topologies to the corners of the polygon is
given, each probability vector unambiguously maps to a point
inside the polygon (see Figure 1). However, the position of a
probability vector crucially depends on the arrangement of
topologies at the polygon vertices. We consider an arrangement of topologies optimal, if for a genome the probability
vectors for all sets of orthologous genes map as closely to the
periphery as possible. The optimal dekapentagonal map is
only one of many possible projections of the 15-dimensional
support-value vectors to two-dimensional space. The tree
space containing all possible five taxon trees cannot be
embedded into three-dimensional space [7]. The projection
of tree space represented in the dekapentagonal maps highlights the ambiguities of phylogenetic reconstruction and
repeated patterns of inconsistency; thus the major evolutionary histories represented by different parts of the genomes
are most easily recognized.

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/3/R20

It is worth noting that while every probability vector maps to
a unique place in the optimized dekapentagonal map, the
reverse is not true. A single point inside the dekapentagonal
map corresponds to infinitely many probability vectors. For
example, a point in the center just indicates that the probabilities for topologies on opposing sites of the dekapentagon
cancel each other out, but it does not indicate the identities of
these topologies. Also, some points might be located close to
one vertex only because the probability vector equally supports the topologies located on both neighboring vertices of
the vertex. However, these points are only 'misplaced'
because of the fact that the corresponding datasets do not
strongly favor one or other topology; that is, these vectors
represent unresolved relationships.
We use a genetic algorithm to find the optimal arrangement
of the topologies at the polygon vertices. The optimality criterion is to minimize the sum of shortest distances for each
mapped probability vector to the polygon's circumference.
We found that the algorithm quickly converges towards solutions that are related to one another by rotation; that is, the
neighborhood relations between the different topologies are
the same. As our genetic optimization algorithm is a stochastic process, we measure its success on the basis of the probability of convergence. Our confidence that the algorithm did
indeed find an optimal solution rises with the probability that
on subsequent runs the algorithm can reproduce the same
solution and that other solutions found are always inferior to
the one deemed optimal. We consistently obtained a convergence rate in the range of 66% to 100%: from 50 independent
runs, 33 in one case and 50 in the other converged on the
same arrangement, while 17 arrangements in the former case
were suboptimal. This suggests that our genetic optimization
algorithm does indeed converge on the optimal arrangement.
Comparative studies have shown that bootstrap values are
more conservative measures of support than Bayesian posterior probabilities [2,4,8,9], and therefore they provide a more
realistic assessment of the support that the different topologies receive. Also, simulation studies have shown that
increase of the size of a dataset by introducing additional
homologous sequences improves the accuracy of the reconstruction [10] (see [11] and [12] for recent discussion). Therefore, in addition to plotting posterior probabilities, we also
calculated and mapped bootstrap support values for each
QuintOP from extended datasets - that is, the datasets containing additional homologous sequences (see [4] for details
on the calculation of bootstrap support values from extended
datasets).
We applied both probability mapping according to [3] and
bootstrap support-value mapping to two different genome
quintets. The first is the case of five bacterial genomes representing the five phyla that contain organisms with chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. The other is an interdomain

Analysis of five photosynthetic bacterial genomes

Contributions to a eukaryotic genome during its
evolution
Genes in eukaryotes are proposed to represent different contributions from different organisms (Figure 6). If appropriate
representatives of the bacterial and archaeal domains are
chosen, the genes that were acquired from different putative
contributors to the eukaryotic lineage can be differentiated
through different tree topologies. Here we attempt to partition a eukaryotic genome with respect to the different contributions. We selected the genome quintet containing one wellannotated eukaryote (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), two
archaea representing two archaeal kingdoms (the euryarchaeote Archaeoglobus fulgidus and the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus), and two bacteria (the alphaproteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis).

The dekapentagonal maps depicted in Figures 7 and 8
emphasize the mosaicism of the eukaryotic genome of yeast,
and delineate different contributions to the yeast genome that
have occurred over the course of evolution. The map reveals
that individual datasets support different, in some instances
conflicting, hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of
eukaryotes. While the resulting maps illustrate the mosaic
nature of the eukaryotic genome, their discriminatory power
regarding different proposed contributions is limited. For

reports

For the interdomain genome quintet (Figures 7, 8) most support-value vectors map close to four vertices: topology 11 (corresponding to the traditional ribosomal RNA tree as
described by [15]), topology 12 (supporting the eocyte hypothesis, [16]), topology 9 (predicted for the genes of mitochondrial origin) and topology 4 (eukaryotic homolog with other
bacteria). Notably, there are some datasets that support other
topologies (see Table 1): the large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthase supports topology 2, which groups a euryarchaeote within the Bacteria, and ribosomal protein S3
homologs support topology 15, which groups yeast with
Archaeoglobus. The large subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate
synthase contains an internal duplication ([17-19], and A.
Lazcano, personal communication) and its phylogeny was
described as being consistent with an interdomain horizontal
gene transfer from the bacteria to the ancestor of the euryarchaeota [20-22]. Topologies 4 and 12 might represent different prokaryotic contributions to the yeast genome, transfers
between the two prokaryotic domains, or a single bacterial
contribution to the eukaryotic cell [23,24]. In all those datasets that group the eukaryotic homolog with bacterial
sequences we were not able to detect any consistent phylogenetic signature. This finding is in agreement with the 'you are
what you eat' hypothesis [25], but it also could be due to limited phylogenetic information surviving in the individual
datasets.

reviews

For the genome quintet of photosynthetic organisms that we
initially analyzed in [5], both the posterior probability map
and the bootstrap support map show that a plurality of datasets support three tree topologies: numbers 5, 10, and 15 (see
Figures 2 and 3). The extended datasets (Figure 3) provide a
more realistic illustration of the reliability of the individual
analyses than the map based on the ML-mapping approach
(Figure 2). While the plurality consensus is still discernable in
Figure 3, many datasets do not map close to any of the vertices, suggesting that these sets of orthologous proteins cannot
discriminate between at least some of the possible phylogenies. One might be tempted to conclude that not much phylogenetic information survived and that the apparent conflicts
[5] were due to a lack of resolution only [13]. However, each
five-taxon tree has two internal branches, that is, two bipartitions that contain phylogenetic information. The smallest
quantum of phylogenetic information is the individual bipartition, not the resolved tree topology. In the five-taxon case a
bipartition can be viewed as a partially unresolved tree where
two taxa are grouped together, while the relationship among
the other three taxa remains unresolved. An analysis of the
possible bipartitions is a better way to gauge the extent of surviving phylogenetic information and the conflict between the
individual datasets than dekapentagonal maps. We summarize the support for the 10 possible bipartitions in the form of
a histogram (Figure 4). The bipartition corresponding to the
plurality consensus signal for trees 5, 10 and 15 is labeled as
bipartition A. This bipartition has plurality support. Xiong et
al. [14] reported that enzymes involved in (bacterio)chlorophyll biosynthesis are supporting the topology that in the
dekapentagonal map is labeled as topology 13. Topology 13
corresponds to two bipartitions labeled as E and G in Figure
4. In our set of 188 QuintOPs, only a few members of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway are present: bchB/chlB, bchL/
chlL and chlM. The other members of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway were not picked up because of the strict
requirements imposed on the QuintOP assembly, that is, the
requirement that the open reading frames (ORFs) that form a
QuintOP mutually pick up each other in all five genomes as
top-scoring BLAST hits. The reason that some members of
the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways are not assembled into
QuintOPs is that there are multiple paralogous genes present
in some of those genomes (especially in the Chlorobium and
Chloroflexus genomes), and these prevent proper QuintOPs
from being formed. We manually compiled the extended
datasets for bchH/chlH, bchI/chlI, bchD/chlD, bchN/chlN
genes and calculated the bootstrap support values for bipartitions A, E and G with different phylogenetic methods (Figure
5). In all cases the members of the photosynthetic pathway do
not support the plurality bipartition, but significantly support
the bipartitions reported by Xiong et al. [14]. This suggests
that the genes from the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway

orthologs common to the five genomes [5]). The dekapentagon is divided into zones of proximity to topologies: points that fall into one of the 15 zones
that correspond to the 15 tree topologies favor either that topology most or several neighboring topologies, and points that fall into the single central
zone represent unresolved relationships. The tree topology number (1 to 15) is given first, followed by the number of points per zone in parentheses.

example, the datasets that support the traditional topology
(number 11) are equally compatible with genes that were contributed to the eukaryotic cell via the chronocyte [26].
Because our approach only considers unrooted trees, the two
scenarios result in identical topologies, with only the branch
lengths differing under the two scenarios, that is, the genes
contributed by the chronocyte are expected to have the
eukaryotic genes on very long branches [27]. Another shortcoming is that the map includes only two bacterial taxa. Without inspecting the phylogenies inferred from the extended
datasets (see above) it is impossible to decide if many genes

were contributed from a single bacterium, as assumed in
hypotheses proposed in [23,24,28], or were acquired through
many independent transfers [25].

Conclusions

Dekapentagonal mapping provides a useful extension to the
earlier developed ML-, posterior probability, and bootstrap
support-values mapping for four genomes described in [2]
and [4]. For the analyses of four genomes the mapping of the
support values to the two-dimensional space is unique; for

barycentric coordinate system allows us to dissect genomes
into parts that have different evolutionary histories, and to

Assembly of extended datasets for the QuintOPs

The dekapentagon was placed into the Cartesian coordinate
system with its center coinciding with the origin of the coordinate system. Then the coordinates (xi, yi) of a vertex i are xi
= R*cos(i*360/15), yi = R*sin(i*360/15), where R is the distance from origin to the vertex (equal for all the vertices due
to the location of the origin of the coordinate system), and 1 ≤
i ≤ 15. For each pair of vertices i and j the coordinates of the
center of gravity Mij (xM, yM) are calculated according to the
law of the lever: xM = xi + (xj - xi)*pj/(pi + pj), yM = yi + (yj yi)*pj/(pi + pj), where pi and pj are the posterior probabilities
of vertices i and j. The process is repeated for all pairs of vertices, and then iteratively for all 'intermediate' centers of
gravities until only one pair of coordinates remains, which
gives the center of gravity of the dekapentagon that is equivalent to the location of probability vector. The resulting coordinates of the dekapentagon's center of gravity do not depend
on the order in which the masses are combined.

either an organism that branched off before the most recent common
ancestor of the today's archaea (as in the traditional rRNA-based tree of
life that contains a monophyletic archaeal clade [15]), or it might have
been more specifically related to the crenarchaeota (as in the eocyte
proposal [16], which results in the archaea being a paraphyletic grouping).

chloroplasts [49], which evolved from bacterial endosymbionts, and which
contributed many genes to the nuclear genome [50]. Additional
contributions were proposed to have originated from now-extinct
organisms [26,27], such as the 'chronocyte', and through many single-gene
transfers from many different sources that might have been ingested as
food by early eukaryotes [25].

from the NCBI [33]. The resulting sequences were added to
the QuintOP dataset and duplicated sequences were eliminated. The datasets were aligned with ClustalW [35], and 100
bootstrap samples were generated using the SEQBOOT program from the PHYLIP package version 3.6a2.1 [37]. The
distances were generated using TREE-PUZZLE version 5.1
[36] under the auto-detected substitution model. Neighborjoining trees were calculated from these distances using
NEIGHBOR from the PHYLIP package version 3.6a2.1 [37].
The resulting trees were parsed with respect to which of the 15
five-taxon subtrees they contain.

Figure 7
Posterior probability map of QuintOPs from an interdomain genome quintet
Posterior probability map of QuintOPs from an interdomain genome quintet. The quintet consists of genomes of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Y, red),
the alpha-proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (R, green), the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (B, green), the euryarchaeote Archaeoglobus
fulgidus (A, blue) and the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus (S, blue). There are 53 QuintOPs in this genome quintet. For notations see legend for Figure
2.

permutations [38] are counted, and the arrangements that
become equivalent by rotation of dekapentagon or flipping
the dekapentagon over are considered as the same
arrangements). The arrangement was considered optimal
when the topologies arranged at the polygon vertices in such
way that maximizes the sum of all distances of the barycentric
points from the center of the polygon. There are too many
arrangements of topologies around the dekapentagon to
search for the optimal arrangement exhaustively. Therefore,
we used a heuristic search for optimal solutions based on a
hybrid genetic algorithm [39]. Each tree topology was
assigned a numerical identifier (1 through 15), and the

arrangements of topologies around the dekapentagon's vertices were encoded as arrays of the tree topology identifiers
where each position in the array represents a position on the
polygon circumference. The genetic algorithm applies mutation and cross-over operations to each successive generation
of arrangements until the optimal solution is obtained [40].
Each generation consisted of a population of 300 individuals.
In order to preserve diversity among the individuals as much
as possible and prevent premature convergence of the algorithm the population was divided into 10 demes (subpopulations) each with 30 individuals and with controlled migration
between demes.

Sequences from the genome quintet were supplemented with
homologous sequences from other photosynthetic bacteria to
improve taxon sampling, aligned with ClustalW [35], and
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed. For distance and parsimony analyses, 100 bootstrap samples were generated with

We hybridized the genetic algorithm by equipping the algorithm with a local search heuristic in addition to the global
search strategy based on the genetic operators to explore
better the space of possible arrangements. A manuscript
reporting details on the algorithm for finding the optimal
arrangements is in preparation (L.H., O.Z. and J.P.G., unpublished work). The program calculating the optimal arrangement of topologies is available on request.
