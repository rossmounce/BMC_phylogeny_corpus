Abstract
Background: Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are crucial in the regulation of gene
transcription. Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray
hybridization (ChIP-chip array) has been used to identify potential regulatory sequences, but the
procedure can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci within 1–2 kb resolution. To
find out the exact binding motifs, it is necessary to build a computational method to examine the
ChIP-chip array binding sequences and search for possible motifs representing the transcription
factor binding sites.
Results: We developed a program to find out accurate motif sites from a set of unaligned DNA
sequences in the yeast genome. Compared with MDscan, the prediction results suggest that,
overall, our algorithm outperforms MDscan since the predicted motifs are more consistent with
previously known specificities reported in the literature and have better prediction ranks. Our
program also outperforms the constraint-less Cosmo program, especially in the elimination of false
positives.
Conclusion: In this study, an improved sampling algorithm is proposed to incorporate the
binomial probability model to build significant initial candidate motif sets. By investigating the
statistical dependence between base positions in TFBSs, the method of dependency graphs and
their expanded Bayesian networks is combined. The results show that our program satisfactorily
extract transcription factor binding sites from unaligned gene sequences.

Background
Understanding transcription is central to understanding
genetic regulatory mechanisms. The transcription of a
gene is generally dependent on the presence of specific
signals located at upstream regions of the core-promoter.

These specific signals derive from their use as binding sites
by transcription factors (TFs), and are therefore termed
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip array) has been used to

identify potential regulatory sequences, but the procedure
can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci
within 1–2 kilobases resolution [1]. To find out the exact
binding motifs, it is necessary to build a computational
method to examine the ChIP-chip array binding
sequences and search for possible motifs representing the
TFBSs (motif discovery).
There are many computational TFBS motif finding tools
available [2-4]. The traditional approach for finding TFBSs
is to collect and align a set of promoter sequences of coregulated genes from either the literature or systematic
experiments. Numerous computational tools, such as
CONSENSUS [5], EM [6], MEME [7] and the Gibbs sampler [8], have utilized the approach to identify short DNA
sequence motifs which are statistically over-represented in
the promoter sequences.
Other than the alignment-based motif finding algorithms
in above, many approaches have tried to extend to the use
of evolutionary conservation information such as phylogenetic footprinting or the detection of combinations of
binding sites (termed as cis-regulatory modules; CRMs)
[2,3]. Phylogenetic footprinting methods [9-11] is an
approach that seeks to identify conserved regulatory elements by comparing genomic sequences between related
species. However, due to the statistical nature of the
approach, e.g., a small amount of closely related species,
not all transcription binding sites can be found by using
phylogenetic footprinting. Hence, some algorithms have
emerged to combine the alignment-based motif prediction with phylogenetic footprinting such as PhyloGibbs
[12] and MY sampler [13]. On the other hand, by the
detection of CRMs due to the cooperative interactions
between TFs, algorithms like those in [14-16] can produce
predictions of substantially better specificity than those of
isolated sites.
Recently, more effective motif finders, e.g., MDscan [1],
ANN-Spec [17], DMOTIFS [18], DME [19] and Cosmo
[20], have taken the advantage of a background set, serving as a negative control. The goal of these discriminant
motif finders is to search only for motifs that are most discriminating, that is, only those enriched in the foreground
set relative to the background set [2]. Although these
motif finders have improved the performance of TFBS prediction, it is still a trouble to have a satisfactory solution.
How to find out accurate binding motifs may require
much attention in the computational biology community. In this study, an improved sampling algorithm is
proposed to incorporate the binomial probability model
to build significant initial motif sets. By investigating the
statistical dependence between base positions in TFBSs, it
appears feasible to use statistical models to formulate the
structural dependence of a motif in the identification of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S7

TFBSs. In light of this observation, the method of dependency graphs and their expanded Bayesian networks [21] is
combined and prediction results show that our algorithm
is able to find out motifs more consistent with previously
known evidence.

Methods
Let TF be one of the transcription factors to be investigated. The binding dataset of the transcription factor TF,
denoted as BTF, consists of the sequences with low binding
p-value (< 0.001) to the TF in the ChIP-chip array data
[22]. A sliding window of size w is used to extract segments of length w when sliding through each of the
sequences in BTF.
Let STF be the collection of all extracted segments from BTF,
M the number of sequences in the binding dataset BTF, Li
the length of the ith sequence in the binding dataset BTF,
and TTF the total number of segments in STF. Then
M

TTF =

∑ (L − w + 1).
i

i =1

To discover the binding motifs of the transcription factor
TF, a number of initial candidate motif sets for TF is subsequently built from the collection STF of extracted segments. Note that the contents of segments, called patterns,
in STF may not be distinct.
Most of early motif finding algorithms, such as Gibbs
sampler [8] and MEME [23], have a weakness, where initial candidate motif sets are built by randomly extracting
segments from sequences in the binding dataset BTF (i.e.
randomly selecting segments from the set STF). To
improve the deficiency, the binomial probability distribution model is firstly utilized in the establishment of a
number of initial candidate motif sets in our algorithm.
Then in the process of iterative sampling in our algorithm
to expand and/or trim each of the initial candidate motif
sets, the method of dependency graphs and their
expanded Bayesian networks [21] is used to develop a statistical model for the background motif set identified as
the union S = ∪TFSTF of segments extracted from all transcription factor binding datasets.
The basic procedure to find the binding motifs of the transcription factor TF is as follows:
1. Build N initial candidate motif sets.
(a) Take N distinct patterns from the set STF with the most
highest significance scores as the candidates by the binomial distribution model (see the Binomial probability
distribution model subsection).

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 12):S7

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S7

(b) Then for each of the significant binding site candidates for the transcription factor , in view of evolution,
collect all segments in
whose patterns have no more
than d Hamming distance matching to the candidate pattern to form an initial candidate motif set.
At this stage, N initial candidate motif sets for the transcription factor TF are built.
2. Iteratively sample through the binding dateset BTF to
expand and/or trim each of the N initial candidate motif
sets so that their approximate maximum a posteriori
(AMAP) scores [1,24] can keep increasing until the N candidate motif sets are invariant in K consecutive iterations
(see the Iterative sampling subsection).
(a) In the calculation of AMAP scores in this stage, the
background model for the background motif set S = ∪TFSTF is established under the method of dependency graphs
and their expanded Bayesian networks (see the Method of
dependency graphs and their expanded Bayesian networks subsection).
3. Refine each of the N candidate motif sets by re-examining all the segments already included in the motif set. A
segment is removed from the motif set if doing so
increases the AMAP score.
A simple flowchart for our algorithm is shown in Figure 1.
The following subsections will expatiate on each stage of
our algorithm. As an illustration of the dynamics of the
PWM and the rank of different candidate motif sets at different stages of our algorithm, a summary of the prediction process for the motif of the transcription factor CBF1
is given in Figure 2.
Initial motif sets building
Our method begins by enumerating those patterns in STF
that appear most often in the binding dataset BTF than in
others. What we want to do first is to calculate the appearance probability of a pattern in STF, which is the probability that the pattern appears no less than n times in the
binding dataset BTF. If a pattern b appears more often than
other patterns in STF and its occurrence probability in a
generic intergenic region is comparatively low, the calculated significance score of b would be relatively high. We
will take patterns with the most highest significance scores
as the candidates to build a number of initial candidate
motif sets.
Binomial probability distribution model
The probability to observe exactly j occurrences of pattern
b in the collection STF of segments extracted from the binding dataset BTF is estimated by the binomial distribution

where occ(b) is the occurrence times of pattern b in STF and

We define the significance score sigTF (b) of a pattern b to
TF as
sigTF (b) = -log10(PTF (occ(b) ≥ n)).
The less probable pattern b in S appears more than n times
in STF, the more probable will it be a binding site candidate for the transcription factor TF. We will take N distinct
patterns with the most highest significance scores as the
candidates.

For each of the N significant binding site candidates for
the transcription factor TF, in view of evolution, collect all
segments in STF whose patterns have no more than d Hamming distance matching to the candidate pattern to form
an initial candidate motif set. Thus N initial candidate
motif sets for the transcription factor TF are built at the
end of this stage. As an example, the PWM and the rank of
five initial candidate motif sets for the motif prediction of
the transcription factor CBF1 are shown in Figure 2.
Iterative sampling
In this stage, a sampling method is used to expand and/or
trim each of the N initial candidate motif sets M1, M2,..,
MN. For our purpose, a false motif set MN+1 is created by
randomly selecting e0 (e0 is equal to the maximum size of
the N initial candidate motif sets) segments from the collection STF such that Mi ∩ MN+1 = ∅, for all i = 1, 2,..., N.
In addition, let the collection S = ∪TFSTF of segments
extracted from all transcription factor binding datasets
represent the intergenic background and here be denoted
as MBG.

Sampling strategy
In each iteration, there are two steps for the sampler, the
S-step and the M-step.

In the S-step, the sampler samples a site by randomly
selecting a sequence from BTF and then randomly picking
up a site in the selected sequence to extract a segment ms
of length w. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N, if the sampled segment ms
appears in Mi, segment ms will be removed from Mi if the

In the M-step, the sampler has to decide whether the
newly sampled segment ms should be appended into the
candidate motif set Mi or not. The AMAP measure again
will be used to evaluate our decision. The sampled segment ms is appended into the candidate motif set Mi if and
only if the score amap Mi of the motif model Mi is
increased once the sampled segment ms is appended to Mi.
Note that the PSSM of the motif model Mi should be
retrained after the sampled segment bs is appended to Mi.
Now the M-step is done and the current iteration stops

increases after its removal; otherwise, segment ms will be

keep increasing. The N candidate motif sets will tend to be
invariant after a (larger) number of iterations. The stopping criterion of the sampling process is that all the N candidate motif sets are invariant in K consecutive iterations.
The parameter K is usually set to be 1% of the size of STF.

Which one of the N + 1 motif sets would be the best motif
set for the sampled segment ms will depend on the

Alternative sampling strategy
There is an alternative sampling strategy as follows.

In the S-step, the new sampler also randomly samples a
site from a sequence in BTF to extract a segment msof
length w. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N, if the pattern of the sampled segment ms appears in Mi, all the segments in Mi whose pat-

dependency between two positions is based on a χ2-test
from known sample data. An edge is established between
two nodes (a node represents a base position) in the
graph if the two corresponding base positions of the motif
or region are dependent. After all dependent edges have
being established completely, a dependency graph for the
motif or region is constructed. An example of a dependency graph with 7 nodes is shown in Figure 3.

tern is the same as that of ms will be removed if the AMAP
score amap Mi of the motif set Mi increases after their
removal. Otherwise, these segments will be kept in Mi.
Also in the S-step, if app MN +1 is the highest among all

app Mi , 1 ≤ i ≤ N + 1, then all segments in the set STF having
the same pattern as that of the sampled segment ms will be
appended into the false motif set MN+1 unless these segments are already there and the current iteration stops
here. If app Mi is the highest for some i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the sampled segment ms will be further checked in the M-step to
see if we really want to append those segments in the set
STF having the same pattern as that of the sampled segment ms into Mi unless we have already processed those
segments for Mi at the beginning of this S-step as in above
and the current iteration stops here.

As reported in [21], although the dependency graph can
fully capture the intrinsic interdependency between base
positions in a motif or region, it is difficult, if not impossible, to perform statistical inference based on the
dependency graph. To resolve the dilemma, the dependency graph is expanded to form a Bayesian network
(which is a directed acyclic graph that facilitates statistical
reasoning) by allowing a base position in the dependency
graph to appear more than once in the Bayesian network
as nominally distinct nodes. Figure 4 shows an example of
an expanded Bayesian network of the dependency graph
in Figure 3. For the detailed procedure of constructing an
expanded Bayesian network (EBN) from a dependency
graph, please see [21]. In this paper, we use EBNs to
model the background motif set MBG.
Continued with the same example of the motif prediction
of the transcription factor CBF1, the PWM and the rank of
the five candidate motif sets at the end of the iterative
sampling stage are also shown in Figure 2, together with
the final results at the end of the refinement stage.

In the M-step, all the segments in the set STF having the
same pattern as that of the sampled segment ms are
decided to append to the candidate motif set Mi if and
only if the AMAP score amap Mi of Mi increases after these

Method of dependency graphs and their expanded Bayesian
networks
Considering the binding mechanism of transcription factors to specific DNA sites (motifs), there must be distinctive features for the specific motif regions from other
intergenic regions which represent the background DNA
sequence. Hence, it is conceivable that we can use a statistical model to capture the feature of a specific DAN site
(motif) or a generic DNA intergenic region (background).
Since the size of a candidate motif set Mi is often small, a
PSSM model is commonly used for Mi instead of any other
more sophisticated statistical model. However, the size of
the background motif set MBG is usually large enough to
be equipped with a more sophisticated one.

As reported in [21], a dependency graph model is used to
fully capture the intrinsic interdependency between base
positions in a motif or region. The establishment of

motor sequences from the cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIp-chip array) of yeast genome [22]. Each of the
binding sequences may contain some unknown motifs
that are implanted at unknown positions. These data represent the binding affinity of a target transcription factor
to the promoter region of a gene in vivo. The experiment
protocol assigns a binding p-value to each binding promoter sequence of the corresponding transcription factor.
A sequence with binding p-value less than 0.001 is considered to be bound by the corresponding transcription factor. The threshold of 0.001 is set up to reduce the false
positive identification in yeast genome-wide screening.
We collected the ChIp-chip array sequence data from the
"Motif discovery results – Discovered motifs, version 24"
at [26]. For a transcription factor TF to be investigated, we
collected all sequences with binding p-value less than the
threshold 0.001 to TF into the binding dataset BTF. There
are 65 binding datasets BTF being able to be collected from
Harbison's website.
Accuracy measurement and comparison
To evaluate the performance of our program, we collected
known specificities from many famous websites, such as
YPD, SCPD, Transfac and from the literature with experimental evidence [27] to compare with the discovered specificities predicted by our program.

Among the 65 binding datasets BTF collected from Harbison's website, we chose 36 transcription factor binding
datasets which have known specificities with experimental evidence to evaluate the performance of our program.
The results of our program for the 36 transcription factor
binding datasets are listed in Figure 5. It is deserved to be
mentioned that the specificity reported for transcription
factor PHO2 in Harbrison et al's website is "GTGCGsyGCG", while the predicted result of our program is
"ATTATC". In this case, the newly found motif by our program is more consistent with the results reported by Barbaric et al [28] that PHO2 binds to an AT-rich region than
the specificity reported in Harbrison et al's website.
In this study, we compared our program with two online
programs, MDscan [29] and Cosmo [30]. MDscan is a
famous program that can be used to examine the ChIParray selected sequences and search for DNA sequence
motifs representing the protein-DNA interaction sites. It
takes the advantage of combining two widely adopted
motif search strategies, word enumeration and positionspecific weight matrix updating, and incorporates the
ChIP enrichment information to accelerate the search and
enhance its success rate. The comparison of MDscan with
our program is shown in Table 1. Also reported in Table 1
is the performance of our algorithm when the the PSSM
model [8] instead of the EBN model [21] is used to model
the background motif set MBG in the calculation of the
AMAP scores of the N candidate motif sets and the
appendant scores of the N + 1 motif sets. In Table 1, for
each transcription factor, the number in each 'Rank' column indicates the rank of the predicted motif which is
most consistent with the known evidence from the top ten
predicted candidate motifs.
As shown in Table 1, our approach with EBN background
model outperforms the other two methods. Our approach
with EBN background model gives 30 out of the 36 most
predicted motifs for the corresponding 36 transcription
factors with the 1st rank, while MDscan and our approach
with PSSM background model give only 20 out of 36 and
15 out of 36 most predicted motifs with the 1st rank,
respectively. Moreover, MDscan fails in discovering a
motif for three transcription factor binding datasets, while
our approach in this study is still able to predict a motif
consistent with the known evidence.
Cosmo (constrained search for motifs) is a general purpose algorithm for conserved motif detection that allows
the search to be supervised by specifying a set of constraints that the PWM of the unknown motif must satisfy.
Such constraints may be formulated derived from prior
biological knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor, such as the length of the motif intervals.

multinomial mixture model used in MEME, it employs
the likelihood principle instead of the E-value criterion in
MEME. In addition, three model types (OOPS, ZOOPS, or
TCM) can data-adaptively be selected in Cosmo to achieve
better performance. Since there is no prior knowledge
used in our program, we compared it to the constraint-less
version of the Cosmo program. On the other hand, since
the Cosmo program reports only one motif PWM for a
dataset, instead of a list of ranked candidate motif PWMs
as in MDscan, we adopted only the rank 1 results of our
program in this comparison. To evaluate the performance
of both programs, we used the statistics proposed by
Tompa et al. [4]. For a (computational) tool at the site
level, the performance statistics on a dataset are defined as
follows:

Sensitivity : Sn = TP /(TP + FN )
Positive predictive value : PPV = TP /(TP + FP )
Average site performance : ASP = (Sn + PPV ) / 2
c
where TP is the number of known sites overlapped by predicted sites, FN is the number of known sites not overlapped by predicted sites, and FP is the number of
predicted sites not overlapped by known sites. To summarize the performance of a given tool over a collection 
of datasets, we compute the "combined" statistics as
though C were one large dataset by adding TP, FP and FN
respectively over the datasets in  . Then the combined
statistics of our program are Sn = 0.6698, PPV = 0.8206,
and ASP = 0.7452, while those of Cosmo are Sn = 0.6573,
PPV = 0.5134 and ASP = 0.5854. For the detailed Cosmo
prediction results and the comparison of the two programs, please see Figure S1 (see Additional file 1). The
comparison shows that our program can offer better performance than Cosmo, especially in the elimination of
false positives.
The parameters used in our program include the sliding
window size w used to extract segments from binding
datasets BTF to form STF, the Hamming distance d used to
collect segments from STF to establish initial candidate
motif sets, the number of most dependent edges used to
form a dependency graph for the background motif
model and the number of parents used in the construction of an expanded Bayesian network from the dependency graph [21]. The parameters used in our program to
give the best predicted motifs for each of the 36 transcription factors are listed in Table S1 (see Additional file 2).
Comparing the performance of the two sampling strategies discussed in the Method section, as shown in Figure
S2 (see Additional file 3), we found that the alternative
sampler is faster and has almost identical best predicted
motifs with those by the primary sampler, except that
transcription factors GCN4, HAP4 and PHO4 have the
best predicted motifs one nucleotide position shift from
those by the primary sampler. In addition, the alternative
sampler is slightly better than the primary sampler in the
sense that the best predicted motif for the transcription
factor DIG1 promotes its rank from the 2nd place by the
primary sampler to the 1st place by the alternative sampler.

Conclusion
In this study, we employed the binomial probability
model to establish a number of initial candidate motif
sets, and used the method of dependence graphs and their
expanded Bayesian networks to model the background
motif set as a control to predict TFBSs (motifs) from a set

of unaligned DNA sequences. The prediction results suggest that, overall, our algorithm outperforms MDscan
since the predicted motifs are more consistent with previously known specificities reported in the literature and
have better prediction ranks. And when compared with
the constraint-less Cosmo program, our algorithm has a
slightly higher combined sensitivity Sn, a much higher
positive predictive value PPV and a higher average site performance ASP. However, the performance of our algorithm is not much better if the length of possible binding
sites are too long (more than 12 bps). Further research is
needed to discover long motifs.

Science Council, Taiwan, under Contracts NSC 93-3112-B-007-004 and
NSC95-3114-P-002-005-Y.

Furthermore, variable spacing within binding sites is legitimate for some transcription factors while this study
focuses on ungapped motif discovery. Programs such as
BIPAD [31] and spaced dyad [32] have investigated into
such a bipartitie sequence element discovery problem.
Therefore another direction for our future research is to
investigate into gapped motifs.
