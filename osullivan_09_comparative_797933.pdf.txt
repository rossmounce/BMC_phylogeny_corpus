Abstract
Background: The recently sequenced genome of Lactobacillus helveticus DPC4571 [1] revealed a
dairy organism with significant homology (75% of genes are homologous) to a probiotic bacteria
Lb. acidophilus NCFM [2]. This led us to hypothesise that a group of genes could be determined
which could define an organism's niche.
Results: Taking 11 fully sequenced lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as our target, (3 dairy LAB, 5 gut LAB
and 3 multi-niche LAB), we demonstrated that the presence or absence of certain genes involved
in sugar metabolism, the proteolytic system, and restriction modification enzymes were pivotal in
suggesting the niche of a strain. We identified 9 niche specific genes, of which 6 are dairy specific
and 3 are gut specific. The dairy specific genes identified in Lactobacillus helveticus DPC4571 were
lhv_1161 and lhv_1171, encoding components of the proteolytic system, lhv_1031 lhv_1152,
lhv_1978 and lhv_0028 encoding restriction endonuclease genes, while bile salt hydrolase genes
lba_0892 and lba_1078, and the sugar metabolism gene lba_1689 from Lb. acidophilus NCFM were
identified as gut specific genes.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis revealed that if an organism had homologs to the dairy specific
geneset, it probably came from a dairy environment, whilst if it had homologs to gut specific genes,
it was highly likely to be of intestinal origin.
We propose that this "barcode" of 9 genes will be a useful initial guide to researchers in the LAB
field to indicate an organism's ability to occupy a specific niche.

Background
The LAB represents a group of organisms that are functionally related by their general ability to produce lactic
acid during homo- or hetro-fermentative metabolism.

They are predominantly Gram-positive, non-sporulating
facultative anaerobic bacteria and have been isolated from
sources as diverse as plants, animals and humans (for
recent reviews on LAB see [3-7]). LAB can be sub-classified

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:50

into 7 phylogenetic clades:Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Streptococcus, Leuconostoc and Oenococcus [8]. They represent the single most exploited group
of bacteria in the food industry, playing crucial roles in the
fermentation of dairy products, meat and vegetables, as
well as in the production of wine, coffee, cocoa and sourdough. This is reflected in the fact that to date (July 2008),
65 LAB genomes are either completely sequenced or in
progress (source http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Some
LAB, such as Lb. rhamnosus ATCC 53013 and Lb. acidophilus NCFM have been shown to be probiotic, which is
defined by the World Health Organisation as: 'Live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host'. [9] LAB are also a reservoir
for antimicrobial peptides, such as bacteriocins. There are
numerous examples of bacteriocin producing LAB -one of
the most recent being Lb. salivarius UCC118, which was
shown to be effective in reducing L. monocytogenes infections in mice [10]. However, members of the LAB can also
be important pathogens, e.g. several Streptococcus and
Enterococcus species. Such species are commonly found in
the human and animal GI tract and can occasionally cause
disease. Diseases caused by colonisation of pathogenic
LAB include urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial
endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis.
Members of the LAB group have close phylogenetic relationships largely due to their sharing relatively small, ATrich genomes (~2.4 Mb) and common metabolic pathways [8]. Despite their phylogenetic closeness, the LAB
occupy a diverse set of ecological niches including fermenting plants, milk, wine, sour-dough, the human and
animal GI tract and the oral cavities of vertebrates. Such
niche diversity among closely-related species suggests
considerable genetic adaptation during their evolution.
The recently sequenced dairy culture Lb. helveticus
DPC4571 [1], has 98.4% 16s ribosomal RNA identity to
the gut organism Lb. acidophilus NCFM [2]. This gave us a
unique opportunity to investigate two very similar organisms occupying extremely different niches and led us to
investigate if we could define a specific gene set which is
associated with niche adaptation in LAB. Phylogenetically, both Lb. helveticus and Lb. acidophilus branch
together with other gut bacteria. In recent years, numerous
comparative studies of LAB [11-16] have made apparent
that comparative genomics analysis will quickly reveal
both the conserved and unique components of LAB that
occupy different environmental niches. Knowledge of key
gene sets that could promote a gut or dairy lifestyle could
be very useful in guiding strain selection for multiple
roles, either as probiotic or bioprocessing/fermentation
cultures.
Our objective in this study was to take the differences in
the phylogenetically related species; Lb. helveticus and Lb.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/50

acidophilus and investigate if we could define a niche specific gene-set, or a "barcode", which would help inform
on the origin of particular strains of LAB.

Results and discussion
Although Lb. helveticus DPC4571 and Lb. acidophilus
NCFM share remarkable genomic homology (16S rRNA
sequence shares 98.4% identity) and conserved gene synteny, they occupy distinctly different niches (Lb. helveticus
DPC4571 is a dairy organism while Lb. acidophilus NCFM
is a gut organism). Analysis of the completed genome
sequences revealed that 75% of predicted DPC4571 ORFs
have orthologues in the Lb. acidophilus NCFM genome
(orthology being defined as BLASTP E value < 10-20). We
confirmed the positioning of Lb. helveticus DPC4571 by
constructing a phylogenetic tree with concatenated alignments of 47 ribosomal proteins (Fig. 1), an approach
shown to improve the resolution and robustness of phylogenetic analyses [17].
Focusing on the differences between the two genomes,
DPC4571 has 123 (non-IS element) genes which are not
found in NCFM while the NCFM strain has 503 genes not
found in DPC4571. This gave us a starting point of 626
potential niche-specific genes, with the "DPC4571 only"
genes being potential dairy-specific genes and the "NCFM
only" genes being potential gut-specific genes. Of the 503
"NCFM only" genes, analysis of sequence data identified

a number of IS element-associated gene losses from Lb.
helveticus DPC4571, including ten interrupted genes and
predicted deletions at 31 separate loci. These deletions
were located in a number of genes whose loss would be
expected to affect functionality in either a dairy and a nondairy environment [1]. Interestingly, many of the genetic
complement that distinguishes DPC4571 from NCFM
appeared to be dairy- or gut-specific from a functional perspective. Survival and colonisation of the human gut
relies on the presence of certain genes [18], such as those
involved in (complex) sugar metabolism, and bile salt
hydrolysis [4,18,19]. On the other hand, in order to survive in a dairy environment organisms appear to conserve
specific genes involved in fatty acid degradation and proteolysis [3,4].
To this end, we investigated whether any of the candidate
genes, 123 DPC4571 "dairy" genes or the 503 NCFM
"gut" genes, could be used to identify a micro-organisms
niche. An unbiased homology search with each of the candidate genes was executed against our initial selection of
11 genomes (table 1). These 11 genomes were selected on
the basis that they were phylogenetically related to Lb. helveticus DPC4571 and Lb. acidophilus NCFM, they were
fully sequenced genomes and they were isolated from
either a dairy or gut environment or were capable of surviving in both. A gene was deemed a gut identifier gene if
it has a homologue present in the 4 gut genomes and
absent from the 3 dairy genomes. Conversely, a gene was
deemed a dairy identifier if it had a homologue in the 3
dairy organisms but absent from the gut organisms. Criteria for homologue detection were a threshold of 1e-10 and
greater than 30% identity. Therefore, an organism could
potentially survive a dairy environment if it contains dairy
genes and an organism could potentially survive the gut if
it contains gut genes. Based on these criteria, we identified
9 genes (table 2) that appear to be niche-specific. Simultaneously to this unbiased homology search we identified
phenotypic groups of what we deemed to be desirable
niche characteristics, namely genes involved in fatty acid
metabolism, proteolysis and restriction modification systems, for the dairy environment [3,4] and for the gut envi-

ronment genes involved in sugar metabolism, cell- wall
and mucus binding and sugar metabolism [4,18,19].
Using literature searches and analysis using the ERGO
database we identified the genes involved in these groupings and a blast search was performed with all genes
within the groups against the same 11 genome group
using the same selection criteria. Interestingly the unbiased and biased methods of identifying the barcode
yielded the same 9-gene set. Furthermore, those organisms which can survive in multiple niches, namely Lb.
sakei subsp.sakei 23 K Lb. brevis ATCC367 and Lb.
plantarum WCFS1 contained both dairy-specific and gutspecific genes. Multi-niche organisms will contain some
genes from both the dairy and gut gene-set. To validate
these niche-specific genes, we performed a broader BLAST
search on a non-redundant database, containing all genes
submitted to the NCBI database, from both fully and partially sequenced genomes, to ensure that the genes did not
occur in any other dairy or gut organisms outside our
selection. As with the unbiased and biased tests criteria for
homologue detection were a threshold of 1e-10 and greater
than 30% identity. Particularly, the niche-specific genes
could be categorised into four general functional classes
i.e. sugar metabolism, the proteolytic system, restriction
modification systems and bile salt hydrolysis. A detailed
description of the LAB barcode genes will now be discussed.
Sugar Metabolism
Maltose-6-phosphate glycosidase (lba_1689 in Lb. acidophilus NCFM) is found solely in gut organisms and is
absent even in multi-niche organism. Further analysis of
this gene by BLAST comparison to all of the LAB genomes
sequenced indicated that similar proteins are only present
in Lb. acidophilus, Lb. johnsonii, Lb. casei, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus suis. The three lactobacilli
listed are classified as commensal gut strains, while the
enterococci and S. suis are also considered commensal gut
bacteria, associated more with humans and animals than
with the dairy environment. Maltose uptake and metabolism in LAB can occur by 4 different mechanisms, as discussed by Le Breton et al. 2005 [20]. In two of these,

Maltose-6-phosphate glucosidase (lba_1689)

maltose is taken into the cytoplasm by a permease; it is
not phosphorylated and therefore, maltose-6-phosphate
glycosidase is not required. In the other systems
described, a phosphotransferase (PTS) is used to transport
maltose and therefore, there is no necessity to assimilate
the resulting maltose-6-phosphate. Metabolism of maltose-6-phosphate either occurs by a maltose-6-phosphate
phosphorylase, converting maltose to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate, or a maltose-6-phosphate glycosidase, converting maltose to glucose and
glucose-6-phosphate. It is the latter mechanism that
appears to be present in the 'gut' strains.
An analysis of 40 strains of LAB demonstrated that 32 of
the strains could metabolise maltose and of these, 20 used
a permease to transport maltose into the cell followed by
conversion to glucose and β-glucose-1-phosphate by maltose phosphorylase [21]. The PTS/maltose-6-phosphate
glycosidase pathway is therefore less common than the
alternative mechanisms. Maltose is one of the least abundant disaccharides in the environment. It is present in germinating grain due to the action of amylases on starch
and also presumably in other locations where starch
breakdown products are present, such as in the gut. There
is a possible bioenergetic advantage to cells with a PTS system; if phosphorylation is coupled to transport, it saves
the energy required to phosphorylate within the cytoplasm, an important attribute if maltose were a significant
energy source. It is notable that the PTS/glycosidase systems seem to be present in gut/commensal bacteria and
others such as Clostridium difficile that can colonise the
gut. Therefore, it would appear that adaptation to the
intestinal niche seems to be associated with the presence
of substantially higher numbers of genes encoding glycosidase enzymes, particularly those involved in the
hydrolysis of disaccharides and oligosaccharides of plant
origin. Genes for the metabolism of sugars other than lactose are almost entirely absent from the more nutritionally fastidious dairy strains.
Another interesting observation was that the degree of
similarity between the genes/protein sequences from Lb.
helveticus DPC4571 and Lb. acidophilus NCFM was generally much higher than between Lb. acidophilus NCFM and

any of the other strains. While Lb. acidophilus NCFM and
the other gut and multi-environment strains had very similar complements of glycosidase genes, the sequence similarity was much lower (with the exception of a few Lb.
johnsonii genes) than between the NCFM/DPC4571
sequences, even though there were substantial differences
in glycosidase gene content between Lb. acidophilus NCFM
and Lb. helveticus DPC4571. The loss of a significant
number of glycosidase genes together with the high
degree of similarity between the remaining genes suggests
that Lb. helveticus DPC4571 has undergone a relatively
recent loss of sugar metabolism capacity relative to its
divergence from Lb. acidophilus NCFM.
Of the sugar metabolism genes analysed, only one
(lba_1689) can be used in our barcode as a gut organism
indicator.
Bile Salt Hydrolases
Intestinal bacteria can experience a wide number of
stresses in the intestinal tract including those caused by
low pH and presence of bile. In this respect, bile salt tolerance is thought to be an important aspect of survival for
bacteria which inhabit the intestinal tract. Most intestinal
isolates of lactobacilli and some lactobacilli involved in
food fermentations exhibit bile salt hydrolase activity
[22,23]. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of conjugated bile acids, which enter the small bowel in bile and
are important for the emulsification, digestion and
absorption of dietary lipids present in the proximal small
bowel [24]. It has been suggested that deconjugation of
bile acids is a detoxification method and protects the cells
from conjugated bile. Conversely, negative effects of bile
salt hydrolase activity have also been reported including
cases of contaminated small bowel syndrome, impaired
lipid absorption, gallstone formation, and increased risk
of colon cancer [25].

In Lactobacillus-free mice, bile salt hydrolase activity was
reduced by 87%, revealing that lactobacilli are the main
contributors to bile salt hydrolysis [23]. The presence of
bile salts is an inherent stress associated with the gut environment and loss of bile salt hydrolase (bsh) genes is
likely to result from adaptation to non-gut environments

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:50

where bile salts are absent [26]. While it is indeed possible
for Lb. johnsonii to persist in the mouse gut with all three
of its bsh genes inactivated [27], the loss of a single physiological function does not necessarily mean that an
organism changes its niche suitability. We would contend
that while bile salt hydrolase genes are not essential for
gut persistence the likelihood is that their presence
increases the fitness of strains that possess them to exist in
the gut environment and that it is extremely likely that gut
strains will contain functional bsh genes. Accordingly, it
would be expected that the bsh genes would only be
present in the gut and multi-niche bacteria [28]. There are
two bsh genes in Lb. acidophilus NCFM bshA (lba_0892)
and bshB (lba_1078) [14], both of which were only found
in the other gut associated organisms. More notably, on
closer inspection we discovered that a bsh gene is present
in Lb. helveticus DPC4571 but it has a frame-shift mutated
which renders it non-functional. This suggests a common
ancestry between Lb. acidophilus and Lb. helveticus and a
recent loss of function in Lb. helveticus. Upon performing
a wider BLAST search, it was discovered that both the bshA
and bshB genes only occurred in organisms capable of gut
survival, including E. faecium, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Ruminococcus obeumand and Bifidobacterium bifidum, thus making the genes Lb. acidophilus
NCFM bshA (lba_8920) and bshB (lba_1078) ideal candidates for our barcode to identify gut organisms.
The Proteolytic System
The proteolytic system of lactobacilli and other LAB,
organisms which are fastidious in their amino acid
requirements, is of importance from a dairy perspective in
that it allows survival in milk and other dairy environments where the natural free amino acid concentrations
are very low [29]. The combined action of proteinases and
peptidases generates essential amino acids and small peptides during growth in the dairy environment. The system
is also of major industrial importance due to its contribution to the development of the organoleptic properties of
fermented milk products[30]. In cheese manufacturing,
cell envelope proteinases (CEPs) play a pivotal role in the
production of flavour compounds. Characterised peptidases such as PepN, PepX, PePO2 and PEPO3 are
involved in the breakdown of hydrophobic peptides
which could otherwise lead to bitterness in cheese. Combining LAB with different peptidase activity has been
shown to reduce such bitterness [31]L. lactis and Lb. helveticus peptidases have also been shown to accelerate the
ripening process [32,33].

It has been previously reported that there are differences
in the proteolytic system of LAB that occupy different
environmental niches [12]. Dairy strains such as Lb. helveticus CP70, Lb. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris
FT4 have been shown to harbor proteolytic enzymes
which release bioactive peptides from milk [34]. This is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/50

not fully reflected in our results as we found only two Lb.
helveticus DPC4571 genes, lhv_1161 and lhv_1171, that
were unique to dairy and multi-niche organisms, both of
which are carboxypeptidases from the M20/M25/M40
metallopeptidase family. The role of metallopeptidases in
LAB is not fully understood but they could play different
roles at the physiological and technological level. These
proteins could be involved in bacterial growth by supplying amino acids; for example, PepS has been shown to
release phenylalanine and arginine, which are known to
stimulate the growth of S. thermophilus CNRZ302 in milk.
Metallopeptidases may also participate in the development of flavour in food products, either directly, by
hydrolysing bitter peptides which are generally rich in
hydrophobic amino acids and therefore good substrates
for its action, or indirectly through the liberation of aromatic amino acids which are precursors of aroma compounds identified in cheese [35]. A broader BLAST search
for validation revealed that lhv_1161 and lhv_1171 had
homologues in Listeria, Staphylococcus and Bacillus species,
all of which are known colonisers of dairy environments,
making lhv_1161 and lhv_1171 ideal dairy LAB identifiers.
Restriction/Modification Systems
Restriction/modification (R/M) enzymes digest foreign
DNA which has entered the cytoplasm while the host
DNA remains undigested. R/M enzymes can be sub-classified into 3 groups; Type I, Type II and Type III. Type I
enzymes consist of three subunits, which are responsible
for modification (M), restriction (R), and specificity (S)
and have been designated Hsd standing for host specificity determinant. Three type I R/M enzymes from Lb. helveticus DPC4571 are dairy organism-specific; hsdR
(lhv_1031), hsdS1 (lhv_1152) and hsdR (lhv_1978).
Also, there is one dairy specific type III R/M enzyme mod
(lhv_0028). A broader BLAST search confirmed that these
genes only occurred in organisms capable of survival in a
dairy environment with homologues in Pediococcus, Ruminococcus and Clostridia species. These 4 restriction modification genes, lhv_1031, lhv_1152, lhv_1978, lhv_0028
are therefore suitable for inclusion in our barcode as dairy
specific genes.

It is not clear as to why these R/M proteins are found only
in the dairy organisms and not those found in a gut environment. One possibility may be that higher populations
of bacteria are present in the dairy environment they may
be more susceptible to phage attacks and therefore require
more R/M pathways. The dairy environment usually
involves the growth of the starter strains to numbers that
are very high when compared to the numbers reached by
similar species in other environmental niches and the
same starter strains are often used repeatedly over
extended periods of time. Use of starter cultures in this
manner is known to facilitate the development of populaPage 5 of 9

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:50

tions of bacteriophage specific to the cultures in use. Prior
to the development of modern defined strain starters the
starter used in milk fermentations would have contained
a number of different strains and over a long period of
time strains with r/m systems would be expected to predominate as these systems would offer some protection
against bacteriophage attack. Even prior to the development of the modern dairy industry and strain selection
techniques the use of back-slopping would ensure that
only strains from successful fermentations were propagated in future fermentations. Therefore during the long
history of fermented milk products there was a strong
selective pressure towards phage resistant strains even
before the existence of bacteriophage was known.

metabolism genes [1]. The region is flanked by IS elements and unique 12-bp direct repeat (tcatctactttc)
sequences, which further supports the theory that it has
been laterally transferred. S. thermophilus has more than
50 regions of anomalous GC content, most of which are
associated with genes of relevance to milk adaptation. A
region of particular interest is a fragment which is 95%
identical to the metC gene from Lb. delbrueckii. The product of the metC gene allows methionine biosynthesis, a
rare amino acid in milk. This high level of identity suggests a recent lateral gene transfer event between two distantly related species occupying the same environmental
niche [13].
These regions of laterally transferred genes are consistent
with recently acquired chromosomal regions or genomic
islands that have been described in the multi-niche bacterium Lb. plantarum [37], but not in the gut specific bacteria. These genomic islands are thought to increase the
ability of Lb. plantarum to adapt to multiple environmental niches [38]. Of the other multi-niche bacteria, they
have evolved in different ways to be able to adapt to multiple niches. Lb. sakei was isolated from meat but can also
survive the gut. To this end, it has acquired (most likely
through lateral gene transfer) numerous additional metabolic and stress genes allowing it to adapt to a multitude
of environmental niches [39]. In specific environmental
niches, particularly dairy, plasmids are undoubtedly of
significant importance. Plasmids, which are omnipresent
in LAB, often encode for genes with technologically
important traits and are also seen as major contributors to
the metabolic capabilities of a cell. For example, Lb. salivarius harbours three plasmids which consist of additional
metabolic genes, increasing the overall metabolic capacity
and perhaps allowing it to survive in a variety of environmental niches [20].

Proposed mechanism of niche adaptation
Niche adaptation occurs in a number of ways, namely
gene loss or decay, lateral gene transfer or gene up regulation or mutation. In LAB, there is evidence for all of these
mechanisms. The high number of pseudogenes in the
dairy LAB provides us with striking evidence of gene loss
(Table 1). Lb. helveticus, Lb. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus
have 217, 533 and 180 pseudogenes, respectively, whilst
the gut bacteria, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. johnsonii and Lb. reuteri
have no pseudogenes and Lb. gasseri and Lb. salivarius having just 48 and 49, respectively. These pseudogenes are
non-functional due to frameshift, nonsense mutation and
deletion or truncation. The functional categories into
which these pseudogenes fall is interesting; the majority
of the pseudogenes appear to be essential gut-living genes,
including those involved in carbohydrate and amino acid
metabolism and transport and bile salt hydrolysis. In the
case of Lb. delbrueckii, the remarkably high number of
pseudogenes is indicative of ongoing adaptation and
genome specialisation. An example of this is the bile salt
hydrolase gene of Lb. helveticus, which is frameshifted at
nucleotide position 417 which introduces a stop codon,
rendering the gene inactive.

Conclusion

There is also strong evidence of lateral gene transfer events
in the form of fluctuations in the GC content of the
genomes. Lb. delbrueckii has a higher than average GC content of 49%, mostly due to differences at codon position
3. The evolution at codon position 3 is much faster than
position 1 or 2, suggesting that Lb. delbrueckii is in an
active state of genome evolution[36]. Within the Lb. delbrueckii genome, there is still evidence of lateral gene
transfer with regions of GC content as high as 52%. The
most notable of these regions contains an ABC transporter
gene which allows protocooperation with S. thermophilus.
In Lb. helveticus, there is a 100 KB section with a GC content of 42% (5% higher that the rest of the genome).
Localised within this region are numerous assumed dairy
specific genes including those involved in fatty acid

The dairy strain Lb. helveticus DPC4571 and the gut strain
Lb. acidophilus NCFM share remarkable genetic relatedness
despite coming from such differing niches. We performed
an all-against-all BLAST search between Lb. helveticus
DPC4571 and Lb. acidophilus NCFM, which identified 626
genes that differed between the two, potential niche identifier genes. Using a threshold of 1e-10 and greater than
30% identity for homologue detection we searched each
of the 626 genes against an eleven genome group. From
this analysis 9 genes emerged as being niche specific i.e.,
genes which were found solely in organisms associated
with the gut or genes found solely in organisms associated
with the dairy environment. We observed that these 9
genes were involved in characteristics desirable for gut or
dairy survival, namely sugar metabolism, the proteolytic
and R/M systems and bile-salt hydrolysis. Simultaneously
to this unbiased bioinformatic test we examined in depth

all genes involved in dairy and gut characteristic traits for
niche-specific genes and interestingly we ended up with
the same 9 gene "barcode". These 9 "barcode" genes were
further validated by performing wider homology searches,
using the same homology detection thresholds to ensure
that the gut-specific genes were not present in other dairy
organisms and vice versa and the 9 gene "barcode" was
maintained.
This gene set while limited may provide a useful initial
guide to researchers to probe a strains genetic origin. We
propose that using the gene-set as a guide; researchers may
be able to design primers for their desired "niche" and
determine the organism's ability to survive the niche.
Undoubtedly this barcode will have to be continuously
monitored and further validated as more genomes are
sequenced to uphold its accuracy. Additionally there is
always the potential for dairy organisms to be introduced
to the gut environment through functional food which
may lead to them evolving to survive in this environment,
for this reason also, we must constantly monitor and
update the barcode.

features and niche of the genomes). These genomes were
chosen based on a number of criteria; their phylogenetic
proximity to Lb. acidophilus NCFM and Lb. helveticus
DPC4571, their availability in the public database and
their proven ability to survive a dairy or gut niche.
Determination of the gene set ("Barcode")
The initial selections were based on an unbiased "all
against all" comparison of the Lb. acidophilus NCFM and
Lb. helveticus DPC4571 genomes. A manual comparison
of the two genomes was undertaken producing a gene list
containing potential "gut" genes (those present in NCFM
only) and "dairy" genes (those present in DPC4571 only).
The differences in the DPC4571 and Lb. acidophilus NCFM
gene sets were complied visually using ACT (Artemis
Comparison Tool) [42] and from GAMOLA [43] BLASTP
outputs. The strain specific gene sets were verified by
FASTA [44] searches of the DPC4571 and NCFM sequence
data using the Kodon software package (Applied Maths,
Inc.). From this we established a preliminary barcode of
genes which formed the basis for our search of other
genomes.

An additional verification of the barcode was performed
by a homology search of each of the potential barcode
genes against all fully sequenced Lactic Acid Bacterial
genomes (source http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/
genom_table.cgi).
Simultaneously we identified gene-sets of desirable nichecharacteristics and performed biased searches within
these groups. For each characteristic known genes where
identified from ERGO and the literature and BLAST
searches were performed against the 11 genome set. From
this we established the same barcode of genes as the unbiased test.
"Barcode" Validation
For each candidate gene in the 'gut' and 'dairy' gene-set,
homologous genes, if present, were identified in the 9

other genomes listed above using the Genomic BLAST
[45] web server at NCBI. This server is an expansion of the
original BLAST [46] program, which allows you to search
for homology within specified genomes. Criteria for
homologue detection were a threshold of 1e-10 and greater
than 30% identity. Genes which were determined to be
suitable for the barcode, based on 'gut' or 'dairy' criteria,
were further validated through a BLAST search against a
non-redundant database. If a potential gut identifier gene
was found in a non-gut organism outside of our initial ten
organisms, it was not included in the barcode. The same
rule was followed for potential dairy identifier genes.

Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic supertree was constructed using 47 ribosomal proteins from the 12 species, as well as from Bacillus
subtilis which was used as an outgroup as previously
reported [6]. Proteins were individually aligned using
ClustalW [47] and protein trees were built using the
PHYLIP [48] package. The best supertree was found using
the Most Similar Supertree (dfit) and Maximum Quartet
fit (qfit) analysis methods from the Clann package [49].
