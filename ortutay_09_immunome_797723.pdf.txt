Abstract
Background: Functioning of the immune system requires the coordinated expression and action
of many genes and proteins. With the emergence of high-throughput technologies, a great amount
of molecular data is available for the genes and proteins of the immune system. However, these
data are scattered into several databases and literature and therefore integration is needed.
Description: The Immunome Knowledge Base (IKB) is a dedicated resource for immunological
information. We identified and collected genes that are essential for the immunome. Nucleotide
and protein sequences, as well as information about the related pseudogenes are available for 893
human essential immunome genes. To allow the study of the evolution of the immune system, data
for the orthologs of human genes was collected. In addition to the human immunome, ortholog
groups of 1811 metazoan immunity genes are available with information about the evidence of their
immunity function. IKB combines three previous databases and several additional data items in an
integrated system.
Conclusion: IKB provides in one single service access to several databases and resources and
contains plenty of new data about immune system. The most recent addition is variation data on
genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels for all the immunome genes and proteins. In the
future, more data will be added on the function of these genes. The service has a free and public
web interface.

Background
The human immune system is a very complex biological
machinery in which hundreds of proteins are involved.
Lots of data is available at the molecular, structural, cellular and organ levels, in both normal and diseased states. A
comprehensive compilation and database of the human
immune system was made recently [1,2]. The term 'immunome' is used to describe all the genes and proteins taking
part in immune responses, excluding those that are widely
expressed in cell types outside the immune system.

Immunology-related genes and their corresponding proteins were collected from research articles, textbooks, and
electronic information sources for creating the immunome set. CD (cluster of differentiation) proteins for cell
surface molecules are defined by the human leukocyte differentiation antigen (HLDA) workshops [3]. In addition
to classical and alternative complement system, lectin
pathway and the components of the membrane attack
complex were included together with chemokines,
cytokines, and their receptors.

Immunodeficiency-related entries were obtained from the
ImmunoDeficiency Resource [4] and IDbases [5]. Immunology-related Gene Ontology [6] terms were utilized to
identify genes involved in immunological processes.
Genes involved in both innate and adaptive immunity
were included. Immunome genes have to be essential for
the immune system but not widely expressed in many
non-immunological cells and tissues. Thus, only those
proteasome components that play a role in the transformation to the immunoproteasome and in its regulation
were included.

proteins, the functions of immune proteins vary widely
from cell surface recognition, transcription factors, and
DNA processing to adaptor proteins, etc. Entries in the
Immunome registry include cross references to UniProt
and GenBank, official Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [13] names as well as alternative names,
and information of location in chromosomes (Fig. 1). For
functional annotation, Gene Ontology (GO) [6] terms are
provided. In addition, we have manually classified the
proteins based on the immunological processes in which
they are involved.

Vertebrate immunoglobulins, B and T cell receptors and
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) members were
excluded from the immunome because they are formed
from gene fragments and thus do not represent complete
genomic genes. Further, these are already well covered in
the international ImMunoGeneTics information system
(IMGT) [7] and IMGT/HLA database [8].

ImmTree was developed to explore the molecular evolution of the immune system. Orthologous genes for those
in the human immunome were identified from HomoloGene [14], EGO [15] and OrthoMCL [16]. In addition to
information for sequences and substitution rates for
human-mouse comparisons, there are multiple sequence
alignments and phylogenetic trees, calculated with parsimony methods, available.

The immunome dataset serves many kinds of research
ranging from evolutionary studies to systems biology,
structural biology, and immunodeficiencies, etc. We have
previously analyzed the human immunome genes and
proteins and constructed a database for the Immunome
[2], investigated the molecular evolution of the immunome and released for that purpose the ImmTree database
[9]; and studied and identified orthologs for metazoan
immunome genes and collected them in ImmunomeBase
[10]. To allow studies in all these datasets it became necessary to integrate the individual registries. While doing so
we updated the registries and added several new data
items so that the new Immunome Knowledge Base (IKB)
facilitates versatile and comprehensive studies of the
immune system. As an example of the utilization of the
integrated data, we recently found that the efficiency of
the protein interaction network of the immunome
increases during evolution [11], which is against the current paradigm for small world networks. Protein interaction network information and Gene Ontologies of
immune genes allowed us to prioritize novel immunodeficiency candidate genes based on data in IKB [12].

ImmunomeBase is a multi-species database of immunity
that contains metazoan ortholog gene groups. Human
immunome genes, along with others specific for some
other organisms identified from literature and databases,
were used as seeds in reciprocal BLAST searches against
the non-redundant protein database. A two-level system
was developed for the grouping of orthologs.
Update and addition of new entries
Several new genes/proteins have been added to the integrated IKB. Originally there were 847 genes and now there
are 893 in the human immunome dataset. Correspondingly, the number of data items have grown to 2954 multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees and
1059 level 1 and 1147 level 2 ortholog groups for 1811
metazoan seed genes. Altogether 46 new genes were
included and with the new variation data approximately
100000 new data items were added.

As new genes are identified and related to immunological
processes the number of genes in IKB will grow in the
future. IKB will be frequently updated.

Construction and content
Immunome, ImmTree and ImmunomeBase databases
The three previously released databases, Immunome,
ImmTree and ImmunomeBase, contain different but
related information. To allow a seamless combination of
information from these resources they were integrated to
the IKB (Fig. 1).

The immunome data is based on an exhaustive analysis of
literature and databases, originally yielding 847 genes
[1,2]. Because adaptive and innate immunity collectively
include very large number of biological responses and

Utility and Discussion
The scope and coverage of IKB was expanded by new
information. Genetic variations were integrated from the
ImmunoDeficiency Mutation Databases (IDbases) [5],
currently available for some 130 genes. These repositories
contain over 5000 patient cases. Copy number variations
(CNVs) were taken from the Database of Genomic Variants [17], in which information has been collected from
several large-scale experiments. CNV data is currently
available for 368 immunome genes.

Data content and integration in the Immunome Knowledge Base
Data content and integration in the Immunome Knowledge Base. Information from different sources and
databases (indicated by boxes and polygons) was compiled originally in three individual databases (grey diamonds). These resources and new additional information were combined and integrated in IKB (black diamond).
Splice variants are from the Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity registry [18]. Altogether 3681 alternative
forms for 495 human genes are included. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) originate from dbSNP [19].
54013 SNPs for 825 genes are included. Post-translational
modifications, mainly phosphorylations, were taken from
dbPTM [20], from where 2756 modifications for 394 gene
products were included.

IKB has been implemented as a relational database using
a MySQL database engine. The search engine utilizes perl
CGI scripts to provide many options for online users.
Result pages contain, in addition to IKB information,
links to primary databases as well. The user can retrieve
pre-defined groups of genes from human immunome or
even list all the available genes from IKB.

Conclusions and perspectives
Integration of the resources
The three earlier resources were integrated and new data
was added to generate the IKB (Fig. 1). First, the Immunome and ImmTree databases were merged and
crosslinked. Results for queries to immunome sequences
now have pointers also to the evolutionary information
and phylogenetic trees, whenever available. A new search
engine was developed to cover the entire resource. An
example of results for a IKBKG query is in Fig. 2. The
results allow the user to easily compare and compile information from different sources.

IKB is a comprehensive service providing information
about genes and proteins involved in immunological
processes, their evolutionary history, orthologous genes
and genetic variations at many levels including SNPs, disease-causing mutations, alternatively spliced variants and
copy number variations. In addition, variants at protein
level, i.e. post-translational modifications are included.
IKB combines three previously independent services and
several new types of information within a single service
that allows easy access and versatile queries across the
data.

Some other databases address the immune system, but
none with the scope and breadth of IKB. The Immuno
Polymorphism Database (IPD) [21] hosts databases dedicated to human Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, MHC molecules, human platelet antigens and
tumour cell lines. Information about immunoglobulins, T
cell receptors, and the MHC system of human and other
vertebrates, as well as some other related proteins, is available from the IMGT databases [7,8]. The gene fragments
in these resources are excluded from IKB, which also has a
strong emphasis on the evolution of the immune system,
providing phylogenetic trees, ortholog groups and nucleotide substitution data in addition to variation information on DNA, RNA and protein levels.
Data in IKB can be used for large scale studies targeting
immune systems. Since IKB contains immunity related
functional categories and other auxiliary data with a
broad scope, it can be used to place immunity related
research results in context of other type of data. For example, results for disease related transcriptome studies can be
analysed based on data in IKB such as ontology terms and
evolutionary information. Evolution related information
from IKB could be used to investigate how genes with
important functions in diseases have emerged and how
the functions have been conserved.
We are currently developing a system to automatically
update the database. New types of data will be added in
the near future, including protein-protein interactions of
immunome members.
