Abstract
The olfactory system meets niche- and species-specific demands by an accelerated evolution of its
odorant receptor repertoires. In this review, we describe evolutionary processes that have shaped
olfactory and vomeronasal receptor gene families in vertebrate genomes. We emphasize three
important periods in the evolution of the olfactory system evident by comparative genomics: the
adaptation to land in amphibian ancestors, the decline of olfaction in primates, and the delineation
of putative pheromone receptors concurrent with rodent speciation. The rapid evolution of
odorant receptor genes, the sheer size of the repertoire, as well as their wide distribution in the
genome, presents a developmental challenge: how are these ever-changing odorant receptor
repertoires coordinated within the olfactory system? A central organizing principle in olfaction is
the specialization of sensory neurons resulting from each sensory neuron expressing only ~one
odorant receptor allele. In this review, we also discuss this mutually exclusive expression of
odorant receptor genes. We have considered several models to account for co-regulation of
odorant receptor repertoires, as well as discussed a new hypothesis that invokes important
epigenetic properties of the system.

Introduction
Animals depend on chemosensory systems to investigate
their environments and to communicate social and reproductive status. In the mammalian olfactory system, two
anatomically distinct organs allow these functions: the
nose and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) (Fig. 1). The
main olfactory system (the nose) consists of an olfactory
sensory neuronal epithelium that detects odorant molecules and transduces odorant information to the olfactory
bulb of the brain, where it is processed into the perception
of smell. The vomeronasal organ (VNO), located just
above the roof of the mouth in most mammals, is thought
to be largely responsible for the detection of pheromones

that provide subconscious information about the social
and sexual status of individuals within the same species.
The ability to detect odorants in these two chemosensory
organs in mammals is mediated by four families of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes. The olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the main nose express two of
these families, the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family [1]
and the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) gene family [2]. The vomeronasal neurons of the VNO express the
other two families, named V1R [3] and V2R [4-6]. While
the ORs and TAARs couple to the same G-protein [2,7,8],
the V1R, V2R, and OR/TAAR genes utilize distinct signal

transduction pathways [9] and are expressed in anatomically and functionally distinct types of sensory neurons.
How does the brain make sense of a complex odorant
world? The repertoires of odorant receptors must be sufficiently large and diverse to detect and distinguish among
a vast array of odorant structures, the chemosensory
organs and processing centers of the brain must be
designed to integrate sensory neuronal activity into coherent "smells", and both the receptor repertoires and the
brain must keep pace with changing olfactory requirements associated with niche development and speciation.
In this review, we describe the evolution and genome
organization of odorant receptor repertoires in various
species, as revealed by comparative genomics, to discuss
the functional range and adaptive ability of the olfactory
system. We also describe the regulation of the expression
of these odorant receptor repertoires during development,
since, as we will discuss, OR co-regulation is the basis for
an organizing principle that permits the brain to interpret
smells. Finally, we consider a possible relationship
between these two topics – that OR co-regulation might
depend on genome organization, as it does for some other

Olfactory receptor repertoires of the main olfactory
system
The olfactory receptors (ORs) of the main nose comprise
the largest gene family in the mammalian genome. Terrestrial mammals possess a repertoire that is approximately
1,000 OR genes. According to current counts, the mouse
genome encodes at least ~1400 OR genes [10], the canine
genome encodes at least ~1000 ORs [11], the chimpanzee
genome encodes at least ~1000 ORs [12], and the human
genome encodes at least ~800 ORs [13]. OR repertoires in
fish are approximately 10-times smaller: zebrafish has 143
genes, fugu 44 genes, and tetraodon 42 genes [14]. Nevertheless, the relatively small OR repertoires in fish species
are more diverse than the large mammalian repertoires
[14,15] (Fig. 2a). In mammals, all ORs fall into two major
groups, based on sequence homology. These are termed
"Class I" (~10% of the repertoire) and "Class II" (~90% of
the repertoire). Fish ORs fall into >5 groups based on this
same criterion. Therefore, the fish OR repertoires, while
much smaller, probably respond to much more divergent
kinds of odorants; the much larger but less diverse mammalian repertoires on the other hand, will likely do better
at discriminating between structurally similar odorants.

Interestingly, the smaller family of Class I ORs in mammals are described as "fish-like", because they share greatest sequence homology with fish OR families [15-19] (Fig.
2a). This observation raises the possibility that less "fishlike" Class II OR repertoires are more recent adaptations
to life on land. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Class
II OR repertoires in mammals coalesce to about the time
of the common ancestor with amphibians (Fig. 2b).
Moreover, the amphibian X. laevis exclusively expresses
Class I ORs in the water-filled diverticulum of their nasal
cavities, and expresses Class II ORs in the air-filled diverticulum of their nasal cavities [16]. These observations
suggest that when our ancestors began to occupy niches
on land, much of the current diversity seen in the mammalian Class II repertoires arose, and these more recently
evolved ORs were adapted for the detection of airborne
(or volatile) odorants [17,19].
The invertebrate odorant receptor repertoires identified in
the fly [20-22] and worm [23,24] genomes share no
sequence homology to each other or to those in vertebrates. The chemosensory receptor repertoire in
Caenorhabditis elegans, like mammals, is large (>800 ORs)
and diverse (five distinct families). In contrast, the Drosophila melanogaster genome encodes only a single family
of ~60 OR genes. Therefore, the absolute size of OR reper-

toires does not seem to correlate with behavioral sophistication (worms and humans have repertoires that are ~10times the size of flies and fish). Also, the lack of homology
between odorant receptor repertoires of invertebrates and
vertebrates suggests that the evolutionary requirement for
distinct olfactory abilities in these species is met by
recruitment of novel gene families rather than exploiting
preexisting families in ancestral genomes.

V1R and V2R repertoires of the vomeronasal organ
The vomeronasal receptor (VR) gene familes, V1R and
V2R, expressed in the second mammalian chemosensory
organ, the VNO, also exemplify independent gene family
recruitment during evolution. These two families share no
sequence similarity to each other, nor to any of the
numerous, diverse OR families described above. Complete V1R repertoires have been described in a number of

mammalian species, including mouse, rat, opossum, dog,
cow, chimpanzee, and human [10,25-29], as well as five
fish species [30]. The mouse and human V1R repertoires
were the first to be characterized, and the >150 putative
functional V1Rs in mouse seemed likely to be representative of mammals, whereas the merely ~5 intact V1Rs in
humans seemed exceptional. This perspective was reasonable, since mouse, like most mammals, makes extensive
use of their olfactory systems for social and reproductive
communication, whereas humans do not seem to be as
reliant on these forms of communication. Consistent with
this view, the human VNO is probably non-functional
[31]. Moreover, the human TRP2 ion channel, required
for mouse VNO function, is a pseudogene [32-34], and at
least one of the intact human V1Rs is expressed in the
main olfactory epithelium [35]. Surprisingly, however,
subsequent characterization of other mammalian V1R
repertoires suggests that the large functional repertoire in
rodents may be more exceptional. Chimpanzee has no
intact V1R genes [29], and dog, cow, and opossum have
only 8 [29], 32 [28], and 49 [28] intact V1R genes, respectively. Rat, on the other hand, has at least 107 intact V1Rs
[29]. These observations suggest that rodents may have
evolved specialized and more complex functions for the
VNO than these non-rodent mammalian species. Consistent with this perspective, the morphological complexity
of the rodent VNO is proportionately greater than other
mammalian species [28,36].
The large rodent V1R repertoires consist of at least 12–13
distinct subfamilies [25]. The duplication events that gave
rise to these divergent subfamilies probably took place
prior to mammalian divergence, because each of these
12–13 subfamilies is represented in the large V1R pseudogene content of other mammals [29]. Thus, it is proposed
that most of the ancestral V1R functions were lost in
mammals, except for in rodents where, in contrast, many
of these ancestral functions have expanded by extensive
gene duplications. Of note is the identification of a single
V1R-like sequence in fish [30], which is expressed along
with ORs in their single chemosensory organ (fish do not
possess a VNO). Although V1Rs have not yet been characterized in amphibians, it is tempting to speculate that V1R
diversification, like Class II OR diversification, occurred in
vertebrate ancestors as they adapted to land, and evolved
a separate VNO that could support more sophisticated
pheromonal behaviors, like territorial marking and reproductive display (e.g., [37-39]).
Some of the mouse and rat V1R subfamilies delineate
along species lines. Striking examples include two subfamilies in which all of the mouse and all of the rat genes
partition into separate clades of a phylogenetic tree [26],
suggesting post-speciation expansion and specialization,
and two subfamilies in which the rat genes have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

deleted [29], suggesting species-specific capabilities exclusive for mouse. Similar lineage-specific diversification of
mouse and rat V2R subfamilies is observed [40]. Interestingly, duplication events that produced species-specific
delineations in some of the V1R subfamilies have been
dated to a short period of evolution approximately when
mice and rat speciated [26], suggesting that this diversification might have been favored to reinforce species divergence. These examples suggest strong delineation of VNO
function between these two rodent species. Species-specificity in V1R and V2R repertoires could be part of an explanation to account for how pheromone communication
occurs within but not between species.
Mouse and rat V2R receptor repertoires are approximately
the same size as their V1R repertoires and composed of
~100 intact genes [40]. A recent analysis of several mammalian genome assemblies suggests that V2Rs, like V1Rs,
are more prominent in rodent than non-rodent mammals, with opossum being an exception. The comparatively large opossum repertoire of ~49 intact V1R genes
[28] and ~90 intact V2R genes [41] appears to be consistent with the presence of a well-developed vomeronasal
organ in this marsupial mammal. In fish, V2R repertoires
tend to be much larger than V1R repertoires, and comparable to their OR repertoire sizes [42]. As observed for
rodent gene families, fish V2R evolution includes lineagespecific expansions, presumably to support adaptations to
conspecific small-peptide cues [43].
In summary, the olfactory systems of insects, worms, fish,
and mammals utilize at least nine, evolutionarily distinct
odorant receptor gene families adapted to their very different niches. In vertebrates, the defining evolutionary
moment occurred as amphibian-like ancestors adapted to
land, when the Class II ORs expanded and diversified. The
repertoires of trace amine-associated receptors and putative pheromone receptors, V1R and V2R, are at least tentimes smaller than the OR repertoire sizes in all mammalian species so far characterized. V1R and V2R repertoire
size and diversity, like VNO morphological complexity, is
highly variable among mammals, and these differences
might contribute to species-specificity in VNO function.
We next consider evolutionary mechanisms that have
contributed to species specific adaptations in odorant
receptor repertoires.

Adaptive evolution of odorant receptor
repertoires
Even before genomes were sequenced and complete odorant receptor repertoires had been characterized, the
dynamic evolutionary history of odorant receptor genes
was evident. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific OR probes on metaphase human chromosomes
revealed patterns of very recent duplications and chromo-

somal translocations [44,45]. Strikingly, some of these OR
gene duplications appear to have occurred so recently that
they produce copy number polymorphisms in the human
population [46]. These observations suggest that OR repertoires are not fixed in populations, and that the olfactory system is constantly generating new genes that are
likely to underlie adaptive evolutionary innovations.
Gene duplication and gene conversion
The OR repertoire in terrestrial vertebrates has expanded
approximately 10-fold since the common ancestor with
aquatic fish, approximately 370 million years ago. This
wave of expansion is believed to reflect adaptations of the
olfactory system to meet new requirements and opportunities in non-aquatic environments [19]. The earliest
duplication events gave rise to the major families of Class
II ORs found in all mammals. Following this initial phase
of expansion, individual OR subfamilies have expanded
locally to generate large gene clusters [19,47-50]. Segmental duplications between chromosomes have also contributed to wide distribution of OR clusters, which are found
on nearly every chromosome in the mouse and human
genomes [44,45,49]. These and other comparative
genomics studies have revealed some general principles
about OR evolutionary mechanisms, that also seem to
apply to TAAR, V1R, and V2R evolution [10,26-29,40,5155]. First, tandem duplications, presumably mediated by
unequal crossover during meiosis, have resulted in a predominance of relatively homogenous clusters; that is, tandem arrays of closely-related genes (e.g., [10,19,47]).
Second, gene conversion and recombination events generate mosaic receptor sequences, and potentially, might
contribute to the re-birth of OR pseudogenes during evolution [56]. Third and alternatively, gene conversion of
entire coding regions can result in homogenization
whereby the overall diversity of the OR and VR repertoires
is reduced via replacement of one paralogous sequence
with another [56]. Fourth, duplication events have probably been facilitated at OR and VR loci by retrotransposon
activity. The dense populations of retrotransposons
within OR and VR gene clusters indicates a history of frequent DNA breaks during retrotransposition, as well as
increased opportunity for repeat-mediated misalignments
to cause unequal crossovers during meiosis
[19,26,50,52,57]. Overall, evolution of OR and VR genes
has been a dynamic process of expansion, diversification,
and modulation, resulting in the generation of large tandem clusters that are widely distributed in the genome.
Adaptive selective pressures acting on duplicated ORs
Since mutations occur randomly, and therefore equally in
silent and non-silent positions of a gene, an observed bias
for silent mutations (that do not alter amino acid code) or
non-silent mutations (that alter amino acid code) indicates whether selection has favored stasis or adaptation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

The Ka:Ks ratio, a ratio of the rate of non-synonymous
(amino-acid changing) substitution to the rate of synonymous (or silent) substitution in coding sequences, is used
in this way to assess selective forces acting on gene pairs
since their common ancestry. Sequences under purifying
(or negative) selection will exhibit Ka:Ks ratios significantly less than 1 (i.e., a much higher rate of synonymous
substitution); most gene sequences are under purifying
selection, because most often, genes are well adapted and
fixed, thus changing the amino acid code is selected
against. Sequences under adaptive (or positive) selection
will exhibit Ka:Ks ratios significantly greater than 1 (i.e., a
much higher rate of non-synonymous substitution), indicating that selection is acting against genes that do not
evolve new functions. Sequences not subject to selective
pressure (neutral sequences) will exhibit Ka:Ks ratios of
approximately 1, indicating that neither silent nor nonsilent mutations have been favored.
Analysis of OR, V1R, and V2R sequences reveals that different portions of the gene are exhibiting different selective pressures. For example, analysis of 136 intact
zebrafish OR genes suggest that four specific sites within
the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3,
TM4) and the third extracellular loop of these GPCRs is
under adapative selection, whereas the remainder of the
coding sequence is under purifying selection [14]. Similar
studies conducted on sets of mouse, rat and fish OR genes
point to specific sequences encoding residues in transmembrane domains that exhibit high Ka:Ks ratios
[53,58]. While no crystal structure of an OR or VR protein
has been solved, homology modeling to the rhodopsin
[59] or metabotropic glutamate receptor [60] GPCR structures and their ligands, as well as energy minimization
modeling of receptor-ligand interactions, suggest that the
hydrophobic surfaces of TM 3–7 in mammalian ORs is
likely where ligand binding occurs (e.g., [61-64]). Specific
residues predicted to lie within these putative hydrophobic ligand-binding spaces generally appear to be hypervariable in evolution (Fig. 3). Similar observations have been
made for V1R and V2R subsequences [40,52,53,55,65]; in
fact, Ka:Ks ratios are generally higher in V1Rs than ORs
[10], possibly reflecting increased pressures to adapt independent pheromone responsiveness during speciation.
Like ORs, hypervariable residues in V1Rs and V2Rs correspond to areas of the protein structure predicted to be
within putative ligand-binding domains [40,53]. These
data suggest selection for duplicated ORs, V1Rs, and V2Rs
to adapt new ligand-binding properties, possibly favored
in order to meet the demands and opportunities of new
niches and speciation.
OR polymorphisms within populations
The selective forces that have favored adaptive changes in
OR and VR proteins between species also seem to operate

within species. Like antigen receptor genes of the immune
system, the odorant receptor genes of the olfactory system
exhibit high allelic variation in the population [46].
Allelic variation probably accounts for observed differences in olfactory perception among individuals in the
human population [66,67] and between mouse strains
[68,69], although genetic variation in any of the peripheral and central components of the olfactory system must
also be considered. It has been estimated that the incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
mouse OR gene coding regions is about twice that of other
mouse GPCRs [10]. Studies in two additional species,
humans and dogs, illustrate the biological significance of
OR variation. Comparison of 32 OR loci in human subpopulations illustrates that, for example, Caucasians tend
to have a higher frequency of non-functional alleles as
compared to Pygmy populations [70]. Another study of
51 human highly polymorphic OR loci came to a similar
conclusion that functional and non-functional alleles correlate with ethnicity [71]. It is tempting to speculate that
variation of ORs in human subpopulations was due to
adaptation to different environments and diets during
human migration. Dog ORs, like human and mouse, are
highly polymorphic. In a study of 16 OR genes in 20 different breeds of dogs, >50% of the SNPs (55 of 98 polymorphisms) generated an amino acid change, and several
alleles appear to be breed specific [72]. Given the significant differences in abilities that have been selected in various dog breeds, it will be interesting to further investigate
the extent to which allelic variation correlates with breeds
whose domestic functions rely more heavily on olfaction.
Genetic variation in OR repertoires might not only be due
to polymorphic nucleotide substitutions, but in addition,
to copy number polymorphisms. Copy number polymorphisms arise by recent gene duplications that render some
individuals in the population with "extra OR copies". For
example, the cluster of ORs found in the subtelomeric
regions of chromosome 19 has variable duplication histories in the human population [46]. Analysis of 45 individuals from eight ethnic groups reveals that 7–11 copies of
this cluster are identified at subtelomeres of other chromosomes. The biological significance of these copy
number polymorphisms is unknown.
Pseudogeneization and decline of olfactory functions
To this point we have discussed "gene birth": duplication
and adaptation as evolutionary mechanisms that have
permitted animals to expand into new environmental territories and diverge during speciation. The other side of
this evolutionary process is "gene death". Non-functional
OR, V1R, and V2R pseudogenes are abundant in mammalian genomes, and especially so in primate genomes.
There is a lower percentage of Class I pseudogenes than
Class II pseudogenes in human (52% versus 77%), dog

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

(17% versus 23%), and rat (13% versus 20%) [19,73].
Class I genes have also not undergone extensive duplications like the Class II repertoires. These trends might indicate that some ancestral fish-like odorant-binding
functions have been fixed in mammalian genomes.
The human genome contains ~800 OR genes, yet >50% of
these are pseudogenes [19,74]. In contrast, of the ~1400
mouse OR genes, only ~20% are pseudogenes [47,69].
Even compared to other primate species, human OR coding regions have accumulated pseudogenes ~4-times
faster than chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaques
[75]. Nevertheless, the subfamily representation in the
intact repertoire of human ORs is the same as in mouse
[47,76], suggesting that humans are able to smell as broad
a range of odorants as other mammalian species, but have
probably lost some discriminatory ability. It has been proposed that the decline in human olfactory ability might
have been concurrent with bipedalism and the advent of
a dominant visual system (e.g., [76-78]).
The V1R "death" process is even more extreme than the
decline of ORs in primate lineages [29,79-81]. In humans,
98% of V1R-like sequences identified in the genome are
pseudogenes; in chimpanzee, there are no intact V1R-like
sequences (100% pseudogenes) [29]. VNO-mediated
pheromone perception declined in humans and Old
World monkeys, coincident with the evolution of trichromatic color vision and dominance of the primate visual
system [82]. But, even in rodents, the V1R pseudogene
content, at least as compared to their OR pseudogene content, is high (~45% and ~50% in mouse and rat, respectively) [10,25,29]. Therefore, dynamic processes of gene
death (excessive pseudogenization and gene deletion) as
well as gene birth (by duplication and positive selection)
have played significant roles in shaping rodent V1R repertoires.
Cluster organization in the genome
The large, diverse repertoire of mammalian odorant receptors is organized in clusters at various chromosomal locations in the genome (Fig. 4a). Generally, these clusters are
arrays of closely related genes, reflecting an evolutionary
history of recent tandem duplications. OR and V1R clusters are compact: OR coding sequences are single, ~1-kb
coding exons [1], and they are densely packed with an
average of ~25 kb spacing between neighboring coding
regions [47,69]. In general, these clusters are rarely interrupted by non-OR/V1R genes (e.g., [19,52]) and occupy
repeat-rich (especially Line1-rich) regions of the genome
[19,26,52](Fig. 4b). We will return later to these attributes
of OR and V1R clusters – compact, gene-poor and repeatrich – when we consider the possibility that gene co-regulation is related to genome organization.

genes. The major V1R gene clusters are located on chromosome 6, 7, 13 and 17. Figure adapted from [10], Copyright (2003),

the map (as shown in the UCSC Genome Browser: http://genome.ucsc.edu). The density of LINE1 populations is much higher
within the V1R cluster than in surrounding flanking regions.

OR clusters are variable in size, and some ORs are unclustered. The largest human OR locus contains 116 ORs [13]
and the largest mouse locus contains 244 ORs [76]. In
humans, nearly half of the OR repertoire, including the
entire set of Class I ORs, is present in two super-clusters on
chromosome 11. Human OR genes are found at >100 loci
and on all chromosomes except 20 and Y [19], and therefore are more dispersed than mouse OR genes, which are
found at ~50 loci [44,47]. Much of this difference is due
to the recently duplicated subtelomeric and pericentric
clusters in humans [83]. It might be tempting to speculate
that the subteleromeric/pericentric human OR clusters are
simply neutral duplications of non-functional genes,
however, the incidence of pseudogenes within these clus-

ters is not higher than in other chromosomal locations
[13].
Rodent VR genes also reside in well defined clusters in the
genome [29]. Overall, ~94% of rodent V1Rs are located
within clusters. In contrast, V1R repertoires in dog, chimpanzee, and human are much more dispersed: ~40% of
V1Rs in these species are isolated in the genome [29].
Interestingly, analysis of intact versus pseudogene distributions suggests that isolated V1Rs in rodents and other
mammals are more likely to be pseudogenes [29]. This
observation hints of selective pressures to maintain functional genes together in the genome. We speculate that
clustering might be favored in order to organize ORs and

V1Rs within genome regulatory domains, a possibility we
discuss in the following sections.

Co-regulation of odorant receptor repertoires
In the previous sections, we have discussed the evolution
of odorant receptor repertoires. Although there is evidence of fixation of some ancestral functions, such as
Class I ORs in mammals [19,84] or specific OR orthologs
between mouse and human (e.g., [47,85,86]), this evolutionary history can be described as "volcanic" – frequent
gene duplication, gene deletion, recombination, gene
conversion, pseudogenization, and positive selection
have shaped very different repertoires between and within
species. Rapid evolution is also a hallmark of multigene
families of the immune system, like MHC gene families
[87], which contrasts the evolutionary history of metabolic, regulatory, or developmental genes that tend to be
fixed. The olfactory system, like the immune system, functions via interaction with the environment, and thus,
must evolve at pace with changes in these environments.
Also, since different species live in different niches (with
different immune and olfactory requirements), there
exists selective pressures to modulate both systems concurrent with speciation. In the olfactory system, the result
is an ever-changing and widely distributed repertoire of
odorant receptor genes in the genome.
Regulatory and developmental processes, as mentioned,
are well buffered from the environment and generally,
there is strong selection against "re-inventing" these systems in each species. For example, the assembly of a functional olfactory system is likely to be a conserved
developmental process in mammals. Thus, we arrive at an
interesting paradox. How might fixed regulatory processes
used in the development of the olfactory system accommodate ever-changing odorant receptor components?
Specifically, as we will next discuss, the assembly of a
coherent olfactory system depends on the mutual co-regulation of odorant receptor repertoires in the genome.
Thus, this paradox can be restated in a gene regulatory
context: how does the presumably fixed odorant receptor
regulatory process keep pace with the dynamic evolution
of its target genes? Such a regulatory process would seem
to be flexible, to accommodate new target genes, and
involve genome-wide surveillance, to accommodate the
variability in genome location of these target genes.
The central organizing principle in the olfactory system is
based on OSN specialization
The sense of smell begins in the sensory organ, the nose or
VNO, where inhaled odorant molecules interact with
odorant receptor proteins expressed on the surfaces of
sensory neurons. Upon binding an odorant, a receptor
signals the presence of the odorant through its associated
G-protein, which eventually stimulates an action poten-

tial in the responding neuron [7,9]. How does the brain
interpret what the organism is smelling, given the complexity of odorant mixtures and the sheer numbers of
odorant receptors involved in the sensory process? The
emerging view, based on several lines of study in primarily
mouse and rat, is that olfactory coding is combinatorial:
sensory neurons are specialized to recognize a narrow
range of odorant chemistry, and particular "smells" are
coded by discrete combinations of sensory neurons
responding to the mixture of odorants in that "smell"
[88].
This central organizing principle presents two developmental challenges. First, how do sensory neurons become
dedicated to particular chemical attributes? And second,
how does the brain know which combination of sensory
neurons are responding to a particular smell? The answer
to the first question, which is the main focus of the
remainder of this review, seems to be that the large repertoire of odorant receptor genes in the genome is transcriptionally regulated such that each sensory neuron expresses
one, or perhaps a small number, of odorant receptors. In
this way, each sensory neuron is specialized to the odorant binding capabilities of the receptor(s) it expresses. The
answer to the second question, which is beyond the scope
of this review, is that all sensory neurons that express a
particular receptor are guided to a common, stereotyped
target glomerulus in the olfactory bulb [89-91]. In this
way, the precise combination of responding sensory neurons is represented by a precise pattern of glomeruli activity, which is the internal representation of a particular
smell that the animal can recognize, remember, and
respond to.
Odorant receptor genes are expressed in a mutual
exclusive way
The specialization of sensory neurons in the olfactory system is accomplished by mutual exclusive expression of
odorant receptor genes; that is, each sensory neuron
expresses ~one odorant receptor, and is therefore functionally specialized. Initial evidence for singular OR
expression in OSNs was from in situ hybridization studies
conducted in rodent olfactory epithelium. Each OR tested
had its expression confined to topological zones in the
epithelium, and within a zone, the OR is expressed in a
"punctate" pattern (i.e., in a seemingly random collection
of neurons) [92-95]. The fraction of cells transcribing any
particular OR is approximately one in a thousand
(~0.1%), which is predicted by the one neuron-one receptor hypothesis if there are ~1000 ORs in the repertoire. A
more compelling line of evidence for singular OR expression comes from single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments using
degenerate primers that are capable of amplifying ~70%
of all OR templates [96]. In these studies, only one OR

BMC Neuroscience 2007, 8(Suppl 3):S2

template is amplified from individual sensory neurons.
However, the false negative rate is high – more than half
of the cells tested do not produce any product – indicating
that these experiments might underestimate the actual OR
content per cell.
Additional evidence for singular OR expression comes
from observations that pairs of a OR genes/alleles do not
co-express in individual OSNs. Allelic exclusion was demonstrated using allele-specific PCR [97], and monogenic
expression is supported by double labeling experiments,
in which distinct genes never/very rarely are observed to
co-express in individual cells [98,99].
Like ORs, TAARS and V1Rs seem to express in a mutually
exclusive manner [2][100]. There is also transgenic and in
situ hybridization evidence for monogenic and monoallelic expression of V2R genes [5,6,37], however, a recent
study found that members of at least one V2R subfamily
violate the one neuron-one receptor allele rule [101].
Since TAAR, VR and OR genes do not share homology,
and are expressed in different sensory neurons, it is presumed that the similar monogenic/monoallelic regulatory
strategy has been independently adopted in these systems.
There is no evidence for a common molecular mechanism
underlying these similar regulatory features, although this
remains an interesting possibility.
How is singular OR expression accomplished?
How is a vast and ever-changing repertoire of OR genes,
dispersed over numerous chromosomes, co-regulated
such that only one allele of one gene is expressed in an
olfactory sensory neuron, while keeping the remaining
alleles silenced? This remarkable problem could be solved
by either a deterministic mechanism, in which each cell is
determined by its spatial and temporal context to express
a particular OR, or a stochastic mechanism, in which for
example, each OR is competing for a limiting transcriptional complex.

The most deterministic solution is one in which each cell
expresses a specific combination of transcription factors
that is sufficient to activate only one OR. This model has
been largely dismissed because mutual exclusive OR
expression occurs even between two identical transgene
copies [98], which should be able to bind exactly the same
combination of transcription factors. Nevertheless, there
is compelling evidence that OR gene regulation is at least
partially deterministic. Initial studies suggested the existence of four discrete spatial zones in the rodent olfactory
epithelium, with any particular OR being confined to one
of these four zones [94,95]. More recent studies suggest
less defined zonal boundaries inside the epithelium –
there may exist numerous segregated but partially overlapping zones along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MOE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

[102-106]. Moreover, there seems to be spatial bias within
zones; for example, the P2 OR exhibits a bias for expression in the posterior margins of its epithelial zone [107].
Other sets of ORs are expressed in non-canonical (e.g.,
medial) zones of the olfactory epithelium [108]. In addition, class I ORs exhibit a common promoter organization
and expression pattern [109]. Thus, there seems to be spatial "rules" for OR expression, implying the presence of
transcription factors that specify position in the MOE.
Less well understood are temporal properties of OR
expression, since most rodent studies have been conducted on adult animals. Studies in zebrafish, however,
suggest that OR expression is partially dependent on
developmental stage [110,111]. In total, these observations suggest the presence of transcription factors that, in
a deterministic way, establish constraints on which OR
genes are able to be expressed at a given time and place
during development. The continuous, partially overlapping expression zones along the dorsal-ventral axis hint
that a gradient of one or more signaling molecules might
be a deterministic force [103].
Deterministic mechanisms predict constancy in the
number of OSNs expressing a particular OR from animal
to animal. Mouse-to-mouse variability in the numbers of
positive cells for various ORs that have been tested seems
to be in the 5–10% range [112], suggesting that the animal is not pre-programmed to generate a precise number
of OSN types, as would be predicted by absolute deterministic models. Moreover, ablation of OSNs expressing a
particular OR gene does not lead to immediate re-population of the ablated OSN type, suggesting that OR choice
during OSN regeneration is not regulated in a deterministic way [113]. Most importantly, as mentioned previously,
a deterministic mechanism for singular OR expression, in
which OR choice is determined by spatial and/or temporal transcription factors, does not account for why identical cis sequences fail to respond identically to these cues
[98]. Thus, there would seem to be a stochastic, or undetermined, aspect to OR regulation.
A stochastic element to OR expression was first postulated
based on the observation that individual ORs seem to
express in random sets of neurons within a zone, with no
obvious patterning (e.g., [94]). Monoallelic expression of
maternal or paternal OR alleles also appears to be random
from cell to cell [97]. These observations point to a model
in which subsets of ORs, presumably constrained by
deterministic forces, compete stochastically for a stable
active state.
Two models for stochastic and mutually exclusive competition have been proposed. One model, based on the precedent of yeast mating type switching [114] and antigenic
variation in trypanosome parasite [115], postulates that

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Neuroscience 2007, 8(Suppl 3):S2

native OR loci compete for recombination/gene conversion into a single, transcriptionally competent locus (first
proposed in [1]). Such a model now seems unlikely,
based on two lines of evidence. First, RNA in situ experiments suggest OR transcripts are generated from native
genomic locations [99]. Second, two groups have successfully cloned a mouse from differentiated olfactory sensory
neurons [116,117], and in each case, the cloned mouse
expresses the full repertoire ORs. Thus, OR gene choice is
not irreversible, as might be predicted by changes in the
actual DNA sequence. A second model, based on a precedent of mutually exclusive expression of the trypanosome
parasite variable surface glycoproteins [118], postulates that
OR loci compete for a single regulatory complex in the
nucleus (first proposed in [85]; Fig. 5). The recent observation that active OR genes (but not inactive OR genes)
interact in trans with a single locus, termed the "Hregion", is compelling evidence for this model [119]. In
this study, only one of the two "H region" alleles was
observed to interact with the active OR locus; the second
"H region" allele becomes differentiallly methylated, and
this methylation is thought to render it inactive so that
only one "H" is active per cell. In addition, the "H-region"
had been previously identified as having strong OR
enhancing activity when positioned near an OR promoter
in transgene constructs [120]. This enhancement property, plus its apparently exclusive association with the
transcribing OR locus in olfactory sensory neurons, makes
the "H region" an excellent candidate locus for assembly
of a single regulatory complex with which only one OR
gene can associate per cell.
Is mutual exclusivity absolute in OR transcription?
The above stochastic models predict that mutual exclusive
expression is absolute – that cells cannot express more
than one receptor at a time. In both flies and worms,
mutual exclusivity is not absolute, and individual OSNs
have been shown to co-express ORs [23,121]. But, as mentioned previously, the olfactory system in flies and worms
bears no obvious homology to the mammalian olfactory
system, and so there is no a priori reason to presume similar organizing principles. However, it has also been
reported that some mouse V2R proteins co-express in
individual vomeronasal sensory neurons [101]. Others
report that some individual OSNs respond to chemically
divergent odorants due to co-expression of divergent
receptors (discussed in reference [122]). While most
molecular and cell biological studies strongly suggest singular OR expression, isolated counterexamples that report
OR co-expression (e.g., [98,122,123]) raise the possibility
that the transcriptional mechanism underlying exclusivity
is not necessarily absolute.

A recent discovery that production of a functional OR protein is required to ensure the "locking in" of receptor

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

choice [120,124] lends further credence to these ideas. In
these studies, it was shown that if the sensory neuron initially transcribes an OR gene that does not have an intact
open reading frame, and thus cannot be translated into a
functional OR protein, the sensory neuron will make
another OR choice. Thus, it appears that post-translational feedback is an essential part of mutual exclusivity.
Why might such a post-translational mechanism have
evolved, if the transcriptional mechanism is itself
designed to ensure mutual exclusivity? One plausible
explanation is that feedback inhibition ensures that the
sensory neuron will be productive, since the genome is
populated with OR pseudogenes that might not have yet
accumulated enough mutations to render their promoters
non-functional [120,123,124]. It is also possible that such
a post-translational feedback mechanism is needed for
mutual exclusivity because mutual exclusivity is not
ensured at the transcriptional level. Such an interpretation
seems consistent with observations that an activated OR
locus that cannot express a functional OR protein continues to be transcribed even after another OR locus is
selected [120,124], suggesting that more than one OR
promoter can indeed be active at once. Moreover, while
an active OR gene is much more likely than an inactive OR
gene to be associated with the "H region", a majority of
expressing OR genes do not appear to be associated with
the "H region" [119], suggesting that the OR-"H region"
association might be transient and not absolutely
required for ongoing OR transcription. In light of these
observations, we propose an alternative stochastic model
(described below) in which the "H region" functions to
regulate epigenetic properties of an associated OR locus,
as opposed to functioning as an ongoing activator of transcriptional machinery.
An epigenetic model for mutually exclusive OR expression
As currently proposed, the "single activating complex"
model predicts that only one OR locus can be transcribed
at once, and that ongoing association with the complex is
required to maintain OR expression throughout the life of
the sensory neuron. As discussed in the previous section,
this model does not appear to cleanly accommodate all
experimental observations. If ongoing "H-region" association is mandatory, why do some cells expressing a particular OR not exhibit an association with the "H region"
[119], and how is it possible that a non-functional OR
locus whose coding region is deleted, presumably abandoned by "H" to select a second, functional OR locus,
continues to be transcribed [124]? One possible explanation is that the "H region" is only transiently required. In
this alternative model, the function of the "H region"
might be to de-repress an OR locus and/or to protect the
chosen locus from the "feedback inhibition" process;
once de-repressed and the "feedback inhibition" process
is completed, the requirement of "H" might be relaxed.

Figure 5
Two stochastic models for mutually exclusive OR transcription
Two stochastic models for mutually exclusive OR transcription. Transcription factors (small triangles, circles) interact
with cis regulatory sequences to generate OR gene loci that are competent for transcription (white versus gray/black rectangles). For example, OR genes might be more or less competent for transcription based on factors that specify geographic zone
in the olfactory epithelium. a) Singular OR activating complex. A single transcriptional complex (large black circle) assembles at
one physical location in the nucleus (e.g., nuclear structure or "H region"-like sequence in the genome [119, 120]), to which
only one competent OR gene can stably associate. This model predicts that only one OR allele is physically able to be transcribed at once. In this model, feedback mechanisms might further stabilize/reinforce an OR-complex interaction or inhibit
other OR loci from competing for the complex. b) Epigenetic regulation of OR genes. This model invokes a ground state of
repression at OR loci. Deterministic factors specifying spatial or temporal information (small triangles, circles), or associated
enhancers such as the "H region", reduce repressive chromatin states, thereby increasing rates of transcription. Because the
overall transcriptional rates are nevertheless slow (even in the most activated loci), the likelihood of multiple ORs achieving a
super-threshold level of protein expression (dashed line) is reduced. Kinetic profiles representing OR transcript levels over
time (t) are shown at the bottom of the figure. Once a single OR achieves a super-threshold level of expression, a feedback
inhibition mechanism silences other OR loci (represented by abrupt descent in kinetic profiles). Such a model requires that the
selected OR locus be protected from this inhibitory process.

This model predicts that OR loci might vary in their
dependence on the "H region" according to genome context. Interestingly, the mOR28 gene as well as other ORs
in the mOR28 cluster, but unlike all other OR genes tested
[107] require an "H region" positioned in cis in order to
express from transgenes [120]; this requirement might
reflect increased dependence on "H region" interactions
(e.g., more frequent or prolonged association, as observed
in [119], in order to achieve an adequately de-repressed

state). It is also feasible that certain OR genes, by virtue of
residing within more transcriptionaly permissive chromatin domains in the genome, might be able to express independently of an "H region" interaction. Alternatively, if
the "H region" functions as part of the feedback inhibition
step, as opposed to an initial choice step, then an association with the chosen OR locus would be required, but perhaps only transiently during the moment when the
"feedback inhibition" signal is permanently silencing all

BMC Neuroscience 2007, 8(Suppl 3):S2

other OR loci. With both interpretations, the proposed
function of the "H region" is to regulate chromatin states
– the former postulates that in order for an OR locus to be
selected, chromatin de-repression by "H" is required; the
latter postulates that in order to preserve activity during
"feedback inhibition", the "H" is required to protect a
locus from chromatin silencing. Finally, a third and completely different interpretation of the data cannot yet be
ruled out: "H" might be one of numerous enhancers that
can be utilized for OR selection, so that there is no ongoing and absolute requirement of any one of these enhancers (including "H"). Such an interpretation, however,
requires an additional explanation for how only one of
these enhancers becomes active per cell; one possibility is
that one of multiple enhancers becomes active in the same
way that only one of the two "H" alleles become active
(via differential methylation).
Two of the above three interpretations of the "H region"
data invoke a fundamental dependence on chromatin
states as a "rate limiting" component of OR transcription.
Whether as a means to reduce the probability of multiple
ORs expressing prior to selection, or as a means to establish absolute silencing during "feedback inhibition", these
models predict that OR genes, like imprinted genes or
inactivated X-linked genes, can adopt a non-permissive/
silenced chromatin state in cells that otherwise express
these genes. We consider three circumstantial lines of evidence consistent with such an epigenetic model for OR
regulation. First, as was described in previous sections on
the evolution and genome organization of odorant receptor repertoires, OR and V1R genes occupy gene-poor and
repeat-rich (especially Line1-rich) regions of the genome
[19,26,52], as well as subtelomeric and pericentromeric
regions of human chromosomes [46]. Given these features, it seems plausible that OR loci are in heterochromatic or more repressed regions of the genome that are
more compatible with repeats than genes. Second, OR
and V1R genes, like imprinted genes or X-linked genes,
exhibit monoallelic transcription. As described above,
allelic exclusion of imprinted genes and random inactivation of one X chromosome depends on differential DNA
methylation patterns and the establishment of non-permissive chromatin on the silenced allele [125], and thus
OR genes share regulatory attributes with other genes
known to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. And
third, a dominant position-effect has been observed to act
on a transgene when integrated within an OR locus [108].
In this case, the transcriptional activity of an Olfactory
Marker Protein (OMP) transgene is active only within a
small region of the epithelium where the neighboring OR
is expressed. This result suggests that the chromatin at this
OR locus is generally non-permissive, and only permissive
in the subset of cells where the OR is expressed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/S3/S2

With these observations and the "H region" data in mind,
we propose an epigenetic model for OR regulation (Fig.
5B). In this model, chromatin at OR loci is generally
repressive such that OR transcription is inefficient. In this
way, the probability is reduced that multiple OR proteins
achieve a super-threshold level of expression sufficient to
trigger the "feedback inhibition" process. The probability
for "multiple winners" might be further reduced if the "H
region", or indeed other "H"-like enhancers, stochastically boost expression levels at select loci/locus. Some
loci, for example, the mOR28 locus, might depend on
such a boost in order to compete with less heterochromatic loci. Once an OR protein reaches a superthreshold
level sufficient to trigger "feedback inhibition", the chromatin states at all other loci are fully silenced. The "H
region" (or other "H"-like association), might then function to protect the locus from this silencing step. Such a
model predicts that the "H region" might not be absolutely required for activation of all OR loci, that the probability of selection will depend on ground chromatin
states, and that multiple ORs might routinely be transcribed per cell, albeit at very low (i.e., subthreshold) levels, early in this developmental process. The latter
prediction seems consistent with the low-level, multi-OR
transcription observed in non-OSN cell types [126]. Additional experiments will be required to clarify the role of
the "H region", the molecular basis for stochastic properties of OR selection, and the importance, if any, of epigenetics in the monogenic and monoallelic expression of
receptors in the olfactory and vomeronasal systems.

Conclusion
The olfactory system meets niche- and species-specific
demands by an accelerated evolution of its odorant receptor repertoires. As a result of a dynamic gene birth and
death process, odorant receptor families vary significantly
in size and quality between animals. In mammals, OR
and V1R genes are co-regulated such that each sensory
neuron expresses only ~one of the large repertoire of these
genes. Singular receptor expression permits sensory neurons to be specialized to the odorant binding qualities of
the single receptor expressed in each cell. This specialization of sensory neurons underlies olfactory coding, or the
ability of the olfactory system to interpret and make sense
of a complex odorant environment. The rapid evolution
of odorant receptor genes, the sheer size of the repertoire,
as well as their wide distribution in the genome, makes
this co-regulatory task particularly daunting: what are the
mechanisms of odorant receptor regulation that allow
only one gene to be transcribed, while keeping the
remaining large number of OR genes silenced? It appears
that both deterministic and stochastic regulatory processes contribute to the expression patterns of odorant
receptors. We have reviewed several models that have
been proposed to account for mutually exclusive OR

expression, as well as introduced a new hypothesis that
invokes important epigenetic properties of the system.
The discovery of a "trans activator", the "H region", is an
eagerly awaited breakthrough. Future studies will elucidate how OR regulatory mechanisms accommodate a
dynamic evolutionary history of gene birth and death, the
importance of genome context and epigenetics, and how
the "H region" and "feedback inhibition" collaborate in
this fascinating problem of gene regulation.
