Abstract
Background: Previous loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) genetic linkage maps have been based on a variety of DNA
polymorphisms, such as AFLPs, RAPDs, RFLPs, and ESTPs, but only a few SSRs (simple sequence repeats), also
known as simple tandem repeats or microsatellites, have been mapped in P. taeda. The objective of this study was
to integrate a large set of SSR markers from a variety of sources and published cDNA markers into a composite
P. taeda genetic map constructed from two reference mapping pedigrees. A dense genetic map that incorporates
SSR loci will benefit complete pine genome sequencing, pine population genetics studies, and pine breeding
programs. Careful marker annotation using a variety of references further enhances the utility of the integrated
SSR map.
Results: The updated P. taeda genetic map, with an estimated genome coverage of 1,515 cM(Kosambi) across 12
linkage groups, incorporated 170 new SSR markers and 290 previously reported SSR, RFLP, and ESTP markers. The
average marker interval was 3.1 cM. Of 233 mapped SSR loci, 84 were from cDNA-derived sequences (EST-SSRs)
and 149 were from non-transcribed genomic sequences (genomic-SSRs). Of all 311 mapped cDNA-derived markers,
77% were associated with NCBI Pta UniGene clusters, 67% with RefSeq proteins, and 62% with functional Gene
Ontology (GO) terms. Duplicate (i.e., redundant accessory) and paralogous markers were tentatively identified by
evaluating marker sequences by their UniGene cluster IDs, clone IDs, and relative map positions. The average gene
diversity, He, among polymorphic SSR loci, including those that were not mapped, was 0.43 for 94 EST-SSRs and
0.72 for 83 genomic-SSRs. The genetic map can be viewed and queried at http://www.conifergdb.org/pinemap.
Conclusions: Many polymorphic and genetically mapped SSR markers are now available for use in P. taeda
population genetics, studies of adaptive traits, and various germplasm management applications. Annotating
mapped genes with UniGene clusters and GO terms allowed assessment of redundant and paralogous EST markers
and further improved the quality and utility of the genetic map for P. taeda.

Background
Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) is an economically important native forest tree species in the southern United
States, accounting for approximately 16% of the harvested industrial wood in the US and 5% worldwide
[1,2]. Over 40% of this production occurs on 12 million
hectares of sustainably managed forests, where essentially all of the planting stock is the product of genetic
improvement [1,3]. In addition to its economic significance, P. taeda is ecologically important, as it is a

frequent or predominant species on about 25 million
hectares of non-planted forested land in the southern
US [1]. Pinus taeda also is considered one of the major
bioenergy feedstocks [4] and recently was selected as the
first pine species for complete genome sequencing with
the intent of using genome information to enhance its
bioenergy potential [5]. Genetic maps, when integrated
with physical maps, have played an important role in
genome assembly for other plant species [6,7] and, when
annotated for gene function, are important for mapping
cellular regulatory and signalling networks [8].
Prior P. taeda genetic maps were based on multiple
types and combinations of marker systems: RFLPs [9],
AFLPs [10], RFLPs and RAPDs [11,12], ESTPs [13],

ESTPs, RFLPs, and RAPDs [14], SSRs [15], and RFLPs,
ESTPs and SNPs [16]. The RFLP, ESTP, and SNP markers in these maps were derived from cDNA sequence,
although a few of the RFLP markers also were derived
from genomic sequence. All mapping of RFLP and
ESTP markers was conducted in one or both P. taeda
reference mapping pedigrees, base and qtl. Of all the
maps, only the AFLP map of 508 loci [10] and the
RFLP-ESTP-SNP map of 373 loci [16] consolidated into
12 linkage groups (LGs) that correspond to the 12 chromosomes of P. taeda [17].
Comparative mapping with P. taeda using ESTP markers has been conducted with other pines, such as Pinus
elliottii Englm. [14], Pinus pinaster Ait. [18], Pinus sylvestris L. [19], and with other conifers, such as Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. [20] and Picea species [21,22].
Pinus taeda maps were essential in comparative mapping studies that helped to understand chromosomal
evolution and identify syntenic regions in Pinaceae
(reviewed in [23,24]). Putative single-copy genes in conserved ortholog sets (COS) have been identified in
P. taeda and Picea glauca (white spruce) [25,26] and
segregating markers were developed [26]. As these prior
reports point out, the development and mapping of
COS markers is expected to be an additional mapping
resource that would be particularly useful for more
extensive comparative maps and detailed studies of syntenic and phylogenetic relationships between P. taeda
and other Pinus and Picea species.
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were integral
components of the genetic maps used in prior plant
genome projects [6,7] and are expected to be so for the
pine genome project. Over 300 SSR markers for
P. taeda previously were developed from EST sequences
[27,28] and genomic DNA sequences [29-31]. While a
dedicated SSR mapping study placed 51 genomic-SSR
markers into 15 linkage groups [15], only a few SSR loci
from any source were integrated into the more complete
cDNA-based maps [16,19,32].
Here we describe SSR marker development, mapping,
and annotation in P. taeda. From SSR-enriched pine
genomic DNA libraries and from pine EST databases,
we obtained sequences for SSR discovery and primer
design. The resulting EST-SSR and genomic-SSR markers were evaluated for specificity and quality of amplification. Those segregating in one or both P.taeda
mapping pedigrees, base and qtl, were used for genome
mapping. We combined new SSR marker segregation
data with prior ESTP and RFLP marker segregation data
to construct a new integrated genetic map of P. taeda.
We assigned UniGene and GO (gene ontology) annotations to all classes of cDNA markers (e.g., EST-SSRs,
ESTPs and RFLP). We did so because transcript mapping with UniGene clusters and GO terms can be used

to facilitate gene discovery and help integrate positional
and functional information for most genes [33], and
thus aid future pine genome project efforts. We used
the annotations to help identify redundant markers and
potentially paralogous loci on the map. The result is the
first functionally annotated, SSR-based, genetic map for
a conifer. Map and annotation data were loaded into a
new database with an enhanced graphic interface, PineMap [34], that was developed to contribute to the goals
of the Pine Genome Initiative [35] and provide public
access to the map, marker, and associated sequence
information on ConiferGDB [36].

Results and discussion
Evaluating SSR sequences, primer pairs, and
polymorphism

Using 197,931 pine EST sequences that were available
July 2004 and represented in 52,911 assembled contigs
and singletons, we found 1,485 (2.8%) that contained at
least one SSR as defined by our selection criteria (see
Methods - SSR selection and primer design). From SSRenriched genomic DNA libraries, we selected and
sequenced 887 SSR-positive clones from P. taeda
libraries and 619 from P. radiata libraries. Marker
amplification in P. taeda was evaluated for 830 EST-SSR
primer pairs, 566 P. taeda genomic-SSR primer pairs,
and 107 P. radiata genomic-SSR primer pairs. In addition, we evaluated 43 previously reported EST-SSRs [27]
and 131 previously reported genomic-SSRs [29-31].
Determination of PCR amplification quality and marker polymorphism used different screening and evaluation strategies in different laboratories as each set of
primer pairs became available. The final round of evaluation reported here, however, included all previously
selected primer pairs, and used one PCR protocol to
produce dye-labelled amplicons for allele detection. Following this evaluation, we submitted to NCBI’s UniSTS
database 165 EST-SSR markers and 203 genomic-SSR
markers, as listed in Additional file 1. Detailed marker
data for 517 SSR, ESTP and RFLP loci are in Additional
file 2.
We genotyped 14 P. taeda individuals originating
from across the natural geographic range of the species
to obtain allele diversity heterozygosity estimates for 185
SSR loci (Additional file 3). This set included eight
monomorphic EST-SSR loci that may prove useful for
inter-species investigations if subsequent surveys find
them to be polymorphic among species. We estimated
mean unbiased gene diversity (He) as 0.57 for the 177
SSR loci that were polymorphic, 46 of which did not
segregate in either mapping pedigree. When examined
by SSR class, Heestimates for 94 polymorphic EST-SSRs
and 83 polymorphic genomic-SSRs were 0.43 and
0.72, respectively (difference of H e means = 0.29, 95%

CI = 0.08 - 0.49, t = 8.16, d.f. = 175, P < 0.0000). This
demonstrated that P. taeda SSRs contained within
expressed genes have lower genetic diversity than those
contained in anonymous genomic regions presumed to
be selectively neutral. Prior studies that used many
fewer P. taeda SSR markers to examine polymorphism
in P. radiata or P. contorta did not observe this notable
difference in gene diversity between transcribed and presumably non-transcribed SSR loci [27,28]. The general
constraint on polymorphism that we observed most
likely results from background selection or positive
selection acting on the associated genes. The observed
disparity in the level of polymorphism between the two
classes of SSR markers is a clear signature of selection
acting on expressed genes as a group [37]. SSRs markers
linked with genes of known function and harbouring
unusually low levels of polymorphism could thus help
to identify candidate genes for adaptively important phenotypes. When considering the general level of polymorphism among all 177 SSR markers, we believe there
is sufficient allelic diversity to allow selection of particularly informative sets of markers for use in detailed
population genetic studies or tree improvement
programs.
Genetic map

From each pedigree, base and qtl, we found one progeny
sample that had over 40% missing genotype data (Additional file 4, Tables S1 - S4). We excluded these two
samples from linkage analyses, leaving 97 base samples
and 170 qtl samples for map construction. Numbers of
segregating and mapped loci, categorized by pedigree
and marker type, are listed in Table 1. Segregation data
for 590 marker loci (Additional file 4, Tables S1 - S4)
were evaluated for linkage mapping based on criteria
described under Methods - Linkage analysis and mapping. SSR markers NZPR0300, NZPR0440, and
PtSIFG_0715 cosegregated on linkage group 5 (LG-5),
as did PtRIP_0621 and PtRIP_0165 on LG-10. Because

the JOINMAP program automatically retained only one
marker from each set for subsequent map construction,
we manually reinserted those loci in the final maps after
confirming that the marker sequences in each set were
not homologous. In total, 154 markers were in common
between the two pedigrees to permit map integration,
with genomic-SSR markers comprising the largest class
(Table 1). Summaries, by pedigree, of the reasons for
excluding individual markers from integration mapping
are in Additional file 4, Tables S5 and S6.
Based upon the third round (round-3) of JOINMAP mapping calculations for integrated mapping, which included
ancillary markers, we retained 460 non-redundant loci in
12 linkage groups that extended 1,416 cM, which provided
an average marker interval of 3.1 cM. SSR loci comprised
50% of mapped loci. Approximately equal numbers of SSR
primer pairs were evaluated for each marker type (Table
1), however, 53% fewer of the evaluated EST-SSR primer
pairs produced mapped markers than did the genomicSSR primer pairs (18% conversion to mapped loci for
genomic-SSR primer pairs vs. 9.6% for EST-SSR primer
pairs). We attributed this lower value to the lower genetic
diversity observed for transcribed SSR loci, as discussed
above.
Results from the second round (round-2) of JOINMAP
mapping calculations, which exclude poorer fitting ancillary markers, are depicted in Figure 1 with details in Additional file 5. The round-2 map spanned 1,429 cM with 429
loci in 12 linkage groups, providing an average genomic
marker interval of 3.3 cM (or 3.6 cM if averaged from
individual linkage groups). The numbers of mapped loci in
each integrated map, categorized by pedigree and marker
type, are in Table 1. Using the more conservatively constructed round-2 map data, we estimated genome length
as 1,515 cM using the (m + 1)/(m - 1) method. Our
round-2 map of 429 loci therefore covers 94% of the estimated genome length and provides a 99.6% probability
that any locus in the genome lies within 10 cM of one of
the mapped markers (as determined from c, defined in

Figure 1 A genetic map of Pinus taeda. The round-2 map of 429 marker loci constructed from the base and qtl pedigrees. The scales to the left
are in cM units, marker names in bold font denote genomic-SSR loci, bold underline denotes EST-SSR loci, and plain font denotes ESTP and RFLP
loci. A “GO” tag to the right of a locus denotes assignment of a functional Gene Ontology term. Supporting data are in Additional files 2, 5, 8.

Methods - Linkage analysis and mapping). The observed
distribution of markers among 10 cM genomic intervals
was not different from the expected random distribution
(K-S test D = 0.25, P = 0.786). Interactive graphical displays
of these maps, and comparisons between them, can be

viewed and queried from the PineMap database (Figure 2)
[34]. The round-3 map is represented in PineMap as
the map set named Pinus_Taeda_Base_&_QTL_SSR_
Version_1, while the round-2 map is in map set Pinus_
Taeda_Base_&_QTL_SSR_Version_2.

Figure 2 PineMap user interface. A web page screen capture of the CMap graphic display for LG-5 of the Map Set
Pinus_Taeda_Base_&_QTL_SSR_Version_1 in PineMap [34]. Markers are colour-coded according to marker type. Each marker is hyperlinked to its
mapping, annotation, and DNA sequence data. Map, annotation, and sequence data for all markers, and for map metadata, can be downloaded
from links available through the Map Sets tab found on the top menu bar.

The prior integrated map of P. taeda from the base and qtl
pedigrees contains 302 ESTP, RFLP, and isozyme markers
in 12 linkage groups that span 1,274 cM [20], while a
recent qtl pedigree map of 373 ESTP, RAPD, RFLP, SNP,
SSR, and isozyme markers spans 1,228 cM [16]. A

previous base pedigree map of 51 SSR markers spans 795
cM across 15 linkage groups [15]. Our two-pedigree integrated round-2 map of 429 markers incorporated 227 of
the RFLP and ESTP markers and 30 of the SSR markers
used in those prior studies. We observed that inclusion of

Echt et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/17

mapped loci that had been assigned functional GO
terms, that is, those with a GO term other than the stub
assignment of “molecular_function”. GO terms and UniGene IDs assigned to mapped markers can be queried
as “free text” searches in PineMap [34].
PineMap users also can follow links from a marker in a
PineMap or CMap display to its assigned UniGene cluster and associated ConiferGDB EST clusters and contigs
[38]. ConiferGDB P. taeda EST clusters take advantage
of NCBI P. taeda UniGene clusters (Build #11). Each
NCBI UniGene cluster is intended to include mRNA
sequences transcribed from a unique locus in the genome. Because of the particular clustering algorithm
adopted by NCBI, however, it is possible that a UniGene
cluster contains transcripts from paralogous loci. Conversely, transcript isoforms (alternative splice variants)
derived from the same gene could possibly be grouped
into different UniGene clusters. ConiferGDB adopts a
unique approach to EST clustering by implementing the
following protocol: (1) retrieve EST component lists of
all UniGene clusters from NCBI, (2) use cleaned EST
sequences annotated with cDNA termini, which delimit
transcript ends, and (3) conduct EST clustering (ConiferEST clusters) for every individual UniGene cluster

level-3 GO category

203 previously unmapped SSR markers extended the
mapped P. taeda genome by about 150 cM. In particular,
SSR loci extended one end of LG-7 by 52 cM and one end
LG-12 by 42 cM compared to the prior two-pedigree integrated map of 302 markers [20]. Comparisons of the current and prior integrated maps are shown in Additional
file 6. No RFLP or ESTP loci were included in these
extended intervals, except for the terminal marker on LG7, estPtIFG_0149_a. This marker is not present in prior
maps, presumably because it had not been linked to other
RFLP and ESTP markers [16,17].
Our round-2 map depicted in Figure 1 had overall
colinearity with the prior two-pedigree integrated map
(Additional file 6). Deviations in the order of loci generally occurred only among closely linked loci. A notable
exception was at the end of LG-6, in which three markers in a ~28 cM interval on our map shifted positions
relative to three other markers and mapped within a ~8
cM interval on the prior map (Additional file 6). We
could not trace the cause of the discrepancy to the mapping process and attributed it to the addition of three
SSR markers (PtTX_3055, PtRIP_0609, PtRIP_0619) and
the exclusion of an ESTP marker (estPtIFG_8972_a)
that altered linkage estimates in the region. Similar
types of deviations from colinearity also occur between
prior P. taeda maps [16,20], as shown in Additional file
7. We suggest that these types of deviations are not specific to our SSR markers or mapping protocols and may
be a function of unresolved genotyping errors.
Obtaining consistent linkages and orders of loci were
problematic for the distal half of LG-10 in our initial mapping sessions. We resolved the discrepancies by first mapping only the SSR markers in LG-10 using the round-2
JOINMAP map calculations, then adding ESTP and RFLP
markers one by one, retaining only those that passed our
exclusion criteria (see Methods - Linkage analysis and
mapping). Difficulties in ordering RFLP and ESTP markers
in this linkage group also arose in prior mapping studies
[16,20], as is evident by the flipped orientation of six markers in the distal half of LG-10 (Additional file 7).

Marker curation

Each of the 369 cDNA-derived marker sequences was
curated, i.e., manually annotated, for a P. taeda UniGene
cluster, reference protein, and GO term (Additional
file 8). We assigned UniGene clusters to 240 of the 311
(77%) mapped cDNA loci and assigned RefSeq proteins
to 208 (67%). Based on these assignments GO terms of
a known function, process, or cell compartment were
assigned to 193 loci (62%). Comparison of the relative
proportions of the hierarchical level-3 GO categories for
these mapped genes revealed that the categories “catalytic activity” and “binding” together included 46% of all
GO term assignments (Figure 3). We flagged in Figure 1

found among mapped cDNA marker loci in P. taeda. GO terms for
similar functions, processes or cell compartments were grouped by
standardizing them to level-3 of the GO lineage hierarchy, where
level-1 is ‘all’ and level-2 comprises the three ontologies:
‘molecular_function’ (F), ‘biological_process’ (P) and
‘cellular_compartment’ (C). Assigned GO terms and the parental GO
lineages (levels-3, -4 and -5) for individual markers are in Additional
file 8.

using CAP3 to create contig consensus sequences
[38,39]. Consequently, one UniGene cluster could contain zero (i.e., no suitable EST sequence are found), one,
or multiple ConiferEST clusters and contigs. The result
is that for functionally annotated cDNA loci displayed
on PineMap, users can quickly obtain information on a
marker’s UniGene cluster, its ConiferEST cluster, and
the consensus sequence of that cluster.
Redundant markers and paralogous loci

We identified 28 mapped marker pairs that appeared to
be derived from the same locus (as defined in Methods Linkage analysis and mapping) and therefore would have
provided redundant mapping information (Table 2). We
excluded these markers from the final map integration
session, although provide their segregation data to permit
independent analysis (Additional file 4, Tables S3 and S4).
We found it interesting that the duplicate marker
PtTX3118, a SSR marker derived from low-copy, highCoT, genomic DNA [40], appeared to be derived from
the same gene as PtSIFG_1325, which was an EST-SSR
marker derived from a root cDNA library, and which
mapped to LG-2. The two clone sequences are nearly
identical (99% identity over 188 bp, E-value = 2 × 10-94),
differing only in the microsatellite region, and putatively
code for a Ras-like GTP-binding protein (Additional
file 8). Even though a number of the PtTX markers
were developed with the intent of targeting gene regions
[40], this match was the only instance that we found of
a genomic-SSR marker for a transcribed gene.
We identified 21 sets of tentative paralogs that
included 58 markers (Table 3). We assigned markers as
paralogs if they shared a UniGene ID (or derived from
the same DNA clone) and mapped greater than 3 cM
apart. In fact, only two markers, found in paralog set
#14 of Table 3, approached this distance limit:
PtIFG_2574_c and PtIFG_2574_2 were separated by
8 cM near the end of LG-5. The next most closely separated markers assigned as paralogs, PtIFG_1636_3 and
PtIFG_1636_54 in paralog set #11, spanned a distance
of 13 cM on LG-3. All paralog sets contained markers
that mapped to two or more LGs. While most of the
paralog sets contained RFLP markers derived from the
same clone, which share the clone ID in the marker
name, some of the paralogous associations were not so
easily identifiable. For example, the following five markers mapped to different LGs, but all were assigned to
paralog set #16 and share the same UniGene cluster ID
(Pta.598) and GO term (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase activity): PsyGPD (LG-5), PtIFG_1165_a
(LG-2), PtIFG_2068_A (LG-3), PtIFG_2538_5 (LG-8),
estPtIFG_1950_a (LG-6). This further exemplifies the
utility of annotating P. taeda genetic maps with UniGene and GO assignments to explore the genetic

Page 7 of 16

structure of complex gene families that are a characteristic of pine genomes [41].
The threshold map distance of 3 cM and other criteria
that we used to distinguish redundant markers for a single locus from independent markers for paralogous loci
were conservatively chosen to minimize redundant
genetic information on our maps. We cannot exclude
the possibility, however, that we wrongly categorized
some markers as derived from the same gene sequence
that were in fact derived from closely linked paralogous
genes. Given the available P. taeda marker segregation
data, we expect that higher density and higher resolution genetic maps, or nearly complete physical maps,
will be required to make definitive statements about the
fine scale organization of paralogous loci in P. taeda.

Conclusions
We developed 170 SSR markers and mapped 233 in
P. taeda, many more SSR markers than has been
reported for any other conifer species. The integration of
these markers with previously mapped ESTP and RFLP
markers significantly extended the coverage of two
P. taeda LGs, LG-7 and LG-12. With the map and marker information that we are providing here, there are
now sufficient numbers of different classes of informative
SSR markers for immediate use in a variety of areas:
P. taeda population genetics, evolutionary analysis of
candidate adaptive trait genes, and germplasm management applications that require unambiguous identification of parental and clonal genotypes. Through
annotation of mapped genes with UniGene cluster IDs
and GO terms, we initiated an assessment of redundant
and paralogous EST markers, further improving the quality and utility of this and future P. taeda genetic maps.
The only two P. taeda reference mapping pedigree
populations currently available in the public domain (base
and qtl) are limited to 75 and 85 clonally archived full-sib
progeny, respectively. The limited mapping resolution provided by this resource is insufficient to provide an extensive genetic mapping scaffold that could assist with
physical assembly of the anticipated P. taeda genome
sequence. For this purpose, a public domain high-resolution genetic mapping resource will be required. Nonetheless, the current map can provide immediate genome
ordering of assembled sequence scaffolds by establishing
homology between the sequence tagged markers reported
here and their corresponding scaffold sequence.

enrichment protocol of Ostrander et al. [42] as
described by Echt et al. [43]. SSR motifs targeted for
enrichment were: AC, AAC, AAG, AAT, ACC, ACG,
AGG, ATC, AAAC, AAAT and AGAT. Protocols for
DNA sequencing, PCR primer design and amplification,
and preliminary evaluations of primer pairs were similar
to those previously described [43].
Pinus taeda EST sequences and contigs were acquired
in July 2004 from the University of Georgia Laboratory
of Genomics and Bioinformatics [44]. Additional
P. taeda ESTs were acquired at the same time from
GenBank dbEST. Pinus pinaster ESTs were obtained
from the INRA, Bordeaux, Laboratory of Forest Genetics
and Tree Improvement [45]. From all sources, 197,931
ESTs with 52,911 assembled contigs were used.
Sequences were analyzed with the Gramene SSRIT PERL
script SSR.pl [46] to find SSRs that met the following SSR
length criteria (bp length); dinucleotides (12), trinucleotides

(15), tetranucleotides (16), pentanucleotides (20) and hexanucleotides (24). Only perfect, that is, uninterrupted, SSRs
were counted. Thus compound repeats, such as (TC)8(TA)
6, were counted as two repeats, as were imperfect repeats,
such as (TA)21G(AT)6. Parallel analyses were run with the
web application BatchPrimer3 [47]. Both analyses gave the
same SSR tallies when identical input parameters were
used. From the SSR.pl reports, we did not count redundant
entries for SSRs that were listed under multiple motif
classes. For example, the dinucleotide (AT)nalso would be
reported by SSR.pl as a tetranucleotide of (ATAT)n and as
a hexanucleotide of (ATATAT) n , but we counted all
instances as a single dinucleotide SSR. Nomenclature for
SSR motifs followed the convention of the alphabetically
minimum form [48,49]. For example, all SSRs of the type
(AAT)n, (ATA)n, (TAA)n and their reverse complements
(ATT)n, (TAT)n, and (TTA)nwere classified as an (AAT)
nmotif, or equivalently as AAT.

Map position in LG from round-3 JOINMAP integrated mapping calculations.

Primer pairs to identified SSRs were designed from nonredundant sequences using the STS_Pipeline 1.3 package,
which is the STS_Pipeline1.2 package [50] that we modified by porting to the Redhat Linux 9.0 operating system
and upgrading the primer design engine to Primer3. Similar SSR primer analysis functions are available on-line with
BatchPrimer3 [47]. Input parameters used for primer
design included minimum primer size = 18 nt, maximum
primer size = 24 nt, optimal size = 20 nt, minimum GC
content = 20%, maximum GC content = 80%, minimum
Tm = 56° C, maximum Tm = 64° C, optimal Tm = 60° C,
3’ end complementarities = 3 nt, any complementarities =
8 nt, minimum amplicon size = 100 bp, and maximum
amplicon size = 500 bp.
For each sequence, three primer pairs having the three
best PRIMER_PAIR_QUALITY tag values were reported.
The STS_Pipeline reports were screened with custom
PERL scripts to select the one primer pair per sequence
that flanked the intended SSR target and had an optimal
balance of primer quality score and amplicon size. For
example, when considering dinucleotide motif SSRs, the
primer pair with the best quality score was selected if it
had an amplicon size from 100 bp to 299 bp, though if it
did not, then the pair with the shortest amplicon greater
than 299 bp was selected. Similar selection criteria were
applied to the longer SSR motifs, except that the preference was for the primer pair with the best quality score
and with an amplicon size greater than 299 bp. If those
two criteria were not met, then the pair that produced
the longest amplicon size less than 299 bp was selected.
We used this size distributed selection strategy to
increase the number of potential marker loci that could
be grouped in multiplexed genotyping assays.

The resulting PCR primer pairs were evaluated for amplicon
marker quality with DNA samples obtained from 14 unrelated P. taeda cloned individuals originating from across
the natural geographic range, including the four parents of
our two reference mapping pedigrees. The geographic provenance of each population sample is listed in Additional
file 3. We selected markers for subsequent linkage mapping

Echt et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/17

and population genetic analysis if they consistently amplified
what appeared to be single loci in the expected amplicon
size ranges. Gene diversity and related allele frequency statistics for the population samples were obtained using the software package GENALEX [51].
We detected and scored SSR alleles by sizing PCR
amplicons with capillary electrophoresis. All PCR forward primer oligonucleotides were tailed on their 5’ end
with the M13forward(-29) sequence CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC. All reverse primer oligonucleotides were
tailed on their 5’ end with GTTTCTT, forcing a nontemplated dA addition to the amplicons [52]. Fluorescent dye (6-FAM, VIC, NED or PET) was incorporated
in amplicons by including a 5’ dye-labelled M13 forward
(-29) primer in the PCR [53]. PCR composition in a 6 μl
reaction volume was as follows: 10 ng pine DNA template, 40 nM forward primer, 160 nM reverse primer,
160 nM dye-labelled primer, 66 μM dNTPs, buffer (1.5
mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton
X-100, pH 9.0) and approximately 1 Unit Taq polymerase mixed with anti-Taq polymerase antibody. Equivalent results were obtained by substituting a suitable hotstart Taq polymerase and omitting the antibody. We
used a hot-start PCR thermocycling protocol: 2 min at
94 °C; followed by 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at
x °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, where x = 65 °C - 0.5 °C
per cycle; followed by 15 cycles of 30 s at 92 °C, 30 s at
55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; followed by 15 min at 72 °C.
Completed PCR reactions were refrigerated until analyzed. PCR amplicons and ABI PRISM GS 600 LIZ
internal size standards (Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) were separated by capillary electrophoresis using ABI PRISM 3100 or 3130xl Genetic Analyzers (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Markers were multiplexed four to a capillary
channel, one of each different dye label, such that marker allele size ranges did not overlap. We used this conservative multiplex strategy to avoid allele detection
complications that can arise when occasional instances
of excessive concentrations of a marker yield spectral
overlap ("bleed-through”) with similarly size markers of
different dye labels. Allele sizing by the third order
least-squares algorithm and allele size binning were performed with ABI PRISM GENEMAPPER 3.7 software
(Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
followed by manual inspection and editing of the automated allele assignments as needed. A second person
independently verified all allele assignments. We standardized SSR marker allele bins among capillary electrophoresis runs with the aid of control genotype samples
from the P. taeda clones 7-56 and B-145-L Control genotypes for all SSR markers are listed in Additional file 4,
Table S7.

Non-SSR marker segregation data for base and qtl
pedigrees were provided by G. Brown [12,11]. We converted non-SSR marker data from a numerical genotype
code format to an ABCDMN format prior to analysis.
The PERL script genojoin.pl http://www.esd.ornl.gov/
PGG/scripts.htm was used to properly format the converted genotype data to a format suitable for linkage
analysis JOINMAP (see Linkage analysis and mapping
section below). SSR genotypes in exported GENEMAPPER tables were analyzed for coding errors and converted to an ABCDMN format by the PERL script
genomapper.pl http://www.esd.ornl.gov/PGG/scripts.
htm. The corrected and reformatted SSR genotype
tables subsequently were converted to a JOINMAP format using the genojoin.pl script.
Marker nomenclature

SSR markers developed in the course of this study were
given the prefix “PtSIFG” if they were derived from
P. taeda ESTs, “PpSIFG” if from P. pinaster ESTs,
“PtRIP” if from P. taeda genomic libraries, and “NZPR” if
from P. radiata genomic libraries. RFLP and ESTP markers were named as previously published [20,54], as were
existing microsatellite markers of the SsrPt and PtTX series [27,26]. Known aliases are listed in Additional file 2.
Mapping populations

Mapping populations were from two unrelated P. taeda
outbred pedigrees constructed by the Weyerhaeuser
Company, referred to as base and qtl [11]. For the base
pedigree (cross: 20-1010 × 11-1060, described in [9]), we
mapped markers that had been genotyped in two sets of
full-sib progeny: one set of 95 progeny that prior studies
used for mapping RFLP and ESTP markers [9,14] and
one set of 75 progeny that we used to genotype SSR markers. There were 72 progeny in common between these
sets, providing 98 base progeny samples for mapping all
markers. We genotyped six PtTX SSR markers in both
progeny sets and used the consolidated segregation data
for verifying sample identities between the sets and for
mapping. For the qtl pedigree (cross: 6-1031 × 8-1070),
we mapped markers that had been genotyped in four sets
of full-sib progeny: the full set of 172 progeny and a subset of 48 progeny that prior studies used for mapping
RFLP markers [11,55], a subset of 95 that prior studies
used for mapping ESTP markers [13,14], and a subset of
85 progeny that we used to genotype SSR markers. We
genotyped eleven PtTX and eight NZPR SSR markers in
the latter two progeny sets and used the consolidated
segregation data for verifying sample identities between
the sets and for mapping. From scion material that we
obtained from Weyerhaeuser Company, we established a
clone archive of the base (n = 75) and qtl (n = 85)

Echt et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/17

progeny sets used for SSR genotyping, which we named
Base2 and Qtl2, respectively. Needle or DNA samples
from these trees can be obtained from author CDN.
By comparing the multi-locus SSR genotypes of each
sample that was in common between the overlapping
progeny sets of each pedigree, we found and subsequently resolved progeny sample code discrepancies
between the archival data and our newly generated data.
For each mapping pedigree we then merged the correctly aligned genotype segregation matrices from the
various progeny sets into an interleaved matrix that we
used for subsequent linkage analyses and mapping
(Additional file 4, Tables S1 - S4).
Linkage analysis and mapping

We performed linkage analyses and consensus map integration using JOINMAP 3.0 [56,57]. We established the
12 linkage groups (LGs) reported in published P. taeda
maps by inspecting LOD grouping of markers constructed at 0.5 LOD intervals from LOD 3 to LOD 7.
The maximum recombination parameter for establishing
linkage was set to 0.5, which imposed no restrictions on
the LOD groupings. LG number identifiers were
assigned based on previously reported marker locations
on individual P. taeda linkage groups [14]. The JOINMAP mating type parameter CP (cross-pollination) was
used for the allogamous outcrosses of both mapping
pedigrees. Mapping parameters were set for a “jump”
threshold of 5, a ripple value of 1, and the Kosambi
mapping function. JOINMAP uses a reiterative process
through three rounds of mapping calculations. During
the first two rounds, JOINMAP excludes markers that
exceed the assigned jump threshold (the normalized difference in the goodness-of-fit values for a marker
ordered in a stepwise process), while during the third
round they are placed into their most likely positions in
the LG regardless of the jump threshold [57]. We
retained markers placed on the round-3 maps for subsequent mapping sessions, except as noted below for the
final integrated mapping session from which we report
results for the round-2 and round-3 integrated maps.
We first constructed maps separately for the base and
qtl pedigrees to assess the quality of the segregation
data for individual markers and identify unsuitable or
redundant markers. We excluded loci if they segregated
null alleles, if they had excessive segregation distortion
(P < 0.005 for c2tests), if they altered locus orders, or if
they appeared to be a redundant marker for a locus. We
did not employ a Bonferroni adjustment of P for tests of
segregation distortion because we empirically determined that markers within the adopted limit of P could
be mapped with confidence if they had not been
excluded by other criteria. We assigned two markers as
redundant if they mapped within 3 cM of each other

Page 11 of 16

and either derived from the same cDNA clone, had the
same UniGene ID, or had at least a 99% BLASTn
sequence identity over more than 185 bp. The latter criterion was applied only in instances where one marker
of the pair was derived from a pine EST sequence other
than P. taeda or from a non-EST (genomic) sequence.
The 3 cM distance limit was determined empirically
from distances that we observed between non-cosegregating map positions of markers known to be for the
same locus. This included SSR markers independently
genotyped with the same primers in different labs or different mapping progeny subsets and RFLP and ESTP
markers derived from the same gene. Adoption of this
limit was supported by a report that ESTP, RFLP, SNP,
and isozyme markers for the same single copy cad
(cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) gene mapped within
2.4 cM of one another in P. taeda [16]. Further, simulations show that a 3% genotype error rate can nearly
double the map distance between loci separated by
2 cM and obscure their correct map order [58]. We
therefore assumed that there may be some degree of
undetected genotyping errors for marker loci that otherwise would be expected to cosegregate and we assigned
such loci a redundant status if we found evidence that
they covered the same gene and mapped less than 3 cM
apart. The one marker of a redundant pair that we
excluded was the one with the poorer goodness-of-fit,
that is, the one with the larger c 2 contribution to the
ordered group. We repeated mapping sessions to assess
marker suitability until all unsuitable markers were
excluded.
We did not exclude markers based on missing data
except for extreme instances of markers with >70%
missing data, which we found only in the qtl pedigree
segregation data. Markers with lower percentages of
missing data did not warrant a priori exclusion because
they were rejected by our other exclusion criteria during
the reiterative mapping sessions. We were aware of
potential negative effects on map order and distances
that can arise from missing data [58], however, we used
the efficiency of the mapping process to include markers
that could be placed accurately and exclude those that
could not. The rationale of this approach was to map
SSR markers in the context of prior cDNA-based P.
taeda maps by incorporating the same ESTP and RFLP
marker segregation data used to construct those maps
[14,16,20]. Because sets of data were consolidated from
different mapping population cohorts, described above
in the Mapping population section, the analysed matrix
of segregating genotypes contained blocks of missing
genotypes (i.e., ranging from 1% to 40% for RFLP
markers and 45% to 67% for ESTP markers in the
172-sample qtl mapping population). We therefore replicated in our mapping analyses the same levels of

Echt et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/17

missing data for ESTP and RFLP loci that prior studies
[14,16,20] used to construct P. taeda maps.
Markers retained from the individual pedigree mapping
sessions were used for integrating the pedigree maps by
applying the JOINMAP function ‘Combine Groups for
Map Integration’ to individual linkage groups. We used
an initial session of map integration to identify and subsequently exclude markers that caused inconsistency in
the order of groups of loci, expanded the LG length by
more than 5 cM, or appeared to be a redundant marker
for a locus. Retained markers were used in a final session
of map integration. Markers added during the round-3
JOINMAP map calculations are considered ancillary
markers. Details of round-3 mapping data are listed in
Additional file 2 and used for reporting summary map
statistics, while round-2 map data are listed in Additional
File 5 and depicted in Figure 1. We charted linkage maps
using the MAPCHART v2.1 program [59].
We obtained an estimated genome length by summing
adjusted map lengths for the 12 linkage groups according to method 4 of Chakravarti et al. [60]. In that
method the length of each linkage group is adjusted by
multiplying the observed cM length by the factor (m +
1)/(m - 1), where m is the number of markers in the
linkage group. We used this method because, when evaluating larger numbers of markers and segregating progeny, it performs better than an alternative maximum
likelihood method based on pair-wise recombination
values or a method-of-moments estimator based on
pair-wise LOD scores [60]. Genome coverage was estimated as the proportion of marker coverage c, given
that at least one marker is located within a specified
mapping interval d (that is, adjacent markers should be
at most 2d apart) in a genome of length L with m
mapped markers, such that c = 1 - e -2dm/L [10,61].
These estimates for genome length and genome coverage assume a random distribution of mapped markers;
therefore, we tested for random marker distribution in
the integrated map. We parsed the concatenated map
into 10 cM intervals and counted the number of intervals that contained an x number of markers, for x from
zero to 11. To compare these results to a random distribution, we used a Poisson distribution function, P(x) =
μxe-μ/x!, where P(x) was the probability of x number of
markers per interval and μ was the average number of
markers per interval in the integrated map. We obtained
the distribution of expected number of intervals containing x markers by multiplying P(x) by the total number of 10 cM intervals on the integrated map for each
corresponding value of x, from zero to 11. We then
used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for two populations to determine whether the distribution of
observed counts was likely the same as the distribution
of expected random counts [62].

Marker curation

We searched NCBI’s UniGene database [63] for each
marker’s GenBank accession number and when a match
was found we assigned the Pta (P. taeda) UniGene cluster ID to the marker (Additional file 8). If a marker’s
sequence was from a conifer species other than
P. taeda, or was a P. taeda transcribed sequence not
found in a Pta UniGene cluster, then we used it as the
query in a BLASTn search to find in GenBank a homologous P. taeda EST target. We conducted searches
with the NCBI BLAST engine http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi and selected target sequences that had the
highest sequence identity alignment above 85% and
spanned at least 220 nucleotides of the query sequence.
If a selected target sequence was also a member of a Pta
UniGene cluster, then that cluster ID was assigned to
the marker. In the few cases of ESTP markers that had
no available cDNA or EST sequence, we used the marker’s primer pair sequences in a BLASTn search of GenBank’s P. taeda ESTs. If both primers aligned exactly
and in the expected orientation, then the accession
number of the target EST was assigned to the marker
and UniGene cluster assignment proceeded as described.
Summary statistics of BLASTn alignments for individual
markers are in the Notes column of Additional file 8.
We assigned RefSeq proteins [64] to markers as the
main means to obtain GO term annotations. Using the
RefSeq protein information provided by NCBI for each
P. taeda (Pta) UniGene cluster, we assigned to the marker the RefSeq that had the highest reported amino acid
identity and a functional GO term annotation (Additional file 8). Generally, Arabidopsis thaliana or Oryza
sativa RefSeq proteins were selected. If no RefSeq proteins were listed for a UniGene cluster, but a functionally annotated Pinus mRNA (complete or partial cds)
was in the cluster, then that mRNA’s GenBank protein
was assigned as the reference protein (8 cases). If we
could not assign a UniGene cluster to a marker, then
we based reference protein assignment on the results of
a BLASTx search of the RefSeq protein database with
the marker’s EST sequence (16 cases). All reference protein assignments were contingent on a greater than 45%
amino acid sequence identity that spanned more than
45% of the marker’s translated amino acid sequence
length, as reported by the NCBI BLAST search engine
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. Details of assignments based on these later conditions are in the Notes
column of Additional file 8.
For most markers, we assigned GO terms [65] based
on the assigned RefSeq protein’s GO annotation available either from NCBI records or from The Arabidopsis
Information Resource http://www.arabidopsis.org/. If a
marker’s assigned reference protein was a Pinus GenBank protein (that is, not a RefSeq protein), then we

Echt et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:17
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/17

Page 13 of 16

adopted the GO term of the most homologous and
descriptively annotated RefSeq protein that was listed
for the marker’s UniGene cluster (5 cases). If no RefSeq
was listed, then we assigned a marker’s GO term de
novo from the AmiGO database [66] by searching on
the functional annotation of the marker’s assigned Pinus
reference protein (3 cases). We assigned to a marker the
“molecular_function” GO term as a stub if its reference
protein had an unknown function or if it had neither a
reference protein nor a UniGene ID assignment.
GO terms were obtained from the GO database version
of October 2009. We assigned only one GO term for each
gene marker. Our intent was to follow a conservative
assignment of known biochemical function based on
amino acid sequence homology or direct experimental
demonstration. With this approach, we avoided inferring
from taxonomically distant species any specific biological
role of a gene that was not corroborated by direct metabolic, developmental, or cytological studies in pine. Given
that intent, our preference of GO assignments was for the
molecular_function ontology. If a molecular_function
term was not available for a marker’s assigned RefSeq protein, then the RefSeq protein’s available biological_process
ontology term was used (9 cases), or we used the RefSeq
protein’s cellular_compartment ontology term (1 case).

Benjamin Figueroa kindly provided GO terms standardized through common lineages of parent GO terms to
specific hierarchical levels through use of a custom PERL
script running on the Dendrome TreeGenes database [67].
The standardized terms for each assignment are in Additional file 8, and are summarized in Figure 3.
PineMap implementation on ConiferGDB

PineMap [34] was developed as an online tool to display
the genetic map and marker database created by this project. In its current implementation, PineMap is based on
customization and function extension of CMap, an opensource and PERL-based computational tool for displaying
both genetic and physical maps [68]. Twenty-two categories of marker information, taken from Additional files
2 and 8, were inserted into the database. We modified
CMap to suit the specific requirements of this project,
such as including marker annotations. Using CMap as a
core base system, we developed a wrapper system around
it using AJAX technology based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PERL, that allowed us to design and implement custom pages, such as free-text searches and
advanced searches. A separate web interface was created
for administrative functions. This administrative page
enables approved users with a username and password to

Authors’ contributions
CSE conceived and coordinated the study, analyzed the data, annotated the
markers and drafted the manuscript with contributions from all co-authors
on subsequent drafts. SS mined SSR sequences from pine EST databases,
wrote PERL scripts used in primer selection, and evaluated SSR primer pairs
developed from Pinus pinaster ESTs. KVK compiled the RFLP and ESTP
sequence and primer data. KW implemented PineMap at ConiferGDB and
participated in designing the database and web interfaces. JEE constructed
and selected SSR-enriched genomic libraries for Pinus taeda. CL designed,
initiated, and managed the development of the PineMap database system.
CDN co-conceived some of the individual SSR development projects and
established the mapping population cohorts at SIFG. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
