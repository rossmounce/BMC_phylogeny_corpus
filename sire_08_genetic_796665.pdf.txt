Abstract
Background: PTGS (post-transcriptional gene silencing) is used to counter pathogenic invasions,
particularly viruses. In return, many plant viruses produce proteins which suppress silencing
directed against their RNA. The diversity of silencing suppression at the species level in natural
hosts is unknown.
Results: We investigated the functional diversity of silencing suppression among isolates of the
African RYMV (Rice yellow mottle virus) in rice. The RYMV-P1 protein is responsible for cell-to-cell
movement and is a silencing suppressor. Transgenic gus-silencing rice lines were used to investigate
intra-specific and serogroup silencing suppression diversity at two different levels: that of the virion
and the P1 silencing suppressor protein. Our data provide evidence that silencing suppression is a
universal phenomenon for RYMV species. However, we found considerable diversity in their ability
to suppress silencing which was not linked to RYMV phylogeny, or pathogenicity. At the level of
the silencing suppressor P1 alone, we found similar results to those previously found at the virion
level. In addition, we showed that cell-to-cell movement of P1 was crucial for the efficiency of
silencing suppression. Mutagenesis of P1 demonstrated a strong link between some amino acids and
silencing suppression features with, one on the hand, the conserved amino acids C95 and C64
involved in cell-to-cell movement and the strength of suppression, respectively, and on the other
hand, the non conserved F88 was involved in the strength of silencing suppression.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that intra-species diversity of silencing suppression is highly
variable and by mutagenesis of P1 we established the first link between silencing suppression and
genetic diversity. These results are potentially important for understanding virus-host interactions.

Background
PTGS (post-transcriptional gene silencing) is conserved
among eukaryote kingdoms and is a gene-regulatory
mechanism involved in several control processes, includ-

ing development, maintenance of genome stability, and
defence against invasive pathogens. This molecular mechanism is initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, or RNA with secondary structures, and results in a

reduced steady-state level of cognate cytoplasmic mRNA
[1,2], in which small RNAs (21–24 nucleotides) play crucial roles. Among these small RNAs, two functionally different RNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) and small-interfering
RNAs (siRNA), have been characterized [3]. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRP) leads to production
of dsRNAs molecules that are recognized and cleaved
through the sclicer activity of RNAseIII (DICER-like protein). Thus small RNAs are loaded to RNA Induced silencing complex (RISC) and served as guides to cleave cognate
mRNAs. It has been well described that PTGS is a major
defence response against viruses [4]. Hence, viruses have
been described as activators, as well as, targets of this
mechanism [5-7]. To facilitate their replication and movement among host cells, plant viruses have acquired mechanisms to suppress gene silencing targeted at their RNA
[8,9]. Such proteins are usually involved in viral pathogenicity [9] and also in virus spread, in cell-to-cell as well
as in long-distance movement [10]. Many proteins that
prevent, or suppress, the silencing of viral RNA have now
been identified. These counter-defensive proteins can act
at different steps in the PTGS pathway, e.g., involving the
silencing signal itself or its subsequent propagation
[8,11]. There is considerable diversity in the sequences of
these suppressor proteins, as well as in their targets and
modes of action [12-14]. This suggests that viruses have
no general strategy for suppressing the silencing of their
RNA.
The Rice yellow mottle virus, belonging to the Sobemovirus
genus, is endemic to Africa and is the major pathogen of
irrigated rice [15,16]. Its genome and particle structure
have been described [17,18]. P1 is a 18–19 kDa protein
encoded by the first open reading frame (ORF) of RYMV
positive sense single-stranded RNA, which contains four
partially overlapping ORFs [19]. With up to 17.8% amino
acid sequence divergence, the genetic diversity of P1 protein is higher than for other viral proteins [19]. This protein is required for viral replication and cell-to-cell
movement [20]. It also acts as a non-autonomous-cell
silencing suppressor in Nicotiana benthamiana [9,21].
It is well known that viral suppressors differ considerably
in their structure and function [22]. However, at the virus
species level, functional diversity of these proteins is
unknown. In addition, nothing is known at the viral level
as to how they suppress the silencing of their RNA during
the infection of a natural host. We investigated both of
these aspects using RYMV and P1 protein as model systems, to study the functional diversity of silencing suppression from various virus isolates. In this paper, we
analysed silencing suppression of RYMV in its natural host
at the virion and P1 protein levels. Such an analysis was
possible since genetic diversity of the RYMV is well characterised [19,23,24] and its phylogeography could be

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/55

reconstructed in detail to highlight links between the geographical and ecological origins of virus isolates [19,25].
Using a transgenic rice line, containing a silenced β-glucoronidase (GUS) transgene (iudA), we investigated by
GUS activity reversion the functional diversity of PTGS
suppression upon virion inoculation or ectopic P1 gene
expression. We thus were able to demonstrate for the first
time the high diversity of silencing suppression at the
intra-species level, suggesting a complex mechanism in
silencing suppression at the virus scale. Using P1 mutants
we found that cell-to-cell movement and the efficiency of
silencing might be linked with variation in the efficiency
of silencing suppression.

Methods
Plant material
Transgenic O. sativa L. (O. s.) spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare containing the uidA (gusA) transgene from pCAMBIA 1301 (GenBank accession No. AF234297) and
carrying a single copy of T-DNA [26] (C. Sallaud, unpublished data) were used. Transgenic line L4 constitutively
expresses the uidA gene and the transgenic line L10 is gussilenced (Figure 1). L10 expressed a PTGS phenotype for
expression of the uidA gene on the basis of GUS staining
in leaves or roots. With gus-specific siRNA detection, we
correlated the L10-phenotype to PTGS and demonstrated
its stability over the lifetime of vegetative plants from germination (Figure 1). L10 was used as a model in our
silencing suppression studies during host-pathogen interactions. Plants were grown and maintained in controlled
conditions in a confined greenhouse (CGG consent for
GMO culture n° 3576) under 12 h light at 28°C, 12 h
dark at 24°C and at a relative humidity of 70%. As a con-

Virus isolates and inoculation
We used 10 fully sequenced RYMV isolates belonging to
different serogroups and representative of viral diversity in
Africa (i.e. with 9.9% maximum diversity) [19,23], these
were; BF1, CI63, CI4, Ni1, Ni2, Mg1, Tz3, Tz5, Tz8 and
Tz11. There was a second set of 10 isolates belonging to
serogroup 2, showing variable pathogenicity assessed
through symptom intensity, but low sequence diversity
(2%). These were; CI110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116,
121, 129, and 138 [27] (Figure 2). They were independently propagated in the susceptible cultivar O. sativa spp.
indica cv. IR64.

Two weeks after seeding, plants (2 leaves) were mechanically inoculated as described elsewhere [28] with diluted
sap (1/10 w/v). Each isolate was independently inoculated into 20 plants that were grown separately to limit
cross contamination. Viral inoculum were adjusted to a
standard concentration, as estimated by DAS-ELISA
assays, to prevent variation in silencing suppression due
to differences in initial virus delivery. In order to avoid
bias due to inoculation heterogeneity, leaf samples were
collected from each inoculated plant at 35 or 40 dpi and
separated into two independent samples before being
ground for proteins (fluorimetry, ELISA and western) and
RNA extractions.
Plasmid construction and biolistic delivery experiment
P1 sequences with UTR (from 1 to 709 nt) [17] from five
isolates representative of the diversity of P1 with a divergence up to 17.8% were selected. These isolates are representative of the diversity of the other parts of the genome
as phylogenetic reconstruction from the P1, the CP and
the full genome are congruent. They were cloned into the
CaMV 35S constitutive promoter and terminator, that
were named sTz3; sMg1; sCI63; sBF1; sTz8. PCR fragments of P1 sequences (underlined) were amplified with:
forward GAATTCAAGCTTGACAATTGAAGCTAGGAAAGGAGC, reverse GAATTCTCTAGACGCGGCC GCTATCAA,
and cloned into the XbaI/HindIII (in bold) restriction site
from the 35S cassette. These constructs were delivered
twice onto pieces of L10 leaves (collected 2 weeks after
seedling) by particle bombardment. For each P1 tested, 20
leaves were cut into 10 cm strips. In order to detect the
specific effect of P1 and to avoid potentially unfavourable
viral translation, we analysed leaves at 2 days post-delivery (dpd). Histological experiments were performed in
the presence of ferro- and ferri-cyanide, so as to ensure
wide range spread of coloration was not influenced by
stain spreading and only reflected presence of GUS activity.

Biolistic delivery
Five micrograms of sP1s were inoculated onto pieces of
leaves from the L10 gus-silenced line by biolistic delivery
(Biorad Biolistic PDS 1000/He) after 3 h incubation in
MES buffer containing 10% (w/v) sucrose. Leaves were
bombarded at a pressure of 1100 psi and a flight distance
of 6 cm with tungsten-coated particles. Each construct was
delivered to 20 leaf pieces that were bulked for analysis at
the end of the experiment. Leaves were then placed at
26°C for 2 days in 16 h light, 8 h dark at a relative humidity of 60%, on 1.5% phytagel and 0.5 w/v MES containing
3% (w/v) sucrose.

RNA and protein analyses
Total RNA was extracted from rice leaves with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen™) according to the manufacturers'
instructions. Analysis of low molecular weight RNA was
performed on 15 μg total RNA as described previously
[29]. Analysis of mRNA was performed with NorthernMax®-Gly (Ambion®) as recommended by the manufacturer. Radio-labelling of the probe and hybridization was
performed as done in ref. [30]. A 808 bp PCR amplified
fragment (808 to 1616 bp) of GusA was used for the specific probe preparation. Radio-labelled signals were
detected either by autoradiography or by scanning with
Typhoon (Amersham). RNA band intensities were quantified using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics).

Soluble proteins were extracted from rice leaves in a
sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaHPO4, 10 mM
Na2EDTA, 1 mg.ml-1 N-Laurylsarcosine, 0.1% v/v Triton
×100) by two successive centrifugations of 20000 g at
4°C. The Bradford colorimetric method (Coomassie protein assay kit, Pierce) [31] was used for protein quantification. Twenty micrograms of protein were resolved by SDSPAGE and transferred by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot® Transfer Medium, Biorad). A
diluted rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the P1
protein (1/500) was used and revealed by a second (1/
40000), horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (Pierce)
through Supersignal® West-Pico chemiluminescence substrate. Blots were exposed to CL-XPosure™ film (Pierce).
DAS ELISA assays
The virus concentration was evaluated by DAS-ELISA as
described previously [32]. DAS-ELISA was performed with
diluted (1/1000 v/v) polyclonal antiserum against an isolate from Madagascar (RYMV-Mg). Positive reactions were
detected after incubation with alkaline phophatase-conjugated polyclonal antibody to RYMV and substrate, with
absorbance read using a Multiskan fluorimeter (Labsystem).
GUS assays
Histochemical staining for GUS activity and GUS assays
were performed according to Jefferson [33] and involved
pieces of leaves randomly collected from two to five plants
at 1 and 2 dpi (inoculated leaves), and 7, 14, 35 and 40
dpi (systemically infected leaves).

As described previously [34], proteins were incubated
with 1 mM of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide
(MUG, Sigma®). Fluorescence was measured at 15 min
intervals for 2 h with a Fluoroskan fluorimeter (Labsystem), with a 365 nm excitation filter and a 455 nm emission filter. Calibration was performed with quantification
of fluorescence of soluble 4-methylumbelliferone (MU,
Sigma®).

Results
Silencing suppression diversity at the RYMV species level
We investigated the diversity of RYMV efficiency in silencing suppression and used a transgenic gus-silenced rice
line (L10). As seen in Figure 1, silencing of the gus transgene, leads to an absence of GUS activity, and is accompanied with a strong accumulation of gus specific siRNA.
This accumulation is maintained during the life-cycle of
rice plants (Figure 1). Moreover, infection with the RYMV
virus leads to a restoration of GUS activity concomitant
with a decrease of gus-siRNA accumulation. Assuming
that silencing suppression activity of RYMV involves restoration of the GUS phenotype and a decrease of steadystate levels of gus-siRNA, we quantified silencing suppression efficiency by evaluating the decrease in steady state
levels of siRNA. We separately inoculated 10 RYMV isolates that differed in their coat protein (CP) (Figure 2).
From 1 dpi, we revealed GUS reversion for all isolates by
observing the blue histochemical staining patterns in both
L10-infected leaves and positive controls (i.e. transgenic
L4 lines that constitutively expresses the uidA transgene)
whereas in non-inoculated (NI) and mock-inoculated
(BI) L10 leaves, GUS activity was undetectable (Figure 3A)
indicating that the reversion of GUS activity in L10-inoculated plants was only due to RYMV and not to mechanical stress caused by the inoculation.

Because histochemical staining of GUS is not a quantitative method the reversion of uidA gene expression in L10
was assayed by fluorimetric quantification of GUS activity, in systemically infected leaves. We found that RYMV
isolates differed in their efficiency to reverse the constitutive silencing, as illustrated by the heterogeneity of
restored GUS activity (Figure 3B). In each serogroup (Figure 3B), we detected a contrasting pattern of reactivation
for the uidA transgene. In S1, the isolates CI4, Ni1 and
Ni2 exhibited distinct effects on silencing suppression
(Figure 3B, lanes 3–5). Similarly, the S4 Mg1 isolate
weakly suppressed silencing, whereas a strong effect was
obtained for the Tz8 isolate (Figure 3B, lanes 8, 10).
Finally, strong suppression leading to higher GUS activity
was detected for the Tz3 and Tz11 isolates belonging to
the S5 serogroup (Figure 3B, lanes 11–12). This result
showed that the ability to suppress PTGS was not correlated with the viral phylogeny.
Moreover, we found that viral content was not correlated
with GUS activity, as illustrated by isolates belonging to
the same serotype Ni2 and CI4, or, CI63 and BF1 isolates
(Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 4 or 4 and 5). We also noted that
the diversity of silencing suppression displayed by these
RYMV isolates was not correlated with viral pathogenicity
(data not shown). Indeed, the most pathogenic isolate,
BF1, was not the strongest in suppressing PTGS.

Taken together, these results highlighted the prevalence of
silencing suppression within the species and showed that
gus-silenced gene reversion was dependent on viral isolate.
Silencing suppression diversity at the RYMV serogroup
level
As plants infected with different RYMV isolates exhibited
variable GUS activity, we investigated the diversity of this
restoration at the serogroup level. Thus we considered isolates from the Ivory Coast belonging to the least variable
RYMV serogroup S2 (diversity around 2% based on CP
sequence) (Figure 2). Ten representative isolates of S2
were chosen for homogeneous biological characters
(same collection date and geographical localisation) and
were inoculated into L10 plants.

Silencing suppression showed by the restoration of GUS
activity was followed by histochemical staining of GUS at
1, 2, 7, 15, 17, 21, 27, 31, and 40 dpi. At 40 dpi, steadystate siRNA levels were monitored with Northern blots.
Gus-specific siRNA were not detected in systemically
infected leaves in contrast to NI or BI L10 leaves (Figure
4A). This revealed that uidA gene silencing had been
reverted by all S2 isolates tested. To analyze more closely
the qualitative effect of the different isolates, we compared

with standard deviations indicated. (C) Western blot analysis
of P1 protein.

GUS activity levels measured by fluorimetry (Figure 4B) to
viral amounts measured by ELISA (Table 1) in systematically infected leaves. An analysis of covariance revealed
that at 40 dpi a large part of the variability in silencing
suppression was due to an isolate effect, although part of
the reversion was due to an effect of virus content (Table
1). We thus revealed highly heterogeneous responses in
GUS activity reversion following viral infection (Figure
4B). Isolate CI110, is considered to be strong suppressor
of constitutive silencing in the iudA gene, (Figure 4B). The
weaker suppressors were isolates CI113 and 114, with less
than 20% maximal activity restoration (Figure 4B). Western blot analyses showed that the efficiency of silencing
suppression was not correlated with RYMV-P1 protein
suppressor accumulation in leaves (Figure 4C). As all isolates belong to the same serogroup, this quantitative variation of P1 accumulation should not be linked to
polyclonal antibody affinity. In addition, sequences analysis of P1 proteins found no obvious correlation between
the efficiency of silencing suppression and genetic diversity of the P1 protein (data not shown) suggesting that
silencing suppression when analyzed at the virion scale is
more complex than previously thought. As noted above,
the efficiency of silencing suppression is not correlated to
symptoms expressed by these isolates (data not shown).

Taken together our results at the virion scale demonstrate
that the accumulation and genetic diversity of the P1 suppressor protein were not correlated to heterogeneity in the
reversion of GUS activity that we observed.
Effect of ectopic P1 protein expression on silencing
suppression
As the effect of RYMV on uidA silencing suppression was
not linked to viral diversity, pathogenicity or P1 accumulation, we attempted to assess the particular effect of the
P1 protein identified as the RYMV silencing suppressor
protein [9]. Different P1s representative of the viral diversity were cloned under control of the CaMV 35S promoter. This was done in order to determine whether the
sequence diversity of this suppressor reflects functional
diversity and to accurately determine the qualitative effect
of the P1 protein on silencing suppression.

We demonstrated a lack of effect due to biolistic delivery
and the expression vector by using empty 35S (Figure 5A
and 5B lane 5). At 1 day post delivery (dpd), we revealed
the reversion of GUS activity, except for sTz8 for which
GUS activity was only observed at 2 dpd (Figure 5A). We

thus demonstrated for the first time in a natural host, that
all P1s from different RYMV isolates were silencing suppressors. In addition, we observed the reversion of GUS
activity over the entire leaf, even where the P1 protein had
not been delivered, suggesting strong movement of this
protein (Figure 5A).
To further examine whether P1 acts differently in relation
to variation in its sequence, we evaluated the steady-state
level of gus-specific siRNA by Northern blot. Every P1
induced a decrease in the steady-state level of gus-siRNA,

and 35S) (Figure 5B). Moreover, as shown in Figure 5B,
the different P1s exhibited contrasting activity in silencing
suppression, as revealed by the different siRNA patterns.
These results highlight the qualitative effect of different
P1s and that they could be grouped into two classes
according to their efficiency of suppression. Indeed, we
observed that GUS activity restoration with sCI63, sTz3
and Tz8 was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in
siRNA levels. Consequently, we concluded these proteins
are highly efficient in transgene-induced silencing suppression in rice. Conversely, in case of sBF1 and sMg1, we
observed a slight decrease in siRNA levels (Figure 5B), and
they were thus classified as weak silencing suppressors.
Furthermore, as previously demonstrated at the virion
scale, the efficiency of these silencing suppressors is not
correlated with viral phylogeny. Indeed, according to
RYMV evolutionary history [19], P1s from isolates belonging to the same phylogenetic group can be either strong
(sCI63) or weak silencing suppressors (sBF1) (Figure 2

and 5B). In addition, P1s from distant isolates were similar in their silencing suppression efficiencies, as illustrated
by the weak suppressors sBF1 and sMg1 (Figure 2 and 5B).

observed for sTz3 and sMg1. It therefore seems likely for
sCI63 that the faster movement of this P1 protein is associated with its high efficiency in silencing suppression.

Movement of P1 protein and silencing suppression
As we found a qualitative effect of the different P1s, and as
it has been demonstrated that silencing suppression and
cell-to cell movement of Potato potexvirus X (PVX) are
linked [35], we investigated the involvement of cell-to-cell
movement of P1 on the qualitative variation in silencing
suppression (Figure 6A). We carried out an experiment to
analyze P1 protein accumulation at the site of delivery
(del) and in distal (dis) areas of L10-inoculated leaves. To
do so, we co-bombarded 20 pieces of L10 leaves with
every sP1 construct described above and associated with a
35S-GFP plasmid. Under UV illumination at 2 dpd, we
were able to discriminate the delivery area from the distal
area by GFP fluorescence. We could detect green areas corresponding to the delivery zone (del) and red areas due to
chlorophyll fluorescence corresponding to the distal zone
(dis) (Figure 6A). To limit any contamination by P1 outside from the delivery zone, we enlarge the delivery zone
by an additional 1.5 cm which leads, in addition to a 6 cm
flight distance, to an incompatible zone to receive any
particles.

In contrast, for sMg1 we observed a different situation
with the accumulation of P1 in the dis area which was not
correlated with a decrease in gus-siRNA and the expression of gus-mRNA (Fig 6B and 6C, lanes 6–7). For sMg1,
although movement of P1 occurred its lack of effects on
gus-siRNA was likely caused by its weaker efficiency in
silencing suppression.

We compared the steady-state level of gus-siRNA and
mRNA, in the delivery and distal areas for each sP1 protein previously selected for a range of variation in their
efficiency of silencing suppression (Figure 6B). For the
sTz3 protein, accumulation of gus-siRNA and mRNA were
similar in del and dis areas (lanes 4–5). For the sCI63 protein, we observed a weak accumulation in the both areas
for gus-siRNA, and strong accumulation mainly in del
area for gus-mRNA (lanes 8–9). For the sMg1 protein, we
observed a contrasting situation between the del and dis
areas; lower accumulation of gus-si-RNA and accumulation of mRNA in the del area, and an absence of gusmRNA in the dis area (Figure 6B, lanes 6–7). Then, for the
same samples, we investigated the presence of P1 in the
del and dis areas by western blot. Similar P1 protein accumulation was revealed in del and dis zones for sTz3 and
sMg1 (Figure 6C, lanes 4–7), and only in the dis zone for
sCI63 (Figure 6C, lanes 8–9). Although we cannot rule
out the bombardment of P1 outside of GFP area, the
strong accumulation of P1 detected in distal areas seems
to favour the idea that of there being cell-to-cell movement from delivery to distal area of P1 proteins in rice
leaves. This would help clarify our previous observation of
GUS activity being detected across entire leaves (see Figure
5A, lanes 2 and 6 compared to 8 or 9). Furthermore, we
observed differences in P1 accumulation as shown for
sCI63 (only detected in the dis area, Figure 6C lanes 8–9),
where a weak accumulation of gus-siRNA was correlated
with gus-mRNA expression, as compared to levels

Functional amino acids in P1 proteins
As we demonstrated major differences in the silencing
suppression efficiencies of different P1 proteins (Tz8, BF1,
CI63, Mg1 and Tz3), we attempted to assign amino acid
diversity to functional effects with ClustalW alignments
[36] (Figure 7A).

First, we identified the putative eukaryotic Zn-finger motif
(C64(x)2C67(x)24C92(x)2C95) which is conserved across
the RYMV phylogeny (Figure 7A). This kind of motif has
been reported to be crucial for silencing suppression activity [37]. We introduced two independent single mutations
in the Tz3 Zn-finger with PCR amplification in cysteine 64
and 95 (Cystein changed by Serine, C64S et C95S). Secondly, when comparing sequences of the strongest silencing suppressor (sTz3) and the weaker silencing suppressor
(sMg1) we detected two amino acids specific to sTz3 (i.e.
N19 and F88) (Figure 7A). We used PCR amplification to
introduce two independent single mutations in the sTz3
sequence at asparagine 19 (Asparagine changed by Isoleucine, N19I) and phenylalanine 88 (Phenylalanine
changed by Tyrosine, F88Y). The efficacy of these mutants
to abolish silencing of the uidA transgene in L10 was
tested following biolistic delivery. The effects of these
mutations were compared with wild-type sTz3 and sMg1
silencing suppressor proteins.
At the histochemical and molecular levels (i.e. gus-specific
si- and mRNA detection), we demonstrated that none of
the four mutations completely abolished the suppression
effect of sTz3. Nevertheless, the single amino acid mutation C95S impaired the ability of P1 to suppress uidA
silencing in the distal part of leaves (high level of gussiRNA), suggesting that this mutation affects the cell-tocell movement of P1 (Figure 7B, lanes 12–13). Conversely, mutations F88Y or C64S both decreased silencing
efficiency, as shown by the steady-state level of gus-siRNA
in the del and dis zones being higher than observed with
sTz3 (Figure 7B, lanes 4–7). Finally, mutation N19I did
not affect the silencing suppression efficiency of the P1
protein relative to sTz3, as shown by similar pattern of
gus-siRNA and gus-mRNA (Figure 7B, lanes 8–9). Together
these results demonstrate that mutations highly influence

Discussion
Previous studies have shown the potential of viral proteins as silencing suppressors, but only outside of their
natural context [38]. For RYMV, the P1 protein was identified as a silencing suppressor in N. benthamiana, which is
not a natural host [9]. The novelty of our study was the
focus on the characterisation of silencing suppression

with RYMV virions and the role of the P1 protein when
infecting a natural host. We demonstrated the efficiency of
the RYMV-virion as a constitutive-silencing suppressor in
rice. We found for the first time that highly diverse RYMV
isolates are all able to suppress a constitutive gus-silenced
transgene, indicating that silencing suppression is a vital
feature for RYMV. Through the quantitative analysis of
GUS activity, we demonstrated that silencing suppression
was dependent on viral presence in systemically infected
leaves, but high silencing suppression is not strictly linked
with a high viral content. Furthermore, we have also
shown that the efficiency of GUS silencing reversion is isolate-dependent. Finally, we demonstrated that variation
in silencing suppression was not linked to viral phylogeny
and it occurred at the species and serogroup levels.

In order to explain the diversity observed at the virion
scale, we focused on the P1 protein previously identified
as a RYMV silencing suppressor [9]. Our results showed
that the strength of silencing suppression at the virion
scale was neither correlated with P1 protein accumulation, nor strictly correlated to P1 sequence variation. This
complex picture at the virion scale suggests that the activity of the silencing suppressor protein is probably highly
regulated during host-virus interactions. We cannot rule
out the presence of additional silencing suppressor proteins encoded by RYMV, as has been shown for the Citrus
tristeza virus [39], nor can we exclude the possibility of
additional mechanisms known to overcome PTGS. For
example, the Brome mosaic virus replicates its viral genome
in endoplasmic reticulum where dsRNA is not accessible
[40,41], and PVX has developed high-speed replication to
outrun the mobile silencing signal [41].

Our observations have shown that silencing suppression
efficacy and isolate pathogenicity were not correlated.
This could contradict the hypothesis that silencing suppressors determine pathogenicity [42]. Although the basic
hypothesis is that viral pathogenicity can be determined
by the influence of a viral suppressor on miRNA pathways
[43,44] it was recently demonstrated that not all silencing
suppressors affect miRNA [45]. During infection in a natural context, suppressors are likely to be highly regulated
so as to minimize their effect within the host. The silencing suppression effect of each RYMV isolate could thus be
adapted to balance the viral effect (i.e. pathogenicity) in
the host, while limiting viral-induced host gene silencing
in order to preserve the integrity of the plant machinery
during the infection process. RYMV also goes to different
cytoplasmic organelles that could secondarily increase its
pathogenicity [46]. This could mask the primary effect of
the silencing suppressor. Interestingly, it is also known
that some isolates can affect rice genotypes differently,
suggesting that the silencing suppression state, as well as
pathogenicity, could be genotype-dependent [27].
Our results, obtained with the P1 protein alone, showed a
similar tendency in silencing suppression as to those
obtained with virions suggesting a major role for the P1
silencing suppressor. As observed at the scale of the virion,
we observed a distinct functional variation of P1 proteins
based on the efficiency of silencing suppression, which
was not correlated with the viral phylogeny.
We correlated variation in silencing suppression and
sequence variation of protein P1 by molecular analyses,
with independent point mutations in the Zn-finger motif
or to selected amino acids identified by comparing
sequence data between Tz3 (strongest suppressor) and
Mg1 (lowest suppressor) P1 proteins. P1 mutants only
showed partial alteration of the silencing suppression
function. Cystein C95 has been shown to be essential for
the cell-to-cell movement of protein P1, and C64, F88
essential for the strength of silencing. This contrasts with
p19 from the Tomato bushy stunt virus, where a single mutation at G72 is sufficient to abolish the silencing suppression effect on PTGS [47]. These results indicate that
silencing suppression might involve several domains in
P1, as has been identified for P25 of PVX [35]. Based on
the multifunctionality of viral proteins, such mutations
could affect other roles involving movement or viral pathogenicity and which could be tested in rice with infectious
full-length clones [48]. Mutation C95 was previously
introduced in the full-length RYMV cDNA and it has been
demonstrated that this full-length was not infectious
(Bonneau and Brugidou, unpublished data). Here we
demonstrated that this mutation affects cell-to-cell movement of the protein P1, and consequently, silencing suppression activity failed in neighbouring cells. At this point,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/55

we cannot conclude if the absence of infectivity was due
to absence of viral genomic transport or silencing suppression. However, we demonstrated that P1 movement is
necessarily required for the spread of silencing suppression.

Conclusion
In its natural host we highlighted the functional diversity
of RYMV isolates on silencing suppression. The functional
diversity at the scale of virion is not correlated to genetic
diversity of the P1 protein suppressor. In addition, we
demonstrated that this functional diversity is not linked to
the virus phylogeny or its pathogenicity. Our overall
results suggest that the mechanism of silencing suppression due to the virus is more complex than previously
thought. By studying the P1 silencing suppressor alone we
demonstrated that the functional diversity of silencing
suppression occurs at the P1 protein level and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that cystein C95 is essential
for cell-to-cell movement of P1, and that C64 and F88 are
involved in the efficiency of silencing suppression. As
both cysteins (C95 and C64) are conserved in the RYMV
phylogeny, and as F88 is not, we could assume that this
last mutation could be one of the amino acid involved in
silencing suppression diversity of P1. This mutation opens
the way to identify other amino acids involved in the
functional diversity of silencing suppression.
