Abstract
Background: Pseudouridine (Ψ) is an abundant modified nucleoside in RNA and a number of
studies have shown that the presence of Ψ affects RNA structure and function. The positions of Ψ
in spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) have been determined for a number of species but
not for the snRNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a popular experimental model system
of development.
Results: As a prelude to determining the function of or requirement for this modification in
snRNAs, we have mapped the positions of Ψ in U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs from worms using
a specific primer extension method. As with other species, C. elegans U2 snRNA has the greatest
number of Ψ residues, with nine, located in the 5' half of the U2 snRNA. U5 snRNA has three Ψs,
in or near the loop of the large stem-loop that dominates the structure of this RNA. U6 and U1
snRNAs each have one Ψ, and two Ψ residues were found in U4 snRNA.
Conclusion: The total number of Ψs found in the snRNAs of C. elegans is significantly higher than
the minimal amount found in yeasts but it is lower than that seen in sequenced vertebrate snRNAs.
When the actual sites of modification on C. elegans snRNAs are compared with other sequenced
snRNAs most of the positions correspond to modifications found in other species. However, two
of the positions modified on C. elegans snRNAs are unique, one at position 28 on U2 snRNA and
one at position 62 on U4 snRNA. Both of these modifications are in regions of these snRNAs that
interact with U6 snRNA either in the spliceosome or in the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
particle (snRNP) and the presence of Ψ may be involved in strengthening the intermolecular
association of the snRNAs.

Background
Pseudouridine (Ψ) is an abundant modified nucleoside
found in RNA, at one time considered the fifth nucleoside
of RNA [1]. This modification has been found in many
types of RNA and is particularly abundant in small stable

RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and small nuclear RNA
(snRNA) [2,3]. Because of its structure, with the carbon at
the 5 position of the uracil ring attached to the sugar
rather than the nitrogen at the 1 position, Ψ is potentially
more versatile in its hydrogen bonding interactions [4].

The presence of Ψ appears to strengthen stems in RNA secondary structures and to stabilize base stacking in loops
[5-7]. The splicing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs)
in Xenopus oocytes is dependent on the presence of Ψ in
U2 snRNA [8,9]. This requirement for Ψ in U2 snRNA was
also seen in mammalian splicing extracts [10,11]. In addition, structural studies indicate that Ψ at a particular position in U2 snRNA is necessary to obtain the proper
conformation of the pre-mRNA:U2 snRNA interaction
during splicing [12-14]. The presence of Ψ at position 34
in human U2 snRNA enhances the formation of a splicing
intermediate found when an RNA oligonucleotide containing the lariat branch point of the pre-mRNA is incubated with in vitro transcribed U2 and U6 snRNA
segments [15].
The formation of Ψ is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases after transcription and a number of site-specific
synthases have been characterized from eukaryotes for the
modification of tRNAs [16-22]. It has been shown that the
pseudouridylation of several of the residues in metazoan
snRNAs require small nucleolar RNA cofactors (snoRNAs)
[23-25]. In yeast the formation of Ψ in U2 snRNA is
accomplished by a combination of site-specific Ψ synthases [22,26,27] and a synthase that is RNA cofactor
dependent [28].
The nucleotides that are modified to Ψ in the spliceosomal snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNA) have
been completely mapped for two species of yeast [26,29]
and rat [30]. In addition, the modifications in several of
the spliceosomal snRNAs have been sequenced for other
species such as fruit fly, frog, humans, and plants (for
review see [3]). The positions that are pseudouridylated
are, for the most part, conserved and nearly all of the Ψs
appear in the 5' half of the snRNAs [3,29,30]. The systematic mapping of the sites of pseudouridylation on these
essential splicing cofactors has not been attempted for one
of the most popular model systems currently used in biology, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). This is especially
surprising given the fact that cis-splicing in C. elegans
exhibits a number of differences from other species. For
example, there is a highly conserved 3' acceptor site and a
lack of an identified lariat branch point consensus
sequence within introns [31,32].
In this report we present the results of the mapping of the
sites of Ψ modification on the spliceosomal snRNAs of C.
elegans, the first step in a larger endeavor to determine the
factors required for the formation of Ψ in worms and the
function(s) of these modifications in an animal model of
development. All of the C. elegans spliceosomal snRNAs
contain Ψ, which distinguishes these results from those
seen with the snRNAs from two yeast species [26,29]. C.
elegans U2 snRNA is the most highly modified with a total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/20

of nine Ψs, all in the first 56 nucleotides of the snRNA. U5
snRNA has three Ψ residues in the highly conserved stemloop known to be essential for pre-mRNA splicing. C. elegans U4 snRNA has two Ψs, with one in a region of the
snRNA that participates in an RNA-RNA interaction with
U6 snRNA and allows for the formation of the U4/U6
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP). U1
and U6 snRNAs each have one Ψ identified. When the
sites of modification are compared with snRNAs
sequenced from other species, two of the positions modified on C. elegans snRNAs are unique, one at position 28
on U2 snRNA and one at position 62 on U4 snRNA. These
modifications are in regions of each snRNA that are predicted to interact with U6 snRNA to form the U4/U6
snRNP or in the spliceosome during the removal of
introns from pre-mRNA [33].

Results
A primer extension method [34,35] was used to identify
the positions of Ψ in the snRNAs. The method involves
chemically treating the total RNA from wild type worms
with 1-cyclohexyl-3(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodi-imide
metho-p-toluenesulphonate (CMCT) which covalently
reacts with uridines, and other nucleotides, whether modified or not. Two concentrations of CMCT were used in
the reactions and the reaction was allowed to proceed
such that only a portion of the available uridines is covalently modified. This partial reaction is important since it
is essential to be able to extend the primer past the first Ψ
encountered in order to identify additional Ψs. The isolated total RNA is then treated with mild base, and as a
consequence only the Ψ residues are left covalently modified. This covalent modification of Ψ creates a stop to
reverse transcriptase (RT) progression during the specific
primer extension phase of the assay. The products are electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide/8.3 M urea gel
along with sequencing lanes using the same end-labeled
primer. When bands appear in the CMCT+ lanes but not
in the CMCT- lanes and those bands are just prior to a uridine in the sequence, then there is a Ψ at that position.
Nearly all of the Ψ residues that have been mapped on any
snRNA of any species are found in the 5' half of the RNA
[3,30], the exceptions being one residue found near the 3'
end of U6 snRNA (rat, mouse, bean) and two residues that
are found at positions 131 and 132 on Drosophila U4
snRNA. Therefore this primer extension technique [34,35]
can be used to determine the modification state of all but
the very 3' 18 nucleotides of the snRNA. To map the positions of Ψ on C. elegans snRNAs, primers that hybridized
to the extreme 3' end of each snRNA were used initially.
Three additional primers were used to map sites of modification on U2 snRNA, and two additional primers were
used to map U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs. Only one

additional primer was used to map modifications on U1
snRNA.
U1 snRNA
With U1 snRNA, only one nucleotide, at the position
shown in Figure 1A, was found to be converted into Ψ.
This modification is at position 5 of the Thomas et al. [36]
C. elegans numbering system for U1 snRNA. With the
primer extension assay used in these experiments [34], the
reverse transcriptase (RT) stops just before the nucleotide
that is a Ψ, which is covalently modified by the CMCT. In
the case of C. elegans U1 snRNA, there is a band before the
U at position 5 and not position 6 (Fig. 1A) and therefore
position 5 is modified and position 6 is not. The reason
for the presence of the double band in the CMCT treated
lanes is not known but it has been seen in other substrates
by other investigators [37]. Other assays of U1 snRNA
using this same primer with a separately isolated total
RNA sample and electrophoresed on a different gel also
showed this double band. We have noted a double band
similar to this previously when Ψ was mapped on C. elegans tRNAAla (AGC) at a position where there was only
one uridine [21]. Two primers were used in the primer
extension reactions, with one hybridizing to the extreme
3' end of the U1 snRNA (U1RevA) and one closer to the 5'
end (U1RevB). The modification shown in Fig. 1A was
mapped with this latter primer and U1RevA yielded no
additional Ψ residues (data not shown).
U4 snRNA
U4 snRNAs from other species that have been sequenced
have from zero to five Ψs [3,29]. Two Ψs were identified
on C. elegans U4 snRNA mapped with the U4RevB primer
(Fig. 1B). They occur at positions 62 and 72, with stops to
RT appearing in the CMCT treated lanes of the gel. Pseudouridines have been found at positions 4, 72, and 79 in
all vertebrate U4 snRNAs sequenced, but no other U4
snRNA sequenced has a Ψ at position 62 [3]. The possible
modifications of the uridine at positions 79 and 80 of C.
elegans U4 snRNA, slightly obscured in a region of stops to
RT progression even in the CMCT- lane, are marked on the
figure. However, the use of additional primers in the assay
has not confirmed Ψs at these positions (data not shown).
With this specific primer extension method [34] there is a
possibility of misidentifying Ψs [38], so since this is a
region of considerable secondary structure, the conservative interpretation of the data was that there are no Ψs at
these sites. No modification of uridines near the 5' end of
C. elegans U4 snRNA, such as at position 4 (Fig. 1B), was
observed with this or another primer (U4RevC), that is
closer to the 5' end of the U4 snRNA (data not shown).
U2 snRNA
As with other U2 snRNAs that have been mapped for
modifications [3], C. elegans U2 snRNA has the largest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/20

number of Ψs in the spliceosomal snRNAs. In a previous
report of the characterization of Pseudouridine synthase 1
in C. elegans (CePus1p; [21]), we mapped at least five Ψ
residues in C. elegans U2 snRNA at positions 39, 45, 46,
48, and 56 (C. elegans U2 snRNA numbering) using a
primer (U2RevC) close to the middle of the snRNA [21].
When another primer (U2RevB) was used instead, two
additional modifications, at positions 41 and 43 were
seen (Fig. 2A), but the modification at position 48 was not
detected. When the assay was repeated using the U2RevC
primer used in the earlier report, the modification at position 48 was not detected (data not shown). In Fig. 2, and
the other figures, the arrowheads on the left of the panels
denote positions just before a U residue where bands
occur in both CMCT+ lanes but are missing or greatly
diminished in the CMCT- lane. Additional modifications
were mapped to positions 10, 16, and 28 (Fig. 2B) of U2
snRNA when a primer closer to the 5' end of the RNA
(U2RevD) was used. Three new primers were used to map
the Ψ residues on U2 snRNAs in this report and the primer
hybridizing to the extreme 3' end of the RNA (U2RevA)
did not add any additional pseudouridylated positions to
the ones identified with the U2RevB-D primers. This
brings the total number of Ψ residues in C. elegans U2
snRNA to nine. Surprisingly, no Ψ was detected in C. elegans U2 snRNA at the position equivalent to 34 in vertebrates (Fig. 2A, stick arrow on right side of panel; position
36 in C. elegans U2 snRNA), even though a Ψ is found at
this position in all other U2 snRNAs where the modifications have been determined [3]. This same result was seen
with two different primers, there is no increase in band
intensity in the CMCT treated lanes, which would indicate
a stop to RT and therefore a Ψ (data not shown, see
Discussion).
U5 snRNA
In many of the U5 snRNAs that have been sequenced
there are several Ψ residues in the region of the terminal
loop of the large stem-loop (see Fig. 4) [3]. Even yeast (S.
pombe) has two modifications in this region [29], a portion of U5 snRNA that has been shown to be critical for
the function of this splicing factor [39,40]. In the U5
snRNAs where Ψs have been found, there is a Ψ at position 43 and most have an additional one at position 46
(see Fig. 4, vertebrate U5 snRNA numbering). C. elegans
has three Ψ residues in this loop region and the result with
the U5RevB primer is shown in Fig. 3A. There are two Ψs
at positions 45 and 48 in C. elegans U5 snRNA numbering,
which correspond to positions 43 and 46 in vertebrates.
The third Ψ, shown at position 36 in Fig. 3A, is in the stem
at a position that it shares with several other species,
including the pea, but not with vertebrates or with either
S. pombe or S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4).

Figure 1
Location of Ψ in C. elegans U1 and U4 snRNAs
Location of Ψ in C. elegans U1 and U4 snRNAs. Total RNA was treated with either 0, 0.041, or 0.167 M CMCT and subsequently treated with mild base (see Materials and Methods). These samples were used as templates in primer extension reactions using 32P-end-labeled primers and electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A portion of the autoradiograph is
shown in panel (A) and is the result using primer U1RevB. The same primer was also used to generate the sequencing lanes,
using C. elegans U1 pGEMT plasmid as the template, on the right of the panel. The lanes are labeled to correspond to the RNA
sequence. In (B) the U4RevB primer was used to determine the positions of Ψ in U4 snRNA using treated RNA samples and a
U4 pGEMT plasmid for the generation of the sequence. In this and the subsequent two figures, the arrow to the right of the
sequence indicates the position of the Ψ and the arrowhead to the left of the panel indicates a stop to reverse transcriptase
that is increased in the CMCT treated lanes. The reverse transcriptase stops just before the modified nucleotide.

U6 snRNA
One Ψ was mapped on U6 snRNA from C. elegans at position 26 (Fig. 3B), which is equivalent to position 31 in the
vertebrate U6 snRNA numbering system. This position is
modified in mammals but not in either yeast U6 snRNA
mapped [26,29]. A second primer (U6RevC, data not
shown) was used to confirm the lack of modification at
position 35, which corresponds to a Ψ in mammalian U6
snRNA (position 40). Based on the sequences of other U6
snRNAs [3] there is a possibility that there might be

another Ψ residue close to the 3' end of the C. elegans U6
snRNA (at position 81). Since even the most 3' primer we
used in these assays would hybridize to this position, we
were not able to determine if worm U6 snRNA has this
modification using this technique.
CePus1p knockout
In yeast, Pus1p modifies one position on U2 snRNA [26],
but when total RNA from CePus1p knockout worms
(VC110, see Experimental section) was used as template

Locations of Ψs in C. elegans U2 snRNA
Figure 2
Locations of Ψs in C. elegans U2 snRNA. The methods are the same as described in Fig. 1, but the primers used were specific
for U2 snRNA and the template for the sequencing reaction was the C. elegans U2 pGEMT clone. In panel A the primer used
was U2RevB and is closer to the 3' end of the U2 snRNA than the primer used in panel B, U2RevD. The stick arrow on the
right of Panel A shows the position of U36, which is discussed in the text.

for the primer extensions with U1RevB, U5RevC, and
U6RevC primers there was no difference in the Ψ modification pattern seen with wild type (N2) and VC110 RNA
(data not shown). This result was also seen with U2
snRNA from VC110 worms, and was reported previously
[21].

Discussion
In all the snRNAs that have been sequenced and the modifications determined, U2 snRNA has by far the most Ψs.
C. elegans U2 snRNA has nine, less than the number seen
with vertebrates and flowering plants but greater than the
number seen with either S. pombe or S. cerevisiae [3]. The
overall modification pattern seen with C. elegans U2
snRNA is unique, and there is one position that is modified to Ψ that is not found in the U2 snRNAs from other
species (position 28). The other eight modifications were
found at sites that have previously been identified as sites

of pseudouridylation in U2 snRNA and two (positions 41
and 43 in rat U2 snRNA) have been found in all U2
snRNAs mapped [3]. These modifications have been
implicated in the function of the pre-mRNA splicing
cofactor [8-11]. It was shown by an in vitro reconstitution
system for pre-mRNA splicing that the modified U2
snRNA reconstituted splicing but U2 snRNA without Ψs
did not [10,11]. In addition, modifications at the 5' end
of U2 snRNA were shown to be necessary for the cofactor's
activity in the reconstitution of pre-mRNA splicing in
Xenopus oocytes [8]. Using this same system, Zhao and Yu
[9] have recently shown that the presence of Ψ in the
region of U2 snRNA (nts. 34–46) that interacts with the
pre-mRNA lariat branch point is required for function of
the cofactor and for the formation of the active 17S U2
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP).

Locations of Ψs in C. elegans U5 and U6 snRNAs
Figure 3
Locations of Ψs in C. elegans U5 and U6 snRNAs. The methods are the same as described in Fig. 1, but the primers used were
specific for U5 or U6 snRNAs and the template for the sequencing reaction was the C. elegans U5 pGEMT or U6 pGEMT
clones. Panel A shows the results with the U5RevB primer. Panel B shows the results of using a primer (U6RevB) that was
specific for U6 snRNA and the template for the sequencing reaction was the C. elegans U6 pGEMT clone.

The 'branch point interacting region' of U2 snRNA is
highly pseudouridylated, with six modifications in vertebrates and V. faba, five in S. pombe and 3 in S. cerevisiae [3].
All of these species have U2 snRNAs that have Ψ at positions 34, 41, and 43. C. elegans also has five Ψs in this
region, and although there are Ψs at positions equivalent
to 41 and 43, we were unable to detect a modification at
the position equivalent to 34 (C. elegans position 36). The
sequence of this region is highly conserved [30], and so
even though there is a uridine at position 36 in the U2
snRNA from C. elegans, it does not appear to be converted
to Ψ. This is a surprising result given the importance
attached to the presence of Ψ at this position. It is the
nucleotide that is predicted to be directly across from the

bulged adenosine in the helix formed by U2 snRNA and
pre-mRNA in mammalian and yeast splicing mechanisms
[33]. Newby and Greenbaum have shown that the presence of Ψ at this position stabilizes the bulged adenosine
conformation in oligomers, which is predicted to be favorable for splicing [12-14]. In addition, Valadkhan and
Manley have shown that in vitro, a Ψ at position 34 in U2
snRNA enhances the formation of a putative splicing
intermediate between U2 and U6 snRNAs [15]. It has
been shown recently that when the loss of Pseudouridine
synthase 7 (Pus7p), responsible for Ψ35 in S. cerevisiae U2
snRNA (the Ψ34 equivalent), is coupled with the mutation of position 40 in U2 snRNA (a U to G substitution or
the deletion of the U), a synthetic growth defect is seen.

requirement for a Ψ at position 36 in C. elegans U2
snRNA. In C. elegans U2 snRNP may be more closely associated with the 3' splice site since it has been found that
the U2 associated factor (U2AF) is associated with this
region of the intron rather than the lariat branch point
[32].
Although C. elegans U2 snRNA does not appear to have a
Ψ at position 36 it does have a Ψ at position 28, a modification that occurs in no other sequenced U2 snRNA [3].
This position is significant since it is in a region of C. elegans U2 snRNA that is predicted to interact with U6
snRNA in the active spliceosome (see Fig. 5A; [33,42]).
The addition of an A-Ψ base pair would add stability to
the inter-RNA stem and may favor the adoption of a particular conformation in the U6 or U2 snRNA that would
promote catalytic function [5,6,33,43]. It is possible that
this modification is critical due to the lack of an extensive
lariat branch point interaction between U2 snRNA and
the pre-mRNA in C. elegans [32].
Figure 4
U5 snRNAs
Phylogenetic comparison of the locations of Ψs in sequenced
Phylogenetic comparison of the locations of Ψs in sequenced
U5 snRNAs. Only the terminal portion of the large stemloop is shown in the figure. The numbering system and primary sequence corresponds to human U5 snRNA and the
positions of the modifications for the other species shown
are for the homologous position in the human sequence [3].
At positions 29, 30, 32, 51, 52, and 53 the other nucleotides
found at those positions in any of the species are indicated in
a smaller font, the rest of the sequence is conserved.

Neither the loss of Pus7p nor either mutation at position
40, showed a phenotype alone. This suggests there is a
requirement for the Ψ at position 35 under certain conditions [41].
How is it that worms can do without Ψ at this position? It
is possible our assays were incapable of detecting Ψ at this
particular position in C. elegans U2 snRNA with the primers that we have used. But we think this is unlikely since
we identify Ψs on either side of position 36. It is a formal
possibility that CMCT does not react with this particular
Ψ in worm U2 snRNA and therefore would not result in a
stop to RT, but we believe this is also unlikely. Instead an
answer might be found in the differences in consensus
sequences seen with C. elegans introns. There is no identified lariat branch point consensus sequence in C. elegans
introns and the consensus sequence at the 3' acceptor site
is extended and highly conserved [31,32]. Since there is
no branch point consensus in worms, there may be no

Of the spliceosomal snRNAs, the modifications on U5
snRNA have been determined from the largest number of
species [3]. One position (43, in human U5 snRNA numbering) is converted to Ψ in all of the U5 snRNAs where Ψ
has been found (Fig. 4). In addition, many U5 snRNAs, C.
elegans U5 snRNA included, also have a Ψ at position 46
(Fig. 4). The nucleotide sequence in the loop is highly
conserved and is critical for the function of U5 snRNA in
the splicing of pre-mRNA [30,39,40]. However, the position of Ψ in the stem is not highly conserved, except for a
tendency to be located near the ends of the stem (Fig. 4).
In tRNAs, Ψs located at the ends of stems are thought to
stabilize base-pairing and therefore strengthen the stem
[4]. This could be the reason the actual position is not
conserved, only the presence of the Ψ in the stem. Interestingly, S. cerevisiae U5 snRNA does not have a Ψ in the
stem, only at position 43 in the loop. This yeast has a U5
snRNA that can be folded into a different structure from
the other U5 snRNAs [3]. It has an additional stem loop
that could have a stabilizing effect on the stem-loop
shown in Fig. 4, thereby abrogating the need for the presence of Ψ in the stem in U5 snRNA of S. cerevisiae.
C. elegans U1 snRNA has two uridines at positions 5 and
6, in this region of U1 snRNA that is essential for the function of the splicing factor, but only the uridine at position
5 is converted to Ψ. Many species, including vertebrates,
Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae, also have two uridines at
these positions but both are converted to Ψ. However,
algae and S. pombe U1 snRNAs have two uridines, and Ψ
appears only at the position nearest the 5' end of the RNA
[3].

The locations of Ψs in the predicted intermolecular interactions between C. elegans U6 snRNA and U2 and U4 snRNAs
The locations of Ψs in the predicted intermolecular interactions between C. elegans U6 snRNA and U2 and U4 snRNAs.
Watson-Crick base pairs are denoted with a dash and G:U base pairs denoted with a dot. In A the U2-U6 Helix I of the spliceosome [33] is shown. In B the interaction between the same portion of U6 snRNA and U4 snRNA in the U4/U6 snRNP is
shown.

S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae U4 snRNAs have no detectable
Ψs [26,29], whereas vertebrates, Drosophila, and V. faba
(bean), all have several Ψs in their U4 snRNAs [3]. One of
the three Ψs found in rat U4 snRNA (at position 4) is in a
portion of U4 snRNA that is predicted to interact with U6
snRNA, suggesting the presence of Ψ in this region of U4
snRNA could strengthen the interaction. An equivalent Ψ
is not present in C. elegans U4 snRNA but the Ψ at position
62, a Ψ that is found in no other sequenced U4 snRNA, is
in an area that is predicted to participate in a second intermolecular hybridization with C. elegans U6 snRNA (see
Fig. 5B). This A-Ψ base pair is in the middle of three G-U
base pairs and so would lend greater stability to the stem
formed by U4 and U6 snRNAs. This same snRNA-snRNA
interaction is predicted to have only one G-U base pair
with mammalian U4 and U6 snRNAs [44]. The A residue
in C. elegans U6 snRNA that the Ψ at position 62 of U4
snRNA pairs with is the same residue that is predicted to
base pair with the Ψ 28 of U2 snRNA (Fig. 5A), providing
evidence of the need to strengthen each of the snRNAsnRNA interactions that involve this region of U6 snRNA.

Conclusion

The total number of Ψs found in the snRNAs of C. elegans
is significantly higher than the minimal amount found in
yeasts but it is lower than that seen in sequenced vertebrate snRNAs. When the actual sites of modification on C.
elegans snRNAs are compared with other sequenced
snRNAs most of the positions correspond to modifications found in other species. However, two of the positions modified on C. elegans snRNAs are unique, one at
position 28 on U2 snRNA and one at position 62 on U4
snRNA. Both of these modifications are in regions of these
snRNAs that interact with U6 snRNA either in the spliceosome or in the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
particle (snRNP). These Ψs and may be involved in
strengthening the intermolecular association of the
snRNAs.
The determination of the Ψ residues in the spliceosomal
snRNAs of C. elegans will speed the identification of
enzymes and cofactors that are involved in the modification of these uridine residues. The location of the

modifications will also help in the identification of those
cofactors by providing sequences that can be used to
predict guide sequences in the snoRNAs. Once we can
identify cofactors we will be able to use the powerful
genetics of C. elegans to mutate the cofactors and affect the
formation of Ψ at any position in the snRNAs, especially
those that might be critical for the function of the splicing
cofactors.

Methods
All enzymes and the fmole® Sequencing Kit were purchased
from Promega Corporation (Madison, Wisconsin) except
for Taq DNA polymerase, which was purchased from
Fisher Scientific. The knockout of the C. elegans gene that
codes for the homologue of Pseudouridine synthase 1
(Pus1p; strain VC110, W06H3.2 (gk38)) was provided by
the C. elegans Reverse Genetics Core Facility at the University of British Columbia, which is funded by the Canadian
Institute for Health Research, Genome Canada, and
Genome BC. This strain was characterized in an earlier
publication [21].
The snRNA genes from C. elegans were amplified using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR; [45,46]) from genomic
DNA using the following primers: for U1 snRNA,
5'AAACTTACCTGGCTGGGGG3'
(U1For)
and
5'TTCAGGGCCGCGCGCACGC3' (U1RevA); for U2
snRNA, 5'ATCGCTTCTTCGGCTTATTAGC3' (U2For) and
5'ACTGGGCCGAGCCCGGCAGC3' (U2RevA); for U4
snRNA, 5'AGCTTTGCGCTGGGGCGATAACG3' (U4For)
and 5'TTCTGCCTCCTAGAGGCGTTC3' (U4RevA); for U5
snRNA, 5'AACTCTGGTTCCTCTGCATT3' (U5For) and
5'TGACCCGCTTTCTCAAGGAG3' (U5RevA); and for U6
snRNA, 5'GTTCTTCCGAGAACATATAC3'(U6For) and
5'AAAAATTTGGAACGCTTCACG3' (U6RevA). The fragments were gel purified, inserted into pGEMT, and
sequenced. The sequences of the inserts matched that of
the published snRNA genes from C. elegans [36].
Isolation of total RNA from worms and assay for Ψ
Total RNA from N2 worms grown at 20°C on Nematode
Growth Media plates was isolated as described [47]. Total
RNA (10 µg) was treated with 0, 0.041, or 0.167 M 1cyclohexyl-3(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodi-imide methop-toluenesulphonate (CMCT, Aldrich) for 15 minutes at
37°C, precipitated, and treated with sodium bicarbonate
as described [34,35]. These treated RNAs (1 µg) were used
in primer extension reactions using AMV reverse transcriptase and 32P-end-labeled primers as described [35]
and the products separated on denaturing (8.3 M urea)
10% polyacrylamide gels (19:1; acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Sequencing reactions using the same labeled primers were electrophoresed along with the primer extension
reactions [35,48]. The reverse primers listed above for the
cloning protocol were used first and the additional prim-

were:
for
U1
snRNA,
5'GGCCTAACCATGGGGATTCC3' (U1RevB); for U2
snRNA, 5' CATTCGAGTGTATACCGTAG 3' (U2RevB),
5'CCGAGTCTTCCCTAGGTTCC 3' (U2RevC) and
5'CCTTTATTACACTCATTCG3' (U2RevD); for U4 snRNA,
5'GCGTATGCCACCCATGTTTC3'
(U4RevB)
and
5'TAAACGCACCTCGGCAAAGC3' (U4RevC); for U5
snRNA, 5'GTAATACTCAGTAAATGCTCC3'(U5RevB) and
5'CTCAGTAAATGCTCCTTTGC3' (U5RevC); for U6
snRNA, 5'GCGTGTCATCCTTGCGCAGG3' (U6RevB) and
5'GCGCAGGGGCCATGCTAATC3' (U6RevC). The dried
gels were exposed to Kodak XAR film for various lengths
of time.
