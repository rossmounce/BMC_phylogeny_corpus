Molecular epidemiology of Plasmodium species
prevalent in Yemen based on 18 s rRNA
Abdulsalam MQ Al-Mekhlafi1*, Mohammed AK Mahdy1,2, Ahmed A Azazy2, Mun Yik Fong1

Abstract
Background: Malaria is an endemic disease in Yemen and is responsible for 4.9 deaths per 100,000 population per
year and 43,000 disability adjusted life years lost. Although malaria in Yemen is caused mainly by Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, there are no sequence data available on the two species. This study was
conducted to investigate the distribution of the Plasmodium species based on the molecular detection and to
study the molecular phylogeny of these parasites.
Methods: Blood samples from 511 febrile patients were collected and a partial region of the 18 s ribosomal RNA
(18 s rRNA) gene was amplified using nested PCR. From the 86 positive blood samples, 13 Plasmodium falciparum
and 4 Plasmodium vivax were selected and underwent cloning and, subsequently, sequencing and the sequences
were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods.
Results: Malaria was detected by PCR in 86 samples (16.8%). The majority of the single infections were caused by
P. falciparum (80.3%), followed by P. vivax (5.8%). Mixed infection rates of P. falciparum + P. vivax and P. falciparum
+ P. malariae were 11.6% and 2.3%, respectively. All P. falciparum isolates were grouped with the strain 3D7, while
P. vivax isolates were grouped with the strain Salvador1. Phylogenetic trees based on 18 s rRNA placed the
P. falciparum isolates into three sub-clusters and P. vivax into one cluster. Sequence alignment analysis showed
5-14.8% SNP in the partial sequences of the 18 s rRNA of P. falciparum.
Conclusions: Although P. falciparum is predominant, P. vivax, P. malariae and mixed infections are more prevalent
than has been revealed by microscopy. This overlooked distribution should be considered by malaria control
strategy makers. The genetic polymorphisms warrant further investigation.

Background
Malaria still continues to be a devastating global public
health problem in more than 100 countries with 3.2 billion people being at risk [1]. Of this number, 300-500
million people contract the disease each year, resulting
in 2-3 million deaths [2]. This includes 1 million children of less than five years of age [3].
The genus Plasmodium consists of nearly 200 species
that infect humans, birds, reptiles and mammals. It
belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. Five Plasmodium
species have been known to infect humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi
[4]. Much work on molecular phylogeny has focused on
the relationship between Plasmodium species and the

origin of human malaria [5-7]. Although the 18 s rRNA
gene appears to be robust for phylogenetic analysis, its
sequences should be analysed carefully since the gene
could be expressed as one of the three types during the
different developmental stages of the malaria parasite
[4,8]. Asexual type (A) and sporozoite type (S) were
found in P. falciparum, P. berghei, P. vivax, and other
species [4,9] while oocyst type (O) has been reported in
P. vivax [10].
Yemen is a country in the East Mediterranean region
where the highest incidence of malaria has been registered after Afghanistan [11] and is responsible for 4.9
deaths per 100000 per year and 43000 disability adjusted
life years (DALYs) lost [12]. Giemsa microscopy is the
most common diagnostic tool used in this country. This
technique has drawbacks, however, in terms of detecting
low parasitemic cases and the proper identification of
mixed infection could actually underestimate the malaria

situation in Yemen. Thus, the molecular approach was
applied for the first time, in this country, to investigate
the molecular epidemiology of malaria. The study will
indicate the magnitude of malaria co-infection which
should be considered in clinical case management. In
addition, malaria strains, genetic polymorphism and the
molecular phylogeny of Yemen Plasmodium isolates will
be studied.

Methods
Study area

The present study was conducted in five governorates with
a total population of 7.9 million [13]. The selected governorates included Taiz and Hodeidah, which represent the
mountainous hinterland and coastal areas, respectively;
and Rymah, Dhamar and Sana’a from the highland areas.
Most houses, especially in the rural areas, have a wooden
roof. Occupations include agriculture, fishing, livestock
and handicrafts. The peak time of malaria transmission in
the coastal areas occurs in winter (October-April), while
in the western mountains, the peak occurs in the summer
(May-September). In the highland areas, which are located
at more than 2000 metres above sea level, the transmission
of malaria occurs throughout the year [14]. Anopheles arabiensis is the main vector in the country but Anopheles
culicifacies plays an important role in the transmission of
malaria in the coastal area. Anopheles sergenti has also
been reported in the mountainous hinterland and highland areas [14]. There is a paucity of comparative data on
mortality and morbidity caused by malaria in the three
malaria endemic areas. An observational study showed
that mortality rate among children with severe malaria
was 2.4% and 3.5% for costal and hinterlands, respectively
[15]. However, no data were available on mortality rate in
the highland areas.
Sample collection and genomic DNA preparation

A total of 511 finger-prick blood samples were collected
from symptomatic patients attending hospitals or medical centres for the treatment of malaria. Blood from finger pricks from febrile patients was collected and
spotted on Whatman 3 MM filter papers (Whatman
International Ltd., Maidstone, England) and slides to
prepare thin and thick blood films. Each blood spot on
Whatman filter paper was allowed to air-dry and was
stored in a separate sealed plastic bag at room temperature until DNA extraction was required. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from the blood collected on
filter paper using QIAgen DNA Mini Kit blood and tissue (QIAGEN, cat. no. 51306, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a disc was
punched out from the blood spot using a pre-flamed
paper puncher and placed in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes
using clean, flamed forceps.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Genus-and species-specific nested PCR assays based on
the 18 s rRNA gene were used to detect and identify
Plasmodium species as previously reported [16]. Primary
PCR was carried out using genus-specific primers
(rPLU1 and rPLU5). PCR reaction was run in a total of
25 μL reaction mixture containing 4 μL genomic DNA,
1× i-Taq™buffer including MgCl2 (iNtRON BIOTECHNOLOGY, Seoul, Korea), 250 μM dNTP (iNtRON BIOTECHNOLOGY, Seoul, Korea)), 200 nM of each primer
and 1.25 U of i-Taq™DNA polymerase (iNtRON BIOTECHNOLOGY, Seoul, Korea). Secondary PCR was
carried out using species-specific primers (rFAL1/
rFAL2, rVIV1/rVIV2, rMAL1/rMAL2 and rOVA1/
rOVA2); each primer pair was placed in a single tube.
PCR mixtures were as mentioned above, except that
2 μL of the first PCR product was used as a template in
the secondary PCR.
The cycling conditions for primary PCR were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10 minutes,
then 40 cycles at 94°C for 20 seconds, annealing at 55°C
for 20 seconds, extension at 72°C for 1 minute, and a
final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. The reaction was
terminated by reducing the product temperature to 10°
C. PCR products were stored at -20°C until analysis.
Secondary PCR used similar cycling conditions except
that the number of cycles was reduced to 35 cycles.
Cloning and DNA sequencing

The PCR product comprising 17 positive samples (13 P.
falciparum and 4 P. vivax), representing different geographical areas, was selected for cloning and subsequent
sequencing. A partial sequence (~1200 bp) of the 18 s
rRNA gene was amplified with primers rPLU6 and
rPLU5. PCR was carried out in a volume of 20 μl mixture containing 1× Phusion HF buffer (Finnzymes, Finland), 200 μM of each dNTP (Finnzymes) and 400 nM
of each primer, and 1 U of Phusion DNA Polymerase
(Finnzymes). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial
denaturation at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 40
cycles of amplification at 98°C for 7 seconds, 59°C for
20 seconds and 72°C for 48 seconds followed by a final
extension step at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The amplified
products were cloned into Zero Blunt® vector according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (cat. No. K2700-20;
Invitrogen, USA). At least 20 colonies from each of
transformation reactions were screened using the rPLU6
and rPLU5 primers. Amplification was done in a 20 μl
reaction mixture containing 1× reaction buffer (5×
Green Go Taq Flexi Buffer, Promega Madison USA),
2 mM MgCl2 (Promega), 200 mM of each dNTP (Promega), 300 nM of each primer and 0.5 U Go Taq DNA
polymerase (Promega,). PCR conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation of 94°C for 10 minutes, followed by

Al-Mekhlafi et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:110
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/110

30 cycles of amplification at 94°C at 45 seconds, annealing at 55°C at 1 minute, extension at 72°C for 1 minute
30 seconds, followed by a final extension step at 72°C at
10 minutes. Plasmids from clones having the correct
insert were extracted using QIAprep® Spin Miniprep kit
(QIAgen, cat. no. 27106, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified plasmid containing the
insert was sequenced in both directions using the ABI
PRISM® BigDye™ terminator v3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in an 3700
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis

DNA sequences (forward and reverse) were edited and
the consensus sequence was created using the BioEdit.
Consensus sequences were multiple-aligned with previously published sequences from the GenBank database
using MEGA4 software http://www.megasoftware.net.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the MEGA4
software. Two types of phylogenetic analysis were used
on the aligned sequences to assess relationships among
isolates; a distance-based Neighbor-Joining (NJ) analysis
was performed calculated with the Kimura 2-parameter
[17], and Maximum Parsimony (MP) analysis was performed using the Close-Neighbour-Interchange algorithm [18]. The reliability of the trees was assessed by
the bootstrap method with 1,000 replications [19]. Similarity searches were carried out using the Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [20].

Results
A total of 511 blood samples from febrile patients were
screened by using 18 s rRNA-based nested PCR. Of the
511 samples, 86 (16.8%) were positive for malaria.
A majority of the malarial infections were due to P. falciparum (80.3%). Plasmodium vivax infections were seen
in only 5.8% of the samples. Double infections with P. falciparum + P. vivax (11.6%) and P. falciparum + P. malariae (2.3%) were also detected (Table 1). The PCR product
of 13 P. falciparum isolates and four of P. vivax were
selected from different geographical areas including the
coastal area, the hinterland and the highland malaria
endemic areas, and subjected to cloning and sequencing.
The 17 sequences representing P. falciparum and P.

vivax from this study (Table 2) and 13 sequences representing human, bird and primate malaria from the GenBank database, were multiple aligned and analysed using
the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and Maximum Parsimony
(MP) methods.
The NJ method (Figure 1) shows a main cluster for
P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, the chimpanzee malaria
(100 bootstrap). Within this main cluster, the Yemen
P. facliparum isolates were placed into three sub-clusters. The first sub-cluster includes 8 isolates which
grouped with P. falciparum 3D7 (GenBank Accession
number AE014186) (100 bootstrap). The second subcluster comprises 4 Yemen isolates and P. falciparum
Papua New Guinea (GenBank Accession number
AF145334) (100 bootstrap). The Yemen P. falciparum
isolate R73 diverged from other isolates and clustered
with P. falciparum (GenBank Accession number
AL844506) (99 bootstrap). The four Yemen isolates of
P. vivax were grouped in one cluster with P. vivax Salvador1 (GenBank Accession number U03079) (100
bootstrap). The monkey malaria parasites (P. cynomolgi
and P. knowlesi) were grouped with human P. vivax in
one cluster (100 bootstrap). Bird malaria parasites (P.
gallinaceum and P. lophurae) formed a separate cluster
(100 bootstrap). The maximum parsimony tree (Additional file 1) is concordant in topology with the NJ tree.
The thirteen 18 s rRNA sequences of Yemen isolates
of P. falciparum were multiple aligned against the 1135nucleotide sequence of 18 s rRNA of P. falciparum 3D7
(GenBank Accession number AE014186) to investigate
the genetic diversity of P. falciparum in Yemen

To determine whether the genetic diversity is due to
the heterogeneous types of Plasmodium 18 s rRNA or
not, phylogenetic trees were re-constructed based on
our sequences and sequences representing different
types of Plasmodium 18 s rRNA (A, O or S type) from
the GenBank database. Both the NJ tree (Figure 2) and
MP tree (Additional file 3) were consistent, placing all
the Yemen isolates of P. falciparum except isolate R73
into one cluster and clade with P. falciparum type-S
(GenBank Accession number M19173) (100 bootstrap).
The isolate R73 was much closer to P. falciparum 18 s
rRNA type-A (GenBank Accession number M19173)
(100 bootstrap). All P. vivax isolates were grouped with
P. vivax type-A in one cluster (GenBank Accession
number U07367) (100 bootstrap).

Discussion
This is the first study to apply molecular techniques to
study the epidemiology and phylogeny of malaria in
Yemen. Malaria infection rate, using 18 s rRNA-based
nested PCR, was 16.8% which is comparable with previous
studies carried out in Yemen based on Giemsa microscopy
[15,21-25]. PCR results showed that approximately 12% of
the positive malaria cases were mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax or P. malariae which is a higher rate
than has been hitherto reported. The high proportion of

(Additional file 2). The isolate T124 showed 25 SNP (19
substitutions, 1 insertion and 5 deletions). Isolates H61
and D122 showed 6 SNP (1 substitution and 5 deletions) and 8 SNP (1 substitution, 4 insertions and 3
deletions), respectively. Isolates T122 and T113 showed
7 SNP (1 substitution, 1 insertion and 5 deletions). Isolates D124, T116 and T71 had 10 SNP (10 deletions).
Isolates R117, H12, T91 and H87, which were clustered
together in the phylogenetic analysis, showed polymorphism in 5% of the 1135-nucleatide sequence. The
highest polymorphism (14.8%) was noted in the isolate
R73 which diverged in a separated cluster in the phylogenetic trees. The four sequences of the Yemen isolates
of P. vivax were also aligned against 1058-nucleotide
sequence of P. vivax Salvador1 (GenBank Accession
number U03079). The isolate H108 had 7 SNP (6 substitutions and 1 insertion). The isolate H15 had 7 SNP
(5 substitutions and 2 insertions). The isolates D24 and
H124 showed 5 SNP (5 substitutions).

mixed infection using molecular identification could be
explained by the high sensitivity of PCR [26] and the low
level parasitaemia of the dominated species which is under
the diagnostic threshold of Giemsa microscopy. Accurate
identification of mixed infection with malaria species is
very important for proper clinical case management.
Malaria treatment policy differs depending on the infecting species. Thus, in the case of mixed infection, if only
one species is treated, the other may establish a new episode of malaria.
Plasmodium falciparum is the dominant malaria species in Yemen followed by P. vivax, whereas P. malariae
has rarely been reported in Yemen. The current study
highlighted the possibility that P. malariae is distributed
more than expected and it is often overlooked due to
low levels of parasitaemia and the shortcoming of
microscopy, the only technique used for malaria detection and identification in the country. Furthermore, P.
malariae may be obscured by the dominant species.
The underestimation of P. malariae distribution has
been reported in other countries [27-30]
Phylogenetic analysis using the NJ method grouped
Yemen isolates of P. falciparum into one main cluster.
Within the main cluster, the Yemen isolates were placed
in three sub-clusters (Figure 1). These clusters were supported by cladograms using the MP method. One subcluster contained 8 isolates and P. falciparum 3D7 (GenBank Accession number AE014186) [31]. The second subcluster included four isolates and P. falciparum (GenBank
Accession number AF145334) which was isolated from
Papua New Guinea [32]. The isolate R73 formed a separate cluster with P. falciparum (GenBank Accession number AL844506). Phylogenetic analysis based on our
sequences and sequences from the GenBank representing
the secondary structure of 18 s rRNA showed that isolate
R73 that diverged in a separate cluster may be A-type
ribosomal rRNA, while the other two sub-clusters are Stype rRNA. Thus, genetic diversity within the Yemen isolates that grouped in one cluster with the S-type rRNA
may be not due to the heterogeneity of 18 s rRNA genes.
Genetic diversity may provide a mechanism for drug resistance which may affect any intervention strategy based on
treatment. Furthermore, PCR-based specific diagnosis of
Plasmodium species may fail due to sequence variations in
the priming regions, thus leading to false negative results.
The low sensitivity of PCR-based diagnosis due to genetic
mutations has been previously reported [30].

Conclusions
In conclusion, malaria is a major public health problem
in Yemen. Although P. falciparum is predominant, P.
vivax, P. malariae and mixed infections are more prevalent than has been revealed by microscopy. This overlooked distribution should be considered by malaria

control strategy makers. Sequences from P. falciparum
isolates showed high genetic polymorphisms that may
not be related to the variants of ribosomal RNA
expressed in the different stages of malaria parasites
which warrant further studies.
