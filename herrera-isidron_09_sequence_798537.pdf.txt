Abstract
The molecular characterization of isolates of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) from eight locations in
Mexico was undertaken by analyzing five regions located at the opposite ends of the virus genome.
Two regions have been previously used to study CTV variability (coat protein and p23), while the
other three correspond to other genomic segments (p349-B, p349-C and p13). Our comparative
nucleotide analyses included CTV sequences from different geographical origins already deposited
in the GenBank databases. The largest nucleotide differences were located in two fragments
located at the 5' end of the genome (p349-B and p349-C). Phylogenetic analyses on those five
regions showed that the degree of nucleotide divergence among strains tended to correlate with
their pathogenicity. Two main groups were defined: mild, with almost no noticeable effects on the
indicator plants and severe, with drastic symptoms. Mild isolates clustered together in every
analyzed ORF sharing a genetic distance below 0.022, in contrast with the severe isolates, which
showed a more disperse distribution and a genetic distance of 0.276. Analyses of the p349-B and
p349-C regions evidenced two lineages within the severe group: severe common subgroup (most
of severe isolates) and severe divergent subgroup (T36-like isolates). This study represents the first
attempt to analyze the genetic variability of CTV in Mexico by constructing phylogenetic trees
based on new genomic regions that use group-specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences. These
results may be useful to implement specific assays for strain discrimination. Moreover, it would be
an excellent reference for the CTV situation in México to face the recent arrival of brown citrus
aphid.

Background
Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is a destructive pathogen that
causes the most important disease of citrus. CTV is
phloem-limited and naturally transmitted by several species of aphids in a semipersistent mode and by the use of
infected propagative budwood [1].

CTV infects almost all citrus species, including hybrids
and relatives, causing different range of symptoms
depending on the host and virus strain. The most common symptoms are: quick decline (QD) or death of most
citrus species propagated on the sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) rootstock; stem pitting (SP) of the scion that

reduces the yield and fruit quality of some citrus varieties
regardless of the rootstock; and seedling yellows which is
seen on sour orange, lemon (Citrus lemon (L.) Burn. f.)
and grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.). Strains that not elicit
symptoms on commercial citrus hosts have been named
as mild isolates [2].

site ends covering around the 20% of the CTV genome.
These DNA fragments include two fragments of the p349
ORF located at the 5'end of the genome: p349-B (nucleotides 1460 to 2350) and p349-C (nucleotides 6870 to
7900) and the ORFs CP, p23 and p13 (located at the 3'
end).

Citriculture represents a very important activity in Mexico
where 517,000 has. are grown in several agroecological
regions yielding 7.1 million tons of fruit [3]. CTV was first
detected in the Mexican State of Tamaulipas in 1983.
Extensive survey in the major citrus growing regions indicated (up to 2006) that CTV incidence was low (< 1%) in
other 17 States of Mexico. Because of the random pattern
of the infected trees, CTV infection was probably propagated in Mexico by the use of infected budwood, rather
than by aphid vectors [4]. In general, the trees remain
asymptomatic, without declining suggesting a possible
prevalence of mild strains. However, Mexican citrus
industry is now facing a real and immediate threat due to:
i) the recent introduction to Mexico of the most efficient
vector of CTV, commonly called brown citrus aphid
(BCA), Toxoptera citricida and ii) the predominance of
sour orange as rootstock (the most susceptible to CTV) in
almost the totality of the citrus groves.

Alignments of these genomic regions indicated that variations at nucleotide level were simple nucleotide changes.
Overall similarities for the five regions among CTV Mexican isolates ranged from 71.2 to 100% at the nucleotide
level; however, the sequences of these strains clustered
into two groups that were highly homologous (92.1–
100% identical nucleotides and 92.9–100% identical
amino acid) such as Mx-Mich, Mx-Ver, Mx-QR, Mx-NL,
Mx-Yuc and Mx-Col and less homologous sequences
(71.2–96.7% identical nucleotides and 71.6–96.4% identical amino acid) such as Mx-Tam and Mx-BC (data not
shown).

In early 2000, T. citricida was first found in Quintana Roo,
Mexico apparently spreading from Belize. Recently it
reached the citrus regions of the Mexican states of
Campeche, Yucatán, Veracruz and Tabasco. Several favorable conditions exist in Mexico for the spreading of BCA.
This could facilitate the displacement of migrant winged
insects to new locations.
Despite the importance of CTV, there is a lack of knowledge about the genetic diversity of CTV in Mexico. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the
molecular variability of CTV isolates collected in eight of
the major citrus growing areas in Mexico, before the
spreading of the BCA.

Results
Biological characterization of the CTV isolates
Symptoms of CTV isolates varied in their severity and
ranged from a severe SP observed in the isolates Mx-Tam
and Mx-BC (Mexican lime on C. macrophylla) to those as
Mx-Yuc and Mx-QR, which showed a mild vein clearing in
Mexican lime. Incipient SP and vein clearing were
observed for Mx-Mich, Mx-NL, Mx-Col, Mx-Ver and MxQR. When sour orange was used as rootstock, a gradual
declining occurred for the Mx-Tam isolate associated to
pinholing or honeycombing below the bud union.
Phylogeny and genetic variability in CTV isolates
The nucleotide sequences of five regions of the CTV
genome were determined. They are situated at the oppo-

The neighbour-joined method of Clustal × program was
used to generate phylogenetic trees for each ORF including the following full length CTV sequences: T36 [5] and
T30 from Florida [6], VT from Israel [7], T385 from Spain
[8], SY568 from California [9] and NUagA from Japan
[10]. In order to compare our five amplified regions as
individual ORFs, sequences from regions p349-B and
p349-C were combined and named as p349-B/C.
The phylogenetic trees were topologically similar for all
the ORFs. A very consistent and defined cluster was
observed with a bootstrapping over 990, which included
the highly homologous Mexican isolates (Mex-QR, MexMich, Mex-NL, Mex-Col, Mex-Ver and Mex-Yuc) as well as
isolates T30 and T385 (figure 1). Despite the distant geographical origin of the isolates, they all induced mild
symptoms on indicator plants and only mild stem pitting
on the Mexican lime.
On the other hand, CTV Isolates Mex-Tam, Mex-BC,
NUagA, VT, SY568 and T36, which induced severe symptoms, showed a more disperse phylogenetic distribution
(figure 1). The comparative analysis revealed that both
severe Mexican isolates Mx-Tam and Mx-BC, tended to be
clustered away from the group formed by NUagA, VT and
SY568, although not enough to be considered a separate
cluster. Similar clustering was obtained using the predicted amino acid sequences (data not shown).
The calculated sequence diversity for the mild cluster was
almost the same for the five analyzed regions ranging
from 0.002 to 0.022. On the contrary, the severe cluster
showed an increased diversity especially toward the 5'end
of the genome (CP < p23 < p13 < p349-B < p349-C) (table
1).

Interestingly, two observations could be emphasized for
the p349 gene. First, the genomic regions p349-B and
p349-C showed the greatest diversity (0.143 and 0.169,
respectively), twice as much as the one for CP, p13 and
p23. Second, the T36 isolate remained separated in the
phylogenetic tree for p349-B/C region. When the genetic
distances were calculated for the severe group excluding
the T36 isolate, it showed little variation for CP, p13 and
p23, but it diminished two-fold p349-B (0.233 to 0.143)
and for p349-C (0.276 to 0.120) (data not shown). The
marked increase in the genetic diversity given by the T36
isolate suggests the presence of two lineages within the
severe group.
To further analyze this possibility, a 280-nucleotide fragment from p349-B region (nucleotides 3333 to 4000) was
compared for 44 CTV isolates which nucleotide sequences
and biological behaviors had been previously reported
[11]. Topology of the phylogenetic trees constructed from
sequences alignments (for nucleotide as well as for amino
acid residues) was similar to those observed for the p349B/C. In this case, the T36 isolate considerably diverged
forming an additional cluster with other two severe CTV
isolates (T734 and T346) (data not shown). Another phylogenetic tree confirmed the divergence of the selected
CTV isolates into three groups according to the severity
level: one contained the 30 isolates (mild group), a second contained the previously reported five severe isolates
and other ten more (severe common group), and a third
one contained severe isolates which were located in the
same branch along with T36 isolate (severe divergent

group). Within- and between-groups nucleotide diversity
analyses indicated that all mild isolates had a very low
average intra-group genetic diversity (0.013) while the
severe groups showed values up to seven times higher
than the mild isolates. The inter-group distances were
always higher than within groups. The highest variability
(0.633 and 0.584) was observed among the severe divergent group and the other two groups (mild and severe
common) respectively, thus confirming that the severe
divergent group represents a different CTV genotype
(table 2).
Additionally, clones obtained from five Mexican isolates
belonged to more than one group: mild and severe common groups. This was the case of severe isolates Mx-BC for
p349-B and Mx-Tam for p349-C, and mild isolates MxCol, Mx-Mich and Mx-NL, illustrating the presence of different sequence variants in their gRNA populations. However, several rounds of amplification, cloning and
sequencing were repeated for these isolates and only the
consensus nucleotide sequences of the major variants
were considered in the analyses.
Similarly, the CP and p23 sequences from 24 and 28 CTV
isolates from the GenBank databases were compared,
respectively. As a result, the spatial distributions in the
phylogenetic trees for CP and p23 were very similar to the
observed with only 14 isolates shown in the figure 1. The
mild isolates were grouped in a single branch with a high
intra-group homology greater than 98% while for the
severe isolates this rank was smaller, between 80–85%
(data not shown).
Nucleotide and amino acid substitutions of the CTV
variants
A further visual examination of the sequences alignments
for all the isolates revealed group-specific features that can
be used to classify isolates. Group-specific nucleotides
could be identified for each ORF and many of them were
located on regions p349-C (37.3%), p349-B (32.0%), followed by p23 (20.0%), CP (13.3%) and p13 (10.7%)
(table 3). The majority of the sequence polymorphisms
corresponded to single changes, and only three putative
stretches of nucleotides were observed for the regions
p349-C (positions 310–311 and 355–357) and p23 (positions 86–87).

Sequence alignments revealed that 85% of differential
nucleotides could be classified in severe isolates (including T36 isolate) and the mild isolates. On the other hand,
the 25% of the remainder polymorphisms distinguished
the isolate T36 from the others, whether severe common
or mild isolates. Most of these T36 typical changes were
observed throughout the p349-B and p349-C genomic
regions and only two of these types of changes were

located at position 360 in the CP gene and at position 117
in the p23 gene (table 3). Finally, there were three nucleotide insertions at positions 153, 369 and 792 in the
sequence of T36 for p349-C region (data not shown).
Many of these nucleotide substitutions yielding amino
acid changes were conserved within each group. From the
34 group-specific amino acid substitutions that were identified, 14 were located in the p349-B (table 4).

Discussion
The genetic diversity of different regions on the genomic
RNA of CTV isolates from Mexico was analyzed for the
first time. The phylogenetic relationships of CTV have
been analized utilizing genomic regions such as CP, p20,
p23, p27, p349 (genomic regions A and F), 5'and 3' UTR.
To better understand the diversity among different CTV
isolates from Mexico, genes CP, p23, p13, p349-B and
p349-C were sequenced. This approach allowed the comparison of the Mexican isolates with those previously
reported and also look for additional regions that may be
useful to further characterize CTV strains. The regions analyzed here are located at opposite sides of the CTV
genome.

prising since their considerable differences in geographical origin and time of sampling. This high similarity was
observed for the first time dissecting the complete consensus sequences of the mild isolates T30 from Florida and
T385 from Spain, which were geographically isolated for
at least 24 years [12]. However, a different situation was
observed for the severe isolates, where the genetic distance
had a large range of variation (from to 0.066 to 0.276)
and a unique branch could not be identified for them. In
this way, the severe isolates were located more dispersed
in the trees for all ORFs as opposed to the mild isolates.
The diversity among the severe isolates obtained was not
random and the ORF p349, located in the 5'region of the
viral genome was twice more variable than those located
in the 3' end. The analyses of other two areas located into
the ORF p349, region A (nucleotide 2021 to 2548) and
region F (nucleotide 3561 to 3998), for 30 CTV isolates
from Spain and California, showed appreciable differences because the former showed the greatest diversity
(0.136). The values of genetic distance determined by us
for the other two regions of p349:p349-B (nucleotides
1460 to 2350) and p349-C (nucleotides 6870 to 7900)
were 0.143 and 0.169 respectively and coincide with
those reported for the region A [11].

To achieve homogeneity in the sequence alignments, the
Mexican isolates were compared with six geographical
and biologically distinct isolates and whose complete
genome sequences are known: a severe quick decline isolate T36 from Florida-USA (Karasev et al., 1995), grapefruit stem pitting and a decline isolate VT from Israel
(Mawassi et al., 1996), a sweet orange stem pitting and
seeding yellow isolate SY568 imported into CaliforniaUSA (Yang et al., 1999), a seedling-yellows-inducing isolate NUagA from Japan (Suastika et al., 2001) and two
mild isolates, T385 from Spain (Vives et al., 1999) and
T30 from Florida-USA (Albiach-Martí et al., 2000).

These observations were confirmed by comparing a
sequence that covers the final 300 nucleotides of the
p349-B region from 44 additional CTV isolates. This
nucleotide stretch of DNA was found to be highly conserved in isolates from the same group (mean of 0.076),
but highly variable among isolates of different groups
(mean of 0.451), which supported the differentiation of
CTV isolates for this region into three major genotypes
here designed as: mild, severe common (all severe isolates
excluding T36 group) and severe divergent isolates (T36like isolates).

Our results showed that clustering of isolates highly correlates with their symptom severity. The overall branching
pattern of the phylogenetic trees based on all regions were
highly similar for all the mild isolates, including six of our
Mexican isolates, forming a single cluster. The genetic distance analyses based on these segments indicated that the
mild isolates were almost identical with a very low genetic
diversity intra-group (lower than 0.022) independently
from any analyzed ORFs. Such high similarity may be sur-

Sequences obtained from five Mexican isolates belonged
to more than one group. It is possible that when a mixture
of mild and severe clones are present in the host at different ratios, disease development can be restricted by a large
excess of mild viral genome, even though the diseasecausing variant remains at low levels in the viral populations. Previous reports have extensively demonstrated that
most CTV isolates are composed by a population of genetically related variants (haplotypes) that could have origi-

with diverged sequence variants [13]. Also, the presence of
mixed infection should be expected in woody plants that
may live many years and are exposed to multiple aphid
inoculations [14].

countries since all sequences could be assigned to one of
the three types previously established [15].
Another report compared the predominant sequence variants of p23 gene from 18 CTV isolates of different geographic origin and pathogenicity (Sambade et al., 2003).
As a result of the phylogenetic analyses, the CTV isolates
were separated in three groups: first including the mild
isolates, second including the most of severe isolates and
third, an atypical group which showed variable pathogenicity. This last group was loosely related and included
asymptomatic as well as seedling yellows isolates, maybe
as result of recombination events (Sambade et al., 2003).
In that report the intra-group genetic diversity for mild
and severe isolates were similar of what we found, confirming that p23 is more heterogeneous that some others
ORFs located toward 3' termini as p13 and CP. When we
compared the eight Mexican isolates with those 18
reported for p23 [13], the divergence among the CTV isolates was supported for only two clearly distinct groups:
mild and severe.

We observed that the nucleotide and amino acid variation
were higher for 5' termini than for 3' termini indicating
that the former target appears to be better suited to molecular clarification of relationship among CTV strains. In
turn, the conserved 3' terminal nucleotide sequences
would be insufficient to establish possible sub-groups
inside of severe isolates to which the virus belongs.
Our results are in agreement with several reports that suggest a considerable degree of sequence variation in the
CTV isolates mostly toward 5' termini of the genome. The
sequencing of the 5' untranslated genomic region from
eight CTV isolates from Spain and Japan, allowed their
classification into three groups, I (severe-like T36), II
(severe-like VT) and III (mild) represented by sequences
of T36, VT and T317–8 (similar to T385), respectively,
with a very low intergroup nucleotide identity ranged
between 44 and 66%. This grouping was confirmed by
sequencing an additional 15 virus isolates from several

Similar mild genotypes have been found in several countries and led to speculate that this group is well adapted to
its host and could have evolved from the same original

sequence. As hypothesized, the divergences of the CTV
strains could initiated in four possible different progenitors species in South East Asia prior to citrus cultivation
[12]. According with this rationale, they spread to different citrus growing areas via infected budwood within the
last 200 years. Then, mild strains could be distributed by
growers due to the absence of symptoms on the commercial varieties and to the lack of certification programs.

The group-specific genome features identified here would
provide a valuable tool for the generation of diagnostic
tools for an early discrimination of virus strains based in
at least five viral genome regions. Thus, the success of the
citrus management strategies could depend in part, of the
elucidation of the diversity and evolutionary relationships
of the CTV isolates present in the different citrus areas of
Mexico.

In contrast, severe isolates induce stem-pitting, which
affect the plant physiology and therefore reduce vigor and
yield and cause eventually the death of the tree [2]. So, the
visibly affected trees had been continuously eliminated or
not propagated. Probably, like other viruses, the flow and
evolution could have been interrupted several times creating successive bottlenecks leading to variability.

Methods

Conclusion
This study represents the first attempt to analyze the
genetic variability of CTV strains in Mexico. The analysis
of eight CTV isolates, originally obtained from Mexican
citrus fields, confirms that the CTV has been present in
many citrus-producing of Mexico as a mixture of variants
with different biological and genetic properties for long
time. The divergence found between the isolates Mx-Tam
and Mx-BC and also among these two severe isolates and
the other six mild isolates plus the relative distant geographical separation of isolates, may suggest that it is
unlikely that one strain evolved from the other after arriving to Mexico. It is likely, that the introduction of CTV to
Mexico was under independent events an in several occasions to different citrus areas occurred via the use of
infected propagative budwood sources.
Taking into account in the recent arrival of the aphid T. citricida to Mexico, the most important vector of CTV, and the
predominance of sour orange as a rootstock in almost all
the country, this fact should be of great concern for the
future of the Mexican citrus industry.

Virus isolates
Samples from CTV-infected plants were collected by technicians of the Dirección General de Sanidad Vegetal
(DGSV), in eight citrus-growing areas of Mexico between
1983 and 2000. CTV isolates were graft-propagated and
maintained in insect-proof greenhouses at DGSV headquarters at Mexico City. These isolates were biologically
characterized on graft-inoculated indicator plants using
different scion/rootstock combinations. Scions included
Mexican lime, grapefruit, and sweet orange, whereas Citrus macrophylla and sour orange were used as rootstocks.
Geographic origin and symptoms induced by these CTV
isolates are summarized in table 5.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted using fresh bark tissue from
healthy/CTV-infected plants in the presence of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The final RNA preparation was dissolved in 30 μl of
RNase-free distilled water.

For the reverse transcription (RT), 300 ng of total RNA
and the reverse primer were incubated at 70°C for 5 min
and chilled immediately on ice for 3 min. The mixture was
added to provide a final concentration of 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
500 μM of each dNTPs, 25 pmol of antisense primer, 20
U RNasin and 200 U MLV-RT (Promega, Madison, WI).

This mixture was incubated at 42°C for 60 min. Resultant
cDNA was then used subsequent PCR amplifications consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 at 25°C, 50 mM KCl,
2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 25 pmoles of each
pair of primer and 10 units of Taq Polymerase (Promega,
Madison, WI). PCRs were carried out in a iCycler Termocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) as follows: one cycle at
95°C for 2 min, then forty cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 50°C
for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. In the last step samples were
maintained for 5 min at 72°C.
Five different sets of primers were designed in our lab to
direct the amplification of several genomic regions (table
6). These regions were selected as conserved regions after
aligning the published CTV sequences from different geographical regions [8,12].
Cloning and nucleotide sequencing
The reaction mixture was fractioned by agarose gel electrophoresis and the PCR products were purified using the
GeneClean glass bead method (Bio101, Vista, CA) and
ligated into pGEM-T Easy Vector System II (Promega,
Madison, WI). The ligation mixture was used to transform
Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Plasmids containing the
expected sizes were chosen for sequencing. At least, three
clones of each isolates were sequenced in both directions
to obtain a consensus sequences by the Dye Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) in an
ABI PRISM 377 sequencer
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Multiple sequences of different CTV isolates were aligned
using the software MegAlign 4.0 of the Lasergene package
(DNASTAR Inc. Madison). The unrooted and neighbourjoined phylogenetic trees were prepared using Clustal ×
[16] and drawn with TreeView 1.5 (Page, 1996). The
robustness of individual internal phylogenetic tree nodes
was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap reiterations. Clustal

W algorithm was used for the estimation of genetic distance by the Kimura two-parameter method [17]. A
genetic distance was also calculated using MEGA 2.1 with
the output used to calculate both individual pairwise
diversity and mean pairwise diversity using the Kimura-2parameter approach.
The nucleotide sequences of the Mexican isolates
obtained in this study were deposited in the GenBank
database under the accession numbers: AF342890 to
AF342895, AY649491 to AY649492, and AF652892 to
AF652923.
