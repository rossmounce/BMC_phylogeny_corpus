Abstract
Background: The Vesicomyidae (Bivalvia: Mollusca) are a family of clams that form symbioses with
chemosynthetic gamma-proteobacteria. They exist in environments such as hydrothermal vents
and cold seeps and have a reduced gut and feeding groove, indicating a large dependence on their
endosymbionts for nutrition. Recently, two vesicomyid symbiont genomes were sequenced,
illuminating the possible nutritional contributions of the symbiont to the host and making genomewide evolutionary analyses possible.
Results: To examine the genomic evolution of the vesicomyid symbionts, a comparative genomics
framework, including the existing genomic data combined with heterologous microarray
hybridization results, was used to analyze conserved gene content in four vesicomyid symbiont
genomes. These four symbionts were chosen to include a broad phylogenetic sampling of the
vesicomyid symbionts and represent distinct chemosynthetic environments: cold seeps and
hydrothermal vents.
Conclusion: The results of this comparative genomics analysis emphasize the importance of the
symbionts' chemoautotrophic metabolism within their hosts. The fact that these symbionts appear
to be metabolically capable autotrophs underscores the extent to which the host depends on them
for nutrition and reveals the key to invertebrate colonization of these challenging environments.

Background
Symbiosis between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is a
globally important phenomenon that influences the
physiology, ecology, and evolution of virtually every
organism on this planet [1-3]. Eukaryotic hosts expand
their ecological niches through symbiosis with these metabolically diverse bacteria and archaea. An illustrative case
is that of the chemosynthetic endosymbionts, which enable their hosts to populate and thrive in challenging environments such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold

seeps [4]. In these environments, reduced inorganic compounds are generated either biotically (e.g. microbial sulfate reduction) or abiotically (e.g. hydrothermal
alteration). Chemosynthetic symbionts use the energy
derived from the oxidation of these molecules to fix inorganic carbon [5]. Benefits for both partners in chemosynthetic symbioses are evident. The bacteria gain further
access to the energy substrates they require from both oxic
and anoxic habitats while the animals are provided with
much, if not all, of their nutritional requirements [6-8].

The intimate structural and metabolic coupling often
found in chemosynthetic symbioses underscores the
importance of these relationships to host survival.
The vesicomyid clams are one of the better studied chemosynthetic symbioses and exist at hydrothermal vents,
hydrocarbon seeps, and other chemically reduced environments. They are also relatively young as a group, as
vesicomyid fossils date the formation of the symbiosis to
the Cretaceous, between 50–100 Ma ago [9]. These clams
have a greatly reduced gut and feeding groove [10] and,
based on isotopic evidence, are thought to depend almost
entirely on their endosymbionts for their carbon [11-13].
With respect to the animal host, the association is essential – no living vesicomyids have been found devoid of
symbionts. Furthermore, these symbionts have not yet
been found outside the host, have never been cultured in
the laboratory, and are thought to be predominantly
maternally transmitted each generation via the egg [1416].
Previous studies of other bacterial symbionts suggest that
symbiont transmission strategy is a predominant factor
governing nutritional symbiont genome evolution. Bacterial symbionts transferred to the next host generation via
the egg (vertical transmission) experience population bottlenecks upon transmission and few opportunities for
recombination [17]. Because of the underlying deletion
bias in bacterial genome evolution, and the limited
amount of gene flow available to these symbionts, their
genomes are minimized. For example, the genomes of the
vertically transmitted, mutualistic insect endosymbionts
Buchnera, Baumannia, Blochmannia, and Wigglesworthia are
all reduced in size and content [18-21], exhibiting few
chromosomal rearrangements, or horizontal gene transfer
events [22-25]. However, these insect nutritional symbionts retain the genomic repetoire needed to provide key
metabolic intermediates, vitamins, and amino acids often
missing from their hosts' specialized diets [26], suggesting
that host nutritional needs might select for retention of
specific biosynthetic pathways. Conversely, those pathways redundant with host capabilities or nutrition are
often lost completely [26]. In contrast to the strictly vertically transmitted symbionts, those that undergo occasional environmental or horizontal transmission (lateral
acquisition) tend to have slightly larger genomes that
exhibit evidence of recombination. For example, Wolbachia pipientis, the ubiquitous insect reproductive parasite, may be laterally transmitted [27,28], and their
genomes are littered with mobile genetic elements,
prophages and harbor clear evidence of past recombination events [29,30].
It must be noted, however, that transmission strategy for
many symbionts cannot be distinctly or clearly demar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/585

cated; depending on the association, symbionts are perpetuated via a spectrum from strict vertical transmission
to lateral acquisition. The insect reproductive parasites
(such as Wolbachia and CFBs) are vertically transmitted
but occasionally laterally acquired. Indeed, there is also
some phylogenetic evidence, in the form of incongruent
host and symbiont trees, against strict vertical transmission of the vesicomyid symbionts [31]. More recently, two
different strains of the vesicomyid symbionts have been
found within the same host, corroborating the lateral
acquisition hypothesis suggested by the phylogenetic evidence above [32]. However, the vesicomyid symbionts are
found in host primary oocytes [15,16] and their genomes
are reduced, and exhibit a high A+T content [33,34], suggesting that although occasional lateral transmission may
occur, the predominant transmission strategy used by the
vesicomyids is vertical.
This mixed transmission strategy suggested for the vesicomyid symbionts has the potential to influence the
genomic evolution of these bacteria. Research on the comparative evolutionary genomics of insect symbionts
[18,19,21,35,36] suggests that symbionts with strictly vertical transmission strategies would lose genetic material
redundant with host capabilities and retain metabolic
pathways necessary for host survival. Occasional lateral
transmission might offer the opportunity for recombination and horizontal gene transfer, possibly mitigating the
negative effects associated with a reduction in population
size. Indeed, some evidence of recombination has been
found in the vesicomyid symbiont genomes, suggesting
that genomic evolution of these bacteria may not be as
straightforward as in strictly vertically transmitted symbionts [32].
We chose a comparative framework, utilizing both
genomic and heterologous microarray data, to investigate
genome evolution in the vesicomyid chemosynthetic
symbionts. The genomes of the two fully sequenced vesicomyid symbionts, Ruthia magnifica, isolated from hydrothermal vents, and Vesicomyosocious okutanii, isolated from
cold seeps [33,34] were compared to each other and to
that of Thiomicrospira crunogena, a free-living chemoautotroph isolated from hydrothermal vents and the closest
sequenced relative of the vesicomyid symbionts [37,38].
The availability of sequenced vesicomyid symbiont
genomic data allowed us to develop microarrays for
genome-scale analyses of conserved gene content in other
vesicomyid symbionts. Indeed, the great amount of
genetic conservation and synteny between the two
sequenced vesicomyid symbiont genomes [39] suggests
that the use of cross-species microarrays in the vesicomyid
symbionts may be particularly informative. Affymetrix
microarrays based on the R. magnifica genome were constructed and hybridized to genomic DNA from two other

related vesicomyid symbionts, those of Vesicomya sp. mtII and Calyptogena kilmeri. Vesicomya sp. mt-II is part of a
cryptic species complex which includes the clam formerly
known as Calytogena pacifica [40].
A sampling strategy was chosen to illuminate possible
effects of phylogenetic relationships and host geochemical environment on vesicomyid symbiont genome evolution. These four symbionts include representatives from
each major clade of the vesicomyid symbiont lineage (Figure 1) and therefore allow us to estimate a vesicomyid
symbiont core genome. The symbionts investigated here
also live within hosts inhabiting two distinct chemosynthetic environments: cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.
These habitats differ in their geochemistry with regards to
the quantity of oxygen, nitrate and redox state of sulfur
available for the symbioses. The data presented here suggest a tremendous amount of genomic stasis and conserved gene content in the vesicomyid symbiont lineage;
in the 50–100 Ma that the symbionts have been host associated, their genomes have changed surprisingly little.
These data also support existing evidence for lateral acquisition of the vesicomyid symbionts [31]. These results
underscore the importance of the symbionts' chemoautotrophic metabolism within their hosts; they emphasize
the extent to which host metabolic needs have contributed to genomic evolution in this endosymbiont lineage.

Results and discussion
Four chemosynthetic symbiont genomes were compared
in this study, two sequenced genomes (the hydrothermal
vent clam symbiont Ruthia magnifica and the cold seep
clam symbiont Vesicomyosocious okutanii) and gene content for two other strains (the symbionts from the cold
seep clam Calyptogena kilmeri and the hydrothermal vent
clam V. sp. mt-II) based on heterologous microarray
hybridizations (Figure 1). The R. magnifica genome was
used to build microarrays for heterologous hybridization
to other vesicomyid symbionts. Heterologous microarray
hybridization is especially useful when comparing strainlevel variation as arrays designed based on one of the
strains are likely to hybridize to the DNA of other strains
[41-44]. Below, differences between the sequenced
genomes are first discussed with reference to a free-living
chemoautotroph, Thiomicrospira crunogena. Although T.
crunogena is not part of the direct lineage of the vesicomyid symbionts, it is the closest sequenced relative of the
chemosynthetic symbionts and provides us with some
perspective as to the gene content necessary to be a functional chemoautotroph. We then discuss chemosynthetic
symbiont metabolism and evolution based on both
sequence and microarray analyses.
As expected based on their maternal transmission, when
compared to T. crunogena [38], these symbiont genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/585

are reduced in size and G + C content (Table 1). The vesicomyid symbiont genomes are about half the size of T.
crunogena's genome; of the 2,193 proteins in the T. crunogena genome, the symbionts encode ~40%. The T. crunogena genome encodes enzymes and structures lacking
from many intracellular bacteria (flagellar apparatuses,
pili, extrachromosomal elements) but many of T. crunogena's metabolic capabilities are found in the vesicomyid
symbiont genomes (Table 2). Indeed, there are proteins
unique to the vesicomyid symbionts when compared to T.
crunogena and a few of these may increase the symbionts'
functional potential within their hosts. For example, the
symbiont sulfur oxidation pathway includes both the Sox
(sulfur oxidation) and the Dsr (dissimilatory sulfite
reductase) enzymes [33], and therefore appears to be
more complex than that of T. crunogena, which encodes
the Sox system exclusively [38]. Thus, these symbiont
genomes encode for many of the metabolic pathways of
free-living chemoautotrophs despite being reduced in
size.
The sequenced vesicomyid symbiont genomes are quite
similar to each other in both gene content and order. Of
976 and 939 proteins encoded in the R. magnifica and V.
okutanii genomes respectively, 886 orthologs are conserved across both, which share a relatively high (82.5%)
amino acid identity. The V. okutanii and R. magnifica
genomes also share an extraordinary amount of synteny,
as clear from a LAGAN analysis by Kuwahara et al., 2008.
Here, an analysis of synteny using MUMmer revealed that
a total of 82% of genes in R. magnifica remain in the same
genomic context and relative location in V. okutanii, with
a single inversion [39]. This 22.9 kb inversion is comprised of 14 genes including those involved in cofactor
biosynthesis (coaD, octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase),
potassium uptake (trkHA), regulation of nitrogen utilization (ntrXY), and chaperonins (dnaKJ) (see Additional file
1). The inversion did not truncate any of the genes in the
region and their orientation does not seem to obviously
affect gene function as no operons are disrupted.
There is a striking similarity between these two vesicomyid symbiont genomes, but a few substantial differences
stand out. Genes unique to R. magnifica and V. okutanii are
largely in the cell envelope and energy metabolism role
categories, respectively (see Additional file 1). The R. magnifica genome has a large region comprised of 20 open
reading frames lacking in V. okutanii's genome (see Additional file 1). This region primarily encodes proteins predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of
polysaccharides and peptidoglycan, components of the
cell envelope. The lack of this region in V. okutanii suggests
that perhaps the vesicomyid symbiont intracellular lifestyle does not require the synthesis of peptidoglycan.
Conversely, the R. magnifica genome lacks V. okutanii's

dissimilatory nitrate reductase operon (see Additional file
1), which encodes energy metabolism proteins similar to
the membrane-bound, respiratory nitrate reductase
(NarGHIJ) found in Escherichia coli and other proteobacteria [34,45]. This operon may enable V. okutanii to utilize
nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor and may reduce
competition between host and symbiont for oxygen,
although this has yet to be demonstrated. This ability –
which may have significant implications for the association's capacity to exploit hypoxic niches – may represent a
significant functional difference between these two symbionts.
The heterologous microarray hybridizations of V. sp mt-II
and C. kilmeri symbiont genomic DNA to the R. magnifica
array confirm the genomic stasis suggested by the
sequence comparisons with V. okutanii. Indeed, all of the
microarray features hybridized to the C. kilmeri symbiont
gDNA, indicating that this symbiont contains at least the
genomic repertoire of R. magnifica (Table 2, Figure 2),
while 92% of probed genes did not hybridize to the V. sp.
mt-II gDNA (See Additional file 1). Of this 8.1% of proteins putatively absent from the V. sp. mt-II symbiont
genome, the majority (34/84) are of unknown function
and it is therefore difficult to predict how symbiont
metabolism and host interaction might be affected. A
total of 854 proteins are shared by all four vesicomyid
symbiont genomes and this core genome encodes pathways for sulfur oxidation, nitrogen assimilation and carbon fixation, as well as synthesizing the 19 amino acids
and 9 vitamins and cofactors, pathways central to their
chemoautotrophic metabolism.
Interestingly, neither reducing environment nor phylogenetic position correlated strongly with genomic content.
The genomes of the two vent clam symbionts (R. magnifica and V. sp. mt-II symbionts) did not share any gene
content to the exclusion of the two symbionts isolated
from seep clams (C. kilmeri and C. okutanii symbionts)
and vice versa. In fact, based on the comparative genomic
hybridization results, the C. kilmeri seep clam symbiont is
more similar to the vent clam symbiont R. magnifica than
to V. okutanii. This is a surprising result as the C. kilmeri
symbiont clades with V. okutanii in 16S rRNA phylogenetic trees (Figure 1). Also, the vent clam symbiont V. sp.

mt-II seems to share genomic excisions with the seep clam
symbiont V. okutanii in comparison to R. magnifica; the
same polysaccharide biosynthesis region absent from V.
okutanii is also missing from the V. sp. mt-II genome.
These results are inconsistent with predictions of symbiont genomic content based on strict vertical transmission
and instead support a mixed transmission strategy for
these bacteria [31]. Occasional lateral transmission
events, bringing two distinct bacterial symbionts together
in the same host background, would provide the necessary opportunity for recombination in this lineage leading
to this observed result: a mosaic of evolutionary histories
throughout the genome [32].
These four symbionts share a large fraction of their
genomic repertoires, such that the total conserved
genomic content within each functional role category
remains comparatively high (Table 2). When functional
differences between these symbionts are mapped onto a
circular representation based on the sequenced chromosomes, two large regions were found to be universally conserved across all four symbiont genomes (Figure 2,
highlighted in green). One segment, near the origin of
replication, contains nearly all of the enzymes necessary
for cytochrome (cbb3-type) biosynthesis and the CalvinBenson-Bassham cycle (transketolase, pyruvate kinase,
phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase). It also
harbors enzymes necessary for sulfur oxidation (sulfate
adenylyltransferase, APS reductase, ferredoxin) as well as
energy conservation (adenylate kinase, pyrophosphatase). The second segment, at 392,401 bp, encodes
genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, asparagines synthase), heme biosynthesis (delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, 2-amino-4hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine, pyrophosphokinase, thiamine-monophosphate kinase) and ubiquinone biosynthesis. Thus, many of the genes encoding
enzymes thought to be fundamental to the symbioses are
well conserved across four vesicomyid symbiont strains.
Based on the sequence and microarray data, a reconstruction of the minimal gene set for the vesicomyid symbionts'
last common symbiotic ancestor (LCSA) is proposed (Figure 3). Genes present in at least one of the symbiont

Below, we detail the commonalities and differences
between the symbiont genomes with regards to the chemosynthetic metabolisms thought to be important to the
symbiosis.

The chemosynthetic symbionts are autotrophic bacteria
but there is some question as to whether they are obligately autotrophs or acquire some carbon from the host.
The genomic and microarray results from these four vesicomyid symbionts suggest they all have a complete Calvin

cycle utilizing a form II RubisCO and that fixed carbon
can enter intermediary metabolism as phosphoglyceraldehyde. However, the vesicomyid symbionts intermediary
metabolism lacks alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a
condition thought to be an indicator of obligate autotrophy [46]. The lack of a sugar phosphotransferase (PTS)
system in these symbionts plus the lack of organic carbon
transporters corroborates this idea. To ameliorate the
effects of an incomplete TCA cycle, a glyoxylate bypass is
hypothesized for R. magnifica, V. sp. mt-II, and C. kilmeri
symbionts but this key enzyme (isocitrate lyase) is missing from the V. okutanii genome [33,34] making regeneration of succinate in V. okutanii inexplicable (with the
known sequence data). The V. okutanii genome is also
lacking genes for malate dehydrogenase and fumarate
reductase, suggesting significant reduction in comparison
to R. magnifica. Perhaps V. okutanii employs the single citrate transporter (found in all four symbiont genomes) to
take up TCA intermediates from the host. This putative
sugar transporter (a protein with two SLC13-permease
domains and a TrkAC domain) could theoretically function to move TCA cycle intermediates between host and
symbiont. Based on this evidence, the LCSA of the vesicomyid symbionts is predicted to have been an obligate
autotroph.
However, unlike many free-living obligate autotrophs, the
vesicomyid symbionts do not have carboxysomes, polyhedral shaped "organelles" that contain RubisCO and carbonic anhydrase [47,48]. These structures are thought to
be involved in dehydration of bicarbonate to provide carbon dioxide (CO2) to RubisCO. Although the carboxysome operon seen in other autotrophs is missing from the

symbiont genomes, all four vesicomyid symbionts encode
putative carbonic anhydrases. It may be that the host bacteriocyte environment maintains a high concentration of
CO2 limiting the need for carobxysomes (as host respiration is likely to contribute to available inorganic carbon).
As is known from the Riftia chemosynthetic symbiosis,
the host animals might actively trap carbon intracellularly
as bicarbonate, limiting the need for carboxysomes in the
vesicomyid symbionts [49]. Indeed, the vesicomyid symbionts contain a form II rubisco, the form with low affinity for CO2, known from organisms that exist in high
concentrations of carbon dioxide [13].
The LCSA for the vesicomyid symbionts is predicted to
have derived its energy for carbon dioxide fixation from
sulfur oxidation. Sulfur oxidation in all four vesicomyid
symbionts is predicted to proceed via the sox (sulfur oxidation) and dsr (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) genes.
However, the V. okutanii genome encodes dsrJNRS while
R. magnifica's does not. Because this gene is lacking from
the R. magnifica genome, it was not queried in the V. sp.
mt-II or C. kilmeri symbiont genomes. While the role of
these genes in sulfur oxidation is unclear, they are thought
to encode a triheme periplasmic cytochrome (DsrJ), a
gene for biosynthesis of siro(heme)amide (DsrN), and
cytoplasmic proteins of unknown function (DsrRS)
[50,51]. It is therefore unknown how symbiont metabolic
function might be affected by the retention of these genes.
Two distinct terminal electron acceptors (a cytochrome c
oxidase bc1 complex and a dissimilatory nitrate reductase), are predicted to have been used by the LCSA. Based
on sequence data, R. magnifica is predicted to rely exclu-

sively on oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor while V.
okutanii might use either oxygen or nitrate. The V. okutanii
genome nitrate reductase operon consists of upstream
molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis proteins (moaAD) followed by narG and H, encoding the alpha and beta subunits of nitrate reductase, narJ, the delta subunit which
inserts the molybdenum cofactor into nitrate reductase,
and narI, the gamma subunit which is a b-type cytochrome that accepts electrons from quinone to transfer to
the alpha subunit [52,53]. When we aligned the V. okuanii
and R. magnifica genomes, we found evidence of this pathway's prior existence in the R. magnifica genome. A degenerate pseudogene of the alpha subunit of V. okutanii's
nitrate reductase sharing 70/122 amino acids remained in
the analogous position in the R. magnifica genome (see

Additional file 1). This evidence suggests that the LCSA
was also capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction. The
fact that this pathway has been lost from the R. magnifica
genome is surprising, given the concentrations of nitrate
(40 μM) that exist in deep ocean waters [54].
The loss of the dissimilatory nitrate reductase in R. magnifica and retention of the pathway in V. okutanii may
reflect differences in host geochemical ecology. The C.
okutanii specimen for the V. okutanii genome project was
collected off Hatsushima Island, in the Sagami Bay seep
sites [34]. The vesicomyid hosts found at Sagami Bay keep
their feet buried deep within the silty sediment to access
sulfide and may spend the majority of their time in anoxic
conditions, where nitrate may be the more abundant oxi-

dant [55]. As the eukaryotic host must use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, perhaps the retention of the
nitrate reductase in the seep clam symbionts reflects a
means of reducing competition for oxygen between host
and symbiont. However, it is possible that the amount of
oxygen available to the symbiosis in different environments may not translate to distinct microenvironments
inside the bacteriocytes; the host hemoglobins [56,57]
may somehow buffer the symbionts against extreme
anoxic conditions. Further research on the metabolic
capabilities of the seep versus vent vesicomyids is needed
to determine if ecological differences have contributed to
the retention of the dissimilatory nitrate reductases.
A remarkable number of amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis pathways are conserved across all four chemosynthetic symbionts: 19 amino acids and 9 vitamints and
cofactors. Although the sequenced symbiont genomes
lack the gene encoding homoserine kinase (thrB), an
enzyme normally utilized in the threonine biosynthetic
pathway, there are kinases in all four genomes that could
theoretically provide this function. Similarly, only a single
cofactor biosynthesis pathway was incomplete; both
sequenced symbiont genomes lack the ubiD/X gene for
ubiquinone biosynthesis from chorismate. Because ubiquinone is required for their energy metabolism, however,
it is clear that they either must synthesize this cofactor or
obtain it from the host. Thus, the extant vesicomyid symbionts, and therefore their LCSA, are capable of providing
all the amino acids and prosthetic groups needed by the
host.
Mechanisms for nutrient transport between host and symbiont are not obvious based on the genomic data.
Although all four vesicomyid symbionts encode a sec protein export system and the sec-independent Tat system,
the use of these pathways for transport of proteins to the
host would be energetically costly for the symbiont as the
terminal sequences would be wasted with each export.
Few known transporters for sugars, amino acids, or vitamin/cofactors were found and instead the symbionts
encode ammonium permeases, nitrate/nitrite transporters, and a sulfate exporter; transport mechanisms needed
for their chemosynthetic metabolism. Of relevance to the
symbiont host interaction is an ABC transporter system
found in the R. magnifica, V. sp. mt-II and C. kilmeri symbiont genomes. This putative hemolysin transporter
(hlyDB, tolC and a calcium binding hemolysin) is missing
in V. okutanii without any trace of pseudogenes and, in
other organisms, is implicated in pathogenesis [58].
Experimental data are needed to determine what its role
may be in the vesicomyid symbionts. The lack of transporters in the sequenced genomes and the high levels of
lysozyme in Calyptogena magnifica gill tissue [59] has been
cited as evidence that the hosts are actively, intracellularly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/585

digesting their symbionts. However, many molluscs
maintain high levels of lysozyme in their gills as a protective mechanism against pathogenesis [60], and also the
reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways in these
genomes would make lysozyme-based digestion unnecessary. It may be that the host utilizes other mechanisms for
the digestion of the symbionts such as proteases or reactive oxygen species.

Conclusion
Symbiosis is a ubiquitous and important ecological strategy for bacteria and eukaryotes, allowing the partners to
inhabit environments that neither would be capable of
alone. However, for bacterial intracellular symbionts,
sequestration within a eukaryotic lineage through vertical
transmission can drastically affect symbiont genome evolution, leading to a reduction in gene content and metabolic capabilities. The vesicomyid symbionts may use a
mixed strategy for transmission with predominant vertical
transmission punctuated by occasional lateral acquisition
events [31]. These rare events may give the vesicomyid
symbionts the opportunity for recombination and horizontal gene transfer, allowing them to reacquire genes lost
through genome reduction [32]. Indeed, in contrast to
other sequenced symbiont genomes, the chemosynthetic
symbionts of vesicomyid clams have relatively large chromosomes with an extraordinary amount of encoded metabolic capability. Based on genome sizes of free-living
autotrophs (~2 Mb in size), the genome of the vesicomyid
clam symbionts is only reduced by half. Proteins shared
by all four vesicomyid symbiont genomes (which are
referred to as the core genome) include the complete
pathways necessary for chemoautotrophic metabolism.
As is clear from analyses between V. okutanii and R. magnifica, the symbionts also share a large extent of conserved
synteny. Few functional differences were detected in the
comparative genomic analysis; indeed the only difference
likely to have ramifications for the symbiont metabolism
is the ability to use nitrate as an electron acceptor. The last
common symbiotic ancestor is predicted to have been an
obligate chemoautotroph, utilizing either nitrate or oxygen for the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds.
Invertebrates are able to thrive at hydrothermal vents due
to the metabolic capabilities of their symbionts. The vesicomyids, and indeed many hosts of chemosynthetic bacteria, have evolved small guts and reduced feeding
mechanisms and rely primarily on their symbionts for carbon and other nutrients. The data presented here suggest
a tremendous degree of conserved gene content in the
vesicomyid symbiont lineage, as these symbioses date to
50–100 MYA. This great extent of host dependency may
be pressuring symbionts to retain the necessary metabolic
pathways needed by the host.

Methods
Data deposition
Microarray hybridizations can be found at the Gene
Expresion Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE13447). All
PCR primers used for validation of these microarray
results are attached in Additional file 1.
Strains
Comparative genomic analyses were conducted using the
genome sequences from the hydrothermal vent clam symbiont Ruthia magnifica (GenBank:CP000488), the cold
seep symbiont Vesicomyososious
okutanii
(GenBank:AP009247), and Thiomicrospira crunogena (GenBank:CP000109) a free-living, gamma-proteobacterial,
sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotroph. Additionally, heterologous hybridization to an R. magnifica microarray was evaluated for two additional symbionts: the symbionts of
Calyptogena kilmeri from a Monterey Bay cold seep and the
symAVII phylotype of Vesicomya sp. mt-II clams from deep
sea vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (Goffredi et al., 2003,
Stewart et al., 2008).
Isolation of genomic DNA
Three Vesicomya sp. mt-II clams were collected from a
hydrothermal vent field on the North Endeavor segment
of the Juan de Fuca ridge (47°57.4'N, 129°05.9'W) using
the submersible Alvin (dive 2413, depth 2200 m). Three
C. kilmeri clams were collected using the ROV Tiburon
(depth 970 m) from the Montery Canyon (36°46.53'N,
122°5.21'W). Symbiont-containing gills were dissected
out of the clams, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at 80°C until processed. Thawed tissue was treated with
DNase (0.8 mg/ml, 50°C for 1.5 hr with gentle agitation)
to remove host DNA from the samples. This DNase treatment was optimized and relative quantities of host and
symbiont DNA determined by slot blot hybridizations
using universal 16S (GCT GCC TCC CGT AGG AGT) and
18S (GCA ATA ACA GGT CTG TGA TGC CC) rRNA
probes. Although not quantitative, a qualitative estimate
of enrichment of symbiont DNA was achieved. Tissues
were ground in liquid nitrogen, placed in lysis buffer (20
mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme,
1% Triton X-100, 500 mM guanidine-HCl, 200 mM
NaCl) and kept at 40°C for 2 hr. After subsequent RNase
and proteinase K treatments, the samples were centrifuged
and the supernatant loaded onto a Qiagen genomic tip
column and processed according to manufacturer's
instructions.
Microarray construction
NimbleExpress Probe Arrays with probes representing all
1022 open reading frames in the Ruthia magnifica genome
were produced by Affymetrix (manufactured in the 49 format) and were synthesized with approximately 20 oligonucleotide probes (25-mers) per putative transcript and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/585

10–20 probe pairs within a probe set. For the design of the
R. magnifica arrays, we provided Affymetrix with partial
host genome sequence to further limit the probability of
host hybridization to the symbiont array. Each probe pair
contains a sequence complementary to the target
sequence (PM) and a sequence with a mismatch in position 13 (MM). The ratio of PM/MM hybridization of target sequence in each probe pair over the entire probe set
is used to call expression levels. It should be emphasized
that because R. magnifica was used as the reference strain
for array design, genes not found in its genome were not
queried in the Vesicomya sp. mt-II and C. kilmeri symbiont
genomes. Also, low hybridization to the R. magnifica features suggests that either the genes are absent in the target
sequence or are sufficiently divergent to prevent hybridization.
Microarray Hybridization
The DNA was prepared for biotin end-labeling and
hybridization by DNase treatment (0.5 U per 10 μg DNA
in 100 μl for 15 min at 25 C). After validation of fragment
sizes (50–100 bp) via gel electrophoresis, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and labeled for one hour using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase and biotin-ddUTP
(Enzo BioArray). The reactions were used directly for
Affymetrix hybridization. Labeled gDNA targets were
hybridized to these arrays using the ProkGE_WS2v3 fluidics protocol on the GeneChip 400 Fluidics Station
(Affymetrix, Inc). Hybridization cocktails were assembled
using the GeneChip reagents and contained 100 μl of 2×
hybridization mix, 2.5 μl of oligo B2, 10 μl of 20× controls and 6 μg of labeled target. As positive controls, Bacillus subtilus DNA clones were spiked into our cocktails.
Each experiment (Vesicomya sp. mt-II symbiont, C. kilmeri
symbiont) was performed in triplicate with at least 2 biological replicates (two distinct clam individuals).
Microarray Data Analysis
Hybridization intensity data were extracted from the array
images and scaled universally across all experiments and
normalized using Resolver microarray software (Rosetta
Syllego). Values derived from the hybridization of R. magnifica gDNA to the arrays were used as a baseline for the
genomic analyses. Absence/presence of the R. magnifica
homologs in C. kilmeri and Vesicomya sp. mt-II were determined by comparing hybridization signals between the
baseline and the two strains. Probe sets with a ratio of
>0.25 were considered present, and those with a ratio of
<0.25 were considered absent or excessively divergent.
Verification of the microarray hybridization thresholds
The use of these hybridization intensity thresholds was
validated using PCR and slot blot nucleotide hybridizations. We randomly chose 20 genes, and primers were
designed (see Additional file 1) based on the R. magnifica

and V. okutanii genomes and bands were generated (data
not shown). Five genes called as "absent/divergent" were
also targeted for amplification but could not be amplified
(data not shown). We also selectively targeted the polysaccharide biosynthesis region from R. magnifica (absent in
V. okutanii and V. sp. mt-II symbiont) using slot blot
hybridizations. A probe was designed to target the o-antigen polymerase gene from R. magnifica for hybridization
against V. sp. mt-II and C. kilmeri symbiont gDNA. R. magnifica, V. sp. mt-II symbiont, and C. kilmeri symbiont
whole genomic DNA extracts were denatured (0.4 M
NaOH, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mins at 100°C) before loading
onto the Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Biorad)
and Zeta-probe mebrane (Biorad). After applying vacuum, the membrane was washed in 2 × SSC and DNA was
crosslinked using the UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene).
After prehybridization at 30°C with ExpressHyb
(Clonetech) hybridization buffer, radioactively (γ-32PddATP) end-labeled 300 bp fragements (T4 PNK) were
hybridized to the membrane overnight at 42°C. The
membranes were then washed at 25°C three times in 50
mL of 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS
before exposing film for 2 hours and subsequent development.
Bioinformatics
To find putative orthologous proteins between the
sequenced genomes, the program RSD (Reciprocal Smallest Distance algorithm) [61] was used to compare the R.
magnifica genome to that of the V. okutanii genome. A 1e3 cutoff for the significance threshold and an alignment
length threshold of 80% were used which yielded a total
of 858 conserved orthologous proteins. We then used
reciprocal BLAST to identify another 28 orthologous proteins. The MUMmer 3 software package [62] was used for
analysis of synteny and the BLAST program [63] was used
to indentify percent identity and similarity between the
conserved proteins.
