next-generation biofuels

Abstract
Background: Biodiesel or ethanol derived from lipids or starch produced by microalgae may overcome many of
the sustainability challenges previously ascribed to petroleum-based fuels and first generation plant-based biofuels.
The paucity of microalgae genome sequences, however, limits gene-based biofuel feedstock optimization studies.
Here we describe the sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for the non-model microalgae species,
Dunaliella tertiolecta, and identify pathways and genes of importance related to biofuel production.
Results: Next generation DNA pyrosequencing technology applied to D. tertiolecta transcripts produced 1,363,336
high quality reads with an average length of 400 bases. Following quality and size trimming, ~ 45% of the high
quality reads were assembled into 33,307 isotigs with a 31-fold coverage and 376,482 singletons. Assembled
sequences and singletons were subjected to BLAST similarity searches and annotated with Gene Ontology (GO)
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO) identifiers. These analyses identified the
majority of lipid and starch biosynthesis and catabolism pathways in D. tertiolecta.
Conclusions: The construction of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of fatty acids,
triacylglycrols, and starch in D. tertiolecta as well as the assembled transcriptome provide a foundation for the
molecular genetics and functional genomics required to direct metabolic engineering efforts that seek to enhance
the quantity and character of microalgae-based biofuel feedstock.

Background
Global demand for petroleum as a transportation and
heating fuel is predicted to increase 40% by 2025 [1].
Liquid biofuels from plants and microalgae feedstock
represent a renewable sustainable alternative to petroleum energy when greenhouse gases released during the
combustion of these biofuels are partially neutralized by
the carbon dioxide required for their growth. The
greatly minimized acreage estimates, high lipid or starch
content, and biomass production rates that surpass
those of terrestrial plants suggest that biodiesel or ethanol derived from lipids or starch produced by microalgae may circumvent many of the limitations ascribed to

petroleum fuel and first generation plant-based biofuels
[2-7]. The most commonly stated paradigm for producing biodiesel from microalgae is to grow these microorganisms in open pond or closed reactor systems, extract
the lipids or starch, and transform them into biodiesel
by transesterification or ethanol by fermentation,
respectively.
Unlike ethanol or other plant biofuels, technology to
economically grow microalgae with high lipid or starch
content is in the early stages of development [2]. Economic viability and environmental sustainability require
the optimization of characteristic microalgae strains and
ecologies in order to increase the per cell enrichment of
lipids or starch and to improve fuel production and performance properties [6]. An in-depth knowledge of
microalgae genomics precludes these necessary increases
in biological efficiency. Numerous studies concerning

the effects of stress conditions on lipid and starch contents of microalgae have been documented in the literature [8-14]. However, an understanding of how
microalgae respond to physiological stress at molecular
level is largely limited to model organisms [15,16], and
the relevant pathways in microalgae have not been fully
documented [17]. Although transcribed gene and pathway information is requisite for planning and introducing stable and successful genetic manipulations in
these microalgae, these efforts have been hampered by
the lack of sequenced genomes of biofuel relevant
microalgae. Due to the large efforts that are required to
sequence these medium size (~100 mb) eukaryotic genomes, only seven microalgae genomes have been completed as of 2010 [7]. Alternatively, transcriptome
sequencing can be a more efficient approach for obtaining microalgae functional genomics information. Transcriptome sequencing targets only coding DNA and this
reduced sequencing requirement coupled with the
rapidly evolving next-generation sequencing methods
can result in high transcriptome coverage depth and
facilitates the de novo assembly of transcriptomes from
species where full genomes do not exist [18-21]. The
more rapid and economic creation of these transcriptomes enables researchers to focus on organisms of
direct biofuels interest and reduce the reliance on model
organisms [19].
The objectives of this study are to discover genes that
encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of biofuel
precursors in the microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta and to
describe the relevant metabolic pathways. D. tertiolecta is
a flagellated unicellular marine microalga belonging to
the Chlorophyta phylum. The rational for selecting D.
tertiolecta as a non-model organism in this study lies in
its ability to produce large quantities of lipids and starch
(up to 67% and 27% of organism dry weight, respectively), rapid growth rate in hyper saline environments
which aids in maintenance of pure cultures, and lack of a
rigid cell wall which eases product extraction and genetic
manipulation [22-27]. These unique physiological and
structural traits gives D. tertiolecta considerable advantages over model organisms such Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as feedstock for biofuel production.
D. tertiolecta was cultured under nitrogen- and osmotic-inducing stress conditions and total RNA was
extracted from cells during log and stationary growth
phases. Libraries of cDNA constructed from total RNA
were normalized and sequenced using the 454 GS FLX
platform with Titanium chemistry. The transcriptome
was assembled using the pool of sequencing data
obtained from all cDNA libraries, and resulting individual transcripts (isotigs) and singletons were annotated.
Sequences were screened to identify enzymes-encoding
genes present, and relevant lipid and starch pathways

were reconstructed. Results demonstrate the capability
of using transcriptome data from next-generation
sequencing to identify pathways of interest and potential
targets for metabolic engineering in microalgae, and
enable functional genomics studies on a non-model species relevant for the production of next-generation
biofuel.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing and de novo assembly of the transcriptome

To identify genes and reconstruct the metabolic pathways involved in the production of biofuel precursors in
D. tertiolecta, pure cultures were grown under nitrogen
rich and nitrogen depleted conditions, and high salt
concentrations. Cells were harvested in the log and stationary growth phases. These conditions are known to
influence the production and accumulation of lipids and
starch in microalgae [23,28-30], and were therefore used
to increase the expression and maximize the diversity of
genes related to these processes. Responses for nitrogen
deprivation resulted in starch concentration doubling to
over 25% of the cell dry weight with no increase in lipid
content. The elevated salt concentration did not affect
the starch content of nitrogen sufficient cells harvested
during the stationary phase, but resulted in 22% increase
in the total lipid content of the cells. Harvesting of
microalgae in the exponential growth phase resulted in
a near doubling of the lipid content to greater than 35%
of the cell dry weight versus the stationary phase. The
normalized cDNA libraries of cells grown under the
above conditions were pooled and sequenced using the
454 GS FLX Titanium, and the D. tertiolecta transcriptome was assembled from the resulting sequencing
reads.
Sequencing of cDNA libraries generated a total
1,385,389 raw reads, with an average length of 410 bp.
The size distribution of raw reads is shown in
Figure 1A, and a summary of sequencing and assembly
results are presented in Table 1 and Additional file 1.
After trimming for the adaptors and primer sequences,
20,036 sequences were removed due to their short
length, low complexity, and overall low quality scores.
This pre-assembly cleaning and trimming step resulted
in 1,365,353 high quality (HQ) reads, with an average
length of 400 bp, corresponding to 98.5% of the original
raw sequences.
Trimmed and cleaned sequences were assembled
using the cDNA assembly feature of Newbler software
v.2.3. (Roche, IN, USA). A total of 609,149 HQ reads
were assembled into 34,301 contiguous sequences (contigs), and 376,482 reads were identified as singletons
(i.e., reads not assembled into contigs). The size of contigs ranged from 86 to 4,258 bp, with an average length
of 377 Â± 227 bp. The sequencing coverage ranged from

1 to 653 with an average of 31. The distribution of contigs size and coverage are shown in Figures 1B and 1C,
respectively. Contiguous sequences were further
assembled into 33,307 isotigs. Isotigs are the putative
transcripts constructed using the overlapping contig
reads provided as input to the Newbler cDNA assembler. The size distribution of isotigs which ranged from
101 to over 4,941 bp, with an average length of 532 Â±
263 bp, are shown in Figure 1D. More than 95% of the
isotigs were between 101 to 1000 bp long and 50% of
the assembled bases were incorporated into isotigs
greater than 552 bp (N50 = 552 bp). The coverage
depth for isotigs ranged from 1 to 14, with an average
of 2.1 contigs assembled into each isotig. The isotigs
and singletons together resulted in 409,789 unique
sequences.
Functional annotation

All unique sequences were aligned against the sequences
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) non-redundant (nr) protein database using the
BLASTx algorithm. Using an E-value threshold of 10-6,
a total of 8,466 isotigs (25% of total isotigs), and 15,888
singleton sequences (4% of total singletons) had significant BLAST matches (Table 2). The frequency of annotated isotigs is consistent with the 20 to 40% values

previously reported for de novo transcriptome assemblies of eukaryotes [20,21,31,32]. Sequences that did not
have BLASTx matches but met quality control may still
have biological significance and may be important in
future, directed studies on D. tertiolecta metabolism. In
total, 24,354 unique sequences were identified through
BLAST searches. Analysis of BLAST matches demonstrated a distinct microalgae character of the transcribed
genes. The top-hit species distribution of BLAST
matches is shown in Figure 2. Approximately 60% of the
sequences had significant matches with closely related
microalgae species, predominantly Volvox carteri and
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A phylogenetic tree inferring the evolutionary relationship between D. tertiolecta
and these organisms is presented in the Additional file
2. C. reinhardtii is a model microalga with a sequenced
genome and has been the focus of most physiological,
molecular, and genetic studies in microalgae. V. carteri
is a multicellular alga and a draft genome sequence has
been completed for this organism. BLAST search also
identified 13% of the sequences as being similar with
the marine algicidal bacterium Kordia algicida, and the
remaining 27% were related to plant species and other
marine microalgae and bacteria. The similarity of
BLAST results with Kordia algicida indicates that this
microorganism might share some genetic information

To reconstruct the metabolic pathways involved in D.
tertiolecta, annotated sequences were mapped to the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
using the Blast2Go platform [35]. We identified transcripts coding for all enzymes related to the major metabolic pathways in D. tertiolecta (Table 3). The
completeness of these reconstructed pathways indicates
that the gene function assignments were biologically
meaningful and that the EC numbers have been correctly assigned to annotated sequences. Comparative
analysis of enzyme-coding sequences between D. tertiolecta and model organisms, Volvox carteri, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, using BLASTx analysis revealed
relatively low homology between D. tertiolecta and these
organisms for the enzymes described in this study
(Table 4, 5, 6). These differences indicate that functional
genomics and metabolic engineering of D. tertiolecta
cannot be fully based on the sequence information
obtained from model organisms, and further demonstrates the importance of annotated D. tertiolecta transcriptome as a genetic framework required for carrying
out such studies. Because of their relevance to production of precursors for biofuel production, the metabolic
pathways associated with biosynthesis and catabolism of
lipids and starch were given further treatment below. A

distinct microalgae character of the transcribed genes.

microalgae is required to direct efforts to enhance the
microalgae-biofuel production and produce the fuel
characteristics needed for commercialization.
Fatty acid biosynthesis

Interest in microalgae as a potential feedstock for the
production of biofuels and other valuable biomaterials is
rooted in their ability to rapidly accumulate significant
amounts of neutral lipids [36]. Under optimal conditions, microalgae synthesize fatty acids primarily for
esterification into polar glycerol-based membrane lipids
that consist of glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides,
whereas under environmental stress conditions, many
microalgae accumulate neutral triacylglycrols (TAGs)
[17]. Although global fatty acid biosynthesis pathways
are known in eukaryotes [37], biosynthesis and regulation of fatty acids in microalgae are not well studied.
Based on the functional annotation of the transcriptome, we have successfully identified the genes encoding
for key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of fatty acids in D. tertiolecta. Table 4 lists the

enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in D. tertiolecta. On average, four transcripts were identified per
enzyme. The reconstructed pathway based on these
identified enzymes is depicted in Figure 4. The fatty
acid biosynthesis pathway in microalgae primarily occurs
in the chloroplast, and produces saturated C16:0 (palmitic acid) and C18:0-ACP (acyl carrier protein). These
fatty acids can then be used as precursors for the synthesis of neutral lipids (mainly TAGs). Fatty acid biosynthesis in D. tertiolecta starts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC, EC: 6.4.1.2), which catalyzes the formation of
malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and bicarbonate. Next,
malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase (MAT, EC: 2.3.1.39) catalyzes the transfer of malonyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP, the
carbon donor for subsequent elongation reactions. During the elongation, the malonyl group of malonyl-ACP
participates in a series of condensation reactions with
acyl ACP (or acetyl-CoA) acceptors that are catalyzed
by the multiple isoforms of the condensing enzyme,
ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) (Table 4). The first condensation reaction is catalyzed by beta-ketoacyl-ACP

synthase III (KAS III, EC: 2.3.1.180) and results in a
four-carbon product. The other condensing enzyme,
beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS I, EC: 2.3.1.41), produces varying chain lengths (6 to 16 carbons). Finally,
beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KASII, EC: 2.3.1.179) is
responsible for the elongation of C16:0-ACP to C18:0ACP. The initial product of each condensation reaction
is a beta-ketoacyl-ACP. Three additional reactions

(reduction, dehydration, and another reduction) occur
after each condensation. To form a saturated fatty acid,
the beta-ketoacyl ACP product is reduced by the
enzyme beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KAR, EC:
1.1.1.100), dehydrated by 3R-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (HAD, EC: 4.2.1.-), and then reduced by enoylACP reductase (EAR, EC: 1.3.1.9). These four reactions
lead to a lengthening of the precursor fatty acid by two

carbons for every round of cycle. To produce 16 or 18
carbon fatty acids, this cycle is repeated for 6 or 7 times
respectively (Figure 4).
For the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in plastid,
a double bond is introduced to the acyl group esterified
to ACP via the enzyme acyl-ACP desaturase (AAD, EC:
1.14.19.2). The elongation of fatty acids in the chloroplast is terminated when the acyl group is removed
from ACP by acyl-ACP thioesterase enzymes, oleoylACP hydrolase (OAT, EC: 3.1.2.14), or when acyl-ACP
thioesterase A (FatA) hydrolyze the acyl-ACP and
releases the free fatty acid, or when acyl transferases in
the chloroplast transfers the fatty acid directly from
ACP to glycerol-3-phosphate or monoacylglycerol-3phosphate. The final fatty acid composition is determined by the activities of enzymes that use these
acyl-ACPs at the termination phase of fatty acid synthesis. We have also identified desaturation enzymes
Î12(Ï6)-desaturase (Î12D, EC: 1.4.19.6), which desaturates oleic acid (18:1n-9) to form linoleic acid (18:2n-6),
and Î 15 (Ï 3 )-desaturase (Î 15 D, EC: 1.4.19.-), which
further desaturates linoleic acid to form a-linolenic acid
(18:3n-3). The annotation of D. tertiolecta transcriptome
did not identify any genes encoding enzymes involved in
further desaturation and elongation of linoleic and linolenic acids that could result in production of longer
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The lack of identification of these enzymes is consistent with the profile of
fatty acids produced by D. tertiolecta [38,39].
In addition to synthesis, all the enzymes involved in
fatty acid catabolism (b-oxidation pathway) of D. tertiolecta were successfully identified and are presented in
Table 4 (coded by six transcripts on average). The fatty
acid catabolism pathway is provided in Additional file 4.
The b-oxidation pathway in microalgae involves four
enzymes: acyl-coA oxidase (AOx, EC: 1.3.3.6); enoylCoA hydratase (ECH, EC: 4.2.1.17); 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase (CHAD, EC: 1.1.1.35); and acetyl-CoA
acyltransferase (ACAT, EC: 2.3.1.16), which collectively
catalyze the cleavage of two carbons from the acyl chain

during each cycle. The resulting acetyl-CoA is then used
to produce energy for the cell via the citrate cycle.
The D. tertiolecta transcriptome presented here contains most of the enzymes required for the biosynthesis,
elongation, and metabolism of fatty acids (Table 4), and
the subsequent reconstructed pathways are consistent
with those proposed for model microalgae C. reinhardtii
[17], and plants in general [37,40-42]. These findings
contribute to the biochemical and molecular information needed for metabolic engineering of fatty acid
synthesis in microalgae. The most commonly stated
strategy is the overexpression of ACC, the rate-limiting
step in fatty-acid biosynthesis [43]. The condensing
enzymes that are identified in this study are also potential targets for improving fatty acid biosynthesis. For
example, Verwoert et al. has shown that the overexpression of KAS III in Brassica seeds alter the composition of fatty acids but does not change the per cell
quantity [44]. A final example approach for per cell fatty
acid enrichment in microalgae is to block lipid catabolism [45], which could then result in increased lipid
storage.
Triacylglycerols (TAG) biosynthesis and catabolism

Some species of microalgae are capable of producing
and accumulating high amounts of neutral storage
lipids, mainly TAGs, under stress-inducing conditions.
TAGs can serve as precursors for production of biodiesel and other bio-based products such as plastics, cosmetics, and surfactants [36]. Although the global
pathways for TAG biosynthesis are known, the existing
knowledge on the pathways and enzymes involved in
TAG synthesis in microalgae is limited [46,47]. Based
on the KEGG pathway assignment of the functionally
annotated sequences, transcripts coding for most of the
enzymes involved in TAG biosynthesis were found in
D. tertiolecta. These enzymes are presented in Table 5,
and the suggested pathway for TAG synthesis in D. tertiolecta is shown in Figure 5. The precursors for TAG
biosynthesis are glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), and acylCoA. G-3-P is produced by the catabolism of glucose
(glycolysis) or to a lesser extent by the action of the
enzyme glycerol kinase (GK, EC: 2.7.1.30) on free glycerol. We identified 16 transcripts in D. tertiolecta transcriptome library coding for this enzyme. The acyl-CoA,
on the other hand, is generated via esterification of fatty
acids produced in the chloroplast to coenzyme A. The
first two steps of TAG biosynthesis involve sequential
esterification of acyl chains from acyl-CoA to positions
1 and 2 of G-3-P, resulting in the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA), which is a key intermediate in the
biosynthesis of all glycerolipids. These steps are catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (GPAT,
EC: 2.3.1.15) and 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate

O-acyltransferase (AGPAT, EC: 2.3.1.51), respectively.
Genes encoding for AGPAT were identified in the D.
tertiolecta transcriptome library, however, genes encoding for GPAT were not identified. The next reaction in
the pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidate
phosphatase (PP, EC: 3.1.3.4), which removes the phosphate group from PA and produces the diacylglycerol
(DAG). One transcript was annotated as coding for this
enzyme in the D. tertiolecta transcriptome library. The
DAG is an essential intermediate in the biosynthesis of
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE). Finally, the resultant DAG is acylated, at the position 3 using an acyl donor to form the TAG. We identified transcripts coding for two distinct enzymes that
catalyze this reaction. These enzymes differ in their
source of acyl-donor. The first enzyme is diacylglycerol
O-acyltransferase (DGAT, EC: 2.3.1.20), which uses acyl-

CoA as an acyl-donor and is believed to be the main
pathway for biosynthesis of TAG [17,48]. The second
enzyme is phopholipid:diacyglycerol acyltransferase
(PDAT, EC: 2.3.1.158), and uses phospholipids as acyl
donors. This acyl-CoA independent route for TAG biosynthesis had been previously reported in some plants
and yeast [49], and the gene encoding for PDAT has
been identified in the sequenced genome of C. reinhardtii [46]. Identification of PDAT in D. tertiolecta provides
further evidence that some microalgae might have the
potential to channel the fatty acids incorporated in
membrane lipids (e.g. PC), into the TAG synthesis. The
identification of this alternative route for the flux of
fatty acids into and out of TAG synthesis can also provide insight into the connection between rapid degradation of membrane lipids with concurrent accumulation
of TAGs when microalgae are exposed to stress

conditions [17]. The functional importance of PDAT in
TAG biosynthesis, however, remains to be determined
via gene-knockout experiments and analysis of lipid
profiles.
Additionally, we identified transcripts coding for
enzymes related to catabolism of TAG. The complete
breakdown of TAG takes place in two stages. First,
hydrolysis of ester bonds that link fatty acyl chains to the
glycerol backbone is catalyzed by lipases. We found two
transcripts in the D. tertiolecta transcriptome coding for
triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL, EC: 3.1.1.3), which releases
fatty acids from DAG and TAG. In the second stage, the
fatty acids that are liberated may be further broken down
by oxidation or follow other metabolic pathways including re-esterification with glycerol to from new acylglycerols [42]. Suppression of enzymes involved in TAG
degradation, such as TAGL, could potentially increase
the TAG content. Though this approach has previously
resulted in elevated levels of TAG in transgenic plants, it
severely limits plant growth [50]. Another potential

approach includes manipulation of acyltransferases
enzymes, as they are the key determinant of content and
acyl composition of glycerolipids [51-54]. Identification
of transcripts coding for these enzymes in D. tertiolecta
provide the first step for attempts to genetically engineer
this organism to increase the production and modify the
composition of the lipids [45,46].
Starch biosynthesis and catabolism

As the main assimilatory product of photosynthesis,
some species of microalgae synthesize a significant
amount of starch as storage materials in their plastids
[29,55]. The accumulated starch is an attractive substrate for the production of a variety of biofuels, including ethanol, butanol, and hydrogen [56-59]. Production
of biofuel from microalgae-based starch potentially overcomes the sustainability and pretreatment process disadvantages ascribed to using plant-based starch and
lignocellulosic materials as ethanol feedstock [57,60].

degradation of starch are well studied in plants and the
model microalgae C. reinhardtii, such knowledge is
scarce in non-model microalgae with direct biofuel
potentials.
Based on the KEGG pathway assignments, we identified numerous transcripts coding for enzymes involved
in the biosynthesis and catabolism of starch in D. tertiolecta (Table 6). The pathway of starch synthesis in
D. tertiolecta involves the enzymes phosphoglucomutase
(PGM, EC: 5.4.2.2), which generates glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) from glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P),
and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase, EC:

2.7.7.27), which uses Glc-1-P and ATP to generate
ADPGlc and inorganic pyrophosphate. ADPGlc is the
substrate for starch synthase (SS, EC: 2.4.1.21), which
generates ADP and an amylose, a linear chain of glucose
residues connected by a-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The final
step in the pathway involves a-1,4-glucan branching
enzyme (BE, EC: 2.4.1.18), which catalyzes the formation
of a-1,6-glycosidic bonds in the elongated glucans that
comprise starch. Based on the identified enzymes from
the retrieved transcripts, biosynthesis of starch from
Glc-6-P in D. tertiolecta resembles the classical pathway
of starch synthesis proposed in plants and C. reinhardtii

Rismani-Yazdi et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/148

[61]. We also identified transcripts that code for sucrose
phosphorylase (SuPase, EC: 2.4.7.1), which generates G1-P from sucrose as an alternative source of substrate
for starch synthesis. This alternative pathway is consistent with the newly proposed model for starch synthesis
in Arabidopsis [62]. Experimental research (e.g. gene
knock-out analysis), however, is required to support the
role of SuPase in starch biosynthesis in D. tertiolecta.
Figure 6 shows the reconstructed pathway for biosynthesis of starch in D. tertiolecta. Although our results do
not allow speculation on the cellular location of starch
biosynthesis in D. tertiolecta, previous studies on D.
marina starch pathway suggest that it is exclusively
intraplastidic [63], which is consistent with starch synthesis and storage in the Cryptophyceae class of microalgae [64].
The starch biosynthesis pathway was well represented
in our library as indicated by the number of transcripts
assigned to each enzyme (on average 9 transcripts per
enzyme). All of known enzymes in the starch synthesis
pathway presented were identified (Table 6). Genetic

manipulation of key enzymes, mainly AGPase and to
less extent SS, involved in the process has been tried to
increase starch contents in crop plants. Much of the
efforts have been focused on AGPase as this enzyme
catalyses a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of
starch, and thus increase in its activity could lead to
increased rate of starch synthesis [65].
The starch accumulated in green microalgae is considered to be mostly utilized in the respiration. We identified two distinct pathways, namely hydrolytic and
phosphorolytic, involved in starch catabolism in D. tertiolecta (Figure 6). Twenty transcripts in our library
were annotated as coding for enzymes involved in these
pathways (Table 6). The enzymes related to the hydrolytic pathway include a-amylase (a-AMY, EC: 3.2.1.1),
and oligo-1,6-glucosidase (O1, 6G, EC: 3.2.1.10). These
two enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of starch to oligosaccharides (i.e. dextrin) and further to a-D-glucose,
respectively. The released a-D-glucose maybe further
degraded through glycolysis or be phosphorylated by
hexokinase (HXK, 2.7.1.1), for reentry into the starch

Figure 6 Starch biosynthesis and catabolism, and ethanol fermentation pathways reconstructed based on the de novo assembly and
annotation of D. tertiolecta transcriptome. Identified and unidentified enzymes are shown in solid and dashed boxes, respectively. Enzymes
involved in starch biosynthesis include: PGM, phosphoglucomutase (EC: 5.4.2.2); SuPase, sucrose phosphorylase (EC: 2.4.7.1); AGPase, ADP-glucose
pyrophosphorylase (EC: 2.7.7.27); SS, starch synthase (EC: 2.4.1.21); BE, a-1,4-glucan branching enzyme (EC: 2.4.1.18); and HXK, hexokinase (2.7.1.1).
Enzymes involved in starch catabolism include: a-AMY, a-amylase (EC: 3.2.1.1); O1, 6G, oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC: 3.2.1.10); b-AMY, b-amylase (EC:
3.2.1.2); and SPase, starch phosphorylase (EC: 2.4.1.1). Enzymes involved in ethanol fermentation via pyruvate include: PDC, pyruvate
decarboxylase (EC: 4.1.1.1); and ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.1). Enzyme PDHC, Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.1, 2.3.1.12,
1.8.4.1), transforms pyruvate into acetyl-CoA which may then be used in the lipid biosynthesis pathway. Key enzymes are shown with an asterisk
next to the boxes, and dashed arrows denote reaction(s) in which the enzymes are not shown.

synthesis pathway. We did not identify transcripts that
code for b-amylase (b-AMY, EC: 3.2.1.2), which
degrades starch into maltose. The phosphorolytic degradation of starch in D. tertiolecta may involve starch
phosphorylase (SPase, EC: 2.4.1.1), which mediates the
transfer of glucose from the non-reducing end of an
a-1,4-linked glucan to orthophosphate and generates
G-1-P and a shorter glucan. Further investigations are
warranted to determine the relative importance of these
pathways in D. tertiolecta.
Pathways interactions, carbon partitioning and sourcesink relationships

The metabolic pathways associated with biosynthesis
and degradation of energy-rich molecules are closely
linked. Starch catabolism provides the metabolites for
biosynthesis of other energy rich products. Our KEGG
pathway assignments revealed that D. tertiolecta has the
genetic potential to link starch metabolism to ethanol
fermentation through the glycolysis pathway (Figure 6)
(Also see Additional files 5 and 6 for the pathway map
and the complete set of identified enzymes involved in
glycolysis, respectively). We identified transcripts coding
for enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of ethanol from
the intermediate metabolite, pyruvate in D. tertiolecta.
These enzymes include pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC,
EC: 4.1.1.1), which generates acetaldehyde and CO 2
from pyruvate, and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC:
1.1.1.1), which uses acetaldehyde and NADH + H + to
generate ethanol. Although ethanol production has been
previously observed in marine microalgae [66], no
reports exist in D. tertiolecta and existence of ethanol
fermentation pathway raises the potential that this
organism could be engineered to be an efficient converter of solar energy into ethanol.
Additionally, biosynthesis of starch can direct the flow
of metabolites away from lipid biosynthesis and conversely starch degradation provides the metabolites for production of energy rich molecules (i.e, lipids, and
ethanol). We identified 20 transcripts that code for a
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) (EC: 1.2.4.1,
2.3.1.12, 1.8.1.4) that transforms pyruvate into acetylCoA through pyruvate decarboxylation. Acetyl-CoA may
then be used in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. A
blockage of starch synthesis has been shown to increase
the accumulation of lipids in several starchless mutants
of microalgae [30,67]. Disruption of genes related to
starch degradation or over expression of genes involved
in starch synthesis have successfully resulted in
increased starch content in microalgae and Arabidopsis
thaliana [45,65].
Concerted production and accumulation of energy
rich molecule in microalgae also depends upon the integration of precursor supplying pathways (i.e. sources)

Page 13 of 17

with synthesizing machineries (i.e. sinks). The accumulation of large quantities of lipids in microalgae requires a
continuous supply of acetyl-CoA and NADPH. The
pathways supplying these precursors lie outside of the
fatty acid synthetic machinery, and it has been suggested
that they are unique to oleaginous microorganisms [68].
The key supplier of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis
in oleaginous microorganisms is considered to be ATP:
citrate lyase (ACL, EC: 2.3.3.8), which catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by cleaving
citrate using an ATP molecule [68]. The formation of
NADPH as an essential reductant for fatty acid synthesis
has been mainly attributed to malate dehydrogenase
(MDH, EC: 1.1.1.40), which uses malate and NADP+ to
generate pyruvate, CO2 and NADPH [68]. Citrate and
malate are intermediates of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle and pyruvate metabolism, respectively. Interestingly, we identified numerous sequences, 76 and 11, in
our transcriptome library coding for ACL and MDH,
respectively. The integration of these enzymes with fatty
acid biosynthesizing machinery ensures the direct flow
of acetyl-CoA into fatty acids, which are then used as
precursors of TAG synthesis. Genetic manipulations
that increase the availability of precursors for fatty acid
and starch synthesis, through up-regulation/over-expression of related genes identified here, could be promising
approaches to increase the yield of biofuel precursors in
microalgae.

Conclusions
This study presents the first next-generation sequencing
effort and transcriptome annotation of a non-model
marine microalgae that is relevant for biofuel production. Genes encoding key enzymes have been successfully identified and metabolic pathways involved in
biosynthesis and catabolism of fatty acids, TAG, and
starch in D. tertiolecta have been reconstructed. Identification of these genes and pathways is in agreement with
the empirically observed capability of D. tertiolecta to
synthesize and accumulate energy rich molecules, and
adds to the current knowledge on the molecular biology
and biochemistry of their production in microalgae. By
providing insight into the mechanisms underpinning
these metabolic processes, results can be used to direct
efforts to genetically manipulate this organism to
enhance the production of feedstock for commercial
microalgae-biofuels.
The accumulation of biofuel precursors and discovery
of genes associated with their biosynthesis and metabolism in D. tertiolecta is intriguing and worthy of further
investigation. The sequences and pathways produced
here present the genetic framework required for further
studies. Quantitative transcriptomics in concert with
physiological and biochemical analysis in D. tertiolecta

under conditions that stimulate production and accumulation of biofuel precursors are needed to provide
insight into the ways these pathways are regulated and
linked.

Methods
D. tertiolecta culturing, harvesting and RNA extraction

D. tertiolecta (UTEX LB 999) was obtained from the
Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas.
Cells were cultured in 1 L flasks filled with 750 ml of
Erdschreiberâs medium (UTEX), modified to have different concentrations of nitrogen and salinity. Reactors
were operated at room temperature in batch mode and
exposed to fluorescent light (32 Watts, Cool White) at a
photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 135 Î¼molphoton m-2 s-1, with a 14/10 h light/dark cycle. Gas flow
rate was 200 ml min-1 of house air and controlled using
a mass flow controller (Cole-Parmer Instrument Company, IL, USA). The air stream was passed over activated carbon and filtered through a 0.2 Î¼m filter before
being flushed into the reactors. All cultures were mixed
by an orbital shaker at 200 rpm.
Cells were cultured under various growth conditions
and at different phases of the growth cycle. These various growth conditions and phases were chosen to stimulate production and accumulation of lipids or starch,
to induce expression of genes involved with lipids or
starch biosynthesis, and to maximize the diversity of
expressed genes [23,28-30,69]. The growth conditions
included: nitrogen limited cultures (10 mg L-1, N) with
salinity levels similar to that of seawater (i.e. 0.5 M
NaCl) harvested during stationary phase (sample A),
nitrogen sufficient cultures (100 mg L-1, N) with salinity
of 0.5 M NaCl, harvested during exponential growth
(sample B), and stationary (samples C) phases, and saltstressed cultures (100 mg L-1, N) with elevated salt concentration (1.5 M NaCl) harvested during the stationary
phase (sample D). Cell growth was monitored in duplicate reactors under each condition by measuring the
changes of optical density in the culture medium at 730
nm (OD730), using a spectrophotometer (HP 8453, Hewlett Packard, CA, USA). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (RC-6 Plus, ThermoScientific, DE, USA), at
17,000 g, for 5 min, at 4Â°C. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C until further analysis.
Total RNA from cells was extracted and purified using
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) with the following modifications for cell lysis. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer RLT (1 Ã 105 cells Î¼l-1), transferred
to a 2-ml screw cap tube containing 300 mg of glass
beads (0.5 mm, baked at 500Â°C for 4 h), and lysed and
homogenized by agitation in a bead-beater (Mini-Beadbeater-16, BioSpec Products, OK, USA) at the maximum

Page 14 of 17

speed (3450 oscillations/min) for 40 s. Bead-beating was
repeated four times for each sample. The residual genomic DNA contamination was removed during the RNA
cleanup using the optional on-column DNase I digestion
as instructed by the manufacturer (Qiagen, CA, USA).
The integrity of the purified total RNA was assessed
using formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, and
RNA quantity was determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometer measurements (ThermoScientific, DE, USA).
Because microalgae have high levels of pigments, polysaccharides, and glycolproteins that could interfere with
cDNA synthesis and are difficult to remove using spincolumn purification methods, total RNA was further
purified using lithium-chloride precipitation as previously described [21].
Synthesis of cDNA and library construction

Synthesis of full-length double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) from total RNA was performed using SMARTer
PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, with the exception of using a modified CDS primer (5â-AAGCAGTG
GTATCAACGCAGAGTACGTGCAGTT TTTTTTTT
TTTTTTVN-3â). This modified primer included a
recognition site (GTGCAG), on the 5â end of the poly T
tail for restriction enzyme BsgI. This restriction site was
then used to eliminate the presence of poly (A:T) tail in
the cDNA samples. These homopolymers could result
in too strong of a light signal and thus produce sequencing reads of low quality when using the Genome
Sequencer FLX with Titanium reagents.
Full-length cDNA templates were then amplified by
long-distance PCR using the Advantage 2 PCR Kit
(Clontech, CA, USA). To ensure that the PCR products
were not over amplified, the optimal number of PCR
cycles was determined according to manufacturerâs
guidelines. The PCR reactions were then chased [70] to
maximize the quantities of fully double-stranded cDNA
products and quality was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Replicate PCR reactions were performed for
each library then pooled and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). The
amplified cDNA libraries were quantified using NanoDrop (ThermoScientific, DE, USA), and equal amounts
of PCR products from sample libraries B, C, and D were
pooled to construct a new library âPâ which was used
along with library A for normalization.
To enhance gene discovery, the proportion of transcripts (i.e. expressed genes) that are highly abundant in
the sample were reduced before sequencing. Equal
amount of samples (1.6 Î¼g) from cDNA libraries A and
P were normalized using the Trimmer cDNA Normalization Kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia), and re-amplified

Synthesis Kit), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The normalized cDNA samples were then purified
as described above (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit),
and digested using the BsgI enzyme (New England BioLabs, MA, USA) to remove the residual poly (A:T) tails.
Following digestion, an aliquot of restriction digest solution was evaluated on 10% TBE polyacrylamide gels
(Invitrogen, CA, USA), to verify that the appropriate
fragment size (49 bp) had been cleaved. Finally, digested,
normalized cDNA libraries were purified (QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit), and the quality of final samples
was verified using agarose gel electrophoresis.
454 sequencing

Sequencing of cDNA samples was performed by Roche454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT, USA) using the Genome Sequencer FLX with Titanium Chemistry. Each of
the A and P samples was sequenced on the half of a
PicoTiter Plate according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Roche, IN, USA). All sequencing reads were
deposited into the Short Read Archive (SRA) of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),
and can be accessed under the accession number
SRA023642.
Sequence analysis, and assembly

Sequencing data obtained from samples A and P were
pooled and subjected to a publicly available sequence
cleaning and validation software, SeqClean [71], to
account for size-selection, overall low complexity analysis, and to remove poly (A:T) regions, and adapters. In
addition, a comprehensive ribosomal RNA database,
Silva [72], containing regularly updated, high quality
sequences of eukaryotic rRNAs were incorporated into
the cleaning pipeline of the SeqClean to remove ribosomal RNA sequences. Following the sequence trimming
and size selection (>100 bp), the reads were assembled
using the Newbler v2.3 provided by Roche-454 Life
Sciences (Branford, CT). Assembly parameters were
used as default values with minimum quality score of
20, and overlap identity as 90% over 40 bp length to
detect pairwise alignments. Assembly computations
were duplicated to make sure that the results were
reproducible.
Unique sequence mapping, functional annotation, and
pathway assignments

Following the assembly, unique transcripts (isotigs) and
singletons were compared to NCBIâs non-redundant (nr)
database using BLASTx algorithm [73], with a cut-off Evalue of â¤ 10-6. Resulting top 10 blast hits were fed into
publicly available Blast2GO software (v.2.4.4) [33] in
order to retrieve associated gene ontology (GO) terms
describing biological processes, molecular functions, and

Page 15 of 17

cellular components [74]. By using specific gene identifiers and accession numbers, Blast2GO produces all GO
annotations as well as corresponding enzyme commission numbers (EC) for sequences with an E-value equal
to or less than 10 -6 . To compare the enzyme-coding
genes identified in this work with those identified in the
model microalgae with sequenced genome, we used
BLASTx algorithm with an E-value threshold of 10-6 to
align the transcript sequences annotated as enzymes
related to the production of biofuel precursors against
the sequences of associated enzymes in Volvox carteri,
and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
To determine metabolic pathways, Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping was used [35].
The sequences with corresponding ECs obtained from
Blast2GO were mapped to the KEGG metabolic pathway
database. To further enrich the pathway annotation and
to identify the BRITE functional hierarchies, sequences
were also submitted to the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) [34], and the single-directional best
hit information method was selected. KAAS annotates
every submitted sequence with KEGG orthology (KO)
identifiers, which represents an ortholog group of genes
directly linked to an object in the KEGG pathways and
BRITE functional hierarchy [34,75], and thus incorporates different types of relationships that exist in biological systems (i.e. genetic and environmental information
processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems).
The graphical KEGG Markup Language pathway editor
(KGML-ED) was used to draw the fatty acid catabolism
and glycolysis pathways [76]. Computationally processed
assembly outputs and annotations are hosted at the corresponding authorâs website http://www.eng.yale.edu/
peccialab/microalgae_sequences.html for public access.
