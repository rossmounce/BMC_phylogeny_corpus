Abstract
Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus that causes severe disease in situations
where the immune system is immature or compromised. HCMV immediate early (IE) gene expression is
stimulated by the virion phosphoprotein pp71, encoded by open reading frame (ORF) UL82, and this
transactivation activity is important for the efficient initiation of viral replication. It is currently recognized that
pp71 acts to overcome cellular intrinsic defences that otherwise block viral IE gene expression, and that
interactions of pp71 with the cell proteins Daxx and ATRX are important for this function. A further property
of pp71 is the ability to enable prolonged gene expression from quiescent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
genomes. Non-human primate cytomegaloviruses encode homologs of pp71, but there is currently no published
information that addresses their effects on gene expression and modes of action.
Results: The UL82 homolog encoded by simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV), strain Colburn, was identified and
cloned. This ORF, named S82, was cloned into an HSV-1 vector, as were those from baboon, rhesus monkey and
chimpanzee cytomegaloviruses. The use of an HSV-1 vector enabled expression of the UL82 homologs in a range
of cell types, and permitted investigation of their abilities to direct prolonged gene expression from quiescent
genomes. The results show that all UL82 homologs activate gene expression, and that neither host cell type nor
promoter target sequence has major effects on these activities. Surprisingly, the UL82 proteins specified by nonhuman primate cytomegaloviruses, unlike pp71, did not direct long term expression from quiescent HSV-1
genomes. In addition, significant differences were observed in the intranuclear localization of the UL82 homologs,
and in their effects on Daxx. Strikingly, S82 mediated the release of Daxx from nuclear domain 10 substructures
much more rapidly than pp71 or the other proteins tested. All UL82 homologs stimulated the early release of
ATRX from nuclear domain 10.
Conclusion: All of the UL82 homolog proteins analysed activated gene expression, but surprising differences in
other aspects of their properties were revealed. The results provide new information on early events in infection
with cytomegaloviruses.

Background
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important human
pathogen that causes fetal damage and organ transplant
rejection, and additionally represents a serious problem
in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS
patients. The predicted 165 HCMV-encoded genes are
expressed in a regulated program in which immediate
early (IE) proteins are produced prior to early and late
gene products. A complex promoter/enhancer element,
the major immediate early promoter (MIEP), controls
transcription of the most abundantly expressed IE locus,
while the two major proteins specified by this locus modulate all classes of viral gene expression through positive
and negative mechanisms. Proteins that enter the cell as
components of the infecting particle provide an additional level of transcriptional regulation, and one of the
most extensively studied of these, the tegument phosphoprotein pp71 (encoded by HCMV gene UL82) activates
expression from the MIEP in a variety of assay systems [15]. HCMV mutants lacking the UL82 coding region are
impaired for viral gene expression, especially after infection at low multiplicity, demonstrating that pp71 is
important for virus replication in permissive cells [6,7].
It has recently become clear that pp71 exerts its positive
effect on IE gene expression by counteracting an intrinsic
antiviral defence that is dependent on the cell protein
Daxx. This protein is found in the cytoplasm, where it regulates apoptosis [8,9], and also in nuclear structures
known as nuclear domain 10 (ND10) [10-12]. Within the
nucleus, Daxx functions as a repressor of gene expression,
primarily by localizing chromatin-associated inhibitory
factors, such as histone deacetylases, to relevant promoter
regions [13-15]. Upon HCMV infection, pp71 migrates to
the nucleus where it localizes to ND10 by binding to Daxx
[4,16]. The outcome of this interaction is the neutralization of repression by Daxx and consequent efficient transcription of viral IE genes [15,17-20]. Recent studies
indicate that pp71 stimulates the release of ATRX, a cell
protein with chromatin remodelling activity, from ND10
in a very early event after infection, suggesting that ATRX
is an important component of the cellular intrinsic
defences to HCMV [21].
Many studies have determined the activity of pp71 by
transfection of plasmids encoding the protein together
with a reporter plasmid [1,2,22,23]. As an alternative
method, we have used herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) mutants as vectors to enable expression of pp71. The
basic vector, in1312, has mutations that inactivate the
transcriptional functions of three crucial HSV-1 proteins.
The changes are an insertion in the coding region of the
virion component VP16, deletion of the RING domain of
the IE protein ICP0 and introduction of a temperature
sensitive mutation in the essential transactivator ICP4. As

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/65

a consequence of these mutations, in1312 is impaired for
transcription of its own genome and can be used as a vector for the expression of transgenes in a range of cell types
that are permissive for HSV-1. Infection with in1312
derivatives that express pp71 is an efficient means of
introducing the protein into cells. The activity of pp71 can
be assayed by superinfection with a second in1312 derivative that contains a reporter gene, usually E. coli lacZ,
controlled by various promoters. This system has been
used to demonstrate that pp71 activates expression from
a range of viral and cellular promoters in human, monkey
and mouse cell lines, and also in mouse neurons in vivo
[3,5].
Further experiments with in1312 derivatives that express
both β-galactosidase and pp71 revealed an additional
property of pp71, namely that it counteracts repression of
the HSV-1 genome. After infection of human fibroblasts,
in1312 is competent for transcription for only a few
hours, after which it becomes repressed by cellular mechanisms. Once repressed, the genome remains in a stable
'quiescent' state for more than 12 days in cell cultures. If
the infecting in1312 derivative expresses pp71, however, a
gradual reversal of the quiescent state is observed, signified by production of β-galactosidase many days after initial infection in cultures maintained at 38.5°C, and by
resumption of virus replication in cultures downshifted to
32°C to reverse the temperature sensitive defect of ICP4
[24].
Although pp71 has been studied extensively, there have
been few reports that address the functional activities of
homologs encoded by other cytomegaloviruses, and none
that describe the properties of UL82 homologs specified
by non-human primate cytomegaloviruses. In murine
cytomegalovirus (MCMV), three open reading frames
(ORFs) in the 'UL82 family' (M82, M83 and M84) exist
where there are only two in the case of HCMV (UL82 and
UL83), and it has been suggested that gene duplication
resulted in an MCMV UL82-like ancestor that gave rise to
both M82 and M83 [25]. MCMV mutants lacking M83
replicated normally in tissue culture, suggesting that M83
is not an activator of IE gene expression [26]. Further studies concluded that neither M82 nor M83 interacts with
Daxx, and therefore it is unclear whether MCMV encodes
a virion protein that is functionally analogous to pp71
[27]. The UL82 homolog encoded by guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) stimulated the transfection efficiency
of GPCMV DNA and complemented the replication of a
HSV-1 VP16 mutant. Furthermore, a GPCMV UL82-null
mutant was impaired for replication in culture. Taken
together, these observations imply that the GPCMV UL82
gene product is, like pp71, an activator of gene expression
[28,29].

In the studies presented here, we compared the properties
of pp71 with homologs encoded by non-human primate
cytomegaloviruses in three ways. The ability to function as
activators of gene expression was tested, the capacity to
overcome repression of HSV-1 genomes was investigated,
and the intranuclear distributions of the proteins, were
determined. The results reveal that, despite the overall
similarity of the UL82 homologs, there are surprising differences in their properties.

Results
Experiments were initially carried out to identify and
clone the simian CMV (SCMV) homolog of pp71.
Through a process of 'chromosome walking', an ORF at
the appropriate genome location was identified and
sequenced [Genbank: FJ610688]. The predicted amino
acid sequence was closely similar to that of pp71, and the
gene was named S82. The sequence was confirmed in a
project to determine the entire nucleotide sequence of
SCMV (A. Dolan, personal communication). An evolutionary tree was constructed to include the primate UL82
homologs, together with the rat CMV UL82 homolog and
MCMV M82 ORF (Fig. 1). S82 was most closely related to
the baboon CMV (BCMV) protein B82, and these two

sequences plus the rhesus CMV (RhCMV) protein Rh82
formed a branch separate from that which included the
chimpanzee CMV (ChCMV) protein UL82 and HCMV
pp71. The relationships between the proteins, apart from
S82, are as published previously [28]. As expected, in view
of its close similarity to other primate homologs, S82 contained sequence motifs thought to be functionally important, including two Daxx-interaction domains [4,7], a
retinoblastoma protein binding motif [30,31] and, as
reported previously, an internal region named the dUTPase-related domain [32].
To investigate the functional activity of S82, an N-terminal YFP tag was fused to the ORF and the hybrid construct,
controlled by the HCMV MIEP, cloned into the HSV-1
mutant in1312 (Table 1). The resulting virus, in1305, was
compared with in1316, an analogous recombinant that
expresses YFPpp71 instead of YFPS82 [24], using a functional assay described previously [3,5]. Cells were infected
with in1305 or in1316, and after incubation for 3 h,
superinfected with a second in1312 derivative containing
the E. coli lacZ coding region controlled by various promoters, as a reporter virus. Cultures were harvested after a
further 5 h and β-galactosidase assays performed. To
investigate possible cell type or promoter specificity, the
experiments were performed in human (HFFF2), African
green monkey (Vero) or mouse (3T3) cells, with a range
of promoters driving β-galactosidase expression in the
reporter virus (Table 2).
In all cell types tested, preinfection with in1305 resulted
in stimulation of β-galactosidase production, demonstrating that S82 is an activator of gene expression. The activity
of S82 was comparable to that of pp71 in human, African
green monkey and mouse cells, irrespective of the proTable 1: HSV-1 in1312-based recombinants used in the study1

1. Monolayers were mock infected or infected with in1372 (a control
virus that expresses Cre recombinase), in1316 (expresses pp71) or
in1305 (expresses S82) at moi 2, incubated at 38.5°C for 3 h, and
infected with a second reporter virus (moi 0.5) that contained the
lacZ coding region controled by the HCMV MIEP (in1382), the SCMV
MIEP (in1357) or the HSV-1 ICP0 IE promoter (in1383). After
incubation for a further 5 h at 38.5°C, cell extracts were analysed for
β-galactosidase activity.

moter in the reporter virus. There was no preference for
the homologous promoter, as preinfection with in1305
resulted in an equivalent stimulation of expression when
either the HCMV or the SCMV MIEP elements controlled
lacZ. Similarly, pp71 expressed by preinfection with
in1316 stimulated expression from the HCMV and SCMV
MIEPs to similar extents. In addition, the use of a homologous host cell did not influence the relative degree of
stimulation, since in1305 and in1316 exhibited similar
activities in HFFF2 and Vero cells, and indeed the greatest
degree of stimulation occurred in 3T3 cells for both
viruses.
The experimental approach described above, which relies
on dual infection of cells, demonstrates that S82 activated
transcription with an activity comparable to that of pp71.
However, the use of sequential infections in the assay may
compromise detection of small differences in activity. To
examine more stringently the activities pp71 and S82, and
to include comparisons with other UL82-derived proteins, YFP-tagged ORFs of pp71, S82, Ch82, B82 or Rh82
were cloned into the TK region of the HSV-1 mutant
in1374, to produce recombinant viruses that express both
UL82 homolog and β-galactosidase (Table 1). Infection
with these mutants was more appropriate for investigating
relatively small differences in activity of the UL82
homologs, since the protein and reporter sequences were
delivered to cells on the same genome. The results
reported here, using YFP-tagged proteins, have been
reproduced with myc-tagged versions (not shown), con-

firming, as shown previously, that the YFP moiety does
not affect the functional properties of the proteins
[21,24,33]. The functional activities of the proteins were
determined by infecting U373 monolayers at moi 1 or
HFFF2 at moi 5 and incubation at 38.5°C for 10 h, followed by assay of β-galactosidase and analysis of the
amounts of YFP-tagged UL82 homolog synthesized. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that β-galactosidase
production was proportional to input virus up to moi 5
(results not shown). Expression of the UL82 homologs
was approximately equivalent for the five recombinants in
both cell types (Fig. 2). Expression of β-galactosidase,
however, was 1.5–2.5 times greater in cultures expressing
S82, B82 and Rh82 than in those expressing pp71 or Ch82
(Table 3). Therefore, all primate UL82 homologs activated
gene expression, and those derived from SCMV, BCMV
and RhCMV were more active when introduced into cells
by infection with an in1374-derived recombinant.
We investigated whether the UL82 homologs shared with
pp71 the property of directing gene expression for
extended periods after infection of human fibroblasts.
Cultures of HFFF2 cells were infected with in1374-based
recombinants at moi 3 and maintained at 38.5°C for 10
days. After this time, cultures were treated in three ways,
following the protocol described previously [24]. For one
set of cultures, histochemical staining for β-galactosidase
was employed as a direct measure of continued gene
expression mediated by the UL82 homolog. A second set
was superinfected overnight with HSV-1 tsK. This mutant
expresses the IE protein ICP0 and therefore reactivates βgalactosidase expression from cells harboring a quiescent
genome, thereby defining the proportion of cells containTable 3: Expression of β-galactosidase in cells expressing UL82

ing one or more quiescent genomes. The final set was
transferred to 32°C for 4 days, with human serum in the
culture medium, to provide a sensitive test for the presence of genomes that were capable of replication when
the temperature sensitive defect of ICP4 was reversed. Cultures infected with in1310, encoding YFPpp71, contained
β-galactosidase expressing cells after incubation at 38.5°C
for 10 days but positive cells were not detected in cultures
infected with recombinants expressing S82, B82, Ch82 or
Rh82 (Fig. 3, top row), even though superinfection with
tsK resulted in equivalent β-galactosidase expression in all
cultures (Fig. 3, middle row). Upon downshift to 32°C,
extensive replication, demonstrated by widespread plaque
formation, was observed in in1310-infected cultures, but
those infected with viruses encoding the other primate
UL82 homologs contained no more than 15 β-galactosidase positive cells, or small clusters, per monolayer (Fig.
3, bottom row). These numbers were only marginally
greater than those observed in cultures infected with the
parental virus in1374 (not shown). Therefore, of the UL82
homologs tested, none exhibited the property of preventing or reversing the repression of HSV-1 genomes during
long term incubation of HFFF2 cultures in the manner
observed for pp71.

Interaction with the cell protein Daxx is important for the
role of pp71 in activation of gene expression. The intranuclear localization of the UL82 homologs was investigated
by immunofluorescence after infection of HFFF2 cells at
moi 0.1 with the in1374-based recombinants that
expressed YFP-tagged UL82 homologs. Monolayers were
fixed and co-stained for Daxx at 3 h and 7 h post infection
(pi). The patterns of YFP fluorescence were classed as
punctate (in which the signal was exclusively localized to
ND10), dispersed (no distinct foci) or mixed (punctate
superimposed on a background of dispersed signal).
Examples of these patterns are shown in figure 4, and it is
noteworthy that the distribution of Daxx coincided with
that of the YFP signal whereas the major ND10 component, PML, retained a punctate distribution even when the
YFP and Daxx signals were dispersed. The effect of the
UL82 homologs was therefore to alter the intranuclear
localisation of Daxx rather than to disrupt ND10 structures totally. The distributions were quantified by counting several fields from at least two coverslips (Table 4). As
described previously [21], at 3 h after infection with
in1310 YFPpp71 colocalized with Daxx at ND10 in virtually all positive cells. At 7 h pi, again most cells showed a
punctate distribution of YFPpp71, although those with
greater amounts of protein exhibited a mixed pattern and
in a small number YFPpp71 was dispersed (Table 4). The
most obvious finding was that S82 exhibited a localization pattern very different from that of pp71. Even by 3 h
pi, S82 was predominantly in a dispersed or mixed distribution with virtually no nuclei containing punctate signal. By 7 h pi, 86% of S82-containing nuclei exhibited a
dispersed distribution of the protein whereas, by contrast,
only 1% of pp71-positive profiles were dispersed. The
localizations of the other three homologs, B82, Rh82 and
Ch82, were intermediate between those of pp71 and S82,
with mainly punctate appearance at 3 h pi but increased
dispersed or mixed distribution at 7 h pi. Surprisingly,
pp71 was more similar to Rh82 than to Ch82 in this
respect.
It was reported previously that infection with in1316
resulted in the dispersal of ATRX at 3 h pi, a time at which
YFPpp71 and Daxx remained at ND10 in a punctate distribution [21]. To investigate whether the UL82 homologs
also promoted the early dispersal of ATRX, nuclei were
examined at 3 h pi and 25 YFP positives scored for ATRX
distribution. It was clear that expression of all UL82
homologs resulted in dispersal of ATRX even though the
YFP signal was punctate (Fig. 5), and this was confirmed
by quantification (Table 5). The homologs are therefore
similar to pp71 in their abilities to promote the early dispersal of ATRX from ND10.

Discussion
The cytomegaloviruses are overtly similar in terms of biological properties and coding potential, but differences
can be discerned when the viruses are considered in
greater detail. One obvious variation is in overall genome
structures, since HCMV and ChCMV have inverted repeat
sequences that mediate inversion of the unique regions
[34,35], whereas RhCMV, like MCMV, lacks internal
repeats and does not invert [36-38]. In terms of gene regulation HCMV, SCMV and MCMV each utilize a potent,
complex enhancer region for transcriptional control of the
major IE region, but there are few strong sequence similarities between these regulatory elements [39-41]. Previous
studies demonstrated differences between HCMV and
SCMV IE transcription, with certain cell types that
restricted HCMV IE transcription nonetheless permitting
full expression of the SCMV IE region [42,43]. The findings described here suggest that these differences reflect
the nature of the IE enhancer regions rather than a celltype specific actvity of the relevant UL82 homolog.

The results presented here demonstrate that four nonhuman primate UL82 homologs stimulate transcription
in a manner that is generally similar to that of pp71. The
strong sequence homology suggested that this would be
the case, but it should be noted that the predicted MCMV
UL82 homolog does not appear to activate gene expression whereas GPCMV UL82 homolog, which lacks many
features conserved in the primate proteins, has functional
activity [25-28].
Insertion of ORFs into the HSV-1 recombinants in1312
and in1374 provided a useful system for investigating the
activities of UL82 homologs, yielding comparative information that would be difficult to obtain by studying the
parental cytomegaloviruses themselves. At a practical
level, infection with in1312 derivatives permits delivery of
transgenes into cells at constant, relatively low copy numbers whereas transfection results in heterogeneity in the
amount of DNA delivered to individual cells and hence
large variations in gene expression at the individual cell

level. It should be noted, however, that the basic properties of the UL82 homologs reported here were reproduced
when plasmids expressing them were introduced into
cells by transfection, and that pp71 mutants with known
inactivating mutations, such as deletion of the Daxx interacting domains [4,7], were non-functional when
expressed from in1374-based recombinants (results not
shown). An additional advantage of using in1374-based
recombinants is that the reporter sequences (encoding βgalactosidase) are present in a herpesvirus genome and

hence should, to some extent, represent the normal environment of UL82 target promoters.
It was surprising to find that only pp71 was able to direct
long term gene expression, in view of the fact that all
homologs were functional in the short term assay. This
result suggests that the ability to direct long term expression is a specific feature of pp71 that is distinct from its
ability to activate IE transcription. Indeed, this conclusion
is supported by our the observation that, to date, six
pp71/Ch82 hybrid proteins that we have expressed from

plasmid constructs actively stimulated IE gene expression
but failed to direct long term expression (results not
shown). The most likely explanation for these findings is
that mediating long term expression requires interactions
between different domains of the pp71 molecule, and
that equivalent regions of Ch82 are incompatible. At
present, there is no obvious biological consequence of
this unique property of pp71.
The most notable finding from an analysis of intranuclear
distributions of the UL82 homologs was the distinct
behaviour of S82, which exhibited a dispersed distribution and mediated the dissociation of Daxx from ND10 at
earlier times than the other proteins. The difference in
intranuclear localisation between pp71 and S82 was also
observed after infection of African green monkey fibroblasts with in1310 and in0150, demonstrating that cell type
is not a crucial variable (results not shown). Surprisingly,
the more rapid dispersal of Daxx from ND10 was not
reflected in greater functional activity of S82; although
S82 was approximately twice as active as pp71 in the
expression assay, it was similar to B82 and Rh82, which
were predominantly ND10-associated at 3 h and, for
Rh82, 7 h pi. The S82 protein was not produced more rapidly than pp71 (results not shown). All homologs promoted the rapid dissociation of ATRX from ND10,
irrespective of the effects on the distribution of Daxx, supporting the recent report that the most important effect of
pp71 at early times of infection may be dissociation of cel-

lular repressor proteins, such as ATRX, from ND10 rather
than direct effects on Daxx itself [21].

Conclusion
The results presented here reveal surprising dissimilarities
in the properties of primate cytomegalovirus UL82
homologs, despite the fact that each of the proteins is a
potent transactivator of IE gene expression. The close relatives, pp71 and Ch82, are slightly lower in transactivation activity than the other three, but Ch82 lacks the
ability to direct long term expression and is sequestered at
ND10 less thoroughly than pp71. The functional heterogeneity extends through the UL82 proteins studied here,
since S82 is similar in functional activity to B82 and Rh82
but strikingly different in its intranuclear localization. Further studies to determine the significance of the differences between UL82 homologs may require investigation
of the cytomegaloviruses themselves. It may also be possible to construct recombinant cytomegaloviruses containing heterologous or hybrid UL82-encoded proteins,
provided there are no problems with incompatibilities for
incorporation of the proteins into the virus particle.

Materials and methods
Identification and cloning of S82, the SCMV UL82 homolog
DNA from SCMV (strain Colburn) was purified from virions released into culture medium and digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The mixture was cloned into pUC9 that
had been digested with HindIII and EcoRI. Plasmids, from
colonies picked at random, were sequenced from their

ends, and an isolate containing a 1 kilobase pair (kbp)
insert homologous to HCMV UL76 was selected. The
insert was used as a probe for colony hybridization to
detect a plasmid containing a 7 kbp HindIII/NheI fragment of which one terminus was homologous to HCMV
UL80. A fragment from this plasmid was used as probe to
identify a 5 kbp EcoR1/AgeI fragment with one end
homologous to the coding region of HCMV UL83 and the
other homologous to the C-terminus and termination
codon of HCMV UL82, plus 150 bp of downstream
sequence. It was concluded that the EcoRI/AgeI fragment
contained the entire coding region of the SCMV UL82

homolog (named S82). Further analysis determined that
the S82 ORF was contained entirely within a 1.9 kbp
region defined by NotI and SacII sites. This fragment was
cloned between the NotI and SacII sites of pBluescript
SKII and the nucleotide sequence determined. The S82
ORF was isolated by polymerase chain reaction using Vent
polymerase and primers 5'-GGACGGCTAAGCTTGGATGGATCGCCCTCCCGAGG and 5'-GGGCCGAATTCCAGGATTCGAGGTCTCGCAGTGG, thereby introducing
HindIII and EcoRI sites flanking the 5' and 3' termini of
the ORF, respectively. The HindIII/EcoRI fragment was
cloned between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pEYFP-C1

to produce plasmid pYFPS82, and the S82 termination
codon was regenerated by site-directed mutagenesis to
yield pYFPS82T11.
Derivation of a phylogenetic tree
Amino acid sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W
[44], and locations in the alignment with a gapping character in any sequence were removed. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed from the alignment by the neighbor-joining method, using programs in the PHYLIP package [45].
Viruses
The HSV-1 mutant in1312 has been described previously
[46]. Derivatives in1374 [24] and in1382 [3], contain
HCMV IE-lacZ inserted at the UL43 and TK locus, respectively. Derivative in1357 has an insertion consisting of
lacZ controled by the SCMV IE promoter at the TK locus
[5], and in1383 has the HSV-1 ICP0 promoter controling
lacZ, inserted at the TK locus of in1312 [46]. Mutant
in1372 expresses Cre recombinase in the in1312 background [47].
Construction of HSV-1-derived recombinants that express
UL82 homologs
To produce HSV-1 recombinants, UL82 homologs were
tagged at the N-terminus with YFP, and the resulting
hybrid ORFs were cloned into pCP1802, a transfer vector
in which sequences can be inserted, under the control of
the HCMV MIEP and simian virus 40 termination signals,
into the HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) coding region [3].
The resulting plasmids were linearized and cotransfected
with DNA from in1312 or in1374. Selection of TK-deficient mutants and analysis by Southern hybridization
were carried out as described previously [48]. The methods used for the individual UL82 ORFs are as follows:

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/65

der of the Rh82 ORF was cloned as an XhoI/DraI fragment
from a plasmid containing genomic DNA encompassing
the Rh82 ORF, between XhoI and SmaI sites of the modified plasmid. The YFPRh82 coding region was excised as
an AgeI/NotI fragment, end-filled and cloned into the
HpaI site of pCP1802 to yield pMJ185.
4. The Ch82 ORF was amplified from ChCMV DNA
(kindly provided by A. Davison, MRC Virology Unit),
using primers 5'-GTCTCGATCTCCTTCGCC and 5'-CCATGATCACAGCAGTGG, cloned into pGEMT-EASY to yield
pMJ162. The insert of this plasmid was sequenced to confirm that there were no changes from the published data
[35]. Plasmid pYFPpp71 was modified by insertion of an
oligonucleotide
duplex
(top
strand
5'TCGAGCTATGTCTCGATCTCCTTCGCCCGGGGAAGGGCCCGAACAAG) between XhoI and BamHI sites,
thereby replacing the pp71 ORF with the N-terminal 11
amino acids of Ch82. The remainder of the Ch82 ORF was
excised from pMJ162 as an ApaI/SpeI fragment and
cloned between ApaI and SpeI sites of the modified plasmid, to yield pTC2. The YFPCh82 ORF was excised from
pTC2 by cleavage with AgeI and SpeI, end-filled and
cloned into the HpaI site of pCP1802 to yield pTC9.
5. To clone YFPS82, an AgeI/BamHI fragment from
pYFPS82T11 was filled in and cloned into the HpaI site of
pCP1802 to yield pJS998.

2. The B82 ORF was excised as a SalI/NotI fragment from
a plasmid containing the entire ORF, and cloned between
SalI and NotI sites of pYFPpp71 to replace the pp71 ORF
with that of B82. YFP-tagged B82 was excised as an AgeI/
NotI fragment, the ends filled in and cloned into the HpaI
site of pCP1802 to yield plasmid pMJ187.

To produce recombinant viruses, ScaI-linearized pMJ135,
pMJ137, pTC9 or pJS998 were cotransfected with in1312
or in1374 DNA. Acycloguanosine resistant viruses were
plaque purified and analysed by Southern hybridization
for the presence of the transgene in the TK locus. Isolates
lacking detectable parental sequences on long autoradiographic exposures were propagated in BHK cells and
titrated at 32°C on U2OS monolayers in the presence of
3 mM hexamethylene bisacetamide [49]. The content of
functional genomes was assessed by infection of U373
and HFFF2 cells at low moi and coinfection overnight at
38.5°C with the HSV-1 mutant tsK, which provides the IE
protein ICP0 and overcomes repression of genomes, and
counting of β-galactosidase positive cells. The 'functional
genome content' determined by this method agreed
closely with the titres obtained on U2OS monolayers,
confirming that the preparations contained comparable
genome contents. A summary of the mutants used in this
study is presented in table 1.

3. To clone the Rh82 ORF, pYFPpp71 was first modified
by insertion of an oligonucleotide duplex (top strand 5'CCGGAATGGATCGCCCTCCCGAGGAAGAAGAAGAGCCCAGGCCGTCTACCTCTCGAG) between the
BspEI and EcoRI sites, thereby replacing the pp71 ORF
with the N-terminal 17 amino acids of Rh82. The remain-

cloned into the HpaI site of pCP1802) and recombinant

in1312, and in1310, derived from in1374) have been
described previously [5,24].

essential amino acids, 5% fetal calf serum, 5% newborn
calf serum, 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per milliliter. BHK cells were propagated in Glasgow modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10%
newborn calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 100
units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per milliliter.
Assays for effects on gene expression
Two assays were used for short term assay for stimulation
of gene expression. In the first of these, monolayers of
HFFF2, Vero or 3T3 cells were mock infected or infected
(moi 2) with an in1312 derivative expressing a UL82
homolog or control virus in1372, an in1312 derivative
that expresses Cre recombinase [47], and incubated at
38.5°C for 3 h. Cultures were superinfected with a second
in1312 derivative (moi 0.5) containing lacZ controlled by
various promoter elements. Incubation was continued at
38.5°C for 5 h, cells were harvested and β-galactosidase
assayed using methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactoside as substrate, as described previously [50]. Alternatively, monolayers of U373 or HFFF2 cells were infected with an in1374
derivative that expressed a UL82 homolog (and also contained lacZ coding sequences). At 10 h post infection,
extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase
activity, as described above, and analysed for protein
expression by western blotting using rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (Abcam) and mouse anti-actin
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) as probes, as described previously [5]. Long term expression was analysed after infection of HFFF2 monolayers with in1374 derivatives
expressing UL82 homologs (moi 3), as described previously [24]. Infected monolayers were maintained at
38.5°C for 10 days, at which time some were maintained
at 38.5°C, some were transferred to 32°C for 4 days in
medium supplemented with 2% human serum, and others were infected with the HSV-1 ICP4 mutant tsK and
maintained overnight at 38.5°C. Monolayers were fixed
and stained for β-galactosidase expression as described
previously [48].
Immunofluorescence
Coverslips were prepared and analysed by confocal microscopy as described previously [51]. Primary antibodies
were rabbit anti-Daxx (Upstate), rabbit anti-ATRX (Santa
Cruz) or mouse anti-PML, clone PG-M3 (Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies were Cy3- or Cy5-conjugates (GE
Healthcare).
