Abstract
Background: The genus Brassica includes the most extensively cultivated vegetable crops
worldwide. Investigation of the Brassica genome presents excellent challenges to study plant
genome evolution and divergence of gene function associated with polyploidy and genome
hybridization. A physical map of the B. rapa genome is a fundamental tool for analysis of Brassica
"A" genome structure. Integration of a physical map with an existing genetic map by linking genetic
markers and BAC clones in the sequencing pipeline provides a crucial resource for the ongoing
genome sequencing effort and assembly of whole genome sequences.
Results: A genome-wide physical map of the B. rapa genome was constructed by the capillary
electrophoresis-based fingerprinting of 67,468 Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones using
the five restriction enzyme SNaPshot technique. The clones were assembled into contigs by means
of FPC v8.5.3. After contig validation and manual editing, the resulting contig assembly consists of
1,428 contigs and is estimated to span 717 Mb in physical length. This map provides 242 anchored
contigs on 10 linkage groups to be served as seed points from which to continue bidirectional
chromosome extension for genome sequencing.
Conclusion: The map reported here is the first physical map for Brassica "A" genome based on
the High Information Content Fingerprinting (HICF) technique. This physical map will serve as a
fundamental genomic resource for accelerating genome sequencing, assembly of BAC sequences,
and comparative genomics between Brassica genomes. The current build of the B. rapa physical map
is available at the B. rapa Genome Project website for the user community.

Background
The genus Brassica is one of the most important vegetable
crop genera in the world because it contributes to human
diet, condiments, animal feed, forage, and edible or
industrial oil. Many cultivated species of Brassica are also
increasingly recognized as good sources of healthy metabolites such as vitamin C, soluble fiber, and multiple anticancer glucosinolate compounds including diindolylmethane and sulforaphane [1]. In addition, current
emphasis on rapeseed oil as a biofuel or a renewable
resource for industry worldwide makes Brassica a good target of metabolic engineering.
The close phylogenetic relationship between the Brassica
species and model plant Arabidopsis thaliana predicts that
the knowledge transfer from Arabidopsis for Brassica crop
improvement would be straightforward. However, the
complex genome organization of the Brassica species as a
result of multiple rounds of polyploidy and genome
hybridization makes the identification of orthologous
relationships of genes between the genomes highly difficult. In particular, comparative genomics study of Flowering Locus C region between B. rapa and A. thaliana
genomes revealed that the Brassica genome triplicated 13
to 17 million years ago very soon after divergence from
the Arabidopsis lineage. A following extensive interspersed
gene loss or gain events and large scale chromosomal rearrangements including segmental duplications or deletions in the Brassica lineage complicated the orthologous
relationships of the loci between the two genomes [2].
Hybridization between Brassica species is another source
of the Brassica genome complexity. The interspecific
breeding between three diploid Brassica species, B. rapa
(AA genome), B. nigra (BB genome), and B. oleracea (CC
genome), resulted in the creation of three new species of
allotetraploid hybrids B. juncea (AABB genome), B. napus
(AACC genome), and B. carinata (BBCC genome) [3].
Thus, investigation of the Brassica genome provides substantial opportunities to study the divergence of gene
function and genome evolution associated with polyploidy, extensive duplication and hybridization.
Several crop Brassica species have had their genomes characterized in-depth. With favorable genetic attributes, B.
rapa has been selected as a model species representing the
Brassica "A" genome and is the focus of multinational
genome projects. The early fruits of investigation with this
well-characterized genome are evident in the recent
advance in our understanding of Brassica "A" genome
structure and evolution [2,4-7]. Linkage maps have been
constructed for B. rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. Jangwon [4], cv.
VCS (Kim et al., unpublished our data), and cv. Chiifu [5].
These genetic maps with associated markers and comparative genomics study have enabled the identification of
quantitative trait loci (QTL) for club root resistance and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/280

flowering time. Large EST databases are publicly available
and a 24 K oligo microarray has been developed and used
to examine the transcriptome profile of B. rapa [8]. More
than 127,000 Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) end
sequences and about 580 seed BAC sequences of phase 2
or 3 are also available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. In parallel to these
activities, international programs are collaborating to
characterize the Brassica "A" genome at the whole genome
sequence level through a BAC-by-BAC sequencing
approach [9].
A crucial component of successful genome sequencing
activity with the BAC-by-BAC strategy is the availability of
a genome-wide, BAC-based physical map [10]. To date,
the utility of a physical map has been reported by major
genome sequencing projects of human [11], A. thaliana
[12], Oryza sativa [13], and Medicago truncatula [14]. These
physical maps were constructed with a combination of
restriction-enzyme digested BAC fragments fingerprinting
on agarose gels and assembly of the fingerprints by means
of FingerPrinted Contigs (FPC) software package [15]. The
agarose method has been successful, but it has limited
throughput because of the need for human band calling.
This is a time-consuming process requiring ample skill
even when using image software [16]. Another disadvantage of the agarose method is that few large fragments are
generated, and they are difficult to size. Bands manually
selected using the agarose method can often lead to a poor
map [17,18]. Fluorescence-labeled fingerprinting methods using DNA sequencing gel [19,20] or capillary electrophoresis [21,22] are alternative methods that have been
developed to make larger and more accurate contigs with
increased throughput. Fluorescence-labeled capillary electrophoresis methods include the 3-enzyme method [22]
and the High-Information Content Fingerprinting (HICF)
methods which use type IIS restriction enzyme [16] or the
SNaPshot labeling technique [21,23-25]. These methods
facilitate improved physical map construction both in
terms of throughput and quality of fingerprinting compared to the agarose method due to their automatic workflow and higher resolution [17,22]. However, an increase
in the number of enzymes and labeling colors in the HICF
method can give partial digestion, star activity, and low
labeling efficiency [23]. Accordingly, several wholegenome HICF assembly maps have been built for small
fungi genomes [23,24] as well as for large genomes of
maize [16] and catfish [25].
Brassica rapa has a haploid genome size of 550 megabase
pairs (Mb) [26]. Here we report the first genome-wide,
BAC-based SNaPshot physical map of the Brassica "A"
genome. To build a physical map, we have fingerprinted
about 99,000 BAC clones by the HICF method using an
ABI SNaPshot labeling kit and constructed a BAC clone

contig map by means of FPC v8.5.3. Sequence-tagged site
genetic markers incorporated in the genetic map anchored
the euchromatic portion of the physical map to chromosomal loci. The resulting physical map allows facilitated
selection of BAC clones for the B. rapa whole genome
sequencing effort.

Results and discussion
BAC library source and fingerprinting
Construction of a physical map for a genome that has
evolved through polyploidy, extensive genome duplication or hybridization presents robust challenges to
genome analysis. Successful contig build of the B. rapa
genome relies on the quality and availability of deep-coverage large insert genomic libraries. Three large-insert BAC
libraries of B. rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. Chiifu are available in
the public sector providing >34-fold genome coverage
[7,8]. The first step to construct a physical map is generation of fingerprints representing restriction digests of BAC
DNA using efficient techniques [20,27]. We have chosen
the HICF fingerprinting method based on its well-established format with a commercially available SNaPshot
labeling kit (ABI) and increased throughput using the ABI
3730 xl sequencer [17,21]. A total of 99,456 BAC clones
(~22.5Ã coverage) from the three independent libraries
were fingerprinted by digestion with five restriction
enzyme combinations (EcoRI, BamHI, XbaI, XhoI, and
HaeIII) followed by SNaPshot reagent labeling of four
colors at the 3' ends of the restriction fragments and sizing
on the ABI 3730 xl (Table 1). The size of DNA fragments
from the capillary fingerprinting chromatograms was collected by GeneMapper. There was an average of 114
restriction fragments produced per BAC clone. The average size of the band was calculated as 1.09 kb with average
insert size of BAC clones at 124 kb. The fingerprint data
was then imported to GenoProfiler [28] to change data
format suitable for FPC analysis. Of these fingerprints,
5,767 (5.8%) were removed from the data set due to no
insert clones, failure in fingerprinting, clones having fewer
than 50 bands or more than 200 bands in the range of 50â
500 bp, or cross-contamination. Thus, a total of 93,689

clones (94.2%) were successfully fingerprinted to be used
for contig assembly.
Contig assembly
With BAC fingerprints, the creation of a physical map of a
eukaryotic genome is a three-step process. First, the fingerprints are assembled into contigs, which are accurately
ordered contiguous overlapping clone sets [29]. Second,
the contigs are anchored on the genetic map to accurately
represent the true order [30,31]. Third, questionable contigs are broken to increase contig reliability or contigs
associated with adjacent regions of the genome are fused
to organize big contigs [32]. Genome duplication, repetitive sequence blocks, questionable clones (Q clones),
and/or fingerprinting error complicate these steps and can
result in contigs containing false-positive overlaps of
clones [16,29]. Therefore, as a prelude to developing a
reliable physical map of B. rapa, it is worth discarding low
quality or problematic data before the fingerprint assembly to avoid chimeric contigs. Moreover, the eliminated
clones can later be placed back onto the physical map
after the contig merger is completed [21]. In the three B.
rapa BAC library sources, up to 29% clones were estimated
to contain centromeric or pericentromeric repetitive
sequences [6]. To screen out the clones having heterochromatic repetitive sequences before contig assembly, we
removed 26,221 clones (28.0%) containing centromeric
repetitive sequences (CentBr and CRB) at least in one end
or pericentromeric repetitive sequences (PCRBr, 5S, and
25S rDNA) in both ends based on BLASTN search of BAC
end sequences (Table 1). Thus, a total of 67,468 BAC
clone fingerprints with an average band size of 1.39 kb
(Table 2), equivalent to 15.2Ã of the B. rapa genome, were
finally converted into the FPC database. Of these 67,468
clones, 37,041 (8.4Ã) were from the HindIII library,
24,767 (5.7Ã) from the BamHI library, and 5,660 (1.0Ã)
from the Sau3AI library.

To assemble the physical map contigs of the B. rapa
genome from BAC fingerprints, we used the program FPC
v8.5.3. Before contig assembly, a series of tests were per-

Each HICF assembly was performed starting with a complete build, followed by iteration of the Dqer, end-merge, and singleton-merge routines by
means of FPC v8.5.3.
aAdditional Dqer, end-merge, and singleton-merge routines at 1e-35 and 1e-25 are not shown.
bEach fingerprint band was estimated to represent an average of 1.39 kb. It was estimated by the average insert size of the BAC clones (124 kb,

formed to determine the FPC parameter suitable for contig assembly of the full data set. Contig build at high
stringency prevents chimeric joining of duplicated
regions, whereas starting builds at low stringency results
in maps with larger contigs that encompass more genome
space [16]. Thus, the best approach should rely on the
structural characteristics of a target genome. The automatic contig build using a randomly chosen data set was
tried with different cutoff values from 1e-40 to 1e-80.
Based on the preliminary test, the initial cutoff value was
chosen to be 1e-45. The initial parameter is reasonably
stringent because the contigs generated at this cutoff value
included up to 70% of the clones with less than 10%
questionable clones (Q clones) which can cause chimeric
assembly. Of course, assembly at higher stringency
improved the build by reducing Q clones but contig coverage reduced significantly. For example, contig build at
1e-70 included only 40% of the fingerprints in contigs
and left 60% as singletons. Based on this analysis, we
assembled the physical map contigs in three steps. First, a
cutoff value of 1e-45 was used for automatic contig assembly. Second, the "DQer" function was used to break up Q
contigs (contigs containing more than 10% of Q clones)
from the initial builds. Third, the remaining contigs were
end-merged by "End to End" function and then singletons
were added to the end of contigs by "Singles to End" function at 6 successively lower cutoffs, starting at 1e-40 and
terminating at 1e-15. At each round, additional "DQer"
was used to break up all bad contigs containing more than
15% Q clones (Table 2). As a result, the first contig build
resulting from automatic assembly and DQer contained
4,726 contigs assembled with 42,427 (63%) clones but
25,041 (37%) clone fingerprints remained as singletons.
Following an iterative process of consecutive FPC functions, "End to End", "Singles to End", and "Dqer", each
successive round contributed nicely to a decrease in the
contig number, singleton number, and genome coverage
but to an increase in average contig length (Table 2). It is
obvious that merger of singletons into the assembly is
responsible for most of the increase in the number of Q

clones in the map [16]. However, Table 2 shows that only
~34% of singletons integrated into the end of the contigs
contributed to the increase of Q clones in the build. This
result suggests that many clones that remained as singletons at the initial stringency cutoff are not just because
their fingerprints were low quality but because they may
come from regions of low coverage. If this is true, the BAC
libraries we used would not deeply cover the whole B. rapa
genome. An unsatisfactory aspect of this assembly is its
large number of Q clones (Table 2). The Q clones in this
assembly corresponded to 15% of the clones. This is a bigger proportion than the cases reported from catfish
(7.3%) [25] and maize (11%) [16]. A large number of Q
clones may result from fingerprinting error due to partial
digestion, star activity, or low labeling efficiency. Though
we removed the fingerprints containing centromeric
repeat sequences, the remaining dataset still included
highly repetitive DNA sequences. If repetitive sequences
significantly affect contig assembly, deep contigs (too
many clones assembled in a small region) can be made.
The impact of repetitive DNA sequences on the contig
assembly has been estimated. Of the 1,417 contigs, three
were found to be deep contigs. Chloroplast DNA can be a
source of deep contig assembly [33]. However, Blast analysis of B. rapa chloroplast sequence against BAC-end
sequences from the deep contigs suggested that these deep
contigs may be derived from B. rapa genomic DNA. These
three deep contigs included 71â84% of the clones as Q
clones, which contribute to ~48.3% of all Q clones in the
initial build. Thus, when we kill three deep contigs of the
initial build due to false positive overlaps, the Q clones in
the remaining 1,414 contigs correspond to 7.7% of the
whole clones.
The initial build, named B. rapa physical map Build 1, has
1,417 contigs with an average length of 512 kb covering
725 Mb, 1.3Ã coverage of the genome. The total coverage
of the physical contigs suggests that most contigs are not
sufficiently overlapping and the gaps between the contigs
need to be closed by additional fingerprinting. However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/280

with our current assembly, more fingerprinting of the
same libraries would not be effective in increasing coverage of the contigs and closing the gaps efficiently, because
a higher proportion of the BAC clones are covering repetitive sequence regions and some regions of the genome
could be poorly represented in those libraries generated
by restriction enzyme digestion. For this reason, we will
add more fingerprint data from a randomly sheared BAC
library that is under construction, and will develop a new
contig build.
Validation of contigs and manual editing
Several different approaches were used to evaluate the reliability of the B. rapa contig assembly. First, marker
anchors have been developed as an effective tool to validate contig structure and orientation. We analyzed
whether positive BAC clones of single locus RFLP markers
were assembled into the same segment of a contig. For
example as shown in Figure 1, a total of seven positive
BAC clones were identified through a HindIII BAC library
screen using a single locus BAN245 marker designed from
a hydrolase gene (Fig. 1A). FPC database search showed
that six of the positive clones were assembled into the
same segment of contig 415, and one clone was located
very close to the others on the consensus band (CB) map
(Fig. 1B). Marker anchors strongly supported proper
assembly of contigs. We anchored 187 contigs on an existing genetic map [4] using 315 genetic markers (Table 3
and Table S1 in additional file 1). Among the 187 contigs
containing BAC clones associated with framework genetic
markers, 37 contigs having at least two marker anchors
were selected to validate the contig build. The framework
markers displayed close genetic linkage for contigs. Even
nine questionable contigs (greater than 10 Q clones per
contig) of the 37 contigs showed nice anchoring of the
marker pairs on the genetic map. Figure 2 presents an
example of contig validation by mapping, in which a contig spanning the region of 86â91 cM of linkage group R9
was examined. A single locus RFLP marker, BAN235,
designed from a pectinesterase (PE) gene expressed in
anther was first used to screen the HindIII library, and
three positive BAC clones (KBrH016E13, KBrH059J05,
and KBrH071P14) were identified at high stringency. An

FPC database search detected the corresponding contig
containing the positive clones. Contig 180 consisted of 68
BAC clones and was 1.3 Mb in size. Two SSR markers,
KS31203 and KS31191, were designed from the BAC
clones KBrH001H24 and KBrH076J01, respectively,
which were found at both ends of the contig. Genetic
mapping of the SSR markers showed close genetic linkage
on linkage group R9, consistent with clone orders in the
contig. This result was supported by sequence analysis of
the selected BAC clones. BAC sequence analysis of 11
selected clones in this contig successfully generated two
overlapping sequence blocks in accordance with the
genetic mapping result. Additional mapping and BAC
sequencing enabled merger of contig 180 with five adjacent contigs to make a big contig extended to 3.1 Mb in
size (data not shown).
As a second validation, a grouping of a multigene family
was examined to determine if clones containing paralogous genes would be correctly assembled in the HICF
map. As shown in Figure 3, the contigs spanning the
regions containing the pectinesterase gene family members were investigated. At least 14 members of the PE gene
family were identified from a B. rapa EST database search.
Screening of the HindIII library using a RFLP marker
BAN2 designed from a PE gene identified 22 positive BAC
clones. Southern blot analysis of the 22 clones by EcoRV
digestion and hybridization with the BAN2 probe
grouped the clones into at least four different types
according to shared main bands (Fig. 3A). We analyzed
the contig assembly of 19 clones successfully fingerprinted from the 22 positive BAC clones. HICF assembly
of the 19 clones resulted in grouping of 14 clones in six
independent contigs consistent with the observed Southern hybridization pattern (groups I to VI corresponding to
contigs 672, 180, 205, 1428, 224, and 596, respectively);
the remaining five clones were singletons (Fig. 3B and Fig.
S1 in additional file 2). The clones of groups II/III and
groups IV/V shared the same main hybridization bands of
Type 2 and Type 3, respectively, but they were assembled
in separate physical contigs. These results strongly support
the assumption that paralogous clones are correctly
assembled in independent contigs or remain as singletons
in the current build. We found five additional cases of correctly assembled homeologous regions (data not shown).
Finally, the reliability of the assembly has been confirmed
by the results of ongoing genome sequencing of B. rapa.
Integration of physical contigs into the genetic loci identified a conflict between anchors of sequence-tagged site
markers. Contig 166 was found to be assembled by a false
joining. Two of the markers, KS50140 and KR50161,
anchored on this contig belonged to linkage group R3 but
KS10551 marker was assigned to R9. We checked the CB
maps of the fingerprint order of this contig and found that

An example

two independent contigs were joined by end merge at 1e25. To further test that the merger of two structurally
related genome clusters at low stringency generated a chimeric contig, we analyzed nine BAC clone sequences of
this contig which were included in our genome sequencing pipeline for chromosomes R3 and R9. Sequence analysis demonstrated that seven BAC clones, associated with
markers KS50140 and KR50161, assembled with one
sequence scaffold of chromosome R3, whereas two BAC
clones, associated with marker KS10551, merged into an
existing sequence block of chromosome R9 (data not
shown). Based on these results, we manually broke up this
contig into two independent contigs, contig 87 and contig
190, by splitting at the weak point of the CB map. A similar conflict was found in one of the deep contigs previously mentioned. Due to complex fingerprint
information and many Q clones originating from repetitive sequences, we killed this contig rather than split it.
Since our analysis included only a few contigs, overall reliability of current contig build is limited. However, this
validation study provided a contig assembly error estimated at 5%, in agreement with the previous reports of
maize (4%) [16] and catfish (5%) [25], in which the HICF
method was used. As of December 2007, chromosome
sequencing of R3 and R9 on our sequencing pipeline have
generated 21 and 27 sequence scaffolds which cover
approximately 23 Mb and 26 Mb, respectively. Sequence

analysis of the scaffolds provided validation of at least 204
contigs (data not shown).
With the results of contig evaluation, incorporation of
genetic marker information, and BAC sequencing, manual editing of the initial contig build yielded Build 2. As
shown in Table 4, Build 2 consists of 1,428 contigs spanning 717 Mb. Interestingly, Blast analysis of BAC-end
sequences against our B. rapa EST database showed that
1,227 contigs (86%) estimated to span ~616 Mb are
delimited to cover presumably gene-rich regions. We note
that removal of heterochromatic BAC clones before
assembly significantly enriched the euchromatic contigs
in the build. Of practical importance, integration of a
physical map into a genetic map enabled the positioning
of 242 gene-rich contigs to specific locations on 10 linkage groups providing seeds for the current genome
sequencing effort. The extent of the contigs associated
with genetic loci is ~160.7 Mb, or 29% of the total
genome. As we showed, marker integration is a powerful
tool to resolve questions on the physical map. During
marker integration, we found that hybridization-based
RFLP markers occasionally misassigned corresponding
BACs. The possible origin of this misassignment includes
highly conserved duplicated genome segments or recently
evolved gene paralogs that have distinct locations in the
triplicated B. rapa genome. Therefore, sequence-tagged

Figure 2 of a BAC physical contig anchored to the R9 chromosome of the B. rapa genome
An example
An example of a BAC physical contig anchored to the R9 chromosome of the B. rapa genome. This contig consists of 68 BAC clones from three source BAC libraries (Table 1) and is estimated to cover approximately 1.3 Mb. The clones
prefixed with KBrH were from the HindIII library, with KBrB from the BamHI library, and with KBrS from the Sau3AI library.
This contig was anchored to the region around 86â91 cM of the R9 genetic map using two SSR markers, KS31203 and
KS31191, and one RFLP marker, BAN235. The violet-highlighted clones represent the corresponding BAC clones containing
the respective DNA markers. All the highlighted BAC clones are in the genome sequencing pipeline and their sequencing
phases are indicated.

site markers rather than RFLP markers are the preferable
marker type for accurate BAC anchoring on the B. rapa
genome. Additional genetic mapping, further integration
of the genetic and physical maps based on sequencetagged site markers, and the progress of genome sequencing will improve build quality and ultimately determine
which contigs are substantially correct, contain merged
homeologous regions or are otherwise incorrect.

Conclusion
We constructed a genome-wide BAC contig map of the B.
rapa genome. This is the first whole genome physical map
representing the Brassica "A" genome. As of August 7,
2007, B. rapa physical map Build 2 can be accessed by the
user community by means of WebFPC. The physical map
created in this study contributes to a fundamental understanding of the Brassica "A" genome structure and function as well as to the ongoing genome sequencing project
as a resource for facilitating BAC selection and assembly of
the genome sequence. With the goal of constructing a
sequence-ready physical map, the current anchors of the
contig assembly provide 242 seed points which are being
extended by the BAC-by-BAC genome sequencing

approach of the Multinational Brassica Genome Sequencing Project (MBGSP). In addition, the map will serve as a
platform to accelerate development of Brassica comparative genomics by merging data collected from B. oleracea,
a model of Brassica "C" genome (Paterson and Pires, personal communication). Efforts continue to improve the
map by adding fingerprints from a randomly sheared BAC
library, additional genetic mapping, and hybridization
using overgo probes. All data presented in this paper with
updates are available through the B. rapa Genome Project
website [8].

Methods
Source BAC Libraries
Three BAC libraries used in this study were constructed
using partial digests with three different restriction
enzymes, BamHI, HindIII, and Sau3AI, as described previously (Table 1) [7,8]. The DNA source for the BAC libraries was from the reference plant line of B. rapa ssp.
pekinensis cv. Chiifu. Nearly all BAC clones used for fingerprinting were from the BamHI and HindIII libraries, with
a few BACs from the Sau3AI library.

An example
An example of correspondence between four different types of multiple loci genetic marker, BAN2, and their
distinct physical contigs containing corresponding BAC clones. (A), Southern blot analysis showing four different
hybridization patterns of BAN2 markers for 22 BAC clones picked from the KBrH library. I-VI represent the grouping of the
BAC clones according to their main hybridization bands from EcoRV digestion followed by BAN2 hybridization and fingerprint
contig information. *Three clones were excluded from the fingerprint assembly due to failed fingerprinting. sFive clones
remained as singletons after contig assembly. (B), view of six different fingerprint contigs containing the corresponding groups
of 14 BAC clones for respective marker types. The blue highlighted clones are those screened by hybridization.

BAC fingerprinting
BAC clones maintained in a 384-well microplate were
inoculated in four 96-deep well plates containing 2 ml of
1Ã LB medium with 12.5 ug/ml chloramphenicol using a
Biomek-FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA).
Plates were covered with Airpore gas-permeable plate sealant (Qiagen) and incubated at 37Â°C for 20â24 hours with

continuous shaking at 900 rpm on a BioShaker (Taitek,
Japan). BAC DNA was isolated using a modified alkaline
lysis method followed by purification. Typically 1 to 1.5
ug of BAC DNA was obtained per BAC clone. Purified BAC
DNA was digested with a mixture of five restriction endonucleases, BamHI, EcoRI, XbaI, XhoI, and HaeIII, for fragmentation. The digested DNA was labeled using ABI

PRISM SNaPshot Multiplex kit (ABI No. 4323159)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. The fluorescent BAC fingerprinting fragments were resuspended in
10 ul per well of Hi-Di formamide solution and then
loaded onto an ABI 3730 xl DNA analyzer with 0.05 ul
GeneScan-500 LIZ (ABI No. 4322682, size range from 35
to 500 bp) as an internal size standard.
Fingerprint data collection and BAC contig assembly
The fingerprint profiles for each BAC clone were collected
by GeneMapper v3.7 (ABI) and then converted to a data
format suitable for FPC application via GenoProfiler v2.1.
Bands ranging from 50 to 500 bp in size were collected for
contig assembly. For the data quality control, vector bands
and clones failing fingerprinting or lacking inserts were
removed manually. In addition, all samples with fewer
than 50 band fragments and more than 200 band fragments were also removed. Contig assembly was carried
out using FPC v8.5.3 [15] on an HP ML370G5, with two
2.66-GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon 5150 processors,
equipped with a Redhat Enterprise Linux AS 4 platform.
FPC parameter was adjusted as described by Luo et al. [21]
and Nelson et al. [16] for the HICF technique. Briefly, a
series of tests were conducted in which fingerprints of several sets of overlapping clones were compared using different tolerance (from 4 to 6) and cutoff (from 1e-80 to
1e-40) values. On the basis of these tests, tolerance was set
at 4 to obtain the 0.4 bp optimal tolerance value determined by Luo et al. [21] for HICF-SNaPshot fingerprinting and the gel length was set at 20,000 bp. An initial

Sulston cutoff score of 1e-45 was finally selected to be
optimal for contig assembly in order to minimize the
number of contigs without overly increasing the number
of questionable clones. Contigs with more than 10 Q
clones were reassembled by the "DQer" function of FPC.
The resulting contigs were merged by "End to End" auto
merge function with a minimum of two matching ends.
The remaining singletons were merged to the contigs by
"Singles to End" function and the "DQer" function was
used to finish the process by removing Q clones from the
resulting contigs.
BAC anchoring and manual contig editing
To anchor BAC-based physical contigs to the genetic and
cytogenetic maps, 315 sequence-tagged site genetic markers developed from the sequenced BAC clones were used
[[4] and Jin et al., unpublished our result]. During BAC
anchoring, the contigs showing conflict in the markerBAC relationship were manually split based on CB map
and BES information. Centromeric repetitive sequences
(CentBr and CRB), pericentromeric repetitive sequences
(PCRBr, 5S, and 25S rDNA), and chloroplast sequence
(NCBI accession DQ231548) were analyzed by BLASTN
search at cutoff value 1e-10 against BAC end sequence
database downloaded from NCBI.
High-density BAC filter screen and Southern blot analysis
The high-density HindIII BAC filters were made according
to Park et al. [7]. The BAC DNA (50 ng) was digested with
EcoRV or HindIII, separated in 1% agarose gel, and trans-

ferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) using the standard capillary transfer
method. To make RFLP probes, insert DNA of BAN2,
BAN235 and BAN245 cDNA clones were amplified by
PCR using T3 and T7 primers and then purified by Qiagen
gel extraction kit. Probes were labeled using random oligonucleotide priming under the conditions according to
the manufacturer's instruction (Megaprime Labeling System, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were
carried out at 65Â°C for 24 h with [Î±-32P]-labeled DNA
probes. Following hybridization, membranes were
washed twice in 2 Ã SSC and 0.5% SDS for 15 min, followed by 1 Ã SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min, and 0.5 Ã SSC
and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65Â°C. The membranes were
exposed to X-ray film for 2â3 days at -80Â°C with intensifying screens.
