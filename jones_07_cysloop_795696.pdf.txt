Abstract
Background: Members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cys-loop LGIC) superfamily
mediate chemical neurotransmission and are studied extensively as potential targets of drugs used
to treat neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Insect cys-loop LGICs are also of
interest as they are targets of highly successful insecticides. The red flour beetle, Tribolium
castaneum, is a major pest of stored agricultural products and is also an important model organism
for studying development.
Results: As part of the T. castaneum genome sequencing effort, we have characterized the beetle
cys-loop LGIC superfamily which is the third insect superfamily to be described after those of
Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera, and also the largest consisting of 24 genes. As with
Drosophila and Apis, Tribolium possesses ion channels gated by acetylcholine, γ-amino butyric acid
(GABA), glutamate and histamine as well as orthologs of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride
channel subunit (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to Drosophila and Apis, Tribolium cys-loop
LGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing although the beetle orthologs of RDL and GluCl
possess more variants of exon 3. Also, RNA A-to-I editing was observed in two Tribolium nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor subunits, Tcasα6 and Tcasβ1. Editing in Tcasα6 is evolutionarily conserved
with D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and Heliothis virescens, whereas Tcasβ1 is edited at a site so far only
observed in the beetle.
Conclusion: Our findings reveal that in diverse insect species the cys-loop LGIC superfamily has
remained compact with only minor changes in gene numbers. However, alternative splicing, RNA
editing and the presence of divergent subunits broadens the cys-loop LGIC proteome and
generates species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on Tribolium castaneum enhance our
understanding of cys-loop LGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the development
of improved insecticides that target an important agricultural pest.

Background
In insects, members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cys-loop LGIC) superfamily mediate both fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the nervous

system. The superfamily includes cation permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [1,2], γ-amino
butyric acid (GABA)-gated anion channels [3], glutamategated chloride channels (GluCls) [4] and histamine-gated

chloride channels (HisCls) [5,6]. Studies of Drosophila
melanogaster and Apis mellifera have shown that cys-loop
LGICs mediate important aspects of behaviour such as
escape response [7], learning and memory [8-12]. Members of the cys-loop superfamily of ionotropic receptors
are also of considerable interest as they are targets of
widely used insecticides [13]. For example, nAChRs are
targets of neonicotinoids [14,15], a class of insect control
chemicals which include imidacloprid with worldwide
annual sales of approximately one billion US dollars [16].
Also, GABA receptors, GluCls and HisCls are targets of
fipronil and avermectins [17,18].
The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is a highly
sophisticated genetic and developmental model organism
[19], and is a major global pest of stored agricultural products. In the USA alone, T. castaneum contributes to over
one billion US dollars worth of damage to wheat and corn
every year [20]. Tribolium has proven highly adaptable,
developing resistance to a wide range of insecticides raising the need for the development of improved and novel
control agents. To date, partial DNA sequences of only a
few T. castaneum cys-loop LGIC subunits have been
reported. These include a HisCl [21], transcript variants of
a nAChR subunit orthologous to Drosophila melanogaster
Dα6 (submitted to NCBI by Jin and colleagues, Acession
Numbers EF127806–EF127810) and a GABA-gated ion
channel which is an ortholog of Drosophila RDL [22].
Interestingly, a mutation changing alanine 302 to serine
in the Tribolium GABA receptor is associated with cyclodiene resistance [23,24]. Indeed, the same mutation is
found in RDL from cyclodiene resistant strains of a wide
range of insect species [25,26]. Characterizing the full
complement of Tribolium cys-loop LGIC subunits represents a critical step in identifying key components of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/327

beetle nervous system as well pinpointing particular
insecticide targets. Here we have used sequence data from
the T. castaneum genome project [27] to provide the first
description of a complete cys-loop LGIC gene superfamily
from an invertebrate pest species.

Results
The T. castaneum cys-loop LGIC superfamily consists of
24 subunit members
Using tBLASTn [28], 24 candidate cys-loop LGICs were
identified in the T. castaneum genome and manually
annotated. This is the third complete insect cys-loop LGIC
superfamily to be described after those of D. melanogaster
and A. mellifera and the largest known to date since the
fruit fly possesses 23 subunits and the honey bee has 21
[29]. RT-PCR [see Additional file 1 for primers used]
showed that all of the Tribolium cys-loop LGIC subunits
are transcribed. An alignment of their protein sequences
shows that the beetle subunits possess features common
to members of the cys-loop LGIC superfamily [30] (Figs.
1, 2, 3, 4 and Additional file 2). These include: (a) an
extracellular N-terminal domain containing distinct
regions (loops A-F) that form the ligand binding site [31];
(b) the dicysteine-loop (cys-loop) consisting of two disulphide bond-forming cysteines separated by 13 amino acid
residues; (c) four transmembrane regions (TM1–4), the
second of which (TM2) contributes most of the channel
lining residues; (d) a highly variable intracellular loop
between TM3 and TM4. As with other cys-loop LGIC subunits, the Tribolium sequences also possess potential Nglycosylation sites in the extracellular N-terminal domain
and phosphorylation sites in the TM3–TM4 intracellular
loop.

A comparison of sequence identities between T. castaneum, D. melanogaster and A. mellifera cys-loop LGIC
subunits (Tables 1 and 2), as well as the use of a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5), indicates orthologous relationships
between the beetle, honey bee and fruit fly subunits. To
facilitate comparisons between the three species, Tribolium subunits were named after their Drosophila counterparts as previously done with Apis subunits [29]. For
example, the beetle orthologs of Drosophila Dα1, RDL
and CG8916 were designated Tcasα1, Tcas_RDL and
Tcas_8916 respectively.

Tribolium nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits
We identified 12 candidate nAChR subunit-encoding
genes in the T. castaneum genome. This is the largest insect
nAChR gene family so far described as those of D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and A. mellifera consist of 10,
10 and 11 subunits respectively [1,32,33]. Eleven of the
Tribolium nAChR subunits possess the two adjacent
cysteine residues in loop C (Fig. 2) which are important
for acetylcholine (ACh) binding [34], defining them as α
subunits. The remaining subunit was designated β since it
lacks the vicinal cysteines.

Tribolium possesses core groups of nAChR subunits that
are highly conserved between different insect species [35].
Thus, subunit equivalents of Dα1–7, Dβ1 and Dβ2 are
evident in the beetle genome (Fig. 5). As with Anopheles,
Apis and several other insects [36], the Tribolium ortholog
of Dβ2 is of the α type (Tcasα8). Interestingly, the beetle
possesses an additional α subunit (Tcasα11) in the Dβ2
group, indicating a gene duplication in the Tribolium lineage. In line with this, both Tcasα8 and Tcasα11 genes are
tightly clustered together within 8 kb of each other in the
beetle genome suggesting that both subunits arose from a
recent duplication event from a common gene. Both A.
gambiae and D. melanogaster possess three subunits (Dα5,
Dα6 and Dα7) that are very similar and show substantial
homology to the vertebrate α7 nAChR subunit [32,37]. In
T. castaneum, two orthologs of these subunits (Tcasα6 and

Tcasα7) are also similar to human α7, sharing 46% and
45% identity respectively at the protein level. The third
subunit, Tcasα5, when compared with vertebrate nAChR
subunits, is most similar to α7 but shares only 25% identity and, along with its Apis ortholog (Amelα5), departs
strongly from Dα5 (Fig. 5). Tribolium nAChR subunits
outside of the Dα5–7 group show 19%–39% identity
with vertebrate subunits. As is the case for Dα1, Dα2,
Dα3, Dα4, Dβ2 and their Anopheles and Apis orthologs,
the corresponding Tribolium subunits (Tcasα1–α4, Tcasα8
and Tcasα11) have an insertion in loop F (Fig. 2), which
may contribute to imidacloprid interactions [38]. The
Dα1, Dα2 and Dβ2 genes, as well as their Anopheles
orthologs, Agamα1, Agamα2 and Agamα8, are similarly
arranged and tightly clustered within 200 kb and 220 kb
respectively [32]. Immunohistochemical and coimmuno-

precipitation studies show that Dα1, Dα2 and Dβ2 are
integral components of certain nAChRs subtypes, leading
to the suggestion that clustering may facilitate coordinated expression and co-assembly of the nAChR subunits
[39]. In Apis, Amelα1 and Amelα2 are clustered but are
separated from the honey bee Dβ2 ortholog, Amelα8
[33], while in the Tribolium genome all equivalent beetle
subunits, Tcasα1, Tcasα2 and Tcasα8, are located on different linkage groups (Table 1). The separation of these
genes may thus result in diversification of receptor expression and coassembly. Tribolium does however, show clustering of Tcasα7 and Tcasβ1 (both genes lie within 8 kb of
each other) which is conserved in the genomes of Anopheles and Apis but not Drosophila [33].
Analysis of D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A. mellifera
nAChR gene families has shown that each insect possesses
at least one divergent subunit that shares relatively low
sequence identity with other nAChR subunits [35]. The
four insect nAChR gene families described so far each contain a different complement of divergent subunits. Thus,
Drosophila and Anopheles have one divergent subunit each
but are of the β and α types respectively [32,40], while Apis
and Tribolium each have two subunits which are α and β
in the honey bee and are both α subunits in the beetle
[33] (Fig. 5). One of the Tribolium divergent subunits,
Tcasα9, possesses an atypical FxCC amino acid motif
instead of YxCC found in loop C of all other insect α
nAChR subunits characterised to date (Fig. 2). The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is the only other organism
known to possess nAChR subunits with the FxCC motif
[41]. Since site-directed mutagenesis has shown that a Tyr
to Phe substitution in the heterologously expressed vertebrate α7 subunit results in a tenfold lower affinity for ACh
[42], Tcasα9 may have unusual ligand binding properties.
In addition, Tcasα9 lacks the GEK motif characteristic of
nAChR subunits which precedes TM2 (Fig. 2) and plays an
important role in ion permeation and selectivity [43].
Most notably, the absence of the highly conserved
glutamic acid residue may have given rise to a receptor
with distinct ion channel properties since a substitution of
the equivalent glutamic acid residue in the vertebrate α7
nAChR abolishes permeability to calcium ions but not
monovalent cations [44].
Two Tribolium nAChR subunits, Tcasα4 and Tcasα6, have
alternatively spliced exons most likely arising from tandem exon duplication [45]. This alternative splicing is
conserved in Anopheles, Apis and Drosophila. Thus, as with
Agamα4, Amelα4 and Dα4 [32,33,46], Tcasα4 possesses
two alternatives for exon 4 (denoted exon4 and exon4')
(Fig. 6A), and similar to Dα6 [37], Tcasα6 has two alternatives for exon 3 and three alternatives for exon 8 (Fig.
6B). Analysis of sequence chromatograms shows that
both alternatives for Tcasα4 exon4 are transcribed while

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/327

RT-PCR [see Additional file 3 for primers used] detected
all six possible combinations of alternate exons for
Tcasα6. As previously observed for Anopheles, Apis and
Drosophila nAChRs, alternative splicing introduces amino
acid changes in functionally significant regions and thus is
likely to increase nAChR diversity [32,33,37,46]. Thus,
alternative splicing of Tcasα4 exon4 substitutes residues
in loop E, which may affect ligand binding [31], as well as
residues in the vicinity of the cys-loop which may affect
receptor assembly [46,47]. For Amelα6, alternative splicing of exon 8 changes residues in the TM2 domain which
may alter the ion channel properties of the receptor. In
one example, Tcasα6 exon 8c substitutes a highly conserved glutamic acid residue (Fig. 6B), which may affect
ion conductance [48]. Two Tribolium alternate exons,
Tcasα6 exon 3a and Tcasα6 exon 8b, have sequences that
are identical to the equivalent exons in Drosophila (Fig.
6B). Also, Tcasα6 exon 8b is completely conserved in
Anopheles and Apis, indicating an evolutionarily robust
function for this exon. As highlighted in Fig. 6, the other
alternate exons of Tcasα4 and Tcasα6 have residues that
differ from those of their Drosophila counterparts which
may give rise to nAChR splice variants with functional
properties particular to certain insect species.
Five D. melanogaster nAChR subunits (Dα5, Dα6, Dα7,
Dβ1 and Dβ2) as well as RDL and GluCl are known to
undergo pre-mRNA A-to-I editing [7,37,49,50], a process
which essentially converts adenosine (A) in the genome
into guanosine (G) in transcripts, thereby generating
mRNA with a nucleotide sequence that differs from the
corresponding genomic DNA [51]. The cDNA sequences
of all the Tribolium cys-loop LGIC subunits were analyzed
and potential RNA editing was observed in two nAChR
subunits, Tcasα6 and Tcasβ1 (Fig. 7). Sequencing of the
corresponding genomic DNA verified that the nucleotide
changes occur at the RNA level. Tcasβ1 is edited at a single
site which alters a highly conserved lysine to an arginine
residue in the vicinity of loop D, potentially affecting the
subunit's ligand binding properties (Fig. 1 and Fig. 7A).
Editing at this site has not been observed for any other
nAChR subunits although residues nearby are edited in
Dβ1 [49]. Tcasα6, on the other hand, demonstrates a high
degree of evolutionary conservation in RNA editing as it
undergoes editing that alters two amino acid residues as is
also the case for the orthologs of D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens [33,37].
Two of the editing sites in Tcasα6 (Fig. 7B), corresponding
to sites 4 and 5 in Dα6 [37], remove a potential N-glycosylation site which may affect receptor maturation, channel desensitization and conductance [52,53]. We
analyzed the RNA editing levels at sites 4–6 in RT-PCR
products generated by primers that amplify specific splice
variants [see Additional file 3 for primers used]. As shown
in Fig. 7C, the extent of editing varies between the three

sites (two-way ANOVA analysis P < 0.0001). For instance,
editing at site 4 in the exon3b+exon8a (3b8a), 3b8b and
3b8c splice variants is significantly higher than site 5 editing of the same isoforms (P < 0.001). More strikingly,
RNA editing levels at the same site vary with the splice variant. For example, the 3a8c isoform has notably low editing levels at site 4 when compared to the other splice
variants (one-way ANOVA P < 0.001). In another case, the
minority of transcripts with exon 3a is edited at site 5
while the majority of isoforms with exon 3b are edited at
the same site (P < 0.01). This suggests that RNA-editing
and alternative splicing are linked in generating proteome
diversity. This is in accord with findings of a study investigating the relationship between the two processes in the
Drosophila Dα5 nAChR subunit [54].

Tribolium GABA-gated ion channels
The Tribolium genome contains orthologs of the three
known D. melanogaster GABA-gated ion channels, RDL,
GRD and LCCH3 [3] (Fig. 5 and Table 2). RDL possesses
a PAR sequence before TM2 which is characteristic of cysloop ligand-gated anion channels [43] while GRD and
LCCH3 lack this sequence. This may underlie the findings
that RDL forms homomeric anion channels [26] whereas
GRD and LCCH3 form heteromultimeric cation channels
when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes [55]. The PAR
motif is also present in Tcas_RDL and is absent in
Tcas_GRD and Tcas_LCCH3 (Fig. 2) indicating that Tribolium may possess both ligand-gated anion and cation
channels. However, whereas electrophysiology has clearly
shown that GABA induces inhibitory chloride channels in
insects, it remains to be established whether GABA-gated
cation channels function in vivo [3].

As is the case for Drosophila RDL, exons 3 and 6 are alternatively spliced in Tcas_RDL (Fig. 6C) although, whereas
Drosophila and Apis have two alternatives for exon 3
[29,56], Tribolium has three. To accommodate this extra
alternative exon and anticipate the possibility of additional exons in other insect species, we have revised the
nomenclature of RDL splice variants. Thus, RDL exons "a"
and "b" are denoted exon 3a and exon 3b respectively,
while exons "c" and "d" are now called exon 6a and exon
6b. We have designated the extra exon in Tcas_RDL as
exon 3c. Exons 3a and 3b are completely conserved in
Drosophila RDL [56], Amel_RDL [29] and Tcas_RDL, while
exon 3c of Tribolium introduces two novel amino acid residues near to loop D (Fig. 6C). RT-PCR [see Additional file
3 for primers used] show that all six possible combinations of alternate exons for Tcas_RDL are transcribed.
Since studies of Drosophila RDL demonstrate that alternative splicing alters affinity for GABA [57], the extra choice
of exon in Tcas_RDL may give rise to a receptor with
extended functional range when compared to orthologs in
other insects. The most variation seen between a
Tcas_RDL alternate exon and its equivalent in Drosophila
is in exon 6a which differ by eight residues, most of which
are located in the vicinity of loop F (Fig. 6C). This may
give rise to receptor variants that have distinct ligand
binding characteristics in the two insect species.
Variants of Tcas_GRD were detected in RT-PCR products
where differential use of splice sites introduces either one
of two insertions in loop C which are denoted variant 1 or
variant 2 (Fig. 8A). Variations of Drosophila or Apis GRD
subunits have not so far been observed, although it has
been noted that the fruit fly GRD subunit has an unusual
stretch of 75 amino acids which is present at the site
equivalent to Tcas_GRD variants 1 and 2 [58]. Since loop
C is involved in ligand binding [31], differential splicing
has the potential to diversify the ligand binding properties
of Tcas_GRD.
Tribolium glutamate and histamine-gated chloride
channels
As with D. melanogaster and A. mellifera, T. castaneum has
one
known
glutamate-gated
chloride
channel
(Tcas_GluCl) and two histamine-gated chloride channels
(Tcas_HisCl1 and Tcas_HisCl2). Consistent with their
putative function as anion channels, Tcas_GluCl,
Tcas_HisCl1 and Tcas_HisCl2 all have the PAR motif preceding TM2 (Fig. 2) [43]. Out of the ligand-gated anion
channels, GluCl and HisCl2 are the most highly conserved between the fruit fly and beetle, sharing 83% and
79% identity respectively (Table 2).

Exon 3 of Tcas_GluCl is alternatively spliced as is the case
with Drosophila GluCl and Apis GluCl [33,50]. However,
whereas the fruit fly and honey bee GluCls each have two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/327

alternatives for exon 3, Tribolium has three (Fig. 6D).
Sequence chromatograms of Tcas_GluCl RT-PCR products
[using primers shown in Additional file 1] showed mixed
peaks corresponding to exon 3 indicating multiple variants are transcribed. In order to maintain consistency with
other cys-loop LGIC subunits, we have revised the
nomenclature of GluCl alternative exons so that Modules
1 and 2 correspond to exons 3a and 3b respectively. Similar to RDL, alternative splicing of GluCl alters amino acid
residues in the vicinity of loop D which may introduce
variation in ligand-binding properties. With the extra
alternative exon (exon 3c), Tcas_GluCl may have a wider
range in receptor functional properties when compared to
GluCls of other insect species.
Tribolium pHCl and uncharacterized cys-loop LGIC
subunits
The pH sensitive chloride channel (pHCl) first identified
in Drosophila [59] is well conserved in T. castaneum, showing 68% identity (Table 2). The Drosophila pHCl has several splice variants, of which Variant 3 introduces an
insertion in the intracellular region between TM3 and
TM4. We detected a similar variant in Tcas_pHCl transcripts (Fig. 8B) where the peptide insertion differs by
only one amino acid residue from that of Drosophila pHCl
[59] and is completely identical to the equivalent insertion in Amel_pHCl [29]. However, unlike Drosophila and
Apis, the Variant 3 insertion does not introduce a potential
protein kinase C phosphorylation site in Tcas_pHCl. This
may lead to the beetle pHCl having distinct characteristics
since phosphorylation of the large intracellular region
modulates receptor assembly and function [60,61], Interestingly, we detected a second insertion at the same site
which has not been observed in Drosophila or Apis.
Denoted Tcas_pHCl Variant 3a (Fig. 8B), this insertion
introduces a putative casein kinase II phosphorylation
site. Tcas_pHCl also has an insertion in loop C (Variant 4,
Fig. 8C) which is likely to impact on ligand binding. The
equivalent of this insertion has not been observed in Drosophila but has been detected in Apis with the insertion
sequence and length differing considerably between beetle and honey bee (Fig. 8C).

Five Drosophila cys-loop LGIC subunits have yet to be
functionally characterized. These are CG6927, CG7589,
CG8916, CG11340 and CG12344. CG8916 and
CG12344 appear to be closely related with GRD and HisCls respectively while CG6927, CG7589 and CG11340
forms a distinct subfamily of cys-loop LGIC subunits
which, following on from a recent study [62], we have
denoted Insect Group 1 of cys-loop LGIC subunits (Fig.
5). Tribolium also possesses five uncharacterized subunits.
Two of these, Tcas_8916 and Tcas_12344, are candidate
orthologs of CG8916 and CG12344 being notably similar
to their Drosophila counterparts, both sharing 54% iden-

tity (Table 2). The remaining three subunits belong to
Insect Group I (Fig. 5) and have been denoted
Tcas_CLGC1, Tcas_CLGC2 and Tcas_CLGC3, standing for
cys-loop ligand gated ion channel. Despite sharing highest
sequence identities with Drosophila Insect Group I subunits (Table 2), their orthologous relationships are uncertain since, for example, Tcas_CLGC2 shows 36% identity
with both CG6927 and CG7589 (Table 2). A. mellifera
possesses only one subunit, Amel_6927, in Insect Group
1 [29], indicating that gene duplication occurred after the
emergence of the Hymenoptera to give rise to the three
subunits present in both Tribolium (Coleoptera) and Drosophila (Diptera). This is in line with recent findings suggesting that the Hymenoptera are basal to the Coleoptera
[63,64]. Consistent with gene duplication occurring
within Insect Group 1 just before the emergence of Coleoptera, Tcas_CLGC1, Tcas_CLGC2 and Tcas_CLGC3 are
tightly clustered together in the Tribolium genome, being
located within 10 Kb in linkage group 8. In the more evolutionarily advanced D. melanogaster [63], the three genes
are separated with CG7589 and CG11340 being respectively located on the left and right arms of chromosome 3
and CG6927 being present on chromosome X [65].

Discussion
Insect genome sequencing projects have allowed the identification and comparison of gene superfamilies from
diverse species. As part of the Tribolium sequencing project
[27], we have described the beetle cys-loop LGIC superfamily which encodes for receptors that play major roles
in the nervous system and are also targets of highly successful insecticides. This is the first complete cys-loop
LGIC superfamily to be described from a Coleoptera and
an agricultural pest species, and is the third to be reported
after those of the Dipteran D. melanogaster [29,62,66] and
the Hymenopteran A. mellifera [29]. In the three insect
species, which represents over 300 million years of evolution [63], the cys-loop LGIC superfamily has remained
compact with only minor changes in gene numbers. However, alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing have considerably increased receptor diversity, effectively
introducing changes in functionally significant and highly
conserved regions to generate subunit isoforms particular
to certain insect species. Also, it is becoming apparent that
each insect possesses a distinct complement of highly
divergent nAChR subunits whose sequences do not reflect
a high degree of evolutionary constraint and thus may
play diverse roles in different species. In addition, a group
of cys-loop LGIC subunits that appear to be particular to
insects, which was noted as D. melanogaster Group 1 [62],
and denoted here as Insect Group 1 to accommodate
sequences from other species (Fig. 5), may represent more
recent members of the superfamily since only one subunit
is found in Apis and three are present after the emergence
of Coleoptera. It will be of interest to determine the func-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/327

tional role played by Insect Group 1 subunits and the ligands to which they respond.
The species-specific diversification arising from alternative splicing, RNA editing and divergent subunits, as well
as insect-specific subunits, represents promising receptor
differences to target for the future rational design of insecticides that control pest species while sparing beneficial
insects. The use of heterologous expression systems such
as Xenopus laevis oocytes has allowed the functional characterisation of several Drosophila cys-loop LGICs such as
RDL [56], GRD and LCCH3 [55], GluCl [67], HisCl1 and
HisCl2 [5,6] and pHCl [59]. Similar studies of heterologously expressed ion channels from other insect species
including T. castaneum, in combination with the use of
three-dimensional models based on the crystal structure
of molluscan acetylcholine binding proteins [1,68-70],
will likely prove useful in the search for novel compounds
that show selectivity for receptors of certain insect species
as well as in determining the mechanisms of insecticide
interaction with cys-loop LGICs. For insect nAChRs, functional expression in heterologous systems has so far
proven elusive [1], although low levels of receptor activity
have been observed for the locust Schistocerca gregaria αL1
subunit expressed in Xenopus oocytes [71]. Nevertheless,
Drosophila nAChR α subunits can form robust functional
channels when coexpressed with a vertebrate β2 subunit
[72] and studies on such hybrid receptors have provided
insights into the selectivity of neonicotinoids for insect
nAChRs over those of vertebrates, regions of subunit proteins involved in imidacloprid interactions and the
actions of different neonicotinoids [73]. These studies
have highlighted Dα1 and Dα2 as being sensitive to imidacloprid. Also, Mpα2, which is the aphid Myzus persicae
ortholog of Dα1, shows high levels of imidacloprid binding when coexpressed with the rat β2 subunit [74]. The
functional expression of nAChRs with insect β subunits
has yet to be achieved but it is worth noting that the
ortholog of Dβ2 is an α subunit (e.g. Tcasα8 in Tribolium)
in all insects so far studied outside the Drosophila genus
[36]. Since members of the Dβ2 group are closely related
to those of the Dα1 and Dα2 groups (Fig. 5) and share an
insertion in loop F which may contribute to imidacloprid
sensitivity [38], it would be of interest to determine
whether Tcasα8 is sensitive to neonicotinoids. If this is the
case, it would also be worth studying Tcasα11, which
appears to be a product of gene duplication of Tcasα8,
and assessing how both subunits contribute to neonicotinoid sensitivity particularly in light of the finding that
gene duplication has given rise to insecticide resistance at
another synaptic target site, acetylcholinesterase [75].
Parental RNAi, where RNA interference arising from double-stranded RNA introduced into the mother also

[27,76]. The combination of genome information and the
use of RNAi in C. elegans has proved considerably instructive in determining roles played by genes [77,78]. Thus,
the beetle provides a powerful tool for studying gene function in an insect pest species. For example, RNAi could be
used to elucidate the roles played by Tribolium cys-loop
LGIC subunits in various aspects of development, behaviour and response to insecticides. Recently, it has been
shown that a Drosophila Dα6 knockout mutant is highly
resistant to spinosad [79]. Studies have shown that T. castaneum is susceptible to spinosad, although to a lesser
degree than other insect pests of stored wheat [80]. It will
be of interest to determine the effect of silencing Tcasα6
on the beetle's susceptibility to spinosad and perhaps validate in a pest species findings based on the Drosophila
genetic model organism.

Conclusion
Using information from the Tribolium castaneum genome
sequencing project, we report, for the first time from an
invertebrate pest species, a complete cys-loop LGIC superfamily, which encodes for receptors that play important
roles in the nervous system as well as for targets of widelyused insecticides. The present study enhances our understanding of the functional genomics of the insect cys-loop
LGIC superfamily. Our findings reveal an emerging consensus that in over 300 million years of insect evolution,
the cys-loop LGIC superfamily has remained compact
with only minor changes in gene numbers. However,
alternative splicing, RNA editing and the presence of
divergent subunits broadens the cys-loop LGIC proteome
and generates species-specific receptor isoforms. Thus, the
paper provides several new insights into the molecular
diversity of cys-loop LGICs between different organisms
and provides an important foundation for associating particular cys-loop LGIC subtypes with development as well
as for the generation of improved insecticides that target
the red flour beetle.

Methods
Identification of cys-loop LGIC subunits in the T.
castaneum genome
To identify putative cys-loop LGIC subunits, we screened
the T. castaneum genome (assembly version 2.0) [81] with
cDNA sequences of every member of the D. melanogaster
and A. mellifera cys-loop LGIC superfamilies using the
tBLASTn algorithm [28]. Candidate beetle cys-LGIC subunits were identified based on their considerable sequence
homology with previously characterized subunits
(sequences with lowest similarity had E Value 8e-19), particularly in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain and
the four transmembrane regions. The highly variable Nterminal signal peptides, which are a feature of cys-loop
LGIC subunits, were identified in the GLEAN consensus
set of predicted genes [27]. RT-PCRs were performed [see

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/327

Additional file 1 for primers used] to verify and correct the
open-reading frame sequences of each subunit.
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from 15 Tribolium castaneum
adult beetles (Georgia GA2 strain) homogenized in Trizol
(Invitrogen) using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and first
strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using
Superscript™ III First-Strand Synthesis Super Mix (Invitrogen). Nested RT-PCR reactions were performed to detect
transcripts of beetle cys-loop LGIC subunits as well as to
detect transcript variants arising from alternative splicing.
Primer pairs [see Additional files 1 and 3 for primer
sequences] recognising different exons were used to allow
identification of cDNA-specific products. The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 µl composed
of Taq polymerase and 1 × PCR buffer (Sigma), 0.2 mM
dNTP mix (Roche), 0.4 µM each primer and 2 µl first
strand cDNA template. The PCR reaction conditions were
35 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 90 s.
The first PCR was used at a final dilution of 1 in 5000 as
template for the second, nested PCR reaction. For
Tcas_RDL and Tcas_GluCl, a 1 in 500 dilution was used to
amplify enough DNA for sequencing. DNA sequence
chromatograms for each cys-loop LGIC subunit were analyzed using Chromas 2 (Technelysium Pty Ltd) to detect
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or RNA editing
sites as shown by mixed signal peaks. No SNPs were
observed and the putative RNA editing sites detected in
Tcasα6 and Tcasβ1 were verified by amplifying and
sequencing genomic DNA present in the extracted total
RNA, which was first treated with DNase-free RNase
(Roche), using primers recognising intron DNA [see Additional file 4 for primers used]. Sequence chromatograms
showing a defined region of mixed peaks indicated differential splicing. The corresponding cys-loop LGIC PCR
products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega) and between 10 to 20 transformants were
sequenced to identify individual subunit isoforms. All
PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a TAE
gel and then purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen) while subunits cloned in pGEM-T Easy were
purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen).
Purified DNA was sequenced by the dye termination
method at Cogenics [82]. For analyzing RNA editing levels in Tcasα6 splice variants, RT-PCR was performed using
forward primers specific to either exon 3a or exon 3b and
reverse primers recognising one of the three alternatives
for exon 8 [see Additional file 3 for primers used]. A
nested PCR approach was adopted since two rounds of
PCR were required to amplify enough variant containing
exon 8c for visualization on an agarose gel. The proofreading Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used in
2 × 30-cycle reactions on four independently made firststrand cDNAs. The sequence chromatograms of the

amplification products were analyzed to give editing levels where the proportion edited = height of guanosine
peak/(height of guanosine peak + height of adenosine
peak). One-way and two-way ANOVA analyses were performed with Turkey's Multiple Comparison and Bonferroni tests respectively using Graphpad Prism 4 [83].
Products amplified by either one or two PCR reactions
gave similar editing levels.

Sequence analysis
The multiple protein sequence alignment was constructed
with ClustalX [84] using the slow-accurate mode with a
gap opening penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of
0.1 as well as applying the Gonnet 250 protein weight
matrix [85]. The protein alignment was viewed using
GeneDoc [86]. Identity values between subunit sequences
were calculated using the GeneDoc program. The neighbour-joining method [87] and bootstrap resampling [88],
available with the ClustalX program, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree, which was then displayed using
the TreeView application [89]. Signal peptide cleavage
sites were predicted using the SignalP 3.0 server [90] and
membrane-spanning regions were predicted using the
TMpred program [91]. The PROSITE database [92] was
used to identify potential phosphorylation sites.
