Abstract
Background: The soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 3 (AG-3) is an important pathogen of cultivated plants
in the family Solanaceae. Isolates of R. solani AG-3 are taxonomically related based on the composition of cellular fatty
acids, phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and beta-tubulin gene sequences, and somatic hyphal
interactions. Despite the close genetic relationship among isolates of R. solani AG-3, field populations from potato and
tobacco exhibit comparative differences in their disease biology, dispersal ecology, host specialization, genetic diversity
and population structure. However, little information is available on how field populations of R. solani AG-3 on potato
and tobacco are shaped by population genetic processes. In this study, two field populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato
in North Carolina (NC) and the Northern USA; and two field populations from tobacco in NC and Southern Brazil were
examined using sequence analysis of two cloned regions of nuclear DNA (pP42F and pP89).
Results: Populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato were genetically diverse with a high frequency of heterozygosity,
while limited or no genetic diversity was observed within the highly homozygous tobacco populations from NC and
Brazil. Except for one isolate (TBR24), all NC and Brazilian isolates from tobacco shared the same alleles. No alleles were
shared between potato and tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3, indicating no gene flow between them. To infer
historical events that influenced current geographical patterns observed for populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato,
we performed an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and a nested clade analysis (NCA). Population differentiation
was detected for locus pP89 (ΦST = 0.257, significant at P < 0.05) but not for locus pP42F (ΦST = 0.034, not significant).
Results based on NCA of the pP89 locus suggest that historical restricted gene flow is a plausible explanation for the
geographical association of clades. Coalescent-based simulations of genealogical relationships between populations of R.
solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco were used to estimate the amount and directionality of historical migration patterns
in time, and the ages of mutations of populations. Low rates of historical movement of genes were observed between
the potato and tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3.
Conclusion: The two sisters populations of the basidiomycete fungus R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco represent
two genetically distinct and historically divergent lineages that have probably evolved within the range of their particular
related Solanaceae hosts as sympatric species.

Background
Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is a species complex composed of
genetically distinct groups of fungi in the cantherelloid
clade of the phylum Basidiomycota [1]. Current classification within the R. solani species complex is based largely
on grouping of isolates into anastomosis groups (AG)
based on their hyphal interactions. At least 13 AG have
been described within the R. solani species complex
including AG-1 to AG-13 [2-4]. Current knowledge suggests that AG and their subgroups represent independent
evolutionary units within R. solani [5,6]. Anastomosis
group 3 (AG-3) of Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is associated
primarily with diseases of Solanaceous plants. Two well
defined phylogenetic (sister) groups of R. solani AG-3 that
cause diseases associated with potato and tobacco have
been identified recently by analysis of sequence variation
in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) [6-8] and beta-tubulin genes
[9]: the AG-3 PT and TB. Isolates from the two hosts are
closely related, but differ in their dispersal, epidemiology,
fatty acid composition, and AFLP patterns [10-16]. Moreover, the host range of isolates of R. solani from potato and
tobacco does not overlap, suggesting that they may represent genetically subdivided populations that have evolved
a high level of specificity on different Solanaceous plant
hosts [3,8,16,17].
The ecology and epidemiology of R. solani AG-3 on potato
and tobacco has been extensively studied [3]. In general,
isolates of R. solani AG-3 from potato are predominantly
asexual and survive as mycelium and sclerotia in soil and
on potato seed tubers [18]. When the sexual stage (teleomorph=Thanatephorus cucumeris Frank Donk) is formed
during periods of cool and moist weather, meiospores
(i.e., basidiospores) have limited dispersal and do not
contribute directly to disease epidemics on potato [19].
However, sexual spores produced as a result of heterothallic mating, might constitute an important aspect of fungal
life history that contributes to the genetic diversity and
structure of field populations of R. solani AG-3 on potato.
Ceresini et al [12] have recently suggested a model of population structure that includes both recombination and
clonality for R. solani AG-3 on potato that provides experimental support for this assertion.
In contrast, isolates of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco are predominantly sexual and basidiospores of T. cucumeris serve
as infectious propagules that initiate disease on tobacco
leaves. However, the mating system of T. cucumeris from
tobacco is not known. Likewise, it is not known whether
recombination associated with sexual reproduction
occurs among field isolates of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco
[5,20].
Despite the evidence for genetic division among populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco, many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

questions remain regarding their population biology and
genetics. For example, although recombination had been
detected within populations of R. solani AG-3 from
potato, the role of asexual and sexual reproduction in
determining population structure of R. solani AG-3 from
potato is not known. Similarly, questions remain about
the extent of gene flow among populations of R. solani
AG-3 from tobacco and between populations of AG-3
from potato and tobacco.
For R. solani AG-3 from potato, a recent study supports the
concept of migration of the pathogen on potato seed
tubers from source populations from Northern US (Maine
and Wisconsin) and Canada into NC, which provides evidence (based on classical F statistics) for a low level of
genetic differentiation between source and recipient populations [21]. However, the causal role of contemporary
gene flow on the observed population structure has not
been determined. Traditional F statistics do not use temporal information on allelic variation, which would allow
for inferences of evolutionary relationships. For example,
there is no information revealing how current geographical patterns of genetic diversity in R. solani AG-3 from
potato is influenced by population structure, history, and
by a combination of structural and historical events.
In this study, four hypotheses were tested: 1) populations
of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco have different
levels of genetic diversity; 2)populations of AG-3 from
potato and tobacco differ in their extent of recombination; 3) there is no gene flow between populations of R.
solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco; and 4) there is no
significant association between haplotypes of AG-3 from
potato and geographic location.
The tobacco population of R. solani AG-3 is hypothesized
to have a higher level of genetic diversity and a predominant recombining structure due to the importance of sexual spores on disease epidemics. In contrast, populations
of R. solani AG-3 from potato are hypothesized to have
lower level of genetic diversity and a non-recombining
structure, probably due to the predominant clonal reproduction system. The complete absence of gene flow
between AG-3 from potato and tobacco is hypothesized as
the reason for these populations being genetically unconnected. The hypothesis of no geographical association
implies that populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato
constitutes one single panmictic population with no
genetic subdivision.
Therefore our goal was to analyze and further elucidate
the phylogeography of populations of R. solani AG-3 from
potato and tobacco. To address these phylogeographical
hypotheses, we have focused on the observation, description and analysis of the spatial distribution of genotypes

of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco and the inference of historical scenarios based on coalescent gene
genealogies [22,23]. In this study, we examined the
sequence variation of two cloned nuclear DNA fragments
from R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco. These
regions of the genome were selected based on a priori
information from seven PCR-RFLP markers previously
used for genotyping R. solani AG-3 from potato and
tobacco [12].

35.56%) and 22 at pP89 (or 22.45%) were unique to a
single sample.
For the potato sample of R. solani AG-3, 14 unique haplotypes were identified for locus pP42F and 20 for locus
pP89 (Table 1); whereas, for AG-3 from tobacco only two
haplotypes were identified at both pP42F and pP89. Consequently, higher haplotype diversity was observed for
AG-3 from potato (0.942 ± 0.026 at pP42F and 0.963 ±
0.029 at pP89). In contrast, for AG-3 from tobacco, a considerably smaller value of haplotype diversity (0.133 ±
0.112) was observed at both pP42F and pP89. The average
π value between two random samples was 0.01340 at
pP42F and 0.00706 at pP89 for AG-3 from potato,
whereas for R. solani AG-3 from tobacco smaller π values
ranging from 0.00196 (pP89) to 0.00366 (pP42F) were
observed. For R. solani AG-3 from potato, the average
number of nucleotide differences (k) was 5.373 [V(k) =
1.947] at pP42F and 7.64 [V(k) = 2.759] at pP89. The
average k values for AG-3 from tobacco were smaller and
ranged from 1.467 [V(k) = 0.559] at pP42F to 2.133 [V(k)
= 0.813] at pP89. Of the total aligned 401 positions at
pP42F, 20 (or 4.99%) were polymorphic for AG-3 from
potato and 11 (or 2.74%) for AG-3 from tobacco. At
pP89, from a total of 1086 positions, 32 (or 2.95%) were
variable for R. solani AG-3 from potato and 16 (or 1.47%)
for AG-3 from tobacco.

Results
Measures of nucleotide diversity and intragenic
recombination
For the total population of 28 isolates of R. solani AG-3
sampled, 16 unique haplotypes were identified for locus
pP42F and 22 for locus pP89 (Table 1). The haplotype
(gene) diversity was 0.856 ± 0.048 and 0.869 ± 0.048 at
pP42F and pP89, respectively. The average number of substitutions per site (π value) between two random samples
was 0.03769 at pP42F and 0.03486 at pP89. The average
number of nucleotide differences (k) was 15.113 [with a
total variance V(k) of 5.403] at pP42F whereas at pP89 k
was 37.862 (V(k) = 13.268). Of the total aligned 401 positions at pP42F, 45 (or 11.22%) were polymorphic. At
pP89, from a total of 1086 positions, 98 (or 9.02%) were
variable. Of the variable positions, 16 at pP42F (or

The spectrum of polymorphism along each locus (which
was measured as π along a sliding window of 25 positions; Figure 1) contrasts the high nucleotide diversity of
the combined total sample of R. solani AG-3 with the
potato and tobacco samples separately. Most of the nucleotide diversity was observed between samples of potato
and tobacco R. solani AG-3. Within-sample comparison
indicated higher nucleotide diversity for R. solani AG-3
from potato than for R. solani AG-3 from tobacco. For AG3 from potato, recombination sites along the loci are indicated by geometric figures within the sliding windows. A
minimum of four recombination events (Rm, [24]) was
detected at pP42F: between sites 29 and 84, 84 and 203,
230 and 280, 285 and 319. The recombination parameter,
R [25], was estimated as 19.3 per gene and 0.0482
between adjacent sites. At pP89, a minimum of six recombination events were detected: between sites 16 and 190,
190 and 444, 469 and 569, 647 and 800, 816 and 845,
845 and 1055. The estimate of R was 30.2 per gene resulting in 0.0277 between adjacent sites. In contrast, no
recombination events were detected for AG-3 from
tobacco. The estimate of R, per gene, was 0.001 and 0.000
between adjacent sites at both pP42F and pP89.
Phylogenetic analysis
Two major clades in R. solani AG-3 were inferred from the
Bayesian phylogenetics analysis of the sequence variation
at the two cloned nuclear DNA fragments pP42F and
pP89 (Figure 2-A and 2B): the potato and tobacco clades.
There was strong support (credibility value = 1.00) for the
splitting of the potato and tobacco groups of R. solani AG3 haplotypes (represented by 16 or 56 changes in the
pP42F and pP89 loci, respectively). There were few other
well-supported branches or clades (by high Bayesian credibility values) indicated in the phylogenetic gene tree. For
pP89 (e.g.), one of these well-supported clades included
only haplotypes from Northern US (89P0061, 89P0062,
89P0472, 89P08310, 89P0471, and 89P0342). There was
strong support for a bifurcating branch that split the
tobacco isolates into two distinct groups; one of which
contained a haplotype detected in Brazil.
Intraspecific evolution of R. solani AG-3 inferred by
analysis of haplotype networks
The reconstruction of haplotypes network of both pP42F
and pP89 loci by statistical parsimony (Figure 3-A and 3B)
supported the hypothesis of divergent evolution of genes
from R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco. The degree
of evolutionary relatedness was represented by mutational connections. There was no mutational connection
linking any of the haplotypes of R. solani AG-3 from
potato with haplotypes from tobacco in this network. The
number of mutations splitting these two groups exceeded
the calculated maximum connection steps (at 95%) of
eight for pP42F haplotypes and 14 for pP89. The two hap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

lotypes identified in the tobacco sample were also unconnected. This method also allows for the identification of
the putative ancestral haplotype based on its frequency in
the population. The most frequent allele is, theoretically,
the oldest and could be identified, as the most interior to
the network, showing several mutational connections
[26]. However, the high gene diversity within R. solani AG3 from potato did not allow for precise identification of
the ancestral haplotype. Within-sample analysis of R.
solani AG-3 from potato identified probable recombinants
through observations of sequence homoplasy in the networks of both pP42F (point a) and pP89 loci (points a, b,
c, d, and e).
Population structure
Analysis of the population structure using AMOVA was
conducted independently for both pP42F and pP89 loci.
By grouping molecular sequencing haplotypes of R. solani
based on their host of origin (either from potato or
tobacco), most of the molecular variation was detected
between potato and tobacco populations (87.7 to 92.0%
of the total variance), with very little variation among geographical populations within each group (0.4 to 1.7%).
The within-population variance corresponded to 11.9 and
6.3% of the total variance for pP42F and pP89 respectively. The overall ΦST was 0.88 for pP42F and 0.94 for
pP89 (P ≤ 0.001).

Pairwise comparison between geographic populations
was performed using estimates of FST equivalents (pairwise ΦST values) for both pP42F and pP89 loci separately
(Table 2). Pairwise ΦST values were significantly greater
than zero, which would indicate population differentiation, mainly for comparisons between potato and tobacco
populations of R. solani. For example, the potato populations from Northern US or Eastern NC were significantly
different from both tobacco populations from Central NC
or Southern Brazil. There was no indication of differentiation between the tobacco populations of Central NC and
Southern Brazil. In contrast, while no subdivision or differentiation was observed between the potato populations from Northern US and Eastern NC for the pP42F
locus (ΦST = 0.034, not significant), differentiation
between these two populations was observed for the pP89
locus (ΦST = 0.257, significant at P < 0.05).
Nested clade analysis
To discriminate between phylogenetic patterns resulting
from historical events from those due to recurrent gene
flow, we performed nested clade analysis on the haplotype network of R. solani AG-3 from potato obtained by
statistical parsimony analysis and presented in Figure 3-B.
The resulting nesting design and the NCA are presented in
Figure 4. No NCA was performed for the pP42F haplotype
network (Figure 3-A) due to no population subdivision

observed between Eastern NC and Northern US for this
locus.
For the NCA of pP89, high sequence variation was
observed, and such variation has caused a few cases of
ambiguity (probably due to recombination) in the network estimation. As the NCA does not accommodate
recombination, haplotypes P0471, P1511 and P1512
were removed from the reticulate network presented in
Figure 3-B. A significant geographical association pattern
indicating restricted gene flow with isolation by distance
was found (Figure 4). The interior haplotypes P0062 and
P08310 from Northern America contained in the one-step
clade 1-1 showed significantly large (P < 0.05) Dc. In addition, these internal haplotypes showed larger Dc than the
average clade distance for the tip haplotype P0061 that
has presumably descended from it [i.e. (Int - Tip)c significantly large at P < 0.05]. At the higher level, within the
entire cladogram nesting, the tip clade 3-2 (that included
the two-step level clades 2–3 and 2–4, containing only
haplotypes from Camden, NC), showed significantly
small Dc, indicating restricted gene flow as well. In contrast, clade 3-1 showed a significantly large Dc, which
would indicate a long distance dispersal event, probably
from Wisconsin to Maine, which contained the tip haplotypes. Clade 3-1 includes the two-step clades 2-1 (composed by one-step clades 1-1 and 1–2) and 2-2 (which
contained the one-step clade 1–3). This 3-step clade contained haplotypes only observed in Northern America.
Coalescent analysis
Neutrality tests were performed for each locus and populations of R. solani AG-3, indicating neutral evolution of
both loci for the populations from potato. Evidence of
non-neutral evolution was found in both pP42F and pP89
loci for the pooled populations of AG-3 from tobacco
[Table 3]. For these two loci in the tobacco (TB) group the

significant statistical values were negative. A significant
test result is consistent with either population growth or
shrinkage, or background selection [27]. We hypothesized
that the deviation from neutrality observed for the TB
group was due to a decline in effective population size.
This hypothesis was supported by the exponential population growth estimates (g) [28,29]. The g values for both
pP42F and pP89 were negative for the TB group, indicating population shrinkage [Table 4]. In contrast, positive g
values indicated that the populations from potato were
growing. However, g values are not symmetrical in magnitude due to its exponential effect on the population
growth [Thetat = Thetapresenttime exp(-gt), t = a time before
present]. Thus, a g = 10 would indicates a rather slow
growth while a g = -10 indicates a significant shrinkage of
the population.
The population parameter Theta was used as a relative
measure of effective population size. The estimates of
Theta are summarized in Table 4. The pattern observed for
the pP42F locus suggests a larger effective population size
for the pooled R. solani AG-3 populations (Northern US +
Eastern NC) from potato (Theta = 0.01412) when compared to the pooled AG-3 populations (US + Brazil) from
tobacco (Theta = 0.00422). However, for the pP89 locus
the Theta values ranged from 0.00155 to 0.00206 for the
populations of AG-3 from potato from Eastern NC and
Northern US, respectively, and 0.00176 for the pooled
population samples of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco.
Estimates of directional gene flow between populations of
R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco were consistent
with relatively low rates of migration between them and
ranged from 0 to 0.0994. When the pooled populations of
R. solani AG-3 from potato were compared with the
pooled populations from tobacco for the pP42F locus, the
estimates of directional gene flow (since the divergence of

pP42F) and +G+I (for pP89) for DNA bases substitution. Values on the x-axis indicate expected changes per site. Values above particular tree partitions (varying from 0 to 1.0) are posterior probability credibility values for the clades generated
by Bayesian MCMCMC analyses. For example, a credibility value of 0.99 indicates the proportion of trees sampled (a total of
10892 among 11002 total trees), which contains the partition for the respective clade.

haplotypes T025 and TBR24 were kept unconnected to the nested network because of the large mutational distance (a maximum of eight steps for pP42F and 14 for pP89) that separates them from the AG-3 PT haplotype by statistical parsimony analysis.

Results 4
Results of the nested cladistic analysis of geographical distance for pP89 haplotypes of Rhizoctonia solani AG-3
from potato. The haphotype designations are given at the top and are boxed together to reflect one-step nested design.
Higher-level clade designations are given as moving down the figure, with boxed grouping indicating the nesting structure.
Immediately below each clade designation is the clade (Dc) and nested clade (Dn) distances respectively. An S indicates the distance is significantly small at the 5% level, and an L indicates that it is significantly large. For nested clades in which the tip/interior status is known and for which both tips and interior exists within the same nesting groups, the clade name and distances
are shaded for interior clades and are left unshaded for tip clades. At the bottom of the boxes that indicate the nested groups
containing both tip and interior clades the lines indicated by (Int - Tip)c and (Int - Tip)n give the average difference in distances
between the interior clades and tip clades within the nested group for clade distances and nested clade distances, respectively.
NA stands for non-applicable. The chain of inference for clades with significant historical pattern (e.g. clades 1-1 and total
cladogram for pP89 haplotypes) follows the key provided in the Appendix of Templeton [34].
R. solani AG-3) were very low, with a historical movement
of genes from the pooled potato populations (source) to
the pooled tobacco populations (recipient) of R. solani
AG-3 (4Nm1→2 = 0.0994). For the pP89 locus, there was
no evidence of migration between either of the two populations from potato to the pooled populations from
tobacco. However, the migration parameter was estimated
to be 0.0417 (4Nm3→2) from the pooled tobacco populations to the Eastern NC potato population. While the
highest historical migration contribution was observed
from the Eastern NC to the Northern US potato population of AG-3 (migration rate 4Nm2→1 = 5.1115), a much
smaller migration value was observed in the opposite
direction (4Nm1→2 = 0.1258).
From the coalescent analyses, the overall tree topologies
and the relative divergence of R. solani AG-3 from potato
and tobacco were consistent for both pP42F and pP89
loci. The ancestral distribution of mutation and coalescent
events for the two loci are presented in Figure 5. The
branching between the populations of R. solani AG-3 from

potato and tobacco occurred at the deepest point, suggesting an ancient divergence between them. The tobacco
populations of AG-3 represent the oldest lineages within
the trees (when compared with the populations from
potato), and estimates of divergence are five times greater
in magnitude. The relative ages of the populations from
tobacco varied from 0.05 (for the pP89 locus) to 0.34
units of coalescent time (for the pP42F locus). Populations from potato have experienced a recent expansion as
demonstrated by the diversification of haplotypes in both
gene trees and were inferred to be younger than those
from tobacco.

Discussion
We have studied two closely related sister groups within
the basidiomycete fungus R. solani AG-3 on taxonomically
related hosts and this system provided us with a unique
opportunity to examine aspects of their population genetics in a phylogeographic framework.

mutations designations are correspondent to respective site numbers described in the additional files 1 and 2. The inferred gene genealogies are based on
100,000 simulations of the coalescent with Waterston's estimates of Θ (M) = 2.57 for pP42F and 2.27 for pP89. The time scale is expressed in coalescent
units of 4N (where N is the populations size). The letters below the tree designate the distinct haplotypes, their total or geographically distinct observed

pooling the two populations of the pathogen for the pP42F locus.

During the process of screening of markers for population
genetics, four of seven PCR-RFLP markers previously used
for genotyping isolates of R. solani AG-3 from potato
(pP42, pP46, pP47 and pP89) also amplified genomic
DNA from R. solani AG-3 from tobacco. Except for marker
pP42F, none of the alleles present in the sample of 20
tobacco isolates of R. solani AG-3 from tobacco were
shared with the potato sample [12]. As these markers were
shown to be conserved enough to amplify genes across
potato and tobacco populations of AG-3, we explored
their potential appropriateness for phylogenetic and population genetics analyses within R. solani AG-3. For this
study, we selected two (pP42 and pP89) of these four
genetic markers. An important outcome from the
sequencing analysis of these two markers (pP42 mad
pP89) was the increasing power for discriminating alleles
within a locus. Genotyping by PCR-RFLPs indicated the
occurrence of only two or three alleles (for pP42F and
pP89 loci, respectively) within a potato population of R.
solani AG-3 from NC [12]. However, genotyping by
sequencing analysis indicated that the actual number of
alleles present within that population was much higher,
with 14 at pP42F and 20 at pP89.
The first objective of this study was to determine the
extent of genetic divergence between populations of R.
solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco. The potato sample
was more genetically diverse showing a higher number of
nucleotide differences among haplotypes, which resulted
in high haplotype (gene) diversity. In contrast with the
sample from potato, limited to no genetic diversity was
observed within the tobacco sample from NC and Brazil.
The number of nucleotide differences was considerably
smaller for tobacco than for potato isolates of R. solani
AG-3. Only two haplotypes were found for the tobacco
population in Brazil, with a single haplotype predominating in North America. Our results support the first
hypothesis that populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato
and tobacco have different levels of molecular diversity.
Consistent with the heterokaryotic nature of R. solani,
every isolate of AG-3 from potato had at least one heterozygous locus. However, all tobacco isolates from both NC
and Brazil were homozygous.
The other specific objective of this study was to determine
how populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and
tobacco are shaped by recombination. We addressed this
objective by analyzing the intragenic recombination at
pP42 and pP89 loci. This analysis was done by determining both the recombination parameter R within a locus
[25] and the minimum number of recombination events
between two adjacent sites at the same locus [24].
The tobacco population of R. solani AG-3 was hypothesized to have a predominantly recombining structure due

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

to the importance of sexual spores in disease epidemics.
In theory, progeny generated via this type of reproduction
would be genetically different than parental individuals as
a result of recombination of genetically different nuclei
[5,30-32]. In contrast, the potato population of AG-3 was
hypothesized to have a non-recombining structure, probably because of the predominant clonal reproduction system.
Higher values of R were detected for the population of R.
solani AG-3 from potato. In addition, a minimum of four
recombination events were detected between sites along
the pP42 locus and six recombination events at pP89 for
the isolates of AG-3 from potato. Putative recombinants
were also identified through observations of homoplasy
in the networks of both pP42F and pP89 loci (Fig.4. 4A–
B). In contrast, no recombination events were detected for
AG-3 isolates from tobacco. Our data support the alternative hypotheses of a sexual recombining structure for R.
solani AG-3 from potato. This is in agreement with the
common occurrence and observation of the sexual stage
in potato fields and previous research results that suggested recombination was occurring in population of AG3 from potato based on analyses of the population structure of the fungus with seven co-dominant PCR-RFLP
markers [12]. All seven loci were found in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and no linkage disequilibrium was
detected for any pair of loci [12].
In contrast with the potato population, we found no evidence of recombination for the tobacco population. Fungal progeny generated via asexual or homothallic sexual
(self-fertile, inbreeding) reproduction would be nearly
genetically identical to the parental individuals (and all
parts of the genome will have similar evolutionary history) in the absence of outcrossing. No or limited outcrossing would contribute to the association between
independent characters (genetic markers), a population
with limited genetic diversity and the repeated recovery of
similar genotypes (e.g. clonal population structure) and
new genotype in the population would arise mainly as a
result of mutation [32].
Our previous observation indicated a clonal population
structure for AG-3 from tobacco in NC based on the oneto-one (strict) association between two independent criteria (somatic incompatibility and AFLP markers) [11].
However, our current data is not sufficient for supporting
the alternative hypothesis of clonality for AG-3 from
tobacco because only two haplotypes were detected for
each locus in the tobacco populations. The limited
amount of genetic variation in this sample would not be
sufficient to accurately assess the relative contribution of
recombination in the pathogen population.

The third hypothesis tested in this study was that no gene
flow occurs between populations of R. solani AG-3 from
potato and tobacco, indicating that they constitute genetically distinct groups. The objective was to describe this
pair of populations of R. solani AG-3 by the proportion of
loci that show unilateral or reciprocal fixation, and by
standard estimates of statistics based on gene flow.
In recently evolved species pairs it is expected to identify
variable nucleotide positions where polymorphisms are
shared by both sibling species, other nucleotide positions
where only one species is polymorphic and the other is
fixed for one allele, and where both species have fixed loci
[11,33]. An analysis of the DNA polymorphisms at each
locus, suggested that most of the nucleotide diversity
occurred between samples of potato and tobacco R. solani
AG-3. As genetic isolation is considered to precede the loss
of shared polymorphism, discovering a single locus or
multiple loci that show fixation in one or the other of the
phylogenetic species would be evidence of genetic isolation [11,33]. No alleles were shared between the potato
and tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3 used in this
study. In addition, analysis of population structure indicated no gene flow between populations of R. solani AG-3
from potato and tobacco. Most of the molecular variation
and differentiation was detected between potato and
tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3. In contrast, a high
level of gene flow was detected for tobacco group of R.
solani AG-3. With only one exception (isolate TBR24), all
of the isolates from NC and the Brazilian population of
AG-3 from tobacco shared the same alleles at both pP42
and pP89 loci.
From the Bayesian phylogenetics analysis of cloned
nuclear DNA fragments pP42F and pP89, two major
clades in R. solani AG-3 were inferred, splitting haplotypes
from potato and tobacco into two groups. In addition, the
reconstruction of the haplotype network of both pP42F
and pP89 loci by statistical parsimony indicated no mutational connection linking any of the haplotypes of R.
solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco in this network.
These results support the hypothesis of divergent evolution of genes from populations of R. solani AG-3 from
potato and tobacco.
The fourth hypothesis tested was that there is no significant association between haplotypes of AG-3 from potato
and geographic origin, which implies that there is a single
panmictic population with no genetic subdivision.
Based on F statistics, an important observation about gene
flow was inferred from the within-group analysis of population subdivision of the sample of R. solani AG-3 from
potato. While gene flow (ΦST = 0.03414, not significant)
was detected between populations of R. solani AG-3 from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

potato at the pP42F locus, population differentiation was
detected for the locus pP89.
To infer historical events influencing the current geographical patterns observed on populations of the pathogen, we performed NCA analysis on a reticulated
phylogeny of AG-3 haplotypes from potato. The main
benefit of using haplotype tree information is its qualitative advantage of discriminating among various biological
explanations for any detected geographical association. By
using a haplotype network analysis it was possible to
examine spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation
in populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato whereas the
F-statistics analysis could only examine the current spatial
pattern.
Based on NCA, the null hypothesis of no association
between haplotype variation and geography was rejected
for pP89 locus. For this locus, the first prediction for the
population structure hypothesis was that restricted gene
flow caused the geographical associations. Within clade 11 from Northern America, clade distance equal to zero
was associated with the tip pP89 haplotype P0061
whereas significantly large clade distance was associated
with the interior haplotypes P0062 and P08310. In addition, the average interior clade distance minus the average
tip clade distance was significantly large. These observations fulfilled the prediction that under restricted gene
flow younger or tip clades should be less widespread relatively to older clades interior to them [34,35]. This is
because restricted gene flow implies only limited movement by individuals during any giving generation as it
takes time for a new haplotype to spread geographically.
Another aspect of restricted gene flow is that the new haplotypes initially reside within the range of its ancestor for
many generations, which is predicted by the isolation by
distance model. In contrast, the ancestor would have a
wider geographic distribution [36].
At the higher clade level the tip clade 3-2 (that included
the two-step level clades 2–3 and 2–4, containing only
haplotypes from Camden, NC), showed significantly
small Dn, indicating restricted gene flow. In contrast, clade
3-1 showed a significantly large Dn, which would indicate
a long distance dispersal event, probably from Wisconsin
to Maine, which contained the tip haplotypes. However,
conclusions concerning a long distance dispersal event
should be interpreted cautiously since our sampling procedure was geographically limited. Therefore, it may not
be possible to discriminate between isolation by distance
and long distance gene flow models [35].
The patterns of spatial structure and differentiation
between potato populations of R. solani AG-3 revealed by
the two distinct markers were conflicting and deserve fur-

ther discussion. Discordant patterns of divergence in
molecular markers and loci are commonly interpreted as
differences in mutation rate, neutrality or linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are subject to selection, and
the differential effect of natural selection on those markers
and loci [37-40]. Although we do not have ancillary information on whether the genetic loci examined in this study
have distinct mutation rates, our data suggest a model of
neutral evolution for both loci (Table 3). A plausible
explanation for the conflicting patterns of spatial structure
is due to the distinct resolution capabilities associated
with difference in per-locus sequence length. For pP42 we
detected 20 polymorphic sites in 401 bp and for pP89 we
detected 32 segregating sites in 1090 bp. The paucity of
informative sites on pP42F resulting from the analyses of
less sequence length might have introduced a downward
bias in the estimate of population differentiation. Support
for this assertion is based on simulation data on how
many loci are needed and how much sequence is required
from each locus to provide better estimates of population
genetic parameters [41].
In this study, we also conducted coalescent-based simulations of genealogical relationships between populations
of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco to estimate the
amount and directionality of historical migration patterns
in time, the ages of mutations and of populations (Table
4; Figure 5). This is the first time that a genealogical
approach (based on the coalescent model) was used to
study the population genetics and evolution of a Rhizoctonia pathosystem.
Tests of non-neutral evolution could not be rejected for
the two loci, considering only the populations from
tobacco. We believe that the observed patterns of gene
diversity is most likely due to changes in population size
and not to a intrinsic feature of the loci. Given the contemporary Theta values [42] it was possible to extrapolate
the relative increase or decrease in population size since
the time of divergence. Growth rate estimates [28] were
consistent with a significant decrease in size for the
tobacco populations of R. solani AG-3. We hypothesize
that this decrease in size reflects a split where only a small
fraction of the ancestral pathogen population founded a
new population during the domestication of tobacco
from the wild habitats into agricultural fields. In contrast,
results from Lamarc analyses [28] were consistent with
expansion of the potato populations of R. solani AG-3. The
increase in R. solani AG-3 effective population size on
potato was most likely caused by a corresponding increase
in host population size following the expansion of agriculture.
Although characterized as being younger than the tobacco
population of AG-3, the potato population has experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

enced a very recent diversification in the US. In contrast,
the two tobacco populations sampled from Southern Brazil and Central NC (US), had a small effective population
size. Older ancestor populations with higher haplotype
diversity of R. solani (and consequently higher effective
population sizes) might exist in the center of origin of
tobacco and other related Solanaceae.
Our findings corroborate previous information that populations of R. solani AG-3 are subdivided by host specialization,
constituting
two
distinct
phylotypes
[3,7,8,11,16,17]. R. solani AG-3 represents at least two
phylogenetic species that display high phenotypic differences in disease biology and ecology [3,16,17].
Low rates of historical movement of genes were observed
between the potato and tobacco populations of AG-3.
These two populations of R. solani AG-3 represented two
distinctly and historically divergent lineages, which have
probably evolved within the range of their particular hosts
as sympatric species. Reinforcement is considered as an
important mechanism of speciation between sympatrically divergent populations [43]. Reinforcement is the
active mechanism of reproductive isolation due to
reduced fitness of the interspecific hybrids, thereby favoring intraspecific mating and resulting in genetic differentiation between species [44]. Reproductive success
between R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco was not
tested in our study, but this testing could provide knowledge about the mechanisms involved in sympatric speciation of R. solani AG-3.
The contrasting ecological context of these two host specific populations makes our study a good example of ecological speciation between lineages of plant pathogenic
fungal populations. Host range and disease causing ability
are clearly important factors in fungal speciation. Consistent with our study, evidence for lineage divergence
strongly associated with closely-related host species has
been previously reported for other fungi, such as Magnaporthe grisea and Mycosphaerella graminicola [43,45,46].
Several studies have also reported extensive genetic differentiation between divergent fungal species [47-51].
The results presented in this paper provide important
insight into our understanding of the phylogeography of
populations of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco.
The next step of our research will involve a more in depth
study to reveal the origins and patterns of domestication
of these two phylogenetically distinct populations of R.
solani AG-3. Our experimental approach will involve a
global sampling strategy for isolation of R. solani AG-3
from Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Nicotianna tabacum
(tobacco) and including additional host species of Solanum and Nicotiana.

A global phylogeographical framework is critical to
unravel the answers on large scale-hypotheses on the origins and evolution of R. solani AG-3 as a pathogen of
domesticated crops within the Solanaceae. A sampling
initiative towards the understanding of the phylogeography of populations from potato and tobacco should
include the main potato and tobacco growing areas in the
world, besides the centers of origin in the Andes mountain valleys of Bolivia, Peru, Columbia and Ecuador, in
South America (for hosts on both Nicotiana and Solanum
genera) [52]. It also should include Africa and Australia
for the Nicotiana, which is part of a truly widespread tribe
within the Solanaceae with a Gondwanan distribution
(the southern supercontinent, which included most of the
landmasses in today's southern hemisphere) [52].

Conclusion
The two sister populations of the basidiomycete fungus R.
solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco represent two distinct and historically divergent lineages that have probably evolved within the range of their particular related
Solanaceae hosts as sympatric species.

Methods
Isolates and populations
Isolates from four randomly selected population samples
of R. solani AG-3 were analyzed: eight potato isolates from
Eastern NC and five from the Northern US; and six
tobacco isolates from central NC and nine tobacco isolates from southern Brazil (Table 5, Figure 6). These population samples of R. solani AG-3 from potato and tobacco
constituted subsamples of a larger hierarchical sample formerly studied by Ceresini et al [11,12,21].
DNA technique for genotyping
We conducted sequence analysis of two PCR amplified
nuclear DNA fragments: pP42F, with 401 bp, and pP89,
with 1090 bp (Table 6). By BLASTX 2.2.3 [53] analysis
with DNA sequences deposited at GenBank®, the pP42F
marker was found to have sequence similarity to the
nuclear gene lsc2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding
for beta subunit of succinyl-CoA ligase or to a similar gene
from Neocallimastix frontalis; the pP89 marker had
sequence similarity to the nuclear gene crm1 from
Schizosaccharomyces pombe encoding for chromosome
region maintenance protein 1 or exportin 1 (Table 6).

PCR reactions were conduced in a Model 9600 DNA ThermoCycler (Perkin-Elmer) employing standard conditions
described previously for R. solani [12] and using the
Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which contains a thermostable, exonucleasefree, N-terminal deletion mutant of Taq DNA polymerase
and a proofreading polymerase (Pfu) exhibiting 3'-exonuclease activity. After purification by ultrafiltration with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/163

QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN®), the PCR products were sequenced in both directions by the dideoxy
chain terminating method using the Big Dye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and analyzed on an ABI 3700 automatic
sequencer (Perkin Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Sequence
chromatograms were compiled using Sequencher software (vers. 2.0, GeneCodes Corp.).
To separate different pP42F or pP89 alleles within heterogenous PCR reactions, amplicons were cloned into the
PCR2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, San Diego). Plasmids
from selected recombinant One Shot® DH5a™-T1R
Escherichia coli (Invitrogen, San Diego) were extracted
from each sample and purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN®). Selected primers were used to reamplify and sequence the clones from PCR2.1-TOPO® (Table
6). Sequences were aligned using the software Sequencher
(vers. 2.0, GeneCodes Corp.).
Measures of nucleotide diversity and intragenic
recombination
Nucleotide diversity, or the average number of differences
per site between two homologous sequences (π), was calculated using the program DNASP [54] according to the
equation 10.5 of Nei [55]. Diversities were calculated for
the population and separately for the two major clades.
The spectrum of polymorphism along each locus was
measured and represented as π along a sliding window of
25 positions. The minimum number of recombination
events between two adjacent sites (Rm) was calculated
according to Hudson and Kaplan [24,25]. Recombination
parameters were estimated according to Hudson [25].
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. For ML, the
software PAUP* 4.0b10 was used [56]. The Bayesian analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain
method coupled with the Metropolis algorithm (MCMCMC), implemented by the software MrBayes v.2.10 [57].

For both ML and MCMCMC analyses, MODELTEST 3.7
[58] was used to determine the DNA bases substitution
model more fit to the data. A hierarchical likelihood ratio
test implemented by MODELTEST selected the following
models for the markers: a) pP42F: K80 (K2P)+G model
(number of substitution types = 2; transition/transversion
ratio = 3.1683 (kappa = 6.3366); assumed proportion of
invariable sites = none; assumed nucleotides frequencies
= equal; gamma distribution of rates at variable sites,
shape parameter (alpha) = 0.1147; under this evolution
model for base substitution, the ML value for the pP42F
tree was -lnL = 886.9029); b) pP89: K80 (K2P)+G+I

genotypes [63,65,66]. FST ranges from 0.0, in which all
populations appears homogenous, to 1.0, in which all the
variation is among populations.

Intraspecific evolution of R. solani AG-3 inferred by
analysis of haplotype networks
For inferring intraspecific evolution, networks of haplotypes sampled from populations of R. solani AG-3 were
built using the algorithm recommended by Posada &
Crandall [26]. This method starts by estimating the maximum number or differences between haplotypes as a
result of single substitutions (i.e., those not resulting from
multiple substitutions in a single site) with the statistical
significance level of 95% [59]. This is called the limit of
parsimony, or the limit of parsimony connection. Haplotypes differing by only one change are connected, and
then those differing by two, three and so on until all the
haplotypes are included in a single network, or until the
limit of parsimony connection is reached. This method
also allows for the identification of probable recombinants through observations of spatial distribution of the
sequence of homoplasies defined by the network [60].
The estimation of the phylogeny from DNA sequences
was implemented by the computer program TCS [61].

Nested clade analysis
The nested clade analysis (NCA) on haplotypes of R. solani
AG-3 from potato was performed with the objective of
discriminating between phylogenetic patterns that result
from historical events (for example, past fragmentation,
expansion, colonization) and from those due to recurrent
gene flow [34,35]. This analysis utilizes both a phylogeny
and the geographical distribution of haplotypes or haplotype clades. The NCA was completed using the computer
program GeoDis v.2.0 [67] considering the haplotype network (phylogeny) obtained by statistical parsimony analysis as described above. This analysis divides the
phylogeny into nested clades of n steps, where n is equal
to the number of mutations connecting the haplotypes of
a clade. For each clade there is a geographic point around
which all the individuals are centered. Two quantitative
measures of how within-clade haplotypes are geographically dispersed were used: the clade distance = Dc (X),
which describes the average distance of each haplotype
within clade X from the geographic center of clade X; and
the nested clade distance = Dn (X), which similarly
describes the average distance of each haplotype within
clade X from the geographic center of the next more inclusive clade within which the clade X is nested [35]. The
clade distance Dc (X) measures the geographical range of a
particular clade X (average distance that a haplotype lies
from the geographical center of all haplotypes from the
same clade). The nested clade distance Dn (X) measures
how a particular clade X is geographically distributed relatively to its closest evolutionary sister clades (i.e., clades
in the same higher level nesting category). Accordingly,
within each nested category and for both types of distances (Dc and Dn), we calculated and determined the significance of the average interior distance minus the
average tip distance [(Int - Tip)c and (Int - Tip)n]. Contrasts

Population structure
Between-population analyses were conducted to test for
geographic structure in populations of R. solani AG-3.
Pairwise Φ statistics comparisons (F statistics equivalents
[62]) were used to describe the proportion of the total
genetic variance at each locus due to differences among
populations. The sequences were grouped by sample origin into four populations of R. solani AG-3: potato tubers
from the Northern US; potato stems from Eastern NC;
tobacco leaves from Central NC; and tobacco leaves from
Southern Brazil. FST was calculated via analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) using the software package ARLEQUIN [63,64]. AMOVA estimates variance components
considering the number of differences between molecular

of interior versus tip clades within a nested clade strongly
indicate contrasts of older versus younger clades. Haplotypes were assigned to the following populations: Maine
(46.51562 N 68.36468 W), Wisconsin (43.07980 N
89.38751 W), and the North Carolina counties of Washington (35.83681 N 76.56470 W), Tyrrell (35.87039 N
76.16513 W), Hyde (35.40617 N 76.15316 W) and Camden (36.33743 N 76.16263 W). Clade distances were calculated using a distance matrix among populations based
on geographic coordinates. A test of 1000 permutations of
population assignments to haplotypes was used to determine the significance of larger or smaller values of Dc, Dn,
(Int - Tip)c and (Int - Tip)n than would be expected for null
hypothesis of random geographical association of haplotypes [35].
Coalescent analysis
SNAP Workbench Java program package was used to analyze gene genealogies and population parameters [68].
SNAP Map was used to collapse sequences into haplotypes, removing indels and infinite sites violations among
the mutations [69]. Coalescent methods make strict
assumptions, such as neutrality and the lack of recombination (identified based on the detection of homoplasious sites), which must be verified previously. To test for
departures from neutrality, Tajima's D [70] and Fu and
Li's D and F* [59,71] test statistics were calculated using
the statistical tests of neutrality of mutations against
excess of recent mutations (rare alleles), written by YunXin Fu [72]. We hypothesized that any deviation from
neutrality was due to change in effective population size.
This hypothesis was tested using the population growth
estimates inferred by the program Lamarc 2.0 [28,29]. The
Lamarc algorithm permits intragenic recombination and
therefore allowed us to use all polymorphic sites to assess
this population parameter. To estimate the population
growth parameter, we used 10 initial chains with 2,000
genealogies sampled and 2 final chains with 10,000 genealogies sampled. The population growth rates were
inferred using Bayesian analyses, assessing the 95% credibility intervals from the Bayesian search.

solani AG-3 (US + Brazil) for both loci. Data for the potato
populations (Northern US + Eastern NC) were also
pooled for the pP42F marker, but kept separate for the
pP89. Coalescent parameters were estimated for each
locus separately, due to the lack of information on how
the alleles at each locus are linked in the haploid phase of
the fungus. To determine the order of coalescent events
for haplotypes in time it is necessary to determine the
amount of migration that occurred between populations.
Haplotypes from populations linked by migration are
postulated to coalesce before haplotypes from unlinked
populations [73]. Using the program Migrate [74], incorporated in the SNAP Workbench program package, migration matrices were constructed for each locus, indicating
the number of migrants exchanged between populations.
These backward migration matrices were used for ancestral inference in Genetree version 9.0 [74,75], also incorporated in the SNAP Workbench. Subsequently, we
reconstructed the genealogy with the highest root probability, the ages of mutation and the TMRCA (time for the
most recent common ancestor) of the samples using
100,000 coalescent simulations with five runs with distinct starting random number seeds, considering population subdivision and distinct population sizes. The
program allows for the estimation of the ancestral history
of each haplotype. It also shows the distribution of mutations on a coalescent scale, allowing for comparison of the
divergence of haplotypes between and within each population.

original data used to perform the analyses from this study.

PCC, TYJ, RJV, HDS, and MAC designed the study. PCC
was involved in the sampling and carried out the molecular work. PCC and TYJ analyzed the data and drafted the
manuscript. TYJ, RJV, HDS, and MAC helped draft the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

To generate compatible sequences alignments for coalescent analyses, the conflicting sites in each alignment were
manually removed [46]. Conflicting sites showing homoplasy were initially identified among variable sites using
the compatibility methods SNAP Clade and SNAP Matrix
(Figure 7-A and 7B). Nine incompatible sites were
removed from the pP42F dataset, resulting in 33 polymorphic sites after manipulation of the alignments; from a
total of 95 polymorphic sites, 20 incompatible ones were
removed from the pP89 alignment dataset.
Based on the evidence for no geographic population structure, we pooled data for the two tobacco populations of R.
