Abstract
Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea
and it can reside in human, fish, frogs and water. In this study, we performed an in-depth annotation of the genes
in its genome related to adaptation to the various environmental niches.
Results: L. hongkongensis possessed genes for DNA repair and recombination, basal transcription, alternative
s-factors and 109 putative transcription factors, allowing DNA repair and global changes in gene expression in
response to different environmental stresses. For acid stress, it possessed a urease gene cassette and two arc gene
clusters. For alkaline stress, it possessed six CDSs for transporters of the monovalent cation/proton antiporter-2 and
NhaC Na+:H+ antiporter families. For heavy metals acquisition and tolerance, it possessed CDSs for iron and nickel
transport and efflux pumps for other metals. For temperature stress, it possessed genes related to chaperones and
chaperonins, heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins. For osmotic stress, 25 CDSs were observed, mostly
related to regulators for potassium ion, proline and glutamate transport. For oxidative and UV light stress, genes for
oxidant-resistant dehydratase, superoxide scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, exclusion and export of
redox-cycling antibiotics, redox balancing, DNA repair, reduction of disulfide bonds, limitation of iron availability
and reduction of iron-sulfur clusters are present. For starvation, it possessed phosphorus and, despite being
asaccharolytic, carbon starvation-related CDSs.
Conclusions: The L. hongkongensis genome possessed a high variety of genes for adaptation to acid, alkaline,
temperature, osmotic, oxidative, UV light and starvation stresses and acquisition of and tolerance to heavy metals.

Background
In 2001, Laribacter hongkongensis, a novel genus and
species that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of
b-subclass of the Proteobacteria, was discovered from
the blood and empyema pus of a patient with underlying alcoholic cirrhosis [1]. Subsequently, it was observed
that L. hongkongensis was associated with communityacquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea in human
[2-5]. L. hongkongensis is capable of living under a
variety of ecological niches. In addition to humans,

L. hongkongensis resides in the intestines of a variety of
freshwater fish, most commonly those of the carp
family, including grass carps (Ctenoharyngodon idellus),
bighead carps (Aristichthys nobilis) and mud carps
(Cirrhina molitorella), as well as those of frogs [4,6-9].
Moreover, it can also survive and replicate as a free living bacterium in water obtained from drinking water
reservoirs [10]. To survive in these ecological niches,
L. hongkongensis needs the capability of protecting DNA
damages by endogenous and exogenous metabolites and
regulating the expression of a variety of genes, which
makes it able to adapt to different temperatures, pH and
osmotic pressures, as well as oxidative and ultraviolet
light stresses.

In this article, we present an overview of the genes of
the L. hongkongensis genome related to DNA repair and
recombination and regulation of gene expression. In
addition, the putative genes and mechanisms that enable
L. hongkongensis to adapt to different temperatures, pH
and osmotic pressures, as well as oxidative and ultraviolet light stresses were also presented. These genes of
L. hongkongensis were compared to those of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Chromobacterium violaceum, the other three bacteria of the Neisseriaceae family of b-proteobacteria with complete genome
sequences available [11-13]. Human is the only known
reservoir and host for N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. N. gonorrhoeae is most commonly associated with
sexually transmitted infections and N. meningitidis is
most commonly associated with pyogenic meningitis
and bacteremia. C. violaceum is highly versatile and can
be found abundantly in multiple ecosystems, including
water and soil, in tropical and subtropical regions. It is
associated with infrequent but potentially fatal infections
in humans.

Results and discussion
DNA repair

Several pathways are involved in the repair of mutagenic
and cytotoxic effects of DNA damage that can arise
through endogenous and exogenous stress in bacteria.
Damage reversion (Direct repair)

Reversion of the damaged base is the simplest DNA
repair mechanism, which involves a single-step reaction
by specific enzymes. Photoreactivation and alkylation
repair are two of the most well-known damage reversion
mechanisms. Photoreactivation is carried out by photolyase, which acts upon lesions induced by UV irradiation
in a light-dependent reaction. A gene homologous to
phrB, which encodes a photolyase, was found in the
L. hongkongensis genome (Table 1). Alkylation repair is
mediated by the enzymes alkyltransferases, encoded by
ogt and ada, as well as iron-dependent dioxygenases,
encoded by alkA, which remove added alkyl groups
from duplex DNA. Genes encoding for all three
enzymes could be found in the L. hongkongensis genome
(Table 1). Since L. hongkongensis can survive in natural
water environments and is therefore often exposed to
sunlight, these enzymes may be important for protection
against such DNA damage. This is in contrast to
N. meningitidis which lacks alk and some meningococcal and gonococcal strains which lack photolyase activity, which may reflect the lack of light exposure in the
neisserial habitat [14].
Base excision repair

L. hongkongensis is exposed to reactive oxygen species
generated during normal cellular metabolism, as well as
from oxidative bursts from its host. One of the most

Page 2 of 27

important protective defense mechanisms against such
DNA damage is the base excision repair (BER) pathway,
which recognizes a wide range of DNA lesions. This
includes the most frequently encountered form of oxidative DNA damage: production of 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxo-2’deoxyguanosine (8oxodG) which can lead to ambiguous
base pairing (either A or C) during DNA replication.
The BER pathway is carried out by two types of
enzymes: glycosylases and AP-endonucleases. Glycosylases excise the damaged base from the sugar phosphate
backbone, leaving abasic (AP) sites, and endonucleases
incise the 5’ or 3’ phosphodiester from the AP site to
generate a nucleotide gap. There are eight glycosylases
and endonucelases in the L. hongkongensis genome.
Among the glycosylases, the uracil DNA glycocosylase
(UNG) is the most well characterized enzyme found in
various bacteria and eukaryotes. It is responsible for the
excision of uracil residues from DNA which can arise as
a result of misincorporation of dUMP residues by DNA
polymerase or due to cytosine deamination. Similar to
C. violaceum [15], the most closely related bacterial
species of the Neisseriaceae family with complete genome sequence available, the L. hongkongensis genome
contains two copies of UNG (Table 1). The complete
8oxodG system (GO system) is also present, which
involves MutM/FPG, MutT and MutY, which act
together to protect the bacterium against the effects of
8oxodG in E. coli [16]. MutM or FPG is formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase that recognizes oxidized purines such as 8oxodG and imidzole ring-opened purines;
while MutY is an atypical glycosylase which removes
adenine from DNA when it is mispaired with 8oxodG,
preventing GC to TA transversions [17]. In N. meningitidis, it has been shown that MutY has a prominent role
in DNA repair, with mutY mutants exhibiting high
spontaneous mutation rates [14].
Nucleotide excision repair

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) involves a group of
highly conserved proteins and repairs bulky lesions
caused by exogenous damage such as UV light that
generate a large helical distortion [18,19]. NER is carried
out by the UvrABC complex in E. coli, which excises a
24- to 32-bp DNA fragment that contains the damaged
lesion [20]. A functional NER pathway has also been
demonstrated in N. gonorrhoeae [21]. Similar to N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C. violaceum [14,15,21],
homologues of all enzymes in this pathway are present in
the L. hongkongensis genome (Table 1).
Mismatch repair

The mismatch repair (MMR) system recognizes and
removes single-base mismatches as well as small nucleotide insertions or deletions (forming small loops) that
result from errors during replication. In E. coli, MMR is
carried out by a number of enzymes working at a

sequential manner: MutS recognizes the mismatch;
MutL is recruited and binds as a dimer; the bound
MutS-MutL complex in turn recruits the MutH
endonuclease; MutH nicks the nascent DNA strand, distinguishing it from the parental strand by its undermethylation of GATC sequences; MutU (also known as
UvrD) and other exonucleases (such as RecJ or ExoI)
mediate the removal of up to 1000 bases (upstream or
downstream) of the strand that contain the lesion
[22,23]. This strand is then repaired by the actions of
DNA polymerase I. Similar to N. meningitidis and
C. violaceum [14,15], the L. hongkongensis genome contains the most important enzymes of the MMR pathway
except that mutH is absent, suggesting that this gene
has been lost in related bacterial lineages (Table 1). In
N. meningitidis, it has been shown that mutS mutants
had a significantly increased frequency of phase variation and moderate increases in the rate of missense
mutations [24]. However, other mechanisms are likely
involved in determining meningococcal mutability.
Further studies are required to investigate if MutH function is not required or another protein carries out the
MutH strand-specificity function in these bacteria of the
Neisseriaceae family. In contrast to C. violaceum,
N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae which possess only
one copy of the Dam protein, which is responsible for
DNA methylation, the L. hongkongensis genome contains
three copies of dam. These three Dam homologues are
phylogenetically most closely related to the Dam of
C. violaceum, with two of the three copies having

identical nucleotide sequences encoded on two highly
similar prophages (Figure 1). It has previously been
reported that the Dam methylase from C. violaceum has
high similarity to a bacteriophage Dam homologue, suggesting acquisition via a horizontal transfer event [15].
Although our analysis shows that the Dam proteins
from L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum are only distantly related to homologues found in other bacteriophages, the phylogenetic clustering of enzymes from
different classes of bacteria supports that this enzyme is
frequently horizontally transferred between bacteria
(Figure 1).
Recombinational repair

Recombinational repair is activated in response to
double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA which can lead to
broken chromosomes and cell death. Such damage is
repaired by homologous recombination in a process
known as double-strand break repair (DSBR); which
involves initiation, strand pairing and exchange, branch
migration and branch resolution. Similar to the pathogenic Neisseria species and C. violaceum [15,25,26], the
L. hongkongensis genome possesses all the important
genes in this pathway, including the recA gene universally found in bacteria (Table 2). RecA has an important
role in pathogenic Neisseria species, being involved in
repeat-associated events, including those associated with
pilus antigenic variation and transformation in
N. meningitidis [25]. The L. hongkongensis genome contains two pathways for repair initiation (RecBCD and
RecFOR), and two pathways for branch migration and

resolution (RuvABC and RecG). In addition to recombination repair, the RecBCD and RecN are also involved
in recombination during transformation, and RecO,
RecQ and RecJ in antigenic variation in N. gonorrhoeae
[25,27]. However, it remains to be seen if these components possess similar function in related species including L. hongkongensis.
Interestingly, homologues of the Bet and Exo recombinational repair proteins from bacteriophage lambda are
present within a probable 11kb defective prophage
region on the L. hongkongensis chromosome. Bet is a
single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP, sometimes also referred to as a synaptase), and Exo is a
single-stranded DNA alkaline exonuclease with 5’- to
3’-polarity [28]. The bet and exo genes are positioned
immediately adjacent to one another along with an additional copy of a single-stranded DNA binding protein of
phage origin (ssb2, LHK_01496), which is homologous
to, but distinct from, the presumed major functioning
ssb of neisserial origin (LHK_01479). Such arrangements
of phage-related DNA recombination proteins are commonly found in bacteria [29], acquired presumably by
phage integration followed by subsequent genetic rearrangement. If actively transcribed, functional pairs of
Exo and Bet proteins will promote DNA recombination
events analogous to those mediated by the RecA/
RecBCD/RecFOR pathways, and would be expected to
increase the rates of gene/genome rearrangements [28].
The Bet and Exo proteins may also function synergistically with RecA. The transcriptional status of the genes
within this presumed defective prophage region remain
to be established.
It has previously been noted that low-GC Gram positive species tend to possess RecT SSAPs rather than
Bet-family proteins [29], although this relationship has
not been re-examined more recently. The LHK_01498
gene is the only bet homologue present in the Neisseriaceae. However, there is a (functionally-equivalent) recT
homologue present in Kingella oralis ATCC51147 (the
only recT-family recombinase present in the Neisseriaceae) which does appear to have partnering exonuclease.
Due to likely (partial) genetic reassortment in a phage
host prior to incorporation into the L. hongkongensis
genome, the bet, exo and ssb2 genes have apparently
unrelated phylogenies (data not shown). The 162aa Ssb2
protein homologue is 69% identical to the presumed
functional Ssb protein within the cell (175aa), but
protein alignment reveals that it is lacking a stretch of
ca. 25 amino acids near the C-terminus (data not
shown). Interestingly, structural studies on the E. coli
Ssb-DNA complex have shown that this unstructured
region loops out from the SsB tetramer [30]. This region
is not involved in DNA binding, but is thought to be
responsible for interacting with the DNA primase and

Page 7 of 27

clamp loader proteins [31]. This suggests that the Ssb
and Ssb2 proteins are designed to work with quite different replication or DNA repair protein systems.
SOS Response

The SOS response is activated when replication is
blocked by DNA damage. The pathway is responsible
for activation of a variety of physiological responses,
including cell cycle inhibition and various DNA repair
pathways. In E. coli, the SOS response involves more
than 40 genes which are induced when there is a large
amount of DNA damage, allowing increased repair and
restoration of replication [32]. The pathway is controlled
by a dual-component system, with RecA being the activator and LexA the repressor. The RecA protein forms
a complex with single-stranded DNA, which leads to
cleavage of LexA repressor and expression of the SOS
regulon. Although genes related to SOS response,
including dinB, dinG, umu-D and dnaA, could be
identified, the lexA is absent in L. hongkongensis
genome, a phenomenon also observed in C. violaceum,
N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae [14,15,33] (Table 3).
This suggests that the lexA gene is lost in the common
ancestor of these bacteria during evolution. Moreover,
the recA, uvrA and uvrB genes of N. gonorrhoeae are
known to lack the characteristic lexA-binding site or
SOS boxes, the general hallmarks of an active SOS
response. In fact, it is been experimentally confirmed
that a functional SOS response is absent in N. gonorrhoeae [34]. Similarly, SOS boxes cannot be identified in
the homologues of SOS-inducible genes in N. meningitidis [14,35,12], suggesting that the SOS response may
also be absent in related bacteria of the same family.
Similar to the two Neisseria species and C. violaceum
[15], SOS boxes are also absent in the SOS-related
genes in L. hongkongensis. Further studies are required
to determine if SOS response is constitutive or absent in
this group of bacteria.
DNA replication

Bacterial DNA replication mechanisms are responsible
for the accurate duplication of genetic material during
cell division. The whole process involves the interplay of
many different proteins with a variety of functions. A
total of 36 coding sequences (CDSs) potentially involved
in DNA replication are present in the L. hongkongensis
genome, including 12 initiation factors, 11 elongation
factors, 2 termination factors and 5 topoisomerases
(Table 4). Since many of these proteins are essential to
the bacterial cell and therefore preserved during bacterial evolution, they are often highly conserved among
phylogenetically closely related bacteria.
Replication initiation

In L. hongkongensis, there is an oriC containing eight
9-bp repeat elements known as DnaA boxes, which are

potential binding sites for the initiator protein DnaA.
The DnaA in L. hongkongensis is highly conserved when
compared to those in closely related bacteria, with
76.7% amino acid identity with the homologue from
Lutiella nitroferrum. The four domains of DnaA previously identified to possess distinct functions are also
present [36]. As DnaA assembles with oriC to form a
large nucleoprotein complex, the DNA melts to generate
single DNA strands necessary for the binding of a
helicase, DnaB, and the replisomal machinery [36].
Although bacteria do not possess histones, their genomes are arranged in tightly compacted arrangements
known as nucleoids, which are important for maintaining an optimal DNA topology for replication initiation.
Six nucleoid-associated proteins, also referred to as
histone-like factors, were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome, including two HU-beta proteins, one
HN-S protein, two integration host factors (IHF) and
one factor for inversion stimulation (Fis). HU-beta and
HN-S proteins bind DNA non-specifically and contribute to the global condensation of bacterial chromosomes [37]. IHF and Fis recognize specific DNA
sequences and assist in organizing supercoiled domains
[36,38]. Earlier studies have shown that IHF stimulates
DnaA-mediated unwinding of oriC, whereas Fis inhibits
DUE melting [39,40].
Replication regulation

The L. hongkongensis genome contains three copies of
dam and one copy of the hda gene which are likely
involved in the regulation of the replication process.
Dam is an adenine methyltransferase responsible for the
methylation of GATC sites of the oriC in E. coli which
is important for origin sequestration, thus preventing reinitiation. Hda, a homologue of DnaA, is involved in the
regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA), which directly
stimulates ATP hydrolysis by DnaA after the initiator
melts the DUE [36]. It has been shown that hda-deficient cells display an over-initiation phenotype in E. coli
[41,42].
Control of gene expression

As for other bacteria, the principal mechanism for control of gene expression is through regulation of the
amount of mRNA produced from the corresponding
gene. This is primarily determined by the affinity of
RNA polymerase for the promoter. In L. hongkongensis,
this is exemplified by the difference in mRNA levels of
argB-20 and argB-37 at different temperatures, resulting
in different amounts of the two enzymes, N-acetyl-Lglutamate kinase (NAGK)-20 and NAGK-37 respectively
[43]. Genes that encode proteins which control basal
transcription, including the five-subunit RNA polymerase core enzyme (a2bb’ω) and s-factors for binding specifically to different classes of promoters and hence

Page 11 of 27

selective expression of different groups of genes, are
present in the L. hongkongensis genome. The primary
s-factor, s70, is responsible for recognizing the promoters for transcription of most of the housekeeping genes.
Furthermore, the L. hongkongensis genome contains
other alternative s-factors, including s 28 (FliA), s 32
(RpoH), s38 (RpoS), s24 (RpoE) and s54 (RpoN), which
allow it to bring about global changes in gene expression in response to different environmental stresses
(Table 5). The types of alternative s-factors in
L. hongkongensis are the same as those in C. violaceum,
except that there are two copies of s 28 (the flagellar
s-factor) in the C. violaceum genome but only one copy
of s28 in the L. hongkongensis genome. In the genomes
of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, no s28 and s38
(the starvation/stationary phase s-factor) are observed.
In addition to RNA polymerase and the s-factors, the
L. hongkongensis genome also encodes transcriptional
activators and repressors, which belong to a variety of
families of transcription factors. These transcription factors bind to sites near the target promoter and stimulate
or repress the activity of the corresponding s-RNA
polymerase holoenzyme. In the L. hongkongensis genome, 109 coding sequences (CDSs) that encode putative
transcription factors were identified (Table 6). Among
the 46 families of bacterial transcription factors,
L. hongkongensis contains genes that encode putative
transcription factors in 22 of them. The largest groups
belong to the LysR families. In most of the families, the
number of genes in the L. hongkongensis genome that
encode putative transcription factors in that family is in
between that of C. violaceum and the Neisseria species
(Table 7). This is in line with the ability of C. violaceum
to survive in a wide range of environments and the fastidious growth requirements and limited host range of
N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. One of the exceptions is that L. hongkongensis possesses three CDSs that
encode putative transcription factors of the cold shock
family, more than those in the genomes of C. violaceum,
N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. This may be related
to the adaptability of L. hongkongensis to environments
of low temperatures, such as those of freshwater fish
and frogs.
Tolerance to acid stress

L. hongkongensis is able to grow at pH of as low as 2
(unpublished data), and its tolerance to acid stress is
much higher than that of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C. violaceum. This is in line with the recovery
of L. hongkongensis from stool samples of patients with
gastroenteritis, as it has to pass through the highly
acidic environment of the stomach before reaching the
intestine. Therefore, it is not surprising that L. hongkongensis possesses abundant mechanisms for tolerating

The genome of L. hongkongensis contains a complete
urease gene cassette and two arc gene clusters. The
urease cassette contains eight CDSs encoding three structural (UreA, UreB and UreC) and five accessory proteins
(UreE, UreF, UreG, UreD and UreI), whereas each arc
cluster consists of four CDSs encoding the three
enzymes, arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and carbamate kinase, of the arginine deiminase
pathway, and a membrane bound arginine-ornithine
antiporter. Urease hydrolyzes urea into carbon dioxide
and ammonia, whereas the arginine deiminase pathway
converts L-arginine to carbon dioxide, ATP, and ammonia.
The ammonia generated from both pathways raises the pH
and counteracts the acid stress. A similar urease gene
cassette is not present in the genomes of N. gonorrhoeae,
N. meningitidis and C. violaceum, whereas one arc gene
cluster is present in the C. violaceum genome, but not in
that of N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis.
In addition to the urease cassette and arc clusters, the
L. hongkongensis genome also contains three CDSs that
encode putative chaperones of which their transcription
can also potentially be induced by acid shock. These
include dnaK, mopA1 and htpG. Furthermore, other
gene products may help the bacterium to survive in
acidic environment or their expression can be induced
by acid stress (Table 8). The functions of some of these

gene products are unknown, but the survival of the
respective bacteria at low pH had been shown to be
affected if the corresponding gene was deleted [44-49].
Tolerance to alkaline stress

L. hongkongensis is able to grow at pH as high as 9.0
(unpublished data). While this may be related to its ability to survive the alkaline pH in the host intestine,
growth at such alkalinity is still in line with many other
non-extremophilic bacteria. Adaptive mechanisms to
achieve cytoplasmic pH homeostasis in bacteria include
transporters and enzymes that promote proton capture
and retention, production of acidic metabolites and cell
surface changes [50]. Among all these mechanisms, the
most widely studied ones involve the transporters.
In the genome of L. hongkongensis, there are four
CDSs coding for putative transporters which belong to
the monovalent cation/proton antiporter-2 (CPA2)
family. Two of the CDSs code for putative Na + /H +
exchangers (LHK_02296, LHK_00707) while the other
two code for the putative genes kef (LHK_02848) and
kefB (LHK_02018). No CDS encoding putative homologue of monovalent cation/proton antiporter-1 (CPA1) or
monovalent cation/proton antiporter-3 (CPA3) has been
identified. Transporters of the monovalent cation/proton
antiporter (CPA) superfamily support key physiological

functions of bacteria by catalyzing active efflux of Na+
and/or K+, with respective H+ influx, to maintain cytoplasmic pH homeostasis and tolerate fluctuations in
osmolarity [51]. Since cytoplasmic bacterial parasites or
symbionts are sheltered by the host cell, it has been
postulated that their genomes encode few genes for
Na+/H+ antiporters [51]. A comparison of L. hongkongensis, C. violaceum, intracellular pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, as well as the two model
bacterial organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia
coli, are shown in Table 9. It can be observed that
L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum have more genes predicted to encode CPA2 superfamily transporters when
compared to N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae.
In addition to the four CDSs coding for the putative
transporters of the CPA2 family, two CDSs putatively
coding for transporters of the NhaC Na+:H+ antiporter
(NhaC) family are also present (LHK_00646, LHK_02247)
in the L. hongkongensis genome. Both are predicted to
code for the gene nhaC. Nevertheless, gene sequences of
the two CDSs are significantly different, indicating a possible difference in phylogenetic origin. The nhaC homologue in the alkaliphilic bacteria Bacillus firmus has been
confirmed experimentally to produce NhaC, which has
Na+/H+ antiporter activity [52]. Table 9 also compares
the number of identified NhaA, NhaB, NhaC and NhaD

Two copies of the gene are present

family transporters in the genomes of L. hongkongensis to
those in C. violaceum, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, B.
subtilis and E. coli.
Acquisition of and tolerance to heavy metals

To adapt to natural freshwater, L. hongkongensis should
be able to acquire essential heavy metal ions and expel
them, or their toxic counterparts, when their levels
reach toxicity. Many heavy metals belong to the transition elements. Their electronic configurations provide
them with an exquisite ability to form complex compounds. Metal ions such as iron(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II)
and copper(II) are essential to many physiological functions, yet are toxic at high concentrations. Certain species, such as silver(I), cadmium(II) and mercury(II),
however, are relatively toxic to bacteria; the toxic complexes formed by these ions preclude their physiological
use by common bacteria [53].
Iron

Iron is required by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes for
the synthesis of important proteins such as cytochromes.
Bacteria employ a variety of mechanisms to acquire iron,
such as siderophore-mediated uptake, metal inorganic
transport systems (MIT) and ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transport systems.
No gene for siderophore production was found in the
L. hongkongensis genome. Since heme-bound iron and
iron-containing proteins may not be readily available
outside of a host [54], transporter-mediated transport of
ionic iron would be the probable mechanism of iron
acquisition during the environmental persistence of
L. hongkongensis. A locus coding for the periplasmic ferric iron binding protein FbpA, permease FbpB and a
putative iron-transport system ATP-binding protein is
present (LHK_02634-02636). Putative homologous loci,
containing three similar CDSs, is present in C. violaceum

(CV1908-1910), N. gonorrhoeae (NGO0215-0217) and
N. meningitidis (NMB0632-0634). The gene coding for the
putative iron-transport system ATP-binding protein in
L. hongkongensis (LHK_02636) is probably homologous to
the fbpC gene in N. meningitidis. The FbpABC system has
been shown to be a specific ferric iron transport system
with high affinity to Fe3+ in Haemophilus influenzae[55].
In addition, two CDSs are the putative homologues of the
genes coding for the high-affinity ABC transport system
for ferrous iron in E. coli (feoABC) are present in the
L. hongkongensis (LHK_03044-03045). The two CDSs code
for the putative homologues of feoA and feoB respectively.
The putative homologue of feoB is also present in C. violaceum. No putative homologues of feoA or feoC are found
in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
Nickel

Nickel is an essential component of urease, which is
implicated in the acid tolerance of L. hongkongensis. The
CorA and HoxN systems have been proposed as an
important nickel and cobalt transport system in bacteria
[53]. No putative CDS coding for genes of the CorA system is present in the L. hongkongensis genome, yet a
CDS coding for a histidine-rich glycoprotein with
functional domain of the high-affinity nickel transport
protein NicO was identified (LHK_02812). The NicO
protein is related to the NixA of the HoxN family,
which has been implicated in the urease-dependent
pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori[56]. A locus of four
CDSs coding for dppB, dppC, dppD and dppF
(LHK_00939-00942) was found. They belong to an ABC
transporter subfamily and are predicted to transport
dipeptides, oligopeptides and nickel. The dppA homologue (LHK_00667) is located distant from the dppBCDF
locus. This is in contrast to C. violaceum, where the
CDS coding for the putative dppA gene is contiguous to
the dppBCDF locus. This separation of dppA from the

Lau et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:22
http://www.cellandbioscience.com/content/1/1/22

dppBCDF locus, however, is not unique; it is also
observed in H. influenzae[57]. The relatively well-characterized nickel/cobalt resistance system Cnr [58] and
nickel/cobalt/cadmium resistance system Ncc [59] find
no direct homologous systems in the L. hongkongensis;
whilst the putative gene coding for a protein of similar
function, in terms of sequence homology and functional
domains, is traced to a CDS which encodes the putative
NolG efflux pump of the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily (LHK_02819). In addition, two CDSs
coding for an ABC transporter for cobalt (LHK_0107701078) were found; it is uncertain whether this member
of the nickel(II)-cobalt(II) uptake transporter (NiCoT)
family may also transport nickel due to variations in the
exact level of binding specificity [60]. Homologues of
putative genes encoding dppA, dppBCDF (LHK_00667,
LHK_00939-00942) and the histidine-rich glycoprotein
(LHK_02812) were identified in the genome of C. violaceum but not published genomes of N. gonorrhoeae or
N. meningitidis. No putative homologue of the locus
containing genes coding for the ABC transporter for
cobalt (LHK_01077-01078) was identified in C. violaceum, N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis.
Cobalt

Cobalt is found in coenzyme B12, which is responsible
for methyl group transfer and rearrangement [61,62].
Apart from the HoxN and NiCoT described, three CDSs
that encode a putative ABC-type cobalt transport system
(LHK_01956-01958) and one that codes for a putative
magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (LHK_00289) were
also found. No putative homologue of the ABC-type
cobalt transport system was found in C. violaceum,
N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. For the putative
magnesium and cobalt efflux protein gene, putative
homologues were found in C. violaceum, N. meningitidis
and N. gonorrhoeae as corC.
Cadmium

A CDS coding for a cadmium-translocating P-type
ATPase (CadA-1, LHK_00449) was found in the
genome. CadA and CadA-like proteins have been implicated in the transport of various heavy metals include,
but not limiting to, cadmium, cobalt, mercury, lead and
zinc [53]; CadA has been shown to be responsible for
the Cd2+ efflux in both Gram-positive bacteria such as
Staphylococcus aureus[63] and Bacillus spp. [64]; and
Gram-negative bacteria such as Ralstonia metallidurans
[65]. It may also contribute to Pb2+ efflux [66]. cadA-1
is very similar to the E. coli gene zntA, which has been
shown to be responsible for the intrinsic resistance of
E. coli to zinc and cadmium [67]. Probable homologues
and paralogues of cadA-1 and CadA-like protein coding
genes are present in C. violaceum as zntA and copA; in
N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae as putative transport
ATPase genes.

Page 15 of 27

Copper

A locus of two CDSs (LHK_03034-03035) coding for a
putative copper translocating ATPase and a conserved
heavy metal associated domain were also found in the
genome. The putative copper translocating ATPase
gene has a homologue, copA, in E. coli; copA in E. coli
has been shown to be important in resistance to the
toxic effects of copper, and is induced by silver and
copper ions [68]. Putative homologues of this copper
translocating ATPase gene (LHK_03035) are also present in C. violaceum (copA), N. meningitidis and
N. gonorrhoeae.
Tolerance to temperature stress

L. hongkongensis inhabits the intestines of freshwater
fish, frogs and human [4,6-9]. It is also able to survive
freely in freshwater environment [10]. In contrast to
human, the body temperatures of freshwater fish and
frogs vary with the environmental temperature. The
ability to survive in such a wide range of habitats is in
line with its ability to survive from 15°C to 42°C,
although its growth rate is higher at higher temperatures [8]. In an experiment that examined the differential gene expression of L. hongkongensis at 20°C to 37°
C using proteomics study, we found that there were 12
differentially expressed protein spots involved in various functions [43]. Seven spots were more highly
expressed at 20°C than at 37°C and five more highly
expressed at 37°C than at 20°C. Among these were
NAGK-37 that was up-regulated at 37°C and
NAGK-20 that was up-regulated at 20°C. These two
isoenzymes of NAGK catalyze the second step of the
arginine biosynthesis pathway.
In addition to the differentially expressed genes
detected by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the L.
hongkongensis genome also contains other genes that
could be of importance for adaptation to different temperatures. These include genes related to chaperones
and chaperonins, heat shock proteins and cold shock
proteins. Overall, the number of CDSs in the L. hongkongensis genome encoding putative chaperones and
heat shock proteins is lower than that in C. violaceum,
but higher than those in the Neisseria species (Table
10). This phenomenon is similar to that observed in the
number of distribution of transcription factors in L. hongkongensis, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C. violaceum as described above. On the other hand, the L.
hongkongensis genome possesses two copies of cspA
which encodes cold shock transcription factor and one
copy of cspD which encodes cold shock protein homologue (Table 10). There is only one copy of cspA in the
genomes of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and C. violaceum, whereas cspD is absent from the genomes of N.
gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.

Tolerance to osmotic stress

L. hongkongensis can survive in and adapt to a variety of
ecological niches, including water and the intestines of
freshwater fish, frogs and humans, with different osmotic stress. A total of 25 CDSs in the L. hongkongensis
genome could be related to control of osmotic pressure
(Table 11). Most of these CDSs encode proteins and

their regulators for transport of potassium ion, proline
and glutamate. Among the 25 CDSs, 11 of them are
related to potassium ion transport (nine and two for
potassium uptake and efflux respectively); whereas only
nine CDSs present in the C. violaceum genome and
three in the N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis genomes are related to potassium ion transport (Table 11).

In addition to the 11 CDSs related to potassium transport, five other CDSs encode mechanosensitive channel
proteins. These channels allow a quick and transient
increase in compensatory solute (e.g. proline and glutamate) flux out of bacterial cells in response to large turgor pressure generated by water influx due to osmotic
downshock when the bacterial cells are transferred to
environments of low osmolarity [69]. Interestingly, a
betT gene that encodes a transport protein for choline
uptake is present in the L. hongkongensis genome. However, the betA and betB genes, that encode enzymes for
metabolizing choline to glycine betaine, the osmotically
active compound, are absent [70]. Similarly, the glpR
and glpK genes are present. However, the glpF gene,
another gene in the glpFK operon that encodes the glycerol uptake facilitator protein, is absent [71]. Therefore,
the contributions of betT, glpR and glpK and their
corresponding choline and glycerol transport systems to
tolerance of osmotic stress in L. hongkongensis are
unknown. The expressions of two other CDSs, osmB
and osmC, which encode two osmotically inducible
lipoproteins, have been found to be affected by change
in osmolarity in E. coli [72,73]. Both osmB and osmC
are membrane proteins of unknown function. In E. coli,
it was observed that deletion of osmC will render the
bacterium more sensitive to oxidative stress because of
its peroxidase activity [74].
Tolerance to oxidative stress and ultraviolet light stress

Oxidative stress on aerobic bacteria is mainly mediated
by partially reduced oxygen species, or reactive oxygen
species, most notably superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, that are inevitable by-products of aerobic metabolism. These reactive oxygen species can cause damage to
DNA, proteins and membranes. As a result, all aerobic
bacteria possess various mechanisms to scavenge superoxide and hydrogen peroxide [75], as well as to protect
the cells from damaged by these reactive oxygen species.
In most bacteria, inducible responses to superoxide
stress and hydrogen peroxide stress are mediated
through the transcription factors SoxR(S) and OxyR
respectively, which command the induction of a battery
of defensive proteins, including superoxide dismutase
and catalase respectively [76].
In the L. hongkongensis genome, genes for oxidantresistant dehydratase (fumC, acnA), superoxide scavenging (sodB), hydrogen peroxide scavenging (ahpC, cpx),
exclusion and export of redox-cycling antibiotics (acrA,
acrB, tolC), redox balancing (nfnB), DNA repair (xthA,
nth, mutM, mutY, mutT), reduction of disulfide bonds
(trxA, trxB, gpxA, gshA, gshB, grxA, grxC, gor) [77], limitation of iron availability (bfr, dps, fur) and reduction of
iron-sulfur clusters (fpr, yggX) are present (Table 12).
Transcriptions of most of the genes are regulated by

Page 19 of 27

SoxR(S) and/or OxyR transcription factors in other bacteria (Table 12) [78]. In addition, some genes may be
regulated by other transcription factors, such as RpoS,
FNR [79], Fur and Lrp [80,81]. Interestingly, SoxR(S) is
not present in the genomes of N. gonorrhoeae, N.
meningitidis and N. lactamica and the role of SoxR(S) is
presumably taken up by other transcription factors [82].
Notably, SoxR(S) was also not found in the L. hongkongensis genome by BLASTp search.
In addition to oxidative stress, ultraviolet light is
another environmental stress that damages the DNA of
a bacterium. The genomes of L. hongkongensis, C. violaceum, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis all contain
one copy of phrB which encodes a photolyase for direct
repair of DNA; and one copy each of uvrA, uvrB, uvrC
and uvrD in the nucleotide excision repair system.
Starvation related CDSs

L. hongkongensis is arguably fastidious: it is asaccharolytic, metabolizing none of the common sugars, requiring
malate, adipate or caprate as its carbon source [1,4,43];
in the laboratory, its optimal growth requires brainheart infusion (BHI) instead of commonplace lysogeny
broth (LB) (unpublished data). Thus the pivotal study
published in 2007, describing the isolation of
L. hongkongensis from six of the 10 surveyed drinking
water reservoirs in Hong Kong, prompts inquiries into
the mechanisms of survival and persistence of this bacterium in nutrient-poor environments [10]. In many
natural waters, nutrients are scarce. An average of the
reservoirs from which L. hongkongensis were isolated
demonstrates such: the permanganate value, a surrogate
for organic carbon content, had a yearly mean of 1.25
mg O2/L; ammoniacal nitrogen, 0.05 mg N/L; and total
phosphorus, 0.015 mg P/L [83]. This is in stark contrast
with even so-called “minimal medium”, in which the
malate content measures 2000 mg/L; ammoniacal nitrogen 9.0 mg N/L and total phosphorus 17 mg P/L [84].
Clearly, L. hongkongensis has exquisite adaptive abilities
which enable its survival in environments such as the
drinking water reservoirs.
General starvation

With limited nutrients, bacteria do not continue their
exponential growth indefinitely. Instead, they move into
the stationary phase; cells lose viability and enter the
death phase; in prolonged periods of nutrient depletion,
a resistant subpopulation survives and the extended
stationary phase ensues [85]. To adapt to stress conditions as such, alternative sigma factors enable bacterial
RNA polymerase to transcribe an alternative subset of
its genes. In the stationary phase, the starvation/stationary phase sigma factor, s38, encoded by rpoS, is used to
upregulate the expression of a number of genes.
Some of these genes may be clustered with rpoS: in

L. hongkongensis a surE-pcm-nlpD-rpoS cluster was
observed (LHK_00356-00353). This is similar to
C. violaceum ATCC12472 (CV_3679-3682), and was
also observed in other pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium [86] and Yersinia pestis [87]. In the
L. hongkongensis surE-pcm-nlpD-rpoS cluster, there is an
overlap between the surE and pcm genes; which was
also observed in C. violaceum. Despite this overlapping,
as shown in E. coli, the pcm gene can either be cotranscribed with the surE gene or transcribed on its
own [88].
A CDS coding for the putative gene surA precursor is
present in the L. hongkongensis genome (LHK_03194).
This survival protein precursor was also found in
C. violaceum, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and
E. coli. SurA, the periplasmic chaperone protein encoded
by this gene, is responsible for the proper folding and
insertion of a subset of outer membrane proteins in
E. coli [89]. It is of interest, however, to note that the
SurA precursor protein is only expressed at 37°C, but
not the environmental temperature of 20°C, when
L. hongkongensis is cultured in the rich medium of BHI
[43]. It is unknown, therefore, whether temperature may
have a more generalized effect on the starvation
response of L. hongkongensis.
Carbon starvation

In the L. hongkongensis genome, only one CDS coding
for the putative carbon starvation gene cstA2 was found
(LHK_00676). This is similar to N. gonorrhoeae and
N. meningitidis, but different from the C. violaceum
genome, which contains two CDSs coding for the putative genes cstA1 and cstA2. The E. coli homologue of
the L. hongkongensis cstA2 gene is cstA. CstA is a starvation-induced peptide transporter in E. coli, and has been
implicated in peptide utilization [90].
CDSs coding for putative genes sspA and sspB are present in the L. hongkongensis genome (LHK02886-02887).
Putative homologues of sspA and sspB are also present
in C. violaceum, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and
E. coli. In E. coli, sspA and sspB code for the stringent
starvation proteins SspA and SspB. Whilst SspA is
essential to expression of SspB, it has also been found
to be upregulated in the starvation response to glucose,
nitrogen, phosphate and amino acids [91]. SspA and
SspB are probably not implicated in the sugar starvation
response of L. hongkongensis, if any, since the bacterium
is asaccharolytic. It is uncertain, nevertheless, whether
carbon starvation, i.e. of malate, caprate and adipate,
may lead to upregulation of the putative sspA and sspB
genes in L. hongkongensis.
Phosphorus starvation

It has long been observed that phosphate is often the
limiting nutrient of algal and bacterial growth in freshwater environments [92-94]. Bacteria have evolved

Page 23 of 27

various mechanisms to enhance the uptake of phosphate, even by cell envelope elongation to increase the
surface area to volume ratio [95]; albeit a relationship is
yet to be ascribed to the seagull or spiral rod shape of
L. hongkongensis. From the freshwater reservoir data stated above, phosphate is probably the scarcest nutrient
amongst carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and iron with its
concentration of 0.015 mg P/L (or 0.5 μM). On the
other hand, however, it is worthwhile to note the more
recent finding that phosphate depletion may enhance
bacterial resistance to multiple antimicrobials [96,97].
Phosphate homeostasis in bacteria is mainly achieved
by the PhoR/PhoB two-component regulatory system
(TCRS). In L. hongkongensis, the putative genes coding
for the PhoR/PhoB are adjacent to each other
(LHK_00166-00165), as in C. violaceum (CV_05630562). The N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis homologue of the phoR and phoB genes, however, could not be
identified.
The PhoR/PhoB TCRS is closely related to the phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system. In E. coli, there is
a pstSCAB-phoU operon in which the genes pstS,
pstC, pstA, pstB and phoU are clustered. This is not
the case in L. hongkongensis, C. vioalceum, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. In L. hongkongensis, the
putative pstSCAB locus (LHK00524-00521) is well
separated from the CDS coding for the putative phoU
gene (LHK_00885). In C. violaceum, this separation is
also seen (pstSCAB: CV_0938-0935; phoU: CV_1261);
the pstSCAB locus is also clustered with the putative
pitA gene, which codes for a low-affinity inorganic
phosphate transporter (CV_0934). In contrast to such,
the CDS that encodes the putative pitA gene in L. hongkongensis is separated from the putative pstSCAB
locus (LHK_02538). It is believed that the PstS, PstC,
PstA and PstB proteins, together with PhoU, are
responsible for the formation of an ABC transporter in
the capture of periplasmic inorganic phosphate. In an
abundance of phosphate, the Pst system, together with
the histidine kinase PhoR, repress the transcription
regulatory protein PhoB. When the extracellular phosphate concentration is below a threshold value, for
example 4 mM in E. coli, autophosphorylation on a
PhoR histidine residue occurs; the phosphorylation is
subsequently transferred form phospho-PhoB, which
modulates Pho regulon activities [98,99].

Conclusions
The L. hongkongensis genome possessed a high variety of
genes for DNA repair and recombination and regulation
of gene expression, as well as adaptation to acid,
alkaline, temperature, osmotic, oxidative, UV light and
starvation stresses as well as acquisition of and tolerance
to heavy metals (Figure 2)

Methods
All CDSs in the L. hongkongensis genome were
annotated as described in our previous publication and
classified functionally according to the Clusters of
Orthologous Groups system [43]. Annotated genes were
mapped to pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database to help identify
stress-response pathways. The CDSs were members of
COG L (replication, recombination and repair), COG
K (transcription), COG F (nucleotide transport and
metabolism) and COG O (post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones). Additional CDSs
were examined by keyword search using the following
words and their variants: stress response, regulation,
adaptation, temperature, ultraviolet, acid, alkali, pressure,
oxidative, homeostasis and resistance. Manual confirmation of the assigned function was performed by sequence
similarity search using BLAST against the NCBI nr
database, and assisted by conserved domain search
(CD-search), identification of signature sequence motifs

and sequence analysis using InterProScan. Cellular localization of putative proteins was predicted using PSORTb
where appropriate [100]. Phylogenetic relationships were
determined using Clustal × version 1.81. oriC was predicted by Ori-finder http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/.
