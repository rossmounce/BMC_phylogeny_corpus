variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA)
for improved detection of Clostridium difficile

Abstract
Background: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping is one of the globally accepted techniques for defining
epidemic clones of Clostridium difficile and tracing virulence-related strains. However, the ambiguous data
generated by this technique makes it difficult to compare data attained from different laboratories; therefore, a
portable technique that could supersede or supplement PCR ribotyping should be developed. The current study
attempted to use a new multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) panel to detect PCR-ribotype
groups. In addition, various MLVA panels using different numbers of variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci
were evaluated for their power to discriminate C. difficile clinical isolates.
Results: At first, 40 VNTR loci from the C. difficile genome were used to screen for the most suitable MLVA panel.
MLVA and PCR ribotyping were implemented to identify 142 C. difficile isolates. Groupings of serial MLVA panels
with different allelic diversity were compared with 47 PCR-ribotype groups. A MLVA panel using ten VNTR loci with
limited allelic diversity (0.54-0.83), designated MLVA10, generated groups highly congruent (98%) with the PCRribotype groups. For comparison of discriminatory power, a MLVA panel using only four highly variable VNTR loci
(allelic diversity: 0.94-0.96), designated MLVA4, was found to be the simplest MLVA panel that retained high
discriminatory power. The MLVA10 and MLVA4 were combined and used to detect genetically closely related C.
difficile strains.
Conclusions: For the epidemiological investigations of C. difficile, we recommend that MLVA10 be used in
coordination with the PCR-ribotype groups to detect epidemic clones, and that the MLVA4 could be used to
detect outbreak strains. MLVA10 and MLVA4 could be combined in four multiplex PCR reactions to save time and
obtain distinguishable data.

Background
Clostridium difficile is the most commonly recognized
cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea [1]. Illnesses
associated with C. difficile range from mild diarrhea to
pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon [2]. In
the early 2000s, an emerging virulent strain, NAP1/027,
caused hospital outbreaks in Canada [3], and later,
strains of the same genotype were also found in the
United States of America, Europe, and Asia [3-5]. To

understand the spread of bacteria and identify clones
with apparent increased virulence, several molecular
methods for genotyping have been used to investigate C.
difficile [6-10]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is
the “gold standard” for assessing population structure.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping has been
used for the global analysis of related virulent strains
based on a reference library involving 116 genotypes
acquired since 1999, and has become the most common
technique to represent the epidemic clone of C. difficile
[11]. In addition, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), surface layer protein A gene-sequence typing
(slpAST), restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), and
multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis
(MLVA) have been used for outbreak studies of C.

difficile [7,8,12-14]. Among these techniques, MLVA
panels exhibit a significantly higher discriminatory
power (allelic diversity: 0.964) than PFGE, slpAST, and
PCR ribotyping [9]. As a result, MLVA has been the
most commonly used to distinguish strains from different outbreaks, whereas PCR ribotyping and PFGE have
mostly been used to detect long-term relationships
among strains when compare to MLVA [15,16].
PCR ribotyping is performed using a PCR-based
method to detect polymorphic sequences in the 16S-23S
intergenic spacer region (ISR) in C. difficile [17]. The
band-pattern data generated by this method is difficult
to transport and to compare between laboratories
[18,19]. Therefore, a few studies have tried to replace
PCR ribotyping with other methods [19-22]. Typing of
slpA, which is based on the S-layer gene sequence of C.
difficile, recognizes only nine of the 14 PCR-ribotypes
[22]. Recently, a highly discriminatory MLST method
based on seven housekeeping genes (adk, atpA, dxr,
glyA, recA, sodA, and tpi) sequences was develop to
allow genotyping of C. difficile; the resulting sequence
type (ST) recognized 32 of 40 PCR-ribotypes [21]. To
date, the tandem repeat sequences type (TRST) technique is the most concordant method; this method, which
combines two variable tandem repeat sequences,
resolved the phylogenic diversity at a level equivalent to
PCR ribotyping [20]. The MLVA employs multiple variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci with varying
levels of diversity to resolve genetic relationships.
VNTRs with a high degree of diversity are used to differentiate closely related strains. In addition, recent
research in Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria meningitidis showed that VNTR loci with a lower degree of
diversity can establish deeper phylogenetic relationships
consistent with the MLST method, which is based on
the slowly-mutating housekeeping gene sequences
[23,24]. In the past, for C. difficile, the MLVA panel has
been found a more discriminatory method than PCRribotyping [13,14]. In this study, we hypothesize that an
MLVA panel with a lower combined allelic diversity
may be more congruent to PCR ribotyping.
The purpose here was to determine a MLVA panel
that could yield results in accordance with PCR ribotyping results. Serial MLVA panels were compared with
PCR-ribotype groups based on an investigation of 142
C. difficile isolates. By combining more conserved
VNTR loci, we found MLVA10 had excellent congruence with the epidemic clone. Moreover, a simple
MLVA (MLVA4) with high discriminatory power was
also proposed as a useful alternative. Therefore,
MLVA10 and MLVA4 can be combined in four multiplex PCR reactions to save operation time when typing
a large collection of isolates.

Results
Identification and characterization of VNTR loci in C.
difficile

A total of 47 VNTR loci candidates were identified for
C. difficile, and 40 were used for subsequent MLVA
analysis (Table 1, Additional file 1). Initially, we found
1,526 tandem-repeat loci within C. difficile 630 using
the VNTRDB software [25]. After exclusion of repeatedly detected loci, tandem-repeat loci with a copy number size >2 bp and an amplicon size of <700 bp were
analyzed for variability. Finally, 47 loci exhibiting variable alleles were identified. The allelic diversity, allele
number, and typing ability of all 47 VNTRs from the
142 strains were determined. Several VNTR loci with
additional or imperfect repeats were observed (Additional file 1). CDR59 amplicon exhibited two adjacent
VNTR loci, while CDR60, cd5, cd6, cd7, and cd25
exhibited incomplete tandem repeats. To analyze these
loci in the MLVA panels, alleles of these loci were
represented by repeat array size instead of copy number,
and the MLVA types were analyzed with minimum
spanning tree (MST) using a categorical coefficient.
VNTR loci with low typing ability and/or deletions were
excluded, with the CDR5, cd8, cd28, and cd20 loci
amplifying at only 70%, 77%, 79%, and 79%, respectively.
Additionally, deletions in amplicons from cd16, cd19,
and cd39 were found. Consequently, only 40 VNTR loci
were used in the following experiments.
Capillary gel electrophoresis-based PCR ribotyping

Of the 142 isolates, capillary gel electrophoresis-based
PCR-ribotyping identified 57 independent types, including 32 singletons. The most common types were R45,
R4, R10, R14, and R17 (UK017), containing 7, 17, 11, 11
and 9 isolates, respectively (Figure 1). The R27 (UK 027)
virulent type was not found among the local strains.
Dendrogram based on PCR ribotyping

A phylogenetic dendrogram based on the PCR-ribotypes
was constructed using the 142 C. difficile isolates (Figure
1). Of the 142 isolates, PCR-ribotype, MLVA34, and
MLVA10, identified 57 types, 47 groups, and 45 groups,
respectively. The PCR-ribotype was more discriminatory
than the two MLVA groups (Figure 1). Using a threshold of >83% similarity for defining PCR-ribotype groups,
all isolates were able to be divided into 47 PCR-ribotype
groups, including 22 singletons. Over 87% (41/47) of the
PCR-ribotype groups were specifically recognized in the
MLVA34 and MLVA10 groups. However, PCR-ribotype
groups 39 and 25 were recognized together as one by
both MLVA groups, with the fingerprints for these isolates sharing a 70% similarity (a four-band difference).
In addition, PCR ribotype groups 26 and 49 were also

identified as one by the two MLVA groups, with the fingerprints of these two isolates sharing a 78% similarity.
Furthermore, PCR ribotype groups 8 and 23 were also
seen as one by the two MLVA groups, with the fingerprint of these isolates sharing an 82% similarity. Taken
together, these results shows that this discordance, the
lack of one to one identification between PCR ribotypes
and MLVA groups, mainly occurred when PCR-ribotypes shared >83% similarity.
Congruence between groups of the PCR ribotype and
MLVA

MLVA panels with slightly limit allelic diversity generated
groups highly congruent with PCR ribotyping (Table 2).
To determine the most congruent groupings between
MLVA panels and PCR-ribotype groups, groupings of
MLVA panels consisting of VNTR loci with high to low
allelic diversity were compared with the PCR-ribotype
groups. MLVA34, MLVA12, and MLVA10 generated partitions (47, 45, and 45, respectively) and allelic diversity
(0.959, 0.957, and 0.957, respectively) similar to those
identified by PCR ribotyping (Table 2). The congruence of
the grouping of MLVA34, MLVA12, and MLVA10 with

the PCR ribotype groups amounted to 97.3, 98.9, and
98.9%, respectively (Table 2). These values were significantly higher than that of the MLVA40 group (2.6%).
MLVA40, which included six highly variable VNTR loci,
C6cd, CDR60, CDR4, CDR49, CDR9, and CDR48 (allelic
diversity: 0.84-0.96), generated a lot more partitions (136)
and higher allelic diversity (0.999) than PCR ribotyping. In
most PCR-ribotypes, multiple alleles were observed for
C6cd, CDR60, CDR4, CDR49, CDR9, and CDR48 loci
(Additional file 2), whereas the other 34 VNTR loci exhibited little variance. This data indicates that the greatest discrepancy between groupings in these two methods
occurred in loci with high allelic diversity, and that congruence increased when the highly-allelic-diversity loci
were removed, as in MLVA34.
To identify a simplified panel resembling MLVA34,
the groups from three smaller panels (MLVA12,
MLVA10, and MLVA8) were evaluated for agreement
with the PCR-ribotype groups. MLVA10 was the simplest panel yielding groups that were highly congruent
(98%) with the PCR-ribotype groups (Table 2). In contrast, congruence significantly decreased when the
MLVA was simplified to just eight VNTR loci.

Figure 2 Minimum-spanning tree of MLVA34 data from 142 C. difficile isolates. Each circle represents unique MLVA type. The numbers
between circles represent the VNTR loci differences between MLVA types. The numbers inside circles represent the PCR-ribotype groups. MLVA
groups were defined as MLVA types having a maximum distance changes at one loci. The different shaded colors denote isolates belonging to
a particular MLVA groups. Hyphenated numbers represent the MLVA groups marked with arrows.

Minimum spanning tree analysis of PCR ribotypingrelated MLVA panels

MST analysis revealed that the MLVA34 types could be
clustered into 47 groups, including 21 singletons (Figure
2). Most (41/47) of the MLVA34 groups were specifically recognized as a single PCR-ribotype group, except
for 34_4, 34_41, 34_11, 34_48, 34_25, and 34_26. An
isolate of the group 34_41 could not be typed by the
cd7 and cd34 loci, and was separated from those of the
34_4 MLVA group; however, all isolates of the 34_41
and 34_4 groups belonged to PCR-ribotype group 4.
This shows that isolates of the 34_4 and 34_41 groups
were closely related. Isolates of group 34_11 and 34_48
were separated by their different allele numbers at
CDR59 and H9cd loci, but these two MLVA groups
both belonged to the PCR-ribotype group 11.
MST analysis revealed that the MLVA10 types could
be clustered into 45 groups, including 20 singletons
(Figure 3), and most (41/45) of the MLVA10 groups
were specifically recognized as a single PCR-ribotype
group. The clustering of MLVA10 (Figure 3) yielded
groupings similar to those of MLVA34, except for isolates of PCR-ribotype groups 4, 8, and 23. Since the
cd34 VNTR locus was not used in the MLVA10 panel,
isolates from the PCR-ribotype group 4 all belonged to

the 10_4 group. This indicates that the MLVA10 panel
was able to type more strains than the MLVA34 panel.
In addition, isolates of the PCR-ribotype groups 8 and
23 were grouped into the 10_8 group, indicating that
the MLVA10 is less discriminatory than MLVA34.
Discriminatory ability of MLVA panels

MLVA panels containing different numbers of VNTR
loci were used for discriminating 142 C. difficile isolates
into different genotypes and the Simpson’s index of
diversity (ID) was shown to increase with the number of
VNTR loci used (up to MLVA4; Table 3). Using
MLVA4, 142 isolates were grouped into the largest partitions (140). MLVA4 was shown to be as discriminatory
as MLVA40 using all 40 VNTR loci (Table 3). However,
when the MLVA panels contained fewer than three
VNTR loci, the partitions decreased significantly.
Combined use of MLVA4 and MLVA10 for cluster
detection

MLVA4 and MLVA10 were used for classifying 59 isolates
acquired from a hospital in central Taiwan, and four clusters were identified (Figure 4; Additional file 3). These
clusters consisted of three independent clusters (B, C, and
D) containing two isolates each from inpatients and one

respectively (Additional file 3). The two isolates from cluster A were shown to differ at one locus (1/14) in the combined MLVA4 plus MLVA10 panel and were isolated
from two specimens of the same patient within a four-day
interval. Most isolates were non-toxigenic strains, except
those in cluster D. The patient in the D cluster developed
diarrhea and was infected with toxigenic C. difficile strains
that were assigned to C. difficile infection cases. On the
other hand, a single PCR-ribotype group was usually
grouped with less than five VNTR loci differences (5/14).

Discussion
A MLVA system is composed of VNTR loci that exhibit
varying levels of diversity, and can be employed either
for long-term or short-term investigations [26]. In the
present study, we proposed two MLVA panels,
MLVA10 and MLVA4, for the differentiation of C. difficile isolates. MLVA10 exhibited a slightly lower allelic
diversity than previously identified panels [13,14], and is
recommended as a complementary test to the PCR-ribotype groups. MLVA4, in contrast, exhibited high allelic
diversity and is recommended for the detection of
short-term evolution in strains of C. difficile.
In the current study, except for nine reference strains,
the 133 local isolates were a widely distributed collection

and none were previously reported as outbreak strains by
clinical laboratories. These isolates were acquired from
patients 0.1-88 years of age and contained 73 isolates
from outpatients that were assumed to be communityacquired strains. The other 60 isolates were recovered
from hospitalized patients, with 38 collected from children’s wards and 22 from adult wards. In addition, this
study involved 57 PCR-ribotypes (Table 3), a considerably higher number than previously reported [9]. Therefore, the sample population used in the current study is
proposed to be more suitable for comparison between
the two methods [20,21,27]. In the ribotype distribution,
it is noteworthy that the PCR-ribotype R17 (UK 017), a
clone found worldwide and is related to an animal source
(in addition to 027 and 078 types) was the fourth (9 in
142) most frequently identified type in this study (Figure
1) [28,29]. In the current study, the R17 type was only
found in samples obtained from central Taiwan, but the
exact distribution of PCR-ribotypes requires further
investigation using a more precise sampling method.
Furthermore, PCR-ribotypes other than 001, 017, 027,
and 106 should be compared with standard PCR-ribotypes from the European reference laboratory.
While comparing PCR ribotyping to other techniques,
allelic diversity was identified as an important factor.
Previous studies identified that slpA type did not have
high enough variability to differentiate all PCR-ribotypes

[22]. The current study found that the CDR4, CDR9,
CDR48, CDR49, CDR60, and C6cd VNTR loci
[13,14,19] used in previous MLVA panels were variable
in each PCR-ribotypes (Additional file 2); this made
these panels too discriminatory for congruency with the
PCR-ribotypes here. In contrast, the highly discriminatory MLST method had an index of discrimination of
0.9, similar to that of the PCR-ribotype (0.92), and the
resulting ST recognized 80% of the PCR-ribotypes [21];
the TRST resulted in an allelic diversity (0.967) equal to
that of PCR ribotyping (0.967), and is the technique
most related to PCR ribotyping among these studies
[20]. In the present study, the ten VNTR loci used in
MLVA10 were cd5, cd6, cd7, cd12, cd22, cd27, cd31,
H9cd, F3cd, and CDR59, which exhibited a slightly
lower allelic diversity (0.54-0.83) than the previously
used CDR4, CDR9, CDR48, CDR49, CDR60, and C6cd
VNTR loci (0.84-0.96) [13,14,19,20] (Table 1), resulting
in a combined allelic diversity of 0.957 (Table 2). This
value is similar to TRST (0.967) and PCR-ribotype
(0.967). Therefore, both TRST and MLVA10 showed a
high level of agreement with the PCR-ribotype (86.0 and
88.2%, respectively) (Table 2). However, the MLVA
technique is easier to perform than the sequence-based
techniques, such as TRST and MLST, and MLVA panels
are more easily combined, such as when adding the
MLVA4 panel for outbreak strain detection.

Wei et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/217

To represent the currently known PCR-ribotypes for
C. difficile, a combination of multiple VNTR loci with
different allelic diversity is recommended. In our initial
study, no single VNTR locus was discriminatory enough
to recognize all PCR-ribotypes or specific enough to
belong to each PCR-ribotype (data not shown), as previously observed for MLVA and MLST of N. meningitidis [24]. Therefore, 40 VNTR loci distributed
throughout the genome of the C. difficile 630 strain
were used for comparison analyses, and we found that
the MLVA34 panel yielded groups most related to the
PCR-ribotype groups (Table 2; Figure 1). Our screening
method was based on two rationales: 1) the PCR-ribotype recognized the major PFGE type [9] and was
expected to be congruent with the major genotypic
groups of C. difficile; and 2) the locus markers distributed throughout the chromosome were more likely to
identify genotypic change [13].
In the current study we also highlighted the fact that
group definition was required for comparisons. The allelic diversity of MLVA10 types varied among the different PCR-ribotypes (Additional file 4), and led to only
60% congruence between the types of MLVA10 and
PCR ribotyping (data not shown). In significant contrast,
the congruence reached 98% when groups obtained by
the two techniques were compared (Table 2). These
observations were similar to those found in the comparison between MLVA34 and PCR-ribotyping (Additional
file 4). Even though there was a high level of agreement
between groups identified by the two techniques, some
discordance was found. For example, PCR-ribotype
group 11 was represented by two MLVA10 groups
(10_48 and 10_11) (Figure 1), and the isolates in group
11 were suspected to have undergone concerted evolution [30,31]; however, this assumption needs to be
further confirmed by MLST.
For the detection of outbreak strains, two MLVA
panels, each composed of seven VNTR loci, have been
developed. One panel consisted of CDR4, CDR5, CDR9,
CDR48, CDR49, CDR59, and CDR60, and the other
panel consisted of C6cd, H9cd, F3cd, CDR4, CDR9,
CDR48, and CDR49 [13,14]. However, our study indicated that MLVA4, which consisted of C6cd, CDR4,
CDR49, and CDR60, was able to discriminate all 142
test strains (Table 3), as previously observed for MLVA
of Salmonella typhimurium [32]. Furthermore, all of
these VNTR loci exhibited higher allelic number and
copy number variation than previously reported (Table
1) [14]. Our results may be explained by two reasons: 1)
among these loci, CDR60 loci was found exhibit incomplete copy number and was assigned by repeat array
size, as this could increase the allelic number; and 2) we
validated these loci in a more random population than
previous studies [13,14], which would increase the value

Page 9 of 13

of allelic diversity. In addition, we used a categorical
coefficient instead of STRD to analyze the MLVA data
and to analyze the loci represented by the repeat array
size. Although this may reduce the sensitivity to differentiate the outbreak strains, analyses using the STRD
coefficient were found to be too variable and may
obscure the epidemiological links between C. difficile
outbreak strains when several repeats at a locus are
deleted or duplicated simultaneously [33].
All clusters detected by MLVA4 and MLVA10 combined can be explained by epidemiological information.
Apart from the two patients from cluster D were C. difficile infection cases, other patients from other clusters
were assumed to be C. difficile carriers (Figure 4; Additional file 3). The major limitation of this validation for
the study of outbreak strains was the sample population
we used; the 142 test strains used in the current study
were a randomly sampled population that did not contain outbreak strains, and the genetic relationship
between these was distant. For these reasons, this may
have overestimated the discriminatory power of the
MLVA 4. Therefore, the MLVA4 panel requires further
validation using closely related strains, such as outbreak
strains from hospitals, before any conclusions as to its
discriminatory power can be made.
Five imperfect VNTR loci (cd5, cd6, cd7, CDR59, and
CDR60) were used in this study, except for CDR59, the
other four loci were long-repeat VNTR loci with incomplete repeats (Additional file 1). The incomplete repeats
may be caused by insertions and deletions, which often
result in horizontal gene transfer between bacteria
strains and obscured the phylogenic relationship in the
bacteria population [34]. However, the long-repeat
regions exhibited a higher frequency of recombinations,
and were considered attractive candidate regions that
could be used for determining phylogenetic relatedness
between species and strains [35]. The long-repeat VNTR
loci have been known to be responsible for adaptive
evolution, as for antigenic variation [34], and were also
used to differentiate the C. botulinum and N. meningitides[36,37]. Therefore, we analyzed these imperfect
VNTR loci for use in the screening for appropriate
panels that showed agreement PCR-ribotyping. Our data
showed that cd5, cd6, and cd7 loci did not decrease the
congruency with PCR-ribotyping (Table 2; Additional
File 2). The result may be due to that the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, on which the PCR-ribotyping based
on, was not as conserved as a housekeeping gene that is
used to construct the phylogenic tree [9,38]. However,
the variations from these incomplete repeat loci should
be detected in our follow-up surveillance.
PCR ribotyping is a standard technique used worldwide
for epidemic clone detection, but the ambiguous data generated by this technique is difficult for assessing inter-

Wei et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/217

laboratory efficacy. MLVA is a fast and easy-to-use
method, and its numerical profile output is more transferable than the standard PCR ribotyping technique. In our
laboratory setting, the cost of PCR ribotyping, MLVA10,
and TRST per isolate was $0.87, $2.53, and $13.60, respectively, and the cost of the most recent MLST is $24.65
according to Griffiths’ estimation [21]. In the current
study, the cost of MLVA10 was slightly higher than that of
PCR ribotyping, but was still significantly less expensive
than the TRST and MLST sequence-based typing techniques. Moreover, when analyzing a large number of isolates, it is simpler to perform one genotyping technique
than multiple techniques. Taken together, the MLVA10 is
recommended for the detection of C. difficile PCR-ribotype groups and for use in combination with the MLVA
panel designed for the detection of outbreak strains.
Future studies will involve evaluation of MLVA10 for its
phylogenetic information by comparison to MLST typing.

Conclusions
For the classification of C. difficile strains, the MLVA
technique can result in a distinguishable data set that is
more useful for comparison and is highly congruent with
PCR-ribotype results. The MLVA10 panel may be used
either to detect the PCR-ribotype groups or to overcome
the drawbacks of the PCR ribotyping technique. In addition, the MLVA4 can be used to detect closely-related
strains. These two MLVA panels can be combined and
used for epidemiological studies of C. difficile.
Methods
Bacterial strains

A total of 142 C. difficile strains that were either toxigenic or non-toxigenic were used in this study. Five reference strains (NCTC11204, NCTC13366, NCTC13287,
NCTC13404, and NCTC13307) were purchased from the
National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, London,
UK) and three reference strains (BCRC17900,
BCRC17702, and BCRC17678) were purchased from the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC,
Hsinchu, Taiwan). One strain (NAP1/027) was kindly
provided by Dr. Brandi Limbago from the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
133 strains were isolated from clinical laboratory specimens in Taiwan. Among local isolates, 73 strains were
isolated from outpatients, and 60 strains were isolated
from hospitalized patients that were comprised of 38
from adult wards and 22 from children’s wards.
Specimen, epidemiological data collection, and bacterial
isolation

All specimen strains were provided by five clinical
laboratories between November 27, 2007 and December
31, 2008. The corresponding epidemiological data for

Page 10 of 13

each strain were provided by clinical laboratory staff.
Four laboratories were located in central Taiwan, and
one laboratory in the southern part of Taiwan. All five
clinical laboratories cultured all available stool or rectalswab specimens on Cycloserine Cefoxitin Fructose Agar
(Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) and the plates were incubated
under anaerobic conditions for 48 h. All suspected C.
difficile colonies were sent in an anaerobic pack and
delivered within 24 h to the central-region laboratory at
the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan for further
identification. All purified isolates were stored in 15%
glycerol at -80°C.
Isolate identification and toxigenic-type characterization
Text for this sub-section

All suspected C. difficile colonies were analyzed for a
species-specific internal fragment of the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) housekeeping gene, and toxigenic
type was characterized by PCR amplification of internal
fragments of the toxin A gene (tcdA) and the toxin B
(tcdB) gene, as previously described [39]. Briefly, each
candidate colony was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water
and then boiled for 15 min to prepare DNA. Tpi-, tcdA, and tcdB-specific primers [39] were used in independent PCR reactions. PCR was performed in 20 μL
volumes containing the following components: 50 ng
DNA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μM of each primer, 200 μM
dNTPs, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (BioVan, Taiwan) in a 1× amplification buffer solution (10 mM TrisHCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2). PCR
was performed on a GeneAmp System 2400 thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems). The PCR cycle conditions
were as follows: 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a
final extension at 72°C for 3 min. PCR products were
resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide.
VNTR identification and selection

The full-length sequences of C. difficile QCD-32g58 and
C. difficile 630 were compared using VNTRDB software
[25] to find tandem repeat loci in the genome. Tandem
repeats with a repeat length >2 bp and ≥70% consensus
match were initially selected for screening by PCR from
the BCRC17678 and BCRC17702 reference strains and
four experimental isolates. Primers that flanked the tandem repeat region were designed using the online Primer 3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3;
Additional file 5). VNTR screening was initially performed by PCR amplification of each candidate tandem
repeat locus in genomic DNA from six isolates. The
variability of each tandem repeat locus was assessed by
gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, and sequence
analysis was performed to determine the size of the

Wei et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/217

resulting PCR products and the tandem repeat copy
number.
To find a MLVA panel most congruent to PCR ribotyping, 40 VNTR loci were sorted by allelic diversity
and then arranged to form various panels by sequentially removing the highest allelic diversity loci. Each
panel was compared with PCR ribotyping, and the congruence between the two techniques was calculated
using the Rand coefficient [40].
The simplest MLVA panel that would yield a
MLVA34-like genotype distribution of 142 C. difficile
strains was found as follows. First, the partitions given
by each of the 34 VNTR loci were calculated based on
Wallace coefficients to evaluate their predictable value
by the other 33 loci. Loci that showed either more predictability or lower allelic diversity than other loci in the
MLVA34 panel were excluded. There were 22, 24, and
26 loci excluded when the predictable values were
higher than 75, 70, and 65%, respectively. This exclusion
resulted in the MLVA12, MLVA10, and MLVA8 panels
(Additional file 6). All MLVA panels were analyzed by
the minimum spanning tree (MST) method, and the
concordance between MLVA groupings and PCR-ribotype data were calculated.
DNA preparation

Genomic C. difficile DNA was purified using the
QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic
DNA isolated from C. difficile were then used for PCR
amplification of VNTR and PCR ribotyping.
Sequence analysis

PCR amplification of the 47 VNTR candidates was performed on six strains with the primer sets shown in
Table 1. Each PCR was performed in a 10 μL reaction
containing the following reagents: 25 ng genomic DNA,
1 μL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, and
1.5 mM MgCl 2 ; BioVan, Taiwan), 250 μM MgCl 2 , 1%
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 200 μM dNTPs,
0.5 μM primer set, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (BioVan, Taiwan). The PCR cycle conditions were as follows:
94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 50°
C or 52°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 50 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. Sequence analysis of the PCR products was performed by Mission Biotech Corporation
with the ABI Big Dye Terminator Kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and the same primers used for PCR.
Multilocus VNTR amplification

PCR amplification of the 48 selected C. difficile VNTR
loci was performed on DNA extracted from 142 C. difficile isolates. The primer sets, annealing temperatures,
and primer panels are shown in Additional file 5.

Page 11 of 13

Amplification of the 47 VNTR loci was carried out in
12 multiplex PCR reactions and one single PCR reaction
(Additional file 5: M1-M13). Amplification of the 14
VNTR loci of MLVA4 and MLVA10 was carried out in
four multiplex PCR reactions (Additional file 5: M14M17). The PCRs were performed in 10 μL reactions
containing the following reagents: 25 ng genomic DNA,
1 μL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl,
and 1.5 mM MgCl2; BioVan, Taiwan), 250 μM MgCl2,
1%DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 200 μM
dNTPs, 0.02-0.1 μM primer set, and 1 U Taq DNA
polymerase (BioVan, Taiwan). The PCR cycle conditions
were as follows: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of
94°C for 40 s, annealing temperature for 90 s, and 72°C
for 50 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. Fragment analysis of the multiplex PCR products was performed as follows: 1 μL of each 20-fold-diluted PCR
product, 0.1 μL GeneScan 500 LIZ size standard
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and 8.9 μL HiDi
(Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) were mixed and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. The products were then analyzed on an ABI3130 sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems). The obtained fragment sizes were
exported as an Excel spreadsheet file (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The corresponding copy numbers were calculated by comparison to the size of reference strains
using Excel software (Microsoft). The equation used for
calculation of copy number is as follows:
Copy number of VNTRn = [(Fs-Fr)/repeat size of
VNTRn] + copy number of reference strain, where Fs,
fragment size of test strains in each VNTR loci; Fr, fragment size of reference in each VNTR loci; VNTRn,
either locus in 40 VNTR loci.
Capillary gel electrophoresis-based PCR ribotyping

Genomic DNA from all the C. difficile strains was
amplified with the primer set designed by Bidet et al.
[18], and the electrophoresis-based PCR-ribotyping was
performed using a method modified from Indra et al.
[19]. Briefly, the primer was labeled with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) dye to enable DNA sequence analysis. The
PCR mixture included the following reagents: 25 ng
genomic DNA, 1 μL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3],
50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2; BioVan, Taiwan), 200
μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, and 1 U Taq polymerase
(BioVan, Taiwan) in a 20 μL final volume. One microliter of each 20-fold-diluted PCR product, 0.8 μL Genflo625 ROX-labelled DNA Ladder (Chimerx, USA), and
8.2 μL HiDi (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) were
mixed and denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then analyzed with a ABI3130 sequence detection system. The
ribotype fragments for the full-length sequencing of
strain NCTC13307 (C. difficile 630) were first predicted
by the PCR-amplification function from in silico analysis

Wei et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:217
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/217

using the website (http://insilico.ehu.es), and the curve
file from the ABI sequencer was confirmed by the predicted size. Ribotypes 001, 012, 017, 027, and 106 were
set up by comparing the curve files with the five reference strains NCTC11204, NCTC13307, NCTC13366,
NCTC 13287, and NCTC13404, respectively. All PCRribotypes were named with an “R” prefix before the
serial number.
Allelic diversity and typeability measurement

The allelic diversity of each VNTR locus was measured
by its Simpson’s index [41] and confidence interval (CI)
[42]. The ability of each VNTR locus to type the 142
isolates was measured as follows:
Number of isolates amplified in each VNTR locus/142.
Data analysis

The copy numbers of the VNTR loci from all of the 142
isolates were imported into the Bionumerics software
(Applied Maths, Belgium), and the categorical coefficient
and the highest number of single-locus-changes were
used for the minimum spanning tree construction [43].
The curve files of all the ribotypes from the ABI sequencer were imported into the Bionumerics software for
further standardization. The PCR-ribotyping fingerprints
of all the isolates were analyzed using the Unweighted
Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)
clustering algorithm, using the Dice coefficient (tolerance: 0.2%). The quantitative level of congruence
between the typing techniques was based on the
adjusted Rand (AR); the predictable value between
VNTR loci was based on Wallace’s coefficients, using an
online tool for the quantitative assessment of classification agreement (http://darwin.phyloviz.net/ComparingPartitions) [40].
