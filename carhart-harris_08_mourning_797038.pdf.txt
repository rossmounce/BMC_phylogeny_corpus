Abstract
Freud began his career as a neurologist studying the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system,
but it was his later work in psychology that would secure his place in history. This paper draws
attention to consistencies between physiological processes identified by modern clinical research
and psychological processes described by Freud, with a special emphasis on his famous paper on
depression entitled 'Mourning and melancholia'. Inspired by neuroimaging findings in depression and
deep brain stimulation for treatment resistant depression, some preliminary physiological
correlates are proposed for a number of key psychoanalytic processes. Specifically, activation of
the subgenual cingulate is discussed in relation to repression and the default mode network is
discussed in relation to the ego. If these correlates are found to be reliable, this may have
implications for the manner in which psychoanalysis is viewed by the wider psychological and
psychiatric communities.

hailed at first as a discovery and is also as a rule disputed as such, objective research soon afterwards
reveals that after all it was in fact no novelty' [1].

ory to the illness of depression. It is the task of this paper
to parallel the psychological processes described by Freud
with the physiological processes identified by modern
clinical research in order to furnish a more comprehensive
understanding of the whole phenomenon.

The intention of this paper is to draw attention to consistencies between Freudian metapsychology and recent findings in neuropsychiatry, especially those relating to
depression. A case will be made that findings in neuroimaging and neurophysiology can provide a fresh context for
some of the most fundamental theories of psychoanalysis.
In his famous paper 'Mourning and melancholia', Freud
carried out an elegant application of psychoanalytic the-

Under the tutelage of Meynert, Freud began his career as
neurologist studying the anatomy and physiology of the
medulla. Inspired by a Helmholtzian tradition (1821–
1894) and a 'psycho-physical parallelism' made fashionable by the likes of Hering (1838–1918), Sherrington
(1857–1952) and Hughlings-Jackson (1835–1911),
Freud began to consider more seriously how a science of
movements of energy in the brain might account for psy-

chological phenomena [2]. It has been argued that Freud
never truly abandoned his physiological roots [3,4] and
that his early flirtations with psycho-physical parallelism
continued to haunt 'the whole series of [his] theoretical
works to the very end' [4].
This paper will begin with an overview of some key concepts of Freudian metapsychology (libido, cathexis, object
cathexis, the ego, the super ego, the id, the unconscious,
the primary and secondary psychical process and repression) and an attempt will be made to hypothesise their
physiological correlates. This will be followed by a summary of 'Mourning and melancholia' and an extensive
look at relevant findings in neuropsychiatry. Of special
interest are neuroimaging findings in depression and
induced depressed mood, deep brain stimulation (DBS)
of the subgenual cingulate (Brodmann area 25/Cg25) for
the treatment of intractable depression, electrical stimulation of medial temporal regions, and regional atrophy
and glial loss in the brains of patients suffering from
major depression.
Before beginning, it is important to make a few brief comments on the principle of psycho-physical parallelism.
Drawing connections between psychological and biological phenomena was an approach that Freud was both critical of:
'I shall carefully avoid the temptation to determine
psychical locality in any anatomical fashion' [5].
'Every attempt to discover a localisation of mental
processes...has miscarried completely. The same fate
would await any theory that attempted to recognise
the anatomical position of the system [consciousness]
– as being in the cortex, and to localise the unconscious processes in the subcortical parts of the brain.
There is a hiatus here which at present cannot be filled,
nor is it one of the tasks of psychology to fill it. Our
psychical topography has for the present nothing to do
with anatomy' [6].
And receptive to:
'All our provisional ideas in psychology will presumably some day be based on an organic substructure' [7].
The ambiguity in Freud's position can be explained by his
criticism of the modular or 'segregationist' [8] approach
and preference for a more dynamic model [9]. Essentially,
Freud was opposed to 'flag polling' the anatomical causes
of psychological phenomena but not the drawing of parallels between psychological and physiological processes:

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

'It is probable that the chain of physiological events in
the nervous system does not stand in a causal connection with the psychical events. The physiological
events do not cease as soon as the psychical ones
begin; on the contrary, the physiological chain continues. What happens in simply that, after a certain point
in time, each (or some) of its links has a psychical phenomena corresponding to it. Accordingly, the psychical is a process parallel to the physiological – "a
dependent concomitant"' [9].
Integrating psychoanalysis with modern neuroscience is a
difficult and controversial endeavour. It should be made
clear from the outset what we believe it is possible for this
approach to achieve. Psychoanalysis can be viewed on
two levels: a hermeneutic, interpretative or meaning based
level; and a metapsychological, mental process based level.
The hermeneutic level is inherently subjective. The question has often been raised whether it is possible to identify
spatiotemporal coordinates of subjective meaning. This
view was shared by Paul McLean in his seminal book 'The
triune brain in evolution' [10]:
'Since the subjective brain is solely reliant on the derivation of immaterial information, it can never establish an immutable yardstick of its own...Information is
information, not matter or energy' [10].
It would be incorrect to align this position with dualism.
Psychophysical parallelism is a materialist approach that
acknowledges that meaning arises through time between
networks of communicative systems. It must be stated
that the evidence cited in this paper cannot logically validate psychoanalysis on the hermeneutic level and neither
does it provide evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalysis
as a treatment modality (see [11] for a review). What we
believe it can do, however, is bring together converging
lines of enquiry in support of the Freudian topography of
the mind. The findings cited below describe changes in
physiological processes paralleling changes in psychological processes; however, the objective measures do not
shed any light on the specific content or meaning held
within these processes. Aside from interpretation, much
of Freud's work was spent theorising about dynamic psychical processes; energies flowing into and out of mental
provinces, energy invested, dammed up and discharged
throughout the mind. It is this metapsychological level of
psychoanalysis that we believe is most accessible to integration with modern neuroscience.

An introduction to some key terms of Freudian
metapsychology
Libido
'Libido means in psycho-analysis in the first instance
the force (thought of as quantitatively variable and

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

measurable) of the sexual drives directed towards an
object – "sexual" in the extended sense required by
analytic theory' [12].
From its earliest recorded use [13] the term 'libido' was
used to connote the principal energy of the nervous system. Freud differentiated 'libido' from a more general
'psychical energy':
'We have defined the concept of libido as a quantitatively variable force which could serve as a measure of
processes and transformations occurring in the field of
sexual excitation. We distinguish this libido in respect
of its special origin from the energy which must be
supposed to underlie the mental processes in general'
[14].
Freud's extended use of the term 'sexual' brought him into
conflict with Jung, who argued that the principal energy of
the nervous system was not inherently sexual [15]. Arguably, the two perspectives are not irreconcilable. We may
view Freud's 'libido' in connection with the motivational
drive system (see The id below) and the withdrawal and
investment of cerebral energy (see The ego below). Jung's
'psychical energy' can be viewed less specifically as cerebral energy in general.

object cathexis which manifests in depression as anhedonia (see Hypofrontality below). As will be discussed in the
next section, activation of the DLPFC is accompanied by a
deactivation in a network of regions known as the defaultmode network (DMN) [19]. The DMN is highly active
during resting cognition. The regions engaged during
active cognition are referred to here as the object-oriented
network (ON). We propose that activation in the ON and
deactivation in the DMN correlates with the process of
object cathexis.
The ego
The German original 'das Ich' literally translates as 'the I'.
It is somewhat regrettable that Freud's terms have not
been translated more literally since the originals have an
appeal that is lost in translation. Freud used the concept
of the ego in a number of different ways; a useful way of
gaining a sense of the different applications therefore, is to
cite some examples of its use:

1. A referent to the conscious sense of self:
' [I]n each individual there is a coherent organisation
of mental processes; and this we call his ego. It is to
this ego that consciousness is attached' [1].
2. An unconscious force maintaining self-cohesion:

Cathexis
The German original 'Besetzung' literally translates as
'occupation', 'filling' or 'investment'. The neologism
'cathexis' was one that Freud was not especially fond of
[16]. Freud first used the term on an explicitly physiological level, referring to neurons 'cathected with a certain
quantity [of energy]' [2], systems 'loaded with a sum of
excitation' [17] and 'provided with a quota of affect' [18].
Succinctly, the term 'cathexis' means 'libidinal investment'. It is a vitally important concept for the integration
of Freudian metapsychology with principles of modern
neuroscience. In this paper, we discuss changes in haemodynamic response and other neurophysiological measures in relation to the withdrawal and investment of
libido.
Object cathexis
The concept of "the object" is used in a broad sense in psychoanalysis to refer to literal, abstract and symbolic
objects. People, tasks, work and ideas can all serve as
objects. The process of object cathexis can be compared
with the process of goal-directed cognition, since both
require libidinal investment. Based on neuroimaging data
in depression (see Neuropsychiatric findings in depression correlated with principles of Freudian metapsychology below), we propose that activation of the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) correlates with object cathexis,
and reduced DLPFC activation correlates with reduced

'It is certain that much of the ego is itself unconscious
and notably what we may call its nucleus; only a small
part of it is covered by the term "preconscious"' [20].
3. A nucleus of somatic cohesion:
'The ego is first and foremost a bodily ego' [1].
4. A reservoir of libido:
'Thus we form the idea of there being an original libidinal cathexis of the ego, from which some is later given
off to objects' [7].
'The ego is the true and original reservoir of libido'
[20].
5. The primary agent of repression:
' [T]he ego is the power that sets repression in motion'
[12].
Given the many different functions to the ego, it would be
counterintuitive to suggest that it is 'housed' in a single
given region of the brain. Based on a large number of neuroimaging studies, we propose that a highly connected
network of regions, principally incorporating the medial

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and medial temporal
regions [19,21-31] meets many of the criteria of the
Freudian ego. This conglomeration of activity has been
named the 'default mode network' [19] (Figure 1). A
recent analysis in a large sample of healthy volunteers has
shown that connectivity within the DMN undergoes a
marked increase with maturation from childhood to
adulthood [31]. Activity in the mPFC node of the DMN
has been closely associated with self-reflection (e.g.
[22,24,27,32]) and recent evidence suggests that the
mPFC exerts the principal causality within the network
[33]. The PCC and IPL have been associated with proprioception [34,35] and the PCC and medial temporal
regions have been associated with the retrieval of autobiographical memories [36-39]. The DMN shows a high
level of functional connectivity at rest [28,33]. Activity in
this network consistently decreases during engagement in
goal-directed cognition [28,33,40] and connectivity
within the network tends to decrease during states of
reduced consciousness [41,42]. Expressed in Freudian
terms, goal-directed cognition requires a displacement of
libido (energy) from the ego's reservoir (the DMN) and its
investment in objects (activation of the DLPFC). There is
evidence that this function is impaired in a number of
psychiatric disorders, including depression [43-48].

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

'The ego is a great reservoir from which the libido that
is destined for objects flows out and into which it
flows back from those objects' [49].
In addition to the mPFC and PCC nodes of the DMN and
their relation to the ego, we speculate on the basis of neuroimaging data and findings from deep brain stimulation
(see Neuropsychiatric findings in depression correlated
with principles of Freudian metapsychology below), that
ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) exerts a strong repressive hold
over emotional and motivational ('visceromotor') centres
[50]. This repressive force is the most primitive function
of the ego. As will be elaborated later, the posterior
vmPFC plays a major role in the pathophysiology of
depression. For example, inhibition of the region ventral
to the genu of the copus callosum, the subgenual cingulate or Cg25 has been found to alleviate depressive symptomology in patients suffering from treatment resistant
depression (TRD) [51]. The subgenual cingulate and
regions proximal to it appear to exert a modulatory influence over key 'visceromotor' centres such as the amygdala,
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) [50,52]. Certain limbic centres (e.g., the
amygdala) have been shown to be pathologically active in
depression (see [50] for a review).
The ego ideal/super ego
The concept of the 'ego ideal' was introduced by Freud in
his paper 'On narcissism' [7], forming the basis of what

cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), inferior parietal lobule and medial temporal regions. Activity
in these regions has been shown to decrease during the performance of goal-directed cognition. The areas shown in blue are
negatively correlated with the default mode network (DMN) and may be described as an object-oriented network (ON). The
ON is consistently activated during goal-directed cognitions but is relatively inactive at rest. It is argued in the present work
that the DMN is functionally consistent with the Freudian ego. Image reproduced with permission from http://www.blackwellsynergy.com[289].

would later become 'the super ego' [1] (German original
= 'Das über-Ich'; 'the over-I'). The ego ideal/super ego
plays a fundamental role in the aetiology of depression:
'Repression, we have said, proceeds from the ego, we
might say with greater precision that it proceeds from
the self-respect of the ego' [7].
Freud described this more fully in the following passage:
'The ego ideal is...the target of the self-love which was
enjoyed in childhood by the actual ego. The subject's
narcissism makes its appearance displaced on to this
new ideal ego, which like the infantile ego finds itself
possessed of every perfection that is of value. As always
where the libido is concerned, man has here shown
himself incapable of giving up a satisfaction he had
once enjoyed. He is not willing to forgo the narcissistic
perfection of his childhood; and when as he grows up,
he is disturbed by the admonitions of others and by
the awakening of his own critical judgement, so that
he can no longer retain that perfection, he seeks to
recover it in the new form of an ideal. What he projects
before him as his ideal is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood in which he was his own
ideal' [7].
It is difficult to postulate a neurodynamic correlate of such
a high-level concept as the ego ideal or super ego. The following model should therefore be considered speculative
and preliminary. The super ego might be thought of as an
umbrella term for high-level cognitions that work to
appraise the ego's ability to meet an imagined ideal. This
ideal-ego or 'ego ideal' is acquired through an internalisation of value judgements of others (e.g., one's early care
givers) under social and environmental demands (see
Mourning and melancholia below). Through the super
ego, the ego receives feedback on how closely it corresponds with an imagined ideal. If the super ego judges the
ego as falling short of this ideal, or if the super ego judges
the ego's or the id's drives as unhealthy or dangerous in
the context of its social environment, then the ego may
repel these drives, withholding them from consciousness.
The implications of the super ego's instruction to repress
will be discussed in the next section in relation to depression.
It is highly unlikely that the ego ideal/super ego is housed
in any specific region of the brain but we may speculate
about dynamic physiological processes paralleling psychological ones. Thus, paralleling the super ego's value
judgements of the ego may be feedback between the
DLPFC of the ON and the mPFC of the DMN. Information communicated between these two systems (see The

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

ego above) may parallel the experience of pursuing an
ideal and judging how successfully it is met.
In relation to the unconscious, punishing aspect of the
super-ego it might be useful to consider the role of the
anterior cingulate (ACC). Activation of the ACC has been
associated with error detection and guilt [8,53,54]. It may
be significant that a recent analysis of functional connectivity in the human cingulate revealed strong connectivity
between the ACC and the DLPFC [54]. Conversely, Cg25
was found to be strongly connected with regions of the
DMN such as the OFC. It is possible that feedback
between the DLPFC and the mPFC is mirrored at a lower
level by feedback between the ACC, OFC and Cg25. Feedback between the ON and DMN likely takes place via cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical circuitry.
The super ego's control over the ego gives it a unique
power to influence the motility and expression of the
drives. Impassioned behaviours deemed dangerous to the
ego in the context of its environment may be denied
expression by activating Cg25 and the DMN. Integrating
this hypothesis into a model of depression, we can postulate that activating Cg25 and the DMN controls the full
expression of affective, mnemonic and motivational
behaviours promulgated by visceromotor centres. Thus,
engaging Cg25 contains limbic activity within paralimbicthalamic circuits maintained by the Cg25 in reaction to
sustained limbic arousal (for relevant models, see
[46,50,55-58]).
The id
The German original 'das es' literally translates as 'the it'.
As with the German word for the ego (das Ich), the original word for the id has an appeal that is lost in translation.
The id was one of Freud's later concepts, being introduced
in his paper 'The ego and the id' [1]. Some have argued
that the id is synonymous with the unconscious, and it is
true that two are closely related:

'The id and the unconscious are as intimately linked as
the ego and the preconscious' [59].
'The truth is that it is not only the psychically repressed
that remains alien to our consciousness, but also some
of the impulses which dominate our ego' [6].
Although the id and the unconscious are related, they also
retain some important differences, both psychologically
and physiologically. Essentially, the id refers to the unconscious as a system in a topographical sense [60]. Freud
described the id as an archaic psychical system governed
by primitive drives.

Page 5 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

'We now distinguish in our mental life (which we
regard as an apparatus compounded of several agencies, districts or provinces) one region which we call
the ego proper and another which we name the id. The
id is the older of the two; the ego has developed out of
it, like a cortical layer, through the influence of the
external world. It is in the id that all our primary drives
are at work, all the processes in the id take place
unconsciously' [61].
The function of the id corresponds closely with that of the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system [62]. The NAc and
VTA are especially sensitive to rewarding stimuli [63].
Neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that
rewarding stimuli activate dopaminergic cells in the VTA
[64-66] eliciting an increase of dopamine release in the
NAc [67]. Jaak Panksepp has described the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system as the appetitive, motivational or
'seeking' system [68]. High voltage electrical stimulation
of the NAc in both animals and humans has been found
to elicit pleasurable and sexual responses [68,69] and
ejaculation in human males has been found to correlate
with activation of the VTA [64].
The unconscious
James Strachey explained in a footnote to Freud's paper
'The unconscious' [6] that the German word for 'unconscious' ('das unbewusste') typically translates as 'not consciously known' and does not have the unhelpful
connotation of the English equivalent meaning 'knocked
out' or 'comatose'. This information is useful for an understanding of this difficult concept. Along with repression,
the theory of a conscious/unconscious dynamic is one of
the most important in psychoanalysis. The term unconscious is used in both a topographical ('the system unconscious') and descriptive sense (e.g., 'rendered
unconscious') [60]. When we speak of 'the unconscious',
it is usually the topographical meaning that is being
employed. In this paper, we refer to 'the unconscious' as
an archaic psychical system with its own characteristic
phenomenology and physiology.

James Uleman comments in the introduction to the book
'The new unconscious' [70] that 'the psychoanalytic
unconscious is widely acknowledged to be a failure as a
scientific theory because evidence of its major components cannot be observed, measured precisely, or manipulated easily'. In order to address this not unreasonable
charge, it is important for those who have 'turned their
ear' to the unconscious to devise a method of demonstrating its phenomenology to those who have not. A case will
be made in this paper that the study of consistent phenomenologies in a number of different altered states of
consciousness such as dreaming, acute psychotic states,
the aura of temporal lobe epilepsy and psychedelic drug

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

induced states will provide converging evidences for the
existence of a characteristic psychical system. It is hoped
that identifying the neurophysiological activity paralleling the subjective phenomena in these states will provide
the necessary scientific breakthrough to finally do away
with the persuasive impression that the unconscious does
not exist.
Identifying the correlates of 'primary process' (see The primary and secondary psychical process below) activities
taking place during wakefulness is extremely difficult
given the relatively rigid, impervious nature of normal
waking consciousness. The altered states of consciousness
mentioned above are comparatively much more yielding.
For example, during transient episodes of 'dreamlike' cognition, the normal processes of repression may be disturbed, allowing unconscious material to flow into
consciousness with greater freedom. In a recent review of
human intracranial electroencephalography recordings of
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, acute psychotic states,
temporal lobe auras and psychedelic drug states, CarhartHarris identified bursts of rhythmic theta and slow-wave
activity in the medial temporal regions in all these states
and hypothesised that these discharges of limbic theta are
the signature activity of the unconscious mind, described
by Freud as 'the primary psychical process' [71].
The primary and secondary psychical process
'We have found that processes in the unconscious or
in the id obey different laws from those in the preconscious ego. We name these laws in their totality the primary process, in contrast to the secondary process
which governs the course of events in the preconscious, in the ego' [59].

Dating back to his early work on dissociative states [72],
Freud described two distinct laws or principles governing
the distribution of psychical energy in the mind: (1) the
secondary psychical process of normal waking consciousness
which exerts a tonic inhibitory hold over the primary psychical process in accordance with the demands of social
context; (2) The archaic and ontogenetically and phylogenetically regressive primary psychical process. The primary
psychical process describes the relatively motile, freeflowing activity of the unconscious mind. The primary
psychical process becomes observable when the forces of
repression are circumvented by the forces of the unconscious. Such episodes are characterised by a fluidity of
association – perceptually and cognitively, and a flooding
of affect.
This paper takes the position that discharges of rhythmic
theta and slow-wave activity from the medial temporal
lobes to the association cortices are the signature activity

Page 6 of 23

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

of the primary psychical process of the unconscious mind
[71].
Repression
Freud described repression in the following ways:

'The theory of repression is the corner-stone on which
the whole structure of psycho-analysis rests' [7].
' [T]he essence of repression lies simply in turning
something away, and keeping it at a distance, from the
conscious' [6].
' [R]epression is brought to bear invariably on ideas
which evoke a distressing affect (unpleasure) in the
ego' [2].
'The repressions behave like dams against the pressure
of water' [73].
'The mechanisms of repression...[involve] a withdrawal
of the cathexis of energy (or of libido)' [6].
Based on the evidence reviewed below, we propose that
the Cg25, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and vmPFC exert
a strong repressive hold over visceromotor centres, serving
to restrain untempered drive and flurries of unconscious
material from discharging into the cortices and being consciously registered (Figure 2). It is likely however that
there are different gradations of repression and that the
repressive function takes place more through a set of processes than the action of a specific nucleus. We maintain
that Cg25 exerts the principal suppressive effect on visceromotor centres but it is likely that the vmPFC and OFC
facilitate this action (see The function of the vmPFC and
OFC in relation to repression below). We also speculate

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

that the repressive function is modulated by information
transmitted through feedback between the ON and the
DMN (see The ego idea/super ego above).
'For the ego, the formation of an ideal would be the
conditioning factor for repression' [7].

Mourning and melancholia
In 'Mourning and melancholia' [74], Freud compared the
experience of mourning with the pathological state of
depression:
'It is well worth notice that, although mourning
involves grave departures from the normal attitude to
life, it never occurs to us to regard it as a pathological
condition and refer to it medical treatment. We rely on
it being overcome after a certain lapse of time, and we
look upon any interference with it as useless or even
harmful. The distinguishing mental features of melancholia, are a profoundly painful sense of dejection, a
cessation of interest in the outside world, loss of
capacity to love, inhibition of all activity...a lowering
of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds
utterance in self-reproaches and self-revilings, and culminates in a delusional expectation of punishment'
[74].
Freud described how both mourning and depression
involve a forced withdrawal of object cathexis. Since this
withdrawal is involuntary, it is experienced as a painful
process against which the ego protests. The ego denies the
loss and strives to place within its grasp a substitute object
– whether real or imaginary, in fantasy or hallucination.
In cases of successful recovery, the energetic ties which
once bound the subject to the object begin to be severed

and the libidinal energies that flowed out of the ego and
into the object are displaced into alternative objects.
In depression, the attempted recovery begins in a similar
manner to mourning, with a protest from the ego and
search for a substitute object. However, failing to find a
suitable replacement in the outside world and refusing to
concede that the object is lost, the ego draws within itself
its own cathexes. The energies, which were before sent out
freely from the ego, now return from the object to condense and concentrate upon it.
'Thus the shadow of the object fell upon the ego' [74].
In depression, this is experienced as an increase in introspection and a reciprocal decrease in interest in the outside world. The ego, having taken itself as its own object,
begins a process of self-evaluation. The self-questioning
becomes fiercely critical as ambivalent feelings felt
towards the lost object and self-rapprochement for failing
to live up to ideals are targeted at the ego.
'The object cathexis...was brought to an end. But the
free libido was not displaced onto another object; it
was withdrawn into the ego. There, however, it was
not employed in an unspecified way, but served to
establish an identification of the ego with the abandoned object. Thus, the shadow of the object fell upon
the ego, and the latter could henceforth be judged by
a special agency, as though it were an object, the forsaken object. In this way an object-loss was transformed into an ego-loss and the conflict between the
ego and the loved person into a cleavage between the
critical activity of the ego and the ego as altered by
identification' [74].
Object loss in mourning relates to a literal death; the psychological significance of which is well appreciated by the
mourner and those around him/her. Accordingly, expressions of sadness in mourning are viewed as appropriate,
healthy and cathartic. In depression however, the negative
affect that accompanies the condition is often viewed as
disproportionate to the individual's circumstances – both
by the individual him/herself and by others. In contrast to
mourning, Freud argued that the intense, ostensibly disproportionate level of negative affect experienced in
depression is symptomatic of unpleasant and problematic
emotions (e.g., love and resentment) that are denied a
fully conscious actualisation:
' [In depression], one cannot see clearly what it is that
has been lost, and it is all the more reasonable to suppose that the patient cannot consciously perceive what
he has lost either. This, indeed, might be so even if the
patient is aware of the loss that has given rise to his

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

melancholia, but only in the sense he knows whom he
has lost but not what he has lost in him. This would
suggest that melancholia is in some way related to an
object-loss which is withdrawn from consciousness, in
contradistinction to mourning, in which there is nothing about the loss that is unconscious' [74].
If we are to be consistent with Freud's economic theory of
libido [2], the intensity of the mental anguish experienced
in depression is proportionate to the intensity of the emotion held back from consciousness, and the severity of
aggression directed towards the self is proportionate to
the severity of aggression that, were it not for repression,
would be propelled towards the object:
'Ambivalence gives a pathological cast to mourning
and forces it to express itself in the form of selfreproaches to the effect that the mourner himself is to
blame for the loss of the loved object, i.e., that he has
willed it... If the love for the object – a love which cannot be given up though the object itself is given up –
takes refuge in narcissistic identification, then the hate
comes into operation on this substitutive object, abusing it, debasing it, making it suffer and deriving sadistic satisfaction from its suffering... It is sadism alone
that solves the riddle of the tendency to suicide, which
makes the melancholic so interesting – and so dangerous. So immense is the ego's self-love, which we have
come to recognise as the primal state from which
instinctual life proceeds, and so vast is the amount of
narcissistic libido that we see liberated in the threat to
life, that we cannot conceive how the ego can consent
to its own destruction. We have known, it is true, that
no neurotic harbours thoughts of suicide which he has
not turned back upon himself from murderous
impulses against others' [74].
In addition to the anger and resentment that is turned
towards the ego, the ego is admonished for failing to live
up to expectations. 'Mourning and melancholia' was written shortly after Freud introduced the idea of 'the ego
ideal' [17] that would later become 'the super ego' [1]. As
discussed in section 1.5, the super ego is a critical agency
that judges the ego in relation to its own ideal.
'The melancholic displays something else besides
which is lacking in mourning – an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his
ego on a grand scale. In mourning it is the world that
has become poor and empty; in melancholia it is the
ego itself. The patient represents his ego to us as worthless, incapable of any achievement and morally despicable; he reproaches himself, vilifies himself and
expects to be punished. He abases himself before eve-

ryone and commiserates with his own relatives for
being connected with someone so unworthy' [74].
The super ego is of central importance in psychoanalytic
theory, but it is a much more difficult concept to identify
physiologically than e.g., libido or cathexis. Freud argued
that the super ego results from a process that took place in
infancy (the Oedipus complex) as a recapitulation of a
process that occurred in the development of the species
[75]. Through this process, the infant was coerced via
parental and communal authority to renounce its libidinal demands. Although the infant's free reign was put to
an end, he/she internalised the demands for concession
and turned them into an image of an ideal:
'The broad general outcome of the sexual phase dominated by the Oedipus complex may, therefore, be
taken to be the forming of a precipitate in the ego, consisting of these two identifications in some way united
with each other. This modification of the ego retains
its special position; it confronts the other contents of
the ego as an ego ideal or super ego' [1].
'The super ego retains the character of the father, the
more powerful the Oedipus complex was and the
more rapidly it succumbed to repression (under the
influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling
and reading), the stricter will be the domination of the
super ego over the ego later on – in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt'
[1].
' [I]n the undertaking of repression, the ego is at bottom following the commands of its super ego – commands which, in their turn, originate from influences
in the external world that have found representation
in the super ego. The fact remains that the ego has
taken sides with those powers, that in it their demands
have more strength than the instinctual demands of
the id, and that the ego is the power that sets the
repression in motion against the portion of the id concerned' [1].
To summarise the key processes involved in depression as
outlined by Freud: the illness is triggered by the loss of an
object imbued with a particularly intense level of libidinal
cathexis, there is a forced withdrawal of cathexis, a regression of libido into the ego, a critical judgement of the ego
based on its failure to live up to ideals, and a simultaneous
attacking of the ego by repressed emotions felt towards
the lost object.
' [Melancholias] show us the ego divided, fallen apart
into two pieces, one which rages against the second.
This second piece is the one which has been altered by

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

introjection and which contains the lost object. But
the piece that behaves so cruelly is not unknown to us
either. It comprises the conscience, a critical agency
within the ego, which even in normal times takes up a
critical attitude towards the ego, though never so
relentlessly and so unjustifiably' [76].

Neuropsychiatric findings in depression
correlated with principles of Freudian
metapsychology
Hypofrontality
One of the most consistent findings in the neuroimaging
of depression is decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
glucose metabolism in the PFC, particularly the DLPFC
[77-85] (figure 3). The PFC is a large and functionally heterogeneous structure. Studies of frontal activity in depression have highlighted these differences, with the DLPFC,
associated with cognitive and executive functions showing decreased activity in depressed states, and the ventral
PFC, associated with emotional processing, showing
increased activity during episodes of emotional rumination (see [86] or [50]).

Several studies have found negative correlations between
depression severity and frontal metabolism [78,81,8793]. The induction of depressed symptomology in healthy
volunteers and remitted depressed patients has been
found to correlate reliably with decreases in frontal activity [56,94,95]. Frontal blood flow and metabolism tends
to normalise after spontaneous or treatment-induced
remission [51,78,79,96-105]. These studies highlight the
reliability of frontal hypometabolism, particularly in the
DLPFC, in neuroimaging studies of depression.
Based on the neuroimaging data we speculate that
hypoactivity in the DLPFC is a correlate of withdrawn
object cathexis experienced subjectively as impoverished
motivation and diminished interest in the matters outside
of the self. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study reported a positive correlation between
subjective measures of anhedonia and activity in the
vmPFC and OFC (Brodmann areas (BA)10, 11, and 32)
[106]. Importantly, an additional relationship was found
between anhedonia scores and diminished activation of
the amygdala and the ventral striatum. As will be
explained in the following section, in depression, Cg25
can be envisaged as functioning in a manner analogous to
a dam, preventing ascending energies from being invested
in the PFC.
' [T]he ego controls the approaches to motility – that
is, to the discharge of excitations into the external
world...' [107].

Hyperactivity and electrical stimulation of Cg25
Certainly one of the most exciting findings in neuropsychiatry in recent years has been the identification of Cg25
as a key region in the pathophysiology of depression. Sev-

eral neuroimaging studies have correlated hyperactivity in
this region with depressed mood states and induced sadness in healthy volunteers and depressed patients
[46,56,95,107-114] (figure 4). Depression severity is cor-

This situation is reversed during remission of symptoms. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; ins = insular; PF, prefrontal cortex [51,95].

related with Cg25 hypermetabolism [115] and increased
functional connectivity [46]. Spontaneous and treatmentinduced remission of symptoms is associated with significantly
decreased
Cg25
metabolism
[51,100,105,110,113,116-119].
The subgenual cingulate has been the target of ablative
surgeries in the past [120] and, more recently, DBS [51],
where high frequency stimulation is used to inhibit activity in target nuclei. The preliminary results of chronic
bilateral high frequency stimulation of Cg25 in six
patients suffering from severe treatment-resistant depression were reported by Mayberg and colleagues [51]. Significant improvements (a 50% or greater reduction in
Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS-17) score) were
seen in five of the six patients at 2-month follow-up with
sustained improvements achieved in four patients at 6
months. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans of
patients at 3 and 6 months post stimulation revealed
decreased blood flow in Cg25 and increased blood flow in
the DLPFC. Significant improvements were seen in sleep,
energy, interest and psychomotor speed. Patients and
their families reported 'renewed interest and pleasure in
social and family activities, decreased apathy and anhedonia, as well as improved ability to plan, initiate, and complete tasks that were reported as impossible prior to
surgery'.
At the 2007 international Neuropsychoanalysis congress in
Vienna, some first-person accounts relating to acute stimulation were reported:
'It isn't like something has been added – no, something has been taken away'.
'It is as if I have just suddenly shifted from a state of all
consuming internal focus to realising that there are
number of things around to do'.
'When you're depressed the focus is inwards. So if
someone tells you, well you aren't the only one who
feels like that, you don't care. With the stimulator, I
don't feel that inward look; it has lifted so I am not so
focused on myself...'.
'It is as though I have been locked in a room with 10
screaming children; constant noise, no rest, no escape.
Whatever just happened, the children have just left the
building'
The 'something...taken away' described in these accounts
is consistent with the idea of a release from repression
(deactivation of Cg25) and a return to object cathexis
(DLPFC activation). The final account is especially interesting given that the patient was a father of 5.

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

Interestingly, sudden and dramatic deactivations of Cg25
and functionally related regions of the vmPFC and OFC
have recently been recorded after intravenous infusion of
the dissociative hallucinogen ketamine in healthy human
volunteers [121]. These deactivations correlated strongly
with dissociative phenomena. Significant activations were
seen in the parahippocampal gyrus, temporal cortex and
PCC. Importantly, the regions deactivated by ketamine
(OFC and vmPFC) are those postulated in this paper to be
involved in the process of repression, and the regions activated by ketamine (specifically the medial temporal structures), are those we hypothesise to be involved in the
primary psychical process of the unconscious mind. As
with the classic psychedelic drugs (e.g., LSD and psilocybin), the effects of ketamine have been described as disturbing the mechanisms of repression and facilitating the
release of primary process thought [122]. Single doses of
ketamine have been found to elicit a short-term antidepressant effect in depressed patients [123-126] and the
drug has also been used as an adjunct to psychotherapy
with reported efficacy in the treatment of alcoholism
[122].
The function of the vmPFC and OFC in relation to
repression
The data cited in the previous section supports the
hypothesis that Cg25 plays a key role in repression. However, it is likely that Cg25 does not act alone in this regard.
For example, activity in the ventral anterior PFC correlates
positively with depression severity and activity in this
region decreases after effective treatment [50]. The OFC
(BA11 and BA47) is activated when subjects try to
decrease arousal to erotic films [127] and there is impoverished activation of BA10 and 11 in paedophile sex
offenders viewing paedophilic material [128]. In healthy
controls viewing the same images, the lateral OFC (BA47)
was activated. The lateral OFC has also been found to be
activated during contemplation of moral transgressions
[129] and script-induced guilt [130].

Using autobiographical scripts designed to evoke strong
emotion, healthy control subjects showed increased
blood flow in the vmPFC during script-induced anger
compared to patients with anger attacks who showed an
impoverished vmPFC response [131]. Impoverished
vmPFC activation in anger patients suggests that recruitment of this region is necessary for suppression of aggressive affect. Significantly lower resting metabolism has
been recorded in the OFC of patients with a history of
reactive aggression [132,133] and patients with OFC and
mPFC lesions who show an increased risk of reactive
aggression [134-136]. Healthy participants who imagined
responding in an unrestrained aggressive manner to an
assault showed hypoactivity in the OFC but increased
activity in the same region when imagining restraint

[137]. In cases of post traumatic stress disorder, a condition characterised by unsuccessful repression of traumatic
memories, patients exposed to a script-driven reminder of
a personally traumatic experience showed impoverished
activity in the rostral anterior cingulate compared with
controls [138]. A related study showed a strong negative
correlation between emotional scores and vmPFC activation in PTSD patients exposed to script-driven reminders
of their traumatic experience [139] implying that impoverished vmPFC activation facilitates the return of the affect
attached to the original trauma.
As will be discussed in the next section, activation of the
amygdala is associated with the expression of primitive
emotions such as anger and fear as well as complex autobiographical recollections [140,141]. It is interesting
therefore that the study by Dougherty and colleagues cited
above discovered an inverse relationship between blood
flow in the vmPFC and amygdala in healthy control subjects during script-driven anger but a positive relationship
between amygdala and vmPFC activity in patients with
anger attacks [131]. These findings imply that patients
with anger attacks suffer from ineffective suppression of
amygdala activation [131]. A number of studies have
demonstrated that activation of the amygdala with concomitant emotional arousal is very quickly followed by
activation of the OFC [142-145] and – in healthy individuals – suppression of the amygdala response [146-148].
This suppressive function of the vmPFC/OFC is supported
by a large body of preclinical data [147-160]. It is likely
that this function is impaired in depression, with the suppressive/repressive action of the vmPFC/OFC being dominated by persistent flurries of limbic arousal [161].
Amygdala hyperactivity and electrical stimulation of
medial temporal lobes
Hyperactivity in the amygdala has been reported in a large
number
of
imaging
studies
of
depression
[47,87,97,111,162-169]. Increased activity in the amygdala has been recorded in studies of induced sadness in
healthy volunteers [169-171]. Amygdala activity has been
found to correlate positively with depression severity
[87,162,166], to show a sustained response to negative
emotional stimuli in depressed patients compared to
healthy controls [161] and to decrease in sensitivity to
emotional stimuli after successful antidepressant treatment [172,173].

The amygdala has long been recognised to play an important role in emotion. Bilateral resection of the amygdala
has been found to result in dramatic behavioural changes
(Klüver and Bucy syndrome) including emotional blunting, indifference to loved ones, hyperorality and hypersexuality [140]. Electrical stimulations of the human
amygdala and medial temporal regions have been found

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

to elicit a range of primitive emotional responses including: fear, anxiety, anger, aggression, sexual behaviours,
déjà vu and autobiographical recollections [141,174185]:
'I just get the electrical feeling, and it goes all the way
through me...it makes me do things I don't want to do
– I get mad' [10].
'I had a flash of familiar memory, but I don't know
what it was... I had a little memory – a scene in a play.
They were talking and I could see it... Just seeing it in
my memory...a very familiar memory of a girl talking
to me...that feeling of familiarity – a familiar memory'
[177].
A thorough phenomenological review of these experiences is necessary for an appreciation of the functional significance of the medial temporal lobes in relation to the
primary psychical process of the unconscious mind. Such
experiences have been interpreted by several clinicians
and researchers as examples of primary process activity
taking over from the secondary psychical process of normal waking consciousness [72,174,177,179,180,186193]:
'Reflected in the seizure-related behaviour may be
emotional trauma of early life, negative feelings
towards specific individuals because of past incidents
or situations' [192].
'Repression fails, the usual defence systems crumble,
disturbing unconscious material erupts, anxiety
mounts, and the personality structure becomes ineffective' [189].
'It is in my view wrong to call the feeling of having
experienced something before an illusion. It is rather
that at such moments something is touched on which
we have already experienced once before' [5].
A review of depth electroencephalography recordings
from the medial temporal regions suggests that stimulation-induced dreamlike experiences share a common phenomenology and neurophysiology (bursts of rhythmic
theta and slow-wave activity) with other dreamlike states
[71]. It is hoped that converging evidences correlating
neurophysiological activity with qualitatively analysed
phenomenological experiences will facilitate a wider
understanding of the phenomenology and psychophysiology of the unconscious mind.
Cg25 connectivity
Anatomical studies in primates have revealed dense connections between Cg25 and the hypothalamus [194,195]

Page 12 of 23

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

mPFC [196], parahippocampal cortex [197], amygdala,
ventral striatum, septal nuclei, dorsomedial caudate
nucleus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus; with
moderate connections to the periaqueductal grey and dorsal raphe nucleus [195,196]. Human tractography and
functional connectivity analyses support these findings,
showing prominent connections between Cg25 and the
NAc, amygdala, hypothalamus, OFC and vmPFC
[54,198,199]. The connections of Cg25 to a number of
important visceromotor centres offering profuse projections to the PFC has led to suggestions that Cg25 plays an
important modulatory role in cortical functioning [195].
A recent cytological analysis of the human cingulate cortex has revealed an especially dense concentration of
inhibitory receptors in Cg25 [200]. These findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that Cg25 exerts a controlling influence over visceromotor regions.
Connectivity between Cg25 and the amygdala has been
found to be especially strong during the viewing of fearful
and threatening faces [201]. The magnitude of disconnectivity between these structures predicted anxiety scores in
a number of individuals [201]. Resting state connectivity
between Cg25 and a range of structures including the
medial temporal lobes has been found to predict treatment response in depressed patients [58] and a strong correlation was discovered between subjective measures of
neuroticism and Cg25 and amygdala activation during
the viewing of emotionally provocative images [202].
In addition to medial temporal structures, other important visceromotor centres connected with Cg25 include
the NAc [198,203,204] and the VTA [196,205]. Cg25
shows an especially high level of functional connectivity
with the NAc at rest [23,54,204]. The NAc and VTA are key
nuclei in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems, being
central to the mechanisms of motivation and reward
[10,68]. The VTA has also been found to be strongly activated during ejaculation in male humans [64] cocaine
induced euphoria [65] and the heroin rush [66]. Electrical
stimulation of the NAc and the septum has been found to
elicit feelings of sexual pleasure and orgasm in humans
[69,206,207]. Patients given a self-stimulator connected
to the septal region stimulated themselves repeatedly for
hours and protested bitterly when attempts were made to
take the device from them [206]. These findings support
the association of the mesolimbic dopamine system with
the Freudian 'id' [1]. Chronic stimulation of the NAc has
recently been carried out in three TRD patients [208].
Early results suggest that this intervention may be particularly effective in relieving symptoms of anhedonia.
Volumetric reductions
'The neurosis may last a considerable time and cause
marked disturbances, but it may also run a latent

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

course and be overlooked. As a rule defence retains the
upper hand in it; in any case alterations of the ego,
comparable to scars, are left behind' [61].
Postmortem and MRI studies have found glial loss and
volume reductions in the PFC in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) [209-214] as well
as extensive losses in Cg25 and proximal paralimbic
regions [163,201,215-221]. Unilateral and bilateral volumetric reductions in the medial temporal regions – primarily in the hippocampus, have also been reported in
depressed patients [112,201,222-232], as have reductions
in the ventral striatum [233,234].
It is not difficult to surmise that the metabolic work of
repression has structural ramifications. This paper
hypothesises that the volumetric reductions found in
postmortem and neuroimaging studies of depression are
related to the effects of repression. It is significant that the
most severe reductions have been found in Cg25 (48%
reductions in 163) the area hypothesised to exert the primary repressive force. One possible mechanism for the
volumetric reductions is glucocorticiod-mediated neurotoxicity [235]. Dysregulation of the stress related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is consistently
associated with depression [236]. Dysregulation of the
HPA may be related to hyperactivity in the amygdala
[237]. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala increases
cortisol release in humans [238]. HPA hyperactivity
increases the likelihood of excitotoxic processes, downregulating glial, and increasing the concentrations of neurotoxic glucocorticiods and excitiotoxic glutamate [239].
The OFC and the vmPFC are dense in glucocorticiod
receptors and glutamate cells, with glutamatergic afferents
ascending from the amygdala and hippocampus [240].
It is hypothesised that the volumetric reductions discovered in depressed patients, as well as patients suffering
from other major psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia [194,208,210,212,215,216,219,241-248] may be
related to the effects of psychological conflict.

Discussion
The main inspiration behind the primary hypothesis of
this paper i.e., that Cg25 is centrally involved in repression, was Mayberg's paper on DBS for the treatment of
severe depression [51]. The findings of this study have a
special significance for Freudian metapsychology. It has
been inferred in this paper that the sudden lifting of negative affect upon stimulation of Cg25 is consistent with
the idea of a release of libido for object cathexis after it has
been pathologically 'dammed up' behind a central
repressing force. However, the therapeutic response to
stimulation raises some difficult questions for both psychoanalysis and psychiatry. One important question con-

Page 13 of 23

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

cerns the economy of psychical energy in relation to
depression and mania. Freud discussed the issue of mania
towards the end of 'Mourning and melancholia':
'The impression which several psycho-analytic investigators have already put into words is that the content
of mania is no different from that of melancholia, that
both disorders are wrestling with the same "complex",
but that probably in melancholia the ego has succumbed to the complex whereas in mania it has mastered it or pushed it aside. Our second pointer is
afforded by the observation that all states such as joy,
exultation or triumph, which give us the normal
model for mania, depend on the same economic conditions. What has happened here is that, as a result of
some influence, a large expenditure of psychical
energy, long maintained or habitually occurring, has
at last become unnecessary, so that it is available for
numerous applications and possibilities of discharge'
[74].
Neuroimaging studies of manic patients have shown that
in direct contrast to depression, resting state activity is
decreased in the OFC [249,250] and increased in dorsal
frontal areas during manic episodes [250,251]. It is significant that the early responses to Cg25 stimulation do not
appear to switch patients from pathological depression to
overt mania. According to Freud's model, manic episodes
depend on a quantity of dammed-up libido being suddenly made available for object cathexis.
'An important element in the theory of repression is
the view that repression is not an event that occurs
once but that it requires a permanent expenditure [of
energy]. If this expenditure were to cease, the repressed
impulse, which is being fed all the time from its
sources, would on the next occasion flow along the
channels from which it had been forced away, and the
repression would either fail in its purpose or would
have to be repeated an indefinite number of times.
Thus it is because drives are continuous in their nature
that the ego has to make its defensive action secure by
a permanent expenditure [of energy]' [252].
In the long term it is feasible that abeyance of repression
leads to a therapeutic shift in the energetic equilibrium of
the mind; but even if this is true, we still need to consider
why upon release from repression, we do not see a pathological release of primitive drive and repressed memory.
Are we to assume that electrical stimulation of Cg25
removes both the physiological and psychological causes
of depression? Even if depression is primarily an energetic
phenomenon and the physiological causes are the psychological causes (and vice versa), wouldn't there still remain

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

memory traces and exogenous stressors facilitating a recall
of lost objects, regretted behaviours and eluded ideals?
One possible reason why the effect of Cg25 stimulation
appears to have a sustained beneficial effect [253] rather
than an iatrogenic one [254] may be that inhibiting activity in Cg25 facilitates the disintegration of a wider network. For example, it is possible that activation of Cg25
supports activation of the DMN and deactivation of Cg25
supports deactivation of the DMN and activation of the
ON. This model would account for the diminished self
focus (ego cathexis) and rejuvenated task focus (object
cathexis) seen upon Cg25 stimulation. It may be possible
to test this formulation through neuroimaging studies of
patients undergoing Cg25 stimulation. If the ego is
dependent on repression, we would expect to see
decreased activity in the DMN, decreased activity in Cg25
and increased activity in the ON after stimulation. Preliminary evidence lends support to this model [51]. Evidence
supporting the interdependency of the ego and repression
would of course have important implications for the history of the evolution of human consciousness.
In order to test the validity of the Freudian model, it is
important that there be thorough psychophenomenological and neurophysiological analyses of Cg25 and NAc
stimulations. Ideally, subjective and objective measures
should be taken simultaneously, in real time. If, as this
paper predicts, Cg25 is centrally involved in repression,
then in addition to dramatic improvements in energy/
libido we would also expect to see some adverse responses
to stimulation, such as disinhibited behaviour, pathological drive, perseverance, hostility, aggression, sexual promiscuity and a reduced capacity to consider others. Such
behaviours are commonly associated with ventromedial
prefrontal lesions [255-259]. We would also predict that
patients undergoing Cg25 stimulation would be more
susceptible to temporal lobe phenomena (such as déjà
vu) as a result of diminished inhibitory control over excitatory medial temporal structures. If electrophysiological
recordings are carried out, we would hypothesise that
electrodes placed within the proximity of septal,
supramammillary or hippocampal theta structures would
display characteristic bursts of high voltage rhythmic theta
during moments of strong emotion ([69], see [71] for a
review). We would also predict that intracranial EEG
recordings in bipolar patients would reveal significant
changes in activity paralleling shifts in mood i.e., Cg25
hyperactivity/NAc hypoactivity during depression and
Cg25 hypoactivity/NAc hyperactivity during mania.
It is acknowledged that very little in the way of counter
evidence has been cited in this paper challenging the
validity of the Freudian model. It is likely that several
examples could be found in Freud's evolving work of

hypotheses that do not correspond well with the findings
of modern clinical research. However, it must be emphasised that what we have brought together in this paper are
principal concepts of Freudian metapsychology together
with principal findings of neuropsychiatry. It is all the
more significant therefore that the meeting has been complementary.
In order to develop a discussion of the comparative merits
of psychological paradigms, it is worth reminding ourselves of the two main aims of this paper: (1) to propose
a series of hypotheses correlating neurophysiological
processes with some fundamental processes of psychoanalysis, and (2) to highlight correspondences between
Freud's writings in 'Mourning and melancholia' and current findings in depression. How successful these tasks
have been will largely depend on two factors: (1) whether
evidences from other fields converge with the evidences
reviewed here, and (2) whether the psychoanalytic perspective is given credence. There is already ample evidence
to support the role of Cg25, the vmPFC and OFC in suppressing primitive affect, but the psychoanalytic significance of this function has yet to be fully appreciated.
It has been said before that it matters little which psychological discipline we choose to derive our operational
terms; the approach is secondary to the phenomena:
'Listen my friend, the golden tree of life is green, all
theory is grey' [260].
Psychological models do serve a purpose however, but to
provide comprehensive explanations of mental states and
behaviours, effective models must evolve naturally from
their phenomena. In a recent letter published in a reputable journal and co-signed by a number of leading
researchers [261] a proposal was put-forward as part of a
'decade of the mind' initiative to work towards a transdisciplinary explanation of mental phenomena. The main
psychological discipline championed by the authors was
cognitive psychology. While the essential idea is a commendable one, we must ask ourselves seriously whether
the information processing paradigm is really the best
model for carrying out this initiative. The psychological
limitations of the behavioural model have been recognised for several decades but the cognitive approach,
which views the human mind as an information processor
is currently the favoured model of clinicians and researchers. If the computer analogy is an accurate representation
of the human psyche, then we can feel comfortable going
into the final years of the 'decade of the mind' that real
progress will be made. If however, the model is at all
incomplete, we may need to consult alternative paradigms to assist our empiricism. The information processing model has traditionally been put to good use guiding

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

and informing empirical research. However, several
researchers are now recognising that the computational
model has limitations, especially when it is applied to
human emotion [62,68,262,263]. What we hope psychoanalysis can bring to the table therefore, is a psychological
model that has its roots set firmly in human experience.
We hope psychoanalysis can work alongside cognitive
psychology to provide a more comprehensive understanding of human experience.
' [T]he mind would often slip through the fingers of
psychology, if psychology refused to keep a hold on
the mind's unconscious states' [264].
'Psychoanalysis still represents the most coherent and
intellectually satisfying view of the mind that we have'
[263].
The primary requirement for a scientific psychoanalysis is
(and always has been) to confirm beyond reasonable
doubt that the unconscious mind exists and that it is not
only important but essential for an understanding of the
human mind and behaviour. If, as this paper maintains,
the unconscious does exist, then regardless of the words
chosen to define it, the establishment of its phenomenology as subject matter worthy of scientific investigation is
important. Deciding how best to test and confirm the
hypothesis that the unconscious mind exists will present
us simultaneously with a direction towards studying its
form and physiology. Due to the rigour of repression,
depression is not the easiest phenomenon to gain a perspective on the workings of the unconscious. The psychoses provide a better vantage:
'Things that in the neuroses have to be laboriously
fetched up from the depths are found in the psychoses
on the surface, visible to every eye' [265].
' [M]aterial which is ordinarily unconscious can transform itself into preconscious material and then
become conscious – a thing that happens to a large
extent in psychotic states. From this we infer that the
maintenance of certain internal resistances is a sine qua
non of normality' [59].
In depression we only assume the existence of the unconscious through a process of deduction based on ostensibly
irrational behaviours (e.g., self-harm, violent self-criticism
etc). As Freud made clear, there are much better ways of
studying the unconscious and the free-flowing psychical
energies that are its signature. Freud first stumbled across
a realisation of the unconscious through his work on dissociative states [72]:

Page 15 of 23

Annals of General Psychiatry 2008, 7:9

' [O]ne received the clearest impression – especially
from the behaviour of subjects after hypnosis – of the
existence of mental processes that one could only
describe as "unconscious". The "unconscious" has it is
true, long been under discussion among philosophers
as a theoretical concept; but now for the first time, in
the phenomena of hypnotism, it became something
actual, tangible and subject to experiment' [1].
'To most people educated in philosophy the idea of
anything psychical which is not also conscious is so
inconceivable that it seems to them absurd and refutable simply by logic. I believe this is only because they
have never studied the relevant phenomena of hypnosis and dreams, which – quite apart from pathological
manifestations – necessitate this view. Their psychology of consciousness is incapable of solving the problems of dreams and hypnosis' [1].
For Freud, dreams were a way of studying the unconscious
– unfettered by waking consciousness but the phenomenology of dreaming has largely failed to convince sceptics
of the existence of the unconscious. Freud acknowledged
that converging lines of enquiry would be required to consolidate the insights gained through the study of dreams:
'Thus, the psychological hypotheses to which we are
led by an analysis of the process of dreaming must be
left, as it were, in suspense, until they can be related to
the findings of other enquiries which seek to approach
the kernel of the same problem from another angle'
[5].
Future work may provide the necessary evidence. Alternative means of studying the unconscious – perhaps by way
of a pharmacological agent such as a psychedelic drug
[193,266] may open up fresh angles of enquiry. Freud
famously described the interpretation of dreams as 'the
royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of
the mind' [5]. However, dreaming occurs in sleep, making
real-time recitation of subjective phenomena impossible.
If we could stimulate the primary psychical process in
waking we would have a more effective method for studying the unconscious:
'Freud once said of dreams that they were the via regia
or royal way to study the unconscious; to an even
greater degree this seems to be true for the LSD experience' [265].
It is anticipated that progress towards a wider appreciation
of the psychoanalytic model will first require confirmation of the existence of the unconscious mind. We propose that the most effective way of achieving this is to
stimulate the primary psychical process in waking con-

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/7/1/9

sciousness. There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that
this can be reliably achieved through the use of a psychedelic drug such as LSD [193,266-285]:
'One must...put it simply, it does seem that all LSD
does is open the doors to the unconscious' [279].
Using neuroimaging techniques we would predict that the
ego dissolving, primary process releasing properties of a
psychedelic compound would correspond with a shift in
effective connectivity in the DMN, with the medial temporal regions (as opposed to the vmPFC) exerting principal causality [33,121,286,287]. Testing this hypothesis
will be difficult, but such challenging procedures are necessary if the primary psychical process is to be considered
a matter worthy of investigation. Once we are better able
to study the phenomenology of the unconscious, the
application of our new knowledge to the study and treatment of the whole of the mind will follow more easily.

Conclusion
The goal of this paper has been to investigate consistencies
between Freudian metapsychology and empirical findings
in neuropsychiatry. A summary of several key psychoanalytic concepts was given together with some early hypotheses about their physiological coordinates. This was done
to facilitate an understanding of Freudian terminology
and allow for the application of these ideas to areas of
clinical interest. Modern clinical research and older
empirical work such as intracranial stimulations was discussed in relation to Freudian metapsychology in order to
highlight correspondences between physiology, phenomenology and theory. If a new level of scientific verification
is achieved for subjective phenomena of relevance to psychoanalysis, this will have implications not just for the
way in which psychoanalysis is viewed by the wider philosophical, psychological and psychiatric communities,
but also for those interested in incorporating psychoanalytic ideas into their own clinical practice.
' [I]t should not be forgotten that in fact [the distinction between the unconscious and conscious dimensions of the mind] is not a theory at all but a first stocktaking of the facts of our observations, that it keeps as
close to them as possible' [59].
'Psycho-analysis an Empirical Science – Psychoanalysis is
not, like philosophies, a system starting out from a few
sharply defined basic concepts, seeking to grasp the
whole universe with the help of these and, once it is
completed, having no room for fresh discoveries or
better understanding. On the contrary, it keeps close
to the facts in its field of study, seeks to solve the
immediate problems of observation, gropes its way
forward by the help of experience, is always incom-

plete and always ready to correct or modify its theories. There is no incongruity (anymore than in the case
of physics or chemistry) if its most general concepts
lack clarity and if its postulates are provisional; it
leaves their more precise definition to the results of
future work' [288].
