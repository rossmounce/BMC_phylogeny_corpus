Abstract

During the past few years sequencing projects have provided
the whole genomes of several bacterial [1,2], archaeal [3,4]
and eukaryotic [5,6] organisms, including human [7,8]. This
genomic information is valuable as, in principle, it encodes
all the instructions necessary and sufficient for the life cycle

of each organism. Accurate annotation of genes to describe
the gene products by their molecular function, subcellular
localization and the biological process(es) they are involved
in is crucial for the exploitation of genomic data [9].
Sequence annotation by similarity to known genes for which
experimental data is available provides a rough initial

interactions

Conclusions: Combination of several microarray experiments is a powerful tool for the
identification of upstream regulatory motifs of yeast genes involved in protein synthesis.
Comparison of these yeast co-regulated genes against the archaeal and bacterial operons
indicates that the components of the protein translation process are conserved across organisms
at the expression level with minor specific adaptations.

refereed research

Results: We have investigated how well the protein subcellular localization and functional
categories established from clustering of orthologous genes agree with gene-expression data in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An increase in the resolution of biologically meaningful classes is
observed upon the combination of experiments under different conditions. The functional
categories deduced by sequence comparison approaches are, in general, preserved at the level of
expression and can sometimes interact into larger co-regulated networks, such as the protein
translation process. Differences and similarities in the expression between cytoplasmicmitochondrial and interspecies translation machineries complement evolutionary information
from sequence similarity.

deposited research

Background: Genome projects have provided a vast amount of sequence information. Sequence
comparison between species helps to establish functional catalogues within organisms and to
study how they are maintained and modified across phylogenetic groups during evolution.
Microarray studies allow us to determine groups of genes with similar temporal regulation and
perhaps also common regulatory upstream regions for binding of transcription factors. The
integration of sequence and expression data is expected to refine our current annotations and
provide some insight into the evolution of gene regulation across organisms.

criterion by which to classify the genes of an organism into
functional catalogs. These classifications have been shown to
be useful, for example, for computational prediction of
common upstream regions that might bind the same transcription factors [10].
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) is an example of
functional classification based only on standard sequencesimilarity methods. COGs is an elegant approach that has
used all-against-all sequence comparison of proteins in complete genomes to elucidate groups, namely COGs, that
contain a set of individual orthologous proteins or orthologous sets of paralogs from different phylogenetic lineages
[11-13]. Normally, orthologs are functionally equivalent proteins that arise from vertical evolution, whereas paralogs are
the result of duplication events and their function may have
diverted from the original ancestor. Each COG is represented by a protein with a characterized function or domain.
Individual COGs are assigned to general functional categories, which represent major cellular processes, and in
some cases, if known, to more specific pathways or systems.
The COG functional categories are identified by one-letter
codes (Table 1).
This functional classification of genes conserved across different organisms has provided new information about how
these catalogs of functions are maintained and modified
across phylogenetic groups during evolution. However, in
overpopulated COGs, the orthologous relationships between
their members are difficult to delineate precisely. Such COGs
might contain proteins that evolved new functions with
respect to the original ancestor, and even though these proteins still have significant sequence similarity, at the entire
sequence or the domain level, they may be part of different
cellular processes. This may be a particular problem in the
budding yeast COGs as it is the only eukaryotic organism to
be included in the database; therefore, those of its proteins
involved in biological processes characteristic of eukaryotes
may not have the counterparts in bacterial and archaeal
genomes required to enable a finer grouping.
To fully understand the dynamic molecular network in any
organism, however, the static information provided by
sequencing projects will have to be complemented by highthroughput biochemical data from deletion experiments,
DNA hybridization arrays, quantitative proteomics, localization experiments and two-hybrid interaction assays (for a
review see [14]).
DNA hybridization experiments are a popular tool for monitoring the differential expression of a large number of genes,
even complete genomes, under several conditions (reviewed
in [15]). Analysis of the data can uncover sets of genes with
similar expression profiles. This is achieved either by comparison against a set of genes whose expression behavior is
already known for the conditions studied, or by unsupervised

http://genomebiology.com/2002/4/1/R4

classification algorithms that cluster all the genes without
imposing any a priori constraints or knowledge [16]. Hints
about the function of uncharacterized genes can be deduced
from other members of the cluster. DNA microarrays of intergenic regions have also been used for the study of putative
binding sites for transcription regulators [17,18].
In the study presented here, we have investigated how well
the expression of protein-coding genes in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae agrees with the proteins’ subcellular localization
and functional classification as defined by the S. cerevisiae
COG database. Using the available biological information on
the yeast genes as the starting point, we have built groups of
genes and compared the expression behavior of the proteins
within and between these groups. The expression experiments included in our study comprise microarray data [16]
of time series analyzing the effects of cell-cycle progression
[19], sporulation [20], stress (temperature and reducing
shocks) [21] and diauxic shift [22]. The data have been analyzed as a whole and as individual experiments, and an
increase in resolution of the classification was observed
when several datasets were combined. Although the classes
defined by the COGs are, in general, preserved during gene
expression, it is possible to divide broad groups into subclasses that reflect the oligomerization state of the proteins,
subcellular location and/or more specific functionality,
which sometimes clarify the boundaries of the cellular
processes they are involved in. The results may be a complementary tool for the COGs, especially for those containing
many paralogs that cannot be distinguished by sequence
comparison alone but whose expression profiles are clearly
different. Finally, the set of genes involved in cytoplasmic
protein translation was analyzed in detail and compared to
bacterial and archaeal ‘ribosomal operons’ to investigate the
conservation of this key process at the level of gene sequence
and expression across phylogenetic groups.

Results
Overview of the experimental data
S. cerevisiae genes present in the COG database were
extracted from Eisen’s dataset [16]. After removal of genes
with low differential expression or too many missing time
points, pairwise comparisons of the expression profiles of
every possible gene pair were calculated for individual
experiments and for the combined dataset by the standard
Pearson correlation (see Materials and methods). The value
of this comparison, the correlation coefficient (CCF), ranges
from -1 to 1, indicating how different or similar, respectively,
the compared expression profiles are.
Combining several experiments is expected to improve the
separation of genes into more biologically meaningful
groups. Some genes not involved in the same pathway or
process might, in some experiments, appear to be regulated
at the same time just because the time points are not finely

scaled enough to separate them, or because they are occasionally required in otherwise independent pathways to
maintain a cellular state under certain conditions. If this
were true, some gene pairs would be expected to give both
positive and negative correlations depending on the experiment considered. In fact, 27% of all the possible gene pairs
in the dataset fell into this category. Furthermore, the CCFs
derived from a comparison of the whole expression profile of
these conflicting pairs can still be significant, that is, above
0.5 or below -0.5 (Figure 1). However, this only affects less
than 3% of all the pairs and it is probably due to an unbalanced CCF by experiments with extremely high intensity
peaks, as it might be the case with the sporulation data.

Correlation inconsistency in the expression of some gene pairs between different experiments. For each gene pair, CCF values obtained from combining
expression profiles of all experiments (CCFTOTAL, x-axis) are plotted versus those of individual experiments (CCFEXPERIMENT, y-axis). Only gene pairs with
a CCFTOTAL value above 0.5 or below -0.5 are shown. x- and y-axis values go from -1 to 1 in steps of 0.5 as depicted in (a). (b-d) Genes involved in the
cell cycle: (b) alpha-factor, (c) elutriation and (d) cdc-15 strain. (e) Sporulation. (f,g) Response to stress: (f) heat and (g) cold shocks. (h) Diauxic shift.
CCFEXPERIMENT values can spread over a considerable range regardless of their CCFTOTAL (for example, heat shock), even to the point of being significant
and with opposite sign to CCFTOTAL (for example, cold stress and diauxic shift). This inconsistency is less pronounced in the sporulation data, perhaps
because it contains very high intensity values that may bias the CCFTOTAL to be more similar to CCFspo. Note that only genes whose expression was
increased or decreased by 2.3-fold were considered. Those that did not pass the filtering were given a value equal to zero.

(Figure 2a). The expression of genes whose products will end
up in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane all show similar trends (Figure 2b-d). The expression
of gene pairs from the same compartment shows few negative correlations and many strong positive correlations,
especially at very high cutoffs. There is a similar trend for
nuclear proteins (Figure 2f); however, its slope is lower,
because some nuclear proteins are tightly co-expressed with
a considerable number of cytoplasmic proteins involved in
protein translation. The cytoplasm behaves as expected with
respect to positive correlations, but its proteins correlated
negatively more than expected (Figure 2e). This may reflect
the fact that, although subcellular compartments are usually
populated by proteins involved in specialized interconnected

processes [23], the cytoplasm holds a considerable number
of different processes that can be independent or mutually
exclusive of each other.
The trends of Figure 2 were not so obvious when analyzing
individual experiments (data not shown). In particular, two
datasets for cell division - the dataset synchronized by elutriation and the sporulation experiment - as well as the coldshock series, showed little discrimination between the
expression of proteins from different compartments. This
could be due to the reduced number of time points in the
experiments, limiting the resolution of the classes. It is also
possible that the quality of some experiments was somewhat
poor, in particular in the case of the cell-division experiment

categories of the S. cerevisiae genes in the microarray data.
The highest number of orthologs is found in metabolic

processes (CGEFHI), followed by the machinery for storage
and processing of information (JKL), especially those genes
involved in protein translation (J). Under-represented
groups are genes involved in ‘Cell division and chromosome
partitioning’ (D), ‘Cell envelope biogenesis’ (M), ‘Cell motility and secretion’ (N), and ‘Signal transduction mechanisms’
(T). This may reflect a bias in the number of genes for each

to the over-representation of bacterial and archaeal organisms compared to eukaryotes. Whereas core processes, such
as metabolism and information-handling mechanisms, are
conserved in all the phylogenetic lineages, other processes
will be representative of their evolutionary group. For
example, the proportion of proteins associated with intraand intercellular communication will be higher in eukaryotes, especially in higher organisms [24].

bottom (class ALL) gives the poorest consistency and corresponds to all gene pairs without an initial functional pregrouping. The middle set contains four classes, the ones
incorporating the general function, that is, F--, FP-, F-L and
FPL. This set presents higher consistency, but further subgrouping would raise it. The third set, containing -P- and
-PL, is at the top, indicating that the original groups defined
by this notation are consistent and maintained even at very
high thresholds. The group with the highest consistency is
that combining pathway and mitochondrial location information. This suggests that processes are best characterized
when their compartments are also taken into account (which
is true, at least in this case, mainly because it allows the separation of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes).
Neither of these classes contains more than 3% of their gene
pairs when using an equivalent negative correlation range,
from -0.5 to -0.8 (not shown).

Table 1 also shows the distribution of the genes with respect
to known pathways and functional systems defined in the
COGs. Most of them are not assigned to any system/pathway.
The populated group corresponding to the protein translation system is split into four finer subclasses.

Overall expression behavior of predefined functional
classes
Assuming that three characteristics (COG general function
(F), COG pathway/system (P), and subcellular location (L))
can be assigned to every gene, the following combinations
were considered to compare the expression behavior of the
genes with respect to their annotation: F--, -P-, FP-, F-L, -PL
and FPL. For example, class F-- will contain all the gene
pairs in which both members have the same general function
regardless of their pathway/system and subcellular location.
Therefore, the FPL class will hold pairs in which both genes
have the same general function, pathway/system (if any) and
location. The localization included only two possibilities,
mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial genes. Only mitochondrial genes were considered, because this was a large group
with a clear positive correlation (Figure 2b). A diagram with
detailed examples of some classifications can be found in the
additional data files.
Any a priori classification scheme should consider the
quality of the resulting classes and the number (and characteristics) of the elements not included. The elements of highquality classes should show consistent relations between
them as a whole; in this case all the genes should have
similar expression profiles. Usually, consistent classes will
tend to have few elements and thus consideration of which
genes are not included may be important because strict classifications may leave out significantly correlating gene pairs.
In our study, the overall trend of the gene pairs for each classification was studied in two different ways. These two ways
are depicted in Figure 3a.
The first reflects the ‘consistency’ of a class. This measure
describes the proportion of all the possible gene pairs in each
class that correlate significantly at a given CCF value (see
Materials and methods). The consistency of a class in which
the expression of all the genes is induced or repressed at the
same time will be higher than other classes where only subgroups of genes are significantly co-regulated. Figure 3b
shows the results for a range of CCF values, from 0.5 to 0.8.
The classes can be grouped into three sets. The one at the

The second measure, ‘comprehensiveness’, tackles the question of how many of the significantly correlated gene pairs
are included by these classification schemes. A broad classification will miss less correlating pairs (that is, it is more
comprehensive) than other classification in which the
groups are very specific (probably very consistent) but in
which relationships between some groups may have been
left out. The ‘comprehensiveness’ is assessed by calculating
the proportion of correlated gene pairs for each classification
with respect to the total number of correlated gene pairs in
the whole dataset at a given threshold (Materials and
methods). For positive thresholds two sets can be observed
(Figure 3c). The set with higher number of pairs contains F-and F-L, and the second one all the P groups (-P-, FP-, -PL
and FPL). The results indicate that for broad classification
schemes, F-- and F-L, the higher the threshold, the more
similar the expression behavior of the genes with respect to
their annotation. On the other hand, when considering
groups with ‘better defined boundaries’ (that is, -P-, -PL, FPand FPL), the relationships between subclasses are expected
to be more important. An example is the protein translation
category J. Although many genes in this category can be
assigned to a more specific system, for example, initiation
and termination factors or ribosomal subunits, they all will
work together during protein synthesis. Therefore, by considering very specific groups we will miss the relationships
between them.
The next sections tackle the comparison of the expression
profiles of gene pairs for each functional group, how their
members can sometimes split into more functionally consistent subgroups and which of the resulting subgroups may act
together in the same cellular processes.

Subgrouping of genes with the same FPL
The data were divided into sets of genes with the same F, P
and L as defined above. Then, the expression profiles of the
genes in each group were compared against each other. Genes

were split into subgroups according to the similarity of their
expression profiles as described in Materials and methods.

the cell cycle. First, a subgroup of genes involved mainly in
replication control is expressed, followed by a subgroup containing genes with DNA-repair functions, and finally the
histone subgroup. This agrees well with some of the major
processes taking place during cellular division: arrest of the
cell cycle until everything is ready for division, DNA repair to
ensure the fidelity in the transmission of the information to
the daughter cells during DNA replication, and then chromosome condensation before mitosis. The periodicity is not
observed in the sporulation data, probably because the
experiment was not designed to take fine enough points to
resolve these groups. In fact, the subgroups split at low
thresholds (0.5) when analyzing individual experiments of
the cell cycle separately. It is only when combining all the
experiments that a higher cutoff (0.7) is needed because of
the overlap of peaks in the sporulation series.

Figure 4a shows an example of three subgroups obtained
from genes preassigned to the class ‘L - -’; their COG general
function is ‘DNA replication, recombination and repair’ (L),
they have not been assigned to any pathway nor are they
localized in the mitochondrion. The averaged profiles of the
subgroups suggest that they are periodically regulated during

Agreement of functional annotation and expression data of genes.
(a) Two groups of genes obtained after an a priori classification by, for
example, functional annotation. The red lines connecting the elements
within each group represent significant similarity between their
expression profiles. The number of red lines with respect to all possible
ones gives and indication of the consistency of the group. Thus, group a is
very consistent, as all the possible connections but one, a3-a4, are made.
On the other hand, the consistency of group b is poorer, as its elements
form two subgroups (b1-b2 and b3-b4). The blue lines connecting the
elements between each group are relations lost upon the a priori
classification used. The higher the number of lost connections the less
comprehensive the classification will be. In this case, the subgroup b1-b2
significantly correlates with group a. (b) Consistency of the functional
groups established by gene annotation. A decreasing trend implies loss of
interactions between members. F--, -P-, FP-, F-L, -PL and FPL indicate
functional classes as defined in the text. For example, class F-- contains all
gene pairs in which both members have the same general function
regardless of their pathway/system (P) or location (L), class FP- contains
all gene pairs with the same general function and the same
pathway/system but not necessarily the same location, and so on.
(c) Comprehensiveness of significant gene-expression pairs in the
functional groups established by gene annotation. The increasing trend
suggests that genes correlating at high CCF values tend to belong to the
same functional class. This is especially obvious when a broad functional
classification is used in which nearly all the possible pairs in the
experiment are represented at high thresholds. The percentage of the
gene pairs in each group with respect to the total number of pairs was:
ALL (100%), F-- (8.8%), -P- (1.2%), FP- (4%), F-L (6.7%), -PL (1%) and FPL
(3.1%). The group --- was not included in the -P- and -PL classes.

Another example is the subgrouping within the set ‘O - -’

and chaperones’). Figure 4b shows three subgroups with distinguishable expression. The heat-shock protein subgroup is
repressed in the cdc-15 and sporulation experiments, but
induced under stress and during diauxic shift. On the other
hand, the proteasome is only differentially expressed in the
sporulation experiments. Finally, the third subgroup contains three proteins: PDR13, SSB2 and FPR4. PDR13 and
SSB2 are both Hsp70 homologs. PDR13 interacts with Zuo1p

different conditions. The experiments are color-coded (upper bar) as
follows: yellow (cell cycle), orange (sporulation), red (stress) and purple
(diauxic shift). (a) Subgroups obtained from the ‘L - -’ class (‘DNA
replication, recombination and repair’). (b) Subgroups obtained from the
‘O - -’ class (‘post-translational modification, protein turnover and
chaperones’). (c) Subgroups obtained from the ‘GEPR - -’ class, which
contains permeases of the major facilitator superfamily. GEPR comprises
several functional groups reflecting that their actual function is not clear
(R) although they may be involved in the transport of sugars (G), aminoacids (E) and inorganic ions (P). The vertical axis represents the
differential expression of genes as the log ratio of the mRNA abundance
in experimental versus control samples. At zero values, the mRNA levels
are identical. The list of genes included in every subgroup can be found in
the additional data files.

overpopulation of genes in a COG can be due to the presence
of: duplicated genes which may or may not be involved in
the same cellular process; functionally equivalent orthologs
that are the result of an ancient horizontal gene transfer (for
example, mitochondrial ribosomal genes); and promiscuous
domains that are found in proteins that are not necessarily
functionally related. An example of the latter is COG0515,
which holds a number of proteins containing Ser/Thr
protein kinase domains. The expression of these genes was
diverse and the CCF values for all the different pairs varied
between -0.8 and 0.8.
COG0477 is an example of a COG populated with paralogs.
This group is a collection of various homologous permeases
of the major facilitator superfamily [27]. Figure 4c shows
some of the groups obtained by analysis of the expression of
the genes in this COG. The proteins naturally form subgroups according to their differential expression. Group 1
contains SEO1, HXT10 and HXT14. SEO1 is a putative permease similar to the allantoate permease family, also called
anion:cation symporter. HXT10 and HXT14 belong to the
sugar transporter family, although none of them seems to
transport glucose [28]. Group 2 contains four of the six
major hexose transporters in yeast: HXT3, HXT4, HXT6 and
HXT7 [29]. Finally, group 3 contains the genes HXT9,
HXT11 and HXT12. None of them is a glucose transporter. In
fact, HXT12 is not functional for hexose transport when
overexpressed in a mutant lacking all HXT genes [30],
whereas HXT9 and HXT11 may be involved in pleiotropic
uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs, since a hxt9-hxt11
double-null mutant shows increased resistance to a number
of drugs [31].
This could be taken as an example of the potential for finer
subgrouping within COGs by comparing functional-expression information of proteins with similar primary structure.

Cross-talk between functional subgroups
The next step was to compare the calculated subgroups to
find out how they could be related to each other. For that,
the expression profiles of the genes in each selected subgroup were averaged. The averaged profiles of these subgroups, representing all the functional classes, were then
correlated and clustered according to their similarity (see
Materials and methods).

associated with translating ribosomes and it may bind
directly the nascent polypeptide chains [26]. FPR4 is a predicted peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. The expression of
this subgroup will be shown later to be associated to the
cytoplasmic translation machinery and therefore it may have
a role in folding of newly synthesized proteins.

At 0.71 threshold, a large number of the subgroups did not
have a correlating partner, and only three sets were found to
contain more than one subgroup. These sets represented
two highly conserved processes in living organisms: protein
translation (both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic), and
DNA replication.

Subgrouping of paralogs in populated COGs

Figure 5 shows the DNA replication set. The four averaged
profiles of the functional subgroups, including the ‘L - -’ subgroup of DNA-repair genes, are all very similar (Figure 5a)

At this point it is worth considering some examples of
how similar the differential expression of paralogs is. The

and the resulting total average (Figure 5b) clearly retains the
periodic features observed already in Figure 4a. In addition
to the subgroup involved in DNA repair (genes: MSH2,
MSH6, RAD51, OGG1), this class also contains subgroups
involved in thymidylate biosynthesis ‘F F5 -’ (genes: DUT1,
RNR1, RNR3, CDC21), basal replication machinery ‘L L1 -’
(genes: RFA1, POL2, POL30), and cell division and chromosome partitioning ‘D - -’ (genes: SMC3, RHC18).

spliceosome, which was expected as mRNA splicing is
mostly devoted to ribosomal proteins in yeast [32]. In addition, a number of other processes may also be necessary for
a successful translation. These back-up processes may feed
the raw materials necessary for the synthesis of ribosomal/messenger RNA (sugar and nucleotide metabolism) as
well as polypeptide chains (amino-acid metabolism).
However, the tight association of the translation machinery
with sugar metabolism may also reflect the close relation
between the amount of nutrients in the environment and
cellular growth [32].

Cytoplasmic protein translation set

Genes with either only rap1 (33%) or only rrpe (16%) motifs
were frequent, as were genes with a combination of rrpe and
pac (around 12%) and rap1 and rrpe (around 13%). The other
combinations (pac, rap1/pac and rap1/rrpe/pac) were very

interactions

(b)

Rrpe is an experimentally uncharacterized motif that has
been suggested by computational studies to be specific for
rRNA-processing genes [10]. The PAC box (pac motif),
which stands for polymerase A and C box, has been found to
be conserved in at least 10 genes encoding subunits of RNA
polymerases A and C [34], although neither a function nor a
trans-acting factor for this motif has been identified. We
have identified a number of new genes containing rrpe and
pac motifs in their upstream regions.

refereed research

(a)

It is well known that repressor-activator P protein 1 (Rap1)
targets upstream motifs of a number of ribosomal protein
genes (RPG) as well as being central to the cellular economy
during rapid growth [33]. Previous experimental studies
have uncovered a number of genes regulated by Rap1
including RPGs and genes involved in protein synthesis and
sugar metabolism [18]. Approximately half the genes in our
set were identified in that study as targets of Rap1. However,
the rap1 motif was not found in 25% of these genes, perhaps
because they have a degenerate sequence, weaker for computational detection. On the other hand, additional putative
rap1 motifs were found in some of the genes that had not
been identified previously as Rap1 targets, including genes
involved in amino-acid synthesis (SPE4), and genes for a
translation elongation factor (EFB1) and a ribosomal
protein (RPS27B).

deposited research

The key player in the translation process, the ribosome, is
accompanied by its cofactors, RNA polymerases and RNAhandling proteins. These include proteins related to the

The fact that these functional subgroups come together
when very different experiments are analyzed supports the
hypothesis that their transcription may indeed be co-regulated. Therefore, the upstream regions of the genes encoding
these proteins might share common motifs that may serve as
binding sites for the same transcription factors. A computational analysis of the upstream regions of this gene subset
was carried out to investigate the presence of common local
sequences (Materials and methods). Three significant motifs
were found: rap1, rrpe and pac. The results are summarized
in Table 2 and the sequence consensus for each motif shown
in Figure 6.

reports

A quick survey of the COG functional categories of the proteins in the set provides a good overview of the processes
related to protein synthesis (Table 2). These are: E (general
amino-acid metabolism, including leucine synthesis, E7), F
(general nucleotide metabolism, including purine and
pyrimidine biosynthesis, F1 and F3 respectively, and purine
salvage, F2), G (general carbohydrate metabolism, including
glycolysis, G1, gluconeogenesis, G2, and pentose phosphate
pathway, G3), H (general coenzyme metabolism, including
menaquinone biosynthesis, H7), J (general translation,
including translation factors, J1, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, J2, and ribosomal proteins for the small subunit,
J3, and large subunit, J4), K (general transcription, including DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, K1) and L (general
DNA handling, although it mainly contains helicases and
RNA-processing proteins).

reviews

The mitochondrial translation set only included subgroups
with general function J (protein translation), that is, translation factors (J1), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (J2), and the
ribosomal proteins (J3 and J4). In contrast, the cytoplasmic
translation set included several other functional subgroups
in addition to the J ones.

To determine the specificity of these motifs for our set of
proteins, the motifs were compared to all upstream regions
of coding sequences in S. cerevisiae. The distributions of
scores for all genes and those in our ‘cytoplasmic translation’
set are plotted in Figures 6a-c. As expected, the sequences
used to build the motifs matched with higher scores. A more
informative plot is shown in Figure 6d, in which the ratios of
sequences in our set with respect to all S. cerevisiae genes
matching a motif at a given score are depicted. rap1 gives the
best ratio, which means that our set contains a good representation of all genes regulated by Rap1, even though it only

contains 100 of the approximately 300 genes known to bind
Rap1 [18]. The low values for the other two motifs might represent the absence of other functionally related genes containing these motifs in our dataset or the occurrence of these
motifs in genes involved in other processes. Although the
latter possibility cannot be discarded, previous genes identified to contain rrpe and pac motifs also presented functions
related to protein translation [10], which suggests a role for
these motifs as regulators of this process.

biosynthetic proteins and the chaperones FPR4 and SSB2.
FPR4 is a putative peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, and SSB2
belongs to the Hsp70 family. An SSB2 homolog, SSB1, was
shown to be regulated by Rap1 and transcribed at the same
time as ribosomal proteins [35]. This suggested an active
role of SSB1 in folding of newly synthesized polypeptide
chains, as also shown for other SSB proteins [26]. This may
also be the case for the chaperones found in the present
work. SSB2, an Hsp70 protein, may prevent aggregation of
nascent polypeptides, whereas FPR4 may speed up folding
by facilitating proline isomerization.

eukaryotes, it is quite common for a protein to serve either
as an activator or as a repressor, depending on the generegulatory proteins present in the cell [36]. In fact, some
cases of Rap1 bound to the promoters of inactive genes have
been reported, which suggests that other cofactors may
determine the transcriptional activity of genes downstream
of Rap1 binding [18]. The same mechanism may take place
in regulation via pac and rrpe.

All these genes were repressed under the conditions studied
(Figure 7c). It remains to be seen whether the motifs found
might control both the repression and activation of genes. In

The proteins of the COG functional class J, protein translation, are mainly localized in cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondrion. We observed a clear distinction in the expression
of the J genes with respect to their subcellular localization.

duplicated genes can be distinguished from each other because even though two genes can encode two proteins with identical amino-acid sequences, the
degree of identity at the DNA level can be low enough to make a selective DNA hybridization onto the chip feasible. This seems to be the case for the
genes analyzed in (d).

The correlations of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial
(nuclear and cytoplasmic) gene pairs stopped at 0.7
(Figure 7a). On the other hand, the J genes found in the
nucleus and the cytoplasm still correlate at very high thresholds, which implies that their expressions may be coupled

the assembly of ribosomal subunits and in the processing
and transport of RNAs should, in principle, only be required
for cytoplasmic translation.

Comparison of the expression of the translation
machinery of Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae
Protein translation is a universal mechanism present in all
organisms. In fact, most of the proteins conserved in all
organisms are involved either in translation (J) or transcription (K). We wanted to know if the expression of the sets of
genes associated with the ribosome is co-regulated across
different species in a similar way to our budding yeast cytoplasmic translation set. A comparison against bacterial and
archaeal organisms could be carried out by taking advantage
of the operon organization of their genomes. An operon is
made up of genes that are transcribed as part of a single
mRNA molecule. Co-transcribed genes are co-regulated at
the transcriptional level and often have related roles, for
example involving protein-protein interactions or as part of
the same metabolic pathway [41].

The functional categories found in these operons closely
resemble those in the yeast cluster deduced from geneexpression experiments, with the exception of the genes
involved in protein secretion (N), which do not have yeast
homologs. Interestingly, two chaperones were also found in
the protein translation operons of E. coli. Both were peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPI). B0028 is an FKBPtype PPI homologous to the yeast PPI identified above
(FPR4). B0053 also has a yeast homolog although it was not
present in the microarray dataset. It is well known that in
bacteria, in addition to some Hsp70-like chaperones, the
trigger factor is associated with the ribosome [42]. The bacterial trigger factor, which lacks a eukaryotic homolog, has
PPI and chaperone activity and is thus probably involved in

The analysis of the J COGs with more than one protein provides some interesting insight into the behavior of paralogs
and orthologs. Plotting the CCF values of paralog-paralog
pairs (mostly redundant cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins)
and ortholog-ortholog pairs (cytoplasmic and mitochondrial
ribosomal partners) shows that there is a spatial and temporal separation of their gene products (Figure 7d). Also, the
range of CCF values for cytoplasmic paralogs is somewhat
broad, indicating that duplicated genes, even in the case of
duplicated ribosomal genes, are not necessarily expressed
identically. The reason for keeping duplicated ‘redundant’
genes is unknown, although it may be related to a selection
mechanism for increased level of expression, as many of the
over-duplicated gene functional categories include highly

Both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation machineries
still require the same ingredients for transcription (sugar
and nucleotides) and translation (amino acids). However,
this metabolic network seems to be coupled only to the cytoplasmic machinery. During the evolution of the endosymbiotic mitochondria, most of the metabolic genes have been
passed onto the host nucleus and their function developed in
its host cytoplasm [38,39]. The mitochondrion takes in all
metabolites and factors by transporters added de novo to its
membrane to ensure the delivery of all the necessary
primary raw material. However, none of the few mitochondrial transporter genes present in the microarray data was
associated with the mitochondrial translation set.

The first comparison was against E. coli, as its operons have
been best characterized experimentally. All the operons containing ribosomal protein genes as well as others containing
genes for proteins that may be involved in translation were
selected (see Materials and methods). Table 3 shows all the
genes in these operons along with their corresponding COG
and whether or not there is a yeast homolog in the microarray dataset. The ‘ribosomal operons’ contain genes involved
in: J (general translation, including translation factors, J1,
and ribosomal proteins for the small subunit, J3, and large
subunit, J4), K1 (DNA-dependent RNA polymerases), F3
(pyrimidine biosynthesis), EHR (amino-acid transport and
metabolism), L (general DNA handling, including basal
replication machinery, L1) and a gene with unknown function (R) that may possibly be a nucleic-acid-binding protein.
The other operons include genes with other functional categories such as: J2 (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases), N (protein
secretion), H (general coenzyme metabolism, including
menaquinone biosynthesis, H7, and pyridoxal phosphate
biosynthesis, H9), K2 (basal transcription factors), O (chaperones) and G3 (pentose phosphate pathway).

reviews

Functional class J also contains a number of COGs with
more than one protein. Some of them are real orthologs and
others are paralogs, which are very common in S. cerevisiae
as half its genome is duplicated [37]. These paralogs can, in
some cases, conserve the function of their ancestors and
even replace each other. For example, most ribosomal subunits are encoded by two genes that yield nearly identical
proteins. On the other hand, the ‘repeated’ orthologs do not
complement each other. This is the case for the translational
machineries - cytoplasmic and mitochondrial. Even though
they have different origins (the mitochondrial one originated
by gene transfer from its endosymbiotic bacterial ancestor to
the nucleus), they have retained the same function. We
observed a poor correlation between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal genes, although in some experiments,
for example, sporulation, they might seem to be correlated
(Figure 7c).

SOS ribosomal protein L9

The Yeast column indicates whether or not there is a yeast homolog of the bacterial gene (Yeast). The notation is as follows: No (genes lacking a yeast
homolog), Yes (genes with a yeast homolog that was not present in the microarray data), Yes* (genes with a yeast homolog that, although present in the
microarray data, were not part of the ‘cytoplasmic translation’ cluster) and Yes** (genes with a yeast homolog that are found in the cluster)

co-translational protein folding. The fact that PPIs are
probably co-expressed with ribosomal proteins in two different organisms suggests that there may be a general
mechanism to facilitate protein folding by accelerating cistrans proline conversions during protein translation. The
next step was to extend this comparison to other bacterial
and archaeal organisms.

Conservation of the expression of the translation
machinery across species
Comparison of complete microbial genomes has revealed a
large number of conserved gene clusters, that is, sets of adjacent genes that have the same order and orientation in two
or more different genomes. A recent study has detected and
analyzed these conserved gene pairs to estimate their probability of belonging to the same co-transcribed unit or operon
[43]. From this study, we have built a ‘translation-machinery’ set of probably co-regulated genes for each species by
merging all the gene pairs in which one of the members was
a ribosomal subunit (see Materials and methods).
Bacteria and archaea were compared separately to the yeast
set (Table 4, and see also Additional data files). Most of the
genes in these groups have a yeast partner in the COGs (82%
for bacteria, and 90% for archaea). However, when ubiquitous genes were not considered, only 55% of the bacterial
genes had a yeast homolog, in contrast to 80% for archaea.
This suggests that the processes associated with protein
translation are more similar between archaea and yeast than

between bacteria and yeast. For example, all organisms share
a set of key functional classes (J1, J3, J4, F3, K1, K2, N), but
some bacteria also have genes involved in DNA replication
(L1) as part of the protein translation operon (Table 4). These
DNA replication COGs are COG0305 (replicative DNA helicase), COG0164 (ribonuclease HII) and COG0629 (singlestranded DNA-binding protein). It remains to be seen if this
is a special adaptation for some organisms to somehow
couple the process of protein translation and cell division, or
if the same proteins just facilitate transcription.
Interestingly, some of the proteins in the archaeal and bacterial groups have been assigned to uncharacterized COGs
for which functional information is unavailable. For
archaea, these are: COG1325, COG1422, COG1460,
COG1500, COG1909, COG2042, COG2106 and COG2118.
All the proteins associated to these COGs were exclusively
found in archaea, with a few exceptions in which yeast partners were also found. Two of these groups, COG1325 and
COG1500, belonged to the functional category S, function
unknown, in the earlier version used originally in the analysis. In the recently updated version, however, both are
assigned to category J, protein translation, as predicted
exosome subunits. Another one, COG2118, has been
assigned to class R, general function prediction only, in
which one of its members, MTH1615, is a DNA-binding
protein. For the rest of the COGs, PSI-BLAST searches were
done using as references the genes forming the COG to
determine whether homologs from other species absent

The list of functions is divided into blocks according to the presence or
absence of a yeast homolog in the microarray data with the same coding
as in Figure 3. The last three columns represent the percentage of genes
in each functional category with respect to all the genes in the ‘operon’
(Total), those genes found only in more than (High frequency) or less
than 50% (Low frequency) of all the species studied. Functions found with
high frequency in different organisms are highlighted in bold. It can be
seen that the COG functional categories of the yeast, bacterial and
archaeal genes are very similar, suggesting also that proteins with the
same function, but not necessarily evolutionarily related, could replace
each other in different organisms. More comprehensive tables of the data
summarized in Tables 1-4 are provided as additional data files.

from the COGs might have been shown to have a role in
protein translation or related processes.
No hints on function were found for COG1422 and
COG1909. On the other hand, the other three did find characterized partners in other archaea not included in the
COGs. COG2106 matched to O24783, a putative ribosomal
protein located in a gene cluster coding for ribosomal proteins in Halobacterium marismortui [44]. The other two
had similarity to proteins in Sulfolobus solfataricus.
COG2042 proteins were similar to Q9UWV6, a RNase P
involved in tRNA and 4.5S RNA-processing. COG1460 was
similar to Q9UXD9 (DNA-directed RNA polymerase,
subunit F). Interestingly, the list of hits for COG1460 also
contained a DNA-directed RNA polymerase (RPB4_SCHPO)
from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe with a
poor E-score. However, the matching region had the same
size as the reference proteins and corresponded to a RPOL4c
domain, which is a DNA-directed RNA-polymerase subunit.
When this yeast protein was incorporated in the profile, the
subsequent iterations also picked a large number of other
RNA-polymerases from higher organisms. All of them
matched to the profile through their RPOL4c domain.
In the bacterial clusters, four COGs of functional category S
were found, that is, COG0759, COG0779, COG1284 and
COG1610. All were bacterial COGs only, with the exception
of COG1610, which also included yeast. No additional information could be obtained for COG0779 and COG1284. The
proteins of COG0759 were very short and matched to Pfam
domain DUF37, whose function is unknown although it is
found in a protein from Aeromonas hydrophila that has
been shown to have hemolytic activity. In fact, some other
members of the hit list were also putative hemolytic proteins. The relevance of this toxin-like protein in the ribosomal cluster is unknown and it may just reflect some
particular adaptation of the pathogenic organisms in which
it is present (Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis MC58 and Helicobacter pylori J99). Proteins of
COG1610 contain the Pfam domain DUF186, which may
have a role in tRNA metabolism, specifically as a glutamyltRNA aminotransferase.
In general, these uncharacterized proteins seem to have predicted functions in agreement with an active role in protein
translation: RNA processing (COG2042), ribosomal subunit
(COG2106), RNA polymerase (COG1460) and aminoacyltRNA transferase (COG1610). The remaining uncharacterized COGs might also play a part in protein translation.

Discussion
Clustering of genes pregrouped into COG functional
categories
The approach presented here has proved useful for a preliminary quick survey of microarray data. General trends can be

obtained by analysis of genes with similar functionality
without any a priori information about their regulation. For
example, the category ‘L - -’ (‘DNA replication, recombination and repair’) splits into processes that correspond to
some of the characteristic stages of cell division. In this case,
it provides an idea about the different cellular states found
along a time series. This kind of information could be
obtained from any experiment by analyzing one or more relevant functional classes of expected importance under the
studied conditions. It may also help to refine sequence annotation by delimiting the temporal distribution of genes
within cellular processes with respect to their partners in a
given functional class. Two examples have been provided.
The ‘L - -’ group, comprising DNA-handling proteins, has
been shown to split into several subgroups that act during
cell division (replication control, DNA repair and histones)
as well as those helicases involved in transcription during
protein synthesis. In these cases, a broad functional group
can be described in terms of its more specific subgroups. The
second example dealt with the behavior of the expression of
genes belonging to the same COG and therefore sharing a
high sequence similarity, which precludes finer classification
by sequence-similarity approaches. However, the expression
of these genes is clearly different and allows finer grouping
into subgroups that seem to be more consistent with other
biochemical data, as shown for the group of permeases of the
major facilitator superfamily.
We have shown that the averaged profiles of genes with the
same functional class and a similar expression profile
produce meaningful clusters. This may be used for a quick
assessment of the quality of the data by investigating the
behavior of genes that should always appear together, such
as protein complexes [45]. Also, systematic grouping of
genes into averages would reduce the number of elements to
be handled during the analysis, providing a simple and
straightforward way to recognize the processes held in a
cluster. Gene averaging also increases the signal-to-noise
ratio. Therefore, comparison of averaged genes may work
better in those cases for which no duplicated chips are available (which is the case for the data used here). However, this
approach will be more powerful with a larger set of genes
since then the functional classes could be more or less uniformly represented. Even though genes with unknown function are not initially considered, they could be correlated
later to the profiles of the functional classes to get hints
about their function.

Cross-talk between functional groups
Clustering of averaged profiles revealed connections
between functional classes involved in two highly conserved
processes shared by all organisms: protein translation and
DNA replication. These two processes are very different in
nature. DNA replication occurs once in a cell’s life and the
proteins involved are tightly regulated in a series of synchronized steps. On the other hand, protein translation is a

information

The use of the COG information for the analysis of geneexpression data has provided a scaffold for the comparison
of expression data between different organisms, revealing a
probable link in the expression of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases
and ribosomal proteins in two organisms from different phylogenetic kingdoms. It is already known that the cellular
information processing systems, at least transcription and

The expression profiles of genes have been organized into
classes defined by their functional annotation and the resulting groups compared with each other to reveal possible
interconnections. This approach has proved useful for a preliminary quick survey of microarray data and, in principle,
could be used with any type of functional classification. The
analysis of yeast genes has revealed a different regulation of
the expression of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins
involved in translation. It has also identified three main
putative regulatory motifs in the upstream regions of the
genes in the cytoplasmic set. This set contains not only the
ribosomal and RNA-processing proteins but also chaperones
and enzymes involved in the synthesis of sugars, nucleotides
and amino acids. Homologous genes in bacterial and
archaeal organisms showed a potentially similar co-regulation in their expression, including the co-expression of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases and ribosomal proteins. This
indicates that the components of the protein translation
process are conserved across organisms at the expression
level, perhaps with minor specific adaptations.

Conclusions

refereed research

Combining microarray experiments is a powerful tool for
identification of co-regulated genes that may share
upstream regulatory regions. The analysis of the upstream
regions of the genes involved in protein translation has
revealed three possible key regulatory motifs: pac, rrpe and
rap1. Rap1 targets have been well characterized elsewhere
[18]. We have identified several new genes containing pac
and rrpe motifs. All these genes agree with the functional
classes known to contain these motifs, and strengthen their
relevance in the regulation of protein translation and transcription. We have also observed some preferential combination between these motifs within genes. Combination of
several motifs may be important for regulation [46]. For
example, promoters of ribosomal protein genes typically
contain a Rap1-binding site adjacent to a T-rich element
that also participates in activation by an as-yet unknown
mechanism [47]. Also, promoters of genes that encode glycolytic proteins usually contain a Rap1-binding site adjacent
to or flanked by multiple binding sites for the GCR1 protein
[48]. In the same way, combinations of rap1, rrpe and pac
motifs may have a role in protein synthesis regulation. In
fact, the tight co-regulated expression of genes containing
both pac and rrpe motifs in their upstream regions has
recently been reported [49].

translation, are more similar, both at the sequence and presence level, between archaea and eukaryotes when compared
to bacteria [50,51]. Furthermore, even though some of the
archaeal ribosomal protein genes are organized into ‘bacteria-like’ operons, the corresponding amino-acid sequences
are more similar to those of their eukaryotic, not bacterial,
counterparts. Our study suggests that the expression of these
genes may also be more similar between archaea and yeast
than yeast and bacteria. Interestingly, the protein translation operons of some bacterial organisms also seem to
encode proteins involved in other processes, such as cell
division and production of toxins. This may be just an adaptation of particular organisms to their niche. Perhaps the
indication that the expression of yeast ribosomal genes is
associated with sugar metabolism may also represent a yeast
adaptation for linking growth rate to carbon source availability, where the organism grows quickly by fermentation in
a glucose-rich medium but switches to respiration when the
glucose level decreases, accompanied by a drop in the
expression of glycolytic enzymes and ribosomal proteins.
This tight link between sugar metabolism and ribosomal
expression is not observed in the archaeal and bacterial
operons analyzed here. However, it cannot be discarded,
because operons that do not contain ribosomal proteins may
still be co-regulated with ‘ribosomal’ operons through the
same transcription factors.

housekeeping process and its components are constitutively
expressed. Both processes require nucleotides and thus they
are associated with genes involved in nucleotide synthesis.
Interestingly, these sets are different. Protein translation
requires a continuously high production of both purines and
pyrimidines for RNA synthesis, whereas the DNA replication
set is only associated with thymidylate biosynthesis, which is
the nucleotide absent from RNA and characteristic of DNA.
The absence of cross-talk between the majority of functional
groups could represent the limited number of genes used in
our analysis or the adaptability of the cells to the surrounding environment. The latter suggests that only very few
processes are tightly associated between them, in this case
only protein translation, DNA replication and, to a lesser
extent, the TCA cycle (see Materials and methods). The other
processes are required together or separately under different
conditions, and this may reflect the flexibility of organisms
in making a successful response to a range of unpredictable
variations in the medium where they live.

This set corresponds to less than half of the S. cerevisiae genes
found in the COGs (996 out of 2,175 total genes), but they
comprise 559 of the 904 budding yeast COGs. Table 1 shows
the distribution of the COG general functional and pathway/
system categories of the genes in the microarray data.

0.5 to 0.8 for correlations, and between -0.5 and -0.8 for
anti-correlations.

Preprocessing of experimental data
A standard filter was applied to prevent the inclusion of
genes in which the variation in expression was small
(< 2.3-fold) or for which the expression profiles have too
many time points missing, and therefore they may yield
misleading correlations against other gene profiles. When
all the experiments were considered as a whole, all genes
but one were differentially expressed, in contrast to the
result observed when analyzing individual experiments.
The percentage of genes that were differentially expressed
in each individual experiment included less than half the
genes, except in the sporulation dataset, in which 71% of
the genes were regulated. Furthermore, the cell-division
experiments, which in principle should involve a very
similar set of genes, showed a broad range of values for the
different synchronization methods: 9% ␣-factor, 19% elutriation and 35% cdc-15 strain. The combination of these
three resulted in a total of 49%, indicating that some of the
genes did not overlap between experiments. This could be
due to different synchronization procedures introducing
different artifacts [19].
The standard Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated
for each gene pair using the profiles of individual experiments (zero was assigned if any of the genes did not pass the
cutoff filtering), and all experiments as a whole.

Protein subcellular localization versus gene
expression
A list of budding yeast proteins with known localization was
retrieved from MIPS [54-55]. Only compartments with more
than 50 such proteins were considered: plasma membrane (63),
endoplasmic reticulum (63), mitochondrion (136), nucleus
(185), cytoplasm (303) and unknown localization (239).
The frequency of gene pairs encoding proteins with the same
subcellular localization and a correlation coefficient (when
comparing the whole profiles) above/below a given threshold was calculated as:

Furthermore, to estimate the behavior of a random distribution in which there is no relation between expression and
localization, the following approach was undertaken. The
labels associating genes to compartments were randomly
shuffled and the frequencies for the new gene-compartment
pairs calculated. This process was repeated 45 times, averaging all the resulting frequencies at the end. The average
approximated to a flat line crossing the y-axis at a value proportional to the number of in each class.

‘Consistency’ and ‘comprehensiveness’ of predefined
functional classes
Functional classes were predefined, as described in the
text, by taking into account general function, specific
pathway/system (if any) and mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial localization. Two comparisons were carried out to
investigate the overall behavior of the classes.
The first one reflects the ‘consistency’ for a given classification and is the proportion of gene pairs with a CCF higher
than a given threshold with respect to the total number of
possible pairs for that class. This is calculated as follows:
100
ConsistencyCCF = ——— *
p

nCCFi
i

i=1

where i is the individual group for the classification, p is the
total number of groups resulting from the classification,
nCCFi is the number of gene pairs for group i at a given CCF,
and ci is the total number of unique gene pairs for group i,
which corresponds to
2

Ni - N i
ci = ——————
2
where Ni is the total number of genes for group i.
The second comparison gives an idea of the ‘comprehensiveness’. The ‘comprehensiveness’ of a given classification is the
proportion of correlated gene pairs present in that classification with respect to the total number of correlated gene pairs
in the whole dataset at a given threshold, and is calculated
as follows:

GeneSameloc
%LOC = 100 * ———————————————————
GeneSameloc + GeneDiffloc
where GeneSameloc is the number of distinct genes
involved in gene pairs whose products are found in the
same compartment, loc; and GeneDiffloc is the number of
distinct genes whose products have a different localization
to loc but whose expression significantly correlate with at
least one of the proteins in loc. The thresholds ranged from

In general, the resulting subgroups reflected functional (that
is, involved in the same, more specific, cellular process)
and/or structural (that is, part of the same multi-protein
complex) relationships. However, there was no common cutoff
value for all the groups, and whereas some genes separated at
relatively low CCF (around 0.5), other groups split into finer
groups only at high values (> 0.7). At the highest threshold
(0.8), usually, only multi-protein complexes remained.

comment

The averaged profiles of selected functional subgroups were
compared to investigate how the subgroups obtained relate
to each other. The selection of subgroups was the initial
issue. As mentioned above, separation into biologically
meaningful subgroups was sometimes obtained at different
thresholds for different initial classes, and although in principle a more objective approach would be to consider a
unique cutoff to select the subgroups, this would have
resulted in poorly resolved subgroups at low CCF thresholds, and in a small number of subgroups (that is, poor representation of functions) at high thresholds. Moreover, at
continuously increasing thresholds, the number of
members in the subgroups decreased. The criterion to select
the subgroups was to get a broad representation of functional classes without excluding too many genes but without
compromising the quality of the averages by including
poorly correlated genes. For that, the subgroups were
selected manually (taking advantage of our knowledge of
biological processes) and selection may therefore be somewhat subjective. It resulted in a mixture of subgroups
obtained at different thresholds. The quality of the chosen
subgroups was assessed by correlating the resulting averages against all the individual genes. A subgroup was
regarded to be adequate if: the CCF average of all the genes

Each ORF in the dataset that belonged to the COGs was given
an additional string, ‘Fn Pn Ln’, where F and P are the COG
general functional category and pathway/system, if any,
respectively; and L is its subcellular location: that is, mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial (Figure 8, step 1). The CCFs,
considering the expression profiles as a whole, of gene pairs
with the same ‘Fn Pn Ln’ string were extracted into a matrix
(Figure 8, step 2). Then, gene pairs with a CCF lower than a
given threshold and whose correlations were inconsistent
between individual experiments: that is, both positive and
negative values were found in different experiments, were
discarded (Figure 8, step 3). Finally, the remaining gene pairs
(Figure 8, step 4) were grouped into unique subgroups with
non-intersecting elements between them (Figure 8, step 5).

contributing to the averaged profile was higher than 0.7; the
CCF of the individual genes was not lower than 0.5
(Figure 9); and the CCF presented a reasonable consistency
(data not shown). The list of the chosen subgroups is available as additional data.

Cross-talk between functional subgroups
The averaged profiles were correlated and grouped in a
similar way to that described in Figure 8. The only difference
was that the global CCF was calculated as follows:

Initially, a clustering was carried out with a threshold of
0.7. This resulted in a large number of averaged profiles
without correlating partners, as well as four sets with more
than one of the selected functional subgroups. These sets
represented DNA replication, protein translation (both
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial) and energy production
(TCA cycle). However, not all the averages in the DNA replication group presented the expected periodicity in the cellcycle region, and this is why the threshold was increased
until only averages with a consistent periodicity were
grouped together (reached at a cutoff value of 0.71). This
periodic behavior of cell-cycle-regulated genes was thus
used as a benchmark.

Finding common upstream motifs
where CCFexp is the correlation coefficient of experiment exp
in a set of related experiments (that is, cell cycle comprising
␣-factor, cdc-15 and elutriation; sporulation; shock experiments comprising heat, temperature and reducing stress; and
diauxic shift), Nexp is the number of time points for a given
experiment, and Ntotal is the total number of time points.
The standard correlation is a description of the shape of two
profiles without taking into account the intensity. It works
well when a single peak is expected in the series. However,
when combining several experiments, a number of peaks
will be present, and if the intensities in one experiment are
much higher than in others, this could introduce a bias in
the comparison, resulting in a correlation coefficient that
reflects best the similarity for that region of high intensity to
the detriment of significant similarities or differences in
other regions of lower intensity. The time series of the sporulation data presented extremely high peaks when compared
to the data obtained for the other conditions. This is why a
weighted correlation was used here.

AlignACE [10], a program for identifying motifs over-represented in DNA sequences, was used to search for
common upstream regions in the complete cluster of genes
involved in cytoplasmic protein translation (198 upstream
regions) and, subsequently, in two subsets representing
the genes that have been already identified to contain a
rap1 binding motif (97) and those that may not have it
(101). Default values for S. cerevisiae were used, including
correction for GC content. AlignACE uses a stochastic
algorithm. In general, it will find the strongest motifs in
each run, usually with slight differences, although even
that is not guaranteed, in particular for the weaker motifs
(Jason Hughes, personal communication). Several runs of
alignACE yielded slightly different results for our data.
Therefore, 20 runs were carried out for each dataset and
the results were combined as follows: only motifs found in
at least 80% of the runs with a MAP score higher than 10
were considered. The resulting motifs matched to rap1,
rrpe and pac motifs with correlation scores higher than 0.8
when compared to known motifs [56] by the compareACE
program. The scanACE program was used to find matches
for the above motifs in the upstream regions of all
yeast genes.

PSI-BLAST is a position-specific identification algorithm
that improves the resolution of BLAST for finding distantly
related homologs by means of sequence-similarity comparisons weighted by a matrix in which both the mutation frequency of amino acids and the positions of conserved
residues are taken into account [62]. PSI-BLAST searches on
a non-redundant protein database were conducted using the
online facilities provided by the NCBI [63]. For each COG,
every protein of the analyzed organisms was used as reference. Thresholds for inclusion of proteins into the profiles
was set to 0.005 (default) for archaea, and 0.00001 for bacteria. The stringent cutoff chosen for bacteria ensured that
only proteins with a very high similarity to the reference
were included. The first BLAST search provided hits to
known SMART or Pfam motifs, if any. The iterations were
continued until no new sequences were found.

reviews

A previous study has provided a list of pairs of neighboring
genes from different organisms with a high probability of
being part of the same operon [43,61]. These pairs of genes
were merged into groups of pairs with common members.
Then, a ‘protein-synthesis operon’ was obtained by merging
all groups containing at least one ribosomal protein, as it
was assumed that the stoichiometry of the ribosome has to
be maintained and thus the expression of its subunits should
be co-regulated. Finally, every gene in each operon was converted to its corresponding COG to allow comparison
between organisms through their equivalent orthologs, as
described previously.
