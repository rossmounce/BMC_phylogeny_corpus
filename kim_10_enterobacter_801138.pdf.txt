Abstract
Background: The clinical significance of the Enterobacter nimipressuralis as human pathogens remains unclear.
Case presentations: The microbiologic culture monitoring system of sterile body fluids revealed on an episode of
Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter amnigenus in blood culture results on the same day; the antibiotic sensitivity
and MIC were nearly the same for both species. First patient was a healthy woman with postmenopausal
syndrome, while second patient with herpes zoster. Both patients had febrile sensations without signs of
bacteremia. E. amnigenus was also cultured from the unused package of salined cotton in the container through
epidemiologic investigation. The cultured Enterobacter species were all identified as E. nimipressuralis through hsp60
gene sequencing and infrequent-restriction-site PCR (IRS-PCR).
Conclusion: When an unusual microorganisms such as E. nimipressuralis is isolated from blood of a patient with no
clinical signs of sepsis, a pseudobacteremia should be suspected. When the antibiogram and MIC test results of
bacterial cultures from two or more patients are nearly the same, although the species involved may appear
different, it may be necessary to prove that they are the same species through molecular methods. The
microbiologic cultures monitoring system will probably help to detect pseudobacteremia and other pseudo
infections through reliable and fast identification.

Background
Chosun University Hospital, Gwang-ju, Korea, is a 650bed, tertiary care teaching hospital. Every day in our
hospital, an infectious disease specialist monitors all the
results of the hospital’s microbiologic cultures from sterile body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
pleural fluid, ascites, joint fluid and localized fluid collection using a computerized monitoring system. This
monitoring system revealed an episode of Enterobacter
nimipressuralis pseudobacteremia caused by contaminated saline cotton during the preparation of blood
culture samples. Here we describe two cases of Enterobacter species pseudobacteremia.

Case presentation
Case 1

A 54-year-old female patient presented with myalgia and
febrile sensation to outpatient Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in Chosun University Hospital. She
had a history of liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus,
and had gone surgery because of a pituitary adenoma 1
year ago. The patient did not have any limitations of
daily living without major health issues after the surgery.
Her physical examination revealed newly formed painful
grouped vesicles on the trunk. Blood culture resulted in
the growth of Enterobacter amnigenus. The vital signs
and laboratory data did not correlate with the finding of
the bacteremia. Antiviral agent for the herpes zoster was
used with improvement in pain and crust formation of
the vesicles. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin
according to the culture results. The follow up blood
culture revealed no sign of any growth of bacteria. The
patient was discharged on the 10th hospital day without
any complications.

Case 2

A 41-year-old female presented with febrile sensation,
hot flush, and general weakness for two months to outpatient Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The
patient had no significant medical history prior to the
visit to the hospital. Physical examination was normal,
and there was no clinical signs of infection. However,
blood culture resulted in the growth of Enterobacter
cloacae. Ciprofloxacin was started according to the culture results. There was no sign of fever or systemic bacteremia, and the patient was discharged on the 5 th
hospital day with an impression of postmenopausal
syndrome.

Discussion
When the above two patients visited outpatient clinic,
the doctors who were in charge just ordered blood culture afraid of systemic infection, because they had complained of febrile sensation in spite of ambiguous
clinical signs or symptoms. The microbiologic cultures
monitoring system revealed that Enterobacter species
were isolated from the blood cultures of two patients,
which was performed in the outpatient blood sampling
room. One species was classified as E. cloacae and the
other E. amnigenus, yet the sensitivity and MIC test
results were almost same. A common source of contamination or “pseudobacteremia” was suspected because
the both patients had positive cultures and no clinical
signs of sepsis. An epidemiologic investigation was
initiated to determine the origin and cause of the Enterobacter species bacteremia. We reviewed clinical records
of the two patients, and examined the medical procedures that they had undergone. One patient was a
healthy woman, while the other was a woman with liver
cirrhosis. The laboratory findings were within the normal range. No common exposures that might be related
to the positive blood cultures other than venipuncture
in the outpatient blood sampling room were noted.
When reviewing the procedure for drawing blood and
the disinfectant used, suspicion fell on the salined cotton
because new supplies of salined cotton had not been
delivered for the past five days. We took environmental
specimens, including samples from the antiseptic solution and the salined cotton, for examination, and bacteria classified as E. amnigenus were cultured from the
unused packages of salined cotton in the container that
had been used in the blood sampling room for wiping
the skin with disinfectant prior to venipuncture for
blood culture.
The clinical isolates classified as E. cloacae and E.
amnigenus were initially identified with a VITEK II
automated system (bioMe´rieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France).
Antimicrobial susceptibility determinations including
the MICs were performed automatically with the VITEK

II system. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was
used next as a confirmatory tool. The isolates from both
patients and the salined cotton container gave similar
antibiogram and MIC results (Table 1). Enterobacter
clinical isolates could not be identified in species level
by 16S rRNA sequence due to the differences of
sequence similarities among four species showing more
than 99.0% identity with corresponding type strains. Previously, Tang YW et. al. also reported that the analysis
of 16S rRNA gene is even though widely used for the
bacterial identification, but it is poorly discriminatory
for closely related members especially for the members
of Enterobacter genus [1]. Hence, we performed
sequence analysis of the protein encoding hsp60 gene
and draw phylogenetic tree [2] (Figure 1). The hsp60
gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of amplification products revealed that clinical isolate shared
maximum of 96.7% sequence similarity with E. nimipressuralis ATCC 9912 T (GenBank accession number
AJ567900). Hence, we assigned the clinical isolate as E.
nimipressuralis species because it showed highest %
similarity with this species, and clustered together in the
same branch of the phylogenetic tree with E. nimipressuralis (Figure 1). Furthermore, we also performed infrequent-restriction-site PCR (IRS-PCR) [3] fingerprinting
to confirm that the same bacterial strain had been isolated from the two patients and the salined cotton pad.
Figure 2 shows that the three isolates yielded identical
DNA banding patterns. Therefore all isolates were identified as E. nimipressuralis by hsp60 gene sequencing
and IRS-PCR.
Enterobacter species causes opportunistic infections,
and could be primary human pathogens [4]. In the present study, although the clinical significance of the
E. nimipressuralis remains unclear, the use of contaminated salined cotton at the venipuncture sites where
blood was drawn seems the most likely explanation for
the pseudobacteremia. Sterile salined cotton has been
used instead of boric acid in the blood sampling room
and Opthalmology Department since 2001. Boric acid
cotton has not been used in our hospital since 2001
because of its weak antiseptic properties and significant
toxicity [5]. Instead, sterile salined cotton is used before
swabbing iodine to sample blood for culture. Sterile salined cotton should be supplied daily from the central
supply department of our hospital: however, at the time
of the outbreak, the salined cotton container had not
been supplied adequately to the blood sample room.
When E. amnigenus or E. nimipressuralis is isolated
from the patient who has no clinical signs of sepsis, a
pseudobacteremia should be suspected, especially in
cases where sensitivity testing and MIC results of bacterial cultures from two or more patients are nearly
same, even though they appear to be different species.

The microbiological culture monitoring system of sterile
fluids by an infectious disease specialist may help to
detect early other cases of pseudobacteremia. No further
cases of E. amnigenus or E. nimipressuralis bacteremia
have been occurred since we recommended using alcohol cotton for disinfection for sampling for blood culture and prohibited to use salined cotton for that
purpose.

Conclusion
Unusual microorganisms, such as E. amnigenus or E.
nimipressuralis, isolated from blood of a patient with no
clinical signs of sepsis should raise suspicion of pseudobacteremia. The microbiological culture monitoring system might be helpful to detect pseudobacteremia at
early. The phoenotypic identification method Vitek II as
well as the DNA sequence based typing methods with
16sRNA are not discriminatory enough to identify E.
cloacae complex isolates, while sequencing a fragment
of the hsp60 gene is more reliable for proper identification of Enterobacter species.
