Applicability of anatid and galliform microsatellite
markers to the genetic diversity studies of
domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus) through
the genotyping of the endangered zatorska breed
Krzysztof Andres*, Ewa Kapkowska

Abstract
Background: The lack of a sufficient number of molecular markers seriously limits the cognition of genetic
relationships within and between populations of many species. Likewise, the genetic diversity of domestic goose
(Anser anser domesticus), with a great number of breeds throughout the world, remains poorly understood at the
molecular level.
Findings: Thirty-five goose, seventeen duck and eight chicken microsatellite primer pairs were screened for their
utility in the cross-species amplification on DNA from 96 individuals of Zatorska breed of domestic geese. Twentyseven of 42 amplifying primer pairs revealed length-polymorphic products, but three of them were difficult to
score. Fifteen primer pairs amplifying the same length product across all individuals. One polymorphic
microsatellite locus was assigned by genotyping of known sex individuals to the Z-chromosome.
Conclusions: We present a set of 24 polymorphic microsatellite markers useful for population genetic studies of
the domestic goose. Another 15 markers were classified as monomorphic, but they might also be suitable for the
assessment of genetic diversity in geese.

Background
It is currently widely accepted that characterization of
genetic diversity of a population at the molecular level
provide a great support for decision making in the field
of conservation, maintenance and monitoring of genetic
resources [1-3]. The main tool in the characterization of
the genetic diversity of farm animals is DNA polymorphism analysis of microsatellite loci [4]. This type of
analysis was proposed by a joint International Society
for Animal Genetics (ISAG) and Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) working
group and used in about 90 percent of all molecular studies of genetic diversity of farm animals [5]. Nonetheless, some of the important domestic species, including
domestic geese, are still sparsely genotyped by this
method. There are 181 recognized breeds of domestic

geese in the world with 158 local populations distributed
mainly in Europe and Asia [6]. In 2006, two thirds of
distinguished breeds (121) faced the risk of being lost or
their risk status was disturbingly unknown. The genetic
relationship between a great majority of breeds and the
level of genetic diversity of given populations of domestic geese have not yet been revealed. The domestic
goose is one of the fourteen major species of domestic
animals included in the Global Project for the Maintenance (or Measurement) of Domestic Animal Genetic
Diversity [7] but the recommended microsatellite marker list for diversity studies has not yet been proposed
for this species. Currently there are known to be only
ten species-specific microsatellite markers isolated and
evaluated in the graylag (Anser anser L.) [8], an ancestor
of Western breeds of domestic geese. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of panel of 19 [9] or 7 [10] microsatellite
markers isolated from swan goose (Anser cygnoides L.)
was assessed in a biodiversity study of Chinese breeds of
domestic geese of swan goose origin and all these

markers proved to be useful. It is important to mention
that among other species of the genus Anser, there is
only one single report of two microsatellite markers isolated and tested for amplification in white-fronted geese
(Anser albifrons L.) [11].
The avian genome appear to be largely conserved and
is characterized by a high degree of conserved synteny
[12,13]. Thus it has been proved possible to cross-amplify
many microsatellite loci in related species, although the
probability of cross-species amplifications decreases with
increasing genetic distance [14-16]. In the Anatidae
family, the utilization of primer templates for closely
related species were frequently verified as an effective
way of obtaining microsatellite loci for various taxa
[8,11,17-19], because of the homology of the sequences
in the genomes [20]. The application of Canada geese
(Branta canadensis L.) and chicken microsatellite markers (Gallus gallus domesticus) were investigated in the
studies of genetic diversity of Chinese domestic goose
breeds descended from the swan goose [9,10,21]. Nevertheless, the use of goose and duck microsatellite markers
in graylag and domestic geese originated from graylag
has been tested sparsely to date [8,22].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability
of using selected anatid and galliform microsatellite markers in genetic diversity studies on domestic geese based
on Zatorska breed characteristics. The breed was developed between 1956 and 1961 by planned crossing of four
Polish local varieties [23]. Three of them (Podkarpacka,
Pomorska and Suwalska) share a common ancestor, a
graylag goose (Anser anser). The fourth variety (Garbonosa) is known to be derived from swan goose (Anser
cygnoides). The breeders purpose was to create a new
breeding stock with better meat and egg production performance and still well adapted to local environmental
conditions. Currently a single flock of about 450 animals
is maintained as a conservation flock at the Experimental
Farm of the Department of Poultry and Fur Animal
Breeding and Animal Hygiene of the Agriculture University of Krakow. The breed has been listed in the World
Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity as endangered-maintained due to small population size [23].

Methods
DNA sampling and genotyping

In accordance with the breeding program approved for
Zatorska geese, every third year we create a breeding
stock consisting of 20 mating pens, one male and six
females in each (20 males and 120 females in total). The
experiment covered 96 individuals from the breeding
stock that leave progeny (20 males and 76 females).
Individual venous blood samples were taken from the
ulnar vein and collected in EDTA spray-coated tubes
and stored at -20°C. The amount of blood taken was

Page 2 of 10

approximately 2 ml per bird and the final concentration
of EDTA in preserved blood was 1.8 mg/ml.
Genomic DNA was extracted from 15 μl of preserved
blood. Four hundred microliters of lysis buffer (100 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Trizma base, 10 mM EDTA, 2% SDS) was
added to the aliquot. The solution was made up to 150
μg/ml with Proteinase K. After overnight incubation at
56°C, the protein was removed by phenol and chlorophorm-isoamyl alcohol extractions and DNA was precipitated by ethanol [24].
Sixty pairs of primers designated for the genotyping of
microsatellite loci of five Anatidae species (swan goose
Anser cygnoides L., white-fronted goose Anser albifrons
Scopoli, Canada goose Branta canadensis L., domestic
duck, derived from mallard Anas platyrhynchos L., harlequin duck Histrionicus histrionicus L.) and domestic
fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) have been tested on the
material of Zatorska geese DNA. The investigated loci
were chosen in accordance with previously consulted
studies, where the applicability was observed in various
goose and duck species. We chose: twenty-one pairs of
primers of the CKW set isolated from swan goose
[9,10,21], eight markers from the Bca μ set isolated in
Canada geese and polymorphic in white-fronted geese
[18], eleven domestic duck APH markers of proven usefulness in graylag [22], five TTUCG markers isolated in
Canada geese [25], four CAUD-G markers isolated in
domestic duck and briefly checked for amplification in
domestic geese of European (A. anser) and Asiatic (A.
cygnoides) origin [17], Hhi μ1 and Hhi μ3 markers of
harlequin duck [18] and Aal μ1 marker isolated in white
fronted geese [11]. Finally, 8 chicken primers pairs
(ADL166, ADL210, MCW004, MCW014, MCW085,
MCW104, MCW120, MCW264) were chosen according
to the reports of their usefulness in the genotyping of
Chinese domestic geese [9,10]. Detailed information
about each waterfowl and chicken marker are listed in
Table 1 and Additional file 1. The sequences of the original clones were checked for duplication using
BLASTN v.2.2.4 [26] following Dawson et al. [16] and
all the sequences were confirmed to be unique. Additionally, we found out that the sequences of three of the
tested microsatellite loci, named CKW12, CKW20 and
CKW43 cover the same nucleotide sequence as clones
CKW22, CKW24 and CKW410 deposited in the
PubMed database, respectively. The optimum annealing
temperature for the markers were defined empirically
using 12-degree annealing temperature gradient function
(between 50 and 65°C) in Mastercycler ep Gradient
thermal cycler (Eppendorf), in the preliminary experiment conducted on DNA probes of twenty individuals.
PCR reactions contained approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 3.0 mM
MgCl2, dNTP mix (0.2 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP

and dTTP), 0.25 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 400 nM of each primer were carried out
in a total volume of 10 μl. The reactions were run on a
Mastercycler ep thermal cycler (Eppendorf). PCR cycling
conditions were 2 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by
30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 45 s annealing at
optimal temperature for given primer (Table 1 and
Additional file 1), and 1 min elongation at 72°C. Final
elongation took 8 min at 72°C.
PCR products were electrophoresed on 6% denaturing
polyacrylamide gels (32 cm × 30 cm × 0.4 mm) by using
a Bio-Rad Sequi-Gen GT Nucleic Acid Electrophoresis
system (Hercules, CA) run at constant 80 W and 50°C
for 3 to 5 hours. The time of electrophoresis was
adjusted to optimize the separation with each PCR product length. Gels were silver stained according to methods outlined by Qu et al. [27]. Alleles were
distinguished by their mobilities relative to 10 bp DNA
Ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Statistical analysis

Mean number of alleles, allelic richness (RS), observed
heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (HE) assessment of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE), estimated null allele frequency and polymorphism
information content (PIC) for each microsatellite locus
were determined using Cervus 3.0 computer program
[28]. Tests for departures from HWE were performed
using a Markov-chain method using the GENEPOP v4.0
[29]. Pairwise tests for linkage disequilibrium based on
7,560 permutations using Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05)
were performed using FSTAT version 2.9.3 [30]. Sequence
similarity between the anatid microsatellites and the
chicken genome was determined using the BLASTN program from NCBI, following Dawson et al. [16]. Only
matches that scored an Expectation value (E) equal or less
than 1 × 10-05 were regarded as being significant. The two
parents exclusion probability (PE; probability of excluding
two putative parents when genotypes of the offspring and
both of its parents are known) based on observed allele
frequency distributions assuming HWE [31] were calculated in Cervus 3.0 [28]. Combined probability of exclusion [32] over all polymorphic loci was also determined.
The probability of identity (PI), as an individual identification estimator, was computed for each locus in Cervus 3.0
[28]. One-way ANOVA and the Tukey’s test were applied
to examine the possible differences between the mean PIC
values of species-specific marker sets using SAS software,
version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Statement of Ethical Approval

All procedures performed on the animals were approved
by the First Local Ethic Commission for Animal Experiments in Krakow, Poland (Ref. No. 49/2006).

Results
Altogether, 60 microsatellite primer pairs were tested for
amplification and polymorphism on 96 individuals from
the Zatorska breed of geese. The amplifications of 42
primer pairs resulted in clear and visible products of the
expected size based on the sequenced clone. Among
them, 27 loci were polymorphic and 15 were monomorphic (Table 1, Additional file 1). The latter, although
not useful in the evaluation of the genetic diversity of
Zatorska geese population, may however be helpful in
the studies of relationships between various breeds and
species of geese. Therefore the information about the
monomorphic microsatellite PCR products length and
optimal annealing temperature are given in Additional
file 1.
The set of successfully amplified microsatellite loci
were easy to score on 6% polyacrylamide gels. This was
true except for the three loci of poly-A microsatellite
repeats (CKW10, CKW11 and CKW12, Additional file
1). The genotyping of the latter may bring difficulties if
the 1bp allele size increments affect the occurrence of
considerable stutter bands in electrophoresis. The allele
size range at a locus of polymorphic markers varied
from 2 bp for 5 loci (APH12, Bca μ10, CKW14, CKW43
and TTUCG1) to 40 bp for TTUCG5 locus.
As mentioned earlier, the genetic distance between the
source species and the target species affect the cross-utility of microsatellites markers. The genetic distances
expressed by DNA - DNA melting temperature (ΔTm)
hybridization values between a broad range of bird species has been identified by Sibley and Ahlquist [20].
Unfortunately, those authors have not worked out many
species within the Anatidae family, but it has been
shown that the DNA - DNA TmH among this family is
certainly lower than 9.8. Any data for the genus Anser
are not available there, but the value of genetic distance
between this genous and ducks should be close to 6.7
which reflects the distance between Branta geese and
ducks (genus Anas, Melanitta and Aix). Branta and
Anser are clustered together in many phylogenic trees
[33,34]. As has been shown elsewhere [15], the increase
of TmH values from 6 to 12 corresponded rapidly to fall
in amplification success. Nevertheless, it is hard to predict acurately the probability of amplification of microsatellite loci from various anatid species in domestic

sets), swan goose (CKW) and pekin duck (APH and

quarters of the markers were effective in each marker

genetic diversity of Zatorska geese APH, the set of 11
microsatellite loci isolated in domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos
domesticus) [22]; Bca μ, the set of 8 markers from Canada goose
(Branta canadensis) [18]; CAUD-G, the set of 4 markers from

set. Among the sets of the markers isolated in Canada
geese, the Bca μ primer pairs, pre-verified in other species of genus Anser [18], were extremely effective
(100%), while TTUCG primers were moderately useful
(80%). The largest proportion of polymorphic markers
were observed in Bca μ marker set (87.50%) while the
APH marker set were the least polymorphic in Zatorska
geese studies with 36.36 percent of polymorphic loci
and the greatest proportion of monomorphic loci
(45.45%). Those sequences were isolated in domestic
duck, a species from a subfamily different to geese,
which probably suggests that homologous segments are
present in the genome of geese but does not behave as
hypervariable regions. The application of domestic duck
markers of the CAUD-G set was much more effective,
but those markers were pre-checked for amplification in
geese [17], and 75 percent of them were polymorphic in
this study. Only 28.57 percent of primer pairs form the
swan goose CKW set amplified polymorphic loci that
could be scored reliably. The singular white-fronted
goose Aal μ1 marker was highly polymorphic in
Zatorska geese study. Two harlequin duck (Hhi μ1, Hhi
μ3) markers were ineffective in our studies. Successful
amplification and polymorphism of microsatellite loci in
Zatorska geese was therefore greater using geese primers
than duck primers and is consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among these taxa [33,34]. Applicability was also higher if the chosen primers had been
previously tested in domestic or other geese. However,
an exception has been observed with swan goose CKW
markers, because although they were isolated from close
related species, they were poorly polymorphic in
Zatorska geese.

No products in appropriate length were found in reactions performed on Zatorska geese genomic DNA with
all the primers specific to chicken microsatellite loci.
Similarly, an attempt at application of 14 chicken markers in Canada geese ended in failure because none of
the chicken PCR primers yielded clean amplifications
[35]. Although Galliformes and Anseriformes are considered sister groups, their genetic distance (TmH) equals
22.9 [20]. It has been shown that a genetic distance larger than 20.0 decreases the probability of amplification
of the heterologous microsatellite loci to 20% [14].
Furthermore, the value of sequence divergence above
around 10-15 TmH often is too high for cross-species
amplification of microsatellite sequences [14]. Therefore
the distance between chicken and waterfowl is believed
to be large enough to inhibit the amplification of many
chicken loci in Zatorska geese. Surprisingly, in the studies of biodiversity of Chinese native geese breeds, the
usefulness of eight chicken microsatellite markers which
were tested in our experiment was stated [9,10].
Four primer pairs tested in this study (Aal μ1, APH12,
APH19, Hhi μ1) were previously examined in the graylag goose [8] providing polymorphic products. Three of
them, Aal μ1, APH12 and APH19 were effective in
Zatorska geese. We obtained one allele more in Aal μ1
marker than in the graylag, whereas in the APH19 locus
we found single allele in Zatorska geese. Two alleles
were found in APH12, both in Zatorska geese and in
graylag [8]. To assess the suitability of the microsatellite
markers in domestic geese diversity studies, we examined the presence of linkage between the polymorphic
loci. There was no significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium after Bonferroni correction in any pairwise
comparisons of the polymorphic microsatellite markers
[see Additional file 2]. At the moment, all of the microsatellite markers isolated or adapted for the studies in
domestic geese are anonymous and are not assigned to
chromosomes of this species, but their putative genomic
locations can be predicted based on sequence homology
to the assembled chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) or
the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome [13,16].
Sixteen of the 24 polymorphic loci were assigned by
Blast analysis to a predicted chromosomal location on
the chicken genome based on sequence homology (with
E-values ranging between 3 × 10-08 to 5 × 10-98). One
further domestic duck sequence (CAUD-G012) showed
homology to existing chicken genomic sequence of
unknown location. We demonstrate that these markers
are distributed relatively wide over 9 chromosomes
(Table 1). Also, on the basis of the results of linkage
analysis it is highly likely that most of the loci can be
broadly distributed on different chromosomes, and thus
may also be potential markers of multiple major genes
associated with economically important traits. Some of

the microsatellite loci, which seems to be putative
orthologous between domestic geese and duck are
already located in the duck chromosomes by genetic
linkage mapping [36]. Among duck markers which were
polymorphic in Zatorska geese studies, the CAUD(G)007 and APH12 markers are placed on 1st and 2nd large
duck chromosomes, respectively [36]. Moreover, three
of the APH markers (APH8, APH12, APH19), used in
our study, have been identified as flanking markers of
QTLs in the duck genome. The APH08 locus was considered as a flanking marker of QTLs influencing body
weight at six weeks of age and the weight of the heart
[37]. The last trait was also linked to APH12 in another
linkage group. Marker APH19 was linked to QTL that
affects both the body weight of ducks at two weeks of
age and girth of shank [37].
A total of 69 distinct alleles were found among the 24
polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci examined in the Zatorska geese breeding population (Table
2). Eight of the polymorphic loci displayed a significant
deviation from HWE (P > 0.05) and also high predicted
null allele frequency (equal or above 0.1). In the
CKW43 locus a different distribution of alleles in male
and female were identified. There was no case of a heterozygous state in the CKW43 locus in females (N =
76), therefore the observed heterozygosity (HO) equals
zero. Inversely, in 20 males the value of H O assumed
0.68 and was greater than the expected heterozygosity
(HE = 0.46). Such a situation indicate that the CKW43
locus is Z-chromosome linked, therefore information
about distribution of alleles in the CKW43 marker in
females was excluded from calculations of genetic variability in the population. Upon Blast analysis, the original
sequence of the swan goose CKW43 clone was assigned
a location on chicken Z-chromosome. The length of the
homologous sequence was only 36 base pairs (89% of
sequence similarity), thus the significance of the match
was low (E = 0.008, Table 1). This is the first report, to
the authors’ knowledge, concerning Z-linked microsatellite marker in the Anser genus. However three Z-linked
loci has been identified in related species such as

Canada goose (Branta canadensis) [18] and light-bellied
Brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota) [38].
One of the main measures of the suitability of microsatellite markers to assess genetic diversity in the population is the mean number of alleles at a given locus
[17]. The average number of alleles per locus (±St. Dev)
among 24 polymorphic markers in Zatorska geese was
2.85 ± 1.42. According to Barker [39], each microsatellite should exhibit at least four alleles to be considered
useful in the evaluation of genetic diversity in order to
reduce the standard errors of distance estimates. Only
six of our studied markers fall within this presumption.
This represents 22 percent of the polymorphic markers,
but it is worth emphasizing that only one breed with
small population was covered in the experiment. Such
conditions may indicate for inbreeding, but systematic
attempts have always been made to maintain the genetic
variation and large effective population size of the
Zatorska geese flock. To reduce the rate of inbreeding,
mating of close relatives were avoided, so the average
level of inbreeding in the population remained low
(below 4%) with less than 0.1% increase per generation
[40]. In order to determine the applicability of the markers we also calculated the mean number of alleles
across polymorphic loci (MNA) in five species-specific
marker sets separately. The highest values of MNA was
observed in the TTUCG markers (3.67) and the lowest
MNA value was in the APH marker set (2.50; Table 2).
The mean number of alleles across loci isolated in
Canada and swan geese was relatively high. The results
also confirmed the usefulness of markers from the
CAUD-G set, which were isolated in the domestic duck
but rated as effective in domestic geese studies [17].
Estimates for within-population diversity parameters
computed on the base of the results of genotyping of 24
polymorphic microsatellites are shown in Table 1. The
mean allelic richness index ranged between 1.03
(CKW5) and 3.81 (Bca μ1). The lowest and greatest
polymorphism information content (PIC) per locus was
0.03 (CKW5) and 0.69 (Bca μ1), respectively. An average
observed heterozygosity (HO ± St. Dev) in a population

was 0.35 ± 0.18 and ranged from 0.03 to 0.59 in CKW5
and Bca μ1 markers, respectively. The combined value
of H E over all polymorphic loci was 0.38 ± 0.20. The
two-parent probability of exclusion (PE) depended
greatly on markers and ranged from 0.03 (CKW5) to
0.67 (Bca μ1). Combined PE value for all polymorphic
loci was 99.98%. The overall probability of identity (PI),
considering all microsatellite markers, equals 2.79 × 1009
. Both the values of combined PE and PI obtained in
Zatorska geese allow us to ascertain that the use of
tested polymorphic markers enable to determine not
only the overall level of genetic variability of the population, but also the relationships between individuals. This
information is particularly important in breeding work
in such a small population in which the maximum of
the existing genetic variability should be maintained.
Ranks of best suitable markers for domestic goose
diversity studies are designed on the basis of the values
of RS and PIC indexes. The average RS and PIC values
per marker set are summarized in Table 2. The main
values of PIC in five species-specific marker sets ranged
from 0.29 in CKW markers to 0.38 in APH and no statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between main
PIC values were found. The detailed values of RS and
PIC for each polymorphic marker are given in Table 1.
Half of the six markers of RS index value amounting to
over 2.0 belong to the Bca μ marker set. The next most
common set in this ranking was CKW with two markers. Four of the six most allelic richness loci are also
characterized by the PIC index values greater than 0.5.
The levels of PIC or RS indexes are frequently considered
indicators of suitability of markers in conservation biology
studies. Regardless of the species specificity, it is accepted,
that the most useful markers in the genetic diversity studies
are those of PIC > 0.5 [41]. Moderately informative markers are these of midrange polymorphism (0.25 <PIC >
0.5), and low informative are these when PIC < 0.25
[17,42]. The PIC value exceeded 0.25 at 15 loci in Zatorska
geese (Table 2), which could provide enough information
for the assessment of genetic diversity in just this one
breed. In the experiment carried out on the 26 Chinese
geese breeds [9], 13 of the 31 markers were moderately
informative, but the PIC values of the remaining markers
exceed 0.5. Comparison of the mean values of PIC for different series of polymorphic microsatellite loci in Zatorska
geese showed no statistically significant differences,
although these loci have been isolated in different taxa.
The values of PIC or heterozygosity estimates calculated
from microsatellite markers in domestic birds are usually
much lower than in their wild ancestors. In this context it
is interesting that the values of HO and HE estimated from
polymorphic loci in the wild graylag amounted 0.36 and
0.42, respectively [8], and are almost identical to the mean
values obtained in domestic Zatorska geese. Therefore the

Page 8 of 10

proposed set of polymorphic markers can be considered as
sufficient for detailed studies on the population structure.
It seems reasonable to suppose that these markers, which
are adapted from other species, do not affect the undervaluation of genetic parameters.
Recently, 37 new microsatellite sequences have been
isolated and classified as polymorphic in light-bellied
Brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota) [38] that can be utilized for other goose studies, especially if the sequences
are checked to be conserved between Brent goose and
chicken or zebra finch. New advances have also been
made to create conserved microsatellite primer sets that
are able to amplify across a wide range of bird species
[43]. The method consists of selecting those EST microsatellite loci that had a high degree of sequence homology of primer bind sites between two genetically
distantly related bird species, the zebra finch and the
chicken, for which genomes assemblies are available.
This method could be applied to adopt microsatellite
markers for domestic geese, as well as other species.
Regardless of the origin of the markers, we identified
ineffective, monomorphic and polymorphic markers
with a varying number of alleles in sets of markers isolated from swan goose, Canada goose or domestic duck.
These results are consistent with the results of other
authors, both in relation to the loci isolated in the species [8] and markers adapted from related species [44].
Admittedly a decline in the effectiveness of microsatellite markers isolated from more phylogenetically distant
taxa as chicken and harlequin duck has been observed.
Considering the panel of 24 polymorphic markers
separately, it can be concluded that they constitute a
useful set of markers for the study of genetic relationships between individuals in a given population, as well
as for the genetic diversity studies of domestic geese,
both to the sufficient number of markers and their
potential high level of variability.
