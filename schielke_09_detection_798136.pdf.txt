Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E is an increasingly diagnosed human disease in Central Europe. Besides
domestic pigs, in which hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is highly prevalent, wild boars have been
identified as a possible source of human infection. In order to assess the distribution of HEV in the
wild boar population of Germany, we tested liver samples originating from different geographical
regions for the presence of the HEV genome and compared the detected sequences to animal and
human HEV strains.
Results: A total of 148 wild boar liver samples were tested using real-time RT-PCR resulting in an
average HEV detection rate of 14.9% (95% CI 9.6–21.6). HEV was detected in all age classes and all
geographical regions. However, the prevalence of HEV infection was significantly higher in rural as
compared to urban regions (p < 0.001). Sequencing of the PCR products indicated a high degree
of heterogenicity of the detected viruses within genotype 3 and a grouping according to their
geographical origin. The whole genome sequence of an HEV isolate (wbGER27) detected in many
wild boars in the federal state of Brandenburg was determined. It belongs to genotype 3i and shows
97.9% nucleotide sequence identity to a partial sequence derived from a human hepatitis E patient
from Germany.
Conclusion: The results indicate that wild boars have to be considered as a reservoir for HEV in
Germany and that a risk of HEV transmission to humans is present in rural as well as urban regions.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes a human disease with acute
hepatitis as the major clinical symptom. Although the
case-fatality rate of hepatitis E is low in the general population, rates up to 25% have been observed in pregnant

women [1]. In developing countries, HEV infection is one
of the most important causes of infectious hepatitis leading to epidemics associated with contaminated water
resources [2]. The hepatitis E cases in North America and
Central Europe could be either traced to imported infec-

tions from endemic regions or to autochthonous HEV
infections [3-5]. In Germany, an increasing number of
non-travel related hepatitis E cases have been notified in
the last years leading to an increase from 44% of 54 hepatitis E cases in 2005 to 63% of 73 hepatitis E cases in
2007 for the autochthonous infections [6].
HEV is a single-stranded RNA virus and the only member
of the unassigned genus Hepevirus [7]. Until now, four
genotypes and several subtypes have been defined [8].
Genotypes 1, 2 and 4 are found only in distinct geographical regions of the world whereas genotype 3 seems to
have a worldwide distribution [8]. Among genotype 3 and
4, HEV strains closely related to human HEV have been
detected in pigs, deer and wild boar indicating the possibility of a zoonotic transmission [2,9,10]. HEV strains isolated from pigs in the Netherlands have been shown to be
closely related to HEV strains from human cases of hepatitis E of the same region indicating that autochthonous
HEV infections may be acquired from pigs in Central
Europe [4,11,12].
Wild boars (Sus scrofa) have shown a significant increase
in the population density throughout Europe and the USA
over the past decades. Subsequently, migration to urban
areas and close contact between wild boars and humans
has been observed [13]. In Berlin, the capital city of Germany, the estimated number of wild boars living in urban
areas is 5.000 animals [13]. Reports on human hepatitis E
cases after consumption of uncooked meat from wild
boar strengthened the hypothesis of a zoonotic origin of
human HEV infections [14-16]. In Japan, wild boars have
been suggested to serve as a reservoir for HEV infections as
a broad variety of strains including those closely related to
human HEV strains has been detected in this animal species [9]. A high prevalence of HEV infection was demonstrated in a wild boar population of Italy [17]. In
Germany, HEV sequences have been detected in archived
sera of wild boar originally sampled in 1995/1996 demonstrating that the virus has been present in the wild animal population for a longer time [18,19]. Recently,
consumption of wild boar meat has been identified as a
risk factor for autochthonous HEV infections in Germany
[6].
In order to determine the actual distribution of HEV in
wild boars from Germany, liver samples were tested for
the presence of HEV and subsequently genotyped. By
comparing samples derived from different urban and
rural regions, possible differences in the epidemiology of
the infections were investigated. The availability of the
generated HEV sequences may serve as a basis for comparing actual and future human isolates to identify transmission events between wild boar and humans.

Methods
Samples
Liver tissue samples were collected from wild boars
hunted in the study area (federal states of Brandenburg
and Thuringia, cities of Berlin/Potsdam) for population
control between 2005 and 2008. Wild boars were categorized according to age (teeth method; shoats: <1 year,
yearlings: 1–2 years, adults: >2 years), sex, and location of
death for most samples. Wild boar samples were considered to originate from urban areas in case that they have
been sampled in settled areas (as defined by administrative districts) of more than 10,000 people. The remainder
samples were considered to originate from rural areas. All
samples had been stored at -80°C until analysis.
RNA extraction and PCR analysis of samples
RNA was isolated from liver suspensions using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) along with
QIAshredder collumns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted
RNA was tested by real-time RT-PCR according to Jothikumar et al. [20] in an ABI PRISM 7500 cycler using the
Quantitect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Positive samples were additionally tested by RT-PCR
according to Schlauder et al. [21] and modified by Herremans et al. [4] amplifying a 197 bp product of open reading frame (ORF)-2 using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For amplification of a 287 bp
product of ORF-1, a nested RT-PCR was performed
according to Preiss et al. [5] using the One-Step RT-PCR
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for the first round of RTPCR and the TaKaRa Ex Taq (Takara Bio Europe S.A.S.,
Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) for the nested PCR. PCR
products were separated on ethidium bromide-stained
1.5% agarose gels and visualized by UV light.
Amplification of the whole genome sequence of isolate
wbGER27
The genome of isolate wbGER27 was amplified by RTPCR in seven parts and by application of RACE protocols.
First, four PCR-products were generated using the primer
sets 1, 3 and 5 previously described by Xia et al. [22].
Then, primers ORF2F (5'-ACG TCT AGA ATG TGC CCT
AGG GCT KTT CTG-3', nt 5172–5192, nucleotide numbering according to wbGER27) and ORF2R (5'-ACG TCT
AGA TTA AGA CTC CCG GGT TTT RCC YAA-3', nt 7154–
7131) were used to amplify the complete ORF-2-encoding
region (constructed on the basis of an alignment of 24
HEV full-length sequences, not shown). Based on the
sequences determined for these PCR products, specific
primer pairs were constructed (5'-CCC GGT CGA CAG
AGG TGT ATG T-3' [nt 870–890] and 5'-CAT CAA AAA
CAA GCA CCC TTG GG-3' [nt 1382–1360]; 5'-ATT CAT
GCA GTG GCT CCT GAT T-3' [nt 2606–2627] and 5'-ATC

ACG AAA TTC ATA GCA GTG TG-3' [nt 4681–4659]) for
amplification of the remaining parts of the genome. For
RACE amplification of the 3'-end of the wbGER27
genome, reverse transcription was performed using the
primer pA1 (5'-CCG AAT TCC CGG GAT CCT17 V-3', complementary to poly A tail), followed by PCR with primers
5'-CCG AAT TCC CGG GAT CC-3' (binding site on primer
pA1) and 5'-ATT CGG CTC TTG CAG TCC TTG A-3' (nt
6982–7003). For RACE amplification of the 5'-end of the
wbGER27 genome, the 5' RACE System Kit (Invitrogen
GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used according to the
supplier protocol with the gene-specific primers 5'-CCA
ACT GCC GGG GTT GCA TCA A-3' (nt 191–170) and 5'GAA TCT CAG TTT GCA CAC GAG A-3' (nt 161–140). All
RT-PCRs were performed using the QIAGEN LongRange
2Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse
transcription was carried out in a 20 μl reaction at 42°C
for 90 min. PCR was subsequently performed in a 2720
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA)
using 5 μl of cDNA in 50 μl reactions and 93°C for 3 min,
35 cycles of 93°C for 30 sec, 56°C for 30 sec and 68°C for
5 min, and a final incubation at 68°C for 7 min.
Sequence analysis
RT-PCR products considered for sequence analysis were
purified using the Qiaquick DNA purification kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and subsequently cloned into the vector pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for
Sequencing (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The
inserts of the plasmids were sequenced using M13 Forward and M13 Reverse primers (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) as well as gene-specific primers in an ABI
3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
USA). The sequence of the wbGER27 genome was assembled from the determined sequence pieces using the
SeqBuilder module of the DNASTAR software package
(Lasergene, Madison, USA) and submitted to the GenBank database with accession number FJ705359. The partial sequences determined here were deposited with
GenBank accession numbers FJ748515 – FJ748531.
Sequence similarity searches were performed using the
BLAST 2.2.14 search facility [23] and the GenBank database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of
the nucleotide sequences using the MegAlign module of
the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison,
USA) with the CLUSTAL W method and a bootstrap analysis with 1000 trials and 111 random seeds.
Statistical analysis
For comparison of categorical variables between groups,
we used the summary χ2 test and Fisher's exact test. Calculations were done using Intercooled Stata 10 software
(Stata Corporation, Texas, USA). A p-value of <0.05 was
considered significant. The exact binomial method was

used to calculate 95% confidence intervals of single proportions.

Results
Detection of HEV RNA in wild boar liver samples from
Germany
A total of 148 liver samples from wild boar originating
from different regions of Germany were analysed by realtime RT-PCR for the detection of the HEV genome. By this,
22 samples were tested positive resulting in an overall
detection rate of 14.9% (95%CI 9.6–21.6). A detailed
analysis showed that 14 out of 54 (25.9%; 95%CI: 14.9–
39.7) and 5 out of 21 (23.8%; 95%CI 8.2–47.2) were
tested positive in the rural areas of the federal states of
Brandenburg and Thuringia, respectively. In the cities of
Berlin/Potsdam, 3 out of 73 (4.1%; 95%CI 0.9–11.6) wild
boars were tested positive. The difference of detection
rates among wild boars originating from rural vs. urban
areas was highly significant (p < 0.001). The distinct distribution of positively and negatively tested areas is
shown in Figure 1. The detection rate was highest in

shoats (19,7%) and adult animals (12,9%), while 5,9% of
yearlings were tested positive for HEV. The detection rate
was unrelated to sex (p = 0.1).
Genotyping of detected HEV strains
The positive samples were further analysed by RT-PCR
amplifying a 197 bp fragment of ORF-2. Bands of the
expected length could be detected in 14 out of the 22 samples and the DNA sequence could be determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the 148 bp sequence (excluding the
primer sequences) indicated that all isolates belonged to
genotype 3. Further subtyping was performed by comparison with prototype sequences of genotype 3 subtypes [8].
Although the resulting phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) generally shows low bootstrap values, which is most probably
due to the short sequence used, a grouping according to
the assigned subtypes is evident for the prototype strains.
The sequences of wild boars clustered within different
subgroups according to their geographical origin: the 9
sequences from Brandenburg clustered in genotype 3i, the
two sequences from Thuringia clustered in genotype 3h,
the two sequences from Potsdam clustered in genotype 3a
and the isolate from Berlin branched between genotypes
3c and 3g.

Comparison of HEV sequences to human HEV strains from
Germany
To enable a comparison of the wild boar isolates with
human HEV isolates derived from autochthonous infections acquired in Germany, sequences were retrieved from
the GenBank database. As only partial sequences of ORF1 were available, amplification of the corresponding
region was tried by nested RT-PCR analysis of the positively tested wild boar samples. A PCR product with the
expected length was only detected in three cases (isolates
wbGER27, wbGER77 and wbGER155). As these samples
also had shown the lowest ct values in real-time RT-PCR,
the amount of HEV genome may be considered as the limiting factor for a positive ORF-1 PCR. The PCR products
were compared to sequences of 15 genotype 3 isolates
derived from recent human hepatitis E cases from Germany [6]. A very close relationship between the wild boar
isolate wbGER27 and the human isolate V0706586 is evident from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3), which reflects
97.9% nucleotide sequence identity between both strains
within the 287 bp fragment analysed. With 92.1% nucleotide sequence identity, the human isolate V0609076 was
most closely related to the wild boar isolate wbGER155.
The human isolate V0703163 and the wild boar isolate
wbGER77 showed 89.7% nucleotide sequence identity.

and which was nearly identical to the other 8 sequences
detected in wild boars from Brandenburg, its whole
genome sequence was determined. It consists of 7222
nucleotides (excluding the poly A tail). A BLAST search of
the GenBank database using the full-length genome
sequence of wbGER27 revealed the highest degree of identity with strain swMN06-A1288, which was originally
detected in a pig from Mongolia. This close relationship is
also reflected by a phylogenetic tree constructed on the
basis of 20 HEV full-length sequences derived from the
GenBank database (Figure 4). As no definitive subtype has
been assigned to this Mongolian isolate, a grouping of
wbGER27 is difficult. However, as it shows only up to
85.3% nucleotide sequence identity to the other isolates
and as analysis of the ORF-2 fragment indicated grouping
into genotype 3i, this isolate may be considered as the first
full-length sequence of genotype 3i. Similar relationships
were evident by analysing the deduced amino acid
sequences of ORF-1, ORF-2 and ORF-3, with the highest
identities of 96.2%, 97.6% and 90.2%, respectively, to
those of isolate swMN06-A1288. An analysis of the noncoding regions revealed highly conserved sequences in the
5'-end as well as in the last 23 nucleotides directly adjacent to the poly A tail, but sequence variability in the
residual 3' non-coding region.

may be explained by the use of different sample material
and different storage durations of the samples. A high
prevalence of 25% has been also reported for wild boars
from Italy, however, only a single population had been
investigated in this study [17]. In Japan, several studies
reported the detection of HEV or HEV-specific antibodies
in the wild boar population leading to the assumption
that these animals serve as a reservoir for human HEV
infection [9,10,24].
Differences in the determined prevalences may also be
caused by the different populations investigated. One of
the most obvious finding of our study is the different
detection rate in rural vs. urban regions, indicating that a
more efficient virus spread among the wild boar population is possible in rural settings. The ecological and/or
biological variations between rural vs. urban wild boar
populations, which may explain these differences, remain
elusive so far. Although with a low number, however,
HEV was also detected in urban regions thus indicating
that either direct or indirect transmission of HEV from
wild boar to humans has to be taken into account in cities
also. Notably, the shift from sylvatic to synanthropic
occurrence of this game species might lead to a future
increase of the infection pressure from HEV on the human
population.

Discussion
Our investigations show that HEV is highly prevalent in
the German wild boar population with an average detection rate of 14.9% in liver samples. This proportion is
higher than that demonstrated in a previous study showing that HEV could be detected in 5.3% of archived German wild boar sera [19]. The differences in detection rates

Comparison of the entire full-length sequences theHEV boar
Comparison of the entire genome sequence of the
wild boar isolate wbGER27 with 20 full-length
sequences of HEV. Strain designations, accession numbers,
host species and geographical origin of the isolates are indicated. Isolate wbGER27 is shown in red colour. Assigned
genotypes are indicated with blue bars. The phylogenetic
tree is scaled in nucleotide substitution units.

We detected a number of different subtypes in the wild
boars which clustered due to their geographical origin.
This finding argues against short-term epidemics of a certain strain and supports the assumption that several HEV
subtypes are endemic in the wild boar population underlining the role of this animal species as a virus reservoir.
Clustering of HEV strains according to their geographical
distribution has been previously reported for domestic
pigs and humans [3,4,11,12]. For domestic pigs in Germany, no data on the prevalence of HEV infection and on
the distribution of specific genotypes are available so far.
However, in analogy with other European countries
[11,22,25,26], a high prevalence of infection with a variety of genotype 3 HEV strains could be expected. Therefore both, domestic pigs and wild boars, have to be
considered as reservoirs for HEV in Germany, which may
be important for the development of strategies for prevention of HEV infections. In case of wild animals, eradication of the virus infection is more difficult and other
groups of the human population have to be considered to
be exposed to the virus than in the case of domestic pigs.
Most important, significant homologies were detected
between the HEV isolates of wild boars and those derived
from autochthonous human cases of hepatitis E, which
had been acquired in Germany. Unfortunately, no further
information on the distinct geographical origin within
Germany or on possible contacts to wild boars was avail-

able for these human cases. However, the exceptional
high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between
the wild boar isolate wbGER27 and the human isolate
V0706586 suggests a direct connection between both by
direct or indirect (food-borne or by surfaces, environment, or other carrier animals) transmission from wild
boar to human. Alternatively, contact of wild boar and
human to the same, so far unknown, virus source has to
be taken into consideration. The full-length genome
sequence of isolate wbGER27 may help to identify further
transmission events as it can be compared to any genome
fragment generated from a human HEV isolate. Until
now, no other HEV full-length sequences derived from
wild animals of Europe are available. The generation of
more full-length sequences will be necessary due to the
detected genetic heterogenicity of the isolates as shown
for pigs in Europe [22,26].

Conclusion
In summary, the results indicate that wild boars may be an
important reservoir for HEV in Germany possessing a significant risk for HEV infection of humans. This risk is
obvious for hunters, which may be infected during dissection of wild boars. However, consumption of undercooked wild boar meat or contact with faecal
contaminations of wild boars may also be taken into consideration. Moreover, HEV was detected with no significant differences in all age groups of wild boars which is in
contrast to the situation in domestic pigs, where the age
class of 10 to 15 weeks of age is predominantly infected
[25,27], thus increasing the risk of virus transmission. The
distinct reasons for these differences are not known so far.
However, the more intensive contacts between domestic
pigs in animal production may explain a more rapid virus
spread as compared to the epidemiological situation with
rarer contacts between wild boar herds. In Germany, up to
500,000 wild boars are hunted yearly [28], out of these
more than 2,000 wild boars in the urban region of Berlin
[29]. Further studies on the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of HEV infections are necessary to develop
effective measurements for prevention of virus transmission to humans.
