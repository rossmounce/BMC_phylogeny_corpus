DNA methylation patterns provide insight into
epigenetic regulation in the Pacific oyster
(Crassostrea gigas)
Mackenzie R Gavery, Steven B Roberts*

Abstract
Background: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism with important regulatory functions in animals. While
the mechanism itself is evolutionarily ancient, the distribution and function of DNA methylation is diverse both
within and among phylogenetic groups. Although DNA methylation has been well studied in mammals, there are
limited data on invertebrates, particularly molluscs. Here we characterize the distribution and investigate potential
functions of DNA methylation in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas).
Results: Methylation sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR approaches were used to identify CpG
methylation in C. gigas genes and demonstrated that this species possesses intragenic methylation. In silico analysis
of CpGo/e ratios in publicly available sequence data suggests that DNA methylation is a common feature of the C.
gigas genome, and that specific functional categories of genes have significantly different levels of methylation.
Conclusions: The Pacific oyster genome displays intragenic DNA methylation and contains genes necessary for
DNA methylation in animals. Results of this investigation suggest that DNA methylation has regulatory functions in
Crassostrea gigas, particularly in gene families that have inducible expression, including those involved in stress and
environmental responses.

Background
Epigenetic mechanisms induce changes in gene activity
without alteration to the underlying DNA sequence [1].
Common epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNA activity.
The most well-studied of these is DNA methylation,
which refers to the addition of a methyl group to position
5 of cytosines. In animals, this reaction is catalyzed by a
family of enzymes called DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (DNMTs) and occurs almost exclusively in CpG
dinucleotides. DNA methylation is typically associated
with transcriptional repression, and is primarily achieved
by methylation in gene promoters [2-4]. The functional
significance of DNA methylation in vertebrates includes
providing genomic stability [5], regulation of imprinted
genes [6] and X-chromosome inactivation [7]. In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for development and
cell differentiation [8] and defects or unintended changes

in DNA methylation can have deleterious consequences
such as embryonic lethality [9] and tumorgenesis [10].
DNA methylation, like many epigenetic marks, may be
heritable, therefore unintended changes as a result of
environmental exposures or other processes can be
passed on for multiple generations [11].
The extent of cytosine methylation varies considerably
among eukaryotes. In vertebrates, approximately 70-80%
of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are methylated [12], a
pattern referred to as global methylation. Invertebrates
display a wide range of DNA methylation, from very
limited methylation in Drosophilia melanogaster [13]
and Caenorhabditis elegans [14] to a mosaic pattern of
methylation in the sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) [15] and Ciona intestinalis [16,17]. Bird and
Taggart [12] concluded that there were three general
types of methylation patterns: the ‘insect-type’ which
shows little to no methylation, the ‘echinoderm-type’,
the genomes of which contain both methylated and
non-methylated fractions, and the heavily methylated
‘vertebrate-type’. Recent studies in the honey bee (Apis

mellifera) indicate these patterns may be more complex
[18,19]. In contrast to D. melanogaster, which lacks
most of the classical DNMTs [20] and shows limited
cytosine methylation [21], A. mellifera has a fully functional set of DNA methylation enzymes and shows substantial methylation across its genome [18].
In vertebrates, regulation of transcription by DNA
methylation is accomplished by differential patterns of
methylation in intergenic regions, namely gene promoters [2-4]. In contrast, there are no significant differences reported in the methylation status of gene
promoters in invertebrates, where methylation appears
to be targeted specifically to transcription units [17,22].
Computational analyses of the methylation status of A.
mellifera genes have provided some of the first evidence
supporting a regulatory role of intragenic DNA methylation in invertebrates [19,23]. In these studies, genes
associated with general metabolic or ‘housekeeping’
functions were predicted to be hyper-methylated,
whereas caste-specific genes were preferentially hypomethylated. This functional clustering suggests DNA
methylation serves to regulate gene transcription in A.
mellifera, however, it is uncertain if this function is conserved across invertebrate taxa. Furthermore, it is
unclear exactly how intragenic cytosine methylation
directly affects transcription.
Studies in A. mellifera and others illustrate the diversity of DNA methylation patterns in invertebrate taxa
and highlight gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary and functional significance of DNA methylation.
One taxonomic group that has been notably absent
from these investigations is the phylum Mollusca. Molluscs were first categorized as having ‘echinoderm-type’
DNA methylation patterns based on experimental evidence using the common mussel (Mytilus edulis) [12].
Since then, there has been little investigation of DNA
methylation in molluscs with the exception of evidence
suggesting the presence CpG methylation in the clam,
Donux truculus [24]. In addition to increasing our
understanding of the evolution of DNA methylation in
invertebrate taxa, this study provides an opportunity to
evaluate the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) as a model
organism for analyzing DNA methylation in an aquatic
species. Bivalve molluscs are important bioindicators
[25] and elucidating the functional significance of DNA
methylation in these organisms may prove valuable for
understanding the effects of environmental stress in
aquatic organisms. Here, we report the first investigation
into DNA methylation profiles in the genome of the
Pacific oyster. We confirm the presence of intragenic
CpG methylation in C. gigas. We also demonstrate a
relationship between predicted methylation status and
gene function, suggesting that DNA methylation performs important regulatory functions in C. gigas.

Implications of these findings are discussed in both an
evolutionary and ecological context.

Results
Methylation Sensitive PCR

A Methylation Sensitive PCR (MSP) approach was used
to identify specific methylated sites. Five genes associated with immune function were analyzed and methylation status determined (Table 1). Methylation status
can be concluded based on the presence or absence of a
PCR product in the methylation sensitive HpaII digest.
Of the five genes analyzed, CpG methylation was confirmed for heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), whereas no
methylation was detectable at restriction site(s) for the
other sequences examined. The CpG observed to
expected ratios (see Methods for calculation) are
included in Table 1 for each gene. It should be noted
that hsp70 has the lowest ratio of all the genes analyzed
(0.57). This low ratio is predictive of a hyper-methylated
status, which is confirmed here by MSP.
Bisulfite Sequencing PCR

In order to describe methylated cytosines outside of
CCGG sites, Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) was used.
Five genes predicted to be hyper-methylated, and five
predicted to be hypo-methylated (based on CpG
observed to expected ratio) were randomly selected for
analysis. Valid PCR products were produced for two of
the genes. This is a typical result as the conversion of
unmethylated cytosines results in challenges for primer
specificity. Four individual clones were sequenced for
each of the two products. There was a 100% conversion
rate for non-CpG cytosines for each of the clones
sequenced. In the first fragment, a 136 bp fragment with
homology to the amino terminal fragment of the human
neuromedin-u receptor [Swiss-Prot: Q9GZQ4”], one of
seven CpGs sites displayed methylation in 25% of the
clones sequenced (Figure 1(a)). In a second fragment,
one of two CpGs sites was determined to be methylated
in 50% of the clones sequenced in a 93 bp region (Figure 1(b)). The latter sequence has significant homology
to human bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain,
1A [Swiss-Prot: Q9NRL2].
In Silico Analysis of C. gigas Transcriptome

The ratio of observed to expected CpG dinucleotides
(CpGo/e) was used to predict methylation status in the
C. gigas transcriptome. This approach is based on the
known hyper-mutability of methylated cytosines, which
readily deaminate to thymine residues [26]. This CpG
mutation is not easily corrected by DNA repair machinery, and as a result consistently methylated regions of
DNA are depleted of CpG dinucleotides over evolutionary time [27]. Consequently, regions of DNA with a low

Results of methylation status of five genes associated with immune response by MSP. PCR was carried out on undigested, HpaII digested, and MspI digested
DNA. Presence (+) or absence (-) of PCR product is indicated. Number of CCGG restriction sites in the indicated sequence and CpGo/e ratios are also provided.

CpGo/e are predicted to be methylated, whereas regions
with a high CpGo/e (approaching 1.0) are predicted to
be unmethylated. This approach has been used to reliably predict methylation status across many taxonomic
groups [17,19,22,28].
A non-redundant C. gigas contig database, ‘GigasDatabase’ version 6 [29] was utilized for this analysis. To
ensure only CpG (and not GpC) dinucleotides were
being evaluated, analysis was limited to annotated
sequences. The probability density function of the
CpGo/e for 12,210 annotated C. gigas expressed
sequence tag (EST) contigs is illustrated in Figure 2. We
find that the data fit a bimodal mixture model (blue
curve) significantly better than a unimodal distribution.
The red curves represent the scaled, normal mixture
components, which have means of 0.40 (± 0.12 SD) and
0.70 (± 0.21 SD) respectively (Figure 2). A majority of
the contigs have a CpGo/e less than 1.0.
The ratio of observed to expected GpC dinucleotide
frequencies (GpCo/e) was calculated in order to be
assured that the bimodal distribution of CpGo/e was
not biased toward G+C content of specific genes as
there are no known mechanisms for preferential depletion of the GpC dinucleotide. As predicted, the ratio of
observed to expected GpC’s approaches 1.0 following a
unimodal Gaussian distribution (Figure 2 inset). In addition, there is a significant negative correlation between
CpGo/e and TpGo/e (p = 0.00) indicating that the

depletion of CpG dinucleotides is associated with the
conversion of methylated CpG sites to TpG
dinucleotides.
In order to determine any functional difference that
may exist among those genes with lower than expected
CpGo/e ratios, data were analyzed in the context of
each gene’s biological process GO Slim term (Figure 3).
Several biological processes have CpGo/e ratios that are
significantly different from each other (see Additional
file 1: Matrix of p-values for comparisons between GO
Slim categories based on CpGo/e). Specifically, genes
with lower CpGo/e ratios (predicted to be hyper-methylated) were associated with DNA metabolism, RNA
metabolism, and cell cycle and proliferation. Biological
processes with higher CpGo/e ratios (predicted to be
hypo-methylated) include cell adhesion, cell-to-cell signalling and signal transduction. This analysis confirms
that the normal mixture components described previously in Figure 2 are enriched with genes from particular functional categories.

Discussion
Results of methylation specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR indicate that the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea
gigas) genome is methylated. Further evidence supporting
the presence and importance of methylation in C. gigas is
the identification of genes that encode DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), the family of proteins responsible for the

enzymatic conversion of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine.
Animals that lack DNA methylation such as C. elegans
also lack essential DNMTs, while invertebrates with an
intermediate level of DNA methylation such as honey
bees, sea urchins and urochordates have the full set of
DNMT genes [30]. Sequences with high homology to
DNMT3 (responsible for de novo methylation), DNMT1
(associated with maintenance methylation), and methylCpG-binding domain protein 2 (mediation of the effects
of DNA methylation) are present in a publicly available C.
gigas contig database, GigasDatabase version 6 [29]. These
annotated sequences can be found in GigasDatabase with
accession numbers CU684371.p.cg.6 (e-value 1e-61),
CU994437.p.cg.6 (e-value 2e-26), and AM861084.p.cg.6
(e-value 1e-11), respectively. While a DNMT2 homolog
has not been identified, it may not be required for DNA

methylation in C. gigas as it functions primarily as a tRNA
methyltransferase and shows only weak DNA methyltransferase activity in vitro [31]. DNMTs are an evolutionarily
conserved group of proteins, but show structural diversity
both within and among taxa [32]. The evolutionary diversity of DNA methylation within and among phylogenetic
groups provides justification for further evaluation of the
functions of this epigenetic mark.
The presence of intragenic methylation in C. gigas is
similar to that of other invertebrates that primarily exhibit intragenic DNA methylation patterns [33,17], the
roles of which have been largely unexplored. Studies of
DNA methylation in mammals have generally focused
on promoter regions, where hyper-methylation of promoters inhibits initiation of transcription [2]. In contrast, invertebrate genomes do not show differentially

methylated gene promoters [22]. One of the long-standing hypotheses is that intragenic DNA methylation prevents inappropriate initiation of transcription outside of
promoter regions [34]; however new studies have begun
to investigate a more active role for intragenic DNA
methylation, namely in regulation of expression. For
example, exonic DNA methylation has been shown to
regulate transcription of the phytochrome A gene in
Arabidopsis thaliana [35]. In humans, investigation of
intragenic CpG islands (≥ 200 bp regions with G+C
content of at least 50% and CpGo/e close to expected)
has revealed that CpG islands in terminal exons may
regulate transcription of non-coding RNAs [36]. Here,
using BSP, we observed methylation variability in two
CpG sites that may indicate cell-specific methylation.
The function of intragenic DNA methylation in C. gigas
cannot be conclusively determined from this study, but
results of studies in other organisms suggest that it
could be involved in either repression of transcription
outside of transcription start sites and/or regulation of
expression.

Within the transcriptome of the Pacific oyster, a significant difference in methylation pattern was observed
across gene families. A majority of C. gigas genes analyzed were depleted in CpG dinucleotides (i.e. CpGo/e <
1.0) and show a significantly bimodal distribution, suggesting that DNA methylation is a common feature of
the C. gigas transcriptome, and that certain groups of
genes have significantly different levels of methylation.
The bimodal distribution of CpGo/e is similar to the
pattern observed in the honey bee A. mellifera, where
authors reported a hyper-methylated fraction that was
enriched in genes involved with general metabolic functions and a hypo-methylated fraction enriched with
genes that are associated with caste-specific functions
[19]. Similarly when C. gigas transcripts were clustered
according to their functional annotations using GO Slim
terms, we see that the two distributions are comprised
of functionally distinct classes of genes with varying regulatory requirements. Specifically, genes predicted to be
hyper-methylated are associated with housekeeping
functions and those predicted to be hypo-methylated are

Gavery and Roberts BMC Genomics 2010, 11:483
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/483

associated with general immune functions. Hypermethylation of intragenic regions of housekeeping genes
is consistent between C. gigas and A. mellifera [19], but
stands in contrast to observations in vertebrates, where
distinct hypo-methylation of housekeeping gene promoters is associated with global expression [37]. Constitutive DNA methylation in housekeeping genes in C. gigas
could be important for repressing transcription outside
of promoter regions as previously discussed. It has also
been proposed that hyper-methylation of housekeeping
genes in A. mellifera indicates epigenetic control of gene
activity in housekeeping genes [23]. Further experiments
will be required to determine whether hyper-methylation of housekeeping genes plays a passive role in preventing inappropriate transcription or a more active role
in maintaining expression in C. gigas.
Highest CpGo/e ratios were observed in genes
involved in the oyster’s innate immune response, including categories of cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling, and
signal transduction. Our experimental data using MSP
supports the predicted hypo-methylation of this class of
genes as only 1 of the 5 immune related genes were
methylated. Our results do not indicate that DNA
methylation is entirely absent from genes in the hypomethylated group as CpG depletion is still observed
(CpGo/e 0.7) which stands in contrast to the hypomethylated genes in A. mellifera (CpGo/e >1.0). One
explanation as to why it would be advantageous for this
class of genes to be hypo-methylated is that it allows for
greater epigenetic flexibility and higher regulatory control. Oysters have been shown to have high phenotypic
plasticity in response to environmental changes and
stress [38,39] and it could be postulated that an epigenetic mark, such as DNA methylation, could provide
this level of control. DNA methylation has been generally considered to be a less dynamic epigenetic mark,
however, it has been reported in plants that DNA
methylation levels are involved in regulating gene
expression in response to stress and show active methylation and demethylation in response to various stressors [40-42]. It has been hypothesized from these
studies that DNA methylation is a possible mechanism
to impart protection against local stresses in future generations [43]. The identification of genes involved in
demethylation in C. gigas would be an important step
toward uncovering the nature of these epigenetic marks.
DNA methylation patterns have been shown to be
heritable in mammalian taxa [44], and changes in DNA
methylation patterns can persist for multiple generations
[45]. Little work has been done to investigate heritability
of DNA methylation in invertebrates, although a recent
study of the crustacean, Daphnia magna, has shown
transgenerational heritability of DNA methylation patterns after exposures to 5-azacytidine [46]. If DNA

Page 6 of 9

methylation does play a role in regulation of transcription in C. gigas it may provide a mechanism not only
for regulating responses to stress, but also for adapting
to local stressors through heritability of DNA methylation patterns. Investigating the potential of epigenetic
control in mechanisms of local adaptation may prove
useful in understanding impacts of anthropogenic inputs
in aquatic ecosystems and populations. Likewise, it is
possible that epigenetic mechanisms may provide an
explanation for other phenomena associated with heritability such as inbreeding depression and hybrid vigour.
Elucidating functional significance of DNA methylation
in aquatic invertebrates may change the way we study
impacts of environmental change in aquatic organisms. A
range of factors such as diet [47,48], xenobiotic chemicals
[49], and endocrine disruptors [11] have been shown to
disrupt DNA methylation patterns. These epigenetic disruptions are increasingly associated with disease susceptibility, which in some cases can be passed on for multiple
generations [50]. Although these investigations have been
performed almost exclusively in mammalian species,
recent studies have reported a dose dependent relationship between concentration of mercury and cadmium
and total DNA methylation in D. magna [46,51]. Understanding which environmental factors can affect DNA
methylation and elucidating the functional significance of
DNA methylation in these important bioindicator species
will be major steps toward clarifying the complex interactions between the environment, gene expression, and
organismal responses.

Conclusions
The Pacific oyster genome displays methylation. In silico
analysis reveals intragenic regions are targeted for
methylation consistent with reports of methylation in
other invertebrate species. Results of this investigation
suggest that DNA methylation has regulatory functions
in Crassostrea gigas, particularly in gene families
involved in stress and environmental response. Experiments are underway in our lab to investigate relationships between the environment, DNA methylation, and
control of gene expression to better characterize this
process. In-depth analysis of methylation patterns in
Crassostrea gigas, will help to advance the field of evolutionary epigenetics and will serve to illuminate functions
of DNA methylation in invertebrates.
Methods
Animal collection & DNA isolation

Oysters used in this study were collected from naturalized C. gigas populations in Puget Sound, Washington.
To isolate genomic DNA, 25 mg of gill tissue was processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA).

Methylation Sensitive PCR

Oyster genomic DNA was enzyme digested with either
HpaII or MspI. Five immune related genes containing
one or more CCGG recognition sites and covering a
broad range of predicted methylation status (based on
CpGo/e) were selected from a set of ESTs generated
from a cDNA library of plated hemocytes [52]. PCR primers were designed to flank one or more restriction
sites. Primer sequences are provided in Additional file 2:
Primer Sequences. Quantitative PCR was performed
using digested (HpaII or MspI) and undigested samples
using 1× Immomix Master Mix (Bioline USA Inc., Boston, MA), 2 uM SYTO-13 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and 0.2 uM forward and reverse primers in an Opticon
2 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the following
cycling conditions: 10 min at 95C, followed by 37 cycles
of 15 sec at 95C, 30 sec at 55C, and 1 min at 72C and a
final extension at 72C for 10 min. Results were scored
qualitatively based on the presence or absence of amplification as determined by fluorescence.
Bisulfite Conversion and Sequencing

Genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using the Epitect
Bisulfite conversion kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly,
1.75 ug of DNA was subjected to treatment with sodium
bisulfite at increased temperature to deaminate
unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil. Following
treatment, the solution was desulfonated on a column,
washed and eluted.
To identify methylated cytosines in expressed regions
of the oyster genome, Meth Primer [53] was used to
design primers that flank multiple CpG sites, but do not
contain CpGs. Primer sequences are provided in Additional file 2: Primer Sequences. The mean expected
amplicon length for bisulfite primers was ~180 bp. PCR
of bisulfite treated samples (54 ng/PCR reaction) was
carried out using Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix
(Apex BioResearch Products, Research Triangle Park,
NC) for 10 min at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec
at 95 C, 30 sec at 55 C, and 1 min at 72C and a final
extension at 72C for 10 min.
PCR products were separated using gel electrophoresis.
Single bands were excised from the gel, purified using
Ultra-DA purification columns (Ambion, Foster City,
CA) and cloned using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). Four clones were sequenced for each primer pair.
Methylation status was determined by comparing the
sequence of bisulfite treated DNA to sequence of
untreated DNA using Geneious 4.5.4 software (Biomatters Ltd., Aukland, NZ) and annotated using BLAST [54].
In Silico Analysis: Predicted DNA Methylation Status

For in silico analysis, the non-redundant C. gigas
expressed sequence tag (EST) contig database,

Page 7 of 9

‘GigasDatabase’ version 6 (http://public-contigbrowser.
sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/index.html, [29]), was
utilized. Analysis was limited to annotated sequences (n
= 12,210) in order to be confident that sequences were
reported in the 5’ to 3’direction. It should be noted that
this transcriptomic dataset is appropriate for predicting
methylation status of the C. gigas genome as investigation into other invertebrate species shows that DNA
methylation is specifically targeted to transcribed regions
of the genome [17,12].
CpG observed/expected ratio (CpGo/e) was calculated
using the following equation where l is the number of
nucleotides in the contig:
CpGo/e =

number of CpG
l2
×
number of C×number of G l −1

To evaluate the distribution of Pacific oyster contigs, a
mixture model was fit to the CpGo/e ratios using the
mixtools package [55] in R [56] yielding a two component mixture where p1 + p2 = 1. Hence the data Ci, are
distributed as:
C i ~ p1N(1 ,  1) + p 2N( 2 2 ).

The log likelihood statistic of the bimodal mixture
model was compared to the normal null model to test
for a significant improvement in fit.
In order to evaluate the variation of CpGo/e within and
among functional classes of genes, contigs from the GigasDatabase annotated with a biological process GO term (n
= 10,699 contigs) were assigned a functional group based
on the MGI GO Slim database http://www.informatics.jax.
org[57]. Since each contig may have multiple GO terms,
contigs were allowed to fall into multiple GO Slim bins.
However, to avoid weighting within a single category, an
individual contig was not allowed to be included more than
once in a single GO Slim bin. The mean CpGo/e and standard errors were calculated for each GO Slim term. A oneway ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A significance level of p < 0.05 was accepted.
