Diversification of land plants: insights from a
family-level phylogenetic analysis
Omar Fiz-Palacios1,2*, Harald Schneider3, Jochen Heinrichs4 and Vincent Savolainen1,5

Abstract
Background: Some of the evolutionary history of land plants has been documented based on the fossil record
and a few broad-scale phylogenetic analyses, especially focusing on angiosperms and ferns. Here, we reconstructed
phylogenetic relationships among all 706 families of land plants using molecular data. We dated the phylogeny
using multiple fossils and a molecular clock technique. Applying various tests of diversification that take into
account topology, branch length, numbers of extant species as well as extinction, we evaluated diversification rates
through time. We also compared these diversification profiles against the distribution of the climate modes of the
Phanerozoic.
Results: We found evidence for the radiations of ferns and mosses in the shadow of angiosperms coinciding with
the rather warm Cretaceous global climate. In contrast, gymnosperms and liverworts show a signature of declining
diversification rates during geological time periods of cool global climate.
Conclusions: This broad-scale phylogenetic analysis helps to reveal the successive waves of diversification that
made up the diversity of land plants we see today. Both warm temperatures and wet climate may have been
necessary for the rise of the diversity under a successive lineage replacement scenario.

Background
It is believed that climate change is one of the main factors affecting global biodiversity [1-3]. During the history
of life, fluctuations of the world’s climate have most likely
caused major extinctions [4] and led to the development
of new ecosystems, promoting new biotic interactions
and the evolution of novel adaptive traits. The dynamics
of such diversification events can be studied based on
phylogenetic trees dated with fossils. Here we focus on
land plants. The origin and diversification of land plants
has intrigued biologists for centuries. According to the
fossil record, land plants diverged from green algae
before 475 million years ago (Ma; first land plant fossil)
and led to the major clades found today [5,6]. These are
liverworts (74 families, ca. 6,000 spp. [7]), mosses (112
families, ca. 12,000 spp. [8,9]), hornworts (five families,
ca. 150 spp. [10]) and tracheophytes. The latter include
ferns (45 families, ca. 9,000 spp. [11]), lycophytes (three
families, ca. 1,200 spp. [12]), and seed plants, which in

turn are separated into gymnosperms (14 families, ca.
1,000 spp. [13]) and angiosperms (456 families, ca.
260,000 spp. [13]).
There are various possible scenarios to describe the
processes that influenced land plant diversification
throughout geological time. One frequently proposed
scenario is based on a successive replacement of ancestral
lineages by more derived lineages, which in turn evolved
similar habits (e.g., tree-like structure for forested ecosystems), and diversified to fill up the niches left empty after
the extinction of the ‘previous’ taxon. In this kind of scenario, extant taxa of liverworts, mosses, and ferns, are
considered to be relicts of previous radiations [14]. An
alternative scenario suggests a coincidence between
diversification events in each of the extant land plant
lineages instead of a ‘continuous replacement’ idea. In
this case, the majority of extant diversity is either the
result of recent radiation events or of a long accumulation of species diversity throughout a taxon’s history [14].
External factors, such as the break-up of continents and
climate fluctuations, are prominent factors influencing
the branching of the tree of life.

In this study we ask two questions: (1) Do we find evidence for non-constant rate of diversification in land
plants? (2) Are major shifts of diversification rates, if any,
correlated with some major external factors such as global
climate warming or cooling?

Results
We inferred the divergence times of over 98% of all
families of land plants in a single phylogenetic analysis
based on multiple genes from two genomes (Additional
file 1; TreeBase study ID S11106). The topology and divergence times retrieved from the various analyses are
broadly congruent with previous studies with limited sampling [15-17]. All major lineages of land plants as well as
the relationships among them were supported (bootstrap
support > 74%) being mosses (62%), lycophytes as sister to
seed plants (68%) and hornworts as sister to mosses (47%)
the clades with lowest bootstrap values (TreeBase study
ID S11106). This topology is congruent with the analysis
using the three most complete markers (18S, rbcL and
atpB; 6.3% missing data).
The tree was calibrated using multiple fossils. In one of
the calibration procedures, we also constrained the age of
angiosperms to a maximum of 130 Ma following Brenner
[18] (hereafter the constrained tree). The estimated
crown age of land plants was 544.7 Ma (confidence interval [C.I.] = 563.1-536.5) and that of angiosperms was
267.6 Ma (C.I. = 289.9-263.2; Additional file 2; TreeBase
study ID 11106) whereas for the constrained tree we
obtained a crown age for land plants of 510.8 Ma (C.I. =
512.9-475.5).
We produced lineage through time (LTT) plots for
both time estimations, presented in Figure 1. These show
a roughly constant rate of lineage increase (at least for
the family-level studied here), although for angiosperms,
ferns and mosses some acceleration is apparent since the
Cretaceous, while for liverworts and gymnosperms a
slowdown is observed (Figure 1).
A congruent pattern is obtained when we explore the
data applying a high level of background extinction using
a methodology developed by Magallón & Sanderson [19].
Figure 2 shows sizes of the major clades against a 95%
confidence interval of background diversification through
time for land plants as a whole. In recent times, most
clade sizes for mosses (Figure 2C), ferns (Figure 2D) and
angiosperms (Figures 2E &2F, the former being the tree
from a constrained analysis) fall above these confidence
intervals.
Using a topology-based test of diversification [20], a total
of 135 significant rate shifts were identified, with a similar
figure found for the constrained tree (139; Table 1). The
inclusion of 11 families with no DNA data resulted in the
identification of just one more shift in diversification, i.e.
on the branch leading to Balanophoraceae. We then

Page 2 of 10

explored the concordance of these shifts with the major
cool and warm climatic modes [21] and we found some
striking correlations. The majority of shifts in diversification rates in angiosperms, ferns, and mosses coincide with
the last warm climate mode (Table 1). For liverworts, the
highest number of shifts (5) took place in another warm
climate mode (184-252 Ma; Table 1). For gymnosperms,
only one shift in net diversification occurred, but in this
case, during a cool period. This pattern appears to also
hold if we compare the timing of shifts in diversification
rates with the more continuous global temperature change
presented in Scotese [22] (Additional file 3).
Using another diversification test that take into account
branch lengths (i.e., LASER [23]), constant rates of lineage diversification were rejected for all major subclades.
In gymnoperms, the best model was one with a rate shift
occurring ca. 154 Ma, corresponding to a decrease in
diversification during a cool climate mode (Table 2,
Figure 1A). In the other subclades, two-variable rates
were favoured (Table 2, Figure 1A). In angiosperms, two
consecutive slowdowns in diversification were identified
for the current cool climate mode. In liverworts, a similar
pattern was encountered but decreases in rates of diversification occurred firstly in a cool climate mode (ca. 184
Ma) and secondly during a warm climate mode (ca. 99
Ma). In ferns and mosses, we first observe two increases
in diversification during a cool climate mode (ca. 106 and
133 Ma, respectively, Table 2, Figure 1A). Subsequently,
two decreases took place 60 Ma (warm mode) for ferns
and 35 Ma (cool mode) for mosses (Table 2, Figure 1A).
With the constrained tree, the pattern is similar for gymnosperms (Figure 1B, Additional file 4). In the case of
angiosperms and liverworts, only one decrease was
retrieved about 34 (cool mode) and 99 Ma (warm mode)
ago, respectively (Figure 1B, Additional file 4). This pattern is similar to that obtained in the unconstrained tree
for mosses and ferns (Figure 1B, Additional file 4),
although this time fern diversification increases during a
warm mode (ca. 93 Ma) and decreases during a cool
mode (ca. 52 Ma; Figure 1B, Additional file 4).
Finally, diversification test incorporating multiple birth
and death models as implemented in MEDUSA [24]
located 69 diversification rate shifts being the highest
overall net diversification rates for different clades within
angiosperms (Figure 3, Additional file 5). Among land
plants we also found rate shifts leading to high clade-size
in mosses and ferns for individual families and clades
(Figure 3, Additional file 5). On other hand rates among
liverworts and gymnosperms were among the lowest:
their background rate were similar to the overall background rate, and their highest rates were lower than
most rates found for mosses and ferns (see Additional
file 5). Results using the constrained tree were widely
congruent (Additional file 5) and a new rate shift for

Discussion and Conclusion
By combining data for all families of land plants we are
now able to clarify the picture of their evolution through
geological times. Lineages of extant gymnosperms
radiated in the Permian and experienced a decrease in
diversification rate towards the end of the Jurassic (analysis with unconstrained tree) or early Cretaceous (analysis
with constrained tree), during a cool climate mode.
Although their early history may have involved various
lineage replacements associated with the evolution of

new ecosystems [25,26], we found that the slowdown in
diversification of gymnosperms took place in the same
period as liverworts while mosses were diversifying intensely, pointing towards a role of climate in determining
such patterns.
In this study we were also able to evaluate the diversification dynamics of all families of mosses within a phylogenetic framework for the first time. Our analyses
converge to show that the diversification rate of this
group experienced an important acceleration in the Cretaceous, potentially ‘replacing’ the diversity of gymnosperms and liverworts. This occurred during a warm
climate mode when tropical habitats were undergoing

expansion. Significantly, it also corresponds to the origin
of the angiosperms according to Brenner [18], or to the
origin of major groups of angiosperms (asterids, rosids)
as found on our unconstrained analysis and as suggested
by previous studies [27]. In this sense, mosses have diversified at the same period as the one reported for fern as
“the shadow of angiosperms”. It is important to note that
the Cretaceous could be divided in three main intervals
with regards to vegetation and climate: i) “Early” Cretaceous (ca. Berriasian–Barremian) with few angiosperms,
probably no closed canopy angiosperm forests, largely
dry climates at low palaeolatitudes; ii) mid-Cretaceous
(ca. Aptian-Santonian/Campanian), where we observe
the rapid diversification of angiosperms, with presence of
some angiosperm-dominated forests but still no tropical
everwet forests at low palaeolatitudes; and iii) “Late” Cretaceous (ca. Campanian-Maastrichtian), where we see an
early development of angiosperm dominated forests, possibly with everwet forests in low palaeolatitudes of the
Old World, and perhaps also in the New World [14].
This is then followed by iv) the Early Cenozoic, when
temperatures were warm and climate wet–and where
there is strong evidence of widespread tropical-sub-tropical warm wet forests [14]. We found that all six shifts in
diversification for mosses (Table 1) fall within this last
two intervals (i.e. 75, 69, 64, 57, 43 and 37 mya; see
details in Additional files 3), pointing to the importance
of both warm temperatures and wet climate for the rise
of moss diversity.
According to our analyses, mosses were not the only
group to have diversified in the shadow of angiosperms:
ferns have also radiated in a period that coincides with
the rise of angiosperms. Such a pattern, had previously
been reported [28]. Here, we find further support for
this hypothesis of diversification in the shadow of
angiosperms, identifying a significant increase in diversification during the warmest period of the Cretaceous,
and decrease during the coolest period of the Tertiary
(see Figure 1). More specifically, three out of the five
rate shifts (Table 1) fall within interval iii) above of the
Cretaceous, when climate was warm and wet.
Finally, we found that angiosperm diversity has accumulated sharply in recent time (as shown by the LTT
plots), but diversification decreased in the coolest period
of the Tertiary (Figure 1). This is in agreement with the
idea that angiosperms have outcompeted and outnumber gymnosperms and free-sporing plants [29,30]. Subsequently, ferns (especially polypods [28,31]) and mosses
[32] opportunistically diversified in the ecological niches
provided by the angiosperms as the climate became warmer and more humid. In this sense, our study favours
the “successive replacement” of ancestral lineages [14].

Methods
Phylogeny

We put together phylogenetic data for at least one
representative of each of the 706 currently accepted
families of land plants (Additional file 1). Our dataset
was assembled using plastid rbcL, atpB and rps4 genes,
as well as 18S and 26S nuclear ribosomal regions (hereafter 18S rDNA and 26S rDNA). We downloaded
sequences from GenBank when available and filled some
of the gaps by sequencing missing taxa when we were
able to obtain suitable material (Additional file 1). DNA
extraction and PCR amplification used standard protocols and primers for nuclear and plastid genes from
Nickrent and Starr [33] and Cox et al. [34]. We
sequenced the 18S rDNA for 22 angiosperms and 13
mosses, rbcL for two angiosperms, 10 mosses and one
liverwort, and atpB for 39 mosses, two liverworts, one
hornwort, and 18 angiosperms (Additional file 1). In
total we produced a 6,950 base pairs data matrix consisting of 699 families (including four outgroups) with
65% of data presence. Only one gene could be obtained
for 55 of these 699 families (Additional file 1). Streptophytes and Chlorophytes were used as the outgroup.
Due to the large size of the matrix, maximum likelihood analyses were performed in RAxML [35] using
200 bootstrap replicates and GTR+GAMMA model, as
selected by ModelTest [36]. Divergence times were calculated using penalized likelihood in r8s [37] and the
smoothing parameter (smooth = 1000) was calculated
by cross-validation. We calibrated the chronogram with
the age of eudicots at 121 mya, corresponding to the
appearance of the tricolpate pollen grain typical of this
clade [38]. We used a further sixteen calibration points
as minimum constrains, plus a maximum age of 725 Ma
[39] for the root of the tree (Marchantiopsida, Monilophytes, Mosses, Seed plants, Annonaceae, Calycanthaceae, Hedyosmum, Lauraceae, Magnoliaceae, Meliosma,
Menispermaceae, Nelumbaceae, Nymphaceae, Platanaceae, Trochodendron, Winteraceae, Additional file 6).
Confidence intervals (C.I.) for divergences times were
calculated by repeating the dating procedures in r8s
using 100 bootstrapped matrices produced in RAxML
[35]. The dating procedure was repeated constraining
the age of angiosperms to a maximum of 130 Ma following Brenner [18], i.e. “constrained tree”.
Diversification tests

We examined diversification through time using several
methods.
Firstly, we plotted the number of lineages through
time (hereafter LTT plots) for each major subclade of
land plants using the APE 1.8 package [40].

Fiz-Palacios et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:341
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/341

Secondly, to take into account extinction rates we
used the approach of Magallón and Sanderson [19]. For
time intervals of one million year, we calculated net
diversification rates under a relative high level of background extinction (0.9 using equation 10 of Magallón
and Sanderson [19].
Thirdly, we applied a topological-based test of diversification. Diversification rate shifts were calculated using
the Δ1 statistics of Moore et al. [20] as implemented by
Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. [41] in ApTreeshape [42] using
0.05 significance level as the cut-off point. This test uses
the tree but also takes into account the total number of
species per family (Table 1).
Fourthly, we used a test of diversification that takes into
account branch lengths, i.e. the elapsed time between the
nodes of the family-level tree, LASER [23]. Using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), LASER can compare
models with various rates of diversifications (yule model
with rates r) against the null expectation of a constant rate
(birth-death model with no extinction). LASER also allows
to identify at which points in time a given rate shift
occurred (ts). LASER was applied to all major subclades.
Fifthly, we tested for multiple shifts in birth and death
rates using a stepwise approach implemented in MEDUSA
until improvement in AIC score was < 4 [24]. Net diversification rates together with relative extinction rates and
AIC improvements were retrieved (Additional file 5).
Also, to comply with other phylogenetic analyses that
have combined more genes but for fewer taxa, we also
re-ran the analyses above with the following two modifications. First 11 families for which we could not obtain
any DNA data (i.e., five families of liverworts, three of
mosses, and three of angiosperms; Additional file 1)
were placed in the DNA-based phylogenetic tree using
taxonomic information following Crosby et al. [8], Buck
and Goffinet [9], Stevens [13], Heinrichs et al. [7] and
Smith et al. [11] (see Additional file 2). Although this
procedure is suboptimal, it allowed us to perform diversification tests on a complete-family level tree. Second
we enforced hornworts and lycophytes to be sister to
vascular plants [15,16] plus we set the maximum age for
angiosperms to 130 Ma (following Brenner [18]; our
“constrained tree”). Results were compared for the constrained vs. unconstrained topologies. Finally, we compared these diversification profiles and metrics against
the distribution of the climate modes of the Panerozoic
following Frakes et al. [21], as well as the global temperature model of Scotese [22].

[24]. Numbers on the first column correspond to the net diversification
rate from highest to lowest and are depicted on Figure 3. Nonangiosperms cases are highlighted in bold, followed by the name of the
group they belong to in brackets. “r” are the estimates for net
diversification rate, “e” are estimates for relative extinction rate, “ΔAIC” is
the increase on the stepwise AIC procedure and “ΔAICc” is the increase
when corrected for small sample size [24]. Results for the constrained
tree are presented at the bottom.
