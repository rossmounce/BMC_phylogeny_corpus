Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are human intestinal pathogens of global importance.
Zoonotic transmission from livestock animals or animal-derived food is the likely cause for most of these infections.
However, little is known about their general and host-specific mechanisms of colonization, or virulence and
pathogenicity factors. In certain hosts, Campylobacter species colonize persistently and do not cause disease, while
they cause acute intestinal disease in humans.
Results: Here, we investigate putative host-specificity using phenotypic characterization and genome-wide analysis of
genetically closely related C. jejuni strains from different sources. A collection of 473 fresh Campylobacter isolates from
Germany was assembled between 2006 and 2010 and characterized using MLST. A subset of closely related C. jejuni
strains of the highly prevalent sequence type ST-21 was selected from different hosts and isolation sources. PCR typing
of strain-variable genes provided evidence that some genes differed between these strains. Furthermore, phenotypic
variation of these strains was tested using the following criteria: metabolic variation, protein expression patterns, and
eukaryotic cell interaction. The results demonstrated remarkable phenotypic diversity within the ST-21 group, which
however did not correlate with isolation source. Whole genome sequencing was performed for five ST-21 strains from
chicken, human, bovine, and food sources, in order to gain insight into ST-21 genome diversity. The comparisons
showed extensive genomic diversity, primarily due to recombination and gain of phage-related genes. By contrast, no
genomic features associated with isolation source or host were identified.
Conclusions: The genome information and phenotypic data obtained in vitro and in a chicken infection model
provided little evidence of fixed adaptation to a specific host. Instead, the dominant C. jejuni ST-21 appeared to be
characterized by phenotypic flexibility and high genetic microdiversity, revealing properties of a generalist. High
genetic flexibility might allow generalist variants of C. jejuni to reversibly express diverse fitness factors in changing
environments.

Background
Intestinal infections by Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are, jointly with Salmonella enterica infections, the most frequent bacterial causes of diarrheal
diseases of humans worldwide [1]. C. jejuni causes the

majority (> 83%) of human symptomatic Campylobacter
infections [2]. Campylobacter ssp. are transmitted mainly
by contaminated food of animal origin [3-8]. Animals are
frequently infected persistently with Campylobacters and,
in most cases, show no symptoms, contrary to the acute
and self-limiting intestinal infection caused in humans.
The cause of these discrepant outcomes of infection in
different hosts is not clear, although previous work has
suggested that host as well as bacterial factors may

contribute [9-13]. Numerous C. coli and C. jejuni subtypes with similar morphology and biochemistry are
found in different mammalian and bird hosts, with the
possibility of zoonotic transmission to humans. In addition, Campylobacter species display extensive intraspecies
variation. These properties require sophisticated molecular typing methods in order to differentiate species and
subtypes, and to elucidate infection sources. Multi Locus
Sequence Typing (MLST) analyses have proven to be a
molecular method of choice and previously have provided clear evidence that genetically related strains of
either C. jejuni or C. coli can colonize different hosts
[13-19]. These strains frequently are part of large clonal
complexes, whose members share most of the MLST
alleles. However, MLST studies rely solely on the analysis
of seven housekeeping genes, belonging to the core genome [16], and disregard the rest of the ~1.7 Mb genome
[20], which includes virulence-associated genes as well as
possible strain-specific genes or gene variants. Thus, the
question remains open, whether different strain subtypes
infecting humans differ from animal-colonizing and
food-associated types within one closely related genetic
grouping (such as an MLST sequence type).
Little is known about the mechanisms of host-specific
colonization, virulence and pathogenicity factors of Campylobacter species. With few exceptions [21,22], genome
sequences currently available in databases for Campylobacter species (see: NCBI “Microbial Genomes”; http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes; [23,24]) have been
derived from human isolates, therefore genome information about strains from other sources is still scarce. In
order to complement these recent advances, it may be
relevant to gather more information about host association and animal-associated strains and subtypes, some of
which may be more prone to be transmitted or cause
severe complications during human infections. Prophylactic measures are required to prevent transmission
from food and animals to humans, which also require a
better knowledge of strain-to-strain variability and adaptation potential to different hosts and environments such
as food. This study was designed to characterize the
genetic relationships and population structure of C. jejuni
and C. coli currently prevalent in humans, domestic animals and food sources in Germany. Furthermore, a major
aim was to establish the extent of diversity within dominant phylogenetic groups of C. jejuni from this collection,
which are present in diverse hosts, such as ST-21, with
regard to their different sources.
To that end, we collected 473 C. jejuni and C. coli isolates from humans, as well as animal (poultry, porcine,
bovine), food, and environmental isolates between 2006
and 2010 in Germany. MLST analysis and extensive
molecular typing of the isolates was performed, which
confirmed C. jejuni ST-21 as one of the dominant

“generalist” variants occurring in all sources. Further
phenotypic characterization and whole genome analyses
of closely related ST-21 C. jejuni strains from different
sources provided little evidence for host or source-associated traits. Nevertheless, ST-21 isolates from different
sources displayed a high genomic and phenotypic diversity and flexibility. Domestic circulating C. jejuni STs
such as ST-21 appear to use mechanisms such as interstrain recombination, metabolic and surface-associated
genetic modules and contingency genes to permit a generalist lifestyle and the flexible expression of fitness factors in diverse environments.

Results
Multi Locus Sequence Typing of C. coli and C. jejuni
isolates from diverse isolation sources in humans, animals
and food sources

We collected 473 Campylobacter strains (173 C. coli and
300 C. jejuni) from animal hosts (chicken, pigs, cattle, wild
birds, monkeys, pet animals), human patients, and food
sources over a five-year period (2006 to 2010) in several
geographically separate centers in Germany. Human
patient samples were collected in three university hospitals
(Hannover, Munich, Muenster); the majority of nonpatient isolates were from domestic animals and food samples, while few strains originated from wild-living animals.
Molecular typing of the whole strain collection was performed by MLST [15,25]. 197 different sequence types
(STs; 112 for C. jejuni and 85 for C. coli) were identified,
of which 57 were new STs not previously represented in
the PubMLST database. These new STs include 37 that
are novel combinations of previously known alleles, and
20 that included 19 novel alleles (further statistics, including separate analyses for C. coli and C. jejuni, in Table 1).
The ST distribution was highly diverse, with 121 STs
occurring only once, and the ten most common STs comprising only 43.7% and 48.0% of isolates for C. jejuni and
C. coli, respectively. Of the 76 STs represented more than
once, 22 were found in humans and, in addition, in either
animals or food or in both of the latter, suggesting a host
range consistent with zoonotic potential. All STs contained either only C. jejuni or C. coli strains. Only two
alleles were found to occur in both species, pgm188, present in 4 C. coli and 2 C. jejuni strains, and uncA17, a very
common allele present in 131 C. coli and 7 C. jejuni
strains. Minimal spanning trees were generated from the
MLST data illustrating the phylogenetic relationships of
the strains (Figure 1). In confirmation and extension of
previous results, MLST revealed dominant sequence types
within the strains (Figure 1 and Additional File 1: Table
S1). The dominant sequence types in the FBI-Zoo collection partially overlapped with dominant sequence types
reported for Campylobacter samplings in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the U.S., Canada, Denmark and

suggests that Campylobacter sequence types prevalent in

many geographic areas of the world represent similar
dominant strain types and clonal complexes. The five
most dominant MLST sequence types for C. jejuni in the

Spanning Tree analysis-methods). A) Minimal spanning tree generated from MLST comparisons of all Campylobacter strains from the
collection (Methods). B) Minimal spanning tree of C. coli strains. C) Minimal spanning tree of C. jejuni strains. Each circle represents one sequence
type (all ST numbers indicated in B and C). In A), only dominant STs are indicated by numbers. Circles of increased diameter represent higher
strain numbers within one ST. Different colours indicate strain source: blue-human; red-food; green-animal. The connecting lines between STs
depict the number of allelic differences between them: one allele difference (black bold lines); two alleles difference (grey bold lines [A] or thin
lines [B, C]); three alleles difference (grey hatched lines); more than three alleles difference (grey dotted lines). The phylogenetic group on the
left of ST-61 represents all C. coli isolates, the phylogenetic tree expanding to the right of ST-61 comprises the C. jejuni strains. Clonal groupings
(maximum two allele difference between neigbouring STs) in A) are indicated by colored shading around the circles and dominant STs within
important groupings are designated with their respective ST numbers. The shading of clonal groupings is colored according to the majority
isolation source. Grey shading indicates no predominance of source within the clonal groupings.

ST-1628. Many common MLST types, such as ST-21, ST45, ST-48, were distributed rather evenly between strains
isolated from domestic animal, human and food sources
(Figure 1, Table 1). Some, mostly rarer, strain types were
only found either in animals, food sources or in humans.
C. coli strains were more closely related to each other than
the C. jejuni strains (Figure 1), in concordance with previous studies [26,27].
The standardized Index of Association, (sIA) [28], was
calculated for the complete set of allelic profiles and separately for C. coli and C. jejuni strains, respectively. sIA was
0.45 for the complete dataset and the C. jejuni dataset,
indicating a limited amount of recombination not sufficient to completely destroy linkage between alleles. By
contrast, the sIA for the C. coli dataset was 0.07, a value
close to the expected value for linkage equilibrium (free
recombination).
Extended genetic pathotyping of Campylobacter jejuni

Due to the restriction of the Campylobacter MLST system
to seven housekeeping genes, potential host-specific genes,
genes providing strain-specific means of enhanced survival
and transmission, or predictive markers for infection-associated severe disease may only be detected by looking at
an enhanced set of proposed virulence genes, or at the
complete genomes of strains. We therefore selected a subgroup of C. jejuni strains (91 strains; Additional File 2:
Table S2) from the FBI-Zoo collection that contained
representative isolates of all dominant MLST sequence
types, and included strains from all major available isolation sources (human, diverse animals, food materials) for
all dominant STs. Each strain in this subset was subjected
to PCR-based typing to detect the presence or absence of
a panel of 18 genes previously proposed to be involved in
pathogenesis, metabolism or host specificity (Additional
File 2: Table S2). Three additional genes were included for
the typing of 55 C. jejuni strains belonging to ten different
STs (Figure 2). A few tested genes were present in all
strains, such as Cj0977, flaC, flaA, cadF, pglB, and flpA
(proposed adhesin [29]). Most of the tested genes were
only detectable in a subset of the strains, including ggt
(gamma-glytamyl-transpeptidase), secreted ansB (asparaginase), dmsA, cdtB, fucP, ciaB, capA (presumed adhesin
[29]) and neuC1 (sialyltransferase) genes [12,30-32]. Both
the ggt gene and the secreted ansB (ansBs) allelic variant
were previously proposed to provide niche or host specificity [12,31]. Interestingly, the proportion of strains possessing ggt or ansBs genes was overall very low in our strain
collection (< 8%). In addition, in isogenic MLST groups
containing strains from all three major isolation sources
(human, food, animal), the presence of the neuC1, ggt or
ansBs genes did not correlate with isolation source. Nor
did the presence of any other gene in the pathotyping
matrix (Figure 2; Additional File 2: Table S2) correlate

Page 5 of 21

with isolation source. However, close correlation with
MLST type was detected for the proposed virulence genes
fspA1 and fspA2 [33], except for ST-21, suggesting that
these gene types are usually coinherited in phylogenetically
closely related strain subtypes. This result corroborates
recent data for fspA1 obtained from Finnish strains [34].
Overall, taking into account phylogenetic relatedness of
strains within ST groups, no correlation of presence of
individual genes with the isolation source was observed.
Additional genes involved in metabolic functions and iron
uptake (exbB1, ceuB-E, crfA) were tested for presence or
absence in a subset of the 91 strains from different STs
and isolation sources and did not show a host-specific distribution (not depicted). For some of the genes which
were present in all or most strains (cdtB, flaC, flaA, ciaB)
and some non-ubiquitous genes (neuC1, dmsA, tlp7, ggt,
fspA1, fspA2), we performed sequencing of the genes on a
subset of PCR-typed strains (60 strains from 39 MLST
sequence types; asterisks in Figure 2). Sequence diversity
between the strains was found in these genes to a different
extent (data not shown). In summary, none of the tested
genes or allelic variants taken singly or in combination
were correlated with isolation source.
Evidence of phenotypic differences between
C. jejuni ST-21 strains from different sources

The data described above suggested that the identification
of any genes, gene variants or traits potentially providing
host specificity to C. jejuni might require more sophisticated methodological approaches. We therefore decided to
perform in-depth investigations of the phenotypic and
genetic traits of eight selected C. jejuni strains from one
single exemplary MLST sequence type (ST-21), a common
and dominant ST worldwide. The selected ST-21 strains
(xy259, A588, RB922, RB923, 6399, 7731, 04197, 04199;
Figure 2) were isolated from human patients, domestic
animals (cattle, chicken) and food sources; PCR typing of
strain-variable genes (Figure 2) had provided evidence that
some genes differed between these strains. This prompted
us to first address the question whether these strains show
any other phenotypic variation which would warrant
further characterization with regard to the diversification
of closely related strains. We tested the phenotypic variation of these strains using the following criteria: metabolic
variation (Biolog PM1 plate, testing a panel of carbon-providing substrates including sugars and some amino acids;
Additional File 2: Table S3), energy harvest, motility, morphology, protein expression patterns and cell interaction.
Some of the experiments were performed at 42°C and at
37°C. All of these freshly isolated strains possessed very
high motility except for the milk-derived strain 6399. The
bacterial morphology in transmission electron microscopy
was very similar. Cell interaction of the strains was comparatively tested in adherence assays with the human

Figure 2 Pathotyping scheme of 55 C. jejuni strains ordered according to STs. Each of ten groups represents one ST and contains at least
one strain from human, one strain from animal and one strain from food sources. The distribution of putative virulence- and host-associated
genes was tested by PCR (primer combinations in Table 2). The presence of genes Cj1305 and Cj1306 was detected using a combination of
primers in Cj1303 and Cj1307, by PCR product length: 1 indicates the presence of just one gene, either Cj1305 or Cj1306, and 2 indicates the
presence of both genes. Color-coding: green: gene present; red: gene not present; yellow: weak PCR product; white: not tested. Gene copies
marked by asterisks were additionally sequenced to identify interstrain polymorphisms using Sanger sequencing.

intestinal epithelial cell line CaCo2, the chicken macrophage-like cell line HD-11, the IPEC-J2 swine intestinal
epithelial cell line (Figure 3) and human epithelial HeLa
cells (not shown). In addition, proinflammatory cytokine
production (data not shown) and cell activation were
tested for eight ST-21 strains on the same cell lines containing an NF-kB-driven luciferase reporter (Figure 4).
The tested ST-21 strains showed differences in cell adherence, cytokine production and NF-kB activation (Figure 3;
Figure 4), indicating bacterial phenotypic differences.
Next, we used rabbit-derived and chicken sera reactive
against C. jejuni in order to compare the patterns of
immunogenic proteins between different strains of the
same sequence type in Western blots. Differential protein
patterns were detected in closely related strains when cultivated at both 37°C and 42°C (data not shown). Likewise,
MLST-isogenic strains differed in their metabolic properties and energy harvest as determined by Biolog analysis
and intrabacterial ATP levels of eight ST-21 strains (Figure
5A, C, Additional File 2: Table S3). Interestingly, using the

Biolog characteristics, the group ST-21 strains could be largely subdivided into two phenotypic variants with characteristic patterns of properties. These two variants (biotype
1 and biotype 2) were represented with equal frequency in
the eight strains (two strains each from human, chicken,
bovine and milk sources) tested by Biolog, and did not
show any correlation to a specific host or source. The common characteristics of half of these strains (biotype 2) were
the metabolic use of three specific glycyl-L-dipeptides
(glycyl-L-glutamic acid, glycyl-L-aspartic acid, glycyl-L-proline), L-galactonic acid g-lactone, tyramine, m/p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (Figure 5A, Additional File 2: Table S3),
while the biotype 1 strains did not use those. These metabolic trait differences had not been described before for
closely related C. jejuni strains. These results were very
reproducible and not temperature-dependent (expressed
by the respective strains at both 37°C and 42°C). When
nine additional strains from other STs (human sources
only, Figure 5A; Additional File 2: Table S3) were tested in
the same Biolog system, distinct metabolic fingerprints

strains also displayed increased electron chain activity with
one hexose sugar (D-mannose) and one phosphate sugar
(D-fructose-6-phosphate). In summary, these results provided clear evidence for phenotypic differences between
ST-21 strains, with no indication of host specificity.

strains (left panel) from different sources (h = human; ch = chicken; b = bovine; f = food) and nine human-derived strains (from left to right:
xy898, R267, xy904, A396, 222, 02551, 02557, A412 and A599) of different STs (right panel) were tested at 42°C using BioLog Phenotype
Microarray PM1 plates (area values). Grey color indicates no or only weak substrate utilization for all strains (all area values below 800) and green
indicates high substrate utilization for all strains (all area values above 800). The colors pink, yellow, beige and blue indicate strain-specific
utilization: pink-zero utilization, beige-< 1,000, yellow-< 9,000, blue-> 9,000. The six bordered rectangles on the left panel (from top to bottom,
second from left column) indicate the substrates L-galactonic acid-g-lactone, tyramine, m-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid, p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid,
glycyl-L-aspartic acid, glycyl-L-glutamic acid and glycyl-L-proline, which are not used by some strains (phenotypic variant 1). PM1 experiments
with ST-21 strains were performed at least three times independently on different days. Shown for each substrate are the mean area values of
three independent experiments performed at 42°C for 30 h incubation time. PM1 experiments for other STs were performed either once or
twice (mean values shown for ST-45 and ST-267 strains) at 42°C. (B) Differences in intracellular ATP levels (energy harvest) of eight ST-21 strains

(strains: xy259, RB922, 6399, 04197, 04199; see Additional File 2: Table S4 for genome statistics). This
approach was also aimed at answering the question,
whether the observed phenotypic diversity was due to

unique genomic events which could not be identified
with pathotyping of known genes, and whether it was
somehow correlated with association to a specific host.
The genome sequences revealed relatively little variation

in gene content (macrodiversity; Figure 6; Additional
File 2: Table S5) but a high level of polymorphism
within shared genes, contingency genes and intergenic
regions (Figure 7). Those included single nucleotide
(SNP) and clustered nucleotide polymorphisms (CNP)
(Additional File 2: Figure S4 and Table S6). Sequence
length differences were mostly found in intergenic
regions (Additional File 2: Table S8). Four of the five
sequenced strains had acquired phage gene clusters (Figure 6; Additional File 2: Tables S5, S9). Four selected
phage genes were tested by specific PCR for their presence in a wider array of ST-21 strains and found to
represent single events (Additional File 2: Table S9),
uncorrelated with any host or source. The human isolate
xy259 possessed a deletion in a gene responsible for surface or flagellar glycosylation (gene 617 family, gene
Cj1305-like; Figure 6), which was not found in other
human strains. The bovine strain 04197 lacked the gene
equivalent to Cj0008 (gene designation of strain 11168),
which is a gene of unknown function in a metabolic
gene cluster relating to a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide
oxidoreductase. The allelic diversity between the strains
comprised a large number of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in coding regions
(Additional File 2: Table S6), many of which originated
from homologous recombination, and some deletions
and insertions in both coding and intergenic regions of
all strains (Additional File 2: Table S8). Repeat length
differences probably originating from slipped strand

mispairing mutagenesis were evident in all strains. This
concerned eight genes of the glycosylation gene clusters
leading to frameshifts in coding regions. We confirmed
these repeat length differences in a larger number of
ST-21 strains using Sanger sequencing (Additional File
2: Table S7). By this extended sequence determination,
the repeat length differences obtained by 454 sequencing
were confirmed, but none of the tested nucleotide polymorphisms was stably associated with the source of the
strain. Only a limited number of single nucleotide polymorphisms and repeat differences could be investigated
by this labour-intensive approach. Aligning the five genome sequences (Methods; Figure 7, Additional File 3:
Table S10) revealed features of genome plasticity in C.
jejuni, with a highly conserved overall synteny of the
genomes. We detected that frequent homologous
recombination events had happened since the divergence of the genomes from a common ancestor (Figure
7, Additional File 2: Table S6, Additional File 3: Table
S10), with an average imported length of 1437 bp (maximum length of CNP up to ~ 15 kbp). The genome
regions containing clustered polymorphisms caused by
recombination are summarized for all five ST-21 genomes in Additional File 2: Table S6. They contain genes
of various functional categories (according to the COG
classification). None of the functional categories showed
significantly higher percentages for having undergone
recombination than the average of all functional categories (Additional File 2: Figure S3). When the ST-21

alignments) was used as a reference genome.

genomes were aligned to previously sequenced C. jejuni
genomes from unrelated phylogenetic groups (e.g. of
strains RM1221 [22] and 81 176 [30]) in addition to
nucleotide polymorphisms, notable differences in gene
content were observed (mainly genes involved in metabolism, glycosylation, and restriction-modification genes;
not shown).
Correlating phenotypic variation with genetic differences
in ST-21 strains

Both genotypic and phenotypic differences were observed
for ST-21 and other C. jejuni strains, and the genotypic differences might be a basis for a potential adaptive phenotype. From the Biolog assays, there was no evidence for a
correlation of the two different metabolic biotypes within
ST-21 with any specific source. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile investigating the gene variants potentially providing
phenotypic differences, including those of metabolic capacities detected in the Biolog assay. We next asked if genetic
polymorphisms within ST-21 that had been identified by
the genome sequence analysis could be correlated with the
metabolic biotypes. As already described previously, strains
of the ST-21 lineage are able to use fucose, due to the presence of a genomic island [35,36]. As a proof of concept,
use of fucose was confirmed for all tested ST-21 strains
(which possess the fucose island in their complete genome
sequences) using the Biolog system (Figure 5A). Within
the other tested STs, ST-45 and ST-267 did not display
fucose utilization, as expected from previous studies [35].
One of the ST-21 strains selected for whole genome
sequencing, the bovine isolate 04199, belonged to metabolic biotype 1 and did not metabolize the three dipeptides,
tyramine, and m/p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid. Although
several genetic polymorphisms found in the 04199 genome
were investigated in all ST-21 strains belonging to biotype
1, and compared with the corresponding loci of biotype 2
strains, a specific genetic variant which could be responsible for the metabolic phenotype was not identified. Several
genes and intergenic regions of potential relevance for
metabolic activities varied between ST-21 strains (mostly
sequence polymorphisms or small insertions/deletions; see
also Additional File 2: Tables S6, S8). These included two
peptidase genes [Cj0805-like, Cj0703-like], msrA [methionine sulfoxide reductase subunit], cmeB [efflux pump subunit] (both genes contain polymorphisms in strain 04199),
sdhA [novel type fumarate dehydrogenase subunit; [37]],
frdA [fumarate dehydrogenase subunit], dcuB [C4-dicarboxylate transporter] (three genes contain polymorphisms
in strain RB922), ansB [asparaginase], and argS [arginyltRNA synthetase] (the latter gene distinct in strain 6399).
These allelic or intergenic differences were resequenced or
tested with allele-specific primers for further isolates of ST21 and other STs from various sources. None of them
could be affirmed to be source-associated or related to

Page 11 of 21

metabolic biotype for carbon sources. In addition, RNAbased real time PCR was performed for six ST-21 strains
(five of which were the genome-sequenced isolates), two of
biotype 1 and three of biotype 2 (04199 [1], A588 [1],
xy259, 6399, RB922, 04197), to elucidate whether genes
were differentially transcribed, in particular genes of global
regulators. These analyses yielded clear differences in transcript abundance between the strains (for rpoN, flgR and
luxS regulators) which were uncorrelated with metabolic
biotype or source (not shown). Most conspicuously, strain
6399 (milk isolate) appeared to have a largely reduced
rpoN transcript amount, which also seemed to negatively
affect luxS transcript, and matched the low observed in
vitro motility of this strain.
Chicken colonization by two genetically closely related
ST-21 C. jejuni strains from human and chicken

Chicken colonization studies have helped previously to
determine whether certain C. jejuni variants were infection-competent, including studies that tested strains with
presumed adaptation to other hosts that were no longer
able to infect chickens [21]. We infected three weeks-old
white leghorn chicks with two of the genome-sequenced
closely related ST-21 strains, xy259 (human) and RB922
(chicken). All inoculated animals were colonized by both
test strains, which had been verified in advance to possess
full motility, since motility is a major prerequisite for successful colonization of campylobacters in any host and
subject to strong phase variation mechanisms [38]. During
the two-weeks’ infection period, the chicken-derived strain
colonized chickens slightly better (up to one log higher
bacterial loads per animal) than the human-derived strain
(Figure 8). However, the human strain was fully competent
to colonize all animals persistently.

Discussion
In order to curb the high numbers of human Campylobacter infections, zoonotic transmission to humans needs to
be reduced. Hence, the identification of specific groups of
strains or strain properties which are associated with the
colonization of humans or specific animals may help to
provide targets for such measures. In the present study, an
in-depth genetic and phenotypic characterization of a
diverse array of Campylobacter strains was initiated,
including in particular closely genetically related strains of
ST-21 isolated from diverse habitats and isolation sources.
From 2006 to 2010, Campylobacter isolates were collected in the framework of the FBI-Zoo network from
humans, diverse animals and food sources in Germany.
The complete collection of 473 strains was subjected to
MLST analysis, making this one of the most comprehensive MLST analyses of Campylobacter from one country
outside of the UK. Approximately one third of C. jejuni
and one fourth of C. coli isolates belonged to five dominant

Figure 8 Chicken colonization of human-derived and chicken-derived C. jejuni ST-21 isolates. Real time PCR was performed on DNA
isolated from caecal tissue of chickens after 14 d of infection (methods). Colony-forming units per g caecum were calculated from standardized
bacterial DNA samples equivalent to a specific number of bacteria. White bars indicate chicks infected with human-derived strain xy259 (animals
designated xy259 ch1 to ch5); grey bars indicate chicks inoculated with chicken-derived strain RB922 (animals RB922 ch1 to ch5).

STs, each representing at least 3% of the isolates. Many
dominant STs are also very prevalent in other geographical
regions (e.g. C. jejuni STs 45, 48, 50, 21, 267; see also Additional File 2: Figure S2); as in other European regions, ST574, which is prevalent in New Zealand (http://PubMLST.
org), was not identified in Germany. For C. jejuni, strains
of all dominant STs were isolated from both humans and
animals/food samples, indicating a broad host range and
zoonotic potential. In contrast, approximately two thirds of
C. jejuni strains were very diverse and represent rare STs,
so that the low number of isolates per ST made it impossible to draw valid conclusions about their host association.
These and previous data suggest that all dominant STs
found in a variety of sources have a “generalist” phenotype,
enabling them to colonize both humans and domestic animals. From these hosts, they can then be transmitted to
humans either directly or via food. A previous whole genome-based study including 95 strains [16] suggested, that a
host-specific Campylobacter subtype, or host-specific Campylobacter genes, may not exist, particularly in the dominant MLST sequence types, which are mainly derived from
domestic sources that may have evolved under conditions
of ample recent admixture [26]. This does not rule out that
some of the rarer sequence types, such as isolates from
wild animals which rarely mix with other niches, have irreversibly adapted to a single host species. Evidence for fixed
host adaptation in a rare ST has been provided recently for
sequence type ST-3704 [21,39], a C. jejuni variant from
bank voles, which failed to colonize chickens. While strong
evidence of admixture between C. coli and C. jejuni has
been presented before [26], and is supported by the existence of alleles occurring in both C. jejuni and C. coli, the

overall frequency of such shared alleles was very low in our
collection (see also Additional File 1: Figure S1). Calculations of the standardized index of association and other
tests for recombination were in agreement with previous
studies demonstrating an important role of recombination
in shaping the population structure of Campylobacter species. Notably, the sIA of C. coli was much lower than that
of C. jejuni, suggesting more efficient exchange of alleles
between C. coli strains than C. jejuni strains.
C. jejuni and C. coli have been shown to be versatile and
diverse species, harbouring numerous genes related to
host interactions or metabolism that are not present in all
strains, or are subject to phase variation [20,30,40-42]. We
have performed an extensive analysis of such genes in a
large subset of our collection, and additional reference isolates. 91 C. jejuni strains were studied for the absence/presence and sequence variability of 18 genes with putative
roles in phenotypes relevant to host interaction. These
included genes coding for surface proteins, LOS, protein
glycosylation and metabolic functions which have been
suggested to play an important part in niche- or host-associated colonization abilities [43,44,31,45].
The present data have not provided evidence that any of
the genes tested was robustly associated with isolation
source. By contrast, pathotyping profiles were in many
cases closely correlated with phylogenetic grouping by
sequence types, suggesting that Campylobacter have diversified their complements of in vivo essential genes. Apparently, the host interaction gene complement of dominant
STs was selected to provide equal fitness advantages in
both domestic ("food”) animals and humans, permitting
strain circulation between humans and domestic animals,

Gripp et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/584

making them “generalists”. These generalist strains could
then make use of different genetic features including
reversible frame-shifting of contingency genes, intra-genomic and inter-genomic recombination to fine-tune their
genetic and phenotypic capacities, which may benefit their
survival in individual hosts or changing environments
without preventing their generalist adaptation potential.
ST-21 is one of the most prevalent sequence types of
C. jejuni present in a broad range of hosts [14,15,
17-19,46]. We have selected ST-21 to analyze the genetic
and phenotypic diversity of C. jejuni within a group of closely related isolates, which appear to have generalist properties with respect to domestic hosts. Phenotypic
characterization and metabolic profiling was performed
for eight ST-21 isolates from different sources (two strains
each from human, chicken, bovine and milk sources), and
the genomes of five of these strains were sequenced. Metabolic profiling identified two characteristic biotypes within
ST-21, with distinctive differences in their ability to metabolize certain carbon sources, including some dipeptides.
Similar to the pathotyping results, none of these biotypes
was associated with a specific isolation source, suggesting
that both biotypes are compatible with a generalist lifestyle. In addition to differences in their metabolic capacities, the same strains also showed phenotypic diversity in
their interaction with eukaryotic cells, independently of
their isolation source. A further nine human C. jejuni
strains from other rare and frequent STs (all isolated from
humans) that were compared using the Biolog system
showed metabolic fingerprints distinct from each other
and also different from all ST-21 strains, revealing the
metabolic fingerprint as a distinctive feature between and
even within phylogenetic subtypes of the species. However,
our study did not provide any evidence for a common
metabolic fingerprint of human-derived strains.
The genome analysis of five ST-21 strains confirmed
their high genetic relatedness, with long stretches of complete sequence identity and generally conserved synteny.
However, pairwise and multiple comparisons of all
sequences provided evidence of recombination that has
caused the exchange of chromosome fragments of varying
length, up to ~15 kbp. These genome mosaicisms are reminiscent of the situation in the human gastric pathogen
Helicobacter pylori, where genome comparisons of sequentially isolated strains from one single individual have
yielded very similar mosaic patterns [47] to the ones
observed here. In particular, the average length of imported
fragments in the ST-21 genomes was 1,437 bp, between
two and six times more than a previous estimate based on
MLST data only [48], which could reflect the fact that
MLST genes are under strong purifying selection [49]. The
import length is about 3-4 times longer than the average
length of imports calculated from H. pylori genome comparisons (394 bp, [47]) with the same analytical model.

Mutation and recombination were estimated to have
occurred at similar rates, but recombination introduced
21.5 times more polymorphisms than mutation as it often
substitutes several sites simultaneously [50]. Despite the
strong evidence for recombination, the gene content in the
five ST-21 genomes was very highly conserved. Only few
strain-specific or unique genes were identified, most of
which were part of phage gene clusters. These phage acquisitions represented almost the entire set of gene content
differences between the sequenced ST-21 strains. Some
phage genes were so far unknown; three of the phages
(phage clusters 1, 2 and 7) were similar to previously
described Campylobacter phages (CJIE1, CJIE3, CJIE4
families; [23,22,51,52]. The acquisition of some strain-specific genes appeared to be unique events and not related to
the strain source or host. Yet, these closely related strains
with identical MLST sequence types displayed substantial
polymorphism ([20]; and Additional File 2: Table S7), largely caused by extensive inter-strain recombination and
contingency genes. This corroborated earlier results from
microarray comparisons which claimed that C. jejuni
strains possess a high level of genome diversity, even within
a single sequence type [53,54]. Extended testing for variant
alleles of certain candidate genes in other dominant or rare
STs or in specific groups of strains from specific host or
source did not reveal any fixed host relation. Some of these
variants may indicate a pressure for phenotypic diversification, for example due to bacteriophage resistance, or might
still affect fitness in specific hosts or under certain colonization conditions. We propose that the observed microdiversity may allow these bacteria to flexibly and reversibly
adapt to diverse habitats and to propagate their generalist
phenotypes. Experimental infection of two genomesequenced ST-21 strains in chickens revealed that a ST-21
strain isolated from a human was fully competent to colonize chickens, albeit to a slightly lower density than a
chicken isolate inoculated in a parallel experiment. This
suggests that no general colonization barrier for humanderived ST-21 strains exists in chicken. Extensive genetic
analyses of 95 whole genomes of C. coli and C. jejuni (43
C. jejuni genomes) have recently revealed that genetically
distantly related isolates show considerable variability in
gene content [16]. The authors of this study, however, did
not find evidence of statistical association between gene
content and type of host. Additional work suggested that
the observed genetic diversity between C. jejuni isolates
were instead closely associated with phylogenetic origin of
the strains [34]. In a recent study, a human C. jejuni strain
was inoculated in parallel into outbred chickens and inbred
genetically modified mice [55], resulting in a much lower
variation in the output pool from the mice compared to
that of chickens. In a second experimental system of strain
diversification, one specific C. jejuni variant in a contingency gene was strongly enriched by serial mouse passage

Gripp et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/584

[56]. This may suggest that, in contrast to a host population of low genetic variability such as inbred mice, Campylobacter requires genetic flexibility in a host population
consisting of phenotypically and immunologically diverse
individuals, including factors such as resident microbiota
and bacteriophage abundance. Given these findings, it
seems plausible that abundant Campylobacter types profit
in many different ways from their established genome flexibility, even within a single host species.

Conclusions
While our findings do not rule out the existence of phenotypic and genotypic determinants of Campylobacter tissue
tropism and host specificity, our results from ST-21 genomic and phenotypic comparisons rather support a view
where all ST-21 strains are characterized by a generalist
genome, phenotype and lifestyle, which support their ability to colonize both humans and food animals. The same
might be true for other dominant C. jejuni STs and should
be investigated further. This view is also supported by an
extended MLST study of Campylobacter isolates in the
UK [57]. These frequent types may possess a clear fitness
advantage under diverse conditions. We propose that
future efforts should be directed towards defining the
molecular determinants of this phenotypic flexibility and
generalist capacity, which might be useful targets for interventions into the transmission cycle, and hence ultimately
reduce Campylobacter-associated diseases. For their high
numbers of human infections caused world wide, and
their very broad transmission capacities, the dominant
Campylobacter STs deserve intensive attention. If the
hypothesis of generalist and specialist strain types can be
confirmed in larger Campylobacter strain collections, it
would suggest to study host-specificity or the predictive
value of molecular subtyping methods separately for the
dominant and the rare ST groups.
Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

The 473 recent strains (2006 to 2010) from the FBI-Zoo
collection were collected in different regions in Germany
(Additional File 1: Table S1) and from different hosts and
food sources by members of the FBI-Zoo research network http://www.fbi-zoo.net. Additional reference strains
of different sequence types were included in some of the
analyses, which increased the number of analyzed strains
to 492 (Additional File 1: Table S1). In some instances,
Preston broth (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) was used for bacterial enrichment, and Karmali or Skirrow Agar (Oxoid)
for primary cultivation of Campylobacter spp.. All Campylobacter strains were routinely grown at 37°C or 42°C
under microaerobic conditions (10% CO2, 5% O2, 85% N2)
in vented jars on blood agar plates (Blood Agar Base II;
Oxoid), supplemented with 10% defibrinated horse blood

Page 14 of 21

(Oxoid) and antibiotics (10 mg/liter vancomycin, 2,500 U/
liter polymyxin B, 5 mg/liter trimethoprim, 4 mg/liter
amphotericin B), or on thioglycollate agar (Oxoid). For
DNA preparations, coincubation assays, lysates preparations and phenotypic arrays bacteria were grown on plates
for approximately 24 h before harvest. For some applications, bacteria were incubated in air-tight jars using an
atmosphere generated by Oxoid CampyGen or Merck
Anaerocult C sachet (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
catalysts.
Cell types, cell culture conditions and cell coincubation
with Campylobacter strains

Different cell lines were used for cell coincubation and
adherence assays. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell
line Caco-2 (ACC 57 and 169, German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Braunschweig) was
grown in Dulbecco’s MEM supplemented with 10% [v/v]
fetal bovine serum (FBS). The porcine intestinal epithelial
cell line IPEC-J2 [58] was grown in Dulbecco’s MEM and
Ham’s F-12 (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 5% [v/v]
FBS, and the HD-11 chicken macrophage-like cell line was
maintained in IMDM + GlutaMAX-I (Gibco, Darmstadt,
Germany) supplemented with 10% [v/v] FBS. Caco2, HD11 and IPEC-J2 cell lines stably transfected with the firefly
luciferase gene were generated by K. Tedin and continuously cultured in the presence of puromycin (5 g/L). All
cell lines were routinely kept at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
For the cell adherence assays, Caco-2, IPEC-J2 and HD11 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells per well in a 96 well
plate and grown to near confluency. The cell medium was
replaced prior to the coincubation, 1 h before the addition
of bacterial cells. The bacterial strains were prepared as
follows: bacteria were harvested from plates with a sterile
cotton swab and resuspended in 2 ml sterile cold PBS,
after that all steps were performed on ice. 2 × 108 bacteria
were washed 3 times (5 min, 5,000 × g, 4°C) in PBS, gently
resuspended in 450 μl PBS and surface-biotinylated by
adding 125 μg EZ-link-TM-Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The subsequent
incubation took place at RT in the dark for 50 min. Afterwards the bacteria were washed 3 times and resuspended
in 200 μl cell culture medium. Before adding the bacteria
to the cells, the bacteria were warmed to 37°C, added to
the cells to an MOI of 50 and 200 bacteria per cell, and
centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g to ensure bacteria-host
cell contact. The subsequent coincubation lasted 1 h,
before 2 × washes with PBS were performed to remove
the non-adherent bacteria. The following fixation step of
the cells was initiated by removing the medium and by
adding 100 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde (in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) for 2 h at RT. After fixation, the wells were washed 3 times with PBS + 0.1%

Gripp et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/584

glycine and incubated in a blocking solution (PBS, pH 7.0,
10% FBS) for 1 h, followed by 5 times washing (PBS, pH
7.0, 0.05% [v/v] Tween 20). The cell layers together with
adherent bacteria were incubated for 1 h with neutravidinHRP-conjugate (in PBS pH = 7.0 with 10% FBS [v/v],
(1:5000); Perbio Science, Germany). After 7 times washing
(PBS, pH 7.0, 0.05% [v/v] Tween 20), the wells were incubated for 30 min with 100 μl TMB substrate (Perbio
Science, Germany). The resulting colour reaction was
stopped by adding 50 μl 1 M phosphoric acid and measured at 450 nm (reference filter 540 nm) in a microplate
reader.
For the cytokine release assay (human IL-8), Caco-2 and
Hela cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells in 1 ml of medium per well in a 24 well plate and incubated, until a confluency of 80% was reached (app. 24 h). The medium was
replaced before the addition of bacteria. The cell monolayers were infected with C. jejuni strains at an MOI of 10,
centrifuged 10 min at 300 × g and coincubated for 4 h,
before the supernatants were harvested. After a centrifugation step to remove the bacteria (9,000 × g, 2 min) the
supernatants were stored at -20°C. Analysis of the cell
supernatants for IL-8 protein secretion was performed
using the BD OptEIA human IL-8 Kit (BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
For the NF-B reporter assay, the stably transfected
cell lines CaCo2, IPEC-J2 and HD-11, containing a NFB-Luc reporter fusion, were seeded at 2 × 104 cells in
200 μl medium per well in a 96 well plate and incubated
for 24 hours. The medium was replaced before the addition of bacteria with the medium (100 μl per well) in
the absence of antibiotics. The cell monolayers were
infected with C. jejuni strains at an MOI of 50 in triplicates, centrifuged 5 min at 300 × g to sediment the bacteria, and coincubated for 1 h. After the coincubation,
50 μl of Steady-Glo® Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega Inc., Madison, WI, U.S.A.) was added to each well
and incubated for 10 min to lyse bacteria and start the
enzymatic reaction. The luminescence was then measured with a Wallac 1420 Victor3 V multilabel counter
instrument (PerkinElmer, Waltham MA, U.S.A.).
Generation of antisera

The C. jejuni antiserum 5699 was raised in rabbits
against a mixture of six phylogenetically diverse strains,
which were first fixed in paraformaldehyde, washed, and
then administered to the animals by intradermal injection. The chicken antiserum M3 (generously provided
by Bernd Kaspers) was obtained from a laying hen
which was naturally infected with a C. jejuni strain
(M3a, see Additional File 1: Table S1).

Page 15 of 21

Measurement of cellular ATP content

As an equivalent of intrabacterial energy harvest of each
strain at specific culture conditions, intracellular ATP of
different C. jejuni strains was measured. Bacteria were prepared as suspensions with O.D.600 values of 0.3 (108 cells/
ml) in RPMI 1640 defined cell culture medium at pH 7.4
(RPMI 1640 medium buffered with 20 mM HEPES; Invitrogen Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) Cells were taken
directly from freshly grown plates (24 h growth, at 37°C)
and resuspended gently in liquid medium without prior
washing. The bacteria were then incubated for 30 min at
37°C before starting the ATP assay. For determining ATP
contents of the cells, BacTiter-Glo reagent (an ATPdependent luciferase-luciferin reagent mixture; Promega
Inc., Madison, WI) was added directly to the live bacterial
suspensions at a ratio of 1:1 after the incubation time. The
suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 5 min to lyse the
bacteria and to initiate the enzymatic reaction. The emission of photons was then measured with a Wallac 1420
Victor3 V multilabel counter instrument (PerkinElmer) in
luminescence mode. All experiments were performed at
least two times on separate days in duplicate measurements. Values were collected and further processed in MS
Excel, calculating the level of luminescence (as relative
luminescence units). In the results, one representative
experiment is shown.
DNA and protein methods

Genomic DNA of bacteria was extracted using the
QIAamp DNA purification kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PCRs were performed with
standard methods using Taq polymerase (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). PCR products prepared for Sanger sequencing were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions before sequencing.
For the preparation of bacterial lysates, bacteria were
grown for 24 h at 37°C or 42°C in a microaerobic atmosphere, harvested with sterile cotton swabs and resuspended in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. The bacterial cells were
sonicated three times 1 min with an ultrasonic device
(Branson Sonic Power Company, Danbury, U.S.A.) at 4°C
and at power level 5 (80-100 W). The amount of proteins
in the lysates was analyzed using the BCA Protein Assay
(Pierce, Rockford IL, USA). The proteins were separated
on 11.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western immunoblotting was performed according to standard methods using
the chicken antiserum M3 or our specific customary C.
jejuni-mix antiserum 5699. Immuno-reactive bands were
visualized with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Bonn, Germany) on
ECL hyperfilm (GE Healthcare, Piscataway NJ, U.S.A.).

Molecular typing and pathotyping methods

492 C. jejuni and C. coli strains from our collection (473
of which were isolates collected between 2006 and 2010,
the others were collected earlier and included some reference strains) comprising strains from different sources in
Germany were MLST-typed as described in Dingle et al.,
2005 [25]. Briefly, genomic DNA was amplified with primer pairs for seven housekeeping genes, aspA, glnA, gltA,

glyA, pgmA, tkt, and uncA. The PCR-products were purified as described above and sequenced in both orientations using the Sanger method. The MLST data were
collected in Seqsphere (RIDOM GmbH, Wuerzburg,
Germany; http://www.ridom.de/seqsphere/) and Bionumerics (Applied Maths, Sint Martens-Latem, Belgium).
Phylogenetic relationships between the STs were calculated by MLST-based cluster analysis in Bionumerics.

Gripp et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:584
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/584

Minimal Spanning Trees were generated from the cluster
analysis with 100 permutations (Bionumerics), using the
seven MLST loci information.
Based on the MLST analysis, 91 C. jejuni strains with
representative STs were chosen for the PCR-based pathotyping. The presence or absence of selected putative virulence genes was detected by PCR as described above and
in the results. For some genes with previously described
sequence diversity, such as ggt and ansB, multiple primer
combinations were tested to exclude false-negative results
and to ensure that the absence of the gene is not due to
the sequence diversity. The genes and primers are listed in
Table 2.
Metabolic phenotyping using Biolog Phenotype
Microarrays

The bacteria were harvested from fresh plates after 24 h
incubation at 37°C or 42°C, resuspended in IF-0a medium (Biolog, Hayward, CA, U.S.A.) and adjusted to 16%
transmittance (O.D.600 = 0.8). The cell suspension was
mixed with a solution containing IF-0a, tetrazolium violet
(Redox dye D), PM 1 additive and water according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Biolog). 100 μl of the final
suspension was added to each well of the 96-well Biolog
carbon utilization plate PM1. The PM1 panels were
placed without lids into gas impermeable bags (Biolog)
together with a Campy Gen Compact sachet (Oxoid) to
generate a microaerobic atmosphere and sealed. All
working steps were carried out under the laminar flow to
ensure a sterile environment. The Biolog panels were
incubated in the OmniLog instrument (Biolog) either at
37°C or 42°C for 30 h. The utilization of different metabolites was recorded spectrophotometrically every
15 min over the whole incubation period, and evaluated
with the OmniLog PM software (Kinetic Analysis). The
area values (area under the kinetic curves) over time
were used for comparison of substrate utilization
between strains. All assays were repeated for at least
three times on different days. Eight strains of ST-21
(xy259, A588, RB922, RB923, 6399, 7731, 04197, 04199)
and nine, exclusively human-isolated, strains from other
STs (xy898 [ST-50], R267 [ST-48], xy904 [ST-45], A396
[ST-267], 222 [ST-257], 02551 [ST-607], 02557 [ST-290],
A412 [ST-51], A599 [ST-572]) were analyzed. Reproducibility of the assays was high, indicated by a low standard
deviation of approximately 31%, calculated for three
independent biological replicate assays (evaluated only
for constantly positive area values > 800, since area values
below 800 were evaluated not to be reliably positive).
False-positive results for four pentose sugars, D-xylose,
L-arabinose, D-ribose and L-lyxose, which were due to
the sensitivity of the redox dye alone, as confirmed by
incubating Biolog plates in the absence of bacteria, were

Page 17 of 21

excluded from the analysis. These false positive results
have also been described before by others [59]. No other
false positive results for saccharides were noted.
Campylobacter whole genome sequencing and sequence
analysis

Whole genomic DNA for 454 sequencing was isolated
using Qiagen Genomic tip 100/G columns and the Genomic DNA Buffer Set (Qiagen). High quality genomic DNA
of C. jejuni was then sheared according to a reproducible
method by nebulization, quality-controlled on an Agilent
bioanalyzer chip (DNA Chip7500, Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA, U.S.A.), end-polished with T4 DNA polymerase and
T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly
MA, U.S.A.) [47]. DNA fragments were then subjected to
bead coating and 454 sequencing in a Roche 454 sequencer, using FLX Titanium (Roche) chemistry according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Subsequent to the pyrosequencing process, the Roche
Assembler software was used for assembling the primary
reads into contigs. Between 37 and 156 contigs were
obtained for the five whole genome sequences (xy259: 68
contigs, estimated genome size: 1,7 Mbp; RB922; 156 contigs, estimated genome size 1.7 Mbp; 6399: 43 contigs, estimated genome size 1.5 Mbp; 04197: 83 contigs, estimated
genome size 1.7 Mbp; 04199: 71 contigs, estimated genome
size 1.8 Mbp). Further statistics for the sequencing process
and additional quality controls are available upon request.
The draft genome sequences are available in the ENA
EMBL-Bank database with accession numbers
CAFR01000001-68, CAFS01000001-156, CAFT0100000143, CAFU01000001-83, CAFV01000001-71. Further, the
genomes were annotated in the Kodon software (Applied
Maths, Sint Martens-Latem, Belgium) using several publicly available complete C. jejuni genome sequences, and
the contigs of the draft sequences were then ordered 1) by
aligning all five draft sequences to each other, and 2) by
aligning all five genome sequences using the finished genome of C. jejuni 11168 [20] as a scaffold. Whole genome
alignments were generated within the Kodon, GeneDoc
(http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc) and MAUVE [60]
softwares. All pairs of genomes (reference genome was
04199 for all pairwise comparisons) were analyzed using
the Hidden Markov Model implemented in ClonalFrame
[61] which comprises two states: the “clonal” state in which
only mutations separate the two genomes and the “recombined” state in which the polymorphism density is higher
due to the import of unrelated DNA. This allowed to pinpoint the regions that had recombined, as well as to quantify the overall frequency and effect of recombination
during the diversification of pairs of genomes. A similar
approach was recently implemented by Kennemann et al
[47].

Chicken infection

To evaluate the colonization ability of different C. jejuni
strains, we infected three-weeks old specific-pathogen-free
(SPF) white leghorn chicks (Lohmann Animal Health,
Cuxhaven, Germany). Chicks were reared in cages and fed
with a commercial diet devoid of antibiotics and provided
with sterile drinking water ad libitum. The chicks (five animals per group) were inoculated by intraoesophagal
gavage, twice on two subsequent days, each time with a
0.5 ml suspension containing 5 × 107 cfu/ml of a C. jejuni
human- (xy259) or chicken-derived (RB922) strain, resuspended in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI, Oxoid) broth. One
day prior to the infection, cloacal swabs were taken to
confirm by plating and by genus- and species-specific PCR
that the chickens were Campylobacter-free. On days 2, 3,
6, 9 and 13 after the second inoculation, cloacal swabs
were again taken for continuous monitoring of the colonization levels. The swabs were first streaked onto Columbia
blood agar plates supplemented with selective antibiotics
(see above) and after that used for the extraction of chromosomal DNA according to the QiaAmp Tissue DNA
spin kit protocol. The presence of C. jejuni strains in the
infected animals was confirmed for the swab DNAs and
the cultured bacteria by PCR with specific Campylobacter
genus primers, based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene
sequence [62], and by primers specific for several C. jejuni
genes. On day 15 after the second inoculation, the chickens were sacrificed. Caeca were sampled from all animals
for DNA and RNA isolation. DNA was prepared from
equivalent pieces of the caecal tip tissue for all animals
using the QiaAmp Tissue DNA Spin kit (Qiagen). Colonization levels in the caecum were quantitatively evaluated
for all animals using Real Time PCR on equal amounts of
DNA prepared from caecal total tissue. All animal experiments were performed according to German legal requirements with approval by the federal government of Berlin
permit from SoGeLa no. G 0210/09.

16S rDNA primers (Table 2), and, if necessary, the residual
DNA was removed by a second DNAseI treatment and
subsequent RNeasy column purification. cDNA was prepared from equivalent amounts (1 μg) of total RNA using
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Inc.) and
using random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR or RT PCR using gene-specific
primers (Table 2) was then performed on equal amounts
of cDNA (0.5 to 2.5 μl) and normalized to a 16S rDNA
RT PCR control reaction.
Real time PCR (TaqMan)

The RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Qiagen).
Reactions were carried out on a Bio-Rad cycler (Abi TaqMan 7000 [ABI Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies,
Darmstadt, Germany] and BioRad C1000/CFX96 combined system [BioRad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A:]). Primers
targeted to the pglB gene (Table 2) were used to amplify
sequences specific for C. jejuni. Cycling conditions were
as follows: denaturation for 10 min at 95°C, amplification
for 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 15 s, and at 72°C
for 30 s. For quantification of DNA amounts, a serial
standard was prepared from a purified PCR product of
the C. jejuni pglB gene (strain xy259). Final concentrations of the standard were 10 pg, 1 pg, 0.1 pg, 0.01 pg
and 0.001 pg of DNA. All standard probes were also prepared in a second serial dilution mixed with mouse caecum DNA at a final concentration of 100 ng per μl in
each sample (spiked samples). The same concentration of
total DNA was used in the final reactions for all DNAs
prepared from infected chicken caeca. Each reaction was
performed in duplicate.

Additional material
RNA preparation

An inoculum of the Campylobacter strains was prepared
from bacteria grown for less than 24 h on Columbia blood
agar plates. The bacteria were inoculated at an initial O.
D. 600 of approximately 0.08 into liquid medium (BHI
Broth) in the presence of 5% horse serum (Oxoid). Bacteria were grown in liquid medium overnight, up to an O.
D.600 of 0.4 to 0.6. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation (21.000 × g for 2 min, room temperature), bacterial pellets flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°
C. For RNA preparation, bacterial pellets were resuspended in Qiagen RNeasy lysis buffer containing b-mercaptoethanol and lysed in a beadbeater machine (Fastprep,
Bio101 Thermo Scientific, Bonn, Germany) for 45 s. The
RNA was further purified from the lysates using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol. Total RNA was quantitated in a
