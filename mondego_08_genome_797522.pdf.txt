Abstract
Background: The basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of Witches'
Broom Disease (WBD) in cacao (Theobroma cacao). It is a hemibiotrophic pathogen that colonizes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

the apoplast of cacao's meristematic tissues as a biotrophic pathogen, switching to a saprotrophic
lifestyle during later stages of infection. M. perniciosa, together with the related species M. roreri, are
pathogens of aerial parts of the plant, an uncommon characteristic in the order Agaricales. A
genome survey (1.9× coverage) of M. perniciosa was analyzed to evaluate the overall gene content
of this phytopathogen.
Results: Genes encoding proteins involved in retrotransposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
resistance, drug efflux transport and cell wall degradation were identified. The great number of
genes encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (1.15% of gene models) indicates that M.
perniciosa has a great potential for detoxification, production of toxins and hormones; which may
confer a high adaptive ability to the fungus. We have also discovered new genes encoding putative
secreted polypeptides rich in cysteine, as well as genes related to methylotrophy and plant
hormone biosynthesis (gibberellin and auxin). Analysis of gene families indicated that M. perniciosa
have similar amounts of carboxylesterases and repertoires of plant cell wall degrading enzymes as
other hemibiotrophic fungi. In addition, an approach for normalization of gene family data using
incomplete genome data was developed and applied in M. perniciosa genome survey.
Conclusion: This genome survey gives an overview of the M. perniciosa genome, and reveals that
a significant portion is involved in stress adaptation and plant necrosis, two necessary
characteristics for a hemibiotrophic fungus to fulfill its infection cycle. Our analysis provides new
evidence revealing potential adaptive traits that may play major roles in the mechanisms of
pathogenicity in the M. perniciosa/cacao pathosystem.

Background
Moniliophthora perniciosa, previously known as Crinipellis
perniciosa (Singer) Stahel, is a hemibiotrophic basidiomycete (Tricholomataceae, Agaricales, Marasmiaceae)
fungus that causes Witches' broom disease (WBD) in
cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) [1-3]. WBD and frosty pod rot
(FPR), caused by Moniliophthora roreri, are the most devastating diseases of cacao in the Americas [4]. Cacao production in southeastern Bahia, the main production area in
Brazil, was severely affected by the introduction of WBD
at the end of 1980's [5]. This disease damaged Bahian
agribusiness, caused major social problems and has contributed to the degradation of the Atlantic Rainforest
("Mata Atlântica"). This is because cacao producing areas,
typically, maintained old-growth native tree species as
shade for the cacao plantations, which were converted to
pasture [6].
The symptoms displayed by cacao plants during WBD
parallel the hemibiotrophic development of M. perniciosa
[7]. Briefly, the disease begins when fungal spores germinate and infect meristematic tissues, developing into
monokaryotic biotrophic hyphae without clamp connections that slowly occupy the intercellular space. This stage
of WBD is characterized by the emergence of hypertrophic
and hyperplasic anomalous branches, and the formation
of parthenocarpic fruits. Infected branches, known as
"green brooms", grow without apical dominance, with a
phototropic orientation and displaying epinastic leaves
[7]. After two to three months the infected tissue turns
necrotic (dry brooms) and the hyphae become saprotrophic with two nuclei per cell and clamp connections,

invading the inter and intracellular spaces of the infected
tissue [6,8]. This fungal species exhibits primary homothalism as its reproductive strategy [9]; thus, the change
from the monokaryotic to the dikaryotic mycelium occurs
without the prerequisite of mating between compatible
individuals. After alternate wet and dry periods, basidiomes produced by the saprotrophic hyphae release basidiospores that are spread by wind or rain, thus completing
the M. perniciosa life cycle [7].
The Witches' broom Genome Project http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/vassoura involving several Brazilian laboratories was initiated to increase the knowledge
of this disease. The genome size, chromosomal polymorphism, genetic variability and the M. perniciosa mitochondrial genome have already been described [10-12].
Additionally, a biochemical study revealed the metabolic
modifications that occur in cacao plantlets during WBD
development [13]. Technical improvements have been
achieved in the manipulation of cacao [14,15] and M. perniciosa [16,17]. One of the main bottlenecks in M. perniciosa research was solved with the development of the in
vitro production of biotrophic-like cultures [18]. Necrotic
inducing proteins expressed by M. perniciosa have been
characterized [19], and the analysis of EST libraries and
DNA microarrays have identified differentially expressed
genes during its development [[20]; A.B.L. Pires et al.,
unpublished data] and for the interaction of the fungus
with cacao [21,22]. Despite the substantial progression in
understanding WBD, many questions remain unsolved,
mainly those concerning the mechanisms controlling
processes such as: (i) the fungal switch from biotrophism
Page 2 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:548

to saprotrophism; (ii) the drastic phenotypic alteration of
cacao during disease development and (iii) the death of
infected tissues. In vitro cultures in our laboratory demonstrate that this fungus has a great capacity to adapt to
media containing different sources of carbon and nitrogen and it is able to grow in extremely nutrient-poor
media. These results together with the fact that hemibiotrophic fungi, such as M. perniciosa, display complex lifestyles [23] suggest that this fungus has a significant
genomic and transcriptomic plasticity that contributes to
the successful pathogenic mechanisms expressed during
its life cycle. In a recent review, Meinhardt et al., give a historical account and summarize the current state of knowledge about WBD [24].
Around two thirds of the known Basidiomycota species
are included in the order Agaricales [25]. In addition to
being an interesting group for carrying out developmental
genetic studies concerning fungal development and reproduction, the Agaricales contain many important industrial
species (i.e., edible mushrooms, fiber bleaching fungus),
and species with unique lifestyles: saprophytes (i.e, wooddecaying fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium), symbionts
(i.e., ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor), leaf-litters
decomposers (i.e., Agaricus bisporus) and root pathogens
(i.e., Armilaria mellea). Interestingly, M. perniciosa and M.
roreri are members of a group of Agaricales species that are
able to infect aerial parts of plants, an uncommon characteristic among this Basidiomycota order.
Genome sequencing and analysis is an important strategy
to obtain comprehensive information concerning the
metabolism and development of organisms. The initial
objective of the M. perniciosa Genome Project was to
obtain a genome survey sequence using a whole shotgun
strategy to provide genomic information for the WBD
research community. Recently, the bioinformatics and
genomic communities have been debating about the benefits and costs of finishing a complete genome as compared to applying a genome survey strategy [26-32]. It has
been proposed that a two-fold genome sequence coverage
is sufficient to support a high percentage of EST alignments and exon similarity matches [26,31]. Additionally,
gene models resulting from a genome survey can be predicted accurately by the comparison with complete
genomes of phylogenetically related organisms [26,31].
This strategy has been used for genomic surveys of dog
(1.5× coverage) [31] and of the wine spoilage yeast
Dekkera bruxellensis (0.4× coverage) [33]. Recently, the
genomes of the basidiomycete species Laccaria bicolor,
Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis, Coprinopsis cinerea (Coprinus cinereus) and Phanerochaete chrysosporium
have been determined and many additional Basidiomycota genome projects are ongoing or about to be released

www.jgi.doe.gov, which could provide a rich database for
additional Basidiomycota genomic survey evaluations.
With the existence of several complete Basidiomycota
genomes, and both M. perniciosa ESTs libraries, and a 1.9
× genome coverage, we decided to conduct a genome survey of M. perniciosa to obtain further information about
this important phytopathogen. This report describes a survey of the genome sequences of M. perniciosa, with specific
emphasis on the genes potentially involved in disease
development such as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, transposable elements, putative plant defense elicitors, pathogenicity effectors, cell wall degrading enzymes,
proteins related to methylotrophy and the biosynthesis of
plant hormones by the fungus. The identification of such
genes in the M. perniciosa genomic data lead us to hypothesize a connection between molecular processes involved
in the growth phases of the fungus and the progression of
WBD.

Results and discussion
Genome assembly and estimation of genome size
A diagram flow describing the bioinformatic procedures
applied in the M. perniciosa genome survey are depicted in
Figure 1. After sequencing, a total of 124,565 reads were
obtained and assembled using the whole genome shotgun
strategy. During the initial assembly process, a large contig
including 6,920 reads was found. This contig was identified as the mitochondrial genome of the fungus (RefSeq
NC_005927), which comprised approximately 6% of M.
perniciosa sequences [12]. The remaining genome
sequences were assembled resulting in 17,991 contigs and
7,065 singlets with average lengths of 1,300 bp and 455
bp, respectively. The largest contig consisted of 25,364 bp,
and was formed by 513 reads. The sum of all reads was
close to 75 Mbp and the total assembly consisted of 26.7
Mbp (Fig. 1).

Previous Feulgen-image analysis experiments estimated
M. perniciosa genome size to be 32.98 ± 7.95 Mbp [10].
Due to the large error in this estimation we decided to
assess the genome size using the genome estimation protocol established in the dog genome survey [31] (more
details in Additional File 1). This analysis resulted in a
genome size ranging from 38.7 to 39.0 Mbp, a value similar to the genome length of another fungus belonging the
order Agaricales, C. cinerea (37.5 Mbp), and that agrees
with the previous size estimated by Feulgen-image analysis [10].
The Lander Waterman theory (LW) [34] and its applications [35,36] were used to confirm the estimate of the M.
perniciosa genome size. The theoretical values for the
expected number of clusters (contigs + singlets), contigs,
gaps, average cluster length and average gap length can be
calculated using the LW theory from the effective average

read length, the number of reads and the genome size as
parameters. If the calculated values derived from the
genome assembly were close to the theoretical values
derived from LW calculations, then it is possible to confirm the estimated genome size. A summary of the results
obtained from the assembly data and from the estimation
using the LW theory is shown in Table 1. The experimental
values agreed with the theoretical calculations, thus supporting our genome size estimation. According to LW
analysis the average gap size was 413 pb. To have more
information about the distribution of the gap size, we performed a comparison between a set of eukaryotic core
proteins (generated by CEGMA pipeline [37]) and M. perniciosa contigs (See Additional file 1). Using this methodology, we detected that the average gap size was around
500 ± 300 bp, corroborating with LW average gap size estimative (413 bp). Considering that most of the gaps are
around 500 bp and that C. cinerea average gene size is
1,678 bp, the majority of M. perniciosa genes or partial
gene regions are likely to be included in the contigs. Corroborating this notion, we have found all genes encoding
proteins of essential metabolic pathways such as Glycolysis, Gluconeogenesis, Pentose Phosphate pathway, and
several others, which are available in the website http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/biocyc/MP (see below).
In order to estimate the number of sequences misassembled due to repeat regions, we applied the integrated pipeline for assembly validation, called amosvalidate [38]
(Further information in Additional file 1). This analysis
resulted in 664 contigs with overrepresented regions totaling 1.1 Mbp. Multiplying the number of bases in overrepresented regions by over-coverage estimate resulted in 7.4
Mbp of repeat regions in the genome. Since reads from
repetitive regions were eliminated from the estimation of
the genome length using dog genome survey protocol
(Additional file 1), this misassembling does not invalidates the genome size estimate.
Gene content
The initial step to uncover the gene content of M. perniciosa was performed using the genomic sequences together
with a library of 3,145 ESTs, previously annotated and
partially published [20]. Genes were identified by comparing these two libraries using the program Exalin [39].
This analysis allowed us to identify expressed genes and
intron structure. The result was 2,002 ESTs aligned to the

genome contigs. Based on this EST-genome sequence
alignment, the average intron length was estimated as 52
bp. This information was then used in the next steps of the
process.
A more detailed investigation of the gene content was carried out using a combination of ab initio (gene predictor
programs) and comparative gene prediction (BLAST-EST
sequence alignment). For ab initio gene prediction, we first
applied the methodology described for the AUGUSTUS
gene predictor [40]http://augustus.gobics.de/binaries/
retraining.html. This methodology essentially trains the
AUGUSTUS program using a combination of sequences
from the species of interest together with sequences of a
phylogenetically related species, specifically with similarities in intron and exon length distributions. Using this
approach, the coding content sensors (codon usage, GC
content) are trained with sequences of the species of interest, and signal sensors (splice sites, TATA-box, polyadenilation sites, etc) are trained with the sequences of the
related species. Sequences from C. cinerea were used in the
training process; together with selected M. perniciosa ESTs
with E-value in BLASTX-NR ≤ 1E-10. The sequences of the
ESTs that aligned with proteins in the databank were concatenated, giving rise to a 240 Kbp sequence. Ten copies of
this M. perniciosa EST concatamers (total of 2.4 Mbp)
together with a dataset of genes from C. cinerea http://
augustus.gobics.de/datasets, comprised of 1.2 Mbp, were
used to "pre-train" AUGUSTUS. The M. perniciosa predictions that came out of this pre-training were compared
with the protein databank NR using BLASTp. The resulting
predictions with similarities in the NR databank, and with
a coverage ≥ 90%, were selected. After eliminating redundancies, 134 complete (containing the start codon and
stop codon) and 1,136 partial (without the start codon
and/or stop codon) M. perniciosa gene models were used
to train AUGUSTUS [40] and two other gene predictors
(SNAP [41] and Genezilla [42]). Predictions with less
than 30 amino acids were eliminated. The remaining predictions were grouped into 19,932 overlapping clusters;
that is, genomic regions covered by at least one prediction.
The predictions in each overlapping cluster were ranked
according to the criteria used by the Fungal Genome Initiative at the Broad Institute http://www.broad.mit.edu,
with some adaptations. The ab initio gene finding pipeline
generated 13,640 gene models, 9,560 of which contained

significant similarity to GenBank sequences (Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2).
The extrinsic prediction methodology consisted of a combination of genomic similarity searches (BLASTX) using
contigs and singlets, with the alignment of M. perniciosa
ESTs in the genomic clusters. 17,991 contigs and 7,065
singlets were submitted to similarity analysis in a databank containing BLASTX-NR plus P. chrysosporium proteins. The genomic regions containing homologues in this
databank were selected and exon-intron boundaries were
determined. We also selected the alignments between
ESTs and genomic clusters. Then, we evaluated if there was
a superposition of BLAST alignments and EST alignments.
After this analysis, the extrinsic prediction methodology
revealed 12,249 gene models. Most of these gene models
(9,560) were also predicted by the ab initio gene predictor
programs. Of the 2,689 remaining gene models not predicted by the gene predictor programs, 1,789 presented
significant similarity to sequences deposited in the GenBank (E-value ≤ 1E-10) and 900 did not have any significant similarity in the GenBank (E-value > 1 E-10) (Fig. 1
and Fig. 2). One of the reasons why these genes were not
detected by the gene prediction programs could be the
presence of low quality sequences that may have lead to
frameshifts, thus making them impossible to detect by
these programs. The total number of gene models
obtained using both approaches, ab initio and extrinsic
predictions, is 16,329. Assuming that the average contig
length is 1.3 Kbp and the average gap length is 413 bp, it
is possible that this total number of gene models (16,329)
represents an overestimation. For instance, in our assem-

bly a gene with > 2 Kbp (protein ~700 aa) could be represented by two gene models, with each one in different
contigs, which suggests a possible redundancy in this gene
model prediction. Thus, it is very likely that the real
number of gene models will be less and closer to the ab
initio or extrinsic predictions separately. However, to
obtain the maximum amount of information, we decided
to evaluate the results of similarity searches in GenBank
(BLASTX-NR) for all 16,329 gene models. As a result,
69.5% (11,349) of the gene models showed significant
sequence similarity (E-value ≤ 1e-10) to GenBank proteins. The remaining 30.5% (4,980), designated as "nohits", were sequences with lower E-value scores (E-value >
1e-10). Of these gene models 4,080 were predicted with
the ab initio gene predictors and 900 with the extrinsic predictions (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).
As expected, BLASTX analysis against available complete
fungal genomes showed that M. perniciosa gene models
present higher similarity to genes from Basidiomycota (L.
bicolor, C. cinerea and P. chrysosporium) than those from
Ascomycota (Table 2).
In order to find groups of similar proteins in our dataset,
we applied a Markov Clustering (MCL) algorithm [43] to
the M. perniciosa gene models. Although the output by this
method is not highly reliable, they correlate well with
"real" gene families and can be applied efficiently to cluster large quantities of genes in a high throughput fashion
[44,45]. MCL also helped to the assemble genes without
similarity in the GenBank into gene families, which are
described in the following sections.
Those gene models that were not grouped into gene families by the MCL algorithm have been compared with the
genome of C. cinerea in order to discard those genes with
parts of their sequences present in more than one contig.
In order to perform this comparison (TBLASTN) we
assume that the length distribution of M. perniciosa proteins is similar to those from C. cinerea. In this comparison we evaluated similar genes according to the length of
the protein (Fig. 3). This comparison showed that there is
a clear correlation between complete genes in C. cinerea
and M. perniciosa gene models coding for proteins smaller
than 300 aa. However, for larger proteins more than one
M. perniciosa gene model showed similarity to a single C.
cinerea protein, thus confirming the overestimation of the
number of gene models. Given the fact that the genome
sequence is incomplete, there is high probability that we
are predicting more than one gene model per gene.
In order to have a measurement of the overestimation and
use it to correct our database, the corresponding relationship between the protein size and the number of gene
models was calibrated with the genome of C. cinerea using

* – Each M. perniciosa gene model was compared to all the proteins from the organisms listed in the table. BLASTX score was defined as 1e-10

the gene models unlinked to gene families identified by
the MCL algorithm (Fig. 3). A linear regression formula
was used to correct for the overestimation according to the
protein size. For example, proteins smaller than 300
amino acids will have only one model representing the
gene, while larger proteins will have one model and a fraction of a second model representing its gene. This fraction
represents the overestimation of the number of gene models.
In order to estimate the gene density in M. perniciosa, and
deal with the overestimation evident by the previous analysis, we averaged the total number of gene models
obtained by the different predictions: ab initio predictions
(13,640), extrinsic predictions (12,249) and total number
of gene predictions (16,329). This resulted in 14,072 gene
predictions that were divided by the 39 Mbp estimated
genome size, which gave a gene density of approximately

obtained using ab initio and extrinsic predictions.
Although this number represents an overestimation of the
real number of genes (see above), it was used to maximize
the information acquired from these sequences. All data
obtained in the gene families and protein domain analyses were corrected according to the normalization procedure developed from the gene models not included in any
of the MCL families based on comparisons with the C. cinerea genome (see above).
The program AutoFACT [47], an automated annotation
tool, was used to evaluate the putative functions of M. perniciosa gene models. This program determines the most
informative functional description by combining multiple BLAST reports from a number of user selected databases, and provides a consensus result [47]. AutoFACT
classifies proteins as "classified proteins", which can be
"assigned" (containing similarity to proteins with annotated function) or "unassigned" (containing similarity to
proteins with unknown function), and "unclassified proteins" (without similarity to any other protein in databanks). Using this software, 73% of gene models (11,950)
were annotated as previously classified proteins. From
these 7,416 (45%) were assigned proteins, and 4,534
(28%) were classified as unassigned proteins, which can

be interpreted as a class of conserved hypothetical proteins (Table 3). The remaining 4,379 gene models (27%)
were considered as unclassified proteins. The number of
gene models with E-value scores > 1e-10 obtained by
BLASTX-NR (no-hits, see previous section) was 4,980 and
represented 30.5% of the total number of models. The
result obtained with AutoFACT increased the number of
classified proteins by 3.5% (Fig. 1; Table 3). This indicates
that the use of domain classification databases is helpful
in the identification and annotation of gene models.
Additionally, we correlated the AutoFACT annotation
with the gene families assembled by the MCL algorithm.
As depicted in Table 4 and additional file 2, MCL data
indicated that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase family had the largest number of M. perniciosa members, followed by a gypsy-like retrotransposon gene family, and a
gene family that has similarity to a C. cinerea hypothetical
protein (EAU86912.1) and to a shitake mushroom Lentinula edodes EST (EB016963). This new gene family
appears to be related to specific developmental traits of
the Agaricales. Also found were new gene families with
unknown functions based on their lack of homology with
GenBank sequences (Additional file 2; Additional File 3 –
Worksheet Unknown Gene Families). These families

could possibly be linked to M. perniciosa physiological
characteristics.
A comparison of the gene models with the CDD-PFAM
databank [48] was performed to obtain information
about protein domains present in M. perniciosa proteins.
The data obtained were normalized using the procedure
described above. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was
the most prevalent protein domain assigned in M. perniciosa (gnl|CDD|40168), followed by protein kinases
(gnl|CDD|40170), sugar transporters (gnl|CDD|40184),
short chain dehydrogenases (gnl|CDD|40206) and carboxylesterases/lipases (gnl|CDD|40235) (Table 5; Additional File 4). The prevalence of Cytochrome P450
monooxygenase domains in the genome agrees with the
results of MCL analysis. CDD-PFAM analysis was also
used to evaluate the protein domains in other genome
fungi (Additional File 4). The comparisons between M.
perniciosa and the other fungi analyzed are described
below.
A hypothetical metabolic map of M. perniciosa was built
using BioCyc [49]. This analysis allowed us to annotate
235 metabolic pathways. These include 1358 enzymatic
reactions incorporating a total of 2139 enzymes http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/biocyc/MP. A comparison of this
metabolic map with the fungal model Saccharomyces cere-

visiae S288C (documented with 132 pathways, 925 enzymatic reactions, and 675 enzymes – http://
www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/biocyc/comparatives/MP-SCER)
showed that M. perniciosa has more metabolic pathways
than S. cerevisiae; a result that corresponds to the smaller
genome size of S. cerevisiae and possibly the more complex lifestyle of M. perniciosa. Interestingly, M. perniciosa
has a higher number of reactions involving O2, CO2,
H2O2, and NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H than S. cerevisiae, suggesting a greater capacity to use and deal with oxidationreduction reactions (Additional File 5 – worksheet compounds). We also detected reactions with farnesyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl-diphosphate, which are
involved in the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites
such as isoprenoids and indoles. Moreover, according to
BioCyc analysis, M. perniciosa has more amino acid catabolic pathways, alternative carbon sources degradation
and biosynthesis routes and C1 compounds (i.e., methanol) utilization and assimilation reactions than S. cerevisiae (Additional File 5 – worksheet pathways). These
pathways are under manual annotation and will be published on BioCyc web page. The existence of these pathways in M. perniciosa suggest ecological and physiological
adaptations to environmental stresses; to competition
present in its native habitat in the Amazon Basin, and to
traits that enable it to colonize cacao and trigger WBD.

Detoxification and general resistance mechanisms:
cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, efflux transporters
and anti-oxidative apparatus
Based on CDD-PFAM and MCL analyses gene members of
the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase superfamily are
prevalent in the genome of M. perniciosa (Tables 4 and 5;
Additional File 3 – Worksheet P450; Additional File 4).
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play a role in hydroxylation and oxidation processes involved in biosynthesis
and degradation of different compounds [50]. Therefore,
a large number of gene models similar to cytochrome
P450 monooxygenases suggest a significant capacity for
synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as hormones or
toxins, and for detoxification. Among the fungi analyzed,
M. perniciosa has the highest number of cytochrome P450
monooxygenase genes (188 gene models) representing
1.15% of the gene models (Fig. 5A). Saproprotrophic
basidiomycetes P. chrysosporium and C. cinerea and the
hemibiotrophic ascomycetes Magnaporthe grisea and
Fusarium graminearum also have more than one hundred
cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes representing
between 1.25% and 0.9% of their gene models (Figure 5A;
Additional File 4). The basidiomycete L. bicolor (an ectomycorrhizal fungus) and the ascomycete Neurospora crassa
(a fire-scoured landscape colonizer) follow with fewer
genes. U. maydis (a biotrophic pathogen), C. neoformans
(an animal pathogen) and S. cerevisiae (a fermentative
fungus) have the fewest cytochrome P450 monoooxygenase genes of the fungi compared in this study (Fig. 5A;
Additional File 4). This analysis clearly demonstrates the
prevalence of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in
saprotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi, which have to
hydrolize complex wood polymers and deal with a highly
oxidative environment. As discussed by Gonzalez and
Nebert [50], cytochrome P450 monooxygenase polymorphisms may be the product of the "molecular warfare"
that occurs during the co-evolution of preys and predators, which produce toxins and detoxifying genes, respectively. This logic can be extrapolated to the plant-fungus
interaction, and in that sense, we believe that the plethora
of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in M. perniciosa
may be critical to detoxification and environmental adaptation as well as for disease development.

Another set of proteins related to detoxification processes
are the efflux transporters. Similarity searches in the Transport Classification Database (TCDB – http://
www.tcdb.org) [51] which compare the genome of M. perniciosa with other fungal genomes (Additional File 3 –
Worksheet Functional annotation and Worksheet Transporters) verified an extended set of efflux transporters
from classes 3.A.1 (ABC superfamily) and 3.A.3 (P-type
ATPase Superfamily). The majority of ABC transporters
identified in M. perniciosa belong to the Pleiotropic Drug
Resistance (PDR) family and the ABC Conjugate (ABCC)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

Transporter family. These proteins have been associated
with fungal pathogenesis [52] and heavy metal resistance
[53]. The members of P-type ATPase superfamily in M.
perniciosa include phospholipid translocating ATPases
family and fungal ENA-ATPases transporters, which are
involved with the efflux of excessive Na+, and especially
K+, encountered by fungi during colonization of plants
[54].
During the plant defense, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are produced to limit the pathogen invasion [55]. However, pathogenic fungi produce antioxidant enzymes that
enable them to neutralize host ROS. M. perniciosa contains
a myriad of O2- and H2O2 decomposing enzymes such as
superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxiredoxins, glutathione-system, thioredoxin-system enzymes and manganese dependent peroxidases (Additional File 3 –
Worksheet Functional Annotation). Therefore, this fungal
genome harbors a complete ROS detoxification system.
Reports indicate that H2O2 favors necrotrophic pathogens
infection [56,57]. Furthermore, M. perniciosa produces
calcium oxalate crystals (COC) [58], and a cacao susceptible genotype accumulates COC during M. perniciosa infection, followed by a programmed cell death (PCD) [59].
The degradation of COC produces carbon dioxide and
H2O2, suggesting that COCs can be important to necrotrophic mycelia development. In addition, oxalate
chelates Ca2+, an important secondary plant defense messenger and a key cross-linker of pectin in the middle
lamella pectin [60], and was found to be a trigger of PCD
in plants [61]. These findings suggest that oxalate favors
M. perniciosa infection by disorganizing plant defense and
plant cell wall structure, by facilitating the action of fungal
pectinases and possibly triggering PCD in the later stages
of WBD [59].
Genome variability: Mating-type genes and transposable
elements
Seven M. perniciosa gene models were found to be similar
to pheromone receptors (Additional File 3 – Worksheet
Functional Annotation). As a primary homothallic fungus, M. perniciosa does not use its mating type system to
outcross, but probably to promote the formation of clamp
connections, hyphae dikaryotization and for the expression of pathogenicity genes as in U. maydis [62]. Previous
reports have indicated that M. perniciosa exhibits high
genetic variability at the molecular level [11,63,64]. This
level of variability may be the reason M. perniciosa overcomes resistant genotypes of cacao, such as Scavina 6 [65].
Furthermore, it has been postulated that the genome variability found in homothallic M. perniciosa may be due to
transposable elements (TEs) and ectopic recombination
guided by the numerous copies of these elements found
in the genome [10]. The fact that retrotransposons were
identified in EST libraries and differentially expressed dur-

ing M. perniciosa development [20], indicates that they are
active elements, which could contribute to genetic variability. Among the M. perniciosa TE families, Gypsy-like retrotransposons were the most abundant, followed by
Copia-like retrotransposons (Tables 4 and 5; Additional
File 2; Additional File 3 – Worksheet Transposons). TEs
similar to P. chrysosporium Copia-like elements were found
in M. perniciosa genome inserted within putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes [66]. Curiously, they
were also inserted in a P. chrysosporium cytochrome P450
monooxygenase subfamily (Additional file 2 – family
255; Additional File 3 – Worksheet P450), suggesting that
these TEs may have a common ancestral origin in Basidiomycota. Retroelements of the tyrosine recombinase (YR)
order [67] and DNA transposons (class II transposons)
from CACTA [68], hATC [69,70] and Tc/Mariner [71]
superfamilies were also found. Finally, a previously
described Boto DNA transposon [M.V. Queiroz et al.,
unpublished data] from the PIF/IS5 superfamily [72] was
also identified in a MCL family (Additional File 2 – family
251; Additional File 3 – Worksheet Transposons).
Plant Hormonal Disarrangement: Fungal genes related to
plant hormones biosynthesis
There is growing evidence of phytohormones being produced by pathogens during some infective processes [73].
For instance, the production of gibberellins (GA); hormones involved in the regulation of stem elongation, seed
germination, flowering and fruit maturation; have been
identified in phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi that
cause overgrowth symptoms, such as Giberella fujikuroi
and Sphaceloma manhiticola [74,75]. A search for homologues of the fungal specific bi-functional ent-kaurene
synthase (CPS/KS) responsible for the two-step cyclation
of GGDP in fungi [76] identified gene models similar to
the N-terminal domain of G. fujikuroi CPS/KS but did not
detect any sequence similar to the C-terminal domain of
this protein in M. perniciosa. Another gene model similar
to CPS/KS that lacks the C-terminal domain was found in
the Aspergillus niger genome (AM270241.1). Genes similar
to GA-4 desaturase and GA oxidases (cytochrome P450),
part of a GA biosynthesis gene cluster present in G.
fujikuroi and Phaeosphaeria sp. were detected (Additional
File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation). Reinforcing
our data mining discover, is the fact that a gibberellin-like
compound was detected in basidiospores of M. perniciosa
[77]. We can theorize that the production of GA by M. perniciosa may confer the hyperplasic phenotype of the green
broom that resembles stem hyper-elongation caused by
GA-producing phytopathogens.

Another interesting discovery in the M. perniciosa genome
is the presence of genes encoding enzymes of two biosynthetic pathways of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the most
abundant natural plant auxin. We found a gene similar to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

plant nitrilases (E.C 3.5.5.1) which catalyzes the direct
conversion of indole-3-acetonitrile into ammonia and
IAA. Additionally, potential genes for the IAA-producing
tryptamine pathway (one tryptophan decarboxylase, copper amine oxidases and a hypothetical indole-acetaldehyde oxidase) were found (Fig. 6; Additional File 3 –
Worksheet Functional Annotation). Furthermore, a manual annotation of EST libraries reveal the presence of an
aromatic amino acid aminotransferase, which could make
part of Indole-3-pyruvate IAA biosynthetic pathway (Fig.
6). IAA regulates many plant biological processes including cell elongation and fruit ripening. Recently, the presence of IAA in M. perniciosa basidiocarps was reported
[78]. IAA is produced by other fungal phytopathogens
such as biotrophics U. maydis and Taphrina deformans and
hemibiotrophic Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sp. [79-81],
and induces filamentation and invasive growth in S. cerevisiae [82]. Curiously, both Gibberellin and IAA induce
fruit parthenocarpy and act synergistically in plant organ
expansion [83], both of which are traits of WBD.
Cacao plantlets inoculated with M. perniciosa spores emit
higher levels of ethylene during the late stages of infection
than non-inoculated plants [13]. The plant hormone ethylene stimulates elongation at low concentrations, and
senescence, fruit ripening, and epinasty at high doses [84].
Auxins stimulate the synthesis of ethylene [85], which
together with gibberellins have integrated actions in plant
cell death [86] and stem elongation during phytochromemediated shade avoidance, a phenomenon that occurs in
response to the low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) under
dense canopies [87]. We hypothesize that in a dense and
shaded environment, such as a cacao plantation, the low
R:FR ratio effects can be increased by the action of the
aforementioned phytohormones, explaining the shade

avoidance, hypertrophy, and elongation of green brooms.
The presence of genes related to plant hormones production in M. perniciosa supports previous data [77,78] and
suggests that this fungus can influence the plant metabolism and defense, by altering hormonal balance during
infection [73,88].
Pathogenicity: Fungal effectors and pathogenicity
associated proteins
As a pathogen that colonizes the plant apoplast during its
biotrophic stage, M. perniciosa may release elicitor or effector proteins into the extracellular medium, which in turn
could evade or suppress the plant defense response.
Throughout WBD, M. perniciosa produces proteins with
the potential to kill plant cells, thereby releasing their contents, which are absorbed by the fungus during its saprotrophic stage. Thus, M. perniciosa uses a varied arsenal of
effector proteins in order to complete its infection cycle.
Although some phytopathogenic fungi deliver effector
proteins into the cytoplasm by means of haustoria [89,90]
this type of structure is absent in M. perniciosa. Therefore it
is possible that this fungus secretes these proteins into the
apoplast, as has been described for other fungi [91]. Effector proteins that are recognized by plant resistance (R)
proteins are known as avr proteins. No orthologues to the
known Ascomycota avr genes, not even the U. maydis
genes contained in "biotrophic clusters" [92], were found
in the genome of M. perniciosa. However, ab initio gene
prediction with peptide signal analysis revealed 70 "no
hits" small proteins containing secretion signals and at
least two cysteines (see methods, Additional File 6),
which is a common trait of many proteins that are delivered into the host apoplast by phytopathogens [93]. In
order to validate 22 selected ab initio predictions, we conducted RT-PCR using RNA from M. perniciosa saprotrophic mycelia. We validated the expression of 13 gene
models out of 22 tested, all of which contained secretion
signals (Additional File 7 – Primers No Hits Cys protein).
Possibly, the gene models that were not confirmed by RTPCR are expressed in other developmental stages of the
fungus (basidiome, spore, etc.). Additional File 8 depicts
the amplification of three of these genes. Whether these
proteins play a role in the pathogenicity of M. perniciosa or
in elicitation of cacao defense remains to be elucidated.

M. perniciosa contains Necrosis and Ethylene inducing
proteins (NEPs) and cerato platanins [19,94], which can
act in conjunction with a series of proteinases, hemolysinlike proteins and carboxylesterases/lipases found in the
genome (Additional File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation). These proteins appear to be part of the destructive
arsenal of M. perniciosa. The most abundant proteinases
in the genome of M. perniciosa are deuterolysins, a type of
fungal metalloproteinases that are similar to bacterial
thermolysin [95]. Compared to other fungi indicates that
M. perniciosa has a deuterolysin expansion (13 gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

models; Fig. 5A; Additional File 4), suggesting an important role for these proteinases during this fungus development.
We also identified a gene family similar to agaricales Pleurotus ostreatus and Agrocybe aegerita hemolysin-like aegerolysins. These proteins have cytolitic properties [96] and
seems to play an important role at the initial phase of fungal fruiting by making the fungal membranes permeable
during cell signaling [96]. M. perniciosa genome contain a
family of aegerolysins (6 aegerolysins; Fig. 5A; Additional
File 4). None of the other agaricales fungi analyzed (L.
bicolor, C. cinerea and P. chrysosporium) contain these proteins. Even though we could not assess the genomic data
of the basidiomycete containing aegerolysins, we suggest
that the diversification of these proteins in WBD causative
agent indicates their importance in M. perniciosa development or even in fungi defense and infective process.
Carboxyesterases and lipases are overrepresented in M.
perniciosa (Tables 4 and 5; Additional Files 2 and 4).
According to CDD-PFAM, M. perniciosa have 38 gene
models annotated as carboxylesterases, approximately
twice the number of such proteins in other basidiomycete
(ectomycorrhizal L. bicolor (15); saprobes C. cinerea (19)
and P. crhysosporium (14); and biotrophic U. maydis (12);
Figure 5A; Additional File 3); while the hemibiotrophic
ascomycete F. graminearum and M. grisea have 40 and 29
carboxylesterases, respectively. We postulate that the great
number of carboxylesterases and lipases in M. perniciosa,
F. graminearum and M. grisea is related to their hemibiotrophic lifestyle. In fact, these enzymes are induced during
carbon and nitrogen starvation [97], and cell wall degradation [98], two events that occur during hemibiotrophism.
Other genes associated with the plant-pathogen interaction found in our analysis were similar to the SCP-like
superfamily proteins, which comprise pathogenesis
related (PR) proteins of family 1 (PR-1). Additionally,
gene models similar to PR-5/thaumatin superfamily were
also detected in the M. perniciosa genome (Additional File
3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation). PR proteins are
well described as associated with defense reactions in
plants against various pathogens [99]. For instance, transgenic plants overexpressing PR-1 proteins were more
resistant to oomycete infection [100] and some Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) have β-glucanase activity, inhibit
xylanase and have antifungal properties [101-103].
Recently, proteins similar to PR-1 and thaumatin have
been characterized in animals and fungi [104,105], indicating a conserved and important role in diverse organisms. Based on CDD-PFAM analysis, M. perniciosa
contains the largest number of thaumatins of any fungus
sequenced, so far (7 thaumatins, Fig. 5A; Additional File
4).

Both PR-1 and PR-5 are induced by salicylic acid (SA) in
plants [99]. Curiously, the M. perniciosa necrotrophic
(saprotrophic) mycelia were found to produce and have
tolerance to SA in axenic cultures [70]. Plants with WBD
have a higher content of SA when compared with healthy
plants [106]. M. perniciosa tolerance to SA could be
explained by the expression of genes encoding salicylate
hydroxylases, which were also detected in the genome
(Additional File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation).
In this scenario, high levels of SA could block the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), a defense compound against
necrotrophic pathogens that acts as a necrosis inducer,
thus rendering the plant susceptible to the spread of M.
perniciosa [78,106]. In addition, it is possible that SA and
SA-induced proteins (i.e., PR-1, PR-5) may act to limit
competition from other microbial competitors during
WBD progression, which would be an important component of the M. perniciosa pathogenicity strategy.
Colonization: Plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDE)
Degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, pectin and depolymerization of lignin are some of the mechanisms that
necrotrophic fungi use to colonize plant tissues [107]. We
identified genes encoding enzymes involved in degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose, including β-1,4 cellulases, exocellobiohydrolases, endo-beta-1,4-xylanases and
endoglucanases; genes encoding lignolytic enzymes
including manganese dependent peroxidase and multicopper polyphenoloxidases (laccases); and genes encoding enzymes involved in pectin degradation, such as
pectate lyases, polygalacturonases (pectinases) and pectin
methylesterases (pectinesterase) (Additional File 3 –
Worksheet Functional Annotation). M. perniciosa have an
arsenal of plant cell wall degrading enzymes that is similar
to that found in the hemibiotrophic pathogens F. graminearum and M. grisea (Fig. 5B; Additional File 9). Biotrophic
U. maydis and symbiont L. bicolor have a minimal set of
PCWDEs what is in accordance with their lifestyle (Fig.
5B; Additional File 9).

Pectate lyases (PL1 and PL3 according to CAZy nomenclature – http://www.cazy.org) cleave pectin, an essential
component of plant cell walls. Among the fungi analyzed,
F. graminearum and M. perniciosa contain the largest
number of PLs (Fig. 5B; Additional File 9). Unlike M. grisea, the other hemibiotrophic analyzed, F. graminearum
and M. perniciosa does not have specialized structures
(appressoria) for non-enzymatic penetration of plants,
and colonizing the apoplast by breaching the middle
lamella barrier (Fig. 7). In addition, both are able to infect
dicotyledons that contain cell walls with larger amounts
of pectin than monocots [108]. This analysis suggests that
PLs have an important role for pathogens that colonize
the apoplast of dicotyledons.

Insights into M. perniciosa intermediary metabolism and
WBD development
Pathogen energy status and the acquisition of host metabolic compounds by the pathogen are factors that determine the outcome of disease onset. Therefore, enzymes of
M. perniciosa involved in intermediary metabolism (i.e.,
reactions concerned with storing and generating metabolic energy) may have an important role during WBD
(Additional File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation).
During the first stages of WBD, M. perniciosa may encounter a nutrient-poor and extreme oxidative environment
containing host defense molecules, such as nitric oxide
(NO), an inhibitor of the cytochrome respiratory pathway
[109]. Under these conditions, the activity of a NO tolerant alternative oxidase (AOX) may constitute a critical
bypass mechanism for the cytochrome pathway [110112]. A single copy of AOX was detected in M. perniciosa,
and preliminary experiments indicate that this gene has a
higher expression in fungi grown in nutrient-poor media
(data not shown).

Following this scenario, in the low-energy status represented by the biotrophic phase, AOX may provide NAD+
for the turnover of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid
cycle (TCA) and the peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle (GLOX).
Many reports have documented the importance of GLOX
for phytopathogens during host infection [113-115]. All
genes coding for proteins of this enzymatic pathway are
present in the genomeof M. perniciosa, including the key
enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (Additional
File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation).
Curiously, M. perniciosa is able to use methanol as the
only carbon source (data not shown), indicating that this
fungus may have a methylotrophic metabolism. Methylotrophism have been extensively studied in methylotrophic yeasts such as Pichia angusta and recently
methanol oxidases (MOX) have been described in filamentous fungi such as C. fulvum [116] and wood-degrading basidiomycete Gloephyllum trabeum [117]. A gene
encoding a MOX was identified in M. perniciosa genome
(Additional File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation).
Interestingly, this gene was previously detected as being
overexpressed in biotrophic-mycelia [20]. The methanol
catabolism enzymes formaldehyde dehydrogenase and
formate dehydrogenase (Additional File 3 – Worksheet
Functional Annotation) were also found in the genome,
which provides evidence that M. perniciosa indeed hydrolyzes methanol. Methanol is, possibly, derived from the
first step of pectin hydrolyzation performed by the cell
wall degrading enzyme pectin methylesterase [118], or
from demethylation of lignin that occurs after manganese
peroxidase and/or laccase action [117]. We can not discount the possibility that the biotrophic fungi can use the
methanol produced by pectin metabolism during normal

cell wall synthesis in early stages of plant expansion [119].
The possibility that M. perniciosa is methylotrophic resembles the methylobacteria nutritional strategy, which provides an ecological advantage over non-methylotrophic
microorganisms present in the phyllosphere [120].
Previous data indicated that the utilization of glycerol,
instead of fermentable sugars (i.e., glucose), is an important environmental clue for the maintenance of the biotrophic stage [18,121]. Accordingly, our group detected
higher amounts of glycerol during the biotrophic fungal
phase of the green brooms development than in dry
brooms [13]. Additionally, in vitro assays showed that the

shift from glucose to glycerol media increased anti-oxidative defenses of M. perniciosa mycelia [122]. This result
correlates well with green broom environment (high content of glycerol and ROS) raising the possibility that glycerol is a critical metabolite during the initial stages of the
disease cycle. Genes involved in glycerol metabolism and
uptake are present in M. perniciosa, including a biotrophic
induced aquaglyceroporin transporter [20] (Additional
File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation), suggesting
that this fungus is able to acquire extracellular glycerol.
After 35 days of WBD, glucose levels increase again, concomitant with a reduction in starch levels [13]. We found
Page 16 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:548

a gene model similar to a secreted glucoamylase in the M.
perniciosa genome (Additional File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation). Gibberellin is an inducer of α-amylase production [123]. We can envisage a disease scenario
in which the fungus produces an extracellular amylase
and hormones (i.e., gibberellin) that triggers plant amylolytic activity, which then decrease starch content. The
resulting glucose can be utilized by the plant since at this
stage the green brooms/infected tissues are rapidly growing or even be acquired by the pathogen at the transition
phase between biotrophic and necrotrophic stages.
Nitrogen starvation also appears to be a factor that influences the biotrophic lifestyle [124] and is associated with
the expression of pathogenicity genes and PCWDE,
mainly in hemibiotrophic and biotrophic fungi that deal
with nutrient deprivation during early infection [125].
Our data from microarray and EST analysis suggests that
nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) occurs in M. perniciosa by the induction of GABA permease, tRNA synthetates
and AROM protein [20]. As reported previously [20]M.
perniciosa contains a gene homologous to CLNR1 from the
hemibiotrophic fungus C. lindemuthianum (Additional
File 3 – Worksheet Functional Annotation), a global nitrogen regulator that belongs to the AREA/NIT2 family.
CLNR1 activates enzymes and transporters that enable
uptake and catabolism of secondary nitrogen sources
[126]. The depletion of CLNR1 impaired the fungal switch
to necrotrophy [124], emphasizing the importance of
nitrogen catabolism in hemibiotrophic development. Our
genomic data mining identified a gene similar to NPR2,
which encodes a regulatory protein that may act upstream
of the AREA/NIT2 protein (Additional File 3 – Worksheet
Functional Annotation). NPR2 is required for the expression of the M. grisea pathogenicity gene MPG1 [127]. In
addition, genes that encode enzymes involved in alternative nitrogen sources uptake (i.e., GABA transporter, urea
permease and nitrate transporter) and metabolism (i.e.,
urease, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, arginase and
uricase) were identified (Additional File 3 – Worksheet
Functional Annotation). The presence of such genes in M.
perniciosa genome indicates that this fungus could allocate
and utilize alternative nitrogen sources in the absence of
preferential nitrogen sources (glutamine and ammonia)
reinforcing our hypothesis that M. perniciosa suffers NCR
during early stages of WBD.

Conclusion
Our analysis of the M. perniciosa genome survey yielded
interesting insights and clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying WBD. As far as we know, this is the first
phytopathogen included in the order Agaricales
sequenced. Therefore, our results support the investigation of pathogenicity mechanisms among Agaricales and
Basidiomycete. In addition, we provide an approach for
normalization of gene family data in a genome survey that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

can aid the genomics community interested in functional
analysis in incomplete genome data.
Based on annotated fungal genes from this report and
from previous other studies, we designed a hypothetical
model for WBD that correlates plant phenotype changes
that happen during the disease with the developmental
progression of M. perniciosa (Fig. 7).
After penetration and adhesion to the plant, the biotrophic fungus slowly grows inside the apoplast causing a
series of phenotype changes in cacao, such as hypertrophy
and hyperplasia, phototropism and epinasty, by secreting
phytohormones that unbalance cacao metabolism (Fig 7A
and 7B). In addition, M. perniciosa has to deal with nitrogen deprivation in the apoplast, which signals the production of proteins related to the acquisition of alternative
nutrient sources, proteolysis and amino acid synthesis.
Furthermore, the fungus takes advantage of the increasing
content of glycerol in the green broom, an important cue
for biotrophic stage maintenance, by expressing aquaglyceroporins. As previously discussed [13], the starch accumulated in early stages of green brooms seems to be
metabolized to glucose, which suggests an amylolytic
activity exerted by fungi and/or by plant amylases. This
increase of glucose is not accompanied by an increase of
fructose, but by a sucrose augmentation. Since photosynthesis is not increased during WBD, we suggest that
sucrose is translocated from other tissues to the green
brooms. Therefore, we hypothesize that these mechanisms cause a source-to-sink transition in stem, turning
green brooms into a drain of nutrients.
After numerous physiological and biochemical changes in
the plant, which may be caused by the fungal infection,
there occurs a transition from the biotrophic to the saprotrophic lifestyle (Fig. 7C and 7D). This change could result
from the increase of nutrients in the fungal environment
and may be controlled by an AREA/NIT2-like regulator.
During this transition phase, the plant displays the beginning of necrosis at the distal portion of the leaves that
could be due to the action of NEPs and cerato-platanins
that are expressed in the biotrophic hyphae. In addition,
M. perniciosa produces PCWDEs, such as pectinases,
whose action aids the fungus in breaching the middle
lamella barrier. Pectin degradation releases methanol,
which in turn could be used by M. perniciosa as a carbon
source, through the action of a MOX and other methanol
metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, the calcium released
from pectin disruption could be scavenged by the oxalate
synthesized by the fungus, a compound that triggers cell
death. The release of cell content during necrosis, and the
probable aforementioned source-to-sink transition, may
influence, or even be indispensable to the M. perniciosa
switch from biotrophism to saprotrophism. Thus, the
postulated carbon and nitrogen catabolite repression disPage 17 of 25

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:548

played by the biotrophic mycelia would be switched off,
thus causing the mycelial change to its invasive dikaryotic/saprotrophic stage.
During disease progression, and mainly during colonization of saprotrophic hyphae, M. perniciosa must deal with
an intense oxidative environment. Based on our analysis
this stress can be overcome by the action of several antioxidative and detoxifying enzymes. Furthermore, we
believe that M. perniciosa exerts a negative control on plant
defense against necrotrophic/saprotrophic fungi by producing salicylic acid, which would limit competition by
other fungi by the action of antifungal proteins. Finally,
after alternating wet and dry periods, the formation of the
basidiomes produced by saprotrophic hyphae occurs.
Latin American cacao crops suffer tremendous damages
caused by WBD, which mainly affects small acreage farmers. Such impact in the relatively primitive cacao cultivation system not only affects the socio-economic status of
farmers but also the preservation of the rainforest. The
demand for strategies that limit cacao diseases requires an
intense effort in understanding the pathogenicity and
plant resistance mechanisms. Further sequencing projects
of cacao and its pathogens will serve as a background for
the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics of these species in a systems biology approach.
Such initiatives will provide tools for biological control,
crop management and cacao biotechnology to combat
cacao diseases. We believe that our report is the first step
towards such an integrative initiative and provides
insights into the molecular mechanisms of WBD which
can aid the cacao's WBD-concerned community to
develop control strategies for this plant-fungus interaction.

Methods
Biological material, libraries construction and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from saprotrophic hyphae of M.
perniciosa strain FA553 (CP02) maintained in Malt Yeast
Extract Agar (Difco) at 27°C. DNA was extracted from
grounded mycelia by incubation in CTAB buffer (CTAB
3%, NaCl 1.4 M, EDTA 20 mM pH 8.0, Tris-HCl 10 mM
pH 8.0, PVP 1.0%, β-mercaptoethanol 0.2%) at 65°C during 30 min; followed by one phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (25/24/1) wash, precipitation with sodium acetate pH 5.2 (0.1 Vol) and cold 100% ethanol (2 Vol).
DNA was eluted in deionized water and sheared by nebulization and sonication into fragments of approximately
2 Kbp, which were size selected on agarose gels and purified with S.N.A.P. Gel Purification Kit (Invitrogen – Life
technologies, USA). DNA fragments were blunt-end
ligated into the pCR4Blunt plasmid (Invitrogen – Life
technologies, USA). Approximately 50 genomic libraries
were constructed, each one corresponding to individually

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

growing cultures. Sequencing was done in an ABI Prism
3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Clustering
The resulting chromatograms were submitted to the M.
perniciosa database and subjected to automatic base calling using the software PHRED [128]. The contaminating
vector sequences and low quality shotgun reads, without
at least 100 bp with phred note ≥ 16 were trimmed by
using the program LUCY [129]. Shotgun reads showing
significant sequence similarity (BLASTn, E-value ≥ 1E-30)
with M. perniciosa mitochondrial sequences (see above)
were removed from subsequent assemblies. The clustering
and assembly were performed using the software PHRAP
http://www.phrap.org. Afterwards, low quality regions of
singlets previously evaluated by LUCY (the last window of
10 bp that has an average probability of error given by
phred ≤ 10) were trimmed. The remaining clusters were
subjected to similarity searches against the NCBI nonredundant protein and nucleotide database using the
BLASTx and tBLASTx, respectively, with an E-value cutoff
of 1E-5.
Genome Length Statistical Validations
Statistical analyses of the genome length were performed
using two approaches. The first one was based on the Dog
genome survey using counting of start positions offsets for
overlapping reads [31] (for further details see Additional
File 1). The second was based on Lander Waterman Theory, [34] and their applications [35,36], which estimate
the theoretical values of expected number of clusters (contigs + singlets), contigs, gaps, average cluster size and average gap size, using the effective average read length (L),
the total number of reads in the assembly (N) and the estimated genome size (G). L is the average number of base
pairs of a read that contributes to the contig through parsing of ace file http://www.phrap.org. In our analysis L was
equal to 550 bp. In order to estimate the gap size distribution in the M. perniciosa genome survey, we performed a
comparison between a set of eukaryotic core protein (generated by CEGMA pipeline [37]) and M. perniciosa contigs
using TBLASTN with threshold of 1e-10 for the E-value
(Further details in Additional File 1). The estimation of
misassembled sequences due to repetitive regions in the
genome was performed using the integrated pipeline
amosvalidate [38] (Further details in Additional File 1).
Gene Finding
EST against genome alignments
The alignment of ESTs with genomic sequences was performed using the package GeneSeqer [130] with the prebuilt Aspergillus intron model. 300 highly confident
introns were selected and used as an input for Exalin program [39] that is able to build a splice site model for an
organism. The positions of the splice sites as assigned by

Exalin were used to rank overlapping gene predictions
(see below).

grams in a dataset of 60 genes structures visually
inspected.

Ab initio gene models prediction
The ab initio gene models prediction was performed with
the trainable, open source gene predictors AUGUSTUS
[40], SNAP [41] and GENEZILLA [42]. Ten copies of an
artificial sequence of 240 Kbp (total of 2.4 Mbp) formed
by the concatenation of the M. perniciosa ESTs coding
regions, together with a C. cinerea gene dataset containing
1.2 Mbp were submitted to "pre-training" in AUGUSTUS
gene predictor. M. perniciosa resulting predictions were
compared with the protein databank NR using BLASTp.
The predictions with similarities in NR, and with coverage
≥ 90%, were selected. After redundancy elimination, M.
perniciosa gene models were used to train the three gene
finders aforementioned. Predictions with less than 30
amino acids were eliminated, and the remaining predictions were grouped in overlapping clusters.

A final filter discarded gene predictions reported by only
one program, without similarity to known proteins and
without EST evidence.

Ab initio gene models ranking
The predictions in each overlapping cluster were ranked
according to the criteria used by the Fungal Genome Initiative at Broad institute http://www.broad.mit.edu. In each
cluster, the "best" ab initio gene model according to the
stipulated criteria was selected for functional annotation.
The criteria for the ranking of the gene models were the
following:

1. Manual annotation had priority over all other evidences;
2. Predictions with EST evidences had priority over the
predictions without EST evidences;
3. If two predictions had EST evidences, the one with
more splice sites in exact agreement with ESTs had priority;
4. Prediction with similarities with known proteins had
priority. A prediction was considered to be similar to
some known protein if it had an E-value of at most 1e-10
(BLASTP against NR+Phanerochaete chrysosporium protein
set);
5. If two predictions had similarity with known proteins,
the one with better coverage score had priority. The coverage score was defined as 2 × CP × CH/(CP+CH), where CP
is the coverage of the prediction and CH is the coverage of
the similar protein;
6. In clusters without similarity with known proteins and
without EST evidence, the priority was for AUGUSTUS,
SNAP and GENEZILLA, in this order. This criterion was
chosen according to the performance of the three pro-

Extrinsic gene models prediction
The extrinsic gene model predictions were performed by
two methodologies. First, 17,991 contigs and 7,065 singlets were submitted to similarity analysis in a databank
containing BLASTX-NR plus Phanerochaete chrysosporium
proteins. The genomic regions containing homologues in
this databank were selected and assigned as putative gene
models. GenomeThreader [131] program was used to
make protein-DNA spliced alignments between the
BLAST first hit against and the genomic sequence, serving
as a guide to delimit the start and stop codons and exonintron boundaries of the regions of the contigs containing
similarity with GenBank.

Concurrently, M. perniciosa ESTs aligned with genomic
clusters (see above) were inspected to verify if the region
in which they aligned contained a BLAST extrinsic prediction gene model. These extrinsic gene models (EST and
BLAST) were compared with each other to evaluate the
amount of gene models predicted by these methods. After
these comparisons, the extrinsic gene models were
divided into 4 datasets:
(i) ESTMODELS: retrieved from the spliced alignments of
the ESTs against the genomic clusters not covered to a
BLAST extrinsic gene models prediction. Low score spliced
alignments and ESTs that seen clearly to be UTR of a
neighboring prediction were not included.
(ii) BLASTMODELS: derived from BLAST extrinsic gene
models predictions analysis covering genomic regions
without EST evidence.
(iii) COMBINEDMODELS: gene models derived from
genomic sequence regions with BLAST hit and EST evidence.
(iv) CURATEDMODELS: extrinsic predictions manually
annotated for manual correction of merged or split predictions. The genomic survey and gene models nomenclature are depicted in additional file 10.
tRNA prediction
For tRNA prediction, the tRNAscan-SE program [132] was
taken into account with the default parameters, which
searched for conserved sequences and the characteristic
secondary structure of tRNAs.

MCL-families clustering
MCL graph clustering algorithm was applied to generate
M. perniciosa gene families using WU-TBLASTx "all against
all" as the tool used for aligning the gene models [43].
Normalization of gene family data
The normalization of gene family data was performed by
comparison between C. cinerea proteins and M. perniciosa
gene models, using TBLASTN with 1E-10 of E-value
threshold. The number of gene models similar to a C. cinerea protein was plotted according to protein length. The
equation that estimates the number of gene models representing the same protein was generated using linear
regression fitting. This equation was used to estimate a
normalization factor to each MCL family and CDD-PFAM
domain according to the average of protein length of their
members.
Automatic Annotation and Metabolic Maps
The automatic annotation program AutoFACT [47] was
used for functional annotation of gene models. The set of
coding sequences from gene models were submitted to
similarity searches against the UNIREF100, UNIREF90,
NR, and KEGG databases using BLASTx (E-value ≤ 1E-5)
and against CDD-PFAM using RPS-BLAST (E-value ≤ 1E5) [48]. These results were submitted to AutoFACT, which
searches for a consensus in the results and output descriptions and statistics about protein domains and families.

For an inference of M. perniciosa metabolic maps, we used
Pathway Tools (version 11.0), a software of BioCyc databases [49], which generates a metabolic map from a previously annotated genome. The pathways that are
probably present in the genome are imported from a reference database, following the Pathway Tools parameters
[133]. The annotated genome input was obtained from
EST manual annotation and from M. perniciosa gene models AutoFACT annotation, using as main information the
product name and, if available, E.C. numbers. Metabolic
pathways of interest were manually annotated for the
elimination of false positives.
The analysis of transporters was made based on a BLASTX
search of M. perniciosa gene models and other fungal
genes against TCDB (Transport Classification Database –
http://www.tcdb.org), using a threshold of E-value 1E-05.
All classes from third level that contained at least one species with 2% or more of representations were separately
represented in the results.
Selection and expression confirmation of no hits ab initio
gene models
The selection of ab initio gene models was performed
using a SQL query wizard. As input, we ask for gene models without similarity in GenBank NR, which encoded

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/548

proteins that contained at least 2 cysteines and a signal
peptide, previously identified by Signal-P 3.0 program
[134]. 74 gene models were then selected and their nucleotide sequences were used as template for the design of
primers nested in: (i) the sequence encoding the putative
signal peptide (SPE); (ii) the sequence encoding the putative first amino acid of mature protein (MAT) and; (iii)
the sequence containing the putative stop codon (END).
The latter was designed in reverse complement ("reverse")
to allow gene amplification using the other two primers
("forward"). RT-PCR analysis was performed to validate
the expression of ab initio predicted gene models. RNA
from saprotrophic mycelia was extracted using hot-phenol method with modifications [135]. Equal amounts of
total RNA from CP02 saprotrophic mycelia cultures (24 h,
48 h, 4 days and 7 days) were mixed. After DNase (Invitrogen, USA) treatment, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript RTII (Invitrogen, USA) in a total
volume of 20 μL, following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were conducted according to primers
(MWG, Imprint Genetics Corp) temperature of melting
(TMs).

MCL analysis of M. perniciosa gene models. All predicted proteins were
compared all-against-all using WU-TBLASTX. A score (-log (E-value))
for each pair of proteins (u, v) with significant BLAST hits (Evalue 1e5) was assigned. The MCL algorithm (inflation parameter 2.0) was
applied to find clusters in this graph. This method is fully automatic and
protein clusters reported were not subjected to manual curation. ID:
number of the MCL family; #members: number of gene models present in
each family; Norm factor: factor used to normalize the number of gene
models present in each family (see methods); Norm#members: normalized number of gene models present in each family. Annotation: words
associated to each family after correlation of gene models with AutoFACT
annotation. In parenthesis are the occurrence numbers of each word. Each
worksheet shows the ranking of families using normalization factor
(Rank_Norm) or not using this factor (Rank_Non_Norm).
