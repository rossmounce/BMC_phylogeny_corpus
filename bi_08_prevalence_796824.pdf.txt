Abstract
Background: Unisexual salamanders of the genus Ambystoma exemplify the most ancient lineage
of unisexual vertebrates and demonstrate an extremely flexible reproductive system. Unisexual
Ambystoma interact with and incorporate genomes from two to four sexual species (A. laterale, A.
jeffersonianum,A. texanum, and A. tigrinum), to generate more than 20 genome compositions or
biotypes. Unisexual ploidy levels range from diploid to pentaploid, but all contain at least one A.
laterale (L) genome. Replacement of nuclear genomes might be responsible for the evolutionary
longevity of unisexual Ambystoma but direct evidence for the prevalence of genome replacement in
natural populations is absent. Two major puzzling questions have remained unanswered over the
last few decades: 1) is genome replacement a common reproductive method in various unisexual
populations and, 2) is there an ancient "L" genome that persists in various unisexual genome
compositions.
Results: We examined 194 unisexual and 89 A. laterale specimens from 97 localities throughout
their range and constructed a genealogy of the "L" genomes using a nuclear DNA marker (LG1C12) to answer the above questions. Six L-G1C12 haplotypes (A-F) were shared by individuals
in various A. laterale and unisexual populations. The general geographical distribution of the
haplotypes in unisexual populations conformed to those found in A. laterale, indicating that "L"
genomes in unisexuals are obtained from sympatric or nearby populations of A. laterale.
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that genome replacement frequently occurs in unisexual
Ambystoma across their range, and support previous speculations that genome replacement is an
important reproductive mechanism that can enhance their evolutionary longevity. Our results
show that there is no ancient "L" genome in the unisexual lineages, and no particular "L" genome
is favored in any unisexual individual. The presence of an "L" genome in all unisexuals implies that
it is important to the maintenance of unisexuals. Nuclear gene genealogy is a powerful tool to
examine the historical interaction between sperm-dependent unisexuals and their sexual sperm
donors. This methodology could be applicable to many other unisexual lineages to improve our
understanding of their reproduction and their ability to persist.

Background
The evolution of sexuality versus asexuality has been the
focus of considerable attention for decades. Although sexuality is ubiquitous in animals, unisexual reproduction
has independently evolved in various unrelated lineages
[1-3]. The existence of ancient unisexuals, regardless of
their rarity, poses a dilemma for evolutionary biologists
because a lack of genetic recombination should, theoretically, cause unisexuals to be short-lived [4-10]. From a single hybrid origin, unisexual salamanders in the genus
Ambystoma have survived for 2.4–3.9 million years [11],
representing the most ancient known unisexual vertebrate
lineage [12,13]. Unisexual Ambystoma have a unique,
while extremely flexible, reproductive system which is
described as kleptogenesis [11]. Female kleptogens usually produce unreduced eggs through premeiotic endomitosis [14], and sperm from sympatric sexual males is
required to activate the eggs without fertilization (termed
gynogenesis). But, a sperm nucleus can be incorporated to
elevate the ploidy (termed ploidy elevation) or to replace
one of the nuclear genomes in a developing offspring
(termed genome replacement) [1]. Unisexual individuals
interact with and "steal" chromosomes from two to four
sympatric sexual species (A. laterale (LL), A. jeffersonianum
(JJ), A. texanum (TT), and A. tigrinum (TiTi)), and more
than 20 distinct diploid, triploid, tetraploid and pentaploid genome compositions are known to exist [15].
Among these reproductive mechanisms, genome replacement may be responsible for the apparent evolutionary
longevity of unisexual Ambystoma [12,16,17].
Although the evolutionary significance of genome
replacement in unisexual Ambystoma is acknowledged,
empirical evidence for its prevalence in natural populations is absent. An ancient genome replacement event was
proposed using a phylogenetic approach [15]. All the unisexual Ambystoma, irrespective of their genome compositions, share an almost identical mitochondrial genome
that is distinctly different from any of the four "parental"
species, excluding all of them as candidates for a maternal
ancestor. The sequence of unisexual mtDNA is most
closely related to that in specimens of A. barbouri ("BB")
from Kentucky, suggesting that A. barbouri and all unisexual salamanders share a close common maternal ancestor.
However, the "B" nuclear genome was completely
replaced, but left its mitochondrial genome behind [11].
Nevertheless, the existence of genome replacement was
questioned by Spolsky et al. [13,16]. They found no evidence supporting genome replacement in a few A. texanum-dependent LJJ populations in central Indiana and
northeastern Illinois so they believed that genome
replacement in unisexual Ambystoma is very uncommon
in nature. But, they acknowledged the potential importance of genome replacement for long-term survival of
unisexual Ambystoma. Previous studies using isozyme elec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/158

trophoresis, DNA microsatellite and cytogenetic analyses
had been carried out to try to document the actual occurrence of genome replacement in a few unisexual populations [11,18-24]. All these studies present discrete
evidence that demonstrate the possible rare occurrence of
genome replacement but the methods used were insufficient to document genome replacement across a large
number of unisexual populations. As a consequence,
none of those studies provide conclusive empirical evidence about the frequency or commonality of genome
replacement in unisexual Ambystoma. To better document
to what extent genome replacement takes place in this old
lineage, nuclear gene genealogy between sexual species
and their corresponding genomic contributions in various
unisexual populations across the range could be the key to
understand this process.
Despite the presence of genome replacement, all known
unisexual Ambystoma, irrespective of their genome compositions, contain at least one "L" genome, even in those
populations where no A. laterale have ever been discovered [25]. The conservation of an "L" genome in every unisexual is a mystery. It was hypothesized that hybridization
between a female A. barbouri and a male A. laterale gave
rise to an ancestral genome composition "BL" that initiated a unisexual linage. Subsequently, early in the history
of unisexual linage, the "B" genome was replaced by
genomes from other sperm donors, but the ancient paternal "L" genome may have been maintained [15]. Recent
evidence contradicted this hypothesis [11]. DNA microsatellite loci demonstrated that, in one population from
southern Ontario, no common genome is transmitted in
a clonal or hemiclonal fashion in unisexuals, and that
there is not a single "L" genome that could be considered
ancestral or frozen in all unisexuals [11]. Nevertheless,
additional empirical evidence is required for many other
unisexual populations with respect to whether there exists
a particular "L" genome that is always favored and trapped
in unisexual individuals, and is somehow protected from
genome replacement.
Directly examining the genealogical relationships of the
"L" genomes within the unisexual and sexual lineages provides a rapid way to answer the following two fundamentally important questions. First, is genome replacement a
common or sporadic event during the evolution of unisexual Ambystoma lineages? If it is rare, we would expect
that most "L" genomes in unisexual lineages would be
more closely related to each other than to respective sympatric A. laterale. Second, is there a particular "L" genome
that is frozen in unisexual populations across their distributional range? If there is, we would expect that one "L"
genome found in individual unisexuals from distant populations would group together and have a more basal
position on the "L" genome tree. In this study, we chose a

highly variable DNA fragment from a nuclear gene intron
as a marker, designed specific primers that only amplified
the fragment in the "L" genome in various unisexual
genome compositions, and constructed a genealogy for
"L" genomes in unisexuals and A. laterale.

Results
Haplotypes and general distribution
We successfully amplified the DNA marker (G1C12) in all
unisexual and A. laterale individuals and in one specimen
from each of the outgroup species (A. jeffersonianum, A.
texanum, and A. tigrinum) (GenBank accession numbers
EU647505–EU647513). In this study we considered each
haploid "L" genome as a unit. Ambystoma laterale contains
two haploid "L" genomes. In unisexuals, for example, an
LJJ contains one "L" genome, an LLJ contains two "L"
genomes and an LLLJ contains three. Six distinct L-G1C12
haplotypes (A-F) were found in both unisexuals and A.

laterale (Additional file 1, Figure 1). No haplotype was
unique to either unisexual or A. laterale specimens.
Among these six haplotypes, 14 informative variable
nucleotide sites and five indels (insertions/deletions)
were observed (Figure 2). The size of five indels found in
the ingroup samples varied, which resulted in the different length of these six haplotypes. The geographical distribution of each haplotype is mapped on Figure 1. Haplotye
A (993 bp) was most widespread with a frequency of 44%
in unisexual individuals. This haplotype was found in all
eastern populations and a few individuals in our collection of central populations. Haplotype B (997 bp, freq.
18%) was only found in populations from central areas,
and was especially prevalent in southwestern Ontario and
western New York. Haplotype C (1052 bp, freq. 26%) was
a common haplotype that was shared by unisexuals and
A. laterale in the central-western region. Haplotype F
(1058 bp, freq. 7%) was mostly distributed in the western

edge of the unisexual distribution. Haplotypes D and E
were less common and distributed in central areas. Haplotype D (1052 bp, freq. 2%) was found in one population in Pennsylvania (site 44) and two populations in
Michigan (sites 90–91). Haplotype E (1052 bp, freq. 3%)
was found only in individuals from the Lake Eire islands
(sites 84–86, 88). In general, haplotypes A and F were
found in a homozygous condition in most east and west
A. laterale and unisexual populations respectively. Haplotypes B, C, D and E dominated central area, where many
of the A. laterale and unisexual individuals were heterozygous for two different haplotypes.
Genealogy of "L" genomes in unisexuals and in A. laterale
The topology from both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses were identical. We only present
the former in Figure 3. Compared with the outgroup species, haplotypes of "L" genomes from unisexuals and A.
laterale formed a distinct clade with high nodal support. It
is noteworthy that the consistency index (CI) of the
ingroups is 1.00, indicating that all pieces of information
support the hypothesis. The most obvious feature of our
tree is the well-supported division of L-G1C12 haplotypes
into two major clades. Clade I contains haplotypes A and
B and clade II contains C, D, E, and F. A deep genetic
divergence (10 single mutational changes and three gaps)
was found between these two major clades. In clade I, A
and B differed by one single mutation and one gap. In
clade II, C to F differed by three single mutations and one
gap (Figure 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/158

The haplotype relationship of L-G1C12 was further analyzed by TCS (Figure 3). The network revealed a distinct
deep divergence (13 mutational steps) between two
groups that corresponded to haplotypes [A, B], and [C, D,
E, F] respectively, which was consistent with our phylogenetic tree.
It is evident from Additional file 1 and Figure 1, that the
general distribution of L-G1C12 haplotypes in both unisexual and A. laterale specimens was congruent. Unisexual
and A. laterale individuals from the same populations
share the same haplotypes. For those populations where
only unisexual specimens were sampled or where unisexuals did not use A. laterale as a sperm donor, such as LJJ
populations, the distributional pattern of haplotypes in
unisexuals were found to be consistent with those in A.
laterale from their nearby locations.

Discussion
The prevalence of genome replacement in unisexual
Ambystoma
Genome replacement is common in the unisexual lineage
throughout evolutionary time. Our results clearly demonstrate that the geographical distribution of six L-G1C12
haplotypes shows concordance in various unisexual and
A. laterale populations. We find no evidence to support
that "L" genomes in unisexuals have evolved independently and diverged from those in sympatric A. laterale.
Nuclear gene genealogy successfully tracks the signature of
genome replacement in natural populations and offers
strong support that genome replacement is a common

In their phylogeographical study of A. laterale, only four
parsimony informative sites were found in the non-protein-coding region of mtDNA that resulted in clear segregation of A. laterale into two distinct groups (East-central
and West) [27]. Our data, that used L-G1C12 as the
nuclear DNA marker, also demonstrate a very similar
East/West dichotomy which strengthens our confidence
that our marker does track evolution in A. laterale.

reproductive mode that has been widely used by various
unisexual Ambystoma populations across their entire distribution. The historical and contemporary frequency of
genome replacement in unisexual Ambystoma is, however,
difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, the six haplotypes
found in unisexual populations, including homozygous
and various heterozygous combinations, provide indisputable evidence of major replacement events involving
A. laterale in the unisexual linage.
The general low genetic divergence of "L" genomes in unisexuals and A. laterale is not surprising given their recent
range expansion [12]. During the last glacial maximum of
the Wisconsin (ca. 18,000 years ago), most of the presentday range of A. laterale and unisexuals was covered by the
Laurentide Ice Sheet [26,27]. We sequenced 17 different
nuclear loci on the "L" genomes but only G1C12 provided
sufficient variation among "L" genomes from various A.
laterale and unisexual populations to test our hypothesis.

Although all unisexuals possess at least one A. laterale
genome, the success of unisexual individuals in expanding their range requires their dependence on sexual sperm
donors and the habitat where they were initially formed.
Our results show that many of the unisexuals that do not
use A. laterale as a current sperm donor have L-G1C12
haplotype allocations that are most similar to those found
in A. laterale from geographically nearby localities. It indicates historical genome replacement events when they
could have interacted, followed by subsequent dispersal
and colonization of unisexuals.
No preference of a particular "L" genome in unisexual
Ambystoma
Based on mitochondrial DNA, unisexual Ambystoma have
a single origin [11] and no recurrent hybridization
between any two of the four genomic donors has been
responsible for subsequent unisexual lineages. It was postulated that A. laterale may have been the paternal ancestor of this old lineage based on the observation that all the
unisexual genome compositions contain at least one "L"
genome [15]. Our results clearly demonstrate that no
ancient or particular A. laterale genome is preferentially
preserved in any unisexual Ambystoma, rejecting the
hypothesis that unisexual individuals may preferentially
maintain one particular "L" genome. Any and all of the
"L" genomes in various unisexual genome compositions
seem to be replaceable. Other nuclear markers, such as
highly variable DNA microsatellite loci, were also used to
demonstrate that there is not a consistent "L" genome that
stays in one population in southern Ontario [11].
Genome replacement would explain the variation
between individuals from discrete egg masses and the
presence of the same microsatellite alleles in unisexual
individuals and sympatric sperm donors [11]. The existence of an "L" genome in every known unisexual (>23
genome compositions) is more than just a coincidence
and begs an explanation. The disjunction of evolutionary
histories of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the
unisexual Ambystoma still poses a very interesting question
regarding why an "L" genome is so important to unisexuals. One possible explanation might be related to the significance of the interaction between nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes to an organism [28].

The conservation of an "L" nuclear genome may also hold
a key to our understanding of sex determination in unisexual Ambystoma. If all ambystomatids have a ZZ/ZW sex
determination system [29], the replacement of a maternal
"B" genome should have resulted in unisexual genomes
devoid of a W chromosome. Subsequent genome replacements and additions can only contribute new Z chromosomes to developing embryos so the offspring should
theoretically consist of males. To explain this situation, it
was speculated that the preservation of "femaleness" in
unisexual Ambystoma could be accomplished by an intergenomic translocation that transferred the W-sex gene from
the ancient "B" chromosome to an "L" chromosome [30].
However, our results provide no support for this hypothesis because no ancient "L" genome, that could contain
any A. barbouri genome-derived sex determining locus, is
maintained in unisexuals.
Genome replacement as an important reproductive
mechanism that can provide longevity to unisexual
lineages
During the past few decades, many researchers have
argued about evolutionary challenges of unisexuals by
questioning their persistence [31]. For example, three
dominant hypotheses ('Red Queen', 'Müller's ratchet' and
the 'mutation-load-reduction theory') have been proposed and revisited in recent years to account for why unisexuality is difficult [7]. Generally, many believe that
unisexuality would be "a ticket to swift extinction" [4]
because unisexuals lack genetic recombination so they can
not generate the variation to cope with changing environments, to purge deleterious mutations and gene combinations and to repair damaged DNA [2,6]. However, the
detection of ancient unisexual lineages in invertebrates
and vertebrates is peculiar so understanding how these
organisms sustain viability without sex can potentially
help us better understand why sex is important [32]. To
persist, many unisexual lineages are capable of incorporating unusual reproductive modes that circumvent normal sexual reproduction allowing recombination to occur
[11,33]. Genome replacement and ploidy elevation is
especially important for sperm-dependent unisexuals to
incorporate additional genetic material by transmission
of genomes or genes from a sexual host therefore providing a source of adaptive flexibility [17,34]. Genome
replacement has been demonstrated in hybridogenetic
unisexual fishes (Poeciliopsis complex [35,36], the Iberian
minnow Leuciscus alburnoides [2,37]), frogs (Rana esculenta
complex [38]) and kleptogenetic unisexual Ambystoma
(present study). Genome replacement explains how lineages may compensate for the disadvantages of unisexuality and all these groups demonstrate genetic and
ecological flexibility as well as evolutionary potential so
they may not be condemned to an evolutionary "deadend". These unisexuals may not be the only organisms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/158

that enjoy such evolutionary flexibility. It was posited that
most ancient unisexual lineages could show some degree
of paternal leakage or genome replacement [17]. Theoretically, even a minimal amount of sex may be very crucial
for unisexuals to bypass a fatal accumulation of deleterious mutations [39] and it could be particularly significant
for lineages to maintain long-term survival [17]. Recent
evidence using modern molecular techniques support the
fact that few (if any) ancient unisexuals reproduce completely asexually [9]. The present discovery of commonality of genome replacement in unisexual Ambystoma
suggest that it has probably been an important factor in
the evolution of this complex, and the unisexual
Ambystoma likely have much more dynamic genomic histories than previously believed. The broader implications
for genome replacement, especially the consequences of
novel genome compositions to sperm-dependent unisexual vertebrates, remain to be further explored.

Conclusion
Unisexual kleptogens steal sperm from suitable sperm
donating species. Most commonly, the sperm is not incorporated and the embryonic development is gynogenetic.
The fusion of the sperm nucleus with an unreduced
oocyte results in ploidy elevation and this phenomenon is
commonly observed in many unisexual populations.
Genome replacement is more difficult to observe without
suitable genetic markers because the replaced genome
may be genetically equivalent to those that are not
replaced. In the unisexual Ambystoma, genome replacement and ploidy elevation are considered important evolutionary mechanisms to compensate for the
disadvantages of unisexual reproduction. Genome
replacement is an effective method to remove deleterious
mutations that may accumulate in a specific genome and/
or to acquire advantageous genes. We have found that
replacement of the A. laterale genome in unisexual populations has commonly occurred over the range of unisexual individuals that are sympatric with A. laterale. Our
data emphasize the importance of kleptogenesis during
the long evolutionary history of the unisexual lineage.
Likewise, other genomic constitutes in unisexual individuals most likely followed a similar "refreshment" process
repeatedly through their sympatric association with other
sexual sperm donors. If such replacement of genomes, followed by novel genetic expression and epigenetic regulations, occurred many times over historical time, these
events would increase the evolutionary flexibility to enable the long-term sustainability of the unisexual lineage.
Genome replacement may also be common in other unisexual animals. Gene genealogy using genome-specific
markers is an effective method to investigate the general
distribution and commonality of genome replacement in
unisexual lineages.

Methods
Specimen sampling and lab protocols
DNA was extracted from 194 unisexual and 89 A. laterale
specimens that were collected from 97 geographically isolated localities (Additional file 1, Figure 1). Most samples
included larva, juvenile or adult tissues that had been
used in previous isozyme investigations [11,40,41] and
kept frozen at -80°C. Some more recently collected samples were also obtained in Ontario, Michigan and Ohio.
The genome composition for each specimen was identified using isozyme analysis, karyotyping, microsatellite
DNA loci and/or flow cytometry. Nomenclature of unisexual Ambystoma was described by Lowcock et al. [42]. For
example, an "LJJ" represents a unisexual triploid salamander possessing one chromosome set of A. laterale and two
sets of A. jeffersonianum chromosomes.

Total genomic DNA was isolated using Promega Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification Kits. To look for candidate
nuclear DNA markers, we tested 17 different nuclear loci.
However, only one of these examined loci yielded sufficient variation among "L" genomes from different unisexual and A. laterale populations. The nuclear DNA marker
we chose was selected based on a nuclear expressed
sequence tag-based (EST) locus from A. tigrinum, named
as G1C12 [43]. This locus was identified to flank an intron
boundary in a gene displaying similarity to the Homo sapiens myosin regulatory light chain MRCL2 sequence. We
used the original primers G1-C12.5.1 and G1-C12.3.2
[43] to amplify this sequence in all five sexual species (LL,
JJ, TiTi, TT, and BB) that are involved in unisexual
Ambystoma reproduction and got amplifications in all but
A. barbouri (BB). G1-C12.5.1 and G1-C12.3.2 were also
used to identify the sequences of major haplotypes in various A. laterale populations. By aligning the sequences
from the four sexual specimens we found a few indels,
which allowed us to redesign primers that targeted these
regions in order to obtain species-specific sequences. We
modified the original primers as L-G1C12F1 (5'TGGCCTCACTTGGTAAGTGTC-3') and L-G1C12R1 (5'CACGCTTATCCACAAAGTCTC-3'). The reverse primer
was located on a region where the other three species (JJ,
TiTi, and TT) contain a large insertion so this primer can
only anneal with sequences from A. laterale. Primers were
repeatedly tested on all five sexual species and our results
showed, that with a high annealing temperature of 58°C,
they specifically amplified A. laterale (L-G1C12) and not
the other four sexual species. These modified primers were
then used to amplify this marker from "L" genomes in various unisexual genomic combinations. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed
using an MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler.
PCR amplification of L-G1C12 was carried out in 25 µl
reactions containing 1× PCR buffer, 0.1 mM dNTP, 0.15 U
of Taq DNA polymerase, 1µl of each primer (10 pmol/µl),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/158

and A. laterale genomic DNA. The PCR program included
1 min initial denaturation at 94°C, 35 cycles of 94°C/
58°C/70°C for 30 s/40 s/1 min followed with a 5 min
extension at 72°C. PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gels and purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kits. Clean products were then used as templates
for sequencing PCR using both forward and reverse primers and Big Dye terminator sequencing reaction, according
to the manufacture's protocol. Sequences were resolved
on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer, verified by Sequencher
(version 4.5) and aligned using ClustalX [44]. Heterozygous sequences that contained ambiguous aligned
regions or multiple heterozygous nucleotide sites were
identified and then cloned using PGEM T-easy vector system II (Promega) to verify the sequence of each sequence
in heterozygous individuals. We also amplified the same
gene sequence using original primers G1-C12.5.1 and G1C12.3.2 from A. jeffersonianum, A. texanum, and A. tigrinum, which served as the outgroups for phylogenetic construction.
Phylogenetic method
A gene genealogy using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood was constructed using PAUP* (version
4.0b10) [45]. Each unique nuclear haplotype was treated
as a taxon and each nucleotide site was treated as a character. The four nucleotides (ACGT) were the character
states. Gaps were treated as fifth character states. For gaps
that were longer than one single nucleotide site, all but
one nucleotide site was excluded. This eliminated the
character weighting effect. For example, an insertion of a
fragment with 20 nucleotides would be considered as one
evolutionary event, rather than 20 events. All characters
were weighted equally and unordered. A heuristic search
method via tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping
with 1000 random step-wise addition replicates was used.
To generate the maximum likelihood tree, the evolutionary model that best fit the observed data, based on the
likelihood ratio test, was calculated using Modeltest (Version 3.6) [46]. The output for both hierarchical likelihood
ratio and Akaike information criterion tests produced the
best scores for our data. A 1000 bootstrap replicates was
conducted with the preferred model in PAUP* 4.0b10.
Because maximum likelihood analysis does not allow
gaps as fifth character states, each gap was converted to
one single transversional change. A haplotype network
was built based on the principle of statistical parsimony
using the computer program TCS 1.21 [47,48]. The treatment of gaps was the same as was used in the maximum
parsimony analysis.
