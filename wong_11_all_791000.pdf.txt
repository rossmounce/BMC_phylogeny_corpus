Not all transmembrane helices are born equal:
Towards the extension of the sequence
homology concept to membrane proteins
Wing-Cheong Wong1, Sebastian Maurer-Stroh1,2 and Frank Eisenhaber1,3,4*

Background: Sequence homology considerations widely used to transfer functional annotation to uncharacterized
protein sequences require special precautions in the case of non-globular sequence segments including
membrane-spanning stretches composed of non-polar residues. Simple, quantitative criteria are desirable for
identifying transmembrane helices (TMs) that must be included into or should be excluded from start sequence
segments in similarity searches aimed at finding distant homologues.
Results: We found that there are two types of TMs in membrane-associated proteins. On the one hand, there are
so-called simple TMs with elevated hydrophobicity, low sequence complexity and extraordinary enrichment in long
aliphatic residues. They merely serve as membrane-anchoring device. In contrast, so-called complex TMs have
lower hydrophobicity, higher sequence complexity and some functional residues. These TMs have additional roles
besides membrane anchoring such as intra-membrane complex formation, ligand binding or a catalytic role.
Simple and complex TMs can occur both in single- and multi-membrane-spanning proteins essentially in any type
of topology. Whereas simple TMs have the potential to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to
generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential
evolutionary information.
Conclusion: For extending the homology concept onto membrane proteins, we provide a necessary quantitative
criterion to distinguish simple TMs (and a sufficient criterion for complex TMs) in query sequences prior to their
usage in homology searches based on assessment of hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of the TM
sequence segments.

Background
In a previous publication [1], we provided evidence that
the inclusion of transmembrane segments (TMs) or signal peptides (SPs) into models of protein domains can
result in apparently statistically significant, yet unrelated
hits when these models are applied to similarity searches
in protein sequence databases. This observation can be
rationalized within the current formulation of the
sequence homology concept [1-6]: SP/TM regions are
essentially hydrophobic stretches that, in a first approximation, are similar to each other regardless of

evolutionary origin due to functional pressures. The
alignment with a SP/TM region produces many coincidences of hydrophobic positions that create the appearance of hydrophobic pattern similarity, otherwise the
key criterion for similarity of the hydrophobic core and
of the fold among globular proteins [2]. Whereas for
globular domains, sequence similarity is interpreted as
evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor, these
sequence similarities are more likely the result of evolutionary convergence.
More generally, SPs/TMs can be considered a special
case of non-globular segments in protein sequences
where the concept of sequence homology originally
developed for soluble globular domains is not directly
applicable [1,2]. Non-globular segments are

characterized by amino acid compositional bias or primitive repetitive patterns [2,7,8]. Sequence similarity
among non-globular segments is not so much an evidence for common evolutionary ancestry as for the similarity of functionally critical physico-chemical
constraints. Therefore, it is strongly advisable to exclude
non-globular sequence segments from starting
sequences used for similarity searches in sequence databases [2,4,8-11].
The work presented in this article has essentially
emerged in response to an important comment by one
of the reviewers of our previous publications [1];
namely, the complete exclusion of TMs from domain
models in libraries such as Pfam [12,13] “would be a
huge disservice to the community” and certain domain
models involving TM regions have proven instrumental
in protein family classification as, for example, in the
cataloging of membrane transporters by Saier and coworkers [14-16]. Indeed, with additional expert insights
and manual interference into the annotation process
[17,18], certain types of multi-membrane proteins can
be satisfactorily defined or classified via sequence similarity. Some representative examples are the 4-TM
helices domain HTTM (horizontally transferred transmembrane) [19] in the SMART database [20,21], the
rhomboid protein family [22-24], the TCDB (Transporter classification database) [14,15] and the GPCRDB (Gprotein coupled receptor database) [25,26].
In [1], we mention that SP/TM regions have a trend
towards low sequence complexity compared with ahelices from structural proteins; yet, in multi-TM proteins, this trend is not as pronounced as in TMs of single-TM proteins or as in signal peptides. In this work,
we build on this observation and derive criteria that distinguish TM regions with structural/functional particularities (to be called ‘complex’ TMs) from mere
hydrophobic stretches (to be called ‘simple’ TMs). In
one type of integral membrane proteins, the general
architecture consists of a globular segment that confers
its biological function and a single helix that anchors
the protein to the lipid bilayer as a result of physiological requirements (it may merely look like a hydrophobic
stretch, most likely due to convergent evolution). An
example is the APMAP (adipocyte plasma membraneassociated protein) which is a Type II membrane protein
with a N-terminal anchor and a C-terminal six-bladed
b-propeller extracellular domain with potential hydrolase activity [27]. The other type is exemplified by
multi-spanning TM proteins where several TM helices
are stitched together via rather short loop regions. With
minimal soluble globular content if at all, their biological functions must be governed by the TM helices. As
an example, the function of rhodophosin, a 7-TM
GPCR (G-protein coupled receptor) is conferred by six

Page 2 of 30

of its seven TM helices [28-30]. From a probabilistic
perspective, it would be an extremely rare event for six
TM helices to evolve independently through convergent
evolution to confer the protein’s enzymatic function.
Homology (due to common ancestry) would be the
more viable explanation for such “functional” TMs.
Considerable problems for interpretation arise for the
‘in-betweeners’, that is, when a protein is mostly globular; yet, it has a few TM helices the functional role of
which is not clear. An example is the PIG-P protein
(phosphatidylinositol N-acetyl-glucosaminyl transferase
subunit P) [31]. 40% of the sequence is covered by its
two TM helices and 60% is globular.
For sequence similarity applications within the
sequence homology concept (i.e., for the extension of
the homology concept to membrane proteins), a quantitative criterion for distinction between complex and
simple TMs would be very helpful, not only in the context of automated annotation pipelines. In this work, we
explore the empirical distribution of TM regions collected from the protein sequence database with regard
to sequence properties and we find fundamental evidence supporting the classification in complex and simple TMs. Simple TMs were found to have less variable
amino acid composition and to be enriched with hydrophobic residues while the complex ones harbor polar/
charged residues and glycine/proline residues that
change structural parameters of TM helices. As a consequence of their increased hydrophobicity [32,33], the
simple helices tend to have a higher propensity for
membrane insertion than the complex helices. Although
we find that simple TMs prevail in single TM proteins,
they can also co-exist with complex helices in multi-TM
proteins. Using the TCDB dataset [14,15], we show that
masking of simple TM helices in homology searches
improves the false-discovery rate of searches without
compromising on the sensitivity while masking the complex ones wreaked havoc to the latter.
Likewise, complex helices can also be observed in proteins with only a few or a single TM region. We show
that the application of the sequence homology concept
can be justified for such complex helices that we find in
single-TM-spanning proteins implicated in diseases and
in immune signaling [34]. Taken together, either simple
or complex TM helices can exist in integral membrane
proteins regardless of their topologies. In this regard,
common ancestry appears not an exclusive business of
the complex TM helices within the multi-spanning
membrane proteins.
We present a quantitative necessary criterion based on
hydrophobicity and sequence complexity assessment of
TM regions to distinguish simple TMs from other cases.
We also explore the likelihood of occurrence of simple
or complex TMs depending on the number of TMs in

Results
Peculiarities in the sequence property distributions of
integral membrane proteins suggest that TM helices can
be simple or complex

In total, 181132 TM helices from single and multi-spanning membrane proteins were extracted from the UniProt annotation file (dated 16-09-2010) based on the
keyword FT_TRANSMEM. For each TM helix, we calculated two values - hydrophobicity and sequence complexity. For the hydrophobicity computation, the
octanol-to-interface scale [35] is used as a measure of
membrane insertion propensity (although with reversed
sign to have high values coincide with high hydrophobicity). The window size of 19 is taken from the original
work [36], the final value is the average over all windows. For determining sequence complexity, we used a
modified form of Shannon’s entropy formula where IVL
is considered as a single group and all other amino acid
residue types as individual (see below for justification).
Window size is 12 and we average over all windows of a
given TM.
Figure 1A shows the histogram of all TM helices in
the sequence complexity/hydrophobicity space. The
cross-section of this skewed histogram in Figure 1B.
The medians of 16 sets of membrane-spanning proteins
(15 sets each containing TMs from 1-, 2-, 3-, ...,14- or
15-TM proteins and another of TMs from proteins with
16 or more TMs) are denoted by black circles and connected in an ascending order starting from the singleTM-spanning set. The connected path clearly shows
that the medians move towards high complexity/low
hydrophobicity and finally converge to a singular cloud
beyond the 5-TM spanning set. This observation suggests that, on average, the single-TM-spanning and the
multi-TM-spanning transmembrane helices are different
in sequence complexity and hydrophobicity.
To amplify this observation, the ‘in-betweener’ sets
(2TMs, 3TMs and 4TMs) were removed. The threedimensional surface plot (Figure 1C) shows the overlay
of two distributions, of the single-TM-spanning sets and
of the combined set of TMs from proteins with at least
5 TM helices. Consequently, two peaks (in red) can be
observed. The cross-section of this surface plot (Figure
1D) emphasizes on these two peaks. The right peak corresponds to a location on the singular cloud of multi-

Page 3 of 30

spanning medians in the scatter plot while the left peak
represents the single-TM-spanning set. This presentation supports the conclusion that, essentially, there are
two types of TM helices in the space of complexity and
hydrophobicity. Those with low sequence complexity
and higher hydrophobicity will be called ‘simple’ TMs;
we define those with high sequence complexity and
lower hydrophobicity as ‘complex’ TMs.
Furthermore, the distributions of the complexity and
hydrophobicity of the 16 membrane spanning sets are
examined individually (Figure 2). The medians of the
complexity measure increases while the hydrophobicity
decreases with the number of membrane-spanning
helices and stabilize beyond the 5-TM-spanning set. The
spreads across the data sets seem consistent. Perhaps,
the most intriguing observation is the simultaneous
enrichment of low-complexity outliers in the complexity
boxplots (Figure 2A) and low-hydrophobicity outliers in
the hydrophobicity boxplots (Figure 2B). This is independent of the number of membrane-spanning helices.
This is particularly interesting for the single-TM-spanning set where there is the expected, clear trend of
membrane anchors being low in complexity and high in
hydrophobicity. The data shows that there are a sizeable
number of outliers not following the trends and we can
reconcile this seemingly contradictory observation by
acknowledging that simple and complex TMs can occur
in proteins regardless of the total number of TMs.
Enrichment of hydrophobic residues in TM anchors and
charged/structural residues in functional TM helices and
their respective propensity for membrane insertion

Here, we wish to examine whether specific amino acid
compositional bias can divorce the TM helices into the
proposed classes of simple and complex in nature. For
this purpose, we analyze the following sets of TM
helices (see Methods for detail): (i) 1767 signal anchors
(with “Signal-anchor” as part of FT_TRANSMEM annotation in UniProt), (ii) 303 membrane anchors (all
others with “Anchor” annotation), (iii) 1741 functional
TM helices from UniProt (additional FT_METAL,
FT_BINDING or FT_ACTIVE record for a position covered with FT_TRANSMEM), (iv) 83 functional TMs
from the previous set reappearing in SCOP membrane
class [37,38]. Note that any substrings and repeated
sequences of these datasets were removed via the cd-hit
algorithm [39] (with options -n 5 -c 1) prior to this
study.
Although UniProt’s strategy to label TMs as anchors
is not fully transparent, we use these sets to detect
trends likely representative of simple TMs since we
might assume that simple TMs are enriched among the
anchors. The other two sets are thought to be examples
for and be enriched in complex helices. Additionally, the

Figure 1 Distribution of UniProt-derived TM segments in the complexity/hydrophobicity plot. 181132 transmembrane helices from single and
multi-spanning membrane proteins were extracted based on the keyword FT_TRANSMEM described in the UniProt annotation file (dated 16-09-2010).
The three-dimensional histogram (Figure 1A) shows a fin-shaped distribution across the diagonals of the complexity and hydrophobicity space. The
cross-section of the histogram (Figure 1B) shows a tear-shaped pattern. Furthermore, the medians of 15 sets of spanning membrane proteins
(containing 1 to 15 TM helices respectively) were computed and denoted by the black circles. The medians were connected in ascending order,
starting from the single-spanning set. The trace of the complexity and hydrophobicity from the single-spanning set to the four-TM spanning set
indicates a progressive shift towards high complexity and low hydrophobicity. The medians converge to almost a singular cloud beyond the fivetransmembrane-spanning set. The three-dimensional surface plot (Figure 1C) shows the hybrid distributions of the single-spanning and those with at
least five membrane-spanning TM helices. The single-spanning ones appear more ‘simple’ while, as a trend, the others seem more ‘complex’. The two
to four-spanning helices are excluded as they were considered to be ‘in-betweeners’. Two distinct peaks (in red) can be seen in the surface plot,
denoting ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ populations respectively. The contour plot (Figure 1D) emphasizes on the two peaks.

membrane and signal anchors were treated as two distinct classes of transmembrane anchors instead of one
due to the considerable difference in sample size that
might otherwise affect the results. The SCOP-derived

set (iv) is an especially well curated subset of UniProtderived set (iii); we use both to detect possible bias in
the results that might arose from sampling bias in the
small dataset and by possible annotation errors in the

Figure 2 Trends of complexity and hydrophobicity as a function of the number of TMs per protein in UniProt. The boxplots of
complexity (Figure 2A) and hydrophobicity (Figure 2B) of the single-spanning to 15-transmembrane and beyond spanning sets are shown. The
medians of the complexity and hydrophobicity measures increase with the number of spanning TM helices found in each set. Interestingly, the
complexity boxplots highlighted an excess of outliers on the lower part of the complexity axis (suggestive of low-complexity sequence
segments) while the hydrophobicity boxplots emphasized the excess of outliers on the bottom part of the hydrophobicity axis (towards charged
composition). This is independent of the size of the membrane-spanning proteins. Taken together, this is somewhat contrary to the expectation
that TM helices are simple and purely hydrophobic. Therefore, it raises the notion that some TM helices are ‘simple’ and others are ‘complex’
regardless of the number of TMs in a protein.

large one. Thus, the concordance of results between the
datasets as observed below certifies that possible ambiguities caused by different evidence levels in the UniProt-derived sets (for example, by data with labels such
as “POTENTIAL” or “BY SIMILARITY” are not relevant
for the conclusions with regard to the summary
statistics.

For each of the four sets, we determined the amino
acid composition. That leaves us with 4 rows of 20
amino acid counts for analysis. For the pairwise comparison of two rows, we apply the proportion test (via 20by-2 contingency table [40]) at a significance level of P
= 0.05 (corresponding to c2 = 30.14). We find statistical
difference at c2 = 521 for the SCOP-derived functional

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

TM set and c2 = 1209 for the UniProt-derived set when
tested against the membrane anchors set. Similarly, the
results were significant at c2 = 786 and c2 = 3737 for
the SCOP-derived and UniProt-derived functional TM
set respectively in tests against the signal anchors.
Together, these initial results imply that there is a general difference in amino acid composition between the
simple and complex TM helices.
The investigation was furthered by detecting the specific residues that are enriched in the simple and complex
TM helices. For this purpose, each set was characterized
by twenty two-value rows (the count of occurrence of a
specific amino acid type and all other occurrences). Like
before, the same set-to-set comparisons were made. For
each case, twenty 2-by-2 contingency tables formulated
as a binomial comparative trial at a family-wise error
rate of 0.05 (significance level of 0.0025 per test) were
used (see chapter 23, pp.491-500 of ref. [40]). The twosided test was selected since no prior assumption of the
directions of the proportions was made. Each set-to-set
comparison would yield a pair of enriched residues; one
from the anchors and another from the functional TMhelices.
Based on results (see Additional file 1, Supplementary
Tables 1), the comparisons against the functional TMhelices (SCOP-derived and UniProt-derived) elucidated
IVLC and IVLCK as the enriched residues from membrane anchors (1A and 1B) while this was LVC and
LVCKST for the signal anchors (1C and 1D). On the
other hand, the same comparisons also found the highly
similar sets of residues: RDEHNFGP enriched in either
functional TM helix set with respect to the membrane
anchor set (1A and 1B) and RDEHNMFWGP enrichment in the functional TMs relative to the signal anchor
set (1C and 1D). Essentially, these findings imply that
the anchors are enriched with aliphatic hydrophobic
residues (LVI) while the functional TM-helices are
enriched with charged (RDEH), structurally important
(GP) and aromatic (FW) residues at their generally
hydrophobic background. Given the consistencies in the
results, the effects of both sampling bias in the small
dataset (SCOP-derived) and the possible annotation
errors in the large one (UniProt-derived) are likely to be
minimal.
Our observation in complex TM helices of enrichment
with charged and structural residues and the association
with specific function beyond membrane anchoring is
compatible with findings from independent laboratories.
Arginine (R) mutations within a TM helix of the Tar
receptor can drive homodimer dissociation and heterodimer association [41]. Polar/charged residues (QNED)
in TMs drive strong helix associations [42]. The
GXXXG motif in a TM of the human erythrocyte protein glycophorin A and bacteriophage M13 major coat

Page 6 of 30

protein is necessary for TM-TM association [43,44].
Proline residues are generally implicated in the folding/
assembly [45] and structural stability of TM helices
[44,46-48].
White et al. have experimentally determined the propensity of membrane insertion for each amino acid residue in terms of an octanol-to-interface scale [35]. In
summary, they concluded that aromatic and hydrophobic residues have high propensity for insertion while the
charged and structural residues sit on the other extreme
[32,33]. Remarkably, our statistically derived enriched
residues are well correlated to these experimentally
derived hydrophobicity scales. The Pearson’s coefficients
for the four set-to-set comparisons ranges from 0.36 to
0.56 (see Additional file 2, Supplementary Tables 2). As
a guide, a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.5 is
large, 0.5 to 0.3 is moderate, 0.3 to 0.1 is small while
anything smaller than 0.1 is trivial [49]. Taken together,
this establishes the notion that anchors being mainly
hydrophobic have a higher propensity for membrane
insertion than the functional TM-helices since the latter
are enriched with charged and structural residues.
Indeed, this conclusion forms the basis of distinction
between the simple and complex TM helices in nature
and, therefore, justifies for their separation.
Quantitative criteria for the distinction of simple and
complex TM helices

In the previous section, the existence of simple and
complex TM helices and, hence, their separability was
justified based on their amino acid compositional bias
and residues’ propensity for membrane insertion. Here,
the hydrophobicity and the sequence complexity measures are proposed as the criteria to partition simple
and complex TM helices.
As in the case of Figure 1, we characterize each TM
segment with two values xF and xc. The hydrophobicity
xF of a sequence segment is computed as average over
membrane propensities for a moving sequence window
(of size 19) using the sign-reversed octanol-to-interface
scale [35,36]. For the complexity measure x c of a
sequence segment, we average the Shannon’s entropies
calculated over the amino acid composition for a moving sequence window. For each entropy value, IVL is
considered a single group while all other residues are
dealt with individually (see methods). The choice of collapsing IVL into one group is based on the enrichment
in aliphatic hydrophobic residues found in membrane
and signal anchors (see previous section). For finding
the optimum averaging window size for the complexity
measure, we permuted across the values 10, 12, 15 and
18 (see below).
For the formulation of a criterion to distinguish simple and complex TMs, a z-score is introduced as an

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

univariate measure (a sum of squares) of normalized
complexity and hydrophobicity

where μ and s are calculated as the mean and standard deviation values of all sequence segments in a
given set of TM regions. The regression line between
normalized hydrophobicity and complexity is read as
x −μ
σ

= ρc,

xc − μ c
σc

(2)

Note that r c,F is the correlation between sequence
complexity and hydrophobicity. To determine the sign
of the z-score in (1), we use the normal to the regressed
line as decision criterion; i.e., the exponent s is set equal
to one for
x −μ

(3)

and equal to zero otherwise. In this notation, TMs
with high hydrophobicity and low complexity will have
low z-scores (see methods for the derivation of the
regressed line and normal equation).
In Figure 3A, we show how the membrane anchor
TM set and the SCOP functional TM set relate to each
other in the normalized hydrophobicity/complexity diagram. Thus, the comparison between two such sets can
be used to derive a quantitative criterion in the hydrophobicity/complexity space by minimizing prediction
errors. It should be noted that the sets of functional
TMs (especially the one derived from SCOP) are much
better defined than the sets of membrane or signal
anchors; thus, a criterion for distinction between the
two sets is more straightforwardly determined with the
distribution of functional TMs. We found that the summary statistics of the SCOP- and of the UniProt-derived

functional TM sets do not show any significant difference (Table 1). Therefore, we consider z-scores z(xF, xc)
of any query TM relative to the summary statistics of
the much larger UniProt-derived functional TM set (μF
= 0.64, sF = 2.85, μc = 2.4, sc = 0.30, rc,F = -0.436; see
1). For illustration purposes in Figure 3B, we show the
resulting approximated distribution of z-scores of membrane anchors and the UniProt-derived functional TMs.
Essentially, the z-score can now be used to assess for a
query TM whether it is simple (z-score < threshold) or
complex (z-score ≥ threshold). Once a z-score threshold
is fixed, the prediction process partitions the complex
TM-helices into true-positives (TP) and false-negatives
(FN) while the simple helices are divided into the true
negatives (TN) and false-positives (FP).
To quantify the separability between the simple and
complex TM helices via a z-score threshold, the error
rates (false-positive and false-negative rates; see methods) were established for the set-to-set comparisons of
the membrane and signal anchors against the functional
TM-helices datasets (both SCOP-derived and UniProtderived; see Table 1 for their summary statistics). With
reference to the functional TM-helices sets, various zscore thresholds
zthreshold μ + f σ , μc − f σc

(4)

are defined at f = 0.840, 1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and 1.980
(equivalent to theoretical false-negative rates of 20%,
16%, 10%, 5% and 2.5% respectively for the one-tailed ztest) on the two measures since one does not know a
priori the most appropriate threshold between simple
and complex TM helices. Note that substituting expression (4) into (1) resolves into the equation zthreshold(μF +
fsF, μc -fsc ) = -2f 2. Hence, the corresponding z-score
thresholds are -1.41, -2.00, -3.29, -5.41 and -7.84 at f =
0.840, 1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and 1.980 respectively.
Table 2 (sections A and B) summarizes the false-positive and false-negative rates for the SCOP-derived and

The summary statistics of the quantitative criteria (sequence complexity/hydrophobicity; column 2) for the SCOP-derived and UniProt-derived functional TM-helix
sets are given in section A and B of Table 1 respectively (column 4-6, 7-9). The summary statistic (μc, sc, nc) denotes the mean, standard deviation and sample
size for the sequence complexity measures for a given window size (10,12,15 and 18; column 3) while the summary statistic (μF, sF, nF) denotes the mean,
standard deviation and sample size for the hydrophobicity measures for the window size of 19. The p-values (last column) are computed from the two-tailed ttest. None of the tests return a significant result which means that the summary statistics between the SCOP-derived and UniProt-derived functional TM-helix
sets are similar. As such, calculations of false-negative rates based on either functional TM-helix sets should give similar conclusions.

Table 2 (section A-D) shows the data generated with collapse of aliphatic hydrophobic residues IVL into one residue group (to suppress sequence variability just
among hydrophobic residues). Table 2 (section E-H) presents the data without collapse of IVL into one group for comparison. The error rates of the membrane
and signal anchors versus the functional TM-helix sets are given in sections A & B (E & G) and in sections C & D (G & H) respectively. Column 1 gives the
subsections (A to H) of the table. Column 2 describes the comparison of the respective datasets. Column 3 gives the window size of the sequence complexity
measure. The window size for the hydrophobicity measure was fixed at 19. Column pairs (4,5), (6,7), (8,9), (10,11) and (12,13) give the false-positive rates (FPR)
and false-negative rates (FNR) for the z-score thresholds at f = 0.84, 1.0, 1.282, 1.645 and 1.98 (corresponding to the theoretical false-negative rates of 20%, 16%,
10%, 5% and 2.5%) respectively.

UniProt-derived functional TM-helices against the
membrane anchors respectively while Table 2 (sections
C and D) gives the error rates of the functional TMhelix sets against the signal anchors. Firstly, the data
supports that the z-score of the functional TM sets is
close to be normally distributed: For all f, the theoretical

false-negative rates are very similar to the computed
ones (the absolute difference is between 0.5% and 5%;
see Table 2) and, as a trend, the computed rates are
smaller than the theoretical ones especially for the larger
f (1.645 and 1.980). This means that the z-scores of the
functional TM-helices satisfy the normality assumption

Figure 3 Definition of the z-score with regard to the set of functional TMs. Figure 3A shows the normalized sequence complexity/
hydrophobicity measures of the membrane anchors (in blue), functional TM-helices (UniProt-derived; in red) and functional a-helices (in green).
The univariate z-score is given by the squared sums of two normalized measures. The expectation of the z-scores for the functional TM-helices
set is zero. The regression line (r = -0.436) for the functional TM set and its normal are indicated. The negative halve of the functional TM
helices’ z-scores is given by the inequality (3) while z-scores failing to satisfy the inequality makes up the positive halve. It is apparent that the
majority of the membrane anchors have negative z-scores while the functional a-helices have positive z-scores. Figure 3B depicts the
distributions of the membrane anchors (in blue) as simple TM helices and the functional TM-helices (in red) as complex TM helices. For
illustrative purpose, the membrane anchors are approximated by the Gumbel distribution given its long left tail while the functional TM-helices
are fitted to the normal distribution. For a given z-score threshold, the complex TM helices are partitioned into true-positives (TP) and falsenegatives (FN) while the simple helices are divided into the true negatives (TN) and false-positives (FP). Consequently, the false-positive and
false-negative rates can be determined for a given z-score threshold defined by equation (4).

reasonably well for the range of thresholds studied,
although the tails of the empirical distribution extend
slightly more than in the theoretical normal distribution.
But most importantly, the histograms of the functional
TM-helices showed general symmetry (as an example,
see Figure 5A). In contrast, a skewed distribution is
sometimes suggestive of multiple distributions or populations (see chapter 2 in [50]). Together, this suggests
that the functional TM-helices form a symmetrical
unimodal distribution that is likely to contain itself as
the only population.
With regard to the false-positive rates, there is only
minimal difference across the various window sizes used
to calculate sequence complexity. In Table 2 (sections A
and B for the membrane anchors and sections C and D
for the signal anchors), the absolute difference is within
7%. This suggests that window size used for sequence
complexity computation has relatively small impact on
the separability of complex and simple TM helices. The
overall concordance is somewhat expected since the
summary statistics of both complexity and hydrophobicity measures between the SCOP-derived and UniProtderived functional TM-helices datasets were found to be
statistically insignificant (Table 1). However, the average
false-positive rates between the membrane and signal
anchors show that the two sets are markedly different.
Quantitatively speaking, the signal anchors have almost
20% more non-simple TM instances than the membrane
anchors (absolute difference between the false-positive
rates in Table 2; compare sections A/B and C/D). For
the sake of completeness, we provide also the prediction
rates computed without collapse of IVL into one group
for sequence complexity calculations (see Table 2, sections E-H). The conclusions remain unchanged; yet, we
think that, for future evaluation of TM helix properties,
sequence complexity computations that are unaffected
by variations just among the aliphatic hydrophobic residues are more appropriate since, then, the sequence
complexity criterion becomes more orthogonal relative
to hydrophobicity.
Finally, given the slightly preferential performance
with changing complexity measure window size, the size
of 12 is used throughout the rest of the work for the
sake of simplicity.
Relationships between TM helices, segments of low
complexity, signal peptides & functional a-helices in
globular domains and the peculiarities in the supposed
simple TM populations of membrane and signal anchors

Figure 4A shows the plot of complexity and hydrophobicity measures for membrane anchors against the functional TM-helices (UniProt-derived), functional ahelices and low-complexity sequences (SEG-detected;
SEG25/3.0/3.3) [10]. The plot is partitioned into four

Page 10 of 30

quadrants by the two error margins defined by xF = μF
+ 1.282sF and xc = μc - 1.282sc (f = 1.282 at 10% theoretical false negative rate) where (μF,sF) and (μc, sc) are
the summary statistic calculated from the UniProtderived functional TM-helix set.
The lower-right quadrant exhibits most instances of
both the functional a-helices from globular proteins
(1327 of 1330, 99.8%) and of the functional, i.e., complex TMs (1446 of 1741, 83.1%). Both groups have in
common a trend towards high complexity/low hydrophobicity; yet, the trend is more pronounced for the ahelices. In the intermediate region between the two
helix populations, there is considerable overlap. Some of
these a-helices appear to belong to the group of δhelices [51] that might function also as TM helices. The
overlap between the populations can be seen as a justification to apply and, thus, to extend the sequence
homology concept from the a-helices in globular
domains to complex TMs.
In the other extreme, the upper-left quadrant (low
complexity, very high hydrophobicity) contains 55.8% of
the membrane anchor set (169 out of 303) that are
examples of simple and more hydrophobic TM helices.
Some overlap between the functional TM-helices and
the membrane anchors is observed. Meanwhile, the
overlap between the anchors and the low-complexity
segments is much more pronounced. This justifies for
the masking of these simple TM helices prior to
sequence homology searches. However, the SEG algorithm [10] does not sample deep into the low complexity/very high hydrophobicity space. Instead, it samples
almost only the low hydrophobicity space (97.9% or
465139 of 475207 instances of grey dots are below the
hydrophobicity of -4.29 in Figure 4A) and also extends
into the high complexity space of the functional TM
and a-helices. As a consequence, the lone application
SEG is insufficient to distinguish between the simple
and complex TM helices.
Figure 4B shows the complexity/hydrophobicity plot of
the signal anchors versus the functional TM-helices (UniProt-derived), functional a-helices and signal peptides
(from proteins with structures in SCOP with the N-terminus missing, see Methods). Compared to the membrane anchors, the extent of overlap between the signal
anchors and functional TM-helices is more pronounced.
Only 30.1% (531 out of 1767) of the signal anchors
occupy the upper-left, low complexity/very high hydrophobicity quadrant. As close analogues to the signal
anchors, the signal peptides span a similar complexity
space but approximately half the hydrophobicity space of
the signal anchors. As a trend, the signal peptides are
more hydrophilic. This is not a surprise since signal peptides have a canonical structure including polar, typically
positively charged N-terminal tip followed by a quite

Figure 5 Z-score histograms of the functional a-helices, functional TM-helices (SCOP/UniProt-derived), membrane anchors and signal
anchors. The z-score histograms for the functional TM-helices (SCOP-derived; Figure 5A and UniProt-derived; Figure 5B), membrane anchors
(Figure 5C) and signal anchors (Figure 5D) are shown. The functional TM-helix sets have a characteristics long-tailed, symmetrical and unimodal
shape histogram. On the other hand, the histograms of the membrane and signal anchor sets have a left-skewed long-tailed non-unimodality
shape. This is suggestive of multiple populations. The two vertical dotted lines define a twilight zone between the functional TM-helices and the
anchors based on the z-score thresholds of -7.84 and -3.29 that are calculated from f = 1.980 and f = 1.282 respectively via equation (4).

Figure 4 Sequence complexity/hydrophobicity plot for membrane and signal anchors against functional TM-helices. Figure 4A shows
the sequence complexity/hydrophobicity plot of the membrane anchors (blue) against the functional a-helices (green), functional TM-helices
(UniProt-derived; red) and low-complexity segments (SEG25/3.0/3.3-detected; gray). The dotted lines are defined by xF = μF + 1.282sF and xc =
μc -1.282sc where (μF,sF)and (μc, sc) are the summary statistic calculated from the UniProt-derived functional TM-helix set. This corresponds to a
false-negative rate of 10% (at f = 1.282). Based on the plot, there is some overlap between the functional a- and TM-helices which justifies for
the extension of the sequence homology concept for these cases. 55.8% (169 out of the 303) of the membrane anchors occupy the upper left
quadrant, suggestive of simple TM helices. Figure 4B shows the complexity and hydrophobicity plot of signal anchors (blue) against the
functional a-helices (green), functional TM-helices (UniProt-derived; red) and signal peptides (cyan). Similarly, the dotted lines define the
boundaries at the false-negative rate of 10%. 30.1% of the signal anchors (531 out of the 1767) occupy the upper left quadrant, suggestive of
simple TM helices.

uniformly hydrophobic region and a region of small residues, the latter involving the cleavage site [52]. In similarity searches, it is mainly the hydrophobic segment that
causes false homologies [1]. Since the signal peptide cannot be part of the mature protein and, thus, of any of its
globular domains, it is advisable to suppress signal peptides in protein domains in all cases of homology
searches aimed at remnant sequence similarity levels.

As a matter of fact, the definition of signal anchors in
UniProt is muddled. If we check the annotated signal
anchors with the SignalP algorithm [52], 372 of the
1767 signal anchors were predicted as signal peptides
both by the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the
neural network versions of SignalP. Further 1057 of the
signal anchors are predicted by either version of SignalP.
Another 324 examples have been rejected as possible

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57

signal peptides by both versions. Out of them, 218 are
N-terminal signal anchors (within the first 100 residues,
see Methods), 106 are more C-terminally located.
Despite of all these reservations, we can say that membrane anchor sequence segments, as a trend, are more
hydrophobic/less complex than signal anchors and the
trend is even stronger in the comparison with signal
peptides.
As it is, the sequence sets of functional a-helices of
globular proteins, signal peptides and low-complexity
segments are better defined than the TM helices. For
example, if all membrane and signal anchors are considered simple TMs, then 21% (62 out of 303) of the membrane anchors and 36% (638 out of 1767) of the signal
anchors are in fact ill-defined based on the lower/right
(high complexity/low hydrophobicity) quadrant, contrary
to their UniProt annotations. To clarify the inter-relationships among the TM populations, the z-scores of
each TM population are calculated using the summary
statistics computed from the UniProt-derived functional
TM-helices as a common reference (see Table 1 for the
appropriate values of μF,sF, μc, sc). Most importantly, if
the anchor sets are identical to the functional TM-helix
set, their histograms should be similar to the latter.
Otherwise, any peculiarities in the anchor distributions
should appear.
Figure 5 shows the histograms of the TM-helix populations: the functional TM-helices (SCOP-derived and
UniProt-derived), membrane anchors and signal anchors
in their respective z-scores. Unsurprisingly, both functional TM-helix sets display very comparable histograms
but most notably, the histograms are both long-tailed,
symmetrical and unimodal (see Figure 5A and 5B). In
contrast, the anchor histograms are markedly different
from that of the functional TM-helices (see Figure 5C
and 5D). Their histograms are apparently left-skewed
and long-tailed in nature. In the case of membrane
anchors, non-unimodality can be observed explicitly (an
apparent additional maximum at lower z-score around
-30 in Figure 5C). In the z-score metric, 73% (220 out
of 330) of the membrane anchors and 52% (924 out of
1767) of the signal anchors are considered as simple
respectively at f = 1.282 (i.e. false-negative rate of 10%).
A plausible explanation for the skewness and nonunimodality observed in the anchors histograms is the
existence of a mixed population of simple and complex
TM helices. Firstly, this is compatible with our initial
observation that a TM helix can be simple or complex.
Secondly, our earlier enrichment analysis for residues in
the simple and complex TM helices finds that the
charged residue lysine (K) is found to be enriched in the
anchor TM sets (see Table one of reference [34]). This
is incompatible with the general observation that
charged residues (RDEH) are characteristics of the

Page 13 of 30

complex ones. It is possible that some of these simple
helices harboring lysine are in fact complex. If this is
indeed the case, then complex TM helices (implying
common ancestry) do also exist in single-spanning
membrane proteins, contrary to their role as only
anchors (implying convergent evolution). In other
words, it means that TM helices in single-spanning
membrane proteins may arise either through common
ancestry or convergent evolution. As collateral, the general high false-positive rates in Table 2 of the anchors
are likely exaggerated by the superimposed subset of
complex TM helices.
Complex TM helices in single-spanning TM proteins and
their role in conferring homology

In the preceding section, the skewness and non-unimodality of the anchor histograms have hinted the alternate
view that a complex TM helix can exist in the singlespanning membrane protein. On a separate note, case
studies of single-spanning membrane proteins implicated in diseases and immune-signaling have shown that
the TM helices can possess structural and functional
roles well beyond serving as mere anchors. These helices
are capable of protein complex assembly and signal
transduction, very much like the small modular domains
of the globular proteins [34]. To extend the sequence
homology concept for TM helices in single-spanning
membrane proteins, it is necessary for the complex
helices to embody ancestry information while the simple
ones do not.
We studied the 48 cases of functionally-related TM
helices in Tables 1 and 2 of reference [34]. First, the full
length sequences were searched against the SwissProt
(downloaded on 26-12-2010) with BLASTP [9] to find
the orthologues in various species of the respective proteins (to make use of SwissProt IDs for automated processing of search outputs). All other hits were ignored.
For 27 out of the 48 cases, this search resulted in at
least two hits and one of them is the full-length seed
orthologue. Next, the same searches for the TM segments alone were executed. We used an E-value of 1000
to increase the sensitivity of detection for short
sequences. The raw sequence comparison results are
available additional files associated with this article.
For each of the 27 cases, the search results of the full
length and TM-only segment were compared. Given
that proteins can either be homologous or non-homologous to one another, only the following two extreme
scenarios of the comparisons are meaningful; (i) Either
the two result sets have complete matches exactly (ii) or
the TM-only result set contains the TM segment of the
seed orthologue itself as the sole hit.
The comparisons are tabulated in Table 3. Among the
total of 27 valid cases, we find 19 cases of complete

There are in total 27 valid cases of functionally-related single-spanning membrane proteins from [34], out of which 19 cases are complete matches (section A)
and 8 cases are sole hits (section B). The gene name and the UniProt ID of the seed sequences are given in column 3 and 4 respectively. The sequence
complexity xc, hydrophobicity xF and z-score of the seed sequences are given in column 5, 6 and 7 respectively. The last column gives the orthologues of the
seed sequences. For the 19 cases of complete matches, the TM-only sequences are able to retrieve their orthologous helices where their z-scores range from
-9.18 to -0.10. For the other 8 cases of sole hits, they have failed to retrieve their orthologues. Their z-scores are between -28.63 to -3.52. The conflict zone
between the 19 exact matches and 8 sole hits spans from -9.18 to -3.52. Note that TREM-2a (Table one of [34]) and TREM-2b (Table one of [34]) denote the same
full length sequence but with a slight variation in the borders of the TM segment. Regardless of the variant, the conclusions remain unchanged.

matches and 8 cases of sole hits. For 19 cases of complete matches, the TM sequences have demonstrated
the capability of retrieving their orthologous helices.
Their corresponding z-scores (calculated with summary
statistic from the UniProt-derived functional TM set;
see Table 1) range from -9.18 to -0.10. Meanwhile, the
other 8 cases of sole hits failed to retrieve their orthologues. This is indicative of a discontinuity in ancestry

information. Their z-scores are between -28.63 to -3.52.
Overall, this gives rise to a conflict zone for the z-score
between the 19 exact matches and 8 sole hits that spans
from -9.18 to -3.52. Guided by this result, a twilight
zone between simple and complex TM helices can be
defined for a range of -7.84 to -3.29 that is bracketed by
the z-score threshold of f = 1.980 (false-negative rate of
2.5%) and f = 1.282 (false-negative rate of 10%).

Out of the 19 exact matches, 9 have z-scores above
the twilight zone and hence they contain complex TM
helices. These exemplary cases show that complex
helices do exist in single-spanning membrane proteins.
Most importantly, they can confer homology information instead of just serving as anchors (due to physiological requirement), thereby justifying the extension of
the sequence homology concept for the single-spanning
cases. For the 8 cases of sole hits, 3 of them have simple
helices since their z-scores fell below the twilight zone.
Fundamentally, these 3 cases demonstrate the lack of
ancestry information in simple TM helices.
Multi-spanning membrane proteins can harbor simple TM
helices

The TCDB (Transporter classification database) [14,15]
contains 656 distinct families but only 326 families that
have TM annotations are useful for our further investigation. The total number of their TCDB entries is 2202.
For each entry, the original sequence is first searched
against the SwissProt database (dated 26-12-2010) with
BLASTP [9]. Next, two more searches are performed;
one for a masked version where the simple TMs are
masked below a z-score threshold and another for a
control version where the complex TMs are masked
above the same threshold. The masking replaces the
TM sequence positions with a continuum of ‘X’s. The zscore thresholds are set at various f = 0.84, 1.0, 1.282,
1.645. 1.98 (equivalent to false-negative rates of 20%,
16%, 10%, 5% and 2.5% taken with respect to the UniProt-derived functional TM-helices), where the larger
false-negative rates indicate more aggressive z-score
thresholds (more masking).
In the search results of the original sequence, hits with
E-values more than 0.001 are discarded. In addition, hits
without TCDB classifications are also removed. For the
remaining hits, their corresponding alignment scores
from the masked and control sequences are retrieved
from the other two search results. Thus, each hit should
be associated with a TCDB classification and three
alignment scores from the original, masked and control
sequences. The respective raw results are available as
additional files.
This information is used to compute the number of
true-positive, false-negative and false-positive hits. Since
alignment scores contributed by simple TMs can be
considered more dubious, the smallest alignment score
representative of a true hit is determined from the minimum of the masked scores that have the same classification as the seed TCDB entry of the search. This
minimum score is the cutoff used for the computation
of false-discovery rate and sensitivity of the search for
each TCDB entry (see methods). Given that a hit has
the same classification as the TCDB entry, it is

Page 15 of 30

considered a true-positive if its score is equal or above
the cutoff, otherwise it is a false-negative. Meanwhile, if
a hit does not share the same classification as the seed
entry, it is a false-positive if its score is equal or above
the cutoff, otherwise it is a true-negative. Note that the
sensitivity of the search for the masked sequence is
always equal to 1.00 since the cutoff was derived based
on its search results.
Figure 6A shows a series of histograms of the mask
ratios (m = number of masked TMs over total TMs per
TCDB entry) for the z-score threshold settings of f =
0.840, 1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and 1.980. The corresponding
total number of entries where TMs are partly masked (i.
e., where 0 < m < 1) are 1747, 1705, 1533, 1071 and 680
respectively. The corresponding median mask ratios of
the respective TCDB entries are 0.41, 0.33, 0.18, 0.08
and 0.00 depending on z-score threshold. The overwhelming majority of TCDB entries are multi-membrane-spanning with an average of 8 TM helices per
entry. The non-zero mask ratios imply that some TM
helices in the multi-spanning entries can be considered
simple.
Table 4 shows the extremities of the effects of masking where mask ratio of 0 denotes that a TCDB entry
has none of its TM helices masked (i.e. all TM helices
are complex) and mask ratio of 1 denotes that all TM
helices are masked (i.e. all TM helices are simple). The
average number of TM helices in fully-masked entries
ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 while the average number in
fully-unmasked entries is between 4.4 and 7.3. On average, the masking of TM helices is more aggressive with
entries having a low number of TM helices. In other
words, simple TM helices are more dominant in singlespanning membrane proteins than the multi-spanning
ones.
Figure 6B shows a series of plots of the false-discovery
rates between the masked and original sequences of the
2202 TCDB entries as a function of z-score threshold.
Regardless of the threshold values, the false-discovery
rates of masked sequences for some of the TCDB
entries are less than or equal to that of their corresponding original sequences. Thus, it is positive for the
similarity search to exclude simple TMs since more
false-positive hits are suppressed. For more aggressive zscore thresholds (smaller f), more TCDB entries
undergo extensive TM masking and, subsequently,
experience a decrease in/an improvement of their falsediscovery rates.
The improvement of false-discovery rates that is
accompanied by the removal of simple TMs is not compromised by the sensitivity of the search. Sensitivity is
best described as the power of a statistic test which is
its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
Maximum sensitivity is numerically defined as 1. Figure

Figure 6 Effects on the homology searches for TCDB with the removal of simple and complex TM helices. The performance of the
homology searches for 2202 TCDB entries between their original and masked sequences are shown for the z-score thresholds of f = 0.840,
1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and 1.980 respectively. The corresponding false-negative rates are 20%, 16%, 10%, 5% and 2.5% respectively. Figure 6A shows
the masked ratios (m = number of masked TMs over total TMs) of the 2202 TCDB entries. The median mask ratios of the TCDB entries are 0.41,
0.33, 0.18, 0.08 and 0.00 for f = 0.840, f = 1.000, f = 1.282, f = 1.645 and f = 1.980 respectively. The non-zero mask ratio means that some TM
helices in the multi-spanning entries are considered simple. The corresponding total number of entries (where 0 < m < 1) are 1747, 1705, 1533,
1071 and 680 respectively. On average, each masked TCDB entry has about 9 to 10 TM helices. Therefore, most TCDB entries are multi-spanning.
Figure 6B shows that the false-discovery rates of the searches for the masked sequences are at least equal or less than that of their
corresponding full sequences at a comparable sensitivity. This means that the masking of simple TMs can improve the false-discovery rates of
the searches. This trend is independent of the different z-score thresholds that influence the level of masking (most masking at false-negative
rate of 20% and least masking at false-negative rate of 2.5%). Figures 6C and 6D show the sensitivity plots of the searches for the 2202 TCDB
sequences. The red, blue and black lines represent the sensitivities of the original, masked and control sequences respectively. The sensitivity of
the original (red) and masked (blue) sequences are comparable at 1.0 for most of the sequences. At a sensitivity of 1, the number of falsenegatives is zero. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the search for the control sequences (where the complex TMs are masked) deviates
greatly from the sensitivity of 1. This implies that the masking of complex TMs has a detrimental effect on the TCDB classification.

6C show the sensitivity of the 2202 entries for the zscore thresholds of f = 0.840, 1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and
1.980. The red and blue lines represent the sensitivities
of the original and masked sequence searches. The sensitivities of both searches hardly vary for most of the
entries. In those occasional cases where they do, the
sensitivities of the original sequences are less than that
of the masked ones. On the other hand, the sensitivities
(see Figure 6D) of the control sequences (i.e., where the
complex TMs with z-score above the threshold are
masked) fluctuate wildly across the sensitivity axis. This

shows that the masking of complex TMs decreases the
sensitivity of the search. In hindsight, this investigation
shows the importance of complex TMs as homology
pieces and the redundancy of the simple TMs for
homology searches.
Frequency of simple helices decreases as number of
spanning TM helices increases

Although simple TM helices can be expected in either
single-spanning or multi-spanning membrane proteins,
their rate of occurrence remains unclear. Here, we

The two mask ratios of m = 0 and m = 1 correspond to the extreme situation where the TM segments in a TCDB entry is fully unmasked or fully masked
respectively (column 1). The column pairs (2,3), (4,5), (6,7), (8,9) and (10,11) denotes the number of TCDB entries and the average number of TM helices (total
number of TM helices in the entries/total number of entries) given the associated mask ratio and the z-score thresholds of f = 0.840, 1.000, 1.282, 1.645 and
1.980 (corresponding to false-negative rates of 20%, 16%, 10%, 5% and 2.5%). The average number of masked helices ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 while the average
number of unmasked helices is between 4.4 and 7.3. This means that the fully masked TCDB entries are almost exclusively the single-spanning ones while the
fully unmasked entries are often the multi-spanning ones.

attempt to compute the true-negative rate and the estimated number of the simple TM helices when given
any multi-spanning proteins with a fixed number of TM
helices.
Hence, the UniProt sequences and their associated
annotations (based on UniProt annotation file dated 1609-2010) were retrieved based simply on the keyword
FT_TRANSMEM. Fifteen datasets were created from 1
to 15 TM segments (the number of available proteins
with more TMs is too small for this assessment). For
each protein, the z-score of all TMs is calculated using
the parameterization of the UniProt-derived functional
TM-helices datasets. A TM with a score below threshold is considered simple. In Table 5, we list the fractions
of the number of complex and simple TMs relative to
the total number of TMs found in the set (depending
on z-score thresholds with f = 1.282 (false-negative rate
of 10%) and f = 1.645 (false-negative rate of 5%)). The
latter ratio (Figure 7A) can be used to compute the
average expected number of simple TMs in a protein
with a given number of TM regions (Figure 7B).
The general trend is that the ratios of simple TM
helices occurrence decrease exponentially as the number
of TM helices increases in the protein. Beyond 6 TM
helices, the frequency of occurrence almost stabilizes
(Figure 7A). The trend is independent of the various zscore thresholds. Unlike the expected frequency of simple helices, the expected total numbers of simple helices
do not plateau (Figure 7B). This is because the number
of expected simple helices is about proportional to the
number of TM helices in the protein.
Examples of simple and complex TM helices in known
membrane proteins

For the introductory example of 7-TM rhodopsin protein (P02699), the z-scores of its seven TM helices are
-3.23 (TM-1), 0.05 (TM-2), 0.33 (TM-3), 0.43 (TM-4),
-9.00 (TM-5), -2.67 (TM-6) and 2.57 (TM-7) respectively. Meanwhile, the z-score twilight zone is between
-5.41 (f = 1.645) and -3.29 (f = 1.282). Hence, z-scores

below -5.41 are considered simple while z-score above
-3.29 are complex. Consequently, only TM-5 of rhodopsin is considered simple. This collaborates well with the
expected number of simple TM of between 0.78 and
1.54 for membrane proteins with 7 TM helices (see
Table 5). So far, the functional role of this TM segment
has not been well established whereas the Gly51 in TM1 and Gly89 in TM-2 have been linked to the retinal
degenerative disease autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa [29] while Glu113 in TM-3, Ala169 in TM-4,
Trp265 in TM-6 and Lys296 in TM7 are functionally
important [28,30].
Next, the Escherichia coli GlpG (P09391), a 6-TM bacterial rhomboid protease, has an active cleft that is characterized by the catalytic residues His150 in TM-2,
Ser201 in TM-4 and His254 in TM-6. Furthermore, it is
suggested that both TM-1 and TM-3 provide only a
structural role while TM-5 possesses conformational
flexibility given that the substrate enters through the
gap between TM-2 and TM-5 [22-24]. Correspondingly,
the z-scores of the TM helices are -3.59 (TM-1), -0.72
(TM-2), -2.52 (TM-3), 1.18 (TM-4), -0.95 (TM-5) and
3.27 (TM-6) respectively. All helices except TM-1 are
considered complex for a z-score threshold of above
-3.29 (f = 1.282). Interestingly, within the complex
helices, the higher z-scores are able to differentiate the
functionally-related helices (TM-2, TM-4, TM-6) from
the structurally-related ones (TM-3, TM-5).
Here, an example of the ‘in-betweener’ protein Escherichia coli aspartate receptor (Tar; P07010) is a chemotaxis receptor in bacteria. It is composed of 2 TM
helices (TM-1 and TM-2) and 3 bacterial domains as
annotated by SMART [20,21] (SM00319-TarH: ligand
binding domain, SM00304-HAMP: signal transduction
domain, SM00283-MA: methyl-accepting chemotaxislike domain). This receptor forms a homodimer through
helix interactions between TM-1 of two monomers,
without any involvement of TM-2 [41,53]. In fact, our
z-score computations also show that TM-1 of Tar (zscore of -3.36) is indeed more important than its TM-2

Figure 7 Rate of occurrences and expected number of simple TM helices with increasing number of TM helices in membrane proteins.
Figure 7A shows the general trend that the rate of occurrences (in terms of ratio of simple TM helices) decreases exponentially as the number of
TM helices increases in the protein. The ratios stabilize beyond 6 TM helices. Note that the trend is independent of the z-score thresholds of f =
1.282 (false-negative rate of 10%; see red lines) and f = 1.645 (false-negative rate of 5%; see blue lines). On the other hand, Figure 7B shows that
the expected total numbers of simple helices do not plateau with increasing TM helices. Generally, the number of expected simple helices sh is
about proportional to the number of TM helices nTM in the protein. The relationship between these two values is sh = 0.218nTM (goodness of
fit is R2 = 0.93) for f = 1.282 and sh = 0.112nTM (goodness of fit is R2 = 0.82) for f = 1.645.

(z-score of -24.48). Given the twilight zone of -5.41 (f =
1.645) and -3.29 (f = 1.282), TM-2 of Tar is considered
simple. The expected number of simple TM helices is
slightly underestimated at between 0.51 and 0.80 for
membrane proteins with 2 TM helices (see Table 5).
Colicin is an interesting protein with two forms, one
soluble form with known 3D structure (accession 1col
[54]) where two nascent TMs (helices 8 and 9) are
incorporated into the volume of a globular structure
and another membrane-bound, pore-forming form [55].
Existing experimental evidence shows that helix 8 can
interact with the colicin immunity protein of the host
[56,57]. In agreement, we find that helix 8 is a complex

TM (z-score of -0.82 for colicin Y/accession Q9KJ98
and similar for other colicins), whereas helix 9 looks
more like a simple TM (z-score of -4.38).
Finally, the z-score of another introductory example
the human APMAP (Q9HDC9) is found to be -2.84.
Interestingly, its z-score is above the twilight range and
hence its sole TM helix is considered complex. Interestingly, the TM-only sequence search of the human
APMAP (as a seed orthologue against SwissProt dated
26-12-2010) returns 4 out of 6 of its orthologous
APMAP (APMAP_RAT, APMAP_MOUSE, APMAP_BOVIN, APMAP_CHICK, APMAP_DANRE, APMAP_SALSA). This means that the TM helix is likely to

The rate of occurrences and expected number of simple TM helices are computed for 15 sets of UniProt-derived membrane entries grouped by the number of
TM helices they contain. The number of TM helices for each set is given in column 1. Column pairs (2,3) and (5,6) gives the ratios of complex and simple TM
helices found in each set based on the z-score thresholds of f = 1.282 (false-negative rate of 10%) and f = 1.645 (false-negative rate of 5%) respectively. Similarly,
column 4 and 7 gives the expected number (No. of TMs × ratio of simple TMs) of simple TM helices in each set at those z-score thresholds.

contain ancestry information and hence functionally
important. But so far, the functional aspect of the
APMAP TM helix has not been characterized and presents an interesting case for further experimentation.
Application of the proposed necessary z-score criterion
for simple TM suppression in domain models highlighted
in our previous work

In our previous work [1], we described 15 exemplary
cases of protein domain models in Pfam that pick up
significant false hits or missed true hits due to the inclusion of TM segments into the model. These domains
listed in Table 6 were compiled from Supplementary
Tables S1, S2 and S3 of [1]. Here, we wish to examine
the relationship between the type of TM segments
(whether simple or complex) embedded in these domain
models and the associated false and missed hits through
our z-score criterion. Clearly, none of the hits described
in the Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3 from [1]
would surface in a database search if the respective TM
segments were excluded from the respective models.
Out of the 15 problematic domain model, 10 are single-TM-spanning and the other 5 are two-TM-spanning.
Given a twilight zone of -5.41 (f = 1.645) to -3.29 (f =
1.282), a TM helix with a z-score of above -3.29 is considered complex while below -5.41 is considered simple.
Hence, all the single-spanning domain models have simple TM helices since their z-scores are between -53.23

and -6.83. For 3 of the two-TM-spanning models, i.e.,
the PAP2 (PF01569.13), the PIG_P (PF08510.4) and the
CorA (PF01544.10) domain models, each model has at
least one simple TM segment. This was the expected
rate of occurrence based on Table 5. Among the TM
segments of these 3 models, 4 are considered simple, 1
is within the twilight zone and 1 is complex. The particular complex TM segment from CorA does not form
any alignment with respect to its hit (AAO72700.1).
Therefore, for all the above mentioned models, the associated false and missed hits were solely attributed to the
simple TM segments.
For the remaining two-TM-spanning models, PTPLA
(PF04387.6) and HCV_NS4b (PF01001.11), the z-scores
of their TM segments indicate that they are complex.
To recapitulate, the fragmentary-mode hit
(XP_001939830.1) that was detected by HCV_NS4b only
has a partial alignment to the second TM segment of
the model (’LLSPGASVVGVALALI’). Similarly, the global-mode hit (EAY72555.1) only has an alignment to the
first TM segment of the domain model PTPLA. In both
cases, the alignment to the other complex TM segment
were absent, hence these hits remained as false-positive
cases.
In hindsight, our z-score works as a necessary criterion for the exclusion of simple TM segments from
domain models with the desirable consequence of suppressing many false-positive hits in similarity searches.

The first column lists the fifteen problematic Pfam domains from our previous work [1] where they picked up significant false hits or missed true hits due to the
inclusion of TM segments in the model. These domains were compiled from supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3 of [1]. The second column gives the regions of
the validated TM in the Pfam HMM (hidden markov models) models with respect to the given references. In a nutshell, the HMM sequences were aligned to the
sequences provided in the literatures for the demarcation of the TM segments in the HMM models. The third column denotes the emitted HMM sequence of the
TM segments. The last three columns give the complexity xc, hydrophobicity xF measures and subsequent z-scores of the TM segments. Note that the complex
TM segments are highlighted in bold italic.

At the same, the criterion is not sufficient to suppress
all false-positive hits that might originate from chance
alignments of TM regions with hydrophobic stretches.

Discussion
The notion of simple and complex TM helices

At the beginning of this work, there was the observation
that TM regions are heterogeneous in the hydrophobicity/sequence complexity space. We found evidence that
there are subpopulations of TM segments. For one of
them, the TMs are more hydrophobic than average
TMs and they have a lower complex sequence enriched
in aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids. Correlating this to
an experimentally-derived hydrophobicity scale
[32,33,35], these TM helices have a higher propensity
for membrane insertion than the average ones. Originally, we tied these TM regions to single TM proteins.
As a trend, they are indeed more frequently occurring
in proteins with just one or very few TMs; yet, we
found that they may also be present in multi-spanning

membrane proteins. Since these TM regions are actually
mere hydrophobic anchors, we call them simple TMs.
On the other end, there are TM regions that are
enriched in charged (RDEH), structural (GP) and aromatic (FW) residues relative to the average TM. Thus,
these TM regions are not so hydrophobic and they have
higher sequence complexity. The listed residues are
expected to have some role in the biological function of
the TM proteins, for example, enabling the TM region
to participate in ligand binding, active sites, signal transduction, structural packing of TM helices and complex
assembly. We call these functional/structural TMs complex. As a trend, complex TMs are more frequent in
multi-TM proteins but they may also occur in singlemembrane spanning proteins.
It should be mentioned that the observation of TMs
with differing hydrophobicity and some of the structural
and functional implications have already been widely
discussed in the literature. For example, amphipatic
helices in multi-spanning TM proteins are a subtype of

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

complex TMs. Their hydrophobic moments influence
membrane protein folding [58] and their sequence patterns can be used to predict the burial status of residues
in the TM proteins [59]. We wish to emphasize that, in
this work, we derived the notions of simple and complex
helices from an unbiased analysis of the distribution of
annotated TM helix regions in the hydrophobicity/
sequence complexity space and its differences depending
on the number of TM regions per protein. Thus, we
have a statistical basis for ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ TM
helix distinction and, thereby, a justification for their
separation.
In this work, we propose a z-score framework (based
on hydrophobicity and sequence complexity assessment)
for this purpose (see equations (1) and (3)). Since the
distribution of simple and complex TM helices in this
space is overlapping, it is only possible to derive a
necessary criterion for the simple helices (z-scores
below a low threshold) and a sufficient criterion for the
complex helices (z-scores above a high threshold).
Clearly, there is a twilight zone for TM helices with
intermediate z-scores which are difficult to classify without a priori knowledge of the protein’s evolution and
function.
For practical purposes, we suggest to define a twilight
zone of z-score between -5.41 to -3.29 (computed at 5%
(f = 1.645) and 10% (f = 1.282) false-negative rates with
respect to the UniProt-derived functional TM helices).
TM-helices with z-scores above -3.29 are flagged as
complex helices while those below -5.41 as simple.
Simple and complex TM helices occur in either single- or
multi-spanning membrane proteins at different
frequencies

We have shown the possibility of complex helices in single-spanning membrane proteins. Instead of being
merely anchors, the sequences of the complex helices of
the disease-associated proteins and immune receptors
were able to confer sufficiently high homology information. On the other hand, the occurrence of simple
helices in the multi-spanning membrane proteins has
been illustrated via the TCDB database where we
showed that the masking of simple helices in homology
searches can improve the false-discovery rate of the classification without compromising on the sensitivity of the
searches. Yet, the masking of the complex ones wreaked
havoc to the sensitivity.
Taken together, the existence of either simple or complex TM helices in integral membrane proteins is independent of their topology. As a trend, we find that the
frequency of occurrence of simple helices in the membrane protein is proportional to the number of TM
helices found within. To emphasize further, the TM
helix of a single-spanning membrane protein is expected

Page 21 of 30

to be simple more than ~60% of all cases. For a multispanning protein, the frequency of occurrence of simple
helices decreases as its total number of helices increases.
This frequency stabilizes to around 0.3 (for a false-negative rate of 10%) when the total number of spanning
helices reaches to 6 and beyond.
About the extension of the sequence homology concept
to membrane proteins

Decades before the genomic era, the principle of inferring
evolutionary history from sets of homologous protein
sequences (e.g. 1964, fibrinopeptides [60]; 1967, cytochrome c [61]) to build believable phylogenetic trees has
already been established [62,63]. In the same period,
another principle for inferring homology through the trinity of sequence-structure-function has also been successfully applied to unknown sequences with high sequence
similarity to characterized structures (e.g. 1967, lactalbumin model is built using the X-ray coordinates of lyzosome where the two sequences are concluded to be
homologous for being 35% identical [64]; 1986, angiogenin
is homologous to pancreatic ribonuclease where the X-ray
structure of the latter is known [65,66]). Essentially, these
principles that govern the modus operandi of the present
day sequence homology concept remain unchanged.
Though homology has the precise meaning of “having
a common evolutionary origin” [67], it also carries the
loose meaning of “possessing sequence similarity or
being matched” when translated into computerized
homology searches. Maybe, it would be more appropriate to use the term “sequelog” coined by Varshavsky
[68] in this context. In reality, homology between
sequences is always a hypothesis while similarity, being
a measurable fact, can be rationalized either as chance,
convergent evolution or common ancestry [69-71].
While similarity by chance can be eliminated via stringent statistical criterion (e.g. E-value cutoff), ambiguity
between convergent evolution and common ancestry,
both inferred from similarity, can arise and this requires
extra considerations. As a guide, we must be mindful in
distinguishing between long stretches of similarity (typical for the construction of phylogenies) from those local
resemblances that are physiologically constrained for
particular side chains to form certain rudimentary structures (e.g. membrane spanning stretches from non-polar
residues; turns and loops from polar ones) [72].
Fast forward into the present genomic era, alignment
tools (e.g. BLAST [9], HMMER [73,74]) and domain
libraries (e.g. SMART [20,21], Pfam [12,13]) have
become the de-facto components of many automated
annotation pipelines to detect the homology and hence,
to infer the functions of many unknown sequences
accumulating in the relentlessly growing sequence databases. The collateral damage from such convenience is

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

an overestimation of homology since statistically significant similarities are interpreted as homology without an
alternate exit as convergence.
Although there have been previous attempts to create
separate BLOSUM-like matrices, like PHAT [75] and
SLIM [76], to perform homology searches for membrane
proteins, their performance is limited to clearly defined
TM protein families preferably with structural information. These non-symmetric matrices are generally not
applicable on uncharacterized sequences when the
choice of the score matrix to use for which residues is
unclear given unknown structural domains of the
sequences. In a nutshell, a generalized methodology to
perform homology searches for membrane proteins that
also naturally extends the present sequence homology
concept does not exist. Despite that, the sequence
homology concept has been silently extended to membrane proteins, most commonly through an automated
annotation pipeline. As a result, the unjustified sequence
similarity of simple TM helices to unrelated sequences
can transform itself into an eventual annotation error
propagation disaster [77,78]. In addition, the exaggerated
E-values of HMMER2 [73,74] embedded in annotation
pipelines might further complicate the issue [79].
To recapitulate, the question of whether TM helices
originate from convergent evolution or common ancestry
will remain a topic of theoretical debate. Instead, we
explored the legal separation of simple (implying convergent evolution) and complex (implying common ancestry) TM helices in this work. We provide quantitative
evidence that confirms their separability through the
sequence complexity/hydrophobicity plot. The overlap
between the functional TM-helices and the functional ahelices of globular domains (as a close structural analogue to the TM helix) in this plot serves as a first approximation for the applications of the sequence homology
concept for the membrane proteins. Subsequently, extensive investigations with the single- and multi-spanning
membrane protein sets (disease-related/immune receptors and TCDB) have reinforced that the sequence
homology concept can indeed be generalized to the complex TM helices regardless of the topology of the membrane protein. The practical key to the extension of the
sequence homology concept to membrane proteins is the
z-score criterion. The suppression of TM segments with
low z-scores in similarity searches keeps the simple TM
helices at bay since the latter (implying the results of convergent evolution) artificially inflate similarity scores that
do not help in explaining homology.
About the treatment of transmembrane helical segments
in protein domain models

Homology has the elusive meaning of “possessing
sequence similarity” when implemented as computerized

Page 22 of 30

homology searches. For these searches, statistically significant similarities can be misinterpreted as homology
given the lack of consideration for convergence as an
alternate explanation. For the membrane proteins especially, the ambiguity between common ancestry and
convergent evolution is made worse because TM helices
are, as a trend, homogenously hydrophobic.
Continuing previous work [1], we conclude that a
group of TM segments (in the form of membrane
anchors) from domain models most likely exhibits
sequence similarity as a result of convergent evolution.
We find that TM anchors and functional TM helices are
indeed distinct in amino acid composition and, hence,
different in sequence complexity and hydrophobicity.
Essentially, this basis establishes the notion of simple
(implying convergent evolution) and complex (implying
common ancestry) TM helices in nature and, hence, the
possibility of their separation with computational criteria.
Further investigations showed that the segregation of
simple TM helices from the protein sequences has a
positive impact on the sensitivity of homology searches.
Most interestingly, complex TM helices can occur in
single-spanning membrane proteins contrary to their
role as mere anchors, though at a much lower frequency
than the multi-spanning ones. In hindsight, complex
TM helices can occur in membrane proteins regardless
of their topology.
Finally, the existing sequence homology concept and
computational framework can be extended to the membrane proteins when simple TMs are suppressed. A
necessary criterion in the form of a z-score function was
introduced for the purpose of identifying the simple TM
helices (as well as the complex TM helices) within the
sequences so that they can be properly identified prior
to homology searches with methods based on sequence
similarity. This is similar to applying sequence complexity filters such as SEG [10] in similarity searches. It
should noted that, similarly to SEG that does not recognize all low-complexity sequence regions, our z-score
criterion will detect many but not all TMs that might
confuse searches for homologous sequences. In the end,
a pure statistical consideration of computed homology
relationships without looking at biological criteria [2]
remains insufficient.
Pertaining to the comment of the reviewer of our previous article [1] (see Introduction), it is indeed not
necessary to suppress complex TM segments within
domain models collected in protein domain databases
such as Pfam or SMART. Conflicts arise when simple
TM regions in domain models support seemingly significant, yet false-positive alignments with their hydrophobic runs. The conceptual advance described here
provides a z-score criterion to decide whether to include
certain TM helices into models of protein domains.

Conclusions
The trinity of similar sequence resulting in similarity of
structure and function is the cornerstone of the
sequence homology concept and the basis for functional
predictions for uncharacterized sequences. However, it
is not widely anticipated in the community that this
principle is generally applicable only for protein
sequence segments that represent globular structures
but not for non-globular segments that frequently occur
especially in proteins of eukaryotic origin. To apply
sequence homology considerations on proteins with
transmembrane regions (TMs), the original concept
requires modification to prevent false homology inferences among sequences that have nothing in common
except for extended stretches of hydrophobic amino
acid residues. In this work, we classify TMs into simple
and complex TMs. Whereas the former are essentially
pure hydrophobic stretches that merely anchor the
otherwise soluble protein to the membrane, the latter
ones have some functional residues at the generally
hydrophobic sequence background that give these TMs
additional structural (intra-membrane complex-forming)
or functional (ligand-binding, intra-membrane catalytic,
etc.) role. We provide a quantitative criterion based on
hydrophobicity and sequence complexity assessment to
distinguish simple from complex TMs. We recommend
masking simple TMs from query sequences prior to
sequence similarity searches.
Methods
Derivation of sequence data sets

Six characteristics datasets were derived from SCOP
alpha and membrane class (version 1.75) and UniProt
annotation file (dated 16-09-2010). They are the functional TMs, membrane anchors, signal anchors, functional a-helices, signal peptides and low-complexity
segments. Based on the UniProt annotations, all TM
proteins (functional TMs, membrane anchors, signal
anchors and multiple TMs) are extracted based on the
feature table keyword FT_TRANSMEM. We found that
the median length of all UniProt-derived TM helices is
21 residues. Globular sequences like functional a-helices
and signal peptides are based on the FT_HELIX and
FT_SIGNAL keywords respectively. Only RefSeq
sequences were processed. In addition, substrings and
repeated sequences were removed from each of the
derived dataset via the cd-hit algorithm [39] (with
options -n 5 -c 1).
Functional TM-helices

In our definition, a functional TM denotes a TM helix
that contains residue(s) that is expected to confer the
biological function of the protein analogous to globular
proteins. Hence, these residues are expected to bind
ligands, to be important for catalytic activity, etc. For

Page 23 of 30

the derivation of functional TMs, the TM entries are
further mined for the following specific keywords
FT_METAL, FT_BINDING, FT_ACTIVE. In the end,
two sets of functional TMs were derived. One was from
SCOP membrane class and another was from UniProt.
The rationale is that the SCOP-membrane derived set
would be more reliable since SCOP was manually
curated though the sampling was expectedly limited
(before and after the application of cd-hit, the number
of sequences is 984 and 83 respectively). On the other
hand, the UniProt-derived set, though much larger
(Before and after the application of cd-hit, the number
of sequences is 3923 and 1741 respectively.), was not
expected to be free of annotation errors. Together, the
two sets should give us an idea of the upper and lower
bound for our computation results.
Generally speaking, it is thought that the TM helix
in a single-spanning TM protein (e.g. for Type I and II
membrane proteins) functions as a simple anchor
(resulting from convergent evolution) and does not
confer its biological function in contrast to its globular
part in most cases. The signal and membrane anchor
sets are representative of this class of TM helices. For
the derivation of both sets, the protein sequences were
first checked for a single annotation of FT_TRANSMEM to ensure these entries are single-spanning TM
proteins.
Signal anchors

An additional description of ‘Signal-anchor’ was
enforced. An anchor is considered at N-terminus if it is
located on the first 100 amino acids position of its full
length sequence. The first 100 positions should coincide
with the positions of a signal peptide (expectedly at the
N-terminus) if one occurs. Before and after the application of cd-hit, the number of sequences is 2280 and
1767 respectively. Out of the 1767 signal anchors, 372
signal anchors were predicted as signal peptides are predicted as signal peptides both by the Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) and the neural network versions of SignalP. 1071 of the signal anchors are predicted by either
version of SignalP. The remaining 324 examples are
rejected as possible signal peptides by both versions.
Out of them, 218 are N-terminal signal anchors (within
the first 100 residues; see methods), 106 are more Cterminally located.
Membrane anchors

An additional description of ‘Anchor’ was enforced.
Before and after the application of cd-hit, the number of
sequences is 378 and 303 respectively. All except 15 of
the resulting set of 303 membrane anchors are located
on the C-terminal end of the proteins (i.e., beyond the
first 100 residues). None of the remaining N-terminally
located membrane anchors has a positive signal peptide
prediction from either SignalP-HMM or SignalP-NN.

Functional a-helices

As close structural analogues to the a-helical functional
TMs, a set of functional a-helices were derived from the
entries under the SCOP alpha proteins class. Besides the
FT_HELIX keyword, the SCOP entries were mined for
the same keywords FT_METAL, FT_BINDING, FT_ACTIVE. Before and after the application of cd-hit, the
number of sequences is 17193 and 1330 respectively.
Signal peptides

where L is the moving window size (i.e. size of 10, 12,
15, 18 in our work), V is the number of distinct groups
of amino acids (i.e, 18 since IVL is considered as a
group), mi is the number of amino acids that belongs to
a particular group where i = 1..18.
The regressed straight line and normal equation of the
normalized sequence complexity and hydrophobicity
datapoints

As close analogues to the signal anchor sets, a set of signal peptides were derived from the entries under the
SCOP alpha and membrane proteins class. The SCOP
sequence entries were checked against the UniProt
annotation file for the FT_SIGNAL keywords. This
resulted in 1664 sequences from SCOP alpha and membrane classes. After the application of cd-hit, only 262
signal peptides remained.

Given n data points (xc,i, xF,i) where i = 1...n and xc and
x F are the sequence complexity and hydrophobicity
measures respectively, one wishes to find the best
straight line xF = a + bxc that passes through these data
points. The intercept a and slope b can be found by
minimizing the sum of squared residuals given as

The SEG algorithm with parameters (window size/trigger complexity/extension complexity) 25/3.0/3.3 is
applied to the SwissProt sequence database (dated 2612-2010) resulting in 577373 segments. After applying
cd-hit for sequence redundancy removal and the subsequent suppression of sequence segments with less than
15 residues, 475207 low-complexity segments remained.
Whereas redundancy removal caused by substrings
and repeated sequences is essential, introduction of a
more stringent sequence identity threshold is not. Given
the short length of about 20 amino acid residues per
TM segment and the prevalence of aliphatic hydrophobic residues in them, very low sequence identity thresholds do not make sense since they would simply
obscure datasets. Most importantly, the 85% threshold
datasets do not give rise to any relevant change in the
summary statistics compared with Table 1. For example,
an 85% sequence identity threshold results in 1057 (UniProt-derived) and 79 (SCOP-derived) sequences respectively for the functional TM helices, 1427 for the signal
anchors or 239 for membrane anchors. As an example
for the row with sequence complexity window size 12 in
Table 1 (section A), the results are 2.43, 0.30, 79, 2.39,
0.30 and 1057. For Table 1 (section B), we get 0.33,
2.95, 79, 0.46, 2.87 and 1057.

Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer’s report 1

Shamil Sunyaev, Division of Genetics, Dept. of Medicine,
Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical
School
This manuscript investigates differences in sequence
complexity and hydrophobicity between transmembrane
helices serving purely structural role and transmembrane helices with additional functional roles. On the
practical side, the analysis of sequence complexity and
hydrophobicity is able to identify transmembrane helices
that are responsible for spurious sequence search hits as
opposed to functional transmembrane helices that are
useful for homology search. The manuscript is a follow
up on an earlier manuscript by the same authors that
suggested suppressing transmembrane segments in
domain models to increase sensitivity and specificity of
remote homology search. The results are of interest
both in terms of protein evolution and in terms of practical utility for sequence similarity searches.
Authors’ response
We thank the reviewer for highlighting these points.
Even if the straightforward, silent extension of computing
homology via sequence similarity from globular domains
to membrane proteins is probably correct in a number of
cases, it is important to identify this uncertainty as blind
assumption and to derive criteria aimed at excluding
situations when assigning homology in this simplified
manner is not justified.
I have two minor comments:
1) Since sequence complexity and hydrophobicity
seem to be correlated, I wonder why is not the inverse
co-variance matrix included in the Z-score.
Authors’ response
If the distribution of the points (˜ , xc )(we use the norx ˜
˜
˜
malized forms x = (x − μ ) /σ and xc = (xc − μc ) /σc)
is considered in the hydrophobicity/complexity plot (Figure 3A), we find that most of the points representing real
TMs are either of high hydrophobicity/low complexity
(simple TMs or of less hydrophobicity and higher complexity. The two alternative quadrants (low hydrophobicity/low complexity or high hydrophobicity/high
complexity) are not much populated and, from the viewpoint of the concept developed in this article, it is not
very clear how to deal with them meaningfully. Of
course, one can develop analytically more sophisticated
expressions for the Z-score as proposed by the reviewer
and, maybe, it might prove useful in the future. Here, we
wanted to have a very simple form of the Z-score that is

Page 25 of 30

symmetric across the four quadrants. At the end, we are
only after TMs with low Z-score.
2) On a more philosophical note, I would not state
that “homology” equals to common evolutionary origin
but rather than ‘homology” is a surprisingly high level of
similarity that cannot be explained by a functional constraint and, therefore, indicative of potentially common
evolutionary origin.
Authors’ response
We fully agree with the reviewer’s view. The problem is
in the practical detail: How do we know that there is no
functional constraint for query sequences (whether there
is convergent evolution or common ancestry)? From the
sequence analytic perspective, homology is usually
inferred from easily derived similarity measures of
aligned sequences because there is no other direct measure of common ancestry, not because this criterion is
especially elegant or rigorous. The practice becomes questionable when this caveat is forgotten.
Reviewer’s report 2

L. Aravind, Protein and Genome Evolution Research
Group, Computational Biology Branch, NCBI/NLM/NIH
I entirely agree with the chief result presented in this
article, namely: “Whereas simple TMs have the potential
to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to
generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential evolutionary information.” This has been known from
analysis of sequences of membrane proteins, particularly
those associated with specific biochemical functions.
The TM enzymes, channels and other unusual structures like the CYSTM or KASH, and to a lesser degree
certain receptors like 7TM and 5TM receptors, indeed
possess evolutionarily constrained features - resulting in
what the authors term complex TMs. Hence, these tend
not to “get corrupted” in sequence profile searches. The
salient point of this paper is the quantitative treatment
of this phenomenon - it would be of considerable value
for those interested in the problems concerning homology in TM proteins.
Authors’ response
We agree with the reviewer that the article provides a
framework for deriving the respective quantitative criteria. We do not exclude that, in the future, modified
forms of Z-score might prove even more efficient than the
analytical forms provided in this work.
Some points the authors might want to consider: “It is
possible that some of these simple helices harboring
lysine are in fact complex.”
This indeed seems to be the case. One might consider
the example of conserved intra-TM lysines that are present in both in animal rhodopsins and bacteriorhodopsins, which appear to be complex 7 TM proteins (e.g.

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

10988064). This lysine is the target of covalent modification by the retinal prosthetic group of these proteins
and is under evolutionary constraints. This seems to be
a lysine that is distinct from the lysines that might play
merely an anchoring role by interacting with negatively
charged head groups of lipids. If the lysines in anchoring
TMs are primarily linked to interactions with lipid head
groups then would predict their occurrence closer to
the ends of the helix.
“If this is indeed the case, then complex TM helices
(implying common ancestry) do also exist in singlespanning membrane proteins, contrary to their role as
only anchors (implying convergent evolution).”
One might consider the tail anchoring single TM like
the CYSTM (19933165) which appears to be single
complex TM family where a particular pattern of evolutionarily constrained cysteines point to a role beyond
mere anchorage.
The APMAP TM segment: Based on purely evolutionary considerations I am not sure if this TM segment was always complex. Firstly, as the authors state
this TM segment anchors the 6-bladed beta propeller
strictosidine synthase-like domain (It is better not
term it as a hydrolase as it catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler
condensation along with the release of a water molecule rather than a genuine hydrolysis). The TM region,
immediately N-terminal to the beta propeller is present
in all orthologs of this group ranging from bacteria,
plants and animals but is not conserved in sequence an observation more consistent with its role as an
anchor. It is possible that it acquired some additional
constraints in vertebrates alone, but additional evidence in support of this would be needed to test its
true complexity status.
Authors’ response
We thank the reviewer for providing additional
instructive examples of rhodopsins and CYSTM proteins.
With regard to the APMAPs, we find in our analysis
that the TM segment among the higher vertebrates
(APMAP_CHICK, APMAP_RAT, APMAP_BOVIN,
APMAP_HUMAN and APMAP_MOUSE) were either
complex or in twilight range at z-scores of -1.74, -2.92,
-3.76, -2.54 and -3.42 respectively. Most interestingly, we
found that glycine and proline (conserved motif PLLGA)
are conserved at the C-terminus while the aromatic residue, phenylalanine (conserved motif TFL) is conserved in
the N-terminus on the TM segment. Given that these
three residues were enriched in complex TMs in our
findings, the TM segment in these vertebrates are likely
more than just TM anchors and, possible, may have a
role for intra-membrane oligomerization of TM regions
from several proteins.

Reviewer’s report 3

Arcady Mushegian, Bioinformatics Center, Stowers Institute for Medical Research
The manuscript of Wong et al. presents good evidence
that the transmembrane segments in proteins, which
were thought to be compositionally biased and, because
of this bias, not very useful in probabilistic sequence
similarity searches, are in fact a heterogeneous group of
sequences. Some TM segments are indeed “simple” and
had better be masked before scanning the databases for
homologs, whereas others are more complex, have
family-specific distinguishing features and can be used
for homology searches. These observations are useful
and, I believe, largely correct, but I have three concerns.
First, I suggest a vigorous editing of all discussion of
homology. It is not until the second paragraph on page
20 that the authors get to defining homology, and do it
with a whiff of ambiguity: “Though homology has the
precise meaning of “having a common evolutionary origin”, it also carries the loose meaning of “possessing
sequence similarity or being matched” when translated
into computerized homology searches.” I think that we
should insist on the precise meaning of this word, and
do not feed the troll of the loose meaning.
Authors’ response
We share the concern of the reviewer that sequence
homology should be used for denoting “having a common
evolutionary origin”. In the text, we describe how the
term (and, more importantly, the concept) is used in
sequence annotation exercises elsewhere, even in circumstances that are not well covered by empirical evidence
such as SPs/TMs and other non-globular regions (in contrast to globular domains). Essentially, this article was
initiated by the critical review of such cases in the literature/databases where the meaning of homology was
watered down.
’Biological homology’ has a broad definition among
biologists from paleontologist to evolutionists [67]. A
computable definition of ‘homology’ that is all encompassing is an unsolved, formidable task. This practical
inconvenience is the driving force behind determining
sequence homology via sequence similarity; yet, this
proxy to hypothesize homology is only sensible as long as
the researchers are aware about the validity restrictions
of this criterion.
Homology exists regardless of our ability to detect it
(and this ability, by the way, improves as we have more
data and come up with the new ideas). Thus, in a sharp
contrast with what the title of the paper misleadingly
says, there is no need to “extend the NOTION of
homology to transmembrane proteins” –this notion
already covers all types of proteins.
Authors’ response

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

We do agree that homology exists regardless of our
ability to detect it and it is not our intent to create a
novel concept that membrane proteins can be homologous as well. However, we wish to provide arguments to
distinguish whether the traditional approach of determining homology via sequence similarity is appropriately
applied to given TM proteins and TM regions. The title
aims to explicitly caution the general reader against the
direct application of the sequence similarity criterion for
homology of membrane proteins given the heterogeneity
of TM helices.
What may be needed is the improvement of our skills
in distinguishing common ancestry from convergent or
parallel evolution in the case of compositionally biased
proteins.
Authors’ response
Indeed, an improvement in distinguishing convergent
evolution and common ancestry for compositionally
biased proteins is necessary. In this case, we formulated
the necessary z-score criteria to distinguish simple
(implies possible convergent evolution) from complex
(implies likely common ancestry) TMs.
This brings me to the second concern, and it is that
the authors leave the reader without any practical guidance. Yes, we are told to mask simple TMs and not to
mask complex TMs, but is there a program or a server
that would help one to do it? Can one collect the TM
segments using their favorite prediction engine and run
these segments through an R script, for example?
Authors’ response
In the mean time, we have a program source ready for
distribution to the community available from the WWW
site associated with this article (http://mendel.bii.a-star.
edu.sg/SEQUENCES/ProblemDomains-TM-classification/). The program is written as PERL modules and
requires the TM region(s) and input sequence to be
defined as inputs.
Speaking of this, are the efforts from Altschul and Yu
groups at NCBI on compositional bias and adjustment of
scoring matrices of any relevance. Will these approaches
treat different kinds of TM segments appropriately?
Authors’ response
Indeed, there are two complementary approaches to
deal with compositional bias in sequences. One relies of
score scaling computed from the queries and/or the database sequences’ amino acid compositions. There are several flavors of compositional bias correction described in
the literature; it is out of the scope of this MS to evaluate
their performance on regions that have the compositional
bias of a simple TM.
The alternative is suppressing/excluding compositionally biased regions using prior information. The filtering
of query sequences by sequence complexity computation
programs such as SEG have a long history in sequence

Page 27 of 30

similarity searches. Less systematically, other non-globular segments such as coiled coils are excluded from similarity searches [11]. As a result of this work, we suggest
to determine hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of
TM regions and to suppress those with low Z-scores (simple TMs). To note, SEG does not cover most simple TMs
as shown in this work.
It appears to us that both approaches have their right
for existence. And they have their own advantages and
deficiencies. Whereas the compositional bias score corrections are applicable for all types of sequences, they run
into difficulties over which part of the sequence to determine the amino acid composition (and using the whole
sequence is not a good choice in multi-segment proteins).
Usually, using prior knowledge is more robust for suppressing compositionally biased segments; yet, this is less
convenient if existing software pipelines do not include
all programs required.
My third concern is the manuscript style, reminiscent
of a personal memoir or an oral presentation. I do
believe that the quirks and idiosyncrasies of style have
their place in scientific literature, but in this case the
text is way too verbose. I suggest that the authors revise
the whole manuscript and suspect that the main text
and Figure Legends may become twice as short as they
are now, to the benefit of the reader.
Several random examples, in no way exhaustive:
p. 2: < <The work presented in this article has essentially emerged in response to an important comment by
one of the reviewers of our previous publications [1];
namely, the complete exclusion of TMs from domain
models in libraries such as Pfam [12,13] “would be a
huge disservice to the community” and certain domain
models involving TM regions have proven instrumental
in protein family classification as, for example, in the
cataloging of membrane transporters by Saier and coworkers [14-16].> >
–consider replacing everything before “certain domain
models” by “On the other hand,”
p.3: “For sequence similarity applications within the
sequence homology concept (i.e., for the extension of
the homology concept to membrane proteins), a quantitative criterion for distinction between complex and
simple TMs would be very helpful, not only in the context of automated annotation pipelines."–consider deleting completely and see whether the logic of the
narrative suffers at all.
p.4: “Figure 1A shows a three-dimensional fin-shaped
histogram of all TM helices spanning diagonally across
the sequence complexity and hydrophobicity space. The
cross-section of the skewed histogram (Figure 1B) shows
a tear shaped scatter plot.”
–describes exactly what is in the figure; appropriate in
an oral presentation, not so much in a written article.

Wong et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:57
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/57

In the Legend to Figure 1, the exact same sentences
are repeated, and more along the same lines is seen, e.g.
“The trace of the complexity and hydrophobicity from
the single-spanning set to the four-TM spanning set
indicates a progressive shift towards high complexity
and low hydrophobicity. The medians converge to
almost a singular cloud beyond the five-transmembranespanning set.”
–again, this is a literal description of what is in the
figure -redundant!
p. 5: “The data shows that there are a sizeable number
of outliers not following the trends and we can reconcile
this seemingly contradictory observation by acknowledging that simple and complex TMs can occur in proteins regardless of the total number of TMs.”
–consider replacing with “The data suggests that simple and complex TMs can occur in proteins regardless
of the total number of TMs.”
p. 7:"Our general observation that complex TM helices
are enriched with charged and structural residues” –tautology? “Complex TM” is by definition a TM that is
enriched in these residues, no?
Authors’ response
We thank the reviewer for his suggestions and for
selecting some examples. We carefully re-examined the
text of the article and modified/shortened some segments including some of those listed by the reviewer. At
the same time, we wish to emphasize that we are dissatisfied with the trend to a telegram-style writing in
scientific publications. Just showing a graph does not
necessarily evoke the same thoughts in the minds of
readers from diverse backgrounds and, to some, the
conclusion chain might not be clear. Therefore, it
makes sense to describe in words what the authors
think to see. Similarly, one and the same wording can
be associated with different meanings in the understanding of various researchers,” sequence homology”
being a prominent example. Thus, it is not superfluous
to emphasize that we have common evolutionary origin
in mind and that sequence similarity is only an imperfect means for its detection. To conclude, we wish to
provide utmost clarity in methodology and conclusion
chains and, at the same time, some entertaining reading if possible given the limitations due to the heavy
technicality of this work.
