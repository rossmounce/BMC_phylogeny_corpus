Abstract
Background: The pathogenic significance of coreceptor switch in the viral infection of HIV-1 is
not completely understood. This situation is more complex in subtype C infection where
coreceptor switch is either absent or extremely rare. To gain insights into the mechanisms that
underlie coreceptor requirement of subtype C, we screened several primary viral isolates and
identified a clinical sample that demonstrated a potential to grow on standard T-cell lines with no
detectable CCR5 expression. The subject was diagnosed with HIV-1 associated dementia in the
absence of opportunistic infections of the brain. To isolate molecular clones from this virus, we
devised a novel strategy based on anchor primers that target a sequence in the reverse
transcriptase, highly conserved among diverse subtypes of HIV-1.
Results: Using this strategy, we isolated 8 full-length molecular clones from the donor. Two of the
eight molecular clones, 03In94_D17 and 03In94_D24, (D17 and D24) generated replicationcompetent viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length viral sequences revealed that both clones
were non-recombinant subtype C viruses. They contain intact open reading frames in all the viral
proteins. Both the viral clones are endowed with several unique molecular and biological
properties. The viral promoter of the clones is characterized by the presence of four NF-kB binding
elements, a feature rarely seen in the subtype C HIV-1 LTR. Interestingly, we identified the
coexistence of two different forms of Rev, a truncated form common to subtype C and a full-length

form less common for this subtype, in both proviral and plasma virus compartments. An
exceptional property of the viruses, atypical of subtype C, is their ability to use a wide range of
coreceptors including CCR5, CXCR4, and several others tested. Sequence analysis of Env of D17
and D24 clones identified differences within the variable loops providing important clues for the
expanded coreceptor use. The V1, V2 and V4 loops in both of the molecular clones are longer due
to the insertion of several amino acid residues that generated potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
Conclusion: The exceptional biological and molecular properties of these clones make them
invaluable tools to understand the unique pathogenic characteristics of subtype C.

Background
Of the various subtypes of Human Immunodeficiency
Type I (HIV-1) and their recombinant forms, the subtype
C strains are responsible for the rapidly expanding epidemics in the most populous nations such as India,
China, Sub-Saharan African countries and southern Brazil. [1]. More than half the new HIV-1 infections in the
world [2] and nearly 99% of the infections of India [3] are
due to subtype C. During the past decade, the infection
incidence of subtype C in southern Brazil reportedly
increased from 3% to 30% [4] and eventually to 45% to
48% [5,6]. In view of the rapid global expansion of subtype C, this viral subtype is believed to have evolved to be
less pathogenic to the human host [7]. The expansion
dynamics of viral subtypes might be governed by cis-regulatory elements including the promoter sequences, as well
as viral proteins with regulatory, structural or accessory
functions. Subtype C strains of HIV-1 are endowed with
unique biological properties including the infrequent
coreceptor switch [8,9]. New viral infections are initiated
by viral strains that require the coreceptor CCR5 on the
target cell (R5 strains), regardless of the subtype nature
[10,11]. However, towards the later stages of the infection,
nearly half of subtype B strains switch their coreceptor
usage to CXCR4 (X4 strains) [12,13]. The emergence of X4
strains coincides with disease progression to AIDS [14]
and as a consequence, X4 viruses are believed to be more
pathogenic than R5 strains [15,16], a controversial proposition [17,18]. Importantly, coreceptor switch from
CCR5 to CXCR4 is less common in subtype C infection
[8,9,19-22], the pathological significance of which, is not
understood. In subtype C, presence of a small minority of
viruses that can use CXCR4 has, nevertheless been documented [8,21,23-26]. The actual incidence of CXCR4
using subtype C strains in natural infection, the time of
their appearance in the disease progression and the relevance of their emergence have not been elucidated.
The current methods of viral molecular cloning permit
isolation of only near full-length clones that are replication-defective. Molecular repair will be necessary to generate replication-competent viruses from such clones, a
procedure time consuming and laborious. Given that only
three subtype C infectious molecular clones are available

presently [27-29], with an objective to isolate molecular
clones of replication-competent viruses from subtype C
infection, especially from individuals with HAD, we
developed a cloning strategy that obviates a need for
molecular repair. We report here, the isolation of several
full-length molecular clones from the peripheral blood of
an HIV seropositive subject with HAD from India. A biological virus generated from this donor demonstrated a
potential to grow in standard T-cell lines suggesting
expanded coreceptor use, prompting us to generate
molecular clones from this virus.

Results
Isolation of molecular clones from an Indian donor with
HAD
Virus isolated from the plasma of an Indian donor with
HAD (BL94/03) proliferated on HOS-CCR5, HOS-CXCR4
cells and certain T-cell lines that lacked detectable surface
expression of CCR5 suggesting expanded coreceptor use
(see Additional file 1). With an objective to isolate infectious molecular clones from this subject, we developed a
cloning strategy that could be applicable universally to all
HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV subtypes. The strategy presented
here permits amplification of full-length molecular clones
from integrated proviral DNA, obviating a need for molecular repair strategy to generate infectious viruses. The
strategy depends on the use of a pair of anchor primers in
the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1 (Figure 1).
The anchor primers permit amplification of the provirus
from genomic DNA in two independent but complementary fragments which, when assembled, can generate fulllength viral clones. We engineered a restriction enzyme
site for MluI in the anchor primers by changing two base
pairs in two adjacent codons without changing the amino
acid sequence of RT (Figure 1). The region of RT selected
for anchor primer binding and MluI engineering is highly
conserved among all the major viral subtypes of HIV-1
(Figure 1, inset) therefore, viral genetic heterogeneity is
not likely to influence the cloning efficiency. Importantly,
MluI site is significantly underrepresented in diverse subtypes of HIV-1 (Table 1). For instance, MluI was found
only in 2 of the 162 near full-length subtype C sequences
available at the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. MluI
is also significantly underrepresented in other subtypes of

HIV-1 and HIV-2 (Table 1). Two external primers were
designed to bind the 5' and 3' ends of the 5' and 3' LTRs,
respectively. The external primers contained NotI and SbfI
sites, respectively, to permit directional cloning of the
amplified fragments (Figure 1). Both of these enzymes
recognize 8 bp sequences that are CG-rich, unlike the HIV1 genome, which is AT-rich. Additionally, sequence analysis confirmed absence of NotI recognition motifs and
under-representation of SbfI in diverse viral subtypes
(Table 1). Using the two primer pair combinations (a)
NotI forward primer and MluI reverse anchor primer and
(b) MluI forward anchor primer and SbfI reverse primer,
HIV-1 provirus can be amplified in two fragments, the 5'
and 3' fragments of 3.0 and 6.5 kb length, respectively.
We applied the above cloning strategy to genomic DNA
extracted from the peripheral blood of the donor BL94/
03. Genomic DNA extracted on day-7 of the viral coculture, where the p24 concentration in the medium was the
highest, was used for the amplification of the provirus.
Both of the amplified fragments were restriction digested
and simultaneously cloned into a vector engineered to
contain NotI and SbfI. We identified 8 full-length molecular clones from a single ligation reaction.
Two of the 8 viral molecular clones are infectious
Next, we tested for the expression of Tat protein during
virus replication. We cotransfected HEK293T cells with
each of the 8 HIV molecular clones separately, with a
reporter construct expressing GFP under the control of
HIV-1 LTR. All 8 molecular clones as well as the reference
subtype C clone Indie-C1 [27] upregulated the expression
of GFP suggesting the production of functional Tat (Figure
2A). Production of Tat protein in an infected cell signals
that a successful infection has been established including
entry, reverse transcription, nuclear transport, integration,
transcription and splicing. To detect active virus replication, we determined the quantity of p24 in the superna-

tant, as a measure of particle release, at multiple time
points. On day-3, only 4 of the 8 molecular clones (D17,
D21, D24 and D43) produced p24, while others (D7,
D28, D30 and D32) failed to make viral protein, suggesting defects in late events (Figure 2B). To evaluate the replication competence of the four clones that produced p24,
we added 10 ng equivalent of p24 from the culture supernatant to mitogen-activated donor PBMC and monitored
p24 synthesis up to day-22. Two of the four molecular
clones (D17 and D24) readily replicated in the PBMC and
secreted p24 into the medium starting from day-2, the
concentration of which, peaked on day-7. The other two
clones (D21 and D43) failed to replicate on PBMC (Figure
2C). Interestingly, unlike typical subtype C viruses, both
D17 and D24 generated morphologically distinct syncytia
in MT-2 cells (Figure 2D) and PBMC (not shown) that
were numerous, remained small and regular in shape. A
Western blot analysis of the virion proteins using seropositive donor sera revealed that all major viral proteins
could be detected in virions produced by both viral
clones. (Figure 2E). The defective nature of a majority of
the viral clones, 6 out of 8, is rather expected, given that
these are products of reverse transcription, an error prone
process. In a large number of previous studies, where several viral clones were isolated, a large majority of the
clones were found to be defective [30-34].
Sequence analysis of the full-length genomes
The complete nucleotide sequence of both D17 and D24
clones was determined. The proviral DNAs of D17 and
D24 contained 9,831 and 9,830 bp, respectively, from the
5' LTR to the 3' LTR. The reading frames of all the structural, regulatory and accessory proteins are preserved in
both D17 and D24. We determined the phylogenetic relationship of D17 and D24 sequences in their entirety (Figure 3A), as well as in the LTR (Figure 3B), env (Figure 3C)
and other individual viral genes (data not shown). In
these analyses, both of the viral molecular clones tightly

subtype C cluster, they are closely associated with the
Indian reference strains, but not with those of Africa or
Brazil, confirming their Indian origin (Figure 3A). To

ascertain their non-recombinant nature, we performed
genome-wide sequence comparison of both of the clones
to non-recombinant subtype-representative reference
clones (Figure 3D). In summary, these analyses identified

Analysis 2 viral functions from the viral molecular clones
Analysis of viral functions from the viral molecular clones. (A) Ability of the molecular clones to encode functional Tat protein.
The 8 molecular clones were individually cotransfected into HEK293 cells along with a reporter construct expressing EGFP
under the control of HIV-1 subtype C LTR. Subtype C reference molecular clone, Indie-C1, serves as a positive control and
the parental cloning vector as a negative control. GFP+ cells were documented 48 h following the transfection. (B) Virus production from the molecular clones. Spent media from the above cultures were monitored for p24 using a commercial antigencapture ELISA. Note that only 4 out of 8 clones express p24 indicating virus production. (C) The ability of virus produced by
the molecular clones to propagate through the PBMC in culture. Mitogen-activated PBMC from two different healthy donors
(striped and filled bars) were infected with the virus produced from the 4 molecular clones that secreted p24 in 'B' above. Viral
stocks equivalent of 10 ng of p24 were used for the infection. Following 4 h of incubation, the residual virus was removed by
washing, the cells were cultured and production of p24 into the culture medium was monitored using an antigen-capture assay.
Data for day-7 have been presented. Note that only two molecular clones, D17 and D24, were found to be infectious. (D)
Syncytium formation by the infectious molecular clones in MT2 cells. Both D17 and D24 induced syncytium formation (arrows)

transiently transfected with D17, D24 or Indie-C1 molecular clones. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected 72 h posttransfection and subjected to high-speed centrifugation to pellet the virus. Viral pellets were directly suspended in lysis buffer
and the viral antigens were separated on a 6 to 15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane
and analyzed by immunoblotting using pooled sera derived from individuals infected with HIV-1 subtype C. Predicted viral antigens are indicated.

both D17 and D24 to be non-recombinant subtype C
viruses.
Viral enhancer contains four NF-κB sites
The molecular clones, D17 and D24, are both endowed
with several molecular features, some of which are representative of subtype C, while others are unique. The
unique properties include the presence of four putative
NF-kB sites in the LTR, expression of non-truncated form
of Rev and extended V1/V2 domains in Env.

sequences of D17 and D24 (shaded) were compared with
representative HIV-1 sequences of subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G,
H, J and K. subtype C sequences from India were also
included in the analysis. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed on the basis of the hidden Markov model nucleotide
alignment of full-length HIV-1 genomes. Subtype O pCMO2
sequence was used as the outgroup. Horizontal branch
lengths are drawn to scale with the scale bar representing
0.05 nucleotide substitution per site whereas the vertical

indicate the bootstrap values that support branching, out of a
total of 1,000 resamplings. The reference sequences for different HIV-1 groups and subtypes were obtained from the
HIV sequence database[97]. Phylogenetic trees of D17 and
D24 based on the LTR (B) and the Env (C) sequences. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from full-length LTR and
Env nucleotide sequences by using the neighbor-joining
method. Major subtypes of HIV-1 group M were used as reference sequences. Trees were rooted by using subtype O
strains as outgroups. Accession numbers for each of the references sequences used in the above plots could be obtained
by using the name of the viral strain shown (D) Plot of similarity of D24 to a set of reference subtype genomes. Analysis
was performed with the SimPlot program using a window
size of 400 nucleotides and a step size of 20 nucleotides.
Positions containing gaps were excluded from the comparison. The x-axis indicates the nucleotide positions along the
sequence alignment. The y-axis denotes the distance between
compared sequences plotted at the midpoint of the 400nucleotide window. Identical results were obtained with the
clone D17 (data not presented).

An analysis of the LTRs using the motif search software
[35] confirmed the presence of several potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the LTR of both the
clones. These sites include the AP1, NF-Y, NF-AT, USF,
LEF-1, p54 sites and several others in the modulatory
region, NF-κB sites in the enhancer region and Sp1 sites
and the TATA box in the core promoter. The enhancer element of D24 is characterized by a total of 4 NF-κB binding
motifs (Figure 4A). Two of the threee κB-motifs (I and II)
are identical to each other in sequence (GGGACTTTCC)
that are the same as found in the subtype B LTR. The third
κB-motif, proximal to the Sp1 sites, however, is unique in
the sequence content and differs from the other two at two
sites (GGGGCGTTTCC, differences underlined). As the
latter is found only in subtype C LTR (C-LTR) we refer to
this motif as C-NF-κB site. Importantly, in D24, in addition to the three canonical κB sites, we identified an additional (fourth) κB-motif 12 bp upstream of the κB region.
The sequence motif of this κB site (GGGACTTTCT) deviated from the canonical HIV-1 κB sequence at position 10
where a 'T' is substituted for a 'C' (Figure 4A). Further,
although the enhancer of D17 is characterized by the presence of four κB-sites like that of D24, additional level of
κB polymorphism was evident. In this clone, the κB II site
was found to be identical to the κB IV site. Consequently,
D17 contains an authentic C-κB site, a canonical κB-site
and two variant κB elements. Given that several cellular
κB-sites deviate from the consensus motif, yet bind specific Rel-family members [36], the small deviation we
observed at position 10 of the κB-like motifs in D17 and
D24 may not have significant impact on the LTR function.
D17 and D24 encode the longest Rev consisting of 126
amino acid residues
Rev protein of HIV-1 plays a key role in viral replication
by regulating the nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNAs
[37]. Both D17 and D24 contained a Rev open reading
frame encoding 126 amino acid residues as a result of
amino acid-substitution for two of the natural stop
codons (Figure 4B). In these clones, the first stop codon
(UAA) at position 101 (HXB2 coordinate) that is functional in all of the subtype C viruses has been substituted
by 'GAA' coding for a glutamic acid residue. The second
stop codon (UAG) in frame at position 117 (HXB2 coor-

The three canonical NF-κB sites and the upstream

variation in diverse subtypes of HIV-1. The C-terminus of D24 Rev is compared with that of diverse viral subtypes. The amino
acid residues are represented in the single letter code. The coordinates of the amino acid residues are as per the HXB2 molecular clone (at the top). Subtypes A, A/E, G and C strains contain a 7 amino acid insertion at the residue 95 of HXB2 equivalent
as shown. At residue 101, only subtype C strains typically contain a stop codon (highlighted by shading) that is non-functional in
D24. A second stop codon (highlighted) at position 117 that terminates Rev in all non-subtype C strains is also non-functional
in D24. Rev translation in D24 is terminated by a third stop codon (highlighted) located after a tyrosine residue at position 126.
The expected size of the Rev proteins from different subtypes is shown on the right hand side. Stop codons are indicated by an
asterisk; aa, amino acid. (C) Presence of two different variant forms of Rev in the molecular clones. Amino acid sequences at

clones are aligned. Rev sequence of HXB2 is also included for comparison. Dots represent sequence homology and dashes
gaps. The sequence coordinates are as per HXB2. Asterisks indicate putative stop codons (see 'B' above). Coexistence of two
different variant forms of Rev in the donor provirus (D) and plasma virus (E). Using a pair of primers, Rev exon-2 was amplified in a DNA PCR using genomic DNA extracted from the PBMC of the donor BL94. Alternatively, viral RNA was extracted
from the plasma sample, reverse transcribed and the exon-2 of Rev was amplified using template-specific primers. The
sequence information of the anti-sense strand was obtained directly from the PCR or RT-PCR amplicons. The codon of the
amino acid residue 101 is boxed. Presence of both 'C' and 'A' at position 8695 (amino acid residue 101 of Rev) on the antisense strand confirmed the simultaneous existence of two different forms of Rev in the provirus as well as in the plasma virus.

dinate) and functional in all non-C subtypes has also
been replaced by 'GAG' coding for a glutamic acid residue.
In both D17 and D24, translation of Rev is terminated at
a third stop codon (UAG) that is located 6 bp downstream
from the second stop codon, inserting two additional
amino acid residues, cysteine and tyrosine, into the protein at the C-terminus (Figure 4B). As a consequence of
these variations, Rev in D17 and D24 consists of a total of
126 amino acid residues, but not 107 residues typical for
subtype C strains.
Coexistence of two length-isoforms of Rev in the donor
viral pool
To examine if the non-truncated Rev is the characteristic
feature of the donor from whom the virus was isolated, we
determined the Rev sequence of the 6 other non-infectious molecular clones that we isolated in this work (Figure 1). Surprisingly, we identified that only 4 of the 8
molecular clones (D17, D24, D30 and D32) contained a
full-length Rev, while the other 4 (D7, D21, D28 and
D43) possessed a truncated Rev (Figure 4C). The stop
codon at position 101 was functional in the latter set of
the viral clones yielding truncated Rev. To ensure that the
presence of the non-truncated Rev in half of the viral
clones was not a cloning artifact, we amplified the Rev
gene from the donor genomic proviral DNA and directly
sequenced the amplified product. At position 8695 of
D24, we identified the presence of both 'G' and 'T' nucleotides (Figure 4D) confirming the coexistence of the
length-isoforms of Rev in the integrated provirus. Since
proviral DNA represents only the archived, but not the
actively proliferating virus in the blood, we determined
the sequences of Rev in the plasma virus. Total RNA was
isolated from the original plasma sample and using
sequence specific primers exon-2 of Rev was reverse transcribed, amplified and the sequence information was
obtained directly from the PCR amplicon. In the viral
cDNA, presence of both 'G' and 'T' nucleotides at position
8695 was evident (Figure 4E), confirming the presence of
two different viruses also in the plasma, one expressing
the truncated Rev and the other the full-length Rev.
Other features of D17 and D24 common to subtype C
viruses
Subtype-specific variations have been identified within
the pyrimidine-rich 3 bp bulge of TAR. Subtypes A and D
contain a 'UUU' at position 22 to 24 of the TAR from the
transcription start site that constitutes the bulge. In subtype E, the bulge consists of only two bp of 'UC'. In other
subtypes, a 'UCU' is found at this position. Surprisingly,
in D24 we found 'UCC' constituting the bulge of the TAR
(data not presented) a variation that has not been
reported previously to the best of our knowledge. The Tat
protein in D17 and D24 is encoded by two exons and consists of 101 amino acid residues. Of the 7 signature amino

acid residues that we previously identified in subtype C
Tat [38], three are preserved in D17 and D24 (S31, S57
and E63). Two important subtype-specific properties, the
substitution of cysteine at position 31 by serine and the
lack of a RGD motif in exon-2 are preserved in both
clones. The Vpu protein of subtype C viruses is characterized by two motifs at either end of the protein. A highly
variable 5 amino acid sequence motif is seen at the N-terminus of subtype C Vpu that is expected to extend the
membrane-spanning domain [30]. We found an insertion
of YKLTV in both D17 and D24 at this location. A four
amino acid motif of LRLL, which is found at the C-terminus of subtype C Vpu [39], is also preserved in both of the
clones. Both D17 and D24 encode an Env of 875 amino
acid residues that are almost identical except for variations
at 3 positions. The Env contains a signal peptide, gp120
and gp41 of 27, 494 and 354 amino acid residues, respectively. The motif, REKR, the cellular furin protease cleavage site at the junction of gp120 and gp41 is preserved.
gp120 and gp41 of both the clones contain 31 and 4 putative N-glycosylation sites, respectively, including the
'sequon' at 451 which is unique for subtype C isolates of
HIV-1 [40]. Additionally, both clones lack the N-glycosylation site (position 308 in D17 and D24) just upstream
of V3 loop, as is typical of subtype C isolates [40]. Both
the clones contain all three signature amino acid variations, (E340N, A350R and E429K) of Indian subtype C
gp120 [41].
Replication kinetics of viruses produced by molecular
clones in different cell types
We examined the growth kinetics of D17 and D24 in different mammalian cells and cell lines including primary
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDM), an astrocytoma cell line GO-GCCM and Herpesvirus saimiri transformed T-cells, the CN2 cells (Figure 5). Monocytes were isolated from fresh
blood using two rounds of density gradient centrifugation
[42]. CN-2 cells represent heterologous, CD8-devoid,
immortalized PBMC population of a seronegative donor
that can support virus proliferation efficiently, as reported
previously [43]. Both D17 and D24 and three different
reference viral clones readily proliferated in PBMC, monocytes, CN-2 and the astrocytoma cells. The presence of p24
was detectable in the media starting from day-2 of culture
that reached peak levels around day 10 or 11 in the PBMC,
monocytes and the astrocytoma cells. In CN-2 cells, the
peak was observed a little earlier, on day 8. By and large,
the growth kinetics of both D24 and Indie-C1 appeared
comparable in all cell lines tested in terms of p24 levels
and the time needed to reach the peak levels. The growth
kinetics of D17, although, followed the same profile; the
magnitude of p24 produced was significantly lower in
comparison to that of D24 in all the four types of cells.
Surprisingly, the replication kinetics of both D17 and D24

Replication kinetics of subtype C molecular clones in different cell types

Replication kinetics of subtype C molecular clones in different cell types. CD8-depleted and mitogen-activated PBMC (A)
monocyte-derived macrophages (B) CN-2 cells, an Herpesvirus saimiri immortalized cell line (C) and a human brain astrocytoma cell line, GO-G-CCM (D) were infected with 500 TCID50 units of different viral molecular clones. While proliferation of
D17and D24 was compared with that of Indie-C1 in all the cell types, in PBMC alone, subtype B standard clones NL4-3 and
86.9 (open symbols) were also used. Viral replication was monitored by quantifying p24 levels in the culture medium at defined
time points using a commercial antigen-capture ELISA. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. The data are presented as mean quantity of p24 released in triplicate wells ± 1 SD.

and Indie-C1 are comparable in activated PBMC and the
astrocytoma cell line GO-G-CCM. Astrocytoma cells normally do not support viral proliferation to the same extent
as PBMC. Individual cell lines could differ significantly in
several biological properties, hence it is necessary to
examine viral proliferation in diverse cell lines of neuronal origin and importantly in primary fetal astrocytes.

Expanded coreceptor use of D17 and D24
Since the biological virus of the donor originally proliferated on standard T-cell lines, we examined the coreceptor
requirement of the molecular clones isolated. We used
HOS cell lines expressing CD4 and one of the several coreceptors including CCR5, CXCR4, CCR1, CCR2B or CCR3
in these assays. In addition to D17 and D24, we used ref-

erence HIV-1 molecular clones with known coreceptor use
profile as controls, Indie-C1 for CCR5, NL4-3 for CXCR4
and 89.6 for both the coreceptors. Cells were infected with
500 TCID50 units of the viral stocks and the amount of
p24 secreted into the medium was determined at different
periods (Figure 6A). The reference molecular clones IndieC1 and NL4-3 used only CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively,
for target cell infection and failed to use other coreceptors.
Virus 89.6, in contrast, used all the coreceptors tested. Significantly, both D17 and D24 used all five coreceptors
nearly with equal efficiency, although the clones appeared
to prefer CCR5 and CXCR4 over others. The clone D17
released significantly low quantities of virus as compared
to D24 with any of the 5 coreceptors tested suggesting that
the differential replication potential of this clone is possibly not because of a bottleneck at the cell entry level (data
not shown). To confirm receptor- and coreceptor-dependent nature of cell infection of the viruses, we used small
molecule or monoclonal antibody inhibitors, at appropriate concentrations, to block viral infection (Figure 6B).
We observed 85–90% inhibition in D24 viral infection in
the presence of two different anti-human CD4 monoclonal antibodies (generated in-house), soluble CD4,
small molecule inhibitors against the coreceptors (TAK779 and JM-2987 for CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively) or
monoclonal antibodies to the coreceptors. We obtained
similar levels of reduction in virus titers also with D17 and
other reference viruses in the presence of appropriate
inhibitors (data not shown).
V3 loop of both D17 and D24 represents a typical R5
consensus amino acid sequence
To understand the basis for the expanded coreceptor use
of the molecular clones D17 and D24, we first examined
the molecular features of the V3 loop in the env as the V3
loop significantly influences and determines coreceptor
preference of HIV isolates [44]. The V3 loop of D17 and
D24 contains 35 amino acid residues that are representative of CCR5-using subtype C consensus sequence (Figure
6C). All the molecular features typical and suggestive of
CCR5 use are significantly preserved in the V3 loop of
D17 and D24. The presence of a neutral serine at position
11 and of an aspartic acid or aspargine with a negatively
charged side chain at position 25 is suggestive of CCR5
use [45,46]. Both the clones contain a serine and a
glutamine at these positions, respectively. The crown of
V3 loop in both the clones contains GPGQ motif highly
suggestive of CCR5 use [23]. The V3 loop of both the
clones contained a net charge of +5. A net charge of +5 or
less is indicative of CCR5 use [47]. The V3 loop lacks additions or deletions of amino acid residues. Furthermore,
the N-glycosylation site within the loop is preserved, both
properties being suggestive of CCR5 use. Molecular features of the V3 loop of D17 and D24 were suggestive of
only CCR5 use. The clones, nevertheless, used a range of

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

coreceptors strongly indicating that Env domains outside
the V3 loop could be playing a critical role in determining
coreceptor use. In subtype B infection, sequence variations within V1/V2, V4 and/or C4 have been reported to
influence and modulate coreceptor preferences of the viral
env although V3 primarily regulated the cell infection
[48,49,49-52].
Non-V3 loops of the env probably govern the expanded
coreceptor use in D24
To determine if non-V3 env loops (V1/V2, V4 and V5)
and/or C4 domain of D17 and D24 might possess unique
molecular features suggestive of expanded coreceptor use,
we aligned amino acid sequences of D24 with all the three
available infectious reference molecular clones of subtype
C that are known to use only CCR5 (Figure 6C). This analysis identified two molecular features unique to D24.
First, D24 contained the largest V1, V2 and V4 loops when
compared to the reference molecular clones as a consequence of amino acid insertions (Figure 6C). The V1 loop
of Indie-C1 and MJ4 contained 23 residues while that of
HIV108i contained the shortest loop with only 16 residues. In contrast, D24 contained a loop consisting of 30
amino acid residues. In a similar fashion, the V2 and V4
loops of D24 contained several stretches of amino acid
insertion when compared to the reference molecular
clones and the loops are larger by several amino acids.
Second, inserted amino acid residues in D24, created
additional putative N-linked glycosylation sites in these
loops. For instance, insertion of a 7 amino acid stretch
(ITYNATI) at the N-terminus of the V1 loop generated two
potential gylcans (NITYNATI) in D24 (Figure 6C). An
analysis for potential N-linked glycosylation sites in
gp120 identified that D24 contained the largest number
of glycans when compared to the other three subtype C
reference molecular clones. While D24 contained a total
of 31 such sites in gp120, the Indie-C1, MJ4 and
HIV1084i clones contained 27, 23 and 24, respectively.
The additional glycans in D24 are mapped to V1, V2 and
V4 loops. Loss, rather than gain, of potential glycans in
Env is, by and large, associated with expanded coreceptor
use [53].
Subtype C viruses from other donors with HAD use only
CCR5
Clones D17 and D24 are exceptional, in that they are the
first subtype C molecular clones to demonstrate expanded
coreceptor use including that of CXCR4 and CCR5. Given
that these clones originated from a donor with HAD, we
sought to know whether expanded coreceptor use could
be a general characteristic attributable to viruses derived
from subjects with HAD. To answer this question, we isolated biological viruses from peripheral blood lymphocytes of two seropositive donors without neurological
consequences (BL43/03, S53/03) and three subjects diag-

Coreceptor phenotyping of the viral molecular clones
Coreceptor phenotyping of the viral molecular clones. (A) Profile of coreceptor use in HOS cell lines. HOS cell lines expressing CD4 and one of the several coreceptors including CCR1, CCR2B, CCR3, CXCR4 and CCR5 or CD4 alone or CCR5 alone
were tested for viral infectivity. These cell lines were infected overnight with one of the viral molecular clones (89.6, NL4-3,
Indie-C1, D17 and D24), residual virus was washed off and the cells were incubated up to 14 days. Secretion of p24 into the
medium was monitored every third day using a commercial kit and data for day-7 are presented here. Data are representative
of at least four independent experiments and presented as mean quantity of p24 released in triplicate wells ± 1 SD. Identical
results were obtained at other time points. (B) Inhibition of the viral infection using receptor-specific inhibitors. Target cells,
HOSCD4CXCR4 and HOSCD4CCR5, were infected with the viruses in the absence or presence of one of the inhibitors (Inh)
at appropriate concentration. CXCR4 inhibitor bicyclam JM-2987 at 60 nM, CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779 at 20 µM, soluble CD4
(sCD4) at 1 µg/ml and two different anti-human CD4 monoclonal antibodies F2 and F4 at 0.5 µg/ml were used. In a similar
fashion, we used coreceptor-specific monoclonal antibody pools (Mab), 0.5 µg of each antibody, to block viral infection, antibodies # 1012 and # 1009 for CXCR4 (Pro-science, Poway, CA) and antibodies #182 (R&D systems) and #624085 (BD Biosciences) for CCR5. The residual virus and the inhibitors were removed after overnight incubation and the p24 production was
monitored in the culture supernatants. Data for only D24 virus on day-7 post-infection are presented here and identical results
were obtained at other time points and with other viruses. (C) Amino acid sequence comparison of the gp120 extra-cellular

subtype C infectious molecular clones. Dots indicate sequence homology and dashes gaps. For the V3 loop, subtype C consensus sequence is presented at the top and the positions 11 and 25 and the 'GPGQ' motif have been highlighted using open
boxes. Putative N-linked glycosylation sites have been highlighted using shaded boxes. Figures in the parentheses indicate the

nosed with HAD (BL95/03, BL96/03, A43/05). Viral
stocks were prepared and the TCID50 titer of each stock
was determined as described in methods. All biological
viruses, regardless of their HAD status, used only CCR5,
but no other coreceptor, for cell infection (see Additional
file 2A). D24 included in the assay used all the five coreceptors. Sequence comparison of the variable loops of the
Env between D24 and the biological viruses broadly
yielded similar results (see Additional file 2B). D24 contained the largest loops of V1, V2 and V4 as a result of
multiple amino acid insertions, when compared to the
biological viruses and also contained the largest number
of N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120.

Discussion
In this report, we described the construction, biological
characterization and sequence analysis of infectious
molecular clones of HIV-1 subtype C from one Indian
subject with HAD. Although the resulting clones may not
have originated from individual viruses, the original
genetic diversity of the viral quasispecies is expected to be
preserved, given that combination of two independent
fragments is a stochastic process. To permit directional
cloning of the amplified viral fragments, we selected
restriction enzymes that are less represented in diverse
viral subtypes (Table 1). The restriction enzyme site, MluI,
engineered into the anchor primers did not change the
original amino acid sequence in RT that is highly conserved among diverse viral subtypes (Figure 1). Unlike the
anchor primers, the external primers binding the LTR are
optimized to amplify subtype C sequences. The extreme
ends of the viral LTR are adequately conserved within a
subtype but not across diverse viral subtypes. It is, therefore, essential to optimize the external primers to amplify
a given viral isolate based on the subtype nature.
All the previous studies, thus far, used virus isolates or
clones of HIV-1 isolated from selected subjects to characterize the coreceptor requirement of the subtype C viruses
[8,21,23-26,54]. Given the magnitude of genetic diversity
present in the viral quasispecies in such preparations,
molecular determinants responsible for governing coreceptor use is difficult to analyze. In view of this limitation
of biological viruses, we developed the cloning strategy
described here. Furthermore, this cloning scheme could
be widely applied to other retroviruses including N and O
groups of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV as MluI site is underrepresented in all these viruses.
In an attempt to delineate the viral determinants responsible for the low prevalence of HIV-associated dementia
(HAD) in India caused by HIV-1 subtype C, we previously
identified a natural variation at position 31 of subtype C
Tat and demonstrated loss of monocyte chemotactic activity for subtype C Tat without loss in transactivation prop-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

erty [38]. We hypothesized that the Tat variation could be
one of the factors for the low incidence of HIV-1 encephalitis and HAD in India. Apart from Tat, other viral proteins
like Nef also have been shown to demonstrate chemokine-like properties [55,56]. The relative role of these as
well as other viral proteins in modulating the leukocyte
migration has not been systematically evaluated. This
analysis is more relevant to subtype C strains considering
the defective monocyte-chemokine nature of the C-Tat
protein. To understand if functional redundancy exists
between viral proteins in the chemokine-like property or
the proposed loss in the chemokine property of subtype C
Tat is compensated for by a variation co-selected in a different viral protein, it is important to subclone the viral
proteins from a single replication-competent molecular
clone rather than from genomic DNA, which is representative of quasispecies.

κB site polymorphism in subtype C LTR
Of the several variations reported in the LTR of the viral
subtypes, polymorphism within the κB binding sites of
the C-LTR is quite unique. While a large number of C-LTRs
contain three NF-κB sites in contrast to the usual two sites
seen in several other subtypes [57-59], a significant
minority contains a fourth motif that is a canonical κB site
or κB-like element [58,60-62]. Previously we demonstrated that nearly 6% (35/608) of primary viral isolates of
India contained length polymorphism in the enhancer
[3,63]. The biological significance of the κB polymorphism in a significant number of C-LTRs has not been
adequately evaluated. A gain of function has been
ascribed to the C-LTR as it contains three κB elements as
opposed to two in subtype B LTR. Extension of this logic
further should make the D24 LTR a stronger viral promoter as it contains four κB sites. We tested this hypothesis in a variety of mammalian cells by placing a reporter
gene under the control of several C-LTRs including that of
D24. D24 LTR demonstrated the strongest reporter activity among all the LTRs tested [64] suggesting that the existence of a putative fourth κB-like site probably confers a
strong transcriptional activity on this promoter. We will
be extending these studies further to elucidate the importance of the κB polymorphism in subtype C promoter
using D24 LTR.
Truncated Rev appears to have a functionally important
role in subtype C infection
Rev consists of two exons with exon-1 coding for 25
amino acid residues in all viral subtypes. In contrast,
exon-2 exhibits extensive and often subtype-specific
sequence variation as well as length polymorphism. A
large majority of the strains of subtypes A, AE and G contain an exon-2 of 98 residues consequently making a
mature Rev of 123 amino acids. Almost all the isolates of
subtypes B, D and F and a large majority of H, J and K con-

Retrovirology 2008, 5:25

tain an exon-2 that is shorter by 7 residues, thereby making a mature Rev of 116 amino acids. Remarkably, a vast
majority of subtype C isolates make the smallest Rev protein of only 107 residues as exon-2 in this subtype contains a premature stop codon leading to the deletion of
the 16 amino acid residues at the C-terminus [30]. The termination is a result of a natural variation at the residue
101 of HXB2 equivalent where a 'CAA' coding for a
glutamine is replaced by the termination codon 'UAA'
(Figure 4B). Rev in Indie-C1, an infectious subtype C
molecular clone, contains additional deletions and is
shorter by as many as 25 amino acids compared to subtype B protein yet retains biological function [27]. Further, like subtype A, most of subtype C strains contain a
stretch of 7 amino acid residues inserted into the codon
95 equivalent of HXB2 (Figure 4B).
The most unexpected finding of this study is the coexistence of two different forms of Rev in the proviral DNA and
in the active plasma virus. We detected viruses containing
both the truncated and the full-length forms of Rev at
comparable levels in the patient DNA and plasma samples (Figure 4D and 4E). In a sequencing reaction, a
minority variant population must be present at a frequency of at least 10–20% to generate a distinct signal
[65]. Conspicuous signals at the position 8695 in the
sequencing reaction not only confirmed the presence of
both the Rev variants in the sample but also their existence in significant proportion in the viral population.
Presence of Rev in two different forms in the same subject
was unexpected and the relevance to disease progression
to dementia is not understood. However, co-dominant
expression of both the Rev variants (the absence of domination of one of these forms over the other) was surprising, given that such dominance is common for several
viral variations. Importantly, coexistence of the Rev isoforms in the archived proviral compartment, at an equivalent proportion, points to the non-transient, prolonged
and stable coexpression of these two Rev forms throughout the infection process of the donor. Prolonged and stable coexpression of these Rev forms is also strongly
indicative of the functional importance of both the Rev
forms that serve probably non-complementary and nonoverlapping functions. Continued expression of truncated
Rev, in the presence of full-length Rev, suggests independent functional importance of this Rev form for subtype C
infection.
Rev length variations in subtype C
Searching all the Rev sequences of subtype C in the Los
Alamos database, representing global viral distribution,
we identified length polymorphism in only 3% (4 out of
128) of the subtype C sequences analyzed. Interestingly,
Rev in these subtype C variants, D17 and D24 included,
codes for a protein containing 126 amino acid residues,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

not 123 as in other subtypes or 107 in subtype C, as a
result of replacement of two stop codons. A glutamic acid
residue replaces both the stop codons at positions 101
and 117 (HXB2 coordinate), by UAA to GAA and UAG to
GAG substitutions, respectively (Figure 4B). Both the stop
codons are replaced by single nucleotide variations that
are highly conserved in subtype C suggesting a strong positive selection at these positions. Expression of gp41 in a
different reading frame by the same nucleotide sequence
adds an additional level of complexity for the analysis to
identify the driving forces operating in the positive selection of these variations. A close examination of the
sequences, however, indicates that selection of the first
and second stop codon variations in subtype C is probably driven by Rev and gp41, respectively. The U8695G variation in these subtype C variant isolates, D24 included, at
the first Rev stop codon, is a silent mutation that doesn't
change the amino acid residue in gp41 (CUU and CUG
both code for a leucine). Rev, therefore, could be the driving force for the positive selection of this variation. The
T8742G variation, in contrast, substitutes a lysine residue
for asparagine in gp41. The U8742G variation couldn't
have been selected by Rev as in a large majority of subtype
C isolates, the protein is terminated upstream at the position 8695 that constitutes the first stop codon. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the U8742G variation is
positively selected by gp41 in subtype C viruses. In all the
subtype C isolates with non-truncated Rev, D17 and D24
included, the protein consists of 126 amino acids as three
additional residues (glutamic acid, cysteine and tyrosine)
are added at the C-terminus as compared to subtype A that
makes Rev of 123 amino acids. In a recent study on the
Sydney blood bank cohort of long-term survivors,
Churchill et al demonstrated the presence of longer forms
of Rev in several of the subjects [66]. Rev in three of these
subjects was longer by 3 residues whereas in one donor
D36 by 13 residues. Importantly, the attenuated biological function of Rev in this subject was mapped to the 13
amino acid extension of Rev at the C-terminus. Based on
this result, we are presently evaluating the influence of the
C-terminus extension in D24 Rev on its biological functions.
Longer V1/V2 and/or additional N-linked glycans probably
govern expanded coreceptor use of D17 and D24
The two subtype C molecular clones reported here, D17
and D24, are unique in that they are capable of using a
wide range of coreceptors including CCR5 and CXCR4
(Figure 6A). Phylogenetic characterization and Simplot
analyses of the viral sequences (Figure 3D) ruled out the
possibility of inter-subtype recombination in any of the
viral gene segments. To examine if the expanded coreceptor use observed in this single donor can be largely attributed to HIV-associated dementia in the subtype C
infection, we isolated biological viruses from three addi-

Retrovirology 2008, 5:25

tional donors diagnosed with HIV-1 associated dementia
in the absence of detectable opportunistic infections of
the brain. All the three viruses used only CCR5 and were
incapable of using any other coreceptor (see Additional
file 2A). However, the assay used to determine coreceptor
use in HOS derivatives may not be sensitive enough to
detect minority viruses with different coreceptor requirement. Additionally, the possibility of X4 viruses emerging
at a later stage of the infection cannot be ruled out. Development of dementia [67] and emergence of X4 viruses
[12,13] are both manifested in advanced stages of the viral
infection.
In subtype B infection, the molecular features of the Env
that govern coreceptor specificity have been extensively
analyzed. Although the V3 region of the env primarily
determines coreceptor usage in subtype B [68], changes in
V3 alone are not sufficient to alter the phenotype [44].
Furthermore, changes in other regions of the env, including the V1 and V2 [48-51], V4 [52] or C4 [49] have been
shown to influence the coreceptor requirement in conjunction with V3. In subtype B infection, length polymorphism, especially insertion of additional amino acid
residues in V1, V2 and V4 domains, has been associated
with expanded coreceptor use [68]. In addition to length
polymorphism, the degree of N-linked glycosylation in V3
and V1, V2 and the charge of the V3 loop appear to significantly influence coreceptor requirement of the viral
strains [69,70]. The V3 loop of a vast majority of HIV-1
subtypes contains a single glycan, removal of which is
strongly associated with the loss of CCR5 but gain of
CXCR4 use [69]. Additionally, in the natural infection of
subtypes A, B, D and A/E, a positive correlation was identified between increasing positive charge of the V3 loop
and loss of the V3 glycosylation site both of which are
expected to promote CXCR4 usage [25,69]. Such a correlation was not only absent in subtype C infection but also
the total positive charges of V3 typically did not exceed +5
[47,57] suggesting that subtype C viruses should restrict
coreceptor specificity preferentially to CCR5. It is noteworthy that a genetic analysis of env sequences of a few
sero-positive infants failed to identify a correlation
between the potential N-linked glycosylation sites and
disease progression [26].
Given that both the clones D17 and D24 can make use of
coreceptors other than CXCR4 and CCR5, it is interesting
to examine if this phenomenon could have a pathological
significance in vivo. Can viral clones of subtype C exhibiting expanded coreceptor use make use of other coreceptors on primary cells for infection in the absence of CCR5
and/or CXCR4? Long term virus culture in the presence or
absence of inhibitor molecules or antibodies could possibly throw some light on this question. Such experiments
in subtype B, however, demonstrated that virus strains

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

which can use a broader range of coreceptors, failed to
make use of coreceptors other than CCR5 and CXCR4 in
primary cells [68].
With a total of 31 potential N-linked glycosylation sites,
gp120 of D24 contains a potential for heavy glycosylation
as compared to the three reference subtype C molecular
clones (Figure 6C) or the three biological viruses isolated
from subjects with dementia (see Additional file 2B).
Many subtype C viruses contained as many as 27 glycans
in gp120 while the MJ4 strain as few as 23 sites. The additional glycosylation sites in D24 were distributed among
V1, V2 and V4 domains. Experimental evidence suggests a
positive correlation between the magnitude of glycosylation and the capability of SF162, an R5 subtype B molecular clone, to use CD4 and CCR5 on the target cell [71].
N-linked glycosylation at certain residues is believed to
enhance affinity of the env for the cellular receptors for
HIV-1 [53,72] and HIV-2 [73]. Most, if not all, potential
glycosylation sites in gp120 are utilized for carbohydrate
attachment [74]. However, the relative contribution of
each of these glycans for the viral infection and cell tropism is controversial [75]. Although the exact number of
the potential glycosylation sites actually modified in vivo
needs to be determined in D17 and D24, the heavy glycosylation potential of these clones probably enables the
virus to efficiently infect the target cells especially in the
brain where expression of CD4 and coreceptors is
expected to be limiting [76]. Presence of env variants with
higher affinities for CD4 and CCR5 was demonstrated in
the brain compartment [77]. Although the molecular
clones D17 and D24 were isolated from the peripheral
blood, not from the brain, a dynamic exchange of viruses
between these two compartments cannot be ruled out
[78]. Heavy glycosylation is, thus, not only helpful in
evading the immune surveillance [79] but also in leading
to efficient viral infection [71]. The relative contribution
of additional glycosylation sites identified in D24 env and
the amino acid insertions in V1, V2 and V4 contributing
to expanded coreceptor use of this viral isolate needs further investigation. Presently, we are generating chimeric
D24 variant viruses by transferring individual V1/V2, V4
and C4 domains from the CCR5-using Indie-C1 molecular clone to corresponding regions of D24 env. Chimeric
D24 viruses with single or combinations of Env variations
will be examined for the coreceptor preference to gain
more insights into the mechanisms of coreceptor-requirement in subtype C infection.
Coreceptor switch: a universal phenomenon regardless of
the subtype nature?
The association between coreceptor use and disease progression of HIV-1 is not completely understood. Viral isolates capable of using CXCR4 emerge in nearly half the
infections of subtype B towards the advanced stages of the

Retrovirology 2008, 5:25

disease [12,13]. Why only R5 viruses can initiate a fresh
infection and why in a significant number of subtype B
infections, the viruses switch coreceptor use from CCR5 to
CXCR4 in the advanced stages of the disease remains enigmatic [80]. In contrast to this situation of subtype B infection, a near absence or low incidence of coreceptor switch
in the subtype C infection, even in the advanced stages of
the disease, adds an additional layer of complication
[9,19,20,22,24,25]. If the emergence of the X4 virus is
essential for disease progression, as is seen in subtype B
infection and in the case of other viral subtypes, the
absence of coreceptor switch in the subtype C infection
could be suggestive of the relatively less pathogenic nature
of subtype C. In contrast to this assumption, subtype C
isolates are responsible for the largest number of infections in the world [2]. Furthermore, studies on the natural
history of the subtype C infection, especially from the
African subcontinent [25,81,82] and India [83,84], fail to
demonstrate significant difference in disease progression
between subtype C and other subtypes although the data
are incomplete or controversial [85], suggesting that subtype C isolates are probably as virulent as other viral subtypes. Thus, although a school of thought proposes that
the less virulent and highly infectious nature of subtype C
underlies its rapid global expansion [7], the experimental
evidence in support of this hypothesis is scanty and even
contradictory. Additionally, the viral load in subtype C
infection does not appear to be different as compared to
that of other subtypes [86,87]. Nevertheless, the preference for CCR5 by subtype C strains cannot be contested.
A small number of studies, however, reported detection of
dual-tropic and X4 viruses in a small but considerable
number of subtype C infections by focusing on the
advanced stages of the disease [8,21-26,54,88]. Biological
viruses isolated from such subjects were capable of utilizing CCR5 and/or CXCR4. It is tempting to speculate that
emergence of X4 viruses is a general phenomenon in a
majority of the viral infections regardless of the subtype
nature, however, the relative proportion between R5 and
X4 viruses could be variable and unique for a given viral
subtype. Detection of the presence of X4 viruses in a sample is probably limited by the sensitivity of the detection
technique employed, especially when the X4 viruses are in
a minority for detection, but not for disease progression.
Most of the reporter cell lines routinely used for coreceptor phenotyping of the viral isolates are of non-T cell lineage engineered to express CD4 and one of the several
coreceptor molecules. Cells of non-T cell lineage probably
lack a potential to adequately support the growth of the
minority viral variants present in the biological sample
with different coreceptor requirement.

Conclusion
In summary, we have constructed two infectious molecular subtype C clones, D17 and D24, from one Indian sub-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

ject with HAD. The cloning strategy described here could
have a broader application to other HIV-1 subtypes
including N and O groups, HIV-2 and SIV. Both the clones
possess several unique molecular properties including
NF-κB site variation in the LTR and non-truncated Rev.
We also detected the coexpression of two length isoforms
of Rev in the donor proviral compartment and plasma
viral pool. The viruses generated by the molecular clones
D17 and D24 demonstrated expanded coreceptor use that
is possibly correlated to sequence insertions in V1/V2/V4
and generation of additional N-linked glycosylation sites.
The present study documented that molecular features of
env that underlie expanded coreceptor use in subtype C
infection are identical to what has been reported with the
subtype B infection. Most studies of HIV-1 coreceptor
requirement have relied on subtype B. The molecular
clones reported here could be important tools in elucidating the genetic determinants that underlie HIV-1 subtype
C neuropathogenesis, as well as unraveling the mechanisms of coreceptor preference in subtype C infection.

Methods
Clinical samples and virus cultures
Peripheral blood samples were collected from HIV-1 seropositive donors after obtaining informed consent and
with the approval of the Institutional Bioethics Committees of Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific
Research (JNCASR) and the National Institute of Mental
Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). The donor
(BL94/03), from whom the molecular clones were isolated, was a 39 year old male admitted in 2003 to the
NIMHANS, Bangalore, India with clinical symptoms of
potential HIV infection. The donor was a chronic alcoholic with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. At the
time of blood collection in 2003, he was drug-naïve for
anti-retroviral therapy. The magnetic resonance imaging
of the brain identified only frontal atrophy and no evidence of basal exudate or cortical enhancement thus
excluding the possibility of meningeal inflammatory
pathology. The serum and CSF samples were confirmed
negative for mycobacteria (antibody, antigen and
immune complexes), cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cysticercosis and several other endemic bacterial
and viral infections. Both the serum and CSF samples,
however, were seropositive for HIV-1. Using subtype-specific PCR [63], the virus was determined to be a subtype C.

Mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood by
density gradient centrifugation using Ficol-Hypaque
(1.077 g/ml, H8889, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
Cells were mixed with equal number of PBMC isolated in
a similar fashion from seronegative healthy donors 3 days
earlier, CD8 cell depleted and mitogen-activated (5 µg of
phytohemaglutinin/ml). Cell pool (2 × 106/ml) was propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented

with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries ltd. Kibbutz beit haemek, Israel), interleukin-2 (IL-2, 10 U/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml),
streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM).
Fresh mitogen-activated donor PBMC were added to the
cell pool when necessary. Production of HIV p24 was
monitored from the culture supernatant twice a week
using a commercial kit (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA).
Amplification and cloning of the viral molecular clones
Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using the GenElute™ Blood Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma). Using two different sets of primer pairs (Table 2) and the nested-PCR
approach, the provirus was amplified in two unequal fragments, a 3.0 kb fragment extending from the 5' LTR
through the RT region and a 6.5 kb fragment spanning the
rest of the provirus until the end of the 3'-LTR. Primers
without nucleotide overhangs were used in the first-round
and those with restriction sites in the second-round of
amplification (Figure 1). The following amplification
conditions were applied for both the fragments for both
rounds of amplification: 94°C for 1 min, 65°C for 1 min,
68°C for 4 min for the first two of the total 30 cycles of the
amplification. For the subsequent cycles, only two amplification steps were used 94°C for 30 sec for melting and
68°C for annealing. Starting from the third cycle an increment of 30 seconds was added to the extension step after
every 5 cycles. The final 13 cycles were extended for 6 min
each. We used Expand Long template polymerase mix
with a proof-reading activity for the amplification (Roche,
Alameda, CA). The amplification reaction of 50 µl contained 1 µg of genomic DNA, 250 µM of each of the four
dNTPs, 30 pM of each of the primers, 2.75 mM of Mg2+
and 1.25 U of enzyme mix. From the first-round amplification, 5 µl of the reaction mixture were transferred to the
second-round amplification to serve as template. The 3.0
and 6.5 kb fragments were column-purified and digested
with NotI plus MluI and MluI plus SbfI, respectively. We
engineered NotI and MluI restriction sites into the multi-

cloning site of a commercial vector pNEB193 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) upstream of the existing SbfI
site. The 3.0 and 6.5 kb fragments digested with appropriate restriction enzymes were incubated with the vector
restriction digested at NotI and SbfI sites, in a single ligation reaction, followed by transformation using Stbl2
high-efficiency chemically competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Cells and cell lines
Human epithelial kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were
propagated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine
and antibiotics. HOSCD4 parental cells and derivative
cells expressing a wide range of chemokine receptors
including CCR1, CCR2B, CCR3, CXCR4 or CCR5, were
obtained from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent
Program (Rockville, MD). HOSCD4 parental cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
the derivative cell lines in medium containing 1 µg/ml of
puromycin. Expression of CD4 and different coreceptors
was confirmed by flow cytometry. MAGI cell lines expressing CCR5 and CXCR4 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference
Reagent Program), were cultured in a similar fashion. For
viral growth kinetics, we used CN-2 cells, Herpesvirus
saimiri-immortalized human primary T-cells, and cultured
them as described [43]. An astrocytoma neuronal cell line,
GO-G-CCM, was obtained from National Center for Cell
Sciences (NCCS, Pune, India) and cultured in medium
containing DMEM and Hams F10 at a ratio of 1:1 and
supplemented with 10% FBS. PBMC and primary monocytes were from anonymous HIV-1 negative donors.
Monocytes were isolated by two rounds of density gradient centrifugation essentially as described previously [89].
CD8+ve cells were depleted from the PBMC using a commercial kit (Cat. No. 15663, Rosette Sep, Stemcell Technologies, USA) and the cells enriched for CD4+ve marker
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
5 µg phytohemaglutinin/ml for 72 h prior to infection.
Monocytes were maintained in the same medium with 10

U/ml of IL-2 for 48 h prior to infection. Both PBMC and
monocytes were seeded at 2 × 106/well in 24-well plates
and were propagated in 1.0 ml of medium.
Production of viral stocks from the molecular clones
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with recombinant viral clones using standard calcium phosphate protocol [90]. Cells seeded at low confluency in 6-well plates
were transfected with a total of 3.0 µg of plasmid DNA,
consisting of 2.7 µg of the viral plasmid vector and 0.3 µg
of a CMV-β-galactosidase expression vector. The latter was
included in all the transfections to serve as an internal
control for transfection efficiency. Culture supernatants
were harvested at 72 h, passed through 0.22 µ filter and
stored in multiple aliquots in a deep freezer. The p24 concentration in each of the viral stocks was evaluated using
a commercial ELISA kit. The TCID50 titers of the viral
stocks were determined by using two subsets of MAGI cell
lines expressing CCR5 and CXCR4 and serial fold dilutions of the viral stocks essentially as described [91].
Briefly, MAGI indicator cells were seeded at 0.5 × 105 cells
per well in 12-well plates in complete DMEM supplemented with appropriate selection drug (G418, hygromycin and/or puromycin at final concentrations of 0.2 mg/
ml, 0.1 mg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively). After 24 h, the
cells were infected with the virus by replacing the culture
medium from each well with 300 µl of appropriately
diluted viral stocks (a serial 4-fold dilution) in complete
DMEM supplemented with 10 µg per ml of polybrene but
lacking selection drugs. Following 2 h of incubation of the
cells at 37°C, 1.5 ml of complete DMEM were added to
each well, and the cells were incubated for 2 days at 37°C
in the presence of 5% CO2. To examine β-galactosidase
expression, on day 3, the culture medium in each well was
replaced with 1.0 ml of the fixing solution (1.0% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS) and the plates
were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The cells
were washed two times with PBS, 500 µl of freshly prepared β-galactosidase staining solution (4 mM potassium
ferrocyanide, 4 mM M potassium ferricyanide, 2 mM
MgCl2, and 1 mM X-gal in PBS) was added to each well
and the plates were incubated for 2–3 h at 37°C. Plates
were washed twice in PBS and blue-stained cells were
counted manually under low-resolution microscope.
TCID50 value of each viral stock was calculated by multiplying the cell-count with the dilution factor.
Reporter gene analysis and viral infection assay
In experiments to determine expression of Tat from the
molecular clones, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with 9
µg of the viral plasmid and 1 µg of a bicistronic reporter
vector using the calcium phosphate transfection protocol
[90]. In the reporter vector, two different genes, secreted
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) were placed under the control of a sub-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/25

type C LTR [64]. Expression of the reporter genes was
monitored at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection. A reference subtype C molecular clone Indie-C1 served as the
positive control and the vector backbone as the negative
control. Cell-free culture supernatant was harvested 72 h
post-transfection and monitored for viral p24 production.
SEAP assay was performed essentially as described previously [89]. GFPexpression was visualized 24–72 h after
transfection under UV and images were captured at 20×
magnification using a digital camera (DFC320, Leica,
Heerbrugg, Germany) and processed with Image Manager
software (IM50, Leica).
Western-blot analysis of the viral antigens
Virus particles were pelleted from 10 ml of fresh or frozen
culture supernatants by high-speed centrifugation at
70,450 g for 2.5 h at 4°C. The viral pellet was resuspended
in lysis buffer (0.15 M NaCl; 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; 1%
Triton X-100; 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate). The total amount of protein obtained
was quantified at 280 nm using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Wilmington, DE, USA). Ten µg of
total protein for each sample was mixed with reducing
buffer (0.08 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 0.1 M dithiothreitol; 2%
sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% glycerol and 0.2%
bromophenol blue), boiled for 3 min and resolved on an
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels
with a linear gradient of 6 to 15% polyacrylamide.
Resolved proteins were transferred onto PVDF transfer
membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences, UK),
using semidry transfer apparatus (Hoefer TE77, Amersham Biosciences), at 50 V for 1 h. Viral proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with pooled sera from HIV-1seropositive individuals infected with subtype C from
Southern India.
Determination of coreceptor usage
HOS cell lines with or without the CD4 receptor and a
broad range of chemokine receptors including CCR1,
CCR2B, CCR3, CXCR4 and CCR5 were used. Viral stocks,
500 TCID50 units each, were added to cells in 24-well
plates in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
After 16 h of incubation, residual virus was washed off
and the cells were incubated in complete medium. Culture supernatants were sampled periodically up to day 22
and viral infection of the target cells was monitored using
a p24 capture ELISA. The cells were split once a week. To
determine the specificity of coreceptor usage, we incubated the target cells with specific inhibitors, TAK-779
[92] and bicyclam JM-2987 [93] (The NIH AIDS Research
and Reference Reagent Program) for CCR5 and CXCR4,
respectively. The cells, 1 h prior to the addition of the
virus, were treated with respective inhibitor at different
concentrations, TAK-779 at 0.1 through 100 µM and JM2987 at 6 through 90 nM. The inhibitors were present in

the culture medium at the indicated concentration
through the infection process. In a similar fashion, recombinant soluble CD4 consisting of the D1 and D2
domains, at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml, to confirm
CD4 use by the viruses. Additionally, we also used two
different anti-human CD4 monoclonal antibodies, F2
and F4 (generated in our laboratory), at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml to block CD4-mediated infection of the
viruses.
Sequencing and sequence analyses
We designed more than 40 individual sequence primers
spanning the entire length of the viral genome on both the
strands. The primers target sequences highly conserved
among diverse viral subtypes and placed approximately
500 nucleotides apart (see Additional file 3). Overlapping
contiguous sequences, for both D17 and D24, were
obtained throughout the genome using the dye-terminator
chemistry. Sequencing reactions were performed on the
plasmid DNA. Chromatograms from ABI377 and Beckman
CEQ8000 sequencers were edited using Sequencher (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Mich.). Sequence contigs were assembled using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison,
WI, USA) to generate complete nucleotide sequences of the
molecular clones. Partial DNA sequences of various viral
gene segments of the other replication-defective molecular
clones were obtained in a similar fashion.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the molecular clone
D24 is available from GenBank under the accession
number EF469243. The gp120 sequences of the four primary viral isolates used in coreceptor evaluation studies
(Additional file 2B) are available from GenBank under the
accession numbers EU492868–EU492871.
Sequences of the newly derived viral clones were aligned
with full-length reference sequences of several Group M
viruses obtained from the Los Alamos sequence database.
Nucleotide sequences were gap-stripped and aligned using
CLUSTAL X [94] and Neighbor-joining trees were generated with the Kimura 2 parameter substitution model by
using MEGA3.2 software [95]. Pairwise evolutionary distances were estimated by using DNADIST from the PHYLIP
3.6 package [96], and the reliability of the topologies was
evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates by
using SEQBOOT, DNADIST, NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE.
To determine the recombinant nature of the isolated
molecular clones, we performed bootscanning using the
algorithm of maximum parsimony with a sliding window
of 400 nucleotides overlapping by 20 nucleotides. SimPlot
was used to plot similarity versus position. The following
reference sequences of diverse viral subtypes were used in
the analysis. Subtype A (A1.KE.94.Q23_17/AF004885,
