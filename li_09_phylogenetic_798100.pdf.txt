Abstract
Background: The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of doublebonds in α, β-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones and are part of the octadecanoid pathway that converts linolenic acid
to jasmonic acid. In plants, OPRs belong to the old yellow enzyme family and form multigene families. Although
discoveries about this family in Arabidopsis and other species have been reported in some studies, the evolution and
function of multiple OPRs in plants are not clearly understood.
Results: A comparative genomic analysis was performed to investigate the phylogenetic relationship, structural
evolution and functional divergence among OPR paralogues in plants. In total, 74 OPR genes were identified from 11
species representing the 6 major green plant lineages: green algae, mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms, monocots and
dicots. Phylogenetic analysis showed that seven well-conserved subfamilies exist in plants. All OPR genes from green
algae were clustered into a single subfamily, while those from land plants fell into six other subfamilies, suggesting that
the events leading to the expansion of the OPR family occurred in land plants. Further analysis revealed that lineagespecific expansion, especially by tandem duplication, contributed to the current OPR subfamilies in land plants after
divergence from aquatic plants. Interestingly, exon/intron structure analysis showed that the gene structures of OPR
paralogues exhibits diversity in intron number and length, while the intron positions and phase were highly conserved
across different lineage species. These observations together with the phylogenetic tree revealed that successive single
intron loss, as well as indels within introns, occurred during the process of structural evolution of OPR paralogues.
Functional divergence analysis revealed that altered functional constraints have occurred at specific amino acid positions
after diversification of the paralogues. Most notably, significant functional divergence was also found in all pairs, except
for the II/IV, II/V and V/VI pairs. Strikingly, analysis of the site-specific profiles established by posterior probability revealed
that the positive-selection sites and/or critical amino acid residues for functional divergence are mainly distributed in αhelices and substrate binding loop (SBL), indicating the functional importance of these regions for this protein family.
Conclusion: This study highlights the molecular evolution of the OPR gene family in all plant lineages and indicates
critical amino acid residues likely relevant for the distinct functional properties of the paralogues. Further experimental
verification of these findings may provide valuable information on the OPRs' biochemical and physiological functions.

Background
Plant responses to many biotic and abiotic stresses are
orchestrated locally and systemically by signaling molecules known as jasmonates (JAs), which are derived from
linolenic acid via the octadecanoid pathway [1,2]. Jasmonic acid (JA) and other octadecanoids act as plant
growth regulators in various developmental processes
such as fruit ripening, pollen maturation, root growth and
tendril coiling [3-5]. They are also potent modulators of
defenses against insects and pathogens [2,5-7]. Thus, the
lipid-based octadecanoid pathway leading to JA has also
been found to be an integral part of the signal transduction pathway. The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases
(OPRs) are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of doublebonds adjacent to an oxo group in α, β-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones and are part of the octadecanoid pathway that converts linolenic acid to jasmonic acid [8,9].
In plants, the OPR genes, which belong to the old yellow
enzyme (OYE) family, are flavin mononucleotide (FMN)dependent oxidoreductases and form multigene families.
The first member of the OPR family in higher plants was
identified from Arabidopsis thaliana, and named AtOPR1
[10]. Subsequently, other OPR genes were identified in
the tomato [11,12], pea [13], rice [14-16] and maize [17]
genomes. Earlier studies on the enzymatic activity of
OPRs in Arabidopsis and tomato revealed that these
enzymes have distinct substrate preferences and therefore
have been classified into two groups, group I and II,
depending on their substrate specificity [10,12,18,19].
OPR group I enzymes preferentially catalyze the reduction
of (9R,13R)-12-oxo-10, 15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid
(9R,13R-OPDA), while OPR group II enzymes preferentially catalyze (9S,13S)-12-oxo-10, 15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (9S,13S-OPDA), a natural biosynthetic
intermediate precursor in JA biosynthesis. AtOPR3 and
LeOPR3, belonging to group II, have been shown to efficiently reduce the natural isomer 9S,13S-OPDA to 3-oxo2(2'(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC
8:0), the precursor of JA [12,18,19]. In contrast, AtOPR1/
2 and LeOPR1/2, belonging to group I, were unable to catalyze this step [10,18,20].
The biological significance of plants having multiple
OPRs is not clearly understood. To date, studies of the
physiological role of OPRs have focused mainly on their
expression in dicots and monocots. Among dicots, OPRs
have been characterized in Arabidopsis and tomato. The
expression levels of OPR mRNA and protein have also
been analyzed in transgenic plants. OPRs in Arabidopsis
have been shown to have tissue-specific expression patterns. AtOPR3 is transcribed more actively in flowers or
anthers than in the roots and leaves [21]. Conversely,
AtOPR1/2 is transcribed more actively in roots and leaves
[20]. Furthermore, the transcription of OPRs can also be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

induced by wounds, pathogens, signaling molecules such
as JA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, and other environmental
stimuli [10,20-22]. For example, AtOPR1/2 transcription
is up-regulated transiently in response to wounding [20];
likewise, the expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) under
the control of the AtOPR1 and AtOPR2 promoters was upregulated after stimulation by touch, wounding, and
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [20]. In addition, mutants for
AtOPR3, which encodes the enzymes belonging to group
II, were shown to be deficient in the biosynthesis of JA and
the males were sterile [21,22]. Moreover, the AtOPR3
mutants accumulated 12-oxo-10, 15(Z)-octadecatrienoic
acid (OPDA) following wounding and were resistant to
fungal and insect attacks [21].
In monocots, more than 13 OPR genes have been found
in the rice genome; OsOPR1 was the first OPR gene characterized at the biochemical and molecular level [14].
This gene is rapidly and transiently up-regulated in
response to a variety of environmental cues including JA,
SA, ethylene and H2O2 [14]. Similar results were found for
the expression of OsOPR7 [23]. Moreover, over-expression OsOPR7, clustered in the same group II, was able to
compensate for the phenotype of AtOPR3 mutants,
whereas OsOPR1, which is clustered in other groups, was
unable to compensate for the same phenotype [23]. In
addition, an analysis of mRNA transcripts indicated that
maize OPR genes exhibit organ-specific expression and
can be rapidly and transiently up-regulated in response to
a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses that include wounding, signaling molecules (JA, MeJA, SA, ABA and ethylene)
and the presence of pathogens [17]. In spite of ongoing
studies, the function of OPRs in plants remains obscure.
Although biochemical and genetic studies in Arabidopsis
and other species have led to important discoveries in
understanding the function of OPRs, proven biological
roles have been elucidated for only a few members of this
family and in a limited number of species. Additionally,
differences in family size among eukaryotes raise several
questions regarding the evolution and functional divergence of the OPR gene family. Thus, a comprehensive
comparative genome study is essential for understanding
the evolution and function of the OPR gene family in
plants. Here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis using a comprehensive bioinformatics/phylogenetic
approach to elucidate the evolutionary history, structural
evolution and putative functional divergence of the OPR
gene family in plants. Firstly, we identified all OPR paralogues from eleven species (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
Volvox carteri, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Picea sitchensis, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays,
Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Medicago truncatula), representing the six major plant lineages with

available genome sequences. Secondly, phylogenetic
analysis was performed to trace back the evolutionary history of the OPR family in plants. Thirdly, exon/intron
structure analysis was performed to gain insight into the
possible mechanisms for structural evolution of the OPR
gene family, because the exon/intron structural divergence within gene families is also a mechanism for the
evolution of multiple gene families. Finally, functional
divergence analysis suggests that changes in selective constraints and/or amino acid properties occurred after gene
duplication, which led to subfamily-specific functional
evolution after their diversification. This has also led us to
predict the positive-selection sites or critical amino acid
sites that may be of importance for the functional divergence of the OPR paralogues.

Results
Identification of OPR genes and their homologues in
plants
Using the TIGR, TAIR, MaizeGDB, PlantGDB, JGI and
NCBI databases, we first retrieved the available OPR or
OPR-like sequences from currently sequenced and unfinished genomes; 105 OPR homologue genes were identified (Additional files 1, 2) from various green plants,
including unicellular and multicellular green algae,
mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. To
explore the origin and evolutionary history of the OPR
gene family, we characterized OPR genes from eleven species representing the six major plant lineages: the green
algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, the
moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the gymnosperm Picea sitchensis, the monocotyledonous angiosperms Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor and
Zea mays and the dicotyledonous angiosperms Arabidopsis
thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Medicago truncatula. A
complete or draft genome sequence was used in all of our
searches, except for the gymnosperm Picea sitchensis,
whose genome sequence is not yet available. After exclu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

sion of unfinished and partial protein sequences, we
finally obtained 74 OPR genes from the above eleven representative plants (Table 1; Additional file 1). The results
of Pfam and SMART analysis showed that the typical OPR
proteins possess only one Oxidored_FMN (PF00724)
domain. Three OPR candidates (AtOPR01-2/3 and
SbOPR06-4) without complete Oxidored_FMN domains
were excluded from the following analysis.
Phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the OPR gene
family in all plant lineages
To explore the phylogenetic relationship among OPR paralogues in plants, a rooted maximum-likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic tree with 71 OPR genes from 11 species (Figure 1A) was inferred from the amino acid sequences of
their Oxidored_FMN domains (Additional file 3, 4), using
the PhyML v3.0 program [24] under the best-fit model
WAG+I+G. Here, the best-fit model (WAG+I+G) for
amino acid substitution was selected by ProtTest v1.4 [25]
with discrete gamma distribution in four categories. All
parameters (gamma shape = 1.303; proportion of invariants = 0.042) were estimated from the dataset. To compensate for the disadvantages of PhyML in tree-space
searches, the ML tree was reconstructed using the Phylip
v3.68 package [26] under the gamma-corrected Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model [27]. The ML trees constructed
by PhyML v3.0 and Phylip v3.68 gave congruent topologies (Figure 1A; Additional file 5). Additionally, tree
topology assessed by neighbor joining (NJ), minimum
evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods
(using MEGA v3.1), was substantially similar to the ML
tree (data not shown). Using ScOYE1 from yeast as the
outgroup, the OPR gene family can be subdivided into
seven well-conserved subfamilies (Figure 1A) with high
statistical support, according to the topology and the deep
duplication nodes of OPR paralogues in the ML tree (Figure 1A); we numbered these subfamilies sub. I to sub. VII.
All OPR genes from the green algae were grouped into the

same subfamily (sub. VII), while those from the land
plants were grouped into several other subfamilies (sub.
I–VI), showing that the OPR family originated before the
divergence of the green algae and the ancestor of land
plants. Of the other six subfamilies, only sub. II was
present in all land plants except for the gymnosperm Picea
sitchensis, revealing that all OPR genes from land plants
shared a common ancestor after the divergence from
aquatic plants. Sub. VI was only present in lower land
plants, i.e. mosses and lycophytes, while sub. I, III, IV and
V were only present in higher land plants, i.e. gymno-

sperms and angiosperms. Moreover, sub. III, IV and V
were found exclusively in monocots (Figure 1A). These
observations indicated that all OPR genes from land
plants shared a common ancestor before the divergence
between lower and higher land plants; subsequently, lineage-specific expansion and divergence events occurred in
higher land plants, especially in monocots, after divergence from lower land plants. In addition, OPR genes
from the same lineage, such as mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, tended to be clustered
together (Figure 1A).

Additionally, the chromosomal location of the OPR genes
in the genomes of the monocots (Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor) and dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago
truncatula) showed that OPR genes are distributed in clusters (Figure 2A). Moreover, searching for such paralogues
within the OPR family of genes using the Plant Genome
Duplication
Database
(PGDD;
http://
chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/) revealed that only
one paralogous gene pair (SbOPR04-1/SbOPR06-3) exists
in Sorghum bicolor (Figure 2B), but not in other species.
Further analysis using the PGDD revealed cross-genome
syntenic relationships in four gene pairs: OsOPR02-1/
SbOPR04-1,
OsOPR06-1/SbOPR10-1,
OsOPR08-1/
SbOPR07-1 and PtOPR5/AtOPR02-1 (Figure 2B). These
findings suggest that the ancestral OPR of each subfamily
in monocots and dicots underwent tandem duplication,
which caused differences in the number of OPR genes
within each subfamily and species, while segmental duplication occurred only in the expansion of the OPR family
in Sorghum bicolor.
Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct differences between aquatic and land plants, not only in the
number of OPR genes, but also in the number of subfamilies (Figure 1A). Therefore, based on the results
obtained from phylogenetic analysis, we proposed a schematic pattern to account for the expansion and evolution
of the OPR gene family in plants (Figure 2C). In this pattern, the OPR genes were plant-specific and originated
before the divergence of green algae from land plants. The
ancestral OPR gene evolved into the present sub. VII and
the common ancestral OPR of land plants evolved after
the divergence of aquatic plants (green algae) from land
plants. Subsequently, the common ancestral OPR of land
plants underwent one duplication and yielded two copies:
one copy evolved into the present sub. II, while the other
copy evolved into the present sub. VI in lower land plants
(mosses and lycophytes) and sub. I in higher land plants
(gymnosperms and angiosperms) (Figure 2C). The events
leading to lineage-specific expansion, especially by tandem duplication, occurred in monocots after their divergence from dicots, and sub. III, IV and V were generated
exclusively in monocots (Figure 2C).
Structural evolution of the OPR family genes
To examine the possible mechanisms of structural evolution of OPR paralogues, we compared the exon/intron
structures of individual OPR genes in all plant lineages,
except for gymnosperms (for which complete or nearly
complete genome sequences are unavailable). The exon/
intron structures were obtained using the online Gene
Structure
Display
Server
(GSDS:
http://
gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn) with either GenBank accession numbers, or both coding sequences (CDS) and genomic
sequences [28]. Figure 1B provides a detailed illustration

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

of the relative length of introns and conservation of the
corresponding exon sequences within each of the OPR
paralogues in plants. Notably, although the members of
the OPR gene family exhibited differences in intron
number and intron length, the intron positions and
intron phases were remarkably well-conserved, with conserved splicing sites between adjacent exons (Figures 1B,
3; Additional file 3). As for the number of introns, the
OPR genes in sub. VII contained 6–10 introns while those
in sub. III all contained only one intron. Most of the OPR
genes in the other five subfamilies, sub. I, II, IV, V and VI,
contained 3–4 introns (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the OPR
genes in the oldest subfamily, sub. VII, contained the
greatest number of introns while those in the youngest
subfamily, sub. III, contained the fewest introns (Figure
1B). These findings, together with the phylogenetic trees,
indicate that a significant number of intron loss events
occurred during the structural evolution of the OPR gene
family from green algae to angiosperms.
In addition, a total of 12 different introns have been
found within all the genes of the OPR family across different lineage species, according to intron position (Figure
3). Further analysis the introns of OPR paralogues in sub.
VII indicated that I5 and I7 exist only in VcOPR1 and
CrOPR2/3, but not in CrOPR1 and VcOPR2 (Figures 1B,
3). However, CrOPR1 and VcOPR2 arose earlier than
VcOPR1 and CrOPR2/3, according to the topology of the
ML tree (Figure 1A). These observations suggest that I5 and
I7 were most likely gained by the ancestor of VcOPR1 and
CrOPR2/3 before the divergence between Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and Volvox carteri. The above-mentioned events
of intron loss and I5 and I7 gain in OPR paralogues are
consistent with previous findings by Lin et al. (2006) [29]
and Roy and Penny (2007) [30,31].
The aforementioned exon/intron structure comparison
and the phylogenetic analysis provide strong evidence
that single intron loss events occurred during the structural evolution of OPR paralogues from green algae to
angiosperms. To further investigate the structural evolution of OPR paralogues in different lineage species, we
constructed an evolution model that could yield the current OPR genes in plant species of different lineages (Figure 4). Under the assumption that introns, which were
located exactly at the same position and have been given
the same phase, should be present in the common ancestor, we reconstructed the ancestral exon/intron structure
of OPR for all plant lineages (Figure 4B). The results
obtained from the analysis of introns of OPR paralogues
in sub. VII suggested that the events of intron gain may
have occurred in algae and that I5 and I7 were most likely
gained in VcOPR1 and CrOPR2/3; therefore, the ancestral
exon/intron structure of OPR in algae should contain 10,
not 12 introns, and I5 & I7 were not included (Figure 4B).

subfamilies III, IV and V, however, only exist in monocots. The "black upright diamond" symbol in the upper diagram and the

Distribution and position of conserved introns within the Oxidored_FMN domain. (A) Schematic comparison of
conserved intron distribution of OPR genes. The positions of introns in the coding sequence of the OPR genes are indicated as
colored vertical lines and labeled I1 to I12. Introns 3, 8, 10, 11 and 12 (in red) and introns 5 and 7 (in blue) only exist in aquatic
plants (green algae). Moreover, introns 5 and 7 most probably arose in aquatic plants. Introns 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9, labeled in black,
are present in both aquatic and land plants. (B) Conserved intron positions in OPR proteins with a topology identical to that in
(A). The boundary residues between two exons are denoted by a black translucent box.

In this model, the ancestor OPR contained 10 or more
introns, symmetrically distributed throughout the coding
sequence of OPR, and multiple unique introns were lost
during the evolutionary process from green algae to
angiosperms (Figure 4B). For example, I3, I8, I10, I11 and
I12 were lost in the evolution from aquatic plants (green
algae) to lower land plants (mosses and lycophytes),
while I9 was lost in the evolution from lower land plants
to higher land plants (angiosperms). Moreover, single
intron losses also occurred during the expansion and
divergence of the OPR gene family in each plant lineage.
For example, the ancestral OPR in algae contained at least
10 introns, whereas all five OPR genes contained only 6–
10 introns (Figure 4C). This suggests that a single intron
loss occurred during the evolution of OPR genes in algae.
Similar cases were also found in other lineages, i.e.,
mosses, lycophytes and angiosperms (dicots and mono-

cots) (Figure 4C). Interestingly, I1, I2, I4 and I6 were
present in the OPR gene of the common ancestor of all
plant lineages (Figure 4B), but some or all of them were
lost during the evolution from the ancestral OPR gene to
the present individual OPR genes in each plant lineage
(Figure 4C). This suggests that these four conserved
introns (I1, I2, I4 and I6) were retained during the evolution of different plant lineages from algae to angiosperms,
but other introns were lost during the structural evolution
of OPR paralogues in each plant lineage. In addition to
single intron losses, intron gain may have occurred during
the structural evolution of OPR paralogues; it appears to
have occurred only in green algae (Figures 4B, 4C).
Additionally, the exon-intron structure of OPR genes
showed that the length of introns within each individual
OPR gene was distinct, with lengths varying from 47 to

aquatic plants (green algae); I5 and I7, labeled in blue, most probably arose in aquatic plants (green algae). (C) Current exonintron structure of OPR genes in all plant lineages. The exon-intron structure of OPR genes in the gymnosperm Picea sitchensis

2919 bp (data not shown). Further analysis of the introns
of OPRs in Arabidopsis and rice indicated that the average
intron length of Arabidopsis OPR genes was 165 bp, close
to that of the entire Arabidopsis genome (168 bp) calculated from Arabidopsis genome TAIR 6.0 release. The average intron length of rice OPR genes was 559 bp, longer
than that of the entire rice genome (393 bp) calculated
from the TIGR rice genome release 5.0. Moreover, most of
these introns are putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) or retrotransposons, which can
be found in the TIGR Oryza Repeat Database. For example, short fragment insertions in the first intron (213 bp)
of OsOPR01-1 and the second intron (600 bp) of
OsOPR06-1 show high homology (> 90%) with the
MITEs, while a long fragment insertion in the intron (~5.0
kb) of OsOPR06-4 shows high homology (> 90%) with
the retrotransposons (Figure 2B). Similar cases were also

found in maize and Sorghum OPR genes. These results suggest that the presence of indels within introns, caused by
MITEs or retrotransposons, may have arisen during the
structural evolution of the OPR gene family.
Variable selective pressures among amino acid sites under
diversifying selection
To analyze positive or negative selection of specific amino
acid regions within the full-length protein sequences of
OPRs, substitution rate ratios of nonsynonymous (dN or
Ka) versus synonymous (dS or Ks) mutations (dN/dS or

ω) were calculated. The Ka/Ks ratio should be 1 for genes
subject to neutral selection, < 1 for genes subject to negative selection and > 1 for genes subject to positive selection; however, there are constraints in using Ka/Ks to
assess protein evolution for this gene family. Because

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:90

members of the gene family show few changes in protein
sequences, especially for duplicated genes, they may have
more similar Ka and Ks values than their parental genes,
bringing the Ka/Ks ratio closer to 1 or to less than 1
[32,33]. Amino acids in a protein sequence are expected
to be under different selective pressure and to have different underlying dN/dS ratios. In order to test for positive
selection at individual amino acid codons, the site-specific models implemented using the codeml program of
the PAML v4.0 package [34] were tested. Table 2 lists
parameter estimates and log-likelihood values under
models of variable ω ratios among sites. Model M0 (one
ratio) assumes the same ratio for all sites and fits the data
much worse than any of the other models, accounting for
variable ω ratios across sites. For example, the M3 (discrete) model involves four more parameters than M0 (one
ratio), and the likelihood rate test (LRT) statistic 2Δᐍ =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

2
2439.82 is much greater than the critical value χ 1% =

13.28 with df = 4 (Additional file 6). The results suggest
that M0 was rejected when compared to M3 (P < 0.01)
and the existence of extreme variation in selective pressure
among amino acid sites. Moreover, the ratio value (ω) in
M0 was 1.047, closer to 1 (Table 2), suggesting that the
OPR family genes within each subfamily were under
strong negative selection pressure and positive selection
may have acted in very short regions or on only a few sites
during the evolutionary process from algae to
angiosperms.
All three models that allow for the presence of positiveselection sites, i.e., M2a (positive selection), M3 (discrete)
and M8 (beta &ω), do suggest the presence of such sites
(Table 2). Allowing for the presence of positive-selection

sites (with ω > 1) significantly improves the fit of the models. The comparison of models M1a and M2a should be
stated as a test of the null hypothesis that all genes evolved
under neutral conditions, versus the alternate hypothesis
that some sites are under negative selection (ω < 1), some
sites under neutral constraints (ω = 1) and some sites
under positive selection (ω > 1). The neutral model (M1a)
does not allow for sites with ω > 1, while the positive
selection model (M2a) adds an additional site class, with
the ω ratio estimated to be 3.183. The log-likelihood
improvement was huge, as 2Δᐍ = 807.50 should be com2
pared with χ 1% = 9.21 with df = 2 (Additional file 6).

Comparison between M7 (beta) and M8 (beta and ω) produced similar results (Additional file 6). This could be
explained by the fact that the majority of the protein was
subjected to constant negative selection while a few sites
underwent positive selection [35].
Additionally, posterior probabilities for site classes were
calculated under three models that allow for selection to
be tested (M2a, M3 and M8), and the results (data not
shown) were similar. For example, the probabilities that
site 324 belongs to the class of positive-selection sites
(with the ω ratio being 3.183 under M2, 3.290 under M3
and 2.853 under M8; Table 2) were 1.000, 0.971, and
0.999 under the three models, respectively. Table 2 lists
sites inferred to be under positive selection under different
models at the 95% confidence level. Under models M2a,
M3 and M8, 60, 69, and 58 sites were detected, respectively, and the majority of positive-selection sites were
conserved with all three models. The detailed distribution
of positive-selection sites predicted by model M3 is
showed in Figure 5. The 69 sites were scattered over the 8
SSSUs (Super Secondary Structure Units) of the
Oxidored_FMN domain, except for four sites (16, 20, 22
and 24) at the N-terminus (Figure 5A). Further analysis
indicated that 30 out of 69 sites were distributed in α-helices α1-α8, whereas only 3 sites were distributed in βstrands, β2, β3 and β7 (Figure 5A). Moreover, nearly 60%
of the positive-selection sites (19 out of 30) in α-helices
were clustered in α5 (5 sites), α6 (7 sites) and α7 (5 sites)
(Figure 5A). Interestingly, all of the positive-selection sites
in α-helices were clustered on the outside of the OPR protein and near the 8 inner β-strands (Figure 5B). In addition, 8 of the positive-selection sites were also detected in
the substrate binding loop (SBL) (Figure 5A), which was
clustered at the top of the OPR protein and formed the
ceiling of the substrate-binding pocket (Figure 5B). These
observations provide evidence that positive-selection sites
on α-helices, especially the α5, α6 and α7 helices,
together with the SBL, contributed to Darwinian selection
and evolution in the OPR gene family.

Analysis of functional divergence
We further investigated whether amino acid substitutions
in the highly conserved Oxidored_FMN domain could
have caused adaptive functional diversification. Two types
of functional divergence (type-I and type-II) between gene
clusters of the OPR family were estimated by posterior
analysis using the DIVERGE v2.0 program [36], which
evaluates the shifted evolutionary rate and altered amino
acid properties after gene duplication [37,38]. In this analysis, the 71 OPR proteins, except for AtOPR01-2/3 and
SbOPR06-4 (for which we do not have a complete
Oxidored_FMN domain), were used and the estimation
was based on the multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the Oxidored_FMN domain (Additional file 3)
for any two OPR subfamilies. Pairwise comparisons of
paralogous OPRs from subfamilies I to VII were carried
out and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence
position was estimated. Our results, as shown in Table 3,
indicated that with three exceptions (subfamily pairs II/
IV, V/VI and V/VI), the coefficients of type-I functional
divergence (θI) between OPR subfamilies were statistically
significant (p < 0.05; Table 3), with θI values varying from
0.114 to 0.437. These observations indicate that there
were significantly site-specific altered selective constraints
on most members of the OPR family, leading to subfamily-specific functional evolution after diversification.
Nonetheless, in contrast to the findings on type-I functional divergence, there was no evidence of type-II functional divergence among OPR subfamilies, suggesting that
the relative importance of type-I and type-II functional
divergence might be associated with specific functional
classes of the protein family [38].

Moreover, some critical amino acid residues responsible
for the functional divergence were predicted based on sitespecific profiles in combination with suitable cut-off values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison. In order to reduce false positives, Qk > 0.7 (Qk,
posterior probability) was used as the cutoff to identify
type-I functional divergence-related residues in all comparisons between the seven OPR subfamilies; the results
are shown in Table 3. These results show distinct differences in the number and distribution of predicted sites for
functional divergence within each pair (Table 3; Additional file 7). For example, 5 critical amino acid sites were
predicted for the subfamilyI/VI pair and distributed in
SSSU (Super Secondary Structure Unit) 1, 3, 4 and 6,
while 16 critical amino acids sites were predicted for the
subfamilyI/VII pair and distributed in SSSU 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 7 (Additional file 7). Further analysis revealed that 2
out of 5 sites in pair I/VI and 9 out of 15 sites in pair I/VII
were distributed in α helices and only one site (site 62)
was located in β2 in the subfamily I/VII pair (Additional
file 7). Similar cases were found in other subgroup pairs
(Additional file 7). In addition, 24 out of 69 positively

selected sites detected under model M3 (discrete) implemented in the codeml program of the PAML v4.0 package
were also found to be functionally divergent between OPR
paralogues (marked by asterisks in Tables 2 and 3). The
shifted evolutionary rate at specific amino acid sites
throughout the Oxidored_FMN domain within each pair
facilitated the functional divergence of OPR subfamilies
during the long period of evolution.

Discussion
Origin and evolution of the OPR gene family
The OPR gene family is present in all plant species and
generally has multiple genes in each species. In this study,
we comprehensively analyzed the phylogeny and evolution of the OPR gene family in all plant lineages, and the
results showed that seven well-conserved OPR subfamilies exist in plants (Figure 1A). All five OPR genes
identified from green algae fell into a separate clade (sub.
VII) while all OPR genes from land plants were clustered

into sub. I–VI (Figure 1A), suggesting that the OPR gene
might have originated before the divergence of green algae
and the ancestor of land plants. Moreover, the intron positions and the phases of adjacent exons in the
Oxidored_FMN domain were conserved in the OPR genes
in land plants (Figures 1B, 3; Additional file 3), suggesting
that all land plant OPR genes might have originated from
a common ancestor. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis
suggested that lineage-specific expansion events occurred
after the divergence between lower and higher land
plants, leading to the generation of sub. VI in lower land
plants and sub. I in higher land plants (Figure 2C). Similarly, lineage-specific expansion events also occurred in
higher land plants (monocots), and sub. III, IV and V were
generated after the divergence from dicots (Figure 2C).
Gene duplication, including tandem duplication, segmental duplication and genome duplication, continues to
be a pervasive process and contributes to biological novelty in evolution [39,40]. In this paper, the clustering distribution of OPR genes (Figure 2A) revealed that tandem
duplication had an additional role in determining the current size of the OPR gene family. Moreover, the search for
paralogues indicated that the SbOPR04-1/SbOPR06-3 pair
was generated by segmental duplication (Figure 2B); the
age estimation of OsOPR genes (data not shown) indicates that the divergence time within OPR gene pairs was
between 20.5 and 36.9 million years ago (Mya), falling
into the period of large-scale duplication events 30–40
Mya [41-43]. These observations suggest that large-scale
duplication may also have been involved in the expansion
of the OPR gene family in Sorghum and rice.
The above analysis reveals that the OPR gene family originated from a common ancestor of green plants, followed
by lineage-specific expansion and divergence in each lineage and species during their evolution. Moreover, lineagespecific expansion, especially by tandem duplication, is
likely to have contributed to the size of the OPR family
and yielded multiple OPR subfamilies in land plants,
especially in higher land plants such as monocots. Additionally, large-scale or segmental duplication may have
been involved in the expansion of the OPR gene family in
Sorghum and rice.
Successive intron loss for structural evolution
Gene duplication is a common phenomenon in plant
genomes and continues to be a pervasive force in genome
evolution [44]. To date, several models for the evolution
of genomes have been proposed based on comparative
genome studies of model organisms [45-47], but little
attention has been focused on the structural evolution of
duplicated gene families. In fact, the structural diversity of
gene family members is also a mechanism for the evolution of multiple gene families, and intron loss or gain can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

be an important step in generating structural diversity and
complexity [48]. In this study, we analyzed the structural
diversity of OPR genes (Figure 1B) and found that single
intron loss events occurred during the expansion and
structural evolution of OPR paralogues. We found that
most OPR family genes lost two or more introns, and the
number and position of intron loss was distinctly different among OPR genes (Figure 4). Furthermore, the intron
loss events occurred not only in different plant lineages
from algae to angiosperms (Figure 4B), but also in each
individual plant lineage, from the ancestral OPR of each
individual plant lineage to the present individual OPR
genes (Figure 4C). These results, in combination with the
phylogenetic trees of the OPR gene family (Figure 1A),
suggest that intron losses occurred successively rather than
simultaneously. In addition to intron loss, intron gain
may have occurred during the structural evolution of OPR
paralogues in green algae (Figure 4).
Intron positions have been shown to be remarkably wellconserved over long evolutionary time intervals [49,50],
and mounting evidence suggests that lineage-specific
intron loss may occur during the evolution of a gene family [51]. In this paper, we observed that the intron positions and intron phases of the OPR family genes were
well-conserved (Figures 1B, 3), and some introns (I1, I2, I4,
I6) were conserved in all plant lineages (Figure 4B). This
suggests that lineage-specific intron loss events might
have occurred during the expansion and structural evolution of OPR genes and generated diversity of gene structure.
The most commonly used model for intron loss is mRNAmediated intron loss [52,53], but there are also other possibilities such as simple genomic deletion [54] and inframe intron deletion [55]. Recent studies [56-58] have
indicated that introns closer to the 3' end of genes are preferentially lost, leaving the flanking exons to fuse and form
a large exon at the 3' end. In this study, the results of exonintron structure analysis (Figures 1B, 3) revealed that the
introns of OPR genes in aquatic plants (green algae) were
distributed relatively symmetrically among the coding
sequences, while the introns of OPR genes in land plants
were distributed asymmetrically, clustered at the 5' ends
with the largest exon at the 3' end (Figures 1B, 3A, 4).
Moreover, introns I8 to I12 (except for I9), located on the 3'
end, were lost in land plants after the divergence from
aquatic plants (Figure 4B). These findings suggest that
multiple unique introns, i.e., I8 -I12, were lost during the
evolution from aquatic plants to land plants and that
mRNA-mediated intron loss was responsible for their
deletion. In contrast, the presence of indels within introns
would predict that other mechanisms for intron loss (e.g.
simple genomic deletion and in-frame intron deletion)
were involved.

Functional divergence in the OPR gene family
Functional innovations including pseudogene formation
[59,60], subfunctionalization [61], neofunctionalization
[62] and subneofunctionalization [63] after gene duplication may result in altered functional constraints between
the gene clusters of a gene family. In this study, the differences between exon/intron structures and the divergences
in amino acid sequences among different subfamilies provided us with some hints that the OPR paralogues may
have a variety of physiological functions. The results of the
functional divergence analysis (Table 3) suggested that
OPR genes should be significantly functionally divergent
from each other, owing to the evolutionary rate differences at some amino acid sites. A reasonable explanation
for these differences would be that due to amino acid
mutations, the OPR family genes evolved some new subgroup-specific functions after divergence. Hence, functional divergence might reflect the existence of long-term
selective pressure. Previous studies regarding the enzymatic activity of OPR in Arabidopsis and tomato showed
that OPR enzymes could be classified into two groups
(OPR I and II) based on their substrate specificity, which
was determined by the substrate binding loop (SBL)
[18,19,64,65]. Site-specific profile analysis of OPR members showed that 24 out of the 69 positive-selection sites
found under model M3 (discrete) were functionally divergent and only 2 out of 24 critical amino acid sites (E157
and A158) were located in the SBL (Figure 5; Tables 2, 3
and Additional file 7). Moreover, the majority of positiveselection sites or critical amino acid sites were distributed
in α-helices, especially in α5, α6 and α7 (Figure 5; Additional file 7). These observations suggest that positiveselection pressure on the SBL, as well as α-helices, accelerated the functional divergence and formed multiple subfamilies in plants. Additionally, few positive-selection
sites were distributed in β-strands (β1-β8), suggesting that
the function of the 8 β-strands, clustered inside of the
OPR protein, might be to define the conserved fold common to all OPRs and maintain the proteins' structural
and/or conformational stability.

Studies on AtOPRs showed the AtOPR01-4 and AtOPR015, which belong to subfamily I, preferentially catalyze
9R,13R-OPDA and are predominantly expressed in roots
[20], whereas AtOPR02-1, which belongs to subfamily II,
catalyzes the reduction of 9S,13S-OPDA to form OPC 8:0
and is expressed in flowers and anthers [21,22]. Studies of
Atopr3 have shown that opr3 plants are deficient in the
biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and male-sterile, whereas
opr1 and opr2 plants are normal [19,21,22]. These studies,
together with the results of the phylogenetic analysis of
OPR paralogues in plants, suggest that OsOPR08-1,
ZmOPR01-1 and ZmOPR04-1, which belong to subfamily
II, are probable candidates for involvement in the JA biosynthesis pathway, while OsOPR04-1 and ZmOPR02-1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

which belong to subfamily I, are likely part of a defense
signaling pathway.
Additionally, the expression of OsOPR06-6 (OsOPR1), a
member of subfamily III, in the leaves of two week-old
seedlings is induced not only by hormones (JA, MeJA, SA)
and environmental stress factors such as drought, salt,
chilling, UV and O3, but also by protein phosphatase
inhibitors such as cantharidin (CN), endothall (EN) and
okadaic acid (OA) [16], while its expression in suspension-cultured rice cells is induced by JA and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) [15]. The results of
our phylogenetic analysis of the OPR gene family,
together with the previous studies, suggest that subfamily
III, existing exclusively in monocots, may have an important role in defense signaling pathways and the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The other two
subfamilies (IV and V) may represent pseudogene, subfunctionalization, or neofunctionalization families of
genes. Further experiments need to be performed to elucidate the function of these genes in monocots.

Conclusion
This study provides a comparative genomic analysis
addressing the phylogenetic relationships and evolution
of the OPR gene family in eleven species representing six
major lineages within the green plants. The results of the
phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven well-conserved
subfamilies exist in plants and that all OPR paralogues
originated from a common ancestor of green plants. Lineage-specific expansion, primarily through tandem duplication, contributed to the size of the OPR gene family, and
multiple subfamilies formed in land plants after divergence from aquatic plants. The exon/intron structure analysis showed that the gene structures were diverse, while
the intron positions and intron phases were highly conserved across different lineages. These observations
together with the results obtained from the phylogenetic
analysis indicate that successive single intron losses, as
well as indels within introns, were involved in the structural evolution of OPR paralogues. Finally, the functional
divergence analysis between OPR paralogues suggested
that significantly site-specific altered selective constraints
acted on most OPR paralogues after gene duplication,
leading to subgroup-specific functional evolution after
their phylogenetic diversification. This study also demonstrates that amino acids critical for functional divergence
are located in the regions including the substrate binding
loop (SBL), as well as in α-helices (especially helices α5,
α6 and α7), indicating the importance of these regions in
OPR proteins. These data may provide valuable information for future studies of the function of this gene family,
especially subfamilies III, IV and V in monocots.

Methods
Identification of OPR genes and their homologues in
plants
To identify OPR genes and their homologues in plants,
the BLASTP and TBLASTN programs were used to search
the TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research, http://
www.tigr.org/), TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information
Resource, http://www.arabidopsis.org/), MaizeGDB
(Maize Genetics and Genomics Database, http://
www.maizegdb.org/), PlantGDB (Plant Genome Database, http://www.plantgdb.org/), JGI (Joint Genome
Institute, http://genome.jgi-psf.org/) and NCBI (The
National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) non-redundant databases for protein sequences of the three previously
reported OPRs in Arabidopsis [10,20]. The Blast searches
were performed with the following criteria: E value < 1 ×
e-05 and only OPR or OPR-like genes from plants were
included. Moreover, proteins identified by the BLAST
search algorithms were considered as potential homologues when amino acid identity was above 25% over a
stretch of 200 amino acids. Then, the Pfam http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/search and SMART http://smart.emblheidelberg.de/ databases were employed to detect conserved domains with OPR or OPR-like protein candidates.
Finally, based on the Pfam and SMART analysis, we
refined the search results manually to further reduce hits
with partially conserved functional domains and other
false positives.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple-sequence alignment is the first step in phylogenetic analysis and the alignment quality may have an
enormous impact on the final phylogenetic tree [68-70].
Amino acid sequences of OPR genes and their homologues in plants were aligned using the EBI web tool Clustal W v2.0 program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw2/[71] with the default parameters. The GBlocks
0.91b program [70,72] was then used to select the conserved blocks of the above alignment with the default
parameters underlined. Thus, the poorly aligned positions, gap positions and divergent regions from the alignment were completely excluded from the phylogenetic
analyses. The Akaike Information criterion (AIC) was
implemented in ProtTest v1.4 [25] to estimate the most
appropriate model of amino acid substitution for treebuilding analyses. ProtTest v1.4 is based on the PhyML
program [73] for maximum likelihood (ML) optimizations, and the best-fit model considers the relative rates of
amino acid replacement and the evolutionary constraints
imposed by conservation of protein structure and function. Then, according to the best-fit model predicted by
ProtTest v1.4, a rooted maximum likelihood tree was constructed from the Gblocks alignment using the PhyML
v3.0 online program [24], and the reliability of interior

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/90

branches was assessed with 1000 bootstrap resamplings.
Considering the limitations of PhyML in tree-space
searches, the Phylip v3.68 package [26] was used to reconstruct the ML tree under the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT)
model [27]. Finally, the phylogenetic trees were displayed
using MEGA v3.1 [74]. In addition, another three phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with MEGA v3.1 from the
Gblocks alignment, by employing the neighbor joining
(NJ), minimal evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony
(MP) methods, respectively.
Estimating the pattern of nucleotide substitution and
positive-selection sites
The diversity of OPR genes was examined with molecular
evolutionary analyses using ω, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) to synonymous substitutions (dS), and a simple and useful measurement of
protein evolution [33]. Considering that positive selection may act in very short episodes or on only a few sites
during the evolution of duplicated genes, we calculated
the ω ratio for various amino acid sites and detected the
positive selection sites (ω > 1). First, accurate nucleotide
sequences and related multiple protein sequence alignments were obtained with PAL2NAL [75], a program that
constructs multiple codon alignments from matching
protein sequences. Then, the resulting codon alignments
and NJ tree were used in the program codeml from the
PAML v4.0 package [34] to calculate the dN/dS (or ω)
ratio for each site and to test different evolutionary models. The improved versions of site-specific models, recommended by Anisimova et. al. [35] and Wong et. al., [76]
were tested: Models M0 (one ratio), M1a (nearly neutral),
M2a (positive selection), M3 (discrete), M7 (beta) and M8
(beta+ ω) were all used in this analysis. Model M0
assumed a constant ω ratio, while in models M1a and
M2a ω is estimated from the date (0 < ω0 < 1) while ω1 =
1 is fixed. M7 and M8 assume a β-distribution for ω
between 0 and 1. Models M2a, M3, and M8 allow for the
occurrence of positively selected sites (ω > 1). Subsequent
likelihood rate comparisons of M0 with M3, M1a with
M2a, and M7 with M8, respectively, were performed to
test which model fits the data better. The difference in log
likelihood between the models, multiplied by two, was
compared with a chi-square distribution with n degrees of
freedom, n being the difference between the numbers of
parameters of the two models. A significantly higher likelihood of the alterative model compared to the null
model suggests positive selection. Finally, the Naive
Empirical Bayes (NEB) and/or Bayes Empirical Bayes
(BEB) approach were used to calculate the posterior probability that each site belongs to the site class of positive
selection under each model.

Functional divergence and altered functional constraint
analysis
To estimate the level of functional divergence and predict
important amino acid residues for these functional differences among OPR subfamilies, the coefficients of type-I
and type-II functional divergence (θI and θII) between any
two clusters were calculated for each position in the alignment (Additional file 3), using the method suggested by
Gu et. al. (1999, 2006) [38,77], as implemented in the
DIVERGE v2.0 package [36]. This method is based on
maximum likelihood procedures to estimate significant
changes in the site-specific shift of evolutionary rate or
site-specific shift of amino acid properties after the emergence of two paralogous sequences. The advantage of this
method is that it uses amino acid sequences and, thereby,
is not sensitive to saturation of synonymous sites. Type I
designates amino acid configurations that are very conserved in gene 1 but highly variable in gene 2, or vice
versa, implying that these residues have experienced
altered functional constraints (i.e., different evolutionary
rates) [77,78]. Type II designates amino acid configurations that are very conserved in both genes but whose biochemical properties are very different (e.g., positive versus
negative charge), implying that these residues may be
responsible for functional specification [78,79]. θI or θII
values that are significantly greater than 0, suggest sitespecific altered selective constraints or a radical shift of
amino acid physiochemical properties after gene duplication. Moreover, a site-specific posterior analysis was used
to predict amino acid residues that were crucial for functional divergence.
