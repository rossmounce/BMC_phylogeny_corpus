Abstract
Background: Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA viruses (NCLDV), a diverse group that infects a
wide range of eukaryotic hosts, exhibit a large heterogeneity in genome size (between 100 kb and
1.2 Mb) but have been suggested to form a monophyletic group on the basis of a small subset of
approximately 30 conserved genes. NCLDV were proposed to have evolved by simplification from
cellular organism although some of the giant NCLDV have clearly grown by gene accretion from a
bacterial origin.
Results: We demonstrate here that many NCLDV lineages appear to have undergone frequent
gene exchange in two different ways. Viruses which infect protists directly (Mimivirus) or algae
which exist as intracellular protists symbionts (Phycodnaviruses) acquire genes from a bacterial
source. Metazoan viruses such as the Poxviruses show a predominant acquisition of host genes. In
both cases, the laterally acquired genes show a strong tendency to be positioned at the tip of the
genome. Surprisingly, several core genes believed to be ancestral in the family appear to have
undergone lateral gene transfers, suggesting that the NCLDV ancestor might have had a smaller
genome than previously believed. Moreover, our data show that the larger the genome, the higher
is the number of laterally acquired genes. This pattern is incompatible with a genome reduction
from a cellular ancestor.
Conclusion: We propose that the NCLDV viruses have evolved by significant growth of a simple
DNA virus by gene acquisition from cellular sources.

Background
DNA viruses are ubiquitous components of the biosphere
and their number exceeds that of cells by at least an order
of magnitude [1]. This abundance is also accompanied by
an extraordinary diversity in genome size, composition
and organisation [2] and viruses have been divided into
many different classes based on these criteria. These obser-

vations raise multiple questions about the origin and evolution of different viral classes.
Briefly, three main hypotheses have been proposed to
explain the emergence of DNA viruses:

Page 1 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:320

- The "cell degeneration" hypothesis advocates that viruses
derive from a cellular ancestor via progressive simplification [3].
- The traditional "escape hypothesis" postulates that viruses
are autonomous genetic elements that have escaped from
a cellular genome [4].
- The "virus first" hypothesis proposes that viruses are
descendants of primordial genetic elements that were
components of the primitive soup [5].
These hypotheses have been extensively discussed in the
light of recent advances in comparative genomics (see for
example [6] and [7] and references therein). Interestingly,
the idea that some DNA viruses originate by reductive
evolution from a cellular ancestor was boosted by the discovery of a giant eukaryotic virus: the Mimivirus [8]. Mimivirus has a genome of 1.2 Mb, significantly larger than
that of several bacteria [9].
Under the cellular degeneration hypothesis, the mimivirus could be considered as a "missing link" between virus
and cell and it has been suggested that it may represent a
fourth domain of life in addition to the Bacteria, Archaea
and Eukarya [8]. However, mimivirus is one member of a
large family of viruses: the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large
DNA Viruses (NCLDV). This is an extremely diverse group
whose members infect a wide range of eukaryotic hosts
including algae (Phycodnaviruses), protists (Mimivirus)
and Metazoa (Poxviruses, African Swine Fever Virus, Iridoviruses). NCLDV are characterised by a large heterogeneity in genome size (between 100 kb and 1.2 Mb) and,
based on a small set of 30 common homologous (core)
genes, are thought to be monophyletic. These mainly
encode proteins involved in informational processes and
virus structure [10]. Several of these, such as the capsid
protein gene, have no homologues in cellular sequences
but have distant relatives in other classes of viruses. It has
been suggested that these shared genes could be considered as "hallmark viral genes" that derive from an ancient
virus world [11].
Controversially, it has been proposed that the giant
genome of the Mimivirus resulted from extensive accretion of host derived genes [10,12]. This view is supported
by scattered evidence of acquisition of host genes by
eukaryotic viruses [10,12-14] and by bacteriophages [1518]. This "gene pickpocket" viewpoint is reminiscent of
Hendrix's "moron hypothesis" (for: acquisition of more
and more foreign DNA) of bacteriophage evolution [15].
On the other hand, several hypotheses have proposed that
viral genes could be the source of new functions for their
host including: (i) invention of DNA by the viral world

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/320

and subsequent transfer to cellular organisms [19]; (ii)
replacement of the bacterial-type DNA replication apparatus of the mitochondria and the chloroplast by a phagetype system [20,21]; (iii) acquisition of a nucleus that
derives from a large double strand DNA virus such as a
Poxvirus [22,23].
However, accumulating evidence shows that some viral
genes are only distantly related to their host counterparts.
This is not consistent with the idea of frequent horizontal
exchange of these genes between host and virus
[17,18,24-26].
Thus, the debate concerning the exact role of lateral gene
exchange during evolution of each of the many classes of
virus remains open. This question seems particularly relevant for NCLDV because of the large variations in
genomic repertoire and size in the different lineages.
Indeed, we have recently shown that the genome of the
giant representatives of the NCLDV (Mimivirus and Phycodnaviruses) display an unexpected abundance of
islands of bacterial-like genes. We hypothesized that these
Giant Virus genomes grow in size by successive accretion
of bacterial-like genes provided by their hosts that graze
on bacteria [27]
In this study, we have undertaken a complete phylogenetic survey of NCLDV genes that have homologs in the
cellular genome. We show that NCLDV which infect Metazoa display a large collection of host-derived genes,
whereas giant NCLDV which infect (or are "associated"
with) protists (see below) derive their "non-viral" genes
principally from a bacterial source. Moreover, those phycodnaviruses which infect free-living algae do not carry
extensive numbers of bacterial-like genes. Taken together,
these results suggest that NCLDV grow by accretion of cellular genes rather than simplify themselves by genome
reduction from a complex ancestor.

Results and discussion
Distribution of bacterial-like genes in NCLDV
We previously reported that Chlorella Phycodnaviruses
and Mimivirus genomes carry respectively 48 to 57 genes
and 96 genes that appeared to be unambiguously of bacterial origin We considered a gene to be originated from a
bacteria if the sequence is phylogenetically closer to bacteria than other organisms, including other viruses [27].
These genes tended to be clustered in islands towards the
extremities of the genomes. The genomes also carried a
large number of diverse bacterial-like mobile genetic elements (MGE) such as insertion sequences, inteins, restriction/modification systems and homing endonucleases
[27]. Moreover, several consecutive bacterial-like genes
showing synteny with identifiable bacteria appeared to
have been co-inherited.

Analysis of additional, newly available, Chlorella Phycodnavirus genomes gave similar results (Additional file 1).
These data strongly support the idea that some giant
NCLDV members have acquired a large panel of genes
originating from bacteria.

the genome size (Fig. 1). Although there is a general
increase in bacterial gene number with genome size, there
is also a strong dichotomy between the Chlorella Phycodnaviruses and Mimivirus, which are considerably
enriched for bacterial genes, and Phycodnaviruses EHV86
and ESV-1 which are not. In addition, very few MGE could
be found in these two Algal viruses. Two copies of an
intact IS4-family element are present in the ESV-1 genome
but no inteins restriction/modification systems or bacterial-like homing endonucleases could be found. EHV86
and ESV-1 infect Emilinia huxleyi and Ectocarpus siliculosus
respectively. Importantly these are free-living algae and
are not known to ingest bacteria. This provides strong support for lateral bacterial gene transfer since, in contrast to
the Chlorella viruses and Mimivirus, neither EHV86 nor
ESV-1 viruses live in intimate contact with bacteria.

Bacterial-like genes are less frequent in Phycodnaviruses of
free living algae
We suggested that their eukaryotic hosts, which graze on
bacteria, could provide the "ecological" niche for viral
access to bacterial gene pools. The Phycodnaviruses analysed infect Chlorellae which in turn live in symbiosis with
Paramecia or Heliozoa from the genus Acanthocystis while
the Mimivirus infects Amoebae directly.

However, many NCLDV lineages infect metazoa or algae
that do not use bacteria as prey. The question which therefore arose was whether these genomes carry a significant
number of bacterial-type genes and MGE. We therefore
screened a representative set of NCLDV (see Materials and
Methods) for such genes and plotted their number against

Bacterial-like genes are rare in metazoan NCLDV
Poxviruses, Iridioviruses and Asfarvirus carry even fewer
bacterial-like genes than Phycodnaviruses EHV86 and
ESV-1. In Metazoan and viruses from free-living algae,

these tend to be scattered in the genome, with no apparent
clustering in islands towards the genome ends (data not
shown)
As in the case of the two viruses from free-living algae, no
or very few MGE were found in Metazoan viruses. Thus,
viruses which coexist with protists (i.e. exposed to bacterial foraging) contain a clearly larger proportion of bacterial-like genes compared to metazoan and algal viruses.
These data suggest that lateral acquisition of bacterial-like
genes and MGE is not a central force in shaping metazoan
and algal virus genomes. On the other hand, the genome
complexity and size of the Mimivirus and the Chlorella
Phycodnaviruses seem to be substantially explained by
the accretion of a diverse array of bacterial genes and
MGE. This important difference in these two classes of
NCLDV seems to be a natural consequence of the ecology
of their host since, like free living Algae, Metazoa do not
(generally) graze on bacteria. This limits genetic promiscuity between the DNA of replicating viruses and that of
bacteria.
Respective abundance of host-derived genes in NCLDV
NCLDV genomes also carry a large set of diverse genes
with eukaryotic affinities [10,27]. These could have been
inherited from a common ancestor of the NCLDV predating the divergence of the major eukaryotic lineage or
could have been acquired by recent lateral gene transfer
from the host. Alternatively, the eukaryotic host could
have acquired the gene from one of its viruses. Fortunately, these scenarios might be decipherable since the
sequences of many of the NCLDV host genomes (or their
relatives) are now available. To identify viral genes closely
related to those of the host, and therefore constituting
good candidates for gene transfer, the following BLAST
approach was used:

Viral genes with host homologues were identified using a
BLAST search of each viral ORF against the "host" (or
related) genome and the best hit score was noted and
compared to first hits from a similar BLAST search using a
purged non-redundant database (see Materials and Methods). The two corresponding BLAST scores for each gene
were then plotted against each other (Fig 2, upper panel).
Genes putatively implicated in transfer with the host will
appear below the 1:1 diagonal. The ratio "BLAST score
host genome/BLAST score NR database" was then calculated for each gene and plotted as a function of the position of that gene on the genome. This analysis enables
visualization of the position in the genome of those genes
suspected of acquisition from the host since they have a
ratio higher than 1 (Fig. 2A–F, lower panel). As we suspect
that most laterally transferred genes in NCLDV are
acquired by single strand DNA invasion at the tips of the
viral genome, we believe that the localisation of the later-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/320

ally transferred genes in the viral genome could provide
additional arguments for identifying host-derived genes
as it did in the case of bacterial-like genes [27]. The importance of patterns in viral genome organisation as a source
of additional evolutionary arguments has been previously
underlined by Shackelton and Holmes [28]
Among the NCLDV, Poxviruses were found to carry a
larger proportion of genes with eukaryotic affinities than
other members of the group (Additional file 2). An important fraction of these genes is more closely related to the
corresponding host homologs than to the other
homologs present in a NR database (Fig 2, upper panels:
A, B and C). Moreover, genes that are more similar to the
host copies tend to be clustered at the tips of the genome
(Fig 2 lower panels: A, B and C). To substantiate this
effect, the data were fitted with equations describing the
two hypotheses: homogeneous distribution along the
entire genome or overrepresentation at the tips of the
genome. Best fit results were chosen with an F test (P <
0,05). This statistical analysis (Additional file 3) validated
the hypothesis that the laterally acquired genes tend to be
clustered towards the ends of the poxvirus genomes. This
result is in agreement with the hypothesis of multiple lateral gene exchanges with the host.
Iridoviruses and the Asfarvirus have a lower number of
genes with eukaryotic affinities (Additional file 2) but a
significant fraction of these are also more related to their
host homolog than to the other homologs. However,
these genes do not have a strong tendency to be present at
the tip of their respective genomes but appears randomly
distributed along the genome (Additional file 3). This
implies that exchange of such genes may have either
occurred by a different mechanism than other laterally
acquired genes and/or have subsequently undergone rearrangement in the genome.
Finally, despite having larger genomes, the Chlorella Phycodnaviruses and the Mimivirus have the lowest proportion (number/genome length) of genes with potential
eukaryotic origins (these numbers are presented in Additional file 2). Only a handful of these eukaryotic-like
genes appear to be closely related to their host counterparts (Fig 2 and [26] for the mimivirus). However, the
majority of these tend to be present at the tip of the
genome. These data indicate that among NCLDV, Poxviruses have the strongest tendency to exchange genes with
their host. Iridoviruses and the Asfarvirus seem to be less
prone to lateral gene exchange with their host, and the
Phycodnaviruses and the Mimivirus, despite having larger
genomes, have the lowest number of genes putatively
involved in lateral transfers with their respective hosts. In
an attempt to validate theses results and to determine the
direction of lateral gene transfers between the virus and its

viral gene that is more similar to its host homolog than to
other homologs (some examples are shown in Fig. 3 and
discussed below).

Phylogenies including both viral genes and cellular genes
can help to determine the direction of a putative lateral
gene transfer. Three scenarios are possible. If the viral
genes are ancestral (without any transfer), then all viral
genes would be positioned together at the base of the tree
and the cellular sequences would be clustered outside the

viral groups. If, on the other hand, the viral sequences fall
within a cluster of cellular genes, they were probably captured by the virus from the host. Inversely, if the cellular
sequences fall into viral clusters, the cellular sequences
more probably originated from a virus [28]. The phylogenetic validation of the NCLDV genes showed that all those
identified by BLAST to have probably undergone lateral
gene exchange with the host are the result of transfers
from the host. The results obtained from a selected subset
of these genes are presented in Fig. 3. This result shows
that a simple and fast BLAST approach permits identification, with reasonable confidence, of viral genes that have
been acquired from their host.
Surprisingly, examination of these host-derived genes
revealed that several are constituents of the core genes of
the NCLDV family [10]. Core genes are thought to be
inherited from a common ancestor that predates the
divergence of the different lineages of NCLDVs [10]. If this
were the case, each of the different NCLDV core genes
should cluster together in the phylogenetic tree, ideally at
the base of the eukaryotic tree. On the other hand, if some
genes were acquired by lateral transfer with the host, the
corresponding gene will appear polyphyletic, and ideally,
as a sister-taxon of the host sequences. Six core genes follow the last scenario and are therefore probably acquired
by polarised lateral gene transfer from the host (Fig 3).
They are (Table 1):
- ATP-dependent DNA ligase (Fig. 3A) (several vertebrate
Poxviruses and the Phycodnavirus EHV86). In the case of
EHV86, the sequence is closely related to those belonging

to the plantae lineage (plant and red/green alga). The algal
host of EHV86, Emiliana huxleyi, is a haptophyte that
contains a red algal endosymbiont. Thus, the virus may
have recruited its ATP-dependant DNA ligase from a gene
carried by the photosynthetic red algal endosymbiont.
Interestingly, Mimivirus, Iridoviruses and Entomopoxviruses carry a non-homologous NAD dependant DNA
ligase. The phylogeny of this version of the enzyme does
not display any evidence of transfers (data not shown). It
is tempting to suggest that the NAD dependant ligases are
the ancestral version of the enzyme and that these have
been displaced by an ATP-dependant ligase from the hosts
in several NCLDV lineages (vertebrate Poxviruses and
EHV86).
- dUTPase (Fig. 3B) (Chlorella Phycodnaviruses, Entomopoxviruses, amphibian Iridoviruses, and the contagious pustular dermatitis Poxviruses, also called orf
Poxvirus). In the case of the dUTPase, Mimivirus uses a
different version which is a homolog of the MazG type
dUTPase probably acquired from bacteria (Iyer 2006).
- Serine/Threonine Kinase (Fig. 3C) (vertebrate Poxviruses and the CIV Iridovirus).
- Thymidine Kinase (Fig. 3D)(vertebrate Poxviruses and
CIV Iridovirus).
- Ribonucleotide Reductase (Fig. 3E and 3F) (small subunit: mammalian Poxviruses and Trichoplusia ni Ascovirus; large subunit: mammalian Poxviruses).

In addition, although the folate-dependant thymidilate
synthase (ThyA-type) of all NCLDV lineages is
polyphyletic and scattered within the tree, all retain a distant relationship with those of the respective hosts (data
not shown). This might also reflect lateral gene transfer.
Interestingly, the Chlorella Phycodnaviruses use a flavindependent thymidilate synthase (ThyX-type), probably
deriving from Bacteria [29], that has replaced the ancestral
folate-dependant thymidilate synthase. Close examination of the phylogenies show that core genes putatively
acquired from the host are a mix of recent and more
ancient events. For example, among the 8 putative cases of
transfers in the Poxvirus genomes, four events appears
before the splits of the mammalian or the avian lineages
(Fig. 3B, C and 3D). On the other hands, the four remaining events are more ancient ie predating the birds and
mammals divergence (Fig. 3E and 3F) or predating the
divergence between the deuterostomes and the protostomes (Fig 2A).
In summary, the phylogeny of the core genes involved in
DNA metabolism provide evidence of frequent lateral
transfers from different cellular sources to NCLDV. As
noted above, Poxviruses seem the more affected by these

transfers. However, we cannot rule out that these genes are
not "true" NCLDV core genes but result from multiple and
independent acquisition of copies from different cellular
sources (host or bacterial prey of the host). Alternatively,
these transfers could constitute independent homologous
and non-homologous replacement of the version of the
gene already present in the common NCLDV ancestor.
Other core genes are transmitted vertically from the
common ancestor of the NCLDV
Additionally, we have carried out a phylogenetic analysis
of all other core genes with recognizable cellular
homologs (table 1). Analysis of the different trees does
not provide clear evidence of additional gene transfers
among these core genes: in almost all of the phylogenies,
NCLDV sequences form monophyletic groups at the base
of the eukaryotic tree. The only exception could be topoisomerase II which, in the case of the Poxviruses and the
Mimiviruses, has been displaced by a bacterial-like topoisomerase I [30]. Taken together these observations suggest
that the number of ancestral NCLDV core genes could be
smaller than previously suggested [10] because several
enzymes (mainly involved in DNA metabolism) could

have been acquired independently by the NCLDV lineages
from their respective hosts.
Metazoan NCLDVs show a predominant acquisition of
host genes compared to Phycodnaviruses and the
Mimivirus
Finally, we have plotted the number of genes, validated by
their phylogeny, that display clear evidence of lateral
transfer with their host (Fig 4). It is clear that Poxviruses
and, to a lesser degree, Iridoviruses and Asfarviruses, have
undergone frequent gene exchanges with their host. Fowl
Poxvirus, for example, carries the largest proportion of
host-derived genes of the entire NCLDV group. We also
note that in general among the Metazoan NCLDV, the bigger the genome, the higher the number of host-derived
genes. In contrast, Chlorella Phycodnaviruses and the
Mimivirus, which have larger genomes, have a lower
number of host-derived genes. Moreover there does not
seem to be a correlation between genome size and hostderived gene abundance in these cases. This result is in
striking contrast with that in Fig. 1 which shows that
Metazoan viruses have fewer bacterial-like genes than the
viruses which are in intimate contact with protists. This is
in agreement with our previous suggestion that the Chlorella Phycodnaviruses and the Mimivirus derive their bacterial-like genes from the prokaryotic prey of their host (or
host symbiont). We propose that, among the NCLDV,
there is a general trend of acquisition of genes of cellular
origin and that (at least) two distinct evolutionary pathways may have been used:

- Metazoan viruses preferentially derive their "new" genes
from their host.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/320

Additionally, one can argue that these host-derived genes
are in turn the results of a lateral gene transfers from a
virus or a phage. In this case, a large proportion of the
host-derived genes identified in this study will have
homologues in viruses. For a representative set of
NCLDVs, we used a BLAST approach seeded with genes
identified as host-derived against a complete viral databanks purged from NCLDV sequences. Additional file 4
indicated the total number of host derived genes for each
NCLDV genomes and the number of host derived genes
that has viral homologues. The number of host derived
genes that has viral homologues infecting the same host
(or a closely related host) are also mentioned. This analysis shows that only a minor proportion of the hostderived genes have viral homologues (0–27%), and this
proportion decrease significantly if we take into account
only homologues of viruses infecting the same (or
related) hosts (0–16%). In one case, the Iridovirus IIV6,
the proportion reaches 50% but this viral genome seems
to be modestly affected by gene transfers (only 8 genes
were identified as deriving from the host genome). We can
also note that NCLDVs genes that have viral homologues
could be the results of independent gene acquisitions
from their respective hosts, and thus do not constitute
direct evidences of virus to virus gene transfers. In other
words, this analysis probably over-estimated the level of
inter-virus gene transfers because some of them are probably the results of independent genes acquisitions from
the hosts. Taken together, these results show that most, if
not all, of the host derived genes identified in this study
do not have a viral origin and thus constitute bona fide evidences of host-to-virus gene transfers.

Conclusion
- Protist-infecting viruses preferentially derive their new
genes from the bacterial prey of their host.
Unfortunately, the complete genome sequences of Ectocarpus siliculosus and Emilinia huxleyi are not yet available
and we have not therefore been able to analyse host gene
acquisition by their respective Phycodnaviruses. These
viruses (EHV86: 407 kb and ESV-1: 336 kb) have similar
genome sizes to other Phycodnaviruses that infect symbiotic algae but are larger than NCLDV members that infect
Metazoa. As these viruses have low proportions of bacterial-type genes, we might predict that they have accumulated a large collection of eukaryotic-derived genes.
Interestingly, the initial report of the genome sequence of
EHV86 shows the existence of a large region of 100 kb
with very few homologies with NCLDV and with genes in
general databanks [31]. This region could be a hotspot for
insertion of host-derived genes as observed, for example,
at the tips of the Poxvirus, Mimivirus and Chlorella Phycodnavirus genomes.

In this and the previous study [27], we have shown that
the large diversity of the genomic repertoire of the different lineages of NCLDV can be explained principally by the
accretion of a sizeable collection of cellular genes derived
from their host (notably by Metazoan NCLDV) and/or
from bacteria (mainly for the viruses infecting protists and
symbiotic algae). In addition, recent studies underlined
the importance of lineage specific gene duplication during
the evolution of the NCLDV [9,32]. For example, Mimivirus has more than 400 duplicated genes belonging to 80
different families that are generally not present outside
this genome [32]. These different observations are not in
accord with the idea that NCLDV, and especially the giant
representatives of the family, have undergone a simplification process by loosing a large array of genes from a
complex cellular ancestor [8]. Moreover, the results from
this study suggest that NCLDV display a general trend of
genome growth by accretion of a wide variety of genes
from cellular sources. Thus, it appears unlikely that the
NCLDV ancestor was a cellular organism. Moreover, the
NCLDV capsid is homologous to those of Adenovirus and

of some bacteriophages and archaeal viruses [33]. These
arguments support a viral origin for the NCLDV, including the giant Mimivirus.
The nature and level of complexity of the NCLDV ancestor
remains speculative, but comparative genomic [10] and
phylogenetic analysis of conserved "core" genes of the
family (this study) raises the possibility that it might have
been a small DNA virus with a limited subset of 30–40
genes encoding principally DNA replication and virion
structural proteins, in addition to several transcription
enzymes.
The presence, in the common ancestor, of enzymes implicated in the final steps of DNA metabolism is still controversial as almost all these enzymes display clear evidence
of gene transfer from their host (this study). However
such transfers could have occurred only recently by
homologous and non-homologous replacement of viraltype ancestral copies in NCLDV. The probable small
genome size of the ancestor would be compatible with a
transition from an ancient RNA virus which subsequently
"invented" DNA to protect its genome from RNA-degrading or modifying enzyme of its host [19]. The existence of
viruses with both RNA and DNA states, such as retroviruses or hepadnaviruses, constitutes a supplementary
argument for an RNA to DNA transition as the origin of
primeval DNA viruses including the NCLDV ancestor
[19]. This view could explain why the replication enzymes
of the NCLDV are very distantly related to their host counterparts: they would have been invented or recruited by
the NCLDV ancestors very early during the RNA to DNA
transitions. According to one hypothesis [19], archaeal
viruses and bacteriophages may have invented their own
DNA genome independently. This might provide a simple
explanation for the diversity of DNA machineries of the
different groups of DNA viruses. Acquisition of a stable
DNA genome that is faithfully replicated would then
allow these viruses to grow progressively in genome size
and complexity. From this simple DNA ancestor, each
NCLDV lineage could have subsequently acquired a large
number of lineage-specific genes from a cellular source.
Eventually this could have been followed by extensive
gene duplication which would have contributed to the
gigantism of several representatives of the family.
Alternatively, the NCLDV ancestor could have resulted
from escape of an ancient "selfish" eukaryotic DNA element that had acquired a capsid gene from a DNA virus to
become infective. The small DNA genomes of each
NCLDV lineage could have undergone extensive growth
in genome size and complexity. Interestingly such an
intermediate between eukaryotic viruses and selfish
mobile elements, the Maverick transposon, exists in a
variety of eukaryotic genomes. This displays typical char-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/320

acteristics of mobile elements such as an integrase and
long terminal inverted repeat with multiple copies in a
given genome and typical features of viruses such as a protein-primed DNA polymerase and packaging or capsid
protein [34]. As previously mentioned, the NCLDV capsid
is related to those of bacteriophages and archaeal viruses
[33], as well as the A32-like packaging ATPase which have
closer homologs in eukaryotic transposons and in DNA
bacteriophages. This latter enzyme is probably involved in
the separation of viral chromosomes and their packaging
into the virion [10]. These NCLDV core genes with no cellular homologs would favour a chimeric origin for the
NCLDV ancestor between a prokaryotic DNA virus and a
eukaryotic transposon [11]. However, the "chimeric DNA
hypothesis" does not explain why archaeal viruses,
eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages use very different
mechanisms of DNA replication.
These two hypotheses for the origin of the NCLDV ancestors ("RNA to DNA transition" and "escaped/chimeric
DNA") seem to provide a more likely scenario than does
the cellular reduction hypothesis since the latter is not
compatible with the observed extensive gene accretion
and lineage-specific gene duplication which occured subsequent to the division of each NCLDV group.

Dataset construction
The phylogenetic affinities of each NCLDV ORF were
determined using BLASTP against a non-redundant database with an exclusion threshold of E < 10-5 [35]. If the
query produced genes from different kingdoms (Eukarya/
Bacteria/Archaea/Virus) within the first ten hits of a BLAST
search, the evolutionary status of the gene was analysed
further by individual phylogenetic analysis (see below). If
the queries retrieved matches with a single kingdom
within the first ten hits, the affinities of the gene were
assigned directly. This approach previously allowed us to
identify a large proportion of bacterial-type genes in Giant
NCLDV [27]. This analysis also revealed the presence of a
large panel of genes with Eukaryotic affinities that are
putative candidates for lateral gene transfer with the host.
However, phylogenetic analysis of each gene is time consuming and difficult to automate. Fortunately, most of the
host (or related) genomes are now available and we could
therefore search for viral genes that are closely related to
their host gene homologues.

To specifically identify candidates of LGT we proceeded as
follows: for each ORF with eukaryotic affinities, we determined all the reciprocal best matching ORFs between the
virus and its host (or, when unavailable, closely related
organisms) and then between the virus and a Non-Redundant (NR) database purged of host or closely related
sequences. For example, for the Fowlpox virus we used
BLAST to compare each ORF with eukaryotic affinities
against the Galus galus genome. This was then repeated
against a NR database purged of all vertebrate sequences.
The BLAST score expressed as a BIT score http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html
of each viral ORF against the G. galus data set was then
plotted against those obtained from the non-vertebrate set
(Fig. 2). Those viral genes having a higher affinity with G.
galus fall below the diagonal. Additionally the ratio of the
G. galus BLAST score and that of the non-vertebrate BLAST
score was plotted against the position of the ORF within
the viral genome. In this case, points which occur above
the horizontal line (Fig. 2) are more closely related to the
host than to other non-vertebrate species. This supplies
important information concerning gene position and
linkage on the genetic map. For the bacterial-type genes,
this provided evidence of gene co-capture [27]. Finally, all
good candidate ORFs were validated using individual
phylogenetic analysis.
To identify viral homologs of the host-derived genes identified before, we BLAST each of these ORFs against a Viral
Database purged from the NCLDVs sequences using a
exclusion threshold of E < 10-5 . Each positive searches
were divided into two categories : (1) NCLDV sequences
that match with sequences from viruses infecting the same
host or a closely related host and (2) NCLDV sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/320

that match with sequences from viruses infecting a different host.
Statistical tests
Statistical analyses were performed using the reciprocal
ratio, R, (BLAST score NR database/BLAST score host
genome) to avoid infinite values. ORF positions were converted to a relative distance, D, from the genome centre.
The plots of this ratio as a function of the relative ORF
position on the genome, R = f(D), illustrate the distribution along the host genome. To confirm the visual effect,
we fitted the profile to an empirical function: R = 1 + A*D2
using GraphPad Prism v4.0. For each dataset, we performed two fits, with the parameter A either unconstrained (non-random distribution of ORFs along the
genome) or constrained to 0 (no dependence of the relative ORF position). Results were compared with an F test
(P > 0,05) to determine the best fit.
Phylogenetic analysis
Homologous sequences were identified by BLAST and a
representative set of viral and eukaryotic sequences were
randomly chosen to cover all the recognized lineages of
each group of NCLDV (Poxvirus, Phycodnavirus etc...).
These alignments were inspected and manually refined.
Gaps and ambiguously aligned positions were eliminated
from the phylogenetic analysis. For all markers, we performed preliminary analyses by NJ (without correction)
using MUST 3.0 [36] by Maximum likelihood (ML), using
PROML (phylip v3.6) with the JTT amino acid substitution matrix, a rate heterogeneity model with gamma-distributed rates over four categories with the α parameter
estimated using TREE-PUZZLE, global rearrangements
and randomized input order of sequences (10 jumbles).
