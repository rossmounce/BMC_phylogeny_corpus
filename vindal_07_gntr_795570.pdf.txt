Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium smegmatis is fast growing non-pathogenic mycobacteria. This
organism has been widely used as a model organism to study the biology of other virulent and
extremely slow growing species like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the homology of the Nterminal DNA binding domain, the recently sequenced genome of M. smegmatis has been shown
to possess several putative GntR regulators. A striking characteristic feature of this family of
regulators is that they possess a conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain and a diverse Cterminal domain involved in the effector binding and/or oligomerization. Since the physiological role
of these regulators is critically dependent upon effector binding and operator sites, we have
analysed and classified these regulators into their specific subfamilies and identified their potential
binding sites.
Results: The sequence analysis of M. smegmatis putative GntRs has revealed that FadR, HutC,
MocR and the YtrA-like regulators are encoded by 45, 8, 8 and 1 genes respectively. Further out
of 45 FadR-like regulators, 19 were classified into the FadR group and 26 into the VanR group. All
these proteins showed similar secondary structural elements specific to their respective subfamilies
except MSMEG_3959, which showed additional secondary structural elements. Using the
reciprocal BLAST searches, we further identified the orthologs of these regulators in Bacillus subtilis
and other mycobacteria. Since the expression of many regulators is auto-regulatory, we have
identified potential operator sites for a number of these GntR regulators by analyzing the upstream
sequences.
Conclusion: This study helps in extending the annotation of M. smegmatis GntR proteins. It
identifies the GntR regulators of M. smegmatis that could serve as a model for studying orthologous
regulators from virulent as well as other saprophytic mycobacteria. This study also sheds some light
on the nucleotide preferences in the target-motifs of GntRs thus providing important leads for
initiating the experimental characterization of these proteins, construction of the gene regulatory
network for these regulators and an understanding of the influence of these proteins on the
physiology of the mycobacteria.

Background
Being a fast growing, non-pathogenic mycobacteria, Mycobacterium smegmatis has been widely used as a model
organism to study the biology of other virulent and
extremely slow growing species like M. tuberculosis. The
genome of M. smegmatis, as listed at the TIGR site, contains a large number of putative GntR-like regulators.
These regulators play an important role in the cellular
physiology. Many such regulators are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to various oxidized
substrates related to either amino acid metabolism or at
the branch points of various other metabolic pathways.
The GntR family of bacterial regulators is named after the
Bacillus subtilis transcription regulator- GntR- a repressor
of the gluconate operon [1]. Regulators of this family possess a conserved N-terminal domain that is involved in
the DNA binding. Based on this conservation, these proteins can easily be recognized by a Conserved Domain
Database (CDD) search [2]. However, the C-terminal
domain, which is involved in the effector binding and/or
oligomerization (E-b/O), is quite diverse and heterogeneous. As a consequence of this heterogeneity, the GntR regulators have been further classified into six subfamilies
(FadR, HutC, MocR, YtrA, AraR and PlmA) [3,4]. The
members of subfamilies possess conserved secondary
structural features specific to their subfamily and interact
with a limited number of molecules [5]. Considering
these conserved secondary structural features in sequence
analysis, GntR regulators are defined as a part of specific
subfamily [6]. Earlier, we have characterized GntR regulators from M. tuberculosis [7]. In present study putative
GntR regulators from M. smegmatis are classified into their
specific subfamilies. Further, suitable orthologs of the M.
smegmatis GntRs were also identified using reciprocal
BLAST searches in M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. bovis, M.
ulcerans, M. sp. KMS, M. sp. MCS, M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 and
B. subtilis. To identify the DNA targets of these regulators,
we utilized the information about the nucleotide preferences for regulators of a given subfamily. All the upstream
DNA sequences of the GntR coding genes were scanned to
locate potential palindromes that matched the nucleotide
preference criteria [5].

Results and discussion
Classification of the putative M. smegmatis GntRs into
subfamilies
Unrooted tree of the M. smegmatis GntRs was constructed
with the classified representatives of all subfamilies (Table
1) [5]. Among all putative M. smegmatis GntRs two proteins (MSMEG_1043 and MSMEG_2323) were found to
be identical in sequence, hence only one of them
MSMEG_1043 was taken for the classification. Each
branch of the constructed tree represents a subfamily.
Bootstrapping, involving 1000 replicates, shows all sub-

family branches clustered with high bootstrap values.
FadR subfamily is divided into two groups, FadR and
VanR (Figure 1).
FadR-like proteins of M. smegmatis
Of all the putative GntRs, 45 proteins were classified as
the FadR-like regulators. These subfamily members are
further classified into two groups FadR and VanR where
the C-terminal effector binding and/or oligomerization
domain length is about 170 and 150 amino acid residues
respectively comprising all α-helices [5]. Among all FadRlike regulators, 19 regulators were clustered as members of
the FadR group while 26 for the VanR group (Table 2). To
study secondary structural features both the group members were dealt with separately. C-terminal domain of all
the members of FadR group were predicted with seven αhelices except MSMEG_2599. All the regulators showed
distinguishable predicted secondary structural features
specific to this subfamily (Figure 2 and Figure 3) [5]. Secondary structural patterns of the regulator MSMEG_3959
revealed an extra secondary structural element, which
could be significant in studying protein family evolution.
FadR-like regulators are known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to oxidized substrates related to either amino acid metabolism or at the
branch point in various metabolic pathways such as glycolate [8], pyruvate [9], lactate [10], malonate [11] or gluconate [12]. One of FadR-like classified transcriptional
regulator MSMEG_6700 is known to be involved in the
regulation of piperidine and pyrrolidine metabolism [13].
These results provide a starting point for a detailed biochemical and genetic characterization of M. smegmatis
FadR-like regulators.
HutC-like proteins of M. smegmatis
Contrary to the FadR-like regulators, the regulators of this
subfamily consist of both α-helices and β-sheet structures
in the C-terminal domain. We identified eight GntRs as
members of this subfamily (Table 2). All these members
showed distinguishable predicted secondary structural
features specific to this subfamily (Figure 4) [5]. These regulators are known to acquire the same protein fold as
Escherichia coli UbiC; hence it is also named as UbiC transcription regulator-associated (UTRA) domain [14]. This
effector-binding domain responds to various ligands like
histidine (HutC) [15], long chain fatty acids [16], trehalose 6-phosphate [17] or alkylphosphonate [18]. A range
of known ligands, specific to many HutC-like regulators,
will help in characterizing the classified M. smegmatis regulators.
MocR-like protein of M. smegmatis
Among all the putative GntR regulators, eight were classified as members of the MocR subfamily (Table 2). All the
eight regulators showed distinguishable predicted second-

ary structural features specific to this subfamily (Figure 5)
[5]. MocR-like regulators show homology to the class I
aminotransferase proteins [19], which requires pyridoxal
5'-phosphate (PLP) as a co-factor. All MocR-like regulators exhibit a PLP attachment site with a conserved lysine
residue, which is also evident in the classified MocR-like
regulators (Figure 5). It would thus be interesting to study
the role of pyridoxal phosphate regulation in the classified regulators. [20].

YtrA-like protein of M. smegmatis
The YtrA subfamily is the least represented GntR-like regulator in the bacterial genomes. Among all M. smegmatis
GntR regulators, only one regulator MSMEG_5174,
showed the signatures of the YtrA subfamily member
(Table 2, Figure 6). YtrA possesses a reduced C-terminal
domain with only two α-helices. The average length of the
putative effector binding and/or oligomerization domain
is about 50 amino acids [5]. YtrA from B. subtilis is an
experimentally explored regulator, which is part of a large
self-regulated operon. This operon consists of genes
encoding the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transport sys-

tems in addition to the YtrA [21]. It would be interesting
to study further, whether MSMEG_5174 has any role in
modulating such an operon.
Operator/binding site analysis
We have tabulated a list of potential operator sites near
the perfect palindrome sequence with conserved residues,
which are found to be specific for most of the subfamily
members (Table 3) [5]. We did not find an operator
sequence in the upstream sequences of all the remaining
regulators. All the predicted sites were found to be in the
upstream region from the translation start site except
MSMEG_2599. Identification of these sites is an impor-

tant step to understand the GntR associated regulon or the
gene regulatory network in the genome [22-25].
Ortholog prediction
We have found a number of M. smegmatis GntR regulators
that are orthologs of proteins from the other species of
mycobacteria and B. subtilis (Table 4). As orthologs typically share the same function, these regulators could serve
as a model to study homologues from the other species of
mycobacteria. These characterized orthologs may provide
clues for initiating detailed biochemical characterization
of M. smegmatis proteins. Many putative orthologs were
experimentally known like Rv0165c that is involved in
regulation of mce1 operon [6]; GntR, a transcriptional

repressor of gluconate operon [12]; YcbG, involved in utilization of D-glucarate and D-galactarate [26]; YcnF,
involved in utilization of gamma-aminobutyrate [27].
However, we did not find the orthologs for all M. smegmatis GntRs in other pathogenic species.
Our results help in extending the annotation of GntRs
encoded in the M. smegmatis genome. We have classified
putative M. smegmatis GntRs into four subfamilies.
Though in the present study, we have made an attempt to
explore M. smegmatis GntR regulators, this approach

could also be effectively employed to extend the GntR
family classification in other bacterial species as well.

Conclusion
This analysis has shown that M. smegmatis is equipped
with large number of GntR-like regulators, belonging to
four subfamilies. It further suggests that the GntR regulatory repertoires of M. smegmatis are far more complex than
in M. tuberculosis. Indeed, additional GntR regulators possibly control a subset of genes required for adapting to a
range of environmental conditions. One of the FadR-like
regulators shows additional secondary structural ele-

ments, suggesting a possible origin of a new group within
the FadR subfamily. Identified orthologs from M. smegmatis could serve as a model to decipher molecular regulation events taking place in the pathogenic mycobacteria.
Potential operator sites were also identified based on the
nucleotide recognition preferences of GntR-like regulators.

Methods
Selection of GntR-like Members
The sequences of M. smegmatis MC2 were downloaded
from the Institute for Genomic Research Comprehensive
Microbial Resource [28]. Apart from classified GntR regulators or proteins annotated as GntR-like regulator, other
putative GntRs from M. smegmatis proteome were selected
using GntR Pfam profile [29]. Among all predicted GntRs
one protein (MSMEG_3400) was discarded for this study
because of its unusual size (741 amino acid) and its annotation as glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit
A. Rest of the GntR regulators were retrieved from the
SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL sequence database as per their
Swiss-Prot ID (Table 1). Additionally published and
annotated genome sequences of M. tuberculosis, M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis, M. bovis, M. ulcerans, M. sp KMS, M.
sp. MCS, M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 and Bacillus subtilis were
downloaded from the NCBI ftp site [30].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/289

among the same subfamily [5], we utilised these clues to
scan the upstream sequences.
Reciprocal BLAST
Reciprocal BLAST hits are frequently utilized to identify
the orthologs in two species [39,40]. In this method we
searched for the best reciprocal BLAST hit for M. smegmatis
GntR proteins with M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. bovis,
Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium sp KMS, Mycobacterium sp. MCS, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 and B. subtilis.

Abbreviations
M. tuberculosis – Mycobacterium tuberculosis
M. bovis – Mycobacterium bovis
M. avium para. – Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
M. smegmatis – Mycobacterium smegmatis
M. ulcerans – Mycobacterium ulcerans
M. sp KMS – Mycobacterium sp. KMS
M. sp. MCS – Mycobacterium sp. MCS

Secondary structure prediction
The secondary structural features of all bacterial GntR regulators including the M. smegmatis GntRs were analyzed
(Table 1 and Table 2). Secondary structure predictions
were made using Jpred [31], SsPro [32] and 3DPSSM [33].
A consensus of all the secondary structure predictions was
considered for a better validity.
Multiple sequence alignments and Phylogenetic tree
construction
Multiple sequence alignment was generated with MULTIALIN [34]. Distances between aligned proteins were computed with the PROTDIST program using the Dayhoff
PAM matrix [35]. The FITCH program estimated phylogenies from distances in the matrix data using the Fitch-Margoliash algorithm [36]. The phylogenetic tree was drawn
using the TREEVIEW program with incorporation of bootstrap values that were obtained involving 1000 replicates
[37]. PROTDIST and FITCH programs are included in the
PHYLIP package developed by Felsenstein [38].

Operator site analysis
To study the upstream region of GntR-like regulators, we
considered sequences from 400 bases upstream to 50
bases downstream from the translation start site. As many
GntR regulators are reported to recognize palindromes
and also exhibit nucleotide recognition preferences
