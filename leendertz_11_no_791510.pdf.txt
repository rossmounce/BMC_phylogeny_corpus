Abstract
Background: Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIVs) are the precursors of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIVs)
which have lead to the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. By studying SIVs in wild primates we can better understand
the circulation of these viruses in their natural hosts and habitat, and perhaps identify factors that influence
susceptibility and transmission within and between various host species. We investigated the SIV status of wild
West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) which frequently hunt and consume the western red colobus
monkey (Piliocolobus badius badius), a species known to be infected to a high percentage with its specific SIV strain
(SIVwrc).
Results: Blood and plasma samples from 32 wild chimpanzees were tested with INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score kit to
detect cross-reactive antibodies to HIV antigens. Twenty-three of the samples were also tested for antibodies to
43 specific SIV and HIV lineages, including SIVwrc. Tissue samples from all but two chimpanzees were tested for SIV
by PCRs using generic SIV primers that detect all known primate lentiviruses as well as primers designed to
specifically detect SIVwrc. Seventeen of the chimpanzees showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity to the HIV
specific antigens in the INNO-LIA test; however no sample had antibodies to SIV or HIV strain - and lineage specific
antigens in the Luminex test. No SIV DNA was found in any of the samples.
Conclusions: We could not detect any conclusive trace of SIV infection from the red colobus monkeys in the
chimpanzees, despite high exposure to this virus through frequent hunting. The results of our study raise
interesting questions regarding the host-parasite relationship of SIVwrc and wild chimpanzees in their natural
habitat.

Background
Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIVs) are the direct
precursors of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIVs)
that have caused the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the human
population [1,2]. Although the conditions and circumstances of cross-species transmission of SIVs from primates to humans remain unknown, human exposure to

blood or other secretions of infected primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, sooty mangabeys) through hunting and
butchering of primate bushmeat, represents the most
plausible source for human infection [1-6]. Currently,
serological evidence of SIV infection has been shown for
more than 40 different primate species and SIV infection has been confirmed by sequence analysis in the
majority of them. The routes of SIV transmission within
and between host species are not fully known, however,
sexual contact and biting within one species, and biting

and blood-to-blood/mucosa contact (mainly observed in
hunter - prey relationships) among different species provide possible infection routes for the virus [7,8]. A high
genetic diversity is observed among the different SIVs,
but generally each primate species is infected with a
species-specific virus, which forms monophyletic
lineages in phylogenetic trees. There are many examples
of co-evolution between viruses and their hosts, but also
cross-species transmission and recombination between
distant SIVs seems not exceptional and one species can
even harbour two different SIVs. The chimpanzee SIV
(SIVcpz) is for example the result of cross-species transmissions as this virus is a mosaic of SIVs infecting other
African primates. The genome of the virus consists
partly of nucleic acid sequences from red capped mangabey SIV (SIVrcm), and partly of sequences from the
ancestor of SIVs infecting greater spot-nosed (SIVgsn),
mona (SIVmon) or mustached monkey (SIVmus) [9-11].
Chimpanzees are known to hunt monkeys for food, and
most probably, the recombination of these monkey
viruses occurred within chimpanzees and gave rise to
the common ancestor of today’s SIVcpz lineages, which
were subsequently transmitted to gorillas [5].
Despite the increasing number of SIV lineages that
have been described recently, our knowledge on SIV in
their natural hosts still remains limited. This is because
only few viruses have been characterized for each species and there is a major bias in geographical sampling.
By studying SIVs in wild primates in their natural habitat we can better understand the circulation and transmission of these viruses within and between different
primate species and perhaps identify factors that play a
role in viral adaptation to new hosts among different
primate species [12-14].
Of the four chimpanzee subspecies, only Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii in
Central/East Africa have been shown to harbour SIVcpz
[1,11,15-18]. The two West African chimpanzee subspecies, Pan troglodytes ellioti and Pan troglodytes verus,
appear to be free from SIVcpz infection. Therefore it is
hypothesized that this virus was introduced after the
evolutionary divergence and geographical separation of
the West African subspecies from the Central/East subspecies [11,15]. To test for SIVcpz in P. t. verus, more
than 1500 captive chimpanzees of this subspecies have
been screened for this virus. However, these chimpanzees do not represent the wild population since only
447 were wild-born and have mainly been captured as
infants, when they are less likely to be infected [15,19].
Therefore, it remains important to continue to collect
data on wild living chimpanzees from this subspecies.
To date, the only study on wild living P. t. verus has
been based on 28 faecal samples from a population in
Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire [16].

Page 2 of 10

The chimpanzees of Taï National Park have been under
human observation for more than 30 years [20] and are
known to hunt and consume monkeys frequently. When
hunting, the chimpanzees bite their prey and are sometimes bitten in return. The prey is consumed almost
entirely, which means that many bones are crushed
which could cause lesions in the oral cavity and result in
direct blood to blood contact. They hunt weekly throughout the year and usually every day in the hunting season
from September to November, and 80% of their prey
consist of western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus
badius badius) [20]. These red colobus monkeys harbour
high levels of their own species specific strain of SIV
(SIVwrc) as well as two other retroviruses; Simian T-cell
Lymphotrophic Virus type 1 (STLV-1wrc) and Simian
Foamy Virus (SFVwrc) [21-25].
Based on the SIVwrc prevalence data from this red colobus population (50 to 82% of the population is positive
[21]) and based on hunting data from the Taї Chimpanzee
Project [20], we estimate that adult male chimpanzees are
yearly exposed to approximately 45 kilograms of SIV
infected red colobus tissue. Therefore the chimpanzees are
exposed to high levels of SIVwrc through biting, blood-toblood/mucosa contact and ingestion of their prey. This
may provide possible infection routes for the virus,
although the modes of SIV transmission are not fully
known [7,8]. It has already been documented that the
other two retroviruses harboured by the red colobus monkeys in Taї National Park; STLV-1wrc and SFVwrc, are
transmitted to the Taї chimpanzee population (individuals
are included in the present study) most likely through
hunting and meat consumption [22,23]. Further, in chimpanzee subspecies where the chimpanzee lentivirus,
SIVcpz, has been documented, it is believed that this
mosaic virus was initially acquired through hunting and
consumption of infected monkey prey species [9-11]. Such
evidence of retroviral transmissions through hunting and
consumption of primates makes it possible that also
SIVwrc from red colobus monkeys can be transmitted to
the P. t. verus chimpanzees. The aim of this study was
therefore to investigate the SIV status of these wild chimpanzees, and to determine if transmission of SIVwrc
occurs from red colobus monkeys to the chimpanzees
through their natural and frequent hunting and meateating behaviour.

Adult chimpanzees are older than 15 years. For the INNO-LIA test result, only reactivity equal to, or stronger than, control cut off band (+/-) is included in the
table, others are marked as “-”. PCR testing was performed using SIVwrc specific primers as well as SIV generic primers (DR1/DR2) except for: 1) Sample tested
with SIVwrc PCR only, 2) Heart tested with SIVwrc PCR, lung tested with SIVgeneric PCR, 3) Sample became available late in the study, tested with SIVgeneric PCR
only, 4) Samples additionally tested by further PCRs as shown in Table 2.

younger (juveniles/infants) (8 males and 4 females).
Chimpanzees over ten years start to participate in
hunting but rarely have access to the meat until they
reach adulthood (15 years), while younger chimpanzees
have access to meat through their mothers [20].

Fourteen of the chimpanzees died of respiratory disease, six died of anthrax, two died of leopard attack,
one died of an intergroup fight, one died of heart failure, and four died of yet unknown causes [26-28;
C. Boesch and F. Leendertz, unpublished data].

Detection of antibodies to HIV/SIV

Samples from 17 of the 32 chimpanzees showed weak
but visible reactions to HIV-1/HIV-2 antigens in the
INNO-LIA HIV score test (Table 1; Figure 1). The
strongest reactions were seen for Leo, who scored equal
or stronger than 1+ for reactions to HIV-1 env proteins
(spg120 and gp41) in addition to a weak reaction to
p24, and Olduvai had cross-reactivity with HIV-1 and
HIV-2 antigens; equal to 1+ to spg120 and spg105 and
equal to cut-off control for gp41. Dorry scored equal to
1+ to gp41. Loukoum and Kady both had reactions
equal to cut-off control for gp41 and a faint reaction to
spg120. Kady had in addition a faint reaction to p17.
Twelve other chimpanzees (Sagu, Rafiki, Porthos,
Dartagnan, Candy, Vasco, Louise, Tita, Stranger, Gargantua, Akruba and Akwaba) had faint reactions, below
cut-off, to one or two of the following antigens: sgp120,
gp41, p24, p17 or sgp105. Considering all visible reactions together, there were more frequent reactions in
the adults/subadults than in the juvenile/infants (14/20
[70%] and 3/12 [25%], respectively) and more frequent
reactions to HIV-1 specific antibodies than to HIV-2
specific antibodies (reactions in 13 and three chimpanzees, respectively).
Using the Luminex test, each of the 23 samples were
negative against all the peptides representing the different SIV lineages, including SIV lineages described for
the primate species living in the region (SIVwrc, SIVolc,
SIVsmm, and SIVgsn, although SIV infection has not
yet been documented for this latter species in Taï) and
all known great ape SIVs (SIVcpzPtt SIVcpzPts, SIVgor)
and HIVs (HIV-1 group M, N and O and HIV-2) with a
signal to cut-off ratio below 1, in contrast to human,
monkey and chimpanzees positive controls.
PCR analyses

None of the samples from the chimpanzees were positive for any SIV strain; neither when using the generic
SIV PCR or the SIVwrc-specific PCR in pol. Also the
additional PCRs with SIVwrc specific primers amplifying

Page 4 of 10

pol, env and gag fragments of SIVwrc/SIVolc/SIVcol
sequences and primers amplifying gag and env regions
of SIVsmm were negative. The quality of all PCRs was
confirmed with positive control samples known to be
infected with the respective viruses.

Discussion
There are a number of interesting questions regarding
the transmission and natural history of SIV infections in
wild chimpanzees; an infection which entered into and
adapted to the human population and caused the global
AIDS pandemic [2]. It is presumed that the chimpanzees first acquired the infection through hunting and
consumption of monkey prey infected each with their
own species specific strains of SIV, which at some point
in time recombined and persisted in the chimpanzee
host [9-11]. To date, only this recombinant strain of
SIV, known as SIVcpz, has been detected in wild chimpanzees [29] and one question that arises is: How easily
are individual SIV strains from monkeys transmitted to
chimpanzee populations, irrespective of subspecies, and
do such infections persist?
We investigated this question through studying the natural hunter-prey relationship between wild chimpanzees
(P. t. verus) and highly SIV-infected red colobus monkeys
(P. b. badius) in the tropical rainforest of Taï National
Park in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa [21,30]. Eight other
diurnal monkey species live in this forest, including olive
colobus monkeys (Procolobus verus), great spot-nosed
monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and sooty mangabeys
(Cercocebus atys) which are also known to harbour species-specific SIVs: SIVolc, SIVgsn and SIVsmm, respectively [4,24,31]. However, according to more than 30 years
of behavioural observations, red colobus is the preferred
prey of the chimpanzees, whereas capture of greater spotnosed monkeys has not been observed and olive colobus
and sooty mangabeys are hunted extremely rarely. For
example, over a twelve year period, the chimpanzees were
seen to capture only six olive colobus and one sooty mangabey, while red colobus monkeys were captured 215

times [20]. Therefore, the exposure to these respective SIV
strains through hunting is very low in comparison to the
exposure to the SIVwrc strain carried by the red colobus
monkeys, which the chimpanzees are frequently in close
contact with. In addition, the prevalence of SIV in this
monkey species in Taï National Park is among one of the
highest documented in wild primates to date. Western red
colobus represent a substantial reservoir to which
chimpanzees, as well as human bushmeat hunters, are
exposed [21]. As an example, we calculated that Sagu, an
adult male in our study who was approximately 20 years
old when he died, could have eaten nearly 250 kilograms
of SIVwrc infected red colobus tissue in his life.
Despite the enormous infection pressure, we could not
detect SIVwrc (or any other strain of SIV) in blood and
tissue samples from the chimpanzees. Theoretically,
these chimpanzees could carry a SIV strain which is not
detectable by the PCR methods used in this study.
Alternatively, the level of SIVwrc viraemia is so low that
it can not be detected by the PCR methods used. This
could be in particular true for the 2 chimpanzees for
which only samples of muscle were available. However,
as no SIV-specific antibodies were detected with the
Luminex test it is more plausible that no persistent SIV
infection exists in these chimpanzees, although about
half of the chimpanzees showed some cross-reactions to
the HIV-antigens on the INNO-LIA HIVI/II Score kit.
The strongest reactions were observed in samples from
Leo and Olduvai, and their test results were HIV positive, according to the test manufacturer’s criteria (two
or more bands stronger than the minimum control
band [the +/- band]). For another chimpanzee, Dorry,
the result was indeterminate (one band stronger than
the minimum control band). For other chimpanzees
where weak reactions were seen, the results are considered negative for this HIV-test. It could be that there is
a difference in sensitivity and specificity of HIV antibody
detection of the Luminex and INNO-LIA tests, but it is
also likely that the reactivity to HIV antigens in the
INNO-LIA test was due to false positive cross-reaction
phenomena due to other causes than HIV/SIV infection,
such as observed in human HIV testing, especially in
Africa [32]. It has been shown that the INNO-LIA test
produces false positive results also in other primate species. In C. nictitans and C. cephus the estimated prevalence based on INNO-LIA results is higher than that
estimated using lineage specific antigens, and samples
from C. pogonias, L. albigena and C. agilis, that were
cross-reacting with some HIV antigens on the INNOLIA test, were negative with SIV lineage ELISAs and
PCR [33,34]. Therefore the reactivity we observed with
the INNO-LIA testing of the chimpanzee samples is
most likely a false positive non-specific cross-reactivity,
as no specific antibody reaction to SIVwrc, or any other

Page 5 of 10

known SIV and HIV strain, could be detected by SIV/
HIV lineage specific Luminex EIAs.
It was not surprising that the P. t. verus chimpanzees
were negative for SIVcpz, as this virus is believed to
have been introduced into two other, Central/East
chimpanzee subspecies (P. t. troglodytes and P. t.
schweinfurthii) after the evolutionary split from the
Western chimpanzee subspecies [15]. It was however
interesting that we could not detect any SIVwrc infection, considering the high exposure of this virus.
Our results show that there was no detectable specific
antibody reaction to, or infection with, SIV from red
colobus monkeys (or any other primates), despite high
and frequent exposure to the virus. This seemingly resistance of the chimpanzees to SIVwrc could be due to
immunological factors or mechanisms, or lack of these,
which are important for the recognition and subsequent
establishment or rejection of immunodeficiency viruses
[35-38]. HIV research is much focused on these
mechanisms, especially in certain individuals that remain
persistently seronegative despite known exposure to HIV
[39]. P. t. verus chimpanzees are however not totally
resistant to immunodeficiency virus infections in general, as susceptibility of captive chimpanzees of this subspecies to HIV, SIV, and co-infections of the two
viruses, has been documented [7]. In wild chimpanzees
(P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii) no other SIV
strain than the chimpanzee specific SIVcpz has been
detected to date [1,5,18], which suggests that the chimpanzees’ susceptibility to individual SIV strains from
monkeys is low. SIVcpz is a mosaic consisting partly of
SIV from red capped mangabey and partly of one of the
SIV strains in greater spot-nosed monkey, mona monkey or mustached monkey [9,10]. Only one of these species, the greater spot-nosed monkey (C. nictitants), lives
in the Taï forest. These monkeys are however rare in
this forest, the chimpanzees have never been observed
to hunt them, and there is also no evidence yet that
they are SIV infected, although only few animals have
been tested [20,31]. Interestingly and comparably to
what we report about the chimpanzees, no SIVwrc
infections have so far been documented in humans, who
also frequently hunt red colobus monkeys [40]. We
could also speculate whether the SIV status of the
chimpanzees in the Taï National Park would be different
had they hunted sooty mangabeys more frequently. The
sooty mangabey population from this national park harbours the sooty mangabey strain of SIV (SIVsmm)
which crossed the species barrier at least 8 times and
infected humans through bushmeat hunting, and then
became HIV-2 [4]. The genetic and physiologic similarities between humans and chimpanzees and also the
similar susceptibility to specific infections, suggest that
such transmission could also occur from sooty

Leendertz et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/24

mangabeys to chimpanzees, if an efficient transmission
pathway existed.

Conclusion
We could not detect any conclusive sign of infection
with SIVwrc in the P. t. verus chimpanzees in Taï
National Park, despite exposure of highly infected red
colobus. However, the frequent hunting and consumption of red colobus by the chimpanzees represents a
transmission pathway for other simian retroviruses
between these two host species. It remains to be determined which factors that seemingly protect these chimpanzees from infection, and whether the local human
population, frequently exposed to meat and organs of
the red colobus in this region, is free of SIVwrc infections. This knowledge on natural SIV infections in wild
primate populations might benefit human HIV/AIDS
research [13,29].
Methods
Samples

Wild chimpanzees (P. t. verus) in the tropical rainforest
of Taï National Park (5°15’-6°07’N, 7°25’-7°54’W), Côte
d’Ivoire, have been studied for behavioural research for
more than 30 years [20]. As part of the project’s veterinary monitoring, blood, muscle and samples from internal organs of 28 chimpanzee carcasses were collected
over the last 12 years [26]. Previous research has shown
that SIV can be detected in these types of tissues [21].
Table 1 summarises the chimpanzees name, social
group, sex, age, cause of death or sampling, and samples
available for antibody testing and PCRs. Samples from
3 chimpanzees bleeding after a violent encounter with
other chimpanzees were collected from the environment
and from 1 chimpanzee plasma was collected during
surgical intervention [26-28; F. Leendertz, unpublished
data]. Whole blood was collected from dead chimpanzees or from the environment from 31 chimpanzees; for
one chimpanzee serum from fresh blood was obtained.
The samples were transported on ice to the forest camp
and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were transported on dry ice to the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin,
and stored in -80°C until analyses. The work was performed under the permission of the according authorities from Côte d’Ivoire.
HIV antibody testing

We tested samples from 32 chimpanzees with the
INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score kit (Innogenetics, Gent,
Belgium). The test is a line immuno-assay which is a
commonly accepted and widely used confirmatory test
for HIV [32]. This test has also been commonly used to
detect HIV cross-reactive antibodies in non-human primates and identified a large number of new SIV

Page 6 of 10

lineages, but positive samples in non-human primates
should be confirmed with other more specific antibody
tests and/or PCRs as false positive reactions can occur
[33,34,41,42]. The test is designed for use on serum or
plasma samples. We dissolved whole blood, which was
preserved frozen since collection, with 0.2 ml of PBS
and used the supernatant for the test, as well as plasma
from one chimpanzee (blood centrifuged directly after
collection under anaesthesia). In the INNO-LIA HIV I/
II Score kit antigens from HIV-1 and HIV-2 are coated
as discrete lines on a nylon strip. There are five HIV-1
antigens: sgp120 and gp41, which detect specific antibodies to the HIV-1 envelope, and p31, p24, and p17,
which detect antibodies to HIV-1 pol and gag but may
also cross react with HIV-2. The antigens gp36 and
sgp105 are applied to detect antibodies to HIV-2 envelope proteins. For each antigen a coloured band develop
in proportion to the HIV-antibodies present in the sample. The strength of the reaction is read in comparison
to control bands on each strip; one for +/- cut off level,
one for 1+ reaction and one for 3+ reaction. Two samples (Leo and Olduvai) were retested in another batch
to confirm the results.
Specific SIV and HIV antibody testing

Out of the 32 chimpanzees, sufficient material for
further antibody testing was available from 23 chimpanzees. These samples were tested for antibodies
against a panel of 43 antigens consisting of 18 peptides
of the gp41 immunodominant region representing the
majority of all known HIV/SIV lineages, including
SIVwrc, and 25 peptides of the V3 region, including
the four groups of HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVcol and representatives of the different SIVcpz/gor lineages that circulate among chimpanzees and gorillas in central Africa
[17,33]. To that end, we used a newly developed assay
based on the Luminex technology. This new Luminex
test is comparable to SIV specific ELISAs [[33,43],
Ayouba et al., manuscript in preparation]. This test is
also an EIA, with the reaction support consisting of
calibrated polystyrene beads on which peptides are
covalently bound. Each peptide was immobilized on a
distinct bead set with a unique fluorescence wavelength. Once covalently linked to bead, the 43 different
peptides were mixed and distributed in wells of a
semi-permeable ELISA plate like support. Diluted
(100 μl, 1/200) antibodies-containing fluids (serum,
plasma or whole blood) were then added and incubated at room temperature for an hour with continuous shaking. After washing, 50 μl of a biotin-labelled
anti-human IgG was added in each well and the plate
was incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, while
shaking. After a second series of washing, R-phycoerythrine-labelled streptavidine was added for 10 minutes

and washed out afterwards. The complex consisting of
beads-peptide and the different additives was resuspended in buffer and read on a BioPlex-200 (BioRad,
Marnes la Coquette, France). With the Luminex technology, each bead set is sorted in a specific area of a 2
dimensional display, according to its wavelength of
fluorescence, like in flow cytometry. For each sample
and for each antigen, results are expressed as median
fluorescence intensity per 100 beads. Cut-off values
have been calculated for each of the 43 peptides from
their reactivities against 95 SIV negative non-human
primates’ samples and 50 HIV negative human plasma.
Samples presenting MFI higher than 500 against a
given were considered positive for that peptide.
PCR analyses

For PCRs the following tissues were used: spleen (n =
21), liver (n = 3), muscle (n = 2), heart and/or lung (n =
2), lymphnode (n = 1) and buffy-coat (n = 1). For 2
chimpanzees no material was available for PCR analyses.
DNA was extracted with the DNA tissue (or blood) kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples were tested with a
generic SIV PCR known to detect most primate Lentiviruses [44]. We used the primers DR1 (TRC AYA CAG
GRG CWG AYG A) and DR2 (AIA DRT CAT CCA
TRT AYT G) in the first round PCR and primers DR4
(GGI ATW CCI CAY CCD GCA GG) and DR5 (GGI
GAY CCY TTC CAY CCY TGH GG) in a nested PCR.
The cycling conditions were 94°C for 2 minutes, 30 ×
[94°C for 15 seconds, 50°C decreasing by 0.5°C each
cycle to 35°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute], 15 ×
[94°C for 15 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for
1 minute], 72°C for 5 minutes, then cooling to 4°C The
expected amplicon size was 194 bp. Samples were also
tested specifically for SIVwrc with a semi-nested PCR
with primers specifically designed for the detection of
pol regions of SIVs from the western red colobus/olive
colobus lineage (SIVwrc S1 [CATGGCAAATGGATTG
TACTCA], SIVwrc R2 [GTGCCATTGCTAATGCT
GTTTC], SIVwrc S3 [CCAAATTCTTGTTCT ATCCC
TAACC], and SIVwrc R3 [AGCAAAAATCATATCAG
CAGAAGAT]). These primers were based on SIVwrc
and SIVolc sequences published by Courgnaud and colleagues [24]. We used SIVwrc S1 and SIVwrc R2 in the
first round PCR, and SIVwrc S1 and SIVwrc R3
(expected amplicon size approximately 250 bp), and
SIVwrc S3 and SIVwrc R2 (expected amplicon size
approximately 300 bp) in two parallel semi-nested PCRs.
The cycler conditions were 94°C for 5 minutes, 30 ×
[94°C for 15 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30
seconds], 72°C for 10 minutes, then cooling to 4°C. The
PCRs included positive control samples from confirmed

Page 8 of 10

SIVwrc positive red colobus monkeys [21]. PCR products were visualised with gel electrophoresis. A subset
of samples (n = 4; Loukoum, Leonardo, Lefkas, Tita)
was also tested with additional primers targeting
SIVwrc/SIVolc/SIVcol in the gag, env and pol regions
and primers amplifying gag and env regions of SIVsmm
isolated from sooty mangabeys (Table 2).
Sequencing of any suspicious bands that appeared on
subsequent gel electrophoresis was performed in both
directions using the Sanger method, with all PCR products
being sequenced on both strands. Sequences were compared to the public database using NCBI BLAST [45].
