Abstract
Background: Protein translocation to the proper cellular destination may be guided by various
classes of sorting signals recognizable in the primary sequence. Detection in some genomes, but
not others, may reveal sorting system components by comparison of the phylogenetic profile of
the class of sorting signal to that of various protein families.
Results: We describe a short C-terminal homology domain, sporadically distributed in bacteria,
with several key characteristics of protein sorting signals. The domain includes a near-invariant
motif Pro-Glu-Pro (PEP). This possible recognition or processing site is followed by a predicted
transmembrane helix and a cluster rich in basic amino acids. We designate this domain PEPCTERM. It tends to occur multiple times in a genome if it occurs at all, with a median count of eight
instances; Verrucomicrobium spinosum has sixty-five. PEP-CTERM-containing proteins generally
contain an N-terminal signal peptide and exhibit high diversity and little homology to known
proteins. All bacteria with PEP-CTERM have both an outer membrane and exopolysaccharide (EPS)
production genes. By a simple heuristic for screening phylogenetic profiles in the absence of preformed protein families, we discovered that a homolog of the membrane protein EpsH
(exopolysaccharide locus protein H) occurs in a species when PEP-CTERM domains are found. The
EpsH family contains invariant residues consistent with a transpeptidase function. Most PEPCTERM proteins are encoded by single-gene operons preceded by large intergenic regions. In the
Proteobacteria, most of these upstream regions share a DNA sequence, a probable cis-regulatory
site that contains a sigma-54 binding motif. The phylogenetic profile for this DNA sequence exactly
matches that of three proteins: a sigma-54-interacting response regulator (PrsR), a transmembrane
histidine kinase (PrsK), and a TPR protein (PrsT).
Conclusion: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PEP-CTERM and EpsH form a
protein export sorting system, analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system of Gram-positive bacteria,
and correlated to EPS expression. It occurs preferentially in bacteria from sediments, soils, and
biofilms. The novel method that led to these findings, partial phylogenetic profiling, requires neither
global sequence clustering nor arbitrary similarity cutoffs and appears to be a rapid, effective
alternative to other profiling methods.

Background
Targeting signals in bacterial proteins often involve short,
well-conserved motifs adjacent to predicted transmembrane helices. The lipoprotein signal sequence, the type IV
pilin-like cleavage/methylation signal sequence, the twinarginine transport (TAT) signal sequence, and the YSIRKtype signal sequence of some Firmicutes all represent
classes of N-terminal signal sequence in which specific
conserved residues are known or presumed [1-6] to interact with specific cellular machinery. The carboxyl-terminal LPXTG signal for targeting to the cell wall in Grampositive bacteria and processing by sortase [7] is described
as part of a larger sequence region with a transmembrane
segment [8]. It appears that in some species multiple sortases act preferentially on different subclasses of LPXTGlike signals [9,10]. The processing by sortase includes proteolysis between the Thr and Gly residues of the LPXTG
sequence [11] mediated by a catalytic triad composed of
arginine, histidine and a cysteine nucleophile [12], followed by transfer of the C-terminal peptide to the cell wall
precursor lipid II [13]. It is a reasonable hypothesis that
other, to date undescribed, protein sorting systems exist in
prokaryotes, particularly in Gram-negative species, which
contain outer membranes.
Phylogenetic profiling is a methodology that was developed to determine the functional connections between
protein homology families based on co-occurrence in
multiple genomes [14]. The method depends on the
assumption that genes with related functions will be
retained together and, in the case of lateral gene transfer,
transmitted together in order to preserve the biological
process that they commonly serve. As initially construed,
profiling requires a query profile (a list of genomes in
which the "known" protein occurs), subject profiles for all
other protein families, and a method for scoring the similarity between the query and subject profiles. One limitation of this methodology lies in the generation of the
proper subject profiles. In the ideal scenario these would
correspond to protein families, each with the property
that all members are descended from a common ancestor
and share a common function, where more distantly
related proteins differ in function. Such protein families
differ from ortholog families in two ways, namely that
conserved protein function is a defining characteristic of
the family and that lateral gene transfer may be part of its
evolutionary history. We have suggested the term, 'equivalog'[15] for any such set of functionally conserved proteins, but note that equivalog families are built to reflect
published characterizations and are not available for all
proteins.
Clusters of genes (profiles) have been generated based on
arbitrary BLAST similarity scores [14], graphs of bi-directional best (BLAST) hits [16,17], hierarchical clustering of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/29

BLAST scores [18], curated ortholog families [19], and
PSI-BLAST-generated families [20]. In all cases, the parameters are set in an ad hoc manner based on the observation
of acceptable behavior for known orthologous families.
Difficulties necessarily arise from the circumstance of clusters that are too small (several related clusters have the
same function) or too large (clusters include genes of heterogeneous function). This variable granularity in the similarity-to-function relationship among protein families
appears to be inherent to the evolution of protein
sequences. The global generation of clusters is often a
computationally intense process, and may be made more
so by the necessity of recalculating the clusters based on
modified parameters for a particular application. In principle, correctly built protein families are highly preferable
to mere sorted lists of pairwise matches for performing
phylogenetic profiling, but there may be no way to know
in advance how to set the granularity of the protein clustering method correctly to solve a particular biological
problem.
We describe below a simple but powerful heuristic for
scanning the set of all proteins from a test genome against
a phylogenetic profile by examining their respective
ordered lists of best BLAST hits from other genomes. An
optimal cutoff is chosen separately for each hits list, at the
point where the number of genomes encountered so far
marked YES in the profile, vs the number marked NO,
shows the greatest statistical significance according to the
binomial distribution. This method may rapidly identify
proteins of interest without any explicit construction of
protein families. The method may be repeated for different test genomes in order to see if members of the same
protein families consistently emerge as the top match to
the profile, or amongst the top matches.
The heuristic we describe is not forced to evaluate the full
phylogenetic profile. Rather, it performs an exploration of
a section of the profile shown to be relevant by pairwise
sequence similarity, that is, for those genomes where proteins score above the BLAST match self-optimizing cutoff
score; we suggest 'partial phylogenetic profiling' as a name
for this method. A phylogenetic profile across the set of
complete genomes of a protein family, or of a genome
property, may be imagined as a 'bar code'; one complete
bar code can be compared to another, and the best correspondence found. The metaphor for our method is bar
codes partially illuminated by a beam of light with an
adjustable width; the width chosen is that which gives the
most significant match of the illuminated section to the
corresponding portion of the reference profile. We do not
claim our method is better than other profiling techniques, but rather that it may work particularly well for
certain classes of problem. When precomputed all-vs-all
BLAST search results are available, our heuristic can run

about one minute, and in our hands has produced meaningful results.
Hidden Markov Models representing the PEP-CTERM
domain, EpsH and other relevant protein families
described below have been deposited in the TIGRFAMs
library [21] and have been combined to form a Genome
Property (GenProp0326) [22] which is accessible through
the Comprehensive Microbial Resource [23].

Results and discussion
PEP-CTERM domain proteins
We first encountered PEP-CTERM as a novel C-terminal
homology domain among a set of predicted protein
sequences of Verrucomicrobium spinosum (N. Ward, unpublished results), where all sequence regions with matches
by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for previously
defined protein families had been removed. We expanded
this family by iteratively searching a set of all proteins
from completed prokaryotic genomes with the current

version of the HMM, aligning the set of matching
sequences, building an HMM from the alignment, and
starting again with a new sequence search. By this
approach, we developed a model that detects over 300
sequences from 19 different genomes, out of 280
genomes searched. Our model has been deposited in the
TIGRFAMs database [21] as TIGR02595. In 16 out of 19
genomes, the number of matches to the model was 4 or
greater (Table 1).
Sequence similarity among some member proteins was
encountered previously by Studholme, et al. [24] during a
cataloguing of fifteen novel paralogous families with ten
or more members in Rhodopirellula baltica. Their interpretation, reflected in model PF07589 in the Pfam database
[25,26], is a 38 amino-acid region of unknown function
whose length would require the sequence to continue past
the stop codon for many instances of the PEP-CTERM
region as we define it. It also continues upstream into
regions of homology between homologous protein pairs

in which one has, but the other lacks, the PEP-CTERM
domain; comparing protein architecture in this way
argues for interpretation of PEP-CTERM as module only
about 24 amino acids in length. A subset of proteins that
match TIGR02595, amounting to 22% of instances we
detect, are recognized by the Pfam HMM PF07589. The
model PF07589 does not find the set from V. spinosum.
PEP-CTERM domains occur only in bacteria that possess
an inner membrane, a periplasm, an outer membrane,
and a complement of genes that suggests the synthesis of
exopolysaccharide (see below). LPXTG domains occur
almost exclusively in bacteria with a Gram-positive type
cell envelope, that is, with a single cellular membrane outside of which is a cell wall. Figure 1 shows sequence logos
[27] calculated from the seed alignments (columns with
>50% gaps removed) for our models TIGR02595, for the
PEP-CTERM domain, and TIGR01167, for the LPXTG
domain. These logos show several features in common.
Each shows a conserved motif, followed by a hydrophobic
stretch likely to act as a transmembrane alpha helix, followed by a cluster of basic residues. Basic clusters adjacent
to a transmembrane helix typically mark the cytosolic side

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/29

of the bacterial inner membrane according to the "positive inside rule" [28,29]. Predictions of transmembrane
helices and membrane topology of multiple PEP-CTERM
proteins using MEMSAT3 [30] support this proposition,
locating the conserved PEP motif precisely at the periplasm-membrane interface (data not shown).
We aligned all detected PEP-CTERM domains according
to TIGR02595 and grouped related sequences by constructing a neighbor-joining tree in the alignment viewer
Belvu according to their Scoredist sequence distances [31].
Inspection of the tree (data not shown) shows a clade of 9
PEP-CTERM domains from Colwellia psychreythraea 34H
all more closely related to each other than to any instance
of the domain from other species. Other clades are similarly rich in just one or two species, including one of 47
sequences where 44 belong to V. spinosum, one of 20
where 17 belong to Nitrospira multiformis ATCC 25196
and the rest to Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259, and
one of 39 where all belong to Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 or Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. This pattern suggests rapid
paralogous family expansion of the PEP-CTERM domain
in certain lineages.

The last two species mentioned above are a pair of Cyanobacteria so closely related that their RecA proteins, for
example, show 98% sequence identity. Examining levels
of sequence identity for full-length proteins rather than
just the PEP-CTERM domain regions shows which
sequence pairs are bidirectional best matches and putative
orthologs. Among the 83 PEP-CTERM proteins of Nostoc
and Anabaena, 27 pairs of putative orthologs were found,
but also 29 proteins unique to one or the other. An HMM
search against the translations into all six reading frames
of the full genomic sequence showed that there was no
fault in the identification of PEP-CTERM genes, as all
genes had been properly predicted. The large number
lacking apparent orthologs from one species to the other
seems to point instead to frequent gene duplication and
gene loss. Similar patterns are seen for other pairs of PEPCTERM-positive species of the same genus. We conclude
that the PEP-CTERM tail region marks some of the most
rapidly evolving protein sets in their respective genomes.

in sequence than those examples in more typical locations
(data not shown). An illustration of the PEP-CTERM
region as a C-terminal domain appended to proteins
whose homologs lack the domain is shown in Figure 2.
These enzyme homologs are rare among PEP-CTERMcontaining proteins. Typically PEP-CTERM proteins are
observed to have no discernable homology to any other
protein outside of the PEP-CTERM domain itself. Fewer
than 10% match any protein family in Pfam. It was notable, however, that most PEP-CTERM containing proteins
contained N-terminal signal peptide regions as predicted
by SignalP 3.0 [32] with 95% confidence or higher. Due
to the noted lack of homology we hypothesized that prediction of the proper start sites would have been problematic and many signal peptide sites may have been missed.
Re-analysis of start site predictions for those proteins lacking signal peptides in completed genomes suggests that
97% of PEP-CTERM proteins also include a SignalP site
(data not shown).

The PEP-CTERM sequences we detect are found near the
extreme C-termini of their respective proteins. The twentyfour residue sequence regions described by the HMM end
close to the extreme C-terminus of each protein, with 87%
of proteins having fewer than ten additional residues; the
median is three. The very few with dramatically longer
tails may represent non-functional examples, as those
with atypical locations within proteins tend to vary more

Excepting one three-member family of predicted integral
membrane proteins, all members lack predicted transmembrane regions between the signal peptide region and
the PEP-CTERM region. For each genome, we analyzed
the amino-acid composition of all PEP-CTERM member
proteins from the N-terminus to the beginning of the PEPCTERM domain. Amino-acid frequencies for this protein
cohort in each genome were compared to the average

across all predicted proteins sequences in that genome
(data not shown). The results consistently showed fewer
basic residues, very low levels of Cys (0.4% +/- 0.2%), and
substantial increases in the frequencies of Thr (from 5.4%
+/- 0.4% to 8.8% +/- 1.4%), Ser (from 5.9% +/- 0.7% to
8.8% +/- 1.2%), and Asn (from 3.3% +/- 0.8% to 5.8% +/
- 1.6%). We find it suggestive that these are the three typical amino acids for carbohydrate linkage in most known
glycoproteins. A similar analysis for LPXTG proteins,
which are known to be targeted to the cell surface, shows
essentially the same pattern, suggesting a similar extracellular fate for PEP-CTERM proteins.
The phylogenetic distribution of PEP-CTERM-positive
species is sporadic and somewhat sparse, being found
broadly among Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrumicrobiae, and the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta divisions

of the Proteobacteria (Figure 3). All appear to be species
of interest as environmental organisms and most if not all
are associated with aquatic sediments and soils; none is
reported as an animal pathogen. Three lineages that contain no example are the Archaea, the Firmicutes (low-GC
Gram-positive), and the Actinomycetes (high-GC Grampositive), which share the property of lacking both periplasm and outer membrane. As seen in Table 1, the PEPCTERM domain count in a genome ranges from 1 to 65,
with a median of 8 and a mean of over 14. Two species
have two or fewer identified instances; the rest have four
or more. The sporadic distribution of genomes with large
numbers of PEP-CTERM regions, against a background of
so many genomes with none at all, and so few genomes
with just one or two, suggests to us that an abundance of
PEP-CTERM modules marks the presence of some
unknown biological system. The preponderance of signal

peptide domains, the general lack of homology and the
distinctive amino-acid distribution suggests to us that
these proteins are destined for transport at least to the
periplasm and possibly into or across the outer membrane. Finally, the highly conserved PEP motif and its
position at the C-terminus suggest to us an interaction
with some specific protein, analogous to the relationship
in Gram-positive bacteria between LPXTG-like cell wall
targeting sequences and sortases.

PEP-CTERM regions and 0 (NO) to all genomes with
none. The two genomes with only one or two matching
sequences are omitted from the profile entirely, for two
reasons. First, a single sequence instance may score above
the assigned cutoff score for our model simply because
some error is intrinsic to any search method applied to
very short sequence regions. Second, any biological system not required for viability may be lost, and single or
low-scoring PEP-CTERM regions may be remnants of a
non-functional system.

For fourteen genomes containing more than two PEPCTERM proteins, we had pre-computed all-vs-all search
results available to us through the CMR (Table 1) [23]. We
tested each of the fourteen, in turn, as a reference genome
for our method to find the proteins that best fit a phylogenetic profile (see methods, Table 2). For all fourteen
genomes, the top candidate was a homolog of the Methylobacillus sp. 12S protein EpsH [33]. EpsH is a putative
membrane protein based on its eight predicted transmembrane segments and is found within a large exopolysaccharide biosynthesis locus. We aligned these candidate
sequences from complete genomes, constructed an HMM,
performed a new search, and proceeded iteratively, resulting in TIGR02602. It identifies one or two members in
every genome marked YES in the original profile and none
in all genomes marked NO. This model also identifies a
protein in Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170, a species
omitted from the phylogenetic profile because we detect
only one PEP-CTERM protein. All EpsH homologs identified by this model appear to have at least eight transmembrane helices as detected by TmHMM [34]. 90% of these
proteins are found in the vicinity of exopolysaccharide
biosynthesis associated genes. Despite this correlation,
the disruption of EpsH in Methylobacillus sp. 12S proved
not to affect production of methanolan, an exopolysaccharide whose synthesis depends instead on several
neighboring genes [33]. According to Drummelsmith and
Whitfield [35], Wzx and Wzy-related proteins with flippase activity show very low levels of sequence similarity
but do show similarity in hydropathy profiles. Yoshida, et

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/29

al. apply this principle to suggest that EpsH may be a flippase or a polymerase [33]. Its actual function was not
determined.
We noted a single species, Chlorobium tepidum, in which
the PEP-CTERM domain occurs twice, while no EpsH
homolog protein is found. We note that Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough has a single plasmid with 152
reported genes [36], including a type III secretion system,
a nitrogen fixation system, a CRISPR system [37], and a
large tandem cluster of genes associated with exopolysaccharide biosynthesis including an EpsH homolog. Four of
five PEP-CTERM proteins are found on the plasmid while
a fifth is chromosomal. Loss of the plasmid would lead to
a situation as in Chlorobium tepidum: no EpsH protein and
only a small number (in this case one rather than two) of
PEP-CTERM sequences. The nitrogen fixation plasmid is,
in fact, easily cured in laboratory cultivation [36]; this
finding supports the validity of assigning the YES state
only to species with more than two PEP-CTERM instances
in the PEP-CTERM phylogenetic profile. This threshold
reduces noise from degenerate systems and/or false-positive detection of PEP-CTERM domains.
EpsH proteins do not themselves contain the PEP-CTERM
domain. A number do, however contain an additional
conserved C-terminal region which proves homologous
to EpsI, encoded by the gene immediately downstream
from EpsH in Methylobacillus sp. 12S. A model describing
EpsI and homologous regions fused with or adjacent to
other 8TM proteins has been built and deposited in the
TIGRFAMs collection as TIGR02914. EpsI has no known
function.
The epsH homolog gene nearly always is found among
extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes. This finding suggests to us a role of EpsH in processing PEP-CTERM
proteins to an extracellular location. PEP-CTERM proteins
could not both remain anchored to the inner membrane
by the C-terminal transmembrane domain and basic cluster, and be exported like other components of exopolysaccharide. Cleavage of the anchoring sequence, analogous
to the first step in the processing of LPXTG proteins by sortases, seems likely. LPXTG proteins are cleaved and
become bound, covalently but transiently, to the active
site cysteine of sortase [11]. Processing is completed when
the LPXTG protein is attached covalently through an
amide bond at its new carboxyl terminus to a peptidoglycan precursor, lipid II [13]. A histidine and an arginine,
positioned in the folded protein near the active site
cysteine [12], are both indispensable to function. The His,
Cys, Arg catalytic triad residues are the only ones absolutely conserved in all sortases. The greatest local sequence
conservation in a sortase multiple sequence alignment is
centered on the active site Cys.

The EpsH family is not homologous to sortases. EpsH proteins are highly hydrophobic with at least eight predicted
transmembrane helices. In an alignment of all EpsH
homologs, we found only six perfectly conserved residues,
in three motifs with two conserved residues apiece. It has
been shown from the analysis of multiple alignments and
crystal structures that there is a high correlation between
clusters of the most highly conserved residues in an alignment and functional sites; this relationship has been
observed to be strongest for enzyme catalytic sites, rather
than protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction sites,
and to apply best when the overall conservation observed
in the alignment is low [38]. This concept has been
applied successfully to identify critical functional residues
for the CAAX prenyl protease [39], a protein-sorting and
modification enzyme useful for comparison because it,
like EpsH, has multiple transmembrane segments. Low
sequence identity is found for the EpsH family, with an
overall percent identity of only 25 (particularly low considering its hydrophobic nature). The most highly conserved region in the whole alignment is centered on a Cys
residue in the motif Cys-Xaa-Gly (bold type indicates residues found in the catalytic triad of sortases). Having its
strongest local sequence conservation centered on an
invariant Cys is a property the EpsH family shares with the
sortases. Two other motifs with the remaining invariant

residues follow downstream: Asn-Xaa-Xaa-Arg and HisXaa-Xaa-Xaa-Gly. The membrane topology algorithm
MEMSAT3 [30], used through the PSIPRED server [40],
predicts that each residue of this putative catalytic triad
(Cys, Arg, His) is located proximal to the outer surface of
the membrane near the ends of three consecutive transmembrane helices (Figure 4). Notably, the outer surface
of the inner membrane is the predicted location of the
PEP motif, which is followed by a transmembrane helix
and its cytoplasmic positively-charged anchor (Figure 1a).
These observations suggest that the EpsH family protein
may act in a manner mechanistically similar to sortase,
with cleavage of the PEP-CTERM motif and transient
attachment to an active site Cys, followed by further sorting and processing steps (Figure 4).
The strongly hydrophobic nature of EpsH family proteins
seems more reminiscent of transporters than of proteases,
but there is abundant precedent for protein sorting processes that depend on proteolytic cleavage and other
processing by highly hydrophobic proteins. Proteins in
eukaryotes with the CAAX motif, as found at the C terminus of Ras and other GTPases, are processed by isoprenylation, cleavage of the C-terminal tripeptide, and
methylation of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl group [39].

Proposed model of PEP-CTERM domain protein processing by EpsH
Proposed model of PEP-CTERM domain protein processing by EpsH. A) The PEP-CERM domain protein (orange) first is targeted to the inner membrane by its N-terminal signal peptide. Cleavage of the signal peptide by signal peptidase leaves the protein anchored by its C-terminal transmembrane helix. The PEP motif is predicted to lie at the membrane-periplasm interface
where it is recognized by and binds to EpsH (green) adjacent to a catalytic triad on its periplasmic surface. Both the PEPCTERM domain and EpsH are oriented in the membrane by their asymmetrical positive charge distribution (red). The cysteine
sulfur nucleophile (purple) cleaves the bound PEP motif at an unspecified location. B) The covalently linked protein is subsequently transferred to an unknown periplasmic nucleophile (blue), likely destined to cross the outer membrane for incorporation into the exopolysaccharide layer.

Prot: P47154) and 2 (SwissProt: Q9Y256), active in this
suite of modifications and essential for achieving correct
localization of their targets, are highly hydrophobic integral membrane proteins. Pfam model PF02517 describes
a domain shared by members of the CAAX prenyl protease
family, although it is not clear which activity is associated
with the domain described. In fact, we find four examples
of fusion proteins with both EpsH-like and CAAX prenyl
protease-like domains. By the principle of protein
sequence Rosetta Stones [41], these fusions suggest a functional relationship between their respective domains and
may further support a proposed role for EpsH homologs
in the processing and sorting of PEP-CTERM proteins.
The perfect correlation to the phylogenetic profile of PEPCTERM families makes details of the scoring heuristic
rather unimportant for identifying EpsH, as any reasonable scoring scheme would agree. However, the ranked list
of runners-up by our scoring method is informative. For
eight of fourteen genomes tested against the PEP-CTERM
profile, the list of all proteins with scores better than the
arbitrarily selected cutoff of 6 (-logP, see Methods) is
dominated by proteins encoded near on the chromosome
to the EpsH member and/or tend to be implicated, by
homology to better-characterized proteins, in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis (see, for instance, example 2 in Table
2). These include multiple examples of proteins identified
by Pfam models PF00534 (glycosyl transferase, group 1),
PF01522 (polysaccharide deacetylase), PF02706 (chain
length determinant protein), and PF02397 (bacterial
sugar transferase). Each of these other proteins, however,
also shows strong sequence similarity to numbers of proteins found in genomes that lack PEP-CTERM modules.
Only the EpsH family lacks detectable homologs in PEPCTERM-negative species. Nevertheless, within the profile,
members of these more weakly correlated gene families
are almost invariably located in the vicinity of the EpsH
homolog.
Conserved DNA sequence upstream of PEP-CTERM
domain proteins in proteobacteria
We noted that greater than 65% of PEP-CTERM proteins
appear to belong to single-gene operons and to have large
(greater than 200 nucleotides) regions of non-coding
DNA upstream of the start codon. Following our investigation of PEP-CTERM gene start sites, it became clear that
this was not an artifact of poor start site prediction. A
review of these regions similarly failed to identify any reasonable open reading frames that might have been missed
by gene calling.

We searched for a conserved DNA sequence that could signify a regulatory site using a number of methods. The
upstream regions of PEP-CTERM genes from genomes
such as A. variabilis, N. multiformis and C. psychrerythraea,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/29

which have many such regions, were individually pooled
for analysis. The program glam [42], which uses simulated
annealing to find gapless local alignments in multiple
sequences, produced an alignment in which a motif TTTACA appeared in a subset of regions, but only in the proteobacterial genomes. By exploring larger sequence
regions, adding and removing sequences, and repeating
rounds of search and realignment, we found the TTTACA
sequence to be the 3'-end of a 17 nucleotide motif, motif
1. Motif 1 is sometimes repeated, as seen in the region
before Rru_A3095, the only PEP-CTERM gene in R.
rubrum. Motif 1, or the most 3' copy if repeated, is followed by a spacer region an average 62.8 nucleotides long
(S.D. = 10.6, max = 92, min = 32), and then a different 17
nucleotide motif, motif 2. Sequence logos for these two
motifs are shown in Figure 5.
For PEP-CTERM proteins preceded by such a DNA
sequence region, the average distance from the end of
motif 2 to the start codon is 71 nucleotides (S.D. = 38.5,
max = -221, min = -23). Motif 2 conforms to the binding
site consensus, -24(GG)/-12(GC), of sigma-54, the
enhancer-dependent RNA polymerase sigma factor [43].
Regulation by the enhancer-dependent sigma factor
allows for very tight regulation of expression, absolutely
dependent on the enhancer binding protein, although at
the cost of requiring longer stretches of intergenic DNA
[44]. Motif 1 would therefore be the binding site for a cognate activator, a protein expected to bind both DNA and
sigma-54.
We detected examples of this putative cis-regulatory
sequence upstream of 99 of the 167 PEP-CTERM genes of
proteobacteria. In some PEP-CTERM-positive genomes,
we found a few additional sites upstream of other genes,
but never within a protein-coding region. The few highscoring matches from PEP-CTERM-negative genomes may
all be false-positives, as most lie within protein-coding
regions of those genomes and are unlikely to represent cisregulatory elements.
Among the PEP-CTERM domain-containing species we
discuss, it is only the members of the Proteobacteria that
share these conserved DNA motifs. Among these proteobacterial, PEP-CTERM positive genomes, the observation
of this motif is universal. This set of 13 Proteobacterial
species comprises a new phylogenetic profile. The principle of using the phylogenetic profile of a DNA cis-regulatory site to identify a DNA-binding protein was
demonstrated in the case of the NrdR-box associated with
ribonucleotide reductase genes; leading to the identification of the NrdR-box binding protein [45]. We again
applied our heuristic method for searching the gene list
for matches to the profile, and again found that the set of
candidate proteins we identified was independent of

which genome was used as the starting point in the search.
These identifications enabled us to construct seed alignments and HMMs to find all members of each family.
We found a set of three proteins that match the cis-regulatory site phylogenetic profile. The first is a predicted DNAbinding protein of the Fis family, with a sigma-54 interaction domain, as expected, plus a response regulator
receiver domain. Its overall domain architecture identifies
it as an enhancer-binding protein of the NtrC-like family
[46]. The second is a transmembrane protein with a histidine kinase domain and an additional, uncharacterized
domain. The third is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein with a lipoprotein signal sequence. TPR domains participate in protein-protein interactions and may act as
adaptors to guide protein covalent modifications, including a suggestive example in eukaryotes of an O-linked Nacetylglucosamine transferase that acts on a family of
interacting proteins [47]. The histidine kinase and
response regulator genes are usually tandem (12/13) and
always at least close to each other. They are often in tandem with the TPR gene as well (4/13), sometimes near or
adjacent to the EpsH gene (3/13), and usually near glyco-

syltransferases and other exopolysaccharide markers (12/
13, Figure 6). We suggest the names (and associated gene
symbols): PEP-CTERM regulatory system kinase (PrsK),
response regulator (PrsR) and TPR domain protein (PrsT)
for these genes (Table 1).
It is worth noting that methods of phylogenetic profiling
based on homology clusters such as COGs, KEGG
orthologs or PSI-BLAST would have made the discovery of
these proteins far more difficult, if not impossible. PrsR,
for instance, falls within COG2204 [16] as well as KEGG
ortholog family KO2481 [19], each of which include
sequences from a wide range of organisms outside the
profile of interest. Similarly, use of PSI-BLAST draws over
a thousand sequences into a cluster, the vast majority of
which are response regulators with a similar architecture
to, but distinct from PrsR.
Association of the PEP-CTERM system with a particular
biological niche
The association of PEP-CTERM system components with
exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and transport genes must
be considered against the fact that exopolysaccharide is

Community of biofilms on a degrading whale carcass
[50], the Yellowstone Hot Spring microbial mats (Heidelberg & Ward, unpublished data) and the surface farm soil
sample from Waseca County, Minnesota [50]. Each nucleotide dataset was scanned (in each of the six possible
translation frames) with the HMM for the PEP-CTERM
domain (TIGR02595). This was compared to a similar
analysis of all of the nucleotide data in the CMR representing a wide-ranging set of environments. The planktonic
and acid-extremophilic environments were markedly
lacking in PEP-CTERM genes, while those associated with
biofilms and soils were relatively enriched (Table 3). In
line with this observation, unfinished genome projects
registered at the Genome Projects site were scanned for
the keyword substrings "sediment," "biofilm," and "soil"
and, where nucleotide data was available, were scanned
for PEP-CTERM genes. A number of additional PEPCTERM positive organisms were identified in this way
(Table 4).

Conclusion
We have now identified over 300 instances of a 24-aminoacid sequence region that we designate PEP-CTERM,
which has three distinctive sequence features (Figure 1a).
First, at the N-terminal end of the region, is a well-conserved segment where the tripeptide motif Pro-Glu-Pro
(PEP) is nearly invariant. Next, a 14-residue strongly
hydrophobic stretch forms a probable transmembrane
(TM) helix. Last is a strongly basic five-residue region Cterminal to the TM helix likely to act as a cytoplasmic
anchor.
The PEP-CTERM region is found, virtually without exception, near the protein C-terminus. Among the many
sequenced genomes, instances are found only in bacteria
that possess both inner and outer membranes. The majority of bacteria have no examples of PEP-CTERM, but those
which do usually have many, averaging greater than 10.
PEP-CTERM regions generally show much stronger
sequence similarity within each species than between species, consistent with recent paralogous expansion in each
lineage of PEP-CTERM as a modular domain. PEPCTERM-family proteins have dramatically fewer recognizable homology domains on average, excepting the mod-

ule itself, than do other proteins found in the same
genome.
As the PEP-CTERM domain is probably too small to carry
enzymatic activity or direct binding to a small molecule,
the conservation of the nearly invariant Pro-Glu-Pro motif
most likely reflects a physical interaction with another
protein. Only the EpsH family has the appropriate profile
to be the interacting partner. The hydrophobic nature of
EpsH marks it as a probable membrane protein. Nearly all
PEP-CTERM proteins have predicted signal peptides, and
so would cross the inner membrane during translation
concomitant with the cleavage of the signal peptide. At
this point, we hypothesize the PEP-CTERM tail mediates
an interaction with the EpsH family protein, which may
entail further protein trafficking (Figure 4). A role in sorting for a C-terminal domain with a distinctive motif and
a transmembrane segment is clearly possible, as seen for
the LPXTG signal for cell wall targeting in Gram-positive
bacteria. PEP-CTERM and LPXTG-mediated processes
would differ, as the cell envelopes of Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria differ, however, the similarity of
the observed triad of conserved residues in EpsH and sortase suggests that, like sortase, EpsH may be involved in
the proteolysis (transpeptidation) of the associated proteins. LPXTG proteins do not then remain embedded in
the plasma membrane, but are rather targeted to the cell
wall. We propose, by analogy, those PEP-CTERM proteins,
after proteolysis are targeted to, and possibly through the
outer membrane. All PEP-CTERM-positive species have an
outer membrane, just as all LPXTG-positive species have a
cell wall. The physical properties of the two analogous
domains are so similar that LPXTG domains show up
among the top-scoring noise hits to PEP-CTERM. The
small size of the domain suggests its purpose is to mark
proteins that have it. The largely conserved gene neighborhood of the EpsH family proteins points to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and export, yet mutational studies
have shown that EpsH did not act on the exopolysaccharide itself. PEP-CTERM proteins appear to be disproportionally present in organisms living in biological niches
characterized by substrates such as soils, sediments and
biofilms where surface contact is likely to important. At
this time, however, no experimental evidence exists con-

cerning the cellular localization of any PEP-CTERM-containing protein.
The enhancer-dependent sigma factor binding site linked
to proteobacterial PEP-CTERM genes is phylogenetically
correlated to a transmembrane histidine kinase, which
suggests an interaction with, and perhaps a contribution
to, the external milieu of the cell. PEP-CTERM proteins are
rich in the residues most likely to carry O-linked (Ser, Thr)
and N-linked (Asn) carbohydrate. It seems likely to us that
many PEP-CTERM term proteins are produced when
exopolysaccharide is produced for biofilm formation and
transported across the outer membrane where they add a
proteinaceous component to the extracellular material.
Experimental work will be required to determine when
PEP-CTERM proteins are expressed, where they localize,
whether they are processed at the C-terminus, and
whether EpsH proteins are required for sorting and/or
processing.
Should experimental findings verify the proposed proteolytic activity, we believe members of the EpsH family
should be called "exosortase". This suggestion, for now, is
based on the similar physical properties of PEP-CTERM
and LPXTG transmembrane domains, the recurring association of EpsH genes with large exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci, and the suggestion that the absolutely
conserved residues Cys, Arg, and His found in the EpsH
family are not merely fortuitously like the known catalytic
triad His, Cys, and Arg (a different order) in the sortase
family.
The proposed DNA motif and accessory proteins we have
identified (PrsK, PrsR and PrsT) in the proteobacteria
highlight the probable complex regulatory mechanisms
that may be operating on the expression of PEP-CTERM
proteins. The nature of the stimulus which triggers the
activity of the histidine kinase PrsK remains obscure as the
specificity domain appears to be entirely novel. Clearly,
there are additional regulatory proteins and DNA motifs
to be discovered in association with PEP-CTERM/EpsH
systems, as many PEP-CTERM genes both within and outside of the proteobacteria have upstream non-coding
regions not associated with the class described here.

Methods
Construction of hidden Markov models
Protein models
Preliminary multiple sequence alignments were constructed with Clustal W [51] or MUSCLE [52] and were
trimmed and adjusted manually as needed. Hidden
Markov models (HMMs) were constructed from multiple
sequence alignments, and HMM searches were performed, using HMMER [53]. Previously described
sequence domains present in proteins of interest were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/29

detected with Pfam [25,26] and TIGRFAMs [21]. Novel
paralogous domains were detected by performing
sequence similarity searching with BLAST [54] among
protein sequence regions found to be negative for current
TIGRFAMs and Pfam HMMs, followed by single linkage
clustering. Sequences from clusters of interest were
aligned by Clustal W and used to build HMMs. Preliminary search results were then used to expand the collection of sequences, realign, and improve the models.
Criteria applied manually to judge candidate members of
the PEP-CTERM family for inclusion in new rounds of
model building included overall sequence similarity to
other members, conserved position near the protein C-terminus, quality of the predicted transmembrane helix and
other motifs, and consistency of the resulting multiple
sequence alignment. Completed protein profile HMMs
were deposited in the TIGRFAMs database [21].
DNA models
Significant similarity of DNA sequences in small, gapless
alignments were detected by manual inspection of results
from GLAM [55], followed by alignment of larger regions,
with gaps, by Clustal W or MUSCLE. Several rounds of
building a DNA profile HMM, searching intergenic
regions, and producing new multiple sequence alignments from the search results were performed.
Phylogenetic profiling; the partial phylogenetic profiling
(PPP) methods
Phylogenetic profiles [14] were constructed from prokaryotic complete genomes in the Comprehensive Microbial
Resource (CMR) [23] where the binary value 1 (YES) was
assigned for genomes in which the reference feature was
detected (more than 2 instances of the PEP-CTERM
domain, or the presence of the conserved DNA motif),
and 0 (NO) for all genomes in which it was not.

Using each profile-positive genome in turn, we scored
every protein in that genome for its correlation between a
phylogenetic profile and the list of related sequences in
other genomes as measured by BLAST comparison. The
heuristic operated as follows. The list of matching
sequences from other genomes was sorted from the most
significant match to the least. After the first occurrence of
a species (i.e. multiple strains of the same species and/or
multiple matches within the same genome), subsequent
matches were ignored. Proceeding down the list of
matched genomes, the relative counts of YES and NO
states were scored at each point for the probability P that
the current count y of YES genomes, or greater, could have
been encountered by chance among the N genomes
encountered so far, as calculated from the binomial distribution. The first term (see below) of the summation over
all possible YES counts from y up to N dominates when
YES genomes are relatively rare, but the full summation is

performed. In the equation, p is the fraction of the species
in the dataset, which are represented, in the positive (YES,
1) branch of the phylogenetic profile.
P = N!/(y!(N-y)!)Â·pyÂ·(1-p)(N-y)
The best score at any point down the list does not necessarily occur when only YES states have been encountered.
Consideration of the properties of the binomial distribution makes it obvious that, for a sparsely distributed property, finding, for instance, eleven genomes with ten
marked YES and a single NO will be more significant than
finding seven genomes all marked YES (Table 2).
Although taxonomic filtering was used to minimize the
bias introduced by the presence of multiple strains of the
same species in the dataset, the resulting probabilities
largely ignore the common ancestry of species with similar complements of proteins and should not be taken literally; calculated "probabilities" are used only for
comparison among different proteins from the same
genome. The match of any one protein from the reference
genome to the phylogenetic profile becomes optimized
for that protein by automatic selection of the most favorable BLAST E-value cutoff. The list of all proteins from the
reference genome is then reported in order, starting with
the most significant match to the phylogenetic profile.
The top of the list can then be checked for findings of
meaningful relationships. This heuristic avoids the need
for precomputed protein families. While it depends on
the choice of reference genome, it can be run separately
for each genome in the profile. Our implementation uses
pre-computed, comprehensive all-versus-all BLAST search
results stored in the CMR [23]; the heuristic would work
as well (but slower) with de novo searches.

To validate the phylogenetic profiling method, we constructed a phylogenetic profile in which all genomes with
more than two matches to model TIGR01167, for the
LPXTG cell wall anchor domain of Gram-positive bacteria, were assigned the value 1, while all with no matches
were assigned 0. Note that this profile provides more
information than a simple list of Gram-positive bacteria.
For example, Corynebacterium diptheriae has many LPXTG
domains, while Corynebacterium glutamicum has none. We
tested four different reference genomes against this profile: C. diptheriae NCTC 13129, Bacillus cereus ATCC
14579, Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae R6. In all four cases, the top match identified
to the profile was a member of the sortase family. The sortase SrtA is known to recognize LPXTG sequences and catalyze a transpeptidation that attaches the target protein to
the cell wall [11]. This method, therefore, could have
deduced the connection between LPXTG sequences and
sortases had the relationship not already been known.
Similarly, we constructed profiles for the presence of the
