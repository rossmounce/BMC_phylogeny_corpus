Abstract
Background: With over 20 parapatric races differing in their warningly colored wing patterns, the
butterfly Heliconius erato provides a fascinating example of an adaptive radiation. Together with
matching races of its co-mimic Heliconius melpomene, H. erato also represents a textbook case of
Müllerian mimicry, a phenomenon where common warning signals are shared amongst noxious
organisms. It is of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing patterns
of H. erato and H. melpomene. To this end we have undertaken comparative mapping and targeted
genomic sequencing in both species. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of genomic
sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in Heliconius.
Results: Scoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to survey loci at
approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy we were able to identify
markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and Cr, which were then used to screen H.
erato BAC libraries in order to identify clones for sequencing. Gene density across 600 kb of BAC
sequences appeared relatively low, although the number of predicted open reading frames was
typical for an insect. We focused analyses on the D- and Cr-linked H. erato BAC sequences and on
the Yb-linked H. melpomene BAC sequence. A comparative analysis between homologous regions
of H. erato (Cr-linked BAC) and H. melpomene (Yb-linked BAC) revealed high levels of sequence

conservation and microsynteny between the two species. We found that repeated elements
constitute 26% and 20% of BAC sequences from H. erato and H. melpomene respectively. The
majority of these repetitive sequences appear to be novel, as they showed no significant similarity
to any other available insect sequences. We also observed signs of fine scale conservation of gene
order between Heliconius and the moth Bombyx mori, suggesting that lepidopteran genome
architecture may be conserved over very long evolutionary time scales.
Conclusion: Here we have demonstrated the tractability of progressing from a genetic linkage
map to genomic sequence data in Heliconius butterflies. We have also shown that fine-scale gene
order is highly conserved between distantly related Heliconius species, and also between Heliconius
and B. mori. Together, these findings suggest that genome structure in macrolepidoptera might be
very conserved, and show that mapping and positional cloning efforts in different lepidopteran
species can be reciprocally informative.

Background
Among emerging evolutionary and ecological model
organisms, the passion-vine butterfly genus Heliconius
(Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) offers particularly exciting
possibilities for integrative research into the genetic and
developmental basis of adaptive variation [1,2]. The
genus, composed of around 40 species with hundreds of
geographic variants, couples color pattern divergence with
multiple cases of mimicry-related convergent evolution
[2]. The wing color patterns of Heliconius are adaptations
that warn potential predators of the butterflies' unpalatability [3] and also play an important role in speciation [4].
Nearly all Heliconius species participate in local Müllerian
mimicry associations and, in any one area, the wing color
patterns of different aposematic butterfly species converge
into a handful (usually six or less) of clearly differentiated
mimetic assemblages [5]. The color patterns characterizing many of these mimicry rings often change dramatically every few hundred kilometers. This pattern of
convergent and divergent evolution in Heliconius is best
exemplified by the mimetic relationship between H. erato
and H. melpomene. The two species are distantly related
within the genus and never hybridize [2,6,7], yet, where
they co-occur, local races possess nearly identical wing
patterns and have undergone parallel and congruent radiations into over 20 geographic races [5,8].
The multiple radiations of mimetic color patterns, particularly the parallel radiations of H. erato and H. melpomene,
provide "natural experiments" for comparative studies
into the genetic and developmental basis of adaptive
change. In this paper, we describe a simple strategy that
integrates growing genomic resources in Heliconius to
identify regions of the genome near the loci that modulate
wing pattern variation in H. erato. Our strategy relies on
the fact that large phenotypic differences within species
are caused by a handful of major effect loci [8] and that
crosses can be designed that allow researchers to unambiguously follow the segregation of alleles at these loci

[9,10]. By scanning through thousands of AFLP polymorphisms in these crosses we can identify markers tightly
associated with particular color pattern genes. These
markers are then used to probe newly available Bacterial
Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries and allow us to
obtain large sections of genomic sequence around color
pattern genes. These targeted genomic sequences provide
the first insights into the architecture of the H. erato
genome including details on gene density, repeat structure
and, with sequence information from homologous
regions of the H. melpomene genome, the preservation of
fine-scale gene order between the two co-mimics. These
data facilitate comparative mapping work on the genetic
basis of color pattern variation and convergence in Heliconius, including efforts to positionally clone the color pattern genes themselves. These data also provide some of
the first information on patterns of microsynteny in lepidopteran genomes, complementing recent work showing
marked patterns of synteny conservation at a macro scale
between H. melpomene and the silk moth Bombyx mori
[11].
We are focusing our research efforts on two major color
pattern loci, D and Cr, which underlie much of the
observed pattern variation in H. erato. Both genes are
unlinked and alleles at the different loci interact to cause
phenotypic shifts across large areas of the wing surface,
changing the position, size and shape of red/orange/yellow and melanic patches on both the dorsal and ventral
surfaces of the forewings and hindwings. Alleles at the D
locus primarily act by switching scale color between black
(melanin) and red/orange (ommochrome pigments)
[12,13]. In contrast, alleles at Cr control the positioning of
melanin across both the forewing and hindwing, thereby
either exposing or covering underlying white and yellow
pattern elements (Figure 1). The two loci strongly interact
to control the size, shape, and position of both the forewing band and hindwing bar of many races of H. erato
[9,10,14].

(middle) and H. erato cyrbia (left) and H. erato notabilis (right) resulting in two pairs of F1 parents with females on left, males on
right. Each pair of F1 parents produced F2s with H. himera × H. erato cyrbia offspring (A) and the H. himera × H. erato notabilis
offspring (B). In both F2 families, the observed phenotypic differences among individuals are consistent with the interaction of
two co-dominant loci, as described in the Methods.

Crossing experiments among the various races of H. erato
and H. melpomene have shown that the genetic basis of the
color pattern radiations is similar in these species [15]. In
both, a small number of major effect loci, or complex of
tightly linked loci, modulate much of the intraspecific pattern variation. Furthermore, the phenotypic effects of
many of the major patterning genes are often quite similar
between the two species [5,16,17]. For example, Cr in H.
erato and the N/Yb/Sb complex in H. melpomene control
most of the variation in yellow and white pattern elements in different mimic races of the two species
[9,10,17]. Similarly, variation in the major red pattern elements on the forewing and hindwing of H. erato and H.
melpomene can be explained by variation at an unlinked
gene, D, in H. erato and the similarly named D/B complex,
in H. melpomene. In contrast, in H. melpomene these switch
genes represent clusters of tightly linked elements separated by one cM or less [2,18]. Comparative mapping
experiments have shown that the Yb complex in H. melpomene and the Cr locus in H. erato, which have analogous
phenotypic effects, map to the homologous regions of
their respective genomes [15].
There were three primary goals for the study presented
here. First, we sought to identify molecular markers linked
to the H. erato color pattern genes D and Cr. Second, we
used some of these molecular markers to identify and
sequence BAC clones containing genomic sequences
linked to these color pattern genes. Lastly, we analyzed
selected BAC sequences in order to better understand finescale characteristics of the H. erato genome and to make
comparisons with homologous genomic sequences in H.
melpomene and B. mori. Ultimately we found that synteny
is highly conserved between Heliconius species, and even
between Heliconius and B. mori. We also observed relatively low gene density coupled with a high frequency of
novel repeat elements in the Heliconius genomic
sequences. Together, our data show that comparative
genomic analysis between lepidopterans is highly tractable, and that positional cloning of genes underlying color
pattern variation in Heliconius should be possible using
standard methods.

Results
Identification of markers tightly linked to color pattern
genes
We examined 1440 AFLP H. erato polymorphisms using
23 primer combinations (EcoCN/MseCNN). The number
of AFLP bands per gel ranged between 26 and 132 with a
mean of 72 bands per primer combination. Of these,
approximately 84% were polymorphic in our outbred F2
cross. The experiment-wide error rate for our screen was
approximately 1.0%, as inferred from discrepancies
among female informative (FI) markers. In total, we
scored 490 Male Informative (MI) and 470 backcross

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/345

informative (BI) loci. Assuming an estimated H. erato
genome size of 395 Mb [14], and assuming that AFLP
markers are distributed randomly, suggests that we surveyed polymorphisms at approximately 362 kb intervals
across the genome. This would suggest a resolution of 1.3
cM assuming that the relationship between physical and
recombination distance is 276 kb/cM [9].
Our genome scan identified several AFLP markers 1–3 cM
away from D. For the other gene, Cr, previous work using
an identical strategy on crosses of H. melpomene provided
markers within one cM of this gene in H. erato [15]. In
total, we identified five AFLP loci within a 3 cM target window around the D locus. Across our H. himera × H. erato
notabilis mapping family for D, three loci (MI_EcoCAMseCAA-114 bp, BI_EcoCC-MseCAG-155 bp, BI_EcoCTMseCCG-139 bp) were perfectly linked and two loci
(MI_EcoCC-MseCAC-527 bp, MI_EcoCC-MseCAC-485)
showed only one recombinant. We cloned and sequenced
several of these AFLP loci and developed PCR primers to
amplify them from genomic DNA. Interestingly, two AFLP
bands tightly linked to the D gene, MI_EcoCC-MseCAC527 bp, MI_EcoCC-MseCAC-485, were allelic variants of
the same locus.
Identification of BAC clones containing color patternlinked AFLPs
We screened the H. erato BAC library with D-linked
(MI_EcoCC-MseCAC-527 bp) and Cr-linked ("βggt-II" –
Rab geranylgeranyl transferase beta subunit, βggt-II gene
[15]) probes. In our screens with these and other probes
(15 probes in total, with an average of 12 positives per
probe), we consistently observed between 9 and 15 PCRconfirmed positives per probe, suggesting the H. erato
BAC libraries have approximately 10× genome coverage.
The largest clones identified from the D-linked and Crlinked probing experiments were sequenced at 8× coverage. The D-linked clone (BBAM-25K4) was composed of
two large sequences that could easily be orientated to produce an approximately 180 kb genomic fragment (Figure
2). Similarly, sequence of the Cr-linked clone (BBAM38A20) was composed of two large sequences that
together spanned approximately 165 kb (Figure 3). The
probe sequences were clearly identifiable in the D-linked
and Cr-linked BACs and linkage to color pattern genes was
confirmed by mapping (see below).
Chromosome walk in the Cr region
From the sequence of the first Cr-linked BAC, identified
with the βggt-II gene, we designed additional probes to
use for a second round of BAC library screening. Specifically we generated two more probes, corresponding to the
genes Trehalase1 and B9, to expand our walk on both
directions. With this strategy we identified new BACs on
the 3' end that were positive for B9 and negative for

Summary of identification and repeat masking of repetitive elements in BAC sequences from H. erato (accession numbers: AC193804, AC216670) and H. melpomene (accession numbers: CR974474, CT955980). A) Repetitive elements identified
via similarity to previously described sequences. B) Novel repetitive elements unique to Heliconius identified de novo using the RepeatMasker software (additional file 1: Novel repetitive elements in Heliconius (row sequences)). Each core motif is
a summary sequence representing a different and unique set of related repeat sequences. Motifs four and five were not observed in H. melpomene; Motif nine was not oberseved in H. erato. Core Motifs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 were identified by
RepeatFinder only in H. erato but masked by RepeatMasker in H. melpomene. (* RepeatFinder identified fragments of this motif in H. melpomene, but the groups did not overlap to give a core motif comparable to that in H. erato).

LTR retrotransposons) were present in the genomic
sequences (Table 1A), the vast majority of repetitive
sequences showed no significant BLAST similarity (i.e. evalue < 0.001) to any of the insect genomes currently
available NCBI databases nor to any arthropod transposable elements listed in RepBase [19]. Heliconius-specific
repetitive sequences corresponded to the nine core motifs
identified with RepeatFinder (Table 1B; Additional file 1:
Novel repetitive elements in Heliconius (row sequences)).
Of the nine motifs, six are present in both H. erato and H.
melpomene, two are unique to H. erato, and one is unique
to H. melpomene (Table 1; Additional file 1: Novel repetitive elements in Heliconius (row sequences)).
Gene density in Heliconius BAC sequences
Gene density appeared to be relatively low across both the
Cr- and the D-linked genomic regions. Although there
were a moderate number of predicted open reading
frames (ORFs) over 60 amino acids long (Figures 2 and
3), few showed any similarity to known proteins or lepidopteran ESTs, including our own collection of nearly
20,000 Heliconius ESTs (Table 2). For example, across the
D-linked BAC we identified 75 hypothetical proteins
using the Kaikogaas annotation tool and our own BLAST
analysis. Over 90%, however, were less than 150 amino
acids in length, only one of which showed similarity to
any known or predicted protein. Across the entire ~190 kb
region near the D locus in H. erato there were only two
hypothetical proteins that showed significant homology

to a known protein or contained a known structural element. One was similar to a sequence in our EST collection
(HEC00815), while the other showed strong homology to
a lepidopteran methionine-rich larval storage protein
(Table 2). Although there was a smaller absolute number
of predicted proteins across the Cr-linked BAC, there were
more than twice as many predicted proteins of aminoacid length greater than 150 across, all but one of which
showed strong homology to known proteins or to Heliconius ESTs (Table 2, Figure 2). Overall, the gene density we
observed in H. erato is similar to what has been observed
in the repeat-rich heterochromatin domains of Drosophila
melanogaster, which averages 2.9 genes per 100 kb (versus
12.6 genes per 100 kb in euchromatin) [20].
Fine-scale microsynteny between H. erato and H.
melpomene genomic sequences
VISTA analysis [21] (70% identity, 30 bp window – see
Methods) showed a 35% conservation between the 164
kb H. erato Cr-linked BAC clone (BBAM-38A20) and the
homologous sequence from H. melpomene (Figure 3). All
of the predicted genes showed strong similarity (80–95%
identity) between the two species and perfect overall synteny (Figure 3 and 4). Furthermore, a significant portion
of 57 kb of presumed non-coding sequence (i.e. did not
show notable open reading frames) was highly conserved
between the two species (Figure 3). Despite the overall
conservation between H. erato and H. melpomene
sequences, two ESTs did show a difference between the

species. Firstly, HEC03006 was found only in H. erato, and
corresponded to a large indel sequence. Also, HEC01402
was found in the H. melpomene BAC sequence but not the
H. erato sequence, although it shared some similarity with
an exon of the Forkhead gene in the H. erato BAC sequence.
For HEC01402, it is likely that the H. erato BAC sequence
did not extend far enough to cover the homologus
genomic region containing the gene in H. melpomene.

cated, all of the gene orders and distances in Heliconius
and B. mori are highly conserved. For example, Glucose
dehydrogenase and Forkhead Box were separated by 5300 bp
in H. erato and 5193 bp in B. mori, while Trehalase1 and
Trehalase2 were separated by 3110 bp in H. erato and 3464
bp in B. mori. All seven genes showed 70–85% nucleotide
acid sequence similarity between species (Figure 5). In
addition to the major genes, there were many other
genomic regions between Heliconius and B. mori with a
nucleotide acid sequence similarity higher than 85% that
did not show BLAST similarities to any known proteins.

Conservation of gene order between H. erato and B. mori
We found evidence for fine-scale synteny between H. erato
and B. mori in the 420 kb genomic region linked to the Cr
color pattern gene (Figure 5). No evidence for microsynteny was observed between D-linked H. erato genomic
regions and B. mori, due to the lack of conserved genes in
the D-linked clone. B. mori scaffold sequence (nscaf2829),
downloaded from SilkDB [22], contained all of the major
genes annotated on the Cr-linked BAC clones (Table 2,
Figure 5). All genes were unambiguously identified: βggtII (nscaf2829, position 2933018–2938173); Glucose dehydrogenase (nscaf2829, position 2929161–2931568); Forkhead Box (nscaf2829, position 2921212–2923967);
Trehalase1 (nscaf2829, position 2866386–2868122);
Trehalase2 (nscaf2829, position 2861182–2862921); B9
(nscaf2829, position 2830788–2833491); Unkempt
(nscaf2829, position 2748736–2755694); Beta fructosidase FruA (nscaf2829, position 2704806–2706326). With
the exception of the DNA helicase (nscaf2829, position
2870771–2872660), which appears to have been translo-

Discussion
High levels of fine-scale genomic conservation between
Heliconius species
We have previously demonstrated that the Cr locus in H.
erato and the Yb gene of H. melpomene map to homologous areas of the genome [15]. BAC genome sequence
data for a region tightly linked to the Yb gene was
obtained from H. melpomene using methodology similar
to that described here. A single gene marker developed
from the H. melpomene sequence mapped close to the Cr
locus in H. erato. Here we provide the first genomic
sequence evidence that, across a broad region around this
gene, gene order and gene content is conserved. Across a
420 kb overlapping region all putative proteins showing
high similarity to known proteins were in the same order
in the two co-mimics (Figure 3 and 4). This further supports the hypothesis that a homologous gene, or set of

genes, is responsible for color pattern variation in the two
species. Indeed, with the exception of two large ORFs with
strong sequence similarity to a reverse transcriptase (Table
2, Figure 3), gene order in the Cr-linked H. erato region
and the N/Yb/Sb-linked H. melpomene region was nearly
perfectly preserved. Furthermore, many of the smaller
ORFs, as well as some non-coding sequence, were highly
conserved both in the relative order and sequence. Generally, the H. erato and H. melpomene genomes appear to be
structurally very similar. Because of this, linkage analyses
and positional cloning efforts in each individual species
should be highly informative for the co-mimetic species,
and probably for the genus as a whole.
The difference in H. erato and H. melpomene genome
sizes
One of the most obvious differences between the H. erato
and H. melpomene genomic sequences was the larger physical distance between homologous anchor points in H.
erato relative to H. melpomene. This observation was probably related to the fact that the genome of H. erato is about
30% larger than that of H. melpomene [9,10]. In this
respect, it was notable that the difference in genome sizes
between the two species was roughly proportional to the
size of a number of sequence blocks that are absent in H.
melpomene relative to H. erato in our genomic sequences
(Figure 3). Many of these blocks were comprised of Heliconius-specific repetitive sequences, or showed strong similarity to known mobile genetic elements. These indel
blocks appeared to be primarily noncoding sequences
because none of them contained protein-coding
sequences, with the exception of one EST (HEC03006)
and a reverse transcriptase.

Differences in the genome size between closely related
species is common and is usually associated with differences in abundance of different classes of noncoding DNA
[23]. It has been suggested that the insertion and replication of repetitive elements, as well as indel biases, can lead
to profound differences in genome size [24,25]. Our
observations suggest that both of these effects might be
relevant in Heliconius, however, the differences in amount
of repetitive DNA sequences in indels, at least over the
small region that we examined, were not large enough to
completely account for the differences in the genome size
of the two species.
Novel repetitive elements in Heliconius
Using RepeatFinder [26] and RepeatMasker [27], we identified 16 different repeated elements in the Heliconius
genomic sequences (Table 1). In total, repetitive
sequences accounted for about 20% of the H. melpomene
and about 26% of the H. erato genomic sequence. Seven
of these repeated elements corresponded to previously
described sequences (Table 1A). Because we were unable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/345

to detect any of the remaining nine repeats (all identified
via RepeatFinder) in public sequence databases we
assume these nine repeats represent novel repetitive elements unique to the Heliconius genus (Table 1B, Additional file 1: Novel repetitive elements in Heliconius (row
sequences)). The seven previously described elements
were larger (~1–5 kb) relative to the nine novel elements
(100–600 bp) and occurred much less frequently. Most
instances of these novel repeats observed in the BAC
sequences were intact, full-length, highly similar versions
of the core motifs. However, a wide range of fragmentation and divergence relative to the core motifs was also
observed among repetitive regions. Motif #7 in H. erato
best exemplifies this pattern, as it was the most abundant
repeat observed, with 310 BAC regions showing significant similarity to the 266 bp core motif. These regions
ranged continuously in size from 37 to 286 bp and in
divergence from 2% to 32%. All other motifs showed a
qualitatively similar pattern where BAC regions corresponding to a novel element ranged from being highly
similar to the core motif sequence to being fragmented
and divergent. This pattern is consistent with a process of
motif replication and insertion followed by mutational
degradation, suggesting these novel repeat motifs likely
represent some sort of transposable element such as short
interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) or miniature
inverted-repeat terminal elements (MITEs) [28]. Both
SINEs and MITEs have been reported from Lepidoptera
[29,30]. More work is required to confidently determine
the origin of these novel repetitive sequences in Heliconius. We are hopeful that future genomic sequences from
other butterfly species will allow a better understanding
the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary origins of
some of the observed repeats.
Preliminary evidence for fine-scale synteny between
Heliconius and Bombyx
The observed fine scale synteny within Heliconius complements a recent study showing that patterns of macrosynteny are strongly conserved across the Macrolepidoptera
[11]. This previous study demonstrated that a total of 70
markers mapped in H. melpomene and B. mori showed
large-scale patterns of synteny across the genome (taking
into account a number of putative chromosomal fusions
that explain the difference in chromosome number
between these species). Our data further suggests that synteny has been preserved between Heliconius and B. mori on
a much finer scale. Specifically, we show here that seven
predicted genes in the Cr region have a similar order in the
homologous B. mori genomic sequence (Figure 5).
Although this is a very small sampling of the genome as a
whole, it is still notable that gene order, as well as intergenic distances, has been preserved over such a long time
scale.

Chromosome walking towards Heliconius color pattern
genes
The goal of this study was to identify and characterize
regions of the genome linked to wing pattern polymorphism in Heliconius butterflies. We did not necessarily
expect these initial BAC sequences to contain the color
pattern genes themselves, however, these sequences provide important genomic "anchors" for ongoing positional
cloning work. Fine-scale mapping experiments imply that
we are very near the D and Cr color pattern loci. A microsatellite marker at the 5' end of the D-linked BAC showed
7 recombinants across 444 individuals, suggesting that
this end is about 1.9 cM from the gene. There were two
fewer recombinants for a marker developed from exon
sequence of the Methionine Rich Storage Protein (MRSP)
gene at the 3' end of the BAC. This marker is about 150 kb
from our 5' microsatellite marker, suggesting that D is a
further 1 cM in the 3' direction. We appear to have come
down even closer to the Cr gene. In this case, a marker
developed from the βggt-II gene near the 5' of the BBAM38A20 BAC clone showed no recombinants across 430
individuals. A similar result was obtained with a marker
developed from the Putative DNA helicase Rec-Q in the
middle of the BBAM-27D18 BAC clone, suggesting that
the zero recombinant interval might be somewhat large.
For this reason, given an expected relationship of physical
to recombination distance of 275 kb/cM [9], an expectation consistent with our initial mapping results, we are
optimistic to identify the genomic recombinant interval
containing both genes with the next one (Cr) to three (D)
BAC steps.

In terms of identifying color pattern genes, there are obvious practical benefits of a fine-scale preservation of gene
order between species. Foremost, conservation should
greatly facilitate the identification of functional genes and
the discovery of some regulatory elements associated with
these genes [31,32]. Indeed, there were numerous conserved regions that were not simply protein coding
regions (Figure 3). Even though this analysis covers only a
small portion of the Heliconius genome, it confirms, for
the first time, at a fine scale level what has been seen in
comparative mapping projects concerning gene order
conservation between different species in the genus
[9,10,33].
A comparative approach will be particularly important for
pinpointing the regions responsible for pattern variation
in Heliconius. Pattern formation in Heliconius probably
involves discrete changes in conserved protein coding or
regulatory regions [2,12]. There is little precedent for what
to expect, however, variation in pattern formation could
be controlled by a number of cis-regulatory elements of a
single gene, clusters of duplicated genes with divergent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/345

function, or clusters of non-paralogous but functionallyrelated genes.

Conclusion
The mimetic wing patterns of Heliconius stand out as one
of the best examples of an adaptive radiation. We are
using a strategy that couples growing genomic resources
with high-resolution linkage analysis in order to gain a
fuller appreciation of the genetic basis of this radiation.
We have identified regions of the Heliconius genome
tightly linked to genes that modulate pattern variation
and, for one of these regions, we have demonstrated the
fine-scale preservation of gene order between distantlyrelated Heliconius species and across Lepidoptera (Heliconius and B. mori). This conservation is significant because it
will greatly facilitate efforts for gene identification
through parallel and complementary efforts in different
species. It is our hope that further fine-scale mapping,
complemented by targeted genomic sequencing, will
allow us to identify the genes that underlie wing pattern
variation and diversity in the genus Heliconius.

Methods
Cross strategy
We generated large F2 mapping families by crossing two
different geographic races of H. erato to the same stock of
H. himera (Figure 1). We followed segregating variation at
both the D and the Cr loci in crosses between H. erato cyrbia and H. himera and the D and Sd loci using crosses
between H. erato notabilis and H. himera (Figure 1). All
crosses were carried out in the Heliconius insectary at the
University of Puerto Rico from stocks originally gathered
from the wild: H. himera was collected in Vilcabamba,
Ecuador (79.13 W, 4.6 S), H. erato notabilis was collected
from an area near Puyo, Ecuador (78.0 W, 1.5 S), and H.
erato cyrbia was collected near Guayquichuma Glen, Ecuador (79.6 W, 3.9 S). After eclosion butterflies were euthanized, their wings removed for later morphological
analysis, and their bodies frozen at -80 °C for later molecular analysis.
Identifying AFLP markers linked to color pattern genes
Genomic DNA was extracted following procedures
described in [14] and approximately 500 ng of DNA was
used as template of our AFLP reactions. Genomic DNA
restriction digestions and the ligation of oligonucleotide
adapters were performed using the Core Reagent Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies) following manufacture's
instructions. For all the other steps of the AFLP analysis
(e.g. serial dilutions and PCR amplification protocols), we
followed the modifications of the original protocol
described by Vos et al. [34] as outlined in Papa et al. [35].

To efficiently identify primer combinations that contained loci tightly linked to color pattern genes, we used a

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:345

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/345

modification of the "bulk segregant analysis" method
[36]. Specifically, we screened 23 AFLP primer combinations across an initial panel of 48 individuals arranged by
color pattern genotype. Each reaction was run on a 10%
polyacrylamide gel and visualized using fluorescently
labeled (IRDye 700 or 800) EcoCN primers on a NEN®
Global Edition IR2 DNA Analyzer (LI-COR® Biosciences,
Lincoln, NE). In our screening gels, individuals with distinctive color-pattern genotypes were grouped and these
groups were run side-by-side. For example, in the H. erato
notabilis × H. himera cross we structured the gel with the
following four genotypic groups: 1) DhimDnot, SdhimSdhim;
2) DhimDnot, Sdnot Sdnot; 3) DhimDhim, SdhimSdnot; 4)DnotDnot,
SdhimSdnot (Figure 1). In this way, we easily identified
marker loci linked to the color pattern genes and those
primer combinations showing tightly linked markers were
further assayed on all 120 individuals in the brood.

ical yellow forewing band when D is pure H. himera
(CrhiCrhi; DhiDhi) and a red/white forewing band (total
amount of red pigments < 50%) when D is either
homozygous for H. erato cyrbia alleles (CrhiCrhi; DcyrDcyr)
or heterozygous (CrhiCrhi; DhiDcyr). When the Cr color pattern gene is heterozygous (CrhiCrcyr) a yellow forewing
shadow band is present when the D gene is homozyous
for H. himera alleles (CrhiCrcyr; DhiDhi), and an almost all
red forewing band (red >50%) when D homozygote for
H. erato cyrbia alleles (CrhiCrcyr; DcyrDcyr) or heterozygote
(CrhiCrcyr; DhiDcyr). A white trailing dorsal edge and a yellow bar on the ventral hindwing identify the pure H. erato
cyrbia form (CrcyrCrcyr) with a totally black forewing when
D is homozygous for H. himera alleles (CrcyrCrcyr; DhiDhi),
or totally red when the D gene is pure for H. erato cyrbia
alleles (CrcyrCrcyr; DcyrDcyr) or heterozygous (CrcyrCrcyr;
DhiDcyr).

Because of the nature of our outbred F2 cross design
[9,10] we observed AFLP loci in all possible phases and
segregation patterns. For each AFLP primer combination,
we scored four different AFLP marker types: (1) monomorphic, (2) female-informative (FI) (AFLP band present
in the mother and absent in the father), (3) male-informative markers (MI) (AFLP band present in the father but
absent in the mother), and (4) markers that were present
in both parents but segregated in offspring (BI). Both MI
and FI markers were expected to segregate in a 1:1 ratio,
whereas the BI markers, which were heterozygous in the
parents, segregate in a 3:1 ratio. There is no crossing over
during the oogenesis in Lepidoptera [37,38] and FI markers on the same chromosome are inherited as a linkage
block [10]. Thus, only the MI and BI provided information on recombination distance between AFLP polymorphisms and color pattern genes. Nonetheless, the FI
markers were extremely useful because they allowed us to
unambiguously identify chromosomal linkage groups
and estimate background error rate of the AFLP technique
[9,10].

To score color patterns, one must also understand activity
of the Sd gene. Sd segregates in the H. erato notabilis × H.
himera cross, where it controls the shape of the melanic
window in the middle forewing of H. himera and shows a
clear interaction with the distal forewing patch of H. erato
notabilis. In the pure H. himera (SdhiSdhi) a typical forewing
band is shown, while in the pure H. erato notabilis (SdnotSdnot) a shortened basal forewing patch, as well as a smaller
distal forewing patch are evident. The heterozygotes
(SdhiSdnot) present an intermediate form lacking a distal
patch (as found in H. erato notabilis) and have a shortened
basal patch showing melanin anterior to the costal vein
(this area is normally light colored in H. himera).

Genotypes for the color pattern genes were inferred from
wing pattern phenotypes. Based on the amount of red,
white and yellow in the forewing and hindwing, nine genotypes were observed among both groups of F2 progeny.
For the D gene, shared by all three grand-parental types:
homozygotes for the H. himera allele (DhiDhi) show only
red present on the hind-wing bar, when D homozygotes
for H. erato cyrbia or H. erato notabilis alleles (Dcyr Dcyr;
DnotDnot) have red scales on the forewings, while D is heterozygotes between H. himera and the two H. erato races
(Dhi Dcyr; Dhi Dnot) have red pigmented scales on both
forewings and hindwings. The Cr gene segregates only in
the H. erato cyrbia × H. himera cross, and has an epistatic
effect on the D gene by modulating the amount of red.
Homozygotes with H. himera alleles (CrhiCrhi) show a typ-

Isolating and characterizing AFLP markers
We screened all primer combinations that generated BI or
MI AFLP markers strongly associated with particular color
pattern genes in our initial "bulked" sample across all 120
individuals from our mapping family. We excised and
cloned those tightly linked AFLP markers larger than 160
base-pairs using a three-step strategy. First, the band was
isolated from a polyacrylamide gel using a LI-COR® Biosciences Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System. We followed
methods outlined in [39] and used a grid to position and
excise specific fragments with a scalpel. We validated each
excision by re-scanning the gel to confirm that we had
removed the correct fragment. All gel fragments were
placed in 15 ml of 1× TE and frozen at -80°C. Next, we reamplified the AFLP using the original selective primer
combination and the original PCR conditions. We generated template for this reaction by freeze/thawing the
excised band three times. In each freeze/thaw cycle, we
collected the resulting supernatant after the band was frozen for one hour at -80°C, heated at 55°C for 15 min and
centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. We checked amplification success by running PCR products on polyacrylamide gels adjacent to the positive control original AFLP

reactions. Finally, we cloned the PCR product using Invitrogen's TOPO TA® Cloning kit. PCR amplified inserts from
10–15 positive clones were again verified size on a polyacrylimide gel and those of the correct size were
sequenced using DYEnamicT ET Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing
reactions were run on a MegaBACE 500 (Amersham Bioscience) or a 3130 DNA PRISM (ABI) at the Sequencing
Facilities of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras.
Resulting sequences were aligned by eye and PCR primers
were designed using OLIGO version 4.0, and tested in
genomic extracts from a panel of H. erato individuals.
Probing the H. erato BAC library
Two H. erato BAC libraries, one partially restricted with
EcoRI and one with BamHI, were created from a line of H.
erato petiverana collected in Gamboa, Panama and inbred
for several generations. The H. erato BAC library was constructed by C. Zhang (TAMU) and M. R. Goldsmith (URI)
following the procedure outlined in Wu et al. [40]. Both
libraries contain 19,200 clones arrayed in 384-well plates
and the average insert size for the EcoRI and BamHI libraries was estimated to be 153 kb and 175 kb, respectively.
Libraries were gridded onto nylon membranes using a
strategy where each clone is spotted twice to facilitate the
identification of "true" positives. AFLP probes were
labeled with P32 using the Prime-It II Random Primer
Labeling Kit (Stratagene, CA, USA). The resulting radioactive labeled products were cleaned using a sephadex purification column and hybridized to the filters overnight at
65 degrees in Church Buffer (0.5 M NaHPO4 pH 7.2,
7%SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1%BSA) with rotation. The filters were washed twice with 2× SSC +0.1%SDS, then once
or twice with 1× SSC + 0.1%SDS. The washed filters were
placed on film for 1–5 days at -80 degrees, depending on
signal strength.
BAC fingerprinting, sequencing, and annotation
All positive clones identified in our screen of the H. erato
BAC libraray were PCR-confirmed using probe specific
primers. Clones were then grown overnight on agar plate
and single colony was used to inoculate TB media. Insert
DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Maxi prep kit. This
insertion size of each BAC clone is estimated by summing
all fragments after restriction enzyme digestion using
EcoRI or BamHI. The largest clone identified from our fingerprinting experiments was sequenced and assembled by
the Baylor Genomics Center. Clones were first sheared to
create 4–6 kb fragments and subcloned into pUC19.
Approximately 8× sequence coverage of each BAC was
then generated in paired 600–800 bp reads. Data were
assembled using PHRAP [41] and edited in a GAP4 [42]
database.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/345

The BAC sequences were analyzed using a variety of
sequence annotation programs. First we used Kaikogaas
[43], an automated annotation package for gene prediction [44], to identify possible genes. Kaikogaas integrates
a variety of programs for gene prediction and structural
analysis of genomic sequence including software for coding region and splice-site prediction, sequence homology
analysis, protein localization site prediction, and protein
classification and secondary structure prediction. All putative open reading frames were also compared directly to
our database of Heliconius Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)
located in ButterflyBase [45] using BLAST [46]. Any EST
that showed highly significant similarity (e-value of ≥ 1040) to a putative ORF was then directly compared to the
full genomic sequence. In this way, we could better assess
possible homology versus similarity due to repetitive
DNA elements (see below). To identify the B. mori
sequences homologous to the H. erato BAC sequences, we
performed a tBLASTn against the whole-genome shotgun
reads of B. mori using as a query the translated protein
sequence predicted by Kaikogaas.
Comparative sequence analysis
A linkage strategy similar to ours was previously used to
identify BACs near the Yb gene complex in H. melpomene
[15]. Sequencing and finishing of three contiguous H.
melpomene BACs across this region was carried out by the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (accession numbers:
CR974474, CT955980, CU367882). We used VISTA [21]
to identify similarities between H. erato, H. melpomene,
and B. mori genomic sequences. Pairwise genomic alignments were performed on the mVISTA server using the
Avid alignment algorithm and the results were displayed
together with the position of the annotations (ORFs,
genes, mobile DNA, microsatellites). Each annotation or
new genomic region identified from the comparative
analysis that showed a strong similarity (≥ 80% conserved) was verified by aligning the sequences from both
species using the LAGAN program [47] to get an accurate
DNA sequence assembly.

We also searched the H. erato and H. melpomene BAC
sequences for novel repetitive sequence as well as previously described transposable elements. To identify novel
repetitive sequences in the BACs, we used the RepeatFinder software [42,48]. RepeatFinder is explicitly
designed to find complex repeated motifs in large contiguous blocks genomic DNA sequence. Its algorithm uses
BLAST to iteratively query segments of the input sequence
against the intact input sequence. It then combines subsequences with high BLAST similarity into groups, which are
further refined by considering the variability in length and
divergence among constituent subsequences. The final
output is a list of groups of aligned, highly similar subsequences. It is important to note that because the algo-

rithm uses local alignments (generated by BLAST),
different groups may overlap in part or in whole. This
overlap allows the groups to be clustered into just a few
contigs representing a set of "core motifs" to which each
group can be uniquely assigned. Thus, each core motif is
a consensus of consenses.
We submitted the concatenated BAC sequences from each
species to RepeatFinder using default parameters except
for the following: Block Size = 2000, Minimum Repeat
Size = 20, Maximum Repeat Size = 700. Larger values for
the Maximum Repeat Size parameter were tried, but no
groups larger than ~600 bp were ever identified. Core
motifs were assembled from group consensus sequences
>35 bp in length using the default parameters in CodonCode Aligner software (CodonCode Corp., Dedham,
MA). For both species' sets of core motifs, all-vs-all
BLASTn searches were performed 1) between species to
identify motifs shared between species and 2) within species to verify that motifs within species were unrelated.
BLASTn was also used to search two additional databases
for sequences similar to the core motifs. First we searched
a combined database of the completed genomic or whole
genome shotgun sequences from all 20 insect genome
projects currently available at NCBI. We also searched all
arthropod transposable elements available in the Repbase
library of transposable elements [19].

We simultaneously identified and masked BAC regions
corresponding to both the novel core motifs and known
repetitive sequences using RepeatMasker [27]. We combined core motif sequences with sequences of all arthropod transposable elements from RepBase into a single
database. We queried this database with the concatenated
BAC sequences using RepeatMasker and the CrossMatch
search algorithm on the 'slow' setting to maximize sensitivity. The resulting data was summarized using custom
scripts implemented in the R statistics package [49].
