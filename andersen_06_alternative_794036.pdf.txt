Abstract
Background: CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein involved in a variety of cellular processes such
as lipid transport, immune regulation, hemostasis, adhesion, angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. It is
expressed in many tissues and cell types, with a tissue specific expression pattern that is a result of
a complex regulation for which the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. There are
several alternative mRNA isoforms described for the gene. We have investigated the expression
patterns of five alternative first exons of the CD36 gene in several human tissues and cell types, to
better understand the molecular details behind its regulation.
Results: We have identified one novel alternative first exon of the CD36 gene, and confirmed the
expression of four previously known alternative first exons of the gene. The alternative transcripts
are all expressed in more than one human tissue and their expression patterns vary highly in
skeletal muscle, heart, liver, adipose tissue, placenta, spinal cord, cerebrum and monocytes. All
alternative first exons are upregulated in THP-1 macrophages in response to oxidized low density
lipoproteins. The alternative promoters lack TATA-boxes and CpG islands. The upstream region
of exon 1b contains several features common for house keeping gene and monocyte specific gene
promoters.
Conclusion: Tissue-specific expression patterns of the alternative first exons of CD36 suggest that
the alternative first exons of the gene are regulated individually and tissue specifically. At the same
time, the fact that all first exons are upregulated in THP-1 macrophages in response to oxidized
low density lipoproteins may suggest that the alternative first exons are coregulated in this cell type
and environmental condition. The molecular mechanisms regulating CD36 thus appear to be
unusually complex, which might reflect the multifunctional role of the gene in different tissues and
cellular conditions.

Background
CD36 is an 88 kd glycoprotein expressed on the surface of
many cell types including adipocytes, skeletal muscle
cells, platelets, endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages. It is a membrane protein with a broad ligandbinding specificity and has been postulated to have a variety of functions in lipid transport, immune regulation,
hemostasis, signal transduction, adhesion, angiogenesis
and atherosclerosis (reviewed in [1-3]). The protein facilitates the membrane transport of long chain fatty acids
into muscle and adipose tissue, and CD36 deficiency is
associated with a large defect in fatty acid uptake [4].
CD36 is suggested to be involved in the metabolic pathways of insulin resistance [5,6], and it has a major role in
the uptake of modified lipoproteins in macrophage foam
cells found in atherosclerotic plaques [7].
The tissue specific expression pattern of CD36 is maintained by complex regulatory mechanisms whose molecular details are poorly understood. Interestingly, in tissues
central for the energy balance and metabolism (liver,
muscle and adipose tissue), the gene has been shown to
be regulated tissue specifically in response to specific stimuli such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
(PPAR-γ) and retinoid × receptor (RXR) ligands [8]. In diabetic rats, the thiazolidinedione Rosiglitazone significantly activates CD36 expression in adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle but not in liver, while the rexinoid
LG1002168 activates CD36 in liver and skeletal muscle
but not in adipose tissue [8]. Moreover, Type II CD36 deficiency indicates a strong tissue specific control of the gene
since the expression is lost on the surface of platelets of
affected patients but expressed intact in other tissues
[9,10].
Here we have investigated the expression profiles in different tissues and cell types of five alternative first exons of
the CD36 gene, one of which has not been presented
before, with the aim to characterize the alternative promoter usage of the gene and to better understand the
mechanisms behind its regulation. We have also performed an in silico characterization of the core promoters
of the alternative first exons.

Results
In silico identification of alternative first exons of cd36
Upon inspection of the upstream region of the human
CD36 gene relative to mappings of known transcripts
using the UCSC genome browser [11], we observed several transcribed sequences with different first exons compared to the first published CD36 mRNA sequence [12].
Alternative first exons have previously been reported for
the gene [13-15], but the transcript with accession
number GenBank:BG944316 has to our knowledge not
been analyzed before. The five alternative first exons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/8

included in this study are located in a region that spans
from 44.7 to 8.5 kilo bases upstream of the translational
start site in exon 3.
The nomenclature used for the alternative first exons of
CD36 varies between the publications describing the
alternative first exons. For clarity we will follow the
nomenclature presented in [15], where exon 1a corresponds to the EST sequence with accession number [GenBank:DA741325], exon 1b corresponds to the RefSeq
sequence
with
accession
number
[GenBank:NM_000072], exon 1c corresponds to the RefSeq
sequence
with
accession
number
[GenBank:NM_001001547], exon 1e corresponds to the alternative first exon annotated on the sequence with
accession number [GenBank:AF266759] and exon 1f
denotes the new alternative first exon identified in this
work corresponding to the EST sequence with accession
number [GenBank:BG944316] (figure 1).
Primers for real time RT-PCR analysis were successfully
designed for the alternative first exons (table 1), and these
primers produced specific PCR products of correct sizes
(figure 2). The efficiencies of the primer pairs were high
(above 85%) and comparable for all primer pairs.

Expression levels of the alternative first exons in human
tissue samples
We investigated the relative transcription levels of the different exons in tissues with a central role in energy metabolism: liver, fat and muscle (heart and skeletal) where the
role of CD36 in free fatty acid (FFA) transport is central, as
well as in placenta, spinal cord, cerebrum, HepG2 cells,
THP-1 cells and monocytes. Exons 1a, 1b, 1c, 1e and the
translated part of the gene were most highly expressed in
adipose tissue (figure 3). The novel exon 1f was most
highly expressed in the monocyte sample, which also
expressed relatively high levels of exon 1b, 1e and the
translated part of the gene here analyzed. The expression
levels of alternative first exons 1a and 1c were relatively
high also in heart.

A semi-quantitative analysis showed that the expression
patterns across the alternative first exons of CD36 varied
markedly between the tissues (figure 4). The novel exon 1f
and the previously described exon 1e were found to be

expressed at medium high levels in adipose tissue and
monocytes but in low levels in all other tissues analyzed,
in a few tissues not even detectable.
Variation in expression levels of the alternative first exons
in monocyte samples from different individuals
We investigated if there were individual variations in
expression levels of the CD36 mRNA isoforms in different
monocyte samples. Quantitative expression analysis performed for one alternative exon at a time using RNA from
ten monocyte samples showed that there were considerable differences in expression levels between individuals
(except for in exon 1c that was not detected in any of the
monocyte samples) (figure 5). Correlation analysis
showed that the expression pattern of exon 1b across the
human monocyte samples was significantly correlated to
the expression pattern of the translated part of the gene (r
= 0.78, p < 0.05). The expression patterns of the other
alternative first exons were not significantly correlated to
the expression pattern of the translated part of the gene.

with oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) [16,17],
but through what regulatory mechanism has not yet been
established. To analyze if a subset of the alternative first
exons is responsible for this upregulation, we performed
expression analysis in THP-1 macrophages (differentiated
from monocytes by stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA for
24 hours) after exposure to oxLDL. THP-1 cells under
basal conditions expressed exon 1b most strongly, while
exons 1a, 1e and 1f were expressed at lower levels and
exon 1c was not detectable (figure 4). After 24 hours exposure of THP-1 cells with a highly oxidized LDL preparation (TBARS 108, see materials and methods), the
expression of all the mRNA isoforms present in the cells
under basal conditions increased 3-fold to 6-fold (figure

6), which correlates to the 3-fold increase in exon 3–4
expression after the same treatment. The data indicated
that all alternative first exons of CD36 were close to proportionally upregulated in response to oxLDL, suggesting
that a regulatory mechanism in response to oxLDL affects
the whole gene locus. Oxidized LDL with TBARS 49 and
TBARS 18 appeared to have a small effect, whereas normal
LDL had no effect. The same trend in expression patterns
was observed also after 6 hours of exposure to the different preparations of oxLDL, although to a lower level.

sample "1".

Core promoter structure analysis of the alternative first
exons
The result of the promoter analysis is summarized in figure 7. Mapping of start positions of all expressed sequence
tag (EST) sequences in GenBank to the genomic
sequences corresponding to the alternative first exons
showed that exon 1b and 1c have broad promoters with
extended transcription start sites (TSS). Although both
exon 1b and 1c have one preferred transcription start site
each, EST sequence start positions were mapped out both
upstream and downstream of the preferred start sites,
indicating that the exons may have start sites distributed
over up to 100 base pairs each or more. For exon 1b, four
clusters of cap-analysis gene expression (CAGE) tags were
also present in the CAGE basic viewer provided by
FANTOM3 [18,19], coinciding with three of the most

common EST sequence start sites extracted from GenBank. For a detailed view of figure 7, with tissue origin of
the EST sequences mapped to the genomic sequence, see
Additional file 1. No potential transcription start sites
were observed downstream of the PCR primers used in
our expression analysis.
Most of the alternative first exons lack a TATA box. There
is one TATA box-like sequence at position 28–21 base pair
upstream of exon 1b, which is too close to the TSS of the
reference cDNA. CpG islands were not detected in or
around any of the analyzed sequences.

Discussion
Phenotypic complexity of higher eukaryotes is generally
believed to be achieved by a more complex regulation of
a larger protein repertoire, compared with simpler organisms. The protein diversity in higher organisms results not
only from a higher number of genes encoded in the
genome, but to a large extent also from alternative splicing
of pre-mRNA which generates multiple proteins encoded
by the same gene [20]. Transcriptional and regulatory
complexity of higher eukaryotes can be further increased
by alternative promoters and transcription start sites that
are used tissue or developmental specifically, and thus
provide means of a complex regulation of the genes [21].
The existence of alternative promoters appears to be a
common feature in mammalian genomes. Landry et al
estimated that 18% of the genes in the human genome
bare evidence of alternative promoter usage [22]. The
FANTOM consortium recently concluded from their large
data set of transcription initiation and termination sites in
mouse that there are 1.3 five prime start sites for each
three prime end and 1.83 three prime ends for each five
prime start, indicating that the mammalian transcriptome
is more complex than previously estimated [19]. As most
microarray technologies for analyzing gene expression
data only consider one or a subset of all possible splice
variants of a gene, information on which alternative first
exons contribute to the expression of a gene is often
missed in these analyses.
The multifunctional activities of CD36 present in several
cell types and tissues suggest that modulation of CD36
expression might lead to a series of potential beneficial or
harmful effects in for example atherosclerosis, inflammation, lipid homeostasis, insulin resistance, and angiogenesis, to name a few. However, with few exceptions [14],
reports of altered expression of CD36 under different conditions in different cell types have been based on analyses
targeting the coding regions of the gene, and has not considered alternative transcription start sites. Any attempt to
deduce the regulatory mechanisms and pathways behind
an observed expression in a cell type or tissue requires
knowledge of which alternative first exons and promoters
that are involved.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/8

We have identified and confirmed the expression of 5
alternative first exons of CD36, all expressed in more than
one tissue. Exon 1c was recently described by Noushmehr
et al [15], who confirmed its expression in skeletal muscle
and islets. Zingg et al [13] described and confirmed the
expression of exon 1e in smooth muscle cells and atherosclerotic plaques. Sato et al [14] confirmed the expression
of exon 1a in HepG2 cells and exons 1a and 1b in THP-1
cells. According to our data, the levels of expression of the
alternative first exons appear to vary between tissues, suggesting that the alternative promoters are regulated tissue
specifically.
Expression analysis of the alternative first exons across 10
monocyte samples show that there is a considerable difference in expression levels between individuals and that
the expression patterns across the monocyte samples are
correlated for exon 1b and the translated part of the gene.
This is not surprising since exon 1b is the dominant first
exon in monocytes and therefore contributes most to the
total CD36 expression in this cell type. The differences in
expression levels between individuals may indicate that
there are genetic variations between the individuals in the
CD36 locus, affecting either regulatory elements of the
gene or the stability of the mRNA molecules, perhaps due
to untranslated region (UTR) variations.
Alternative promoter usage may not only provide means
of an intricate tissue specific regulation of a gene, but
could also provide a way of activating a gene in response
to various environmental stimuli. It was for example
shown by Sato et al [14] that THP-1 cells under basal conditions express the CD36 gene both from exon 1b and
exon 1a, but only exon 1a was upregulated in the cells in
response to PPAR-γ and-α [14]. CD36 is upregulated in
THP-1 macrophages also in response to stimulation with
oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) [16]. We studied the expression patterns of the alternative first exons of
CD36 in THP-1 macrophages after stimulation with
oxLDL to analyze if this upregulation occurred through
specific alternative first exons. Our results indicate that the
activation of CD36 transcription in THP-1 macrophages
in response to oxLDL affect all alternative first exons proportionally, although the absolute effect is greatest from
exon 1b since this exon is most active in THP-1 cells under
basal conditions. It is therefore possible that the upregulation of CD36 in response to oxLDL in THP-1 macrophages occurs through a locus control mechanism rather
than through a specific regulatory element in one of the
alternative
promoters.
There are examples in the literature where transcripts from
alternative promoters have shown different translational
efficiencies, providing post-transcriptional regulation
[23]. For CD36 it has been observed that the mRNA tran-

script starting from exon 1b show increased translational
efficiency in response to high glucose levels, primary due
to reinitiation of translation after the translation of an
upstream untranslated open reading frame (uORF) [24].
We analyzed the 5' untranslated regions of the CD36 transcripts starting with exon 1a, 1c, 1e and 1f, and observed
that they all contain at least 2 uORFs upstream of the open
reading frame corresponding to the CD36 protein. It can
not be excluded that also these transcripts are under a
tight translational regulation through similar mechanisms
as for exon 1b, either through formation of secondary
structures of the mRNA molecules or by uORF usage.
Alternative splicing is described also for internal exons of
CD36. Tang et al showed that exon skipping of exons 4 to
5 results in a CD36 isoform lacking amino acid residues
41 to 143 [25]. Kern et al observed a total of 13 alternatively spliced transcripts of the CD36 gene in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and they observed
exon skipping of up to 10 out of 12 amino acid coding
exons in 8 of the alternative transcripts [26]. Taylor et al
described a transcript with an alternative exon 2 (denoted
2b) joined to the common exon 3. Our reverse PCR primers were designed in exon 2a [27], which is found in all
but one EST or mRNA sequences in GenBank, while the
alternative exon 2b is represented by only one reported
mRNA (GenBank: L06850) [27] that lacks exon 1.
The features of the alternative core promoter regions,
identified in our in silico analysis of the upstream regions
of the alternative first exons, are partly consistent with the
expression patterns of the alternative first exons. According to our expression analysis as well as to the EST
sequences available in GenBank, exon 1b is expressed in a
vide variety of tissues and cell types much like a house
keeping gene, and it is highly expressed in monocytes.
The mapping of start positions of EST sequences to the
genomic sequence of the alternative first exons of CD36,
as well as CAGE tag data for exon 1b, indicates that exons
1b and 1c may have extended transcription start sites. It
has been observed that housekeeping genes and monocyte and macrophage specific genes often have multiple
transcription start sites in a region that can span more
than 100 base pairs (Carninci, Sandelin, Lenhard et al,
submitted). It cannot be ruled out that the apparent
extended transcription start sites of exon 1b and 1c of
CD36 may reflect artefacts due to incomplete cDNA construction, since library construction information is not
available for all of the EST sequences used in our in silico
analysis. However, for exon 1b, EST sequences starting
upstream of the known 5' site determined with 5'RACE
[12] were found, which suggests that the observations can
not be all explained by artefacts. The start positions of the
EST sequences can however not be assumed to precisely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/8

correspond to true transcription start sites. The four clusters of start sites corresponding to exon 1b in the CAGE
basic viewer [18] correspond to transcription start sites
determined by cap analysis gene expression [28] and confirms that several transcription start sites exist for exon 1b.
Housekeeping genes and monocyte and macrophage specific genes often lack TATA-boxes (Carninci, Sandelin,
Lenhard et al., submitted). There is a TATA-box -like
sequence in front of exon 1b, but since it is located closer
to the major start site of the exon than the optimal spacing
of 30–32 base pairs it is unlikely to be functional with
respect to that start site. However, the TATA-box like
sequence is located 30–32 base pairs upstream of the EST
start positions adjacent to the major start site, which
means that it might be functional with respect to those
start sites.
A PPAR-α binding site was annotated in the upstream
region of exon 1b in the UCSC genome browser. This
PPAR response element has been shown to be functional
in vitro for PPAR-γ using super shift and reporter construct
analysis [29].
The upstream region of exon 1b contain a high number of
SPI-1 sites which are often clustered in the promoter
regions of monocyte specific genes, and using Gibbs motif
sampler we identified an overrepresented motif containing the element "CAGA", which is another typical promoter element of monocyte specific genes. In silico
predictions of SPI-1 sites are unfortunately fairly unreliable since the sites are very short and are thus often falsely
predicted in silico. Several SPI-1 sites were found also in
the promoters of the other alternative first exons,
although these exons are hardly expressed in monocytes,
illustrating this problem. However, it is still possible that
the cluster of evolutionary conserved SPI-1 sites and
"CAGA" elements can trigger the high expression of exon
1b in monocytes, but without further experimental analyses the significance of these elements remains unknown.
Taken together, despite the lack of a CpG island which is
often present in the upstream region of a housekeeping
gene, the exon 1b promoter has many characteristics of
both a house keeping gene promoter and a promoter of a
monocyte-specific gene, which is consistent with the
expression pattern of this exon.
To further investigate the possibility that the CD36 gene
might be regulated by a locus-control mechanism that
extends to neighbouring genes, we inspected the genomic
region in the vicinity of CD36 for the presence of genes
that are involved in similar biological processes. Some of
the genes are expressed predominantly in tissues where
CD36 is highly expressed such as muscle (putative homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PHTF2) and calcium channel,

voltage-dependent, alpha 2/delta subunit 1(CACNA2D1))
and heart (CACNA2D1). However, most of the genes in
the vicinity of CD36 are, to our knowledge, not involved
in the same biological processes or conditions as CD36,
except the gene coding for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).
A strong association has been observed between serum
levels of HGF and the metabolic syndrome [30], although
it is unclear if the molecular mechanism for this is related
to the function of CD36.

Conclusion
We have shown that human CD36 can be expressed from
five alternative first exons, all of which are expressed in
more than one tissue. The alternative first exons of CD36
appear to be regulated differently in different tissues indicating tissue specific promoters. At the same time, all alternative first exons are upregulated in THP-1 macrophages
in response to oxLDL, suggesting that there may be regulatory mechanisms operating on a locus control level in
this cell type for this stimulus. This suggests that the
molecular mechanisms regulating the CD36 gene are unusually complex, which could reflect the multifunctional
role of CD36 in different tissues and conditions. In the
present study we have established a draft map of how the
alternative first exons of CD36 are used in a set of human
tissues. CD36 is involved in markedly diverse disorders
and we anticipate that the presented information will be
valuable for further understanding the regulation of the
gene, as well as the interpretation of effects of non-coding
genetic variation associated with altered expression levels
of the gene and disease susceptibility.

medium.
Cell culture
The human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1 was
cultured in 10% FCS-RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in standard tissue culture flasks in humidified
air/CO2 (19:1) at 37°C. Cell density was kept between
0.2 and 1 million cells/ml. To differentiate THP-1 monocytes into THP-1 macrophages, cells were plated at 4 × 105
cells/ml and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA for 24 hours
[31]. Cells were washed twice with PBS before adding
fresh medium and growing for 24 hours.
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) preparation and oxidation
Human LDL was prepared as described [31]. Briefly, LDL
was isolated by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation using KBr solution (1.030–1.053 g/ml) and dialyzed against PBS. LDL was quantified by measuring ApoB
content, using the Bradford assay [31]. Preparations were
stored in the dark at 4°C and used within 4 days. For oxidation, LDL (500 µg/ml) were exposed to ultra violet irradiation at 254 nm for a specified time (one to five hours),
then sterilized by filtration (0.45µM). Extent of oxidation
was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), using malondialdehyde
(MDA) standard. TBARS were recorded as nmol MDA per
mg LDL protein. LDL, Ox-LDL (50 µg/ml) or PBS carrier
was added to THP-1 cells in fresh culture medium 24
hours after the PMA was washed away from the cells, follow by incubation for up to 24 hours

lent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Preparation of cDNA
Total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with
200 units of SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase per reaction, oligo (dT) 20VN primer (manufactured by MWG
biotech) and 46°C extension temperature.
Quantification of expression of alternative first exons
Primer design
Primers and TaqMan probes for Real Time RT-PCR analysis of exon 1b, 1a, 1c, 1e and 3 were designed and manufactured by the ABI assays-by-design service (Applied
Biosystems). Primers and probe for analysis of exon 1f
were designed using the primer express primer design tool
(Applied Biosystems) and manufactured by Applied Biosystems. For all targets, a forward PCR primer was
designed in each 1st exon with a corresponding reverse
primer in exon 2a [27]. TaqMan probes were designed on
the boundary between the 1st and 2nd exon, except for
the analysis of exon 1f where the probe was designed in
exon 2. For the analysis of the transcribed part of the gene,
a forward PCR primer was designed in the translated part
of exon 3, and the corresponding reverse primer was
designed in exon 4. The TaqMan probe was designed on
the boundary between the two exons. Primers for the
house-keeping gene acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0
(RPLP0) [32] were manufactured by Thermo Electron. All
primer and probe sequences are presented in table 1.

The efficiencies of the primer pairs were obtained by creating dilution series of cDNA and determining the Ct
value for each dilution. Ct values versus log cDNA concentration were plotted and the efficiency of each primer pair
was calculated using the slope of the curve, according to:
E primerpair = 10(-1/slope) - 1[33]
Real time RT-PCR
Quantification of the expression of the alternative first
exons of CD36 was performed by TaqMan real time semiquantitative RT-PCR using an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence
Detection System instrument and software (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were performed according to the
manufacturer's protocol, using TaqMan Universal Master
Mix with UNG, but in 25 µl reaction volumes. All samples
were analyzed in triplicates, and at least one negative control was used for each analysis. Standard curves were prepared using dilution series of cDNA prepared as described
above.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/8

Data analysis
Both the standard curve method and the ∆∆Ct method
(described by Applied Biosystems in the User Bulletin #2
ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System [34]) were
used to perform quantitative relative expression analysis.
Relative expression levels of the transcripts in different
samples were compared quantitatively for one alternative
first exon at a time and only for samples run in the same
PCR setup, to avoid artefacts due to differences in PCR
setup or primer efficiency. The expression level of a target
transcript was in each sample normalized to the expression level of RPLP0 to compensate for differences in RNA
loading, and relative expression levels of a transcript in
the different samples were obtained by calibrating the
normalized expression values of the samples with the normalized expression value of a reference sample. The reference samples were "heart" in figure 3, "monocyte 1" in
figure 5, and "untreated macrophages" in figure 6.

In order to make a rough estimation of the relative expression levels of the five alternative first exons in all the analyzed samples, i.e. an inter assay comparison, a heat map
of the Ct values obtained from the RT-PCR analysis of the
alternative first exons was created, using cDNA corresponding to 70 ng of total RNA for each sample and using
the same Ct-threshold on all plates.
The Spearman Rank Correlation of the expression profiles
of the alternative first exons in 10 monocyte samples was
calculated using the StatView software (SAS), on the relative expression values shown in figure 5 for the alternative
first exons and the translated part of the gene. P values of
< 0.05 were considered significant.
In silico characterization of the upstream regions of the
alternative first exons
Sequences stretching from 500 base pairs upstream of
each alternative first exon to approximately 100 bp downstream of the respective exon were extracted from the
UCSC genome browser [11] and used for the in silico promoter analysis. Start positions of all EST sequences from
GenBank for CD36 were mapped to the extracted
sequences. Transcription start site information for the
alternative first exons was also extracted from the CAGE
basic viewer provided by FANTOM3 [18,19]. The degree
of evolutionary conservation around the transcribed
region was determined using human and mouse alignments available in the UCSC genome browser [11]. A sliding window of 50 base pairs was used to score every
position in the alignment, and positions in the sequence
with more than 70 % similarity between the species were
considered conserved. Putative TFBSs were mapped out
using position specific weight matrix representations of
the TFBSs, using the TRANSFAC database of transcription
factor matrix profiles and the MatInspector search tool

[35] or the JASPAR database [36] with the search tool
implemented in Consite [37]. Evolutionary conserved
putative transcription factor binding sites were also
fetched from the UCSC genome browser [11] and
mapped out on the sequences. Gibbs Motif Sampler [38]
was used to discover overrepresented sequence patterns
within the upstream region of respective promoter.
