Background: The BTB domain (also known as the POZ domain) is a versatile protein-protein
interaction motif that participates in a wide range of cellular functions, including transcriptional
regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion channel assembly and gating, and targeting proteins for
ubiquitination. Several BTB domain structures have been experimentally determined, revealing a
highly conserved core structure.

The BTB domain (also known as the POZ domain) was originally identified as a conserved motif present in the Drosophila melanogaster bric-à-brac, tramtrack and broad
complex transcription regulators and in many pox virus zinc
finger proteins [1-4]. A variety of functional roles have been

identified for the domain, including transcription repression
[5,6], cytoskeleton regulation [7-9], tetramerization and gating of ion channels [10,11] and protein ubiquitination/degradation [12-17]. Recently, BTB proteins have been identified in
screens for interaction partners of the Cullin (Cul)3 Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, with the

Conclusion: Despite widely divergent sequences, the BTB fold is structurally well conserved. The
fold has adapted to several different modes of self-association and interactions with non-BTB
proteins.

refereed research

Results: We surveyed the protein architecture, genomic distribution and sequence conservation
of BTB domain proteins in 17 fully sequenced eukaryotes. The BTB domain is typically found as a
single copy in proteins that contain only one or two other types of domain, and this defines the
BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF), BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK), voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv),
MATH-BTB, BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) families of proteins, among others. In
contrast, the Skp1 and ElonginC proteins consist almost exclusively of the core BTB fold. There
are numerous lineage-specific expansions of BTB proteins, as seen by the relatively large number
of BTB-ZF and BBK proteins in vertebrates, MATH-BTB proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans, and
BTB-NPH3 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the structural homology between Skp1 and the
PLZF BTB homodimer, we present a model of a BTB-Cul3 SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that
shows that the BTB dimer or the T1 tetramer is compatible in this complex.

Comparison of structures containing the BTB fold
Comparison of structures containing the BTB fold. (a) Superposition of the BTB core fold from currently known BTB structures. The BTB core fold
(approximately 95 residues) is retained across four sequence families. The BTB-ZF, Skp1, ElonginC and T1 families are represented here by the domains
from Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures 1buo:A, 1fqv:B, 1vcb:B, 1t1d:A. (b) Schematic of the BTB fold topology. The core elements of the BTB fold are
labeled B1 to B3 for the three conserved β-strands, and A1 to A5 for the five α-helices. Many families of BTB proteins are of the 'long form', with an
amino-terminal extension of α1 and β1. Skp1 proteins have two additional α-helices at the carboxyl terminus, labeled α7 and α8. The dashed line
represents a segment of variable length that is often observed as strand β5 in the long form of the domain, and as an α-helix in Skp1. (c) Structure-based
multiple sequence alignment of representative BTB domains from each of the BTB-ZF, Skp1, ElonginC and T1 families. The core BTB fold is boxed.
Secondary structure is indicated by red shading for α-helices and yellow for β-strands, with the amino- and carboxy-terminal extensions shaded in gray.
The low complexity sequences, which are disordered in the Skp1 structures, are indicated by open triangles. See Figure 3 for the PDB codes for the
corresponding sequences.

BTB domain mediating recruitment of the substrate recognition modules to the Cul3 component of the SCF-like complex
[18-20]. In most of these functional classes, the BTB domain
acts as a protein-protein interaction module that is able to
both self-associate and interact with non-BTB proteins.
Several BTB structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography, establishing the structural similarity between
different examples of the fold. We use the Structural Classifi-

cation of Proteins (SCOP) database terminology of 'fold' to
describe the set of BTB sequences that are known or predicted
to share a secondary structure arrangement and topology,
and the term 'family' to describe more highly related
sequences that are likely to be functionally similar [21]. Thus,
the BTB domain in BTB-zinc finger (ZF), Skp1, ElonginC and
voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv) proteins all contain the BTB fold, even though some of these differ in their
peripheral secondary structure elements and are involved in

different types of protein-protein associations. For example,
BTB domains from the BTB-ZF family contain an amino-terminal extension and form homodimers [5,22], whereas the
Skp1 proteins contain a family-specific carboxy-terminal
extension and occur as single copies in heterotrimeric SCF
complexes [23-26]. The ElonginC proteins are also involved
in protein degradation pathways, although these proteins
consist only of the core BTB fold and are typically less than
20% identical to the Skp1 proteins [27,28]. Finally, T1
domains in T1-Kv proteins consist only of the core fold and
associate into homotetramers [11,29]. Thus, while the structures of BTB domains show good conservation in overall tertiary structure, there is little sequence similarity between
members of different families. As a result, the BTB fold is a
versatile scaffold that participates in a variety of types of family-specific protein-protein interactions.

Sequence conservation in BTB domains
Sequence conservation in BTB domains. The most probable sequences (majority-rule consensus sequences) from each of seven different family-specific
hidden Markov models (HMMs) were generated with HMMER hmmemit. Residue positions with a probability score (P(s)) of less than 0.6 are variable and
are indicated by dots, residues with 0.6 < P(s) < 0.8 have intermediate levels of sequence conservation and are indicated by lower case letters, and
residues with a P(s) > 0.8 are highly conserved and are indicated by capital letters. Gray shading indicates positions that are similar in at least four of the
seven families shown, and selected 'signature sequences' that are particular to a specific family are boxed in blue. Gaps are indicated by blank spaces.
Residue positions that are buried in the core of the BTB fold are indicated with black circles, and contact sites for four known protein-protein interaction
surfaces are shown in the grid below the alignment. The secondary structure elements β1, α1, α4, β5, α7 and α8 occur only in some of the families, and
are discussed in the text. Additional Data File 1 includes multiple sequence alignments for these families.

of this fold. An earlier study [30] is consistent with many of
the results presented here, and we contribute an expanded
structure and genome-centric analysis of BTB domain proteins, with an emphasis on the scope of protein-protein interactions in these proteins. Our results should be useful for the
structural and functional prediction by analogy for some of
the less-well characterized BTB domain families.

Results and discussion
BTB fold comparisons
We began our analysis with a comparison of the solved structures of BTB domains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [31],
which included examples from BTB-ZF proteins, Skp1, ElonginC and T1 domains (Figures 1, 2, 3). A three-dimensional
superposition showed a common region of approximately 95
amino acids consisting of a cluster of 5 α-helices made up in
part of two α-helical hairpins (A1/A2 and A4/A5), and capped
at one end by a short solvent-exposed three stranded β-sheet
(B1/B2/B3; Figure 1). An additional hairpin-like motif consisting of A3 and an extended region links the B1/B2/A1/A2/
B3 and A4/A5 segments of the fold. Because of the presence
or absence of secondary structural elements in certain examples of the fold, we use the designation A1–A5 for the five conserved α-helices, and B1–B3 for the three common β-strands.
We refer to this structure as the core BTB fold. When present,
other secondary structure elements are named according to
the labels assigned to the original structures. Thus, the BTBZF family members the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger
(PLZF) and B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) contain additional
amino-terminal elements, which are referred to as β1 and α1,
Skp1 protein contains two additional carboxy-terminal helices labeled α7 and α8, ElonginC is missing the A5 terminal
helix, and the T1 structures from Kv proteins are formed
entirely of the core BTB fold (Figures 1 and 2). Sequence comparisons based on the structure superpositions show less than
10% identity between examples from different families,
except for Skp1 and ElonginC, which is in the range of 14% to
22%; however, all structures show remarkable conservation
with Root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.0 to 2.0
Å over at least 95 residues (Figure 3). Despite these very low
levels of sequence relatedness, 15 positions show significant
conservation across all of the structures, and 12 of these correspond to residues that are buried in the monomer core (Figure 2). Most of these highly conserved residues are
hydrophobic and are found between B1 and A3, with some

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/10/R82

examples in A4. In addition to this common set, conserved
residues are also found within specific families (Figure 2),
and some of these participate in family-specific protein-protein interactions.
The four known structural classes of BTB domains show different oligomerization or protein-protein interaction states
involving different surface-exposed residues (Figures 2 and
4). There is little overlap between the interaction surfaces of
the homodimeric, heteromeric and homotetrameric forms of
the domain, which are represented here by examples from the
BTB-ZF, Skp1/ElonginC and T1 families, respectively. Contacts involving the amino-terminal extensions of the BTB-ZF
class and the carboxy-terminal elements of the Skp1 families
form a significant fraction of the residues involved in proteinprotein interaction in each of those respective systems, but
additional contributions from the 95 residue core BTB fold
are involved. There are multiple examples of conserved surface-exposed residues that participate in family-specific protein-protein interactions. For example, the B1/B2/B3 sheet is
found in all BTB structures and, therefore, is part of the core
BTB fold, but participates in very different protein interactions in the T1 homotetramers, the ElonginC/ElonginB and
Skp1-Cul1 structures. Inspection of T1 residues in this area
shows sequences such as the 'FFDR' motif in B3 have
diverged from the other BTB families to become important
components of the tetramerization interface [29] (Figure 2).
In Skp1, B3 has a distinctive 'PxPN' motif that is involved in
Cul1 interactions [24] (Figure 2). Thus, the solvent-exposed
surface of the BTB fold is extremely variable between families, forming the basis for the wide range of protein-protein
interactions.
The connection between A3 and A4 (drawn as a dashed line in
Figure 1b) is variable in length and in structure, and makes
key contributions to several different types of protein-protein
interactions. The region adopts an extended loop structure in
the T1 domain and ElonginC, where it makes important contributions to the homotetramerization and to the von HippelLindau (VHL) interfaces, respectively (Figure 4). In PLZF and
BCL6, this segment forms strand β5 and associates with β1
from the partner chain to form a two-stranded antiparallel
sheet at the 'floor' of the homodimer [5,22]. In Skp1, this
region includes a large disordered segment followed by a
unique helix α4, but it is not involved in any protein-protein
interactions [23-26].

Representation of BTB domains in fully sequenced
genomes
We searched the Ensembl and Uniprot databases for BTB
proteins [32,33]. In order to effectively eliminate redundant
sequences and partial fragments, and to reduce sampling bias
due to uneven database representation, we limited our search
to the known and predicted transcripts from 17 fully
sequenced genomes. We carried out HMMER [34] searches
with a panel of hidden Markov models (HMMs) describing
the four known families of BTB structures. As expected from
the low sequence similarities, searches with family-specific
HMMs could not retrieve sequences from the other families
in a single iteration. For example, the HMM trained on the
BTB domains from BTB-ZF proteins could not immediately
retrieve sequences from T1-Kv proteins. Additional
sequences were added to each of the family-specific HMMs in
several cycles, and the results were compiled into final multiple sequence alignments. The retrieved sequences were manually inspected and class-specific HMMs were used to define
the start/end sites of specific families of BTB domains. We
have assembled this collection of over 2,200 non-redundant
BTB domain sequences in a publicly available database [35].
In addition to the genome-centric analyses, we searched the
NCBI nr database with PSI-BLAST [36,37]. Beginning with
the sequence of the BTB domain from the BTB-ZF protein
PLZF, T1 sequences were retrieved with e-values below 10
after four PSI-BLAST iterations carried out with a generous
inclusion threshold of 0.1, as previously reported [30]. Skp1
and ElonginC sequences could not be retrieved with e-values
below 10 starting with BTB-ZF or T1 sequences, even with a
PSI-BLAST inclusion threshold of 1.0. Based on searches with
representative BTB sequences from each of the major families, BTB sequences were consistently retrieved from eukaryotes and poxviruses, but no examples from bacteria or
archaea were found (data not shown), with the remarkable
exception of 43 BTB-leucine-rich repeat proteins in the
Parachlamydia-related endosymbiont UWE25 [38]. In general, plant and animal genomes encode from 70 to 200 distinct BTB domain proteins, while only a handful of examples
are found in the unicellular eukaryotes. We identified an
intermediate number, 41, in the social amoeba Dictyostelium
discoideum [39] (Figure 5).
The distribution of BTB families varies widely according to
species (Figure 5). The overall number of BTB domain
proteins and their family distribution is similar in the mammalian and fish genomes that we considered, with 25 to 50
examples from each of the BTB-ZF, BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK)
and T1-Kv families, and another 40 to 50 proteins with other
architectures. We expect that this distribution is similar
across all vertebrate genomes. The family distribution in the
insects (as exemplified by Drosophila and Anopheles) is generally similar to that of the vertebrates, but with fewer overall
examples. In contrast, Caenorhabditis elegans contains very
few BTB-ZF and BBK proteins, but a large number of meprin

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/10/R82

and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor homology (MATH)-BTB and Skp1 proteins. In Arabidopsis, there
are 21 BTB-nonphototropic hypocotyl (NPH)3 proteins,
which appear to be a plant-specific architecture. Only five and
six BTB domain proteins were found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively.
Based on these observations, the domain most likely underwent domain shuffling followed by lineage-specific expansion
(LSE) during speciation events. The most commonly
observed architecture across several different families consists of a single amino-terminal BTB domain, a middle linker
region, and a characteristic carboxy-terminal domain that is
often present as a set of tandem repeats (Figure 6). Along with
domain shuffling and domain accretion, LSE is considered
one of the major mechanisms of adaptation and generation of
novel protein functions in eukaryotes, and is frequently seen
in proteins involved in cellular differentiation and in the
development of multicellular organisms [40]. For example,
both BTB-ZF proteins and Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)ZF proteins have essential roles in development and tissue
differentiation and have undergone LSE in the vertebrate lineage [30,41,42].

BTB sequence clusters
We attempted to construct a phylogeny based on BTB domain
sequences, but we could not consistently cluster the entire
collection. Due to the very low levels of sequence similarity
between some of the families (Figure 3), we were unable to
support phylogenies with significant bootstrap values despite
many attempts with several different approaches and algorithms, including distance, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood methods.
We eventually turned to BLASTCLUST as a more appropriate
tool to subdivide this highly divergent set of sequences [37]
(Figure 6). BTB domain sequence/structure families correlate with the protein architectures, and the BTB-NPH3, T1,
Skp1 and ElonginC families could be distinguished at an identity threshold of 30% with this method. Domain sequences
from BTB-ZF, BBK, MATH-BTB and RhoBTB proteins
formed distinct clusters only at higher cutoffs, and are thus
more closely related (Figure 6). The BTB domain sequences
from vertebrate BTB-ZF and BBK proteins are more closely
related, and cannot be separated by BLASTCLUST.

Long form of the BTB domain
The majority of BTB domains from the BTB-ZF, BBK, MATHBTB, RhoBTB and BTB-basic leucine Zipper (bZip) proteins
contain a conserved region amino-terminal to the core region,
which likely forms a β1 and α1 structure as seen in PLZF
[22,43] and BCL6 [5]. We refer to this as the 'long form' of the
BTB domain, which has a total size of approximately 120 residues. Note that many of the protein domain databases, such
as Pfam [44], SMART [45] and Interpro [46], recognize only
the 95 residue core BTB fold, and do not detect all of these

BTB domain sequences also are more highly related to each
other than to the BTB-NPH3, T1, Skp1 and ElonginC families,
as based on the BLASTCLUST analysis (Figure 6). These

groupings were consistently observed even when only the residues from the core fold were included in the analysis, and so
the sequence clustering is not simply due to the presence or
absence of the amino-terminal elements. We predict that

domains can bind two promoter sites, but that the exact spacing and orientation of these sites is not critical, as long as they
are within a certain limiting distance. The linker is not without function, however, as it interacts with accessory proteins
that take part in chromatin remodeling and transcription
repression, such as the BCL6-mSin3A and PLZF-ETO interactions [6,58].

In addition to the architectural roles resulting from BTB-BTB
associations, many BTB domains in this family interact with

refereed research

Heteromeric BTB-BTB associations have been described
between certain pairs of BTB domains from this family,
including PLZF and Fanconi anemia zinc finger (FAZF) [65],
and between BCL6 and BCL6 associated zinc finger (BAZF)
[66]. Heteromer formation in BTB transcription factors may
be a mechanism for targeting these proteins to particular regulatory elements by combining different chain-associated
DNA binding domains in order to generate distinct DNA recognition specificities [67], as seen in retinoic acid receptor/
retinoid X receptor transcription factors [68].

deposited research

In nearly all BTB-ZF proteins, the long form BTB domain is at
or very near the amino terminus of the protein, and the Krüppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers are found towards the carboxyl terminus of the protein. These two regions are connected by a
long (100–375 residue) linker segment (Figure 6). Sequence
conservation is largely restricted to the BTB domain and the
carboxy-terminal ZF region, as exemplified by BCL6 from
human and zebrafish, which are 78%, 37% and 85% identical
across the BTB, linker and ZF regions, respectively. The linker
region frequently contains low complexity sequence and is
predicted to be unstructured in most cases. Except for proteins that are highly related over their full lengths, the linker
regions do not identify significant matches in sequence
searches of the NCBI nr set. This architecture suggests a
model in which the dimeric BTB domain connects the DNA
binding regions from each chain via long, mostly unstruc-

The BTB domains from some BTB-ZF proteins can mediate
higher order self-association [59-62], and the formation of
BTB oligomers in the BTB-ZF proteins has important implications for the recognition of multiple recognition sequences
on target genes. In Drosophila GAGA factor (GAF), oligomerization of BTB transcription factors is thought to be mechanistically important in regulating the transcriptional activity
of chromatin [61,62], and the BTB domain is essential in cooperative binding to DNA sites containing multiple GA target
sites [62]. Several other BTB transcription factors also bind to
multiple sites [52,60,63]. The formation of chains of BTB
dimers involving the β1/β5 'lower sheet' has been observed in
two different crystal forms of the PLZF BTB domain [22,43],
although the significance of this is unclear as BTB dimerdimer associations are very weak and are not observed in
solution under normal conditions (unpublished results and
[43]). Higher-order association could be a property of a subset of BTB domains, with GAF-BTB representing domains
that have a strong propensity for polymerization, whereas in
cases such as PLZF-BTB, the self-association of dimers is
observed only at very high local protein concentrations, such
as those required for crystal formation. Interestingly, many
Drosophila BTB domains have characteristic hydrophobic
sequences in the β1 and β5 regions [1]. In many of these, the
β1 region contains at least three large, hydrophobic residues
in a characteristic [FY]×[ILV]×[WY][DN][DN][FHWY]
sequence that is not present in BTB-ZF proteins from other
species. This conserved segment has high β-strand propensity, consistent with the presence of interchain β1 contacts
across dimers. Exposed hydrophobic residues in this sheet
region may drive strong dimer-dimer associations in these
Drosophila BTB-ZF proteins, an idea that is supported by
modeling studies [64].

reports

In the BTB-ZF setting, the domain mediates dimerization, as
shown by crystallographic studies of the BTB domains of
PLZF [22] and BCL6 [5]. This is confirmed in numerous solution studies [5,22,43,54-56]. An important component of the
hydrophobic dimerization interface in PLZF and BCL6 is the
association of the long form elements β1 and α1 from one
monomer with the core structure of the second monomer.
The dimerization interface has two components: an intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet formed between β1 from one
monomer and β5 of the other monomer; and the packing of α1
from one monomer against α1 and the A1/A2 helical hairpin
from the other monomer. The strand-exchanged amino terminus is likely to have arisen from a domain swapping mechanism [57]. We believe that most BTB domains from human
BTB-ZF proteins can dimerize, because 34 of these 43
domains are predicted to contain all of the necessary structural elements in the swapped interface including β1, α1 and
β5 (Additional data file 1). As well, many highly conserved
residues are found in predicted dimer interface positions
[22]. Nine human BTB-ZF proteins lack β1, and thus cannot
form the β1–β5 interchain antiparallel sheet, and we expect
that these domains are also dimeric due to the presence of α1
and the conservation of interface residues. In PLZF and
BCL6, the BTB domain forms obligate homodimers [5,22],
and disruption of the dimer interface results in unfoldfed,
non-functional protein [6].

non-BTB proteins, and this effect is central to their function
in transcriptional regulation. For example, BCL6 is able to
associate directly with nuclear co-repressor proteins such as
nuclear co-repressor (NCoR), silencing mediator for retinoid
and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and mSin3a
[5,58,69-73]. A 17 residue region of the SMRT co-repressor
binds directly with the BCL6 BTB domain in a 2:2 stoichiometric ratio in a complex that requires a BCL6 BTB dimer [5].
This peptide is an inhibitor of full-length SMRT, and reverses
the repressive activities of BCL6 in vivo [48]. Remarkably,
the interaction with this peptide appears to be specific to the
BCL6 BTB domain, and there is no significant sequence conservation in the BCL6 peptide binding groove relative to other
human BTB-ZF proteins. In these other proteins, this groove
may be a site for as yet uncharacterized BTB-peptide or BTBprotein interactions.
In all organisms studied, BTB domains from BTB-ZF proteins
show high conservation of the residues Asp35 and Arg/Lys49
(PLZF numbering; Additional data file 1). These residues are
found in a 'charged pocket' in the BTB structures of PLZF and
BCL6, and have been shown to be important in transcriptional repression [6,74]. The structure of the BCL6-BTBSMRT co-repressor complex, however, did not show
interactions between this region and the co-repressor [5].
Mutation of Asp35 and Arg49 disrupts the proper folding of
PLZF [6], and these residues are thus important for the structural integrity of the domain. Interestingly, Asp35 and Arg/
Lys49 are also conserved in the BTB domains from BBK,
MATH-BTB and BTB-NPH3 proteins (Figure 2 and Additional data file 1).

The BBK proteins
Many members of this widely represented family of proteins
are implicated in the stability and dynamics of actin filaments
[75-78]. With few exceptions, all of the 515 BTB-kelch
proteins in our database also contain the BTB and carboxyterminal kelch (BACK) domain. These BBK proteins are composed of a long-form BTB domain, the 130 residue BACK
domain [79], and a carboxy-terminal region containing four
to seven kelch motifs [80-82]. Most BBK proteins have a
region of approximately 25 residues that precede the BTB
domain, unlike BTB-ZF proteins where BTB is positioned
much closer to the amino terminus (Figure 6; Additional data
file 1). We predict that this amino-terminal region in the BBK
proteins is unstructured, although it is shown to have a functional role in some proteins [75]. Notably, the distribution of
BBK proteins parallels that of the BTB-ZF proteins across
genomes. We did not find BBK proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana or in the yeasts.
The sequences of BTB domains from BBK proteins are most
closely related to those from BTB-ZF proteins (Figure 6), suggesting that they adopt similar structures. Indeed, BTB
domains from BBK proteins have been shown to mediate
dimerization [75,83,84] and have conserved residues at posi-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/10/R82

tions equivalent to those at the dimer interface in BTB-ZF
proteins (Additional data file 1). There are reports of BTBmediated oligomerization in BBK proteins, consistent with
the role of some these proteins as organizers of actin filaments [75,77,84]. Because most of the BTB sequences from
BBK proteins are predicted to contain the β1, α1 and β5 long
form elements, oligomerization of these proteins may occur
via dimer-dimer associations involving the β1 sheet, as proposed for the BTB-ZF proteins. There are, however, no
strongly characteristic sequences or enrichment of hydrophobic residues in the β1 region.
In Pfam, the POZ domain superfamily (Pfam Clan CL0033)
includes BACK, BTB, Skp1 and K_tetra (T1) sequences [44].
The known structures of BTB, Skp1 and T1 domains show the
conserved BTB fold, and the inclusion of the BACK domain in
this Pfam Clan suggests that the BACK domain also adopts
this fold. Secondary structure predictions for BTB, Skp1 or T1
domain sequences, however, consistently reflect the known
mixed α/β content of the BTB fold, whereas the BACK
domain is predicted to contain only α-helices [79]. Further
clarification of this issue will require the experimental determination of the structure of the BACK domain.

Skp1
Skp1 is a critical component of Cul1-based SCF complex, and
forms the structural link between Cul1 and substrate recognition proteins [85-87]. Skp1 proteins are only distantly related
to other BTB families (Figures 3 and 6), and are composed of
the core BTB fold with two additional carboxy-terminal helices. These latter helices form the critical binding surface for
the F-box region of substrate-recognition proteins. Many
Skp1 sequences have low complexity insertions after A3,
which are disordered in several crystal structures, followed by
helix α4, which is unique to this family [23-26] (Figures 1 and
2). Skp1 proteins are found in all organisms studied, with significant expansions in C. elegans and A. thaliana (Figure 5).
Interestingly, the Cul1-interacting surface of Skp1 does not
overlap with the dimerization surface seen in BTB-ZF structures, and is mostly separate from the tetramerization surface
in the T1 domains (Figure 2; Additional data file 1). Therefore,
a unique surface of the BTB fold in the Skp1 proteins has
adapted to mediate interactions with Cul1.

ElonginC
ElonginC is an essential component of Cul2-based SCF-like
complexes, also known as VCB (for pVHL, ElonginC, ElonginB) or ECS (for ElonginC, Cul2, SOCS-box) E3 ligase
[88,89]. This protein serves as an adaptor between ElonginB
and the VHL tumor suppressor protein, which interacts with
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and targets it for degradation [89-92]. In any given organism, the sequence identity

found ElonginC proteins in all organisms studied (Figure 5).
Like Skp1, ElonginC is significantly similar to other BTB
sequence classes only in the buried positions of the monomer
core (Figure 2). A β-strand in the A3/A4 connecting region
participates in the ElonginC-VHL interaction, and the
sequence in this region is characteristic of ElonginC [28].

done with reasonable bootstrap values and shows a clear
demarcation between proteins from C. elegans and those
from all other species (data not shown). The domain in the C.
elegans proteins lacks several BTB signature sequences, such
as the 'AH[RK]XVLAA' signature in the B2-A1 region seen in
many other long form BTB families (Figure 2). The majority
of MATH-BTB proteins from all organisms are predicted to
contain the long form elements β1, α1 and β5 (Additional data
file 1) and we predict that these BTB domains are dimeric.
Indeed, biochemical and biological evidence suggest that
BTB-mediated dimerization of the MATH-BTB protein
maternal effect lethal (MEL)-26 is required for its function
[15,100].

information

MATH-BTB proteins differ from most other BTB families in
that the BTB domain is found carboxy-terminal to the partner
domain. Typically, there are an additional 75 to 100 amino
acids following the BTB domain that are likely to be structured and rich in α-helices (Additional data file 1). In contrast
to the BTB-ZF proteins, but similar to the BBK proteins,
MATH-BTB sequences are highly conserved across the full
lengths of the proteins. As a result of this conservation, phylogenetic clustering of the full-length protein sequences can be

Each of the vertebrate genomes considered here contain
genes for two BTB-bZip proteins, named BTB and CNC
homology (BACH)1 and BACH2 [104,105], except for Danio
rerio, which has three. These proteins are transcription factors and most closely resemble the BTB-ZF proteins in terms
of the BTB sequence and overall protein architecture. The
proteins consist of a long form BTB domain, a central region
of approximately 400 residues, and a carboxy-terminal basic
leucine zipper region (Figure 6). The close similarity of the
BTB sequences between the BTB-ZF and BTB-bZip proteins
suggest that these domains are likely to be similar in structure. Notably, the long form elements and β5 are predicted,
and dimerization residues are similar to the ZF class (data not
shown). Accordingly, the BACH proteins have been shown to
dimerize and oligomerize in a BTB-dependent manner [63].
bZip domains themselves are known to dimerize and, interestingly, the majority of bZip-containing proteins (550 of 738
Pfam bZip_1 domain) contain no other identified domains in

interactions

A large expansion of MATH-BTB proteins occurred in C. elegans, where 46 of 178 total BTB proteins belong to this family,
whereas other genomes contain many fewer of these proteins
(Figure 5). MATH proteins as a whole are largely expanded in
C. elegans, with 95 examples present in the Pfam database
[44]. The MATH domain is thought to be a substrate recognition module in Cul3-based SCF-like complexes [15,16].

refereed research

Another large expansion is found in Arabidopsis, which contains 21 BTB-NPH3 proteins, or over 25% of the BTB proteins
in this genome. BTB-NPH3 proteins are not found in any of
the other genomes that we considered, and could represent a
plant-specific adaptation of the BTB domain. BTB-NPH3 proteins are involved in phototropism in A. thaliana and are
thought to be adaptor proteins that bring together components of a signal transduction pathway initiated by the lightactivated serine/threonine kinase NPH1 [101,102]. Heteromerization of BTB-NPH3 proteins have been observed, and
the BTB domains of root phototropism (RPT)2 and NPH3
have been shown to interact [101,102]. In addition, the BTB
domain from RPT2 can interact with a region of phototropin
1 that contains light, oxygen and voltage sensing (LOV)
protein-protein interaction domains [103]. These proteins
consist of an amino-terminal BTB domain and an NPH3
domain (Figure 6). The BTB domains in this family are only
distantly related to other examples of the fold, and appear to
have two leading β-strands in a region preceding the core
fold, with an additional β-strand between A1 and A2 (Additional data file 1).

deposited research

Structurally, the T1 domain is composed of the core BTB fold
without any amino- or carboxy-terminal extensions (Figures
1 and 2; Additional data file 1). The T1 domain mediates
homo-tetramerization in numerous crystal structures
[11,29,98,99]. Despite the very low levels of sequence similarity to the other BTB domain families, several of the characteristic buried residues are conserved (Figure 2). It is striking
that most of the residues found in the polar tetramerization
contact surface in the T1 structures do not overlap with those
residues involved in dimerization in the BTB-ZF structures.
Of the 24 residues that are found in the T1 tetramer surface,
only 6 are common to the BTB-ZF dimer interface (Figure 2).
Thus, a unique set of residues has evolved in the T1 domain to
mediate tetramerization.

reports

The T1 domain from voltage-gated potassium channels modulates channel gating and assembly [10,29,95]. This domain
is a distant homolog to all other BTB domains, and segregates
into a unique cluster at less than 30% sequence identity with
BLASTCLUST. The T1 domain is found in a large number of
voltage-gated potassium channel proteins in all metazoan
genomes surveyed (Figure 5). T1 sequences have been classified according to their sequence similarity into nine Kv
families (Kv1 through Kv9) [96,97]. The full-length protein
sequences are composed of a disordered amino-terminal
region, the T1 domain, a transmembrane ion transduction
domain (Pfam PF00520), and a long carboxy-terminal region
with some predicted secondary structure (Figure 6).

proteins in the metazoan genomes, including mammalian
BTBD1, BTBD2, BTBD3 and BTBD6. We adopted the name
'PHR domain' for this motif and it has been added to the Pfam
database as accession PF08005.

The RhoBTB proteins

The BTB-ankyrin proteins

The Ras homology (Rho)BTB proteins have an unusual architecture, and contain a Rho GTPase domain near the amino
terminus, two tandem long form BTB domains, and an
approximately 100 residue carboxy-terminal tail with predicted α-helical content (Figure 6). These proteins are highly
conserved across their full-lengths, and three examples
(RhoBTB1, RhoBTB2/DBC2, RhoBTB3) are found in each of
the vertebrates included in this study [106-108]. One RhoBTB
protein is also present in the insects and in Dictyostelium
[107]. The first BTB domain of human RhoBTB2 has been
shown to interact with Cul3 [13] and contains a large 115 residue insertion between A2 and B3, while the second domain
is more typical and most closely resembles BTB domains from
BBK proteins. The tandem domains are immediately adjacent
and may form an intramolecular dimer.

Ankyrin repeats are common protein-protein interaction
motifs that are found in proteins of very diverse function,
such as transcription regulators, ion transporters and signal
transduction proteins [110,111]. We found examples of BTBankyrin proteins in each species that we considered,
although, unlike other BTB domain families, these proteins
do not fit a single canonical arrangement. For example, some
BTB-ankyrin proteins are composed of an amino-terminal
BTB domain, a central helical region, 19 ankyrin repeats and
a carboxy-terminal FYVE domain (a domain originally found
in Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1 proteins; Pfam accession
PF01363), whereas other examples contain two ankyrin
repeats followed by a linker region, two tandem BTB
domains, and a 300 residue carboxy-terminal helical region.
The three BTB-ankyrin proteins from S. pombe (Btb1p,
Btb2p, Btb3p) are components of a SCF-like ubiquitin ligase
complex and interact with Pcu3p, a Cul3 homolog [17]. Both
BTB domains of Btb3p are necessary for this interaction. The
BTB sequences from these proteins are only distantly related
to other BTB domains, and we thus cannot reliably predict the
nature of their interaction surfaces.

Mutations have been identified in lung cancer patients that do
not disrupt the RhoBTB2-Cul3 interaction [13], and these
map to regions outside of the predicted Cul3-interacting
region (see below). We predict, however, that the Y284D cancer mutation is found in the dimerization interface of the first
BTB domain and prevents the proper folding of the domain.
This would be analogous to mutants in the dimer interface of
PLZF that abrogate function by affecting the folding of the
domain [6]. The PLZF and BCL6 BTB domains are obligate
dimers, and cannot fold as stable monomers (unpublished
observation and [43]).

The BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) proteins
Sequence analysis on proteins with the BTB-BACK architecture but no kelch repeats revealed the presence of a conserved
carboxy-terminal region of approximately 170 residues. This
region in the BTBD1 and BTBD2 proteins has sequence similarity with human protein associated with myc (PAM; NCBI
accession number AAC39928), Drosophila highwire
(AAF76150) and C. elegans regulator of presynaptic morphology (RPM-1; NP_505267.1) and has been called the
'PHR-like' region (Pfam accession PF08005). It has been
shown to interact with topoisomerase 1 [109].
Searches with various PHR domain sequences against the
Pfam, Prodom and SMART databases identified only automatically generated alignments, and BLAST searches against
the PDB did not reveal any significant hits. The domain does
not contain extended regions of disorder, and secondary
structure predictions suggest that the PHR domain is an all-β
fold. Despite the lack of a strongly repeating sequence motif,
the PHR may represent a novel type of β-propeller structure,
by analogy with the BBK proteins. Using HMM searches, we

BTB proteins with no other identified domain
A significant number of BTB proteins do not contain other
identified sequence motifs (Figure 5). Excluding the Skp1 and
ElonginC proteins, 52% of the C. elegans BTB proteins, but
only 17% of the human proteins, belong to this family. There
may be additional domains in some of these proteins that
have yet to be identified.

BTB domains in cullin complexes
Several members of the BTB families described here have
been found to interact with Cul3-based SCF-like complexes
including BTB-ZF [14], BBK [12,14,112], MATH-BTB [14-16],
RhoBTB [13], BTB-ankyrin [17], BTB-only [14,17] and T1-Kv
[16] proteins. The roles of Skp1 and ElonginC as integral components of SCF and VCB complexes, respectively, have long
been established [86,113]. In SCF complexes, F-box proteins
such as Cdc4 form precise complexes with Skp1 helices α7 and
α8 via their F-box, thus positioning their ligand-binding carboxy-terminal WD40 β-propeller domain such that bound
substrate is ubiquinated by the E3 ligase [25,26].
Nine of the 49 human BBK proteins have been identified as
components of Cul3-based SCF-like complexes [12,14] and, in
several cases, the BTB domain is necessary and sufficient for
interaction with Cul3. We propose that the BBK proteins are
structurally analogous to the two-chain Skp1/Fbox or ElonginC/SOCS box complexes [79]. In these cases, the central

BACK domain would serve to position the carboxy-terminal
β-propeller kelch repeats for substrate recognition [114]. We
expect a similar situation in the BBP proteins, where the PHR
domain would act at the substrate recognition module.

Interestingly, some T1-Kv proteins interact with Cul3 [16],
and an equivalent analysis allows the placement of the T1
tetramer into a model of the SCF-like complex (data not
shown), although the tetramerization interface is not fully
separate from the putative Cul3 interface (Figure 2). Minor
structural adjustments that are not evident from the homology modeling may be required in these cases.

HMMs were matured by iteratively building the results from
multiple rounds of sequence search, alignment and training.

VAST [118] structure superposition searches. Structural
superpositions and sequence alignments were generated with
CE, SwissPDBViewer [119] and by manual inspection and
adjustments. RMSD values were calculated using SwissPDBViewer, and molecular representations were generated with
Pymol [120].

refereed research

To aid in understanding the role of the BTB domain in the
SCF-like complex, we generated a structural model of a BBK
protein dimerized via its BTB domain in a complex with Cul3,
Rbx1, E2 and ubiquitin (Figure 7). Three different structures
of Skp1 complexes are known [24-26], including a Cul1-Skp1
complex [24]. We generated a homology model of human
Cul3 based on the structure of Cul1, and placed the PLZF BTB
dimer by superposing one chain of the dimer with Skp1.
Residues in Skp1 that interact with Cul1 are found at positions
that do not involve the dimer interface residues in PLZF (Figures 2 and 4). The BTB domain from the BTB-ZF, BBK and
MATH-BTB and BTB-bZip families are closely related (Figure
6) and contain mostly the long form of the domain, as discussed above. We predict these to form obligate dimers, similar to those observed in PLZF and BCL6 [5,22,55]. Proteins
from each of these families have been shown to interact with
Cul3; therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that these BTB
domains drive the dimerization of Cul3 complexes. Indeed,
dimerization of adaptor proteins is known to occur [115]. The
resulting model is similar to the model presented for the ubiquitin-E2-SCF(Cdc4) [26] and E2-SCFβ-TrcP1 complexes [25],
except that two ligand-binding kelch/WD40 domains and
two E2-ubiquitins localize to the same face of the dimeric
complex. In each BBK protein, the BACK domain is between
the amino-terminal BTB domain and the carboxy-terminal
ligand binding domain, and is likely to be important for positioning the substrate in the complex. A more precise model
for a dimeric Cul3-based E3 ligase complex will require the
structure of the BACK domain.

This study illustrates the diversity in the abundance, distribution, protein architecture and sequence characteristics of BTB
proteins in 17 eukaryotic genomes. We surveyed public
databases and fully sequenced genomes and identified several
lineage-specific expansions. The BTB domain is found in a
wide variety of proteins, but it most often occurs as a single
copy at or near the protein amino terminus. Residues exposed
at the surface of the BTB fold are highly variable across
sequence families, reflecting the large number of self-association and protein-protein interaction states seen in solved
BTB structures. Most BTB-ZF, BBK and MATH-BTB proteins
contain a long form of the domain that has an additional conserved amino-terminal region, and these are predicted to
form stable dimers. In at least some of the BTB transcription
factors, BTB dimers are required for interaction with corepressor peptides, and possibly for higher order self-association. Based on structural superpositions, we show that the
Cul3 interaction surface on many BTB proteins does not overlap with the dimerization interface and, therefore, these BTB
proteins may drive the dimerization of Cul3-based E3 ligase
complexes.

Conclusion

reports

Some BTB-ZF proteins, including PLZF, have also been
shown to bind to Cul3, presumably in a BTB-dependent mode
[14]. The role of these proteins in Cul3-based SCF-like complexes pose a puzzle, as we do not expect that downstream ZF
domains maintain a fixed orientation relative to the BTB
domain due to the structurally disordered central region.
Further work will be required to understand the structure and
function of BTB-ZF proteins in SCF-like complexes.

Stogios et al. R82.13

reviews

BTB domains of 5 of the 46 MATH-BTB proteins from C. elegans have been shown to interact with Cul3. As in the BBK
proteins, the MATH-BTB proteins are conserved over much
of their entire length, and are likely to be internally rigid. In
this scenario, the substrate-recognizing MATH domain is
found amino-terminal to the BTB domain, but since the
amino and carboxyl termini are very close to each other in the
long form BTB domain dimer [5,22], the MATH domain in
these proteins may occupy a similar spatial position relative
to the BTB dimer as the BACK-kelch region of BBK proteins.

A model of the ubiquitin-E2-Cul3-Rbx1-BBK complex was
generated following the approach used in making the ubiquitin-E2-SCF(Cdc4) model [26]. The BBK model was made
from a composite of the Skp1 and F-box proteins from the
Skp1/Cdc4 [26] and Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-Skp2 complexes [24], in
which one chain of the PLZF BTB dimer [22] was substituted
for Skp1, and the BACK domain was assumed to adopt the
same structure as Skp1 helices α6 and α7 and the F-box and
helical linker regions. The Keap1 kelch domain [114] was used
to replace the β-propellers of the Cdc4 WD40 domain. Cul1
was replaced by a homology model of Cul3 that was generated
using the 3D-PSSM server [129]. The E2 enzyme Ubch7 was
positioned using a superposition of the RING domains from
Rbx1 and c-Cbl from the c-Cbl-Ubch7 complex [130], and the
placement of ubiquitin was achieved by superposition of the
