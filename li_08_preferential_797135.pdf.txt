Abstract
Background: Although recent advances have been made in identifying and analyzing instances of
microRNA-mediated gene regulation, it remains unclear by what mechanisms attenuation of
transcript expression through microRNAs becomes an integral part of post-transcriptional
modification, and it is even less clear to what extent this process occurs for mammalian gene
duplicates (paralogs). Specifically, while mammalian paralogs are known to overcome their initial
complete functional redundancy through variation in regulation and expression, the potential
involvement of microRNAs in this process has not been investigated.
Results: We comprehensively investigated the impact of microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional
regulation on duplicated genes in human and mouse. Using predicted targets derived from several
analysis methods, we report the following observations: microRNA targets are significantly
enriched for duplicate genes, implying their roles in the differential regulation of paralogs; on
average, duplicate microRNA target genes have longer 3' untranslated regions than singleton
targets, and are regulated by more microRNA species, suggesting a more sophisticated mode of
regulation; ancient duplicates were more likely to be regulated by microRNAs and, on average,
have greater expression divergence than recent duplicates; and ancient duplicate genes share fewer
ancestral microRNA regulators, and recent duplicate genes share more common regulating
microRNAs.
Conclusion: Collectively, these results demonstrate that microRNAs comprise an important
element in evolving the regulatory patterns of mammalian paralogs. We further present an
evolutionary model in which microRNAs not only adjust imbalanced dosage effects created by gene
duplication, but also help maintain long-term buffering of the phenotypic consequences of gene
deletion or ablation.

Background

Gene duplication plays an indispensable role in the establishment of genetic novelty, providing not only new genes, and

thus the potential for alternative gene functionality, but also
facilitating genomic robustness by affording buffering of the
consequences of gene deletion [1-3]. While it has been

proposed that paralogs often share functions so as to achieve
buffering against mutations or deletions [1,2], total redundancy among duplicates is both genetically unfavorable and
potentially disruptive to biochemical pathways due to dosage
sensitivity [4-6]; thus, a clear understanding of the patterns
of divergence between duplicates is crucial in elucidating the
mechanisms by which new functions arise.
Previous examinations of gene duplications have assayed
their diverging function through comparisons of co-conservation of coding regions [7,8], shared transcriptional regulation
[9,10], or similarity in protein-protein [11,12] or genetic [13]
interaction partners. One consequent finding is that while
paralogs may retain similar functionality, gene expression
rapidly diverges immediately after duplication events
[10,14,15], suggesting that alterations in gene expression precede potential changes in function. This noted expression
divergence currently can not be explained through analysis of
transcriptional regulatory motifs [9,10], suggesting that differential regulation at the post-transcriptional level - for
example, regulation mediated by microRNAs - could contribute to expression and ultimately functional divergence
between gene duplicates. Also, while still speculative, one
potential selective benefit of maintaining divergence in
expression between functionally overlapping gene duplicates
is the possibility for so-called 'expression-reprogramming', or
compensation by one paralog upon either deletion or mutation of its sister gene, or in response to specific environmental
cues [16]. The mechanism of reported instances of such
reprogramming remains unclear, and the potential involvement of post-transcriptional regulation of expression through
microRNAs is largely unexplored.
MicroRNAs represent a class of small (typically 22 nucleotides in length) non-coding RNAs that can block translation
of their target genes through mRNA degradation or translational repression [17,18]. MicroRNA-mediated regulation at
the post-transcriptional level is pervasive in animals, as at
least one-third of human genes are estimated to be microRNA
targets [19,20]. In animals, microRNA target sites, many of
which are highly conserved [21], are generally located in the
3' untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA. Despite
their obvious importance, little is known about the acquisition of microRNA-mediated regulation.
Considering the pervasive nature of microRNA regulation in
mammalian cells, it is intriguing to inquire how the function
and evolution of duplicate genes have been modulated by
microRNAs. Until recently this area had largely remained
unexplored except in the case of plants [22], which have a different microRNA-mediated regulatory system and also are
generally more tolerant to polyploidy than animals. Here we
describe investigation of the impact of microRNA-mediated
regulation on the gene duplication and subsequent functional
dispersal of genes in human and mouse. We found that
microRNAs are ultimately actively involved in this process, as

evidenced by the following: human microRNA targets are significantly enriched for duplicate genes; paralog pairs targeted
by microRNAs generally have higher sequence and expression divergence; and duplicated microRNA targets are subjected to a more sophisticated mode of regulation.
Furthermore, comparisons of duplicate genes of varying ages
suggest that ancient duplicates share few ancestral microRNA
regulators. Taken together, our results suggest that microRNA-mediated regulation plays an important role in the regulatory circuits involving duplicate genes, including adjusting
imbalanced dosage effects of gene duplicates, and possibly
creating a mechanism for genetic buffering.

Results
Mammalian microRNA targets are significantly
enriched for duplicated genes
In order to determine whether duplicate genes were more
likely than singleton genes to be regulated by microRNAs, we
first analyzed the genetic composition of known microRNA
targets. Specifically, we retrieved all human paralogous gene
pairs from Ensembl via BioMart [23], retaining a list of
12,605 genes, each of which has at least one paralog, and 9,
884 singletons genes with no discernable duplicate copy (see
Materials and methods). Predicted human microRNA target
genes were obtained from the miRGen website [24,25], which
contains benchmarked microRNA targets derived from leading prediction programs such as TargetScanS [20] and PicTar[19]. These prediction programs predict microRNA
targets based on sequence complementarity, sequence context information, evolutionary conservation, and binding
energy (see Materials and methods), and are regarded by previous surveys of microRNA targets as having high confidence
[26-29]. However, to further increase the stringency of identified microRNA targets, all analyses presented below have
been confirmed using both target sets independently, and
only those sites detected jointly by both TargetScanS and PicTar. Additionally, to remove any potential bias caused by the
reliance of TargetScanS and PicTar on evolutionary conservation (four-way or five-way conservation used across human,
mouse, rat, dog or chicken), we included a third set of predicted human microRNA targets derived from PITA [30],
which instead considers only sequence complementarity and
site accessibility (see Materials and methods). The PITA prediction program also has the advantage of detecting lineagespecific microRNA targets.
Using each of these stringent datasets, we observed that
microRNA targets were significantly enriched for duplicated
genes. As shown in Figure 1, duplicate genes are roughly twice
as likely to be microRNA targets as comparable singletons
(Hyper-geometric test, p-values < 5 × 10-89 for the four datasets). As shown in Figure 1a, duplicate genes comprise 56% of
all the genes in the genome (12,605 out of 22,489), but make
up 66% of the microRNA targets as predicted by PicTar (similar results were found using other target detection methods).

Figure 1
MicroRNA targets are enriched for duplicate genes
MicroRNA targets are enriched for duplicate genes. This figure shows the number of singleton and duplicate genes among the microRNA targets predicted
(a) by PicTar, (b) by TargetScanS, (c) by both programs (intersections), and (d) by PITA.

Enrichment of duplicate genes is not a by-product of
longer 3'UTRs, preferential sequence conservation, or
gene family expansion
We next sought to determine whether the observed enrichment of duplicated genes for microRNA regulation was in fact
an intrinsic property of paralogs, or rather if it was a by-product of another ancillary feature of the analyzed gene set. Specifically, we identified and controlled for three potential
sources of biases. First, duplicated genes tended to have
longer 3'UTRs than singleton genes (median 878 nucleotides
for duplicate genes, versus 850 for singletons, p = 4.79 × 10-4,
two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), implying that our observation could have been affected by the greater random chance
of duplicates to be detected as microRNA targets. To test this
we sampled 5,068 duplicate genes whose 3'UTR length falls
into the 0.25 to 0.75 quintiles of the 3'UTR lengths among the
7,595 singleton genes that have available 3'UTR annotation in
Ensembl (see Materials and methods), eliminating any biases

in the 3'UTR lengths, and repeated our analysis. Again, duplicates were significantly enriched as microRNA targets (p <
5.04 × 10-21, Hyper-geometric test), eliminating 3'UTR length
as a potential source of bias.
The next identified difference between duplicates and singletons stems from the previously reported observation that the
sequences of duplicated genes are under more stringent
selective constraints [31]. Since many microRNA target sites
are known to be evolutionarily conserved [21], it is possible
that such an elevated level of overall sequence conservation
would have led to an over-representation of duplicate genes
among microRNA targets. As microRNA binding sites are
predominantly located in 3'UTRs of target genes, we tested
the level of sequence conservation downstream of the stop
codon in duplicate and singleton genes to determine whether
such a bias indeed existed. We compiled 6,937 human duplicate and 4,690 singleton genes, which have available 3'UTR

annotations, as well as their mouse orthologs. To determine
the divergence between 3'UTR sequences, we adopted the
method described in [32,33], whereby we aligned humanmouse orthologous 3'UTR sequences and calculated substitution rates per site (termed as K3u) based on the Kimura's twoparameter model. We did not find significant difference in
K3u between duplicate genes and singleton genes (median for
duplicate genes is 0.191, and median for singleton genes is
0.189; p = 0.82, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), indicating that there is no preferential conservation of downstream
regions for duplicated genes that could inherently bias our
results.
To further confirm that the 3'UTRs of the duplicated and singleton genes are under the same level of selective pressure, we
normalized rates of substitution for the 3'UTR of each gene by
the corresponding rate of substitution of the coding region in
the same gene. Since the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) in coding sequences is presumably neutral [34], the ratio of K3u/Ks can be used to
estimate the functional constraints on the 3'UTRs relative to
the coding region for individual genes [33]. Upon comparing
the K3u/Ks ratios between duplicate and singleton genes, we
did not observe any statistically significant differences
(median of the ratio is 0.311 for duplicate genes and 0.307 for
singleton genes; p = 0.94, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test),
suggesting that our observations are not likely influenced by
preferential sequence conservation of duplicated genes in
3'UTRs. We also tested our observation on predicted microRNA targets derived from PITA [30], which does not assume
evolutionary conservation for the targets. The same enrichment was also observed in this predicted gene set.
Finally, we tested whether the observed enrichment of gene
duplicates was evenly distributed among all surveyed paralogs, or rather whether it was influenced by the dominance of
a small number of gene families. We clustered the duplicated
genes into 3,433 disjoint gene families using single-linkage
clustering, then randomly selected one representative gene
from each family and compared this set of 3,433 genes with
the 9,884 singleton human genes in our dataset. Using each
dataset of human microRNA targets, we observed the same
enrichment of microRNA targets for duplicate genes (Hypergeometric test, p < 3 × 10-62). Collectively, these results demonstrate the robustness of the finding that microRNAs preferentially regulate duplicate genes in human. Similar tests
revealed identical findings in mouse, but not Caenorhabditis
elegans (Additional data file 1), suggesting that it may be a
property specific to mammals.

Duplicated genes exhibit more sophisticated
regulatory patterns
Having demonstrated that duplicated genes are more likely to
be regulated by microRNAs, we next asked whether any differences existed in the magnitude of microRNA regulation
between duplicated and singleton genes. Below we present

our analysis based on microRNA targets derived from PicTar;
however, all conclusions also hold true for targets derived
from TargetScanS, from the intersection between PicTar and
TargetScanS, and from PITA. Indeed, we observed that duplicated genes, on average, were regulated by more distinct
microRNA species than singletons, as duplicated genes had a
median of six distinct microRNA species, while singleton
genes had four (p < 5 × 10-14, two sided Wilcoxon rank sum
test). Again, such a disparity could potentially be attributed to
differences in the length of 3'UTR between duplicate and singleton genes (Figure 2), as among microRNA target genes
predicted by PicTar, TargetScanS or PITA, duplicate genes
generally have longer 3'UTRs than singleton genes (p < 1 × 105 for PicTar targets). However, upon examining the density of
target sites in the 3'UTR, defined as the number of distinct
microRNA target binding sites types per kilobase, we again
observed that duplicated genes had a higher density of microRNA binding sites than comparable singletons (p = 6.30 × 105, two sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), suggesting that paralogs are more actively regulated by microRNAs than
singletons.

Divergence in miRNA regulation between paralogs
We next divided the paralogs into two groups: those pairs
without microRNA regulation (that is, neither of the two
genes is a microRNA target; 1,561 pairs); and pairs with at
least one copy regulated by microRNAs (771 pairs). Ks values
were then tallied between paralogs as a proxy for age since
duplication (values used were between 0.05 and 2 as Ks
beyond this range implies either too little or saturated
sequence divergence, making the resulting inferences

unreliable). To investigate any correlations between age of
the duplicates and microRNA mediated regulation, both
microRNA-regulated and non-regulated paralog pairs were
sub-divided into four categories based on their pairwise Ks
values (Figure 3). We found that pairs with greater Ks, and
thus those with greater time since duplication, were more
likely to be regulated by microRNAs (mean Ks = 0.78 for the
pairs without miRNA regulation, compared with mean Ks =
1.38 for pairs with miRNA regulation; p = 4.8 × 10-84, twosided Wilcoxon rank sum test), suggesting that duplicated
genes can acquire microRNA regulation over time.
Next we investigated the extent to which the paralog pairs
share common microRNA regulators, presumably those
inherited from their ancestral parental genes. For duplicate
gene pairs in which both paralogs were regulated by at least
one microRNA (224 in total) we defined the overlap score of
shared microRNA regulators as the ratio between the number
of common microRNA regulators (intersection) and all the
total regulators for the pair (union). We observed a significant
negative correlation between this overlap score and the Ks
values for paralog pairs (r = -0.56, p = 3.4054 × 10-20, Pearson
correlation), intuitively implying that more recent paralogs
share proportionally more common microRNA binding sites
(Figure 4), and consequently that ancestral microRNA regulation patterns are lost by ancient duplicates.

Finally, to determine if differences in microRNA regulation in
fact correlated with varied expression, we obtained human
gene expression data across 79 tissues [35], and compared
these versus annotated target data. After mapping probe set
names to Ensembl gene IDs (1,388 pairs had expression data
mapped to Ensembl IDs, 575 of which where at least one paralog was a microRNA target; see Materials and methods),
expression divergence was calculated for each pair as 1 minus
the Pearson correlation of expression across all tissue types.
Consistent with what was observed regarding sequence diver-

gence, duplicate gene pairs regulated by microRNAs had
more divergent expression profiles (mean expression divergence is 0.82, compared with 0.57, p = 5.62 × 10-20 for duplicate pairs without microRNA regulation, two-sided Wilcoxon
rank sum test), suggesting that differences in microRNAmediated regulation are likely ultimately manifested as
altered gene expression between paralogs.

Discussion

In ancient duplicate gene pairs regulated by microRNAs, sister paralogs seemingly have largely evolved varying sets of
microRNA regulators, either through acquisition of novel
binding sites or through the loss of ancestral ones. As we
observed that microRNA targets with duplicate copies were
generally under more sophisticated regulation mediated by
microRNAs, we postulate that microRNA regulation is selectively advantageous among higher organisms, and might
provide the groundwork for additional regulatory and buffering mechanisms. This can be potentially explained when considering the selective pressures incident on duplicated genes
following duplication.

pairs were grouped according to their pair-wise Ks divergence from the
smallest to the greatest. It is clear that ancient duplicates with higher Ks
values have a higher chance to be regulated by microRNAs.

Relaxed selective pressure acting on duplicates, especially on
the 3'UTRs, and the subsequent accelerated evolution may
have ultimately led to the emergence of additional microRNA
binding sites. As noted previously [7,36], immediately following a duplication event paralogs experience accelerated evolution in sequence, function and regulation due to relaxed
selective constraints. It is conceivable that the 3'UTR region
of the duplicate genes could have evolved at a faster rate than

comparable singleton genes, allowing expedition of microRNA target site gain [26]. Additionally, such enrichment
could be potentially beneficial to the organism since it offers
an additional mechanism to regulate protein production from
duplicate genes, thus avoiding complications of dosage
imbalance, which may potentially be detrimental to the
organism [4-6], adding additional pressure for 3'UTR
modification.
Another selective advantage of adapting microRNA-mediated
regulation is the potential involvement in compensatory buffering mechanisms among duplicates [1-3]. Kafri and colleagues previously used the mouse paralogs Myod1(alias:
MyoD) and Myf5 (alias: Myf-5) as an example to illustrate
genetic buffering (see the supplemental materials in [16]),
both of which are regulated by a number of microRNAs.
These genes are transcription factors that show divergent
expression patterns [16,37,38], yet deletion of Myod1 leads to
the up-regulation of its sister paralog Myf5. Below we present
a model whereby similar paralogs may have adapted compensatory buffering mechanisms through mediating microRNA
regulation.

A model for microRNA mediated genetic buffering

According to the simulated dynamics, initially, due to the
effect of M, the protein level of T1 (blue line) is repressed and
the highly expressed T2 promotes the protein level of P. Upon
the null mutation of T2, the protein concentration of T1 is upregulated until reaching a steady state. Meanwhile, with upregulation of T1, after a transient down-regulation of P caused
by the mutation of T2, the level of M is promptly restored to
its original level.

In the following we extend the reprogramming hypothesis
originally derived from yeast to mammals by proposing a
kinetic model in which the microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation can facilitate the genetic buffering
between gene duplicates. As shown in Figure 5a, under the
reprogramming hypothesis, paralog genes T1 and T2 are regulated by a common set of transcription factor(s), denoted as
U. Protein products of both T1 and T2 regulate the target protein P. However, the effect of T1 regulation on P is attenuated
by a microRNA (M), which is either hosted or activated by T2.
If T2 is down-regulated due to mutations or deletions, the
expression of microRNA M will be repressed, which elevates
the expression of T1 so as to maintain a similar expression
level of P. Mathematically, the topology of our proposed
kinetic model is intrinsically stable with only one steady state
that corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium in protein concentration (Figure 5b).

scription of the microRNA mir-301 [39], which in turn targets
the Oct4 paralogs Pou4f1, Pou3f2 and Pou4f2. Despite the
crucial role of Oct4 in human embryonic stem cells [40],
recent research has shown that no phenotypic changes could
be observed upon the mutation of Oct4 as "Oct4 is dispensable for both self-renewal and maintenance of somatic stem
cells in the adult mammal" [40]. It is possible, however, that
living cells have evolved a buffering mechanism whereby the
loss of Oct4 down-regulates mir-301, which in turn up-regulates its paralogs Pou4f1, Pou3f2 or Pou4f2, which compensate for the function of Oct4.

MicroRNAs, genome duplications, and morphological
complexity
There is an increasing amount of evidence that whole genome
duplication events actually occurred twice during the emergence of vertebrates [41-43], being a major source of morphological complexity among vertebrates. However, a recent
survey of the distribution of microRNA families among a wide
range of chordate species by Heimberg and colleagues [44]
cast doubt on the presumed importance of such duplication

Genome Biology 2008,

events. In this study, a dramatic expansion of microRNA families was observed at the base of the vertebrates (prior to the
divergence between lamprey and jawed fishes but after the
divergence between vertebrates and other chordates, and
thus prior to when the ancient whole genome duplication
events are thought to have occurred), which purportedly had
a greater role than genome duplication in creating the extensive morphology complexity among extant vertebrates.
Regardless of what triggered the expansion of microRNA
families, we argue that both the microRNA expansion and the
genome duplication events, and perhaps most likely the synergistic combination of the two, were responsible for
generating the enrichment of duplicate genes among microRNA targets observed here.
While a microRNA expansion event created an abundance of
regulators to evolve into an elaborate regulatory network,
subsequent genome duplication(s) may also have provided
additional genes as effectors for the newly generated microRNAs to operate on. Furthermore, the potential relaxed selective pressure following genome duplication events would
have further facilitated genes gaining microRNA binding
sites. This reasoning is supported by our observation that
microRNA targeting bias towards duplicate genes might be
unique in high order organisms (human and mouse) but not
in lower organisms such as C. elegans.
Takuno and Inna [22] recently surveyed the affect of microRNAs on the expansion and evolution of gene families of Arabidopsis thaliana, which has undergone multiple whole
genome duplication events. These authors reported that gene
families consisting of multiple paralogous genes tended to be
regulated by fewer microRNAs in Arabidopsis, which is
seemingly different from what we observed in human as our
results suggest paralogous genes are under more sophisticated microRNA regulation. However, we believe such inconsistency can be explained by the fundamental differences in
microRNA-mediated regulation between plants and mammals. Animal microRNAs can only bind to target sites that are
located in the 3'UTR of genes, whereas plant microRNAs can
bind 5'UTR and coding regions as well [17]. In addition, in
plants, microRNAs and their target sites usually require perfect base-pairing, whereas one or two mismatches are generally tolerated in animals, resulting in far more prevalent
microRNA regulation in animals (human microRNAs are predicted to regulate hundreds of genes while microRNAs in
plants generally regulate much fewer target genes). In addition, plants presumably are more tolerant of gene duplications as plants frequently undergo whole-genome duplication
and polyploidization events [45]. Together, these differences
suggest different mechanisms for both microRNA family
expansion and adaptation of gene regulatory mechanisms in
plants.

Conclusion

It is widely acknowledged that expression divergence
increases proportionally with the increase of divergence time
between sister paralogs [15,46]. However, studies of the
mechanism of divergence have focused mainly on transcription factor mediated regulation [8,9,11]. Here, we demonstrate that human microRNA target genes are significantly
enriched for duplicate genes, and also that duplicate pairs
with greater divergence, while having a higher chance to be
regulated by microRNAs, share very few common microRNA
regulators. This difference in microRNA regulation likely
plays a role in the observed expression difference between
these same duplicates. By eliminating potential confounding
factors, our observations strongly suggest that the microRNA
could potentially affect functional divergence between paralog pairs, and high-order organisms have adopted microRNA
as an efficient and sophisticated mechanism to control and
modulate protein production from duplicate genes.
MicroRNA regulation is not considered to be a simplistic
process, and likely requires more detailed evolutionary and
functional models before a full understanding can be
gleamed. For example, additional factors, such as mRNA
splicing, polyadenylation, and chromatin modifications, offer
new paths to further investigate the impact of combinatorial
regulation at multiple levels. Regulation by microRNA can
also be adapted in response to common cellular processes, as
recently evidenced in cell-cycle arrest [47], indicating possible responses to dynamic influences. Currently, while highquality fully assembled genome sequences are available for a
number of vertebrates, comprehensive and accurate annotation of protein-coding genes and microRNAs has been done
only for human and mouse. Once the quality and quantity of
genome sequences and annotations are improved, it will be
possible to test whether the same enrichment and other
patterns can also be observed in other vertebrates. Yet, the
simple model provided here provides sufficient groundwork
to begin testing, and ultimately understanding, the evident
impact that microRNAs play in gene duplication and subsequent functional differentiation.

Materials and methods
Compilation of human genes
The complete set of human duplicate genes was compiled
from Ensembl database (version 46) through seven steps,
including best reciprocal Blast search, sequence clustering,
multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis. A description
of the procedures can be found at the Ensembl database web
site. We also downloaded all human genes from Ensembl via
the BioMart utility. After removing redundant paralog pairs
(that is, in the case of A-B and B-A, we retained only A-B) and
selecting only those pairs for which both genes are annotated
as 'known genes', we retained a final total of 39,177 paralog
pairs. This corresponds to a total of 12,605 unique genes that
have at least one duplicate copy in the human genome (note

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R132

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/8/R132

Genome Biology 2008,

that one gene can have multiple paralogs. In addition, we also
retained a total of 9, 884 known singleton genes that have no
duplicate copy.

The compilation of microRNA target genes
We retrieved the genome-wide computationally predicted
human microRNA targets at the miRGen website [24,25],
which pre-compiled and benchmarked the up-to-date target
predictions from leading algorithms, including TargetScanS
and PicTar, which we used in this study. The accuracy of these
prediction sets had been previously benchmarked by gene
expression profiling with high confidence [48], and have been
used in a number of recent publications [26-29]. The input
human genes used in these prediction programs are largely
consistent with the most current Ensembl annotations, as
only less than 30 genes did not have concurrent IDs in
Ensembl version 46. After removing those defunct Ensembl
IDs, the total number of predicted targets was 6,777 for PicTar, 6,332 for TargetScanS, and 4,989 for their intersection.
In addition to using PicTar and TargetScanS, we also confirmed our conclusion presented here based on a set of newly
released microRNA targets derived from PITA [30]. We
downloaded human microRNA targets from the PITA Targets
Catalog (no flank) from the Weizman Institute website [49],
mapped the gene symbols to Ensembl IDs and retained a final
list of 15, 083 genes annotated as microRNA targets in PITA.
Note that unlike predictions from PicTar and TargetScanS,
PITA made predictions based on sequence features and site
accessibility instead of using cross-species conservation;
thus, many non-conserved microRNA targets are included in
the list, so many more genes are annotated as microRNA targets, especially as targets for primate-specific microRNAs. All
the miRNA targets used in this study are listed in Additional
data file 2.

Sequence conservation in 3'UTRs
A list of human-mouse one-to-one orthologs were downloaded from Ensembl version 46, which included 8,581
human genes with at least one duplicate copy and 5,777 singleton genes having no duplicate copy. We also downloaded
3'UTR sequences and coding sequences of all the known
genes for human and mouse in Ensembl version 46. For genes
that are annotated as having multiple 3'UTR sequences, we
retained the longest one. Thus, our final list included 6,937
duplicate genes and 4, 690 singleton genes with available
3'UTR sequences for them and their mouse orthologs. To
determine sequence conservation in 3'UTRs, we adopted
methods described in [32,33]. Briefly, we first aligned
human-mouse orthologous 3'UTR sequences and then calculated the substitution rates per site (K3u) based on the Kimura
two-parameter model [50]. Similarly, we also aligned humanmouse orthologous coding sequences, and implemented
YN00 in the PAML package [51] to calculate the number of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks).

Extraction of independent duplicate pairs
For all the non-redundant 12,605 duplicate genes defined in
Ensembl (see above), we retrieved their coding sequences and
used ClustalW [52] to realign the 39,177 paralog pairs. With
the pair-wise alignment, we also implemented YN00 in
PAML [51] to calculate the rates of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site and sequence identity
of the aligned regions. Of the 39,177 gene pairs, we excluded
10 pairs that have a stop codon within the coding region. Similar to previously described procedures [36,53], we clustered
the 39,177 pairs into 3,433 gene families, and in each gene
family, we selected duplicate pairs from the lowest Ks to the
highest Ks values based on two criteria: once a pair is
selected, the genes of the pair cannot be selected again; and
the selected pairs should have a Ks between 0.05 and 2. Our
final list consisted of 2, 332 independent duplicate pairs satisfying these criteria (Additional data file 3).

Human gene expression data
We retrieved the Novartis human gene expression data across
79 tissue types from the web [54]; the data from
U133A+GNF1H (gcRMA) chips were used in this study. Using
the annotation file for the GNF1H chip and the name-mapping table for U133A chip from Ensembl version 46, we
mapped the probe names used in the microarray experiments
to Ensembl identifiers; the expression intensities of multiple
probes that correspond to one gene were averaged. When calculating expression correlation, the dataset was normalized
as Z-scores (median-centered with one standard deviation)
for each tissue (cell-type).

Dynamic simulation
We attempted to computationally simulate the genetic reprogramming model as defined in Figure 5a[16]: U denotes a
common regulator that activates the transcription of T1 and
T2; T1 and T2 encode proteins that in turn regulate protein P,
either transcriptionally or translationally. T2 is also assumed
to activate the expression of microRNA M, which in turn
down-regulates T1. We used the following two sets of equations to describe the dynamics of the regulatory circuits
before and after a null mutation on T2.

dT1
= k 1U − α T1 − k m MT1
dt
dT2
= k 2U − β T2
dt
dM
= −k m MT 1 + k t T2
dt
dP
= k p1T1 + k p2T2 − γ P
dt

dT1
= k 1U − α T1 − k m MT1
dt
dT2
= − β T2
dt
dM
= −k m MT 1 + kt T2
dt
dP
= k p1T1 + k p2T2 − γ P
dt

The two dynamic systems as we proposed here are intrinsically stable and each has a steady state. T1, T2, M and P are
concentrations as indicated in Figure 5a. Based on the
assumption of a quasi-steady state, the degradation rates
were set as α = β = γ = 1. The reaction rates were set as: k1 = k2

= 0.2, kt = 0.8, kp1 = 2.75 and km = kp2 = 2. We also set U = 12.5
and the concentration of other molecules are 0. The mutation
on T2 was set at the 20 time point, so the steady state of the
first dynamic system (before T2 mutation) is the initial condition for the second dynamic system (after T2 mutation).
