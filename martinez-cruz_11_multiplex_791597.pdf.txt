Abstract
Background: The analysis of human Y-chromosome variation in the context of population genetics and forensics
requires the genotyping of dozens to hundreds of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the present
study, we developed a 121-plex (121 SNPs in a single array) TaqMan array capable of distinguishing most
haplogroups and subhaplogroups on the Y-chromosome human phylogeny in Europe.
Results: We present data from 264 samples from several European areas and ethnic groups. The array developed
in this study shows >99% accuracy of assignation to the Y human phylogeny (with an average call rate of
genotypes >96%).
Conclusions: We have created and evaluated a robust and accurate Y-chromosome multiplex which minimises the
possible errors due to mixup when typing the same sample in several independent reactions.

Background
The development of high-throughput technologies to
genotype hundreds of thousands of markers has yielded
an increase in the understanding of the genetic diversity
of our species [1]. This genomic knowledge has been
applied to different fields, from biomedical and pharmaceutical research to population genetics and forensics
[2-5]. Most of the genotyping technologies have been
based on typing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that commonly have only two alleles (ancestral or
derived compared to nonhuman primates) and have
usually arisen once. These high-throughput SNP genotyping analyses provide much information about the variation of our genome, but still little information has been
derived from some specific genome regions of great
interest. SNPs are also used for human identification purposes and to reconstruct human demographic history,
although these fields require the typing of a few selected
SNPs for targeted research rather than the use of highthroughput genotyping methods (that is, allele-specific
probes or single base primer extensions).

The human Y chromosome has been extensively analysed in forensic and evolutionary studies because of its
unique properties. Despite being a complex chromosome
with highly repetitive sequences [6], its exclusively paternal
inheritance due to the lack of recombination over most of
the chromosome has allowed researchers to trace paternal
lineages and reconstruct the male demographic history of
populations [7]. The human Y chromosome contains hundreds of well-characterised SNPs (around 600) whose evolutionary relationships have been established in a robust
phylogeny [8]. The Y-chromosome phylogeny defines several main branches (haplogroups) named with alphabetical
(A to T) and numerical codes. Each branch is subdivided
into more minor braches (subhaplogroups) defined by
other SNPs in a hierarchical way [9]. The classification of
a male DNA sample within the Y-chromosome phylogeny
requires the successive typing of markers that define the
haplogroup and subhaplogroups to which the sample
belongs. This process is not only laborious but also timeconsuming. For this reason, several attempts to genotype
multiple Y-chromosome SNPs in a single reaction have
been reported, mainly using single-base extension methodologies [10-15] or oligonucleotide ligation assays [16].
Nonetheless, these multiplex approaches have not been
able to type successfully more than 35 Y-chromosome
SNPs in a single reaction.

It is preferable to genotype, in a reproducible manner,
around 100 SNPs at a time. We therefore aimed to design
a single multiplex reaction of this size using TaqMan
probes (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
TaqMan probes are robust and reproducible assays that
have been used extensively to type SNPs in single reactions, that is, one SNP per TaqMan reaction. Each assay
is based on TaqMan probes that are hydrolysis probes
that anneal within a specific DNA region amplified by
polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). The probes present a
fluorophore (usually VIC or 6-FAM, Applied Biosystems)
attached to the 5′-end and a quencher at the 3′-end that
prevents fluorescence of the fluorophore. As the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) extends
the primer, its exonuclease activity degrades the probe
that has annealed to the template and releases the fluorophore, relieving the quenching effect and allowing fluorescence of the fluorophore. In a TaqMan assay, two
probes labelled with different fluorophores are used, each
one complementary to one of the two alleles (ancestral
or derived) of a SNP. In this way, in a real-time PCR, the
alleles of one SNP of a DNA sample can be interrogated
using two TaqMan probes labelled with different fluorophores. In the present study, our goal was to perform
more than 100 TaqMan assays in a single array to define
detailed haplogroups and subhaplogroups of the human
Y chromosome in European populations.

Results
Of the 128 SNPs designed in the TaqMan OpenArray
plate (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), 121 were successfully
typed. The internal controls gave completely concordant
results, as M145 genotypes were always concordant with
M203, and the two different assays for the marker M9
gave identical results in all the individuals. In addition,
the genotypes obtained for the control samples (Coriell
samples; Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden,
NJ 08103 USA) were identical to those previously
obtained with the same TaqMan assays used one-by-one,
giving a concordance rate of 100% (Table 1). An example
of a successful assay for the M203 marker is shown in
Figure 1. Three clusters of samples are shown in the plot
from the Autocaller software (Applied Biosystems): those
with VIC fluorescence (representing the ancestral allele,
G, of the M203 marker); those with FAM fluorescence
(representing the derived allele, C); and the negative controls, nontemplate controls (NTCs) without VIC or FAM
fluorescence.
The number of successful genotypes for the remaining
121 SNPs in the pool (the call rate) was high (average
96.4%), with the lowest value being for L23 (84.8%)
(Table 1). The combination of 121 SNPs was able to distinguish a total of 118 different haplogroups and subhaplogroups (Additional file 1, Figure S1), 40 of which were

Page 2 of 7

present in the populations typed and 24 of which were
shared by two or more European samples (Figure 2).
Haplogroup composition varied greatly across the different populations sampled, as expected from the known
phylogeography of the samples used.
Of 282 individuals where genotyping was attempted,
three did not yield any amplified product for any assay.
This failure was due to technical manipulation problems
in the DNA loading phase, as the wells corresponding
to these three samples were empty in the array. Of the
remaining 279, 277 showed complete phylogenetic compatibility. If a sample showed the derived allele for a
SNP that led to a certain branch of the tree, it also presented the derived alleles for all the SNPs leading to
that branch and the ancestral alleles for the SNPs leading to other branches. For example, if a sample was
derived for M201 (allele T), it was also derived for M89
(allele T), M168 (allele T), M42 (allele T) and SRY10831.1
(allele G), but was ancestral for all the rest of the SNPs
in the array (see Table 1). Although some of the haplogroups (that is, haplogroups D and M) were not present in the populations sampled, all the samples typed
showed the ancestral allele for the SNPs defining these
branches. Two individuals showed phylogenetic incompatibilities; that is, we found derived alleles for SNPs
leading to different branches of the phylogeny in the
same individual. In both cases, this incongruence was
due to a single misassigned internal SNP (false-positive)
that was eliminated, and both individuals could be correctly assigned in the phylogeny. However, it should be
noted that if the misassignation occurs at the very end
of the branch where the sample is assigned in the phylogeny, it might be undetectable and would lead to the
wrong assignation at the subbranch level.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to create a SNP multiplex for the human Y chromosome in a single array
that could be used to define Y-chromosome haplogroups in European populations. Previously, genotyping of Y-chromosome SNPs has been performed in
single-plex reactions or using limited multiplexes
[10-16]. The multiplex SNP typing described in the present study greatly reduces the amount of time spent on
typing. Besides that, typing a large number of SNPs in a
single array avoids the possibility of errors by sample
mixup when typing the same sample in several independent reactions. The pass rate (>94% successfully genotyped SNPs) and the average call rate (>96% successful
genotypes) in our study are remarkable and confirm the
present multiplex SNP typing as a robust method. The
analysis of the human Y chromosome has some technical advantages compared to other genomic regions,
which could explain the high pass and call rates.

Figure 1 Autocaller plot showing the fluorescence of 22 samples (green and dark blue) and two nontemplate controls (light blue) in
the M203 assay. The TaqMan probe complementary to the ancestral allele (G) was labelled with the VIC fluorophore, whereas FAM was used
to label the derived allele (C). Three clusters are seen in the plot: the samples with the derived allele, thus belonging to the Y-chromosome
haplogroup branch DE, are shown in dark blue; the samples with the ancestral allele, thus belonging to any haplogroup except DE, are shown
in green; and the negative controls are shown in light blue.

Despite the complex and highly repetitive structure of
the human Y chromosome [6], only one allele for each
marker per individual is expected because of its uniparental inheritance and the choice of markers originating
from unique regions. All male samples are thus hemizygous (presenting only one of the two alleles), and no
heterozygous results are expected (or observed). This
simplifies the calling, since only two clusters of results
are expected (excluding the cluster of negative controls),
one for each allele. Other genomic regions might be
more difficult to genotype with the present technique,
since the call rate must distinguish homozygous from
heterozygous alleles.
The amount of DNA used in the present sample set as
recommended by the manufacturer is high (300 ng);
however, high pass rates and calling rates (similar to the
ones provided in the present sample set) have been

obtained with as little as 90 ng (thus a final amount of 45
ng used for genotyping), provided that the A260/A280
DNA absorbance ratio is approximately 1.8 (data not
shown), which stresses the relevance of the DNA purity
to perform the analyses. This DNA amount is within the
range described in previous works multiplexing the Y
chromosome, mitochondrial DNA and autosomal SNPs
[10,12,16], although it is higher than that in other studies
[11,13,14]. Nonetheless, this amount of DNA remains
lower than the amount needed for genome-wide DNA
chips (for example, 500 ng for the Genome-Wide Human
SNP Array 6.0; Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA 95051
USA; and 37.5 μg for the next-generation Omni microarrays derived from genome-wide association studies; Illumina, Inc. (San Diego, CA 92121-1975 USA), although
these cover a much larger number of markers. In addition, the amount of DNA used in this study should not

be a problem for population genetic studies, as the mean
amount of human DNA extracted from 1 mL of saliva
has been reported to be as much as 11.4 μg/mL [20] and
even larger amounts are extracted from blood. The present assay might not be useful for forensic studies with
very low amounts of DNA available (for example, extraction from a single hair or from degraded samples),
although it can certainly be useful for forensic cases without a limited quantity of DNA (for example, paternity
and family reunification analyses).
Although the present multiplex was designed to screen
populations of European origin, it might be used to detect
the presence of individuals of non-European ancestry in
European samples and as a first approach for other
admixed populations with subsequent typing for those
haplogroups not common in Europe, since some branches
of the Y-chromosome phylogeny are not defined in the

present assay (that is, branches A or B or subbranches
within C, D, K, M, N, O, P, Q or T). Nonetheless, the present results show that the TaqMan assay multiplex technology exhibits successful and robust results and that
other combination of SNPs could be designed to genotype
all branches of the Y-chromosome phylogeny or to focus
on specific regions of the phylogeny. The OpenArray technology has the potential to combine up to 256 TaqMan
assays in the same plate, which is enough to genotype the
main diagnostic SNPs of most branches and subbranches
of the human Y-chromosome phylogeny. In addition, the
present methodology is flexible enough to include those
markers on the Y chromosome that are required for a specific analysis which contrast with the rigidity of commercial high-throughput arrays that also include several
SNPs in the Y chromosome. Although several genomewide human SNP arrays have incorporated hundreds of

Martínez-Cruz et al. Investigative Genetics 2011, 2:13
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/2/1/13

Y-chromosome SNPs, just a few of the SNPs in our array
share commonality with some commercially available SNP
arrays (for instance, M216, M9 and P123 are included in
the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 manufactured
by Affymetrix, Inc.; and M145 and M173 are included in
the BeadArray Reader manufactured by Illumina, Inc.).
Thus, to our knowledge, this study is the first to describe
typing with flexibility to such a high accuracy the human
Y chromosome in a single array.

Conclusions
We have created and evaluated a robust and accurate Ychromosome array to genotype 121 SNPs at a time using
TaqMan probes that classifies individuals into the main
haplogroups and the main European subhaplogroups in
the human Y-chromosome phylogeny, substantially
decreasing time of laboratory work and minimising the
possible errors due to mixup when typing the same sample
in several independent reactions.
Methods
Samples

DNA samples were obtained from 22 healthy unrelated
males from each of the following 12 populations: Bulgarians, Bulgarian Roma, Spanish, Spanish Roma, Italians,
Germans, British, Faroe Islanders, Danish, Greeks, Hungarians and Ukrainians. DNA samples from another 18
individuals of diverse origins obtained from the Coriell
Institute for Medical Research (three from Taiwan, one
Mbuti Pygmy, seven Russians, two Basques, one Chinese,
two from the Middle East and two from Southeast Asia)
were used as internal controls of the accuracy of the multiplex, since their haplogroup affiliations had previously
been determined by two different laboratories using the
same SNPs in single reactions incorporated into the present multiplex assay. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants, and the project was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at the Institut Municipal
d’Assistència Sanitària (IMAS reference 2006/2600/I).
DNA extraction was carried out using a standard phenol/
chloroform method.

TaqMan probes and submitted to the TaqMan assay
design pipeline (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). See Additional file 2, Table S2, for a complete description of the
primers used. Two different control assays were
included in the multiplex. Two redundant assays (M145
and M203) for haplogroup DE, that is, SNPs that define
the same Y-chromosome branch, were included as an
internal phylogenetic control. In addition, two different
assays for the same SNP (M9) were designed as an additional internal control. An M9a assay was designed to
present the ancestral allele (C) in the probe with the
VIC dye and the derived allele (G) with the FAM dye.
The M9b assay was designed to present the ancestral
allele (C) in the probe with the FAM dye and the
derived allele (G) with the VIC dye.
SNP genotyping and haplogroup classification

In the present analysis, a multiplex of 128 TaqMan assays
was performed in a single array for each DNA sample.
Each TaqMan OpenArray plate was designed to contain
the 128 assays for a total of 24 samples (22 DNA samples
and 2 NTCs). Technical exigencies of the autoloader
machine require double the amount of DNA to be present
in the loading tips. A total of 300 ng of genomic DNA was
used, and a final amount of 150 ng was incorporated into
the array with the autoloader and genotyped according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. The multiplex TaqMan assay reactions were carried out in a dual 384-well
GeneAmp 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Inc.)
with the following PCR cycle: an initial step at 93°C for
10 minutes followed by 55 cycles of 45 seconds at 95°C, 13
seconds at 94°C and 2 minutes, 14 seconds at 53°C.
The fluorescence results were read using Autocaller
software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The genotypes were
compiled and used to assign each sample to its Y-chromosome haplogroup according to the Y-chromosome
phylogeny published by Karafet et al. [8] and the Internal Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) 2009 Y-DNA
SNP Index website (http://isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_YDNA_SNP_Index09.html).

Additional material
SNP selection

A total of 128 Y-chromosome SNPs defining the main
haplogroups and subhaplogroups were chosen, with special attention to SNPs defining haplogroups and subhaplogroups reported as variable in European samples
[17-19]. Data published by Karafet et al. [8] and four
SNPs (P311, P312, L21, and L23) published on the
Internal Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) 2009 YDNA SNP Index website (http://isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_YDNA_SNP_Index09.html) were used for SNP
selection. The flanking sequences for each of the SNPs
were then investigated for the design of the SNP

Karafet et al. [8] and on the Internal Society of Genetic Genealogy
(ISOGG) 2009 Y-DNA SNP Index website (http://isogg.org/tree/
ISOGG_YDNA_SNP_Index09.html). Recurrent mutations of three markers
(SRY10831, P37 and P41) are shown in different branches of the tree.
