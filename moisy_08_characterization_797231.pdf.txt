Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons make a significant contribution to the size, organization and genetic diversity of
their host genomes. To characterize retrotransposon families in the grapevine genome (the fourth crop plant
genome sequenced) we have combined two approaches: a PCR-based method for the isolation of RnaseH-LTR
sequences with a computer-based sequence similarity search in the whole-genome sequence of PN40024.
Results: Supported by a phylogenic analysis, ten novel Ty1/copia families were distinguished in this study. To
select a canonical reference element sequence from amongst the various insertions in the genome belonging to
each retroelement family, the following screening criteria were adopted to identify the element sequence with:
(1) perfect 5 bp-duplication of target sites, (2) the highest level of identity between 5' and 3'-LTR within a single
insertion sequence, and (3) longest, un-interrupted coding capacity within the gag-pol ORF. One to eight copies
encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol polyprotein were found for three families, indicating that these
families could be still autonomous and active. For the others, no autonomous copies were identified. However,
a subset of copies within the presumably non-autonomous families had perfect identity between their 5' and 3'
LTRs, indicating a recent insertion event. A phylogenic study based on the sequence alignment of the region
located between reverse transcriptase domains I and VII distinguished these 10 families from other plant
retrotransposons. Including the previously characterized Ty1/copia-like grapevine retrotransposons Tvv1 and Vine
1 and the Ty3/gypsy-like Gret1 in this assessment, a total of 1709 copies were identified for the 13 retrotransposon
families, representing 1.24% of the sequenced genome. The copy number per family ranged from 91–212 copies.
We performed insertion site profiling for 8 out of the 13 retrotransposon families and confirmed multiple
insertions of these elements across the Vitis genus. Insertional polymorphism analysis and dating of full-length
copies based on their LTR divergence demonstrated that each family has a particular amplification history, with
71% of the identified copies being inserted within the last 2 million years.
Conclusion: The strategy we used efficiently delivered new Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon sequences,
increasing the total number of characterized grapevine retrotrotransposons from 3 to 13. We provide insights
into the representation and dynamics of the 13 families in the genome. Our data demonstrated that each family
has a particular amplification pattern, with 7 families having copies recently inserted within the last 0.2 million year.
Among those 7 families with recent insertions, three retain the capacity for activity in the grape genome today.

Background
Sequencing of whole genomes reveals the predominant
amount of transposable element DNA they contain, as
well as how transposable elements have shaped the
genome. Four plant genomes are now fully sequenced:
Arabidopsis [1], rice [2], black cottonwood [3] and more
recently two grapevine cultivars [4,5]. Annotation
revealed that the amount of repetitive DNA depended on
the species, with repetitive DNA composing ~10% of the
Arabidopsis genome (125 Mbp), ~35% of rice genome
(389 Mbp), and ~41.4% of the grapevine genome (487
Mbp). Analysis of repeated DNA sequences carried out in
these genomes, as well as in larger cereal genomes not yet
fully sequenced, has shown that insertion of long terminal
repeat (LTR) retrotransposons of the two main superfamilies, Ty3/gypsy-like and Ty1/copia-like are the major
components of intergenic regions.
Retrotransposons are mobile elements that are closely
related to retroviruses in their structure and life cycle [6].
Active retrotransposons begin the process of transposition
when RNA is transcribed from the original retrotransposon insertion in the genome. The intermediate RNA transcript is reverse-transcribed into DNA by a
retrotransposon-encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme,
and the DNA is inserted by additional retrotransposonencoded enzymes into the host genome at a new location,
thus increasing the copy number of the retrotransposon
family [7]. The generation and reverse-transcription of the
RNA intermediate is what distinguishes retrotransposons
from DNA transposons such as the Ac/Ds elements in
maize, which are excised by transposon-encoded enzymes
from their original insertion site and moved directly to a
new insertion site without an RNA intermediate [8,9]. The
copy-and-paste cycle of retrotransposition in the host
genome requires the synthesis of specific proteins
encoded by two major retrotransposon genes, gag and pol.
The Ty1/copia [10,11] and the Ty3/gypsy [12] superfamilies differ from each other in the order of domains
within the pol gene, as well as in their degree of sequence
conservation. Specifically in Ty1/copia elements, the pol
gene encodes the protease, integrase, reverse transcriptase
(RT), and RnaseH domains in that order from the 5' end
of the gene. The enzymatic functions encoded in each of
these domains are required to synthesize an extrachromosomal DNA daughter copy by reverse-transcription from
the intermediate RNA prior to its reinsertion into the
genome. As the process of reverse transcription is highly
error-prone due to the lack of proofreading, the daughter
copies can differ from the master copy [13]. Moreover,
individual copies can also diverge independently by
mutation following their insertion into the genome.
Therefore, one hallmark of retroelements is the genetic
heterogeneity of individual copies belonging to the same
family [14].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/469

Despite the heterogeneity within retrotransposon families, effective grouping of elements into phylogeneticallysupported clusters of related insertions followed by assessment of the level and timing of divergence within those
clusters is necessary for informative analysis. The RT
domain has the slowest relative rate of change among all
retroelement proteins, while the gag domain has a rate of
change more than twice as high [15]. Because of the extent
of sequence conservation within the reverse transcriptase
protein, the use of sequence comparisons of reverse transcriptase domains I and VII has been proposed to group
retrotransposons into a family when the amino acid identity with other members is ≥90% and into a superfamily
when their identity is ≥75% [16]. While these are effective
criteria for grouping individual insertions into meaningful clusters, better methods exist for determining the age
of an individual insertion in the genome. Because of the
mechanism of transposition, the two LTRs at each end of
a retrotransposon are theoretically identical at the time of
their insertion [17-19]. After insertion, the 5' and 3' LTRs
begin to evolve independently and diverge from each
other in sequence. Thus, the sequence divergence between
the 5' and 3' LTRs of an individual element can be used to
estimate the time since insertion at a specific locus [20].
Various strategies have been employed to identify retrotransposon sequences in genomes. Prior to the determination of the complete genomic sequence of the organism,
full-length or parts of Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon were
identified by virtue of their presence within coding
sequence being characterized, such as Tnt1 in the tobacco
nitrate reductase gene [21] or Vine-1 in a grape Adhr gene
[22]. Others insertions have been identified through their
contribution to an important phenotypic character such
as the color of grape skins associated with the presence of
the Gret1 retrotransposon in the promoter region of
VvMybA1 [23]. Following the completion of genomic
sequencing of Arabidopsis, retroelement sequences have
also emerged from computer-based sequence similarity
searches in genomic databases [24]. Few techniques exist
to identify explicitly retrotransposon sequences in
genomes prior to the characterization of the complete
genome sequence for an organism. To address this need,
Pearce et al. developed a PCR-based method to identify
experimentally Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon LTR
sequences of any higher plant, and verified its utility by
isolating novel LTR sequences from pea, broad bean and
Norway spruce [25]. Following this procedure, Riccioni et
al. have isolated Tmt1, the first LTR-retrotransposon from
ectomycorrhizal fungi of the genus Tuber that shows relatedness to Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons [26].
Because retrotransposons make a significant contribution
to the size, organization and genetic diversity of genomes,
characterization of grapevine retrotransposons is impor-

tant. Three retrotransposons were described prior to the
grape whole-genome sequencing: a unique copy of Vine1, a Ty1/copia-like element [22] and of Gret1, a Ty3/gypsylike element [23] and the Tvv1 family [27,28]. The grape
genome sequence has recently been obtained from two
sources: a highly homozygous grape line PN40024 [4]
and the Pinot noir cultivar [5]. These genomic resources
make possible the characterization in silico of grape retrotransposons. Annotation of grapevine transposable elements in the sequence derived from both sources revealed
a large prevalence of retrotransposons over transposons.
In the PN40024 sequence, the most abundant transposable elements corresponded to Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons, with an uneven distribution over the grape
chromosomes, and mainly restricted to low gene density
regions and introns [4]. In contrast, within the Pinot noir
genomic sequence the most prevalent retrotransposons
corresponded to gypsy/athila-like elements [5]. In this
study, we extend the utility of the Pearce technique into
organisms with characterized, complete genomes. We first
discovered novel Ty1/copia-like families in the grapevine
genome through analysis of RnaseH-LTR sequences isolated by the Pearce technique from genomic DNA derived
from Pinot noir plant material. We then used the isolated
sequences as a highly diverse query set to perform a computer-based sequence similarity search against the completed grape genome sequence dataset. Supported by
phylogenic analysis, we distinguished novel families and
identified a canonic representative element for each family. Their phylogenic relationship with other reference
plant retrotransposons was studied. Based on LTR divergence, insertion dating of full-length copies belonging to
13 grapevine retrotransposon families was estimated in
order to study the dynamics of these families. Finally, the
sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP)
profiles [29] of 8 retrotransposon families were evaluated
in 10 Vitis accessions.

A data mining procedure from the grape genomic
sequence using the BLAST algorithm with the 18 unique
and 3 of the nearly identical sequences as queries yielded
21 different full-length retrotransposons harboring an
internal domain flanked by LTRs, twelve of them displaying perfect target duplication sites. Thus, the 3'-end
sequences of the retrotranpsosons identified by the Pearce
technique could be used to 'tag' a diverse set of full- or
nearly full-length retrotransposons within the completed
grape genome. A phylogenic analysis was conducted
based on the alignment of the amino acid sequence
located between reverse transcriptase domains I and VII
deduced from the upstream nucleic sequence of the 21
elements. Tvv1-VB [28], one of the two Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons previously characterized in the grapevine
genome were added to improve the comprehensiveness of
this analysis. The other, Vine 1, could not be included in
this analysis, as it lacks the RT-domain sequence that
forms the basis for this comparison. The Neighbor-Joining tree clustered the 21 elements into 10 distinct families,
which were also distinct from Tvv1-VB (Figure 1). The
largest family, Gentil, included eight elements, the Edel
family three elements and two families, Huben and Rangen, each included two elements. Finally, six families,
Brand, Cremant, Gans, Kastel, Noble and Wintz were represented by a single element. The domain order inside the
pol gene of the amino acid sequence suggested that all the
novel families identified by the Pearce technique were
Ty1/copia-like elements. The clustering data were confirmed by evaluating the identity level of the partial RT
domains as suggested by Bowen and McDonald [16]. This
level was ≥79% within elements classified in the same
family, and ranged from 35–67% for elements classified
into distinct Ty1/copia families. The identity level of the
partial domains ranged from 12–21% for comparisons
between Gret1, a Ty3/gypsy element, and the various Ty1/
copia families.

Results

Representation of the 13 families in the grapevine genome
The BLAT program was used to extract the paralogous copies of the ten families from the grapevine genome along
with Tvv1-VB, Vine-1 and Gret1. A total of 1709 sequence
matches were identified, with the copy number per family
ranging from 91 to 212. The families with the highest
copy numbers were Gentil (212), Edel (187), Noble (185),
and Gret1 (173) while Huben and Kastel (91) had the lowest copy number (Additional file 1). For all families except
Gret1, copies longer than the reference size were found. In
particular, one Edel element contains a long insertion that
extends its size to over 382% of the reference copy. Generally, all families had a median length below that of the
reference query, indicating that most of the copies were
truncated, but with a high sequence identity to the reference sequence (median range 0.80–0.97). Using Vine-1 as
the query, most of the additional insertions also corre-

Characterization of ten new Ty1/copia-like
retrotransposon families of the grapevine genome
Our application of the technique of Pearce et al. [25] to
the grapevine genome resulted in the isolation of 27 putative retrotransposon sequences. Among these putative retrotransposon sequences, 24 contained an identifiable
portion of the 3'-end of Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons
including a putative RnaseH domain, the polypurine tract
(PPT), and varying amounts of the 3'LTR sequence. Eighteen of them were unique and six almost identical (subsequently characterized as Edel sequences). None of the
fragments we identified were similar enough to one of the
three grapevine retrotransposon families previously characterized to be considered additional insertions within
those previously characterized families.

spond to truncated copies. One larger copy was 107.6% of
the reference Vine-1 copy length, but the additional
sequence in this insertion does not code for the RTRnaseH domain that is lacking in the reference Vine-1 element [22].
Considering that all retrieved copies likely were equal in
length to their corresponding reference sequences at the
time of their insertion, they would represent a total theoretical DNA quantity of 8.9 Mb added to the genome by
their specific amplification. The Gret1 family, because of a
reference copy size of 10,422 bp, and Noble, due to a combination of large reference copy size and high genomic
copy number among the Ty1/copia families in the grape
genome, would likely have contributed the greatest to the
retroelement DNA content. Summing all actual retroelement insertion lengths, a residual amount of 4.8 Mb of
retrotransposon DNA (representing 1.24% of the
PN40024 genome) remains in the genome, suggesting
that 47% of retrotransposon inserted sequence has been
removed between the time of insertion and the present
day. Copies classified into the 13 families are scattered
around all chromosomes as currently assembled with an
overall density of 4.43 copies per Mb (Table 1). However,
this distribution is not uniform. With 54 copies, chromosome 8 (21.56 Mb) has the lowest retrotransposon insertion density (2.50 insertion per Mb) while chromosome
16 (8.159 Mb) has a density almost a third higher (7.23
insertion per Mb). Most retrotransposon families seem to
be rather uniformly distributed on all chromosomes
except Gans, which is absent from 6 chromosomes but
present in 17 copies on chromosome 5.

Identification of the canonical copies
For each family, a canonical copy was identified among
elements whose length was at least 80% of the full-length
insertions identified by BLAT with an identity level higher
than 75%. The following additional criteria helped to
identify the canonical copy: (1) perfect 5 bp-duplication
of target sites, (2) the highest level of identity between 5'
and 3' LTR within a single insertion sequence, and (3)
longest, un-interrupted coding capacity within the gag-pol
ORF. These criteria are likely to identify the most recently
inserted and potentially active member of the family. The
criteria differ significantly from the consensus approach
that identifies ancestral, presumably active sequences
within retroelement families [30]. The 10 canonical elements selected varied in size from 4,086 to 5,519 bp, with
LTRs ranging from 147 to 502 bp (Additional file 2). For
eight of the families, LTRs begin and end with the dinucleotide inverted repeat TG...CA as observed for many LTRretrotransposons and retroviruses [31]. More precisely,
seven start with the four-nucleotide stretch TGTT, and
among them two, Brand and Rangen, end with the corresponding inverted stretch AACA. Huben and Wintz LTRs
begin with the four-nucleotide stretch TGTG and end with
TTCA and GTCA, respectively. Finally, Cremant LTRs begin
with the four-nucleotide stretch TAAC and end with
GTCA.

One Cremant, 3 Edel and 8 Noble elements showed a single
putative ORF uninterrupted by a stop-codon before the
PPT, corresponding to polyproteins that were 1,346,
1,298 and 1,486 amino acids long respectively, indicating
that they could be autonomous. By comparison with Ty1/

copia-like plant retrotransposons previously characterized,
the general organization of the putative ORFs of Cremant,
Edel and Noble elements is very similar both in structure
and in length, compared to the 1,296, 1,382, 1,328 and
1,447 amino acid-long ORF of the barley BARE-1 (acc. n°
Z17327), grapevine Tvv1-VB (acc. n° EU304807), tobacco
Tnt1 (acc. n° X13777), and Arabidopsis thaliana AtRE1
(acc. n° AB021265) retrotransposons, respectively. The
putative ORFs of the seven remaining elements were prematurely interrupted by a stop codon or a frameshift in
the coding regions. Although Gans, Gentil, Huben and
Wintz canonic copies lack a putative full-length polyprotein, the homology between LTRs (100%, 99.7%, 100%
and 99.3%, respectively) indicates that they moved
recently into their current insertion site (Additional file
2). The 8 Noble copies that are putatively active displayed
an ORF 4,458 bp-long but differed by their untranslated
leader (UTL) region located between the 5'LTR and the
ORF, which ranged in size from 578 to 632 bp-long.
Moreover, considering the 40 full-length Noble copies
identified by perfect host 5 bp-target sites, their UTL
region varied from 269 bp to 695 bp (average 610 bp),
and all started with the sequence TGGTATCAGAGCC
which corresponds to the PBS. A detailed analysis of the
UTL sequence within 12 Noble elements indicated that
variations in size of this region have essentially resulted
from large single deletions/insertions.
To elucidate the phylogenic relationships among the ten
novel families, Tvv1, Gret1, and 13 other plant Ty1/copialike retrotransposons, the amino acid sequences between
motifs I to VII of the RT were aligned [32]. In some cases,
grape retrotransposon families clustered more closely
with previously identified retrotransposon families in
other species than with other retrotransposon families in
grape (Figure 2).
Genomic paleontology
The insertion dates for 163 retrotransposon copies considered to be full-length and belonging to the 13 families of
this study (the 10 newly identified along with Gret1, Vine1, and Tvv1) were estimated by aligning the 5' and 3' LTR
sequence according to Vitte et al. [33]. This analysis (Figure 3) revealed that copy age ranged from ≤0.2–11 million years (My). One hundred and fifteen copies (70%)
were inserted within the last 2 My. Forty-five copies
belonging to 7 families (28% of the total number of fulllength copies) had identical 5' and 3'-LTRs, indicating
recent movement at the limit of detection (0% divergence
theoretically corresponding to an insertion within the last
0.2 My) for this analysis. Two types of insertion age patterns within retroelement families were obtained, reflecting distinct evolutionary histories and activities of
particular families. Some families had a continuous distribution of insertion dates such as Edel (1–5 Mya) or Gentil

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/469

(1–7 Mya). In contrast, other families show discrete
groups of copies inserted at the same date such as Tvv1
(recent, 3 and 7 Mya) or Noble (recent and 0.5 Mya) possibly reflecting different bursts of amplification.
Insertion pattern of 8 retrotransposon families within the
genus Vitis
To visualize the distribution of copies belonging to 8 of
the retrotransposon families across the Vitis genus, a set of
10 Vitis accessions including a subset of 7 accessions of
the V. vinifera species was chosen. For each retrotransposon family, S-SAP insertion patterns differed both by the
number of scored bands and by the polymorphism level
for all accessions (Figure 4). In the Vitis set, the 8 patterns
yielded a total of 31 to 70 scored bands ranging in size
from 125–573 bp, depending on the family (Table 2).
This number decreased to 19–50 scored bands within the
V. vinifera subset. In both sets, the lowest number of
scored S-SAP bands was obtained for Edel and the highest
for Huben. The percentage of polymorphic bands ranged
from 85.7–100% within the Vitis set and from 54.5–
94.7% within V. vinifera subset. The highest number of
bands shared by accessions in both sets corresponded to
Gans insertions while only one Edel insertion was common to the 7 V. vinifera accessions.

Discussion
Identification of the novel retrotransposon families
Combining an RnaseH-LTR analysis of sequences isolated
using the technique described by Pearce et al. [25] with a
computer-based sequence similarity search in the wholegenome grapevine sequence, we have identified ten novel
Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon families. None of the
sequences identified in this study belong to a grapevine
retrotransposon family previously described. This result
demonstrates effective complementation of bench laboratory and in silico techniques, enhancing the benefits of
either used alone. If standard laboratory cloning techniques (e.g. genome 'walking') were used to obtain complete retrotransposon sequence from the 3'-end sequences
isolated by the Pearce technique, considerable time and
expense would have been devoted to the subsequent procedures and necessary reagents. Full-length elements were
effectively cloned in silico using the sequences identified
by the Pearce technique as a query for genomic searches.
However, if a purely in silico approach had been employed
to isolate new retrotransposon sequence from grape using
only previously known retrotransposon sequences from
other species as a query, the more divergent elements in
grape would have been overlooked. Thus, our work
expands the utility of the Pearce technique from plants
with little to no available genomic sequence data available through those plants with fully characterized
genomes.

S-SAP data were obtained using forward primers designed from 8 retrotransposons in combination with the same Eco-AG adapter primer.

Among the 24 sequences containing an identifiable portion of the 3'-end of retrotransposons, 18 were unique
and six almost identical (corresponding to the Edel element family). Full-length retrotransposon nucleotide
sequence was then identified from the grape genome by
querying in BLAST with the 3'-end of the retrotransposon
identified by the Pearce technique along with pre-determined total length criteria (see Materials and Methods).
Clustering of the 21 different full-length retrotransposons
identified by BLAST into distinct families was based on
the alignment of their corresponding amino acid
sequences between reverse transcriptase motifs I to VII
[16]. Ten families were identified, with insertion numbers
ranging from an single to 8 element insertions. The
observed level of identity when comparing amino acid
sequences was greater than 79% between elements clustered in the same family, while it decreased from 35–67%
between elements classified within differing Ty1/copia
families, and further drops from 12–21% between any
member of the Ty1/copia families and Gret1, a unique
grapevine gypsy element. However, within the corresponding amino acid region, the identity values we obtained are
lower than those proposed by Bowen and McDonald [16]
for grouping a particular element into a family (>90%
identity) and into a superfamily (>75% identity). In our
study, amino acid identity values alone did not suggest a
clear-cut discrimination point sufficient to classify
unknown elements, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic
analysis was more informative.
The ten families we identified were all related to Ty1/copia
superfamily, as expected from a technique employing
primers designed to target Ty1/copia RnaseH motifs. However, using the same procedure, Tmt1, a Tuber LTR-retrotransposon was isolated. Its relatedness to Ty3/gypsy,
retrotransposon superfamily was further established [26]
showing that the Pearce method is also suitable to isolate
gypsy elements. The classification into families of the PCRamplified fragments revealed an over-representation the
two families Gentil and Edel which were further shown to

have the highest copy numbers in the grape genome,
whereas six families have been identified from a unique
fragment among them Noble that showed as many copies
as Edel. Finally seven families start with the four-nucleotide stretch TGTT. Thus, the Pearce technique may have
additional biases for sequence isolation within the Ty1/
copia group.
Genomic fraction of the genome occupied by 13 grapevine
retrotransposon families
The BLAT program was used to extract from the PN40024
genome a total of 1709 copies paralogous to the 13
canonical copies representing the families identified in
this study at the most stringent criteria for seeding alignments based on sequences of 95% and greater similarity
over 40 bases of length or more. BLAT also detected a
small number of perfect sequence matches as short as 16
bases that we have taken in consideration. Because of the
stringent identification parameters we used, the copy
number of these families could be underestimated. Only
copies flanked by perfect 5 bp-duplication target sites that
result from repair of the integration event were considered, in order to eliminate chimerical copies that could
have resulted from errors introduced during genome
assemblage. No apparent conservation between 5 bpdirect repeats flanking the 10 canonical elements were
observed, only predominance for A-rich sites.

Excluding Gret1, a total of 1,536 Ty1/copia-like copies
belonging to the 12 families cover 1.03% of the PN40024
genome. This number can be compared to the 17,293
occurrences (5.16%) identified in the PN40024 genome
by BlastX annotation or to the 56,890 occurrences
(8.35%) identified by manual annotation of Ty1/copia
superfamily [4]. The 1,536 occurrences constitute a total
DNA amount of 3,771.48 Kb, which corresponds to
8.88% of 24,640.8 Kb occupied by the 17,293 occurrences
and to 2.69% of 39,848.3 Kb occupied by the 56,890
occurrences. Gret1, the only Ty3 gyspy retrotransposon
considered in this study covers the largest fraction of the

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:469

genome, probably due to its length. The 173 identified
copies covering 1,028.36 Kb (0.21%) of the PN40024
genome are a part of the 9,632 occurrences of the total
fraction of Ty3/gypsy superfamily that cover 17,659.6 Kb
and of the 14,093 occurrences covering 15,339.8 Kb identified by both annotations. Thus, the 173 occurrences correspond to 1.79% to 1.22% of the total Ty3/gypsy
superfamily depending on the annotation method. Overall, these data indicate that these retrotransposon insertions constitute only a small fraction of the total
retrotransposon DNA content of the grape genome.
Genomic distribution of copies belonging to the ten families is not uniform, with chromosome 16 having the
highest density and chromosome 8 the lowest. However,
this result has to be cautiously considered since a large
number of copies belong to scaffolds that remain to be
attributed to a particular chromosome. Retrotransposon
density seems to be independent of the density of resistance gene analog (RGA) markers since these two chromosomes are very poor in mapped RGA loci [34]. Our results
are in general agreement with the uneven distribution of
transposable elements over the grape chromosomes, with
insertions mainly restricted to low gene density regions
[4].
Regulation and functionality of the different
retrotransposon families
A main feature of the novel families, except Brand, is their
LTR size ranging from 147 to 373 bp, shorter that most of
the plant retrotransposons previously characterized such
as Ta1, Tnt1, and BARE1 with LTRs of 514, 610 and 1,829
bp, respectively. This common feature of relatively short
LTRs could then characterize grapevine Ty1/copia retrotransposons. Seven families begin with TGTT, a fournucleotide stretch that also starts many LTR-retrotransposons such as Tvv1, Vine-1, Tst1, Tto1, PDR1, Ta1 or
copia. However, neither Tvv1 nor Vine1 sequences were
captured by this application of the Pearce technique in
spite of their short LTRs of 149 and 287 bp, respectively,
and starting with the four-nucleotide stretch TGTT.

In the Noble family, copies differ by their UTL region sized
from 269–695 bp. A sequence analysis determined that
this size variation is essentially caused by large deletions/
insertions within the internal UTL region. Noble family
elements are similar to Tvv1 elements in the source of
their size variation within this region [35].
One to eight copies encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol polyprotein were identified for three families, indicating that these families could be still
autonomous and active. For the others, no autonomous
copies were identified. Our in silico analysis ultimately
showed that no full-length copies of Vine 1, first described

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/469

truncated in its 3' ORF sequence [22] are present in the
grapevine genome (Additional file 1). A subset of presumably non-autonomous retrotransposons had identical 5'
and 3'-LTRs indicating that they were recently inserted at
that locus. It is possible that PN40024, an accession bred
to near homozygosity, has lost the corresponding active
copies during the successive cycles of self-fertilization.
However, these functional copies could still remain in the
heterozygous parent and in other grapevine accessions as
well. It is also possible that trans complementation can
occur between autonomous and non-autonomous families, resulting in the movement of retrotransposons that
do not themselves code for all of the necessary replication
enzymatic machinery.
Dating of insertion of the different families
S-SAP insertion patterns of 8 retrotransposon families on
10 Vitis accessions showed that these retrotransposon
families are present across the Vitis genus. Only a few
insertion sites are fixed in all accessions, which should
have been maintained during speciation. Most of the
scored bands are polymorphic, indicating that these families have been active after speciation across the genus.
Differences in the number of bands shared in both sets
can be interpreted in the light of the differences in activity
level between retrotransposon families. The lower polymorphism level of Gans could indicate that activity of this
family was confined to the distant past, whereas the high
polymorphism of Edel could indicate more recent activity.
To provide more precise insights into the evolutionary
histories and activities of different families, time since
insertion of full-length copies belonging to 13 families
was estimated. However, the stringent parameters that we
used to retrieve full-length copies has probably eliminated
the most degenerated, thus the oldest, copies. In our analysis 71% of the full-length retrotransposon copies were
inserted within the last 2 My, possibly thanks to a burst of
retrotransposition. Finally, in a chronology of the insertions of the different families, the older Kastel copy being
~11 million years old is in agreement with paleo-botanical data that record the first Vitaceae fossils from the
Miocene (23.0 to 5.3 My) [36].

Conclusion
Combining a molecular genetic approach with a computer-based study, we have identified ten novel grapevine
Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon families, none of them
belonging to a retrotransposon family previously
described. Our study has increased the number of grapevine retrotrotransposons from 3 to 13. Studying the characteristics of the different families, we show that at least
three families could be still autonomous and active with
1–8 copies encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol
polyprotein. We have further characterized the representation of each of the 13 grapevine retrotransposon families

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:469

in the genome, including in our study Tvv1, Vine-1 and
Gret1. Vine-1 and Gret1 have both been previously represented by only a single copy characterized in the genome.
Altogether, we have retrieved 1,709 copies belonging to
the 13 families in this study. They currently represent
1.24% of the sequenced genome, but this corresponds to
only half of the amount of retrotransposon DNA present
at the time of insertion. Lastly, we show the presence of 8
retrotransposon families across the Vitis genus, with S-SAP
insertion polymorphism indicating their activity after speciation. While the amplification history of the 13 families
varies both in timing and between families, a majority of
copies belonging to 7 families were inserted within the
last 2 My. To our knowledge, this study is the first extensive census of LTR-retrotransposons of the grapevine
genome.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
3'-end retroelement sequences were isolated from pinot
noir S15. S-SAP fingerprinting was performed on a set of
10 Vitis accessions including 1 accession each of Muscadinia rotundifolia, Vitis amurensis and V. riparia, and 7
exemplars of the V. vinifera species, represented by
PN40024, 5 accessions of cultivated grapevine varieties
and 1 accession of a wild vine. Total genomic DNA extractions were performed using the Qiagen Plant extraction
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's
protocols.
Sequence isolation
Isolation of 3'-end retroelement sequences was performed
according to Pearce et al. [25] with modifications. The first
amplification was performed using both published primers: an adapter primer targeting the synthetic adapter
sequence ligated to the genome fragments produced by
restriction digestion paired with a biotinylated retroelement-specific primer targeting RnaseH motif 1. Following
bead-based recovery of the biotinylated product, a nested
amplification was performed using an adapter primer
modified from the published sequence by the addition of
a single selective base at the 3'-end of the primer. The
modification of the adapter primer reduced the formation
of products resulting from adapter to adapter amplification and increased the recovery of retroelement-containing DNA sequences. The modified adapter primer was
paired with the published retroelement-specific primer
targeting the downstream sequence RnaseH motif 2. PCR
products were cleaned up using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) before being cloned
using the Promega pGEM T-Easy cloning kit (Promega,
Madison, WI) with Invitrogen DH5 E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's protocols.

Sequence analysis
Computer-assisted analysis of the twenty-seven 3'-end retroelement sequence fragments was performed in DNASTAR SeqManII. Full-length corresponding elements were
located in the grapevine genome using Genoscope BLAST
server [37] by identifying LTRs separated by 4–5 Kb along
with target site duplications that mark retrotransposon
insertion. They were then individually examined for position of their LTRs, UTL and ORFs in DNAsis 2.1 (Hitachi
Software Engineering Co, Ltd) and Vector NTI 7 (InforMax Inc). Amino acid sequences between reverse transcriptase motifs I to VII were deduced from the nucleic
acid sequences. MEGA v3.1 [38] was used to achieve multiple alignment of partial amino acid sequences by Clustal
W and to draw Neighbor-Joining tree using the Poisson
distance model. Amino acid sequences were compared
two by two using the EMBOSS Pairwise Alignment Algorithms [39]. The 10 families were named after wines produced or vineyards cultivated in the Alsace region of
France.
Data mining
The BLAT program was used to extract the paralogous copies of the ten families from the PN40024 genome [40].
BLAT on DNA is designed to find sequences displaying
stretches of 40 bases or more in length with 95% and
greater similar to the query. It also finds perfect shorter
sequence matches. All matches that were at least 80% of
the length of the full-length insertions identified by BLAT
and had a similarity level higher than 75% were considered to identify canonical copies. The nucleotide data of
the 10 reported canonical copies have been deposited in
Repbase database. Using gag-pol polyprotein sequences
available from public databases, we selected amino acid
sequences between reverse transcriptase motifs I to VII to
build the Neighbor-Joining tree based on the Poisson distance model.
Genomic paleontology
The insertion of full-length copies were dated based on
the divergence of the 5' and 3'-LTR sequence of each copy,
as proposed by San Miguel et al. [20]. LTR sequences were
aligned in MEGA v3.1 and the observed divergence was
corrected following the Jukes and Cantor molecular evolution model, as proposed by Vitte et al. [33]. This corrected divergence was then translated to estimate the
insertion date of the elements at their present location,
using the average base substitution rate derived from the
grass adh1-adh2 region of 6.5 × 10-9 substitution per site
per year [41], given the assumption of a uniform mutation
rate in grapevine.
S-SAP analysis
S-SAP insertion patterns were produced largely following
the protocol described by Waugh et al. [29]. LTR forward

primers for 8 retrotransposon families were designed
from the region of the LTR with the highest level of conservation for each family. Each LTR-specific primer was
used together with the same adaptor primer Eco-AG,
which had two selective nucleotides. Retrotransposon
primers were IRD 800 5' labeled (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany) to resolve PCR fragments by electrophoresis on a 41 cm long 5.5% acrylamide gel (KB Plus
5.5% gel matrix, Li-Cor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NB) in a
Li-Cor 4000 L automated DNA sequencer (Lincoln, NB).
IRD41-labeled M13 fragments (50–1,206 bp) were used
as size standard.

For each accession and each retrotransposon, S-SAP
amplifications were performed at least twice and loaded
on independent gels to establish consistency. S-SAP bands
in each individual lane were detected using the RFLPscan
(version 2.1) software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The distance from the retroelement-specific primer binding site
within the LTR to the genomic portion of the fragment
ranged from 50 bp to 106 bp. Thus, only reproducible
bands greater than 125 bp in length corresponding to
insertion sites were scored.
