Abstract
Introduction: In order to identify priorities for building integrated surveillance systems that
effectively model and predict human risk of zoonotic diseases, there is a need for improved
understanding of the practical options for linking surveillance data of animals and humans. We
conducted an analysis of the literature and characterized the linkage between animal and human
health data. We discuss the findings in relation to zoonotic surveillance and the linkage of human
and animal data.
Methods: The Canary Database, an online bibliographic database of animal-sentinel studies was
searched and articles were classified according to four linkage categories.
Results: 465 studies were identified and assigned to linkage categories involving: descriptive,
analytic, molecular, or no human outcomes of human and animal health. Descriptive linkage was
the most common, whereby both animal and human health outcomes were presented, but without
quantitative linkage between the two. Rarely, analytic linkage was utilized in which animal data was
used to quantitatively predict human risk. The other two categories included molecular linkage, and
no human outcomes, which present health outcomes in animals but not humans.
Discussion: We found limited use of animal data to quantitatively predict human risk and listed
the methods from the literature that performed analytic linkage. The lack of analytic linkage in the
literature might not be solely related to technological barriers including access to electronic
database, statistical software packages, and Geographical Information System (GIS). Rather, the
problem might be from a lack of understanding by researchers of the importance of animal data as
a 'sentinel' for human health. Researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the
value of animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk and consider analytic methods for
linking animal and human data. Qualitative work needs to be done in order to examine researchers'
decisions in linkage strategies between animal and human data.

Introduction
In recent years, there has been increasing awareness on the
part of both human and animal health professionals that

disease events in animal populations may have direct relevance to human health. As with the analogy of the
"canary in the coal mine", animals may serve as sentinels

of human health threats in the environment, and work by
Halliday and others [1] have focused on establishing a
framework to facilitate surveillance efforts. Examples of
sentinels include the emergence of zoonotic diseases in
wildlife populations concurrent with a novel outbreak of
disease in humans such as West Nile Virus (WNV) [2,3],
SARS [4,5], and Avian Influenza [6,7]. As a result of these
recent events, there has been a heightened emphasis on
the use of surveillance efforts in both domestic and wild
animal populations. This includes the worldwide surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza. In 2006, the
United States Geological Survey, sampled more than
193,000 birds in the US alone as part of their Wild Bird
Surveillance Plan [8]. On a global scale, The Global Avian
Network for Surveillance (GAINS) surveillance system,
funded by US AID, has one of the leading avian surveillance systems and has over 100,000 birds included in
their electronic database [9].
This awareness of the shared risk faced by animal and
human populations has led to a call for a "One Medicine"
approach [10] (now called "One Health"), of communication and interdisciplinary practice between veterinary
and human medical professionals. A key part of such an
approach is "Joint cross-species disease surveillance and
control efforts in public health" (Kahn, L., B. Kaplan, and
T.P. Monath: One Health Mission Statement, unpublished). There have been a number of attempts to link
human and animal health data such as the tracking of syndromic events in pet animals [11] or the collection of data
on sentinel birds for West Nile infection control [12-21].
Controversy exists about the value of such approaches.
For example while Eidson et al reported that dead crow
clusters predicted human WNV risk [22], Brownstein et al
have reported that dead crow sightings are less reliable
than mosquito surveillance for prediction of human WNV
risk [15]. Similarly, no clear correlations have been published to date from ongoing surveillance of pet populations. Perhaps the clearest example of routine use of
animal disease data is in national and state rabies surveillance, in which 49 states and Puerto Rico participated in
the monitoring and reporting of nearly 7,000 animal
cases (and 3 human cases) to the CDC [23].
Animal health surveillance efforts and human health surveillance efforts are often separate initiatives resulting in
the data being stored in separate and potentially vastly different databases. Careful attention and planning must be
done if these data sources are to be effectively linked.
There is a belief that automated systems to integrate public health data can enhance the surveillance process. The
design and development of these systems requires experts
in public health informatics, which is the study of the
acquisition, storage, and management of electronic public

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/15

health data for identifying and controlling health issues in
the population [24]. Much of the public health informatics work has been in the development of biosurveillance
systems that automatically merge disparate health, environmental, geographical, consumer, and population data
to model and detect aberrations that might signify a public health priority. Examples include the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Systems (RODS) [25] and
the Automated Epidemiologic Geotemporal Integrated
Surveillance Systems (AEGIS) [26] that use electronic hospital syndromic information to predict bioterrorism and
naturally occurring outbreaks such as influenza.
In order to identify priorities for building integrated surveillance systems that effectively model and predict
human risk of zoonotic disease, there is a need for
improved understanding of the practical options for linking surveillance data of animals and humans. For this
study, we performed an analysis of the Canary Database
[27], an online resource for literature on the animal-sentinel interface, in order to examine the use of how animal
and human data is linked for analysis purposes. The
Canary Database does not represent the entire spectrum
of epidemiological papers of animal-human events. However, the purpose of this paper is not an exhaustive search
of the literature on animal-human health events. Rather,
the intent is to highlight the use of various linkage strategies for animal and human data and discuss implications
of these strategies for public health research. In addition,
both humans and non-human animals share the same
ecosystem and while it is possible that animals can serve
as sentinels for humans, there are times when a sentinel
event in humans has implications for animal health. The
Canary Database, however, is oriented toward animals as
sentinels for human health hazards, therefore for the
remainder of this paper, we use the term 'animal sentinel'
to mean an instance in which a non-human animal might
indicate concurrent or future health risk to humans. However, we believe that our findings regarding linkage
between human and animal data streams have relevance
to both human health and animal health.

Methods
The Canary Database [27] is a publicly accessible online
database of studies in the biomedical literature concerned
with animals as sentinels of zoonotic, environmental, and
toxic effects on human health. Curators of this database
include both human and animal health professionals
who periodically search the medical bibliographic databases such as PubMed and identify, using predetermined
algorithms, studies that analyze the effects of zoonotic
and environmental health hazards on free ranging animal
populations, including companion, livestock, and wildlife animals. Articles are curated into the database accord-

BMC Veterinary Research 2009, 5:15

ing to study methodology, hazards and outcomes studied,
animal species, and location. Currently, there are over
1,600 articles in the database going back to 1966.
Using the advanced search feature in the Canary Database,
an initial group of papers were retrieved that described at
least a shared health outcome between animals and
humans or a shared exposure (e.g. of an environmental
toxin). Then, two of the reviewers (MS and LO) reviewed
the curated information for each of these papers and if
needed, the papers themselves, to determine if they were
original investigations. Review articles and media analysis
(newspaper or magazine articles) were not included. In
addition, papers describing laboratory-based toxicology
work were not included.
For each paper in the study, we defined their linkage category, based on consensus among the authors, to be at least
one of four possibilities:
â« Ø â¬Analytic: Studies that use quantitative methods to
assess human risk. For example, studies that use cases
of WNV found in dead crows to quantify the risk of the
disease in humans, would fall under this category.
â« Ø â¬Descriptive: Studies that describe the health outcomes
in both animals and humans, but do not attempt a
quantitative linkage between the two. For example, a
seroprevalence study that lists the number of positive
Hantavirus cases in both rodents and humans in a particular area would fall under this category.
â« Ø â¬Molecular: Studies in which the investigators use
molecular epidemiological techniques to show similarities between strains of a pathogen occurring in animals compared to humans, thereby providing
evidence as to whether or not species crossover of
infection has occurred. For example, studies that use
phylogenetic algorithms to assess the lineage of H5N1
Avian Influenza strains isolated in animals and
humans would fall under this category.
â« Ø â¬No human outcomes. Studies in which no outcomes in
humans are considered. These studies often provide
evidence of exposure in humans, but do not discuss
outcomes related to human health. For example, a
study that assesses the bioaccumulation of mercury in
tilapia would fall under this category. Humans are
considered exposed since they could eat the fish or
drink the contaminated water but outcomes are not
assessed.
Thus, the first three categories represent original investigations that describe health outcomes in both animals and
humans, while the final category describes all papers that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/15

include only animal outcomes or no health outcomes at
all.
Each paper was assigned to at least one of these four linkage categories, with some papers counted in two categories. For example a paper that describes the seroprevalence
of a field study of Nipah Virus in fruit bats and humans
and then develops a phylogenetic tree to assess the similarities would be considered both a descriptive linkage
and a molecular linkage.

Results
At the time of this study, Canary contained 1,661 articles
from 1966 to 2007. Of these, 465 (28%) were judged to
be appropriate original epidemiological investigations
that related animal disease data to human disease data.
These 465 papers were further analyzed.
Table 1 shows that the majority of studies linked animal
and human data in a descriptive fashion (57%), thus
describing or listing the number of cases in animals and
humans without an attempt to predict future risk based
on the results. This often includes the trapping of suspected animal reservoirs that are located in the vicinity of
confirmed or suspected human cases. In these types of
studies, results are often reported as percentage of positive
cases in animals and percentage of positive cases in
humans. Complicated or in-depth statistical analysis is
often not conducted in descriptive linkage studies. Papers
that used analytic methods ([2,13,15,18,20,21,28-50]) to
link animal and human data consisted of 6% of the articles retrieved and the methods used in each are summarized in Table 2. For each paper, the primary author, the
zoonotic disease, the animals studied (domestic, livestock, or wildlife), and our summary of the methods for
analytic linkage are presented.
Analytic Linkage of Human and Animal Data Using
Regression
Popular linkage approaches included multiple regression
(Logistic, Linear, Poisson), spatial analysis (Cluster analysis, Digital mapping, etc.) and odds ratio/relative risk calculation. The purpose of these papers tended to use
infection, death, or contact with animals as the main independent variable to predict risk of infection in humans.

Many also used additional input variables such as interview and survey data to identify the most parsimonious
model. For example a paper by Dubey et al [30] studying
risk of Toxoplasmosis on US farms collected interview
data from farmers and collected blood and fecal specimens from animals and farmers as well as soil and water
samples. In order to study the association between the
seroprevalence of farmers, the authors combined the various animal specimen data with farmer interview data in
a logistic regression model. Seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in cats was the only variable found to be significant.
In another study, Brownstein et al [15] used a regression
model to study the value of non-human surveillance programs on predicting risk in humans. The authors used
data from the ArboNet system such as number of viruspositive birds, mosquitoes and humans and evaluated the
models predictive ability by assessing the coefficient of
determination (R2) [15].
Analytic Linkage of Human and Animal Data Using Spatial
Analysis
Many of the articles used spatial analysis in which georeferenced locations of infected cases or reported animal
deaths were considered. This demonstrates the growing
interest by epidemiologists and animal health researchers
in examining spatial factors in relation to animal and
human health monitoring. For example, the spatial scan
statistic, developed by Kulldorff [51], has been widely
used to identify disease clusters. The statistic scans temporal or spatial data, calculates the number of observed and
expected observations (infections, deaths, etc.) using a
shape (for spatial analysis) such as a circle or ellipse or an
interval (for temporal analysis). The method then uses the
likelihood ratio test to determine if the area inside the
shape is significantly different than the outside area
[51,52]. Statistical significance of the cluster with the maximum likelihood is then assessed by Monte Carlo simulation testing. Many of the analytic linkage papers used
spatial scan functions to identify clusters of events such as
animal deaths or infected cases of humans or animals. For
example, Brownstein et al. [29] studied vegetation index
data as a means to identify clusters of West Nile Virus in
mosquitoes in New York City in 1999 [29]. The authors

Probability model to estimate risk of human infection from
exposure to vectors using estimates including number of
vector bites per host per season and vector infection rate
Association between bird density and virus infection rates in
mosquitoes and humans by simple linear regression and
multivariate regression
Spatial scan statistic using Poisson distribution to predict
clusters of infected horses and humans by combining cases in
humans, horses, population data, location of the horses and
location of the patient
Stepwise Logistic regression to examine risk factors
associated with physical abuse and threats of abuse to family
pets including interview variables with abused and non-abused
women such as physical spousal abuse, verbal abuse, and
women's education level

obtained human case information for New York City in
1999 from the local health department, a census track
boundary map and population data from the US Census
Bureau, and vegetation data from a United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat image [29]. Kulldorff's spatial
scan statistic using a Poisson distribution model was used
to detect clusters of West Nile. Once the clusters were
detected, the authors used ANOVA to examine whether
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differed
between clusters and non-clusters and used Logistic
regression to determine if NDVI could identify census
tracks within clusters that had cases of WNV. The authors
concluded that mosquito and vegetation data, in conjunction with the spatial analysis might provide early evidence
of human WNV risk [29].
Analytic Linkage of Human and Animal Data Using
Mathematical Modeling
Another analytic linkage method for animal and human
data we found was mathematical modeling. Many
researchers use dynamic stochastic models in which simulated data based on various distributions is represented
as differential equations. For example, Li et al [36] used a
probability model to examine the relationship between
sentinel animals for transmission of arboviruses. As part
of their work, the authors examined the relationship
between various levels of vector bites per host per season
and the mean number of human cases of an arbovirus
[36]. Other calculated parameters in their model included
"vector infection rate" ([36], pg. 450), "probability of an
animal or human host becoming infected" ([36], pg. 450)
and "the number of seroconverted samples on each sampling date" ([36], pg. 450). The authors concluded that
human risk is "negatively related to the distance from the
vector epicenter" ([36], pg. 450). These models can then
be used as a means to predict risk of human infection
given actual ecological data.
Analytic Linkage of Human and Animal Data Using Risk
Ratios
Several of the papers that used analytic linkage of animal
and human data used direct calculation of risk ratios such
as relative risk and odds ratios. These can often be calcuPage 5 of 9

BMC Veterinary Research 2009, 5:15

lated directly using contingency tables. The ratios are
often used in active surveillance studies where the number
of observations and variables collected is relatively small.
For example Mannelli et al [37] calculated relative risk to
determine the association between occupation and exposure to tick bites for Lyme Disease, while Gurtler et al [33]
calculated the relative risk for the combined effect of T.
cruzi in dogs and children and infected Triatoma infestans
(insects). The authors performed a house-to-house survey
and performed laboratory analysis on all household
members, dogs, and Triatoma infestans. They determined
that a causal association existed between the presence of
infected dogs and infected insects [33].
Analytic Linkage of Human and Animal Data Using Cross
Correlation Functions
Cross-correlation function (CCF) has been used as a
method to identify leading indicators of disease outbreaks
[53]. The emphasis here is to examine the relationship
between time series [53] to determine the lead-lag correlation. CCF have been widely used to examine various
financial indices and the fluctuations in the stock market
[54]. Two of the papers in the Canary Database that use
analytic linkage used the cross-correlation function. In
Niklasson et al [42], the authors used CCF to examine the
relationship between human hantavirus infection and
vole density. The authors concluded that in the Fall
months, there was more of a concurrent relationship
between vole density and human infection, whereas in the
Spring, human infection was dependent on the density in
the preceding Fall months [42]. In this Swedish epidemiological study, the authors utilized national incidence
data from 1985â1992 and trapping of voles [42].

Discussion
Examples of public health scenarios in which animal data
can be used to inform decision making include:
1. Linkage of surveillance data streams through reporting of companion, livestock, or wildlife populations
in order to gauge human risk.
2. Surveys of animal reservoirs to support a specific
human outbreak investigation.
3. Surveys of animal reservoirs in the absence of a
known human outbreak to gauge human risk and
determine the need for public health and animal control measures.
4. Short-term surveys of unusual clusters of disease in
animals that can lead to hypothesis about human risk.
5. Intentional sentinels (captive chickens, cows, etc.)
followed in a cohort fashion to gauge increase or
decrease in human risk.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/5/15

6. Analysis and comparison of available human and
animal isolates of an infectious agent to monitor
genetic shifts in infectious agents.
Scenario 1 involves domestic or livestock animal medical
cases by veterinarians or general public reporting of wildlife (such as dead birds). The animal health data in this
scenario is reported to agencies such as the Departments
of Agriculture, Wildlife, or Public Health. Many of these
involve cases of suspected reportable animal diseases to
the Department of Agriculture or public sightings of dead
birds to the Department of Wildlife or Department of
Health. An example is the use of dead crow sightings for
West Nile Virus surveillance [20].
Scenario 2 involves outbreak investigation of human
cases by obtaining health data on animals. The majority of
disease surveillance in wildlife is short-term and often in
response to known cases or spread of the disease [55].
This generally involves trapping, seroprevalence, and
necropsy of wildlife in the vicinity of the human cases. It
might also involve the testing of domestic animals in the
belief of pet-owner transmission. These surveys are often
initiated by governmental agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Wildlife, or Public Health. An example is the investigation of anthrax in cattle and sheep on
numerous Australian farms [56].
Scenario 3 is short or long-term seroprevalence surveys,
typically of wildlife animals, to estimate the degree of
infection of a specific zoonotic disease in animals. These
surveys can be initiated by governmental agencies or also
the result of independent research by university scientists.
Trapping and testing rodents for plague in a country in
order to estimate the levels of infection in wildlife is an
example of this scenario [57].
Scenario 4 is similar to scenario 2, but is initiated by the
discovery of unusual animal deaths, not human deaths.
Scenario 5 involves the use of specific sentinel animals
(generally livestock) for long-term assessment of infection
rates. An example is the use of sentinel chickens and
horses for West Nile virus assessment as part of the
ArboNET surveillance program [58].
Scenario 6 differs from the other scenarios because of its
emphasis on laboratory techniques in the domain of
molecular epidemiology. The intention is to examine similarities between strains of a pathogen occurring in animals compared to humans, thereby providing evidence as
to whether or not species crossover of infection has
occurred. An example is the development of phylogenetic
trees to examine similarities between animal and human
strains of Hantavirus [59].

In our analysis, descriptive linkage was the most common
linkage category found. The use of animal data to quantitatively predict risk in human was limited. This lack of
analytic linkage can impact the development of automated public health informatics systems to support surveillance. Analytic linkage is inherent in early warning
surveillance systems for predicting risk in humans based
on a range of variables (syndromes, animals, behavior,
environment, etc.). For example, value has been shown in
the use of dead crows and infected mosquitoes for predicting human risk of West Nile Virus [2,15,20,22]. Without
this evidence, it is likely that much less funding would go
into development of early warning WNV systems that link
animal and human data. A lack of analytic linkage will
produce a lack of scientific merit for using animals as sentinels for estimating human risk. This is a global problem
as noted by Childs, that "as of 2006, there appears to be
little scientific, social, or political consensus that animalbased surveillance for zoonoses merits investment in
international infrastructure." pg. 423 [55]. The author
does note that recent collaborations by the World Health
Organization (WHO), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE), to develop GLEWS, an integrated earlywarning system, might signal a change in the right direction [55].

geographical comparisons. However, the lack of integrated informatics systems at animal and human agencies
makes analysis of longitudinal health and animal data difficult. Animal and human agencies that do not use these
systems to manage their case data make it difficult to integrate animal and human health data and conduct quantitative linkage. While it is encouraging that large numbers
of papers have attempted to look at linking animal and
human data, more emphases needs to be in quantitatively
linking animal and human data. This will provide more
scientific merit that animal data can be used as sentinels
for predicting human risk, and hopefully promote the
need for public health informatics surveillance systems to
automatically integrate the animal and human data. In
addition, the importance of the "One Medicine" [10] (or
"One Health") collaboration needs to be emphasized
across veterinary and human medicine through formal
education, conferences and workshops, journal articles,
and professional collaborations. An acceptance and belief
of one medicine will heighten the recognition for using
animal health data as a sentinel for determining risk in
humans. It will also emphasize the importance of quantitative linkage between the two domains for producing
empirical scientific evidence that will serve to strengthen
this initiative and the development of automated animalhuman informatics systems.

In addition descriptive linkage is suitable for public health
researchers looking at discrete events, but it can get overwhelming if there is too much data. The reliance on
descriptive linkage puts a burden on public health users
and also creates discrepancies in how different users interpret the results. For example, as more governmental
money has gone into the epidemiology of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), many studies have been
initiated and large amounts of data have been generated.
However, the onus is on the researcher to analyze the
descriptive data across all of these studies and draw conclusions without the aid of analytic methods for linking
the findings. Interpretation of the data determines if public health control measures should be implemented. For
zoonoses outbreaks, these measures can carry significant
financial consequences such as the slaughtering of animals, and the cessation of trade.

In our review of the Canary Database, we found different
strategies for analytic linkage including: multivariate
regression, direct calculation of risk ratios, spatial analysis
including scan statistics, cross-correlation functions, and
mathematical modeling. There are many other methods
that were not found that might also be useful for analytic
linkage of animal and human data. Other surveillance
approaches include Bayesian Networks, rule-based analysis, and various time-series methods [60]. The authors
here are not advocating one linkage approach over
another. Each situation is different depending on the
study goals, the prevalence of the disease in the area, additional variables collected, the number of observations,
how many years of data were collected, and access to statistical and spatial software. It is possible that the key barrier to analytic linkage is not technological, but rather the
lack of understanding of researchers of the importance of
animal data as a 'sentinel' for human health. Our study
highlighted that lack of animal-sentinel approaches in
epidemiology and listed methods from the literature for
performing these types of linkages. Researchers performing zoonotic surveillance should be aware of the value of
animal-sentinel approaches for predicting human risk
and consider analytic methods for linking animal and
human data. Table 2 lists examples of Arboviruses such as
West Nile Virus that use analytic linkage. As variables such
as crow mortality and mosquito abundance have shown
to be valuable for empirically predicting human risk, fol-

We believe the three scenarios that tend to have long-term
data collection (1, 3, and 5) benefit most from the use of
analytic linkage between human and animal data. For
example, scenario 1 is a long-term focus with passive data
collection that relies on the motivation of veterinarians or
the general public to report suspected cases. Scenario 1 is
well suited for public health informatics systems that
transfer, manage, and analyze longitudinal case data. The
collection of cases over many years allows for analytic
linkage of human and animal data through temporal and

low-up studies using additional data sources and analytic
linkage efforts have been performed. As other research initiatives in public health provide empirical evidence for
animal-sentinel surveillance, more scientific work that
uses analytic methods to link this information will be performed. Finally, efforts such as the One Health Initiative
[61], which focus on the collaboration of human and animal medicine, represent important collaborations to
address this lack of recognition between the value of animal-human linkage. Going forward, qualitative work
needs to be done in order to examine researchers' decisions in linkage strategies between animal and human
surveillance data.

Limitations
While the Canary Database is not an exhaustive compilation of all scientific studies relevant to issues of animal
sentinels for human health risk, it does represent a systematic attempt to sample the published scientific literature from 1966 to 2007 to identify such studies. It
therefore was a reasonable sample to use for this attempt
to characterize the nature of epidemiological linkages
between human and animal health data related to environmental exposure risks.
