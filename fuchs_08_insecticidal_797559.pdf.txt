Abstract
Background: Toxin complex (Tc) proteins termed TcaABC, TcdAB, and TccABC with
insecticidal activity are present in a variety of bacteria including the yersiniae.
Results: The tc gene sequences of thirteen Yersinia strains were compared, revealing a high degree
of gene order conservation, but also remarkable differences with respect to pseudogenes,
sequence variability and gene duplications. Outside the tc pathogenicity island (tc-PAIYe) of Y.
enterocolitica strain W22703, a pseudogene (tccC2'/3') encoding proteins with homology to TccC
and similarity to tyrosine phosphatases at its C-terminus was identified. PCR analysis revealed the
presence of the tc-PAIYe and of tccC2'/3'-homologues in all biotype 2–5 strains tested, and their
absence in most representatives of biotypes 1A and 1B. Phylogenetic analysis of 39 TccC sequences
indicates the presence of the tc-PAIYe in an ancestor of Yersinia. Oral uptake experiments with
Manduca sexta revealed a higher larvae lethality of Yersinia strains harbouring the tc-PAIYe in
comparison to strains lacking this island. Following subcutaneous infection of Galleria mellonella
larvae with five non-human pathogenic Yersinia spp. and four Y. enterocolitica strains, we observed a
remarkable variability of their insecticidal activity ranging from 20% (Y. kristensenii) to 90% (Y.
enterocolitica strain 2594) dead larvae after five days. Strain W22703 and its tcaA deletion mutant
did not exhibit a significantly different toxicity towards G. mellonella. These data confirm a role of
TcaA upon oral uptake only, and suggest the presence of further insecticidal determinants in
Yersinia strains formerly unknown to kill insects.
Conclusion: This study investigated the tc gene distribution among yersiniae and the phylogenetic
relationship between TccC proteins, thus contributing novel aspects to the current discussion
about the evolution of insecticidal toxins in the genus Yersinia. The toxic potential of several Yersinia
spp. towards M. sexta and G. mellonella demonstrated here for the first time points to insects as a
natural reservoir for yersiniae.

Background
The toxin complex (Tc) proteins whose insecticidal potential resembles that of the Bacillus thuringiensis Bt-toxin
were first purified from Photorhabdus luminescens which
lives in symbiosis with nematodes [1]. They have also
been identified in other insect-parasitizing bacteria such
as Serratia entomophila, Xenorhabdus nematophilus, or Pseudomonas entomophila [2,3]. Homologous insecticidal toxin
genes are present in most genomes of Yersinia strains
sequenced so far, including Y. mollaretii, seven Yersinia pestis strains and three Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. They have
also been found in Y. frederiksenii and in two Y. enterocolitica strains, T83 and W22703, for which a genome
sequence is not yet available [4-6]. However, tc genes are
absent in Y. bercovieri and in Y. enterocolitica strain 8081
[7]. Interestingly, Tc proteins of three Serratia species and
of Y. frederiksenii are plasmid-encoded, indicating that
these sepABC-like genes are part of a horizontally mobile
region [4].
Little is known about the biological role of the tc genes in
Yersinia spp. The genes of the tc operons have been classified into three types according to their homology, namely
tcdA/tcaAB/tccAB (type [A]), tcdB/tcaC (type [B]), and tccC
(type [C]) [8]. Tc proteins have recently been shown to be
secreted in a type III-dependent manner in Y. pestis [9].
Type [A] and [B] Tc proteins are presumably toxins
directed against invertebrate and mammalian gut cells,
and the variability in terms of Tc composition and Tc
sequences may be due to insect- and tissue-specific activity
[8,10]. A role of the Tc proteins from Y. enterooclitica strain
T83, Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 and Y. pestis KIM
in mice gut colonization and in the actin cytoskeleton
rearrangement of human gut cells and mouse fibroblast
cells, respectively, has been reported [5,8,11]. The function of TccC remains unknown, but it has been suggested
that TccC homologs could contribute to stable biofilm
formation in fleas or combatting yet unknown antibacterial effectors in fleas [12], or that they act as universal activator of, or chaperons for, different toxin proteins [13].
Y. enterocolitica was the first member of the Yersinia genus
for which insecticidal activity has been experimentally
demonstrated, and tcaA encoding a subunit of the toxin
complex was identified to be necessary for this activity [6].
The transcription of tcaA in Y. enterocolitica is completely
repressed at 37°C, but strongly induced at lower temperatures with a maximum at approximately 10°C to 15°C.
In contrast to Y. enterocolitica W22703, tcaABC expression
in Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 was observed at
15°C and at 37°C [14]. Upregulation of tcaA and tcaB,
but not tccC, upon temperature shift from 37°C to 26°C
have been shown in two Y. pestis strains [15,16]. The
IP32953 Tc proteins are toxic against M. sexta larvae when
expressed heterologously in E. coli [14]. Temperature-

independent, but weak oral toxicity of several Y. pseudotuberculosis to this tobacco hornworm has been reported. Y.
pseudotuberculosis, unlike Y. pestis, causes acute oral toxicity
to fleas [12]. However, when the tcaAB gene pair from Y.
pseudotuberculosis was heterologously expressed in E. coli,
the lysates did not cause excess mortality in fleas, and a Y.
pseudotuberculosis mutant deleted of the tc genes remained
toxic toward the arthropod [8]. This is in line with the
finding that two Y. enterocolitica strains containing a tcdBtccC gene pair (strain CS080) or lacking any tc-like genes
(strain 8081) were equally toxic to fleas [12].
The insecticidal potential of a variety of Yersinia spp. has
not been tested in an insect infection assay, and the correlation of virulence to the presence or absence of tc operons
in yersiniae is unknown. The phylogenetic relationship of
the insecticidal toxins is not well understood. Here, we
report a genome-based comparison of the tc genes in Y.
enterocolitica strain W22703, the phylogenetic analysis of
tccC genes in Yersinia species, the tc-PAIYe distribution
among six biotypes, and the insecticidal activity of Yersinia
spp. towards two model organisms, the greater wax moth
G. mellonella and the tobacco hornworm M. sexta.

Results
The tc-PAIYe in Yersinia spp
Chromosomal loci encoding Tc proteins have first been
sequenced from P. luminescens, S. entomophila and X.
nematophilus. In the past few years, the genome sequences
of several Yersinia strains became available. Most of them,
namely seven Y. pestis strains, three Y. pseudotuberculosis
strains and Y. mollaretii, carry a common tc gene cluster
termed the tc pathogenicity island of yersiniae (tc-PAIYe).
Further DNA fragments encoding insecticidal toxins were
detected in the genomes of two Y. enterocolitica strains
W22703 and T83 [5,6], and on a plasmid of Y. frederiksenii
strain 49 [4]. A comparison of the chromosomal loci of
yersiniae containing tc homologues is shown in Fig. 1. The
length of the sequences ranges from ~17 kb to ~26 kb.
This variation is mainly due to the presence of one to four
tccC (1-4) homologues. In all cases, tc-PAIsYe are inserted
into an equivalent location with respect to the common
Yersinia genome backbone [8], namely between the genes
encoding a putative DNA-binding transcriptional regulator and a putative DNA gyrase modulator. These genes are
YE3797 (tcaR1) and YE3798 (tldD) with respect to the
chromosomal sequence of Y. enterocolitica strain 8081.
The overall organisation is similar for all strains, including
a second gene, tcaR2 that encodes a homolog of LysR-like
regulators, followed by genes belonging to the homology
types tcaAB/tcdA, tcaC/tcdB, and tccC. tccC is separated
from tcaC/tcdB by two small phage-related genes and two
ORFs of unknown function. According to the classification of Waterfield et al. [8] described above, all tc genes
belong to tcd operons. Beyond these similarities, several

Figure 1 of the tc-PAIYe in Yersiniae
Comparison
Comparison of the tc-PAIYe in Yersiniae. Three homology groups are depicted, namely tcaAB/tcdA, tcaC/tcdB, and tccC.
tcdA/tcdB homologous are present only in Y. enterocolitica strain T83. tcaR1 (left) encoding a regulator and tldD encoding a putative DNA gyrase modulator (right, checkered) mark the island insertion site common for all Yersinia strains that harbour tc
homologues. Identically coloured arrows mark homologous genes. A transposase-like gene (tnp) is present in the genome of Y.
pestis Angola (black arrow). The overall gene organisation is similar for all strains harbouring insecticidal determinants, but differences with respect to gene homology, hypothetical ORFs, the presence of transposase-like elements and the number of tccC
genes are also visible. Gene lengths and intergenic regions are in scale. Asterisks mark frameshifts. With the exception of tcaC,
all frameshifts result in two ORFs. Y. ptb., Y. pseudotuberculosis.
differences were revealed by homology analysis and reannotation. Y. enterocolitica strain W22703 is characterised by a 2034 bp sequence located between tccC and
YE3798 (tldD) harbouring two ORFs of unknown function, one of which is also present in the Y. pestis genomes.
A transposon-related sequence (tnp) was identified in
front of the first phage-related gene of Y. pestis Angola.
Frameshifts (asterisks in Fig. 1) are present in tcaC of
strain W22703, in tcaA of strain Antiqua and of Y. mollaretii, and in tcaB of strains W22703, Orientalis IP275 and
CO92.
Homologues of tccC located outside tc-PAIYe
By screening a Tn5 luxCDABE reporter library of strain
W22703 for genes induced upon low-temperature [17],
we identified a transposon insertion located outside the

tc-PAIYe. A 4,595 bp sequence encompassing the transposon insertion site was derived, revealing two strain-specific ORFs termed tccC2' (1083 bp) and tccC3' (1680 bp)
due to homologies to other Yersinia tccC loci. Obviously,
a frameshift had splitted a tccC homologue into two ORFs.
Exploring the available genome sequences of Yersinia
strains, two additional tccC genes located outside the tcPAIYe were identified in Y. pestis strains Antiqua, CO92,
Nepal516, Orientalis IP275 and 91001, and in Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953, and one further tccC gene in Y. pestis
strains KIM and Angola, and in Y. pseudotuberculosis
IP31758. A truncated tccC2' gene with a 1953 bp deletion
in comparison to tccC2 of strain IP32953 is present in the
genome of Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII. tccC2' and tccC3' of
strain W22703 are located between two genes encoding a
lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl acyltransferase, HtrB

(YE1612), and a putative membrane protein (YE1611) of
strain 8081. In contrast, the non-clustered tccC loci of all
other strains are inserted into two equivalent locations on
the common Yersinia backbone. These locations are exemplified as between the Y. pestis CO92 genes YPO2379/
YPO2381 encoding an N-ethylmaleimide reductase and a
lactoylglutathione lyase, and between YPO2311/
YPO2313 coding for the insertion element IS1541 and a
hypothetical protein. In addition, domain structure of
TccC with similarity to a protein tyrosine phosphatase of
undefined specificity was identified in the sequence of Y.
pestis CO92 TccC2 and, albeit with lower probability, of
W22703.
A total of 39 TccC amino acid sequences, derived from
yersiniae genes either located within or outside the tcPAIYe, was compared here by a ClustlX alignment. The
cladogram of the yersiniae TccC proteins tc-PAIYe exhibits
a significant sequence variability between island- and non
island-encoded TccCs (Fig. 2). The TccC proteins
expressed from loci outside the tc-PAIYe compose two
groups that are characterised by the two common insertion sites as described above. The only exception is
TccC2'/3' of strain W22703 that is more closely related to
the tc-PAIYe-encoded TccC proteins. TccC sequences
derived from genes located within the tc-PAIYe show a
more complex relationship. One group of TccCs represents TccC1 proteins, a second group TccC2 proteins, indicating a highly conserved linear order of tccC1 and tccC2
genes in the yersiniae genomes. Interestingly, TccC1 of Y.
pestis Angola encoded by a tccC gene located nearby a
transposase-like gene (Fig. 1) appears to be more closely
related to TccC2 proteins. Two further sublines that show
a higher sequence variability are represented by TccC2-4
of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP31758, and by TccC1 of Y. mollaretii and Y. enterocolitica strains W22703 and T83.
Presence of tc genes in Y. enterocolitica strains
In a previous study, we had studied a restricted number of
Y. enterocolitica strains by PCR and Southern Blot for the
presence of tcaA, tcaB, and tcaC in representatives of five
biotypes [6]. Here, we performed a more thorough investigation for the presence, absence, variability and genetic
organisation of tc genes in a total of 68 Y. enterocolitica
strains belonging to six biotypes. Chromosomal DNA of
all strains was successfully subjected to PCR with oligonucleotides specific for 16S rDNA as control. A series of 22
PCRs designed to amplify intragenic and gene-overlapping fragments was performed (Fig. 3). DNA of strains
W22703 and 8081 served as a positive and a negative control. First, tcaR1 was confirmed as part of the common
yersiniae genomic backbone. The second regulatory gene,
tcaR2, is present in all strains of biotypes 2–5, but absent
in biotypes 1A and 1B. Two different primer combinations failed to amplify tcaA-specific fragments from DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/214

of several strains. Sequencing of four fragments revealed
mismatches, and conserved tcaA regions were therefore
used to design more appropriate oligonucleotides that
showed the presence of tcaA in biotypes 2–5, but not 1A
and 1B (PCR 46). Similar patterns were obtained following amplification of intragenic tcaB and tcaC fragments
(PCRs 1 and 14), with the exception that tcaC revealed
also to be present in one biotype 1A and one biotype 1B
strain. Using oligonucleotides homologous to the 3'-end
of tcaA and the 5'-end of tcaB, the operon organisation
was confirmed for most, but not all, biotype 2–5 strains
(PCR 10). Negative results in case of PCR 10 predominantly with DNA of biotype 3 strains might be due to a
frameshift in tcaB similar to that in strain W22703, resulting in an unfunctional and possibly degenerated 5'-end of
tcaB. Remnants of the phage-related gene cassette which
are present in all biotype 2–5 strains could also be amplified from DNA of biotype 1A and 1B strains (ORFs
7,8,9,9a and PCRs 15–18). The results of PCRs 18–20
indicate a highly conserved 5'-region and an otherwise
variable tccC sequence. We therefore performed a PCR
with primers specific for tccC of strain T83 and found the
respective fragment also in three biotype 1 strains and in
one biotype 4 strain. To investigate whether tc genes
homologous to that of biotype 1A strain T83 are present
in other Y. enterocolitica strains, PCRs 36 and 37 (data not
shown) with oligonucleotides specific for tcdA of strain
T83 were performed. Fragments of the expected length
were obtained using DNA of four biotype 1A strains, a
finding that correlates well with the negative result of PCR
22 for fragments overlapping the insertion site of the tcPAIYe. Finally, ORF11 is present in all but one biotype 2–
5 strains, but absent in most other Yersinia spp. (Fig. 1).
Taken together, the tc operons of strain W22703 are
present in all biotype 2–5 representatives tested here. A tc
gene cluster homologous to that of strain T83 is probably
present in biotype 1A strains 1968, 2602 and 4268. In
comparison to all other tc genes, tccC exhibits a higher
sequence variability (see chapter above).
Oral infection of M. sexta
Some Yersinia spp. besides the three human pathogenic
species have not yet been investigated for their insecticidal
activity. Oral infection of first-instar M. sexta neonates was
performed by soaking small blocks of an artificial diet
with 50 μl aliquots of overnight cultures grown at 15°C
(Yersinia spp.) and 37°C (DH5α). Yersinia strains applied
were Y. mollaretii, Y. aldovae, Y. ruckeri, and four Y. enterocolitica strains (W22703, W22703-tcaA::Tn5lux, 2594,
4466). Their toxicity towards M. sexta as percentage of
dead larvae five days after infection is shown in Table 1.
The experimental setting hampered the reproducibility of
the assay, resulting in larger standard deviations in comparison to the G. mellonella infection model (see below).
The strains Y. enterocolitica 2594 and Y. mollaretii possess-

ing the tc-PAIYe showed the highest killing rates. Strains
without tc genes such as Y. ruckeri and Y. aldovae were less
toxic towards M. sexta. The only exception was the tc-negative Y. enterocolitica strain 4466 with a lethality rate of
42%, suggesting the presence of further gut-active insecticidal determinants in its genome. The toxicity of strain
W22703 (30% dead larvae) in comparison to that of the
tcaA knockout mutant W22703-tcaA::Tn5lux (10%) confirms our recent experiments using concentrated protein
extracts instead of viable cells. Taken together, the average
killing rates of Table 1 show that the tc genes play an
important role in the insecticidal activity of Yersinia spp.
upon oral uptake.
Subcutaneous infection of G. mellonella
For an additional bioassay, we chose the model organism
G. mellonella that is also used to determine the toxicity of

P. luminescens and X. nematophilus. We infected larvae of
this greater wax moth subcutaneously with 1:10 and
1:100 diluted aliquots of Y. mollaretii, Y. kristensenii, Y. bercovieri, Y. aldovae, Y. ruckeri, and four Y. enterocolitica
strains (W22703, W22703-tcaA::Tn5lux, 2594, 4466)
incubated at 15°C until they reached stationary phase.
After five days, only 10% of the larvae had survived an
infection of strains 2594 or 4466. In total, four strains
showed high killing rates of 81–90% (Table 2). To determine whether the toxicity towards the insect larvae
depends on the presence of Tc proteins, we analysed chromosomal DNA of Y. ruckeri, Y. aldovae, Y. kristensenii, and
Y. enterocolitica strain 4466 with primers described in
Additional file 1 and shown in Fig. 3. No fragments were
obtained with primers specific to tcaR2 (PCR 6), tcaA
(PCR 46), tcaB (PCR 1), tcaB-tcaC (PCR 13), tcaC (PCR
14), ORF11-YE3798 (PCR 34), and tccC of Y. enterocolitica

Distribution of the tc-PAIYe in Y. enterocolitica strains
Distribution of the tc-PAIYe in Y. enterocolitica strains. Strains investigated are described in Table 3. The lines below the
tc-PAIYe are in scale and mark the fragments amplified by PCR. The PCR numbers correspond to those indicated in Additional

strain T83 (PCR 38). As a control, amplification of a tcaR1
fragment which is part of the common Yersinia backbone
sequence (PCR 39) succeeded with DNA of Y. aldovae and
Y. enterocolitica strain 4466. Therefore, we conclude that
the tc-PAIYe is absent in these strains (Table 2). Thus, only
two of the strains exhibiting a killing rate of at least 81%,
namely Y. mollaretii, and the biotype 2 strain 2594, harbour the tc-PAIYe, while it is absent in Y. enterocolitica
strain 4466 and Y. bercovieri. On the other hand, Y. ruckeri
and Y. aldovae killed G. mellonella larvae in approximately
40–50% of all infection experiments, and the insecticidal
activity of Y. kristensenii is only slightly higher than that of
the control strain S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. These
three strains do not carry tc genes, too. No significant difference (p = 0.21) in the insecticidal activity between
W22703 and its tcaA knockout mutant could be observed.

Plasmid-encoded sep-like genes of Y. frederiksenii isolate
49 could also not be detected using primers specific for
tcYF1, tcYF2 or tcYF3 [see Additional file 1] in bacterial
lysates of Y. enterocolitica strain 4466, Y. ruckeri, Y. aldovae,
or Y. kristensenii. According to BLAST analysis, homologous of type III secretion system (T3SS) genes are present
in the genomes of W22703 and the other strains from
Table 2 sequenced so far, but the role of T3SS and insect
virulence as shown for Y. pestis remains to be determined
for these strains. Taken together, this data strongly suggests that insecticidal activity of Yersinia spp. towards G.
mellonella upon subcutaneous infection is not caused by
Tc proteins, and that yet unknown determinants contribute to the insecticidal activity of Yersinia strains towards
the insect larvae. The similar lethality of strain W22703
and its tcaA-negative mutant not only confirms the

assumption of Tc-independent killing, but also of a gutrelated TcaA activity following oral infection as demonstrated above and recently suggested [6,8,10].

Discussion
Two basic methods have been used here to determine the
insecticidal potential of Yersinia spp., namely the oral
application of viable cells and the subcutaneous injection
of protein extracts or living bacterial cells. Upon oral
application of W22703 and W22703-tcaA::Tn5lux protein
extract to M. sexta larvae, we could recently demonstrate
the role of TcaA in Y. enterocolitica toxicity towards insects
[6]. Further five Yersinia strains were tested here for the
first time with respect to their oral toxicity in the M. sexta
model (Table 1). The presence of the tc-PAIYe correlates
with a higher toxicity of yersiniae towards larvae of the

tobacco hornworm, while strains such as Y. ruckeri or Y.
aldovae lacking the tc genes are less insecticidal in this
assay. The variable insecticidal activity of strains with tc
genes might be the result of sequence variations, or the
presence of further insecticidal components. Due to a
higher toxin concentration, the feeding of protein extracts
led to higher lethality rates using strain W22703 [8]. In
contrast, subcutaneous infection of G. mellonella does not
result in a significantly different toxicity of these strains
(Table 2). In comparison to P. luminescens that causes
death of G. mellonella larvae within 24 hours following
injection of several thousand cells [18], approximately 5 ×
105 Y. enterocolitica strain W22730 cells are required to kill
G. mellonella within five days. The most surprising result
of the injection study performed here was the high variability of the insecticidal potential among Yersinia strains

that is probably caused by tc-independent determinants.
Examples for factors required for full virulence towards
insect larvae are the hemolysin XhlA of X. nematophila or
the gene mcf of P. luminescens. [13,19]. In Y. enterocolitica,
XaxAB, an apoptotic AB toxin, and the putative macrophage toxin MT have been identified as candidates with
potential insecticidal activity, but their biological role still
remains to be uncovered [20]. The overall results of the
Galleria bioassay correlate with the finding that among
147 Yersinia isolates from the environment, 15.6% were Y.
enterocolitica, but only 0.7% belonged to Y. kristensenii
[21].
Although the biological role of Tc proteins has still to be
experimentally defined, sequence analysis already
revealed several interesting aspects. Regions of significant
sequence similarities have been identified in all TcdA-like
elements characterized so far [14]. Especially, TcaC is well
conserved within the Yersinia genus, but TcaB and TcaA
show significant sequence variability [8]. When the TccC
sequences derived from the tc-PAIYe of yersiniae were
aligned, a high degree of sequence conservation was
obtained at amino acids 1–680, followed by a remarkably
high sequence diversity [14] as is confirmed by the TccC
cladogram (Fig. 2). Some Tc sequences show evidence of
undergoing degradation with frameshifts that often result
in the splitting of tc genes into two separate ORFs (Fig. 1).
Frameshifts in Y. pestis, especially in tcaB of CO92, are discussed as a critical step in the recent evolution of fleaborne transmission in the genus Yersinia due to the loss of
one or more of those insect gut toxins [12,14]. This data
indicates that the tc genes of yersiniae may be under diversifying selection [8] which might result in insecticidal proteins with host-specific activity and with varying
insecticidal potential.
It has been suggested that the genomes of different strains
have taken up different tc genes after strain separation
[22]. However, the data presented here point to a common Yersinia ancestor that has aquired the tc-PAIYe. The
plasmid-encoded Tc proteins in Y. frederiksenii and a
transposon-like element downstream of Y. pestis Angola
tcaC hint to putative mechanisms that might have played
a role during horizontal transfer of insecticidal toxin
genes (Fig. 1). This hypothesis is strongly supported by
the common insertion site of the tc-PAIYe that indicates
one horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event, by the highly
conserved phage-related genes within the tc-PAIYe, and by
a similar gene order including tccC1 and tccC2 in all
islands investigated. Moreover, the cladogram derived
from a comprehensive alignment of TccC protein
sequences (Fig. 2) essentially reflects the phylogeny of
Yersinia based on 16S rDNA sequences, including the
clonal diversity among Y. enterocolitica strains [23]. As an
additional insecticidal determinant, tccC genes located

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/214

outside the tc-PAIYe might have been acquired by a further
HGT event following the separation of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica, because all available genomes of
the Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis subline share two tccC
insertion sites. Thus, reductive evolution by genetic drift
might explain the lack of tc-PAIYe in several Yersinia species
and strains (Table 2) as examplified by the identification
of rudimentary tc genes in biotypes 1A and 1B (Fig. 3).

Conclusion
The prevalence of the tc-PAIYe in many genomes, its
proven functionality in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, as well as the common insecticidal potential of
Yersinia spp. towards M. sexta and G. mellonella, hints to
insects as yet unknown host organisms of yersiniae. This
is in line with the hypothesis that environmental predators such as nematodes or insect larvae play a role in the
evolution of pathogens [22,24]. The tc-PAIYe has probably
been acquired by an ancestral Yersinia strain before the
separation of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica, and others. This ancestor strain could then have
evolved the ability to exploit invertebrates by the acquisition of further genetic determinants required for the interaction of yersiniae with those hosts [20]. Distinct
sequence variation, and reductive evolution especially
within the genomes of Y. pestis serovars, might have
allowed yersiniae to occupy specific ecological niches
[22]. The role of the tc genes and other insecticidal determinants in proliferation and transmission of the three
human pathogenic Yersinia species remains to be elucidated in more detail.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Y. enterocolitica strains used in this study are listed in Table
3. Y. mollaretii (CIP 103324), Y. ruckeri (CIP 82.80), Y. bercovieri (CIP 103323), Y. aldovae (CIP 103162) and Y. kristensenii (CIP 80.30) were obtained from the Collection
Institute Pasteur (Paris, France). Strain W22703tcaA::Tn5lux is a tcaA knockout mutant [6].Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium is the ATCC strain 14028.
All cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (10 g
l-1 tryptone, 5 g l-1 yeast extract, and 5 g l-1 NaCl) or on LB
agar (LB broth supplemented with 1.5% w/v agar). E. coli
was grown at 37°C and Yersinia strains at 15°C or 30°C.
If appropriate, the media were supplemented with the following antibiotics: 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin and 20 μg ml-1
nalidixic acid.
General molecular techniques
DNA and RNA manipulation was performed according to
standard procedures [25]. To isolate chromosomal DNA,
1.5 ml of a bacterial culture was centrifuged, and the sediment was resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl). After incuba-

tion for 15 min on ice, 10 μl of 10% SDS and 5 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added, and the sample was

then precipitated with 500 μl of isopropanol, washed in
ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 500 μl of TE buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM Na2 EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1 μl
of RNase (10 mg/ml). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR)
were carried out with Taq polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius,

95°C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, at the appropriate annealing temperature for 30 sec, at 72°C for 45 sec
to 180 sec depending on the expected fragment length;
one cycle at 72°C for 10 min. All primers used are listed

numbers AM286415 and AM286416). Sequence assembly was done with Vector NTI Advance™ (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, USA). The resulting sequence was annotated
using
the
NCBI
ORF-Finder
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html.
Homology
searches of predicted proteins were performed by BLAST
analysis http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. Genome
sequences of Yersinia strains were obtained from the NCBI
database and compared using the homepage http://
www.microbesonline.org/. Protein sequence alignment
was done with the ClustalW program [27], and cladogram
was constructed with TREECON [28]. Promoter
sequences located upstream of the identified genes were
deduced with BPROM http://www.softberry.com/. The
accession number of the W22703 tccC2' and tccC3'
sequence is AM941739.

Inverse PCR and DNA sequencing
Identification of the transposon insertion site in mutant
W22703-tccC(405)::Tn5lux was performed as described
previously [17]. Briefly, 400 ng chromosomal DNA of the
transposon mutant was completely digested with ClaI,
HindIII or SspI (Fermentas), enzymes were heat-inactivated, and fragments were treated with T4 DNA ligase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) to allow self-ligation resulting in circular molecules. Inverse PCR [26] was then performed using transposon-specific primers [17], and the
resulting fragments were sequenced with primers hybridizing to transposon regions near the O-end and the I-end.
Sequencing of the strain-specific DNA was performed following inverse PCR using the restriction enzymes HaeIII
(USB, Cleveland, USA), HhaI, HindIII, HpaI, MspI, MunI,
RsaI, SspI and VspI (Fermentas), and primers derived from
the sequence already obtained. Sequencing was done by 4
base lab (Reutlingen, Germany) and by MWG-Biotech
(Ebersberg, Germany).

Bioassays
M. sexta were reared as described recently [29]. For oral
bioassays, bacteria were grown at 15°C (Yersinia strains)
or 37°C (DH5α) until stationary phase. 50 μl of a culture
was applied to 4-mm3 disks of an agar-based artificial diet
[30]. The liquid was allowed to soak into the agar block
which was then dried under a laminar flow. First-instar M.
sexta neonate larvae were then placed on the disk and
incubated at 22°C. The application of bacterial culture
aliquots was repeated after three days, and the larvae mortality was recorded after 5 days.

Bioinformatics
Mapping of the mini-Tn5 luxCDABE insertion was performed using the Y. enterocolitica Blast Server from the
Sanger Institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/
submitblast/y_enterocolitica. The reference genome
sequence was that of Y. enterocolitica 8081 (accession

Larvae of the greater wax moth, G. mellonella, were

and DH5α) and then diluted 1:10 and 1:100. 5–7.5 μl of
each dilution corresponding to approximately 5–7.5 ×
105 and 5–7.5 × 104 viable cells were subcutaneously
injected into larvae of 2–3 cm length and of 90–140 mg
weight using a sterilized micro syringe (Hamilton 1702
RN, 25 μl). Infected larvae were then incubated for five
days at 15°C, and the numbers of killed and living larvae
were enumerated.
