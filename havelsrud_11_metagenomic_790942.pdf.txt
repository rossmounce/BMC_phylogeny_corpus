Abstract
Background: Methane oxidizing prokaryotes in marine sediments are believed to function as a methane filter
reducing the oceanic contribution to the global methane emission. In the anoxic parts of the sediments, oxidation
of methane is accomplished by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) living in syntrophy with sulphate
reducing bacteria. This anaerobic oxidation of methane is assumed to be a coupling of reversed methanogenesis
and dissimilatory sulphate reduction. Where oxygen is available aerobic methanotrophs take part in methane
oxidation. In this study, we used metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and metabolic potential for
methane oxidation at the Tonya seep in the Coal Oil Point area, California. Two metagenomes from different
sediment depth horizons (0-4 cm and 10-15 cm below sea floor) were sequenced by 454 technology. The
metagenomes were analysed to characterize the distribution of aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophic taxa at the
two sediment depths. To gain insight into the metabolic potential the metagenomes were searched for marker
genes associated with methane oxidation.
Results: Blast searches followed by taxonomic binning in MEGAN revealed aerobic methanotrophs of the genus
Methylococcus to be overrepresented in the 0-4 cm metagenome compared to the 10-15 cm metagenome. In the
10-15 cm metagenome, ANME of the ANME-1 clade, were identified as the most abundant methanotrophic taxon
with 8.6% of the reads. Searches for particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and methyl-coenzyme M
reductase (mcrA), marker genes for aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane respectively, identified pmoA in
the 0-4 cm metagenome as Methylococcaceae related. The mcrA reads from the 10-15 cm horizon were all
classified as originating from the ANME-1 clade.
Conclusions: Most of the taxa detected were present in both metagenomes and differences in community
structure and corresponding metabolic potential between the two samples were mainly due to abundance
differences.
The results suggests that the Tonya Seep sediment is a robust methane filter, where taxa presently dominating this
process could be replaced by less abundant methanotrophic taxa in case of changed environmental conditions.

Background
The Coal Oil Point seep area (COP), located in the
Santa Barbara Channel, California, is one of the most
active seep areas in the world [1]. Seepage of the greenhouse gas methane and other hydrocarbons has
occurred in this area for over 500 000 years [2]. The
methane emitted from the COP is mainly of

thermogenic origin and the daily emission has been estimated to be at least 40 metric tons [1,3].
At a global scale, the oceans only make up about 2%
of the global methane emission budget [4]. This low
level is explained by prokaryotic oxidation of methane
in marine sediments and bedrocks before it reaches the
water column [5].
The oxygen penetration level in marine sediments is
shallow, so most of the methane oxidation takes place at
anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic oxidation of methane
(AOM) is assumed to be a coupling of reversed methanogenesis and sulphate reduction. This process is likely

performed by the yet uncultured anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) in syntrophy with sulphate
reducing bacteria (SRB). Based on phylogeny, ANME
can be divided into three clades: ANME-1, ANME-2
and ANME-3 [6-9]. ANME-2 and ANME-3 are affiliated
to the Methanosarcinales, while ANME-1 is only distantly related to the Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales [7-9]. Both ANME-1 and ANME-2 are
associated with sulphur reducing deltaproteobacteria of
the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus-branch [7,9,10].
ANME-3 is mainly associated with SRB strains closely
related to Desulfobulbus [6].
The reversed methanogenesis model for AOM has
gained support by a metagenomic study on ANME at
Eel River [11] and sequencing of an ANME-1 draft genome [12]. In these studies sequence homologues of all
enzymes needed for CO 2 -based methanogenesis with
exception of N5, N10-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer) were identified. Methyl-coenzyme
M reductase (mcrA) is assumed to catalyze the first step
of AOM and the last step of methanogenesis, and is
therefore a marker gene for both processes. Similarly,
dissimilatory sulphite reductase (dsrAB) is often used as
a marker gene for SRB [13].
When oxygen is present, aerobic methanotrophs are
active in methane oxidation. Known aerobic methanotrophs include representatives of Gammaproteobacteria,
Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia [14-18].
These organisms convert methane to methanol using
the enzyme methane monooxygenase [17]. The particulate, membrane bound version of methane monooxygenase (pmoA), found in all aerobic methanotrophs (with
exception of Methanocella), is used as a marker gene for
aerobic oxidation of methane [19]. The methanol
formed is converted to formaldehyde, which is assimilated by one of two known pathways. Type I and type II
methanotrophs utilize the ribulose monophosphate
pathway and the serine pathway respectively. Type ×
methanotrophs use primarily the ribulose monophosphate pathway, but possess the enzymes needed for the
serine pathway as well [20].
Stable isotope probing and sequencing of 16S rDNA
and pmoA, as well as lipid biomarker analysis, have
detected type-I aerobic methanotrophs in sediments and
biofilms at the COP Shane and Brian seeps [21,22].
Recently, measurements of average δ13C of carbonates
and lipid biomarkers associated with ANME and SRB
also indicated occurrence of AOM at the Brian seep
[23]. Another survey at the Brian seep detected ANME2 at 6-9 cm bsf (below sea floor) by FISH (Fluorescent
in situ hybridization) [24].
In the present study, we have used metagenomics to
characterize the taxonomic and metabolic potential for
both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation in two

sediment samples from different depths at the Tonya
seep (COP). By avoiding PCR amplification and primer
target specificity, the metagenomics approach offered
further insight into the taxonomy and metabolic potential of the prokaryotic communities of the methane seep
sediments.

Results
Gas measurements and methane oxidation rate

The average methane oxidation rate based on 11 measurements in the top 15 cm of the seep sediments was
156 ± 64 nmol cm-3 day-1 . Still, the gas emitted from
the Tonya seep sediments into the water phase contained a large fraction of methane. Even after travelling
25 m through the water column, where dissolved O 2
and N2 entered the bubbles, the two gas samples contained 80.4% (gas sample I) and 68.1% (gas sample II)
methane. When O 2 and N 2 were excluded, and the
hydrocarbon and CO 2 content were normalized,
methane accounted for 93.6% in both gas samples. The
remainder consisted of CO2 and short chain hydrocarbons (C2, C3, i-C4 and n-C4).
Metagenome creation through filtering of reads

454 sequencing resulted in 395540 reads for the 0-4 cm
sample and 282964 reads for the 10-15 cm sample.
Replicate filtering of the metagenomes removed 33.03%
of the reads from the 0-4 cm sample and 31.31% of the
reads in the 10-15 cm sample. The resulting metagenomes consisted of 264902 reads (average length 413 ±
138 bases, range 29-1907 bases) for the 0-4 cm sample
and 194360 reads (average length of 419 ± 134 bases,
range 29-1458 bases) for the 10-15 cm sample. All
further analyses were performed on these metagenomes
(Figure 1). Unless other ways specified, all percentages
throughout the text are given as percent of total reads
for each filtered metagenome.
Estimated effective genome sizes (EGS) were 4.8 Mbp
and 4.0 Mbp for the 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm sample
respectively (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Rarefaction analysis

Rarefaction analysis at the most resolved level of the
NCBI taxonomy in MEGAN showed the taxonomic
richness detected in the sediment samples (Figure 2).
Including all assigned taxa, 1034 and 882 leaves were
detected in the 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm metagenome
respectively. Of these, 785 (0-4 cm) and 596 (10-15 cm)
were bacterial and 58 (0-4 cm) and 127 (10-15 cm)
archaeal. The rarefaction curves for bacterial and total
taxa indicated that not all the taxonomic richness in the
sediment was accounted for in our metagenomes. Still,
the curves were levelling off from a straight line already
at 10% of the metagenome size indicating repeated

sampling of the same taxon. It is therefore likely that
abundant taxa in the sediments were accounted for in
the two metagenomes.
While most of the archaeal taxa in the 10-15 cm
metagenome were accounted for, the number of taxa in
the 0-4 cm was still increasing at 100% sampling. This
difference is likely due to the low abundance of Archaea
in the 0-4 cm metagenome (0.97% of reads) compared
to the 10-15 cm metagenome (18.09% of reads) as
shown in Figure 3.
Taxonomic binning

There was a significant difference in the proportion of
reads assigned to Bacteria and Archaea for the two
metagenomes (Figure 3). In the 0-4 cm metagenome
60.87% of the reads were assigned to Bacteria and 0.97%
to Archaea, while in the 10-15 cm metagenome 47.14%
of the reads were assigned to Bacteria and as much as

18.09% to Archaea. This shift in the prokaryotic community structure suggests that Archaea thrive better and
thereby also are likely to contribute more to the metabolism in the 10-15 cm sediment horizon.
Xipe analyses of the binned reads (confidence cut-off
of 0.95, 0.98 and 0.99) at the phylum level (Table 1) and
at the genus level (Additional file 2, Tables S2 and
Additional file 3, Table S3) showed a significant difference between the two metagenomes as to the most
abundant taxa [25]. The high abundance of Archaea in
the 10-15 cm metagenome compared to the 0-4 cm
metagenome was striking at the phylum level as well
(Table 1). In the 10-15 cm metagenome, reads assigned
to Proteobacteria and to “Archaeal environmental samples” were almost equally abundant, representing 15.45%
and 13.03% of the reads respectively. In contrast,
“Archaeal environmental samples” represented only
0.15% of the 0-4 cm metagenome, where reads assigned

to Proteobacteria representing 31.07% were clearly most
abundant (Table 1). Euryarchaeota was also significantly
better represented in the 10-15 cm metagenome.
Among the Proteobacteria, Sulfurovum was the most
abundant genus in the 0-4 cm metagenome (Additional
file 2, Table S2). This sulphur oxidizing genus, with its
versatile energy metabolism, is known to thrive in sediments related to hydrothermal seepage where reductive
and oxidative states in the mixing zone often fluctuate
[26]. Sulfurovum was almost four times more abundant
in the 0-4 cm metagenome compared to the 10-15 cm
metagenome. This is consistent with oxidative zones
being its preferred habitat [26].

The methane oxidation measurements in the sediment
cores indicated methanotrophic activity at both sediment depths. The metagenomes were searched for reads
assigned to known methanotrophic genera that might be
involved in methane oxidation. Methylococcus was the
predominant aerobic methanotrophic genus in both
metagenomes, but was significantly more abundant in
the 0-4 cm metagenome where it accounted for 0.16%

the aerobe methanotrophs Methylomonas, Methylocella
and Methylacidiphilum were also detected, Methylococcus was approximately 10 and 2.5 times more abundant
than these genera combined in the 0-4 cm and 10-15
cm metagenome respectively.

Aerobe methanotrophs

ANME groups were the predominant anaerobic
methanotrophs in the sediments. Since taxonomic classification of reads in MEGAN was based on the NCBI
taxonomy, the ANME clades were not recognized as
independent taxa. The artificial taxon “Archaeal environmental samples” was however represented (Additional
file 3, Table S3). Inspection of the reads assigned to this
taxon revealed their assignment to ANME-1 and

ANME-2 fosmids isolated from Eel River [11] or to
“uncultured archaeon”. Further inspection of the best
hits for the reads assigned to “uncultured archaeon”
(mean bit score 146.8) showed that most of these reads
were associated to ANME as well, while a few reads
were assigned to fosmids isolated from methane seeps
offshore Japan [12,27-29] (Table 2).
The ANME-1 clade was by far the anaerobic methanotroph with most assigned reads, although ANME-2
and ANME-3 also were present in the 10-15 cm metagenome (Figure 4). ANME-1 and ANME-2 were
detected with low abundance in the 0-4 cm metagenome. The high abundance of ANME in the 10-15 cm
metagenome indicates that AOM caused the high
methane oxidation rates measured at this depth.
ANME are assumed to live in syntrophy with SRB.
The most abundant genera of SRB in the metagenomes
from the Tonya seep were Desulfococcus, Desulfobacterium and Desulfatibacillum (Figure 4). These genera
were abundant in both metagenomes, and Desulfococcus,
a common partner of ANME [7,9,10], especially so in
the 10-15 cm metagenome (Additional file 2, Table S2).
Reads assigned to the bacterial NC10 group were present in both metagenomes (Figure 4). It has been proposed that Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera of the
NC10 group can oxidize methane anaerobically without
an archaeal partner [30,31]. A pathway of “intra-aerobic”
methane oxidation where an intracellular supply of oxygen is produced by metabolism of nitrite to oxygen and
dinitrogen has been suggested. This intracellularly produced oxygen is then used for the oxidation of methane
via pmoA [32]. Reads assigned to NC10 were significantly overrepresented (99% confidence interval) in the
10-15 cm metagenome compared to the 0-4 cm metagenome. Still, there was far less reads (approximately
1:100) assigned to NC10 than to ANME-1 in the 10-15
cm metagenome.

Methane oxidation pathways

To gain insight into the metabolic pathways for methane
oxidation at the Tonya Seep, we annotated the reads
from each metagenome to KO and EC numbers and
plotted them onto KEGG pathway maps. In this way,
the methane monooxygenase gene (EC: 1.14.13.25) was
identified in the 0-4 cm sample, supporting the idea of
aerobic methane oxidation in this sediment horizon.
This gene was not detected in the 10-15 cm
metagenome.
All the genes needed for AOM/methanogenesis,
including mcrA (EC: 2.8.4.1), were detected in the 10-15
cm metagenome (Figure 5). In the 0-4 cm metagenome,
the genes for methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (mtd, EC: 1.5.99.9) and methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase (mch, EC: 3.5.4.27) were
not detected. This is likely due to the low abundance of
reads assigned to Euryarchaeota and “Archaeal environmental samples”, and thereby low coverage of genes
encoded by these taxa, in the 0-4 cm metagenome. In
total, 1757 reads were assigned to these taxa in the 0-4
cm metagenome. With an average sequence length of
413 bases this gives a total of 0.7 M bases, while the
average ANME-1 genome size is estimated to be 3.3-3.6
Mbp (Table 1) [12].
Anaerobic oxidation of methane is usually associated
with dissimilatory sulphate reduction, where adenylylsulphate reductase (EC: 1.8.99.2) first reduces sulphate
to sulphite before dissimilatory sulphite reductase (EC:
1.8.99.3) reduces sulphite to sulphide [13]. These genes
were detected in both metagenomes.
Marker genes

To obtain a more precise picture of taxa actually capable of methane oxidation in our sediment, the metagenomes were compared with libraries of marker genes
for methane oxidation. Estimated probabilities for

identifying the specific marker genes were used to calculate expected hits to marker genes in a scenario where
all organisms in the communities contained the gene in
question (Additional file 1, Table S1). Based on these
expected numbers, and the number of marker genes
actually detected, we estimated the fraction of the community containing the gene. Eight reads in total
matched pmoA, the marker gene for aerobic methane
oxidation (Figure 6). In MEGAN, one of these was
assigned to the genus Methylococcus of the family
Methylococcaceae while six reads were assigned to
unclassified Methylococcaceae. This point towards
Methylococcaceae as the most important family of aerobic methane oxidizers at the Tonya seep sediments, as
was also indicated by taxonomic abundance. Seven out
of eight reads assigned to pmoA were from the 0-4 cm
sample, supporting that aerobic methane oxidation is
conducted in the shallower layer of the sediment. The
estimated fraction of the community coding for pmoA,
based on marker gene detection, was calculated to

12.9% and 1.5% in the 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm respectively
(Additional file 1, Table S1).
The marker gene for AOM, mcrA, is also a key gene
in methanogenesis, where it catalyzes the last step. The
0-4 cm sample contained only one mcrA read, assigned
to the methanogenic genus Methanosarcina (Figure 6).
In the 10-15 cm sample 28 reads matching mcrA were
found, all assigned to ANME-1. Based on EGS and
expected number of reads matching mcrA, the estimated
fraction of the community in the 10-15 cm sample made
up of ANME-1 was 77.4% (Additional file 1, Table S1).
In order to detect possible SRB partners of ANME, we
compared the two metagenomes to a dsrAB library. Of
60 hits, 33 were assigned to the reversed form of dsrAB
found in sulphur compound-oxidizing bacteria. Sixteen
and eleven dsrAB reads from the possible SRB partners
of ANME were detected in the 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm
metagenomes respectively, estimations based on the
probability of detecting this gene thereby indicate that
43.2% and 24.6% of the 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm

Number of reads

Figure 6 Taxonomic distribution of marker genes for methane oxidation. Shown is the number of reads matching marker genes associated
with oxidation of methane and the taxonomic distribution of these reads in each metagenome. Reads matching the marker genes for anaerobic
oxidation of methane (mcrA), aerobic oxidation of methane (pmoA) and sulphate reduction (dsrAB) are presented in the left, middle and right
section respectively. The 0-4 cm metagenome is presented in red and the 10-15 cm metagenome in blue.

community were made up by SRB respectively (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Most SRB dsrAB reads were assigned to “bacterial
environmental samples” and the deltaproteobacterial
genera Desulfotaela, Desulfobacula, Desulfobacterium,
Desulfobacter, Desulfatibacillum and Bilophila (Figure
6). The reads assigned to “bacterial environmental samples” matched clones from a diverse range of sediments
[33-41] and one clone from an acidic fan soil sample
[42]. Eight of the reads assigned to “bacterial environmental samples” (six from the 0-4 cm metagenome and
two from the 10-15 cm metagenome) were most similar
to dsrAB sequences from Deltaproteobacteria [33-39]
(results not shown). None of the dsrAB reads were
assigned to Desulfosarcina or Desulfococcus, the previously described syntrophic partners of ANME-1
[7,9,10].

Discussion
Methane oxidation rate

Methane oxidation rates in our sediment cores were 156
± 64 nmol cm -3 day -1 . This is much higher than the
methane oxidation rates at the nearby Brian seep (6-87
nmol cm-3 day-1) [24] and within the range of AOM at
seeps with surface hydrates, mud volcanoes and gas
chimneys ([13] and refs therein). It has been suggested
that the relatively low methane oxidation rate at the
Brian seep could be caused by the permeable, sandy
sediments leading to low amounts of dissolved methane

in the pore water [24]. Conversely, the higher methane
oxidation rate at the Tonya seep could be due to the
less permeable, relatively oily tar containing sediments
at this seep.
Taxonomic richness and coverage

Taxonomic classification was based on a blastX query
against the NCBI non-redundant Protein Database
(ncbiP-nr). It has previously been shown that the prokaryotic representation in public sequence databases,
such as the ncbiP-nr, is heavily biased towards taxa that
are easily cultivable or of anthropogenic interest [43,44].
Many of the taxa represented are further only partially
sequenced [44]. These issues may lead to false assignment of reads, especially if only the top hit is considered. By employing the LCA algorithm of MEGAN,
most of these wrong assignments are avoided at the cost
of more reads being assigned to taxa of low specificity
or not being assigned at all [45,46]. Short reads may
also be a source of ambiguous taxonomic classification,
especially if they are from a highly conserved region of
the genome or from a region susceptible to horizontal
gene transfer [44,45,47]. We therefore calculated the
average read length for reads assigned to different taxonomic levels in MEGAN to see if it decreased with
decreasing taxonomic specificity (Additional file 4, Table
S4). This was not the case as average lengths of reads
assigned to all taxonomic levels in MEGAN (including
“not assigned”) were in the same range (approximately

Håvelsrud et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/221

450 bases). Read with no hits against the ncbiP-nr were
however considerably shorter (average read lengths of
263 ± 181 and 232 ± 175 bases in 0-4 cm and 10-15 cm
metagenome respectively).
Rarefaction analyses indicated that the most abundant
taxa of the Tonya Seep sediments were accounted for in
our metagenomes. The taxonomic richness of prokaryotes, in combination with high EGS, does however lead
to low coverage of most genomes represented in the
metagenomes. Absence of a single marker gene assigned
to a specific taxon might therefore be due to chance.
Still, we detected more marker genes than expected
based on the taxonomic binning of reads. This could be
due to an overestimation of the EGS. It has previously
been discussed that a bit score threshold of 60 (as used
in this work according to the method developed by Raes
et al. [48]) might discriminate against short reads, and
that lowering of the threshold would result in decreased
EGS [49]. A decreased EGS would in turn result in a
reduction of the estimated fraction of the community
carrying the marker genes mcrA, pmoA and dsrAB. Differences in copy number for organisms carrying the
gene might also affect the expected number of hits.
Aerobic methane oxidation

Due to limited oxygen penetration, active aerobic
methane oxidation is probably limited to a thin surface
layer. The maximum oxygen penetration at the nearby
Brian seep sediments was measured to a depth of 1.4
cm [24]. Due to high tar content, oxygen penetration in
the sediments of the Tonya seep is expected to be more
restricted than at the Brian seep.
Methane monooxygenase (EC: 1.14.13.25) was only
detected in the 0-4 cm metagenome after plotting of
KO and EC numbers onto KEGG pathway maps. Overrepresentation of aerobic methanotrophic genera and
pmoA (based on library comparison) in the 0-4 cm
metagenome compared to the 10-15 cm metagenome
further support aerobic oxidation of methane in the 0-4
cm sediment sample (see Figures 4 and 6).
Both taxonomic binning of reads and marker gene
classification point to type I methanotrophs of Methylococcaceae as the most important aerobic methane oxidizers in our samples. While Methylococcus was the
aerobic methanotrophic genus with most reads assigned
(see Figure 4), most of the detected pmoA reads were
assigned to unclassified Methylococcaceae (see Figure 6).
This indicates that uncultured type I methanotrophs
might play an important role in aerobic methane oxidation at the Tonya Seep. Also in microbial mats and sediments of the nearby Shane and Brian seeps aerobic type
I methanotrophs have been identified, while no type II
methanotrophs were detected at either of these sites
[21,22]. This is consistent with type I methanotrophs

Page 9 of 14

dominating over type II methanotrophs in most marine
settings ([50]and refs therein).
Anaerobic methane oxidation

Genes for AOM were detected in both metagenomes
(see Figure 5). The taxonomic binning of reads points to
AMNE-1 as the predominant anaerobic oxidizer of
methane in the Tonya seep sediment, especially in the
10-15 cm sediment sample. It is however, important to
notice that ANME-1, due to the genome sequencing
efforts [12], is the most sequenced ANME-clade, and
therefore overrepresented in the database. This could
skew our relative abundance results. However, the presence and dominance of ANME-1 was further supported
by the mcrA reads in our metagenomes (see Figure 6).
This gene is identified in all ANME-clades, still all reads
matching mcrA in the 10-15 cm metagenome were
assigned to ANME-1. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence of ANME-1 being the most important clade for anaerobic methane oxidation in the Tonya
seep sediments. In contrast, only ANME-2 was detected
at the nearby Brian Seep [24]. ANME-1 and ANME-2
are known to co-occur in sediments, usually with one
type more abundant than the other [7,51,52]. The environmental conditions that might regulate the relative
abundance of the different ANME clades in marine sediments are still not known [7,51]. Differences in permeability of the sediments at the Tonya and Brian seeps
could be one factor selecting for different ANME clades
at the two sites.
Sulphate reducing bacteria

Anaerobic oxidation of methane is assumed to be
coupled to dissimilatory reduction of sulphate. Both
metagenomes had reads assigned to SRB genera, predominantly Desulfococcus, Desulfobacterium and Desulfatibacillum (see Figure 4). The ratio of total reads assigned
to ANME related to reads assigned to each of these SRB
genera in the 10-15 cm metagenome were ANME:
Desulfobacterium; 16: 1, ANME Desulfatibacillum; 20:1
and ANME: Desulfococcus; 24: 1. The total ratio ANME:
SRB (including “Bacteria environmental samples”) was 4:
1.
Reads assigned to dsrAB were detected in both metagenomes and classified to a diverse set of taxa (see Figure 6). Although the fraction of the community
containing mcrA and dsrAB, calculated based on sampling probability of the specific marker genes, is likely to
be overestimated it gives a similar ratio of 3: 1 of mcrAcontaining organisms: dsrAB containing organisms as
the taxonomic binning of reads. None of our dsrAB
reads were assigned to the known ANME partner Desulfococcus, although this genus was one of the most abundant SRB genera in our metagenomes (see Figure 4).

Håvelsrud et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/221

This does not imply absence of dsrAB among Desulfococcus in our samples; the gene was more likely missed
by chance due to low coverage (see Additional file 2,
Table S2).
ANME might also form syntrophic relationships to
other bacteria than those most commonly recognized.
ANME-2 has previously been detected to form physical
associations to both Desulfobulbus and a member of the
Betaproteobacteria, as well as their regular partners
from the Desulfococcus/Desulfosarcina branch [53]. The
main bulk of dsrAB-reads in the 10-15 cm metagenome
were assigned to “bacterial environmental samples” and
the ANME partners might be found among these organisms. The “bacterial environmental samples” is however
a diverse group and was also abundant in the 0-4 cm
metagenome, where ANME were less abundant.
Our results do not indicate only one predominant
ANME partner, but rather that several syntrophic partners may be involved. Diverse dsrAB signatures with
only weak coupling to AOM have previously been
detected in ANME-1 dominated sediments in the Gulf
of Mexico [39]. This suggests that these seep environments have a high diversity of taxa involved in sulphate
reduction.

Conclusions
By using 454 sequenced metagenomes we achieved an
insight into the taxonomic richness of the seep sediments. Most of the taxa were present in both metagenomes and differences in community structure and
corresponding metabolic potential between the two
samples were due to abundance, indicating sliding
boundaries between the different communities. Our
approach provided strong evidence for the taxa responsible for methane oxidation. The Tonya Seep harboured
several taxa potentially capable of methane oxidation
under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This suggests that the sediment is a robust methane filter, where
taxa presently dominating this important process could
be replaced by less abundant taxa should the environmental conditions change.
Methods
Sampling site

Tonya Seep (34°24.043’N; 119°52.841’W) is located in
the Coal Oil Point seep field offshore Santa Barbara,
California, USA. Tonya Seep is primarily a single 2 m
diameter pit with many vents inside that rapidly coalesce into a single plume. There was a high content of
hydrocarbons and tar in the sediments. Four sediment
cores, two for methane oxidation studies and two for
metagenomic analysis, were collected at 25 m depth on
July 16th 2008 by UC Santa Barbara Marine Operation
divers. The polycarbonate liners used (30 cm length and

Page 10 of 14

3.5 cm diameter) were treated with 70% ethanol and
dried before sampling. The parallel cores (core I, II, III
and IV) were sealed at the seafloor and kept on ice during transportation back to shore.
Gas Sample Collection

Two seep gas samples (Gas samples I and II) were collected in the surface waters above the seep. The samples
were collected on two occasions from small vessels via
an inverted funnel method in which seep gas bubbles
were captured into 120 mL glass serum vials after rising
through the water column. Bottles were capped underwater after filling to avoid contamination with atmospheric gases. Seep gases were analyzed by gas
chromatography as previously described [54]. Error
associated with the concentration measurements was
±4%.
Methane oxidation rates

Cores III and IV designated for methane oxidation rate
(MOR) measurements were injected with radiotracer
14
C-CH4 (1 kBq 14CH4 dissolved in water, 20 μL injection volume) at 2 cm intervals and incubated at near insitu temperature. After 18 hours the core was sub-sectioned and placed into vials with 1 M NaOH and
quickly sealed, ending the incubation and trapping the
CO 2 . A small sample of headspace (0.2 mL) was
removed to determine CH4 concentration (which is not
affected by the 14CH4 spike) by GC-FID (Shimadzu GC4A, 6 ft length 80/100 mesh Molsieve 13X packed column run isothermally at 140°C with N2 carrier flow at
15 mL min-1). The remaining 14CH4 in the headspace of
the vial was purged via a slow flow of air through a
combustion tube filled with Cu(II)-oxide and maintained
at 850°C. The resulting 14CO2 was trapped using a mixture of phenethylamine and 2-methoxyethanol. The
remaining 14CO2, which was assumed to be microbially
produced, was measured by first transferring the sediment into a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a small
(7 mL) phenethylamine/NaOH-filled scintillation vial
suspended beneath its rubber stopper. Six ml of hydrochloric acid (6 M) was injected through the rubber stopper to degas the CO2 from the sediment/NaOH slurry,
and the flask was placed in a shaker for ~8 hrs to transfer the CO2 to the suspended scintillation vial. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting (Beckman
LSC 6500).
The ex-situ CH4 oxidation rates (MOR) were calculated by the following equation:
MOR=14 CO2 × CH4 /

14

CH4 × v × t

(1)

where 14 CO 2 is the activity of the microbially-produced CO2, CH4 is the amount of CH4 in the sample,

Håvelsrud et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:221

CH 4 is the activity of the injected CH 4 , v is the
volume of the sediment and t is the incubation time.

DNA extraction

For metagenomic analysis, cores I and II were pushed
out from the liners and the 0-4 cm bsf and the 10-15
cm bsf horizons were removed for DNA extraction.
Multiple parallel 0.5 g subsamples of the cores at each
horizon were used for DNA extraction. Total genomic
DNA was extracted with a FastDNA®SPIN for Soil Kit
(MP Biomedicals) and cleaned using Wizard DNA
Clean-Up (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The DNA quality was assessed by agarose
gel electrophoresis and by optical density using a NanoDrop instrument (NanoDrop Products, Thermo Scientific). To get enough high quality DNA for the
subsequent 454 sequencing DNA, subsamples from the
same horizon were pooled. Of the total DNA isolated
from the 0-4 cm horizon, 35% originated from core I
and 65% from core II. For the 10-15 cm horizon, 38%
was isolated from core I and 62% from core II.
454 sequencing

For creation of the metagenomic libraries, 9.8 μg DNA
of the 0-4 cm sample and 6.8 μg of the 10-15 cm sample were used. Sample preparation and sequencing of
the extracted DNA were performed at the Norwegian
High-Throughput Sequencing Centre (NSC) at CEES
[55], University of Oslo according to standard GS FLX
Titanium protocols, except that after the initial dsDNA
immobilization, ssDNA was brought into solution by
adding 50 μl 1 × TE to the beads, followed by 2 min at
90°C and rapid cooling on ice.
The samples were tagged (fusion primers with tag
sequences were used to mark sample origin), mixed and
sequenced on a 70 × 75 format PicoTiterPlate™ on a
GS FLX titanium instrument.
The metagenomic reads have been submitted to the
Genbank Sequence Read archive [GeneBank:
SRP005641].
The average of the mean quality score per sequence
was 33.1 (standard deviation: 3.6) and 32.9 (standard
deviation: 3.5) for the 0-4 cm metagenome and 10-15
cm metagenome respectively.

Page 11 of 14

(0.65%) low quality reads. The 10-15 cm metagenome
contained 395 reads with more than 2 ambiguous bases
and 143 reads with long homopolymers (> 10 nt), making a total of 535 (0.28%) low quality reads.
Taxonomic classification

The reads were taxonomically classified by BlastX query
against the NCBI non-redundant Protein Database
(ncbiP-nr) [58]. The computation was performed at the
freely available Bioportal computer service [59]. Maximum expectation-value was set to 10.0 and maximum
25 alignments were reported per hit. The BlastX output
files were analysed according to NCBI taxonomy in the
program MEGAN, version 3.9 [44] with default LCAparameters (Min Score: 35, Top Percent: 10.0 and Min
Support: 5). We used the option “enable all taxa” in
MEGAN in order to account for reads with hits to the
artificial taxa archaeal and bacterial “environmental
samples”.
Rarefaction analysis

The species richness was estimated by rarefaction analysis performed in MEGAN [44]. The MEGAN program
uses an LCA-algorithm to bin reads to taxa based on
their blast-hits. This results in a rooted tree where each
node represents a taxon. The leaves in this tree are then
used as OTUs in the rarefaction analysis. The program
randomly chooses 10%, 20% ... 100% of the total number
of reads as subsets. For each of these random subsets
the number of leaves (hit with at least 5 reads (Min
Support) is determined. This sub sampling is repeated
20 times and then the average value is used for each
percentage. We did the analysis at the most resolved
level of the NCBI taxonomy to capture as much of the
richness as possible. At this level, the leaves are mostly
strains and species but also some sequences like fosmids
and plasmids are included. In cases were no reads are
assigned to species the most detailed taxonomic level
with 5 reads or more assigned are used.
The analysis was performed for total taxa in the metagenomes (including Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota,
Viruses and Environmental sequences), and separately
for archaeal and bacterial taxa.
Comparison of metagenomes

Replicate removal

Replicate reads were removed from the two metagenomes using the 454 Replicate filter [56,57]. Standard settings of a sequence identity cut off of 0.9, a length
difference requirement of 0 and a number of beginning
base pairs to check of 3, were used. After removal of
replicates, the 0-4 cm metagenome contained 525 reads
with more than 2 ambiguous bases and 1222 reads with
long homopolymers (> 10 nt), making a total of 1733

The metagenomes were compared at the phylum, class
and genus level in MEGAN using absolute read counts
[44]. Tabulated text files for each level were extracted
from MEGAN and analyzed in the following manner:
The metagenomes were normalized to the size of the
smallest metagenome. Taxa without matches in one
metagenome, or with less than 20 reads in both metagenomes, were removed from the comparison since they
(due to their low abundance) could have been identified

Håvelsrud et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:221
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/221

by chance and thereby represent uninformative data.
The resulting normalized comparison was analyzed for
overrepresented taxa using XIPE-totec with 20.000 samplings and with a confidence cut-off of 0.95, 0.98 and
0.99 [25].
Metabolic potential

Reads were annotated to KEGG Orthologe (KO)-identifiers using KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS)
[60,61]. Parameters used were: single-directional best
hit, default bit score (60) and 40 manually selected reference genomes (Additional file 5, Table S5). Reference
genomes were chosen from the most abundant species
present in the metagenomes based on annotation in
MEGAN.
The KO-identifiers were, if possible, replaced by corresponding Enzyme Commission (EC)-numbers using the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
Orthology database [62-65].
Lists of unique EC and KO numbers (when no ECnumber was obtained) were created for each metagenome. These lists were then used to plot metabolic pathways for the two metagenomes onto metabolic pathway
maps using KEGG Mapper: Colour Objects in KEGG
Pathways [62-65].
Signature genes for methane oxidation

The reads were compared to protein sequence libraries
for methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA), particulate
methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and dissimilatory sulphite reductase (dsrAB) on the freely available Bioportal
computer service [59]. The reference library for each
enzyme was downloaded from Fungene (Functional
gene pipeline & repository) version v6.1 [66]. We limited the libraries by selecting only the sequences with a
score (bits saved) of 100 or more from the HMMER
Hidden Markov Model search against NCBIs nonredundant protein database. We used blastX against the
protein sequences of each enzyme library with a maximum expectation value of 1.0E-20 [58]. Maximum one
alignment was reported.
BlastX output files were further analyzed using NCBItaxonomy in MEGAN, version 3.9 [44]. The LCA-parameters were set to: Min Score: 35, Top Percent: 10.0
and Min Support: 1. All taxa were enabled.
Estimates of effective genome sizes (EGS) and sampling
probabilities of individual genes

EGS was calculated according to the method developed
by Raes et al [48] using the parameters a = 18.26, b =
3650 and c = 0.733. Blast against a subset of the
STRING database (v9.0), containing the COGs concerned, were conducted at the freely available Bioportal
computer service [59,67].

Page 12 of 14

Sampling probability of the individual marker genes
and expected number of sequences detected was calculated according to Beszteri et al [68]. We calculated
with an average copy number of two for pmoA [69] and
one for mcrA and dsrAB [70-72]. Average marker gene
length was based on the reads present in the respective
marker gene databases.
