Abstract
Background: The detection of odorants is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs). ORs are Gprotein coupled receptors that form a remarkably large protein superfamily in vertebrate genomes.
We used data that became available through recent sequencing efforts of reptilian and avian
genomes to identify the complete OR gene repertoires in a lizard, the green anole (Anolis
carolinensis), and in two birds, the chicken (Gallus gallus) and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata).
Results: We identified 156 green anole OR genes, including 42 pseudogenes. The OR gene
repertoire of the two bird species was substantially larger with 479 and 553 OR gene homologs in
the chicken and zebra finch, respectively (including 111 and 221 pseudogenes, respectively). We
show that the green anole has a higher fraction of intact OR genes (~72%) compared with the
chicken (~66%) and the zebra finch (~38%). We identified a larger number and a substantially higher
proportion of intact OR gene homologs in the chicken genome than previously reported (214
versus 82 genes and 66% versus 15%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis showed that lizard and
bird OR gene repertoires consist of group α, θ and γ genes. Interestingly, the vast majority of the
avian OR genes are confined to a large expansion of a single branch (the so called γ-c clade). An
analysis of the selective pressure on the paralogous genes of each γ-c clade revealed that they have
been subjected to adaptive evolution. This expansion appears to be bird-specific and not sauropsidspecific, as it is lacking from the lizard genome. The γ-c expansions of the two birds do not intermix,
i.e., they are lineage-specific. Almost all (group γ-c) OR genes mapped to the unknown
chromosome. The remaining OR genes mapped to six homologous chromosomes plus three to
four additional chromosomes in the zebra finch and chicken.
Conclusion: We identified a surprisingly large number of potentially functional avian OR genes.
Our data supports recent evidence that avian olfactory ability may be better developed than
previously thought. We hypothesize that the radiation of the group γ-c OR genes in each bird
lineage parallels the evolution of specific olfactory sensory functions.

Background
Olfaction plays a pivotal role for many organisms. It is
used to detect food, conspecifics, mates, as well as threats.
However, the sense of smell is obviously more important
to certain animals than others. Birds (with the exception
of tube-nosed seabirds, Procellariiformes, and a few members of other groups such as New World vultures or the
flightless and nocturnal kiwis) have traditionally been
thought to possess an olfactory system inferior to, e.g.,
mammals, reflecting their overriding reliance on visual
and sound cues, exemplified by elaborate and colourful
feather plumages (e.g., birds of paradise) and complex
song patterns (e.g., nightingales) [for reviews, see [1-3]].
Recent findings have questioned this view, as it turns out
that many groups of birds, including songbirds, Passeriformes, apparently have an acute sense of smell and
accordingly are likely to also rely on olfaction in their
daily life [4-7]. It is important to note that these findings
do not imply that all birds have similar olfactory systems
and abilities. Instead, one can expect that even closely
related species experienced different selection pressures
on olfactory abilities. This notion was recently supported
by the finding that the olfactory receptor gene repertoire
of the nocturnal kakapo, Strigops habroptilus, that is known
to rely heavily on olfactory cues is larger than that of its
related, but diurnal relatives (kea, Nestor notabilis, and
kaka, Nestor meridionalis). This result strongly suggests that
e.g. ecological niche adaptations such as daily activity patterns can lead to different olfactory abilities in close relatives [8].
Among vertebrates, the sense of smell is mediated by
olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed in sensory neurons
within the olfactory epithelium [9,10]. The coding region
of OR genes is small (approximately 1000 bp) and intronless [9,11]. Surprisingly, in-silico mining of the first draft
of the chicken (Gallus gallus) genome (release February
2004) revealed a very large gene family encoding putative
ORs [12-14]. Interestingly, the vast majority of these OR
genes are confined to a large expansion of a single branch
(the so called γ-c clade), in contrast to other vertebrates,
where the OR genes are scattered across multiple clades
[13,15]. This organization of the chicken OR subgenome
was also hinted at in another study on a diversity of nine
bird species from seven different orders (Anseriformes,
Apterygiformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Passeriformes, Procellariiformes, Psittaciformes), including the
chicken [15]. However, the previous study was based on
PCR and degenerate primers. Due to limitations of the
PCR based method (e.g., primer bias), the previous study
may have provided a biased representation of the OR repertoire with respect to the family composition. Thus, it is
likely that the results obtained from whole genome
searches are more accurate. Genome searches are also
needed to show whether the large expansion of OR genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/446

is indeed a common feature of birds and whether it is
exclusive to birds within the sauropsid lineage. Finally, a
genome-wide approach allows the mapping of the identified OR genes to specific chromosomal locations.
The availability of a second bird genome, that of the zebra
finch (Taeniopygia guttata), provides the opportunity for a
genome-wide comparative investigation into the structure
of the bird OR family. To our knowledge, the OR gene repertoire of this avian model species has not yet been investigated. A genomic analysis of the OR genes from the
zebra finch will reveal whether its OR gene repertoire is
similar to the previously estimated OR gene repertoires
from two other songbirds, that of the blue tit (Cyanistes
caeruleus) and the canary (Serinus canaria) [15]. Furthermore, the recent sequencing of the first reptilian genome
(the Anolis lizard, Anolis carolinensis) allows for a comparison across the sauropsid lineage.
We here report on an exhaustive search for candidate OR
genes from the draft genomes of the chicken (release May
2006), zebra finch (release July 2008) and green anole
(release February 2007). The use of the recently improved
chicken genome assembly improved previous estimates of
the OR gene repertoire in the chicken. We identified a
larger number and a substantially higher proportion of
intact OR gene homologs in the chicken genome than previously reported [13]. We show that the expanded γ-c
clade found in chicken is also present in the zebra finch
genome. This expansion appears to be bird-specific and
not sauropsid-specific, as it is lacking from the lizard
genome. We also demonstrate that the γ-c clade has been
subjected to adaptive evolution. In addition, and surprisingly, the γ-c expansions of the two bird species do not
intermix, i.e., they are lineage-specific. Finally, we show
that the green anole has a comparatively small OR gene
repertoire compared with other terrestrial vertebrates. Our
findings raise the question why birds have evolved a special clade of species-specific OR genes. The function of
these genes in relation to the birds' reliance on smell
remains unknown.

Methods
Detection of OR genes from the genome
The draft genome assemblies of the green anole (Anolis
carolinensis, released in February 2007; anoCar1), the
chicken (Gallus gallus, released in May 2006; galGal3) and
the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, released in July 2008;
taeGut1) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site [16]. Note that at the time of our analysis,
the green anole genome consisted of 7,233 'scaffold'
sequences.

In a first screening local TBLASTN [17] searches with an Evalue ≤ 10 were conducted using known amino acid

sequences of 3317 intact OR genes from seven species
(western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis (410), zebra fish
Danio rerio (98), puffer fish Fugu rubripes (40), chicken
(77), mouse Mus musculus (1106), rat Rattus norvegicus
(1198), and human Homo sapiens (388)). Sequences were
obtained from ref. [13] (western clawed frog, zebra fish,
puffer fish, chicken) and [18] (human). Mouse and rat OR
sequences were obtained by downloading sequences
annotated with the keyword 'olfactory receptor' from
GenBank [19].
After collecting hit sequences of putative OR genes, nonoverlapping blast-hits showing the lowest E-values were
extracted. A local version of RepeatMasker [20] that contained either (i) a specific library of known chicken fulllength OR nucleotide sequences [13] or (ii) a (non-OR)
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) sequence library consisting of 327 chicken sequences [14] was used to distinguish OR genes from non-OR GPCRs. Sequences that
were more similar to non-OR GPCRs than to OR genes or
shorter than 150 nucleotides were removed from further
analyses. Remaining hits were subsequently classified into
intact genes, partial genes or pseudogenes following reference [18] with minor modifications. In brief, translated
sequences were regarded as "intact" if they were ≥ 250
amino acids long, included the start codon methionine
and comprised all seven transmembrane (TM) domains
without any interrupting stop codons and/or frameshifts.
TM domains were identified using the TMHMM server
[21,22]. Therefore, intact OR genes are potentially functional and likely to be expressed on olfactory receptor
neurons. Sequences were regarded as "pseudogenes" if a
stop codon and/or frameshift and/or less than seven TM
domains were detected by visual inspection of the alignment. Sequences were regarded as "partial" if they were
shorter than 750 nucleotides and contained at least one
sequence gap within the sequence or its 20 nucleotidelong flanking region. Open reading frames (ORFs) were
detected and extracted using the program getorf [23] of the
EMBOSS package [24]. Sequences that were identified and
classified as "intact" were added to the RepeatMasker
library. Subsequently, a second round of analysis was performed to ensure that the search was exhaustive. All OR
genes were mapped to the corresponding genomic
sequences.
We used the program "skipredundant" of the EMBOSS
package [24,25] to detect redundant hits in our sets. We
only included OR genes whose sequences and flanking
regions (up to 500 nucleotides) were not identical.
Phylogenetic analyses
The amino acid sequences of intact OR genes were used
for the construction of a multi-species phylogenetic tree
(see below). MAFFT [26,27] was used with default settings
to construct multiple amino acid sequence alignments of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/446

intact OR genes. GENEDOC [28,29] was used for visual
inspection and manual correction of alignments (e.g.,
trimming of N- and C-highly variable ends). Phylogenetic
trees were constructed from Poisson corrected distances
using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method implemented in
the MEGA 4 software [30,31]. The reliability of the phylogenetic trees was evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
HyperTree [32] was used to edit the phylogenetic trees.
Detection of conserved motifs
To detect conserved motifs in predicted OR protein
sequences, sequence logos were generated from an alignment of intact green anole, chicken and zebra finch OR
sequences using the program WebLogo [33,34]. The
TMHMM server [21] was used to identify intracellular
(IC) and extracellular (EC) domains.
Positive selection analyses
Selection at the protein level can often be detected using
the ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous to the rate of synonymous substitutions (ω = dN/dS) [35]. Positive selection
(i.e., selection favoring changes in the protein sequence),
neutral evolution and purifying selection (selection
against deleterious alleles and thus, against changes in the
protein sequence), is indicated by ω>1, ω = 1 and ω<1,
respectively [35]. The single likelihood ancestor counting
(SLAC) method with default settings, implemented in the
Datamonkey web-interface [36] was used to estimate the
global ω value and to test for signatures of positive selection on individual codons of each group γ-c clade (see
below). The intact OR sequences were codon-aligned
using MAFFT, the alignment was manually edited and
alignment gaps present in >85% of the sequences were
removed. A significance level of 0.05 was used. Because
the SLAC analysis is currently restricted to 150 sequences
[36], we randomly selected 150 out of 165 chicken group
γ-c OR genes for analysis. Note that although these methods are generally capable of efficiently identifying positively selected sites, they may also miss some positively
selected sites, in particular if positive selection is weak.

Results
Composition of the green anole, chicken and zebra finch
OR gene repertoires
OR genes from the draft genome assemblies of the green
anole, zebra finch and chicken were identified by a comprehensive data mining approach. The numbers of intact,
partial and pseudogenes that were identified in the three
species are shown in Table 1. The amino acid sequences of
the intact OR genes and the nucleotide sequences of pseudogenes identified in this study are available in the supplementary material (see Additional file 1 &2).

The proportion of intact OR genes varied between 38%
(zebra finch) and 72% (green anole) (Table 1). The entire
OR gene repertoires were of similar size in the chicken and

the zebra finch (~500), but the chicken had a larger
number (and thus proportion) of intact OR genes (Table
1). Approximately 30% of the avian OR repertoires were
partial sequences. Improved versions of the genomes will
clarify whether these sequences are pseudogenes or intact
OR genes.
The avian OR gene repertoires were approximately three
times larger than that of the green anole (Table 1). A comparison with Niimura & Nei's [13] and Lagerstrom's [14]
datasets revealed that we identified 160 novel chicken OR
genes (30 intact, 86 partial and 44 pseudogenes) that were
not reported previously.
Phylogenetic relationships of green anole, zebra finch and
chicken OR genes
All putative ORs appeared to be bona fide ORs when evaluated. Following Niimura & Nei's classification [13], lizard and bird OR gene repertoires consist of group α, θ and
γ genes. The large majority of OR genes in the green anole,
chicken and zebra finch can be classified as group γ OR
genes (equivalent to the "class II" genes [37]) (Figure 1).
Several clades contained both bird and green anole OR
sequences, indicating that these clades diverged before the
divergence of the three species. Interestingly, there was an
enormous expansion in the number of genes in the γgroups of both bird species, termed the γ-c clade (Figure
1). This clade was supported by a high bootstrap value
(100%). This expansion seems to be specific to birds, as it
could not be detected in the green anole (Figure 1) and in
other vertebrates (data not shown)[15,37]. Approximately 77% and 96% of the intact genes in chicken and
zebra finch were group γ-c genes. Notably, within the
group γ-c ORs, sequences from the species did not intermingle with each other. Members of the γ -c clade were
highly similar in sequence (on average 88 and 92%
sequence identity on the nucleic acid level in the chicken
and zebra finch, respectively; see below). An analysis of

the selective pressures on the paralogous genes of each
group γ-c clade revealed that the global ω values were similarly low for both bird species (0.44 and 0.45 in the
chicken and zebra finch, respectively), indicating that
most avian group γ-c clade codons are under purifying
selection. The site-by-site analysis showed that there is evidence for positive selection at some sites: the SLAC software detected 16 (zebra finch) and 18 (chicken) positively
selected codons, respectively (see Additional File 3). In
both species, seven positively selected codons were
located in TM regions (see Additional file 3).
An overview of sequence identities between green anole,
chicken and zebra finch intact OR genes is provided in
Additional file 4. Sequence logos of predicted green anole,
chicken and zebra finch protein OR sequences illustrate
the sequence conservation of ORs (Figure 2). Notably,
avian ORs were generally more conserved than those from
the green anole. This is indicated by fewer and larger letters at individual positions in the logo. The main reason
for this observation is that the members of the expanded
γ-c clade in birds are highly identical in sequence (the
majority of OR genes belong to the γ-c clade in birds, see
above). Four conserved motifs that are characteristic for
ORs and have been described in other vertebrate species
[for review, see ref [38]] were also found with slight modifications in the three species investigated in this study
(Figure 2). Notably, one feature was quite distinct
between the three species: the consensus motif MAYDRY
was found in the green anole, whereas the motif MSYDRYand MCYDRY is characteristic for chicken and the zebra
finch ORs, respectively.
Genomic locations of green anole, chicken and zebra finch
OR genes
The genomic locations of chicken and zebra finch OR
genes are shown in Table 2. OR genes were distributed on
10 and 9 chromosomes in the chicken and zebra finch,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/446

sequence contigs that are not yet allocated to named chromosomes. In particular, the chromosomal location of
almost all intact group γ-c OR genes is still unknown (156
out of 165 in the chicken and 116 out of 128 in the zebra
finch, respectively; Table 2). Group γ-c OR genes that were
assigned to the unknown chromosome could be localised
on 129 and 362 distinct supercontigs (i.e., an ordered
group of contigs that still include gaps) in the chicken and
zebra finch, respectively (out of 17001 and 35035 possible supercontigs, Table 3). We could not determine on
how many chromosomes green anole OR genes were distributed because the genome information is currently
only organized in scaffolds. Yet, anole OR genes were distributed in only 20 scaffolds of 7233 possible, strongly
suggesting that green anole OR genes occur in clusters in
the genome.

Discussion
Comparison of the reptilian and the avian OR gene
repertoires
We showed that the OR gene repertoires are substantially
larger in the two bird species (chicken, zebra finch) than
in the green anole. Similarly, the absolute number of
intact OR genes varied greatly, with twice as many intact
OR genes in the chicken than in the green anole. The
number of intact OR genes was only slightly larger in the
zebra finch than in the green anole. However, we expect
the real number of intact OR genes in the zebra finch to be
larger, because many partial genes may turn into intact
genes in the next assembly of the zebra finch genome.

respectively. In the chicken and zebra finch, OR genes
were also mapped to one linkage group. ORs were distributed on macro-chromosomes (chicken: chromosome 1, 5;
zebra finch: 1, 2, 5), intermediate chromosomes (chicken:
chromosome 9, 10; zebra finch: 9, 10) and micro-chromosomes (chicken: chromosomes 11, 17, 18, 25, 27;
zebra finch: 17, 27) (the classification of chromosomes
follows ref [12]). Group α and θ genes occur on homologous chromosomes in both avian genomes. In the chicken
only, one pseudogene was mapped to a sex chromosome.
However, the large majority of chicken and zebra finch
OR genes (81 and 91%, respectively) were assigned to the
unknown chromosome (chrUn_random and Un in the
chicken and zebra finch, respectively), which refers to

It is reasonable to assume that gene duplications occurred
in the bird lineages after the reptile-bird divergence, possibly as an adaptation to new ecological niches and new
odorous environments [39]. As an intermediate evolutionary step, copy number variations within populations
may have contributed to the intensive paralog birth in the
bird lineage [40,41]. The "successful" paralogs may have
been fixed and maintained, whereas "unsuccessful" paralogs became pseudogenes in the population [42]. Interestingly, copy number variations are specifically enriched
among evolutionary "young" OR genes in humans (i.e.,
human ORs that have a closely related paralog in the
human genome) [40]. It is possible that the same mechanism applies to the recently expanded avian group γ-c
genes.
The group γ-c OR genes rapidly expanded in the chicken
and zebra finch lineage, but is absent in the anolis lineage
and in other vertebrates. Within the γ-c OR clade,
sequences from the same species were very similar and
therefore cluster together in phylogenetic trees. Therefore,
this result supports a previous study that was based on
PCR and degenerate primers, rather than on genomic data
[15]. Two different scenarios that are not mutually exclu-

sive may explain this clustering pattern. First, the speciesspecific γ-c OR clades may have arisen from independent
expansion events. Second, ancient γ-c OR clade genes
became homogenized by concerted evolution within species [15,43]. Because even a single point mutation in the
binding site of an OR can alter the ligand specificity
thereby increasing or decreasing the affinity of the OR for
certain odorant molecules [44], a large number of paralogs could be advantageous, for example in evolutionary
arms races between predator and prey.
It has been suggested that positive selection contributes to
a diverse repertoire of OR genes in fish [[45-47], but see,
[48]] and mammals [[49-53], but see, [54,55]]. We
showed that a large number of positively selected sites are
present in group γ-c OR genes and thus, it is likely that
similarly, positive selection also contributes to a diverse
repertoire of OR genes in birds. In both bird species, seven
positively selected codons were located in TM domains.

Furthermore two (chicken) and three (zebra finch) of
these seven codons were located in TM5, a domain which
forms much of the putative ligand-binding pocket of OR
receptors [56]. Therefore, these group γ-c OR codons that
show signatures of positive selection are likely to be functionally relevant. Average ω values usually range from
0.05 to 0.25 in other vertebrates. Hence, the estimates presented here in both bird species (~0.4) were high. This can
be explained by the occurrence of a large number of sites
under positive selection. A similar pattern has been
observed in trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR)
genes, a second class of chemosensory receptors that are
expressed in the olfactory epithelium [57-59]. One has to
keep in mind that the results of the positive selection test
should be treated with caution because estimates of positive selection among members of multi-gene families may
be flawed if there are homogenizing effects caused by gene
conversion within the family [60]. As mentioned above,
potential concerted evolution among the γ-c OR genes

within species could be interpreted in such that gene conversion is common. Ideally, functional validation of the
ORs to test whether the results are biologically significant
should be conducted [61].
It is tempting to speculate that the species-specific clustering of the γ-c clade reflects species-specific chemosensory
capacities. However, to our knowledge, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is currently lacking.
Interestingly, a similar rapid expansion of OR genes has
been observed in the western-clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) lineage (this clade was termed γ-a and γ-b) [13]. It may
be worth to investigate whether this expansion occurred
in other amphibians as well, or whether it is restricted to
Xenopus tropicalis.
Chicken olfactory receptor genes
The total number of chicken OR genes was similar to
those reported in previous studies [[13,39] but see reference [12]] (see Additional file 5). However, our estimate
of the proportion of intact OR genes in the chicken was
substantially higher than previously reported [13](but see
ref [12,39]). The most likely reason for this discrepancy is
that we used a more recent and improved version of the
chicken genome assembly (Version 2.1; released in May
2006). As predicted by Niimura and Nei [13], the quality
of the second draft of the chicken genome increased and
the number of short contigs that are few kilobases long
decreased. Therefore, it is not surprising that we could
identify a larger number of intact OR genes. Due to the
existence of 154 partial genes that may become intact in
the next assembly of the chicken genome, we may still
have underestimated the number of intact OR genes.
Comparison of the chicken and zebra finch OR gene
repertoires
Previously, we used PCR with degenerate primers and a
non-parametric estimation technique to assess OR gene
repertoire sizes in nine different bird species from seven
different orders [15]. Based on our results, we hypothesized that the chicken would have a larger OR gene repertoire but a similar fraction of functional OR genes than
the zebra finch. Contrary to our hypothesis, the OR gene
repertoires - identified by searching the genome databases
- were of similar size (~500) and the fraction of intact OR
genes were higher in the chicken than in the zebra finch
(66 versus 38%). However, one has to keep in mind that
the proportion of intact OR genes in the zebra finch is
probably underestimated, as argued above. Hence, we
expect that forthcoming and improved versions of the
genomic sequences will lead to an increase in the estimated proportion of intact OR genes (as observed in the
chicken).

Comparative genomic studies suggest that the olfactory
acuity of vertebrates correlates positively with the propor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/446

tion of intact OR genes encoded in their genomes [62].
For example, Gilad et al. [62] showed that New World
monkeys and prosimians - animals that highly rely on
their sense of smell - have a higher proportion of intact
OR genes than vision-oriented Old world monkeys and
apes that have evolved a trichromatic colour-vision system. In addition, amongst primates, the proportion of
intact OR genes is significantly reduced in humans
(~50%) when compared with other apes (~70%)
[[62,63], but see [64]]. Accordingly, one may expect the
zebra finch to have reduced olfactory capabilities compared to the chicken. This seems reasonable because the
relative size of the olfactory bulb compared to the cerebral
hemisphere, often used as a morphological indicator of
olfactory ability, is considerably smaller in the zebra finch
than in the chicken (4 versus 15%, respectively)[65].
Therefore, songbirds were long thought to not have a welldeveloped sense of smell. Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating that songbirds use their sense of smell in a variety of contexts [4,6,66]. Therefore, we agree with Nei et al.
[39] and doubt that the proportion of intact OR genes is a
good indicator of olfactory abilities
Chromosomal location of OR genes
Previous studies showed that OR genes are distributed on
different chromosomes and generally form genomic clusters in vertebrates [39,67,68]. Although we could only
assign few OR genes to chromosomes, there is evidence
that OR genes occur on at least 9 and 10 chromosomes in
the zebra finch and the chicken (out of 40 and 39, respectively). The distribution of OR genes on the chromosomes
was generally well conserved between the chicken and the
zebra finch. This may not be surprising because the conservation of the avian karyotype is relatively high [69].
The distribution of the γ-c OR gene clade could not been
determined. We doubt that their multiple placement on
"unknown" chromosomes is simply an assembly artefact
because Southern Blots using group γ-c OR genes as
probes reveal a large number of bands in several bird species [8], and chicken [8], unpublished data]. It seems reasonable to assume that γ-c OR genes are distributed on
only few chromosomes for two reasons. First, OR genes
that cluster together in a phylogenetic tree usually cluster
in chromosomal locations (see above). Second, the
number of supercontigs encoding group γ-c OR genes are
considerably smaller than the total number of OR genes.
However, it should be noted that currently there seems to
be more evidence for genomic clustering of OR genes in
the chicken than in the zebra finch. In addition, it is likely
that γ-c OR genes are distributed on micro-chromosomes
rather than on macro-chromosomes for two reasons. First,
whereas the macro-chromosomes have been sequenced
with high coverage, the micro-chromosomes are still
poorly covered [70]. Second, estimates of nucleotide substitution and recombination rates are higher on microchromosomes than on macro-chromosomes [71] which

might explain the rapid expansion of group γ-c paralogs.
Improved versions of the genomes investigated may yield
additional insights about the genomic distribution of OR
genes, in both reptiles and birds.

Conclusion
The large number of potentially functional avian OR
genes supports the notion that avian olfactory ability may
be better developed than previously thought, and perhaps
even better developed than in reptiles. We hypothesize
that the radiation of the group γ-c OR genes in each bird
lineage parallels the evolution of specific olfactory sensory
function, but this remains to be shown.
