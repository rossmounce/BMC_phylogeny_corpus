Abstract
Background: Reconstruction of evolutionary history of bacteriophages is a difficult problem
because of fast sequence drift and lack of omnipresent genes in phage genomes. Moreover, losses
and recombinational exchanges of genes are so pervasive in phages that the plausibility of
phylogenetic inference in phage kingdom has been questioned.
Results: We compiled the profiles of presence and absence of 803 orthologous genes in 158
completely sequenced phages with double-stranded DNA genomes and used these gene content
vectors to infer the evolutionary history of phages. There were 18 well-supported clades, mostly
corresponding to accepted genera, but in some cases appearing to define new taxonomic groups.
Conflicts between this phylogeny and trees constructed from sequence alignments of phage
proteins were exploited to infer 294 specific acts of intergenome gene transfer.
Conclusion: A notoriously reticulate evolutionary history of fast-evolving phages can be
reconstructed in considerable detail by quantitative comparative genomics.
Open peer review: This article was reviewed by Eugene Koonin, Nicholas Galtier and Martijn
Huynen.

Background
The interest in bacteriophage biology may be at its alltime high, with the new appreciation of phage ubiquity,
improved understanding of the role played by phages in
controlling host abundance and in host genome evolution, and because phage genomes are the source of useful
molecular reagents and new antibacterial compounds.
The ongoing sequencing of phage genomes produces the

unprecedented amount of data, which is indispensable
for understanding phage biology.
In spite of these advances, the taxonomic diversity of
phages is just beginning to be assessed. The International
Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes several groups of phages, on the basis of shared morphological traits, such as the shape, size, and structure of

the virions, with some consideration of other molecular
properties, such as the structure of genomic nucleic acids
and similarities in the signature genes [1]. For example,
tailed bacteriophages with double-stranded DNA
genomes attain the rank of the order Caudovirales and are
divided into three main families according to their tail
morphology: Siphoviridae (long noncontractile tail), Myoviridae (long contractile tail), and Podoviridae (short tail).
Within these families, genera are defined by other molecular traits, such as the cos or pac sites, terminal redundancy
and circular permutation of the genome, concatemer formation, modified bases, and the presence of DNA
polymerase or RNA polymerase genes. While these families account for more than 60% of Caudovirales, about
one-third of all tailed phages remain classified no further
than the family level. The proportion of unclassified
phages is comparably high in almost all phage groups.
Moreover, evolutionary relationships between phages
with different particle morphology are not well studied.
With hundreds of bacteriophage genomes completely
sequenced, it is now appropriate to undertake the systematic inventory of molecular characters and to see whether
it provides us with better understanding of phage evolution and with means to refine phage taxonomy.
Phages with dsDNA, the subject of this study, account for
about 65 percent of all phages with completely sequenced
genomes, and infect hosts from various clades of Bacteria
and Archaea. No genes are shared by all dsDNA phages, or
even by a majority of them [2], so the evolutionary reconstructions and taxonomic proposals for this group cannot
be based on the analysis of sequence alignments, as it has
been possible for cellular organisms, which all have
homologous rRNA and dozens of other universally conserved genes [3-6]. In 2002, Rohwer and Edwards [7] proposed a way to get around this limitation by using
information about shared homologous genes as a measure of similarity between phages: the pairwise distances
between genomes (which, in their case, combined the
counts of shared genes with the degree of sequence similarity between matched pair of genes) can be used for phylogenetic inference with distance matrix-based
approaches. The study of Rohwer and Edwards confirmed
the existence of several phage groups previously suggested
on the basis of morphology or single-gene phylogenies,
but the monophyly of the largest groups of DNA-containing bacteriophages, such as the family Siphoviridae, was
not supported in their "proteomic tree" [7].
In an earlier work, we have reviewed the approaches to
comparative genomics and taxonomy of dsDNA phages
and delineated Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs), the
sets of orthologous genes that are shared by three or more
phages each [2]. The sensitive algorithm of POGs construction, which does not rely on the arbitrary score cut-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

off [8], may be especially suitable for viruses, which
appear to have high percentage of short ORFs and fastevolving gene products. The coverage of phage genomes
by POGs is on average 52 percent, and it remains quite
high – 42 percent – even for the unclassified phages, suggesting dozens of characters suitable for phylogenetic
inference in most phages.
In the same study, we introduced 'phageness', i.e., the specific association of a gene with phage or prophage
genomes, as opposed to the host genomes [2]. Determination of phageness of each POG indicates that about 80
percent of POGs are rarely or never exchanged with the
host genomes, and further 8 percent of POGs appear to be
monophyletic within phages, most likely having been
gained by the phage kingdom in a single transfer event
[2]. Thus, even though many host genes have been
accrued by the phage kingdom as a whole, the vast majority of POGs are phylogenetic characters that are robust
against repeated phage-host gene exchange, and may be
useful phylogenetic markers. On the other hand, phagespecific genes are transferred within the phage kingdom
itself, producing a reticulated evolutionary history of
phage genomes, i.e., a phylogeny that has extra edges
between some branches and is no longer a 'tree' in a formal, graph-theoretical sense. This type of horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) has been postulated as a major factor in
bacteriophage evolution more than 25 years ago by David
Botstein [9], who emphasized homologous recombination between DNA genomes of co-infecting phages as the
main mechanism of HGT. More recently, numerous
examples of mosaicism in phage genomes, best explained
by gene exchanges in the absence of homologous DNA
sites, have been documented (reviewed in [10-12]). Any
realistic reconstruction of phage evolutionary history
needs to take into account HGT, and in this study, we use
the information about gene content in phages with
dsDNA genomes, in conjunction with phylogenetic signal
contained in the alignments of phage-encoded proteins,
to infer such a reticulated evolutionary history.

Results and Discussion
The set of dsDNA phages used in this study comprises all
complete genome sequences deposited in GenBank
before 2005 (Table S1, available as Additional File 1).
These genomes contain conserved genes that belong of
981 POGs, including 803 POGs that appear almost never
to be exchanged with the host genomes [2]. These 803
POGs in 158 genomes are the main character set that we
used to infer the gene-content tree of bacteriophages.
At the first step toward understanding the evolutionary
history of phages, we built a conventional phylogenetic
tree on the basis of gene content. The tree contains only
bifurcations and no reticulations, even though, as dis-

cussed above, our dataset also contains information about
(possibly frequent) gene exchanges between phages. We
reasoned that, although HGT will be initially ignored, we
might still be able to discover robustly supported, evolutionarily informative partial phylogenies, in the cases
when vertical gene inheritance is the dominant mode of
evolution in a particular phage lineage. We can then augment this initial picture by inferring reticulation events.
The symmetric matrix of all pairwise distances between
phage gene content vectors (see Methods) was used to
build tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In a fundamentally different approach, we also constructed tree
directly from the POG presence-absence characters using
Bayesian inference. In addition, we prepared datasets in
which the presences and absences of each POG across the
genomes were jumbled, and built trees from these datasets for comparison with the real data. Considerable phylogenetic signal was captured by both distance matrixbased and Bayesian trees when real data were analyzed
(Figure 1 and Figure S1 and Table S1, available as Additional Files 2 and 1, respectively). In total, 112 phages, or
71 percent of all studied genomes, were classified into 18
groups, which enjoyed moderate to strong statistical support, 53 % on the average. In contrast, analysis of trees
obtained from the jumbled data matrices revealed no
strongly supported clades (average support of 12.8%, s.d.
= 0.23; see Additional File 3 for statistical details).
The groups indicated in Figure 1 contain between 3 and
15 phages, with the average clade size of 6 genomes. The
biological plausibility of these groups is underscored by
the fact that each of them includes at least some phages
that are recognized as the nearest relatives in the ICTVapproved taxonomy or on Rohwer-Edwards' "proteomic
tree" [7]. Closer inspection, however, indicates that there
are three distinct ways in which our phage groups relate to
the ICTV taxa: i. groups including phages from only one
ICTV-approved genus (6 such groups with 39 phages), ii.
groups corresponding to an ICTV-approved genus but
containing additional species from the same family (7
groups, 36 phages), and iii. groups containing species
from different ICTV families and sometimes also from
"unclassified bacteriophages" (5 groups, 37 phages). All
three categories are supported by comparable average
number of shared POGs.
The first category comprises groups that include only
phages from the one and the same ICTV-approved genus.
These are Groups 7, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 18 (Table S1 in
Additional File 1). Group 7 consists of Sulfolobus spindleshaped viruses 1, 2, Kamchatka-1 and Ragged Hills, coinciding with family Fuselloviridae. Coliphage lambda joins
five Shiga toxin-converting phages in Group 11. Group 12
consists of three short-tailed P22-like phages Sf6, HK620,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

and ST64T, as well as the Enterobacteriaceae phage P22
itself. Group 14 includes T-even phages RB69 and T4,
pseudoT-even phages RB49 and 44RR2.8t, and SchizTeven phages Aeh1 and KVP40, as well as RM378 T4-like
phage that infects the thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus marinus. Members of Group 15 are included in ICTVapproved T7-like genus, except for an outlier, Synechococcus phage P60, which currently is classified as unassigned
member of Podoviridae by ICTV. Phages in Group 18 are
all P2-like viruses, sharing common morphology and several other traits.
Each group in the second category corresponds to an
ICTV-approved genus but contains several more species
from the same family. These are Groups 2, 3, 6, 5, 8, 10,
and 16, tentatively classified at the family level as siphoviruses (Groups 2, 3, 6, 5), podoviruses (Group 8) or myoviruses (Groups 10 and 16). Nine phages are included in
Group 2, all of them temperate phages or prophages from
Staphylococcus aureus. Evolutionary closeness of phages in
this group is manifest at the levels of nucleotide sequence,
protein sequence and genomic organization [13]. Group
3 and Group 6 consist of phages of Gram-positive dairy
bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus,
respectively. Both groups include phages sharing significant sequence similarity throughout the genome [11].
Group 5 includes three Lactococcus lactis phages that are
siphoviruses with high sequence identity [11]. Group 8
consists of four podoviruses – three closely-related Bordetella phages and Salmonella phage ε 15. Group 10 includes
three unclassified myoviruses infecting Burkholderia cenocepacia. Group 16 consists of coliphage P27, Salmonella
phage ST64B, and Shigella phage SfV, all believed to be the
lambdoid/Mu chimeras [14].
The third category, including groups 1, 4, 9, 13, and 17, is
perhaps the most interesting. The phages in Group 1
infect Bacilli. Three of them are siphoviruses, the fourth,
phage 315.4, is currently unclassified by NCBI. Similarly,
Group 4 contains three siphoviruses – two infecting Lactococcus and one infecting Streptococcus – as well as an
unclassified bacteriophage 315.3. Group 9 contains eight
podoviruses and two phages belonging to the family Tectiviridae – the enteric PRD1 phage and Bacillus thuringiensis
phage Bam35c. The phylogenetic affiliation between the
two morphologically distinct groups of phages, tectiviruses and PZA-like podoviruses, has been also noted by
Rohwer and Edwards [7]. We note that this group is
defined by a single shared character, albeit an important
one, a protein-primed DNA polymerase (POG52). Fifteen
phages isolated from Mycobacterium species form a monophyletic Group 13: all of them have siphovirus-type morphology, except for Mycobacterium phage Bxz1 that
possesses a myovirus-like contractile tail. This group is
also defined by a single shared hypothetical protein

leading to individual phages are colored according to their ICTV classification: family Siphoviridae is in magenta, Podoviridae is in

same phylogeny is presented in Fig. S1, available as Additional File 1. In the inner circle, the italicized, underlined colored numbers indicate 18 well-supported phage groups (see Supplementary Text for groups' description). They are followed by summary information of horizontal transfer events, where I stands transfer into the group, O for transfer from this group to
another group, and W for transfer within the group. The algorithm for reconstructing these events is described in Methods
and illustrated in Figure 2.

(POG921). Rather than dismissing these two groups as
spurious, we consider them plausible working hypotheses, which may be further evaluated by including new
characters into analysis or by more sensitive detection of
remote similarities between gene sequences. Group 17
consists of three tailed phages infecting archaeal hosts;
two of them, psiM2 and psiM100, have siphovirus-like
morphology, whereas phiCh1 has a myovirus-like contractile tail.

lations have been advocated for bacteria and archaea [1518]. Several algorithmic and statistical approaches to
address this problem have been proposed (e.g., references
[16] and [19-22]), but much remains to be done, especially given that none of the existing methods is equipped
to specifically address the challenges of virus genomics
discussed above. To address this problem in a novel way,
we used new modification of the T-REX algorithm (see
Methods) for automated detection of HGT events.

Phages in most groups tend to have overlapping host
ranges, at least down to the bacterial family level. This
may be indicative of both vertical inheritance of the core
set of genes in these groups and horizontal gene transfer
between phages that can co-infect the same hosts. These
possibilities are analyzed in more detail below.

The essence of the T-REX approach is in comparison of
two trees: a larger gene content tree T, such as the one
shown in Figure 1, and a smaller tree constructed on the
basis of the alignments of protein sequences from each
individual POG (a sequence family tree Tsf). The number
of sequence family trees is in principle the same as the
number of POGs, though, for algorithmic reasons, only
POGs with four or more members are used. Each Tsf contains at its tips only a subset of phages that are included in
T, because most genes are found in a small number of
phages. The gene-content tree can be pruned to retain
only those tips that are also present in the sequence-family tree, and such pruned tree Tgc exists for each Tsf. The
topology of Tsf is compared with that of Tgc, and the incongruence in two tree topologies is interpreted as the evidence of recombination/reticulation events that can be
inferred using the specific constrained optimization criteria (See Methods for details and Fig. 2 for an example).

Forty-six phages remained singletons because of insufficient statistical support for their inclusion into any group.
Nearly one-half of these phages are unclassified siphoviruses, and the rest is almost equally distributed between
unclassified podoviruses, myoviruses and 'unclassified
bacteriophages'. This, as well as the fact that none of the
ICTV families resolved as a single robustly supported
clade, indicates that phages with similar particle morphology do not always share a set of recognizably homologous
genes sufficient for reliable placement of these phages in
the phylogeny. Further analysis, including searches of
updated databases, more sensitive ortholog definition,
and perhaps inclusion of additional molecular and morphological characters, may help to place many of these
singletons on the tree, as well as to lend better statistical
support to the internal branches.
All told, our trees recovered considerable phylogenetic signal, with very few differences between the neighbour-joining and Bayesian tree. The case of placement of
BcepNazgul phage is illustrative of these occasional differences. Phages BcepNazgul and N15 share POG852,
POG853, POG967, and the same three POGs are shared
by BcepNazgul and lambda phage. The two approaches
break the ties differently. In the Bayesian tree, N15 and
PY54 are grouped together, but they are also grouped with
VHML, which shares only 1 POG with N15 and PY54. In
the NJ tree, PY54 is grouped together with phiE125 and
phi1026b6, sharing 15 POGs. On balance, the NJ tree
appears to give biologically more plausible solution.
There is no doubt that hierarchical representation is not
sufficient to provide a complete picture of phage evolution, for the already mentioned reason of HGT that is
thought to be frequent in phages. HGT has been also recognized as a confounding factor in the attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cellular prokaryotes, and
representations of evolutionary history that allow reticu-

The analysis of incongruencies between gene content tree
and sequence family trees using T-REX algorithm revealed
294 putative acts of gene transfer (Table S2, available as
Additional File 1), which involved 114 of 158 phage
genomes and 229 POGs. Despite these large absolute
numbers, the results mean that significant fraction of
phage genomes, and, notably, the majority of POGs have
not been involved even in a single phage-phage HGT
event.
"Promiscuous" phages are relatively rare: only 11 percent
of all phages appear to have acquired five or more genes
in the past, and only 10 percent have donated five or more
genes (Fig. S2 and Table S3, available as Additional Files 4
and 1, respectively). "Vagabond" POGs are even rarer: 42
POGs appear to have been transferred twice, seven POGs
were transferred three times, and only three POGs were
transferred four times. These repeatedly transferred genes
encode structural proteins, enzymes, transcription factors,
and uncharacterized proteins, in almost the same proportion as within POGs in general (Table S4, available as
Additional File 1). Thus, even though some of functional
modules in phage genomes, such as lysis cassettes, could
be viewed as particularly autonomous and suitable for
recombination with different sets of replication and transcription factors, or of capsid proteins, it appears that HGT

Inference of horizontal gene transfer between phages
Inference of horizontal gene transfer between phages. Phage genome tree is inferred from gene content data (left side
of the top panel) and sequence family trees are inferred from the aligned sequences, separately for each POG (right side of the
top panel). The T-REX algorithm is used to infer HGT events by choosing such rearrangements of the gene content tree that
reattach the subtrees in a way that minimizes the Robinson and Foulds topological distance to the appropriate sequence family
tree. On the top right, a fragment of sequence alignment for one class of cII transcription regulators (POG226) is shown. The
sequence family tree built on the basis of complete alignment is shown at the bottom right corner, and the sub-tree of the
gene-content tree that contain the same set of phages as thesequence family tree is shown at the bottom left corner. Two
pairs of phages, namely, 933W and Stx2I, as well as HK620 and P22, are in discordant positions in the gene content and protein
family trees (indicated by the blue edges in both trees). To reconcile gene content and protein family trees, T-REX suggests a
transfer from 933W to Stx2I and from HK620 to P22 (blue arrows).

does not strongly favor genes with any specific molecular
function. On a more general note, the trends of HGT distribution in phage genomes and in POGs that we
observed appear to be in agreement with our earlier
results on phage-host gene transfer [2] and with the same
trend in gene families and in several groups of Bacteria
and Archaea [20,23], in that such distributions tend to be
fat-tailed: that is, most genes in most genomes have been
horizontally transferred only rarely, but a smaller proportion of genes have been transferred many times. These
processes result in a large absolute number of HGT and

simultaneously in a large proportion of gene families that
are free of HGT.
The HGT between phages is more common within
groups, with only 4 groups with repeated between-group
transfers detected in our analysis (Figure 1 and Table S3).
Interestingly, the phages most active as gene donors and
those most active as gene recipients are not always the
same, with only 7 phages seen in both these categories.
The leaders in a number of transfers in both directions are
Group 14, which consists of T4-like myoviruses with large

Biology Direct 2007, 2:36

genomes, and Group 12, consisting of P22-like podoviruses.
The observation of the high rate of the within-group gene
transfer and low rate of between-group transfer begs the
question of whether the phage groups in the gene-content
trees are in the first place defined by vertical inheritance,
or are the artifacts of HGT. To distinguish between these
two possibilities, we excluded from our dataset all POGs
which were transferred at least once (229 POGs) and used
the remaining 594 POGs to infer the genome tree again.
This step did not lead to radical changes in the clades of
the tree, but two types of differences were observed. First,
a minority of the phage groups described earlier (four
groups out of eighteen) lost one or two members. Second,
the average statistical support for 18 groups decreased
somewhat, from 73.5% to still considerable 63.4%, with
the bootstrap values falling below 30% in four groups and
actually increasing in three of them. There was no strong
correlation between the change in support and either the
frequency of the HGT events involving the members of
the group or the ICTV approval status of the group (Table
S5, available as Additional File 1). These observations
indicate that the inferred HGT events, frequent as they
may be in the absolute terms, are nevertheless not so frequent as to obscure the pattern of vertical, divergent evolution of phage genomes, at least among the groups
defined in this study.
The plausibility of reconstructing evolutionary history
and of building evolutionary classification of bacteriophages has been drawn into question, and it has been
proposed to retain hierarchical structure at the higher levels of phage classification, where "domains" correspond
to distinct lineages of phages with different forms of
genetic material, and "divisions" group together those
phages that exhibit little or no evidence for genetic
exchange with other divisions. At a more shallow level, it
has been proposed to establish various "modi", and a
phage to simultaneously belong to more than one modus
[26]. This framework explicitly recognized HGT and the
ensuing reticulate relationships between phages, but it did
not offer the consistent way of deriving the modi in the
first place, and did not answer the evolutionary question
about the set of past events explaining the makeup of the
observed phage genomes. In the current study, we proposed the algorithmic approach that is suitable for
answering these questions. At the same time, we defer the
issues of phage nomenclature and taxonomy to a later
time – essential as these questions are, they may be better
addressed after we define the evolutionary relationships
and natural groups that have to be properly named.
We used patterns of gene content conservation in phage
genomes to investigate their evolutionary history, by first

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

constraining the relationship graph to a tree-like topology
and detecting well-supported groups of phages, which
come close to the ICTV phage taxonomy at the genus
level, and then augmenting this inference with analysis of
several hundred of the sequence-based trees of individual
gene families. In contrast to the study of Rohwer and
Edwards, which used gene content to infer reticulationfree phylogeny [7], our approach is to exploit the discordance between the topologies of phage genome trees and
protein family trees and to infer the recombination events
between phage lineages on the basis of this discordance.
The main shortcoming of our approach is that it does not
resolve the deep clades of phage phylogeny – the problem
that is also encountered in phylogenetic studies of the
anciently divergent cellular organisms [5,6].
A note of caution is also due with regards to the HGT rates
determined by T-REX. Our attempt at quantification of
the HGT events may suffer from several confounding
problems, some of which lead to overestimation, and
other to underestimation of the HGT rate. The former type
of problems may have to do with statistical errors in tree
inference, when difference between tree topologies is
interpreted as HGT, even though one or both nodes in
question have insufficient statistical support (note that,
on the other hand, comparing only well-supported nodes
may result in underestimated HGT rate). Overestimation
of HGT is also likely to occur as the size of subtrees under
comparison grows, as there may be more low-cost HGT
scenarios in small trees than in large ones (see reference
27 for a recent discussion of related algorithmic issues).
We feel, however, that these effects may be overwhelmed
by the opposite trends that lead to underestimation of the
number of HGT events. Indeed, an ORF has to be found
in more than three genomes in order for our method to
work in the first place, which removes from consideration
small POGs. Moreover, the phylogenetic signal may be
low in the gene-content subtrees because of insufficient
number of characters and parallel loss of characters, and
in sequence family trees because of rapid sequence evolution and/or mutational saturation. Finally, gene
exchanges between two nearest neighbors in the tree are
ignored by all existing methods of HGT inference [28].
The observation of the one-tailed distributions of HGT
events in phage genomes and in POGs appears to agree
with the data on genomes of cellular prokaryotes
[20,23,24] as well as more qualitative observations for different subsets of bacteriophages [25,29]. It means that
most genes have been horizontally transferred either once
or never, and only a relatively small proportion of genes
have been transferred many times. Note that the latter
small proportion nevertheless in itself may be a large
number, if the total number of genes in the sample is itself
large, as is the case here and everywhere in comparative

genomics. Though different techniques of HGT detection
may give different estimates of the absolute number of
HGTs, we there have not been any evidence for other types
of distribution for viral or bacterial HGTs in the literature
(e.g., that it is uniform, or that it has a theoretical, as
opposed to sample, mean). We believe that these observations can help us move away from the extreme views on
HGT role in the evolution of life and to bring about a
more balanced view, in which large absolute number of
genes horizontally transferred at some point in their history may be high, and the proportion of gene families that
show evidence of HGT may be relatively low at the same
time, perhaps just enough to make phylogenetic inference
worth the effort.

Conclusion
Notwithstanding the statistical and algorithmic problems,
the observed cases of gene transfer between phages do not
amount to the erasure of the historic record: considerable
signal of vertical inheritance can be still recovered by analysis of appropriately chosen molecular characters. As of
this writing, the genomes of more than 300 dsDNA
phages, infecting an increasingly diverse collection of
prokaryotic hosts, are available. Recent analysis of
sequences accumulated in public databases has indicated
that combining many molecular characters significantly
improves support for nodes in large trees of cellular
organisms, with good tolerance of uneven sampling and
missing data [30]. We expect that this growth of phage
genome databases, in conjunction with methodological
improvements of HGT detection, will provide for more
and more accurate reconstruction of evolutionary history
of bacteriophages.

Methods
The POG resource
Detailed description of POG construction and analysis of
the POG database has been published [2]. Here, we summarize the procedure and note some of the relevant properties of the POG resources. For each of the 164 phage
genomes included in the initial analysis, we predicted
ORFs de novo with the GeneMarkHMM and GeneMarkS
programs [31,32], using the codon frequency model for
the best-known bacterial host, and then replacing it with
the codon frequency information derived from the verified ORFs. We detected 94 predicted ORFs missed by the
original GeneBank submissions; for 80 of them,
homologs were found in the NCBI database. The nucleotide sequence of each phage genome was also searched
using the TBLASTN program [33]. We estimate that ≥ 95%
of all ORFs coding for proteins larger than 5 kDa have
been found [2], though the exact position of the start and
stop codons in a small subset of ORFs may have be
defined imprecisely (LJ and AM, unpublished observations). Multidomain proteins were split into individual

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

domains using the HHsearch program [34]. We made allagainst-all sequence comparison of the resulting mix of
proteins and domains using the gapped BLASTP program
[33]. Symmetric best matches, or SymBeTs, were recorded,
and the COGMAKER package, which is the implementation of the original COGNITOR algorithm [35], was used
to produce orthologous groups of genes by first recovering
the triplets of SymBeTs in three genomes (one gene in
each genome) and then merging all triangles with shared
sides [8]. Unlike the NCBI COG resource, in which each
SymBeTs have to occur between proteins sequences from
two evolutionarily distant lineages, we treated every phage
as a distinct lineage, which resulted in a moderate overrepresentation of small POGs and inflated POG coverage
of genomes that had closely similar strains in the database
[2]. The properties of these distribution tails, however,
have a minor impact on the results (GG, JL, and AM,
unpublished observations). We checked whether pairs of
paralogous POGs would be merged if all sequences in the
NCBI NR database were also considered, and found no
such cases. Over one-third of the total (339 POGs) are
found in 3 phage genomes. Approximately 60% of the
POGs are present in 4 to 14 phage genomes, with the average number of members per POG of 6. Almost 90% of the
POGs contain one representative per phage, i.e., no inparalogs.
Calculation of intergenome distances
Presences and absences of POGs in each phage genome
were coded as binary vectors in the form Xi =
(xi1,.xi2,...,xiN), where i = 1,...,M, and j = 1,...,N, and M and
N are, respectively, the number of POGs (M = 803) and
the number of phage genomes (N = 158; the total number
of phage genomes we started with was 164, but six
genomes did not contain genes with high phageness value
that were conserved in at least two other phage genomes).
We analyzed generalized average distance measure dAλ
with different exponents [36], as well as a measure based
on Pearson correlation, to select optimal way to estimate
evolutionary distances for our data set. The distance with
exponent λ = 8 was selected on the basis of the extreme
values of skewness and kurtosis: as discussed in reference
36, these values tend to be good predictors of the accuracy
of the clustering solution, even though the general theory
of the choice of distance measure in clustering problems
is still unavailable. Several other measures, including the
one based on correlation coefficient, gave nearly identical
NJ trees (not shown).
Construction of gene-content trees
The neighbor-joining trees were inferred based on the
intergenomic distances dA∞ using the NEIGHBOR program of the PHYLIP package [37]. The statistical support
for internal nodes was obtained with the delete-jackknife
method [38], by randomly selecting 90% of the sample

data and recalculating trees over 100 replications [39]. For
Bayesian inference, we used MrBayes v.3.1.2 [40], with
gamma rate distribution estimated from the data set, one
cold and three incrementally heated chains run for
2,000,000 generations with random starting trees, and the
temperature parameter value of 0.2. Trees were sampled
every 100 generations and 10000 initial trees were burnt
in.
Construction of protein sequence family trees
We constructed alignments of sequences from 450 POGs
that included protein sequences from four or more phages
using the ClustalW program [41]. Four is the minimal
number of leaves on the tree that can be processed by our
algorithm, which requires midpoint rooting (see below).
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using NJ algorithm and
PC gamma distance with α = 2.25. This protein distance
measure corresponds to Dayhoff model of amino acids
substitutions and is very close to the popular JTT model
that has PC gamma distance with α = 2.4 [42].
Detection of horizontal gene transfers: the new version of
the T-REX algorithm
For this study, we developed a new version of the T-Rex
algorithm [43,44], which is described in this section and,
in more detail, in Additional File 3. A protein sequence
family tree Tsf is a tree inferred from alignment of protein
sequences that belong to a POG. This tree has n leaves that
are labeled by the set of n bacteriophages, where n is much
less than the total number of phages included in the analysis (the average numbers of genes in 450 POGs that contain 4 or more species is 6). We also reduce the 158-taxa
gene-content tree, such as the one given in Figure 1, to a
smaller tree Tgc, containing only the leaves labeled by the
set of the same n phages, by removing from it 158-n lineages corresponding to the organisms missing from the
sequence family tree. Both gene-content and sequence
family trees are then rooted by midpoint in order to take
into account the timing constraints (See Supplementary
Text). If there exist identical sub-trees with two or more
leaves belonging to both Tgc and Tsf, we reduce the size of
the problem by contracting these sub-trees, replacing
them with the same auxiliary node in both Tgc and Tsf, and
preserving this replacement throughout the computation
(i.e., assuming that the branches of these sub-trees will
not be involved in the HGT operations). All possible
directed transformations consisting of standard Sub-tree
Pruning and Regrafting (SPR), are evaluated in a way that
the value of a selected optimization criterion (in our case,
Robinson-Foulds distance – reference 45) between the
transformed species tree and the gene tree is computed.
The algorithm proceeds iteratively by testing all possible
SPR operations (i.e., HGTs) between pairs of branches in
the gene-content tree Tk-1 (T0= Tgc at iteration 1 or transformed tree at the following iterations) except the trans-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

fers between adjacent branches and those violating the
constraints (see Supplementary Text). After the SPR operation is selected, the size of the problem is reduced further
by contracting the newly-formed sub-tree in the transformed gene-content tree Tk and the sequence family tree
Tsf. In the list of the obtained HGTs, the idle transfers, i.e.,
those whose removal does not change the topology of Tk,
are identified and eliminated. The procedure is repeated
until the distance between the transformed gene-content
tree Tk and the sequence family tree Tsf equals zero or if no
more HGTs can be generated due to the violation of the
timing constraints (see Supplementary Text). The computation requires O(kn4) operations to generate k transfers in
a phylogenetic tree with n leaves. However, because of the
progressive size reduction of the gene-content and
sequence family trees, the practical time complexity of this
algorithm is O(kn3).

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: Eugene Koonin, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine,
National Institutes of Health
This is an attempt on a full-scale phylogeny and phylogenetic taxonomy of dsDNA tailed phages, apparently, the
largest class of "organisms" (or "biological agents" if
viruses cannot be called organisms) on earth. So the
importance of this paper needs no additional emphasis.

My main concern with the current version of the paper is
that the gene-content tree is not really a phylogenetic tree
(as pointed out in ref. 5 of this paper but more fully explicated in Wolf et al. 2002. Trends Genet.18(9):472–9). At
best, it can be viewed as a phylogenetic tree in which LBAtype artifacts are inevitable and their source is obvious,
i.e., species that have convergently lost similar subsets of
genes will form false "clades", and to some extent, the
same might happen with species that have convergently
gained similar sets of genes. This problem is not at all
addressed in the current version of the paper, and I think
this needs to be rectified.

Authors' response: In gene content-based phylogenetic
inference, proper normalization/weighting of the
average number of shared genes appears to be an effective way of countering the "genome size attraction"
artifact (for earlier discussion, see, for example, ref. 24
in this manuscript, or reviewer's own B. Mirkin and E.
Koonin (2003) in M. Janowitz, J.-F. Lapointe, F.
McMorris, B. Mirkin, and F. Roberts (Eds.) Bioconsensus, DIMACS Series, V. 61, Providence: AMS, 97–112).
There is no general solution of the average weighting
problem yet, but we think that the use of parametric
family that we have proposed in ref. 36 is a sensible
starting point in dealing with convergent gene losses
(note that one of the examples in that study is phylogenetic inference from gene content in proteobacteria,
which appears to be free of "small genome attraction"
when the value of the exponent is chosen on the basis
of analysis of pairwise distance distributions).
As to convergent gains of genes, we think that, in order
for this process to induce the artefacts in our approach,
these will have to be gains from the hosts (as phagephage gene donations are dealt with explicitly at the
second step of the analysis), and these gains will have
to involve POGs with high phageness (as low-phageness POGs are not considered). These two requirements appear to work against each other. Moreover,
weighting the average number of shared genes helps in
this case, too.
As an aside, we feel that J.A. Lake and M.C. Rivera may
have been onto something when they suggested (Mol
Biol Evol. 2004, 21:681–690) that gene-content artifacts may be more akin to the composition effects in
sequence comparison than to LBA artifacts.
The analysis of putative HGT events using updated T-Rex
is, certainly, of interest and value. The results of this part
are unexpected (at least, to me) in that there is rather little
HGT. I am wondering whether there might be some
source of systematic underestimate – perhaps, it has
something to do with using the gene-content tree as the
species tree?
Authors' response: The discussion of the HGT rates was
perhaps too brief in the original version. In response
to this comment, as well as the opposite concern of
Nicolas Galtier (i.e., about possible overestimation of
HGT rates), we expanded it, and we also discussed a
broader context of these observations at the end of the
revised manuscript.
The authors indicate that the detectable HGT does not
amount to erasure of the vertical phylogenetic signal. I
accept this for individual clades but I am wondering about

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

the deep branches which, as the authors rightly note, are
poorly resolved. Could it be that at that evolutionary
depth the amount of HGT was such that it does indeed
obliterate whatever vertical signal might have been there?
Authors' response: We agree with the reviewer that the
loss of vertical signal is more likely for the deep
branches of the tree. We also agree that the question
should be decided on the clade-by-clade basis: if we
improve our science and some deep branches become
better resolved, we will care about it – even if other
parts of evolutionary history continue to be unresolved (or even turn out to be non-resolvable).
I have a suggestion on a potential extra figure, one that
would show the network of inferred HGT events between
different phages groups.
Authors' response: A good way of drawing reticulated
trees is still an open problem. For now, this information is present in the Additional File 1 in a tabular
form.
Finally, this paper has a taxonomic component on which
I do not feel competent to comment. I am sure those
working directly on phage taxonomy will have something
to say.
Authors' response: We hope so too: though none of the
contacted members of the International Committee
for the Taxonomy of Viruses was available for a regular
review, we will try to communicate with them and
seek feedback, perhaps in the form of comments at the
Biology Direct website.
Reviewer 2: Nicolas Galtier, CNRS-Université Montpellier
II
This paper examines the gene content of 158 doublestranded DNA phage genomes in a phylogenetic way, thus
defining groups of related phages. Some groups are in
agreement with the existing taxonomy, some are new and
provide unsuspected links between morphologically
divergent phages. It is argued that horizontal gene transfers (HGT) between phages, detected by comparing individual gene trees to the gene-content tree, are not frequent
enough to remove the phylogenetic signal due to vertical
inheritance.

I think that clarifying the taxonomy and evolutionary
mode of DNA phages is a sensible goal, and that this article addresses the problem in an appropriate way. I cannot
really tell how novel this contribution is given my limited
knowledge of the bibliography in this field, but as an
external I liked reading the paper. I particularly appreciate
the idea of detecting HGT by comparing gene trees to a

gene-content tree, i.e. two independent sources of information. I have a number of technical or conceptual comments.
- I would suggest to present in this manuscript the method
by which Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs) are defined.
This step is critical. The reader should be able to appreciate its validity without reading the Liu et al 2006 paper.
Authors' response: We included a short description of
the POG construction and moved much of technical
information from the supplementary files into the
main text.
- I was a bit surprised that only 150 genomes were analysed, when 300 are currently available. 150 is not much
more than the 102 analysed by Rohwer and Edwards in
2002. "Before 2005" is an old date in the rapidly evolving
field of genomics. Since one aspect of this paper is to provide a molecular taxonomic update, I think that the study
would benefit from using all the available data.
Authors' response: There is no doubt that the more
genomes the better, as mentioned in the Discussion.
For various non-scientific reasons, we had to make a
choice between updating the POG collection and
working on phylogenetic inference, and we chose the
latter. We are now working on a major update of the
dataset. For the record, the number of genomes in this
study is twice as large as the dsDNA subset of the
genome collection used by Rohwer and Edwards
(their decision to include phages with RNA genomes
does not strike us as sound, but we may consider
phages with ssDNA in the future analysis).
- I found the bibliography a bit lacking. In the very first
paragraph, it might be useful to redirect the reader
towards references illustrating the biological importance
of phages. More importantly, the debate about the influence of HGT in phylogenomics, and especially bacterial
phylogenomics, is not covered (eg Gogarten et al 2002
Mol Biol Evol 9:2226, Daubin et al 2003 Science 301:829,
Lerat et al 2003 PLoS 1:19, Bapteste et al 2005 BMC Evol
Biol 5:33, Galtier 2007 Syst Biol 56:633). I think that the
comparison between the bacterial and phage situations
would be worth making. The bacterial literature focuses
on conflicts between gene trees, whereas your approach
relies on the gene-content tree. Finally, the bibliography
of gene-content trees could be discussed: is this a wellaccepted approach, was it validated is other taxonomic
groups?
Authors' response: Our discussion of HGT is expanded,
with many new references – some of those proposed
by the reviewer, as well as a few others. On a more gen-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

eral note, we feel that the debate of HGT in phylogenomics should focus more on the quantitative
detection of the actual events than on sweeping metaphors ("promiscuous gene exchange" vs. "formidable
barriers", etc.), and hope that our study will contribute
to this change of tone, just as many of those newly
included references strive to do.
- Any conflict between gene trees and the gene-content
tree is interpreted as a HGT event. Given the high turnover of genes in DNA phages (most POGs are restricted to
few phages), isn't it more plausible to interpret a conflict
as resulting from several independent acquisitions of the
gene (from the same host, or related hosts) in distinct
phage lineages?
Authors' response: A similar question was raised by
Eugene Koonin – see our response to his comments
above.
- As far as I understood the modified T-Rex algorithm,
every topological conflict between a gene tree and the
gene-content tree is interpreted as a HGT event, irrespective of the statistical support for internal branches. I think
this will tend to produce an excess of detected HGT in case
of poor resolution – two trees can differ by chance in the
absence of HGT when the amount of information is low –
but the text says more or less the opposite. Is it possible to
include only well-supported internal edges in the modified T-rex algorithm? The supplementary method section
introduces bootstrap support for HGT, but the main text
does not mention it.
Authors' response: We were more concerned by underestimation of HGT rates than by their overestimation –
therefore the sources of the former were initially discussed in the text in more detail than the sources of the
latter. We now expanded the list of "what can go
wrong". We agree that this is worth of further investigation, and we are still experimenting with the most
appropriate way of using bootstrap analysis for this
purpose.
How were irresolutions in the gene-content tree (e.g. a
star-like group), if any, dealt with?
Authors' response: We did not encounter star-like
groups in the gene content tree.
- I think we lack information about the power of the HGT
detection approach, because we lack information about
the overlap between POGs. Consider a group of phages
that would share one or several POGs, but would be
involved in no other POG. This group would be well-supported in the gene-content tree, but unfalsifiable through

Page 11 of 14

Biology Direct 2007, 2:36

gene-content tree/gene tree comparison, the gene-content
subtree being unresolved (this depends on the answer to
the previous comment, though). Is there a way to give an
idea of how many gene-content groups are corroborated
(not just "not contradicted") by gene trees?
Authors' response: Since the answer to the previous
question is "no well-supported but unresolved subtrees", there remains only the question of the proper
"support index", i.e., how many sequence-family trees
support each gene-content subtree. We experimented
with this index, which can be derived by comparing
the number of sequence family trees that give the same
topology as the gene-content tree to the number of
sequence family trees that show any type of HGTs for
a phage genome or for a phage group. The issue here
is that the index has to be simultaneously normalized
for genome sizes and for group sizes. We have not
completed this work yet.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/36

Authors' response: In effect, we are already estimating
the maximal number of possible HGT events on each
gene-content subtree defined by a given sequencefamily tree: we do not use any threshold for accepting
HGTs, so each of these inferred events is reported. A
better way to estimate the HGT rate may be to use a
bootstrap scheme (cf. response to Nicolas Galtier's
comment). We outlined one such scheme in the supplementary material, but did not use it in this study.
In my opinion the discussion about whether one can
derive species trees from genes in the face of HGT is very
much confounded by arguments that, indeed, when we
search long enough we will likely find that every Orthologous Group has been subject to HGT, but that does not
imply that the major mode of inheritance is not a vertical
one, and that therefore gene-based phylogenies cannot be
derived.
Authors' response: We agree.

Reviewer 3: Martijn Huynen, University of Nijmegen
The paper by Glazko et al presents a gene content
approach to deriving a phylogeny of the double stranded
bacteriophages. As no genes are shared between all double
stranded bacteriophages this appears a sensible approach
to bacteriophage taxonomy that was introduced by
Rohwer and Edwards.

I am not much of a specialist on bacteriophage evolution,
and thus my review will focus more on the technical and
conceptual issues. In general, gene content approaches
can be an alternative to sequence-based trees, although
when ample sequences are available that are shared
between all species compared, the latter approach
includes more information and appears to obtain better
trees. With respect to Bacteriophage evolution I wonder
whether the authors can include more information about
whether this taxonomy is interesting beyond the result
itself: are there phylogenetic clusters that e.g. match with
host preference or other aspects of lifestyle?
Authors' response: There is some correlation between
membership in the same group and overlaps in the
host range. We now mention this, and we also note
that such correlation cannot be explained solely by
gene shuffling in viruses that share hosts (see discussion of HGT and tree built after the omission of horizontally transferred genes).
I very much like the quantitative analyses of the authors
that relates the number of HGT events to the number of
POGs and genomes. Would it be possible to somehow
quantify this further into the maximum number of HGT
events that could be observed? Or, how dominant is vertical inheritance relative to HGT?

The remark that the "COG"-algorithm is more sensitive
than other methods for deriving orthologous groups
because it does not rely on the arbitrary score cut-off, with
the reference to the paper that introduced COGs, and that
uses the same, theoretical argument, is in my view a bit of
a stretch. In absence of golden standards we actually do
not know what is the best way of deriving orthologous
groups, and whether there is actually one way that works
best for all applications. COGs are a sensible approach
and they work fine. Please leave it at that.
Authors' response: If there is a symmetric best match
between two genes in two genomes with the P-value of
0.1 (such a high number may be the consequence of
low sequence similarity), and we apply a method of
ortholog definition that only examines matches with
the P-value of 10-5 or less, such a method would miss
such a pair. In contrast, when top-ranking matches are
used regardless of the score or P-value, the pair will not
be missed. This is our claim, which we think is not
controversial. We agree, however, that the extent of
gain in orthologs when using ranks is not well-examined. It is our sense that in phages, with lots of short,
highly diverged genes, such a gain may be non-trivial,
but we agree that a quantitative study is in order. For
the time being, we have toned the rhetoric down.
The authors do mention the problem of parallel gene loss
leading to convergence in the gene content trees. One way
to get around that is to make a tree that only considers the
fraction of shared genes (POGs in this case) as a similarity
criterion, rather than one that does also include shared
"absences". This method has been shown to give "better"
trees of bacterial genomes that have undergone parallel

Biology Direct 2007, 2:36

loss of genes, and it might be useful to test whether such
an approach does lead to a radically different tree in this
case.
Authors' response: The distance used for building our
neighbour-joining tree belongs to the parametric family discussed in ref. 36, which possesses exactly this
property (zeroes do not contribute to the distance).

The observation that leaving out likely HGT genes from
the tree actually reduces the bootstrap support, is similar
to what we have seen for Gene Content trees of cellular
species (Dutilh et al., JME 2004) where also removal of
likely HGT genes reduced bootstrap support in the tree.
Authors' response: Indeed. This reference is now
included.
