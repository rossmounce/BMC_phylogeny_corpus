Abstract
Background: Over the past fifteen years, antibiotic resistance in the Gram-positive opportunistic
human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae has significantly increased. Clinical isolates from patients
with community-acquired pneumonia or otitis media often display resistance to two or more
antibiotics. Given the need for new therapeutics, we intend to investigate enzymes of cell wall
biosynthesis as novel drug targets. Alanine racemase, a ubiquitous enzyme among bacteria and
absent in humans, provides the essential cell wall precursor, D-alanine, which forms part of the
tetrapeptide crosslinking the peptidoglycan layer.
Results: The alanine racemases gene from S. pneumoniae (alrSP) was amplified by PCR and cloned
and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 367 amino acid, 39854 Da dimeric enzyme was purified to
electrophoretic homogeneity and preliminary crystals were obtained. Racemic activity was
demonstrated through complementation of an alr auxotroph of E. coli growing on L-alanine. In an
alanine racemases photometric assay, specific activities of 87.0 and 84.8 U mg-1 were determined
for the conversion of D- to L-alanine and L- to D-alanine, respectively.
Conclusion: We have isolated and characterized the alanine racemase gene from the
opportunistic human pathogen S. pneumoniae. The enzyme shows sufficient homology with other
alanine racemases to allow its integration into our ongoing structure-based drug design project.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram positive diplococcus
that colonizes the upper respiratory tract in about 20% of
healthy humans, but is a leading cause of diseases such as
otitis media, bacteremia, lobar pneumonia, and meningitis [1], particularly when enclosed in type-specific polysaccharide capsules. Among the elderly, S. pneumoniae is the

most common cause of fatal community-acquired pneumonia [2], and in children the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonia, middle ear infections
and meningitis [3]. From 1970 to 1990, resistance to S.
pneumoniae has increased significantly, presumably due to
the increased use of antibiotics. The first reports of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains appeared in the US in

the early-1980s [4], then beginning in the 1990s their
share increased from less than 5% of all isolates to approximately 35% in 2002 [5]. Similarly, resistance to macrolides is increasing, with 24% of all isolates being
resistant in 2000 [6]. To further complicate the issue,
multidrug resistance is increasingly present among S.
pneumoniae isolates, documented by a recent study showing 22 % of all isolates to be resistant to at least three antibiotics [7].
In light of this growing resistance problem, the identification and characterization of more potential targets for
antibiotic therapy is of paramount importance. The inhibition of bacterial growth through antibiotics targeting
cell wall biosynthesis has been a proven mode of action
since the beginning of the antibiotic era [8]. While penicillin targets the crosslinking reaction in peptidoglycan
biosynthesis, there are also choices when it comes to
inhibiting the formation of essential precursors for the
peptidoglycan layer. One of those precursors, the amino
acid D-alanine, is an essential component of the tetrapeptide crosslinking the glycan strands. It is provided through
the racemization of the naturally occurring L-alanine, catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzyme alanine racemase (Alr,
EC 5.1.1.1.).
Alr is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate containing enzyme, ubiquitous among most bacteria, and absent in humans. A
lysine residue connected to the PLP cofactor by an internal
aldimine bond acts as a base for the conversion of D-to Lalanine while a nearby tyrosine from the second monomer acts as a base for the abstraction of a hydrogen from
L-alanine [9]. We have determined crystal structures of
alanine racemases from other human pathogens in the
past. Notably, the enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been resolved at high
resolution [10,11]. Both enzymes are dimers with a similar domain makeup and include both an α/β-barrel at the
N-terminus and a C-terminus primarily made of βstrands. Because the active site of Alr is small we are interested in identifying conserved residues that regulate the
entrance of the substrate into the substrate binding pocket
[11] with the goal of developing compounds to control
access of substrate to the active site.
This paper describes the molecular cloning, expression,
purification, and elucidation of the biochemical properties of the alanine racemase from S. pneumoniae. We show
evidence that the alrSP gene encodes a functional alanine
racemase through complementation of an E. coli Dalanine auxotroph, and through a specific spectrophotometric assay. We have obtained preliminary crystals of S.
pneumoniae Alr, and intend to incorporate the enzyme
into our ongoing structure-based drug design program
[12,13]. Determining the structure of AlrSP is an essential

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/40

prerequisite for the development of an accurate pharmacophore model of the enzyme. Using our structure will
allow us to conduct molecular dynamics simulations to
obtain information about the different conformations of
the enzyme (and its substrate), eventually yielding a
dynamic pharmacophore model. Using in silico methods,
compounds from the Available Chemicals Directory [14]
that fit the pharmacophore model will be identified and
submitted to experimental testing, first in vitro and subsequently in vivo. Proof of principle has been provided by
our collaborators at the University of Houston for the
alanine racemase from G. stearothermophilus [15].

Results and discussion
Amplification and cloning of the S. pneumoniae alr gene
The putative open reading frame for the alanine racemase
from S. pneumoniae was identified through sequence comparison between known alanine racemase sequences and
the S. pneumoniae sequences deposited in GenBank. There
was only one unambiguous hit in the database (data not
shown), suggesting that S. pneumoniae, unlike E. coli or P.
aeruginosa, contains only one alanine racemase. The second alanine racemase (DadX) when present is commonly
part of an operon. The S. pneumoniae genome carries only
this single gene, not apparently in an operon, and thus is
lacking the L-alanine inducible catabolic DadX alanine
racemase. Using primers homologous to the 5' and 3' end
of the putative alrSP an 1103 bp fragment was amplified
and subsequently sequenced. The orf encodes a polypeptide of 367 amino acids with a calculated molecular
weight of 39854 Daltons. Using the restriction sites incorporated into the PCR primers the gene was ligated into the
expression vector gene pET17 and cloned in E. coli
MB1547.
Sequence analysis of Alr
Comparison and analysis of the protein sequence
encoded by alrsp from strain R800 revealed full identity
with the protein sequences from strains R6 (GenBank
accession number: P0A2W9) and TIGR4 (GenBank accession number: AAK75776). Moreover, it displayed a high
level of similarity with other alanine racemases (Fig. 1),
and carried the expected motifs such as the characteristic
pyridoxal phosphate binding site (VVKANAYGHG) near
the N-terminus, and the two catalytic amino acid residues
(K40, Y263) of the active center [11]. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) revealed no surprises; the enzyme is clustered
with other Streptococci species, such as S. mutans or S. pyogenes. These sequences, together with other alanine racemases from Gram-positive bacteria appear to occupy one
half of the phylogenetic tree, while the Gram-negative
bacteria occupy the other half.

Since both alanine racemase and certain human enzymes,
such as serine racemase [16] depend on pyridoxal-5'phos-

phate (PLP) as their co-factor, it is important that antibiotic design efforts aim to develop inhibitors that are
specific for the bacterial enzyme. However, it is worth noting that, in the case of serine racemase and AlrSP both
enzymes are indeed significantly distinct. The two racemases are only 13% identical on the amino acid level, so
while they both may still be inhibited by the same small
molecule, there is significant diversity between the
enzymes, making it more likely that a potential inhibitor
will actually be alanine racemase specific. In addition, our
drug design efforts extend well beyond the PLP binding
site of the enzyme. As shown in our previous publication
[11], alanine racemases are characterized by a geometrically distinct entryway to the active site that is made up of
eight highly conserved amino acid residues. This entryway
is fully conserved in the AlrSP sequence; residues Y253,
Y352, Y282 and A169 form the inner layer, while residues
R307, I350, R288 and A170 constitute the middle layer.
Sequence analysis of the human serine racemase fails to
identify those conserved residues. We thus hypothesize

that an inhibitor designed to block the entryway would
specifically inhibit the bacterial target, alanine racemase,
and be much less likely to cross-react with eukaryotic PLPcontaining enzymes.
Complementation analysis
In vivo demonstration that the gene product expressed
alanine racemase activity was shown by complementation. The D-alanine auxotrophic E. coli strain MB2795 was
transformed with pET17-alrSP. A plasmid encoding the
cloned P. aeruginosa DadX alanine racemase, pMB1921
was used as a positive control. pET17 without insert
served as a negative control. Cells were plated on LB
medium with and without D-alanine supplementation,
and scored for colony growth after 16 h at 37°C. The
alanine racemase gene from S. pneumoniae fully restored
the wild-type phenotype, as did the P. aeruginosa dadX
plasmid. Cells transformed with pET17 failed to grow.
Thus the cloned S. pneumoniae gene encodes a functional
alanine racemase.

Some recent data suggested that alanine racemases are
either monomeric or dimeric [18]. Initially, molecular
sieve chromatography was used to answer this question
for AlrSP. The molecular weight of five protein standards
was plotted versus the ratio of their elution volume to the
void volume of the column to yield a linear calibration
curve. This curve was then used to determine an apparent
molecular weight of 80000 Daltons for AlrSP, a value suggesting a dimeric state for the enzyme. In order to further
classify AlrSP we additionally performed dynamic light
scattering using the Superdex purified enzyme. When
tested at 1.8 mg/ml we observed a single peak with a
hydrodynamic radius of 3.7 nm and a monodisperse profile. This radius corresponds to a molecular weight of
71000 Daltons, clearly suggesting that in solution the
dominant form of AlrSP is the dimer. Even at lower concentrations of protein, we were not able to see any evidence for AlrSP monomers, nor did we observe any mixed
populations of monomers and dimers in the same preparation. As a result we conclude that this enzyme belongs
to the majority of alanine racemases that form dimers, as
do the enzymes from M. tuberculosis [11] and P. aeruginosa
[19].
Preliminary crystallization
Preliminary crystals for AlrSP were obtained using a sparse
matrix crystallization approach [20]. Initial crystals were
obtained in 1.4 M NaCitrate, 0.1 M Hepes, pH7.5. This
condition was successively modified and better crystals of
0.25 × 0.25 × 0.1 mm were eventually obtained in 1.2 M
NaCitrate, 0.1 M MES, pH7.2, 10% glycerol (Fig. 4). Data
analysis using X-ray crystallography is underway.

Conclusion
Overexpression, purification and biochemical
characterization
The recombinant pET17-alrSP plasmid was transformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3), pLysS, and expressed upon induction of T7 polymerase. The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as summarized in Table 1.
Purified enzyme was obtained in an overall yield of 28.7%
and exhibited a 12.9 fold increase in specific activity over
the crude lysate. The molecular mass of the purified protein, estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis, was approximately
39 kDa, in line with the calculated value for the alrSP open
reading frame (Fig. 3). The kinetic properties of the purified S. pneumoniae enzyme are similar to other alanine
racemases, it has a Km for D-alanine at 23°C of 2.10 mM
and for L-alanine of 1.92 mM. The Vmax for the racemization (D- to L-alanine and L- to D-alanine) is 87.0 and 84.8
U mg-1, respectively, where one unit was defined as the
amount of enzyme that catalyzed racemization of 1 μmol
of substrate per minute. These values were used to calculate a Keq of 1.07 for this reaction, thus fulfilling the criterion (Keq~1.0) for a chemically symmetric reaction [17].

We have isolated the gene encoding alanine racemase
from S. pneumoniae and obtained high level heterologous
expression in E. coli as a dimer of 80 kda. Sequence
homology, complementation of a D-alanine auxotroph,
and a specific spectrophotometric enzyme assay confirm
the identity of the cloned protein. With the recent acquisition of protein crystals described here, and the homology with other known alanine racemases whose structures
are available, we anticipate the structure of this enzyme
should soon be available, allowing it to be integrated into
our ongoing structure-based drug design project.

expression of the alr gene from S. pneumoniae. pMB1921,
expressing the alanine racemase (DadX) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22], was used as a positive control in
the complementation experiments. All cells were routinely grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. E.

inspection.

Protein expression and purification
E. coli BL21(DE3), harboring pET17-alrSP pLysS was
grown, induced and harvested as described [22]. The cell
pellet from 6 l of culture was initially suspended in 90 ml
20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8, 0.5 mM pyridoxal phosphate. After
sonication (6 × 50 W for 20 sec) and centrifugation (JA20,
27000 × g, 25 min), ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4))
was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of
20% saturation. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation (as above), and (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 60% saturation. After
centrifugation (as above) the pellet was suspended in 35
ml 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8, dialyzed against 20 mM TrisHCl, pH8, and purified over a Q-Sepharose High Performance column (GE Amersham) using a 0–1 M NaCl gradient in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8. The peak fractions were
pooled, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 1 M, and the sample was
further purified through HiPrep Phenyl (low sub) hydrophobic interaction chromatography (GE Amersham)
using a 1-0 M (NH4)2SO4 gradient. The peak fractions
were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8, concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Prep Grade column (GE Amersham) for the final purification step and
peak fractions were pooled and retained.

Sequence Accession Numbers
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ALRSP have
been submitted to GenBank under Accession Nos.
AF171873 and AAD51027, respectively.

Enzyme assay, characterization, and protein
determination
Throughout the purification quantity and quality of the
preparation were monitored by assaying protein concentration [31] and enzyme activity [22]. The purification
was further monitored using SDS-PAGE on a GE-Amersham PHAST gel system. The molecular weight of the
native enzyme was estimated by comparing its migration
on the Superdex 200 column with five protein standards
(12–200 kDa) from the Sigma MWGF200 standards kit.
Dynamic light scattering of a 1 mg/ml sample of AlrSP was
done at 20°C using the DynaPro Titan system according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Wyatt Technology).
Prior to the measurements, all samples were spun in an
Eppendorf 5415 tabletop centrifuge and then filtered
through a 0.02 micron Whatman Anotop filter in order to
remove aggregates prior to measurement of light scattering data.

Crystallization
AlrSP was crystallized at a concentration of 21 mg/ml using
the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. 1 μl of protein
and 1 μl of mother liquor were automatically mixed in a
96 well plate using the Honeybee 961 crystallization
robot (Genomic Solutions). Each plate was set up at 4°C
with the 96 conditions of the Crystal Screen HR2-130 kit
