Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) emerged following cross-species transmission of
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from sooty mangabeys to humans several decades ago. The
epidemic groups of HIV-2 have been established in the human population for at least 50 years.
However, it is likely that new divergent SIVs can infect humans and lead to new outbreaks. We
report the isolation of a new strain of HIV-2, HIV2-NWK08F, from an immunodeficient Sierra
Leone immigrant. Health care providers in Sierra Leone and elsewhere need to be alerted that a
subtype of HIV-2, which is not detected by PCR for epidemic HIV-2 strains, exists and can lead to
immunosuppression.

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 2
(HIV-2) is endemic in some countries of West Africa.
Unlike infection with HIV type 1 (HIV-1), this infection
has not appreciably spread beyond this area. The incidence of HIV-2 infection has even declined over the last
16–20 years [1,2]. The majority of human infections are
caused by groups A or B, which have been referred to as
the epidemic groups. The rate of progression to acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for the epidemic
strains is not well defined[3]. However, variation in envelope during infection is similar to that seen in HIV-1[4].
Infections with non-epidemic subtypes (C-G) are known
only as single person infections and available evidence
indicates that infection did not lead to immune suppression[5]. The one noted exception is a group H virus, which

caused immunodeficiency in a man from the Ivory
Coast[6].
Sixteen years ago, infection with HIV-2 Group F was
described in one individual from the northern province of
Sierra Leone[7]. HIV-2 Group E was also found in a single
person originating from Sierra Leone and was reported 18
years ago[5]. Virus was not isolated from either person,
despite repeated attempts. Both individuals were healthy
during the time of observation. Here we present evidence
that a Group F virus isolated in 2008 appears to be a newly
emerging HIV-2 group. The virus, HIV-2-NWK-08F, was
isolated from a man with CD4 T-cell lymphopenia.
Patient X is a 68 year old male from Freetown, Sierra
Leone. Patient X immigrated to the New Jersey, USA. in

2007. During the immigration process, he tested positive
for antibodies against HIV. He was referred to the Peter
Ho Memorial Clinic in Newark, New Jersey for follow-up
and treatment in early 2008. Patient X's serum was repeatedly reactive by serological testing with ELISA kits containing HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens. The western blot for
HIV-1 was negative. His HIV-1 viral load was <48 copies
and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV-1 proviral
DNA was negative. An HIV-2 immunoblot was positive.
The presumptive diagnosis was that Patient X had an HIV2 infection. However, a PCR assay from a commercial laboratory for HIV-2 proviral DNA was negative (LabCorp,
Research Triangle Park, NC). This result suggested one of
two possibilities:

Patient X had a CD4 T-cell count of 338 cells/μl and a
CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.52. This CD4 T-cell lymphopenia suggested that Patient X was actively infected with a divergent
strain of HIV-2. To determine if Patient X had active infection with a non-epidemic strain, we attempted to isolate
the virus and performed PCR with primers that were used
in our previous study of HIV-2 in Sierra Leone[7]. On four
separate occasions, we co-cultured Patient X's peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with either PHA-stimulated normal donor PBMC (three different donors) or
CEM-x-174 cells. Each culture resulted in virus production
as measured by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) p27
gag EIA (Zeptometrix, Buffalo, NY). Using PCR we amplified env and gag of this provirus with subtype F primers.
To rule out the possibility of PCR contamination, the env
region was independently amplified in two laboratories,
one in Newark, New Jersey and the other in Covington,
Louisiana. The env sequence data were identical. Figure 1
shows the results of a phylogenetic analysis of gag. HIV2NWK08F clusters significantly with six other viruses, all
from Sierra Leone. Two viruses were found in household
pet sooty mangabeys which are native to the region. A
third was HIV-2 subtype E; a fourth was subtype F, from a

1. The proviral load was below the limit of detection of
the assay.
2. The virus was too divergent from known HIV-2 epidemic groups to be amplified by the gag primers based on
epidemic subtype consensus sequence.

woman who lived in the northern province of Sierra
Leone – the same area as the original home of patient X.
Subtype F HIV-2 has not previously been known to cause
immune suppression nor has it been known to be transmitted from person to person. It is not known how patient
X acquired HIV-2-NWK-08F. Patient X denied exposure to
monkeys. He denied ever hunting game. He had no tattoos, no history of needle exposure in Sierra Leone and no
history of blood or blood product transfusion. Patient X
reported only one sexual contact, his wife. No relative was
available for testing. HIV-2-NWK-08F clusters most
closely with HIV-2SL93F and next most closely with the 2
SIVs found in sooty mangabeys in Sierra Leone (Figure 1).
A real time PCR protocol to quantify provirus was developed with env primers and probe. Patient X had a proviral
load equal to 6,100 copies per 106 PBMC.
It is alarming that Patient X's virus was easily isolated and
that his CD4 T-cell count is decreased with an abnormal
CD4:CD8 ratio. Patient X's reported lack of exposure to
pet monkeys or by hunting is also a concern, since it
implies human to human transmission. Two recent studies of HIV-2 infected individuals found the median proviral load to be ~300 copies per 106 PBMC[8,9]. The
proviral load in Patient X was significantly higher, indicating that this virus may have greater pathogenicity than
most HIV-2 isolates. Together, these data suggest that
HIV2-NWK08F is pathogenic and spreading within the
human population. Previous infections with highly divergent strains have been thought to occur after transmission
from monkey to human and represented "dead-end'
infections, resulting in neither disease nor horizontal
transmission.

Furthermore, the commercial assay for establishing the
existence of active infection, namely PCR for HIV-2 proviral DNA, did not detect the provirus of this isolate. This
result, similar to problems with early viral load assays
measuring non-subtype B HIV-1 viremia[10], indicates
that persons infected with this divergent HIV-2 group F
will not be accurately diagnosed. A falsely negative PCR
result may lead clinicians to infer that an individual's
infection is latent or that the antibody tests are false positives.
These data demonstrate that a pathogenic, novel strain of
HIV-2 is circulating, at least, within Sierra Leone. Health
care providers in Sierra Leone and elsewhere need to be
alerted that a strain of HIV-2, which is not detected by
PCR for epidemic HIV-2 strains, exists and can lead to
immunosuppression. Epidemiologic studies are required
to determine the extent of this virus' spread in Sierra
Leone and to other countries.
