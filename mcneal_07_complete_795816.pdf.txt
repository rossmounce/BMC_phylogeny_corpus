Abstract
Background: Plastid genome content and protein sequence are highly conserved across land
plants and their closest algal relatives. Parasitic plants, which obtain some or all of their nutrition
through an attachment to a host plant, are often a striking exception. Heterotrophy can lead to
relaxed constraint on some plastid genes or even total gene loss. We sequenced plastid genomes
of two species in the parasitic genus Cuscuta along with a non-parasitic relative, Ipomoea purpurea,
to investigate changes in the plastid genome that may result from transition to the parasitic lifestyle.
Results: Aside from loss of all ndh genes, Cuscuta exaltata retains photosynthetic and
photorespiratory genes that evolve under strong selective constraint. Cuscuta obtusiflora has
incurred substantially more change to its plastid genome, including loss of all genes for the plastidencoded RNA polymerase. Despite extensive change in gene content and greatly increased rate of
overall nucleotide substitution, C. obtusiflora also retains all photosynthetic and photorespiratory
genes with only one minor exception.
Conclusion: Although Epifagus virginiana, the only other parasitic plant with its plastid genome
sequenced to date, has lost a largely overlapping set of transfer-RNA and ribosomal genes as
Cuscuta, it has lost all genes related to photosynthesis and maintains a set of genes which are among
the most divergent in Cuscuta. Analyses demonstrate photosynthetic genes are under the highest
constraint of any genes within the plastid genomes of Cuscuta, indicating a function involving
RuBisCo and electron transport through photosystems is still the primary reason for retention of
the plastid genome in these species.

Background
Parasitic plants offer excellent opportunities to study
changes in genome evolution that accompany the switch
from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic lifestyle, a transition that has occurred many times over the course of evolution. Within angiosperms, the ability to obtain
nutrition through direct attachment to a host plant has
evolved at least a dozen times [1] with many additional
instances of plants obtaining most or all of their nutrition
through specific mycotrophic fungal interactions [2,3].
While approximately 90% of genes involved in photosynthesis have been transferred to the nuclear genome over
the course of chloroplast evolution since divergence from
free-living cyanobacterial relatives [4], these nuclear genes
are often difficult to study in non-model organisms.
Widespread gene and genome duplication often makes
inference of orthology among nuclear genes difficult, and
rate acceleration in ribosomal loci of some parasitic plants
suggests that the sequences of nuclear genes may be too
divergent to amplify through standard PCR [5]. By contrast, genes remaining on the plastid chromosome evolve
more slowly than nuclear genes and exist as single, readily
identifiable orthologs in each plastome, although the
plastid chromosome itself is in high copy number per
cell [6].
Many species of parasitic plants retain the ability to photosynthesize, and aside from a supplemental connection
to the roots of a host, otherwise resemble fully
autotrophic plants in habit [7]. Others, however, display
increased dependency on their hosts, often to the extent of
becoming fully heterotrophic and nonphotosynthetic.
Such plants are often deemed "holoparasites", and one
such species, Epifagus virginiana (Beechdrops, Orobanchaceae) is the only parasitic plant whose full plastid
genome has been sequenced to date [8]. Its plastid
genome is reduced to less than half the size of that in normal angiosperms due to ubiquitous gene loss, including
all photosynthetic and photorespiratory genes, some
ribosomal protein genes, many tRNA genes, and genes for
plastid-encoded polymerase [8,9]. Despite such drastic
changes, plastid transcription and intron splicing still
occur [9,10], presumably for the purpose of producing the
four remaining proteins not related to transcription or
translation. Smaller scale studies show similar or less
genome reduction in related species [11-14]. For some
holoparasitic lineages, existence of a functional plastid
genome remains to be proven, although preliminary evidence suggests extremely divergent plastid genomes may
occur in the families Balanophoraceae, Cytinaceae, Hydonoraceae, and Cynomoriaceae [15,16].
A large number of studies on plastid function have been
performed involving members of the parasitic genus Cuscuta, derived from within the otherwise autotrophic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/57

Morning Glory Family (Convolvulaceae, order Solanales,
class Asteridae). Plastid ultrastructure and gene content
are quite variable between different taxa [17], and over
150 species exist in this widespread and recognizable
genus [18]. Unlike Epifagus and other root-parasitic
Orobanchaceae, Cuscuta is a twining vine with no roots at
maturity. Instead, it sends its shoot like feeding organs,
haustoria, directly into the stems of its hosts to invade the
vasculature and obtain all necessary water and other nutrients. Leaves are reduced to vestigial scales. Despite an
obligate reliance upon their hosts, many Cuscuta species
show some green color, at least in their inflorescences
and, particularly, in maturing ovules. Machado and Zetsche demonstrated the presence of RuBisCo, chlorophyll,
and low levels of carbon fixation in Cuscuta reflexa, a
member of subgenus Monogyna [19]. Additionally,
although all NADH dehydrogenase (ndh) genes were
either undetectable or nonfunctional [20], other genes
related to photosynthesis appeared to be present in functional form [21]. In this species, green plastids of normal
function are localized to a ring of cells between the stem
pith and cortex that are isolated from atmospheric gas
exchange, indicating photosynthesis may occur in this
species using recycled respiratory CO2 [22] despite an
altered xanthophyll cycle in its light-harvesting
complex [23].
Dot blots using poly-A selected RNA from C. reflexa as a
probe also showed positive hybridization to some of the
101 tobacco genes in tobacco, although whether these
results actually represent nuclear transcribed copies of the
plastid genes, polyadenylated plastid transcripts, or leakage
of non-polyadenylated plastid transcripts through cDNA
production steps is unclear [24]. A different situation exists
in Cuscuta pentagona (subgenus Grammica), which lacks the
ring of photosynthetic cells observed in the stems of C. reflexa, but possesses what appear to be photosynthetically
capable plastids with immunodetectable RuBisCo, photosystem, and light-harvesting proteins in proper locations
within the plastids in green tissues of seedlings and adult
plants [25]. Other species within subgenus Grammica show
a range of rbcL transcript levels, from low to none [17], and
sampled members of this subgenus lack promoters for
plastid-encoded polymerase upstream of the rrn16 and
rbcL genes, although transcription of rbcL still occurs from
nuclear-encoded polymerase promoter sites in both cases
[26]. Conflicting evidence exists for Cuscuta europaea (subgenus Cuscuta), which has been described as lacking chlorophyll and detectable rbcL protein [19], yet still possesses
green color and more typical plastid sequences, including
rbcL, than members of subgenus Grammica [27]. Other
minor changes have been detected in the plastid genome of
Cuscuta sandwichiana, such as deletion of introns within
ycf3, constriction of the inverted repeat to exclude rpl2,
rpl23, and trnI, loss of trnV-UAC, and reduction in size of

ycf2; slight changes to the end of atpB, size reduction of the
trnL intron, and deletion of the rpl2 intron are shared with
other, non-parasitic Convolvulaceae, and occurred before
the evolution of parasitism in Cuscuta [28].
In this study, we test if significant changes to the plastid
genome have occurred prior to the evolution of parasitism, if previously published observations of plastid
genome evolution in Cuscuta apply to other members of
the genus, if differences in chlorophyll content and distribution between Cuscuta species parallel differences in
plastid genome content, whether plastid genes retained in
Cuscuta are still evolving under strong purifying selection,
and whether plastid gene retention and selective constraint suggest a photosynthetic function for plastids in
this parasitic genus. To do so, we sequenced the full plastid genomes of two species of Cuscuta and a close photosynthetic relative, Ipomoea purpurea (Common Morning
Glory). Ipomoea is a member of the Convolvuloideae
clade, which has been shown as the most likely sister
group to Cuscuta in a number of studies [27,29-31]. Cuscuta exaltata, a member of subgenus Monogyna with visible
chlorophyll distributed throughout the stems and inflorescences, and Cuscuta obtusiflora, a member of subgenus
Grammica that usually only exhibits green pigmentation
in inflorescences, fruits, starved seedlings and stressed
stem tips, were chosen to represent Cuscuta. We examined
overall rates of substitution and changes in selective constraint by comparing rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution for all plastid genes and across
functionally defined classes of genes to determine if photosynthetic genes remain the most highly conserved in the
plastid genome and whether relaxation of functional constraint precedes gene losses both before and after the evolution of parasitism in this lineage. We also tested whether
patterns of transfer RNA loss, changes in intergenic
regions, and rates of substitution parallel those seen in the
completely nonphotosynthetic Epifagus virginiana.
Finally, we use the cumulative evidence of photosynthetic
localization, specific gene loss, and strong functional constraint of specific genes to suggest a photosynthetic function of the plastid genome unrelated to the Calvin Cycle
in Cuscuta and perhaps other parasitic plants as well.

Results and Discussion
Plastid Genome Size and Inverted Repeat Structure
The three plastid genomes presented here all have a pair
of large, inverted, identical repeat sequence (IR) separated
from each other by a large single copy and small single
copy region (LSC and SSC) on either end, as is the case for
practically all plant plastid genomes [32]. However, considerable length variation exists between these three plastid genome sequences, with the smallest genome, Cuscuta
obtusiflora, barely half the size of that in Ipomoea purpurea
(85,280 base pairs versus 162,046 bp). Cuscuta exaltata is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/57

intermediate in size at 125,373 bp (See figs. 1, 2, 3). The
plastid genome of Ipomoea is slightly larger than that of
Nicotiana tabacum (155,939 bp), largely through expansion of the IR region into the SSC region (fig. 1). While the
IR of Nicotiana barely extends into ycf1, the IR of Ipomoea
includes the entire ycf1 gene, rps15, ndhH, and a short fragment of the first exon of ndhA. By contrast, the LSC end of
the IR is slightly constricted, not including rpl2 and rpl23
as it does in Nicotiana. Previous estimates of plastid
genome sizes in Convolvulaceae based upon relative size
of restriction fragments using Southern blots with tobacco
plastid fragments as a probe showed a similar, stepwise
trend in plastid genome size reduction from a non-parasite to a member of Cuscuta subgenus Monogyna to various
other species [24]. In that study, a non-parasitic member
Convolvulaceae very closely related to Ipomoea, Convolvulus arvensis, gave a plastid genome size estimate 24 kbp
larger than our Ipomoea purpurea sequence (186 kb vs. 162
kb). The rather large discrepancy could be due to an even
larger increase in the IR size in Convolvulus relative to
tobacco than is seen in Ipomoea, or it could simply reflect
an inability to properly detect IR boundaries using the
rough restriction fragment analysis employed in that
study. Cuscuta reflexa gave a plastid genome size estimate
of 122 kbp in that study, which matches up well with the
125 kb size we sequenced for Cuscuta exaltata, also in subgenus Monogyna. Estimates of other Cuscuta species ranged
from 81 kbp to 104 kbp, although apparent misidentification of some of the species in that study makes further
phylogenetic comparison difficult [33].
Plastid Gene Content
Gene content in Ipomoea is decidedly similar to that in
Nicotiana and Atropa. These three taxa, along with both
Cuscuta species, lack an intact infA [34], indicating this
gene loss probably occurred prior to the divergence of
Solanaceae from Convolvulaceae, both in the order
Solanales. This is not surprising, as infA has been lost from
the plastid many times in angiosperm evolution [35]. A
second gene, ycf15, is lost across Convolvulaceae taxa
sequenced in this study but is present in Solanaceae and
outgroups [34,36,37]. However, the function of this gene
is not known, and the effect of its loss in Convolvulaceae
is difficult to interpret. A third gene, rpl23, is clearly a
pseudogene in Cusucta exaltata and is lost completely in C.
obtusiflora, but it is not clear whether it is functional in Ipomoea. Although a full length open reading frame exists in
Ipomoea for rpl23, it contains two frameshift mutations
and an extension of the 3' end. The gene also does not
appear to be evolving under purifying selective constraint
as in Nicotiana (see fig. 4), further indicating it may be a
pseudogene, although tests of expression will be necessary
to confirm this. Despite being a component of the plastid
translational apparatus, the expendability of this ribosomal protein gene subunit in its plastid location is

supported by its loss from the plastid genome Spinacia as
well [37]. A gene found thus far only in members of
Solanaceae, sprA [34], is not found in any of the
sequenced Convolvulaceae genomes, indicating presence
of this gene in the plastome is restricted to Solanaceae.
One gene that was surprisingly found in all three Convolvulaceae plastid genomes is ycf1, a large gene of unknown
function previously reported as missing in Cuscuta and
three other Convolvulaceae [38]. That study used Southern Blot hybridizations to screen for gene presence; ycf1 is
still present as the second largest open reading frame in
the plastid genome, but is extremely variable in size
between the two Cuscuta species and is greatly elongated
in Ipomoea, possesses numerous large indels, and is difficult to align with other species at the protein level in some
regions These factors likely explain the negative hybridizations previously observed. Although it is one of the least
conserved genes in both Cuscutas and Ipomoea, it is still

apparently evolving under selective constraint as a functional gene. As is the case for ycf15, interpreting consequences of the extreme divergence of this gene in
Convolvulaceae awaits full knowledge of its function.
Gene loss is much more prominent in the two Cuscuta
species than Ipomoea. All genes lost in C. exaltata are also
lost in C. obtusiflora, and are most parsimoniously
assumed to be lost in the common ancestor of both species. Most notable of these losses are the ndh genes, all of
which are fully lost from the plastid or are pseudogenes in
Cuscuta. This confirms the PCR and blot data collected for
Cuscuta reflexa that suggested all ndh genes were missing,
highly altered, or translocated in that species [21] as well
as negative PCR and sequence results from other species
[28]. All ndh genes are also lost from the plastid in Epifagus
[9], indicatingevolution of parasitism may facilitate loss
of these genes or movement to the nuclear genome.
Although ndh genes are retained in most photosynthetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/57

plants, they are also lost from the chloroplast genome of
Pinus [39], indicating their presence in the plastid genome
is not necessary for photosynthesis even in fully
autotrophic plants. Both Cuscuta species also lack a functional rps16 gene in the plastid, although C. exaltata contains a pseudogene with portions of both exons and the
group II intron present between them. A final gene loss
from both Cuscuta plastomes that is also reported in C.
reflexa is the loss of trnK-UUU [40]. As is the case for Epifagus, C. exaltata retains the open reading frame, matK, contained within the intron of that tRNA. A deletion within
the trnV -CAU intron also reported in C. reflexa [21], and
similar to that seen in Orobanche minor, may hypothetically disrupt its splicing [13], but because both exons
remain intact in these species, we hesitate to call it a pseudogene in C. exaltata without experimental evidence.
Aside from these gene losses, plastid genome content of C.
exaltata is identical to that in Ipomoea and includes a full
set of genes presumably necessary for photosynthesis.
Plastid Genome Rearrangements
Structurally, the plastid genome of C. exaltata has undergone a number of changes relative to Ipomoea and Nicotiana. The LSC end of the IR is constricted in both Cuscuta
species, but it has apparently re-extended to include a few
nucleotides of trnH-GUG (4 nucleotides in C. exaltata, 6 in
C. obtusiflora). As in Ipomoea, the first full gene in the LSC
end of the IR in C. obtusiflora is trnI-CAU. However, the IR
constriction is much more dramatic in C. exaltata, with
rpl2, trnI, and over half of ycf2 falling outside the IR (fig.
2). Putative loss of these genes in C. reflexa detected by
PCR [40] is likely an artifact of this constriction rather
than a deletion, as the primers used in that study would
have shown similar results for C. exaltata and not amplified the opposite LSC/IR junction at which these genes
actually do exist. The IR has not extended substantially
into the SSC in Cuscuta as in Ipomoea. In fact, C. exaltata is
somewhat contracted relative to Nicotiana and ends
slightly before the start codon of ycf1. Like Nicotiana, the

IR of C. obtusiflora contains a portion of the 5' end of ycf1.
Two segmental inversion events are observed in C. exaltata. One inversion occurs from trnV-UAC to psbE in the
LSC region, the other in the SSC encompassing only two
genes, ccsA and trnL-UAG. Both of these inversions border
on regions that once contained ndh genes. Extensive noncoding pseudogene sequence may have helped ameliorate
accumulation of repeat sequences that could promote
inversion. Perhaps not coincidentally, the only inversion
observed in Epifagus is trnL-UAG in the SSC [8].
Plastid Genome Changes in C. obtusiflora
The plastid genome of Cuscuta obtusiflora surprisingly
lacks any structural rearrangements relative to Nicotiana
and Ipomoea. Unlike C. exaltata, C. obtusiflora lacks extensive pseudogene sequence and may have purged such
unused DNA from its plastome before sequence motifs
conducive to inversion events had time to develop. Gene
loss, on the other hand, is much more rampant within C.
obtusiflora (Table 1). In addition to the genes previously
discussed for C. exaltata, C. obtusiflora has lost a third
ribosomal protein gene, rpl32, and five additional tRNAs.
Also lost are all subunits of the plastid-encoded RNA
polymerase (rpo), and the intron maturase matK, the loss
of which parallels loss of all group IIA introns from the
genome as well, as previously reported [41]. Blot data and
negative PCR results have suggested loss of plastid rpo
genes from other species within subgenus Grammica as
well [26,28], although the rrn gene cluster and rbcL gene
appear to still be transcribed from nuclear-encoded
polymerase in at least some species [42]. Despite such
extensive gene loss from the plastome, C. obtusiflora
retains all plastid genes directly involved in photosynthesis within the chloroplast, including all atp genes, all pet
genes, rbcL, and all psa and psb genes, with the exception
of psaI. This gene is one of the smallest in the plastome
(36 codons or less), although it is highly conserved across
land plants. Losses of trnV and two introns within ycf3
reported for another member of subgenus Grammica, Cus-

(p < 0.0001, Table 3), suggesting relaxed selection in ndh
genes probably began before the advent of parasitism.

Selective Constraint in Plastid Genes
With these three new full plastid genome sequences, we
tested whether substantial changes in selective pressure of
genes, particularly those lost in Cuscuta, occurred prior to
evolution of parasitism in this lineage. After calculating
corrected distances of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN) and synonymous
substitution per synonymous site (dS) for all genes in Ipomoea and Nicotiana relative to a common outgroup,
Panax, an interesting trend toward relaxed selection in the
genome of the fully autotrophic Ipomoea was revealed (fig.
4). Of 77 protein-coding genes shared between the two
taxa, 56 (72.7%) have a higher dN/dS in Ipomoea than in
Nicotiana, with only 15 genes showing higher dN/dS in
Nicotiana (6 genes were indistinguishable or had dN/dS <
0.01 in both taxa). Furthermore, 12/13 genes lost in both
Cuscuta species had higher dN/dS in Ipomoea, indicating
these genes may have already been under relaxed selection
prior to the evolution of parasitism in Convolvulaceae.
Using likelihood methods, all previously defined classes
of genes (atp, pet, ps, rp, rpo, and ndh) with the exception
of pet showed significantly greater overall rates of substitution in Ipomoea than in Nicotiana in pairwise relative
rates test using Panax as an outgroup (Table 2). Analysis of
the combined set of ndh genes revealed that the ratio of
nonsynonymous substitution rates to synonymous substitution rates (R) on the branch leading to Ipomoea is
much higher than in the previous branch in the tree leading to Solanales leading to an extremely significant difference in the likelihood of the tree when left unconstrained

Pairwise relative rates tests also show significant overall
rate differences between Ipomoea and Cuscuta exaltata as
well as between the two Cuscuta species for all types of
genes (Table 2). We next wanted to test whether ratios of
overall selection between classes of genes remaining in
Cuscuta are similar to autotrophic taxa. Figure 5 shows
how patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution vary between sampled Solanalean taxa relative to
Panax for the various classes of genes in the plastome.
While there are minor changes in synonymous rates
between different gene classes, relative ratio tests of synonymous rates for the tree topologies of each gene class
yielded no significant differences (Table 2). However,
nonsynonymous rate values for ps genes were significantly
different from both atp and rp genes, and there were lower
nonsynonymous rates and R for pet and ps genes in all
pairwise comparisons performed (fig. 5b and 5c). The
trend in Cuscuta is clearly symmetrical to other taxa; all
classes of genes appear to be evolving under strong negative selection with R much lower than 1, and photosystem
and pet genes remain the most highly conserved, even in
the rapidly evolving C. obtusiflora genome. Despite the
loss of psaI in C. obtusiflora, selective constraint on the
plastid genome of both Cuscuta species strongly suggests
that a photosynthetic process remains the primary purpose of their plastid genomes.
Although plastid genes in Cuscuta are still evolving under
strong negative selection, the data show that they are
somewhat relaxed compared to their fully autotrophic rel-

atives. Figure 6 shows phylograms for each of the previously discussed gene classes with significant increases in
synonymous rates and R as determined by LRTs indicated
on the branches. The overall synonymous rate for
C. obtusiflora varies between 5 and 8 times that of the
branch leading to Convolvulaceae across the four classes of
genes for which it could be studied, while that of
C. exaltata is nearly identical (Table 3). These highly accelerated substitution rates in C. obtusiflora could be the result
of shorter generation time, damage to repair machinery
allowed by relaxed selective constraint, or, alternatively,
could result from a lower organismal or plastid genome
population size [43]. Strongly negative selective pressure
in C. obtusiflora, particularly in ps and pet genes, occurring
in spite of highly accelerated rates of nucleotide substitu-

tion further supports the idea that C. obtusiflora must be
utilizing its photosynthetic genes for some purpose important to the plant. This is particularly fascinating considering full loss of plastid-encoded polymerase. While Epifagus
virginiana has been shown to perform transcription of
ribosomal and various other protein coding genes in the
absence of plastid rpo genes [9,10], this phenomenon is
unknown from any photosynthetic plant. In large part,
plastid polymerase performs the transcriptional duties for
photosynthetic genes in typical green plants, but a dramatic shift seems to have occurred in Cuscuta toward
imported nuclear polymerase transcription of all genes.
Many plastid genes are known to be transcribed by both
polymerases [44], and whether or not autotrophic relatives
of Cuscuta obtusiflora already possess the ability to tran-

scribe all genes with imported nuclear polymerase or
whether novel promoters and transcription factor binding
sites evolved rather recently remains to be seen.
Plastid Genome Differences in Cuscuta versus Epifagus
virginiana
Although Epifagus virginiana has undergone a similar
downsizing of its plastid genome, it and Cuscuta are quite
different in a number of ways, most obviously in that Cuscuta retains a seemingly functional set of photosynthetic
genes while Epifagus has lost all such genes. With the loss
of rpo genes in both taxa, we investigated whether both
taxa show similar patterns of deletion in intergenic
regions, which should contain plastid promoters, transcription-factor binding sites, and other motifs no longer
necessary in a nuclear-transcribed plastome. Overall, Epifagus has 22 fewer protein coding genes and 7 fewer tRNA
genes than C. obtusiflora. While the plastid genome size of
Epifagus (70,028 bp) is over 15 kilobases smaller than that
of C. obtusiflora, this is actually less than would be
expected given such a dramatic difference in overall gene
content. In 63 non-coding, intergenic regions between
homologous functional genes in both Cuscuta species, Ipomoea, and Nicotiana, C. obtusiflora (11714) has undergone
a 49% overall decrease in length relative to Nicotiana
(22,996 bp), perhaps largely due to a deletion of plastid
polymerase and transcription factor binding sites. C. exaltata has decreased 16% over the same area, and Ipomoea
only 1%. Over the 16 intergenic regions shared by Epifagus, C. obtusiflora has decreased by 33% relative to Nicotiana, while Epifagus has only decreased by slightly over
3% (values in Table 4A). Likewise, in 3 regions for which
conserved functional genes flanking regions containing
homologously defunct genes could be compared between
Epifagus and C. obtusiflora, Epifagus exhibits a 32% total
decrease in size relative to the full length sequences containing functional genes in Nicotiana, while C. obtusiflora
is 85% shorter (Table 4B). The IR of Epifagus is almost the
same length as that of a normal angiosperm, while its SSC
and LSC regions are the sites of practically all of its gene
loss. Cuscuta obtusiflora has extensive deletion in those
areas too, but also exhibits a significant contraction of the
IR, largely through pseudogene loss relative to Epifagus.
While Cuscuta obtusiflora almost completely lacks pseudogene sequences, Epifagus retains a fair number of them.
Coupled with various intron losses, the plastid genome of
C. obtusiflora is much more streamlined than that of
Epifagus.

We also wanted to test whether genes remaining in the
plastid of the fully nonphotosynthetic Epifagus are under
less constraint than those of the putatively photosynthetic
Cuscuta species. Surprisingly, among the alignable genes
they share, C. obtusiflora is usually more divergent at the
protein level from a common outgroup, Panax (fig. 7).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/57

Comparison of dN/dS across all genes shows no clear
trend, with some genes under greater constraint in Epifagus than in C. obtusiflora and others more conserved in
Cuscuta (fig. 8).
C. obtusiflora retains the four protein-coding genes in Epifagus not related to transcription or translation and presumably the reason for retaining a plastid genome in that
species: accD, clpP, ycf1, and ycf2 [8]. accD and clpP both
are less constrained in Cuscuta than in Epifagus, and in
clpP, dramatically so, with all three Convolvulaceae taxa
exhibiting higher dN/dS for both genes. The effect this has
on the amino acid divergence is also very apparent (fig. 7).
clpP is a protease that is essential for shoot development
in Nicotiana, but exactly which proteins it targets for degradation are still unknown [45]. Why it is so divergent in
the closely related autotroph, Ipomoea, also has yet to be
deduced. While alignable regions of ycf1 and ycf2 actually
have lower dN/dS in C. obtusiflora than for Epifagus, other
regions of each gene are unalignable at even the protein
level in Cuscuta while Epifagus is relatively easy to align,
and overall protein divergence is actually much higher for
C. obtusiflora than Epifagus in these genes. Overall, with
the exception of photosynthetic genes, the plastid genome
of Cuscuta obtusiflora is more streamlined, less constrained, and more divergent than Epifagus for the genes
they share in common. Whether this indicates faster overall evolutionary rates in C. obtusiflora or simply a longer
time as a specialized parasite under relaxed constraint is
difficult to discern without accurate dating methods and
more taxon sampling.
Comparisons with other Nonphotosynthetic Lineages
Despite some differences in patterns of evolution, many
parallels exist between plastid genome evolution in Cuscuta and that of the related but independently derived parasitic lineage Orobanchaceae, including Epifagus. Both
lineages show overall increased rates of nucleotide substitution, relaxed selective constraint, and lack any appreciable shift in synonymous codon usage in spite of loss of
multiple tRNAs [46](Table 5). Substantial gene loss is
observed in both lineages; in addition to sharing loss of
all ndh and rpo genes with C. obtusiflora, Epifagus has lost a
largely overlapping set of tRNAs from its plastid genome.
All tRNAs lost in C. obtusiflora are also lost in Epifagus with
the exception of trnR-ACG, and even that has been suggested to be a pseudogene [13]. The three ribosomal proteins lost in C. obtusiflora are also a subset of the six lost in
Epifagus. Although Epifagus lacks all photosynthetic genes,
other Orobanchaceae retain genes normally required for
photosynthesis in seemingly functional form. Lathraea
clandestina has what appears to be a functional rbcL
(RuBisCo, large subunit) gene, and rpo genes are also
amplifiable by PCR, despite the fact that the plant
apparently lacks chlorophyll and spends its entire life

Pseudogene sequence is defined as intergenic spacer regions between conserved genes that once contained one or more genes no longer present
in functional form in either species.

cycle underground except when flowering [12]. Similarly,
some members of the genus Orobanche and other holoparasites within the family retain rbcL genes that appear to be
evolving under functional constraint [47-49]. Pholisma, a
genus in the holoparasitic family Lennoaceae, is yet
another example of an independently nonphotosynthetic
lineage retaining rbcL [50]. Without full plastid genome
sequence from these plants, it is difficult to know whether
they too may still possess a necessary complement of plastid genes for residual photosynthesis, although unlike the
Cuscuta species in this study, they lack obvious chlorophyll at any life stage and are not above ground to
encounter light for most of their life cycle.
Other non-angiosperm plastid-containing parasite lineages also show patterns of plastid gene loss and loss of
selective constraint. Apicomplexan apicoplast genomes,
which are thought to be derived from a plastid ancestor,
are more similar to Epifagus than Cuscuta in that they contain only a few genes not involved in transcription or
translation, none of which are related to photosynthesis.
However, none of the remaining non-transcriptional/
translational genes are shared with Epifagus, and RNA
polymerase genes are retained in apicoplast genomes
[51]. The euglenoid parasite Astasia longa also has a highly
reduced plastid genome but like Cuscuta retains rbcL [52].
Nonphotosynthetic algae are variable in plastid genome
content; the only genes not involved in transcription or
translation that are normally found in angiosperms in the
plastid genome of Helicosporidium are ycf1 and accD, two
of the four such genes retained in parallel by Epifagus[53].
Prototheca also retains ATP synthase genes, part of the photosynthetic apparatus also retained by Cuscuta but lost in

Epifagus[54]. Although some parallels exist, each independently derived parasite lineage appears to follow a
unique pathway in plastid genome reduction.
Lipid Biosynthesis as a Hypothesis for Photosynthetic
Gene Retention in Cuscuta
While it has been hypothesized that the plastid genome
must be retained at least minimally in nonphotosynthetic
organisms for the transcription of trnE, an essential product for tetrapyrrole synthesis in the plastid[55], retention
of a conserved photosynthetic apparatus in Cuscuta suggests another important role for the plastid genome in
these parasites. Because no atmospheric gas exchange
occurs with chlorophyllous cells in C. reflexa, recycling of
respiratory carbon dioxide has been presented as a
hypothesis for retention of photosynthesis in that species,
and although their source carbohydrates all apparently
originate from the host, a net decline in carbon dioxide
release is indeed detected in the presence of light [22].
However, recycling carbon dioxide back to carbohydrate
through the Calvin cycle is not the only potential reason
for retaining photosynthesis. Another possible explanation for conservation of photosynthetic genes in Cuscuta
and retention of rbcL in other holoparasities may lie in a
recently described alternative function of RuBisCo involving lipid biosynthesis, where it acts independently of its
formerly known role in Calvin cycle production of carbohydrates. In this alternative pathway, 20% more acetylCoA is available for fatty acid biosynthesis, and 40% less
carbon is lost as carbon dioxide in green seeds of Brassica
napus. This pathway is still largely reliant on ATP and
NADPH generated during the light reactions of photosynthesis, although less than 15% of that necessary for the

Amino acid p-distance for Epifagus, Ipomoea, C. exaltata, and C. obtusiflora vs.Panax across most genes present in Epifagus
Figure 7
Amino acid p-distance for Epifagus, Ipomoea, C. exaltata, and C. obtusiflora vs.Panax across most genes present
in Epifagus. Most genes are less altered relative to the outgroup in Epifagus than in Cuscuta obtusiflora, and the non-transcriptional/translational genes remaining in Epifagus (clpP and accD) are particularly divergent in C. obtusiflora.

Calvin cycle is needed for this function of RuBisCo to play
a dominant role in lipid synthesis [56]. No atmospheric
carbon dioxide would be necessary for this process, and it
could also explain the observation of less respiratory carbon dioxide loss during light exposure [22], when necessary ATP and NADPH for the reaction would be produced.
Chlorophyll is most concentrated in developing ovules
and seeds of Cuscuta obtusiflora and close relatives in subgenus Grammica like Cuscuta pentagona, which has been
shown to lack the circular ring of chlorophyllous cells
between the pith and cortex [57]. Because Cuscuta species
must survive long enough after germination to search for
and attach to a host, utilizing this alternative function of
photosynthesis for efficient lipid allocation to seeds and
subsequent efficient carbon use in the free-living seedlings
may explain the need for an intact photosynthetic apparatus in this parasitic lineage.

Use of RuBisCo for lipid biosynthesis may also explain
retention of rbcL in other holoparasite angiosperm plastids and in the parasitic euglenoid Astasia. One of the few
genes for which the plastid genome is transcribed in Epifagus and Helicosporidium, accD, is a subunit of acetyl co-A
carboxylase, indicating that lipid biosynthesis remains an
important function of plastids in these species as well.
Lipid biosynthesis has already been experimentally demonstrated as a major function of apicoplasts and plastids
in a number of nonphotosynthetic non-angiosperm species[58,59]. Future physiological study of photosynthetic
tissues in Cuscuta as well as other parasitic plants, which
may have largely if not entirely lost the primary photosynthetic function of their plastid genomes, should lead to
greater understanding of possible alternate roles of the
plastid genome in parasitic and autotrophic plants alike.

dN/dS for all genes, all taxa (including Epifagus) vs.Panax. Most genes evolve more quickly in Ipomoea than in Nicotiana
(tobacco), indicating relaxed constraint on plastid genes even before evolution of parasitism in Convolvulaceae. Constraint is
further relaxed in Cuscuta exaltata and is most relaxed in Cuscuta obtusiflora, although photosynthetically related genes remain
highly constrained. In general, genes present in Epifagus virginiana are under higher levels of constraint than in Cuscuta obtusiflora, despite the retention of photosynthetic genes in Cuscuta.

Conclusion
By sequencing the full plastid genomes of two parasitic
angiosperms in the genus Cuscuta and a non-parasitic
close relative, Ipomoea, we have been able to gain a better
understanding of the directional downsizing of the plastid
genome in heterotrophs as dependence on photosynthesis for carbohydrate production decreases. These genomes
are greatly complemented by comparison to that already
existing for the parasitic angiosperm Epifagus virginiana;
by studying the similarities and the differences between
these two parasitic lineages, we have unveiled a clearer
picture of which changes to the plastid genome might be
expected to occur in all transitions to heterotrophy, which
might be peculiar to those plants lacking chlorophyll, and
which may be lineage specific to Cuscuta. We find ndh
genes to be the only genes functionally lost during the
transition to parasitism in Cuscuta, while more extensive
loss of both coding and noncoding material has occurred

more recently. Despite substantial reduction of the plastid
genome in Cuscuta, the most highly conserved genes continue to be those directly involved in photosynthesis,
whereas those genes shared with the fully nonphotosynthetic Epifagus are amongst the least conserved. We postulate that the extremely high levels of constraint on
remaining photosynthetic genes may indicate an important function for these gene products in lipid biosynthesis
rather than carbohydrate production through the Calvin
Cycle.

Calculations were made from all coding regions combined. Due to difference in genome content, the total number of codons was different for all
taxa.

DNA isolation in Ipomoea. One gram of tissue from a collection of very green seedlings originating from a selfed
parental plant was used for Cuscuta exaltata, and one gram
of stem tip tissue was used for Cuscuta obtusiflora. Partial
fosmid libraries were constructed from the extracted DNA
using the CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit
(Epicentre, Madison, WI). Libraries were screened for
clones containing plastid DNA according to McNeal et
al[60]. A subset of clones covering the entire plastid
genome was selected for each species, and clones were
shotgun sequenced and the reads assembled according to
previously described methods [61]. Genome annotations
were completed using DOGMA [62] in combination with
manual sequence alignments of previously annotated
genes from available related species. Sequences were
deposited in Genbank with accession numbers EU118126

(Ipomoea), EU189132 (C. exaltata), and EU189133 (C.
obtusiflora).
Molecular Evolutionary Analyses
Phylogenies for each gene were constructed in
PAUP*4.0b10 [63] under various Maximum Parsimony,
Neighbor-Joining, and Maximum Likelihood criteria,
including the following related taxa with full plastid
genome sequences publicly available: Nicotiana tabacum
(Genbank accession NC 001879) and Atropa belladona
(NC 004561)(Solanaceae, Solanales, Asteridae), Panax
ginseng (NC 006290)(Araliaceae, Apiales, Asteridae), and
Spinacia oleracea (NC 002202)(Caryophyllidae) as an outgroup. All sequenced genes appeared orthologous, with
only minor, method-dependent aberrations from the
expected phylogeny which were probably due to extreme

rate heterogeneity between taxa [64]. Maximum Likelihood analyses that were performed under the General
Time-Reversible model with gamma distribution of
among-site variation (GTR+gamma) and model parameters estimated from the data were most accurate at obtaining the expected phylogeny from the data and were used
for subsequent phylogenetic reconstruction of combinedgene datasets.
Pairwise estimates of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) and standard
errors were computed under the Kumar method using
MEGA 2.1 [65] for each gene and for classes of genes that
together encode subunits of larger proteins. ATP synthase
genes, 6 genes, 4344 aligned characters (atp); cytochrome
b6/f complex subunits, 6 genes, 2622 aligned characters
(pet); photosystem I and II protein subunits, 19 genes,
11730 aligned characters (psa and psb = ps); large and
small ribosomal protein subunits, 17 genes, 7686 aligned
characters (rpl and rps = rp); plastid-encoded RNA
polymerase 4 genes, 11958 aligned characters (rpo); and
NADH-dehydrogenase, 11 genes, 10,653 aligned characters (ndh) were predefined classes of genes examined. Pairwise dS, dN, and amino acid p-distance were also
calculated between Epifagus virginiana and Panax, the closest available outgroup to both it and Cuscuta.
Maximum Likelihood estimates of synonymous substitution rates and the ratio of nonysnonymous to synonymous rates (R) for each branch of the combined-gene
dataset phylogenies were calculated under the MG94 Ã
HKY 3 Ã 4 codon model in the HYPHY .99beta package
[66]. HYPHY was also used to conduct likelihood ratio
tests (LRTs) between trees with universally constrained
synonymous rates and R versus trees with each respective
parameter free from constraint on one branch. Branches
leading to Convolvulaceae (Ipomoea + both Cuscuta species), Cuscuta, and each individual Cuscuta species were
tested for significant p-values in this manner. Additionally, pairwise relative rates tests were conducted for each
gene class using various combinations of taxa with all
parameters constrained as the null hypothesis and all
parameters unconstrained as the alternate hypothesis.
Pairwise relative ratio tests were conducted in HYPHY
between the combined datasets with either synonymous
or nonsynonymous distances constrained as the null
hypothesis to determine whether there was significant
heterogeneity in either across gene classes. Parameters
were estimated independently for each branch. Finally,
GCUA [67] was used to determine relative synonymous
codon usage across all coding sequences for each genome
to identify any changes in codon bias that may have
accompanied tRNA loss or relaxed selection for
photosynthesis.

Note in Proof
Two additional Cuscuta plastid genome sequences were
published (Funk et al. BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:45) during the late stages of review of our manuscript. Although
the analyses of the data in our manuscripts demonstrate
little overlap, the plastid genome structure and content of
Cuscuta reflexa in that manuscript closely parallels our
data from Cuscuta exaltata. Likewise, the sequence of Cuscuta gronovii demonstrates similar structure and gene content as Cuscuta obtusiflora.

Authors' contributions
JRM cultivated the plants, produced and screened the partial genomic fosmid libraries, annotated and analyzed the
plastid genomes, and drafted the manuscript. JVK subcloned, sequenced, and assembled reads for the selected
fosmid clones. JLB and CWD helped conceive, design, and
coordinate the study and made large contributions to
manuscript editing. All authors read and approved the
final manuscript.
