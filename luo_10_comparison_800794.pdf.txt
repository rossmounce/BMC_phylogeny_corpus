Abstract
Background: Plants of the Huperziaceae family, which comprise the two genera Huperzia and Phlegmariurus,
produce various types of lycopodium alkaloids that are used to treat a number of human ailments, such as
contusions, swellings and strains. Huperzine A, which belongs to the lycodine type of lycopodium alkaloids, has
been used as an anti-Alzheimer’s disease drug candidate. Despite their medical importance, little genomic or
transcriptomic data are available for the members of this family. We used massive parallel pyrosequencing on the
Roche 454-GS FLX Titanium platform to generate a substantial EST dataset for Huperzia serrata (H. serrata) and
Phlegmariurus carinatus (P. carinatus) as representative members of the Huperzia and Phlegmariurus genera,
respectively. H. serrata and P. carinatus are important plants for research on the biosynthesis of lycopodium
alkaloids. We focused on gene discovery in the areas of bioactive compound biosynthesis and transcriptional
regulation as well as genetic marker detection in these species.
Results: For H. serrata, 36,763 unique putative transcripts were generated from 140,930 reads totaling over
57,028,559 base pairs; for P. carinatus, 31,812 unique putative transcripts were generated from 79,920 reads totaling
over 30,498,684 base pairs. Using BLASTX searches of public databases, 16,274 (44.3%) unique putative transcripts
from H. serrata and 14,070 (44.2%) from P. carinatus were assigned to at least one protein. Gene Ontology (GO)
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology annotations revealed that the functions of the
unique putative transcripts from these two species cover a similarly broad set of molecular functions, biological
processes and biochemical pathways.
In particular, a total of 20 H. serrata candidate cytochrome P450 genes, which are more abundant in leaves than in
roots and might be involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, were found based on the comparison of
H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-ESTs and real-time PCR analysis. Four unique putative CYP450 transcripts (Hs01891,
Hs04010, Hs13557 and Hs00093) which are the most likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids were selected based on a phylogenetic analysis. Approximately 115 H. serrata and 98 P. carinatus unique
putative transcripts associated with the biosynthesis of triterpenoids, alkaloids and flavones/flavonoids were located
in the 454-EST datasets. Transcripts related to phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction as well as transcription factors were also obtained. In addition, we discovered 2,729 and 1,573 potential SSR-motif microsatellite
loci in the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-ESTs, respectively.

Conclusions: The 454-EST resource allowed for the first large-scale acquisition of ESTs from H. serrata and
P. carinatus, which are representative members of the Huperziaceae family. We discovered many genes likely to be
involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and transcriptional regulation as well as a large number of
potential microsatellite markers. These results constitute an essential resource for understanding the molecular basis
of developmental regulation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (especially that of lycopodium alkaloids) in the
Huperziaceae, and they provide an overview of the genetic diversity of this family.

Background
The Huperziaceae consist of two genera, Huperzia and
Phlegmariurus, with a total of about 150species worldwide [1,2]. The Huperziaceae grow very slowly, normally
requiring fifteen to twenty years of growth from spore
germination to maturity [3,4]. Many studies have investigated the natural products in Huperziaceae plants,
including lycopodium alkaloids, triterpenes, flavones and
phenolic acids, some of which possess pharmacological
activities [5-8]. Among these compounds, the lycopodium alkaloids, especially huperzine A (Hup A), were
originally isolated from Huperzia serrata and have been
investigated extensively and intensively [2-4,7].
Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trev. is a member of the
Huperzia genus. Phlegmariurus carinatus (Desv.) Ching,
also known as club moss, is a member of the Phlegmariurus genus [9]. H. serrata and P. carinatus are good
candidate model plants for studying the biosynthetic
pathways of lycopodium alkaloids since they accumulate
various types of lycopodium alkaloids including lycopodines, lycodines and fawcettimines, some of which are
valuable for pharmaceutical applications [2,4]. In particular, Hup A, which belongs to the lycodines, has been
used not only as an anti-Alzheimer’s disease (anti-AD)
drug candidate in China due to its selective inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but also as a dietary supplement in the USA [2,3,10,11]. Whole H. serrata plants
are the original source of Hup A production. P. carinatus is commonly characterized as low, evergreen and
coarsely moss-like, has a close taxonomic relationship
with H. serrata and also produces Hup A across the
entire plant [2]. Given their great health benefits and
economic value, these plants are in danger of extinction
in China due to extensive collection for Hup A production [2,3]. To protect the Huperziaceae from extinction
and to support efforts to produce Hup A, cultivation
and in vitro propagation have been investigated [12].
However, the long-term and efficient protection of these
plants will depend on research into the molecular
mechanisms of lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis and
further research is required in that field so that Hup A
can be produced using biotechnological approaches.
Several recent studies identified a type III polyketide
synthase (PKS) and its corresponding gene in H. serrata
[13,14]. A proposed biosynthesis pathway for the

synthesis of Hup A and related lycopodium alkaloids
consisting of pelletierine coupled with 4PAA was
reported by Ma and Gang (2004) [4] based on previous
studies [15-18]. Initially, L-lysine is decarboxylated by
lysine decarboxylase to form cadaverine. The subsequent
reactions on the intermediates include a series of oxidations, decarboxylations and N-methylations that lead to
the production of Hup A and related lycopodium alkaloids [4,19]. Cytochrome P450s are proposed to catalyze
the oxidative modifications of the intermediates [4].
However, the complete biosynthetic pathways of these
alkaloids (including Hup A) have yet to be elucidated.
Genomic and transcriptomic knowledge is currently
restricted to ten H. serrata and three P. carinatus
nucleotide sequences available in GenBank (January
2009). The limited genetic information available on
these plants and our desire to identify genes involved in
Hup A biosynthesis led us to analyze the transcriptomes
of H. serrata and P. carinatus. The goal of this study
was to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of
H. serrata and P. carinatus using high-throughput
sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to discover functional genes, especially those involved in the
biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and transcriptional
regulation.
EST analysis is a cost-effective and rapid tool for the
isolation of genes. It provides a route for the identification of novel genes and it allows characterization of the
transcriptome in various tissues [20-22]. Ohlrogge and
Benning (2000) [23] reviewed the discovery of genes
involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites
using EST analysis. EST sequencing has also been used
to establish phylogenetic relationships and identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis. EST-SSRs have
revealed polymorphisms not only within the source
taxon, but in related taxa as well [24]. Recently, a “nextgeneration” high-throughput sequencing method based
on the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX platform has emerged as a cost-effective approach that is
well adapted to the analysis of the transcriptomes of
both model and non-model species [25-29]. Not only
can the 454 sequencing technology identify a large number of expressed sequences, but it can also discover new
genes via deep sequencing, effectively revealing the
expression of many rare transcripts.

This report describes a 454-EST analysis of H. serrata
and P. carinatus and discovers a large number of candidate transcripts that have significant sequence similarities to cytochrome P450s, methyltransferases and
dioxygenases, all of which might be involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis in the Huperziaceae plants.
Other genes involved in serratane (triterpenoid) and flavonoid biosynthesis as well as hormone biosynthesis and
signal transduction were also found. Furthermore, SSRs
were detected among the H. serrata and P. carinatus
454-EST datasets. This 454-EST analysis provides the
first insight into the expressed genes of H. serrata and
P. carinatus, the representative members of the Huperziaceae family. Potential genetic markers as well as sets
of transcripts involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis (particularly of lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis)
and transcriptional regulation were obtained.

Results and Discussion
454-EST sequencing and assembly

We constructed two cDNA libraries from a pool of
mRNA from the vegetative organs of H. serrata and P.
carinatus using the SMART technology. The two
libraries were sequenced on a 454-GS FLX Titanium
platform, a one-quarter plate run for H. serrata and a
one-eighth plate run for P. carinatus. After initial quality filtering with the default parameters, these runs
yielded a total of 57 Mb from 140,930 high-quality
(HQ) sequence reads for H. serrata and 30 Mb from
79,920 HQ sequence reads for P. carinatus (Table 1).
An overview of the sequencing and assembly processes
is shown in Table 1. After removal of sequences shorter
than 50 bp, a total of 136,968 (97.2%) H. serrata and
78,282 (97.9%) P. carinatus HQ reads with average
lengths of 405 ± 129 and 382 ± 122 bp, respectively,
were used in the assembly (Table 1). Most of the reads
were similar in length to the results from those studies

[28,29] and longer than those used in the previous 454EST studies [30-32].
The length distribution for these reads is given in Fig
1A, and it suggests that approximately 90% of the reads
were between 200 and 600 bp in length. Clustering and
assembly using the GS De Novo Assembler software
v2.0.01 (454 Life Sciences, Roche) led to the construction of 14,085 and 9,120 contigs from H. serrata and P.
carinatus, respectively, with average lengths of 608 ±
460 and 532 ± 380 bp. Among these, 8,948 (63.5%) H.
serrata and 3,020 (33.1%) P. carinatus contigs with
lengths longer than 500 bp were considered large contigs, the proportions of which were higher than the 827% reported in previous studies using 454 platforms
[30,32]. The average depth of coverage for all H. serrata
and P. carinatus contigs was 4.05-fold and 3.92-fold,
respectively, which are lower than the coverage depths
in previous studies [31,32]. The length distribution of
the contigs from H. serrata and P. carinatus, summarized in Fig 1B, demonstrates that the majority of contigs
had lengths of 500 to 1,500 bp. The relationship
between the length of a given contig and the number of
reads assembled into that contig was positive [32].
Overall, these results indicate the potential for highthroughput sequencing based on the 454-GS FLX Titanium to improve sequencing efficiency in future transcriptome analyses. There were 22,678 H. serrata and
22,692 P. carinatus sequences considered to be singletons, with average lengths of 351 ± 165 and 353 ± 132
bp, respectively (Table 1). In total, 36,763 H. serrata
and 31,812 P. carinatus unique putative transcripts consisting of contigs and singletons were used for the
annotation and subsequent analysis (Table 1).
Annotation of unique putative transcripts

The annotation approach was based on sequence similarity searches in databases. To detect any possible contaminating ribosomal RNA sequences, all unique
putative transcripts were subjected to a BLASTN search
against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database,
yielding 9,299 H. serrata and 7,910 P. carinatus wellidentified sequences with E values ≤ 10 -5 . These
included only 27 and 10 ribosomal RNA sequences
from the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-EST datasets,
respectively. To capture the most informative and complete annotations, all unique putative transcripts were
first used in BLASTX searches against the SwissProt
database. Approximately 20% of the unique putative
transcripts (9,125 H. serrata and 7,555 P. carinatus)
were thus annotated. Then, all the unique putative transcripts were subjected to a BLASTX search against the
NCBI non-redundant protein database, yielding 16,274
and 14,070 well-identified sequences from H. serrata
and P. carinatus, respectively, with at least one hit with

an E value ≤ 10-5 (Table 1). Altogether, only approximately 40% of the unique putative transcripts from H.
serrata and P. carinatus showed significant sequence
similarities to proteins in these databases, indicating that
there is limited information about the genomes or transcriptomes of these ferns and their related species. In
addition, this low proportion (about 40%) of unique
putative transcripts assigned annotations might be due
to the following reasons: (1) some singletons might be
junk sequences produced by 454 sequencing, leading to
assembly difficulties and errors, (2) the advances of deep
sequencing, which can discover novel genes with low
expression levels, (3) the shortness of the sequence
reads, resulting in inefficient annotation.
Among the annotated unique putative transcripts, we
found many transcripts that could be involved in the
biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids and other types of
bioactive compounds, including triterpenoids and flavonoids. These substantial 454-EST datasets provide
comprehensive information about the H. serrata and
P. carinatus transcriptomes for the first time.
Comparison between H. serrata and P. carinatus based on
GO and KEGG assignments

Gene Ontology (GO) assignments describe gene products
in terms of their associated molecular functions, biological
processes and cellular components. To assign putative
functional roles to the unique putative transcripts from H.
serrata and P. carinatus, we compared them to the Arabidopsis proteome using BLASTX and used the GO assignments of the Arabidopsis proteome, producing
assignments for 14,770 (40.2%) H. serrata and 12,539
(39.4%) P. carinatus sequences, respectively, matching
8,117 and 7,061 Arabidopsis genes. The H. serrata and
P. carinatus unique putative transcripts covered a similarly
broad range of GO categories (Fig 2). The GO analysis
identified well-represented categories within cellular components, including chloroplast, the plasma membrane and
the nucleus. The sequences encoded a broad set of transcripts represented within the molecular function categories. The well-represented molecular function categories
included transferase activity, hydrolase activity, nucleotide
binding and transporter activity (Fig. 2). The functions of
the identified genes cover various biological processes.
Among these, other metabolic processes, protein metabolism, response to abiotic or biotic stimuli and transport
were well-represented (Fig. 2). Three gene classes in biological processes (DNA or RNA metabolism, signal transduction and transcription) were overrepresented in the H.
serrata library (Fig. 2). The other ten gene classes were
slightly more abundant in the P. carinatus library (Fig. 2).
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
analysis provides an alternative functional annotation of
genes using Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers for

assignments based on the genes associated with biochemical pathways. Overall, 13,174 H. serrata and
11,600 P. carinatus unique putative transcripts showed
similarities to sequences in the KEGG databases. Of
these sequences, only 3,189 for H. serrata and 2,752 for
P. carinatus were assigned to biochemical pathways.
The profiles of the genes from H. serrata and P. carinatus that were involved in biochemical pathways were
similar (See Additional file 1). The KEGG metabolic
pathways were well-represented by 1,123 H. serrata and
982 P. carinatus unique putative transcripts, most of
which were related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism
and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (See
Additional file 1). These findings probably result from
high levels of expression of essential housekeeping
genes, causing them to be well-represented in an incomplete transcriptome sequencing effort. In particular, the
biosynthetic pathways of several bioactive compounds
were well-represented by 115 H. serrata and 98 P. carinatus unique putative transcripts in our 454-EST datasets, totaling 41 H. serrata- and 44 P. carinatus-related
EC numbers associated with the biosynthesis of alkaloids, flavones/flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids
and steroids (see Additional file 2). The KEGG pathways
of genetic information processing, protein families and
cellular processes were well-represented by unique putative transcripts from H. serrata and P. carinatus (see
Additional file 1). However, most of the unique putative
transcripts (9,985 for H. serrata and 8,848 for P. carinatus) remained unassigned to any known biological pathway (See Additional file 1).
The distributions of gene functions and biochemical
pathways (based on GO and KEGG assignments) in the H.
serrata and P. carinatus transcriptomes were similar, particularly in the categories of molecular function and metabolism. These annotations provide valuable resources for
investigations of gene function, cellular structures and
processes in these two species. The discovery of transcripts
that might be involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids, flavones/flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids will
facilitate the elucidation of bioactive compound biosynthetic mechanisms at the molecular level in the Huperziaceae (see Additional file 2).
SSR detection and validation

Microsatellites (or simple sequence repeats, SSRs) have
been used as a resource for random candidate markers
in population genetics studies. To better understand the
natural diversity of Huperziaceae and to develop strategies for its sustainable utilization, we identified SSR
motifs in our 454-EST dataset. Some of these EST-SSRs
were tightly linked with functional genes that may control certain agronomic characters, including bioactive

compound biosynthesis. A total of 2,729 and 1,573 putative SSR motifs from 2,308 (6.3%) and 1,343 (4.2%) SSRcontaining unique putative transcripts were identified
within the 454-ESTs of H. serrata and P. carinatus,
respectively (see Additional file 3). The incidence of
SSRs in the H. serrata (6.3%) and P. carinatus (4.2%)
unique putative transcripts was lower than that in other
plants such as apple (20%) [33], but it was similar to
that of some dicotyledonous species (ranging from
2.65% to 16.82% [34]). The wide variation in the frequency of SSR motifs between different species results
from the criteria used to identify SSRs during database
mining [35] as well as from considerable variation in the
abundance of SSRs across taxa [36]. Additionally, differences in the software used to detect SSRs might affect
their frequency [37]. Among the SSRs, dinucleotides
(1,766 for H. serrata and 1,214 for P. carinatus) were
the most abundant repeat units followed by trinucleotides (722 for H. serrata and 299 for P. carinatus), tetranucleotides (117 for H. serrata and 29 for P. carinatus),
hexanucleotides (65 for H. serrata and 20 for P. carinatus) and pentanucleotides (59 for H. serrata and 11 for
P. carinatus). The occurrence of SSRs in H. serrata and
P. carinatus is different from their distribution in other

organisms such as the medicinal plant E. sagittatum
[37] and cereal species [38], where trinucleotide repeat
units are the most dominant SSR, followed by di- and
tetranucleotide repeat units [37,38].
The relative frequency of repeats with different dinucleotide compositions was also biased towards one of
four possible repeat classes in these two species (Table
2). Among the dinucleotide repeat classes, AG repeats
were the most common dimer motif, followed by AC
and AT. CG repeats were very infrequent in these two
plants. Among the trinucleotide repeats, AGC/CAG/
GCA/TGC/CTG/GCT was the largest repeat class followed by AAG/GAA/AGA/CTT/TTC/TCT (Table 2).
The majority (81.8% for H. serrata and 82.8% for P. carinatus) of SSR-containing unique putative transcripts
had a single SSR per sequence, while 421 (18.2%) H. serrata and 231 (17.2%) P. carinatus unique putative transcripts contained two or more SSRs per sequence. Over
50% (51.0% for H. serrata and 64.5% for P. carinatus) of
the SSRs were between 9 and 14 bp long (see Additional
file 3). These unique putative transcript-derived SSR
markers that were generated in the present study provide a valuable genetic resource for future studies of
these two species and other related species.

PCR and Sanger sequencing. A total of 16 sequences
were amplified successfully including eight unique putative transcripts from H. serrata and eight from P. carinatus (see Additional file 4). Among these, nine contig
sequences from H. serrata and P. carinatus were amplified by PCR, and all of these were found to contain SSR
motifs. By comparison, only seven singleton sequences
were amplified, five of which contained SSRs (see Additional file 4). Several singletons were not amplified successfully. The primers used to amplify these SSRs are
listed in Additional file 4. Because the transcripts
selected for validation include several candidate genes
encoding enzymes involved in bioactive compound biosynthesis, the SSRs confirmed in these analyses may be
valuable for investigating the genetic determinants of
biosynthesis gene expression. In summary, the successful
experimental validation of the majority of the computationally predicted SSR motifs confirms the utility of
mining 454-ESTs for genetic markers. The development
of EST-SSR markers in Huperziaceae should greatly
facilitate marker-assisted selection, germplasm breeding,
adulterated species identification and genetic diversity
studies in these cultivated medicinal species.
Genes related to lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis

Both H. serrata and P. carinatus produce various types
of lycopodium alkaloids, including Hup A. In an initial

attempt to discover candidate genes involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, we constructed a cDNA
library from H. serrata leaves and used Sanger sequencing to generate 4,023 ESTs (HsESTs) [39]. Comparison
of these HsESTs with the H. serrata 454-ESTs showed
that all of the HsESTs were included in the 454-EST
dataset, reflecting the greater capacity of 454-ESTs for
discovering genes.
Lycopodium alkaloids originate from the coupling of
the pelletierine and the 4PAA/4PAACoA pathways
[4,18] (see Additional file 5). In a first step, lysine decarboxylase decarboxylates L-lysine to form cadaverine.
Thus, lysine decarboxylase is proposed to be the first
enzyme that participates in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis [40]. Although investigations of this enzyme
and its corresponding gene have not been performed in
any Huperziaceae plant, we obtained a full-length cDNA
sequence encoding this enzyme in a previous study [39].
Unique putative transcripts encoding lysine decarboxylase were also present in our 454-EST dataset (data not
shown). The subsequent reactions from malonyl-CoA
and Δ 1 - piperideine to pelletierine, the first general
intermediate of lycopodium alkaloids, might be catalyzed
by a diamine oxidase (enzyme B), a ketosynthase-type
enzyme (enzyme C) or a decarboxylase (enzyme E) [4]
(see Additional file 5A). The second general intermediate of all lycopodium alkaloids is phlegmarine, which is
formed from pelletierine and 4PAA/4PAACoA, involving also a decarboxylation step [4,19] (see Additional
file 5B). The oxidative modifications of phlegmarine and
lycodane are presumably catalyzed by cytochrome P450
or dioxygenase, and they produce a series of precursors
of Hup A [4] (see Additional file 5). Unique putative
transcripts showing similarities to those of uncharacterized enzymes possibly associated with lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, including cytochrome P450-dependent
monooxygenases (CYP450s), methyltransferases and
dioxygenases, were found in the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-EST datasets (see Additional file 6, 7 and 8).
These candidate CYP450s presumably catalyze the oxidative modifications leading to the production of lycopodium alkaloids (see Additional file 5B). Of the unique
putative transcripts, 96 H. serrata and 82 P. carinatus
sequences were annotated as putative CYP450s belonging to various subfamilies (see Additional file 6 and
Additional file 9).
In plants, CYP450s catalyze many different reactions
involved in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways,
including those leading to alkaloids, phenylpropanoids,
hormones, terpenoids, sterols, lignins, fatty acids, pigments and the detoxification of herbicides [41].
Although the results of several studies suggest progress
in the isolation and characterization of CYP450s, identification of the range of functions of individual CYP450

Luo et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/209

proteins, which belong to diverse gene families and
possess a variety of conserved domains, is a significant
challenge for future research [42]. However, the identification of CYP72A1 from Catharanthus roseus [43] and
CYP88D6 (licorice b-amyrin 11-oxidase) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis [44] provide examples of efficient
approaches and the problems that may be encountered
in the determination of biochemical functions of
CYP450s.
Since lycopodium alkaloids are produced in both of
H. serrata and P. carinatus, the relevant lycopodium
CYP450s should be present in each of these two species.
Therefore, to narrow down the list of likely candidate
lycopodium CYP450 transcripts from the putative
CYP450s, unique putative transcripts encoding CYP450s
present in both species and showing sequence similarity
were considered. These include a total of 63 unique
putative transcripts (46 contigs and 17 singletons for H.
serrata and 44 contigs and 19 singletons for P. carinatus) encoding putative CYP450s (see Additional file 10).
The 46 contigs of H. serrata were selected for the subsequent real-time PCR analysis. Furthermore, due to the
fact that the highest level of Hup A in H. serrata is in
the leaves and the lowest level is in the roots [2], the
genes involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis are
expected to be expressed more abundantly in leaves
than in roots. To assess changes in gene expression patterns on a functional level, the data were filtered by calculating the fold-change between the expression levels
in different organs, and a comparison was made
between leaves and roots. Thus, twenty putative
CYP450s that are more abundantly expressed in H. serrata leaves than in roots were evaluated using real-time
PCR analysis as likely candidate CYP450s involved in
lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis (Fig 3). Among the
twenty putative CYP450s, The expression levels of
Hs01578, Hs02360, Hs02366, Hs05747, Hs06868, and
Hs09101 were significantly higher in leaves than in
roots (> 10 times) as showed in Fig 3. The selection
method by real-time PCR analysis of the candidate
CYP450s used in this study was similar to that used for
the identification of CYP88D6 in G. uralensis [44].
CYP88D6 was identified after mining of EST datasets
and subsequent transcript profiling-based selection. The
expression profile of CYP88D6 was consistent with the
organ-specific accumulation pattern of glycyrrhizin [44].
The other 26 contigs detected H. serrata transcripts that
were expressed more highly in roots than in leaves were
not considered in our subsequent studies (data not
shown).
Besides the above selection, the other potential candidate CYP450 selected method using a phylogenetic analysis between the full-length CYP450s from our 454EST datasets and other CYP450s from other plants

which were associated with secondary metabolism biosynthesis was performed. More putative CYP450 transcripts were amplified and obtained the full-length
cDNA sequences using RT-PCR and/or the RACE
approach based on the contig sequences including the
unique putative transcripts which were showed in Fig 3.
However, the amplifications of the unique putative transcripts presented in Fig 3 such as Hs02360, Hs02366,
Hs06232, Hs06868, Hs09101, Hs09894 and Hs12105
from H. serrata using the RACE approach were unsuccessful. Together, a total of seventeen full-length
CYP450s from our 454-EST datasets (including twelve
genes from H. serrata and five genes from P. carinatus)
were used in phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic
relationship between these CYP450s and characterized
CYP450s from other plants is depicted in Fig 4. Three
CYP450s (Hs01891, Hs04010, and Hs13557) belong to a
group with CYP450 (Q05047.1) encoding secologanin
synthase (SLS), which catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of
loganin into secologanin [45] (Fig. 4). These candidate
CYP450s were also expressed more abundantly in leaves
than in roots (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the
organ-specific accumulation pattern of lycopodium alkaloids and thus they may play key roles in alkaloid
biosynthesis. It is also noteworthy that the CYP450
of Hs00093 is phylogenetically close to these CYP450s
(AAU20771.1, BAB68769.1, ADB89214.1 and
ACO90219.1) (Fig. 4). AAU20771.1 encoding (S)-canadine synthase catalyzes the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge in berberine synthesis [46]. BAB68769.1
encodes a methylenedioxy bridge-forming cytochrome
P450 dependent enzyme, while ADB89214.1 and
ACO90219.1 encode stylopine synthase, all of which are
involved in (S)-stylopine biosynthesis [47]. Phlegmarine
might be modified by an enzyme similar to the berberine bridge enzyme to form lycodane [4]. Therefore,
Hs00093 is a lead candidate for involvement in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis. In subsequent studies, we
will clone the full-length cDNA sequences for these candidates and assess their enzymatic activities in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis. In addition, according to the
phylogenetic analysis, the CYP450s from one group
(including the four genes Hs00075, Hs06334, Pc00236
and Pc02140) might be involved in flavone/flavonoid
biosynthesis, and those in another group (including the
six genes Pc00064, Pc03281, Pc00065, Hs05747,
Hs00086 and Hs02648) might be involved in terpenoid
biosynthesis (Fig. 4).
The CYP450 enzymes involved in lycopodium alkaloid
biosynthesis are neither well-characterized nor wellunderstood. Thus, these candidate CYP450s generated
in our 454-EST datasets will be a valuable resource for
CYP450 identification in H. serrata and P. carinatus. In
addition, unique putative transcripts that show

similarities to dioxygenases and methyltransferases are
presented in Additional files 7 and 8, and they will be
screened using the transcript profiling-based selection
method described above for selecting CYP450s. These
genes will be further characterized for their biological
functions in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids,
which will allow for identification of specific enzymes
and elucidation of the entire biosynthetic pathway(s) of
the lycopodium alkaloids based on the approaches of
modern biochemistry and molecular biology.
Genes related to terpenoid and flavone/flavonoid
biosynthesis

The serratanes, a unique family of pentacyclic triterpenoids possessing seven tertiary methyls and a central
seven-member C-ring, were isolated from plants of the
Pinaceae and Lycopodium species [48]. Previous studies
have revealed the presence of serratane-type triterpenoids in the medicinal plants of H. serrata [49-51]. The
mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway) and methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP pathway) play important
roles in the biosynthesis of terpenoids by providing precursors for these processes. Sequences representing
enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, including
most of the steps of the MEP and MVA pathways, were
abundant in our 454-EST dataset (see Additional file 2).
Unique putative transcripts with homology to known
key enzymes in steroid biosynthesis were found in these
ESTs, including transcripts for squalene synthetase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, geranylgeranyltransferase, isopentenyl-diphosphate Δ-isomerase and squalene
monooxygenase (see Additional file 2).
Flavonoids, including anthocyanins and flavanols, are
polyphenolic secondary metabolites derived from the
amino acid phenylalanine and synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway [52]. These secondary metabolites
possess important beneficial health attributes, probably
due to their antioxidant activity [53,54]. The identification of genes specific to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the isolation of flavone glycosides from H.
serrata suggest that flavonoids, including anthocyanins
and flavones, are constituents of this medicinal plant
[14,55]. Representative genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were found by BLASTX searches for unique
putative transcripts representing different enzymes in
the pathway. There were multiple unique putative transcripts for genes in this pathway, including transcripts
encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, chalcone synthase,
chalcone isomerase, NAD(P)H-dependent 6’-deoxychalcone synthase and flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase (F3’5’H)
(see Additional file 2). In the pathway for the production
of anthocyanins, unique putative transcripts encoding
leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, anthocyanidin synthase
and anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase were also

Page 11 of 16

prominently found in the H. serrata and P. carinatus
454-EST datasets (see Additional file 2).
Genes related to growth and development

The Huperziaceae are some of the oldest vascular
plants, and they grow very slowly, usually in special
habitats. Some classes of phytohormones (e.g., gibberellins and abscisic acid) and transcription factors might
play key roles in the regulation of plant development
and environmental responses in the Huperziaceae
plants.
Phytohormones, such as auxin, gibberellins (GAs),
abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins, ethylene and brassinosteroids (BRs), play critical roles in the regulation of
diverse aspects of plant growth and development as well
as in environmental responses [56-58]. The biosynthetic
pathways of hormones have been elucidated in several
model organisms [59-61]. The 454-EST database from
H. serrata and P. carinatus contains sequences with
homology to many known enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones (see Additional file 11).
Unique putative transcripts showing sequence similarities to gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 3-betadioxygenase and gibberellin 20-oxidase, all of which are
involved in GA biosynthesis, were found in the 454-EST
datasets from H. serrata and P. carinatus (see Additional file 11). There were multiple sequences for genes
encoding abscisic acid 8’-hydroxylase in the catabolic
pathway of ABA from H. serrata and P. carinatus (see
Additional file 11). In addition, unique putative transcripts with homology to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene,
were abundant in the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454EST datasets. Additionally, unique putative transcripts
with homology to cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase and
cytokinin dehydrogenase, which are involved in the biosynthesis of cytokinin, were also abundant in the H. serrata and P. carinatus 454-EST datasets (see Additional
file 11). Some components involved in hormone signal
transduction were also discovered, such as the gibberellin receptors GID1L1, GID1L2, GID1L3 and GID1; the
ethylene receptor; the auxin response factor; and brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (See
Additional file 11). These genes might have essential
functions in the regulation of development and/or environmental responses in H. serrata and P. carinatus.
Transcription factors play key roles in the regulation
of gene expression in response to developmental processes and environmental stress in plants [62]. In this
study, we detected 504 H. serrata and 469 P. carinatus
unique putative transcripts representing homologs
belonging to different transcription factor (TF) families,

Luo et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/209

including the MYB, homeobox, zinc finger, basic helixloop-helix, bZIP, WRKY, AUX/IAA, ARF and B3 family
proteins (see Additional file 12). The most abundant TF
family in our datasets was the MYB protein family,
which is characterized by conserved domains. Another
highly expressed set of transcription factors was the
homeobox family in our datasets. Interestingly, unique
putative transcripts encoding B3 domain transcription
factors were expressed abundantly in P. carinatus (26
unique putative transcripts) but were absent in the H.
serrata 454-EST dataset (see Additional file 12). This
was a surprising observation, considering the fact that
the two species are so closely related. It may be that the
timing of material collection corresponded to a period
of inactivity of these genes, which would explain the
lack of the corresponding transcripts in the H. serrata
454-EST dataset.
We also searched for transcription factor genes that are
expressed in spatial and temporal patterns indicative of
important roles in the regulation of secondary metabolite
biosynthesis. Several transcription factors involved in the
regulation of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis genes
have been isolated and studied [63]. Some transcription
factors serve as positive or negative regulators in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The molecular functions of the transcription factors which were expressed
abundantly in H. serrata and P. carinatus (see Additional
file 12) potentially involved in biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites and/or environmental responses will be characterized in a future study.

Conclusions
This collection of 454-ESTs from H. serrata and P. carinatus provides a significant resource for gene discovery
in these medicinal plants. The results outlined here
establish a rapid and cost-effective method for deep
transcriptome sequencing using the 454-GS FLX Titanium platform. The 454-EST datasets from H. serrata
and P. carinatus provide a description of the expressed
genes in these two species, which belong to different
genera but the same family. In addition to finding a
large number of genetic markers for studies of genetic
connectivity and structure, we discovered candidate
genes that provide the foundation for functional
research on secondary metabolism and growth regulation in the Huperziaceae. These unique putative transcripts are likely candidates for the biosynthesis of
lycopodium alkaloids, terpenoids and flavones/flavonoids, as well as associated with developmental regulation and environmental responses. Our initial H. serrata
and P. carinatus 454-EST analysis represents a substantial contribution that will increase the opportunities for
specific gene discovery and pathway-based studies.

Methods
Plant material

H. serrata and P. carinatus plants (grown in the wild)
that had reached heights of 10-12 and 50-55 cm, respectively, were collected in Bawangling at an altitude of
1,320 meters (109°10′ E, 19°7′ N) in Hainan Province
(November 3, 2008). The plants were authenticated by
Professor Yu-Lin Lin of the Institute of Medicinal Plant
Development (IMPLAD) using the morphological identification approach of the Flora of China and the Flora of
Hainan Province, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
Whole plants were collected and rinsed with water 5-8
times. Then, the plants were dried gently and quickly
with absorbent paper. The cleaned leaves, stems and
roots were isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, then stored at -70°C until RNA isolation.
RNA preparation

Total RNA was isolated from six grams (two grams each
of roots, stems and leaves) of the whole plant using the
RNeasy plant kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). The RNA
quality was tested using EtBr-stained agarose gels, and
the concentration was assessed using a GeneQuant100
spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, UK). Approximately
two micrograms of poly(A) RNA was isolated from total
RNA using an Oligotex® mRNA Midi Kit (QIAGEN,
CA), and the quality was assessed with a GeneQuant100
spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, UK) prior to cDNA
synthesis. The cDNA was produced using 0.8 micrograms of purified poly(A) RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided with Clontech’s SMART
cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, USA). For the two
libraries, cDNA was amplified using PCR Advantage II
polymerase (Clontech, USA) and the following thermal
profile: 1 min at 95°C followed by 13 cycles of 95°C for
15 sec, 65°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 6 minutes. Five
microliters of PCR product were electrophoresed in a
1% agarose gel to determine amplification efficiency.
Approximately 3-5 micrograms of amplified cDNA PCR
product were purified using the PureLink™ PCR purification kit (Invitrogen, USA) before the 454 library
construction.
Library construction and 454 sequencing

The two 454 libraries were constructed as described
previously [64]. Approximately five micrograms of
amplified cDNA was sheared by nebulization to produce
random fragments approximately 300-800 bp in length
for 454-sequencing. The fragmented cDNA samples
were assessed by gel electrophoresis to evaluate the
effectiveness of the process. Oligonucleotide adaptors
were ligated to the fragmented cDNA samples according
to standard procedures. The DNA fragments were then

Luo et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/209

denatured to generate single-stranded DNA that was
amplified by emulsion PCR for sequencing. The sequencing of the libraries was performed on a 454-GS FLX
Titanium sequencing platform (454 Life Sciences,
Roche). All raw 454 sequence data generated in this
study are available in the Sequence Read Archive of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
[65] with the accession numbers SRX010999 for H. serrata and SRX011001 for P. carinatus.
Sequence assembly

All analyses of the sequencing data were performed with
the GS FLX Software v2.0.01 (454 Life Sciences, Roche).
After using a series of normalization, correction and
quality-filtering algorithms, the 454 data were filtered
for weak signals and low-quality sequences, and the
read ends were screened and trimmed for 454 adaptor
sequences to yield high quality (HQ) sequences (> 99.5%
accuracy on single base reads). A subsequent filtering
step included the masking of SMART PCR primer
sequences (Clontech) and the removal of sequences
shorter than 50 bp before assembly. Finally, these HQ
reads were assembled into unique putative transcripts
(including contigs and singletons) using GS De Novo
Assembler Software, which is an application of the GS
FLX Software. The assembly was performed using the
default parameters.
Sequence annotation

To find the most descriptive annotation possible for
each sequence, sequence annotation was based on a set
of BLAST searches. The BLAST software version was
BLAST 2.2.17 (downloaded from NCBI). The sequences
were searched using BLASTN against the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) database with an E-value cutoff of 10-5. The first BLASTX search was used to search
for similar sequences in the SwissProt database (http://
www.uniprot.org/, released on 06/19/2009), then the
NCBI non-redundant protein (nr) database (released on
06/23/2009) was searched. The top hit of each BLASTX
search with an E-value ≤ 1 × 10-5 was considered a significant match. The functional categories of these
unique putative transcripts were further identified using
the Gene Ontology (GO) Database. The unique putative
transcripts were categorized according to GO on the
basis of AGI codes and The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR) GO slim provided by TAIR. The Arabidopsis proteome data were downloaded from TAIR
http://www.arabidopsis.org (version Tair9). The biochemical pathway assignments were carried out according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) mapping http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/kegg2.
html (version KEGG 50). Enzyme Commission (EC)
numbers were assigned to the unique putative

Page 13 of 16

transcripts based on BLASTX with a cut-off value of E
≤ 10-5 upon searching protein databases. The sequences
were mapped to KEGG biochemical pathways according
to the EC distribution in the pathway databases.
SSR detection and validation

The detection of SSRs in the total unique putative transcripts from H. serrata and P. carinatus was performed
using the Simple Sequence Repeat Identification Tool
(SSRIT) http://www.gramene.org/db/markers/ssrtool,
which accepts FASTA-formatted sequence files and
reports the sequence ID, the SSR motif, the number of
repeats (di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexa-nucleotide repeat
units), the repeat length, the position of the SSR and the
total length of the sequence in which the SSR was found
[66]. Only repeat lengths longer than 9 bp were used in
the analysis. The repeat classes (e.g., di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta- or hexa-nucleotides) were combined by type; for
example, GA repeats also encompassed repeats identified
as AG and their complementary sequences TC and CT
repeats. For trinucleotides, AAC repeats include CAA
and ACA, as well as their complementary sequences
GTT, TTG and TGT. The search parameter for the maximum motif-length group was set to hexamer and that
for the minimum number of repeats was set to five.
SSR validation was performed using RT-PCR and the
Sanger sequencing method. According to the SSR positions in the unique putative transcripts, we selected
sequences on the left and right of an SSR motif (with
the distance between the primers and the SSR motif at
least 100 bp) to design specific primers. The parameters
for designing the primers were as follows: primer length
ranging from 18 bases to 25 bases with 20 as the optimum, PCR product size ranging from 100 to 500 bp,
optimum annealing temperature 58°C, and GC content
from 40% to 60% with 50% as the optimum. Total RNA
was extracted using the RNeasy plant kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China) from whole plants similar to the plant material used in the high throughput sequencing. Reverse
transcription reactions were performed using 3 μg of
total RNA and a SuperScript III RT kit (Invitrogen) in a
20 μl volume at 50°C for 50 min. Using 10 ng of the
amplified intact cDNA as a template, each target was
amplified separately in a 25 μl volume containing 1 ×
PCR buffer, 0.2 μM each specific primer, 0.4 mM dNTP
and 0.5 U Pyrobest™ DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian,
China). The amplification profile consisted of an initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 35
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 40 s,
with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. After
evaluating their molecular weight and specificity using
gel electrophoresis, the PCR products were divided into
two groups: one group with bright specific bands was
used for sequencing using the specific forward primers,

Luo et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/209

and the others were ligated into the vector pMD18-T
(Takara), transformed into Top 10 E. coli competent
cells (Takara) and sequenced using RV-M primers.
Real-time PCR analysis

To assay the transcript levels of putative CYP450s in
roots and leaves of H. serrata, quantitative real-time
PCR analysis was performed with an IQ5 Multicolor
Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD, USA)
using Power SYBR R Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and it was repeated three
times. Total RNA was extracted from H. serrata roots
and leaves and treated with RNase-free DNase
(TaKaRa). The reverse transcription reaction was carried
out using Oligod(T)15 primers and SuperScript III (RT
kit; Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Each reaction contained 10 μl 2 × SYBR Green
Master Mix Reagent (Applied Biosystems), 10 ng of
cDNA sample and 200 nM gene-specific primers. The
total volume was 20 μl. The cycling conditions were: 50°
C for 2 min and 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 sec and then 60°C for 1 min. This program was followed by a melting-curve program, 55 to
85°C, with a 5 s hold at each temperature. The mean
value of three replicates was normalized using Actin
(Hs00917 in our H. serrata 454-EST dataset) as the
internal control. PCR amplification was performed using
specific primers for the putative CYP450s listed in Additional file 4. The suitability of the oligonucleotide
sequences in terms of annealing efficiency was evaluated
in advance using the Primer 3.0 program. The mean
value of three replicates was normalized using Actin as
the internal control. The relative expression levels were
calculated by comparing the CTs (cycle thresholds) of
the target genes with that of the housekeeping gene
Actin using the 2-ΔΔCT method [67].
Phylogenetic analysis

Distances between the clones were calculated with the
CLUSTAL W program [68]. The scale represents 0.1
amino acid substitutions per site. Amino acid sequences
were aligned using the CLUSTALW program and evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method, and a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was
constructed with MEGA4. Bootstrap values obtained
after 1,000 replications, which are given on the branches.
