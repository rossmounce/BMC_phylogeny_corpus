Abstract
Background: Heat-shock proteins are specialized molecules performing different and essential
roles in the cell including protein degradation, folding and trafficking. GroEL is a 60 Kda heat-shock
protein ubiquitous in bacteria and has been regarded as an important molecule implicated in
chronic inflammatory processes caused by Chlamydiae infections. GroEL in Chlamydiae became
duplicated at the origin of the Chlamydiae lineage presenting three distinct molecular chaperones,
namely the original protein GroEL1 (Ct110), and its paralogous proteins GroEL2 (Ct604) and
GroEL3 (Ct755). These chaperones present differential and independent expressions during the
different stages of Chlamydiae infections and have been suggested to present differential
physiological and regulatory roles.
Results: In this comprehensive in silico study we show that GroEL protein paralogs have diverged
functionally after the different gene duplication events and that this divergence has occurred mainly
between GroEL3 and GroEL1. GroEL2 presents an intermediate functional divergence pattern
from GroEL1. Our results point to the different protein-protein interaction patterns between
GroEL paralogs and known GroEL protein clients supporting their functional divergence after groEL
gene duplication. Analysis of selective constraints identifies periods of adaptive evolution after gene
duplication that led to the fixation of amino acid replacements in GroEL protein domains involved
in the interaction with GroEL protein clients.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that GroEL protein copies in Chlamydiae species have diverged
functionally after the gene duplication events. We also show that functional divergence has
occurred in important functional regions of these GroEL proteins and that very probably have
affected the ancestral GroEL regulatory role and protein-protein interaction patterns with GroEL
client proteins. Most of the amino acid replacements that have affected interaction with protein
clients and that were responsible for the functional divergence between GroEL paralogs were fixed
by adaptive evolution after the groEL gene duplication events.

Background
Cells use several mechanisms to ameliorate the effects of
transient changes in the environmental conditions such as

heat stress, irradiation, viral infections, etc. For instance,
cells have developed a complex family of genes coding for
protein-folding machines sharing a wide range of vital

functions to buffer the effects of stress on the proteome
integrity. These proteins, also called heat-shock proteins
or molecular chaperones, are classified in different protein families named on the basis of their members'
approximate molecular weight and they assist in the folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins [1-3]. The
heat-shock protein GroEL is among the best-studied
molecular chaperones in bacteria and belongs to the
group I chaperonins. Group I chaperonins are a group of
ring-shaped ATPases that assist de novo protein folding in
most cellular compartments [4-8]. GroEL is a homotetradecamer that interacts with a ring-shaped cofactor named
GroES, which participates in folding proteins into the correct three-dimensional conformation [9,10], and both
proteins are essential for Escherichia coli growth at all range
temperatures [11].
Due to the important functional role played by GroEL in
maintaining the proteome integrity of cells, GroEL has
become the target of many microbiological studies aimed
at uncovering molecules involved in the epidemiology of
pathogenic bacteria. GroEL from pathogenic bacteria is a
highly immunoadjuvant protein and is recognised by the
Toll-like receptors as part of the innate defence system
[12,13]. The fact that GroEL is among the most conserved
protein families [13] and that GroEL isolated from pathogenic bacteria has been reported to have a strong immune
eliciting function [14] has inspired projects aimed at
developing vaccines targeting GroEL from pathogens.
These studies yielded insightful results implicating GroEL
in bacterial disease pathogenesis such as those caused by
Chlamydiae infections [15]. GroEL in Chlamydiae trachomatis (also called Ct110) has been implicated in chronic
inflammatory processes caused by Chlamydiae infections
leading to tissue damage and scarring [16-19]. Interestingly, GroEL in Chlamydiae became duplicated at the origin of the Chlamydiae lineage presenting three distinct
molecular chaperones, namely the original protein
GroEL1 (Ct110), and its paralogous proteins GroEL2
(Ct604) and GroEL3 (Ct755) [15]. Even though the three
Chlamydiae GroEL proteins present substantial amino acid
sequence conservation in important regions involved in
polypeptide binding when compared to GroEL from the
bacterium Escherichia coli, significant differences have
been spotted in GroES binding regions and at regions
involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Among the three
groEL genes, only the expression levels of groEL1 and its
cochaperone groES increase under heat-stress conditions
and only the protein GroEL1 complements the function
of a GroEL thermo-sensitive mutation in HeLa cells under
heat-stress conditions [15]. Further, a previous report
identified differences in the expression levels between the
three groEL genes during the developmental stages of C.
trachomatis [20]. This study also showed through in vitro
models of C. trachomatis infection that the three different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/81

groEL genes are differentially and independently
expressed during the different infection cycles of this pathogen, with groEL2 being highly expressed during the infectious cycle of Chlamydiae and groEL3 showing the highest
expression among the three groEL genes during the persistent infections [20].
Despite previous efforts invested in unravelling the main
functional differences between the three different groEL
genes in Chlamydiae, results have brought more questions
than they have answered regarding the reasons for this
functional divergence. To date, apart from one study in
2003 conducting some computational analyses for these
genes [15], no detailed bioinformatics approach has been
performed to aid in understanding the evolutionary
dynamic differences between the three groEL genes and to
link these differences with functional data.
In this study we conduct state-of-the-art bioinformatics
analyses to unravel the main selective constraints leading
to the functional differentiation between the Chlamydiae
groEL genes. To identify functional divergence between
the different GroEL protein copies we test the selective
constraints after groEL gene duplication, analyze and phylogenetically map amino acid sites involved in this functional divergence and conduct molecular coevolution
analyses within GroEL proteins and between these and
proteins known to be obligate E. coli GroEL protein clients. The effects of amino acid sites involved in functional
divergence in the stability of GroEL protein structures are
also discussed.

Results
GroEL proteins have diverged functionally in Chlamydiae
after gene duplication
To test functional divergence between GroEL proteins
after gene duplication we applied the program Diverge
version 2.0 (See methods for details). Diverge tests for the
presence of functional divergence of two types, functional
divergence type I and type II. Functional divergence type I
is detected when sites conserved (for example, showing
no or low number of amino acid replacements when comparing sequences at that particular site) in one of the phylogenetic clusters (protein paralog) are significantly
variable in the other related phylogenetic cluster. In other
words, functional divergence type I indicates strong selective (and therefore functional) constraints at that site (for
example, due to the acquisition or pre-existence of a functional role for that site) in one of the clusters and relaxed
constraints (due to the loss or inexistent functional role at
that site) in the paralogous cluster. Functional divergence
type II is detected when, after gene duplication mutations
leading to different amino acids become fixed in both
resulting paralogous proteins and these mutations remain
conserved after speciation in each cluster. This pattern

indicates that amino acid sites diverged functionally
between both paralogous clades (showing two distinct
amino acids when comparing the two clades) but they
were equally important for the protein's function (for
example the amino acid remain conserved in each phylogenetic clade). We were interested in testing functional
divergence type I to detect loss or acquisition of functional
roles in particular amino acid sites in one of the GroEL
group paralogs.
We subjected the multiple sequence alignments including
the three GroEL protein paralogs to phylogenetic analyses
and used the resulting phylogeny as an initial tree for the
functional divergence test. In all the comparisons performed, the hypothesis of functional divergence provided
significantly better log-likelihood values than the null
hypothesis that assumes no functional divergence. In fact,
GroEL1 showed functional divergence type I when compared to GroEL2 (Î¸ = 0.371 Â± 0.096; LRT = 15.025; P <
0.001) and GroEL3 (Î¸ = 0.943 Â± 0.099; LRT = 90.978; P <<
0.001). Interestingly, the parameter of functional divergence as well as the LRT was more significant when comparing GroEL1 to GroEL3 than in the case of the
comparison of GroEL1 to GroEL2 (Table 1). GroEL2
showed moderate functional divergence from GroEL1 and
stronger divergence from GroEL3 than from GroEL1 (Î¸ =
0.441 Â± 0.073; LRT = 36.014; P < 0.001). Comparison of
GroEL1 to the cluster formed by GroEL2 and GroEL3 also
yielded significant results (Î¸ = 0.414 Â± 0.117; LRT =
12.484; P < 0.001).
Functional divergence data is therefore in agreement with
the expression divergence shown in previous functional/
expression analysis demonstrating that in fact the different groEL gene copies are differently and independently
expressed over time post-infection during Chlamydiae
infection, and that GroEL3 is the most abundant protein
at all time points assessed during the developmental cycle
[20]. In their study however, GroEL3 was virtually absent
during persistent infections and GroEL2 showed the highest expression levels at that stage [20]. Our results also
support, in addition to the differential expression of the
different groEL genes, the divergence in the protein function between the three Chlamydiae GroEL proteins.
The difference in the magnitude of functional divergence
between GroEL proteins can also be quantified by the
identification of sites responsible for such functional
divergence after each duplication event (Figure 1A).
Examination of the distribution of sites under functional
divergence (Figure 1B) when we compared GroEL1 to
GroEL2 only yielded three amino acid positions under
functional divergence using the posterior probability (PP)
threshold of PP= 0.75. These sites were I131, A205 and
E338 (Here we take the GroEL1 sequence of Chlamydiae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/81

trachomatis, with accession number: NP_219613 as the
reference protein sequence). The homologous site of
A205 in E. coli (C205) is located in a region involved in
binding protein substrates [21]. In addition, E338 is the
homologous position to A339 in E. coli, closely located to
charged residues exposed to the central cavity in the cis
GroEL ring, probably in contact with substrates [13].
These sites were conserved in GroEL1 but became variable
in GroEL2, suggesting a loss of functional role in GroEL2
at these sites. Comparison of GroEL1 to the cluster formed
by the paralogs GroEL2 and GroEL3 identified as sites significantly responsible for functional divergence type I
I131, A205, S348 and S473 (Figure 1A and 1B). Apart
from the obvious functional role of A205, S473 is the
homologous position of G471 in E. coli and physically
proximal to E. coli 478â481 possition involved in ATP
binding and hydrolysis [21]. Once again, these positions
are highly conserved in GroEL1 and very variable in the
cluster formed by the paralogs GroEL2 and GroEL3.
Comparison of GroEL1 to GroEL3 and GroEL2 to GroEL3
showed a great percentage of sites under functional divergence type I with threshold posterior probability values of
PP = 0.75 and PP = 0.95 (Figure 1B). The number of sites
detected was greater in the comparison of GroEL1 to
GroEL3 than in GroEL2 to GroEL3 comparison. We also
studied the pattern of functional divergence and found
three different profiles represented by the amino acid sites
under functional divergence. The first pattern presented
sites conserved for GroEL1 and GroEL2 but variable for
GroEL3 (supporting loss of functional constraints at that
site in GroEL3) and was represented by 42.18% of the
functionally divergent sites. The second pattern was that
represented by sites (23.44%) that were variable in
GroEL1 and GroEL2 and became conserved in GroEL3
(indicating a gain of functional constraints in GroEL3 as
the most parsimonious hypothesis). Finally we also found
sites (33.6% of sites) variable in GroEL1 that became conserved in GroEL2 and GroEL3 (indicating the possible loss
of functional constraints at that site in GroEL1). In most
of the cases hence, GroEL3 presented loss of functional
constraints in some sites and gain of constraints in others
and these results were more obvious for GroEL3 than for
GroEL2 compared to GroEL1. Examination of the sites
under functional constraints in GroEL3 provided evidence
supporting the involvement of these sites in ATP binding
(G86, homologous to G86 in E. coli), substrate and GroES
binding (P235, homologous to P236 in E. coli) [21] and
interaction and folding of protein clients in the GroEL
central cavity (K362 and D397 homologous to K363 and
D397, respectively in E. coli) [13]. These results suggest
that functional divergence might have affected the interaction mainly between GroEL3 and its protein clients and to
a lesser extent between GroEL2 and GroEL protein clients.

We also examined the effect that mutations between the
different GroEL protein copies have on the protein structure. We modeled three-dimensional structures for
GroEL1, GroEL2 and GroEL3 by homology to Escherichia
coli GroEL protein using the program 3D-JIGSAW [22-24].
We then compared these structures using the Root Mean
Square Deviation (RMSD) of the different atoms calculated as:

RMSD =

1 N 2
â di
N i =1

Here, d is the atomic distance and N is the total number
of atoms in the protein crystal. So for the comparison
between proteins A and B, d will equal:

di =

( Xai â Xbi )2 + ( Yai â Ybi )2 + ( Zai â Zbi )2

Here, we are comparing the mean distance between
amino acids a and b belonging to proteins A and B respectively by comparing their coordinates in the three space
axes. This comparison did not detect any significant structural differences among the three GroEL proteins or
between them and E. coli GroEL protein (The distances
were all below 3.5Ã). Results then suggest that amino acid
replacements did not involve structural changes but rather
may have induced functional shifts between GroEL protein copies.
Although no major structural changes seem to be related
to sites under functional constraints we examined
whether sites with varying degrees of selective constraints
in the different GroEL copies show differences in the folding energy of the local GroEL structures. The performance
of different methods to analyze local folding energies has
been recently elegantly examined [25]. In their work, Rastogi et al., tested the accuracy of different models to predict the most stable structure or folding for four sets of
proteins, Globin-like, SH3 domain, SH2 domain and Flavodoxin-like proteins. We used this methodology to look
at folding-energy related differences at those sites under
different functional constraints when comparing GroEL
copies (for example, highly constrained amino acid sites
in one GroEL copy but showing lack of constraints at
another GroEL protein copy) and estimated the significance of these differences. We calculated this significance
by comparing our folding-energy results with a distribution of folding energies for a 1000 randomly generated set
of peptides sharing the same length and composition as
the local fold of our proteins. We did the analyses using
scripts and programs kindly provided by the group of
Prof. Liberles. Our comparisons showed no significant
differences in those sites under functional divergence
when comparing the different mutant versions of the pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/81

tein at those sites. In conclusion hence the mutations
under varying functional constraints between GroEL copies lineages did not show significant variability in the local
folding energies (Data not shown). Although apparently
negative, the examination of the effects of mutations on
protein structures is anything but straightforward. The reason is that two main factors have to be considered in such
analyses. First, structures and folds are very flexible to
mutations [26-28] and slight changes on function do not
have to imply significant changes on protein-structure or
folding. Second, the effect of several mutations on the
protein structure may interact, with single mutations having little effect while combined mutations having large
effects on the stability of local protein folds. More research
is needed to identify the real effects of mutations on protein folds and structures.
Differential coevolution among Chlamydiae GroEL
proteins
Functional divergence analyses detect divergence of two
proteins at particular sites and evolutionary time points
but do not provide a measure of the amount of decoupled
evolution between the proteins after gene duplication. For
example, functional divergence may have occurred
between two proteins at particular sites without affecting
the remaining protein sequence. In our particular case, we
would not expect greater coevolution of GroEL1 with
GroEL2 than with GroEL3 when averaging the coevolution parameter throughout the multiple sequence alignment. To quantify how much each of the GroEL paralogs
has diverged not only functionally at particular sites but
also in their evolutionary paths from GroEL1, we applied
mutual information based coevolution analyses (see
methods for details) between GroEL1 and GroEL2 and
GroEL1 and GroEL3. Analysis of coevolution between
pairs of GroEL proteins highlighted an interesting pattern
that was coincident with the results of functional divergence among these proteins. We used the mutual information criterion (MIC) value as a measure of the amount of
coevolution (for example, MIC ranging between zero,
when sites evolve independently, and a positive value proportional to the amount of coevolution). To compare the
coevolution of GroEL1 vs GroEL2 to GroEL1 vs GroEL3,
we divided MIC values into 10 categories ranging between
0 < MIC > 0.5 with intervals of 0.05, estimated the proportion of sites within each category in the two sets of analyses and compared these proportions between the two
coevolutionary analyses (see Methods for details).
GroEL1 showed a greater mean MIC coevolution value
(20% higher) with GroEL2 compared to GroEL3. In fact,
most of the sites from GroEL1 coevolving with GroEL3
presented very low MIC values, indicating poor coevolution (Figure 2). In contrast, GroEL2 presented very high
MIC values compared to GroEL3, indicating stronger
coevolution with GroEL1 (Figure 2). In addition, most of

Page 5 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:81

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/81

the MIC values were above 0.2 suggesting strong coevolution. These values are in the range of MIC values obtained
in previous studies examining the coevolution between
amino acid sites involved in the interaction between proteins [29]. These results indicate together with the functional divergence analysis that in fact the three GroEL
proteins have functionally diverged. They also indicate
that GroEL2 evolved independently of GroEL1 to a certain
extent but that GroEL3 show significant and more pronounced independent evolution from GroEL1 than
GroEL2 does. This points to the fact that GroEL2 and especially GroEL3 may have probably evolved toward performing different regulatory mechanisms as previously
suggested [15]. Their differential coevolution is also supported by data based on the analysis of the promoter
regions of groEL1, groEL2 and groEL3 that show that
groEL2 and groEL3 promoter regions in serovar D of C. trachomatis lack CIRCE (Controlling Inverted Repeat of
Chaperone Expression) region as well as the putative Ï66
promoter element [30].
To further examine the selection shifts between the three
GroEL protein copies we also investigated the intra-GroEL
molecular coevolution and identified the differences in
the coevolutionary relationships between amino acid sites
among the three GroEL copies. Comparison of the coevolutionary relationships in GroEL1 to those in GroEL2
showed that while many coevolutionary relationships
have been conserved in both copies (For example, amino
1

acid pairs P217-R429, Q347-R429, Q347-P449, I348R429, I348-P449, I348-A529, N432-P449, taking E. coli
GroEL as reference sequence) other relationships have
been lost in GroEL2 (D11-A404, L17-A340, L131-A340,
A340-A404). Both groups of amino acid coevolving pairs
include amino acid sites involved in the interaction with
protein clients in the GroEL complex cavity. Interestingly,
the level of coevolution between the set of pairs unique to
GroEL1 (MIC = 0.225 Â± 0.001) was lower than the level of
coevolution for the set of pairs of sites conserved in both
proteins GroEL1 and GroEL2 (MIC = 0.264 Â± 0.034), indicating conservation of the main coevolutionary relationships, which are probably those highly involved in
interaction with protein clients. Most interesting is the fact
that GroEL3 showed no conservation of any of the intramolecular amino acid site pairs coevolutionary relationships when compared to GroEL1 or GroEL2, thus pinpointing its unique evolutionary divergence and probable
functional divergence from the other GroEL copies.
In addition, all of the groEL2 and groEL3 copies are
expressed as previously shown and their non-synonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide substitutions rates ratio

d
( Ï = N ) indicate they are performing a distinct physiodS
logical function but that all of the groEL gene copies are
functionally important since they are subjected to strong
selective constraints (Ï < 1; Table 2). These relaxed selective constraints may have occurred during the first stages
after gene duplication.

Coevolution analysis of GroEL protein with its paralogs in Chlamydiae. We used the mutual information criterion (MIC) to compare the coevolution of GroEL1 vs
GroEL2 (black bars) to that of GroEL1 vs GroEL3 (grey
bars). We built ten MIC categories and calculated the percentage of pairs showing significant coevolution within each
category (number of pairs in that MIC category divided by
the total number of coevolving pairs for the comparison) in
each comparison. We estimated the mean percentage of
pairs per MIC category and compared both sets of data.

To investigate the difference in regulatory roles between
the GroEL protein copies, we tested the strength of coevolution using the same approach as above but now
between each GroEL protein copy and a set of client proteins shown to depend upon GroEL to acquire their productive functional conformation in E. coli. This analysis
has the advantage of being relative in its interpretation
because protein clients examined here are known to
require GroEL to acquire productive folding and are therefore GroEL protein clients in the different bacteria examined here [31]. We were not interested in the range of new
clients emerging after groEL gene duplication but rather in
the variation of coevolution between each GroEL protein
copy and the known protein clients. This test can shed
some light on the question of whether functional divergence also meant divergence in the interaction patterns
with each one of the different client proteins. If that was
the case then we would expect that the GroEL protein copy
that is more functionally divergent from the ancestral
GroEL should show lower mean MIC values when tested
against each protein set, indicating lower mean coevolution with these GroEL protein clients. Indeed, the percentage of sites from protein clients presenting high MIC

values (MIC > 0.3) of coevolution was greater when they
were tested in protein-protein coevolution analyses
against GroEL1, than against GroEL2 and was higher
against GroEL2 than GroEL3, coinciding with our functional divergence analyses (Figure 3A). The difference was
also significant, with GroEL1 presenting an average of
2.42 times stronger coevolution with the protein clients
than GroEL2, and GroEL2 presenting 2.16 times stronger
coevolution with GroEL clients than GroEL3 (Figure 3B).
Results hence support functional divergence between
GroEL protein copies. Because of the divergence in the different coevolutionary strengths of GroEL protein paralogs
and their protein clients, results also suggest that this functional divergence may have been followed by the divergence in the GroEL proteins regulatory and protein
interaction networks.
Recurrent adaptive evolution after groEL gene duplication
Here we conducted tests to further demonstrate the adaptive fixation of amino acid replacements in the GroEL protein copies after gene duplication. The rationale behind
this analysis is that because of the various stages in
Chlamydiae infections (infectious and persistent cycles)
we hypothesize that the different GroEL protein copies are
performing distinct functions, as their expression levels
are different. We have also shown in this study that the
GroEL copies are functionally divergent and that this
divergence can be related to the specific ability of the different GroEL proteins to interact with the sets of proteins
known to require the assistance of E. coli GroEL protein to
acquire their productive conformation. Analysis of the
sequences using the maximum-likelihood and maximumparsimony based approaches (see methods for details)
yielded very similar results that pointed to the adaptive
evolution of amino acid replacements in the branches of
the tree leading to GroEL2 and GroEL3 (Figure 4A). In the
case of maximum-likelihood based analysis implemented
in the program PAML, the model assuming different Ï
values for the different branches of the tree (called Freeratio model, FRM, see Methods) was significantly better
than the Goldman and Yang model (G&Y) that assumes
one Ï value for the entire phylogeny (LRT = 229.056; P <
0.001). The FRM only highlighted four branches to be
under adaptive evolution (with Ï values significantly
greater than 1), including the two leading to GroEL2 and

GroEL3, and those leading to each one of the groups to
the exclusion of Parachlamydia species (for example, after
the split separating Parachlamydia from Chlamydiae species) (Figure 4A). The parsimony based procedure implemented in the program SWAPSC also gave similar results
indicating adaptive evolution after gene duplication in the
branches separating Parachlamydia and Chlamydiae species
and in that branch leading to GroEL3, but not in that leading to GroEL2. On average, the Ï values taken from
SWAPSC and PAML results for the branches under adaptive evolution ranged between (26 < Ï < 264) in the
branch leading to GroEL2, (2.5 < Ï < 11.30) in the branch
leading to GroEL3, and (1.64 < Ï < 20.51) and (1.22 < Ï
< 18.66) after the separation between Parachlamydia and
Chlamydiae species in GroEL2 and GroEL3 groups, respectively. Due to the high values of Ï in the branch leading
to GroEL2 group, we examined the dS values to determine
whether these Ï values were inflated due to low dS values
estimates in PAML. Detailed examination of the dN and dS
values in this branch showed that the high Ï values were
indeed the result of dS values being close to zero rather
than to real increase in the fixation rate of amino acid
replacements throughout the evolution of this group. We
therefore could not conclude if GroEL2 was undoubtedly
under adaptive evolution after the duplication leading to
GroEL3 and GroEL2. Adopting a conservative view,
GroEL3 was the protein showing the greatest amount of
adaptive evolution, being coincident with the fact that
this protein showed the greatest amount of functional
divergence and decoupled evolution from GroEL1.
Examination of sites under adaptive evolution with significant posterior probabilities (PP > 0.95) identified sites
involved in substrate binding and sites located in the central cavity of GroEL ring pointing toward the cavity and
very probably involved in interaction with GroEL protein
clients (Figure 4B). Taking all the results from the functional divergence analyses, protein-protein coevolution
analyses and the adaptive evolution in each paralog
group, we identified regions in the GroEL1 paralogs,
GroEL2 and GroEL3, involved in interaction with proteins
that have undergone changes in their selective constraints
after gene duplication (Figure 4B). These results suggest
that groEL gene duplication in Chlamydiae may have been
followed by the GroEL paralogs' functional divergence

Coevolution analyses of GroEL proteins with known protein clients for Escherichia coli GroEL
Coevolution analyses of GroEL proteins with known protein clients for Escherichia coli GroEL. We built ten MIC
categories and calculated the percentage of pairs showing significant coevolution within each category (number of pairs in that
MIC category divided by the total number of coevolving pairs for the comparison) in each comparison. We estimated the mean
percentage of pairs per MIC category and comparison and compared the sets of data. A) Mean MIC values resulted from coevolution analyses of GroEL1 with the different protein clients (black bars), was compared to those MIC values for GroEL2 vs
protein clients (grey bars) and GroEL3 vs protein clients (white bars). To better account for the distribution of MIC values in
each set of coevolutionary analyses, we multiplied the % of pairs of coevolving sites in each category per 100 and per the Mean
MIC value for that category and normalised the mean values obtained for all the categories in each GroEL set of comparisons
as to determine the increment of coevolution between the GroEL copies and GroEL clients (B).

toward acquiring different regulatory roles and establishing different protein-protein interaction network
geometries.
Whether the functional divergence between the duplicated GroEL proteins meant the acquisition of completely
novel functions or the subfunctionalization of the proteins copies is unclear. Placing our results into a model
that supports subfunctionalization or into one that proposes neofunctionalization as the fate for gene copies
after duplication requires taking into account population
genetics parameters [32]. In principle, duplicated genes
are lost more slowly in organisms with small effective
population sizes than in those with large population sizes.
The reason is that selection against harmful mutations is
weaker in population with small sizes and disadvantageous mutations can drift to fixation. Gene copies resulting from gene duplication have hence more evolutionary
time (opportunities) to accumulate advantageous mutations and survive despite the build up of harmful mutations. Because degenerative mutations greatly outnumber
beneficial mutations the probability of neofunctionalization in small populations is rare whereas subfunctionali-

zation is more likely to occur in these populations
[33,34].
The effective population sizes of prokaryotes are considered large enough as to preclude any opportunity for subfunctionalization. However in unicellular pathogenic
organisms, such as the Chlamydiae species analyzed in this
work, their genetic effective population sizes may be
greatly dependent on their multicellular hosts, which
present significantly lower population sizes. In such a scenario, the genetic drift effect increases and selective constraints strength decreases, incrementing thus the
probability of gene copy preservation and subfunctionalization after gene duplication. GroEL protein in Chlamydiae may be a striking example of such process taken to
completion at the interactome level.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that GroEL protein copies in
Chlamydiae species have diverged functionally after the
gene duplication events. Our comprehensive bioinformatics analysis yields results that are in accordance with
previously published experimental and functional data

and provides further support to the divergence in the
physiological and regulatory roles of the different GroEL
protein copies. We also provide evidence that GroEL3
(Ct755) is more divergent from GroEL1 (Ct110) than
GroEL2 (Ct604) and that this divergence was due to the
fixation of amino acid replacements that modified the
functional constraints in specific amino acid sites in
GroEL3. Coevolution analyses performed here also support the high divergence of GroEL3 and provide further
evidence that the three different GroEL copies have different interaction patterns with previously identified GroEL1
protein clients, further supporting their different regulatory roles. Finally, analysis of selective constraints supports the adaptive fixation of amino acid replacements
after gene duplication mainly leading to GroEL3 and that
this fixation affected functional sites involved in interaction with protein clients. Based on these analyses and conclusions we propose conducting comprehensive proteinprotein interaction analyses between the different GroEL
protein copies in Chlamydiae and the known GroEL protein clients to fully understand their functional and regulatory divergence and their role in the epidemiology,
developmental and persistent stages of Chlamydiae infections.

Methods
The aim of this study is to test the functional divergence
between the different GroEL copies in Chlamydiae and
provide a list of amino acid sites that may be responsible
for such functional divergence, thereby detailing the functional differences among the copies. Aside from in silico
testing of the functional divergence between the GroEL
protein copies, we are interested in the quantification of
such divergence and the identification of the effects of
such divergence in the function of each copy. Finally, we
test the effect such divergence has on the interaction of
GroEL copies with previously identified GroEL-dependent
protein clients [31] and we highlight the selective constraints operating in each GroEL paralog.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences coding for GroEL1 (Ct110), GroEL2
(Ct604) and GroEL3 (Ct755) were retrieved from the
GeneBank database for the different species of Chlamydiae. The sequences, species names and the protein-coding
sequence accession numbers are provided in table 1 of
additional file 1. We aligned protein sequences using the
program ClustalX [35] with the default settings. We then
aligned nucleotide sequences concatenating triplets of
nucleotides according to the multiple protein sequence
alignment (alignments are available from the authors on
request). Together with the groEL gene sequence we also
obtained alignments for client proteins shown to depend
on E. coli GroEL to acquire a productive (functional) protein conformation [31]. We obtained the sequences for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/81

each one of the Chlamydiae species or strains from GenBank and the accession numbers are provided in Table 2
of additional file 2. We then aligned the sequences for
each one of the protein-coding genes following the same
procedure detailed above.
Regarding phylogenetic analyses, for each one of the multiple sequence alignments we first used ModelTest 1.3
[36] to determine the best candidate substitution rate
matrix for maximum likelihood inference. The program
pinpointed TrN + I + G as first option. We used then the
output generated by ModelTest as input for the program
PAUP [26] and inferred a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for the alignment containing the three different
GroEL protein-coding sequences using the heuristic
approach.
Analysis of functional divergence
To identify amino acid replacements responsible for functional divergence between the GroEL proteins, we tested
functional divergence Type I [37,38] in the multiple protein sequence alignment containing the three different
GroEL copies of Chlamydiae after each gene duplication
event. The Gu method uses a maximum-likelihood procedure to test whether there has been a significant change in
the rate of evolution after gene duplication leading to the
two paralogs. This method tests for functional divergence
by estimating the log-likelihood value of the hypothesis
assuming a value for the coefficient of functional divergence (Î¸ > 0) and comparing this likelihood with that
under the hypothesis of no functional divergence (Î¸ = 0).
Because both models are nested, they can be compared by
the Likelihood-ratio test (LRT), which can be approximated to a Ï2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom. If the
null hypothesis of no-functional divergence is rejected,
the program calculates a posterior probability (PP) for a
position being classified within the category of functional
divergence. We established a cutoff value for the PP
according to the effect that the elimination of the sets of
amino acid sites having a PP value equal or higher than
that cutoff value have on the Î¸-value test [38].

We tested functional divergence between GroEL1 and the
cluster containing GroEL2 and 3, and between GroEL2
and GroEL3 using the program Diverge version 2.0 [39].
We then mapped the events of functional divergence in
the phylogenetic tree including the two duplication events
that gave rise to the three GroEL protein copies.
Testing coevolution between GroEL copies
One of the questions we aimed answering was whether
GroEL2 and GroEL3 diverged equally from GroEL1 or
whether one of them presented less evidence for shared
functions with GroEL1. A good way to test this hypothesis
is by examining the coevolutionary patterns between the

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:81

different GroEL copies. The stronger the coevolution
between the proteins the greater would be the amount of
shared evolutionary pattern and thus the greater the likelihood of sharing more functions. To test the hypothesis
of coevolution between proteins we used the non-parametric method based on the mutual information criterion
(MIC) developed by Korber and colleagues [40]. The
mutual information is represented by the entropies that
involve the joint probability distribution, P(si, s'j), of
occurrence of symbol i at position s and j at position s' of
the multiple sequence alignment. The MIC values generated range between 0, indicating independent evolution,
and a positive value whose magnitude depends on the
amount of covariation. Variable positions included in the
alignment and considered in the coevolutionary analyses
were those parsimony-informative (i.e. they contain at
least two types of amino acids and at least two of them
occur with a minimum frequency of two). The significance of the MIC values was assessed by randomization of
pairs of sites in the alignment, calculation of their MIC
values and comparison of the real values with the distribution of one million randomly sampled values. To correct for multiple non-independent tests we implemented
the step-down permutation procedure and corrected the
probabilities accordingly [31]. MICK is implemented in
the program PECA (Available from the corresponding
author on request).
Testing for protein-protein interaction divergence
between GroEL copies and protein clients
One of the hypotheses we wanted to test was whether
functional divergence between the different GroEL copies
also involved a divergence in their coevolutionary patterns with known GroEL protein clients. To test this
hypothesis we analysed the coevolution of each GroEL
copy with each one of the known GroEL protein clients
using the methodology described in the previous section.
The strength of the coevolutionary pattern was calculated
by classifying significant MIC values into the categories
(0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, MIC >
0.50). Here 0.1 included all those pairs of amino acid sites
with MIC values 0 < MIC â¤ 0.1; 0.15 would include 0.1 <
MIC â¤ 0.15, and so on and so forth. This categorization of
MIC values allows the direct comparison of the coevolutionary results between different pairs of proteins regardless the set of MIC values obtained in each analysis. To
quantify the contribution of each category to the overall
MIC value, we first counted the number of pairs of sites
showing MIC values within that category. We then calculated the percentage of pairs of sites included in that category by dividing the number of sites in the category by the
total number of pairs of sites detected as coevolving significantly. This way, the contribution of each MIC category
between pairs of proteins is comparable.

Analysis of selective constraints
The final step in the analysis of functional divergence is
the mapping of selective constraints in the protein structure after each duplication event. Here we tested whether
functional divergence was the result of the adaptive fixation of amino acid replacements at functional protein
regions in GroEL copies. To test this hypothesis we
applied two methodologies. First, we applied a slidingwindow parsimony-based approach to detect selective
constraints in protein-coding genes [41], implemented in
the program SWAPSC version 1.0 [42]. Briefly, the program slides a statistically optimum window size along the
sequence alignment to detect selective constraints and
estimates the probability of replacements per non-synonymous sites (dN) and substitutions per synonymous sites

(dS). The window size is optimized by means of using a
number of simulated data sets. The standard way to measure the intensity of selection when analysing DNA variability is by comparing dS to dN [43,44]. The ratio between

d
the two rates ( Ï = N ) helps to elucidate if the gene has
dS
been fixing amino acid replacements neutrally (Ï = 1),
replacements have been removed by purifying selection
(Ï < 1), or mutations have been fixed by adaptive evolution (Ï > 1). It has been shown, however, that Ï is a poor
indicator of the action of adaptive evolution due to the
fact that signals of adaptive evolution may be swamped in
the background of purifying selection under which the
protein has evolved most over its evolutionary time [44].
SWAPSC uses Ï to estimate the intensity of selection acting on a protein-coding region at particular branches of
the tree. We used 1000 simulated data sets in our analysis
obtained using the program Evolver from the PAML package [36]. To perform the simulations we took as initial
parameters the average Ï value, transition-to-transversion
rates and codon table generated under the Goldman and
Yang model, using the real sequence alignment as input.
The program then slides the window along the real
sequence alignment and estimates dN and dS by the Li's
method. The program determines significance of these
estimates under a Poisson distribution of nucleotide substitutions along the alignment.
In addition we tested adaptive evolution using the maximum-likelihood based approach implemented in the program PAML v3.15 (Yang 1997). We then compared the
log-likelihood value of a model (Goldman and Yang
model, hereon called G&Y) [45] that assumes one Ï for
the whole alignment and phylogenetic tree to a model
that estimates an Ï value for each branch of the phylogePage 11 of 13

netic tree (hereon called the free-ratio model FRM). We
compared both likelihood values using the Likelihood
ratio test (LRT) with the degrees of freedom being the
number of branches in the tree minus 1.
