Rate of sequence divergence under constant
selection
Alexey S Kondrashov1, Inna S Povolotskaya2, Dmitry N Ivankov2,3, Fyodor A Kondrashov2*

Abstract
Background: Divergence of two independently evolving sequences that originated from a common ancestor can
be described by two parameters, the asymptotic level of divergence E and the rate r at which this level of
divergence is approached. Constant negative selection impedes allele replacements and, therefore, is routinely
assumed to decelerate sequence divergence. However, its impact on E and on r has not been formally
investigated.
Results: Strong selection that favors only one allele can make E arbitrarily small and r arbitrarily large. In contrast,
in the case of 4 possible alleles and equal mutation rates, the lowest value of r, attained when two alleles confer
equal fitnesses and the other two are strongly deleterious, is only two times lower than its value under selective
neutrality.
Conclusions: Constant selection can strongly constrain the level of sequence divergence, but cannot reduce
substantially the rate at which this level is approached. In particular, under any constant selection the divergence
of sequences that accumulated one substitution per neutral site since their origin from the common ancestor must
already constitute at least one half of the asymptotic divergence at sites under such selection.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Drs. Nicolas Galtier, Sergei Maslov, and Nick Grishin.

Background
Constant selection mostly manifests itself as negative selection, because permanently beneficial alleles tend to become
common. Negative selection constrains and decelerates
evolution. Slower evolution of more functionally important
nucleotide sites, such as nonsynonymous coding sites,
compared to less important sites, such as synonymous
sites, is one of the most pervasive patterns in evolution at
the sequence level and reflects ubiquity of negative selection and relative rarity of positive selection. Constant selection can accelerate evolution when it favors more mutable
alleles [1], but the magnitude of this effect is substantial
only when a number of conditions are met [2].
Still, the impact of constant selection on the rate of
evolution, manifested in the dynamics of divergence of
two independently evolving sequences that originated
from a common ancestor, is not as simple as one might
think, and should be viewed from two complementary

perspectives. Indeed, constant selection affects both 1)
the asymptotic value of sequence divergence E, reached
by two sequences after a long time, and 2) the rate r at
which the divergence between two sequences
approaches E. Here, we separately study the impact of
constant selection on E and on r.

Model
Consider one locus (site) with I alleles A1, ... AI with frequencies x1, ..., xI, and fitnesses 1, 1-s2, ... 1-sI, where si are
coefficients of selection (without loss of generality, the fitness of one of the alleles can be assumed to be 1). A population is either haploid or diploid with intermediate
dominance. The rate of mutation of the ith allele into the
jth allele is μi, j, and the effective size of the population is
Ne. We assume that Neμi, j<<1 for all i, j, so that most of
the time one of the alleles is fixed in the population [3],
and the dynamics of the model consists of allele replacements occurring at a site at random moments. We consider dynamics of divergence of two long sequences of
sites, all with the same properties, that were identical at
the moment when they originated from their last common

ancestor and evolved independently after this moment.
The level of divergence D will be characterized by the fraction of homologous sites occupied by different alleles.

Results
Asymptotic value of divergence E

Obviously, after enough time passes since the moment
when two sequences begun to diverge, all traces of overrandom similarity between them are lost, and D reaches
its asymptotic value E, given by

where X i is the equilibrium value of x i under given
mutation and selection. Xi can be found from a set of I
linear equations (eq. 10 from [3]; eq. (11) below presents
this set in the case of I = 4). A strong enough constant
selection favoring one allele over all others can make E
arbitrarily close to 0.
The rate r of approaching E: selective neutrality

Let us now concentrate on how D approaches E. We
will characterize the rate of this approach by r, the
power of an exponential decline of the deviation of D
from E, and, equivalently, by the half-approach period τ
= ln2/r. Indeed, we will see that D approached E exactly
(in special cases) or approximately (in the general case)
exponentially.
Let us first consider the case of no selection: si = 0 for
all i. Let us also assume that μi, j = μ for all i, j. Then,

The rate r of approaching E: two alleles with selection

Let us now consider the case of only two alleles A1 and
A2, under an arbitrary selection, described by s2 = s. We
will keep the assumption that μi, j = μ for all i, j, which
in this case simply means that the rates of reciprocal
mutations are the same. The dynamics of D are
described by (5)
where xi, j is the frequency of pairs of sites occupied
by allele Ai in one sequence and allele Aj in the other
sequence (due to symmetry of the two sequences, we
will use this notation assuming that i ≤ j), and fi, j is the
rate at which allele i is replaced with allele j. Then, D =
x1,2 and x1,1 = x1 - 0.5D, because x1 = 0.5x1,2+ x1,1. Analogously, x2,2 = 1-x1 - 0.5D, because x2+ x1 = 1.
Let us assume that the ancestral sequence from which
the two sequences under consideration begun their
independent divergence had already attained equilibrium
allele composition. Then, x 1 = X 1 is invariant and is
equal to eS/(eS+ 1) (eq. 6 from [3]). According to eq. 7
from [3], f1,2 = -μS/(1-eS) and f2,1 = μS/(1-e-S), where S =
4Nes, in the case of diploidy. Thus, the equation (5) can
be written as:

It is easy to show that r(S) has a single minimum at S
= 0. Therefore, with only two permitted alleles the lowest rate r(0) = 4 μ of approaching E, and the longest
half-approach period τ = ln2/(4μ) is achieved under neutrality (4), where the value of E = 1/2 is the highest,
because X 1 = X 2 . When S increases, E rapidly
approaches zero, and r(S) slowly increases without a
limit (Figure 2). A more general case of unequal rates of
reciprocal mutations can also be considered using eq. 7
from [3].

The rate r of approaching E: general 4-allele case

Let us now consider the general case with I = 4. Here it
will be more convenient to use letters A, T, G, and C to
denote the four alleles. With 4 alleles under selection, D
becomes dynamically insufficient, and the divergence of
sequences needs to be described in terms of frequencies
of the six possible mismatches xi, j ([5], eq. 1):

under the assumption that xA+ xT+ xG+ xC = 1. D is
the sum of all the six variables in (10).
Numerical investigation of (10) revealed the following
facts:
1) D approaches E strictly exponentially only in the
case of just two permitted alleles. Otherwise the
approach is decelerating: the time it takes for D to
decline from 0 to E/2, t0,1/2 is shorter than the time t1/
2,3/4 during which D declines from E/2 to 3E/4. However, this effect is weak: t1/2,3/4 never exceeds t0,1/2 by
more than 10%. Thus, we can safely regard t0,1/2 as the
half-approach period τ.
2) D approaches E at a rate that cannot be below r =
4 μ, which is only 2 times less than r = 8 μ, the rate
for the case of 4 neutral alleles (S2 = S3 = S4 = 0) (eq
4). This lowest r = 4 μ was observed only in the case
of 2 neutral alleles (S2 = 0; S3 = S4-> 8) (eq 9). In contrast, r can be arbitrarily large, but this happens only
when just one allele is strongly favored (S2, S3, S4-> 8)

(eq 9). When selection is moderate (S ≤ 2), 4 μ < r <8
μ (Figure 3).
3) If the assumption of equal mutation rates is relaxed,
the expected value of r under a particular mode of
selection does not change much (Figure 4).

Discussion
We have found a contrast between how constant selection affects the asymptotic level of divergence of independently evolving sequences E and the rate r at which
this level is approached. While E always declines and
can be affected arbitrarily strongly, r can both increase
and decrease. The increase of r can be arbitrarily large,
and occurs under conditions when E approaches 0, i. e.
when selection strongly favors one allele over all others.
However, r cannot decline by more than a factor of two
(assuming equal rates of all mutations) relative to the
case of 4 selectively neutral alleles, with the lowest r
attained when two alleles have equal high fitnesses and
the other alleles are strongly selected against. Unequal
mutation rates apparently do not affect this conclusion.
Of course, if selection coincidently permits only those
two alleles that rarely mutate into each other, it can
lead to an arbitrary decrease of r. However, in a general
situation, unequal mutation rates do not substantially
affect the impact of selection on r.
In other words, the highest, for the case of 4 alleles,
asymptotic divergence E = 3/4 is approached with a
half-approach period τ = ln2/(8 μ) ≈ 0.087 μ-1, which is
neither the shortest nor the longest possible under constant selection. However, the longest possible half-

Page 4 of 8

approach period τmax = ln2/(4 μ) ≈ 0.173 μ-1, is just two
times longer. Thus, the assertion that constant selection
impedes evolution mostly describes its impact on the
asymptotic level of divergence, and not on the rate at
which this level is attained.
After D travels half of its way to E in the case of 4
neutral alleles, D = 3/8. For this D, application of JukesCantor formula [4], (eq. 4.2) produces the following
value of the per-site number of nucleotide substitutions
per a selectively neutral site:
K 1/2,neutral  

3
4D
3
ln(1 
)  ln(2)  0.52
4
3
4

(11)

Indeed, under selective neutrality the rate of evolution
is equal to mutation rate, so that K1/2, neutral = 6 μτneutral
with I = 4, and τ neutral = ln2/(8 μ) in this case. Thus,
because constant selection cannot reduce the rate of
approaching E by more that a factor of 2, at all kinds of
sites under constant selection divergence between two
species with Kneutral = 1.04 must already represent, at
the very least, 50% of their equilibrium divergence, as
long as the allelic composition of the diverging
sequences was at equilibrium from the very beginning.
And divergence of all orthologous sequences that are
under constant selection in species with K neutral > 5
must be already very close to its asymptotic level.
It did not escape our attention that the dynamics of
divergence of functionally important sequences are
usually inconsistent with this key property of the model
considered here: orthologous sequences keep diverging

even between very evolutionarily remote genomes.
There would be little hope to reconstruct the history of
a molecule from extant sequences if selection coefficients were constant in time. In this case, sequences
having diverged long enough would essentially include
only invariant (strongly selected) and saturated (weakly
selected) sites. Since we know that protein sequences
can actually help in measuring divergences and building
deep phylogenies, this suggests that variations in time of
Ne and/or of selection coefficients at individual sites are
common, and that their rate of change is what controls
in the first place the amount of amino-acid differences
between distantly related extant sequences.

This manuscript implements a very good idea, namely
injecting population genetic parameters, typically used
to model microevolution, in substitution matrices, typically used to model long-term sequence evolution. The
two must be connected in principle, yet classical Markov
models used in phylogenetics are made of arbitrary
parameters.

Figure 4 The same as Figure 3, but, for each mode of selection, the half-approach period presented in the average of its values
obtained under 1000 randomly generated matrices of μi, j, in which values of μi, j were drawn independently from a uniform
distribution that varied between 0.5 and 1.5 and the matrices were symmetric (solid lines) or arbitrary (dotted lines).

These theoretical results are good to know and keep
in mind, even though they perhaps do not apply so frequently to real data, as correctly acknowledged, given
the assumptions of constant in time population size and
selection coefficients. At any rate, this piece might stimulate other studies trying to understand long-term
sequence evolution in the light of population genetics.
Here are a couple of more specific comments.
1. I am not sure if the model is haploid or diploid.
Diploidy is apparently assumed at some stage, but since
there is no description of the fitness of a diploid

genotype, I guess codominance is assumed. In this case,
the diploid model is equivalent to the haploid one, so I
would suggest to keep it haploid throughout for simplicity. Or if you make it diploid, please discuss dominance
effects.
Indeed, this needed to be clarified. Bulmer’s framework we used can handle either haploidy or diploidy
with codonimance. We assumed the latter case, but
the only difference this made is that S = 4N e s,
instead of S = 2N e s with haploidy. This is now
stated.

2. I feel like a better job could be made in accounting
for, and referring to, the 80’s/90’s literature on Markov
models for pairwise distance calculation between
sequences. The papers by Rodriguez et al [5] and Lockhart et al [6], for instance, include equations very close
to equation 10 of this manuscript. The matrix expressions and calculations used in these papers might help,
by the way - I suspect that the numerical exploration of
equation 10 performed by the authors could be done
analytically. Once you have expressed the substitution
rate from allele i to allele j in terms of mutation, selection and drift, you are within Rodriguez’s formalism.
Indeed, we needed to cite Rodriguez et al.[5],
because our eq. 10 is essentially identical to theirs
basic equation 1. However, as Dr. Galtier noted,
Rodriguez et al. [5]did not study the dependence of
solution to this equation on mutation and selection
parameters separately; instead they only considered
fluxes of allele substitutions. In contrast, we do not
see how our results are related to that of Lockhart et
al.[6], because they were primarily concerned with
taking into account different nucleotide compositions of different sequences, and we, as well as
Rodriguez et al.[6], assumed these to be invariant. Of
course, our eq. 10 can, as a system of linear ordinary
differential equation, be solved analytically using
matrix exponents. However, it will probably still be
necessary to investigate this solution numerically, to
understand its properties.
3. If I understand correctly, this manuscript demonstrates
that there would be little hope to reconstruct the history of
a molecule from extant sequences if selection coefficients
were constant in time. In this case, sequences having
diverged long enough would essentially include only invariant (strongly selected) and saturated (weakly selected) sites.
Since we know that protein sequences can actually help in
measuring divergences and building deep phylogenies, this
suggests that variations in time of Ne and s are common,
and that their rate of change is what controls in the first
place the amount of amino-acid differences between extant
sequences - at least as far as nonadaptive changes are concerned. This conclusion is reminiscent of Gillespie’s
thoughts about the overdispersed molecular clock. It makes
the more or less clock-like behavior of many known molecules even more amazing to me.
We are very thankful for this interpretation of our
main conclusion, and we plagiarize it for Discussion
with minor changes, placing it at the very end of the
paper. In contrast, we do not see a direct correspondence between our results and Gillespie’s overdispersed molecular clock. Indeed, changes of selection,
which can lead to prolonged divergence, do not
necessarily need to occur at random moments of
time.

The conclusions of this study can be summarized in
the following statement: the strength of selection has a
relatively small effect of the rate at which the evolutionary steady state is approached. Authors offer detailed
derivations for the case of a locus consisting of a single
nucleotide site. Hence their number of alleles is limited
to 4 (A, C, G, and T). In cases where the selection
indeed operates at the level of a single nucleotide the
derivation presented in the manuscript is through and
exhaustive. The mathematically transparent summary of
the central results is contained in Eqs. (8) and (9).
I found the discussion part of this manuscript to be
somewhat cryptic. For example, I didn’t get the point
authors were trying to make by using the celebrated
Watson and Crick opening sentence in: “It did not
escape our attention that the dynamics of divergence of
functionally important sequences are usually inconsistent with this key property of the model considered
here”. What key property of their model authors are
talking about?
We expanded this place a bit, using insightful comments of Dr. Galtier. We believe that the main reason why our analysis may be interesting is that it
provides a proof by contradiction to the assertion
that selection at individual sites keeps constantly
changing, which has long been suspected but never
demonstrated convincingly. However, this is a separate story.
Another confusing part of the discussion is that after
deriving K_1/2,neutral = 0.52 in Eq. (12) the authors
state that sequences diverged to the level of
K_neutral = 2K_1/2,neutral = 1.04 represent at least
50% of their equilibrium divergence. I thought that is
exactly how K_1/2,neutral was defined. Why double it?
In short, I feel the manuscript would benefit from giving
a bit more details in the discussion session.
Double it because constant selection can, in the
extreme situation, half the rate at which the asymptotic level of divergence is approached. This is now
explained.
Another thing, I would like authors to better describe
what practical questions their mathematical observations
help to understand? I am shooting in the dark here but
do these results might explain a puzzlingly uniform rate
at which non-neutral substitutions accumulate in the
long-term evolutionary experiment by Lenski and collaborators [7]? Having a few concrete examples where the
mathematical treatment presented in the manuscript is
important would greatly improve the readability of the
manuscript.

One cannot be sure that Lenski’s lab data are relevant to our analysis. Indeed, they placed their bacteria in a novel environment, so their system reflects
a dynamics of adaptation and may not be at equilibrium, in contrast to our assumptions. We believe
that our analysis is important because it demonstrates that, in the long term, evolution of even conservative orthologs does not proceed under constant
selection.
