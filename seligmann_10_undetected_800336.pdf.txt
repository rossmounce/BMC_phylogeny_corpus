Undetected antisense tRNAs in mitochondrial
genomes?
Hervé Seligmann1,2

Abstract
Background: The hypothesis that both mitochondrial (mt) complementary DNA strands of tRNA genes code for
tRNAs (sense-antisense coding) is explored. This could explain why mt tRNA mutations are 6.5 times more
frequently pathogenic than in other mt sequences. Antisense tRNA expression is plausible because tRNA
punctuation signals mt sense RNA maturation: both sense and antisense tRNAs form secondary structures
potentially signalling processing. Sense RNA maturation processes by default 11 antisense tRNAs neighbouring
sense genes. If antisense tRNAs are expressed, processed antisense tRNAs should have adapted more for
translational activity than unprocessed ones. Four tRNA properties are examined: antisense tRNA 5′ and 3′ end
processing by sense RNA maturation and its accuracy, cloverleaf stability and misacylation potential.
Results: Processed antisense tRNAs align better with standard tRNA sequences with the same cognate than
unprocessed antisense tRNAs, suggesting less misacylations. Misacylation increases with cloverleaf fragility and
processing inaccuracy. Cloverleaf fragility, misacylation and processing accuracy of antisense tRNAs decrease with
genome-wide usage of their predicted cognate amino acid.
Conclusions: These properties correlate as if they adaptively coevolved for translational activity by some antisense
tRNAs, and to avoid such activity by other antisense tRNAs. Analyses also suggest previously unsuspected
particularities of aminoacylation specificity in mt tRNAs: combinations of competition between tRNAs on tRNA
synthetases with competition between tRNA synthetases on tRNAs determine specificities of tRNA amino
acylations. The latter analyses show that alignment methods used to detect tRNA cognates yield relatively robust
results, even when they apparently fail to detect the tRNA’s cognate amino acid and indicate high misacylation
potential.

Background
The genetic code maximizes both the number of offframe stop codons and the ability to form secondary
structure by coding sequences [1]. This suggests that
coding sequences have multiple functional dimensions,
beyond that of linear coding. Indeed, life history and
other fitness-related properties associate with each of
these non-coding, yet non-random properties of
mRNAs: off frame stop frequency [2,3]; and secondary
structure formation [4-7]. These observations suggest
that sequences should be considered from a perspective
of fulfilling multiple tasks. The fact that specific

sequences have multiple functions increases the difficulty of estimating the number of functional sequences
[8-11].
Considering the possibility of multiple functions could
explain some discrepancies from the neutral theory of
evolution. Analyses presented here suggest an additional
function for mitochondrial tDNA, that of antisense coding [12]. Such complementary strand (sense-antisense)
coding is likely for some proteins [13,14], at least in the
ancestral coding system [15-17]. Some evidence also
suggests it occurred for tRNAs, where tRNAs with complementary anticodons were presumably coded by complementary strands [18-20]. This is suggested, among
others, by complementarities existing between acceptor
stems of these tRNA pairs [21].

In human mitochondrial tRNAs, about 35% of known
polymorphisms are associated with diseases, as compared to 6% for sequences in the mitochondrial genome
that do not code for tRNAs (data in appendix of [22],
from [23-25]). This puzzle might be due to the fact that
mitochondrial tRNA genes have at least two functions
in addition to coding for tRNAs: they apparently function as replication origins [26-29], and hybridization
between the expressed tRNA and its complementary
tDNA regulates replication origin formation by the
tDNA [22]. The property examined here, antisense coding, could be an additional fourth function for mitochondrial tRNA genes.
Antisense RNAs usually function as repressors of the
sense RNA by hybridizing with their sense counterpart,
preventing its usual activity as single-stranded RNA
[30,31]. However, for tRNAs, the antisense molecule
could have a classical tRNA function in translation,
because antisense tRNAs frequently form cloverleaf secondary structures [32,33]. This hypothesis is particularly
relevant for vertebrate mitochondrial genomes: both
strands are transcribed in their entirety and matured
according to recognition of secondary structures formed
by tRNA sequences in the long unprocessed RNA transcript, a process called RNA maturation by tRNA punctuation [34,35]. In addition, sense-antisense coding is
also more likely in organisms with reduced genomes
[36], such as mitochondria.
Because sense RNA processing depends on secondary
structure formation by sense tRNA sequences, the same
process probably works for antisense tRNAs. This is an
obvious outcome of the complementary nature of DNA
or RNA double strands. However, processing by tRNA
punctuation is probably less frequent for antisense
tRNAs than for sense tRNAs because cloverleaf stabilities of antisense tRNAs (estimated by the structural
component of COVE calculated by tRNAscan-SE [37],
http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/, an online software designed to detect tRNAs) are generally weaker
than stabilities of their sense counterparts. Note that

COVE is not estimating thermodynamic stability, but is
an information-based index that measures covariation
between parts of the sequence, in relation to a generalized tRNA covariance model [38]. COVE estimates the
potential for cloverleaf formation. It is used here as an
estimate of potential capacity for cloverleaf formation by
the presumed tRNA sequence. Positive COVE values
indicate that the sequence has a greater tendency to
form a cloverleaf structure than random sequences, and
negative values less tendency than random sequences.
Regular mitochondrial sense RNA maturation processes both 5′ and 3′ extremities of two antisense tRNAs
(tRNA Gln and tRNA Ser UCN), and of 5 and 4 antisense tRNAs at their 5′ and 3′ extremities, respectively
(5′: Glu, Ile, Thr, Trp, Tyr; 3′: Ala, Asp, His, Pro). This
is schematically explained in Figure 1. This scenario
assumes that antisense tRNAs are not processed because
of their own capacity to form secondary structures
punctuating RNA processing, but because of tRNA
punctuation of sense RNA maturation by sense tRNAs.
Independently of whether processing of antisense tRNAs
occurs because their own secondary structure signals
processing, or because of signalling by sense tRNAs,
some experimental evidence confirms their existence:
mitochondrial antisense tRNAs have sometimes been
detected [39]. This includes antisense tRNAs that are
not processed by normal sense RNA maturation and
would depend on their own capacity to form secondary
structures for punctuation of RNA processing [40-43].
Functioning as tRNAs in translation requires that these
tRNAs are loaded with an amino acid. It seems reasonable that this occurs, because even RNA corresponding
to the mitochondrial light strand replication origin, OL,
which is apparently occasionally transcribed into RNA
and forms a stem-loop hairpin secondary structure, is
aminoacylated [44]. Analyses of anticodons expected for
antisense tRNAs also suggests translational activity by
antisense tRNAs: genomes avoid sense tRNAs whose
anticodons define by complementarity antisense anticodons that match stop (terminator) codons, and hence

Genbank (NC_012920). The 5′ flank of the antisense of tRNA Ser UGA is processed by sense RNA maturation by default because it is flanked by
the mitochondrial protein coding gene COX1, its 3′ flank because of its vicinity with sense tRNA Asp GUC. Normal sense RNA maturation
processes only the 3′ flank of the hypothetical antisense of sense tRNA Asp GUC. Extremities of tRNAs and their anticodons are as detected for
these sequences by tRNAscan-SE.

would form, if transcribed and processed, antiterminator
(termination suppressor) tRNAs [45]. Antitermination
activity would profoundly impair protein synthesis.
Hence the observation that putative antisense antiterminator tRNAs are avoided suggests that antisense tRNAs
have at least occasional translational activity. Indeed, in
about 85% of the vertebrate mitochondrial tRNAs examined, the anticodon of the antisense tRNA (as detected
by tRNAscan-SE) is defined by the exact inverse complement of the sense anticodon [46]. The major exceptions to this rule of anticodon symmetry are for the
antisense anticodons of sense tRNAs Leu CUN and
UUR which would match stop codons UAG and UAA,
respectively. For these tRNAs, the antisense sequences
form cloverleaf structures with anticodons that are
usually not the inverse complements of the sense anticodons. Furthermore, when antisense antiterminator anticodons are not avoided, translational activity by the
antisense tRNA is minimized by the fact that antisense
antiterminator tRNAs form usually weaker cloverleaf
structures than homologous antisense tRNAs with different anticodons. Also, genomes possessing a given
antisense antiterminator tRNA tend to avoid using stop
codons matching that antiterminator anticodon [46].
Normal processing of antisense tRNAs

It seems probable that because antisense tRNAs form
weaker cloverleaves, antisense tRNAs depending only on
their own structural signal for processing are on average
less processed. Hence comparing the group of 11 antisense tRNAs processed by regular sense RNA maturation to the group of antisense tRNAs depending only on
their own processing signal is a natural system on which
to test whether the first group, as compared to the second group, is better adapted for translational activity.
Here I show evidence that various properties of antisense tRNAs that are important for translation correlate
with one another in a way compatible with antisense
tRNA translational activity.
One can expect that mitochondrial antisense tRNAs
processed during regular sense RNA maturation (processed because of the structural signal by sense tRNAs,
not their own) are more expressed than those usually
unprocessed by sense RNA maturation. Therefore, antisense tRNAs processed by sense RNA maturation
should more frequently function during translation, and
their properties in relation to translation should resemble more sense tRNAs than the same properties of
usually unprocessed antisense tRNAs. These processed
antisense tRNAs hence probably routinely expand the
known mitochondrial sense tRNA pool and should be
adapted for translation. This will be termed here the
extension hypothesis. Usually unprocessed antisense
tRNAs are probably more rarely processed, and would

Page 3 of 25

presumably only occasionally function in translation.
They are expected to be, on average, less similar to regular tRNAs, hence translational activity by these antisense tRNAs should be avoided. This will be termed
here as the (antisense tRNA) avoidance hypothesis. Both
hypotheses are adaptive and independent, and probably
coexist, each for different tRNA species (not necessarily
in full association with sense RNA maturation), suggesting a gradient between two extremes, antisense tRNAs
that probably frequently extend the tRNA pool, and
those whose translational activity should be avoided. I
analyze here properties relevant to translation of the
antisense sequence of 49 primate taxa for which complete mitochondrial genomes are available in GenBank
(October 2009). Analyzes, among others, test whether
processed versus unprocessed antisense tRNAs differ in
these properties. The antisense tRNA properties
explored are antisense tRNA misacylation, cloverleaf fragility, and the inaccuracy of antisense processing by
sense RNA maturation (for the 11 antisense tRNAs
where this occurs). These properties are expected higher
in unprocessed than processed antisense tRNAs. Each
property is described separately, and pairwise associations between all six combinations of these four properties are explored. Correlations of these antisense tRNA
properties with the genome-wide usage of their cognate
amino acid are also explored. Results from these analyses, combined in a meta-analysis, suggest that some
antisense tRNAs extend the tRNA pool.

Results
Antisense anticodon prediction from cloverleaf secondary
structure

In order to estimate the extent by which tRNAs adapted
to function in translation, predictions of the amino acids
that match their anticodons according to the mitochondrial genetic code are required. This amino acid is
usually termed ‘cognate’, the 19 others are non-cognates.
The secondary structure of a tRNA, predicted by
tRNAscan-SE, predicts the most probable anticodon for
tRNA sequences. Using the vertebrate mitochondrial
genetic code, that anticodon predicts the cognate of that
antisense tRNA. Table 1 describes cognate amino acids,
anticodons and secondary structure stabilities (estimated
by the structural component of COVE output by
tRNAscan-SE) of the 22 most common (modal) human
mitochondrial sense and antisense tRNAs (sequences
are from the appendix of [22]). Similar analyses were
done for the mitochondrial genomes of 48 other primates for which complete mitochondrial sequence data
were available at GenBank (October 2009). tRNAscanSE detects correctly all 21 sense anticodons of human
mitochondrial sense tRNAs that form classical cloverleaves (the 22nd, tRNA Ser AGY, is excluded from this

The 3d and 6th columns indicate COVE scores for the secondary structure component of the tRNA’s cloverleaf, calculated by tRNAscan-SE (http://lowelab.ucsc.
edu/tRNAscan-SE/[37]). The 4th column indicates the antisense anticodon as the inverse complement of the sense anticodon in column 2. If tRNAscan-SE
detected a different (or no) anticodon, this is indicated after the comma. The 5th column indicates the amino acid matching the antisense anticodon according
to the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. Column 7 indicates whether normal mitochondrial RNA maturation processes the 5′ and/or 3′ extremities of the
antisense tRNA. The last column indicates the distance in number of nucleotides between these extremities of the antisense tRNA and the sense gene processed

analysis as it does not form a classical cloverleaf (it lacks
the tRNA’s D-arm) and is undetectable by that software). The software was set to its mitochondrial/chloroplast (organelle) mode. It used for anticodon definition
the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. For each species, the sense tRNA sequences extracted by tRNAscanSE were inverse complemented and processed by
tRNAscan-SE, defining its COVE cut-off score for tRNA
detection to COVE = -100. For tRNA Ser AGY, the
sequences used were as those annotated in GenBank for
that genome. For Homo sapiens, tRNAscan-SE did not
detect antisense anticodons in 5 antisense tRNAs (23%).
In these 5 tRNAs, the anticodon remains ambiguous for

the antisense tRNA. In 15 among the 16 remaining antisense tRNAs (94%), the antisense anticodon was precisely the antisense sequence of the sense anticodon
(e.g., for sense anticodon UCA, which codes for Trp, the
antisense anticodon is UGA, which codes for Ser). This
was also the case for 70% of 50 different E. coli tRNAs
(NC010468). Hence the sense tRNA’s anticodon usually
predicts the antisense tRNA’s anticodon. This property
is termed anticodon symmetry between sense and antisense tRNAs. The only human antisense tRNA lacking
anticodon symmetry was the antisense of tRNA Leu
CUN. In this case, anticodon symmetry would have
resulted in an antitermination anticodon which matches

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

a stop codon. The fact that precisely in this case there is
no anticodon symmetry could also be an adaptation to
avoid detrimental effects of antisense tRNA expression.
This property of avoiding antitermination antisense
tRNAs by anticodon asymmetry is illustrated and
explored in more detail elsewhere [46].
Antisense tRNAs resemble regular tRNAs with the same
cognate amino acids

Proper tRNA translational activity requires tRNA aminoacylation by the tRNA’s cognate, which is the amino
acid that matches the tRNA’s anticodon according to
the genetic code. Aminoacylation (also termed tRNA
loading) is done by class I and class II aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases, two protein groups specific to different cognate amino acids that aminoacylate tRNA acceptor
stems with their cognate. Note that symmetries in the
genetic code determine which amino acid is amynoacylated by which tRNA synthetase class [47,48], a fact that
might be relevant to sense-antisense tRNA pairs [21].
These tRNA synthetases recognize tRNAs according to
yet undefined nucleotide patterns on the tRNA, mainly
in the tRNA’s acceptor stem [49]. Misloading of antisense
tRNAs would result from tRNA nucleotide patterns that
confer information that is not matched with the tRNA’s
anticodon, hence a lack of coadaptation between the
anticodon and the rest of the tRNA. If such coadaptation
between parts of the (antisense) tRNA exists, it is evidence that the antisense tRNA is adapted for translation,
confirming the extension hypothesis. The ‘code’ according to which anticodons (and cognates) are matched with
other parts of the tRNA is not yet well elucidated [50],
but some association apparently exists between anticodon and acceptor stem nucleotide contents [51].
A sequence alignment approach is usually used to detect
nucleotides (other than anticodons) determining correct
aminoacylation [52]. The online available bioinformatic
application ‘TFAM’ [53]http://tfam.lcb.uu.se/ aligns target
(focal) tRNA sequences to large datasets of known functional groups of tRNA sequences, mainly of bacterial origin. TFAM uses the latter sequences as reference
sequences, and outputs scores that estimate the quality of
the alignment of the input, focal sequence with each of the
known functional reference tRNA groups. A positive
alignment score with one of the reference tRNA groups
with known cognate indicates that the alignment of the
focal sequence with that group of tRNAs is better than for
random sequences. Negative scores indicate that the alignment is worse than for random sequences. Supposedly, a
tRNA sequence has greater aminoacylation potential with
the cognate of the TFAM-tRNA functional group that
aligns best with it. Because this procedure depends on the
complete tRNA sequence, it includes, and corresponds
mainly to sequence information besides the anticodon.

Page 5 of 25

Scores in the TFAM output are therefore interpreted here
as proportional to the aminoacylation potential of specific
amino acids for that target tRNA sequence. According to
the context, these scores are used here according to the
interpretation that they reflect aminoacylation potential,
or as a direct measure of alignment quality with the ‘standard’ bacterial tRNAs used as reference sequences by
TFAM.
Table 2 presents the TFAM-scores obtained for sense
and antisense tRNAs versus each functional tRNA
group for the 22 human mitochondrial tRNA sequences
from [22]. I quantify the potential for misacylation of a
tRNA by the number of non-cognates with TFAM
scores higher than the tRNA’s cognate amino acid predicted by tRNAscan-SE according to the structure of
the anticodon loop. For antisense tRNAs for which no
anticodon was detected, I use the principle of anticodon
symmetry between sense and antisense tRNAs: the
inverse complement of the sense anticodon is used to
predict the antisense tRNA’s cognate amino acid. Only
results for Homo sapiens are presented in detail here,
but all 49 primate genomes included in this study were
analysed as described here by tRNAscan-SE and TFAM.
It is known that alignment procedures frequently do
not succeed in determining cognates of sense mitochondrial tRNAs. It seems that the mitochondrial tRNA acylation ‘code’ is not well elucidated. This is reflected by
the fact that TFAM detects the same amino acid as predicted by the anticodon in only 5 sense and 2 antisense
human mt tRNAs (sense, 23%: Asn, Gln, His, Lys and
Met; antisense, 10%: Ala, Thr). This is not the case for
E. coli: TFAM detects correctly the cognate in 96% of
the 50 sense tRNAs, but only 2% of its antisense tRNAs.
Despite that TFAM has a low success at recognizing
the precise cognate, even for sense tRNAs, analyzing
statistically TFAM’s output shows it did better than
chance. Hence this output can still be informative. The
aminoacylation potential for the cognate predicted by
the anticodon, as estimated from alignment quality, was
greater than that of more than 50% of the 19 non-cognates in 15 sense and 13 antisense mitochondrial
tRNAs. Hence 68% of the sense and 62% of the antisense tRNAs have cognate aminoacylation potentials
greater than that of half of the remaining 19 non-cognate amino acids (for E. coli, this was 96% for sense and
63% for antisense tRNAs). This suggests that on average,
antisense tRNAs resemble more sense tRNAs with the
same cognate than tRNAs that have other cognate
amino acids. This suggests that antisense tRNAs as a
group follow mainly the extension hypothesis: their
sequences tend to be adapted for correct recognition by
tRNA synthetases, at least more than chance. Misacylation potentials (expressed by the number of non-cognate
amino acids with higher acylation potential than the

Each row is for a target tRNA sequence, indicated by its three letter cognate abbreviation, followed by the number of scores higher than the score of the
cognate predicted by the anticodon. Columns are headed by the standard one letter abbreviation of cognate amino acids, indicating the known tRNA functional
groups. Scores are alignment quality (here interpreted as proportional to probability of acylation of the target tRNA sequence by the cognate of the ‘standard’
tRNA group used by TFAM (http://tfam.lcb.uu.se/[53])) between the target tRNA sequence and the sequences used by TFAM as the reference group of tRNAs
with known function. Negative and positive scores indicate alignment quality lower and higher than for random sequences, respectively. Bold scores indicate the
amino acid matching the target tRNA’s anticodon according to the genetic code. Antisense tRNAs are ordered according to their matching sense tRNA. Asterisks
indicate two tailed statistical significance at P < 0.05 according to a binomial distribution for misacylation potentials.

cognate) display a bimodal distribution, similar for sense
and antisense tRNAs (Figure 2). Few tRNAs have intermediate misacylation potentials. The two separate
modes are biased towards the extremes of the distribution: either a tRNA has low misacylation potential
(x-axis close to zero in Figure 2), or it has a very high
misacylation potential (x axis close to 19). Hence antisense tRNAs can be considered in a binary, qualitative
way: those with low misacylation potential (coded as
zero), and those with high misacylation tendencies
(coded by unity). The discussion deals in more detail
with the puzzle that some tRNAs (both sense and antisense) have apparently very high misacylation potentials.
Statistical tests can be applied to these misacylation
potentials in Table 2. Here I assume that the focal tRNA
sequence is as likely to align with any of TFAM’s reference tRNA sequences as the one that has the same cognate amino acid as the focal tRNA sequence that is
analysed. Under that null hypothesis, the binomial distribution predicts that the probability to find a focal tRNA
that aligns better with 5 or less reference tRNA
sequences with different cognates than the focal tRNA’s
cognate has a two tailed P that is less than 0.05. This

Acylation by non-cognate amino acids greater than by the cognate

Figure 2 Frequency distribution of misacylation tendency for
sense and antisense tRNAs (white and black columns,
respectively). The modal (most frequent) human tRNA sequence
was used for each of the 22 mitochondrial tRNA species. TFAM
aligns each sequence to reference tRNA sequences with known
cognates. Alignment quality with each tRNA reference estimates the
tendency of the focal tRNA sequence for acylation with the cognate
of the tRNA reference (raw data in Table 2). The x axis indicates the
number of tRNA references with cognates differing from the focal
tRNA’s cognate but aligning better with the focal tRNA sequence
than the reference tRNA with the cognate matching the focal
tRNA’s anticodon. Hence numbers close to zero on the x axis
indicate low tendency for misacylation. The y axis is the number of
focal tRNAs observed for that x axis. The distribution expected
according to a binomial distribution is also shown (see text for
further explanations).

means that for that focal tRNA, the observed level of
similarity with the reference tRNA that has the same cognate is unlikely to be due to chance. The same logic
works for having more than 15 standard tRNAs aligning
better than the reference tRNA with the same cognate.
Applying this to data in Table 2, misacylation is statistically significantly less likely than random for 13 sense
tRNAs (Cys, Phe, Gly, His, Lys, Met, Asn, Pro Gln, Arg,
Thr, Trp and Val), and for 10 antisense tRNAs (antisenses of tRNA Ala, Asp, Glu, Phe, His, Met, Pro, Ser
UCN, Thr, and Val). Assuming P = 0.05, for 22 tests
(meaning 22 tRNAs), 1.1 cases are expected significant at
P = 0.05 by chance. Hence many more tRNAs are less
misacylated than expected by chance. Using the same
principles, 4 sense and 6 antisense tRNAs (sense tRNAs
Leu UUR, Leu CUN, Ser AGY and Ser UCN; and the
antisense of tRNAs Arg, Cys, Gln, Gly, Leu CUN and
Tyr) are more likely to be misacylated than expected by
chance. Hence the distribution of misacylation potentials
differs highly from that expected by chance, with only 4
sense and 7 antisense tRNAs with misacylation potentials
that can be considered as intermediate. Two tailed tests
are considered here because it is of interest to see if
TFAM’s output differs from chance, in relation to both
the extension (better than chance) and the avoidance
hypothesis (worse than chance).
When more than one statistical test is done, one has to
correct P values in a way that takes into account the number of tests done. The Bonferroni correction does this, but
is overconservative [54]: it has a high chance of accepting
the null hypothesis that there is no effect, even when there
is one. Nevertheless, according to that correction, 10 sense
and 6 antisense tRNAs still align better than chance with
the standard sequence that has the cognate predicted for
the focal tRNA by tRNAscan-SE. Using the less overconservative Benjamini-Hochberg method [55] to take into
account multiple tests, 13 sense and 10 antisense tRNAs
align better than expected by chance at P < 0.05 with the
reference tRNA that has the same cognate. Note that
whatever method is used, several tRNAs, including sense
tRNAs, appear according to TFAM’s output as having
high misacylation potential. If this was true, it would result
in numerous misinsertions during protein synthesis, which
is unlikely. This result sheds suspicions towards the biological meaningfulness of TFAM’s output. Analyses in the
next section show that TFAM estimates are biologically
meaningful, while a section in the discussion indicates a
possible solution to this apparent puzzle about tRNA misloading and resulting misinsertions.
A test for robustness of misacylation potentials predicted
by TFAM

The following analysis is designed to show that aminoacylation potentials as indicated by TFAM are relatively

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

robust estimates and reflect tRNA biology, despite the
apparently counter-intuitive result that TFAM indicates
very low aminoacylation specificity, even for some sense
tRNAs. These analyses confirm that TFAM is a powerful, though imperfect tool for determining cognate
amino acids, even for mitochondrial tRNAs, including
their antisense tRNAs.
The anticodons detected by tRNAscan-SE for antisense tRNAs are the inverse complement of the sense
tRNA anticodon in the wide majority of cases. In about
5% of all tRNAs examined for the 49 primate mitochondrial genomes used here, the antisense anticodon was
not the inverse complement of the sense anticodon.
(This excludes tRNA Ser AGY which lacks a D-arm and
is not detected by tRNAscan-SE, and tRNAs Leu CUN
and Leu UUR for which anticodon symmetry predicts
an antitermination anticodon, an anticodon matching a
stop codon). In these antisense tRNAs lacking anticodon
symmetry, the antisense tRNA has two predicted cognate amino acids: the cognate predicted by anticodon
symmetry which is observed in most homologous
tRNAs from closely related species, and the anticodon
predicted by tRNAscan-SE’s analysis of the structure of
the antisense tRNA’s anticodon arm in that specific species. As stated above, both methods yield the same prediction in about 95% of the cases, but the remaining 5%
can be used to test whether TFAM produces robust predictions of aminoacylation potential. Because the 49 primate genomes produce only 40 such antisense tRNAs
lacking anticodon symmetry, I expanded the sample by
analyzing 76 additional mammalian mitochondrial genomes (Cetacea, 25; Insectivora, 11; Pinnipedia, 23; and
Rodentia, 17, which were all the genomes available for
these taxa in Genbank in spring 2009). Their tRNA
sequences were available because they had been
extracted in relation to results described in [46]. This
yields a total of 130 antisense tRNAs lacking anticodon
symmetry. For each of these antisense tRNAs, I performed two separate analyses of TFAM’s output, using
as predicted cognate amino acid the one predicted by
tRNAscan-SE and the one predicted by anticodon symmetry. Then I compared the misacylation potentials
obtained assuming the symmetry- versus the structurebased cognate amino acid predictions. If TFAM’s output
is relatively robust, it should yield lower misacylation
potentials for cognates predicted by tRNAscan-SE than
by anticodon symmetry, and this despite that the tRNA
sequence can not have evolved much as compared to
closely related species where that sense-antisense tRNA
has anticodon symmetry. For anticodons predicted by
symmetry, on average 10.5 ± 6.8 non-cognates have a
greater aminoacylation potential than the predicted cognate amino acid according to TFAM. For anticodons
predicted according to the anticodon arm’s structure,

Page 8 of 25

fewer (9.1 ± 6.1) non-cognates have a greater aminoacylation potential than the predicted cognate amino acid
according to TFAM. This difference is small, but a
paired t-test shows that it is statistically significant (t =
1.91, one tailed P = 0.029). This result is also confirmed
if using on the same data the more robust, non-parametric Wilcoxon test for differences between two medians (z = 1.86, one tailed P = 0.031) (statistical
properties of the alignment scores are not known and it
is possible that assumptions of normality are
inadequate).
The reason for using one tailed tests is that one
expects that the ‘real’ anticodon is the one detected
using the specific structure of the tRNA’s cloverleaf.
The fact that this anticodon only rarely differs from the
one predicted by anticodon symmetry means that in
some rare cases, the tRNA sequence evolved in a species
in such a way that the cloverleaf structure formed by the
antisense tRNA differs from the one predicted by pure
symmetry from the sense tRNA, yielding an antisense
anticodon that is not ‘symmetric’ with the sense anticodon. If antisense tRNAs are functional and estimates of
their aminoacylation potentials by TFAM are valid, then
the misacylation potential according to anticodon symmetry has to be greater than the misacylation potential
for the cognate predicted by tRNAscan-SE.
Because the identity of the antisense anticodon differs
in specific species from that found in almost all other
species in that group, the results suggest that upon the
change in antisense anticodon from the usual antisense
anticodon, the signals in the antisense tRNA’s sequence
that determine its aminoacylation potential evolved so
as to match better the new anticodon. This result means
that the aminoacylation potential as determined by
TFAM coevolves with the identity of the antisense
anticodon, even at the level of micro-evolution between
relatively closely related species within a mammalian
taxon. This result shows that predictions of aminoacylation potentials by TFAM, though imperfect, are quite
robust and are biologically meaningful.
Sequence complementarity does not predict misacylation

Sense and antisense tRNAs are by definition complementary. Hence many of the properties of the antisense
tRNA might seem adaptive not because of function at
the level of the antisense tRNA, but because the sense
tRNA adapted to translation, and the antisense inherits
part of this by symmetry between complementing
sequences. This is not the case for the estimates of misacylation in Table 2. There is almost no correlation
between the number of non-cognates with greater acylation potentials than the cognate for the sense tRNA and
the corresponding number for its antisense tRNA (r =
0.18). However, it will be important to take into account

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

this issue of sequence complementarity between sense
and antisense tRNAs when exploring other antisense
tRNA properties. For example, for the structural component of the COVE index output by tRNAscan-SE estimating the cloverleaf formation (see corresponding
columns in Table 1), sense-antisense COVEs correlate
positively (r = 0.397, one tailed P = 0.037). This correlation is also found in most cases where correlations
involve homologous tRNAs from different primate species (column marked as S-A: COVE in Table 3): sense
and antisense COVE are positively correlated in 16
among 22 tRNA species. This is particularly strong in
unprocessed tRNAs. For misacylation potentials (column
marked as S-A: TFAM in Table 3), no general tendency
appears. However, for both COVE and misacylation
potential, there is an overall tendency for more negative
correlations in processed than unprocessed antisense
tRNAs. Negative correlations can be interpreted as
reflecting, at the level of evolution of tRNA sequences
in primates, tradeoffs between sense and antisense
tRNAs. Such tradeoffs implicitly indicate that processed
antisense tRNAs are functional, and therefore some balance exists between their functional requirements (in
terms of cloverleaf formation and acylation potential)
and those, for the same properties, of their corresponding sense tRNA.

mt genome of Homo sapiens. A t-test can be used for
misacylation potentials. For mitochondrial human antisense tRNAs that are not processed by sense RNA
maturation, the mean misacylation potential = 11.7 ±
6.27. If the tRNA sequence was random, one would
expect better alignments than with its expected tRNA
homologue for half the tRNAs with non-cognates, hence
9.5 among 19. The reported mean does not differ significantly from 9.5, the number of non-cognates with acylation scores higher than the cognate expected under
random conditions. The average for processed antisense
tRNAs is 5.36 ± 6.17. This value does differ significantly
from 9.5, the expected value: t = -2.22, P = 0.025 (one
tailed test). This result specifically supports the extension hypothesis for processed antisense tRNAs, and
overall the extension-avoidance hypothesis for all antisense tRNAs: processed and unprocessed antisense
tRNAs significantly differ in their tendencies for misacylation (t = 2.33, one tailed P = 0.0155).
Hence antisense tRNAs that are processed during normal sense RNA maturation are better adapted for translation than unprocessed ones because they are less
misloaded, which indicates coadaptation between their
anticodon and the parts of the tRNA that are recognized
by tRNA synthetases.
Misacylated antisense tRNAs form unstable cloverleaves

Processed antisense tRNAs have higher cognate
specificity than unprocessed ones

Previous sections described properties of sense and antisense tRNAs, such as the stability of the cloverleaf secondary structure they form, their predicted cognate
amino acid, the potential for misacylation, and whether
they are processed or not by sense RNA maturation.
The next sections explore whether different properties
important for tRNA function correlate in the way coevolution for antisense tRNA function would expect (i.e.
one expects cloverleaf stability to correlate negatively
with misacylation potential). When possible, the pair of
properties is analysed by comparing homologous tRNAs
from 49 different primate genomes.
The working hypotheses predict that antisense tRNAs
with low misacylation potentials should expand the
tRNA pool and hence should be processed by sense
RNA maturation, while translational activity by those
with high misacylation potentials should be avoided
because causing amino acid misinsertions in protein
sequences. Hence such antisense tRNAs should be more
common among antisense tRNAs that are unprocessed
by sense RNA maturation. This test can not be done
when comparing homologous tRNAs, because no variation in presence/absence of processing exists within
homologous primate tRNAs. Therefore non-homologous
tRNAs are compared here. I present results only for the

Cloverleaf stability is one of the most important properties of tRNAs. For example, tRNA sequences with
pathogenic mutations typically form less stable cloverleaves than non-pathogenic variants [56]. Hence one
can expect that antisense tRNAs with high misacylation potential form less stable cloverleaves than those
with low misacylation potential if the working
hypothesis is valid. However, because of their complementarity, secondary structure formation by antisense
tRNAs is correlated with that of their sense complement. Hence in order to test for effects on antisense
tRNA COVE without these being confounded by the
correlation between sense and antisense cloverleaf
COVES, I calculated residual antisense tRNA COVE
from the linear regression between antisense tRNA
COVE as dependent and sense tRNA COVE as independent. These residuals estimate antisense tRNA
COVEs independently of their sense tRNA counterpart’s COVE: a positive residual means the antisense
COVE is greater than would be expected according to
the COVE of its sense counterpart, and vice versa for
negative values.
The working hypothesis predicts that misacylated antisense tRNAs should form less stable cloverleaves.
I tested for correlation between misacylation and cloverleaf stability using COVE of antisense tRNAs, but also
using residual antisense tRNA COVE.

Correlations are for homologous tRNAs from 49 primate genomes, but exclude antisense tRNAs with non-symmetric anticodons (see text for explanations).
Misacylation potentials are deduced from TFAM’s output, as shown for human mitochondrial tRNAs in Table 2. The structural component of the COVE index from
tRNAscan-SE estimates cloverleaf stability. For antisense tRNAs, residual COVE is the residual from the regression of antisense COVE with corresponding sense
COVE. Both parametric Pearson (r) and non-parametric Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficients and their statistical one sided significances are indicated for
antisense tRNAs. S-A indicates parametric correlations between properties of sense and antisense tRNAs (COVE for correlations between cloverleaf stabilities,
TFAM for correlations between misacylation potentials). Bold indicates statistical significance at P < 0.05 according to the working hypothesis. $ indicates that the
correlation is significant at P < 0.05 after Bonferroni’s adjustment of P’s for multiple tests, asterisks indicate P < 0.05 after adjusting according to the BenjaminiHochberg method, but not Bonferroni’s. The last three rows indicate the statistics and P values after combining tests in that column according to Fisher’s
method for combining P values, separately for processed and unprocessed antisense tRNAs, and for all tRNAs.

The extension-avoidance hypothesis expects a negative
association between antisense tRNA COVE and the misacylation potential for that antisense tRNA. Considering
the 49 primate genomes, I analysed for each of the 22
sets of 49 homologous tRNA genes the correlations
between misacylation and COVE for sense and antisense
tRNAs, and between misacylation and residual COVE for
antisense tRNAs. Table 3 presents the correlation coefficients of these analyses. First, for sense tRNAs (last column in Table 3), the correlation between COVE and
misacylation is negative, as expected, for 13 among 22
sense tRNAs. Specific correlations were significant at P <
0.05 in 7 cases, among which four were in the expected
negative direction and three in the opposite direction.

The correlations where misacylation increases with
COVE suggest the possibility that in some sense tRNAs,
a tradeoff exists between the two properties because they
reached some evolutionary optimum, meaning that in
order to evolve higher aminoacylation specificity, a tRNA
has to decrease its cloverleaf stability, and vice versa.
This rationale of evolutionary optimum and tradeoff
between acylation specificity and COVE is less likely to
exist in antisense tRNAs, where one expects a less stable
situation from an evolutionary point of view. Indeed,
only for the antisense of tRNA Lys such a tradeoff seems
to exist, but this analysis involves only 6 primate species
because only in these species anticodon symmetry exists
for this sense-antisense tRNA pair. Note that analyses for

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

antisense tRNAs in Table 3 exclude species where sense
and antisense anticodons are not symmetric, besides for
the antisense tRNAs of Leu CUN and UUR where only
the lack of symmetry between anticodons predicts a cognate amino acid for the antisense tRNA. Results were
similar when correlating misacylation with the residual
COVE of the antisense tRNA, and when correlation tests
used the more robust non-parametric Spearman rank
correlation coefficient (rs in Table 3), which does not
assume normality for COVE and TFAM’s scores. Figure
3 shows one of these correlations. It plots the misacylation potential for the antisense of tRNA Tyr as a function
of the residual of the COVE of that antisense tRNA, in all
49 primate species. I did meta-analyses of the statistical
significances of the correlation coefficients in each column relating to antisense tRNAs, using Fisher’s test for
combined P values. This test sums over all k tests considered -2*lnPi, where i ranges from 1 to k and P is the statistical significance of the correlation statistic. This sum
has a chi square distribution with 2*k degrees of freedom.
The meta-analysis of antisense tRNAs shows that for any
type of correlation coefficient, results in Table 3 indicate
a statistically significant negative correlation between
COVE and misacylation. When analysing separately processed and unprocessed antisense tRNAs, results always
show less significant results for the unprocessed antisense tRNAs, which also fits with the prediction that processed antisense tRNAs are more likely to expand the
tRNA pool than unprocessed ones. Indeed, for the third
column in Table 3, r is negative as expected for nine
among eleven processed antisense tRNAs, which is significantly more than expected by chance according to a one
tailed sign test (P = 0.016) (here a one tailed test is used
because the null hypothesis expects a specific direction
for the examined association). For unprocessed antisense
tRNAs, only five among eleven correlations are negative,
which does not differ from 5.5 expected by pure chance.
These results are strong evidence that antisense tRNAs,
and especially processed ones, frequently function in
translation, while translational activity by antisense
tRNAs that have high misacylation potentials is avoided
by them forming unstable cloverleaves. This result is
remarkable also in the light of corresponding analyses for
the sense tRNAs. These indicate that there is no trivial
reason to expect a specific direction for correlations
between misacylation and COVE, and hence serve as
control for results of the analyses of antisense tRNAs.
The same principle of association between misacylation and COVE is also tested comparing only the 22
non-homologous human antisense tRNAs. Comparisons
between non-homologous genes yield evidence that is
usually considered as less strong than comparisons
between homologous genes. However, in our context,
these non-homologous comparisons are useful because

Page 11 of 25

future experiments designed to test the bioinformatic
evidence presented here will most likely focus on tRNAs
from given model species which probably include Homo
sapiens. Hence it is important to show, for Homo, that
the various antisense tRNAs also follow the principles
discussed, and to indicate which antisense tRNAs are
most likely to be functional. Figure 2 shows that misacylation potentials have a bimodal distribution in Homo.
Therefore, residual cloverleaf stabilities of antisense
tRNAs from each mode in Figure 2 are analyzed separately. Those with low misacylation potential have a
mean residual stability of 5.29 ± 10.96, n = 13, and this
value is almost significantly greater than zero (t = 1.741,
P = 0.0535, one tailed test). Those antisense tRNAs with
high misacylation potential have a low mean residual
stability of -8.60 ± 9.74, n = 8, which is significantly
lower than zero (t = -2.499, one tailed P = 0.0205). The
latter test supports the avoidance hypothesis (it is one
tailed because the avoidance hypothesis expects that
residual COVE is negative), the former the extension
hypothesis (again one tailed, because this hypothesis
expects positive COVE values), and the fact that these
two means differ significantly (t = -2.938, one tailed P =
0.004) supports the extension-avoidance hypothesis.
Hence the principles suggested by comparisons of
homologous tRNAs from different primates in Table 3
are qualitatively valid at the level of non-homologous
comparisons within mitochondria of Homo sapiens.
Misacylation and accuracy of antisense tRNA processing
by sense RNA maturation

Half the antisense tRNAs have at least one of their
extremities processed by sense RNA maturation. This
means that an adjacent active sense gene is processed at
least at one of their extremities. The number of nucleotides separating the extremity of that adjacent sense
gene from the antisense tRNA estimates the lack of precision of processing of the antisense tRNA by sense
RNA maturation of that antisense tRNA. One can
expect that when antisense tRNAs are processed exactly
at their extremity (when there is no intergene spacer),
then sense RNA maturation adapted for antisense tRNA
translational activity. This is suggested by the observation that most human mitochondrial sense tRNAs have
no intergene spacers (not shown). The length of these
antisense spacers is indicated in Table 1 (they are
summed when both 5′ and 3′ antisense tRNA extremities are processed). Such intergene spacer lengths were
obtained for all 49 primate genomes, and correlations
between interspacer length and misacylation were calculated for each of the 11 antisense tRNAs with at least
one processed extremity, using the sum of the 5′ and 3′
spacers in the cases where both extremities are processed. The extension-avoidance hypothesis expects that

processing is inaccurate for antisense tRNAs with high
misacylation potential, and vice versa for those with
high cognate aminoacylation specificity, hence positive
correlations are expected between intergene spacer
length and misacylation potential, which means that
tests described below are one tailed. Figure 4 plots an
example, for the antisense of tRNA Trp. Table 4 shows
these correlations (using both the parametric Pearson

correlation coefficient r and the more robust non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs) for all
processed antisense tRNAs. A tendency exists for correlations to have the direction that is expected by the
working hypothesis. The Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment of the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests
shows that for at least one (according to r) or two
(according to rs) antisense tRNAs, the correlation

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39

correlations between homologous tRNAs, but it confirms the principle at the level of a single genome,
which is particularly convenient for experimental tests
of the hypothesis presented here, because such tests will
probably focus on a single genome. For non-homologous human antisense tRNAs, misacylation increases
with intergene spacer length (Pearson’s r = 0.598, one
tailed P = 0.026, n = 11). These results on misacylation
and interspacer length are strong evidence for the extension-avoidance hypotheses: the organization of mitochondrial genomes seems finely tuned for long
intergene spacers to down-regulate the expression of
antisense tRNAs that are likely to be misacylated, but
who are necessarily processed by sense RNA maturation
because of their vicinity with sense genes.

between misacylation and length of intergene spacer is
significant at P < 0.05 after considering that 11 tests
were done. Fisher’s test for combined P’s (last rows in
Table 4) also shows that data in Table 4 show a significant tendency for positive correlations, especially for rs.
This result is also confirmed at the level of comparisons between non-homologous antisense tRNAs from
the human mitochondrial genome. As stated in the previous section, this result is weaker evidence than

Cloverleaf stability and accuracy of antisense tRNA
processing by sense RNA maturation

Similarly to the previous section, here I explore whether,
among processed antisense tRNAs, those accurately processed by sense RNA maturation are also more adequate
for translation, but now according to the stability of
their cloverleaf structure. I test this using the COVE of
antisense tRNAs and the residual COVE, which takes
into account the effects of the stability of the sense
tRNA cloverleaf on the stability of the cloverleaf of its
antisense tRNAs. Figure 5 shows an example, for the
antisense of tRNA Pro. Table 4 shows these correlations
for all 11 processed antisense tRNAs, using parametric
and non-parametric tests (r and rs correlation coefficients, respectively). Here, the working hypothesis
expects negative correlations, hence one tailed tests are

This seems to be the case for at least one antisense
tRNA, the antisense of tRNA Gln. Hence strong correlations between intergene spacer lengths and cloverleaf

used. This is the case for the majority of antisense
tRNAs only when using rs. The number of correlations
that are significant in either direction is somewhat
balanced, although there are usually more negative correlations. Hence a meta-analysis approach was used to
determine whether a general tendency exists in these
data. Fisher’s test for combined P’s shows what the general tendency in the data is an overall significant negative correlation (last rows of Table 4). This evidence is
positive, yet weaker than for previous pairs of antisense
tRNA properties.
The analysis considering the non-homologous antisense
tRNAs in human mitochondria yields a qualitatively similar, yet statistically not significant result, and this only
when using residual COVE (r = -0.207, P = 0.27).

between length of intergene spacer and COVE are sufficiently strong to be detected as statistically significant
suggests that for these two properties, associations may
be determined sometimes according to a more complex
rationale than the one proposed until now. Indeed,
tRNA processing depends on the tRNA’s capacity to
form secondary structure. It is possible that for processed antisense tRNAs that are usually expressed, a
strong cloverleaf structure suggests a reaction to the
need for being processed independently of sense RNA
maturation, but on the sole ‘merit’ of the antisense
tRNA’s own capacity to form secondary structure. If this
is correct, inaccurate sense RNA maturation as estimated by long intergene spacers should be compensated
by greater cloverleaf stability of the antisense tRNA.

This section explores correlations between the antisense
tRNA properties described in previous sections (misacylation, cloverleaf stability and processing accuracy) and
the usage of their predicted cognate amino acid in the
mitochondrial genome. These analyses assume that variation in amino acid usage among primate species should
be matched by corresponding variation in the (antisense)
tRNA’s properties that would make it more adapted for
translational activity. Hence one expects negative correlations between an antisense tRNA’s misacylation potential
and the genome-wide usage of its cognate amino acid
(one tailed tests are used because a specific direction is
expected). The direction of the correlation is as expected
in less than half the cases, for both parametric and nonparametric correlation analyses (Table 5, r and rs, respectively), but most significant correlations, for r and rs,
respectively, have the expected direction (3 and 5 cases),
while only 2 significant correlations have the opposite
direction. Following the same rationale, COVE (and residual COVE) should correlate positively with amino acid
usage. In this case, the direction of more than half the
cases is according to prediction for each r and rs. Most
statistically significant correlations (7 and 5, for r and rs,
respectively) are positive, while only 2 correlations with
opposite direction were statistically significant (see Table
5). The length of intergene spacers is expected to correlate negatively with amino acid usage, and indeed most
correlations are negative, and the only case that is statistically significant, for the antisense of tRNA Ala, is
among them. Overall, considering correlations of cognate
usage with all antisense tRNA variables, most statistically
significant correlations have the direction expected if
antisense tRNAs are functional in translation: 10 according to prediction (excluding residuals of COVE to avoid
pseudoreplication with analyses on COVE), versus 3 significant cases that have directions opposite to predictions. Data in Table 5 indicate no significant tendency for
processed antisense tRNAs to fit better predictions than
unprocessed ones. Results are for evolutionary changes in
amino acid usages, suggesting that the antisense tRNAs
function in translation.

The extension hypothesis expects negative correlations for misacylation and processing inaccuracy, and positive ones between cloverleaf stability (COVE) and
amino acid usage. The last row indicates the percentage of correlations whose directions match predictions.

adapted for translation, and pairwise correlations
between these properties, and with genome-wide amino
acid usage. Overall, the hypothesis that antisense tRNAs
function in translation yields predictions for the directions of each of the 6 pairwise combinations of these 4
antisense properties. Similarly, the working hypothesis
also predicts the direction of correlations between these
properties and amino acid usage, hence in total 9 pairwise combinations.
Table 6 summarizes the results of tests of the extension-avoidance hypothesis presented here for pairs of
properties. Results are similar when considering parametric and non-parametric analyses, and indicate the
percentage of tRNAs for which the direction of the correlation was according to the prediction for that pair of
variables. For processed versus unprocessed antisense
tRNAs, the table presents the percentages for the 11
processed ones followed by the percentage among the
unprocessed ones. For COVE (indicated by stability in
Table 5), percentages for COVE and the residuals of
COVE are indicated. The majority of the tRNAs follow
the predictions of the working hypothesis, and this for
the majority of pairiwise variable combinations. This is

also true when comparing processed versus unprocessed
antisense tRNAs, as the working hypothesis expects
more cases fitting the hypothesis among processed than
unprocessed antisense tRNAs. The fact that these various analyses are not independent of each other makes
it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the
results, but the general tendency is clear.
Note that data in Table 3 suggest that the correlations
between COVE and misacylation, and residual COVE
and misacylation fit less well predictions for unprocessed than processed antisense tRNAs (compare P
values for processed and unprocessed antisense tRNAs
in Table 3). Hence presence or absence of processing
also interacts with the strength of associations between
other properties important for antisense tRNA function.
Similarly, associations between sense and antisense
COVE, and sense and antisense misacylation potentials
suggest differences between processed and unprocessed
antisense tRNAs. The results, in that case, support the
idea that for processed antisense tRNAs, which are
according to the working hypothesis the most likely to
be functional, tradeoffs might exist between the property
of the sense and the antisense tRNA, while no

For correlations between COVE, the index for capacities to form cloverleaf
structures (from tRNAscan SE [37]), and other variables, the first row indicates
results using antisense tRNA COVE scores, the second row indicates results for
residuals of antisense tRNA COVE scores, calculated from the linear regression
between antisense tRNA COVE (dependent) with the COVE score of its
corresponding sense tRNA (independent). * indicate that the percentage is
significantly greater at P < 0.05 than 50% according to a sign test. The
variable ‘processing’ indicates the presence or absence of antisense tRNA
processing by sense RNA maturation. For processing, the first percentage is
for processed antisense tRNAs, the second for unprocessed ones. The working
hypothesis expects higher percentages for processed than unprocessed
antisense tRNAs.

indication for such tradeoffs exists for unprocessed antisense tRNAs. The overall results of tests done for any
combination of tRNA properties for homologous tRNAs
support the extension-avoidance hypothesis for translational activity by antisense tRNAs (avoided for antisense
tRNAs with low COVE, high misacylation potential and
long intergene spacer; but promoted for those with high
COVE, low misacylation potential and short (or no)
intergene spacers).

Discussion
Results show that on average, some antisense tRNAs are
more adapted for translation than others. Both sense
and antisense tRNAs are less likely to be misacylated
than would be expected if this was random. Hence on
average, antisense tRNAs cause less amino acid misinsertions than one would expect if there was no

adaptation for them to function in translation. This is
particularly the case for those processed by regular
sense RNA maturation, as compared to unprocessed
ones. They are less likely to be misacylated (Table 2).
Antisense tRNAs with high misacylation potentials form
weaker cloverleaves than those with low misacylation
potentials (Table 3, also Figure 3), and, when they are
processed by sense RNA maturation, they tend to be
less accurately processed (Table 4, Figure 4).
Assessing the overall significance of the results is not
straightforward, because the working hypothesis is
tested many times. Correction methods for multiple
tests are all somewhat overconservative, but they do
indicate that some tests are significant after correction,
depending on which criteria are used. The results in
Tables 3, 4 &5 as analyzed by methods that take into
account multiple testing show the difficulty at assessing
in a realistic (rather than conservative) way the significance level of the results. Assuming independence
among tRNAs is a simplification that also leads to overconservative interpretation of the data. The use of Fisher’s test for combining P values assumes independence,
and indicates that results are significant.
Processing 5′, 3′ or both extremities

One of the properties of antisense tRNAs analyzed here
is whether sense RNA maturation processes the antisense tRNA’s extremities. Some antisense tRNAs are
processed at their 5′, other at their 3′ and two at both
extremities. Analyses of the associations between other
tRNA properties and these different types of processing
(5′ or 3′ extremities) do not yield a clear picture. For
example, processing inaccuracy averages at length
5.14 ± 4.10 for intergene spacers next to antisense
tRNAs processed at their 5′ extremity, and 3.6 ± 2.61
for those not processed at that extremity, which is not
statistically significant (t = 0.7, two tailed P = 0.51) and
does not fit the prediction that 5′ processing is adapted
for accuracy. The same test for processing at the 3′
extremity yields qualitatively the result that 3′ processing
is better adapted for antisense tRNA expression than no
processing at the 3′ extremity, but the result is still weak
and not statistically significant (processed, mean intergene spacer length = 3.33 ± 2.42; no 3′ processing,
mean length = 6.00 ± 4.64, t = 1.23, one tailed P =
0.125). Excluding the two antisense tRNAs that are processed at both extremities does not change qualitatively
these results. However, the various associations usually
suggest, as in this simple example, that 3′ processing is
more relevant for antisense tRNA translational activity
than 5′ processing. This is in line with the peculiarity of
mitochondrial sense tRNAs that 5′ maturation always
occurs before 3′ maturation [57]. According to this, one
can predict that 3′ processing of antisense tRNAs by

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

sense RNA maturation has a higher impact than 5′ processing, because it is probably more limiting antisense
tRNA production than the faster 5′ processing. Hence,
for example, the antisense of tRNA Met is more likely
to fully mature than the antisense of tRNA Ile, because
after normal maturation, only its 5′ extremity has to be
processed, which is a process more efficient than 3′ processing. For the antisense of tRNA Ile, full maturation is
hence less probable, because after 5′ processing by normal maturation, 3′ processing is required, which is a less
efficient process.
tRNA misacylation: competition between tRNA
synthetases or between tRNAs?

The quantification of misacylation potential, as deduced
from TFAM’s output, is central to this study. Note that
several results do not depend on this property, but only
on cloverleaf stabilities, the presence or absence of processing by sense RNA maturation, the accuracy of that
processing, and genome-wide usage of the predicted
cognate amino acid. These also yield strong evidence in
favor of translational activity by antisense tRNAs. Hence
a large part of the evidence for adaptation of antisense
tRNAs for translation does not depend on the accuracy
and robustness of TFAM’s output.
The latter point is important, because for some sense
and antisense mitochondrial tRNAs, TFAM predicts
very high misacylation potentials. This result seems
unrealistic from a biological point of view, because it
would yield numerous amino acid misinsertions during
protein synthesis if TFAM’s output is correct. This
point has to be investigated further. The fact that the
misacylation potential of even some of the known sense
tRNAs is very high suggests that TFAM’s results are not
very robust for mitochondrial tRNAs. The alternative is
that they reflect a biological reality. If the latter case is
correct, results depending on TFAM are useful. A section in ‘Results’ shows that when comparing homologous tRNAs, the variation in TFAM’s output can be
considered as quite robust. Here I deal with the basic
problem that, when comparing non-homologous tRNAs,
a sizeable minority of them has a very high misacylation
potential.
The classical way of interpreting the output produced
by TFAM (see Table 2) is to compare values in the
same row. Expressing this in biological terms, this can
be interpreted as comparing the affinities of 20 different
tRNA synthetases for aminoacylating a given tRNA
gene. That approach assumes that the proteins compete
among themselves for aminoacylating a tRNA (note that
‘competition’ is meant in a purely chemical sense). However, in some cases, the opposite might be true: tRNAs
compete for aminoacylation by a given tRNA synthetase.
This can be also tested, by looking at columns in Table

Page 17 of 25

2 (for simplicity, I consider here only sense tRNAs), and
comparing the values across tRNAs, counting the number of times tRNAs with anticodons for amino acids
that are not the cognate assumed for that column yield
a better (more positive) score than the tRNA with the
anticodon that matches the cognate amino acid assumed
by that column. For example, for tRNA Ser AGY, for
which the row-analysis estimates that serine is the least
likely amino acid to be aminoacylated to that tRNA, a
column analysis shows that among the 22 human mitochondrial sense tRNAs, tRNA Ser AGY has the highest
affinity with the seryl-tRNA synthetase. Hence while
assuming competition between tRNA synthetases does
not predict correct aminoacylation for tRNA Ser AGY,
assuming competition between tRNAs for aminoacylation does predict the correct cognate.
Note that the above approach can only be done when
all expressed tRNAs are known. I use it here to show
that the output from TFAM is in most cases biologically
meaningful, even when the classical row analysis yields
high misacylation tendencies. For the sake of the example, I use it considering only sense tRNAs. According to
this column-analysis of the data in Table 2, the cognate
amino acid is better than 50% of the non-cognates for
19 among 22 (86%) sense tRNAs. This is significantly
better than chance at P < 0.05 for 14 tRNAs (one tailed
tests): Ala, Asn, Cys, Ile, Lys, Leu CUN, Met, Phe, Pro,
Ser AGY, Ser UCN, Thr, Tyr and Trp. The column
approach improved cognate prediction accuracy upon
the row approach in 11 tRNAs, for Ala, Asp, Cys, Ile,
Leu CUN, Leu UUR, Phe, Pro, Ser AGY, Ser UCN, and
Trp. Figure 6 plots the percentage of amino acids with
better aminoacylation potentials than the cognate amino
acid according to a column analysis (competition among
tRNAs, y axis) as a function of the percentage according
to a row analysis (competition among tRNA synthetases,
x axis). For 8 among 22 tRNAs (36%), those in the
lower left corner of the graph, it does not matter much
whether one uses a row- or column-based approach. In
these cases, TFAM predicts that the cognate amino acid
has among the highest aminoacylation potentials, irrespective of whether one assumes competing tRNA
synthetases or competing tRNAs. It is probable that
these 8 mitochondrial tRNAs resemble in this respect
most other, non-mitochondrial tRNAs, for which TFAM
has a high success rate at predicting the cognate. For
tRNAs Gln, Val, and especially His, the classical rowapproach assuming competition among tRNA synthetases for the tRNA is performing well, but the columnbased approach does not. Hence for these 3 tRNAs,
aminoacylation is determined by competition among
tRNA synthetases for these tRNAs. For a group of 4 or
5 tRNAs (Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and maybe Ala), none of
the row- and column-based approaches yields a good

Figure 6 Column-versus row-analysis of TFAM’s output. The y axis indicates the percentage of non-cognate amino acids with greater amino
acylation potential than the cognate according to TFAM, assuming competition among tRNAs for tRNA synthetases (column-analysis of output
in Table 2, see text). The x-axis is the percentage of non-cognate amino acids with greater aminoacylation potential than the cognate supposing
competition among tRNA synthetases for tRNAs (row-analysis of Table 2). This graph shows that for many sense tRNAs for which classical
interpretations of TFAM’s output (row analysis of Table 2) yield a poor prediction of the cognate, assuming that tRNAs compete for tRNA
synthetases explains apparent high misacylation rates.

prediction of the cognate amino acid. Predictions are in
both cases intermediate. For this group, aminoacylation
might be determined by factors that are not grasped by
TFAM’s output, or by a combination of row- and column-approaches, meaning assuming a mixture of competition between tRNAs and competition between tRNA
synthetases (i.e. tRNAs compete only for tRNA synthetases from their corresponding class). For tRNAs Ile,
Leu CUN, Ser AGY, Ser UCN and Trp, results suggest
that the row-approach is not appropriate for determining the cognate amino acid, but the column approach is.
Hence for these tRNAs, aminoacylation specificity for
cognate amino acids seems determined by competition
among different tRNAs for the specific tRNA synthetase.
For tRNA Leu UUR, both approaches perform badly in
predicting the cognate amino acid.
Considering competition between tRNAs suggests that
further criteria can be relevant for correct tRNA aminoacylation. It makes sense to suppose that tRNAs with
low cloverleaf stabilities are poorer competitors. The
weakest structure is formed by tRNA Ser AGY, but,

according to TFAM, its aminoacylation potentials by
many tRNA synthetases are among the highest, perhaps
compensating its low stability. However, because of its
low structural stability, and probably even more because
its structure is inherently different from other tRNAs (it
lacks the D-arm), this tRNA is unlikely to win the competition for tRNA synthetases. This rationale, if adequately used, would probably still improve
aminoacylation specificities as estimated by TFAM.
These results on competition between tRNAs for aminoacylation versus competition between tRNA synthetases are worth developing further and probably will
yield deeper insights into tRNA aminoacylation by
tRNA synthetases. This however is not the topic of this
project. These analyses are presented here because they
show that the results from TFAM are biologically meaningful, though their interpretation is not as straightforward as one might have believed. The analyses
nevertheless show that TFAM’s output is not an artifact,
also when it predicts high misacylation potential. All
analyses in the Results sections use misacylation

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

potentials based on row analyses. Hence they have to be
interpreted as misacylation potentials in terms of competition between tRNA synthetases. They are meaningful
even if they suggest a low determinism in cognate aminoacylation. One has to keep in mind that this is
because only competition between tRNA synthetases is
taken into account, and not also between tRNAs. As the
latter (column-based) analysis would require a priori
knowledge of which tRNAs are expressed and which are
not, simple applications of these principles are impractical for antisense tRNAs, and hence inadequate in the
context of a project aimed at testing whether antisense
tRNAs are expressed.

General conclusions
The four properties of antisense tRNAs that were explored
and are relevant for accurate protein synthesis by such
antisense tRNAs (processing, misacylation tendency, cloverleaf stability (also corrected for association with sense
tRNA cloverleaf stability) and the accuracy of processing
by sense RNA maturation) are on average inter-related in
a way that some antisense tRNAs seem adapted for translational activity. This means that these antisense tRNAs
could be recruited for translation. These properties also
coevolve with genome-wide amino acid usage as one
would expect if these antisense tRNAs are active in translation and their evolution reacts to greater usage of their
cognate in protein synthesis in some species. The working
hypothesis implies that for antisense tRNAs expected
according to the above analyses to be routinely recruited
in translation, pathogenic mutations, as opposed to nonpathogenic ones, should decrease the tRNA’s capacity to
function in translation, while for those expected according
to the above analyses not to function in translation, pathogenic mutations should increase this capacity. These predictions will be explored elsewhere.
The fact that mitochondrial RNA maturation is largely
dependent on tRNAs signalling processing by forming
secondary structure makes mitochondrial genomes a
good system in which to test first the hypothesis that
antisense tRNAs are also sometimes expressed. The
results presented here, especially if confirmed by experimental results, indicate the possibility of functional antisense tRNAs in nuclear genomes, and particularly
prokaryotes. It is unlikely that sense-antisense coding is
restricted to mitochondrial tRNA genes.
Conclusions
1. Some antisense tRNAs could enrich the pool of
mitochondrial tRNAs.
2. Statistically, alignment methods predict sense and
antisense tRNA cognate amino acids that match better than expected by chance the amino acid predicted according to the anticodon’s identity.

Page 19 of 25

3. The anticodon of the antisense tRNA is usually
the complement of the sense tRNA’s anticodon. This
property is termed sense-antisense anticodon
symmetry.
4. In the rare cases where there is no anticodon
symmetry, the misacylation potential for the cognate
amino acid determined by the non-symmetric antisense anticodon is lower than for the regular, symmetry-determined cognate.
5. Antisense tRNAs processed during normal sense
RNA maturation are less misloaded than antisense
tRNAs not matured at any extremity, misacylated
antisense tRNAs form weaker cloverleaves, processing and acylation accuracies of antisense tRNAs are
positively correlated, and these correlate positively
with antisense tRNA cloverleaf stabilities.
6. Genome-wide amino acid usage correlates positively with the cloverleaf stability of the antisense
tRNAs loaded by that amino acid. Misacylation
potentials and processing inaccuracy of antisense
tRNAs tend to be inversely correlated with amino
acid usage.
7. Low success at detecting cognate amino acids for
mitochondrial tRNAs by alignment methods seems
due to focusing on aminoacylation specificity as
determined by competition among tRNA synthetases
for their substrate tRNA. Considering the opposite,
that in some cases, specificity results from competition between tRNAs for their tRNA synthetase
solves part of this puzzle.

Reviewers’ comments
Reviewer 1: Juergen Brosius

The author proposes that there are more, thus far
unrecognized, tRNAs in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, encoded on the opposite strand of known mitochondrial tRNAs, using a number of parameters
including correct secondary structure (how about prediction of three-dimensional structure?) and correct
aminoacylation. Going directly to core of the matter, I
analyzed some of our own cDNA libraries (unpublished)
made from small non-protein coding RNAs (npcRNAs)
in an attempt to verify predicted RNAs experimentally.
As a control, the bona fide tRNAs shown in Fig. 1 of
the submitted manuscript were analyzed as well.
Out of a total of ~80,000 reads from human tissue or

The first striking observation is that all four clones are
extended at the 5′ end by 11 nucleotides. In addition,
none of the four clones represent the 3′ end (with or
without posttranscriptionally added CCA end).

Page 20 of 25

The best explanation is that these clones do not represent bona fide tRNAs, but merely processing intermediates that are stable enough to be represented in our
cDNA libraries. A possibility that cannot be ruled out at
this point is that these RNAs, partially overlapping the
predicted tRNAs have a non-tRNA function. Further
work on phylogenetic conservation, especially involving
secondary structures would be revealing. As an aside,
the author often uses the term splicing, where the term
processing would be appropriate.

we did not find any clones and two of of the bona fide

cDNAs.
Author’s reply:
I am grateful for these useful comments, as well as for
the efforts invested at examining data according to my
hypothesis. The reviewer’s comment points out a major
flaw in my original manuscript. I neglected to discuss
the reasons why antisense tRNAs have not yet been
detected, as in the analyses by the reviewer which yield
unconvincing or negative results in relation to the antisense tRNA hypothesis.
The hypothesis that antisense tRNAs are functional in
regular translation in vertebrate mitochondria follows
the rationale of cost minimization. Indeed, because the
entirety of both DNA strands is transcribed to RNA, the
mitochondrion is more efficient when both sense and
antisense tRNAs are active in translation, because this
implies less waste of RNA. Therefore, one expects more
antisense tRNA activity in organisms that are more
selected for fast and efficient growth, development and
reproduction, namely r-selected, as opposed to Kselected species.
In order to test this, I examined correlations between
the length of gestation as an indicator inversely proportional to developmental rate (and reflecting the r-K continuum), and a general index of how much antisense
tRNAs are adapted to translational activity at mitochondrial genome-wide level in these species. For that purpose, I used the number of antisense tRNAs for which
less than half of the non-cognate amino acids have
greater aminoacylation potentials with the antisense
tRNA than the cognate amino acid, as an estimate of
correct aminoacylation of antisense tRNAs in that genome. Figures 7 and 8 plot this number as a function of
the length of gestation in primates and rodents, respectively. In both taxa, the correlation for antisense tRNAs
is negative and statistically significant at P < 0.05, as
expected by the hypothesis that r-selected species (with

short gestation) should be more efficient by using also
antisense tRNAs: species with fast development have
more antisense tRNAs with a tendency for correct aminoacylation than those with slower development. Hence
antisense tRNAs seem more adapted for translation, in
r-selected species. This also suggests that antisense
tRNAs are more expressed under stress conditions,
notably hunger and during fast development. The results
of reviewer 1 could make sense in this respect: under
normal conditions, one can assume that enzymes
degrading RNA, such as endoribonucleases, are
imported into the mitochondrion from the cytosol, and
degrade most RNAs before they become active in translation, besides those RNAs that are recognized as the
classical mitochondrial functional RNAs. Under stress,
such as hunger, one can expect less import (this process
is energetically costy). Therefore, enzyme-mediated
degradation should be slower under these conditions,
and under such circumstances, antisense tRNAs should
be more likely detected. I would therefore suggest that
translational activity by antisense tRNAs is more likely

to be detected in mitochondria which are under stress,
rather than under optimal conditions.
Reviewer 2: Anthony Poole

This work aims to address the hypothesis that mitochondrial genomes code for antisense tRNAs on the
opposite strand from those tRNAs already identified
(sense tRNAs). This is an interesting hypothesis, and
should certainly be investigated, especially given the fact
that a novel mitochondrial small RNA has recently been
characterised (Ref 44 - Yu et al. Biochem Biophys Res
372:634). The current manuscript has lots of detailed
computational and statistical analyses, but reading it, my
major criticism is that the analyses presented are unable
to answer the question at hand.
Robust testing of the hypothesis can be done using
established experimental procedures to screen for
expression of candidate antisense sequences, and
whether they are charged. Reference 44, where a previously undetected short mitochondrial RNA was
experimentally identified and demonstrated to be

charged, shows exactly how such experimental studies
can bear fruit.
The barrage of tests attempting to indicate these antisense sequences are functional, and the convoluted
arguments as to why tfam can be used for cognate
detection (despite obviously poor results) can only be
argued to carry any weight if these hypothetical antisense tRNAs can be demonstrated to be expressed.
While I do have a number of reservations regarding the
analyses presented, these seem minor compared to the
need to properly address the question using experiments. Without supporting experimental evidence, the
analyses are too weak to be anything more than vaguely
circumstantial, and discussing the details of these is
therefore academic.
I recommend that the author hold off on attempting
to publish this very preliminary work in Biology Direct
and instead contact an experimental group with whom
he might productively collaborate. Backed up with
experimental evidence, some of the analyses the author
presents may be more compelling.
Author’s reply:
The comments of reviewer 2 are very interesting as
these raise the question of how to hierarchise evidence

from different nature, in this case statistical patterns
versus direct experimental evidence. In my view, the fact
that statistical distributions of several antisense tRNA
properties tend to follow what one would expect according to the working hypothesis goes beyond the level of
circumstantial evidence, because assuming under such
circumstances that the working hypothesis is overall
correct is most parsimonious. My reply to reviewer 1
suggests that it is the absence of positive molecular evidence that might be circumstantial. This means that
direct experimental results are not necessarily more
convincing (at least not if they yield negative results)
than statistical patterns detected by analyses of bioinformatic data. In any case, the absence of molecular evidence in favour of the working hypothesis does not
discredit the relatively positive evidence presented here,
even if it is of ‘statistical’ nature. This is also true for
evidence from antisense antiterminator tRNAs [46],
which was not yet mentioned in the version of the
manuscript examined by the reviewer because it was not
yet published. There are reasons why functional antisense tRNAs have not yet been detected (i.e. my reply
to reviewer 1), and hence, if these exist, these are not so
easy to detect. It is probable that my ‘preliminary’

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/39

analyses are a necessary step to help find the organisms
and conditions at which antisense tRNAs are usually
active, sparing lots of experimental efforts by making
them more efficient, or even worse, leading to the publication of false negative results. Indeed, false positive
results are likely to be corrected by ulterior studies
repeating analyses. However, false negative results are
less likely to be corrected, because less inviting followup
studies. For example, in the present case, these studies
might have found negative results because mitochondria
were naively grown under standard optimal conditions
(see my answer to reviewer 1). In the absence of positive
results such as those presented here (including Figures 7
and 8), it is probable that preliminary negative results
obtained at optimal conditions would have discouraged
further experimental enquiries. Publishing positive evidence of the type described here will make little sense
after antisense tRNAs are detected by direct experimental methods, but is very useful in the present scenario
where such evidence is still lacking.
Reviewer 3: Andrei S Rodin

The author proposes that mt antisense tRNAs might
play an important role in translation, and presents
numerous arguments and analyses in support of this
notion. Some of them are more compelling than the
others; however, they work successfully in the complementary fashion. In general, I found the author’s logic,
approach and results to be mostly convincing and highly
interesting.
Author’s reply:
Thank you for the positive comments.
Statistical analysis. Firstly, the author should give a
clearer explanation of the choice between the one- and
two-tailed tests. Also, I am not sure that the multiple
testing correction procedures employed by the author
are a good fit in this case. One could argue that any
such procedure would be too conservative here, not just
Bonferroni, because (1) it is likely that the tests are not
in fact independent, and (2) we are not exactly sampling
from some underlying “true” distribution: what we have
a very “closed” system with just so many amino acids
and tRNAs. However, this strengthens (rather than
weakens) the author’s conclusions anyway. Potentially
more dangerous is the following: would it be appropriate to interpret a number of strong negative correlations
together with a number of strong positive correlations
as a bimodal distribution (instead of them simply cancelling each other out)? Finally, using parametric tests
with something like “misacylation potential” is debatable, since it is unclear how the variable in question is
distributed. Again, this does not really change the
author’s results/conclusions, but it brings us to another
important issue (see below)

Page 23 of 25

Author’s reply:
I am very grateful to the reviewer for his insightful
comments on the statistical side of my analyses. Indeed,
any multiple testing correction procedure is overconservative. I use these in the name of presenting results in a
conservative light. The reviewer also understands in
depth the complex issues at the core of dependent versus independent multiple tests. I tried to deal with these
in the simplest way. I do not have an answer in relation
to the bimodal distribution of results, in terms of statistical reduction, besides that bimodal distributions cannot, by essence, be reduced to analyses assuming
unimodality. Their existence consists in itself positive
evidence. I present for all correlational analyses parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients, to
deal with the potential problem of lack of normality in
the distribution of the variables. I believe that parametric statistics are more adequate for estimating an
effect (the stronger a correlation, the more we can
expect that antisense tRNA to be active in translation),
while non-parametric analyses yield more robust, conservative results. By presenting both, I believe that I give
a better quantitative description of the phenomenon,
while assessing it in relatively robust and conservative
terms. Model-based tests, which would combine these
advantages, are still less accessible to the average biologists, including myself.
Software and measurements. The author should put at
least a brief description of software (tfam, tRNAscan-SE)
in the beginning of the manuscript — what exactly does
it do? and how does it do it? What is the biological
interpretation of the output (scores, measurements,
etc.)? How are these quantities scaled/distributed? The
author does have a useful discussion on the robustness,
and biological meaning, of some of these in the Discussion section, but by that time it is too late. General Biology Direct audience might be unfamiliar with this type
of software and, more importantly, it is somewhat
unclear whether the traditional statistical tests (especially parametric ones) are applicable to the variables
thus generated.
Author’s reply:
I did not find a way to present the softwares earlier in
the flow of my text. I hope that the explanations given,
which have been expanded in the present version, are
sufficient. My view on parametric versus non-parametric
tests is given in the previous part of the reply.
Throughout the manuscript, the author concentrates
on four tRNA properties (leading to a series of pairwise
analyses) — however the actual numbers seem to vary
from three to six, which is confusing. Perhaps a more
explicit list/explanation is in order. The same applies to
the “Summarizing results for associations between antisense tRNA properties” section — why not summarize

Seligmann Biology Direct 2010, 5:39

the results in some sort of an easy-to-grasp cross-table,
each cell corresponding to a particular analysis?
Author’s reply:
The present version includes Table 6, which summarizes results for various pairs of variables.
