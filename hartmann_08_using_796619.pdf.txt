Abstract
Background: While full genome sequences are still only available for a handful of taxa, large
collections of partial gene sequences are available for many more. The alignment of partial gene
sequences results in a multiple sequence alignment containing large gaps that are arranged in a
staggered pattern. The consequences of this pattern of missing data on the accuracy of phylogenetic
analysis are not well understood. We conducted a simulation study to determine the accuracy of
phylogenetic trees obtained from gappy alignments using three commonly used phylogenetic
reconstruction methods (Neighbor Joining, Maximum Parsimony, and Maximum Likelihood) and
studied ways to improve the accuracy of trees obtained from such datasets.
Results: We found that the pattern of gappiness in multiple sequence alignments derived from
partial gene sequences substantially compromised phylogenetic accuracy even in the absence of
alignment error. The decline in accuracy was beyond what would be expected based on the amount
of missing data. The decline was particularly dramatic for Neighbor Joining and Maximum
Parsimony, where the majority of gappy alignments contained 25% to 40% incorrect quartets. To
improve the accuracy of the trees obtained from a gappy multiple sequence alignment, we
examined two approaches. In the first approach, alignment masking, potentially problematic
columns and input sequences are excluded from from the dataset. Even in the absence of alignment
error, masking improved phylogenetic accuracy up to 100-fold. However, masking retained, on
average, only 83% of the input sequences. In the second approach, alignment subdivision, the
missing data is statistically modelled in order to retain as many sequences as possible in the
phylogenetic analysis. Subdivision resulted in more modest improvements to alignment accuracy,
but succeeded in including almost all of the input sequences.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that partial gene sequences and gappy multiple sequence
alignments can pose a major problem for phylogenetic analysis. The concern will be greatest for
high-throughput phylogenomic analyses, in which Neighbor Joining is often the preferred method
due to its computational efficiency. Both approaches can be used to increase the accuracy of
phylogenetic inference from a gappy alignment. The choice between the two approaches will
depend upon how robust the application is to the loss of sequences from the input set, with
alignment masking generally giving a much greater improvement in accuracy but at the cost of
discarding a larger number of the input sequences.

Background
Advances in high-throughput sequencing and computational power have enabled phylogenetic analyses on an
unprecedented scale [1-3]. Large-scale phylogenetic studies of gene families can be used to clarify the relationships
among organisms [4,5] or to study the evolution and
function of the genes themselves [6,7]. Such analyses are
frequently restricted to only those genes for which a fulllength sequence is available, because partial sampling of a
gene family may diminish the accuracy of downstream
applications such as orthology assignment [8,9] and genetree reconciliation [10]. Thus, it would be desirable for
many applications to sample additional gene family
members from the much larger number of partial gene
sequences that are available.
Partial gene sequences are primarily derived from
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [11]. ESTs are generated by
isolating bulk mRNA from a given tissue, reverse-transcribing the mRNAs into cDNAs, cloning the cDNAs into
a vector, and then sequencing many individual clones
from one or both ends using universal primers. Because
overlapping segments of the same gene may be sequenced
multiple times, it is customary to assemble overlapping
ESTs into a single consensus unigene. Since even unigenes
rarely cover the full-length of their corresponding transcript sequences, multiple sequence alignments derived
from EST unigenes are often gappy. The gaps tend to be
clustered at the beginning and/or the end of each unigene
sequence, and the positions that are missing often overlap
but do not exactly correspond between unigenes (Figure
1). Typically, an alignment that contains EST unigenes
will also contain at least some genes that are full-length:
either because a complete genome sequence is available
for the species, because the cDNA for that particular gene
has been sequenced, or, more rarely, because the entire
gene is spanned by the unigene. We also note that other
high-throughput sequencing techniques [12] can lead to
similar patterns of gappiness and may eventually contribute a large proportion of the partial gene sequences in
public databases.
Gappy alignments present a number of difficulties for
phylogenetic analysis. First, phylogenetic inference is statistically compromised by a lack of data. Second, different
regions in an alignment do not necessarily have the same
intrinsic substitution rate due to differences in the
strength of purifying and positive selection. This may
introduce bias if these different regions are more complete
in some sequences than in others. One may overestimate
the phylogenetic distance between two sequences that
overlap in a fast-evolving portion of the alignment and
underestimate the phylogenetic distance between two
sequences that overlap in only the slowly-evolving
regions. Finally, for phylogenetic methods that utilize a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/95

pairwise distance matrix, it may not even be possible to
compute all pairwise distances due a lack of overlap
between some pairs of sequences.
The debate about how to deal with missing data in phylogenetic analysis (omit, ignore, impute, or model) is not
new [13-23]. A number of these studies have focused on
incomplete gene sampling when evaluating a superalignment approach to an incomplete multigene dataset
[20,24,25]. The general conclusions have been that the
relative amount of missing data is not the most important
factor in determining whether a correct phylogeny can be
computed. Instead, the absolute amount of available,
informative data within an alignment is more important.
Accurate phylogenies can be obtained even if up to half
the sequences within an alignment contain up to 90%
missing data [24]. However, the pattern of gappiness seen
in a superalignment (concatenated alignment), where
some genes are missing from some taxa, differs from the
pattern of gappiness due to partial gene sequences. In the
former case, the boundaries of the missing data blocks
strictly coincide among subsets of the sequences in a
superalignment, while in the latter case the gaps are staggered (Figure 1). To our knowledge, it has not yet been
determined whether the patterns of missing data in concatenated alignments and within EST-like alignments
have comparable effects.
Here, we use simulated data to specifically examine the
effects of EST-like gappiness on phylogenetic accuracy.
Our analyses are based on correct alignments, while in
real life situations, correct alignments are often unknown
and hard to compute, especially in regions that contain
gaps. Our alignments therefore represent the "ideal cases"
of true alignments. Using these simulated data, we explore
the contribution of a variety of factors by comparing
alignments that differ with respect to number of
sequences, tree topology, alignment length, and gap pattern. We have found that EST-like gappiness results in
lower accuracy than the pattern of missing data obtained
with incomplete gene sampling in a superalignment, even
in the absence of alignment error. To address this problem, we have compared two methods designed to increase
the accuracy of phylogenetic inference from a gappy alignment: alignment masking and alignment subdivision. In
alignment masking, certain alignment columns and input
sequences are excluded from phylogenetic analysis. In real
data, alignment masking may also be used to ensure the
positional homology of the columns that remain, to eliminate positions that appear to have undergone multiple
substitutions, and to exclude systematically misaligned
sequences in an automated alignment workflow.
Although alignment masking is most often based on subjective criteria, systematic approaches have also been
developed [26-28,51]. Because masking comes at the nec-

essary expense of failing to include some fraction of the
input sequences, we have also explored an alignment subdivision approach in which the data are partitioned into
subalignments with minimal gaps. The phylogenetic tree
is computed from a combined distance matrix estimated
by weighting the data from each subalignment and imputing missing data. We have found that both approaches
can improve the accuracy of phylogenies computed from
gappy alignments.

Results
In order to measure phylogenetic accuracy, we used a set
of simulated gappy protein alignments that resemble
those derived from EST data (see Methods for details).
Briefly, 540 full-length protein sequence families varying
with respect to their lengths, number of sequences, substitution rate, and tree topology were generated by the Rose
software package [29], and the true multiple sequence
alignments and phylogenetic topologies were recorded.
To simulate patterns of missing data comparable to those
obtained with EST unigenes, ten gap patterns were then
chosen based on protein sequence alignments in the Phytome plant comparative genomics database [30] and
applied to each of the full simulated alignments. In order
to separate the effects of EST-like gappiness from the
effects of missing data per se, we generated two types of
control alignments. For these, the same amount data were
removed as for the EST-like gappy alignments, but the residues to be deleted were either concentrated within alignment columns or randomly distributed throughout the
alignment (from here on referred to as column-deleted and
random-deleted, respectively).
Alignments with no missing data
We first tested whether the 540 full simulated alignments
contained sufficient phylogenetic signal to recover the
true trees using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Parsimony (MP), and Maximum Likelihood (ML). All comparisons of true trees with estimated trees are given as
standardized quartet distances stQD, which is a measure
of how many quartets, or sets of four sequences, differ in
topology between two phylogenies [31,32]. Our stQD
thus ranges from zero (no topological disagreement with
the true tree) to one (no quartets accurately inferred).
Results are shown in Figure 2A. The standardized quartet
distances for MP had a median of 0 and a mean of 0.0302
(i.e., on average, the topology of 3.02% of all possible
subtrees of size 4 differed between the inferred and the
true tree). For NJ, stQD had a median of 0 and a mean of
0.0134. For ML, stQD had a median of 0 and a mean of
0.0105. Taken together, these results confirm that the data
in the full simulated alignments are sufficient to allow
recovery of very nearly true trees, most of the time, using
all three phylogenetic inference approaches.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/95

Alignments with missing data
We then evaluated the extent to which missing data
within these alignments compromise phylogenetic accuracy, and the effect of EST-like gappiness relative to other
patterns of missing data. NJ, MP, and ML phylogenies
were computed for the 5400 EST-like alignments, the
5400 column-deleted alignments, and the 5400 randomdeleted alignments (green boxplots in Figure 2A). The
stQD values for the EST-like gappy alignments were substantially higher than for the full alignments, with a
median approaching 0.4 in the case of MP. The median
stQD for the column-deleted alignments was zero or very
close to zero, although the missing columns did lead to
some lengthening of the upper tail of the distribution of
stQD values. The difference in phylogenetic accuracy was
less pronounced between EST-like and random-deleted
alignments, and the rank order of performance among NJ,
MP, and ML was similar between these treatments. The
maximum stQD for MP in the random-deleted alignments
was 1.0, meaning that no quartets in the true tree were
accurately inferred.

Overall, ML had the highest accuracy and the least sensitivity to missing data. However, the performance of the
different algorithms depended to some extent on the
nature of the alignments used. In particular, the gap pattern had a major effect on the relative performance of the
different phylogenetic methods. For ≈13.5% of the ESTlike alignments, NJ resulted in the most accurate phylogeny. Of these, approximately 80% were generated using
gap patterns 1, 2, or 8. Of the ≈37% EST-like alignments
for which NJ resulted in the most inaccurate trees, 25%
each were generated using gap patterns 6 and 9. For
approximately ≈2.5% of the EST-like alignments, MP
yielded the best tree. Of these, 90% were the shortest
alignments (50 amino acids), 82% were the alignments
with only 10 sequences, and approximately 75% were
generated using gap patterns 7, 8, or 9.
Alignment masking
One common approach to preprocessing a gappy alignment prior to phylogenetic inference is to mask the alignment such that only columns and sequences containing
sufficient and reliable phylogenetic information are
included. Here, we used a simple algorithm we have
named REAP (REducing Alignments prior to Phylogenetic
reconstruction) [30], which is designed to mask (i) columns containing many gaps and/or highly diverse amino
acids and (ii) sequences that either have little overlap with
other sequences or appear to be systematically misaligned. In our simulated sequence families, since there
are no actual alignment errors in the simulated dataset,
REAP is discarding true phylogenetic information in the
data.

To determine the appropriate masking parameters to use
in this study, we conducted a factorial experiment in
which 36 parameter combinations were tested (see Methods). We recorded the number of sequences retained after
masking, and the stQD of the NJ tree. Because of the prohibitive amount of time that would have been required,
MP and ML trees were not calculated. We analyzed the
4901 (90.8%) of the alignments for which phylogenies
could be computed for all 36 parameter combinations
(i.e. at least four sequences were retained). Evaluation of
the computed phylogenies showed that the exclusion of
sequences with varying proportions of gaps had much
larger effects on phylogenetic accuracy than the exclusion
of gappy columns. Analysis of variance demonstrated that
all parameters had significant main effects, and a variety
of higher-level interactions were significant (results not
shown). The parameter with the largest marginal effect on
both accuracy and retention was gs, the maximum proportion of gaps allowed in a sequence. Overall, we found a
clear trade-off between the accuracy of the phylogeny
obtained and the proportion of sequences eliminated
from the alignment (Figure 3). Parameter settings of sc =
0.5, gc = 0.5 gs = 0.5 (see Methods) were determined to
strike the best compromise between topological accuracy
and sequence retention, regardless of window size. Thus,
unless otherwise noted, we used these parameters with a
window size of six for subsequent analyses.

using NJ, MP, and ML (Figure 2A, red boxplots). Quartets
involving sequences that were not retained by REAP did
not contribute to the calculation of stQD. For EST-like
alignments, masking greatly improved accuracy for all
three phylogenetic methods. The greatest improvements
were obtained using NJ and ML (where the median stQD
dropped from 0.246 to 0.002, and from 0.017 to 0.002,
respectively). MP trees improved less dramatically (the
median stQD dropped from 0.3438 to 0.2286). Results
were qualitatively similar for random-deleted alignments.
By contrast, masking of column-deleted alignments led to
less accurate trees using all three phylogenetic methods.
For NJ and ML, the masked column-deleted alignments
resulted in less accurate trees, on average, than the masked
EST-like alignments. This may be due to the nearly complete retention of sequences in the masked columndeleted alignments compared to approximately 80%
retention in the masked EST-like alignments (Figure 2B).
As can also be seen in Figure 2B, levels of retention were
similar for EST-like and random-deleted alignments.
To determine which factor(s) in the simulated alignments
(alignment length, evolutionary rate, number of
sequences, tree topology, and gap pattern) most affected
phylogenetic accuracy, we performed analysis of variance
on stQD of the NJ, MP, and ML trees after alignment
masking (Table 1). This analysis showed that overall, no
single parameter predominantly influenced the stQD values. Instead, all parameters had significant main effects.
Furthermore, several two-way and three-way interactions
were significant, as was the four-way interaction of
number of sequences, tree topology, alignment length,
and gap pattern.
Statistically correcting for missing data
In contrast to the approach of alignment masking, in
which data are excluded from the analysis, it might be
possible to improve phylogenetic accuracy by statistically
modeling the missing data. The approach we examined in
this study is called "SIA", for Subdividing Incomplete
Alignments (F. Cheng, S. Hartmann, M. Gupta, J. Ibrahim,
and T. Vision, in prep.) and is illustrated in Figure 4 (see
Methods for details). SIA attempts to estimate the distance
matrix that would be obtained in the absence of missing
data, thereby improving phylogenetic accuracy (using NJ
or another distance-based phylogenetic method) without
sacrificing sequence retention. In brief, the full multiple
sequence alignment is partitioned into subalignments
that have little to no missing data, and a distance matrix is
computed for each subalignment. A phylogenetic tree is
then computed from a combined distance matrix estimated by weighting the distance data from each subalignment and imputing missing data.

p ≤ 0.001***, p ≤ 0.01**, p ≤ 0.05*; parameters: length = alignment
length; rate = evolutionary rate; seqs = number of sequences in the
alignment; topol = tree topology of true tree; gap = gap pattern
applied to full alignment. SIAa refers to the full SIA trees, while SIAb
refers to the pruned SIA trees.

In our implementation of SIA, EST-like alignments
yielded an average of four subalignments (and a maximum of 16), with a mean subalignment length of 58.9
columns. Column-deleted alignments predictably yielded
only one subalignment, while the random-deleted alignments yielded a prohibitively large number of potential
subalignments ( x = 53.4) and thus could not be analyzed
for comparison. NJ phylogenies could be computed for
5,237 of the EST-like families. Of the 163 families that
were discarded, 80 with gap pattern 6 and two with gap
pattern 10 had too many missing pairwise distances to
impute values using the four-point metric (see Methods).
The remaining 81 families were discarded by REAP due to
insufficient alignment data.
The median percentage of sequences retained within a
family was 100%, while the median stQD was 0.24 (Figure 2). Thus, the phylogenetic accuracy obtained by SIA is

comparable to that obtained by masking followed by MP,
but with substantially higher retention of sequences. Since
the SIA trees include more sequences than the masked
trees, and the additional sequences might be among the
most problematic to place accurately in the tree due to
their reduced length, a fairer comparison would be to
compute stQD for a pruned SIA tree having the same set
of sequences as the masked tree. Pruned SIA trees had a
median stQD of 0.13, which, though better than
unpruned SIA trees, is still less accurate on average than
obtained by masking followed by NJ or ML. To determine
which (combinations of) parameters used to generate the
alignments significantly affected the phylogenetic accuracy, we performed ANOVA on stQD for both full and
pruned SIA trees. The results generally agreed with those
from alignment masking: all simulation parameters had
significant main effects and contributed to higher-level
interactions (Table 1; SIAa: full trees, SIAb: pruned trees).
Algorithm performance relative to simulation parameters
For a more detailed comparison of results for the SIA
approach and alignment masking followed by either NJ,
MP, or ML, we compared stQD among the 3,527 families
for which we were able to compute phylogenies for all
four methods. We also examined variation in stQD among
the ten gap patterns. We found that alignment masking,
when followed by either NJ or ML, resulted in the most
accurate phylogeny in ≈72% of cases (approximately 36%
each for NJ and ML), and that alignments with 60
sequences were over-represented in this set. Alignment
masking followed by MP resulted in the best trees for ≈9%
of the families. Of these, almost 70% were alignments of
length 50, nearly 70% contained 10 sequences, and
approximately 60% had gap patterns 5 or 7 applied to
them. In only ≈7% of the families, the SIA approach
resulted in the most accurate phylogeny. Of these, 80%
were the shorter alignments, 70% were those to which gap
pattern 8 had been applied, and 64% had only 10
sequences. In approximately 20% of all families, no difference was observed across any of the methods. These
were in most cases perfect phylogenies (stQD = 0). All of
these were alignments of 10 sequences, and masks 9 and
10 were overrepresented among them (36% and 33%,
respectively).

Discussion
ESTs and other partial gene sequences are the predominant source of sequence data for a large and taxonomically diverse set of species. These sequences are
tremendously valuable for gene discovery, genome annotation, comparative genomics, marker development, and
a variety of other uses [11,33]. However, for studies of
gene family evolution or for large-scale analyses of gene
families, one must contend with the large amount of missing data in alignments derived from partial sequences. For

example, of the ≈27,000 families in the Phytome database
[30] for which there are three or more sequences, the average proportion of alignment gaps is 37%.
Are these missing data really a problem? We found that it
was possible to recover accurate trees from alignments in
which the missing residues were clustered into columns.
Even though half of the simulated alignments had
between 50% and 60% missing data, the median stQD for
the NJ and ML trees were 0, and the median stQD for the
MP trees was 0.004. These results confirm that the presence of missing data itself does not lead to an incorrect
phylogeny as long as sufficient data is available for the
analysis [20,22,24,25].
However, EST-like gappy alignments appear to be qualitatively different. When the same amount of missing data
was distributed in a pattern typical of EST unigenes, phylogenies were much less accurate: mean stQD for trees
computed from these alignments ranged from 0.17 for ML
to 0.34 for MP. When using NJ, the phylogenetic accuracy

was even lower for the EST-like gappy alignments than for
alignments in which the same number of residues were
randomly deleted. One explanation for these results is
that for the random-deleted alignments, there is at least
some overlap between all the pairs of sequences. For the
EST-like gappy alignments, on the other hand, it is common for some pairs of sequences to share no columns in
which data are present (e.g. see gap patterns 5, 6, 9 and
10), and thus no distance can be computed. This poses
particular problems for distance methods. For example,
PHYLIP reports a distance of "-1.0" for any two sequences
that do not overlap in the input alignment. This is taken
at face value during execution of the NJ algorithm, leading
to a systematic bias toward overly close relationships
between sequences in the tree as a result of the lack of
overlap between them. The importance of the distribution, and not just the amount, of missing data, was shown
earlier in a different context by Wiens [24]. In that study,
lower accuracy was obtained when missing genes were
randomly distributed among the sampled taxa, compared

Page 8 of 13

to data sets in which the missing genes were restricted to
monophyletic subsets of taxa.
We have shown that one can improve phylogenetic accuracy by taking either one of two diametrically opposed
approaches. In the first approach, one excludes gappy columns and sequences from the analysis through alignment
masking. In our implementation of masking (REAP), we
mimic the way it would be performed on real data by also
excluding columns and rows that show evidence of misalignment, even though there is no alignment error in our
simulation. Most of the trees computed from masked
alignments using either NJ or ML methods were comparable to those computed from alignments without any missing data (mean stQD of 0.0022 and 0.0026 vs. 0.0 for full
alignments). Even for MP tress, alignment masking was
able to improve the trees approximately to the level of
unmasked NJ trees (stQD of 0.2286). While this may be
due solely to the removal of gaps, it may also reflect the
removal of alignment positions that have undergone multiple substitutions, thus making the phylogenetic signal
clearer in those that remain. Either way, one cannot
escape the paradox that the phylogeny is made more accurate by ignoring error-free alignment input. Another
important point is that alignment masking comes at the
necessary expense of failing to retain all the sequences. On
average, 27% of the sequences within an EST-like alignment were excluded by masking in our experiments.
A very different approach is to attempt to model the missing data, which we have done through a technique we call
alignment subdivision. Relative to masking, we found
that our implementation of alignment subdivision (SIA)
was able to retain a much higher proportion of the
sequences; the median proportion of retained sequences
using SIA was 100%. SIA generally, though not universally, led to more accurate trees than those computed
directly from the gappy alignment. The greatest improvements in accuracy under SIA were seen in those families
that had many subalignments. Where incomplete alignments were divided into 12 or more subalignments, SIA
resulted in a more accurate phylogeny in almost all cases.
On the other hand, when there were only two subalignments, the phylogeny computed directly from the original
alignment was more accurate two-thirds of the time. Perhaps not surprisingly, the number of subalignments was
closely associated with the gap pattern used in the simulation. Gap patterns 1, 2, 3, and 8 typically resulted in only
one to four subalignments, while gap patterns 6, 9, and 10
typically resulted in a much larger number; thus, certain
gap patterns are intrinsically more likely to see an
improvement under SIA than others.
The improvement in phylogenetic accuracy was generally
much higher with masking than with subdivision. NJ trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/95

computed from EST-like alignments were over 100-fold
more accurate with alignment masking (stQD = 0.002)
than when directly computed (stQD = 0.246). The same
differential was only about two-fold when using SIA
(stQD = 0.127). The phylogenetic accuracy using SIA was
thus comparable to the masked MP trees and the
unmasked ML trees. Furthermore, the SIA approach is
computationally laborious. Taken together, our results
suggest that alignment masking is the preferred approach
when the distribution of missing data is EST-like in
nature.
While it appears from our results that alignment masking
is not necessary when ML is used to infer the phylogeny,
this may reflect the lack of alignment error in the simulated data. Although under some circumstances, the
choice of phylogenetic inference method is known to
have a major effect on phylogenetic accuracy [34], previous studies have shown that both alignment accuracy [3537] and the ratio of phylogenetic signal to noise in the
alignment [38] can be even more important than the
choice of phylogenetic method. While we have not studied the effects of misalignment due to using partial gene
sequences as input, we suggest that alignment error is
likely to improve the relative performance of masking.
In modeling the missing alignment data, we have estimated the distance matrix that we would expect to see in
the absence of missing observations. To further develop
and optimize the SIA method, other approaches for combining subalignments can be tested in future studies. For
example, we have imputed pairwise distances that could
not be computed from the submatrices using a four-point
metric [18,39]. Future implementations of SIA could be
improved by incorporating a three-point metric or a
weighted least-squares imputation [18,23,40]. However,
because only 17.5% of the cells in the combined matrices
were missing, we expect the difference in imputation quality to have only minor effects on the results. Alternative
approaches that model the missing alignment data probabilistically or by imputation would allow more accurate
(likelihood or Bayesian) phylogenetic techniques to be
applied while still retaining all the input sequences.
Another interesting approach would be to infer phylogenies separately for each subalignment and then calculate a
supertree for the full dataset [41].

Conclusion
Given that the vast majority of publicly available sequence
data from complex genomes is derived from large-scale
partial gene sequencing projects, it would be a serious
handicap to limit phylogenetic analyses to alignments
derived only from full-length sequences. However, we
have shown that the particular pattern of gappiness found
in alignments of partial gene sequences needs to be han-

dled with care in order to obtain accurate phylogenies.
Both masking and model-based approaches to missing
data show potential for improving the accuracy of the
trees obtained from gappy alignments. Their performance
will have to be compared to other approaches to deal with
incomplete alignments [14,23]. Such methods will be
critical for the application of techniques that rely upon
large numbers of accurate gene trees, as is common in
phylogenomics [4,6].

Methods
Generating simulated alignments
We used the software Rose [29] to simulate 540 families
of evolutionarily related and correctly aligned protein
sequences. Each sequence family member was derived by
successive substitution from a common ancestor along a
defined evolutionary tree. Insertions and deletions were
disallowed. Substitution probabilities were given by a
PAM transition matrix [42]. As a starting sequence we
used the first 50, 200, or 500 amino acids from the Capsicum chinense phenylalanine ammonia-lyase protein (Genbank Accession AAC33966.1). Our sequence families
differed with respect to four factors (see [29] for definitions): length (50, 200, or 500 amino acids), the number
of sequences (10 or 60), substitution rate (uniformly fast
with a substitution probability of 1.0, uniformly slow
with a substitution probability of 0.5, or a mosaic with
probability of 1.0 and 0.5 alternating every 15 residues),
and tree topology (fully asymmetric, fully symmetric/balanced, or a randomly generated intermediate). The chosen sequence lengths represent typical ranges found in
sequence family databases such as Phytome [30]. Branch
lengths of the input trees for the software Rose were
adjusted such that the average relatedness for all pairwise
sequences of a given sequence family was the same (250
PAM). Variability of sequences and sequence-regions was
then reduced where the mutation probability was set to
0.5. For each of the 54 parameter combinations, we generated 10 replicate families that sampled independent
random substitutions.
Simulating missing data
EST-like alignments
To simulate patterns of missing data comparable to those
obtained with EST unigenes, we selected ten multiple
sequence alignments from Phytome [30], which contains
multiple sequence alignments of both full-length proteins
and protein sequences inferred from EST unigenes. The
ten selected alignments ranged in length from 155 to 648
amino acids and from 14% to 60% missing residues (Figure 1). We selected alignments that contain exactly 60
sequences and that represent the typical range of missing
data found in sequence alignments that contain EST data.
With respect to other parameters (e.g., species representation or gene function), these alignments were chosen ran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/95

domly. Gap patterns seen in these real alignments were
then applied to each of the 540 simulated alignments (see
Figure 1), resulting in a set of 5400 EST-like gappy alignments. Because the lengths of the real and simulated
alignments differed, the positions and lengths of the gaps
in the real alignments were scaled to the length of the simulated alignments (i.e., longer alignments have longer
gaps than shorter alignments). Most of the gaps we apply
are not from indels but from incomplete sequencing and
occur at one end or both ends of a sequence. In real data,
such gaps would be expected to increase in size with the
length of the unigene, as in our simulation. The ten alignments on which gap patterns were based contained
exactly 60 sequences, so one sequence in the gap pattern
was used, without replacement, as the template for one
sequence in the experimental alignment. For the simulated alignments of ten sequences, only the first ten
sequences in the gap patterns were used as templates.
Control alignments
For the control alignments, we also used the ten gap patterns described above to delete residues from the 540 full
artificial alignments as before, but the residues to be
deleted for these controls were either concentrated by column (column-deleted), or randomly distributed throughout the alignment (random-deleted). For the 5400 columndeleted alignments, columns of characters, i.e., all residues at a given alignment position, were randomly
selected without replacement and deleted. In the 5400
random-deleted alignments, the same number of total
residues per sequence as in the corresponding gap pattern
were independently and randomly selected for deletion,
without replacement (Figure 1).
Masking
The alignment masking algorithm REAP works in two
steps by first discarding columns and then discarding
sequences. Let Sijv be the score for the aligned residue pair
from sequences i and j in position v according to some
substitution matrix. In this study, we used the PAM250
substitution matrix [42]. First, REAP evaluates sliding windows of w columns along an alignment with m columns
(residue positions) and n sequences. Columns are discarded when the proportion of gap characters exceeds a
threshold gc, or when the mean sum-of-pairs score within
the window

is lower than a threshold sc. Counting only those columns
that remain, a sequence i is discarded when the proportion of gap characters exceeds a threshold gs, or for when
the mean sum of pairs score to all other sequences

is equal to or lower than ss.
To determine the optimal alignment masking parameters,
the following REAP parameter values were tested: window
sizes of w = 3, 6, sum-of-pairs threshold scores of sc = 0.5,
1.0, 1.5, column gap thresholds of gc = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and
sequence gap thresholds of gs = 0.5, 0.7. Because there is
no alignment error in the simulated data, the sum-of-pairs
score threshold for eliminating misaligned sequences was
not varied but instead held constant at a value of ss = 0.25.
All 5400 EST-like gappy alignments were masked with
each of the 36 different combinations of variable REAP
parameters and the resulting masked alignments were
input to phylogenetic analyses as described below.
Phylogenetic estimation
We computed a phylogeny for each replicate using NJ,
MP, and ML. Unrooted NJ phylogenies were computed
using the PHYLIP programs Protdist (with the JTT substitution matrix) and Neighbor [43]. ML phylogenies were
computed using RAxML-VI [44,45], again with the JTT
matrix. All other RAxML settings were defaults. Strict consensus MP phylogenies were computed using TNT [46]
with the tree-bisection-reconnection search procedure.
Since preliminary tests showed no appreciable difference
in the results whether 10 or 500 random addition
sequences and 10 or 100 ratchet iterations were used in
TNT, we used 10 random addition sequences and 10
ratchet iterations for analysis of the full dataset.
Statistically correcting for missing data
The SIA algorithm takes an alignment as input. An overlap
graph is constructed in which each sequence is represented
by a node, and the edges between nodes are weighted by
the number of shared nongap alignment characters
between the two sequences. Using the Bron-Kerbosch
algorithm [47], maximal cliques of at least three vertices
are identified at a given weight threshold. Cliques represent subsets of vertices in which each pair of vertices is
connected by an edge, and these correspond to sets of
sequences with sufficient overlap for computation of pairwise distances among all clique members. Each column of
the sequence alignment is then assigned to the clique containing the maximal number of sequences with non-gap
characters in the column. Columns tied between two or
more cliques are assigned to the clique with the fewest
total columns (i.e., the blue columns in Figure 4). The columns assigned to a given clique are concatenated to generate a subalignment. Masking is then performed to
remove sequences from the subalignment that consist pri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/95

marily of gaps. For this, we used REAP (described above)
with the following parameters: sc = 0.5, ss = 0.25, gc = 0.1,
gs = 0.5 and w = 3 and discarded subalignments with fewer
than three columns. In order to identify cliques with common sequence pairs, a subalignment graph is computed in
which each subalignment is represented by a node and
undirected edges are drawn between subalignments having at least two sequences in common. The connected
component that represents the largest number of subalignments is then chosen and the others are discarded. In
the absence of any connected components with more
than one subalignment, the clique with the largest
number of columns is chosen. For subalignments containing more than two columns, pairwise distance matrices are then computed, as above, which results in one or
more submatrices.
The submatrices were then combined into one matrix by
a linear model in which the distances in each submatrix k
are scaled by a factor that takes into account (i) the relative
rate of substitution for the columns in each submatrix relative to the alignment as a whole and (ii) the relative
uncertainty in that estimate as a function of the length of
the subalignment. A number of recent papers propose
similar methods for combining data from different partitions of a phylogenetic dataset [48,49]. For computational
convenience, we computed scaling factors directly from
the simulation parameters rather than estimating them
from the data. Since the scaling factors are computed
without estimation error, the phylogenetic accuracy of
this approach will be lower on real data. The details of the
model and estimation approach that would be applied to
real data are described in a companion publication (F.
Cheng, S Hartmann, M. Gupta, J. Ibrahim, T Vision, in
prep).
Here, we calculated the relative substitution rate for subalignment k based on the average substitution rate of the
columns in the subalignment sk and the average substitution rate of all columns in the alignment st
rk = sk/st
These rates are known from the ROSE parameters. The
scaling factor was then weighted based on the number of
columns in a given subalignment

γk = rk/wk
The weighting term wk is based on that used with real data,
and reflects the fact that the precision of the estimate varies with subalignment length. For a subalignment mk, it is
computed as

The motivation for wk is that subalignments with larger
number of columns are expected to have less variation in
their pairwise distance values.
Pairwise distances that were were not present in any submatrices were imputed using a four-point metric that
requires five of the six pairwise distances for four
sequences be known and assumes additive tree distances
among the sequences [18,39]. The combined matrix with
imputed missing values was then used to compute a phylogeny using Neighbor Joining.
Computing phylogenetic accuracy
We compared the estimated trees with the true trees by
measuring the Quartet Distance (QD) [31,32] as implemented by Mailund and Christiansen [50]. The QD
between two phylogenetic trees is the number of quartets,
or sets of four sequences, that differ in topology (placement of the internal branch) between them. Since QD is
dependent on the number of possible quartets, and this
differs among comparisons, we calculated standardized
quartet distances by dividing QD by the total number of
possible quartets.

stQD =

QD
⎛n⎞
⎜ ⎟
⎝4⎠

where n is the number of sequences in common between
the two phylogenies. stQD therefore ranges from zero to
one.

Different measures for comparing phylogenies exist, but
unfortunately all of them can be inadequate in some
cases. We chose the quartet distance for this study because
it is appropriate when major rearrangements of individual
taxa are expected, as was expected for our data [48]. For
example, two phylogenies in which only the positions of
two taxa are switched (e.g., (A,(B,(C,(D,(E,(F,(G,(H,
Z)))))))); (Z,(B,(C,(D,(E,(F,(G,(H, A)))))))); ), have no
bipartitions in common, but the corresponding quartet
distance still appropriately reflects the similarity of their
topologies.
