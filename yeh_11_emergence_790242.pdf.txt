Abstract
Background: Development of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181T/sW172* mutant could occur during prolonged
lamivudine (LAM) therapy, conferring cross resistance to adefovir. Recent studies demonstrated an increased
oncogenic potential of this mutant in NIH3T3 cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of
this finding.
Methods: Serum samples from 123 LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B patients were submitted for virological assays.
A highly sensitive amplification created restriction enzyme site (ACRES) method was devised to detect small
amounts of the rtA181T mutant in the serum. Virological factors including HBV-DNA level, genotype, precore
G1896A, BCP A1762T/G1764A, rtM204I/V, rtA181T and pre-S internal deletion mutations as well as clinical variables
including subsequent use of rescue drugs were submitted for outcome analysis.
Results: By use of the highly sensitive ACRES method, the rtA181T mutant was detectable in 10 of the 123 LAMresistant patients. During the mean follow-up period of 26.2 ± 16.4 months (range 2 to 108 months), 3 of the 10
(30.0%) rtA181T-positive patients and 2 of the 113 (1.8%) rtA181T-negative patients developed hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the presence of rtA181T mutation (P < 0.001), age > 50 years
(P = 0.001), and liver cirrhosis (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with subsequent occurrence of HCC. All 5
HCC patients belonged to the older age and cirrhosis groups.
Conclusions: Emergence of the rtA181T/sW172* mutant in LAM-resistant patients increased the risk of HCC
development in the subsequent courses of antiviral therapy.

Background
In the past decade, much progress has been made in
antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection [1-3]. Several approved therapeutic agents are
now available, including regular or pegylated interferon
and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NA) such as lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dipivoxial (ADV), entecavir
(ETV), telbivudine and tenofovir [3-7]. Although NAs
are very effective in inhibiting HBV reverse

transcriptase, long-term usage of NAs is required to
reduce the risk of hepatitis relapses on drug withdrawal.
This strategy leads to development of drug resistance, a
major challenge for hepatologists. The risk of developing
LAM resistance is 14-32% in the first year and up to
70% by the fifth year [4]. The most frequently encountered LAM-resistant mutant is rtM204V/I, which possesses a mutation located at the catalytic YMDD motif
[8-11]. The rtL180M mutation usually occurs concurrently with the rtM204V mutation and serves as a compensatory mutation [11]. The rtA181T mutation has
also been reported in a substantial proportion of LAMresistant patients, which has been shown to confer

LAM-resistance in cell-based assays [10]. Because of the
overlap between the S and polymerase genes, a great
proportion of patients carrying the rtA181T mutation
also possessed the sW172* nonsense mutation, resulting
in truncation of the pre-S/S reading frames [10].
The risk of developing ADV resistance was 2-3% and
28-29% by the second and fifth years of monotherapy in
treatment naïve patients respectively [12-14]. The risk
increased to 21% in LAM-resistant patients who were
switched to ADV monotherapy after 1.5 years of ADV
therapy [2,3]. The major ADV resistant mutants were
rtN236T and rtA181T/V [5]. Resistance to ETV is rare
for treatment naïve patients (1.5% by the fifth year) [2].
However, in the presence of rtM204I/V mutations, ETV
resistance can occur if the rtI169T, rtT184A/F/G/I/L/S,
rtS202G/I, or rtM250V mutation coexists [15,16]. The
risk of developing telbivudine resistance was 2-3% and
21% after 1 and 2 years of therapy in treatment-naïve
HBeAg-positive patients respectively. The major resistant mutant was rtM204I [17]. Tenofovir has recently
been found to be effective in suppressing HBV replication with a low risk of drug resistance and several
reports have shown that this drug is effective against
various NA resistant or cross-resistant mutants [18,19].
It has been demonstrated that in patients with compensated cirrhosis, LAM therapy significantly reduces
the risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) [20]. However, in patients who developed LAM
resistance, this beneficial effect was drastically compromised. Several strategies of therapy have been examined
in LAM resistance patients, including withdrawal of
LAM therapy, switching to ADV monotherapy, ADV
add-on treatment, and switching to ETV monotherapy.
The latter two strategies are accepted in several therapeutic guidelines [21]. Despite various efforts to develop
effective rescue therapy for LAM-resistant patients,
severe consequences such as HCC and liver failure still
occur in a small number of patients [22-24].
Previous studies have indicated that several virological
factors including HBV-DNA level, HBV e antigen
(HBeAg) status, genotype, pre-S internal deletion
mutant and basal core promoter (BCP) A1762T/
G1764A mutation are closely associated with development of HCC in treatment naïve, chronic hepatitis B
patients [25]. However, the associated virological factors
for severe disease outcomes in patients with LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B have not been clearly delineated.
A major reason these patients are started on long-term
LAM treatment early in the course of their disease is to
prevent the occurrence of HCC. The development of
LAM-resistance significantly compromises the effectiveness of this strategy. It is imperative that the clinical
and virological factors associated with the development
of HCC in this group of patients be delineated. In this

study, we analyzed the clinical variables, virological
parameters, and use of rescue agents to identify factors
associated with severe disease outcomes.

Methods
Patients

This study was conducted under the approval of the
institutional review board of Chang Gung Medical Center. The clinical records of 157 patients who received
LAM and developed drug resistance from January 2002
to December 2007 were reviewed. Of these patients, 123
were included because they had serum samples stored
in the Liver Research Center Serum Bank that could be
retrieved for virological analysis. All patients were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative
for antibody against hepatitis D virus or antibody against
hepatitis C virus. All patients were also tested negative
for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The following clinicopathological data were retrospectively
reviewed: gender, age, presence of liver cirrhosis, HBeAg
status, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the duration
of LAM use before inclusion, subsequent use of ADV or
ETV, total duration of NA use, and development of
HCC or liver failure. None of the patients had detectable liver tumors (except hemangiomas) during the 3
years period prior to entry into this study. Monitoring
of HCC occurrence was performed by measurement of
AFP levels and ultrasonography every 3 months in cirrhotic patients and every 6 months in non-cirrhotic
patients. Diagnosis of HCC was made by either echoguided liver biopsy, fine needle aspiration cytology, high
AFP level (> 200 ng/mL) plus at least one dynamic imaging study (dynamic computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging), or one dynamic imaging study plus
angiography (if alpha-fetoprotein < 200 ng/mL).
Serum hepatitis markers, including HBsAg, HBeAg,
and antibody to hepatitis D virus were assayed by commercially available kits (Ausria-II and HBeAg-RIA,
Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL; and anti-HD;
Formosa Biomedical Technology Corporation, Taiwan).
Serum antibody to hepatitis C virus was assayed using a
third-generation enzyme immunoassay kits (HCV EIA
III; Abbott Laboratories).
Virological assays

The HBV-DNA concentration was quantified by use of
Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HBV Test
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The detection
limit of this test was 69 copies/mL. In this test, 5.82
copies/mL was equivalent to 1 IU/mL. HBV genotypes
were determined using the restriction fragment length
polymorphism method or phylogenetic sequence analysis [26]. The methods to detect HBV basal core

promoter (BCP) A1762T/G1764A mutations, precore
stop codon G1896A mutation, rtM204I mutation,
rtM204V mutation, rtL180M mutation were described
previously [10,26]. To identify pre-S internal deletion
mutations, the pre-S region flanked by P1, 5’GCGGGTCACCATATTCTTGGGAAC-3’ (nt. 2821 to
2844, sense) and P2, 5’-GAGCAGGGGTCCTAGGAATC-3’ (nt. 196 to 177, antisense) was amplified by
PCR. The expected size was 596 bp in length. These
PCR products were subjected to Southern blot analysis
to identify positively hybridized bands < 500 bp in
length. PCR products 500 to 596 bp in length were gelpurified and subjected to direct sequencing to identify
pre-S deletion mutants with small deleted regions (<
100 bp in length). If a mixture of wild type and deletion
mutants was found by direct sequencing, the gel-

purified PCR product was cloned to pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 10-15 clones were
sequenced to identify the deletion mutants.
Previous studies indicated that the rtA181T mutant
usually coexisted with wild type or mutant type viruses
as a mixture [10,13]. As such, we developed an amplification created restriction enzyme site (ACRES) method
to detect a small percentage of the rtA181T mutant. As
shown in Figure 1A and 1B, a partially mismatched primer was designed. A1, 5’-CTATGGGAGTGGGCCTCAGTCCCATTC-3’ (nt. 641-667, sense; mismatched
nucleotides underlined). This primer and A2, 5’GTTTAAATGTATACCCAGAGAC-3’ (nt. 840-819;
antisense) were used for PCR. Owing to the mismatched
nucleotides, a BST X1 site was created in the PCR product (200 bp) if wild type sequence (but not mutant

deletion (b). The pre-S sequence with or without small deletions (a) was gel-purified and sent for sequence analysis.

type) was amplified. The PCR product was then digested
with BST X1. The wild type amplicon could be digested
to generate a band of 170 bp in length, leaving the
mutant amplicon undigested. The mutant amplicon was
then gel-purified and sent for direct sequencing for confirmation. In a PCR reaction, this method was capable
of detecting 100 copies of mutant when mixed with 103
to 107 copies of wild type HBV-DNA (≦ 1% of mutant
could be detected) and 10 copies of mutant when mixed
with 100 copies of wild type HBV-DNA (10% of mutant
can be detected under low copy numbers of HBVDNA).
Statistical analysis

Parametrical data were expressed in mean ± standard
deviation (SD) when assumed normal distribution but in
median (range) when they were not. Student-t test or
Mann-Whitney test was used when appropriate. Fisher’s
exact test was used for dichotomous data. Logistic
regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of the clinical and virological variables with
occurrence of the rtA181T mutant. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate the accumulative incidence
of HCC and the log-rank test was used to compare
between groups. The Cox proportional hazard model
was used to identify independent clinical and virological
factors associated with HCC occurrence. Alpha error
was adjusted according to the method of Bonferroni
correction in multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis
was conducted by the use of SPSS (version 13.0).

Results
Genotypic characterization

Virological assays were performed for all 123 chronic
hepatitis B patients developing LAM-resistance. The difference in the prevalence of BCP A1762T/G1764A mutation between genotype B and C HBV was statistically
significant (P < 0.001; Table 1). In this study, 3 patients
had small (< 100 bp) pre-S internal deletions, 27 had large
(> 100 bp) pre-S internal deletions, and 2 had both kinds
of pre-S deletions (Figure 1C). These 32 patients were
grouped for analysis. The rtA181T mutation was detected
in 10 patients. In these patients, the rtA181T mutation
was accompanied by the sW172* mutation in the S reading frame. Additionally, small and large pre-S internal
deletions were observed in 1 and 5 patients, respectively.
No significant association was found between different
genotypes and other clinical and virological parameters.
Of the 123 LAM-resistant patients, 58 (47.2%) subsequently received ADV (switch or add-on) rescue therapy,
20 (16.3%) received ETV (switch) rescue therapy, and 24
(19.5%) received ETV and ADV therapy sequentially secondary to the emergence of additional drug resistant
mutants during their treatment courses. The remaining 21
(17.1%) patients continued to receive LAM monotherapy
either because they had only mild hepatitis activities or
because of barriers to access of rescue therapy.
Clinical and virological factors associated with HCC occurrence

Patients were followed for a mean period of 26.2 ± 16.4

patients developed HCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the association between HCC occurrence and each of the clinical and virological variables
(Table 2). It was found that only age > 50 years (P =
0.001), the presence of rtA181T mutation (P < 0.001),
and liver cirrhosis (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with occurrence of HCC (Figure 2). No statistically significant difference was found between those
with and without pre-S internal deletions. Multivariate
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis using the
forward stepwise model showed rtA181T to be the only
variable that remained in the equation as an independent predictor (Hazard Ratio, 21.443; 95% CI, 3.556 to
129.302; P = 0.001).
Among the three signficicant factors, it was found that
all 5 HCC patients belonged to the older age (> 50 years
of age) and cirrhosis groups (Figure 2). In this study, 23
patients (18.7%) met both clinical criteria. In this subset
of patients, the cumulative incidence of HCC was 21.7%
in a mean follow-up period of 22.0 ± 13.0 months. Clinical course of the 5 HCC patients were reviewed (Figure
3). It was discovered that rescue antiviral therapy was
successful in 3 of the 5 LAM-resistant patients (patient2, 3, and 5). In patient 1 and 4, rescue therapy was
delayed because of barriers to access. In patient 1, the
liver biochemistry data improved after initial hepatitis
exacerbation. Notably, in the three patients with
rtA181T mutants (patients-1 to 3), a relatively high level
of HBV-DNA (> 104 copies/mL) persisted for at least 10
months.
Clinical and virological factors associated with severe liver
consequences

Three patients developed acute liver failure during the
follow-up periods. Of these 3 patients, 2 had severe
hepatitis exacerbations at 2 and 2.5 months respectively
after detection of LAM-resistance. These two patients
died of hepatic decompensation. The third patient developed liver failure 3 months after detection of LAMresistance, but he underwent liver transplantation within
1 m. Taken together, 8 patients (5 with HCC and 3 who
progressed to liver failure) developed severe consequences of liver diseases. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the association between severe liver
consequences and each of the clinical and virological
variables (Table 2). It was found that age > 50 years (P
= 0.001), the presence of rtA181T mutation (P < 0.001),
BCP A1762T/G1764A mutations (P = 0.002) and liver
cirrhosis (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with
severe liver consequences. No statistically significant difference was found between those with and without preS internal deletions. Notably, no association was found
between disease outcomes and HBV-DNA level or use
of rescue drugs (Table 2). Multivariate Cox proportional

Page 5 of 10

hazards regression analysis using the forward stepwise
model showed rtA181T to be the only variable that
remained in the equation as an independent predictor
(Hazard Ratio, 13.091; 95% CI, 3.255 to 52.653; P <
0.001).
Factors associated with development of rtA181T mutant

Since rtA181T mutation was identified as an independent predictor for severe consequences of liver disease
including HCC and liver failure, linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with
emergence of rtA181T mutation (Table 3). With Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, P < 0.0029
was considered statistically significant. It was found that
only older age was significantly associated with development of rtA181T mutant (OR, 1.144; 95%CI, 1.0561.240; P = 0.001).
Multiple linear regression analysis using the forward
stepwise method showed that age (OR, 1.126; 95% CI,
1.032 to 1.229; P = 0.008) and cirrhosis (OR, 5.671; 95%
CI, 1.063 to 30.248; P = 0.042) remained in the equation
as independent predictors.

Discussion
LAM is the first approved oral antiviral agent for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis B and has been therefore
widely used as the first line therapeutic agent in the past
decades. Despite the availability of other NAs carrying
lower risk of drug resistance (such as ADV and ETV),
LAM remains to be a popular anti-HBV agent in many
parts of the world because of its low cost, excellent
safety profile in long term use, and absence of oncogenic potential in animal studies. However, because of
widespread use, an increasing number of LAM-resistant
patients have emerged.
Currently, the most widely accepted strategy for rescue therapy is ADV add-on treatment [21]. The de novo
development of the cross-resistant mutant, rtA181T,
was about 4% in a 4-year period of combination treatment with LAM plus ADV [27]. Previous studies also
suggested effective viral suppression in LAM-resistant
patients by adopting ADV or ETV monotherapy. However, it was found that the risk of developing ADV or
ETV drug resistance was high with this strategy [21].
Recently, it was shown that tenofovir is superior to
ADV in treating LAM-resistant patients with a better
viral suppression and no detectable genotypic resistance
[18,19].
Despite the availability of rescue therapy, severe disease outcomes still occurred in a substantial percentage
of patients. Previous studies indicated that successful
viral suppression in ADV add-on therapy did not prevent HCC occurrence in patients with liver cirrhosis
[22,24]. This study demonstrated that age > 50 years,

cirrhosis, BCP mutation, and the presence of the
rtA181T mutation, prior to initiation of rescue therapy
were significantly associated with severe liver consequences. Interestingly, neither the choice of rescue
drugs nor the duration of antiviral drug use seemed to

affect the clinical outcomes of these patients. In fact of
the 21 patients receiving LAM monotherapy, only 1
developed HCC. It is possible that rescue therapy was
not initiated in these patients because they had mild
hepatitis despite development of drug resistance.

Figure 2 Factors associated with occurrence of HCC. The cumulative incidence of HCC was depicted according to the presence of the
rtA181T mutation (A), use of rescue therapy (B), the presence of liver cirrhosis (C), and age > 50 years (D).

Figure 3 Clinical courses of 5 HCC patients from entry to the study to development of HCC. The changes of ALT level (gray lines) and
HBV-DNA level (black line) were depicted. Arrow, time-point of HCC diagnosis; Solid bar, duration of LAM used; Shaded bar, duration of ETV
used; Empty bar, duration of ADV used.

Notably, two important variables, HBV-DNA level and
pre-S internal deletion mutants, which were frequently
identified as prognostic indicators in treatment-naïve
patients were not found to be associated with clinical
outcomes in LAM-resistant patients. It is likely that during rescue therapy in these patients, HBV replication
was suppressed to a low level, resulting in reduction in
the development of the pre-S internal deletion mutations. In this view, the pre-S internal deletion mutants
are unlikely to play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in this subset of patients.
The most striking finding in this study was that preexisting rtA181T mutant in LAM-resistant patients was
independently associated with severe liver consequences,
especially occurrence of HCC. The rtA181T mutant has
been shown to confer ADV-resistant [28-30]. In ADV
add-on studies, it was found that rtA181T mutants
could be either pre-existing in LAM-resistant patients
or de novo-developed after ADV add-on therapy [27].
Furthermore, because the reading frame of HBV

polymerase overlaps with that of the S gene, some resistant mutations (such as rtA181T) in the polymerase
gene coexist with S gene mutations, including stop
codon mutations [31]. In some patients with rtA181T
mutants, a concomitant sW172* mutation was observed
in the overlapping S reading frame, resulting in truncation of the pre-S/S proteins [32]. Several previous studies have reported the transactivation activities of a
truncated pre-S2 mutant isolated from the chromosomal
integrated HBV genome of hepatoma cells. Such
mutants were capable of transactivating several promoters including those of oncogenic proteins [33]. Transactivation activity occurred only when the premature stop
codons are located within a region of the S gene, named
“transactivity-on-region” [34]. The premature stop
codon of the S gene in the rtA181T/sW172* mutant
was located near the border of the transactivity-onregion and its transactivating activity was recently confirmed [35,36]. Additionally, owing to secretory defect
and a dominant negative effect on wild-type HBV virion

secretion, emergence of rtA181T/sW172* largely
reduced the typical extent of virological breakthrough in
serum, resulting in difficulty to recognize drug resistance [32]. In this study, a hypersensitive ACRES
method was used to detect small percentages of the
rtA181T mutants. Of the 10 rtA181T-positive patients,
the mutants constituted < 5%, 10-30% and > 90% of the
viral population in 6, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. We
speculated that despite a small percentage of the
mutants was detected in the serum, a larger percentage
could exist in the liver, owing to the secretory defect of
the sW172* mutant. Presumably, intrahepatic accumulation of this mutant partially contributed to its oncogenic
effect.
Finally, in our study, 23 patients had two unfavorable
conditions: liver cirrhosis and older than 50 years of
age. During the follow-ups, 5 of the 23 patients (21.7%)
developed HCC and 7 of the 23 (30.4%) patients developed severe liver consequences. The present data indicated that in this special subgroup of patients, careful
selection of antiviral agent and closely monitoring for
viral mutants (including BCP and rtA181T mutations)
are mandatory.
