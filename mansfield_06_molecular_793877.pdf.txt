Abstract
Background: A panel of 37 rabies virus isolates were collected and studied, originating mainly
from the northern and central regions of Namibia, between 1980 and 2003.
Results: These virus isolates demonstrated a high degree of genetic similarity with respect to a
400 bp region of the nucleoprotein gene, with the virus isolates originating from kudu antelope (n
= 10) sharing 97.2–100% similarity with jackal isolates, and 97–100% similarity with those isolated
from domestic dogs. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these viruses were all of the canid rabies
biotype of southern Africa. The viruses from kudu were closely associated with jackal isolates (n =
6), bat-eared fox isolates (n = 2) and domestic dog isolates (n = 2) at the genetic level and identical
at the amino acid level, irrespective of the year of isolation.
Conclusion: These data suggest that jackal and kudu may form part of the same epidemiological
cycle of rabies in Namibian wildlife, and might demonstrate the close-relationship between rabies
virus strains that circulate within Namibia and those that circulate between Namibia and its
neighbouring countries such as Botswana and South Africa.

Background
The Republic of Namibia is a large country of 824268 km2
situated on the south Atlantic (West) coast of Africa. It
shares borders with South Africa in the south, Botswana
and Zimbabwe in the east, and Angola and Zambia in the
north (Figure 1 – refer to additional file 1). Namibia is
sparsely populated, with the Namib desert stretching
along the western coast and the Kalahari desert along the

south-eastern border with Botswana. However, Namibia
provides for an abundance of wildlife with its twenty-six
parks and nature reserves, the most familiar of which is
the Etosha National Park in the north of the country.
Classical rabies virus (RABV; genotype 1) has a singlestranded, negative-sense RNA genome, and is a member
of the Rhabdoviridae family, within the genus Lyssavirus. In

addition to RABV, the lyssaviruses circulating in Africa
include Lagos bat virus (genotype 2), Mokola virus (genotype 3) and Duvenhage virus (genotype 4) [1]. Classical
rabies viruses circulating in southern Africa can be further
sub-divided into two distinct biotypes, canid and viverrid
[2]. Monoclonal antibody typing has confirmed the existence of these two distinct groups, with the wildlife-associated mongoose (viverrid) biotype appearing more
phylogenetically diverse [2-5]. The canid biotype infects
carnivores of the family Canidae, primarily the domestic
dog (Canis familiaris), jackal (Canis mesomelas, the blackbacked jackal) and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) [5].
The mongoose (viverrid) biotype principally infects the
yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) which maintains
the virus, whereas in reality there is no evidence that true
viverrids (such as civets and genets) are maintenance
hosts of RABV [5]. Mongoose rabies is likely to have been
endemic throughout southern Africa (including Namibia)
prior to the advent of canine rabies. Although of importance over the vast area of southern Africa, mongoose
rabies is less threatening to human and animal health and
is consequently difficult to trace in history [5].
Rabies is a notifiable disease in Namibia [6]. Here, as early
as 1887, a disease outbreak among dogs, cattle and other
livestock was presumed to be rabies, given the disease
symptoms [7,8]. Nevertheless, the first confirmed case

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/2

dates back to 1906, to the coastal town of Swakopmund
[8]. Rabies is particularly common in the northern parts of
Namibia; the Ovambo, Kavango and the Caprivi (bordering on Angola and Zambia), where sporadic reports of
rabies (unconfirmed) involving dogs, bovines and
humans occurred throughout the latter half of the 1920s.
These reports of rabies coincided with reports from the
southern parts of neighbouring Angola [1,8]. For example, in Ovamboland, northern Namibia, a number of people died at a Mission Hospital in 1926, with hydrophobia
and a history of having been bitten by rabid dogs [9]. By
the end of World War II in the 1940s, a rabies epizootic
ensued in Angola and Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia)
and spread southward into Namibia and Botswana. It is
probable that dogs were solely responsible initially, but
jackals soon became an important reservoir and remains
so at the present time [10]. Thus canine rabies entered
Botswana and Namibia during the late 1940s from southern Angola/Zambia [6], and was later found to be phylogenetically different from the endemic mongoose
(viverrid) strains previously circulating in these regions
[3]. Rabies cycles in the black-backed jackal appeared
soon after the introduction of dog rabies in Namibia [11].
Thereafter, with the involvement of jackals, the disease
spread southwards, past the Etosha National Park to reach
Outjo, then Otjiwarongo and later the capital Windhoek,
by 1951 [12]. This canine epizootic continued to spread
through Namibia and Botswana and into the northern
Transvaal (Republic of South Africa) during the early
1950s, where it spilled over into jackals and bat-eared
foxes (Otocyon megalotis) [2]. Canid rabies in southern
Africa is thought to be derived from a single virus lineage
that most probably originated from Europe and may have
been introduced into West Africa by slave-trading Europeans, after 1500 AD. Phylogenetically, the viruses capable
of maintaining prolonged and independent cycles of disease throughout canid host populations of sub-saharan
Africa, particularly domestic dogs, jackals and bat-eared
foxes, are strongly linked to the global 'cosmopolitan lineage' of rabies virus strains of European descent [13,14].
By the mid-1970s there was sporadic but endemic rabies
throughout most of Namibia, generally with dog and
human rabies in the more populous north, jackal and cattle rabies in the central ranching areas and sporadic canid
or mongoose rabies in the arid sheep farming areas of the
south [1,8].
The unusual occurrence of rabies in the kudu antelope
(Tragelaphus strepsiceros) was first observed in 1975 near
Windhoek. However an epizootic of rabies in these antelopes began to the north in Okahandja district in 1977
and was in the same year that rabies was first confirmed in
two kudu in the Etosha National Park. The number of
confirmed cases rose steadily throughout 1978–1979

[15], spreading westwards along the Swakop River and
then north and south during 1978 [8]. The latter part of
the epizootic (1983–1984) coincided with the first cases
of lions contracting the disease in the Etosha National
Park. It is thought that the lions became infected from
hunting rabid kudu, as all four reports of rabid lions were
from an area of high kudu population density in eastern
Etosha [16]. This kudu epizootic peaked in 1980, but had
eventually subsided by 1985 [8], by which time it caused
an estimated loss of 30–50 000 antelope, or 20% of the
population [1]. However, during 2002 there was another
substantial outbreak in kudu, where an estimated 2500
animals on more than 81 farms in Namibia died [17].
This outbreak continued into 2003.
The kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) is a wild ruminant with
spiralling twisted horns, and is generally found in areas of
broken rocky terrain where there is easy access to water
[8]. In Namibia, the main food source for the kudu is the
leaves of Acacia species, including Acacia hereroensis (Berg
thorn), along with a variety of other plants in the savannah woodland [8]. They spend most of the year living in
small herds of four to six animals [8] which eat and move
together, and have close contact with each other through
activities such as mutual grooming [15]. These groups will
split up during the breeding season, but will come
together again later. Contact between different social
groups can occur at watering places, along with the possibility of contact with other species [15]. Farm fencing that
is usually effective for cattle and gemsbok does not control
the movement of kudu [15], as the kudu can easily jump
a 1.2 m fence [8]. The social behaviour of kudu has contributed to the spread of rabies, and it is thought that
mouth lesions from the browsing of thorn-bushes may
have been a contributing factor due to the presence of
RABV in saliva [15].
The kudu epizootics in Namibia have provided an example of non-bite transmission, with horizontal spread
between kudus [18], and posed a threat to human health
via the game breeding and hunting industries in Namibia.
At the time of the 1977–1983 epizootic, kudu constituted
more than 60% of the game farming trade, therefore
rabies-infected kudu were a threat to both the consumer
and hunter of game [15].
Phylogenetic analysis has been a useful tool in the study
of rabies epidemiology [19], and will aid in establishing
divergence in the RABV isolates being studied throughout
the world. In this study, phylogenetic analysis of a partial
region of the nucleoprotein gene was undertaken, on a
panel of 60 sequences derived from rabies viruses from
Namibia (n = 37 from our study; n = 3 from Genbank)
and neighbouring countries. The Namibian panel
included eleven sequences from kudu, isolated in 1980 (n

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/2

= 1), 1987 (n = 1, obtained from Genbank) and 2003 (n
= 9) at the time of the second kudu epizootic. The aim of
this study was to provide an insight into the rabies situation in Namibia, in particular the complex interaction
between urban and sylvatic cycles of RABV, and the maintenance of cycles in different species including kudu.

Results
A cohort of 40 Namibian RABV sequences, mainly isolated in the central to northern parts of the country and
from a variety of species, but including 11 isolates from
kudu antelope, were studied. Cluster analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a 400 bp region of the nucleoprotein
gene demonstrated 22 unique sequences. Three of these
sequences were obtained for multiple isolates and are represented collectively by groups A-C (Figure 2 – refer to
additional file 2).
Strains from the most frequently recovered group (Group
A) were geographically located in the northern districts of
Grootfontein and Etosha, and contained one virus isolate
from kudu, two from jackal and one from a dog from
Grootfontein (RV1496, RV1502, RV1509, RV1513), along
with three isolates from jackals and one hyena sample
from the Etosha National Park (RV1505, RV1506,
RV1507, RV1519). However, strains of group A were not
restricted to this area. This group also included a single
isolate (RV135), which was collected from a kudu in
South Africa in 1980.
A second group of identical sequences (Group B) originated from more central regions of Namibia and comprised two isolates from kudu from the Okahandja district
(RV1490, RV1493), two isolates from kudu and one from
an eland from the Omaruru district (RV1489, RV1491,
RV1518), and one isolate from a kudu from Windhoek
(RV1488). The jackal group (Group C) contained three
isolates from jackals around Windhoek (RV1501,
RV1503, RV1504), one from a jackal in the Khorixas district (RV1498) and one from a jackal in the Okahandja
district (RV1497). Also demonstrating 100% similarity
with respect to this region of the N-gene were two virus
isolates from kudu from the neighbouring regions of
Windhoek and Okahandja (RV1487, RV1492). Finally,
two virus isolates from dogs in the Oshikoto and Oshakati
districts (RV1510, RV1511) were also found to share identical sequences. With the exception of RV135, sequences
represented by multiple isolates were geographically
localised (Figure 1 – refer to additional file 1). The
remaining 17 unique sequences represented Namibian
isolates collected from kudu, jackal, bat eared foxes, dogs,
humans and a single mongoose. The Namibian isolates
formed a large diffuse group representing a canid biotype
and were closely associated with previously reported
Africa 1b isolates [20] (Table 1). The mongoose isolate

(RV1917), collected from Keetmanshoop in Southern
Namibia, was more similar to bat-eared fox isolates from
South Africa than to the other Namibian isolates or to the
previously designated mongoose biotype isolate RV396
(Figure 2 – refer to additional file 2).
The phylogenetic relationships between the Namibian
rabies virus isolates and those from neighbouring countries for the 400 bp region of the N-gene are shown with
isolate RV396 included as an outgroup (Figure 2 – refer to
additional file 2). Urban and sylvatic Namibian isolates
were not resolved into two clear groups in the tree. Indeed
dog and jackal isolates were distributed throughout the
Namibian group. A discrete cluster of domestic dog isolates (RV1830, RV1514, RV447, RV395, RV1875, RV1510
and RV1511) may represent an urban cycle, however, this
group does not have full bootstrap support and includes a
single jackal isolate (9227NAM).
The Namibian isolates are seen to cluster in two groups,
however, the resolution of these groups is not supported
by bootstrap analysis. The upper group comprised
sequences from all of the kudu, 8 jackals, 2 dogs, 2 bateared foxes, an eland and a hyena. With the exception of
the kudu isolate from South Africa (RV135), all of these
isolates originated from Namibia. With the exception of
RV1500 and RV1499, all of the isolates in the upper cluster had identical deduced amino acid sequences in the
400 bp region.
Unlike all other species analysed in this study, all of the
virus isolates from kudu clustered together (Figure 2 –
refer to additional file 2). Isolates from species such as
jackals and domestic dogs were dispersed throughout the
tree. Five of the kudu isolates from Central Namibia
(Group B) shared 100% sequence similarity with an isolate from eland antelope (RV1518) from Omaruru suggesting that the kudu and eland hosts of this viral strain
originate from a similar geographical area in Namibia,
and are involved in the same epidemiological cycle (Figure 1 – refer to additional file 1). Kudu isolates from the
most recent epizootic are closely related to two earlier
(1980) isolates obtained from kudu near Windhoek,
Namibia (RV1843) and South Africa (RV135). Grouping
closely (but more distantly) was a kudu rabies isolate
from 1987 (8708NAM). The lower group comprises several clusters representing various isolates from Botswana
and South Africa along with more discrete clusters of jackals and domestic dogs from Namibia. Of the five domestic
dog viruses within this group, suggestive of an urban
cycle, four were isolated from dogs in northernmost parts
of Namibia (RV1510, RV1511, RV1514, RV1830), whilst
the fifth was identified in a dog in Maun, in Botswana
(RV447). These cases are clearly related and probably
indicate a dissemination event related to the transport of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/2

companion animals. This group also contains another
dog from Windhoek in Namibia (RV1875), and a dog
from Mochudi in neighbouring Botswana (RV395). Interestingly, the six isolates from Namibian jackals (Group C,
RV1508) and one from a Namibian dog (RV1517), are
closely related to a cohort of isolates from Botswana from
jackals (RV385, RV472, RV481), domestic goats (RV474,
RV475), a dog (RV471) and a cow (RV386). These data
demonstrate the dispersion of closely-related canid
viruses within Namibia and neighbouring Botswana.
A jackal isolate (RV1841) is the most similar of the South
Africa Group to the Namibian and Botswanan canid isolates demonstrating again the close relationship between
isolates from neighbouring countries due to the movement of such species. The mongoose species responsible
for isolate RV1917 has not been identified but it is most
likely to have been a yellow mongoose, which is commonly found in the Southern Namibian region of Keetmanshoop. The spillover of canid biotype into mongoose
hosts is also demonstrated by the inclusion of the South
African water mongoose isolate (2900AFS) (Figure 2 –
refer to additional file 2).
Dendrograms generated for the partial G-gene (nucleotide
co-ordinates 3375–3974) and N-gene analyses were congruent (data not shown). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequence (1000 bp) yielded no
significant improvements in terms of either the bootstrap
values or topography (data not shown). Phylogenetic
analyses of the dataset using either the maximum likelihood (DNAML) or parsimony (DNAPARS) programmes
within the PHYLIP package did not improve the resolution of isolates or demonstrate significant differences in
topography or bootstrap support (data not shown) which
lends support to the co-existence of closely related urban
and sylvatic rabies cycles in Southern Africa.

Discussion
The molecular sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the
Namibian rabies virus isolates described here, has demonstrated a high degree of similarity between isolates originating from different species, emphasising clearly the ease
of transfer of RABV throughout Namibian wildlife, and
between wildlife and domesticated species.
The demonstration of two epidemiological cycles of RABV
circulating in southern Africa is well documented. Within
the canid biotype of RABV there appears to exist two epidemiological cycles [21]; an urban (canid) cycle within
the domestic dog population, and a wildlife (or sylvatic)
cycle which occurs among the jackal, kudu and bat-eared
fox populations. Interestingly, the isolates from mongooses (Viverridae) have been shown to be phylogenetically distinct from the canid biotype [3]. Our data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/2

provides further evidence for the existence of these two
cycles in Namibia. However, urban and sylvatic isolates
were not fully resolved on our tree, which indicates that
the wildlife and urban cycles of RABV existing in Namibia
are closely-related. Indeed, our data suggests that canid
isolates from Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia form a single diffuse group representing both urban
and sylvatic cycles which interact with each other and may
have a recent common ancestor. The propensity of certain
strains of RABV to survive may be host-dependant, and it
has been suggested that the evolution of viruses may
reflect that of the host species [5]. This may lead to the
suggestion that the kudu clade simply indicates a host
switch or host range expansion unique to a particular lineage of RABV, as the passage of viruses within different
host species may enhance the evolution of the viruses
when they are being cycled among a number of different
host species [5]. However, although the process of recombination can aid the generation and spread of advantageous genotypes (natural selection), it has previously
been shown that recombination is unlikely in negativesense RNA viruses such as RABV [22].

there are many dogs and little wildlife. In this region,
rabies is detected mainly in dogs, and poses a threat to
human and bovine health [6]. According to OIE figures,
and excluding kudu data, cases of animal rabies in
Namibia have been increasing gradually, with 123 in
2000, 153 in 2001, 162 in 2002 and 214 reported cases in
2003 [17]. This increase in cases of canid rabies in the
north of Namibia has continued to escalate in 2004 and
2005 and constitutes, at the present time, an increasingly
serious problem of human and animal health in northern
to central Namibia, for which urgent control actions are
required to prevent human fatalities. During 2003, most
of these cases were recorded in domestic dogs, cattle and
wildlife. The majority of reported cases in Namibia are
found in the central stock-ranching region, where human
population density is low, and wildlife plentiful [6]. In
this region of large commercial farms, most cases are
found in cattle and the black-backed jackal, and appear to
follow a seasonal pattern, with an increase in cases in all
species from June to November. During these months,
rainfall is low and animals have to increase their home
range in the search for water and food [6].

A number of clinical signs have been observed in kudu
infected with RABV, the most common of which is loss of
fear [23]. An infected kudu often appears completely
oblivious to its surroundings; it loses its fear of both
domestic animals and man, and has often been observed
walking into houses and garages and even approaching
vehicles. This may explain a likely route of transmission
and infection of the two dogs with a sylvatic strain of
RABV; the dogs may have bitten or licked the dead or
dying kudu. A larger data set may determine the nature of
the domestic dog isolates (RV1513 and RV1516) in what
would otherwise be a cluster of sylvatic isolates. However,
the addition of more viruses may provide further evidence
of a common urban and sylvatic canine rabies cycle
observed in previous studies [3,21]. Previous work has
suggested that the cycles of RABV are maintained in the
jackal population, and that dog cases result from fights
with rabid jackals [6]. Although the jackal is not a domesticated species, when infected with RABV it can appear
'tame' and is commonly observed around watering places
where it can attack cattle, domestic animals and humans
[21]. It is clear that jackal and dog rabies cycles are closely
linked to such an extent that the likelihood of jackals sustaining independent rabies cycles remains a controversial
issue. These data confirm however, the interconnected
nature of dog and jackal rabies cycles in southern Africa.

During the years preceding the 1977–1983 rabies epizootic in kudu, above-average rainfall and abundant
growth of vegetation made Namibia a very favourable
environment for kudu and the population had greatly
increased [8]. Furthermore, farmers had exterminated
many large predators of the kudu because they also killed
livestock, and there was little hunting of the kudu due to
the preservation of the species for 'trophy-hunting' tourism. All of these factors contributed towards a large overpopulation of kudu in Namibia [8], which further assisted
the spread of the epizootic. During the epizootic, severe
drought conditions may have forced the kudu to move
further north in the search for more plentiful supplies of
food and water [8], which caused further dissemination of
the disease.

RABV clearly poses a threat to human and animal health
in Namibia and throughout the African continent, as
demonstrated by the similarity between viruses from
neighbouring countries. The highest population density
in Namibia is located in the north of the country, where

Our analysis confirms that the RABV strains that infected
the kudu population during both epizootics was of the
canid biotype. This biotype however, was phylogenetically distinguishable from the group of viruses isolated
from Herpestidae such as the yellow mongoose [3]. The
earlier epizootic in kudu was most likely initiated by a
jackal bite, as peaks of rabies incidence in kudu and cattle
coincided with peaks in jackals, although the incidence in
kudu appeared to far exceed that in jackals [8]. Furthermore, our results suggest that the jackal and kudu share
the same epidemiological cycle of rabies in Namibian
wildlife, and that the probable source of infection in the
later 2002 epizootic was from the canid biotype most
probably the black-backed jackal or perhaps the domestic
dog, as genetic analysis grouped these species most closely
with the kudu. Although the jackal is the most likely can-

didate, from a behavioural and ecological point of view,
bat-eared foxes are considered an ideal vector for the
transmission of RABV [24]. However, although our results
show two bat-eared foxes from Etosha (RV1826, RV1827)
also grouping with the kudu, they are not clustering as
closely to the kudu as the dogs or jackals so are less likely
to be the source of infection.
The high degree of similarity among the kudu isolates suggests that once RABV enters this species it spreads rapidly
through the population with little interaction with other
species. The kudu population then appears to maintain its
own cycle of RABV infection. Epizootic observations at the
time of the kudu outbreak suggest a horizontal spread of
RABV throughout the species, particularly as the only
other wild herbivore affected was the eland [23]. The
number of confirmed cases, the rate of propagation and
the size of the area affected suggest that it would have
been impossible for such a large number of cases to have
been caused by other species such as the jackal or mongoose. The outbreak of RABV in kudu was an epidemiological rare event, and any reasons as to why rabies was
maintained within the kudu population are purely speculative. Since the kudu are not a naturally aggressive species, this would suggest that the spread of virus
throughout the population was by non-bite transmission,
and the horizontal spread of RABV from kudu to kudu via
a non-bite route has previously been suggested [15];
indeed studies have shown that kudu are highly susceptible to oral and/or nasal infection, with infected kudu
often having a high concentration of virus in their saliva
[18]. Kudu commonly receive mouth lesions from grazing
on the thorny acacia plants, which are the first trees to bud
in spring. Grazing kudu can leave saliva deposits on the
acacia plants, which may contain RABV if the animal is
infected. The thorns of the acacias are inconspicuous, but
can cause severe wounds which provide a prime route of
entry for the virus [8]. Unlike other species, kudu are
social-leaf eaters, often browsing the same plant together
[25], and providing an easy mode of transmission. Subsequently, we postulate that this is also the most likely route
of virus transmission from kudu to kudu during the latter
2002 epizootic in Namibia.
This theory is however, not exclusive. An alternative
hypothesis for the non-bite route of transmission of RABV
throughout the kudu population has been suggested.
Kudu live in small herds which remain together, moving
and feeding at the time and living in relatively close contact [8]. One of the most common symptoms of a rabies
infection in kudu is the production of continuous copious
amounts of saliva [8]. Mutual grooming is common in
animals which exist in small close groups, so a kudu
attempting to lick a dead or dying RABV-infected kudu
could potentially come into contact with infected saliva,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/2/2

which is then transmitted to the healthy kudu through
any thorn lesions in the mouth. It is likely that the transmission cycle could be maintained by a combination of
these proposed hypothetical routes. In addition, with the
initial introduction from a canine cycle into a kudu cycle,
secondary kudus may also become infected by a victim
animal through the licking of an open wound which has
retained infected saliva obtained from attack by a rabid
animal (such as a jackal). This theory is similar to that
applied to mongooses which live in communal burrows
and are thought to transmit RABV by the salivary gland
route [5].
Our data suggest that the isolates studied show a high
degree of genetic similarity between a range of species and
geographical locations and demonstrates how closelyrelated the RABV strains circulating in Namibia are to
those from neighbouring countries such as Botswana and
South Africa.

Conclusion
The epidemiological cycles (urban and sylvatic) of RABV
circulating throughout the countries of southern Africa are
complex, with a large number of vector species and the
existence of at least two distinct biotypes of RABV (mongoose and canid). Different species appear to maintain
their own cycles of infection, such as that by non-bite
transmission seen in the kudu during the epizootics. Our
data suggests that jackal and kudu may form part of the
same epidemiological cycle of rabies in Namibian wildlife. The canid biotype is now highly established throughout southern Africa. This makes any control programme
difficult to implement, due to the large variation in species and habitat. We believe that rabies is highly prevalent
and widespread in southern Africa and that the disease
poses a continual threat to a large variety of wildlife species, to livestock and to human health.

Methods
Viral isolates
A panel of thirty-seven viruses isolated from kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas),
domestic dog (Canis familiaris), eland (Taurotragus oryx),
bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), mongoose and hyena
(Crocuta crocuta) between 1980 and 2003 were sequenced
(Table 1). With the exception of the mongoose isolate
(RV1917), the viruses were isolated from host species
from a wide area in the northern and central regions of
Namibia (Figure 1 – refer to additional file 1, Table 1).
One kudu isolate was collected in Namibia, in 1980, during the first epizootic. Nine kudu isolates were obtained in
2003, at the time of the second epizootic.

swana, Zambia and South Africa were also included in the
analysis (Table 1). A domestic cat isolate from Botswana
(RV396), previously designated as belonging to the viverrid (mongoose) biotype was included as an outgroup
(Table 1).
Extraction of RNA
RNA was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) following
the manufacturer's instructions, and resuspended in
HPLC purified water (Sigma Aldrich). RNA was then
diluted to 1 µg/µl in HPLC water, and stored at -80C.

RT-PCR and sequencing
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were
performed as described previously [4] using the combination of primers JW12, JW6 DPL, JW6 M and JW6 E. PCR
cycling was as described previously [26]. Positive reactions produced a 606 base pair (bp) fragment, corresponding to position 55 – 660 of the nucleoprotein gene.

PCR products were purified using the QIAquick™ PCR
Purification Kit, and sequenced in both directions using
either the Big Dye Kit (Applied Biosystems), or the Beckman QuickStart kit (Beckman-Coulter), with primers at
3.2 pmole/µl. Forward sequences were produced with
primer JW12, whereas reverse sequences were obtained
using either JW6 DPL or JW6 UNI (CARTTVGCRCACATYTTRTG).

Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences were edited to 400 bp using the
DNAstar programme (DNAstar Inc. Madison, USA). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the Clustal W programme [27] and the transition-transversion
ratio (2.73) was estimated using the Puzzle programme
(Version 4.0.2) [28]. The data set was analysed using the
DNAdist (maximum likelihood parameter) and Neighbour Joining programmes within the PHYLIP package
[29]. For comparison the dataset was also analysed using
the DNAML and DNAPARS programmes within the
PHYLIP package. Bootstrap re-sampling with 1000 replicates using the Seqboot, DNAdist and Neighbour programmes provided confidence limits for the constructed
phylogenies, and the consensus tree was generated within
the Consense programme. The phylogenetic tree was generated and bootstrap values were visualised using
Treeview [30]. Bootstrap values are expressed as percentages.

Additional sequence analysis was performed with a
reduced dataset, using a 600 bp region of the glycoprotein
gene (nucleotide co-ordinates 3375 – 3974). Sequences
from the glycoprotein gene were derived as previously
described [19]. A 1000 base pair concatenated sequence
