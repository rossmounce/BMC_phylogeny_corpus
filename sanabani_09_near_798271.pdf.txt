Abstract
Background: The genetic diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical
to lay the groundwork for the design of successful drugs or vaccine. In this study we aimed to
characterize and define the molecular prevalence of HIV-1 subclade F1 currently circulating in São
Paulo, Brazil.
Methods: A total of 36 samples were selected from 888 adult patients residing in São Paulo who
had previously been diagnosed in two independent studies in our laboratory as being infected with
subclade F1 based on pol subgenomic fragment sequencing. Proviral DNA was amplified from the
purified genomic DNA of all 36 blood samples by 5 fragments overlapping PCR followed by direct
sequencing. Sequence data were obtained from the 5 fragments of pure subclade F1 and
phylogenetic trees were constructed and compared with previously published sequences.
Subclades F1 that exhibited mosaic structure with other subtypes were omitted from any further
analysis
Results: Our methods of fragment amplification and sequencing confirmed that only 5 sequences
inferred from pol region as subclade F1 also holds true for the genome as a whole and, thus,
estimated the true prevalence at 0.56%. The results also showed a single phylogenetic cluster of
the Brazilian subclade F1 along with non-Brazilian South American isolates in both subgenomic and
the full-length genomes analysis with an overall intrasubtype nucleotide divergence of 6.9%. The
nucleotide differences within the South American and Central African F1 strains, in the C2-C3 env,
were 8.5% and 12.3%, respectively.
Conclusion: All together, our findings showed a surprisingly low prevalence rate of subclade F1
in Brazil and suggest that these isolates originated in Central Africa and subsequently introduced
to South America.

Background
Genetic variability is a major feature of the HIV-1 and considered the key factor to frustrate efforts to halt the virus
epidemic. High mutation and replication rates, genomic
recombination, therapy and immune-mediated selective
pressures are some of the influential forces in the evolution of HIV [1-6]. Approaching this diversity is critical to
lay the groundwork for the design of successful drugs or
vaccine [7].
Based on the HIV-1 genetic variations and pattern
observed in phylogenetic reconstruction, researchers have
classified the virus into groups, subtypes and sub-subtypes
[8]. Currently, three groups (M, main; O, outlier; N, neither) have so far been recognized. HIV-1 group M viruses
are responsible for more than 99% of viral infection
worldwide [7] and are further classified into nine (A-D, FH, J and K) subtypes. Moreover, early sequencing studies
have provided evidence of interstrand crossover between
genomes of different HIV subtypes [5,6]. Such interclade
recombinant strains are consistently reported from
regions where two or more clades are predominant.
Recombinant strains from unlinked epidemiological
sources that exhibit identical patterns of mosaicism have
been classified separately as circulating recombinant
forms (CRFs) [9]. Up to this writing, there are more than
40 defined CRFs that are epidemiologically important as
subtypes http://www.hiv.lanl.gov. In addition to the
known CRFs, a large number of unique recombinant
viruses have been characterized worldwide [10]. HIV-1
subtypes, CRFs and URFs show considerably different patterns of distribution in different geographical regions.
On a global scale, the distribution of non-recombinant
subtype F1 strains is heterogeneous. For instance, earlier
molecular epidemiological studies have detected this subclade in 3–10% of the population in Central Africa
[11,12] which is considered the epicenter of the HIV pandemic. Authors of a previous study on a genetic survey of
HIV strains from serum samples collected in the mid1980s from the Democratic republic of Congo (DRC)
demonstrated a continuum and remarkably high diversity
within and between the F1 and F2 sub-subtypes [13]. In
Europe, the genuine subtype F1 strains are by far the most
frequent subtype in Romania, representing >70% of the
circulating strains among adults and children in this
country [14-17]. In addition, a recent study [18] found a
close phylogenetic relationship between Angolan and
Romanian HIV-1 subtype F1 isolates and thus lent further
support to available published data that indicated an African origin of subtype F epidemic in Romania [16,19]. A
significantly high proportion of HIV-1 F1 strains were isolated from 11 out of 18 patients infected with non-B
viruses of Luxembourg origin [20]. This result led the
authors to suggest a small-scale epidemic of F1 viruses

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/78

among Luxembourg population. In other European countries such as France, Russia and Belgium only sporadic
cases of F1 viruses have been documented [21-23]. Predominance of subclade F1 has also been reported in various countries in South America [24-28].
Brazil is the Latin American country that has been badly
affected by the HIV epidemic and has the second highest
number of HIV-1 cases in the Americas after the USA with
an estimated number of 730.000 cases living with HIV at
the beginning of 2008 (2008 Report on the Global AIDS
Epidemic). HIV-1 subtype B is a major genetic clade circulating in the country. However, existences of small proportion of other subtypes such as F1, C, B/C and B/F have
been consistently reported [28-30]. Data from recent studies of full genomic characterization of HIV have provided
evidence of Brazilian CRF strains designated as CRF28_BF,
CRF29_BF, CRF39_BF, CRF40_BF and CRF31_BC [3033]http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/
CRFs/CRFs.html.
Sub-subtype F1 is considered the main non-B subtype circulating in the country. However, our recent data indicated low proportion of HIV-1 F1 in Brazil than
previously thought and assumed the replacement of genuine sub-subtype F1 by emerging BF1 recombinants as a
result of unknown selective advantage [30]. Most of the
published sequences of HIV-1 F1 strains in Brazil were
based on small genetic stretches and only five near fulllength genomes (NFLG) have so far been characterized. In
this study, we aimed to provide new genetic materials of
this subclade by sequencing their NFLG and attempt to
define its prevalence in the state of São Paulo, the most
populous city located in the southeast region of Brazil.

Methods
Study population
A total of 36 samples were selected from adult patients
residing in São Paulo who had previously been diagnosed
in two independent unpublished studies in our laboratory
as being infected with HIV-1 F1 based on pol subgenomic
fragment sequencing. The first study investigated the longterm therapeutic interruption and genetic survey of HIV-1
variants in 137 patient samples collected in 2002 and
identified 8 HIV-1 F1 (5.8%) in their group. The second
study assessed the genotypic resistance and virus distributions in a cohort of 751 HIV-1 infected patients on antiretroviral therapy between 2006–2007 and found a total of
28 patients (3.7%) infected with sub-subtype F1. All of
the 36 samples initially characterized by both projects
were submitted for NFLG.
Amplification and sequencing of HIV-1 DNA
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the QIAamp blood kit

Virology Journal 2009, 6:78

(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted gnomic DNA concentration of the samples under investigation were determined
by comparing the samples band relative to the band of the
comparable intensity in the high DNA mass ladder (Invitrogen, Brazil) using 0.5–1.0% agarose gel. All extracted
genomic DNA were submitted for amplification of a
house keeping gene (β-globin) with primers PC03 and
PCO4 [34] to examine DNA integrity and exclude the
presence of PCR inhibitors. Proviral DNA was amplified
from the purified genomic DNA by PCR using primers
and methods described in previous studies [29,30].
Amplification reactions were done in duplicate to eliminate PCR artifacts, ensuring that sequenced NFLG were
not assembled from heterogeneous DNA targets. Both
DNA complementary strands were sequenced directly
from purified PCR products by using variety of internal
primers, fluorescent-dye terminators, and Taq polymerase
on an automated sequencer (ABI 3130, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA).
Subtype classification and sequence analysis
The data from each sequenced fragment were edited and
initially screened for the presence of recombination patterns by the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool (v2) [35] and the
jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM) [36]
and further confirmed by using the bootscanning method
[37] implemented in SimPlot 3.5.1 for Windows [38]
using the following parameters, window size 250 bp, step
size 20 bp and the Kimura 2-parameter as a model to estimate nucleotide substitution. The significant threshold
for the bootscan was set at 90%. This strategy has allowed
us to early identify samples with any recombinant fragments and to exclude them from further experiments and
analyses. Only edited subclade F1 fragments were assembled into contiguous sequences on a minimum overlap of
30 bp with a 99–100% minimal mismatch and a consensus sequence was formed by the Sequencher program
(Gene Code Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). NFLG consensus
sequences were again analyzed for recombination by
using the jpHMM web tool. Only jpHMM confirmed pure
sub- subtype F1 isolates were aligned with reference
sequences representing subtypes A-D, F-H, J and K
obtained from the Los Alamos database http://hivweb.lanl.gov using the CLUSTAL X program [39]. Aligned
sequences were further refined by manual editing and
trimmed to the minimal shared length in the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor Program [40]. Gaps and
ambiguous positions were removed from alignment. The
phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood (ML) methods implemented in the program
PHYML [41] using the GTR + I + G substitution model and
a BIONJ starting tree. Heuristic tree searches under the ML
optimality criterion were performed using the NNI
branch-swapping algorithm. The approximate likelihood-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/78

ratio test (aLRT) based on a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like
procedure was used as a statistical test to calculate branch
support. Only aLRT statistical values of >70% were considered significant and displayed at the tree nodes. Trees
were plotted using the program MEGA version 4 http://
www.megasoftware.net. The mean genetic nucleotide distances within and between sequences were calculated
using the maximum composite likelihood model implemented in MEGA version 4.0 software. Comparison of
tree topology from subclade F1 subgenomic regions was
performed by the recently described algorithm [42]. Prediction of HIV-1 coreceptor usage from the env V3 region
was determined using the web-based service geno2pheno
[coreceptor] http://www.geno2pheno.org which considers all V3 mutational patterns, and not only changes of
arginine or lysine at positions 11 or 25.
GenBank accession numbers
GenBank accession numbers for the proviral NFLG
sequences reported in this study are [02BR082: FJ771006,
02BR170: FJ771007, 06BR564: FJ771008, 06BR579:
FJ771009, 07BR844: FJ771010].

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol sequences
Of the 888 subjects in total, 36 were initially assigned as
infected with non-recombinant HIV-1 subclade F1 variants using approximately 1200 bp region in the pol gene
as depicted in figure 1. Thus, based on the analysis of this
small portion of viral genome, subclade F1 is still present
in São Paulo and roughly accounts for 4.05% of circulating strains.
Analysis of full-length subtype F1 sequences
To find the true prevalence of this strain, all the 36 samples were subjected to complete genome amplification
and only genuine HIV-1 F1 strains were corroborated by
further phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding
sequences and part of LTR region. Of the 36 patients
investigated, chimeric viruses comprised of B/F1 and F1/
C based on fragment analysis were detected in 31 patients
and were omitted from further analysis. Only 5 sequences
inferred from pol region as subclade F1 also holds true for
the genome as a whole and, thus, estimated the true prevalence of HIV FI at 0.56%. Inspection of coding regions of
the five HIV-1 F1 sequences obtained in this study displayed open and intact reading frames for majority of HIV
proteins. To exclude laboratory strains contamination, a
BLAST search of GenBank HIV-1 sequences did not reveal
any evidence for contamination with strains obtained
from our patients. Figure 2 shows the ML tree of 53 complete genome coding sequences, including the five isolates
sequenced in this study and 48 reference strains (GenBank
and Los Alamos database) representing subtypes A-D, FH, J and K. The five isolates, namely 02BR082, 02BR170,

06BR564, 06BR579 and 07BR844, fell into subclade F1
reference group (100% aLRT), with an overall average distance of 6.9%. Close inspection of figure 2 shows that
strains clustered in subclade F1 are divided further into
two major groups, in which the Brazilian F1 sequences,
FI.93.FIN9363 and BE.93.VI850 fell into the first group
and F1.FR.96.MP411, F1.ES.x.P1146, F1.ES.x.X1093 2,
F1.ES.x.X1670 and F1.x.x.MVP 30846 fell into the other.
Within the first group that includes the Brazilian F1
sequences, FI.93.FIN9363, BE.93.VI850 and the Argentinean F1.AR.2002.ARE933 isolate, where the node
within this cluster had 99% of aLRT statistical support,
there is an indication of two major clusters of the Brazilian
sequences separated by 90% of aLRT values. To test the
stability and branching orders of our sequences, ML trees
were independently made from all the full length HIV-1
F1 gag-pol (n = 21) and env sequences (n = 27) available in
the database (Figure 3a &3b). The phylogenetic trees from
both regions received an overall topological score of
69.3%. Consistent with the results obtained by NFLG, all
the Brazilian isolates along with other South American
(SAm) sequences formed a distinct cluster supported by
aLRT value of greater than 80% in both regions as
depicted in figure 3. Furthermore, close looking at the
SAm sequences in figure 3a and 3b revealed two main
clusters separated from each other by 84% and 99% of
aLRT values in the gag-pol and env regions, respectively,
and indicated possible intrasubtype recombination. For
example, isolate 06BR579 placed the gag-pol region within
the 07BR844 and F1.AR.2002.ARE933 cluster in 72% of
aLRT values, but the env region grouped within other cluster
that
included
F1.BR.1989.BZ163
and
F1.BR.1989.BZ126 (aLRT 94%). The computed topological score of this cluster in both regions was 50% with
branch length mismatch of 59.7%. Therefore, the shifting
of topological positions into 2 different phylogenetic trees
is suggestive evidence of intrasubtype recombination
event or other factors such as convergence.
To establish the relationship of our sequences to each
other and to the previously published HIV-1 F1 sequences
from a variety of geographic regions, another phylogenetic tree was constructed using the C2-C3 env. This region
was selected because it contains a larger number of HIV-1
F1 sequences in the database. As shown in figure 4, except
for isolate 02BR034 (Accession DQ358812), the
sequences from SAm including the new isolates in this
study emerge from a common node along with two
strains, one isolated in Spain from an Argentinean immigrant (BF1.ES.2002.X1241) and the other from Portuguese women (F1.PT.-.envNTM44 89) with unknown
epidemiological link to any SAm country. The Brazilian
F1 isolates did not form a rigid cluster but were dispersed
among the SAm non-Brazilian sequences and were distinct from the Romanian and African isolates. In contrast,

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/78

the Brazilian strain 02BR034, which branches well out of
the SAm cluster, is positioned in the phylogenetic tree
close to other isolates from the DRC. Moreover, the
branching patterns indicate that the common ancestor of
the SAm cluster was also shared with isolates belonging to
DRC.
The mean genetic nucleotide distances of the SAm HIV-1
F1 sequences derived from the C2-C3 region were computed and compared with reference strains from Romania
and Central Africa (Angola and DRC). The results showed
that the SAm isolates differed from the Romanian and
Central African F1 strains by nucleotide distances of
12.8% and 12.3%, respectively. The mean nucleotide variation of 8.5%, 11.2% and 12.3% was observed among F1
strains from SAm, Romania and Central Africa, respectively.
Amino acids and LTR nucleotides alignment features
Detailed inspection of the amino acid alignment of the
obtained isolates and the Brazilian subtype F1 reference
genomes showed that strains 07BR844 and 01BR087
(Accession DQ358801) had 18 bp insertional mutation
in the N-terminus of the p6Gag protein that created a duplication of PTAPP motifs. The same sequences showed concomitant insertion of 6–7 amino acids within the p6Pol
epitope (NSPTRREL) with particularly conserved repeat of
SPT amino acids. Analysis of the phenotypic characteristics of the 3rd (V3) region in the env gene of the new Brazilian subtype F1 isolates described in this study suggests
that all, except the isolate 07BR844, were derived from
macrophage tropic R5 viruses. The GPG motif at the tip of
the V3 loop and the potential N-linked glycosylation sites
were highly conserved.

A detailed scrutinization of the partial nucleotide alignment of the 3' LTR regions relative to HXB2 and consensus
sequences of other HIV subtypes is shown in figure 5.
Conform to the consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC, two
potential NF-κB binding sites were localized in our five
new strains. A subclade F1 specific insert of 13–15 nucleotides was observed just downstream of the NF-κBIII binding site. The existence of this insertional nucleotides
signature has also been reported in a previous study [43]

Discussion
Currently there are only 13 NFLG sequences of pure subclade F1 isolates in GenBank. Among these were five
recovered from Brazil. The scarcity of these sequences
prompted us to characterize and provide newer genetic
materials of this subclade, which is become rarely found
in the Brazilian epidemic. Using our strategy detailed in
the material and methods, we attempted to roughly define
the molecular prevalence of the non-recombinant subclade F1 in São Paulo, Brazil. Our results confirmed our

previous findings [30] and showed a surprisingly low
prevalence rate of 0.56% suggesting that, in previous studies, occurrence has been overestimated due to partial
genome sequence data [28,44]. Results from a recent
study conducted by [45] have suggested that subclade F1
was readily and completely assimilated into the previous
(caused by subtype B) HIV-1 epidemics in Brazil. In contrast to this study, our results provided compelling evidence of circulation of subclade F1 in Brazil and,
consistent with our previous findings, suggest that recombination of HIV-1 F1 with other circulating clades, particularly subtype B, is on the rise and may, possibly,
gradually replace sub-subtype F1 in the future.
The epidemic history of subclade F1 in Brazil with methods based on coalescent theory, using partial and complete sequences of contemporary viruses, indicated that
the epidemic growth of this subclades started in the late
1970s and experienced a rapid expansion over the first 10
years, then slows considerably around 1980s [46,47]. It
has been suggested that transmission network such as
homo/bisexuals and injecting drug users could have con-

tributed to its spread in the 1980–1993 [46,47]. The
extremely low prevalence of subclade F1 reported here
lends further support to the slow-down of the growth rate
estimated in the later study. The subsequent decline of
growth rate of this subclade was associated with increased
isolation of BF1 recombinant variants in the Brazilian epidemics. We believed that the main evolutionary driving
force behind the decline and probably replacement of
subclade F1 and emergence of BF recombinants isolate
might be due to stochastic events facilitated by the lower
population size of the genuine subclade F1 rather than an
increased viral fitness or selective pressure.
Several studies showed that subclade F1 from SAm viruses
form a monophyletic cluster either by partial or NFLG
when compared to other viruses of the same subtype from
other countries [30,47]. Our current results were in line
with these findings and showed strong cluster of all the
SAm in a NFLG tree and this cluster remained unaffected
in the gag-pol and env subgenomic trees. Moreover, pairwise comparison of the SAm cluster in both subgenomic
trees provided suggestive evidence of intraclade recombi-

nation; however, these findings may need to be explored
better with more sequences and robust phylogenetic parametric bootstrapping method.
The placement of the Brazilian strain 02BR034 outside the
SAm cluster as shown in figure 4 is striking. This isolate is
a B/F1 mosaic virus that is closely related to 01BR323 all
across the genome and it has a near identical mosaic structure to 01BR323, except for a short stretch between positions 7000 and 8000 where 02BR034 clusters with
subtype B rather than with subclade F1 as previously
reported [30]. However, when more subclade F1 C2–C3
sequences was then included as shown in figure 4,
02BR034 did not come out as most similar to 01BR323 in
this region. One explanation for the aberrant clustering of
02BR034 is either an accidental similarity to subclade F1
from DRC or an additional intrasubtype recombination
event involving small region in the C2-C3. The overall
result presented in figure 4 suggests that the HIV-1 F1
viruses had probably been brought to SAm from Central
Africa by a single or a very small group of individuals
infected with genetically related viruses then spread from
person to person till it took firm hold in the current epidemic. Our findings in this respect are similar to those of
Aulicino et al., (2007) in that the founder virus of this
subclade has been introduced to SAm from Central African countries.
The duplication of the PTAPP motifs in the p6Gag together
with amino acids insertion within the p6Pol epitope were
observed in isolates 07BR844 and 01BR087 (previously
characterized by our group). The PTAPP is a known binding site of the cellular protein Tsg101 which is involved in
intracellular trafficking of plasma membrane-associated
proteins [48,49]. It has been shown that duplication of
the PTAPP late protein can considerably affect the Tsg101
binding and consequently, alter the rate of HIV release
from the membrane [49]. Moreover, a recent study conducted by Cao and co-workers [50] have shown that the
duplication of the PTAPP motifs and the mutagenesis of
the pol NL8 epitope represent novel mechanism whereby
HIV-1 can alter its sequence with potential functional consequences for viral replication and budding.

Conclusion
Finally our study provided concrete evidence of the existence of pure subclade F1 in Brazil and suggests that monitoring of the diversity of the HIV-1 subtypes is extremely
relevant to guide diagnosis, treatment and vaccine development. Moreover, we believe that the reported data will
be useful as a reference for future studies on the genetic
diversity of HIV-1.
