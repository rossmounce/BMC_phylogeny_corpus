Abstract
Background: Child-care facilities appear to provide daily opportunities for exposure and transmission of
bacteria and viruses. However, almost nothing is known about the diversity of microbial contamination in daycare
facilities or its public health implications. Recent culture-independent molecular studies of bacterial diversity in
indoor environments have revealed an astonishing diversity of microorganisms, including opportunistic pathogens
and many uncultured bacteria. In this study, we used culture and culture-independent methods to determine the
viability and diversity of bacteria in a child-care center over a six-month period.
Results: We sampled surface contamination on toys and furniture using sterile cotton swabs in four daycare
classrooms. Bacteria were isolated on nutrient and blood agar plates, and 16S rRNA gene sequences were
obtained from unique (one of a kind) colony morphologies for species identification. We also extracted DNA
directly from nine representative swab samples taken over the course of the study from both toy and furniture
surfaces, and used "universal" 16S rRNA gene bacterial primers to create PCR-based clone libraries. The rRNA
gene clones were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with related sequences in GenBank and
subjected to phylogenetic analyses to determine their evolutionary relationships. Culturing methods identified
viable bacteria on all toys and furniture surfaces sampled in the study. Bacillus spp. were the most commonly
cultured bacteria, followed by Staphylococcus spp., and Microbacterium spp. Culture-independent methods based
on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, on the other hand, revealed an entirely new dimension of microbial diversity,
including an estimated 190 bacterial species from 15 bacterial divisions. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic
analyses determined that the clone libraries were dominated by a diverse set of sequences related to Pseudomonas
spp., as well as uncultured bacteria originally identified on human vaginal epithelium. Other sequences were
related to uncultured bacteria from wastewater sludge, and many human-associated bacteria including a number
of pathogens and opportunistic pathogens. Our results suggest that the child-care facility provided an excellent
habitat for slime-producing Pseudomonads, and that diaper changing contributed significantly to the bacterial
contamination.
Conclusion: The combination of culture and culture-independent methods provided powerful means for
determining both viability and diversity of bacteria in child-care facilities. Our results provided insight into the
source of contamination and suggested ways in which sanitation might be improved. Although our study identified
a remarkable array of microbial diversity present in a single daycare, it also revealed just how little we
comprehend the true extent of microbial diversity in daycare centers or other indoor environments.

Background
Child-care facilities appear to provide a setting with many
opportunities for exposure and transmission of bacteria
and viruses [1-4]. Preschool aged children are often sick
with illnesses of unknown origins, and young children
have not yet mastered the sanitary cleaning habits present
among most adults in our society. Moreover, children
have had less exposure to microorganisms, making them
more likely to catch and transmit pathogens or opportunistic pathogens, and perhaps more likely to suffer ill
effects from contact in densely populated facilities. Recent
studies of microbial diversity in indoor environments
using molecular methods have revealed considerable bacterial contamination and underscored how little we know
about such contamination [5-7]. Understanding the
potential public health risks in daycare centers requires a
better understanding of microbial diversity in these settings. This is particularly important given the increasing
reliance of working parents on daycare facilities for childcare [4].
Culture-based studies of human indoor environments
have shown that significant levels of bacteria are present
in seemingly innocuous areas such as office buildings, residential homes, and children's schools and daycare centers [8-10]. According to these surveys, low DNA G+C
content, Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus,
Bacillus licheniformis, Brevibacillus brevis and Staphyloccus
spp. along with a few Gram negative species including
Chryseomonas spp. and Pantoea spp. tend to predominate
[8,11,12]. Indoor culturing studies have also identified
the presence of bacteria from the order Actinomycetes,
including Rhodococcus fasclans, Arthrobacter pascens, and
Corynebacterium spp. [8,11].
Recently, culture-independent molecular studies have
greatly expanded our understanding of the bacterial diversity that can be present in indoor environments. The
molecular methods we performed in this study included
PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes conducted on DNA
extracted directly from our environmental samples. Culture-independent methods have been able to offer a much
more complete view of the bacteria present in ordinary
everyday surroundings such as indoor pools, shower curtains, and airplane bathrooms; these same methods
should prove equally effective for use in daycare settings
[5-7]. In some cases, culture-independent methods have
identified the source of illness when the microbes were
unknown or not currently culturable [5,13].
In an environment so potentially rich in microbial diversity, culturing methods readily identify bacteria with
known growth requirements and these methods are necessary to prove the viability of microorganisms in the
environment. However, previous work has shown that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/27

<1% of bacterial species in a given environment are culturable suggesting that a vast majority of the true diversity
may be missed if studies rely solely on culturing [14,15].
Indeed, the development of culture-independent methods based on the 16S rRNA gene used in conjunction with
phylogenetic analysis has revealed an abundant array of
previously unknown and uncultured microbes, including
entirely new bacterial divisions [13-18]. The 16S rRNA
gene is particularly useful for molecular analysis and identification of organisms due to its high level of information
content, conserved nature, and it's presence in all cellular
microorganisms [15]. Researchers have also begun to use
culture-independent methods to study human biology
[19-22], complex diseases [13,23], and human environments [5-7]. Collectively these studies have exposed a
remarkable array of microorganisms, many of them with
no cultured representatives. In the case of human environments, many potentially opportunistic pathogens have
been identified [5-7].
In this study, we surveyed the bacterial diversity present in
a daycare facility using both culture and culture-independent methods to analyze samples taken from various
toys and surfaces (e.g., counter-tops). This allowed us to
gauge the overall complexity of bacterial diversity, determine viability of bacteria, and see how the diversity and
abundance changed over time. A total of four rooms were
sampled over a six-month period. Sampling was alternated between two toddler rooms and two infant rooms
every one to two weeks. Of these samples, DNA was successfully extracted directly from nine swabs, and the samples were subjected to both culture and cultureindependent analysis. The facility tested in this case had
specific disinfection protocols in place for daily cleaning
of the rooms and washing of the toys that the children
have played with or come into contact with during the
course of the day. Cleaning protocols (e.g., cleaning surfaces with 10% bleach) were followed diligently by the
staff in this daycare facility, which placed a high premium
on cleanliness.

Results
Table 1 details the total number of cultured isolates
obtained over the course of the study based on the16S
rRNA gene sequence analysis and visible colony morphology. The lysozyme extraction protocol effectively isolated
bacterial DNA from all the colonies picked from plates.
Typical DNA yields for bacterial colonies were in the range
of 0.6 to 82.4 ng μl-1. Table 2 shows the results of culturing on the environmental swab samples taken between
September 2005 – April 2006. For all days sampled except
October 6, 2005, colonies grew on either blood or nutrient agar plates. This means that there were large numbers
of viable bacteria consistently present on the surfaces and
toys sampled at the daycare center. We isolated as many as

29 putative bacterial species. We considered it a potentially different species of bacteria if it had a unique 16S
rRNA gene sequence or a clearly distinct morphology or
both (Table 2). Bacillus species were the most commonly
culture-isolated bacteria, followed by Staphylococcus spp.
Culture methods identified at least 29 viable bacterial species on toy and furniture surfaces over the 6 months of the
study (Table 1). Species of Bacillus were isolated every day
of sampling (Table 2), and we identified as many as 15
different distinct morphologies over the course of the
study (Table 1).
The lysozyme DNA extraction protocol proved effective
for direct swab extractions and yielded DNA in the range
of 5.1 to 14.7 ng μl-1. Bead-beating methods are typically
preferred for isolating environmental DNA because the
mechanical shearing of cells by the beads helps extract
DNA from particularly "tough" bacterial cells such as bacterial vegetative cells (e.g., Pseudomonas putida), bacterial
endospores (e.g., Bacillus spp.), and fungal conidia (e.g.,
Fusarium moniliforme) [24]. However, our attempts with
bead-beating methods failed to isolate sufficient DNA
from the swabs (data not shown), whereas the lysozyme
method yielded sufficient amounts of DNA for PCR.
Figure 1 and 2 show the results of phylogenetic analysis of
selected sequences from the 453 clones obtained from the
nine libraries relative to sequences from cultured and
uncultured bacteria from other studies. Based on our survey of nine 16S rRNA gene PCR-clone libraries we identified as many as 190 bacterial species (1% divergence; 141
at the more conservative 3% divergence level), most of
them with no cultured representatives. The clone library
sequence coverage ranged from 48% to 65% (average
54%) for the nine clone libraries. Most sequences found
in both groups appeared to be uncultured bacterial species. Members of the Pseudomonadaceae and the Oxalobacteraceae predominated in the clone libraries (Fig. 3).
Pseudomonads were particularly abundant and were on
every surface sampled on every sampling occasion (Fig.
3).
Since the main purpose of this study was to identify the
types of organisms in the daycare center, one-directional
sequencing of the first part of the small-subunit rRNA
gene, which includes the most variable part of the gene,
was enough for our purposes. Sequencing bi-directionally
would have been ideal in terms of reducing error, but
would have doubled the sequencing costs and added little
to our understanding of the diversity. Also, we trimmed
the sequences to around ~500 bp in length, and edited out
the most problematic part of the reads. Any errors that
remained would have had little impact on the phylogenetic analysis. However, we have made glycerol stocks of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/27

all the clone libraries we created, which are available from
the authors upon request.
The alignment of the edited and trimmed sequences
proved straightforward, and the alignment was checked
by confirming complementary base-pairing in known
stem regions of the alignment. A total of 78 sequences
were deposited in GenBank, including sequences from
both culture isolates (Table 1) and representative clone
library sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1,
2). Approximately 500 nucleotide positions, corresponding to E. coli positions 25 to 534, were used for all the phylogenetic analyses. There was strong support for the
majority of the phylogenetic relationships as judged by
both Bayesian posterior probabilities (Fig. 1, 2) and MP
bootstrap support (not shown). Bayesian, MP and ML
methods produced highly similar tree topologies. The differences in tree topologies produced by the various methods were in regions of the trees not supported by either
posterior probabilities (< 0.5) or MP bootstrap values
(<50%). The phylogenetic analysis allowed us to easily
identify the position of our cloned environmental
sequences within known bacterial divisions (Fig. 1, 2).
Using this information, and the Fastgroup II dereplication
information, we were able to assess the relative abundance of various sequences in clone libraries and these are
presented in Figure 3.

Discussion
Our combination of culturing and culture-independent
techniques revealed a remarkable diversity of bacteria
contaminating every surface sampled in the daycare facility. Bacillus spp. were particularly common (Table 1 and
2). Bacillus endospores disperse rapidly through the air
and are ubiquitous in soils and other environments
[25,26] so their abundant presence here was not alarming.
Staphylocccus species were also repeatedly isolated, as were
species of Pseudomonas and Microbacterium (Table 1 and
2). A number of the isolates were potential pathogens and
opportunistic pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis
[27], Moraxella osloensis [28], and Staphylococcus haemolyticus [29]. E. faecalis has become a particular problem in
hospitals [27]. Species belonging to these genera of bacteria are commonly found on skin, nostrils, or even as part
of the normal gut microbiota [30]. Normal shedding of
these surfaces, along with the attached bacteria, may
explain their abundance in indoor human environments
[9,30].
Our culturing results appeared highly similar to culturebased studies of other indoor environments [8,9]. Specifically we found ~90% of the same bacterial genera as
another culture-based study of a daycare setting [8]. Most
of these studies sampled airborne bacteria in environments, such as daycare centers, schools, and office build-

ings [8,9,11,12]. Our results suggest diversity found in airsampling studies is very similar to that of surface sampling
methods and may be a reasonable substitute for costly airsampling methods at least in terms of determining microbial diversity.
Although the culture-based methods discovered a number
of bacterial species and confirmed the viability of bacteria
on surfaces in the daycare facility, these methods identified only a small fraction of the true bacterial diversity
(~3%). The culture-independent portion of our analysis
revealed a whole new dimension of largely unexplored
microbial diversity present in a daycare center environment. Similar to other culture-independent studies in
human environments [5-7], we uncovered an extraordinary diversity of bacteria from 16 bacterial divisions or
sub-divisions that included many bacterial species without cultured representatives (Fig. 1, 2, 3).
The largest proportion of sequences found in the clone
libraries came from two groups: the Pseudomonadaceae

and the Oxalobacteraceae (Fig. 3). Pseudomonads comprise an extremely diverse array of bacteria that grow on
numerous carbon sources and are often associated with
spoilage [31]. Many of them produce biofilm "slime layers" that serve as environmental protection and make
them resistant to both antibiotics [32] and cleaning regimens [33]. Moreover, this same slime production ability
appears to protect them from the mammalian immune
system [32]. A number of Pseudomonads, such as P.stutzeri, are known opportunistic pathogens [34] and have
also been implicated in hospital acquired infections
[35,36]. P. aeruginosa is also known to be resistant to antibiotics [37].
The predominance of a diverse array of Pseudomonads in
the daycare appears to be quite consistent with the nature
of the environment. The constant spillage of food and liquids, spread over every surface reachable by children,
would make a perfect growth medium for Pseudomonads
[31]. This particular daycare center had very rigorous
cleaning policies. However, the natural resistance of Pseu-

domonads to cleaning may actually have served to
increase their abundance relative to other bacteria. Given
the abundance of Pseudomonads in our clone libraries, it
is somewhat surprising that we did not find more species
growing on nutrient agar plates (Table 2). Another published culture-based study of a daycare facility showed a
lack of diversity on nutrient agar plates [8]. However,
growth on media other than blood or nutrient agar was
not tried. It is possible that had a media specifically
designed to culture Pseudomonads been selected, our
results may have been different. In addition, our inability

to grow these bacteria on agar plates may be a result of the
fact that so many of the Pseudomonas spp.-related
sequences came from uncultured bacteria (1–3% divergence from cultured species; Fig. 2).
The other most consistently abundant group, based on
clone library sequence analysis, included a large collection of uncultured species in the Oxalobacteraceae family.
According to the research literature, the Oxalobacteraceae
include numerous bacterial species with diverse habitats.
For example, many Collimonas and Herbaspirillum spp. are

is found in the human gastrointestinal tract [39]. Unfortunately, our uncultured species appeared to belong to a
novel group of Oxalobacteraceae leaving us with little
information concerning their source or habitats, apart

from a rather basic understanding of their phylogenetic
relationships. However, a recent culture-independent
study of human-associated microbial communities [40]
allowed us to identify the human vaginal epithelium as a
likely source of a large number of these sequences (Fig. 1,

Results of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 16s rRNA gene sequences from other phylogenetic groups of bacteria found in PCR-amplified clone libraries from swabs samples of toys and surfaces. Cloned sequences are indicated by "CCTR" (Children's Center Toddler Room) or "CCIR" (Children's Center Infant Room) prefixes followed by the date
of sampling and whether the sequence was obtained from a toy (T) or a surface (S). GenBank accession numbers are presented
next to the names. The tree also includes sequences from some of the cultured isolates in Table 1. The values above the
branches indicate the Bayesian posterior probabilities (above 0.5) under the specified model of evolution for each node. Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses produced highly similar tree topologies. MP bootstrap values were similarly
high at nodes well-supported by Bayesian analysis.

Graphical representation of common bacterial-type abundance found in the six clone libraries made from furniture surface swabs based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identification. Pseudomonads and uncultured Oxalobacteraceae were consistently found on all surfaces at high levels. Bacillus species were also common, though at lower abundance.
One date in particular, Jan 25th,(Toddler Room 2) had a particularly high concentration of Streptococcus-related sequences.

3). An intensive sequencing effort by Hyman et al. (2005)
revealed a tremendous diversity of uncultured bacteria
associated with the vaginal epithelium, and many of the
16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from surface samples,
especially within the Oxalobacteraceae, were closely related
to these published sequences (Fig. 2). Sequences in our
clone libraries from nine other bacterial divisions were
also nearly identical to bacterial sequences isolated from
the vaginal epithelium (Fig. 2). We also note that we
found many sequences of apparently uncultured bacteria
related to uncultured bacteria identified from molecular
studies of wastewater sludge (Fig. 2; [41,42]).
The predominance of sequences in our libraries related to
bacteria found in the vaginal epithelium and in wastewater sludge suggests that a significant proportion of the bacterial contamination in daycares results from frequent
diaper changes. This conclusion is supported by the discovery of cultured bacteria known to reside in the human
intestine (e.g., E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis; Fig. 2). Since we
know so little about the uncultured bacteria, we cannot
say whether they pose a particular health threat. However,
the significant diversity of so many human-associated
bacteria contaminating various toys and surfaces suggests
that enteropathogenic bacteria could be easily spread in
daycare settings. Given the fact that we did not achieve full
sampling coverage of the sequence diversity for any of the
samples (average clone library sequence coverage ~54%),
we expect that many more bacterial species may be found
in daycare settings. These results not only demonstrate
how little is known about microbial diversity of indoor
environments, but also emphasizes the need for a much
more complete understanding of microbes associated
with humans, which appeared to be the source of most of
the contamination.
In addition to the sequences from uncultured bacteria, we
also identified a number of sequences in the culture-independent molecular analysis with close relatives known to
be pathogens or opportunistic pathogens that were not
found through culturing. These include sequences related
to Streptococcus mutans, S. mitis, Chryseobacterium indologenes [43], Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [44,45], Flavobacterium indologenes [46] and Rothia dentocariosa [47] (Fig. 1,
2). The January 25 sampling date in particular had a particularly high abundance of Streptococcus-related species
(Fig. 3). This sampling was right in the middle of the cold
and flu season and was around the time a large number of
the kids were kept home due to illness (Daycare staff, pers.
comm.). The fact that we found so few of these species
through standard culturing approaches supports that
notion that culture-independent molecular analyses provide a powerful additional means for studying indoor
environments and possibly identifying infectious agents.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/27

The results of this study should also be examined from a
public health viewpoint, in order to assess which organisms have the greatest potential to cause illness in children. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus
epidermidis were identified in several samples, these represent known pathogens that can cause pneumonia and
meningitis in children [48,49]. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also found, this bacteria has been known to
cause infections and bacteremia in pediatric patients who
have contracted it as a nonsocomial infection during a
hospital stay [50,51]. The presence of Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia was also somewhat distressing due to the
recent emergence of an antibiotic resistant strain [52].
Other pathogenic strains potentially harmful to children
that were found included Rothia dentocariosa, known to
cause the childhood illness tonsillitis [53], Enterococcus
faecalis, a bacteria associated with urinary tract infections
[54,55], and Shigella flexnerii, which causes the common
childhood ailment of acute diarrhea [56,57].
Although culture-independent methods have proven
highly useful for uncovering a vast array of new microbes
in many environments, including the daycare center, a
number of authors have pointed out that methods based
on amplifying 16S rRNA gene sequences using "universal"
primers may not accurately reflect the true underlying
diversity of a given environment [58,59]. Problems such
as PCR-bias, ribosomal DNA copy number and the efficiency of DNA extraction procedures all have the potential
to significantly skew abundance estimates and there may
not be a direct relationship between the number of
sequences of a particular type in a clone library and the
number
of
organisms
in
the
environment.
Nevertheless, as demonstrated in this paper, the cultureindependent methods do allow for a much more comprehensive assessment of microbial diversity than culturing
alone and provide an approximation of the relative diversity in the samples. Given the proper set of growing conditions, many of the uncultured bacteria could be isolated
using culture-based methods. For example, by culturing
for a longer period of time (five or more days), by culturing at a broader range of temperatures (e.g., 30°C), or by
using alternative media (e.g., low-nutrient medium R2A)
we might have isolated more types of bacteria. Longer
incubation times would have been particularly helpful for
growing organisms that tend to live in biofilms. Indeed,
the culture-independent methods provide an excellent
complement to the culturing approaches. Before the
study, we did not expect to find such a diverse array of
Pseudomonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae, but with the
knowledge gained from the culture-independent methods
we can now adjust our culturing methods to grow these
organisms.

Conclusion
The diversity of bacteria in the daycare environment
appears to be a rich combination of bacterial species associated with both humans and the outside environment
(e.g., Bacillus in soils). Given the extremely high bacterial
diversity, and the relatively low sequence coverage we
achieved in this preliminary study (~54%), the overall
diversity is almost certainly higher than we report. Our
results suggest that the microbial diversity associated with
human environments remains extremely poorly characterized. In terms of public health, we believe greater attention needs to be paid to the microbial contamination of
environments (e.g., daycare centers, nursing homes and
hospitals) that take care of the most vulnerable members
of society. In terms of the child-care facilities per se, our
results suggest that diaper changing stations should be
moved further away from the play areas, and that more
efforts should be focused on removing tough biofilms.
Faster and more comprehensive culture-independent
methods, such as environmental microarrays and metagenomic approaches, could help better understand the public health risks in these environments.

Methods
Sample Collection
Samples were collected from 4 different classrooms where
children ages 0–4 years were taught daily. Environmental
samples were taken with dual tip sterile cotton swabs (BBL
CultureSwab™, catalog # 220135, Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD) and these were stored in sterile-labeled tubes
for immediate transport back to the lab. Toys and surfaces
were sampled on a fixed surface area of approximately 13
cm2. During the course of the study the same furniture
surfaces were sampled repeatedly, while the toys varied
between samplings.
Bacterial Culturing Methods
Immediately upon return to the lab, one tip of the dualtip swab samples was placed into 7 mL of nutrient broth
(Difco™, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) and allowed to
incubate overnight at 37°C. The second tip of each dualtip swabs was labeled and placed at -80°C for later analysis. Overnight cultures of nutrient broth (Difco™) were
used to streak 5% blood (Blood Agar Contact Plate, Hardy
Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) and nutrient agar plates
(Difco™, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), which were also
incubated overnight at 37°C. To minimize outside contamination, all culturing was performed in a biological
hood using sterile instruments. The following day, plate
growth and colony morphology were evaluated and
recorded.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/27

DNA Extraction and PCR Amplification of Colonies and
Swabs
DNA was extracted using a lysozyme-extraction protocol
[60] directly from the bacterial colonies picked off plates
using a sterile toothpick. One colony was selected from
each observed morphology type. We used the same protocol to isolate DNA directly from the swabs (the environmental samples) for culture-independent analysis.

For the environmental extractions, cotton from the swab
samples was removed using a sterile razor blade and
placed into the lysozyme reaction mixture. The reaction
mixture had a total volume of 200 μl and included the following final concentration: 20 M Tris, 2 mM EDTA (pH
8.0), 1.2% P40 detergent, 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme, and 0.2
μm filtered sterile water (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO). We used the same reaction buffer and extraction
method for isolating DNA from the cultured organisms
(Table 1). For the cultured bacteria, we used a sterile
toothpick to pick a single colony from the agar plates,
which was then swirled into the reaction mixture. Samples
were incubated in a 37°C water bath for thirty minutes.
Next, Proteinase K (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen Corporation, Valencia, CA) and AL Buffer (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen Corporation, Valencia, CA) were added to the tubes
and gently mixed. Samples were incubated in a 70°C
water bath for 10 min. All samples were subjected to purification using the DNeasy Tissue Kit.
Following extraction, the DNA was quantified using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophomtometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Willmington, DE). We created PCR-based
clone libraries from nine of the swabs collected over the
course of the study. With one exception, swabs we chose
came from the same surface type (the toy shelf). Six of the
swabs were selected to represent each month from October 2005 through April 2006, while the other three were
selected as duplicates for three of the sampling days to
determine the consistency of contamination across surfaces. This strategy allowed us to find the most consistently abundant types of bacteria and to detect any
significant changes in diversity that might occur during
the "cold and flu" season.
The PCR reactions utilized published bacterium specific
primers primers 8F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3')
and 805R (5'-GACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') to
amplify the 16S rRNA gene. The ~800 bp PCR products
from amplification using these primers includes a portion
of the 16S rRNA gene that has been shown to be particularly useful for database analysis and identification of bacterial sequences [13]. PCR was carried out in a total
reaction volume of 50 μl including 1 μl (approx. 10 ng μl1) of sample DNA as template, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at 200 μM, 1.5 mM MgCl2 in 10× buffer (10×

concentration: 500 mM 1 M KCl, 100 mM 1 M Tris HCl
pH 8.4, 1% Triton-X, 15 mM MgCl2), each primer at 0.4
μM, 4 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg ml-1), and 0.5
μl of REDTAQ™ DNA polymerase (1 unit μl-1; SigmaAldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO). Between twenty-five and
thirty cycles of PCR amplification were performed for the
environmental swab samples and the bacterial colony
samples. We used the lowest numbers of cycles that
yielded a visible band on an agarose gel in order to minimize over-amplification of rare sequences and production
of chimeric sequences. All PCR cycles included an initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 1 min, an annealing step at
55°C for 45 sec and an extension step at 72°C for 1.5 min.
The amplification cycles were preceded by a one-time
denaturing step at 94°C for 5 min prior to the first cycle
and included a final 72°C extension for 10 min to ensure
complete extension for efficient cloning. Products were
cleaned using Qiagen's QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.
Cloning and Sequencing
The cleaned PCR products were cloned using the TOPO
TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformed One Shot chemically competent E.coli cells were
plated on LB-agar plates containing 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin
and top plated with X-gal and IPTG. Next, colonies with
inserts were randomly selected with a sterile toothpick
and grown overnight at 37°C in 150 μl of LB broth (Fisher
Biotech, Fair Lawn, NJ) containing 6% glycerol, and 1 μM
ampicillin in a 96-well plate. Subsequent to cloning, a
PCR amplification was performed on each of the 96 wells.
The universal bacterial primers M13F (5'TTATGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) and M13R (5'GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG) were used. Sequencing of PCR products was
completed by the San Diego State MicroChemical Core
Facility using an ABI 377 DNA sequencer.
Database and Phylogenetic Analyses
The sequence chromatogram files were imported and analyzed using XplorSeq 2.0, a program written by Dr. Dan
Frank at the University of Colorado (unpublished).
XplorSeq imports chromatograms and determines the
quality of the sequence using automatic base calling software [61]. The program also processes a batch BLAST
through the NCBI database and outputs files that can easily be transferred to Microsoft Excel or the sequences
exported as text files in the Fasta format.

We used the Fastgroup II program [62], to trim the 3' end
of all the cleaned sequences, count replicate sequences for
determining abundance of clones in libraries, and to identify a single representative for further alignment and phylogenetic analysis. The count data also allowed us to
estimate the sequence coverage for each library. Coverage
(C) was calculated using the following equation,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/27

C = 1 - n/N
, where n is the number of unique OTU sequences
observed and N is the total number of OTUs (i.e., sum of
unique OTUs plus OTUs observed more than once) [63].
After Fastgroup analysis, the sequences were aligned using
the NAST alignment software [64]. This program aligns
rRNA gene sequences to a diverse set of full-length rRNA
gene sequences that have been rigorously aligned using
the RNA secondary structure. From here the aligned
sequences were imported into the ARB application [65].
Bacterial colony species identifications were completed
using a combination of BLAST results and phylogenetic
analysis using the ARB program. Clone library sequences
and other sequences identified in GenBank were aligned
using ARB and exported as Nexus files for phylogenetic
analysis using PAUP* [66] and MrBayes version 3.1.2
[67].
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with two different
data sets (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). For each of the data sets,
trees were constructed using three different methods:
Bayesian, Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum
Likelihood (ML). The MODELTEST program [68] was
used to choose the DNA substitution model that best fit
our particular dataset. Bayesian analyses were performed
using the General Time Reversible model [69] with a
gamma-distributed among-site substitution rate heterogeneity and a fraction of sites constrained to be invariable
(GTR+I+G).
All Bayesian analyses were done with four independent
Markov chains run for 3,000,000 MCMC generations.
Trees were sampled every 200 generations with a burn-in
of 2000 trees. The best Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree, or
set of trees, was found through a random addition
sequence heuristic search strategy with 100 replicates. The
maximum number of trees kept during each search was
capped at 1000. For the MP bootstrap analyses, we performed MP searches on 100 bootstrap replicated datasets
using the same heuristic search strategy except with 10,
rather than 100, search replicates. We also performed a
Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis using the GTR+I+G
model of evolution and a random addition sequence heuristic search strategy with 10 replicates to find the highest
likelihood tree.
