Abstract
Background: Recent advances in genome sequencing suggest a remarkable conservation in gene
content of mammalian organisms. The similarity in gene repertoire present in different organisms
has increased interest in studying regulatory mechanisms of gene expression aimed at elucidating
the differences in phenotypes. In particular, a proximal promoter region contains a large number
of regulatory elements that control the expression of its downstream gene. Although many studies
have focused on identification of these elements, a broader picture on the complexity of
transcriptional regulation of different biological processes has not been addressed in mammals. The
regulatory complexity may strongly correlate with gene function, as different evolutionary forces
must act on the regulatory systems under different biological conditions. We investigate this
hypothesis by comparing the conservation of promoters upstream of genes classified in different
functional categories.
Results: By conducting a rank correlation analysis between functional annotation and upstream
sequence alignment scores obtained by human-mouse and human-dog comparison, we found a
significantly greater conservation of the upstream sequence of genes involved in development, cell
communication, neural functions and signaling processes than those involved in more basic
processes shared with unicellular organisms such as metabolism and ribosomal function. This
observation persists after controlling for G+C content. Considering conservation as a functional
signature, we hypothesize a higher density of cis-regulatory elements upstream of genes
participating in complex and adaptive processes.
Conclusion: We identified a class of functions that are associated with either high or low
promoter conservation in mammals. We detected a significant tendency that points to complex
and adaptive processes were associated with higher promoter conservation, despite the fact that
they have emerged relatively recently during evolution. We described and contrasted several
hypotheses that provide a deeper insight into how transcriptional complexity might have been
emerged during evolution.

Background
Transcription regulation is among the most sophisticated
of regulatory processes, involving a complex combinatorial selection of cis- and trans-acting signals [1]. Proximal
upstream regions of a gene in particular contain many cisregulatory elements that regulate the expression of the
gene by binding to various transcription factors. Many of
the cis-regulatory motifs have been successfully identified
by phylogenetic footprinting, which makes use of crossspecies sequence conservation as a functional signature
[2-6]. Based on this rationalization, we aimed to test if the
complexity of transcriptional regulation depends on gene
function, by looking at the sequence conservation at the
proximal upstream region. This is the first whole genome
study providing statistical evidence of significant conservation in upstream regions of human genes involved in
certain biological processes and functions.
There have been studies on how gene function is related
to degree of conservation and evolutionary rate in the protein-coding region. For example, Clark et al. [7] detected
functional categories that showed accelerated evolution of
the protein-coding region in human compared to chimp,
based on site-specific dN/dS ratios. The functional categories include 'olfaction', 'signal transduction', 'cell adhesion', 'transport', 'developmental processes', 'ion channel'
and 'extracellular matrix'. In [8], Dorus et al. reported that
the protein coding regions of the genes linked to nervous
system development show positive selection in the primate lineage compared to rodents, by using housekeeping
genes as a control. Bustamante et al. [9] compared withinspecies polymorphism and between-species divergence to
detect positively and negatively selected human genes.
Functional categories with an excess of positively selected
genes included 'sensory perception', 'defence/immunity
protein' and in particular, 'transcription factor'. Some discrepancy exists among studies, since [9] detected 'ecto-

derm development', 'extracellular matrix' and 'voltagegated potassium channel' as categories with an excess of
negatively selected genes.
Little is known about how the proximal upstream regions
evolve in those genes that are detected to be positively
selected, even though it is an interesting question whether
the noncoding regulatory regions will show a similar pattern as the coding regions. Interestingly, we detected a significantly higher upstream conservation in these adaptive
genes, particularly those involved in development, cell
communication, signal transduction, transcription factor
and neurophysiological functions. One possibility is that
there is opposite purifying selection on the upstream regulatory region and the protein-coding region. The other
possibility is that a relatively high regulatory complexity
exists in these genes and that their dense cis-regulatory elements provide higher promoter conservation. We speculate that the latter explanation is biologically more
intuitive. According to [10], a complex network can rapidly achieve the ability to buffer mutations. One interesting connection we can make is that the genes in a complex
network tend to evolve more rapidly in the sequence level
because their mutations can be buffered more easily.
Thus, in this paper, we provide a possible insight on the
combinatorial complexity of the transcriptional regulation and its evolutionary meanings of the most complex
and adaptive processes such as development and cell
communication.

Results
We identified functional categories that are enriched
towards high proximal promoter conservation by computing a Spearman's rank correlation on upstream
sequence alignment scores and Gene Ontology (GO) [11]

The terms 'development', 'morphogenesis' and 'organogenesis' were found at the top of the list, followed by 'cell
communication', 'signal transduction', 'transcription factor activity' and 'neurophysiological process'. Interestingly, more routine processes such as 'biosynthesis' and
'ribosome' turned out to be correlated with low upstream
alignment scores (Table 1, 2, Additional file 1: Table 1).
When we compared the alignment scores of negatively
correlated terms vs. the most positively correlated terms,
we found a 50% increase in the 1 kb, 2 kb and 5 kb align-

ment scores from former to the latter. The differences in
alignment scores are clearly noticeable in the histograms
of alignment scores of selected terms provided in Figure 1.
In order to confirm that the phenomenon we observed in
human/mouse proximal promoter conservation is also
observed with respect to other mammalian genomes and
is not specific to human and mouse, we conducted a similar analysis based on human and dog genomes. The same
key terms were found to be significantly correlated. (Addi-

tional file 2: Table 2). Also, we obtained very similar
results by employing a different score function (SL) that
penalizes sparsely distributed matches (details provided
in the Method section). Thus, the significance is not an
artifact of the global alignment scores that can be affected
by random matches that are not functional motifs.

developmental regulatory network spanning large chromosomal regions. However, most of the UCRs are far
from genes, and few proximal promoter regions overlap
with UCRs, suggesting that the complexity of regulation
suggested by proximal promoter conservation is independent of UCR-mediated regulation.

Among developmental genes, we noticed that 36 Hox or
Hox homologue genes (listed in Additional file 3: Table 3)
had very high alignment scores (mean = 699.28, 1359.2
and 3235.6, two-sample KS-test p-value (two-tailed) =
9.19 × 10-17, 1.68 × 10-17 and 2.65 × 10-17 for 1 kb, 2 kb
and 5 kb upstream, respectively). Differential expression
of Hox genes confers positional identities in developing
cells by forming sharp boundaries along the antero-posterior axis, and the strong conservation of the promoter
region is very well expected. Genes involved in embryonic
patterning such as SHH and PTCH also showed high promoter conservation (2 kb scores 1262 and 1522, respectively). Figure 2 visualizes the upstream alignments of
selected development genes with top alignment scores.

The alignment score can be affected by G+C content
(G+C%). Mutational biases that depend on base composition may affect the baseline conservation and it is easier
to get a match in an alignment with high or low G+C%.
Indeed, G+C% was positively correlated with alignment
scores and even with the terms 'development', 'cell communication' and 'regulation of transcription' (data not
shown). It can also affect the relationship between function and promoter conservation, because promoter type
depends on G+C%. Also, a high G+C% is indicative of a
higher neutral substitution rate, due to a higher rate of
mutation at methylated cytosines in CpG sites and some
other factors [15,16]

Many transcription factors play important roles in development. There are a significantly large number of developmental genes among transcription factors, based on the
GO annotation (215 out of 674, χ2 test p-value = 7.82 ×
10-85), indicating a larger number of both trans-elements
as well as cis-elements in the developmental gene network. Then, is it transcription factors that contribute most
to the enrichment of development? In order to test this,
we performed rank correlation tests using only developmental genes. From the analysis based on 1 kb scores,
only the term 'transcription factor activity' was enriched at
the top (mean = 597.37, p = 4.43 × 10-3). However, in
similar analyses on 2 kb and 5 kb, no significant term was
identified, indicating that genes other than transcription
factors must also contribute to the significantly higher
upstream conservation of development. Even for 1 kb
upstream regions, the significant enrichment of 'development' is not exclusively due to transcription factor genes,
because a rank correlation test without the 674 transcription factor genes also gave strong significance for development. (p = 5.24 × 10-28) (similar for 2 kb and 5 kb
regions).
Cell communication is known to play an important role
in development [12]. However, cell communication and
signal transduction remained significant after rank tests
without developmental genes, indicating the significant
correlation was not because of the developmental genes
that also participate in these processes.
It has been reported that ultraconserved non-coding
regions (UCRs) are located around key developmental
regulator genes [13,14], which may suggest a complex

We performed a partial rank correlation [17] between
upstream alignment score and GO term label, controlling
for G+C%, to eliminate the effect of G+C% in the correlation test. There was no significantly enriched term for 1 kb
upstream after the partial correlation, but for 2 kb and 5
kb, the key terms detected remained, indicating G+C%
generally had little effect on our results (Additional file 4:
Table 4).
A high upstream G+C% may also reflect a potential CpG
island, which plays a role in transcriptional repression in
a variety of types of cells and tissues. To compare regulation by CpG island methylation and regulation via other
cis-regulatory elements, we performed a rank correlation
test between CpG dinucleotide frequency in 1 kb, 2 kb
and 5 kb upstream regions of human genes and GO term
label. The result was somewhat different from the alignment score/functional label analysis, in that terms related
to metabolism, cell cycle and transcription were found to
be positively correlated and terms related to response to
external signal, immune response, membrane and extracellular matrix were negatively correlated with high CpG
frequency (Additional file 5: Table 5).

Discussion
A commonly invoked heuristic for discovery of functional
sites is locating regions of high similarity across multiple
species. Thus, a relatively high proportion of such conserved regions may indicate an increased number of functional cis-elements. This in turn may suggest a more
complex combinatorial circuitry in the transcriptional regulatory network, since higher density of functional cis-elements will allow more combinations of trans-acting
signals as well.

In this context, our results indicate the existence of a relatively high complexity in the transcriptional regulation of
development, cell communication, signal transduction,
transcriptional regulation and neurophysiological function as compared to those of ribosomes and metabolism.
This explanation is supported by prior gene-specific studies. For example, the sea urchin gene Endo16 has been
found to have a dense distribution of cis-elements. Endo16
is expressed in the endoderm and may play a role in cell
adhesion. Its upstream sequence has been well characterized to have complex cis-regulatory modules [18] and the
proximal promoter region was shown to be highly conserved during evolution [19].
However, a caveat of the analysis is the interpretation of
alignment data. A match in an alignment is not an accurate indicator of either purifying selection or functionality
of that site, since non-functional sites under neutral evolution can remain unchanged by vertical inheritance or
multiple/reverse mutation. However, the effect of neutral
mutation can be ignored in this analysis. Neutral mutations that have occurred between human and mouse lineage can be considered to be saturated, because of the
sufficiently high evolutionary distance between these species [20]. The G+C%-partialling analysis described in the
Result section also suggests that the difference in neutral
substitution rate has little effect on our results.
Stronger purifying selection on the promoter cis-elements
of complex genes is another alternative explanation. It is
not easy to tell if a conserved region is from a single highly
important functional site or from overlaps of less important functional sites. An increased percent identity in a
genomic region may indicate more important functional
elements (stronger purifying selection) rather than a
larger number of functional elements residing in that
region.
In the classic Waddington's canalization theory, purifying
(e.g. stabilizing) selection is a driving force for developmental genes to attain robustness against genetic and
environmental changes [21]. In this context, developmental genes may undergo stronger purifying selection than
others (Plotkin JB, personal communication). However, a
recent view provided by [10] denies the necessity of stabilizing selective pressure to attain robustness for a system
that can be represented as an interacting network. Developmental [10] and nervous system [22] can be represented as a network and thus the genes involved in these
systems can intrinsically achieve the buffering ability. The
finding that protein-coding regions of these genes
undergo rapid evolution in humans [7-9] may indicate
that the complexity of their network can buffer the mutations in the sequence level more easily. Our regulatory
complexity hypothesis is consistent with the network

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/168

implementation of canalization in developmental genes.
Multiple regulatory sites interacting with increased
number of trans-factors can achieve increased network
connectivity. Although we find this explanation more biologically intuitive than the hypothesis that the higher
purifying selection on the genes that has positive evolution in the protein-coding region, purifying selection and
regulatory complexity might not be entirely disjoint and
both factors can contribute to the conservation of promoter sequences as well as to their buffering capacity.
Another alternative hypothesis is that the transcriptional
control of development genes is modulated by a family of
transcription factors that require an increased specificity
or a longer binding site. Indeed, many developmental regulators act as dimers that can take up larger areas on DNA.
However, dimerization can also be considered a part of
gene regulation (e.g. different heterodimeric combinations, dominant negative-type repression, etc.) and therefore would support the complex regulation hypothesis.
Recently, a similar study [23] was performed in yeast (that
lacks developmental, neural or complex cell communication mechanisms) and it was reported that steroid, alcohol and carbohydrate metabolisms tend to be associated
with higher promoter conservation in yeast. However,
after a more careful examination of the entire GO term list
provided in the Supplementary Material of [23], we found
that the terms 'transcription factor activity', 'signal transduction', 'cell communication' and 'cellular morphogenesis' were associated with higher promoter conservation,
whereas 'structural constituents of ribosome', 'DNA
recombination' and 'RNA processing' had insignificant
but negative enrichment, showing a consistent pattern
with our results in mammals.
It has been suggested that a large fraction of genetic components in the evolution of development involves
changes in transcriptional regulation [24]. One possible
explanation of the link between complex regulation and
adaptation is that adaptive changes in complex processes
tend to occur in an incremental fashion, by slowly adding
to its regulatory complexity, so that other important parts
of the process remain functionally intact.

Conclusion
We identified a class of functions that are associated with
either high or low promoter conservation in mammals.
We detected a significant tendency that complex and
adaptive processes were associated with higher promoter
conservation, despite the fact that they have emerged relatively recently during evolution. We described and contrasted several hypotheses that provide a deeper insight
into how transcriptional complexity might have been
emerged during evolution.

Methods
Promoter alignment and GO term labelling
To measure proximal promoter conservation, upstream
alignment scores of human genes were computed by
counting the number of matches in the alignment
between the sequence 1 kb, 2 kb and 5 kb upstream of the
transcription start site and its syntenic mouse sequence. In
the cases in which a human gene had no recorded mouse
counterpart, the score was set to 0. The alignments were
obtained directly from the UCSC genome browser [25]
(version Jun-2003). Genes with multiple promoter assignments were not included in the analysis, to avoid bias due
to alternative promoters or incorrect annotation of transcription start sites. Consequently, 14449, 14434, 14412
genes were assigned alignment scores for 1 kb, 2 kb and 5
kb upstream, respectively.

GO term labeling was done as follows: for each of the
17594 non-obsolete GO terms, each gene was labeled 1 if
it is annotated with the term itself or any of its descendants and 0 otherwise. Thus, each term was represented by
a binary vector whose size is the number of the genes. We
used the latest version of GO annotation downloaded on
March 2005. The alignment scores and GO annotations of
all the genes analyzed can be found in Additional file 6:
Table 6.
Rank correlation test
A Spearman rank correlation test [26] was performed on
each GO term vector and the upstream alignment score
vector, in order to test whether each GO term is associated
with high or low proximal upstream conservation. Twotailed p-values were calculated using Student's t-distribution. All the p-values provided in this paper and additional files are Bonferroni-corrected and the significance
level used was α = 0.05.
Human vs. dog
We used multi-species (human, chimp, dog, mouse, rat,
chicken, zebrafish and fugu) upstream alignments downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (version May
2004) and extracted the human and dog alignment. The
scoring scheme and correlation method were the same as
in the human-mouse analysis described above.
Modification of the alignment scores
Throughout the study described in the paper, we have
used a simple global alignment score that might fail to
capture a variety of features that represent patterns of conservation such as locally clustered functional regions.
Thus, we tried a modified alignment score SL that penalizes sparsely distributed matches compared to locally
enriched 'match blocks'.

SL = (# of matches) – (# of non-match blocks) + 1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/168

where a non-match block means consecutive runs of nonmatches (mismatches or gaps) flanked by matches.
The last 1 is added to shift the score to be nonnegative.
This score becomes 0 either when there is no match or all
the matches are of length 1. The longer the blocks of
matches are, the larger SL is.
