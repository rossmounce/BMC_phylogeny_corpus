Abstract
Comparison of 18S rDNA gene sequences is a very promising method for identification and classification of living
organisms. Molecular identification and discrimination of different Dunaliella species were carried out based on the
size of 18S rDNA gene and, number and position of introns in the gene. Three types of 18S rDNA structure have already
been reported: the gene with a size of ~1770 bp lacking any intron, with a size of ~2170 bp consisting one intron near
5' terminus, and with a size of ~2570 bp harbouring two introns near 5' and 3' termini. Hereby, we report a new 18S
rDNA gene arrangement in terms of intron localization and nucleotide sequence in a Dunaliella isolated from Iranian
salt lakes (ABRIINW-M1/2). PCR amplification with genus-specific primers resulted in production of a ~2170 bp DNA
band, which is similar to that of D. salina 18S rDNA gene containing only one intron near 5' terminus. Whilst, sequence
composition of the gene revealed the lack of any intron near 5' terminus in our isolate. Furthermore, another alteration
was observed due to the presence of a 440 bp DNA fragment near 3' terminus. Accordingly, 18S rDNA gene of the
isolate is clearly different from those of D. salina and any other Dunaliella species reported so far. Moreover, analysis of
ITS region sequence showed the diversity of this region compared to the previously reported species. 18S rDNA and ITS
sequences of our isolate were submitted with accesion numbers of EU678868 and EU927373 in NCBI database,
respectively. The optimum growth rate of this isolate occured at the salinity level of 1 M NaCl. The maximum
carotenoid content under stress condition of intense light (400 μmol photon m-2 s-1), high salinity (4 M NaCl) and
deficiency of nitrate and phosphate nutritions reached to 240 ng/cell after 15 days.
Background
Dunaliella is an unicellular halotolerant microalga with a
great potential as transgenic bioreactor [1], and more significantly, food source and pharmaceuticals due to its
ability to accumulate large amounts of carotenoids [2].
Isolation and identification of novel species and strains
from natural habitats is the main purpose in the path of
obtaining superior productive strains. On one hand due
to environmental adaptation and lacking of a cell wall, a
certain Dunaliella isolate may exhibit different morphological and physiological behaviour in different conditions [3]. On the other hand, wide geographic
distribution of saline systems and required distinctive
adaptations to these environments lead to extensive

diversity of the organisms living in these systems [4]. In
addition, slight molecular-based phylogenetic differences
of Dunaliella species can reveal deep distinction in production of metabolites such as carotenoids [5]. Hence,
molecular characterization provides an important tool
for exploring biodiversity of Dunaliella and better understanding of its taxonomy.
Identification and classification of the organisms based
on conserved and variable regions of 16S or 18S rDNA is
a common procedure in taxonomy studies [6]. 18S rDNA
gene has been used for molecular identification of different species of Dunaliella as eukaryotic microorganism [79]. Besides using intron sizing method, particular 18S
rDNA fingerprint profiles were reported as an indicator
for hyperproducer species [10]. Ribosomal spacer
sequences, including ITS regions have been also frequently utilized for discrimination of genetic variation in
green algae [11-15]. Sequence comparison of the ITS

Dunaliella sp. ABRII M1/2

DNA extraction was performed when the cell density of
liquid culture was approximately 8 × 103 cell/ml. In order
to confirm the genus of the isolate, PCR amplification of
18S rDNA gene was performed using MA1-MA2 primers. These primers allow amplification of almost full
length of 18S rDNA in different Dunaliella species. In
addition, to investigate the species level of our isolate,

Results and Discussion

PCR amplification was carried out using the species-specific primers. PCR amplification with MA1-MA2,
resulted in production of a ~2170 bp DNA band (Figure
1). The amplification with species-specific primers of
DSs-MA2, DPs-MA2 and DBs-MA2 created no DNA
fragment.
Using MA1-MA2, the presence of the DNA amplicon
confirmed the genus of our isolate as Dunaliella. Concerning the species of Dunaliella, it is reminded that D.
tertiolecta, D. salina, D. parva and D. bardawil produce
~1770, ~2170, ~2570 and ~2570 bp DNA fragments with
these primers, respectively [7,8]. Based on the submitted
sequence of D. viridis (GenBank: DQ009776), 18S rDNA
band size of about 2500 bp is expected using these primers. As shown in figure 1, the size of the amplified DNA
was similar to 18S rDNA size of two 19/3 and 19/18
strains of D. salina.
Moreover, according to Olmos et al. (2000 & 2002)
DSs-MA2 should amplify a DNA fragment of ~750 bp in
D. salina, DPs-MA2 should produce DNA amplicon with
the size of ~1050 bp in D. parva and DBs-MA2 should
amplify a fragment of ~1000 bp in D. bardawil. Because
D. tertiolecta lacks any intron, no DNA amplicon is
expected with species-specific primers. Taken these
results together, although the size of 18S rDNA gene was
similar to that of D. salina, creation of no PCR product

ladder

region was utilized to predict genetic relatedness and to
study phylogeny and taxonomy of Dunaliella [5,15].
18S rDNA gene in Dunaliella genus contains relatively
conserved region of exon(s) and variable region of
intron(s). It is worth nothing that some species don't have
any intron. Wilcox et al. (1992) declared that the type of
introns present in the genus Dunaliella belongs to group I
[16]. Different secondary structure of group I introns
makes it distinguished from those of group II and III
introns [17]. Group I introns display widespread but
irregular distribution in the organisms [18]. These
introns are frequently present in lower eukaryotes, especially algae and fungi [19,20]. Since nuclear rDNAs are
heritable, group I introns can be used as phylogenetic
markers [20]. Olmos et al. (2000 and 2002) [7,8] designed
and used conserved primers (directed to exon region of
18S rDNA) and species-specific primers (directed to the
introns of 18S rDNA) to identify some species. Based on
these studies, some intron arrangements in 18S rDNA
region were identified in different species of Dunaliella.
They reported that 18S rDNA gene of D. tertiolecta
(~1770 bp) lacks any intron, 18S rDNA gene of D. salina
(~2170 bp) has just one intron after the first exon at 5' terminus that we call as intron 1. 18S rDNA gene in both
species D. parva and D. bardawil (~2570 bp) possess two
introns; one after the first exon at 5' terminus and the
other after the second exon at 3' terminus that we name
them as introns 1 and 2, respectively. More recently partial sequence of D. viridis 18S rDNA gene (GenBank:
DQ009776) has been submitted with a size of 2494 bp in
NCBI [21]. D. viridis has a longer intron compared to the
introns 1 and 2, after the first and before the second exon,
again at 5' terminus. We name this intron as intron 3. As
molecular aspects of these microorganisms have not been
studied enough, and so little is known about the different
types of intron arrays, there is possibility of revealing
diverse structure of 18S rDNA region. This may lead to
discovery of new species/subspecies. This research was
conducted to study the structure of 18S rDNA gene in
one of the Iranian isolates of Dunalilla. The investigation
was accompanied by studying ITS region simultaneously.
18S rDNA and ITS region of this isolate were submitted
at NCBI by accession numbers of EU678868 and
EU927373, respectively.

with any of species-specific primers including DSs-MA2
suggests that 18S rDNA profile in our isolate is different
from the others studied so far.
RFLP and Sequence analysis of 18S rDNA gene

The accuracy of the discrepancy from D. salina was
approved by RFLP analysis. The restriction patterns of
18S rDNA gene of the isolate ABRIINW-M1/2 exhibited
different polymorphism (data not shown) comparing
with both strains of D. salina 19/3 and 19/18. When
digested with Taq I, 18S rDNA of our isolate was cut into
5 restricted fragments, while in both standard D. salina
samples 4 different fragments were produced.
18S rDNA sequencing was performed in order to
obtain detailed information regarding the structure of
this region in our isolate. The sequence of our isolate
along with those of other Dunaliella species were aligned
multiply (Figure 2). Due to the lack of any intron in D.
tertiolecta 18S rDNA gene, this species was excluded
from the figure and further analysis. As seen in figure 2,
our isolate (ABRIINW-M1/2) lacks a fragment composed
of 414 nucleotides extended from 1164 to 1578 corresponding to the intron 1. Moreover, the gene of our isolate possesses a variable region of 440 nucleotides at 3'
terminus starting from about nucleotide 2195. Numbering was conducted according to the 18S rDNA sequence
of D. parva with accession number of M62998. Lack of
intron 1 and presence of intron 2 in our isolate discriminate the isolate from D. salina which contains only intron
1, as we already discussed in the introduction. It should
be noted that according to DNA alignment, partially submitted 18S rDNA sequence of D. peircei (strain UTEX LB
2192, GenBank: DQ009778) whose fingerprint profile
was unpublished includes a corresponding region extending from about 1164 to 1580, in the same position as the
intron of D. salina.
D. parva and D. bardawil contain both intron 1 and
intron 2 with a 18S rDNA length of about 2570 nucleotides. This is while, our isolate lacks intron 1 and harbours a 18S rDNA with a size of about 2170 nucleotides.
Therefore, the isolate would be different from D. parva
and D. bardawil.
D. viridis contains only one longer intron compared
with introns 1 and 2. It is settled after the first and before
the second exon in a position near to 5' terminus with a
size of about 810 nucleotides. Accordingly, the isolate
does not belong to the species of D. viridis, either. The
position and arrangement of introns in different forms is
depicted in Figure 3.
18S rDNA sequence of our isolate was submitted at
NCBI by the name of Dunaliella sp. ABRIINW-M1/2 and
accesion number of EU678868. ABRIINW stands for

(UPGMA), Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Minimum
Evolution (ME) of MEGA4 showed similar clade arrangement. They strongly supported (88-93% bootstrap values)
the branch including Dunaliella sp. ABRIINW-M1/2 differing from other taxa. Figure 4 shows the result of bootstrap analysis of NJ tree. All sequences in the dendrogram
were divided into three lineages of A, B and C. As seen in
the figure, Dunaliella sp. ABRIINW-M1/2 appeared as
individual entity (clade B) differing from two strains (19/3
and 19/18) of D. salina and D. peircei (clade A) with high
bootstrap value (93%). The cluster including clades A and
B was divergent from clade C which is composed of D.
viridis, D. bardawil and D. parva.
In the next step, the intron location of various
Dunaliella species were marked and they were aligned
seperately (Figure 5). This analysis showed that the intron
of Dunaliella sp. ABRIINW-M1/2, displayed the highest
similarity of 79% and 83% with intron 2 present in D.
parva and D. bardawil.

In order to better investigate the similarity of intron
regions, phylogenetic tree was calculated using neighborjoining (NJ). The result of bootstrap analysis of NJ tree is
displayed in Figure 6. The intron sequences were clustered in two separate groupings. The intron of D. salina
19/3 and D. salina 19/18 together with the corresponding
region in D. peircei showed homology with the clade containing intron 1 of D. parva and D. bardawil which has
lineage with D. viridis. The single intron of ABRIINWM1/2 was grouped with intron 2 of D. bardawil and D.
parva. These results further approved the novelty of the
gene arrangement.
PCR amplification and sequence analysis of ITS region

In addition to 18S rDNA gene, we PCR ampified and
sequenced Internal Transcribed Sequence (including
ITS1, 5.8 rDNA and ITS2) of our isolate to assess the
diversity with other members of Dunaliella genus. PCR
amplification of ITS region resulted in production of a

size in the other species. This length was expected as it
was found that ITS region in Dunaliella does not show
the length variation at intra- or interspecific level (10).
Then the sequence was aligned with 16 different strains
(table 1) whose ITS sequences were fully recorded at

NCBI including the outgroup of Ch. reinhardtii (Figure

In order to study phylogenetic relationship between our
isolate and the other Dunaliella species based on ITS
region, different algorithms available at MEGA4 were utilized. Figure 9 shows the corresponding dendrogram
established by NJ. As expected the outgroup, Ch. reinhardtii was the divergent from other taxa related to
Dunaliella species. The cluster analysis of 16 taxa including our isolate demonstrated their association into four
clades. Clade A contains all strains of D. tertiolecta
(CCAP 19/27, ATCC 30929, SAG 13.86 and Dtsi), two
strains of D. salina (SAG 42.88 and Dsge), D. primolecta,
D. parva, D. bardawil and Dunaliella sp. hd10. Clade B
consists of two strains of D. salina Ds18S1 and D. salina
Ds18S3. Clade C includes two other strains of D. salina
(CCAP 19/3 and CCAP 19/3) with weak bootstrap value
of 50%. The isolate of our interest, Dunaliella sp. ABRIINW-M1/2 appeared in clade D together with D. viridis
strain CONC002 (bootstrap value: 83%). The tree supported the split between this clade (D) and all other taxa
included in clades A, B and C.

The carotenoied content of the cells, cultivated under
stress condition of high light intensity (400 μmol photon

(deficiency of KNO3 and KH2PO4), was measured on days
12, 15 and 21. The carotenoid content of the cells reached
to the maximum amount of 240 ng/cell after 15 days and
remained constant till day 21.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates a new 18S rDNA arrangement in
Dunaliella genus. Although the size of 18S rDNA is similar to that of D. salina, position and nucleotide structure
of the intron is clearly different. The isolate differs from
D. bardawil and D. parva by the size of 18S rDNA and
number of the introns. Likewise, it varies from D. viridis
in terms of 18S rDNA gene length, and the size and position of the intron. Further, analysis of ITS region
sequence indicated that this region in our isolate shows
similarity ranging from 78-88% with those of previously
known species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, this
isolate with its closest related taxon of D. viridis was
divergent from all other taxa. Thereupon, the reported
sequences are considered as novel 18S rDNA arrangement and distinct ITS region. Optimum growth of this
isolate occurred at 1 M NaCl and Maximum total carotenoid was measured as 240 ng/ml. However, complementary morpho-physiological studies of the isolate are
needed to elucidate if the isolate is a new species/subspecies.
Materials and methods
Dunaliella isolation and culture condition

Sampling was attempted from Maharlou saline lake of
Iran. 10 ml of the specimens were cultivated in a liquid
medium described by Hejazi and Wijffles [22] containing

AB511842

9% NaCl. Dunaliella single clonies were obtained by
spreading the liquid culture on the solidified medium
containing 1.8% Agar. Then each single clony was cultured in 50 ml liquid medium. The culture was incubated
at 26°C and irradiance of of 80 μmol photon m-2 s-1 in the
photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D). Two strains of 19/3 and 19/18
D. salina were obtained from CCAP (Culture Collection
of Algae and Protozoa) as standard strains of D. salina.
Genomic DNA extraction

DNA extraction was conducted according to the protocol
developed in our laboratory: 1.5 microlitre of the green
algae culture was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm, and
supernatant was discarded. The micoalgal cells were suspended in the lysis buffer containing CTAB 10 g/l, NaCl
80 g/l, Trise 12 g/l, EDTA 7 g/l, LiCl 2 g/l, PVP 2 g/l and
shaked to be well mixed. After incubation at 60°C for 10
min, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000
rpm. Then equal volume of Chloroform-isoamylalcohol
(24:1) was added and again centrifuged for 5 min at 12000
rpm. Upperphase supernatant was transferred into a new
tube and genomic DNA was precipitated by addition of
equal volume of isopropanol. The tube was kept for 10
min at -20°C, then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min.
Supernatant was discarded and the DNA pellete was
finally washed twice using ethanol 70%.

PCR amplification of 18S rDNA

To amplify 18S rDNA gene, two conserved primers called
MA1 and MA2, corresponding to conserved regions of 5'
and 3' termini, respectively, were used as forward and
reverse primers [7]. PCR reactions were performed in 50
μl containing 20 ng genomic DNA in TE (Tris/EDTA)
buffer, pH 8 [23] and 50 ng of the primers using 1× PCR
Master Kit (CinnaGen PCR Masster Kit, Cat. No.
PR8250C). Amplification was performed using 32 cycles
in a TECHNE Thermal Cycler (Model: FTGRAD2D). The
amplification was achieved according to the method
described by Olmos et al. (2000).
Based on the differences in the number and sequence of
introns in various Dunaliella species, Olmos et al. (2000
& 2002) designed three species-specific primers of DSs
(5'-GCAGGAGAGCTAATAGGA-3'), DPs (5'-GTAGAGGGTAGGAGAAGT-3') and DBs (5'-GGGAGTCTTTT
TCCACCT-3') for descrimination of the species. Primer
DSs is directed to the single intron of D. salina. Primers
DBs, DPs are directed to the second intron of D. parva
and second intron of D. bardawil, respectively. They were
used as forward primers along with the primer MA2 as
reverse primer for species identification according to the
method suggested by Olmos et al. (2002).
PCR amplification of ITS region

rDNA and ITS2, full ITS sequence of 6 strains namely

tertiolecta CCAP 19/27 EF473748 and Dunaliella viridis
CONC 002 DQ377098 were imported to Oligo5 program. Two primers of AB1 (5'-AATCTATCAATAACCACACCG-3') and AB2 (5'-TTTCATTCGCCATTACTA
AGG-3') were designed according to conserved
sequences flanking ITS region in Dunaliella species.
These primers cover nucleotides 1-21 of ITS1 and 80-100
of 28S rDNA gene, respectively. The target sequence was
amplified in total mixture volume of 50 μl in above mentioned condition. PCR amplification was carried out as
follows: 5 min at 95°C as initial denaturing time, 35 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 57°C for 50 sec and 72°C for 1 min followed by final extention step of 72°C for 10 min.
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of
amplified 18S rDNA gene

For preliminary assessment of the sequence difference in
certain isolates/species which were assumed to be correlated, the PCR products of the relevant samples were
exposed to restriction endonuclease of Taq I. According
to the protocol of manufacters (Germany, Fermentase),
250 ng of the product was digested with 5 U of the
enzyme in 37 C for 3 hours. Restriction fragments were
resolved through 2% agarose gel and were stained by
ethidium bromide.

Purification and sequencing of PCR products

PCR amplicons were purified using PCR purification kit
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Then, the purified products were sequenced by Macrogen company (Korea). Using BLAST software, the determined sequences were compared with the sequences
deposited in NCBI GenBank as 18S rDNA and ITS
regions of different Dunaliella species.
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences

To analyze the phylogeny of the isolated Dunaliella, alignment of the sequences was performed with the sequences
of different Dunaliella species which were submitted in
NCBI database as complete sequence (table 1). Multiple
alignment was performed using Expasy, Multalin [At
GENOTOUL BIOINFO] website. Four algorithms available at MEGA4 ver. 4: Neighbour-Joining (NJ),
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmatic Mean
(UPGMA), Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Minimum
Evolution (ME) were employed to construct phylogenetic
relationships. Using NJ, the evolutionary distances were
computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
model and reliability of the branches was assessed by
bootstrapping the data with 1000 replicates. Phylogenetic
studies included Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (GenBank:
AB511836 and AB511842 for 18S rDNA and ITS region,
respectively) as the outgroup.
Salt tolerance and carotenoid production ability

To determine the optimum growth rate, the isolate of our
interest was grown at five different concentrations of
NaCl (0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 M). The flasks were maintained at
26°C and of 80 μmol photon m-2 s-1 in 16 h light: 8 h dark
cycle. Growth behaviour of the isolate was measured
every two days using a Neubaur haemocytometer.
For determination of carotenoid content, the described
liquid medium was prepared with 4 M NaCl. Further, the
cultures were exposed to deficiency of nitrate (KNO3)
and phosphate (KH2PO4). The flasks were shaked and
maintained at constant high light intensity of 400 μmol
photon m-2 s-1. The stress condition was considered to
obtain the maximum carotenoid production. Both optimum growth salinity and carotenoid studies were conducted in triplicate samples.
Carotenoid extraction was carried out after 12, 15 and
21 days cultivation. Its concentrations were deternined
spectrophotometrically according to the method
descrýbed by Hejazi et al. [24].
