Abstract
Background: Recent advances in the understanding of the maternal and paternal heritage of south
and southwest Asian populations have highlighted their role in the colonization of Eurasia by
anatomically modern humans. Further understanding requires a deeper insight into the topology of
the branches of the Indian mtDNA phylogenetic tree, which should be contextualized within the
phylogeography of the neighboring regional mtDNA variation. Accordingly, we have analyzed
mtDNA control and coding region variation in 796 Indian (including both tribal and caste
populations from different parts of India) and 436 Iranian mtDNAs. The results were integrated
and analyzed together with published data from South, Southeast Asia and West Eurasia.
Results: Four new Indian-specific haplogroup M sub-clades were defined. These, in combination
with two previously described haplogroups, encompass approximately one third of the haplogroup
M mtDNAs in India. Their phylogeography and spread among different linguistic phyla and social
strata was investigated in detail. Furthermore, the analysis of the Iranian mtDNA pool revealed
patterns of limited reciprocal gene flow between Iran and the Indian sub-continent and allowed the
identification of different assemblies of shared mtDNA sub-clades.
Conclusions: Since the initial peopling of South and West Asia by anatomically modern humans,
when this region may well have provided the initial settlers who colonized much of the rest of
Eurasia, the gene flow in and out of India of the maternally transmitted mtDNA has been

surprisingly limited. Specifically, our analysis of the mtDNA haplogroups, which are shared between
Indian and Iranian populations and exhibit coalescence ages corresponding to around the early
Upper Paleolithic, indicates that they are present in India largely as Indian-specific sub-lineages. In
contrast, other ancient Indian-specific variants of M and R are very rare outside the sub-continent.

Background
Two mtDNA macro-haplogroups (M and N) that arose
from the African haplogroup L3 encompass virtually all
mtDNAs outside Africa [1-4]. The phylogenetic node N
(including R) has spread its branches all over Eurasia, in
contrast to haplogroup M, which is found in Eastern Eurasia but is virtually absent in Europe. The numerous
branches of N are, however, generally segregated to either
the eastern (e.g. A, B [5], Y [6], R9 [7] or western (e.g. N1
[8,9], N2 (comprising of W and its sister-clade identified
by [10]), TJ, HV, U [11]) Eurasian-specific pools.
The majority of Indian mtDNAs belong to macro-haplogroup M [8,12-21]. While the topology of the M sub-haplogroups that are common in mainland East Asia (M7, M8
(including C, Z), M9 (including E), D, G [7,22,23]) and in
Africa (M1 [24]) is established in detail, the internal haplogroup structure of M in India has remained largely
undefined. We have previously demonstrated that transitions at nps. 477G, 1780, 8502 and 16319 designate
Indian-specific haplogroup M2, the most frequent M
clade in India [15]. Another Indian-specific M clade supported by HVS-I variation as well as coding region markers, is M6 [15]. Haplogroups M3, M4 and M5 have been
discriminated preliminarily by their characteristic HVS-I
mutations [19], but since their defining positions, 16126,
16311, and 16129, respectively, are phylogenetically
unstable [25,26], it is unlikely that the proposed haplogroups are monophyletic. Most numerous sub-groups of
macro-haplogroup N in India are the Indian-specific variants of the phylogenetic node R including haplogroups
R5, R6, U2(a, b, c) [8,13,27].

distinct sources [8,13,19]. The complexity that arises in
defining populations and groups of populations in India
based on genetic and cultural criteria has been recently
demonstrated in South Indian tribal and caste populations. The combined data from mtDNA, Y-chromosome
and autosomal genes indicated that the tribes and castes
derive largely from the same genetic heritage of Late Pleistocene southern and southwestern Asians, and have
received limited gene flow from external sources since the
Holocene [15]. Similar results were obtained by Cordaux
et al. [29], who demonstrated that caste and tribal groups
exhibit similar levels of molecular variance. However,
genetic distances indicated that the Tibeto-Burman speaking tribal populations (from eastern India) were more
closely related to East Asians than to other Indians [29].
This is consistent with an earlier suggestion placing the
origin of these tribal groups east of India – in Tibet and
Myanmar [30].
In this study, we have analyzed the mtDNA variation in a
sample of 796 Indians and 436 Iranians (Table 1), and
combined the results with previously published data from
the same geographic area. We also compared the mtDNA
variation in India and Iran with that of Europe, China,
and Thailand. The overall aim was to improve our understanding of the origins and composition of the Indian and
Iranian gene pools and to determine the nature and the
extent of gene flow between these regions. Through the
analyses of the genetic variation of extant Southwest and
South Asian populations we took an endeavor to envisage
the exodus of anatomically modern humans from Africa.

Results and Discussion
The overwhelming majority of the Iranian mtDNAs have
been shown to lie in the West Eurasian domain of the global human mtDNA pool [27,28]. Here we focus on the
analysis of mtDNA lineages that are shared between Indians and Iranians and bear signals of pre-Holocene expansion in the region.
India congregates four linguistic domains (Indo-European, Dravidic, Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman) that
occupy non-random spheres of the geographic distribution of its populations. The majority of the recent studies
based on mtDNA variation have, in contrast to some [21],
provided evidence that linguistic groups of India do not
represent genetically homogeneous units and are not,
therefore, traceable to different immigration waves from

Geographic distribution of macro-clades M and N in India
We found haplogroup M ubiquitous at almost 58%
among the caste, and 72% among the tribal populations
(Table 2), which is largely consistent with previous reports
[8,12-21]. Our results indicate that the frequency distribution of haplogroup M varies across different Indian
regions by a significant cline towards the south and the
east (see Figure 4 for Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis
(SAA) p < 0.05). The variation among caste populations
climbs from approximately 40% in Gujarat and (Indian-)
Punjab to 65% in the southern states, and peaks at over
70% in West Bengal (Table 2). We observed a similar geographic pattern among tribal populations, where the frequency varied from just over 50% in the northern states of
Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, increased to 70%–80% in

the southern states, and peaked at 86% in West Bengal
(Table 8, see Additional file 3).

U7 is also high in neighboring Pakistan (6%) and particularly in Iran (9%) (Table 9, see Additional file 4).

With the exception of the diverse set of largely Indian-specific R lineages, the most frequent mtDNA haplogroup in
India that derives from the phylogenetic node N is haplogroup W [13]. The frequency peak of haplogroup W is 5%
in the northwestern states – Gujarat, Punjab and Kashmir.
Elsewhere in India its frequency is very low (from 0 to
0.9%) (Table 2) forming a significant spatial cline (Figure
4).

MtDNA haplogroups in Iran
Over 90% of the mtDNAs found in Iran belong to haplogroups HV, TJ, U, N1, N2 and X, commonly found in West
Eurasia (Table 2). In contrast to Europe, where H is predominant among the mtDNA haplogroups, in Iran the
frequency of haplogroup U (29%) is higher than that of
haplogroup H (17%) (Table 9, see Additional file 4). This
difference accounts, at least partly for the presence in Iran
of U sub-groups, such as U7 (9.4%), that are virtually
absent in Europe.

At 15% among the caste and 8% among the tribal populations haplogroup U is the most frequent sub-clade of R
in India (Table 12, see Additional file 7). Approximately
one half of the U mtDNAs in India belong to the Indianspecific branches of haplogroup U2 (U2i: U2a, U2b and
U2c) [13,27] (Table 2). They are present throughout India
without a clear geographical cline (Figure 2, panel U2i,
SAA p > 0.05). However, the spread of another subset of
U, haplogroup U7 [13], is similar to that of haplogroup
W, peaking at 12% and 9% in Gujarat and Punjab, respectively (Table 11, see Additional file 6). The frequency of

Compared to India, haplogroup M frequency in Iran is
marginally low (5.3%) and there are no distinguished Iranian-specific sub-clades of haplogroup M. All Iranian haplogroup M lineages can be seen as derived from other
regional variants of the haplogroup: eleven show affiliation to haplogroup M lineages found in India, twelve in
East and Central Asia (D, G, and M8) and one in northeast
Africa (M1).

Indian-specific (R5 and Indian-specific M and U2 variants) and East Asian-specific (A, B and East Asian-specific
M subgroups) mtDNAs, both, make up less than 4% of
the Iranian mtDNA pool. We used Turkey (88.8 ± 4.0%)
as the third parental population for evaluating the relative
proportions of admixture from India (2.2 ± 1.7%) and
China (9.1 ± 4.1%) into Iran. Therefore we can conclude
that historic gene flow from India to Iran has been very
limited.
The package of the most ancient mtDNA haplogroups in
India
Approximately one tenth of the Indian haplogroup M
mtDNAs fall into its major sub-clade M2, which is defined
by the motif 477G-1780-8502-16319 [15]. M2 can be
further subdivided into haplogroups M2a (transitions at
nps 5252 and 8369) and M2b [15]. Haplogroup M2 and
its two major sub-clades reveal coalescence times of 50 to
70 thousand years (Table 3). Due to the increased frequency towards the southern part of India (Figure 1, panel
M2, SAA p < 0.05 Figure 4), M2 is significantly (p < 0.05)
more frequent among the Dravidic speakers than among
the Indo-European speakers who are spread mostly in the
northern regions of India (Table 2). It is more plausible
that geography rather than linguistics is behind this pattern, because the frequency of M2 amongst the Indo-European speaking populations in southern India is
significantly higher than that in the north, while there is
no significant difference between Dravidic and IndoEuropean speaking populations from the same geo-

graphic region (Table 2). It is also notable that the frequency of M2 among the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas of
Andhra Pradesh (CR 3.3 – 19.2%) is not significantly (p >
0.05) different from that among the other castes or the
tribal populations of the region (CR: 5–12.9%, 11.2–
18.3%, respectively). On the other hand, none of the 159
Brahmins and Kshatriyas from the northern states of India
(Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal)
belong to M2 while the frequency reaches nearly 3% (CR:
1.6–4.6%) among the other castes and tribal populations
of the region.
We found that R5, which is defined by transitions at nps
8594 [27], 16266 and 16304, is the second most frequent
sub-clade of R in India after haplogroup U. The coalescence age estimate for R5 was similar to that of M2 (Table
3), whereas individual boughs within the R5 limb showed
expansions from ca. 20,000 ybp to ca. 50,000 ybp (Figure
12, see Additional file 8). Our data indicate that this
diverse and ancient haplogroup is present over most of
India (Figure 3, panel R5). Though absent among the Austro- Asiatic tribal groups, R5 is spread across the other language boundaries. In contrast to M2, R5 is more frequent
among the caste (CR: 2.5–4.5%) than among the tribal
populations (CR: 0.7–1.9%) (Table 2).
Together with the Indian-specific sub-clades of haplogroup U2 [13,27], haplogroups M2 and R5 can be
discriminated as a package of Indian-specific mtDNA
clades harboring extremely deep coalescence times

(around 50,000 – 70,000 ybp). Together they constitute
nearly 15% of the Indian mtDNAs. Importantly, these
haplogroups are virtually absent elsewhere in Eurasia
[13,15], this study]. Because most of Indian varieties of
haplogroup M are still unclassified (M*), this package is

likely to be extended when more mtDNA coding region
information will become available for the M* lineages in
India.

The geographic distribution of the M2, R5 and U2i package seems to be rather uniform in the context of the
Indian-specific maternal lineages (SAA p > 0.05). When
excluding the mtDNAs that are likely to have arrived more
recently from West or East Eurasia, the share of the package among the caste populations in northern and southern India is roughly similar (CR: 16.1–24.5% and 19.5–
26.0 %, respectively). However, in accordance with expectations from the individual haplogroup distributions, the
tribal groups speaking Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman
languages are characterized by considerably lower values
(CR: 3.9–14.1% and 3.8–15.1%, respectively).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/26

appeared both in West- and East-Eurasia as well as in
India itself (Figure 5). However, not all the West-Eurasian
Y-chromosomal founder haplogroups are present in
India. Haplogroup E, for example, was possibly carried to
Europe and Western Asia later via the Levantine corridor
[33]. Similarly, a Late Upper Palaeolithic origin and
spread of mtDNA haplogroup X from Northeast Africa
and Middle East has been suggested lately [34].
The improved structure of autochthonous Indian mtDNA
clades
Nearly a third of Indian mtDNAs belonging to haplogroup M could be assigned to its existing boughs and
limbs with the current knowledge of the mtDNA coding
region polymorphisms (Table 9, see Additional file 4). It
is likely that the unclassified Indian M* and R* mtDNAs
are also to a large extent autochthonous because neither
the East nor West Eurasian mtDNA pools include such lineages at notable frequencies.

The quest for finding the origin of haplogroup M and a
plausible scenario for the peopling of Eurasia
Based on the high frequency and diversity of haplogroup
M in India and elsewhere in Asia, some authors have suggested (versus [3]) that M may have arisen in Southwest
Asia [16,17,31]. Finding M1 or a lineage ancestral to M1
in India, could help to explain the presence of M1 in
Africa as a result of a back migration from India. Yet, to
date this has not been achieved [15], this study). Therefore, one cannot rule out the still most parsimonious scenario that haplogroup M arose in East Africa [3].
Furthermore, the lack of L3 lineages other than M and N
(indeed, L3M and L3N) in India is more consistent with
the African launch of haplogroup M. On the other hand,
one also observes that: i) M1 is the only variant of haplogroup M found in Africa; ii) M1 has a fairly restricted phylogeography in Africa, barely penetrating into subSaharan populations, being found predominantly in
association with the Afro-Asiatic linguistic phylum – a
finding that appears to be inconsistent with the distribution of sub-clades of haplogroups L3 and L2 that have
similar time depths. That, plus the presence of M1 without
accompanying L lineages in the Caucasus [32] and [our
unpublished data], leaves the question about the origin of
haplogroup M still open.

Haplogroup M6 (Figure 6) is primarily found in the Indus
Valley and on the western shores of the Bay of Bengal
where its sub-clades M6a and M6b are concentrated
towards the southwest and the northeast, respectively
(Figure 1, panel M6, M6b cline is significant SAA p < 0.05,
Figure 4). The highest frequencies of M6a and M6b were
found amongst the Mukri scheduled caste from Karnataka
(17%) and in Kashmir (10%), respectively. The Mukri
form an endogamous group of no more than 10,000 individuals, who dwell on an area less than 2000 km2 [35].
That, together with the observation that all the sixteen M6
sequences found among the Mukri belong to a single haplotype, suggests that genetic drift has played a major role
in the demographic history of the Mukri. The statistical
significance of the high M6 frequency in Kashmir is
undermined by the small sample size (19 individuals),
which results in the very wide error margins for the frequency estimate (CR: 3.2–31.7%).

In contrast to haplogroup M, ancient sub-clades of haplogroup N are spread both east and west of India as well as
within India itself. Several migration scenarios involving
multiple "out of Africa" events punctuated by space, time
or both, could be invoked to explain the phylogeography
of these mtDNA haplogroups. Yet, using the parsimony
criterion it can be argued that only a single early migration
that brought ancestral lineages, M and N (with the latter
having already given rise to R), to South Asia could
account for the extant mtDNA phylogeography in Eurasia
[15]. The finding of several largely South and West Asianspecific sub-clades (H, L, R2, and F*) of the major Eurasian Y chromosomal haplogroups F and K also supports
this scenario [15]. From South and West Asia the
colonization would have sprung both east and west as
region-specific mtDNA and Y chromosomal sub-clades

Different geographic distributions characterize the subclades of M3 and M4 that we define by mtDNA coding
region markers (Table 3, Figures 7 and 8). Both M3a and
M4a show time depths around 20,000 ybp. However,
while M4a is sparsely spread in most of India with no
obvious geographical cline (Figure 2, panel M4a, SAA p >
0.05), the spread of M3a is concentrated into northwestern India (Figure 1, panel M3a, SAA p < 0.05), suggesting
that the region may have been the ancestral source. The
frequency of M3a is at its highest amongst the Parsees of
Mumbai (22%). Given the low M3a diversity amongst the
Parsees – the twelve M3a mtDNAs fall into the two most
common haplotypes (Figure 7) – the high frequency is
likely a result of admixture and subsequent founder
events. On the other hand, it is intriguing that, despite its
low frequency, M3a penetrates into central and south-

Peopling of Eurasia. Map of Eurasia and northeastern Africa depicting the peopling of Eurasia as inferred from the extant
mtDNA phylogeny. The bold black arrow indicates the possible "coastal" route of colonization of Eurasia by anatomically modern humans (ca. 60,000 – 80,000 ybp.). This "Southern Coastal Route" is suggested by the phylogeography of mtDNA haplogroup M, the virtual absence of which in the Near East and Southwest Asia undermines the likelihood of the initial colonization
of Eurasia taking a route north around the Red Sea. Therefore, the initial split between West and East Eurasian mtDNAs is
postulated between the Indus Valley and Southwest Asia. Spheres depict expansion zones where, after the initial (coastal)
peopling of the continent, local branches of the mtDNA tree (haplogroups given in the spheres) arose (ca. 40,000 – 60,000
ybp), and from where they where further carried into the interior of the continent (thinner black arrows). Admixture between
the expansion zones has been surprisingly limited ever since. We note that while there is no obvious need to introduce the
"northern route" – from northeast Africa over Sinai to the Near East – to explain the initial colonization of Eurasia, the spread
of some mtDNA and Y-chromosomal haplogroups implies that the "northern" passage might have been used in a later period

bor – or stem from – the 16048-16129-16223 motif were
positive for the 15928 transition, suggesting an additional
occurrence. In addition, we recorded this transition associated with three other HVS-I motifs on the background of
haplogroup M (M8-Z: 16185-16223-16260-16298; M*:
16223 and M*: 16086-16223-16335). These occurrences
cannot be monophyletic for obvious reasons. Yet, when
combined with the transition at np 16304, G15928A
roots a star-like subclade of haplogroup M that we tentatively named M25 (Figure 10). In this case, monophylecity is the most parsimonious assumption. This
haplogroup is moderately frequent in Kerala and Maharashtra but rather infrequent elsewhere in India (Figure 2,

period preceding the LGM.

Coalescence estimates for these Indian-specific mtDNA
haplogroups (M3a, M4a, M6, M25 and R6) fall largely
between 20,000 and 30,000 ybp. These estimates overlap
with those of many West Eurasian-specific (e.g. H, HV,
preHV, U3, U4, K, X [9,34]) and East Eurasian-specific (A,

Were the Austro-Asiatic speaking tribal people the earliest
inhabitants of India?
By calculating nucleotide diversities and expansion times
(using the method from [37]) for different linguistic
groups of India, some previous studies on mtDNA variation have distinguished the Austro-Asiatic speaking tribal
groups as the carriers of the genetic legacy of the earliest

Several Indian-specific mtDNA clades demonstrate a similar spread-pattern in southern India. We found haplogroups M4a, M6a and M18 in southeastern Tamil Nadu
and Andhra Pradesh while they were absent from neighboring Karnataka and Kerala (Figure 1 panel M6a and Figure 2 panels M4a and M18). One possible explanation is
that admixture has been facilitated along the coastlines of
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. On the other hand,
because the absolute frequencies of these haplogroups are
rather low, it cannot be ruled out that an increase of sample sizes would disrupt the observed spread-pattern.

settlers of the subcontinent [17,38]. However, because the
linguistic groups of India do not cluster into distinct
branches of the Indian mtDNA tree [13,15,19], this
study], calculating the beginning of expansion for those
groupings is problematic and likely controversial as well.
Recently, Basu et al. (2003) supported the conclusions of
[17,38] by reporting that the frequency of the ancient haplogroup M2 among the Austro-Asiatic tribal populations
is as high as 19%, and that they lack the slightly younger
haplogroup M4 (the likely paraphyletic mother-clade of
M4a). The authors have regarded the HVS-I transition at

np 16319 as sufficient in defining haplogroup M2. This
assumption, however, might lead to an overestimation of
M2 frequency and age. Indeed, the 16319 transition has
arisen several times on the background of other Indian
haplogroup M lineages (Table 7, see Additional file 2),
more specifically, in mtDNAs lacking the coding region
markers that define M2 [15].
Although two out of the four M2 sequences reported by
Basu et al. (2003) among the Lodha, Mundas and Santals
(HVS-I sequences originally published by [17]) do harbor
the characteristic M2a HVS-I motif (16223-16270-16274-

16319-16352), without information from the coding
region it is not clear whether the other two sequences
(HVS-I motifs: 16092-16179-16223-16289-16294-16319
and 16147G-16172-16223-16319) represent novel M2
sub-clades (because these sequences cannot be affiliated
with M2a or M2b) or derive from two independent
branches of haplogroup M where 16319 transition has
arisen recurrently. HVS-I motif 16147G-16172-16223, for
example, is commonly associated with haplogroup N1a.
Since sequence data on the five M2s among the AustroAsiatic speaking tribe Ho, reported by Basu et al. (2003),
have not been made available in the publication, we cannot rely on their haplogroup classification. Thus, we are
left with one Munda and one Santal mtDNA belonging to
haplogroup M2. They make up just 5% of the Austro-Asiatic tribal sample of 37 subjects (excluding the ten Ho).
Interestingly, we found no instances of haplogroup M2
among the 56 Lodhas analyzed in this study. Consequently, when excluding the recurrences of the 16319
transition on the background of other sequence motifs,
the frequency of M2 among the Austro-Asiatic speaking
tribal groups from West Bengal in the combined dataset

(Table 7, see Additional file 2) is significantly reduced to
about 2%. The corrected value is comparable to the M2
frequency (>3%) in tribal populations speaking IndoEuropean languages of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, but is
significantly lower than its frequency (>14%) among the
Dravidic-speaking tribal groups of Andhra Pradesh (Table
8, see Additional file 3).
Language families present today in India, such as IndoEuropean, Dravidic and Austro-Asiatic, are all much
younger than the majority of indigenous mtDNA lineages
found among their present-day speakers at high frequencies (see Additional file 9). It would make it highly speculative to infer, from the extant mtDNA pools of their
speakers, whether one of the listed above linguistically
defined group in India should be considered more "autochthonous" than any other in respect of its presence in the
subcontinent.
Additionally, we note that some recent linguistic and
archaeological evidence place the spread of the AustroAsiatic languages in the Neolithic, in conjunction with the

dispersal of rice cultivation from the Yangtze River basin
[39]. If this were the case, it would imply that the arrival
of this linguistic phylum in India was not associated with
female gene flow.
Gene flow from West Eurasia
Broadly, the average proportion of mtDNAs from West
Eurasia among Indian caste populations is 17% (Table 2).
In the western States of India and in Pakistan their share
is greater, reaching over 30% in Kashmir and Gujarat,
nearly 40% in Indian Punjab, and peaking, expectedly, at
approximately 50% in Pakistan (Table 11, see Additional
file 6, Figure 11, panel A). These frequencies demonstrate
a general decline (SAA p < 0.05 Figure 4) towards the
south (23%, 11% and 15% in Maharashtra, Kerala and Sri
Lanka, respectively) and even more so towards the east of
India (13% in Uttar Pradesh and around 7% in West Bengal and Bangladesh). The low (<3%) frequency of the
western Eurasian mtDNAs in Rajasthan may be in part a
statistical artifact due to the limited sample size of 35
Rajputs.

In comparison to an overall frequency of 17% (CR 15.1–
19.3%) among the caste populations, only 7% (CR 6.2 –
9.0%) of the mtDNAs from the tribal groups show
affiliation to the West Eurasian haplogroups. The
observed difference could be caused by differences in the
extent of gene flow from the west to different social layers
of the Indian society [19], and/or a more pronounced
genetic drift among the tribal groups.
This western Eurasian contribution into the Indian maternal gene pool can be broadly divided into two different
components. Over two thirds of the West Eurasian-specific mtDNAs found in India are made up by haplogroups
HV, TJ, N1 and West Eurasian-specific branches of haplogroup U. It is likely that these mtDNA haplogroups have
been carried to western India both by relatively low-intensity long-lasting admixture at the border regions as well as
a consequence of numerous but probably limited migrations during the last 10, 000 ybp [13]. The remaining one
third of the West Eurasian-specific mtDNAs found in
India is comprised of haplogroups U7, R2 and W showing
much deeper time depths in India – approximately forty
thousand years before present (Table 4). A large-scale
immigration – carrying these haplogroups – could have
introduced a substantial fraction of the diversity already
present within the putative source areas. This would
explain the deep coalescence times of these haplogroups
in India, while their actual arrival could have occurred
later. Alternatively, the coalescence estimates may indeed
reflect a deeper autochthonous history of these mtDNA
clades in India. It is worthwhile to stress that while in
India the share of U7, R2 and W in the West Eurasian-spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/26

cific mtDNAs mounts to nearly a third, in Iran it stays
below 15%.
Similarly to HV, TJ, N1, the spread of U7, W and R2 in
India is geographically uneven – the three haplogroups
are much more frequent in the northwestern states (SAA p
< 0.05, Figure 4). Together, they constitute nearly 14% of
the maternal gene pool in Indian Punjab, Gujarat and
Rajasthan. Their frequency is also high in Iran (13%) and
Pakistan (10%) but declines in Central Asia (5%).
Although haplogroup W is not highly frequent in European populations, it is nevertheless quite common [9],
reaching the highest frequencies among the central-northern Finns (9% [40]). Yet, it is virtually absent from the
Finno-Ugric speaking populations of the Volga basin [41].
In Central Asia the frequency of haplogroup W stays
below 2%.
Many European populations are lacking haplogroup U7
[9], but its frequency climbs over 4% in the Near East and
up to 5% in Pakistan, reaching nearly 10% level in Iranians (Table 9, see Additional file 4). In India, haplogroup
U7 frequency peaks at over 12% in Gujarat, in the westernmost state of India, while for the whole of India its frequency stays around 2%. Expansion times and haplotype
diversities for the Indian and Near and Middle Eastern U7
mtDNAs are strikingly similar (Table 4). The possible
homeland of this haplogroup spans likely in Gujarat and
Iran because from there its frequency declines steeply
both to the east and to the west. If the origin were in Iran
rather than in India, then its equally high frequency as
well as diversity in Gujarat favors a scenario whereby U7
has been introduced to the coastal western India either
very early, or by multiple founders. Notably, the overlap
of the Indian and Iranian lineages is largely restricted to
the ancestral nodes while the coalescence age estimates for
the nearly exclusively Indian (16207-16309-16318T) and
West Eurasian (16126-16309-16318T) founder HVS-I
motifs both yield time depths of about 20,000 to 30,000
ybp.
Haplogroup R2 appears at low frequencies in Near and
Middle East and India and is virtually absent elsewhere.
The spread of haplogroup R2 in Europe is restricted to a
few populations in the Volga basin where it is represented
by nodal haplotypes and by a region-specific subclade
characterized by the HVS-I motif 16037–16172 [41]. The
coalescence estimate of this sub-clade is 11,400 ± 9,000
ybp. However, its wide error range prevents us from drawing any firm conclusions.
To summarize, the West and South Asian phylogeography
of haplogroups W, U7 and R2 can be viewed as a genetic
continuum that spans from the Near East into India,

extending north into Central Asia. The coalescence times
of these haplogroups suggest that this continuum took
shape somewhere between 30,000 to 50,000 ybp (Table
4), thus falling within the climatically favorable interglacial period. We notice that the extant U7 and W frequencies along the proposed continuum are not uniform. U7
is more predominant in Iran, Pakistan, northwestern
India and the Arabian peninsula, while W is more
frequent in the western Near-East, Anatolia and the Caucasus. The coalescence ages of the Indian- and Iranianspecific U7 clades suggest that the time-window of this
continuum was closed by ca. 20,000 ybp. The inferred
extreme aridity of eastern Iran and western India during
the last glacial maximum, which is well documented in
paleovegetation reconstructions [42] may explain the
observed segregation.
It has been suggested that the Jews settled in southwest
India on the coast of the Arabian Sea sometime during the
early Middle Ages. However, the mtDNA pool of the
extant Cochin Jews is overwhelmingly Indian-specific
(Table 10, see Additional file 5). We found exact or close
matches to the fourteen HVS-I haplotypes observed
among the Cochin Jews in other Indian populations. It is
not clear whether the Near Eastern mtDNA lineages have
been lost or the initial Jewish settlers did not include
women.
Gene flow from East Eurasia
The East Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroups are less
common in India and more sharply geographically segregated than the haplogroups of western Eurasian ancestry
(Table 2; Figure 11, panel C). Indian caste populations
harbor only about 4% of such mtDNAs, compared to 17%
of the West Eurasian ones (Table 2). Elevated frequencies
of haplogroups common in eastern Eurasia are observed
in Bangladesh (17%) and Indian Kashmir (21%) and may
be explained by admixture with the adjacent populations
of Tibet and Myanmar (and possibly further east: from
China and perhaps Thailand). On the other hand, the
high frequencies of East Eurasian-specific mtDNAs found
in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu (21%) are
unexpected when considering their relatively low frequen-

cies (~1%) in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. We
notice, however, that the haplogroup assignments used
here for the Tamil Nadu sample (A4, B4, F1a and M7)
(Table 7, see Additional file 2) are based on HVS-I
sequences alone [29]. As shown and discussed elsewhere
[7], such type of assignment is prone to mistakes.
Two varieties of haplogroup M, D4c and G2a, were
recently identified as largely specific to Central Asia [43].
In spite of geographical proximity we did not find these
haplogroups in northern or northwestern India. Haplogroup G2a did, though in marginally low frequency, turn
up in Iran (CR: 0.1 – 1.6%) and in southern Indian states
Andhra Pradesh (CR: 0.3 – 2.9%) and Sri Lanka (CR: 0.2
– 4.1%).
Tibeto-Burman speaking tribal populations of eastern and
northern India exhibit the highest frequencies of East Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroups. As inferred from the
published HVS-I sequences [29], their share sums up to
approximately two thirds of mtDNAs among the tribal
groups in Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and
Tripura, (Table 8, see Additional file 3; Figure 11, panel
D). MtDNA haplogroups native to East Eurasia are also
highly frequent in the northern states of India, reaching a
peak of nearly 50% among the Kanet of Himachal
Pradesh. Papiha and colleagues have previously demonstrated through the typing of immunoglobin allotypes
that the Tibetan admixture among the regional Kanet
groups decreases as the distance from the Tibetan border
increases [44]. Thus, mtDNA data are consistent with an
ancestral origin of the Tibeto-Burman speaking tribal populations outside (east of) India in the neighboring Tibet
and Myanmar [30,45].
Haplotype sharing between populations
The majority (70%) of the 1136 mtDNA haplotypes
found among continental Indians (including Pakistan
and Bangladesh) are singletons and 41% of those that
occur more than once are restricted to a single population.
Only a few haplotypes are shared among five or more
populations.

Page 19 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genetics 2004, 5:26

The number of shared haplotypes between pairs of social,
linguistic and geographic groups of Indian populations is
slightly (but in most cases insignificantly) lower than that
between random groups of Indian populations taken for
reference (see Materials and Methods). Where the decline
of shared haplotypes is significant relative to the reference, it is most probably caused by large differences in the
sample sizes of the groups under comparison (Table 5).
An alternative method that assesses the degree of haplotype sharing between populations is to investigate the
combined frequency of the shared haplotypes in two population groups. Thus, amongst the northern and the
southern population groups the combined frequency of
the haplotypes present also in the other group is
significantly lower than that which we observed in the
case of random groups. This is not surprising because
West Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroups are rather
frequent in northwest India. Because the Indo-European
and the Dravidic speakers of India are largely concentrated to the northern and southern parts of the subcontinent, respectively, the differences arising from geographic
division of the Indian populations also correspond to
these linguistic groupings (Table 5).

Conclusions
Three Indian-specific haplogroups, M2, U2i and R5,
which encompass about 15% of the Indian mtDNA pool,
exhibit equally deep coalescence ages of about 50,000 –
70,000 years. Thus, their spread can be associated with the
initial peopling of South Asia.
Haplogroups U7, W and R2 harbor a number of similar
traits. Their overlapping geographic distributions and coalescence times suggest some degree of genetic continuum
in the area spanning from the Near and Middle East
through northwest India and reaching north into Central
Asia. The coalescence estimates for these haplogroups are
equally deep (around 30,000 – 50,000 years) in these different regions. That may be a result of either relatively
more recent albeit large in scale migrations that brought
along most of the diversity or may indeed reflect the
region-specific expansions of these haplogroups. The
former explanation could be ruled out since it is impossible to envisage a substantial movement of mtDNAs from
South Asia that would not include haplogroup M. The
same is true for the opposite – the share of U7, W and R2
within the West Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroups is
two-fold higher in India than it is in Iran. Moreover, the
South- and West Asian-specific sub-branches of haplogroup U7 predate the last glacial maximum. Therefore,
deep autochthonous history of these haplogroups in the
region remains to be the most parsimonious explanation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/26

Through the use of mtDNA coding region markers, we
were able to classify altogether a quarter of the Indian M
and R mtDNAs into a number of Indian-specific mtDNA
haplogroups, four of which we newly identified. Several
of these are characterized by clear patterns in their geographic distribution and/or different frequencies among
different socio-cultural groups of India. Additional efforts
should be undertaken to identify new coding region
markers in order to further improve the classification of
Indian mtDNAs. Indeed, much of the information is still
hidden by the poor resolution of the Indian mtDNA tree
and further piling of HVS-I datasets would add little to
deepen our understanding of the demographic history of
South and Southwest Asia.
We found that haplogroup M frequency drops abruptly
from about 60% in India to about 5% in Iran, marking the
western border of the haplogroup M distribution. A similarly sharp border cuts the distribution of Indian-specific
mtDNA haplogroups to the east and to the north of the
subcontinent. We therefore propose that the initial
mtDNA pool established upon the peopling of South Asia
has not been replaced but has rather been reshaped in situ
by major demographic episodes in the past and garnished
by relatively minor events of gene flow both from the
West and the East during more recent chapters of the
demographic history in the region.

Methods
Subjects
MtDNA sequence variation in a total of 796 Indian samples most of which are held in a collection at Newcastle
University [46] was analyzed. The samples cover a wide
geographical range that spans from Himachal Pradesh in
the north, Sri Lanka in the south, West Bengal in the east
and Gujarat in the west (Table 1).

Tribal populations constitute 15% of the total sample
size. The Lodha (n = 56) live mostly in the western part of
Midnapore district of West Bengal where they are also
known as Kheria or Kharia. Their total population size
was ~59000 according to the 1981 census. Their language
belongs to the Mundari branch of the Austro-Asiatic language family [47]. The Kanet (n = 37) make up two thirds
of the ~50000 inhabitants of the Kinnaur district in
Himachal Pradesh [48]. Their language belongs to the
Himalayan group of the Tibeto-Burman language family
[47]. Five Bhoksa and twenty-six Tharu individuals were
included in the present study in addition to those from
the same populations that we have previously reported
[13]. Most of the Tharu live in the Terai areas (a belt of
marshy land at the foot of the Himalayas) of Nepal (n =
720000). Approximately 96000 reside in Uttar Pradesh
and Uttaranchal, Indian states adjacent to Nepal. Around
32000 Bhoksas live in the lowland areas of Uttaranchal

The non-tribal Indian samples analyzed contained 105
West Bengalis of different caste rank, 58 Konkanastha
Brahmins from Bombay, 53 Gujaratis, 50 Moors and 82
Sinhalese from Sri Lanka, 109 Punjabis of different caste
rank from the Punjab, 25 Brahmins from Uttar Pradesh,
35 Rajputs from Rajasthan, 55 Parsees from Maharashtra
and 100 subjects from Cochin, Kerala (including 45 Jews
who have moved to Israel) (Table 1).
The Iranian sample of 436 individuals was collected in
different locations mainly from southwestern and northwestern Iran (Table 1).
The new Indian mtDNA sequence data was combined
with that previously published on Indian populations
[3,13,15,17,18,29,35,49-51] to produce a pooled dataset
(n = 2572) in which the tribal populations constitute
slightly over 50% (Table 6, see Additional file 1). By
including also the data on Iranian and published data on
Pakistani [13,27,29], Bangladeshi [29], Chinese [7,22,5254] and Thai [53,55,56] populations (n = 145, 29, 919
and 552, respectively), a dataset of over 4600 samples
spanning from West to East Asia (Table 6 and 7, see Additional files 1 and 2) was obtained. In many cases the
published data was reanalyzed. Analogy with the newly
obtained HVS-I motifs, that were classified into haplogroups using diagnostic markers of the mtDNA coding
region, served as basis for haplogroup assignments of the
published HVS-I sequences.

An even wider range of data was used for the production
of the isofrequency maps: the published data from Armenia (n = 192) [32] and Kyrgyz (n = 95) [57], and the
unpublished data from Yemen (n = 118), Oman (n = 79),
Saudi Arabia (n = 205), Ethiopia (n = 270), Uzbekistan (n
= 114) and Tajikistan (n = 41). Further details about the
mtDNA variation of these populations will be published
elsewhere.
MtDNA molecular analyses
DNA was extracted using standard phenol-chloroform
methods [58]. The hypervariable segment (HVS)-I
(between nucleotide positions (np) 16024–16400) of the
control region was sequenced in all the 796 Indian and
436 Iranian samples. Preparation of sequencing templates
was carried out following Kaessmann et al. [59]. Purified
products were sequenced with the DYEnamic™ ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed on ABI 377 DNA or Megabace2000
Sequencers. Sequences were aligned and analyzed with
the Wisconsin Package (GCG). In addition, informative
mtDNA coding region positions [3,11,27] were assayed
(Table 7, see Additional file 2) in selected individuals
from different HVS-I haplotypes to determine haplogroup
affiliations.
Data analysis
Median networks [60,61] were constructed using Network
3.111 and Network 2.10B programs [62] with default settings (r = 2; ε = 0). MtDNA coding region markers were
given five times the weight of the HVS-I positions.
Coalescence of mtDNA haplogroups and sub-haplogroups was calculated using ρ (the averaged distance to a

specified founder haplotype) and a mutation rate of one
transition per 20,180 years between nps 16090–16365
[63]. Standard errors for coalescence estimates and efficiency of a sample for coalescence time calculation (ρ/
nδ2) were calculated following [64]. Coalescence times
were further calculated with the exclusion of tribal populations sequences, yet preserving the cluster topology
(coalescence times marked with an asterisk). A more
intense genetic drift (particularly founder effects) could
introduce a bias into the coalescence time calculation (for
example, see below the coalescence time of haplogroup
M18 with and without the Lodha sample).

Haplotypes were defined as the HVS-I motif combined
with the haplogroup label for haplotype analysis. In this
way it was possible to discriminate between mtDNAs with
identical HVS-I motifs but otherwise known to belong to
different haplogroups (e.g. sequences with the CRS motif
in HVS-I belonging to haplogroups H or R). In order to
assess the results of haplotype sharing analysis between
population groups (e.g. tribal and caste populations) we
divided the Indian populations ten times randomly into
two sets and analyzed the level of haplotype sharing
between these sets.

Authors' contributions
The software kindly provided by Vincent Macaulay was
adopted in order to calculate the 95% credible regions
(CR) from the posterior distribution of the proportion of
a haplogroup/sub-haplogroup in the population.
Haplotype diversity was estimated as
k  n  n −1 
D = 1 − ∑ i =1  i   i
,
 n  n −1 

where n is the number of sequences, k the number of distinct haplotypes, and ni number of sequences with one
distinct haplotype.
Haplogroup isofrequency maps were generated using the
Kriging method in Surfer 7 program of Golden Software.
Haplogroup frequencies were averaged over populations
from the same state in India, provinces in China and Thailand and geographic divisions in Iran. The data points for
Kriging are shown as black dots, while the sample size
applicable to the data point is given adjacent to the dot. In
relatively small and isolated groups (e.g. tribal groups)
random genetic drift might seriously affect the haplogroup frequencies, which may become uninformative
when a whole region (e.g. state) is considered (e.g. M18
among the Lodha, see below). Therefore, the tribal data
were excluded from the haplogroup isofrequency maps
calculation. When illustrating the spread of mtDNA haplogroups native to West Eurasia, East Eurasia and India
(Figure 11, panel D) we present these data as pie diagrams. The respective sample size and origin are indicated
adjacent to the diagrams.
Spatial autocorrelation analysis was done using the PASSAGE software packet [65,66]. The correlograms of
Moran's I autocorrelation coefficient were calculated
using binary weight matrix with five distance classes. Data
on tribal populations was not used (see previous paragraph for explanation).
Haplogroup frequencies based admixture proportions
were calculated using the ADMIX 2.0 software [67].

SM and SSP collected most of the Indian samples (in
1970's) and have been keeping the collection in Newcastle University, United Kingdom. MM, TK, GH and KK carried out the RFLP analysis and mtDNA sequencing of the
majority of the Indian samples. EM, JP, PS and MK carried
out the RFLP analysis and mtDNA sequencing of the Iranian samples. DMB collected the DNA and analyzed
mtDNA variation amongst the Indian samples from
Cochin and the Cochin Jews collected (the latter) in Israel
under supervision of KS, who also contributed to the editing of the manuscript. AT provided some critical new
information and, in addition to KS, MTPG and PE,
engaged into valuable discussions during manuscript
preparation. MM did most of the phylogenetic analysis
and was in charge of manuscript writing while TK and RV
contributed significantly during both stages and were
responsible for conceiving and designing the study. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
