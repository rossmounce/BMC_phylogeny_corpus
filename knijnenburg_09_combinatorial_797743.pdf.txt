Abstract
Background: Microorganisms adapt their transcriptome by integrating multiple chemical and physical signals
from their environment. Shake-flask cultivation does not allow precise manipulation of individual culture
parameters and therefore precludes a quantitative analysis of the (combinatorial) influence of these parameters
on transcriptional regulation. Steady-state chemostat cultures, which do enable accurate control, measurement
and manipulation of individual cultivation parameters (e.g. specific growth rate, temperature, identity of the
growth-limiting nutrient) appear to provide a promising experimental platform for such a combinatorial analysis.
Results: A microarray compendium of 170 steady-state chemostat cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
is presented and analyzed. The 170 microarrays encompass 55 unique conditions, which can be characterized by
the combined settings of 10 different cultivation parameters. By applying a regression model to assess the impact
of (combinations of) cultivation parameters on the transcriptome, most S. cerevisiae genes were shown to be
influenced by multiple cultivation parameters, and in many cases by combinatorial effects of cultivation
parameters. The inclusion of these combinatorial effects in the regression model led to higher explained variance
of the gene expression patterns and resulted in higher function enrichment in subsequent analysis. We further
demonstrate the usefulness of the compendium and regression analysis for interpretation of shake-flask-based
transcriptome studies and for guiding functional analysis of (uncharacterized) genes and pathways.
Conclusion: Modeling the combinatorial effects of environmental parameters on the transcriptome is crucial for
understanding transcriptional regulation. Chemostat cultivation offers a powerful tool for such an approach.

Background
The transcriptional program of a cell is to a large extent
determined by its extracellular environment. Signaling
pathways, transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin
remodeling mediate the transcriptional response that enables the organism to adapt to changed conditions. In
order to understand the transcriptional response to
changes in the extracellular environment, a large majority
of the transcriptome analysis studies are based on the
comparison of a single "reference" condition against a different condition. Genes that show a different transcript
level between the two situations are often labeled "upregulated" or "downregulated" in the non-reference situation. This binary mode of analysis does not take into
account the fact that many genes are influenced by multiple environmental stimuli and regulated by multiple TFs.
The rate of transcription of a gene is, in general, the net
result of the integration of multiple inputs. Consequently,
transcriptional responses to individual environmental
stimuli may be strongly dependent on the experimental
context in which they are studied.
While the context dependency of transcriptional
responses has been acknowledged as an important factor
by several authors (e.g. [1,2]), it is only rarely considered
in experimental design and in data interpretation. Three
main reasons can be identified for this omission. First,
most transcriptome studies on micro-organisms are based
on shake-flask cultivation, in which key physiological
parameters such as the specific growth rate and nutrient
availability change continuously and cannot be adequately controlled. This makes it impossible to quantify
the context dependency of transcriptional responses. Secondly, research questions are often approached from a
one-dimensional perspective, in which differential gene
expression is completely attributed to the difference
between a condition of interest and a reference condition.
This strategy is implicitly incorporated into the two-channel microarray experimental design, where the ratio of
intensities from the channels represents the gene expression ratio between the condition of interest and the reference condition. A final factor that complicates meaningful
combinatorial analyses of transcriptional regulation is
that integration of data from different studies and laboratories may be hampered by differences in experimental
procedures for microarray experiments (including the use
of different microarray platforms, mRNA extraction, normalization and summarization algorithms [3,4]).
The "one-dimensional" design of transcriptome studies,
as outlined above, ignores combinatorial effects of growth
parameters, i.e., the possibility that repetition of the measurements in, for example, a different medium composition or temperature, might yield a different transcriptional
response to the same change in the parameter of interest.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

Recently, a relatively small number of studies have quantitatively explored the context dependency of transcriptional regulation in chemostat cultures of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5-8]. In steady-state chemostat
cultures, individual environmental parameters can be
manipulated in a controlled manner and at a fixed specific
growth rate [9,10]. This forms an important advantage
over the use of shake flasks and other batch cultivation
procedures, in which changes in environmental parameters affect specific growth rate, thus precluding the dissection of primary responses to environmental parameters
and indirect effects of a different specific growth rate.
Recent chemostat-based studies have demonstrated that,
indeed, specific growth rate itself has a strong effect on
transcriptional regulation in S. cerevisiae [8,11,12]. Additionally, chemostat experiments on combinatorial effects
of macronutrient limitation, oxygen availability and temperature provided compelling evidence for the impact of
context dependency [5,6,13].
The goal of the present study is to quantify the influence
of cultivation parameters on gene expression and specifically focus on the influence of combinatorial (or contextspecific) effects of the cultivation parameters. To this end,
we have compiled a microarray compendium of welldefined chemostat cultivations of yeast and employed a
computational framework to analyze the effect of the cultivation parameters on gene expression. The compendium
of chemostat-based transcriptome datasets is comprised
of 170 microarray measurements, which have been performed over the past years in the Kluyver Centre's yeast
research programme. These measurements, the majority
(111 out of 170) of which have been previously published
separately, encompass 55 unique growth conditions with
(mostly three) independent biological replicates for each
condition. Across the 55 different conditions, there are ten
varying cultivation parameters, such as growth-limiting
substrate, specific growth rate, aeration, pH and temperature. A forward step-wise regression model was designed
and applied to quantify the (combinatorial) effect of individual environmental parameters on transcriptional regulation. This strategy is based on the assumption that the
observed difference in the transcript level of a gene
between two microarrays can be fully attributed to the difference in environmental parameters (and measurement
noise) between these arrays. The results show that mainly
due to the accurate control and measurement of the
growth parameters enabled by steady-state chemostat cultivation, this assumption holds to a large degree. By
employing these results from the regression analysis, we
explore the significance of context dependency throughout the compendium. Its applicability for functional analysis of (uncharacterized) genes and pathways is
demonstrated using the inferred causal relationship
between environmental parameters and gene expression.

Results and discussion

levels of the gene UPC2 across all 55 conditions. The
lower part of this figure is a schematic representation of
the settings of the ten cultivation parameters over all conditions. Note that the expression levels are absolute
expression levels that come from a single-channel microarray system and not relative expression levels, where a
reference condition is employed. A regression model was
designed to assess the influence of the cultivation parameters on gene expression. The model was applied to all differentially expressed genes individually. (A large majority
(6005 of 6383) of the genes in the S. cerevisiae genome
was found to be differentially expressed in at least one of
the 55 conditions.) Using a step-wise approach, the
regression model iteratively selects significant predictors
in order to reconstruct the expression pattern of a gene.

This section starts by describing the steady-state chemostat microarray compendium and the regression analysis
to assess the influence of cultivation parameters on gene
expression. Then, the combinatorial effects of cultivation
parameters on the transcriptome are investigated using
enrichment tests and through biological interpretation of
these effects on genes of functional categories and biochemical pathways. To demonstrate the usefulness of the
compendium, this section concludes by presenting two
case studies concerned with, firstly, the functional analysis
of uncharacterized and dubious genes, and secondly, the
interpretation of shake-flask-based transcriptome studies
using the compendium.
Inferring the influence of cultivation parameters on gene
expression
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory reference strain
CEN.PK 113-7D (MATa) was grown at steady state in chemostat cultures under 55 different conditions. A condition can be characterized by a specific configuration of the
settings of ten different cultivation parameters. One of
these cultivation parameters is the available carbon
source. Throughout the compendium five different carbon sources were used, i.e. acetate, ethanol, galactose, glucose and maltose. Thus, these five compounds form the
settings that the cultivation parameter carbon source can
assume. Table 1 provides an overview of the settings for all
cultivation parameters. Figure 1 depicts the expression

Here, the cultivation parameters form the predictors. We
incorporated single effects and two types of combinatorial
effects. See Figure 2 for a schematic example of genes that
are influenced by these effects. A single effect is constituted by one setting of one cultivation parameter. For
example, limiting element carbon is a predictor. (This will
be a significant predictor for genes, which show differential expression between carbon-limited growth and
growth that is limited by the residual quantity of other
substrates.) In Figure 2 gene g1 responds solely to a single
effect. The first type of combinatorial effect is constituted
by applying the logic AND function between two settings
of two different cultivation parameters. For example, lim-

Figure 1
Expression levels of UPC2 across the 55 cultivation conditions
Expression levels of UPC2 across the 55 cultivation conditions. The colored matrix is a schematic representation of
the settings of the ten cultivation parameters over the 55 conditions. The colored lanes indicate the cultivation parameters that
are employed to order the experiments, in this case, aeration type and limiting element. The applied regression model was able
to explain 71% of the variance in the expression of this gene. The model selected one significant single effect, i.e. aeration type,
and two significant combinatorial effects, i.e. aeration type anaerobic together with limiting element zinc and the usage of proline or asparagine as nitrogen source. The reconstructed expression pattern based on these three effects is indicated by the
shaded area.

iting element carbon AND aerobic growth (in short: aerobic carbon-limited growth) form such a combinatorial
effect. Of course, the cell's transcriptome and metabolome
are known to respond in a combinatorial fashion to particular environmental conditions or parameters. That is,
the simultaneous presence of certain environmental factors results in a transcriptional and metabolic state that is
not a simple aggregation of the states reached based on
the single presence of one of these factors. For example,
when glucose is present, it is utilized in different ways by
S. cerevisiae, depending on the presence of oxygen. Including these AND effects enables the systematic investigation
of the influence of combinations of cultivation parameters on gene expression. Gene g2 in Figure 2 responds to
an AND effect. The second type of combinatorial effect is
constituted by applying the logic OR function on two different settings within the same cultivation parameter.
Here, carbon-limited OR iron-limited growth forms an
example.

This effect is included, because we expect that closely
related settings within a cultivation parameter, e.g. similar
carbon sources, will have a similar effect on gene expression. Gene g3 in Figure 2 responds to an OR effect. In the
case of UPC2 (Figure 1), the regression model successively
selected the single effect aeration type, the AND combinatorial effect anaerobic zinc-limited growth and the OR
combinatorial effect nitrogen source proline or asparagine. (Note that cultivation parameter aeration type can
assume only two settings, i.e. aerobic growth and anaerobic growth. Since these two predictors are mutually redundant, only one of them (aerobic growth) is included as a
predictor in the regression model and labeled as aeration
type. A positive regression coefficient for aeration type
indicates that the gene is more highly expressed under aerobic conditions; a negative coefficient indicates the
reverse scenario.) The regression model keeps on adding
cultivation parameters as predictors, until no further significant improvement can be made. For example, for g4 in

Schematic representation of the normalized expression patterns of genes affected by a single effect, combinatorial effect or a mixture of these. In this example there are two cultivation parameters, A and B, which can assume two
and five different values, respectively. Genes g1, g2 and g3 are affected by a single effect, AND effect and OR effect, respectively. The expression of genes g4 and g5 is constituted by the influence of both a single effect and a combinatorial effect.

the combinatorial effect A+&Bi. See Methods section for
details.
The expression of many genes responds to combinatorial
effects
For most genes the regression model was able to explain
60 to 80% of the variance, which is present in their expres-

sion patterns across the 55 conditions. See Figure 3a. The
amount of explained variance does not depend that much
on the average expression level of a gene, although there
is a steady increase in explained variance with increasing
average expression level. Much more important is the
degree to which a gene is differentially expressed. The Fstatistic, i.e. the ratio between the variance of the average
expression levels across the 55 conditions and the average

replicate variance across these conditions, is strongly correlated with the degree to which the gene's expression pattern can be reconstructed. The expression levels of genes
with small F-statistics are obscured by measurement noise
and do not differ significantly between the growth conditions. Also not surprisingly, when more significant cultivation parameters are selected by the regression model,
more of the variance of the gene can be explained. Figure
3b, c outlines which and how many cultivation parameters were selected to reconstruct the expression patterns of
all genes. On average, a gene is influenced by 1.25 (Â±
1.18) single effects, 1.73 (Â± 1.43) AND effects and 1.01 (Â±
1.04) OR effects. The limiting element, aeration type and
protocol (which is dealt with in more detail below) are
the most prominent factors that influence gene expression
behavior. Here it should be noted that the setup of the cultivation parameters in the compendium is not fully combinatorial, i.e. not all possible combinations of
cultivation parameters are present in the dataset. For
example, across the 55 conditions, 53 have been cultivated under pH 5, while only a single condition was performed with a lower pH (3.5) and similarly for a higher
pH (6.5), thereby precluding combinatorial effects
between the higher or lower pH and other environmental
parameters. Thus, the numbers of genes, which are influ-

enced by a particular cultivation parameter (as visualized
in Figure 3c), are biased by the number of different settings of the cultivation parameters and the number of
combinations of cultivation parameters present in the
compendium. Anyhow, the results indicate that the
expression of many genes is influenced, not only independently by particular cultivation parameters, but also in
a combinatorial fashion, i.e. there are many combinatorial effects between cultivation parameters that affect gene
expression behavior.
The regression analysis was repeated using only the single
effects as predictors. For most genes this resulted in a
lower percentage of explained variance. See Figure 4a. Of
course, this result could be expected based on the fact that
many combinatorial effects were selected as significant
predictors in the original regression model. Subsequent
enrichment analysis provided additional evidence for
combinatorial regulation. Genes, of which their expression levels are manipulated by a particular single effect or
combinatorial effect, were grouped and checked for functional overrepresentation. Additional File 1 provides an
overview of all enrichment analysis results. It reveals the
many cases (> 1000) in which a particular combination of
environmental parameters leads to the up- or downregu-

lation of a group of functionally related genes. Also, functional enrichment was compared between the regression
analysis including both single and combinatorial effects
and the analysis including only single effects. Genes were
clustered based on their reconstructed expression patterns
that were obtained for both regression models and these
clusters were evaluated for enrichment in functional
annotation categories. Figure 4b shows that the inclusion
of the combinatorial effects leads to increased functional
enrichment, and thus further substantiates the existence
of the combinatorial influence of the presence of environmental factors and the importance of modeling them.
Additional File 2 describes the complete comparison
between the regression models including and excluding
the combinatorial effects.
The sample preparation protocol has a large impact on
the measured gene expression levels
As indicated in Table 1 and Figure 1 the tenth cultivation
parameter is termed "Protocol". Unlike the nine other
parameters, "Protocol" is not directly related to the cultivation conditions under which yeast is grown, but refers
to the protocol to process RNA samples. Several years ago,
an improved sample preparation kit was introduced [14].
This kit obviated the need for the expensive and time-consuming poly-A mRNA purification step included in the
original procedure. The decision to omit the purification
step, which was also made in other yeast research groups,
was supported by information indicating that samples
prepared with or without this step were similar [15]. Thus,
two different protocols were used to generate the chemostat compendium's samples for microarray hybridization:
Protocol A and Protocol B. The main difference between
these protocols is that Protocol A includes the polyAmRNA isolation step (with cDNA synthesis being performed on purified mRNA), while Protocol B excludes the
purification step (with cDNA synthesis being performed
on total RNA). (The Methods section and Additional File
3 provide the complete details on both protocols.)

As apparent from Figure 3c, the measured transcript levels
of many genes appeared to be influenced by the protocol.
Enrichment analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of characterized genes amongst the genes that have
higher apparent transcript levels under protocol B; all
three GO root-categories (biological process, cellular
component and molecular function) were highly
enriched. On the other hand, significantly many uncharacterized genes yielded higher apparent transcript levels
under protocol A. Further investigation revealed a trend
between transcript level and protocol influence: Genes
with higher average expression level tended to yield a
higher transcript level in protocol B and genes with a
lower average transcript level tended to yield lower transcript levels under protocol B (Figure 5). In general,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

uncharacterized genes have a lower expression than characterized genes, which explains the results from the
enrichment analysis. Further evidence for this hypothesis
is found when analyzing the genes that encode ribosomal
proteins (RP genes), whose mRNA's are highly abundant.
Again, significantly many RP genes exhibit higher expression when analyzed with protocol B (middle and bottom
plots in Figure 5).
The relationship between mRNA abundance (expression
level) and protocol is only weak and does not hold for
each gene individually. It may, for example, be influenced
by the average length of the polyA-tail of different transcripts. Indeed, analysis of mitochondrial genes lacking a
poly-A tail demonstrated a large influence of the protocol.
Of the 52 transcripts on the microarray representing mitochondrial genes, 27 (amongst which 16 unique mitochondrial genes) were influenced by the protocol, i.e. the
regression model selected the protocol as a significant predictor of the expression pattern of these genes. All these 27
mitochondrial genes showed a higher (apparent) transcript level under protocol B. These results illustrate that
not only different microarray platforms, labs, and strains,
but also the hybridization preparation steps can affect the
outcome of microarray analyses. This strongly underlines
previous warnings on the challenges involved in comparing microarray results from different experiments.
The chemostat compendium allows us to adequately
model the influence of the hybridization protocol on
expression. In particular, the compendium contains 18
growth conditions (9 sets of two), where the only differing cultivation parameter is the protocol setting: The
growth conditions were identical in these nine cases, only
the protocol was different. This provides extra statistical
power in the regression procedure and enables us to successfully model the protocol effect. This allows us analyze
the influence of the environmental cultivation parameters
without interference of the protocol's confounding effect.
Functional categories are specifically associated with
combinations of environmental parameters
Many functional categories are specifically influenced by
a combinatorial effect. Many genes within such a category
are influenced by a combinatorial effect, whereas none or
only a few genes are affected by the single effects that constitute this combinatorial effect. See Methods section for
these details. This analysis was performed on all MIPS categories. In total 153 significant combinatorial effect-MIPS
category pairs were identified. These are depicted in Additional File 4. Here, we focus on the biological interpretation of two such combinatorial effects: Carbon source
acetate OR ethanol, and, Limiting element phosphorus
OR Sulfur. See Table 2.

blocks can be derived from glycolysis, the tricarboxylic
acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, while during growth on C2-compounds, gluconeogenesis and the
glyoxylate cycle are essential for the provision of some of
these precursors. Furthermore, the higher ATP requirement for biosynthesis during growth on the C2-compounds implies that, at a fixed specific growth rate,
dissimilatory fluxes have to be higher with the C2-compounds than with a sugar as the sole carbon source. This
is supported by the significant shared influence of the C2
carbon sources on the genes of gluconeogenesis and the
tricarboxylic acid pathway.

The influence of the protocol on gene expression
The influence of the protocol on gene expression. All
genes that are affected by the modifications to the protocol,
either as a single effect or as an interaction effect, are analyzed. First, the mean expression levels of these genes across
all 55 conditions are computed. The genes are divived in
seven groups based on their mean expression levels such
that each group holds the same amount (i.e. 14,3%) of the
genes. Each group is characterized by a lower and a higher
bound on the expression value; these two numbers represent the range of the mean expression levels of the genes
within the group. Also, we dichotomize the genes into the
ones with positive regression weights (i.e. upregulation under
Protocol B with respect to Protocol A) and the ones with
negative regression weights. a: The blue bars indicate the
percentage of genes with positive regression weights (higher
under Protocol B) across these groups (or expression
ranges). Similarly, the red bars indicate these percentages for
the genes with negative coefficients (higher under Protocol
A). b, c: For the same ranges, each bar represents the percentage of genes in the range annotated to a particular functional category over all of the genes that are annotated with
this category and affected by the protocol.

The first example is provided by the OR effect of carbon
sources ethanol and acetate on metabolism and energy
household. These C2-compounds share a drastically different impact on central metabolism when compared to
using the sugars glucose, maltose and galactose as carbon
source. During growth on sugars, all metabolic building

Besides this and other examples that can be easily
explained by current knowledge, there are also many
interactions that might represent as of yet unknown regulatory mechanisms. For example, we find that the limiting
elements sulfur and phosphorus have a similar effect (i.e.
OR effect) on transcription regulation genes. A close
inspection of the genes influenced by this OR effect
revealed the presence of five genes encoding subunits of
Mediator (MED3/PGD1 (complex tail), MED7 and
MED10/NUT2 (middle), MED11 and MED18/SRB5
(head)), an evolutionarily conserved coregulator of RNA
polymerase II [16] and nine genes encoding chromatin
remodeling enzymes (ARP7, GCN5, HST2, RIF1, RSC6,
RVB2, SFH1, SNF6 and SPT8). In eukaryotes, gene transcriptional regulation depends on a complex interplay
between signal transduction, specific and general gene
regulators and complexes that modify chromatin and
RNA polymerase II. Under sulfur limitation S. cerevisiae
adapts its transcriptome in order to reduce the expression
of sulfur rich genes and proteins [17,18]. This response is
mediated by Met4 the main sulfur metabolism regulator.
The transcriptional changes upon phosphate limitation
are mainly related to high affinity phosphate transport,
phosphate assimilation and polyphosphate metabolism
[5,18]. Although S. cerevisiae requires the transcription of
different specific genes under sulfur or phosphate limitations, it is tempting to speculate that the mechanisms that
govern the transcription control of these specific sets of
genes are shared and depend on shared mechanisms
involving specific subunits of the Mediator complex. Such
high degree of specificity was demonstrated with the
implication of Med2 (a Mediator tail subunit) in the regulation of the low iron response regulon [16].
Combinatorial regulation within biochemical pathways
provides further insight into sulfur metabolism and
scavenging
As demonstrated above, we can assess whether groups of
genes are influenced by particular (combinations of) environmental parameters using enrichment tests. This opens
up the interesting possibility to correlate new and previously known patterns of regulation of individual genes

with the regulation of larger families of genes connected
to each other in pathways. In contrast to other gene
groups, in a metabolic pathway clear connections exist
between the gene products and their functions, which
allows for more in-depth analysis. Here, we focus on biochemical pathways as described in SGD, which depict the
series of chemical reactions converting metabolites, and
the enzymes catalyzing these reactions. Enrichment analysis indicated that 5 of the 9 downloaded 'SGD superpathways' were influenced by at least one significant
combinatorial effect (at p < 10-3, q < 0.08).
An illustrative example is presented by analyzing the
expression profiles of the gene family involved in sulfurand sulfur containing amino acid-metabolism in yeast
(Figure 6). Sulfur amino acid biosynthesis involves a considerable number of enzymes required for the de novo
biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine and the recycling
of organic sulfur metabolites. Expression of the genes
encoding the enzymes for this metabolic network is
tightly controlled by the available sulfur source, through
modulation of the intracellular S-adenosyl-methionine
levels. Six different cultivation parameters were significantly often selected to explain the expression patterns of
the genes in this pathway (p < 10-3). Five of these are combinatorial cultivation parameters. Not surprisingly, the
only single effect is sulfur limitation, which causes the
upregulation of ten out of the eighteen genes [19]. See box
1 of the bars near the enzyme names in Figure 6. Despite
large variations in expression under different combina-

tions of conditions, many of the MET-, CYS-, SAM- and
HOM -genes invariably respond to the presence of
methionine in the growth medium by clearly reduced
expression. See Figure 7, which depicts the normalized
gene expression patterns of all genes of the pathway. This
response is independent of the presence of oxygen or
growth limitation by carbon or nitrogen sources. Only in
the case where methionine is utilized both as sulfur and
nitrogen source and methionine is the limiting element,
we observe that the expression of the corresponding genes
is not reduced (but even slightly induced, mimicking the
(known) response under sulfur limitation). This explains
the selection of the combinatorial effects involving
methionine depicted by boxes 4, 5 and 6 in Figure 6.
Interestingly, two genes involved in this sulfur-metabolizing network in part respond differently. HOM2, which is
involved in homoserine biosynthesis, responds reciprocally to the availability of methionine in the growth
medium compared to the other HOM genes, especially
under aerobic conditions. The same observation is made
for STR2, which is involved in cystathionine biosynthesis.
(In Figure 7 magenta boxes mark the conditions, where
methionine is part of the growth medium.) This discrepancy is indicative of a differential regulatory mechanism
operating between the HOM2, HOM3 and HOM6 genes
of the homoserine pathway, and of the complex regulation of the transsulfuration pathway, involving CYS3,
CYS4, STR2 and STR3. Further detailed analysis would be
required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms operat-

ing in these differential combinatorial controls. Such differential controls operating within a pathway are likely to
be involved in intricate flux balancing mechanisms.
Surprisingly, for many of the genes in the pathway under
investigation expression levels under zinc limitation are
almost as high as under sulfur limitation, especially under
aerobic conditions. Moreover, the genes of the transsulfuration pathway are highly expressed under zinc and sulfur
limitation, yet lower expressed under the other nutrient
limitations. Also here, STR2 responds reciprocally and is
lower expressed under zinc limitation. Although transcript levels per se cannot be used as flux indicators, this
expression behavior is consistent with an upregulation of
the flux towards cysteine under zinc limitation via the
increased synthesis of the corresponding enzymes. (See
the graph structure of the pathway near cysteine in Figure
6.) The exact nature of this response is not immediately
apparent. However, it provides an interesting hypothesis
on the oxidative stress response of S. cerevisiae under zinc
limitation. As previously described [20], a "first line of
defense" in oxidative stress response is formed by the
superoxide dismutase genes SOD1 and SOD2, which are
induced under aerobic conditions. See Figure 7. The
dithiol glutaredoxin genes GRX1 and GRX2 [21], and the
monothiol glutaredoxin genes GRX3 -GRX5 [22], which
also participate in the response against oxidative stress,
exhibit highly differential transcriptional profiles.
This may provide new insight into the specific roles for
each of the varying combinations of glutaredoxins under
different growth conditions. Surprisingly, under zinc limitation not only the Cu, Zn-dependent SOD1 gene is
lower expressed; also the SOD2 gene, encoding the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, which is dependent on
Mn and not on Zn, is much less induced. A boost in glutathione synthesis apparently takes over the main defense,
since the glutathione synthase genes GSH1 and GSH2 are
clearly induced, especially under zinc-limited aerobic conditions. This can be seen from the magenta ellipses in Figure 7. This fits with the fact that significantly many genes
in the sulfur scavenging pathway are upregulated under
zinc-limited aerobic growth, presumably leading to an
induced cysteine pool, cysteine being one of the three
components of the tripeptide glutathione.
Functional characterization of uncharacterized and
dubious genes using the chemostat compendium
In a recent review [23] it was pointed out that many (>
1000) genes in the yeast genome are still uncharacterized.
Possible reasons for this include genetic redundancy, lack
of strong growth phenotype and the possibility that not
all of them are real genes. Additionally, genes may be
involved in environmental and metabolic responses,
which are normally not queried in the lab. Concerning the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

"characterized" genes, it can be noted that the function of
many annotated genes is derived from large-scale studies,
and hence, in-depth detailed analysis is lacking for these
genes.
We conjecture that the visualization of the expression
behavior of a gene over the conditions of the compendium, together with the identification of the significant
cultivation parameters to which the gene responds, provides valuable information regarding gene function. With
this information, one can design directed biological
experiments or assays that probe a specific pathway or
activity in order to advance towards the functional characterization of a gene. We mapped our regression results to
SGD's genome snapshot, upon which the division of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF's into verified ORF's, uncharacterized ORF'S and dubious ORF's in [23] was based. For
1350 genes the regression model lead to a good reconstruction of the observed expression pattern (explained
variance including replicate variance > 70%). According
to SGD, 1009 of these genes were verified ORF's; 286 were
uncharacterized and 54 were classified as dubious genes.
Amongst the uncharacterized genes, many genes were
found to be expressed under conditions which have not
been extensively studied before. For example, amongst the
286 uncharacterized genes, five genes are most significantly influenced by zinc limitation, i.e. zinc limitation
was the first condition selected by the regression model.
One of these, YOR387C, is only expressed under zinc limitation. These results immediately link the function of a
gene to a particular cultivation parameter or a specific biological process related to this cultivation parameter. The
expression pattern of these five zinc responsive genes as
well as the other genes to be discussed in this section are
visualized in Figure 8. Also, amongst the 54 dubious
genes, there are many genes that are highly expressed
under one or a few cultivation parameters, while having a
constant expression over the remaining conditions. For
example, YJL119C is only highly expressed under phosphorus limitation. YBL070C also responds to phosphorus
limitation, yet particularly when the yeast is grown aerobically. The expression of YBR292C is influenced by aerobic sulfur-limited growth and YBL065W is only expressed
when grown at a low temperature (12Â°C). 35 of the 54
dubious genes were affected by the aeration effect or the
interaction effect between carbon limitation and aeration.
These genes were screened against a recent proteomics
study, where expression data of yeast grown in aerobic
and anaerobic carbon-limited chemostats was measured
[24]. We found that for three genes unique peptides were
quantified. This establishes the existence of the proteins
encoded by these "dubious" genes. See Additional File 5
for a list of the 54 dubious genes and details on the peptide identification. Notably, 51 of the 54 dubious genes
are no longer present on YG 2.0, the successor of the

these genes do have a functional role, at least in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that was used in this study.

Analysis of shake-flask experiments with the chemostat
compendium
Changes in the extracellular environment or perturbations on genetic level do not only affect (signaling) pathways in which the change or perturbation has direct
involvement, but can also impact the cell's viability,
metabolism or other processes in the cell. For example,
there are many experimental conditions and genetic perturbations that will impact the growth rate of the cell. For
shake flask cultivations it is not possible to distinguish

between the direct and indirect effects, since cultivation
parameters like growth rate and nutrient availability cannot be controlled. This also confounds the analysis of
gene expression data from shake flask experiments [11].
By screening a group of genes, which were grouped
together on the basis of shake flask experiments, against
the compendium, some of the confounding effects can be
resolved. The group can be subdivided into clusters of
genes that respond to particular environmental parameters within the compendium and thereby identify the cultivation parameters or biological processes that could
have played a role in the original shake flask experiment,
even when these have not been measured.
To this end, we apply the following strategy: First, we
select the (combinatorial) cultivation parameters that are
significant for the group under investigation. These are the
cultivation parameters that are significantly often selected

by the regression model to explain the expression pattern
of the genes in the group when compared to the complete
genome. Next, the genes are clustered based on the normalized regression coefficients under these cultivation
parameters. Finally, these newly obtained clusters are consulted for enrichment of annotation categories. See Methods section for details. As an example, Figure 9 depicts the
results of this analysis for the groups of genes, which were
found to be induced or repressed in a dig1Î, dig2Î mutant
strain grown in a shake-flask [27]. To make the induced
and the repressed gene groups, we consulted the gene
expression data of this study (i.e. the Hughes et al. yeast
mutant microarray compendium [27]). The induced
group is formed by all genes that are upregulated by one
fold-change or more in the dig1Î, dig2Î mutant strain
compared to the wild-type strain. The repressed group is
formed in a similar fashion by identifying the genes that
are downregulated by one fold-change or more.

The results show a clear difference between direct and
indirect effects. On the one hand, the enrichment analysis
on the TF binding data tells us that the genes in Clusters
3, 4 and 5 form a significantly large part of Dig1's regulon,
i.e. the direct targets of TF Dig1. The known role of Dig1
and Dig2 in regulating mating-specific and pheromoneresponsive genes is confirmed by the enrichment of these
functional categories in Cluster 3. Also, binding sites of
TFs Tec1 and Ste12, which together with Dig1 form a regulatory complex involved in mating and filamentation
[28], are enriched for Cluster 5 and Clusters 3 and 5,
respectively. Interestingly, the genes within Clusters 3, 4
and 5 were clustered together based on their response to
the addition of organic acids propionate, benzoate and
sorbate. (The clusters are characterized by the shared transcriptional response of their genes to these acids.) On the
other hand, a large set of genes that is induced after the
knockout of DIG1 and functionally redundant DIG2, is
affected by growth rate in the chemostat microarray compendium. See Clusters 1, 6 and 10. The genes of Cluster 1
show high enrichment for metabolism and energy func-

tional categories as well as for general stress response TF
Msn2. From this observation we conclude that besides the
genes that are directly affected, the double knockout also
has a large impact on the metabolism and energy household of the cell when grown in a shake-flask.

Conclusion
The compendium of chemostat-based transcriptome data
is a valuable resource for yeast systems biology that can be
queried on-line. Additional File 6 contains the complete
dataset (expression data and description of the cultivation
conditions). Additional File 7 is an interactive tool to visualize the gene expression across all conditions in the
compendium; this file can be downloaded from the
author's website. Using a forward step-wise regression
strategy, we were able to quantify the influence of (combinatorial) cultivation parameters on the expression of
genes and (using enrichment tests) groups of functionally
related genes. The regression results demonstrate the large
extent to which regulation of individual genes results
from the integration of multiple external signals. In fact,

the analysis yielded only few "signature transcripts", i.e.
transcripts whose level showed a unique up- or downregulation under a single condition in the compendium relative to all other conditions. This observation has
important implications for the applicability of so-called
signature transcripts to diagnose cellular status (e.g. starvation for a nutrient, stress or, in higher organisms, disease). Our results indicate that the "signature" status of a
gene with respect to an individual environmental parameter can depend strongly on other ("background") environmental signals to which the cell is exposed. In this
respect, it should be stressed that the current compendium of chemostat-based data represents only a minute
fraction of the infinite range of combinatorial conditions
to which yeast cells can be exposed in nature, in industry
and in the laboratory.

ously been labeled as 'dubious' and have even been
removed from some commercial DNA microarrays, exhibited a specific and reproducible transcriptional response
to some of the investigated culture conditions. These
examples illustrate the potential for enabling more
focused functional analysis studies through a correlation
of a wide range of cultivation conditions and gene expression data. The results provide a strong incentive for further
extending the range of cultivation conditions included in
the compendium.
The systematic dissection of the impact of (combinations
of) individual culture parameters on transcriptional regulation enabled by chemostat-based microarray analysis
can be applied to interpret transcriptome data generated
in less extensively controlled, but highly relevant cultivation conditions in industry and in the laboratory. This is
exemplified by the additional interpretation of previously
published data from shake-flask-based transcriptome
analysis of a dig1Î, dig2Î mutant (Figure 9).

The relevance of the proposed approach for functional
analysis of genes and pathways is exemplified by the
observed combinatorial effects of zinc and sulfur availability in the pathway of sulfur amino acid biosynthesis.
Furthermore, the compendium approach has provided
clear indications that 54 S. cerevisiae genes that had previ-

extend the compendium with data from other research
groups, provided that yeast strain, cultivation procedures
and procedures for microarray analysis are rigorously
standardized. The effect of a change in the mRNA processing protocol, as identified in the regression strategy, provides a clear caveat on the possible impact of even small
differences in experimental procedures.
One promising avenue to be explored is the use of the
compendium in deriving transcriptional regulation networks. Given that changes in gene expression can be
ascribed to changes in the activity of TFs and chromatin
remodeling proteins, the compendium dataset provides
the means to investigate how cultivation parameters influence the activity of the proteins that control transcription.
Since the cultivation parameters, such as the employed
carbon source, are closely linked to the actual molecular
signals that are detected by the cell, it may be possible to
also relate transporters and signaling cascades to the
observed expression under different environmental conditions. This allows for a genome-wide analysis of the
complete chain of regulatory relationships that cause
changes in the extracellular environment to lead to
changes in gene expression.
In the employed regression model, the (combinatorial)
cultivation parameters are assumed to have an additive
effect on gene expression. In previous work [6] the aeration type was modeled as a linear effect with both additive
and multiplicative components. This approach was not
possible for the cultivation parameters within the current
framework. Furthermore, a more complex modeling or
incorporation of higher-order effects results in a highly
under-determined system and possible computational
complexity issues. Given the high-degree of non-linearity
in biological systems, the application of logic (Boolean)
functions might provide a sensible alternative to the commonly used linear modeling. Irrespective of the structure
of the models, incorporating combinatorial effects in
models for (transcriptional) regulation is crucial. Only in
this way, the goal of systems biology to investigate and
understand the interactions between different components and/or levels in biological systems can be complemented by an equally integrative approach towards the
complex environmental context in which cells grow and

Chemostat cultivation and microarray data
Prototrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK1137D (MATa) [30] was grown at 30Â°C (or at 12Â°C) in 2-liter
chemostats (Applikon) with a working volume of 1.0 liter
as described in van den Berg et al. [31]. Cultures were fed
with a defined mineral medium that limited growth by
either carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc or iron

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

with all other growth requirements in excess and at a constant residual concentration. The dilution rate ranged
from 0.03 to 0.2 h-1. The pH was measured online and
kept constant at 5.0 (or 3.5 and 6.5) by the automatic
addition of 2 M KOH using an Applikon ADI 1030 bio
controller. Stirrer speed was 800 rpm, and the airflow was
500 ml min-1. Dissolved oxygen tension was measured
online with an Ingold model 34-100-3002 probe and was
above 50% of air saturation. The off-gas was cooled by a
condenser connected to a cryostat set at 2Â°C, and oxygen
and carbon dioxide were measured offline with an ADC
7000 gas analyzer. When required, anaerobic conditions
were maintained by sparging the medium reservoir and
the fermentor with pure nitrogen gas (500 ml min-1). Furthermore, Norprene tubing and butyl septa were used to
minimize oxygen diffusion into the anaerobic cultures
[32].
Steady-state samples were taken after ~10â14 volume
changes to avoid strain adaptation due to long term cultivation [33]. Dry weight, metabolite, dissolved oxygen and
gas profiles had to be constant over at least 3 volume
changes before sampling for RNA extraction. The detailed
culture media recipes, used in the 55 different conditions
presented in this study, can be retrieved from the individual GEO [34] array reports. The GEO accession numbers
can be found in Additional File 6.
In this study, two different sample preparation protocols
were employed: Protocol A (for 36 of the 55 conditions)
and Protocol B (for 19 of the 55). For Protocol A, sampling of the chemostat cultures, probe preparation and
hybridization to the single-channel Affymetrix GeneChip
YG S98 microarrays is described in Piper et al. [29]. Protocol B has the following modifications with respect to Protocol A: In stead of harvesting ~700 Î¼g of total RNA and
applying a Poly-A mRNA isolation step before cDNA synthesis (Protocol A), ~15 Î¼g of total RNA is harvested and
the purification step is omitted (Protocol B). Thus, in Protocol B cDNA synthesis is performed on total RNA, while
in Protocol A the synthesis is performed on Poly-A purified mRNA. Additional File 3 provides the complete
details on both protocols and references to the used
AffyMetrix manuals.
Across the 55 conditions, ten different varying cultivation
parameters can be identified. A cultivation parameter, e.g.
the carbon source, is described as a categorical variable
and contains two or more settings, e.g. the used carbon
source can be either acetate, ethanol, galactose, glucose or
maltose. Each condition is characterized by a configuration of these settings across the ten cultivation parameters.
See Figure 1, Table 1 and Additional File 6 for an overview
of the relevant settings within the environmental parameters per condition. In total, 180 microarray measurements

Page 15 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:53

were performed. There is a variable number of independent biological replicates per condition, however for most
(39) conditions three replicates were performed. Chip
quality control, condensing probe intensities to gene
expression levels and normalization was performed using
GeneData Refiner Array [35]. 170 high quality chips, i.e.
gradient severity â¤ 0.165, defective area â¤ 0.5% and outlier
area â¤ 0.59%, were retained. Ten chips, which did not
meet these criteria were dismissed. The RMA algorithm
was used to derive the log scale measure of the expression
levels [36]. Quantile normalization was applied to normalize between arrays [37]. The normalized expression
data is given in Additional File 6. The raw array data used
in this study can be retrieved at Genome Expression
Omnibus [34] with series number GSE11452.
Detecting differential expression
A gene was called differentially expressed when 1) the
gene was present in at least one of the arrays (present call
p-value < 0.05) and 2) the gene showed significant differential expression in at least one condition (one-way
ANOVA with 55 classes, p-value < 0.05/9335). 9335 is the
total number of transcripts on the array.
Inferring the influence of cultivation parameters on gene
expression using regression
A designmatrix was created, containing both main (or single) effects and interaction (or combinatorial) effects:
Each setting within each cultivation parameter is represented by a binary indicator column with 170 entries.
These columns represent the main effects, which indicate
for each array whether the yeast was grown under the relevant setting of a particular cultivation parameter. Two
types of combinatorial effects were included in the model,
i.e. "AND" and "OR" effects. The AND interaction effect
columns were obtained by applying the logical AND function to all possible pair-wise combinations of main effect
columns. The OR interaction effect columns were obtaining by applying the logical OR function to all possible
pair-wise combinations of main effect columns that are
associated with the same cultivation parameter. Thus,
only OR effects that are constituted of two settings within
the same cultivation parameter were modeled. Redundant
columns and columns with all zeros were removed. This
resulted in the binary [170 Ã 227] designmatrix D, which
includes 38 single effects, 101 AND effects and 88 OR
effects. A visualization of this matrix is found in Additional File 8.

A forward step-wise ordinary least squares regression strategy was applied to each gene individually:
y = XÎ² + Îµ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

Here, yi denotes the measured gene expression level of a
particular gene for array i, with i = 1, . . ., 170; X is the predictor matrix, Î² represents the regression coefficients and
Îµ the error, which is assumed to be independent zeromean normally distributed. Initially, X contains only the
intercept, i.e. a column of 170 ones. In an iterative fashion, columns from D are added to X. For this we applied
a leave-one-out cross validation (loocv) scheme, where a
single sample is used for testing, while the remaining
(169) samples are used for training the regression model.
This was repeated such that each sample is used once as
the test data. The column from D, with the smallest rootmean-squared (rms) loocv error and absolute regression
coefficient larger than 0.3, was selected and added. The
iterative process of adding columns is discontinued when
the p-value, as output by a t-test that determines whether
the regression coefficient significantly differs from zero,
exceeds 0.05/227. To prevent the inclusion of spurious
AND effects, the following strategy is applied: When an
AND effect column is selected, we check whether the addition in explained variance is larger than the addition is
explained variance when adding the two main effect columns that constitute the combinatorial effect. Only in this
case, we add the AND effect column, otherwise the two
main effect columns are added, provided that they satisfy
the p-value threshold and their absolute regression coefficients are larger than 0.3.
Note that only coefficients larger than 0.3 or smaller than
-0.3 were allowed. This was done to focus on large
changes in gene expression. Inclusion of absolute weights
smaller than 0.3 did not increase enrichment scores of
functional categories (see next section). Although small
regression coefficients might be biologically relevant, this
indicates that there are also many spurious results
amongst the small regression weights.
The choice for a step-wise regression approach is substantiated in Additional File 9.
Enrichment analysis
For each main or interaction effect, i.e. a column from D,
we group all genes, for which that effect turned out to be
a significant predictor with a positive regression coefficient (or regression weight). This procedure was also carried out to group genes with negative weights for the
significant predictors, and to group genes irrespective of
the sign of the weight. The latter grouping is basically a
union of the genes with positive weights and the genes
with the negative weights. In addition, for the cultivation
parameters that can assume more than two settings, we
group all the genes that respond to at least one of the settings of that cultivation parameter as a main effect. Basically, we select all main effect columns from D that
represent a setting of one particular cultivation parameter

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:53

and group the genes, for which at least one of these settings is a significant predictor. (Note that the cultivation
parameters that can only assume two settings, i.e. Aeration type, S-source, Temperature and Protocol, only have
one main effect column in D, since the two settings are
mutually redundant and only one of them is included in
D.) Also here, we make the distinction between positive
and negative regression coefficients and the union of
these. The hypergeometric test is employed to assess the
significance of the overlap between all these groups and
gene sets from GO [38], MIPS [39], KEGG [40] and TF
binding data [41,42]. Additional File 1 provides an overview of the significant results (p < 10-6, q < 8.5Â·10-4).
Here, for each triplet of p-values, associated with the positive weights, the negative weights or all weights, the most
significant (smallest p-value) is selected and color coded
accordingly. See page 1 of Additional File 10 for a flowchart describing the steps of this analysis.
Functional categories specifically influenced by a
combinatorial effect
To find a combinatorial effect that is specific for a functional category we group all the genes for which this effect
was selected as a significant predictor by the regression
model (irrespective of the sign of the weight). Also, for
this effect, we make three other gene sets by grouping the
genes which are influenced by 1) one of the single effects
that constitute the combinatorial effect 2) the other single
effect and 3) by both these single effects. (If a gene is influenced by both the combinatorial effect and a single effect,
we only consider the effect that was selected first and then
add this gene to the appropriate group.) Functional categories, which are overrepresented in the first group (p â¤
10-5) and not overrepresented in the three other groups (p
â¥ 10-2) are called "specifically influenced by the combinatorial effect". See page 2 of Additional File 10 for a flowchart describing the steps of this analysis.
Clustering of genes based on regression coefficients
Given a group of genes, the hypergeometric test is
employed to select those (interaction) effects, i.e. columns
from D, which are significantly often selected by the
regression model for the genes in this group when compared to all genes in the genome. Columns with p < 10-5
are kept. Next, we create matrix R, which contains the normalized regression weights for the selected columns of all
genes in the group under investigation. The normalized
weights of a gene are obtained by dividing the original
regression weights by the variance of the gene. A consensus clustering algorithm [43] is applied to cluster the
genes based on the normalized regression weights in R:
The data is clustered using a Bayes mixture of Gaussians
EM algorithm. The number of clusters is varied from 2 to
20 (or the number of genes in the group if this is smaller
than 20) and repeated 50 times for each number of clus-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/53

ters. The total of all clusterings is used to build a cooccurence matrix, which indicates how many times a pair
of genes was found in the same cluster amongst all clusterings. This co-occurence matrix is transformed into a distance matrix. The distance matrix is zero, when a pair of
genes was clustered together in all attempts; the matrix is
one, when a pair never clustered together. We apply hierarchical clustering with complete linkage on this distance
matrix and cut the dendrogram at 0.9 to create the final
clusters. These clusters are consulted for enrichment of
annotation categories using the hypergeometric test as
explained before. See page 3 of Additional File 10 for a
flowchart describing the steps of this analysis to create
matrix R.

Additional material
Additional file 1
Functional enrichment of genes influenced by the cultivation parameters. This files gives, for each of the ten cultivation parameters, the functional enrichment of genes manipulated by one of the settings of a
particular cultivation parameter, either as a single effect or as part of an
interaction effect. Here, the first columns of the tables related to the cultivation parameters that can assume more than two settings, form an
exception; these columns represent the enrichment of the genes that are
manipulated by at least one of the settings of a particular cultivation
parameter as a single effect. The genes in such a column are the union of
the genes related to other single effect columns in the table. The (uncorrected) P-values and Q-values (FDRs) are represented by shades of red,
green and blue. Here, red, green and blue refer to the enrichment of genes
with only positive regression weights, only negative regression weights, or
with all regression weights (independent of the sign), respectively. The
consulted annotation data consists of GO biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular function (MF), MIPS functional categories, KEGG pathways and TF binding data. Note that for GO we
consider two types of data: One indicates whether a gene is assigned to a
particular leaf in the GO annotation tree (annotated with appendix leaf).
The other associates a gene located in a certain leaf not only with that particular leaf but also with all nodes between the leaf node and the root of
the GO tree (annotated with appendix comp). Numbers next to the vertical axis indicate the group size of the functional catergories. Numbers
beneath the horizontal axis indicate the number of genes in a gene group,
i.e. the number of genes manipulated by a particular main or interaction
effect of cultivation parameters. Numbers in the boxes indicate the overlap
between these two groups. See Methods section â Enrichment analysis for
details on how the gene groups, which respond to the cultivation parameters, were created.

Flowcharts of enrichment analysis. Page 1 â Flowchart of Methods â
Enrichment analysis. All significant regression weights are stored in a
large matrix. This matrix has 6005 rows, which represent all differentially
expressed genes for which the regression analysis was performed, and 227
columns, which represent the (combinatorial) cultivation parameters,
which were used as predictors in the regression model. An element of this
matrix indicates the assigned regression weight of a cultivation parameter
to explain the expression pattern of a gene. A zero indicates that the cultivation parameter was not selected as a significant predictor for a gene.
For each column of this matrix, we group the genes that were upregulated
(positive weights), downregulated (negative weights) or either up- or
downregulated (non-zero weights) by the cultivation parameter related to
that column. These groups are analyzed for significant overlap with gene
groups derived from functional annotation databases and TF binding
information using the hypergeometric test. The enrichment results are visually represented in Additional File 1. Page 2 â Flowchart of Methods â
Functional categories specifically influenced by a combinatorial effect
Gene groups are derived based on the large matrix with regression weights.
In this case, for each combinatorial effect we create four gene groups: 1)
We group the genes that respond to the combinatorial effect (non-zero
weights). 2) We group the genes that respond to one of the single effects
that constitute the combinatorial effect. 3) We group the genes that
respond to the other single effect. 4) We group genes that respond to both
single effects. Again, the hypergeometric test is employed to analyze these
gene groups for significant overlap with gene groups derived from functional categories. Page 3 â Flowchart of Methods â Clustering of genes
based on regression coefficients Firstly, genes that respond (non-zero
weights) to a particular (combinatorial) cultivation parameter are
grouped. (These groups are identical to the blue groups generated in the
enrichment analysis flowchart on Page 1 of this document.) These groups
are analyzed for significant overlap with the gene group derived from the
shake-flask experiment. The significant cultivation parameters are
selected. (These are the cultivation parameters to which significantly
many of the genes in the shake-flask gene group respond.) A new matrix
is derived. This matrix contains the regression weights of the genes of the
shake-flask gene group for the signficant cultivation parameters. Bascially,
this matrix is a submatrix of the original regression weight matrix. By normalizing these regression weights, we arrive at matrix R, which is used in
the subsequent cluster analysis.
