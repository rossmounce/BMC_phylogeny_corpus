Abstract
Background: CrMYC2 is an early jasmonate-responsive bHLH transcription factor involved in the regulation of the
expression of the genes of the terpenic indole alkaloid biosynthesis pathway in Catharanthus roseus. In this paper,
we identified the amino acid domains necessary for the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2.
Findings: We examined the intracellular localization of whole CrMYC2 and of various deletion mutants, all fused
with GFP, using a transient expression assay in onion epidermal cells. Sequence analysis of this protein revealed
the presence of four putative basic nuclear localization signals (NLS). Assays showed that none of the predicted
NLS is active alone. Further functional dissection of CrMYC2 showed that the nuclear targeting of this transcription
factor involves the cooperation of three domains located in the C-terminal region of the protein. The first two
domains are located at amino acid residues 454-510 and 510-562 and contain basic classical monopartite NLSs;
these regions are referred to as NLS3 (KRPRKR) and NLS4 (EAERQRREK), respectively. The third domain, between
residues 617 and 652, is rich in basic amino acids that are well conserved in other phylogenetically related bHLH
transcription factors. Our data revealed that these three domains are inactive when isolated but act cooperatively
to target CrMYC2 to the nucleus.
Conclusions: This study identified three amino acid domains that act in cooperation to target the CrMYC2
transcription factor to the nucleus. Further fine structure/function analysis of these amino acid domains will allow
the identification of new NLS domains and will allow the investigation of the related molecular mechanisms
involved in the nuclear targeting of the CrMYC2 bHLH transcription factor.

Background
Catharanthus roseus L. G. Don. produces terpenoid
indole alkaloids (TIAs). Some TIAs have pharmaceutical
properties, such as the hypotensive compound ajmalicine
and the anticancer agents vinblastine and vincristine. The
biosynthesis of TIAs is induced by jasmonate [1], and the
expression of several genes encoding enzymes of the TIA
biosynthesis pathway are coordinately regulated by the
APETALA2 (AP2)-domain ORCA3 (octadecanoid derivative-responsive Catharanthus AP2-domain) transcription
factor (TF) in response to this hormone [2]. The Orca3

gene is itself regulated by jasmonate and possesses a jasmonate-responsive element (JRE) in its promoter [3].
This JRE is composed of 1) a qualitative region that
switches on Orca3 expression in response to jasmonate
and 2) a quantitative element that acts as an enhancer of
transcription. The qualitative region is a G-box-like element (AACGTG). An early jasmonate-responsive bHLH
TF, CrMYC2 (AF283507), binds this qualitative element
and activates the expression of the Orca3 gene (our
unpublished data). CrMYC2 was isolated by a yeast onehybrid screen using a G-box sequence (CACGTG) as bait
[4]. Transcription factors such as CrMYC2 can be used
as metabolic engineering tools to improve the production
of valuable secondary metabolites in plant cells [5]. However, the use of transcription factors as metabolic engineering tools supposes that the transcription factor is

properly targeted to nucleus when overexpressed in the
cell.
CrMYC2 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
TF family. The bHLH TF family comprises 162 genes in
Arabidopsis thaliana and 167 genes in Oryza sativa, but
the functions of only few of these genes have been characterized [6-8]. In particular, protein regions involved in
the targeting of bHLH transcription factors to the
nucleus have been functionally identified in only a few
of them [7-18]. The nuclear import of proteins is often
mediated by specific sequences, called nuclear localization signals (NLSs). NLSs are recognized by receptors
(importin a and importin b) that allow the interaction
of the protein with the nuclear pore and the translocation of the protein complex into the nucleus [19]. Several NLS sequences have been characterized. Short
stretches of basic amino acids (aa), including both
monopartite ((K/R) 4/6 ) and bipartite ((K/R) 2 X 10 - 12
(K/R) 3) sequences, are present in various nuclear proteins [20-23]. In addition, structure/function analysis of
different nuclear proteins has revealed that a variety of
non-conserved sequences are also involved in nuclear
targeting [24-26].
Concerning plant bHLH TFs, only one structure/function analysis of nuclear localization, the one completed
for the maize R protein, has been performed in detail.
The maize R protein is involved in the control of anthocyanin biosynthesis in various organs in maize [27]. The
authors demonstrated that this protein contains three
different NLSs (A, M, and C). NLS-A contains arginine
residues but not lysine (characteristic of some viral
NLSs). NLS-C contains hydrophobic amino acids surrounding basic residues, and NLS-M is rich in basic
amino acids, similar to classical monopartite NLSs. The
truncated N-terminal or C-terminal part of this protein
can be targeted to nucleus only if both NLS-A and NLSM or NLS-C and NLS-M are simultaneously present [9].
In this paper, we present a structure/function analysis
of the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2. Different sequences
from CrMYC2 were fused with GFP and transiently
expressed in epidermal onion cells. Our data show that
none of the basic aa-rich sequences identified as putative NLSs are functional alone and that the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2 involves cooperation among three
different domains of the C-terminal part of the protein.

clone, in phase with the 3’ extremity of the mgfp5 coding sequence, the full-length Crmyc2 cDNA (GenBank
accession number AF283507), Crmyc2 deletion mutants,
or annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to putative
NLSs. These putative NLSs were identified by bioinformatics analysis (http://wolfpsort.org/) or a manual
search for stretches of basic amino acids similar to classical mono- and bipartite- NLSs [26,28-30].
The complete Crmyc2 cDNA or deletion derivatives
were amplified by PCR using specific primers containing
at their 5’ end a NcoI site for the forward primer and
an SpeI site for the reverse primer except for the fulllength Crmyc2 and the deletion mutant F1 in which a
NcoI restriction site was added to both the forward and
reverse primers because an SpeI site is present in the
Crmyc2 sequence. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for 4 min (1 cycle) followed by 94°C for
1 min, an annealing step at various temperatures
depending on the Tm of the primers used for 1.5 min,
and 72°C for 1 min (30 cycles), with a final extension
step at 72°C for 5 min. PCRs were performed in a final
volume of 25 μl with 0.25 U of Taq polymerase and 1 ×
MgCl2-free buffer (Promega), 2 mM MgCl2, 200 nM of
each dNTP, appropriate oligonucleotides (1 μM each)
and 5 ng of Crmyc2 cDNA in pGEM-T Easy (Promega).
PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), removed by NcoI/SpeI (or with only NcoI for
full-length Crmyc2 cDNA and deletion mutant F1) and
subcloned into the GFP-pEMBL18 plasmid cut with
NcoI and SpeI. Double-stranded sequences encoding
putative NLSs of CrMYC2 with cohesive 5’-NcoI and
3’-SpeI ends were reconstituted from single strand oligonucleotides (Oligo Express, France) and cloned into the
GFP-pEMBL18 plasmid digested with NcoI and SpeI.
Correct orientation and fusion of the cloned sequences
and the gfp sequence were verified by sequencing
(MWG Biotech, Germany). The sequences of the primers used are given in Table 1. The different protein
fragments or NLS sequences fused with GFP are schematically shown in Figure 1. In addition, an N-terminal
fusion of CrMYC2 with GFP was obtained by cloning
the full-length Crmyc2 cDNA into the pTH2BN plasmid
[31], by a similar procedure. Crmyc2 was inserted into
the XhoI site of the pTH2BN plasmid.

The cassette containing the CaMV 35S promoter, a
multicloning site and the mgfp5 sequence followed by a
T-Nos terminator sequence was removed from pCambia-1302 with SphI and inserted into the SphI site of
pEMBL18. This plasmid construct was called GFPpEMBL18. The GFP-pEMBL18 plasmid was used to

Commercially available white onions were surface disinfected with 70% ethanol. After dissection, the internal
epidermis layer was peeled and placed face up on solid
MS medium (8 g agar/liter) without vitamins (Duchefa,
M0222) in 55-mm diameter Petri dishes. The particle
bombardment transformation was carried out using a
PDS-1000 BioRad system with 1800 Psi rupture disks

DNA (10 μg) was coated on tungsten M-25 particles
(BioRad) in 25 μL of 2.5 M CaCl2 and 10 μL of 0.1 M
spermidine. Particles were homogenized for 2 min by
ultra-sonication and sedimented by gravity for 15 min.
Supernatant (15 μL) was removed, and after a short
sonication step, 4 μL of the remaining particle mixture
was deposed on a macrocarrier disk (BioRad). During
bombardments, samples were placed 6 cm from the
stopping screen. Onion cells were transformed with the
plasmids carrying different CrMYC2 (full length or deletion) GFP fusions and NLS-GFP fusions under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. After transformation,
the samples were incubated for 12 h in the dark at 25°C.
Epifluorescence microscopy

Epidermal onion cells were observed with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a

digital camera (Olympus DP50) and the corresponding
software (OLYMPUS ANALYSIS). The GFP fluorescence
was imaged with a blue excitation filter set (460-490 nm
excitation filter, 515 nm cut-off filter). After staining with
DAPI (600 nM), fluorescence was observed with UV filter
set (360 nm excitation filter, 460 cut-off filter).

Results
Four putative NLSs are present in the CrMYC2 sequence

The deduced amino acid sequence from the open reading frame of the Crmyc2 cDNA is characterized by a
conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain (residues 511-572) typical of the bHLH class of transcription
factors. The basic domain of bHLH transcription factors
is involved in the interaction with DNA [32-35], and the
HLH motif is involved in protein dimerization [36,37]
and participates in DNA binding specificity [38,39].

sequences (NLS 1, 2, 3, and 4) and of the regions of CrMYC2 used to make the GFP fusions. NLS: nuclear localization signal, CrMYC2: fulllength CrMYC2 sequence, F1 to F8: partial CrMYC2 sequences used for fusion to GFP. Grey box: bHLH domain. Single oval shape: monopartite
NLS. Double oval shape: bipartite NLS.

The search for NLSs in the CrMYC2 sequence using
protein subcellular localization prediction software
(WoLF PSORT http://wolfpsort.org/) revealed the presence of a unique putative monopartite NLS domain
(KRPRKR, amino acids 498-503) in the C-terminal part
of the protein, corresponding to a short sequence just
before the bHLH domain (Figure 1). This putative NLS
sequence was named NLS3. Further searches for domains
rich in basic amino acids located three other domains
that are similar to NLSs previously characterized in other
proteins [26,40] (Figures 1 and 2). NLS1, KRK(X)
12HRKK, which is located between residues 137 and 155,
is bipartite; NLS2, KKRP, is located between amino acids
434 and 437; and NLS4, EAERQRREK, is located
between amino acids 519 and 527 within the bHLH
domain. Both NLS1 and NLS4 are monopartite.
In an attempt to verify whether these NLS candidates
were conserved in related species, we determined if these
NLSs are present in the sequences of close orthologs in

the A. thaliana and O. sativa genomes using the GreenPhyl database (http://greenphyl.cirad.fr/v2/cgi-bin/index.
cgi). The alignment of the CrMYC2 sequence with
A. thaliana AtMYC2/RAP1/AtbHLH006/At1g32640.1,
rice 0s10g42430.1 orthologs and three other highly phylogenetically related A. thaliana sequences revealed that
NLS1 and NLS2 were weakly conserved. In contrast
NLS3 and NLS4 were well conserved (Figure 2), thus
suggesting that they were conserved during evolution
based on their function.
Putative NLSs identified in the CrMYC2 protein are not
functional alone in plant cells

To verify whether these motifs were functional NLSs,
they were fused to the N-terminal extremity of GFP and
transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. In addition, two controls were assayed: a GFP fusion with the
short monopartite NLS “PKKKRKV” from the SV40
large T antigen, which is ubiquitously functional among

eukaryotes, and a GFP fused with a “KDEL” motif that is
an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. The data
presented in Figure 3 depict the localization of each
GFP fusion in onion cells. In controls, the GFP alone
was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and
the nucleus (Figure 3A) due to passive diffusion through
the nuclear pores, whereas GFP fused to the NLS of
SV40 large T antigen was actively concentrated in the
nucleus (Figure 3B), and GFP fused to the endoplasmic
reticulum retention signal was only located in the cytoplasm (Figure 3C). Figures 3E to 3H show that the cellular localization of each of the four fusions made with
the putative CrMYC2 NLS was similar to the cellular
localization observed for GFP alone, both in the nucleus
and the cytoplasm. This finding suggests that none of
these four putative NLS sequences is individually able to
drive active nuclear translocation of the GFP fusions in
plant cells.
The N-terminal part of CrMYC2 is not required for its
nuclear localization

To identify the region of CrMYC2 involved in its translocation to the nucleus, full-length and deletion mutants of

CrMYC2 were fused to GFP (Figure 1) and expressed in
onion cells. The results are presented in Figure 3. All
of the data were obtained with fusions made at the
N-terminal extremity of GFP except for the full-length
CrMYC2 protein, which was successfully expressed only
when it was fused to the C-terminal end of GFP. The
fusion between GFP and full-length CrMYC2 exhibited a
different localization compared to the GFP alone: the fluorescence was mostly observed in the nucleus but also, some
small spots in the cytoplasm were observed (Figure 3D
right). The nucleus localization of CrMYC2 was confirmed
by staining the genomic DNA in cells with DAPI (Figure
3D left). Similar data were obtained with transformation
experiments using a lower amount of the expression plasmid (2 μg or 4 μg), suggesting that the cytoplasmic spots
were not the result of the overexpression of the GFPCrMYC2 fusion protein. The F1 and F2 fusions accumulated strongly in the nucleus (Figure 3I-J). These data show
that the N-terminal part of the protein between residues 1
and 454 was not strictly required for the nuclear import of
CrMYC2 into the nucleus. In addition, the amino acids
sequence 1-168 could bear a signal responsible for the
retention of the GFP fusions in spots in the cytoplasm.

Different domains act in collaboration for CrMYC2
subcellular localization

To localize the other domains involved in CrMYC2
nuclear targeting, further functional dissection of the
C-terminal part (aa 454-699) was done.
The F3 fusion had a cellular localization pattern similar to that of the GFP-CrMYC2 fusion (Figure 3K). This
suggested that the 454-510 region of the protein contains a signal allowing the complete targeting of the protein to the nucleus and/or preventing its accumulation
in spots in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, when expressed
alone in fusion with GFP (F4), this 454-510 sequence
did not have an effect on the subcellular localization of
the GFP fluorescence compared to the expression of
GFP alone (Figure 3L and 3A). This last result indicated
that the signal contained in this part of the protein collaborates with other signals located in the 510-699
region of CrMYC2 for its nuclear targeting.
The subcellular localization of the F5 fusion, corresponding to the 510-699 region lacking the 47 C-terminal amino acids, was similar to the cellular localization
of the F3 fusion, showing that the C-terminal 47 amino
acids of CrMYC2 did not play any role in subcellular
localization (Figure 3M). When an additional 35
C-terminal amino acids (F6 fusion) were removed
(Figure 3N), the localization of the green fluorescence in
the cell was identical to the one observed for GFP alone,
suggesting that the 617-652 aa portion of the protein
participates in the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2. Nevertheless, the F7 fusion (608-699), which includes this
region but lacks the main N-terminal part of the
protein, failed to be actively targeted to the nucleus
(Figure 3O). When the 510-562 portion was removed
(F8 fusion) from F5, the subcellular localization was
identical to the one of GFP alone (Figure 3P). This
result suggested that another domain located in the
510-652 part of the protein was also necessary for
proper nuclear targeting. All of these data showed that
the targeting of the CrMYC2 protein to the nucleus
involved different domains located at aa 454-562 and aa
617-652 and that these domains acted in collaboration.

Discussion and conclusions
In this study, we investigated the nuclear targeting of
CrMYC2, a C. roseus bHLH TF. The contribution of the
different domains of this protein in nuclear targeting
was evaluated in epidermal onion cells transiently
expressing GFP protein fusions.
Proteins with a molecular weight less than 40-60 kDa
are able to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion [40].
This was illustrated by the cellular localization of GFP
(MW: 28 kDa) alone, which was both cytoplasmic and
nuclear. This default distribution allows the detection of
NLSs and of motifs that sequester the protein in the

Page 7 of 9

cytoplasm. This notion was validated by the results
obtained for GFP fused with the NLS from the SV40
large T antigen, which was primarily localized in the
nucleus, and for the fusion of GFP with a “KDEL” endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which was localized
only in the cytoplasm (Figure 3B-C).
The search for conserved basic NLS motifs in the
CrMYC2 sequence revealed four putative NLSs [20,30,41]:
one bipartite, NLS1, and three monopartite NLSs: NLS2,
NLS3 and NLS4. None of these four NLSs were able to
actively target GFP to the nucleus individually. When the
CrMYC2 sequence was compared to the sequence of two
orthologs, A. thaliana AtMYC2/RAP1/AtbHLH006/
At1g32640.1 and O. sativa Os10g42430.1, and with three
other phylogenetically related A. thaliana bHLH proteins
(Figure 2), we found that the NLS1 and NLS2 sequences
are weakly conserved. On the contrary, the NLS3 and
NLS4 sequences are well conserved among the six proteins. In addition, NSL1 and NLS2 are located in the
1-454 N-terminal part of CrMYC2, which was not necessary for the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2, whereas NLS3
and NLS4 are located in the C-terminal part of the protein, which contained the signals necessary for nuclear targeting. In conclusion, NLS1 and NLS2 are likely not
involved in the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2, whereas
NLS3 and NLS4 could play a role in the nuclear targeting
of CrMYC2 by acting in a collaborative way.
The functional dissection of CrMYC2 revealed that the
C-terminal region (aa 454-699) of the protein contains the
signals that are necessary and sufficient for nuclear targeting of the protein. This observation is in accordance with
previous data obtained for the orthologous A. thaliana
protein AtMYC2. Using GFP-protein fusions expressed in
tobacco and A. thaliana cells, it has been shown that the
full-length AtMYC2-GFP fusion is actively targeted to the
nucleus, whereas a mutant lacking the C-terminal part
comprising the bHLH domain has the same subcellular
distribution profile as GFP alone [8]. These results suggest
that conserved motifs located in the C-terminal region of
the protein are involved in the nuclear targeting of the
CrMYC2 and AtMYC2 proteins.
To identify the motifs involved in nuclear targeting,
further functional analysis of the C-terminal part of
CrMYC2 was done. The data obtained showed that three
regions, aa 454-510, aa 510-562 and aa 617-652, are necessary for the nuclear targeting of CrMYC2, but individually,
none of these sequences was able to target the GFP fusion
to the nucleus, suggesting that these regions cooperate to
drive CrMYC2 to the nucleus. The bHLH TF family is
widespread in eukaryotic organisms and is a large gene
family in A. thaliana and O. sativa [42-45]. Nevertheless,
few studies have been devoted to the identification of the
NLS(s) involved in their nuclear targeting. One of the
more detailed studies concerns the bHLH TF encoded by

Hedhili et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:301
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/301

the R gene from maize [9]. Three active NLS have been
identified in this protein: NLS-A (aa 100-109, GDRRAAPARP), NLS-M (aa 419-428, MSERKRREKL) and NLS-C
(aa 598-610, MISESLRKAIGRK). NLS-M and NLS-C are
independently sufficient to direct the GUS protein to the
nucleus. Interestingly, further analysis demonstrated that
these NLSs act cooperatively to target the R protein to the
nucleus. Efficient targeting is obtained only if both NLS-A
and NLS-M or NLS-C and NLS-M are present. NLS-M
corresponds to the basic part of the bHLH and is similar
to NLS4 in CrMYC2. Some authors have suggested that
the DNA-binding function of several classes of transcription factors have evolved to have NLS functions [29,46].
The two other NLSs, NLS-A and NLS-C, are not found in
CrMYC2. Although the NLSs of these two plant bHLH
TF are different, in both cases the cooperation of different
regions of the protein is necessary to target the protein to
the nucleus. In CrMYC2, the regions of aa 454-510 and aa
510-562 contain NLS3 and NLS4, respectively. These two
NLS sequences are well conserved among five related TF
from A. thaliana and O. sativa and are likely the functional NLS sequences of these regions. The aa 617-652
region does not contain sequences reminiscent of known
NLSs. Nevertheless, this fragment is located in a very wellconserved sequence located after the bHLH domain
between aa 614 and 690 (Figure 2). The aa 617-652 region
is rich in conserved basic amino acids and could correspond to a new non-autonomous NLS. A variety of nonconventional signals, very diverse in sequences, have been
described for the nuclear targeting of several proteins
[24,47,48] including bHLH related transcription factors
[49]. Full-length CrMYC2, F3 and F5 GFP fusions were
localized in the nucleus but were also found in concentrated spots into the cytoplasm. We do not have adequate
evidence to know if this profile corresponds to the artificial retention of these fusion proteins in vesicles or organelles or if this localization pattern has biological
significance. A recent study reported the localization of a
tobacco bHLH protein, NtWIN4, in plastids, suggesting
the possibility that this nuclear transcription factor evolved
from a plastid-resident regulatory factor [48]. However,
the sequence responsible for NtWIN4 plastid targeting is
not present in CrMYC2.
Further studies using point mutation experiments will
be necessary to determine the amino acids important
for the NLS function of the three functional conserved
NLS domains identified in the CrMYC2 transcription
factor.
