Abstract
Background: Wheat is an excellent species to study freezing tolerance and other abiotic stresses. However, the
sequence of the wheat genome has not been completely characterized due to its complexity and large size. To
circumvent this obstacle and identify genes involved in cold acclimation and associated stresses, a large scale EST
sequencing approach was undertaken by the Functional Genomics of Abiotic Stress (FGAS) project.
Results: We generated 73,521 quality-filtered ESTs from eleven cDNA libraries constructed from wheat plants
exposed to various abiotic stresses and at different developmental stages. In addition, 196,041 ESTs for which
tracefiles were available from the National Science Foundation wheat EST sequencing program and DuPont were
also quality-filtered and used in the analysis. Clustering of the combined ESTs with d2_cluster and TGICL yielded
a few large clusters containing several thousand ESTs that were refractory to routine clustering techniques. To
resolve this problem, the sequence proximity and "bridges" were identified by an e-value distance graph to
manually break clusters into smaller groups. Assembly of the resolved ESTs generated a 75,488 unique sequence
set (31,580 contigs and 43,908 singletons/singlets). Digital expression analyses indicated that the FGAS dataset is
enriched in stress-regulated genes compared to the other public datasets. Over 43% of the unique sequence set
was annotated and classified into functional categories according to Gene Ontology.
Conclusion: We have annotated 29,556 different sequences, an almost 5-fold increase in annotated sequences
compared to the available wheat public databases. Digital expression analysis combined with gene annotation
helped in the identification of several pathways associated with abiotic stress. The genomic resources and
knowledge developed by this project will contribute to a better understanding of the different mechanisms that
govern stress tolerance in wheat and other cereals.

Background
Cold acclimation (CA) allows hardy plants to develop the
efficient freezing tolerance (FT) mechanisms needed for
winter survival. During the period of exposure to low temperature (LT), numerous biochemical, physiological and
metabolic functions are altered in plants, and these
changes are regulated by LT mostly at the gene expression
level. The identification of LT-responsive genes is therefore required to understand the molecular basis of CA.
Cold-induced genes and their products have been isolated
and characterized in many species. In wheat and other
cereals, the expression of several genes during cold acclimation was found to be positively correlated with the
capacity of each genotype and tissue to develop FT [1].
Furthermore, abiotic stresses that have a dehydrative component (such as cold, drought and salinity) share some
responses. It is therefore expected that, in addition to the
genes regulated specifically by each stress, some genes will
be regulated by multiple stresses. The availability of wheat
genotypes with varying degree of FT makes this species an
excellent model to study freezing tolerance and other abiotic stresses. The identification of new genes involved in
the cold response will provide invaluable tools to further
our understanding of the metabolic pathways of cold
acclimation and the acquisition of superior freezing tolerance of hardy genotypes.
Major genomics initiatives have generated valuable data
for the elucidation of the expressed portion of the
genomes of higher plants. The genome sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana was completed in 2000 [2] while the finished sequence for rice was recently published [3]. The
relatively small genome size of these model organisms
was a key element in their selection as the first plant
genomes to be sequenced with extensive coverage. On the
other hand, the allohexaploid wheat genome is one of the
largest among crop species with a haploid size of 16.7 billion bp [4], which is 110 and 40 times larger than Arabidopsis and rice respectively [5]. The large size, combined
with the high percentage (over 80%) of repetitive noncoding DNA, presents a major challenge for comprehensive sequencing of the wheat genome. However, a significant insight into the expressed portion of the wheat
genome can be gained through large-scale generation and
analysis of ESTs. cDNA libraries prepared from different
tissues exposed to various stress conditions and developmental stages are valuable tools to obtain the expressed
and stress-regulated portion of the genome. This approach
was used in several species such as oat [6], barley [7],
tomato [8] and poplar [9]. The sequencing of cDNAs gives
direct information on the mature transcripts for the coding portion of the genome that can subsequently be used
for gene identification and functional studies. The availability of wheat genomics data in the public datasets has
grown rapidly through major initiatives [10,11]. How-

ever, additional ESTs are needed to complete the identification of the expressed genes under different growth
conditions and from different genotypes. This will contribute to a more complete representation of the genome
through identification of new genes and extension of contigs for the majority of genes that have incomplete
sequence coverage. Towards this goal, the Functional
Genomics of Abiotic Stress (FGAS) program initiated an
EST sequencing effort directed toward the study of abiotic
stress, with an emphasis on cold acclimation [12]. To
increase gene diversity in the EST population and increase
the probability of identifying those associated with freezing tolerance, different cDNA libraries were prepared from
winter wheat tissues exposed for various times to low temperature, together with select libraries derived from tissues
exposed to other stresses or at different developmental
stages. In this report, we describe the generation of 73,521
high quality ESTs from wheat stress-associated cDNA
libraries. In order to perform the assembly and digital
expression analyses, these ESTs were supplemented with
wheat ESTs for which sequence quality data was available.
These include the NSF [13] and DuPont datasets, which
will be referred to as the 'NSF-DuPont' dataset in this
report. Digital expression analyses identified a large
number of genes that were associated with cold acclimation and other stresses. Expression analyses and functional classification provided important information
about the different metabolic and regulatory pathways
that are possibly associated with cellular adjustment to
environmental stresses. These new EST resources are an
important addition to publicly available resources especially in relation to the study of abiotic stresses in cereals.

Results and discussion
The large-scale FGAS wheat EST sequencing project was
undertaken to identify new genes associated with abiotic
stress and to provide physical resources for functional
studies. We have developed a unique wheat EST resource
from eleven cDNA libraries prepared from tissues at different developmental stages and exposed to different
stress conditions (Table 1). The EST collections from
FGAS, NSF and DuPont were analyzed and classified into
functional categories.
Assembly and identification of new wheat genes
We have used EST sequences and quality values from the
corresponding tracefiles of large datasets (FGAS, NSF and
DuPont) to assemble 75,488 different wheat sequences
(31,580 contigs, 36,388 singletons and 7,520 singlets).
Among these datasets, the FGAS project produced 11,225
unique sequences (2,824 contigs, 6,663 singletons and
1,738 singlets) indicating that the FGAS ESTs encompass
a large subset of unique transcripts. These sequences were
analyzed using BLASTN on the db_est database and filtered for wheat sequences with two different cut-off e-val-

ues to identify new wheat genes. With an e-25 cut-off
value, we found that 2,304 genes had no homologous
wheat ESTs (Table 2). After filtering these genes against
the wheat protein database with TBLASTX, there were still
2,243 proteins showing no homology to known proteins.
With an e-05 cut-off, 1,581 genes had no homologs in
wheat. After filtering these against the protein database,
1,470 non-homologous sequences remained. These
unique wheat sequences were then BLASTed against Arabidopsis, rice, and finally nr db EST (Table 2). In Arabidopsis, we found that only 5 of the remaining FGAS wheat
sequences had a strong (e-25) similarity using BLASTN
while 253 of the remaining sequences had homologs
when filtered with the Arabidopsis protein database (count
down to 1,985). A similar trend was found in Arabidopsis
using a lower sequence similarity cut-off (e-05). The
remaining unique gene count was reduced by several hundred after comparing protein homologs in rice (counts
down to 1674 at e-25 and down to 855 at e-05) demonstrating that several genes common between rice and
wheat are absent in Arabidopsis (Table 2). The remaining
unique ESTs were BLASTed against the non redundant
database to determine whether homologs were present in
other organisms. At an e-05, there were 795 ESTs showing
no significant similarity to known domains in genes from
other species. It is possible that some of these genes derive
from unknown micro-organisms contaminating the plant
tissues, and/or from residual genomic DNA in the RNA
samples used for cDNA synthesis. However, the majority
of these sequences have ORFs encoding proteins larger
than 30 amino acids, with an average predicted protein
size of over 100 amino acids. This suggests that the unidentified genes do represent novel wheat genes.
The Institute for Genomic research (TIGR) wheat gene
index (Release 10.0) shows that only 6,431 of the 44,954
wheat contigs (14%) were successfully allocated a known
Molecular Function using Gene Ontology, compared to
the classification done for Arabidopsis in which 12,558 of
the 28,900 contigs (42%) have a known Molecular Function. Therefore, prior to this report, Arabidopsis had almost
twice as many genes annotated with at least one defined
function compared to wheat (12,558 vs 6,431). The classification of the complete dataset (FGAS and NSF-DuPont
datasets) allowed the tentative annotation of 43.3% of the
genes. As expected, most of the annotated sequences were
in contigs (57.6%) while the percentage of annotated singletons/singlets was much lower (30.8%). We have thus
been able to functionally annotate 29,556 different
sequences, an almost 5-fold increase in annotated
sequences compared to TIGR. This is a significant contribution that broadens the available wheat public annotation dataset for downstream functional studies. These
results demonstrate that a large number of wheat genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/149

are poorly characterized and stress the fact that major
efforts in functional analyses are needed.
Enrichment for stress-regulated genes in the FGAS dataset
Comparative analysis of the FGAS ESTs and NSF-DuPont
ESTs based on Gene Ontology (GOslim) showed that several GO classes are more represented in FGAS than in the
NSF-DuPont dataset (Figure 1). When general GO classes
are compared (GOs 1 to 3; Biological Process, Transcription and Protein Metabolism), no major differences in the
number of ESTs were found. Similarly, most GOslim
classes showed less than 25% difference between the two
datasets. However, GOs 4 and 5 (Enzyme Regulator Activity and Nutrient Reservoir Activity) had a lower representation while GOs 6 to 15 (Transcription Factor Activity,
Nuclease Activity, Plasma Membrane, Secondary Metabolism, Response to External Stimulus, Carbohydrate Binding, Response to Abiotic Stimulus, Cell-Cell Signalling,
Development and Behavior) were more abundant in the
FGAS dataset (Figure 1).

To identify genes that are differentially represented
between the two datasets, the relative abundance of ESTs
was analyzed and referred to as digital expression analysis.
For each contig, the number of ESTs from FGAS (excluding ESTs derived from Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization; SSH) was divided by the number of ESTs from NSFDuPont and the ratio was normalized to correct for the
difference in size between the two datasets (54,032 non
SSH EST sequences for the FGAS dataset and 196,041
sequences for the NSF-DuPont dataset). Thus, after normalization, the relative expression level for a contig having 1 EST from each dataset would result in a relative
expression of 3.62X in FGAS compared to NSF-DuPont (a
ratio of 1 multiplied by 196,041/54,032). Since the SSH
technique aims to enrich differentially expressed cDNAs,
the ESTs derived from the SSH libraries were analysed separately to avoid a bias in the number of ESTs in a contig,
which could invalidate the digital expression analysis
approach.
The data indicated that over 75% of the contigs have ratios
that vary by less than two-fold, suggesting a similar representation of ESTs between the FGAS (less SSH) and the
NSF-DuPont datasets. The remaining 25% of contigs
showed more than two-fold difference in abundance
(Table 3; see additional file 1: Table1.xls) in the FGAS
dataset. When 5- and 10-fold ratios are used as cut-off,
6.6% and 1.7% of the contigs are retained respectively.
Most of the differences are due to genes that are over-represented in the FGAS dataset (for the 5-fold cut-off, 1959
genes are over- and 136 genes are under-represented, see
Table 3). With a higher cut-off (20-fold differential abundance), only 61 contigs are over expressed and 5 are
under-expressed. An analysis of these highly over-repre-

previously been reported to be over-expressed under
stress. Although the unique contigs in the FGAS dataset
may represent transcripts that are specific to the cultivar
used in our study, there is a possibility that they may represent novel genes that are induced by environmental
stress.
In Arabidopsis, microarray experiments have shown that
about 10% of the genes are over-or under-expressed by at
least two-fold upon exposure to cold acclimation conditions [14]. Based on our previous northern and microarray analyses, we have estimated that the same
proportion of wheat genes is cold-regulated (Sarhan et al.,
unpublished results). If we consider a conservative estimate of 30,000 wheat genes (90,000 if we consider the A,
B and D genomes), this means that around 3,000 genes
would be cold-regulated. A similar number of genes was
identified when we used a 5-fold cut-off differential
expression (2,095 differentially expressed contigs, Table
3) and added the 542 contigs having at least 3 ESTs that
are unique to the FGAS dataset. Using these criteria, our
analyses resulted in a total of 2,637 contigs or 8.4% of the
contigs generated in our assembly (31,580 contigs). Considering that 95% of the EST sequences were derived from
libraries constructed from cold-acclimated plants, these
genes represent candidate genes likely regulated by low
temperature and other stresses. However, many of these
may be differentially expressed as a consequence of the
temperature shift and metabolic adjustment and might
not be involved in conferring or regulating increased tol-

erance to stress. It would be of interest to analyse these
2,637 genes to identify those relevant to LT tolerance and
other stresses in cereals. To verify the conservation of the
stress response between wheat and Arabidopsis, we first
identified the Arabidopsis proteins having homology (e25) to the 2,637 wheat proteins identified in our study,
using the TAIR protein database. The homology search
resulted in the identification of 1,551 Arabidopsis proteins.
Most of the genes encoding these proteins are represented
on the Affymetrix and MWG microarrays. This allowed us
to obtain their expression profiles from the available public data [14,15]. Our analysis indicated that 941 genes are
cold-regulated and 890 are drought-regulated (See additional file 1: Table 1.xls and additional file 2: Table 2.xls).
There are 678 genes regulated by both stresses, with a total
of 1153 different Arabidopsis genes that are stress-regulated. Therefore, there are over 44% of the 2,637 putative
wheat stress-regulated genes that have a homolog regulated by stress in Arabidopsis, suggesting overlapping
responses between the two species.
As a complementary approach to identifying new wheat
genes that may be differentially expressed, different SSH
libraries were produced to identify genes over-expressed
after brief (1 day) or long (21–49 days) periods of cold
acclimation. Different cultivars that may help to identify
other components of freezing tolerance such as pathogen
resistance to snow molds were used for these analyses. A
total of 3,873 contigs containing 18,610 SSH ESTs were
obtained with 2,969 contigs (76.7%) tentatively annotated. Unique contigs from SSH libraries are potentially a
good source to mine for new genes associated with cold
acclimation. Overall, 225 contigs unique to the SSH
libraries (See additional file 3: Table 3.xls) were identified,
among which 74 were annotated (Table 6). We found that
11 of the 74 annotated SSH contigs (or 15% of the unique
SSH contigs) have corresponding genes (high similarity
based on BLASTX e-values) that are over-expressed more
than 5-fold in the differentially-expressed FGAS contigs.
These results suggest that unique SSH contigs contain candidate genes that could be involved in abiotic stress tolerance.

Metabolic pathways associated with differentially
expressed genes
GO slim annotation was used to subdivide the 2,637
stress-regulated genes into function categories to gain
insight into their putative role during cold acclimation
and abiotic stresses. The results show that a large proportion of these contigs were annotated under a limited
number of GO classes (Figure 2). Over 53.7% of the contigs were grouped into 14 GO categories while 27.5% of
the contigs were designated "No Gene Ontology" and
4.2% were classified as "Hypothetical Protein", a term
used to designate open reading frames predicted from the
Arabidopsis or rice genomic DNA. The remaining contigs
with other GO categories were grouped together in one
category (14.6%).

A plethora of physiological and metabolic adjustments
occur during cold acclimation and in response to other
stresses. The regulation of genes involved in temperature,
drought and salt stresses is known to reflect the cross-talk
between different signalling pathways [16]. However, few
studies have identified multiple genes that are stress-regulated and that belong to a same metabolic pathway. Our
analyses enabled us to position several genes in their
respective metabolic pathway, suggesting that these pathways are involved in stress responses. Since it is beyond
the scope of this report to cover all possible pathways
involved, we highlight some of the key elements that
likely contribute to the stress response and tolerance.

encoded by transcripts that are over-represented by at least
5-fold in the FGAS dataset.
Amino acid metabolism
Genes encoding proteins involved in primary metabolism
pathways have been identified in the contigs with an overrepresentation of FGAS ESTs and cover several aspects of
plant metabolic adjustments. Amino acid metabolism
and the TCA cycle are the major pathways that generate
precursors for various biological molecules. ESTs encoding several enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of
arginine, cysteine, lysine, methionine, serine, phenyla-

lanine, proline and tryptophan are over-represented by
more than 5-fold. These amino acids are precursors for the
synthesis of several specialized metabolites. Two contigs
encode the enzyme delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase that is involved in proline biosynthesis, a metabolite that was found to increase during cold acclimation
and drought stress [17]. Similarly, two contigs encode
glutamate decarboxylase (GAD1), which is involved in
the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a non
protein amino acid known to accumulate during cold
acclimation and proposed to function in oxidative stress
tolerance [18]. Several contigs encode enzymes involved
in the metabolism of cysteine, an important precursor of
glutathione involved in the modulation of oxidative
stress. These include two different cysteine synthases and
a putative O-acetylserine (thiol) synthase (OASTL). Overexpression of different isoforms of OASTL can increase
thiol content in different transgenic plants and increase
tolerance to abiotic stress such as exposure to elevated levels of cadmium [19].
Lipid metabolism
ESTs encoding different putative lipases and other proteins involved in lipid oxidation (acyl-CoA oxidase, MutT/
nudix protein like, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, bketo acyl reductase, enoyl-ACP reductase, enoyl-CoAhydratase, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A hydrolase)
are over-represented in the FGAS dataset while the acylcarrier protein III involved in lipid synthesis is under-represented. These results suggest that lipid degradation
occurs concomitantly with a reduction in the synthesis of
short chain lipids. On the other hand, ESTs encoding
enzymes involved in the synthesis of specialized lipids
such as ATP citrate lyase α-subunit and the long chain
fatty acid enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase are more abundant among FGAS ESTs. ESTs corresponding to several
enzymes involved in sterol metabolism are also over-represented, suggesting major lipid modifications in membranes during cold acclimation. ESTs encoding three
enzymes involved in the alternate pathway of isopentenyl
pyrophosphate and squalene synthesis (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase, squalene synthase), three key
enzymes of the sterol pathways (cycloartenol synthase,
C14-sterol reductase (FACKEL), and 24-methylenelophenol methyltransferase) (Figure 3), and other enzymes
such as sterol 4-alpha-methyl-oxidase, which can add to
the variety of sterols produced, are also over-represented.
The putative over-expression of several enzymes in the
sterol pathway supports the previous observation of an
increased production of membrane sterols [20]. These
authors showed that the concentration of membrane sterols increases during cold acclimation and that this effect is
more prominent in tolerant rye cultivars. Interestingly,
sitosterol increases while campesterol decreases during

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/149

acclimation, suggesting that the C24 methyltransferase
that is putatively over-expressed in the FGAS dataset may
be the SMT-2 transferase that diverts the methylenelophenol into the sitosterol pathway (see Figure 3; [21]). A
search through the protein database has shown that the
C24 methyltransferase has a much greater homology with
SMT2 (7e-143) than with SMT1 (4e-63) supporting that
the C24 methyltransferase is SMT2. The over-representation of FGAS ESTs in two contigs encoding stearoyl-acylcarrier protein desaturase and two contigs encoding CDPdiacylglycerol synthase suggests that other important lipid
modifying activities also occur in response to cold acclimation. Stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase is
involved in the desaturation of existing lipids to form
double bonds rendering the lipids more fluid at low temperature. This is an important adjustment associated with
membrane stability at low temperature [20]. The overexpression of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase was previously
shown to favour the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol
[22]. In addition, one contig encodes a phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase. This enzyme is induced
by low temperature and catalyzes the three sequential
methylation steps to form phosphocholine, a key precursor of phosphatidylcholine and glycinebetaine in plants –
metabolites known to be important in conferring tolerance to osmotic stresses such as low temperature, drought
and salinity [23].
Secondary metabolism
Several contigs encode key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as phenylalanine
ammonia lyase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and
caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase. Several enzymes are
involved in the synthesis of methionine and its derivatives. The digital expression data suggest that the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle becomes more active during
stress since contigs encoding three major enzymes of the
cycle (S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, methionine Smethyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase) are over-represented in FGAS. This pathway can provide SAM, the precursor molecule needed for
nicotianamine biosynthesis. Four different contigs encoding nicotianamine synthase or nicotianamine aminotransferase are over-represented in FGAS. These
enzymes are involved in nicotianamine and phytosiderophores synthesis and were found to be induced under
iron deficiency [24,25]. The SAM cycle also provides the
one carbon precursor for the methylation steps required
for methyltransferase activities. At least 20 different contigs encoding methyltransferases contain ESTs that are
over-represented in FGAS.
Transport activity
During cold acclimation, the cell mobilizes several transport systems to adapt to cold conditions. One of the major

effects of extracellular freezing is the reduced apoplastic
water pressure and the rapid flow of water from the intracellular compartment to the apoplasm. Some of the consequences include the need for water and ion regulation
as well as protection against dehydration. Two different
contigs encoding aquaporins are highly abundant in
FGAS (a contig with 12 ESTs found only in the FGAS dataset and a contig with ESTs over-represented 18-fold).
These proteins likely play an important role in the regulation of the outward water flow. Similarly, several contigs
associated with transport of ions or other small solutes are
more highly represented, such as anion/sugar transporters, major facilitator superfamily antiporters, MATE efflux
family transporters, nitrate transporters, cation exchangers, calcium and zinc transporters, betaine/proline transporters, and amino acid transporters. These different
transporters are potential regulators controlling the flow
of ions and other solutes that become more concentrated
as water is drawn out of the cell during freezing. An interesting transporter activity is the phosphatidylinositol-

phosphatidylcholine transfer protein which can contribute to the turnover of these lipids in the membrane. This
pathway is involved in the accumulation of the compatible solute betaine that was reported to increase tolerance
to drought and freezing [26]. Another mechanism
involved in cell protection against higher ionic content
include the replacement of water with compatible solutes
such glycerol, glucose, sorbitol, proline and betaine. ESTs
encoding hydroquinone glucosyltransferase, an interesting enzyme responsible for the synthesis of arbutin, are
over-represented over 7-fold in the FGAS dataset. Glycosylated hydroquinone is very abundant in freezing and
desiccation tolerant plants. It was suggested to accumulate
up to 100 mM in the resurrection plant Myrothamnus flabellifolia and to increase membrane stability of artificial
liposomes and thylakoids, possibly through the insertion
of the phenol moiety in the phospholipid bilayer [27].
These authors showed that the lipid membrane composition is an important element for the cryoprotective effect
of arbutin. In support of this observation, several contigs

with an over-representation of FGAS ESTs encoding transporters of compatible solutes and lipid modifying
enzymes were identified.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/149

The dehydrins are hydrophilic proteins resistant to heat
denaturation composed largely of repeated amino acid
sequence motifs. They possess regions capable of forming
an amphipathic α-helix. These properties may enable
them to protect cells against freezing damage by stabilizing proteins and membranes during conditions of dehydration [28]. The most studied dehydrins are the WCS120
family, the WCOR410 and the chloroplastic WCS19 dehydrins. Genes encoding these proteins are highly over-represented in the FGAS dataset (Table 4, Table 5, and see
additional file 1: Table 1.xls).

ing components of both the photosystem I (PSI) and the
photosystem II (PSII). Several studies have reported
changes in PSII during cold acclimation [34], The D1 and
D2 proteins were shown to be sensitive to excess energy
and to turn over more rapidly at low temperature and
high light [35]. ESTs encoding the D2 protein are overexpressed by 7.2-fold in FGAS suggesting that the PSII
adapts to low temperature conditions. On the other hand,
the transcript encoding PSII Z is less represented in FGAS.
A reduced amount of this protein may lead to a reduction
in active antennas and allow a reduction in electron flow
towards the PSII. ESTs encoding two other proteins of the
PSII complex are over-represented (29.8 kDa and 20 kDa
protein). These proteins belong to the same PsbP protein
family which has 4 members in Arabidopsis. Recent results
using RNAi have shown that this lumen protein is both
essential and quantitatively related to PSII efficiency and
stability. This suggests that their over-expression could
improve electron flow through PSII [36,37]. Another limiting factor in the electron flow is the availability of CO2.
Several contigs with over-represented ESTs in the FGAS
dataset encode carbonic anhydrase (carbonic anhydrase
chloroplast precursor, dioscorin class A and nectarin III).
This enzyme is known in C4 plants to concentrate CO2 at
its site of fixation. In the C3 plant wheat, this enzyme was
previously shown to be modulated by nitrogen deficiency
to maintain optimal CO2 concentrations [38]. The overexpression of this enzyme could thus help to efficiently
use the CO2 and available light energy at low temperature.
Failure to dissipate excess light energy could lead to oxidative stress, which needs to be controlled. A contig encoding a putative serine hydroxymethyltransferase is overrepresented in the FGAS dataset. Hydroxymethyltransferases play a critical role in controlling the cell damage
caused by abiotic stresses such as high light and salt, supporting the notion that photorespiration forms part of the
dissipatory mechanisms of plants to minimize production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chloroplast
and to mitigate oxidative damage [39].

Photosynthesis
During cold acclimation, the chloroplast continues to
receive as much light as at normal temperature but its
thermal biochemical reactions are reduced. This results in
an excess of light energy whereby electrons accumulate
mostly in QA [34]. The reduced capacity to transfer electrons through PSII requires metabolic adjustments on a
short term basis through redox balance, and communication between the chloroplast and the nucleus to modify
gene expression for adaptation on a longer term basis.
Freezing tolerant plants were previously shown to better
cope with photoinhibition than less tolerant cultivars
[34]. Although the number of genes classified under the
GO "Thylakoids" is only 13, the genes identified indicate
that putative changes in expression occur for genes encod-

Very few studies have documented the modulation of PSI
under stress conditions. The excess light or low temperature can decrease stromal NADP/NADPH ratio and it has
been proposed that the cytochrome b6f complex can be
regulated by the stromal redox potential possibly via a
thioredoxin mediated mechanism (see [40]). The PSI
components are largely integrated and composed of many
subunits making it energetically expensive for the cell to
produce. It has been suggested that cells might modulate
PSI activity by varying the amount of the small and
mobile plastocyanin protein carrying the reducing power
[41]. The over-representation of ESTs encoding this protein in FGAS (represented by 27 ESTs within contig
CL187Contig5) suggests that this PSI electron relay component becomes more active during cold acclimation and

Proteins involved in cryoprotection
One strategy that hardy plants such as wheat use to tolerate subzero temperatures is the accumulation of freezing
tolerance associated proteins such as antifreeze proteins
(AFPs) and dehydrins [28]. AFPs exhibit two related activities in vitro. The first is to increase the difference between
the freezing and melting temperatures of aqueous solutions, a property known as thermal hysteresis. The second
is ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI), where the growth
of large ice crystals is inhibited, thus reducing the possibility of physical damage within frozen tissues [29]. In winter wheat and rye, several AFPs similar to pathogenesisrelated proteins such as chitinases, glucanases, thaumatins and ice recrystallization inhibition proteins were identified [30-32]. Many contigs encoding chitinases, β-1,3glucanases and thaumatin-like proteins contain ESTs that
are over-represented in FGAS. Hincha et al. [33] reported
that different cryoprotective proteins were able to protect
thylakoids from freezing injury in vitro. Wheat ice recrystallization inhibition proteins are partly homologous to,
and were annotated as, phytosulfokine receptors and were
present in several contigs containing ESTs over-expressed
in FGAS.

may be important in relieving the pressure caused by electrons accumulating in QB. The mobile plastocyanin molecule is a limiting factor in the electron transfer from PSII
to PSI. The increased expression of plastocyanin may
result in an increased activity of PSI under low temperature and may help freezing tolerant plants maintain their
energy balance compared to less tolerant plants. We have
previously shown that several proteins involved in
improving photosynthesis, including plastocyanin, are
expressed at low levels under low excitation pressure
(20°C/50 μE) but markedly accumulate when transferred
to 5°C under the same light regime [42]. A mutation in
the PSI-E subunit was also shown to have a great impact
on PSII as it becomes easily affected by photoinhibition
even under low light [43]. Similarly mutants in the PSI-N
subunit, which participates in the docking of PC, are
impaired in PSI activity [44]. The over-representation of
ESTs encoding the PSI-E and PSI-N subunits in the FGAS
dataset could thus provide an integrated response to
reduce photoinhibition. In order to maintain a proper
NADP/NADPH ratio, the malate valve could be activated
to transfer excess reducing power to the cytoplasm [45].
ESTs encoding two PSI components are less abundant in
FGAS. One of these is a subunit of the chloroplastic
NADH dehydrogenase equivalent to the mitochondrial
enzyme. Interestingly, the FRO1 gene was recently shown
to encode the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase counterpart which plays a role in controlling ROS and the ability of Arabidopsis to respond to low temperature [46]. An
excess of ROS in mitochondria was proposed to affect the
induction of CBF transcription factors and cold acclimation. The chloroplastic NADH dehydrogenase may also
affect the ability to induce CBF if the ROS that accumulate
during photoinhibition at low temperature are not detoxified. Tolerant plants may adapt their photosystems to
avoid the accumulation of ROS in chloroplasts, thus
allowing a strong CBF response and a stable induction of
downstream cold-regulated genes. This hypothesis may
explain why tolerant plants are able to maintain a strong

expression of several freezing tolerance-associated genes
while less tolerant plants show transient, reduced expression of these genes at low temperature [1].
Signalling cascades and transcription factors
Among the contigs with an over-representation in FGAS
ESTs, we identified several proteins involved in the synthesis or perception of different hormones. These include
enzymes of the ethylene, auxin and jasmonic acid metabolism; brassinosteroid LRR receptor, receptor-like kinases
CLAVATA2 and PERK1, and phytosulfokine receptor.
Contigs encoding several proteins involved in signalling
cascades were also found such as calcium binding proteins, diacylglycerol kinase, lipid phosphate phosphatase2, inositol 1-monophosphatase, GTP-binding proteins,
MAP kinases and MAPKK, serine/threonine kinase, CIPKlike protein-1, histidine kinase-2, and protein phosphatases 2A and 2C.

The potentially increased activity of the various signalling
pathways is associated with a differential expression of
many families of transcription factors (TF; Table 7). The
results show that at least 220 contigs contain ESTs encoding TF that are over- or under-represented more than twofold in the FGAS dataset. Using a more stringent cut-off
excludes some TF that may not be strongly regulated, but
should also reduce the number of false positives. With a
5-fold cut-off, 151 TF were identified, with 30 of them
being contigs unique to FGAS. The most highly represented TF families are the zinc fingers, WRKY, AP2, Myb
and NAC. Several members of these families were previously identified as being responsive to various stresses.
The most studied members are those of the AP2 family, in
particular the CBF/DREB subfamily. CBF members are
involved in the cold/drought responses [47]. We have
identified 3 different contigs, with a 5-fold over-representation in the FGAS dataset, that contain CBF-like binding
factors and 5 unique FGAS contigs containing at least 3
ESTs (annotated as CBF-like, CBF1-like, CBF3-like, C-

3, CRT/DRE binding factor 2, DRE binding factor-2).
Expression profiling using qRT-PCR has confirmed that
transcripts corresponding to 7 of the 8 contigs are overexpressed at specific time points during cold acclimation
(Sarhan et al. unpublished results). Expression of the CBF
genes in Arabidopsis was shown to be regulated by members of the bHLH family [48]. We have identified 7 contigs
encoding bHLH members that are over-represented by
two-fold, with two of them being over-represented more
than 5-fold (Table 7). However, the genes encoding the
bHLH ICE proteins in Arabidopsis are not cold-induced.
Although the expression pattern with regards to cold
inducibility of the ICE genes could be different between
wheat and Arabidopsis, the isolation of the full length
genes, phylogenetic analysis and expression studies are
required to determine if any of the over-represented
bHLH encode ICE homologs. In addition to the CBFs and
bHLH families, several other TF families may be part of
other stress components associated with abiotic stress
such as drought, salinity, oxidative, etc. Interestingly, several genes that control flowering have also been identified
(FLT, Gigantea, MADS, CO, Aintegumenta). These genes
are most likely associated with the vernalization response

in wheat as was recently shown for TaVRT1 and TaVRT2
[49,50].

Conclusion
The large number of ESTs annotated from FGAS and NSFDuPont datasets represents an important resource for the
wheat community. Digital expression analyses of these
datasets provide an overview of metabolic changes and
specific pathways that are regulated under stress conditions in wheat and other cereals. The information generated will help construct network models of abiotic stress
responses that will facilitate computational predictions
and direct future experimental work like the development
of models such as the "Metabolic pathways of the diseased
potato" [51] or MapMan for the analysis of gene expression data in Arabidopsis [52]. The results could facilitate
the understanding of cellular mechanisms involving
groups of gene products that act in coordination in
response to environmental stimuli.

Methods
A total of eleven different cDNA libraries were prepared
from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) for the FGAS
EST sequencing project and are summarized in Table 1.

Cultivar Norstar was used for Libraries 2 to 6 to represent
various tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. Six subtracted cDNA libraries (suppression subtractive hybridization; SSH), named TaLT2 to TaLT7, were
also prepared from two different wheat lines (CI14106
and PI178383) and cv Norstar as a complementary
approach to isolate differentially expressed transcripts.
The "Library 1" and TaLT1 libraries were not used for the
large scale EST sequencing FGAS project since the former
was not prepared in a Gateway-compatible vector and the
latter was generated to optimize the SSH protocol.

11 days; different developmental stages of spike formation (5 to 50 mm); and different developmental stages of
spike and seed formation after the spikes had emerged
from the flag leaf (visible).

Preparation of the cDNA libraries
Growth conditions
For Libraries 2 and 3, the seeds were germinated in watersaturated vermiculite for 7 days at 20°C and 70% relative
humidity under an irradiance of 200 μmol m-2 sec-1 and a
15-hr photoperiod. At the end of this period, the aerial
parts (crowns and leaves) and roots of control plants were
sampled and individually frozen. Cold acclimation was
performed by subjecting germinated seedlings to a temperature of 4°C with a 12-hr photoperiod for 1, 23 and 53
days under an irradiance of 200 μmol m-2 sec-1. Seedlings
were watered with a nutrient solution (0.5 g/l 20:20:20;
N:P:K). Salt stress was induced by watering with the nutrient solution containing 200 mM NaCl for 0.5, 3 and 6-hr.
Aerial parts of cold-acclimated plants were sampled for
Library 2 and roots of both cold-acclimated and saltstressed plants were sampled for Library 3.

For SSH libraries TaLT2 to TaLT7, plants were germinated
as described for Library 2 except that the light intensity
was 275 μm m-2 s-1 and the cold treatment was performed
at 2°C for 1, 21 or 49 days. Crown sections (1 cm) were
harvested individually for each time point.

For Library 4, two different water stress conditions were
used. For bench experiments, seeds were germinated for 7
days as described for Library 2. At the end of this period,
plants were removed from vermiculite and left at room
temperature on the table without water for 1, 2, 3 and 4
days before sampling. For growth chamber experiments,
seeds were germinated in a water-saturated potting mix
(50% black earth and 50% ProMix) for 7 days under an
irradiance of 200 μmol m-2 sec-1. The temperature was
maintained at 20°C with a 15-hr photoperiod under a relative humidity of 70%. After this period, watering of
plants was stopped. Four time points were sampled during a two weeks period; the first after wilting was observed
and the last, two weeks later, and consisted of living
crown and stem tissues (leaf tissue was yellow and thus
not included in the sampled material).
For Library 5, seeds were germinated for 7 days and coldtreated for 49 days (full vernalization) as described for
Library 2. Seedlings were then potted in water-saturated
potting mix and transferred to flower inducing conditions
(20°C and a 15-hr photoperiod). Tissues were sampled as
follows: 1 cm crown sections after 30 days of cold treatment; 1 cm vernalized (49-day cold-treated) crown sections that were exposed to flower inducing conditions for

For Library 6, seeds were germinated for 7 days and coldtreated as described for Library 2, except that cold treatments were performed for short time points (1, 3 and 6
hr) in the light or in the dark. Crown sections (1 cm) and
green leaf tissues were harvested individually for each
time point and for both exposure conditions.

RNA purification and cDNA synthesis
For Libraries 2 and 3, total RNA was isolated using the
phenol method [53] except that the heating step at 60°C
was omitted, whereas the TRI Reagent method (Sigma)
was used for Libraries 4 to 6 and TRIzol (Life Technologies) was used for the TaLT libraries. For Libraries 2 to 6,
poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA samples
using two cycles of an oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity batchenrichment procedure [53] whereas PolyA Pure (Ambion)
was used for the TaLT libraries. Total RNAs were subsequently used for cDNA synthesis. For all libraries, cDNA
synthesis was initiated with a NotI primer-adaptor
(GCGGCCGCCCT15) using the 'SuperScript™ Plasmid
System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and
Cloning' kit (Invitrogen). For Libraries 3 to 6, methylated
dCTP was added to the first strand reaction mix to prevent
cleavage by the NotI restriction enzyme used for directional cloning. For Library 6, the 'GeneRacer' kit (Invitrogen) was used prior to first strand synthesis to
dephosphorylate truncated and non-mRNAs, remove the
5' cap structure from intact mRNA, and ligate the gene
racer RNA oligo 5'-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3'. The precipitation steps in the kit were replaced by the RNeasy Mini
Protocol for RNA Cleanup (QIAGEN). For this library, the
second strand cDNA was synthesized using Pfx DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen) and the primer 5'-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3' homologous to the RNA oligo.
The 'SuperScript™ Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning' kit (Invitrogen) was
used for the remaining steps of the construction of Libraries 2 to 6 except that the precipitation steps without yeast
carrier tRNA were replaced by the QIAquick PCR purification procedure (QIAGEN). For the TaLT2, 3, 6 and 7
libraries, the Nitro-pyrrole anchored oligo-dT priming
technique was used [54]. For TaLT4 and TaLT5 libraries,
the SMART cDNA (Clontech) priming kit was used.

Suppression Subtractive Hybridization
For the TaLT libraries, SSH was performed on the RNAs
isolated from crowns. For the TaLT2 library, RNA from
CI14106 cold-acclimated for 1 day was used as tester RNA
and subtracted by SSH against the driver RNA from cv
Norstar cold-acclimated for 21 and 49 days (equal
amounts of cDNAs were pooled together before subtraction). For TaLT3, 21 and 49-day cold-acclimated CI14106
was subtracted against cv Norstar cold-acclimated for 1
day. For TaLT4, 1 day cold-acclimated PI178383 was subtracted against 21 and 49 days cold-acclimated cv Norstar.
For TaLT5, 21 and 49 days cold-acclimated PI178383 was
subtracted against 1 day cold-acclimated Norstar. For
TaLT6, 1 day cold-acclimated CI14106 was subtracted
against non-acclimated CI14106. For TaLT7, 21 and 49
days cold-acclimated CI14106 was subtracted against
non-acclimated CI14106.
Cloning into vectors
For Libraries 2 to 6, a SalI adaptor (GTCGACCCACGCGTCCG) was ligated to the 5' end of the cDNAs
synthesized with the NotI primer-adaptor to allow for
directional cloning. The first two (for Libraries 3 to 5) or
five (for Libraries 2 and 6) fractions eluting from size fractionation column chromatography and containing
cDNAs larger than 0.5 kb were pooled for ligation with
the vector. About 15 ng of SalI-NotI-digested cDNAs was
ligated with 50 ng of the pCMV.SPORT6 vector, which
contains the attB1 and attB2 site-specific recombination
sites flanking the multiple cloning sites. Therefore, clones
isolated from these libraries can be rapidly transferred
into Gateway™ destination vectors using site-specific
recombination (Invitrogen). The libraries were then transformed into ElectroMAX™ DH10B cells (Invitrogen) for

of SSH were non-directionally cloned into the pGEM-T
vector and transformed into DH5α cells.
Assessment of library quality and selection of clones for
sequencing
Around 6.0 × 106 primary clones were obtained for Libraries 2 to 6. To determine the average cDNA size, 96 clones
were randomly chosen from different libraries and the
plasmids digested and characterized on agarose gels. Average insert sizes were estimated at 1300 bp (Library 2: 14%
of inserts below 750 bp, 59% between 750 and 1500 bp,
and 27% above 1500 bp), 1560 bp (Library 3: 10% below
750 bp, 44% between 750 and 1500 bp, and 46% above
1500 bp), and 1100 bp (Library 6: 17% below 750 bp,
68% between 750 and 1500 bp, and 15% above 1500
bp). Since all libraries contain an average of 6 million different clones, this collection represents an important
resource to isolate full length clones for which only truncated cDNAs are available. To reduce the number of ESTs
representing highly expressed genes, Libraries 2 to 6 were
hybridized to 32P-labelled cDNAs from non-acclimated
plants. Colonies showing with the weakest hybridization
signals were picked for sequencing.
Bioinformatics
Trimming high quality sequences
Sequence tracefiles were obtained from the FGAS project
(110,544 ESTs) and from the NSF (82,332 ESTs; [55]) and
DuPont (154,171 ESTs) collections. The latter two collections comprise EST sequences derived from many cDNA
libraries prepared from various wheat RNA sources. All
sequences were processed as follows. Quality score

repeats were rejected. A repeat was defined as a minimum
word size of 4 identical bases with a maximum of 1 error.
RepeatMasker2 was used with Repeat DB to mask regions
that could eventually bias the assembly. All information
pertaining to library details, sequences and data quality
scores were stored in a mySQL database. After filtering,
269,562 cleaned ESTs were retained for assembly (73,521
ESTs from FGAS, 68,886 ESTs from NSF and 127,155 ESTs
from DuPont).

sequences were obtained from tracefiles using PHRED
[56,57]. Only sequences with mean Q≥20 were retained.
Poly(A) or poly(T) regions with length = 14 (± 2 errors)
were trimmed and all sequences containing more than
one poly(A) and/or poly(T) sequences were flagged as
putative chimeras. SeqClean3 with generic Univec DB as
well as Lucy4 (using pCMV.SPORT6 and pBlueScript II
splice sites) were used with the default settings in an iterative manner. This recursive approach proved more efficient in removing vector and linker sequences, and low
quality regions than using either one only once. All resulting high quality sequences were then re-checked for lowcomplexity and all sequences containing more that 50%

Clustering, assembly and annotation
Clustering was performed to reduce the redundancy of the
dataset and increase the overall quality of the derived consensus sequences. When a small set of sequences (FGAS
73,521 quality-filtered sequences) was used, the clustering performed well through TGICL and d2_cluster. However, when the NSF and DuPont data (196,041
sequences) were added, aberrant large clusters were
obtained. This is presumably due to undetected chimeras,
multi-domain proteins and the transitive closure technique applied by these applications. These large clusters
(38 k sequences for TGICL and 25 k for d2_cluster) contained many unrelated sequences and were difficult to
assemble, yielding many incongruent and low quality
contigs. To avoid such artifacts, a cluster breaking strategy
was used. First, all sequences that could be contained in
other ESTs were removed, thereby reducing the dataset to
parent sequences. These sequences were then BLASTed
against themselves and results were parsed to extract the evalues in order to build an adjacency matrix. The distance
(d) between the sequences was calculated based on the
level of similarity established using BLAST e-value where
d = 100/-log (e-value). Two parent sequences were considered to be part of the same cluster when the BLASTN identity result between them was greater than or equal to 96%.
GRAPH9 was used to flag bridges (articulation points
where the removal of an EST breaks the link between subclusters) and manually split the large graph into distinct
smaller sub-graphs. Other suspicious clusters that were
not automatically detected were manually investigated
and split when required (Figure 4a). Child ESTs, removed
in the first stage were then incorporated into the cluster
containing the parent sequence. For example, the largest
cluster was broken down using the approach described
above and yielded 250 sub-clusters, with the largest being
of 6 k sequences (Figure 4b). TGICL and d2_cluster results
were compared using randomly chosen clusters that were
re-assembled using either clustering tools. It was observed
that TGICL had a higher tendency of joining similar genes
and falsely splitting sequences from the same gene, thus
indicating that d2_cluster was a more reliable clustering
tool in our case.

Both CAP3 [58] and PHRAP were tested to assemble the
sequences. CAP3 was used on TGICL results using the set-

Breaking strategy of large clusters
Breaking strategy of large clusters. A breaking strategy was used to reduce the size of large clusters. Each sequence in a
cluster was BLASTed against the others and e-values were used to build an adjacency matrix (see Materials and Methods). For
example, an e-100 value will result in a distance of 1 cm between two sequences. Only values below e-25 were used for graphical display. GRAPH9 was used to flag bridges (articulation points where an EST links two potential sub-clusters) and manually
split a cluster into distinct sub-clusters. A) Example of a cluster region where specific ESTs (in red) can be manually transferred
to sub-clusters (based on the smallest e-value). B) Example of a cluster region that could not be broken into sub-clusters due
to the complex interrelations between ESTs.

tings that appeared satisfactory when assembling barley
EST sequences [7] while PHRAP was used to assemble
d2_cluster results using the default parameters. The first
method generated ~32 k contigs while the latter produced
over 50 k contigs. The first approach gave results more
consistent with the Unigene and TIGR Wheat Gene Index
assembly data with respect to contig number, suggesting
that PHRAP was less appropriate for assembly of the large
dataset used in this study. The total number of singletons
and singlets in both cases was similar; 39 k for PHRAP
(14% of all ESTs) vs. 42 k for CAP3 (15.5% of all ESTs)
and the percentage was close to that found in TIGR
(13.3% of all ESTs). Singletons are defined as unique
sequences that could not be assembled in a cluster
whereas singlets are unique sequences that were assembled in a cluster but could not be assembled in a contig.
Based on the TGICL and d2_cluster comparison and on
the number of contigs obtained with CAP3 and PHRAP,
we chose d2_cluster and CAP3 as the clustering and
assembly tools for this project.
We used different annotation tools to increase the
number of annotated sequences. The unique assembled
sequences produced in our study were annotated after
translation using prot4EST and then BLASTed (BLASTX)
against a GO-annotated database. All the sequences that
did not show sufficient similarity to be functionally clas-

sified with this method were investigated with AutoFact
where sequences are BLASTed against other complementary databases (ex. PFAM, KEGG, Ribosomal Sequences
database) having GO details.
Digital expression analysis
The relative abundance (digital expression) of FGAS ESTs
was analysed as follows: 1) among the contigs containing
EST sequences present in both the FGAS dataset and NSFDuPont dataset, abundance was expressed as a ratio of
FGAS ESTs (without SSH ESTs) to NSF-DuPont ESTs, after
correction for the size (total number of ESTs) in each dataset; 2) contigs that contained only FGAS ESTs were analyzed separately; 3) SSH EST abundance was compared
between similar SSH libraries to determine if common
ESTs can be identified; and 4) unique SSH contigs were
identified as these could represent new genes expressed
during cold acclimation.
Identification of homologous genes regulated by stress in
Arabidopsis
The 2,637 putative wheat stress-regulated genes identified
in our study were BLASTed (TBLASTX) against the Arabidopsis proteins TAIR database [12] using a cut-off e-value
of e-25. The Protein ID of the homologous Arabidopsis
proteins were used to identify those that are represented
on the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array and the MWG Bio-
