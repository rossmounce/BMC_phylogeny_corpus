Abstract
Background: Diverse TR and IG repertoires are generated by V(D)J somatic recombination.
Genomic studies have been pivotal in cataloguing the V, D, J and C genes present in the various TR/
IG loci and describing how duplication events have expanded the number of these genes. Such
studies have also provided insights into the evolution of these loci and the complex mechanisms
that regulate TR/IG expression. In this study we analyze the sequence of the third bovine genome
assembly to characterize the germline repertoire of bovine TRB genes and compare the
organization, evolution and regulatory structure of the bovine TRB locus with that of humans and
mice.
Results: The TRB locus in the third bovine genome assembly is distributed over 5 scaffolds,
extending to ~730 Kb. The available sequence contains 134 TRBV genes, assigned to 24 subgroups,
and 3 clusters of DJC genes, each comprising a single TRBD gene, 5–7 TRBJ genes and a single
TRBC gene. Seventy-nine of the TRBV genes are predicted to be functional. Comparison with the
human and murine TRB loci shows that the gene order, as well as the sequences of non-coding
elements that regulate TRB expression, are highly conserved in the bovine. Dot-plot analyses
demonstrate that expansion of the genomic TRBV repertoire has occurred via a complex and
extensive series of duplications, predominantly involving DNA blocks containing multiple genes.
These duplication events have resulted in massive expansion of several TRBV subgroups, most
notably TRBV6, 9 and 21 which contain 40, 35 and 16 members respectively. Similarly, duplication
has lead to the generation of a third DJC cluster. Analyses of cDNA data confirms the diversity of
the TRBV genes and, in addition, identifies a substantial number of TRBV genes, predominantly
from the larger subgroups, which are still absent from the genome assembly. The observed gene
duplication within the bovine TRB locus has created a repertoire of phylogenetically diverse
functional TRBV genes, which is substantially larger than that described for humans and mice.
Conclusion: The analyses completed in this study reveal that, although the gene content and
organization of the bovine TRB locus are broadly similar to that of humans and mice, multiple
duplication events have led to a marked expansion in the number of TRB genes. Similar expansions
in other ruminant TR loci suggest strong evolutionary pressures in this lineage have selected for
the development of enlarged sets of TR genes that can contribute to diverse TR repertoires.

Background

Diverse αβTR repertoires are crucial to the maintenance of
effective T cell-mediated immunity [1]. Estimates based
on direct measurement indicate that in humans and mice
individuals express a repertoire of approximately 2 × 107
[2] and 2 × 106 [3] unique αβTRs respectively. As with the
other antigen-specific receptors (IG of B cells and γδTRs of
γδT cells) diversity is generated in lymphocytic precursors
by somatic recombination of discontiguous variable (V),
diversity (D – TRB chains but not TRA chains) and joining
(J) genes to form the membrane-distal variable domains.
Diversity is derived from both the different permutations
of V(D)J genes used to form the TRA and TRB chains
expressed by individual thymocytes (combinatorial diversity) and also by the activity of terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase and exonuclease at the V(D)J junction during
recombination (junctional diversity). Consequently,
much of the diversity is focused in the third complementarity determining region (CDR3), which is encoded by
the V(D)J junction and forms the most intimate association with the antigenic peptide component of the peptideMHC (pMHC) ligand of αβTRs, whereas the CDR1 and
CDR2 of the TRA and TRB chains, that predominantly
interact with the MHC, are encoded within the germline V
genes [4,5].
TRB chain genes are located in the TRB locus, which in
humans is ~620 Kb long and situated on chromosome 7
and in mice is ~700 Kb and located on chromosome 6 [68]. In both species, the organisation of TRB genes is similar, with a library of TRBV genes positioned at the 5' end
and 2 DJC clusters (each composed of a single TRBD, 6–7
TRBJ and a single TRBC gene) followed by a single TRBV
gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation located
at the 3'end [9,10]. The germline repertoire of TRBV genes
in humans is composed of 65 genes belonging to 30 subgroups (genes with > 75% nucleotide identity), whilst in
mice the repertoire comprises 35 genes belonging to 31
subgroups [10-12] The disparity between the number of
TRBV genes in the 2 species is the result of multiple duplication events within the human TRB locus, most of which
have involved tandem duplication of blocks of DNA
(homology units) containing genes from more than one
subgroup [10,13].

nation is prohibited by the 'beyond 12/23' phenomenon
[15-17]. As with other antigen-specific receptor loci,
recombination in the TRB locus is under strict lineage-,
stage- and allele-specific regulation associated with control of RAG accessibility to RSs mediated through alterations in chromatin structure (the 'accessibility
hypothesis') [18-20]. Numerous studies have shown that
both the TRB enhancer (Eβ) and transcriptional promoters within the TRB locus serve as RAG accessibility control
elements, playing a critical role in regulating chromatin
structure and therefore recombination of TRB genes [2127].
Current knowledge of the TRB gene repertoires of agriculturally important artiodactyl species (e.g. pigs, cattle and
sheep) is limited. Published analyses of rearranged TRB
transcripts have demonstrated the expression of 19 TRBV
subgroups in pigs [28,29], 13 subgroups in sheep [30] and
17 subgroups in cattle, some of which have undergone
extensive duplication [31-34]. Information on the
genomic organisation of the TRB loci is predominantly
restricted to the DJC region, which in the pig was found to
be composed of 2 tandemly arranged DJC clusters [35]
but in sheep contained 3 tandemly arranged DJC clusters
[36]. Preliminary analysis of a BAC clone corresponding
to part of the DJC region indicates that in cattle the DJC
region may also consist of 3 DJC clusters [37].
Sequencing of the complete TRB loci in human and mice
allowed the repertoire of TRB genes in these species to be
fully characterised and also permitted analysis of the
organisation, regulation and evolution of this immunologically important locus [9,10]. In this study we have
used the sequence of the third bovine genome assembly
(Btau_3.1) to further study the bovine TRB repertoire and
TRB locus. Although the sequence of the TRB locus is
incomplete, the results reveal that duplication within the
locus has been prolific leading to a massive expansion of
TRBV gene numbers and the generation of a third DJC
cluster. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the genomic
organisation of the TRB locus and the non-coding elements that regulate TRB expression are highly conserved
in cattle when compared to that of humans and mice.

Results
V(D)J recombination is initiated by site-specific DNA
cleavage at recombination signal sequences (RSs) mediated by enzymes encoded by recombination activating
genes (RAG) 1 and 2 [14]. RSs comprise conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by spacers of
either 12 bp (12-RS – located 5'to TRBD and TRBJ genes)
or 23 bp (23-RS – located 3' to TRBV and TRBD genes).
Correct V(D)J assembly is achieved as recombination can
only occur between genes flanked with RS of dissimilar
length (the '12/23 rule') and direct TRBV/TRBJ recombi-

Extensive duplication has generated a large germline
repertoire of bovine TRBV genes
A total of 134 TRBV genes, distributed over 5 scaffolds was
identified in Btau_3.1 (Additional File 1). Consistent with
data from fluorescent in situ hybridisation studies [38],
the majority of the TRBV genes were located on 2 scaffolds
(Chr4.003.105 [91 TRBV] and Chr4.003.108 [21 TRBV])
mapped to chromosome 4, whilst the remaining genes
were located on 3 scaffolds (ChrUn.003.1717 [18 TRBV],
ChrUn003.4367 [3 TRBV] and ChrUn.003.12588 [1

counterpart and were assigned to subgroups named
according to the orthologous human subgroup (Table 1).
The single bovine TRBV gene that lacked significant
homology to any of the human TRBV genes displayed
76.6% identity with the murine TRBV1 gene (which lacks
a human orthologue) and was placed in subgroup TRBVX.
The subgroups thus established generally adhered to the
definition of members within a subgroup exhibiting >
75% nucleotide sequence identity. However, the single
member of the TRBV10 subgroup displayed > 75% identity to all of the TRBV6 genes and the identity between
members of the TRBV9 and TRBV5 subgroups was often >
75% (data not shown). Conversely a single member of the
TRBV19 subgroup (TRBV19f) showed only 63.0–64.8%

Each TRBV gene is composed of i) a short leader (L) exon,
generally of ~50 bp, ii) a single intron of between ~80 and
~500 bp and iii) a variable (V) exon of ~300 bp, immediately flanked at the 3'end with a 23-RS. Comparison of the
nucleotide sequence of each of the bovine TRBV genes
with human TRBV gene sequences, revealed maximum
levels of similarity between the species ranging from
71.8% to 83.15% for all except one of the bovine TRBV
genes. On the basis of these results, bovine TRBV genes
were considered orthologues of their most similar human

nucleotide identity with the other members of this subgroup.
Of the 24 bovine subgroups present in the genome assembly, 11 have multiple members. Subgroups TRBV6, 9 and
21 have all undergone substantial expansion, having 40,
35 and 16 members respectively – together representing
68% of the total Btau_3.1 TRBV gene repertoire. Southern
blot analysis corroborates the presence of large numbers
of TRBV6 and 9 genes in the genome (Figure 1).
A prominent feature of the genomic organisation of TRBV
genes (Figure 2) is that members of expanded subgroups
are generally intercalated with members of other
expanded subgroups in a recurrent pattern. Thus, a 165
KB region of Chr4.003.105 and virtually all of scaffold
ChrUn.003.1717 are composed of alternating TRBV6 and
9 genes (reflected in the similarity in the patterns of larger
bands (> 4.3 Kb) obtained in southern blots of genomic
DNA when hybridised with TRBV9- and TRBV6-specific
probes in Figure 1), whilst the 3'end of Chr4.003.105 and
the 5' end of Chr4.003.108 contain repeated units comprising TRBV18, 19, 20 and 21 genes. Dot-plot analyses
indicate that this organisation has arisen through a series
of complex tandem duplication events within the regions
in which TRBV9 and 6 genes and TRBV18, 19, 20 and 21

genes are located (Figure 3). Six homology units, ranging
in size from ~7 Kb to ~31 Kb and encompassing from 1 to
11 TRBV genes were identified. Three of these homology
units (represented by the orange, dark blue and black bars
in Figure 2) have undergone multiple (2–3) duplications:
variation in the length of the different copies of these
homology units (represented by broken lines in Figure 2),
suggests that either i) distinct iterations of a duplication
event have involved different components of the homology unit or ii) the different copies have been subject to different post-duplication deletions.
The levels of nucleotide identity between TRBV genes in
corresponding positions in homology units is frequently
high: 12 pairs of TRBV6 genes, 11 pairs of TRBV9 and 1
pair each of TRBV19 and TRBV20 have identical coding
sequences whilst 1 pair of TRBV4 genes and 3 pairs of
TRBV21 as well as 4 triplets of TRBV6 and 4 triplets of
TRBV9 genes have > 97% sequence identity in the coding
region.
Duplication has expanded the repertoire of TRBD, TRBJ
and TRBC genes in the bovine genome
A total of 3 TRBD, 18 TRBJ and 3 TRBC genes were identified in the assembly (Additional File 1). These genes were
all located within a ~26 Kb region of scaffold
Chr4.003.108 and organised into 3 tandemly arranged
clusters, each of ~7 Kb length and composed of a single
TRBD gene, 5-7 TRBJ genes and a single TRBC gene (Figure
2). Dot-plot analysis reveals the presence of a third DJC
cluster is attributable to duplication of a ~7 Kb region, one
copy of which incorporates TRBC1, TRBD2 and the TRBJ2
cluster whilst the other copy incorporates TRBC2, TRBD3
and the TRBJ3 cluster (Figure 4). Numerous interruptions
in the line representing the duplicated region indicate that
there has been significant post-duplication deletion/insertion related modification of the duplicated region.

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the
3 TRBD and 18 TRBJ genes as well as the flanking RS are
shown in Figure 5a and 5b respectively. The 13 bp
(TRBD1) or 16 bp (TRBD2 and 3) TRBD genes are G-rich
and encode at least one glycine in all 3 potential reading
frames with the exception of the 3rd reading frame of
TRBD1. The TRBJ genes range in size from 43 bp to 59 bp
in length and all encode the canonical FGXG amino acid
motif that defines TRBJ genes.
As with all mammalian TRBC genes so far characterised,
bovine TRBC1 and TRBC3 genes are composed of 4 exons,
3 introns and a 3'UTR region. The structure of the TRBC2
gene is anticipated to be the same but due to a region of
undetermined sequence between exons 1 and 3 we were
unable to identify exon 2. The exon nucleotide sequences
of TRBC1 and 3 are very similar (97%), resulting in the

with somatic recombination) are also predicted to be
non-functional (Figure 5). Thus, the functional repertoire
comprises 79 (59%) TRBV genes (comprising 66 unique

TRBC2 is predicted to encode a product identical to that
of TRBC1. In contrast to the high levels of pairwise identity between the exonic nucleotide sequences of all 3
TRBC genes, the nucleotide sequences of the 3rd intron
and the 3'UTR regions of TRBC3 show low identity with
TRBC1 and 2, whereas the latter two genes show a high
level of identity (Figure 6b). The similarity in the lengths
of TRBD2 and 3, the phylogenetic clustering of TRBJ2 and
TRBJ3 genes in corresponding genomic positions (Figure

and 3'UTRs of TRBC1 and 2 all reflect the duplication history of the DJC region as described in Figure 4.
The repertoire of functional TRBV, TRBD and TRBJ genes
available for somatic recombination is large and
phylogenetically diverse
Computational analysis was used to predict the functional
competency of the TRBV, TRBD and TRBJ genes present in
the genome assembly. Fifty-five (41%) of the TRBV genes
identified are predicted to encode pseudogenes (Additional File 2), whilst TRBJ1-2 (which has a 1 bp deletion

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the repertoire of
functional TRBV genes is diverse (Figure 8), with representatives in each of the 6 phylogenetic groups (A-F)
described previously in humans and mice [13,39]. The
phylogenetic groupings were supported by high (99%),
bootstrap values (PB), with the exception of group A (PB =
76%). Maximum likelihood analysis using a variety of
nucleotide models provides essentially similar phylogenetic clustering (data not shown) indicating the reliability
of the tree presented in Figure 8. The extensive intermingling of murine, human and bovine TRBV subgroups is
consistent with the establishment of distinct subgroups
having occurred prior to mammalian radiation. Conversely, the formation of distinct clades of TRBV genes of
orthologous subgroups from different species (e.g. TRBV6
genes from human and bovine form distinct clades) indicates that duplication within subgroups has predominantly occurred post-speciation. Despite this and the
substantial disparity in the number of functional TRBV
genes present in the 3 species, the distribution amongst
the different phylogenetic groups is similar (Figure 8b).
Phylogenetic groups C and F form a minor component of
the functional TRBV repertoire, whilst the contributions
from groups B and D are also fairly modest. In contrast,
group E and to an even greater extent group A, are overrepresented, together representing between 61.9% (in the
mouse) and 81.6% (in humans) of the total functional
repertoire.
Phylogenetic analysis resolves the functional TRBJ genes
in human, mice and Btau_3.1 into 12 groups (Figure 7).
With the exception of group 8, each group is supported by
high PB values and is composed of orthologues that share
a conserved order in the genome; consistent with the
duplication history of the DJC region, TRBJ genes from
both the 2nd and 3rd bovine DJC clusters group together
with the respective genes from the 2nd murine and human
DJC clusters. Group 8, which contains TRBJ2-3, human
and murine TRBJ2-4 and bovine TRBJ3-3 and 3–4 genes is
only supported by a PB value of 57%. The diversity of the
functional TRBJ repertoire across the 3 species is comparable, with humans having functional genes in each of the
12 phylogenetic groups whilst in both mice and Btau_3.1
only 2 groups lack functional members: groups 3 (TRBJ1-

Using a variety of RT-PCR based methods, our group has
isolated and sequenced over 1000 partial TRB chain
cDNAs [31-33,40]. With a few exceptions, these cDNA
sequences incorporated > 230 bp of the TRBV gene (i.e.
over 80% of the sequence encoding the mature peptide)

and in some cases the full length of the TRBV gene. Based
on the assumption that sequences sharing ≤ 97% nucleotide identity represent distinct genes, as applied in studies of human and murine TRBV genes [41,42], our
analysis identified 86 putative unique TRBV genes belonging to 22 subgroups (Table 1). Analysis of the sequence
data available for each cDNA sequence indicated that only
one of these genes is predicted to be non-functional

The organisation of genes within Chr4.003.105 and
Chr4.003.108 shows marked conservation in order with
that of genes at the 5' and 3'ends of the human TRB locus
respectively (Figure 9). Genes belonging to orthologous
TRBV subgroups show a similar order although in some
areas substantial tandem duplication has obscured synteny at the level of individual genes (e.g. the TRBV3-13
regions in the human TRB locus and on Chr4.003.105).
TRBVX, the only bovine TRBV gene that has no human
orthologue, is located in a position (between the
dopamine-β-hydroxylase-like (DβH-like) gene and
trypsinogen genes) syntenic with its murine orthologue
(mTRBV1). As mentioned previously, synteny is also
shown in the organisation of TRBJ genes, with human and
bovine orthologues occupying conserved positions in
their relative clusters.

Human TRB locus

In contrast to the TRBV situation, all TRBD and TRBC
genes and the 16 functional TRBJ genes identified in
Btau_3.1 have been found expressed in cDNA. In addition, a functional allele of the TRBJ1-2 gene, which compared to the genomic sequence has a 1 bp insertion that
restores the ORF encoding the FGXG motif (Figure 5), has
been identified. No evidence for further TRBD, TRBJ or
TRBC genes was found from cDNA analysis, suggesting
the repertoire of these genes in Btau_3.1 is complete.

at least some of the cDNAs fall into the latter category, is
supported by the identification of sequences exhibiting
100% identity with 4 of these cDNA sequences, in the
genome project's WGS trace archive (data not shown).
Conversely, 40 (63.5%) of the 63 predicted functional
genes identified in these subgroups within the genome
did not have cDNA sequences displaying 100% nucleotide identity. Twenty-two of these (34.9%) showed 98–
99% identity with cDNA sequences, whilst the remaining
18 (28.6%) exhibited < 97% identity to any of the cDNA
sequences. In contrast to the findings with multi-member
subgroups, cDNAs corresponding to 9 subgroups with
single members identified in the genome showed 100%
identity with their respective genome sequence. Thus,
comparison with cDNA evidence suggests that substantial
numbers of genes, predominantly from the large subgroups, are still absent from Btau_3.1.

member 5, TRPV6 and kell blood group glycoprotein
(kell) loci flanking the 3'end of the human TRB locus all
have bovine orthologues in syntenic positions on the 2
scaffolds.
Although fluorescent in situ hybridisation studies have
previously shown that the position of the TRB locus with
respect to the blue cone pigment (BCP) and chloride
channel protein 1 (CLCN1) genes are conserved between
ruminants and humans [46], this analysis shows for the
first time the high levels of synteny between human and
bovine orthologues both within and adjacent to the TRB
locus. Extrapolation of this synteny predicts that
Chr4.003.105 and Chr4.003.108 (in reverse complement) should be juxtaposed on chromosome 4, whilst
Chr4.003.106, which contains bovine orthologues to
numerous genes that in humans are telomeric to the TRB
locus (including CLCN1) should be located 3' to
Chr4.003.108 and Chr4.003.107, which contains a
bovine orthologue to the acylglycerol kinase (AGK) gene
that in humans lies centromeric to the TRB locus, should
be positioned 5' to Chr4.003.105. This location of
Chr4.003.106 has also been predicted by clone pairedend analysis (data not shown).
RS and regulatory elements sequences are conserved in the
bovine TRB locus
The RS sequences of the bovine TRBV, TRBJ and TRBD
genes show a high degree of similarity to canonical RS
sequences defined for the corresponding human and
murine genes (Figure 10). In the bovine TRBV 23-RS
sequences the CACAG of the heptamer and a poly-A
stretch in the centre of the nonamer show a high degree of
intra- and inter-species conservation. Although conservation of the spacer is less marked, the CTGCA sequence
proximal to the heptamer is reasonably well conserved
and similar to that of humans. Despite more limited conservation, the 8 bp proximal to the nonamer also displays
a degree of cross-species similarity. Similarly, the bovine
TRBJ RS exhibits intra- and inter-species conservation of
the first 3 bp (CAC) of the heptamer sequence and a polyA stretch in the nonamer. Conservation in the spacer is
limited but overrepresentation of G at the position 6 bp
from the heptamer and C 4 bp from the nonamer is seen
in both the bovine and human.

We identified a 187 bp sequence ~8.7 Kb 3' to the TRBC3
gene that displays high nucleotide similarity with the
sequences of the enhancers (Eβ) identified in the murine
(76.2%) and human (78.3%) TRB loci [47-49]. Sequences
of the protein binding sites described in the Eβs of
humans (Tβ2-4) and mice (βE1-6) are well conserved in
the aligned bovine sequence (Figure 11a); several of the
transcription binding sites shown to be functionally
important in the regulation in Eβ function [47-50], such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/192

as the GATA-binding site in βE1/Tβ2 and the κE2-binding
motif in βE3 are absolutely conserved, whilst others (such
as he CRE in βE2/Tβ2) show minimal sequence divergence. In contrast, the sequence of the TRBD1 promoter
(PDβ1), which includes the ~300 bp directly upstream of
the TRBD1 gene and has been well defined in the mouse
[51,52], displays a more limited nucleotide identity
(59.2%) with the bovine sequence. As shown in Figure
11b, some transcription factor binding sites demonstrated
to be important for PDβ1 function (SP-1 and GATA) in
mice and/or humans are absent from the bovine
sequence, whereas others (TATA box, AP-1 and Ikaros/Lyf1) have been well conserved [51-53].
We were also able to identify a conserved cAMP responsive element (CRE) motif (AGTGAxxTGA) in the ~80–120
bp upstream sequence of 57 (42.6%) of the bovine TRBV
genes (Figure 11c). This motif is found within conserved
decamer sequences in the promoter regions of some
murine and human TRBV genes [54] and has been shown
to specifically bind a splice variant of a CRE binding protein preferentially expressed in the thymus [55]. In general, the CRE motif has been found in bovine genes that
are members of subgroups that are orthologous to the
human TRBV subgroups in which the CRE motif is also
found [10].

Discussion
Sequencing of the human and murine TRB loci has
defined the repertoire of TRB genes in these species as well
as provided insights into the organisation, evolution and
regulation of this immunologically important locus
[9,10]. Although the bovine TRB locus sequence in the
third bovine genome assembly is incomplete, the analysis
conducted in the present study has provided insight into
the nature of the bovine TRB gene repertoire and its
genomic organisation and evolution.
The most striking result from the study was the large
number of TRBV genes identified (134) which is over
twice the number found in humans and four times that in
mice [11,12]. Although 11 of the 24 bovine subgroups
identified in the genome contain multiple genes, the
majority of the TRBV repertoire expansion is attributable
to the extensive membership of just 3 subgroups, TRBV6
(40 members), 9 (35 members) and 21 (16 members). By
comparison, the largest subgroups in humans are TRBV6
and TRBV7, with 9 members each, whilst in mice the only
multi-membered subgroups are TRBV12 and 13 with 3
members each. As in humans the expansion of the TRBV
repertoire has predominantly occurred through the tandem duplication of DNA blocks containing genes from
more than 1 subgroup [9,10]. Dot-plot analyses shows
that this duplication in the bovine is complex, leading to
the generation of 6 homology units ranging in size from

TRBV genes. Unequal cross-over (non-homologous meiotic recombination) between genome-wide repeats (e.g.
SINEs, LINEs and LTRs) has been proposed to act as the
substrate for such duplication events in TR loci [9].
Although genome-wide repeats are found in the DNA surrounding the bovine TRBV genes (Additional file 3), as in
the human TRB locus they are only rarely found at the

boundaries of duplicated homology units (data not
shown), suggesting their contribution to mediating duplication is minimal [10].
Although gene conversion of TRBV genes has been documented [56], as with other multi-gene families in the
immune system, TRBV genes predominantly follow a
'birth-and-death' model of evolution [13,57,58], by

which new genes are created by repeated gene duplication, some of which are maintained in the genome whilst
others are deleted or become non-functional due to mutation. Genes maintained following duplication are subject
to progressive divergence, providing the opportunity for
diversification of the gene repertoire. Gene duplication
within the TR loci has occurred sporadically over hundreds of millions of years with ancient duplications
accounting for the generation of different subgroups and

more recent duplications giving rise to the different members within subgroups [9,59]. The continuous nature of
duplication and divergence of bovine TRBV genes is evident in the multi-membered subgroups where nucleotide
identity between members ranges between 75.5% and
100%. The complete identity observed between some
TRBV genes suggests that some of the duplication events
have occurred very recently. Similar features have been
described for the murine TRA and human IGκ loci, within

Page 14 of 20

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:192

which recent duplications, < 8 million years ago (MYA),
have created pairs of V genes exhibiting ~97% nucleotide
identity [9,60,61]. Southern blot data showing differences
in RFLP banding patterns of TRBV9 and 27 genes in DNA
from Bos indicus and Bos taurus animals (Figure 1c), which
only diverged between 0.25 – 2 million years ago [62-64],
provides further evidence of recent evolutionary development of the TRBV repertoire in cattle.
The distribution of TRBV genes over 5 scaffolds and the
presence of > 180 Kb of undetermined sequence within
two of the scaffolds indicate that characterisation of the
genomic TRBV repertoire remains incomplete. Comparison with cDNA sequences data indicates that the number
of undefined genes is substantial – only 36/86 (42%) of
TRBV genes identified from cDNA analysis have corresponding identical sequences in Btau_3.1. Most of the
identified TRBV genes missing from the assembly are
members of the large subgroups TRBV6, 9, 19, 20, 21 and
29, further enhancing their numerical dominance.
Although it is anticipated that completion of the TRB
locus sequence will incorporate significant numbers of
additional TRBV genes, the possible existence of insertiondeletion related polymorphisms (IDRPs), which can lead
to intra-species variation in genomic TRBV gene repertoires as described in human and murine TRB loci [6568], may result in some of the genes identified in cDNA
being genuinely absent from the sequenced bovine
genome
The proportion of TRBV pseudogenes in Btau_3.1 is 41%,
comparable to that seen in both humans (29%) and mice
(40%), suggesting that the 'death rate' in TRBV gene evolution is generally high [58]. Pseudogene formation has
occurred sporadically throughout the evolution of TRBV
genes, with genes that have lost function tending to subsequently accumulate further lesions [9]. The majority of
bovine TRBV pseudogenes (57%) contain a single lesion
and thus appear to have arisen recently; the remaining
43% have multiple lesions of varying severity and complexity (Additional file 2). In addition to pseudogenes we
also identified 7 sequences showing limited local similarity to TRBV genes in Btau_3.1 (Figure 2 – open boxes).
Such severely mutated TRBV 'relics', 22 of which have
been identified in the human TRB locus [10]., are considered to represent the remnants of ancient pseudogene formation.
In contradiction to a previous report [39], the repertoire of
functional TRBV genes in Btau_3.1 exhibits a level of phylogenetic diversity similar to that of humans and mice.
Phylogenetic groups A and E are over-represented in all 3
species, which in humans and cattle is largely attributable
to expansion of subgroups TRBV5, 6, 7 and 10 and TRBV6,
9 and 21 respectively; in mice the expansion of subgroups

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/192

TRBV12 and 13 make a more modest contribution to this
over-representation. Much of the expansion of human
subgroups TRBV5, 6 and 7 occurred 24–32 MYA [13] and
similarly, as described above, in bovines much of the
expansion of subgroups TRBV6, 9 and 21 subgroups
appears to be very recent. As these expansions have
occurred subsequent to primate/artiodactyl divergence
(~100MYA) [69], over-representation of phylogenetic
groups A and E must have occurred as parallel but independent events in these lineages, raising interesting questions about the evolutionary pressures that shape the
functional TRBV repertoire.
In contrast to the wide variation in the organisation of
TRBD, TRBJ and TRBC genes in the TRB locus seen in nonmammalian vertebrates [70-74], in mammals the arrangement of tandemly located DJC clusters is well conserved
[10,35,36,75,76]. Although most placental species studied have 2, variation in the number of DJC clusters has
been observed, with unequal cross-over events between
TRBC genes usually invoked as the most likely explanation for this variation [36,77,78]. The results from this
study provide the first description of the entire bovine
DJC region and confirm that like sheep, cattle have 3 complete DJC clusters [36,37]. Dot-plot and sequence analyses indicate that unequal crossover between the ancestral
TRBC1 and TRBC3 genes led to duplication of a region
incorporating TRBC1, TRBD3 and TRBJ3 genes, generating the DJC2 cluster. The similarity with the structure of
the ovine DJC region suggests that this duplication event
occurred prior to ovine/bovine divergence 35.7 MYA [69].
As with duplication of TRBV genes, expansion of TRBD
and TRBJ gene numbers has increased the number of
genes available to partake in somatic recombination – the
3168 different VDJ permutations possible from the functional genes present in Btau_3.1 is considerably more
than that for either humans (42 × 2 × 13 = 1092) or mice
(21 × 2 × 11 = 462). Interestingly, the sequence of bovine
TRBD1 gene is the first TRBD gene described that doesn't
encode a glycine residue (considered integral to the structure of the CDR3β) in all 3 reading frames [79]. However,
analysis of cDNA reveals evidence of expression by functional TRB chains of TRBD1in the reading frame that
doesn't encode a glycine but have generated a glycine
codon by nucleotide editing at the VJ junction (data not
shown).
In contrast to TRBV, TRBD and TRBJ genes which encode
products that bind to a diverse array of peptide-MHC ligands, TRBC gene products interact with components of
the CD3 complex which are non-polymorphic. Consequently, due to structural restrictions TRBC genes are subject to concerted evolutionary pressures with intra-species
homogenization through gene conversion evident in both
humans and mice [9,80]. Similarly, the bovine TRBC

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:192

genes were found to encode near identical products, most
likely as a result of gene conversion, although in the case
of TRBC1 and TRBC2 genes this more probably reflects
minimal divergence following duplication.
Comparison with the human and murine sequences
shows that non-coding elements that regulate TRB expression, such as the Eβ, promoters and RSs are highly conserved in the bovine. This is consistent with work
demonstrating that the critical role of RSs has enforced a
high level of evolutionary conservation [70,73,74,81] and
that Eβ and PDβ1 sequences are well conserved in eutherian species [36,52]. Although transcriptional factor binding sites are less well conserved in the putative PDβ1 than
the Eβ sequence, the Ikaros/Lyf-1 and Ap-1 binding sites
of the PDβ1, which are vital in enforcing stage-specific
(i.e. Dβ-Jβ prior to Vβ-DβJβ recombination) are conserved
[53,82]. Our analysis of putative TRBV promoter elements
was restricted to the well described CRE motif [9,10,54].
However, TRBV promoters are complex and expression of
TRBV genes whose promoters lack the CRE motif is maintained through the function of other transcriptional factor
binding sites [83]. A more detailed analysis of the bovine
TRBV promoters would be interesting given the potential
influence this may have on shaping the expressed TRBV
repertoire [25], but is beyond the scope of the current
study.
The portion of the bovine TRB locus described in Btau_3.1
encompasses > 730 Kb of sequence (excluding the regions
of undetermined sequence in Chr4.003.105 and
Chr4.003.108). Thus, although incomplete, the bovine
TRB locus is larger than that of either humans (620 Kb) or
mice (700 Kb), mainly as a consequence of the duplications leading to the dramatic expansion of the V genes. In
contrast to V genes, duplication of trypsinogen genes
within the TRB locus is more limited in the bovine (Figure
2), where only 5 trypsinogen genes were identified, compared to the human and murine where more extensive
duplication has lead to the presence of 8 and 20 trypsinogen genes respectively. Despite the differences in duplication events, the organisation of both TR and non-TR genes
within and adjacent to the TRB locus exhibits a striking
conserved synteny between cattle, humans and mice
[9,84]. Indeed, the organisation of genes within the TRB
locus and its position relative to adjacent loci is ancient,
with marked conserved synteny also demonstrated
between eutherian and marsupial mammalian species
and, to a large extent, chickens [9,75]. Given the evidence
for conserved synteny of TRBV gene organisation despite
dissimilar duplication/deletion events between mice,
humans and cattle, the results of the analysis completed in
this study suggest that several subgroups including
TRBV1, 2, 17, 22 and 23, which were not identified in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/192

genome assembly or from cDNA sequences, may have
been deleted from the bovine genome (Figure 9). Conservation of synteny would predict that the genomic location
of the TRBV27 gene identified from cDNA analysis will be
within the region of undetermined sequence in
Chr4.003.108 between the TRBV26 and 28 genes (Figure
9).

Conclusion
The primary purpose of this study was to analyse the
sequence data made available from the third bovine
genome assembly to gain a better understanding of the
bovine TRB gene repertoire and the organization and evolution of the bovine TRB locus. The results of this analysis
have shown that: (1) the bovine TRBV genomic repertoire
has been dramatically expanded through a complex series
of duplication events and although incomplete, is the
largest described to date. These duplication events have
led to massive expansion in the membership of certain
TRBV subgroups, particularly TRBV6, 9 and 21; (2) duplication has generated 3 DJC clusters compared to 2 in
humans and mice; (3) the elements that regulate TRB
expression and the organisation of genes within and adjacent to the TRB loci exhibit high levels of conservation
between humans, mice and cattle. (4) cDNA evidence
indicates that a substantial number of TRBV genes, predominantly from the larger subgroups are absent from the
current assembly.
Notwithstanding the incomplete assembly of the TRB
locus, the results of these analyses clearly demonstrate
that cattle possess a phylogenetically diverse repertoire of
functional TRB genes that is substantially larger than that
described for other species. These findings, together with
emerging evidence of similar expansions of gene repertoires for other TR chains in ruminants [85,86] suggest
that strong evolutionary pressures have driven a generic
enlargement of TR gene numbers, and thus greater potential TR diversity, in the ruminant lineage. Further studies
are required to define the full extent of these expansions
and to understand their evolutionary basis.

Methods
Analysis of the genome
The third bovine genome assembly (Btau_3.1) was
retrieved directly from the sequencing centre involved in
the Bovine Genome Project [87]. Sequences of bovine
TRB genes identified from cDNA analysis [31-34,88] and
human and murine TRB genes derived from GenBank
sequences [GenBank:U66059–U66061] and [GenBank:AE000663–AE000665] respectively were compared
to Btau_3.1 using the BLASTN algorithm tool on the
Ensembl website [89]. The locations of the TRB genes
identified in Btau_3.1 are provided in Additional file 1.

Sequence analysis
Basic sequence analysis such as CLUSTALW alignments
[90] and translations were conducted using the DNAsis
Max v2.7 programme (MiraiBio, Alameda, CA, USA).
Comparison of human and genomic bovine TRBV
sequences was completed using the IMGT/V-QUEST programme [91] available through the IMGT homepage,
http://imgt.cines.fr[92,93]. Dot-plot analyses were completed using dotter programme [94] and dottup programme from EMBOSS [95]. Genome wide repeats were
analysed using the RepeatMasker programme [96].
Sequence logos in Figures 10 and 11 were generated using
the Weblogo programme [97].

To be considered functional TRBV gene segment
sequences were required to maintain i) splice sites appropriate for RNA editing, ii) open reading frames, which
include codons for the conserved cysteine, tryptophan
and cysteine residues at positions 23, 41 and 104 (IMGT
unique numbering system [43]) respectively and iii) a 23RS compatible with somatic recombination [98,99].
Nomenclature
As the sequence of the TRB locus was incomplete, it was
not possible to fully implement the IMGT nomenclature
system which requires knowledge of the genomic order of
genes from the 5' to 3' end of the locus [100]. Genomic
bovine TRBV gene subgroups have been named according
to the orthologous subgroups in humans and members of
subgroups have been given an alphabetic rather than
numeric description to avoid confusion with previously
published cDNA data [32]. The DJC region of the locus
appears complete and so the TRBD, TRBJ and TRBC have
been named according to their 5' to 3' order in the
genome.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the nucleotide
sequences of functional TRBV genes (coding sequences)
and TRBJ genes (coding sequence + RS) of humans, mice
and bovine as identified in Btau_3.1. Neighbour-joining
method [101] analysis was performed with the MEGA4
software [102,103], using the uncorrected nucleotide differences (p-distance), which is known to give better results
when a large number of sequences which contain a relatively small number of nucleotides are examined [104].
Maximum likelihood analysis was performed under a
variety of substitution models (Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2parameter, Felenstein 81, Felenstein 84, Tamura-Nei 93
and General Time Reversible) as implemented by the
PHYML programme [105,106], using the phylogenetic
tree produced by NJ analysis as the primary tree. In each
case the reliability of the resulting trees was estimated by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/192

the approximate Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT) method
[107].
Southern blot and cDNA analysis
Southern blots were performed as described in Houston et
al. [32]. Analysis of bovine TRB cDNA expression
included use of the methods described in previous studies
[31-33,88]. cDNA sequences for bovine TRBV genes were
derived from sequences submitted to public databases:

open-reading frame (ORF) pseudogenes as their reading frame is maintained, the lesions causing their predicted loss of function resulting either
in the loss of a conserved residue or loss of a consensus 23-RS.
