Abstract
Background: Gene gain and subsequent retention or loss during evolution may be one of the
underlying mechanisms involved in generating the diversity of metazoan nervous systems.
However, the causal relationships acting therein have not been studied extensively.
Results: We identified the gene PsGEF (protostome-specific GEF), which is present in all the
sequenced genomes of insects and limpet but absent in those of sea anemones, deuterostomes, and
nematodes. In Drosophila melanogaster, PsGEF encodes a short version of a protein with the C2 and
PDZ domains, as well as a long version with the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains through alternative
splicing. Intriguingly, the exons encoding the RhoGEF domain are specifically deleted in the Daphnia
pulex genome, suggesting that Daphnia PsGEF contains only the C2 and PDZ domains. Thus, the
distribution of PsGEF containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains among metazoans appears to
coincide with the presence of mushroom bodies. Mushroom bodies are prominent neuropils
involved in the processing of multiple sensory inputs as well as associative learning in the insect,
platyhelminth, and annelid brains. In the adult Drosophila brain, PsGEF is expressed in mushroom
bodies, antennal lobe, and optic lobe, where it is necessary for the correct axon branch formation
of alpha/beta neurons in mushroom bodies. PsGEF genetically interacts with Rac1 but not other Rho
family members, and the RhoGEF domain of PsGEF induces actin polymerization in the membrane,
thus resulting in the membrane ruffling that is observed in cultured cells with activated forms of
Rac.
Conclusion: The specific acquisition of PsGEF by the last common ancestor of protostomes
followed by its retention or loss in specific animal species during evolution demonstrates that there
are some structural and/or functional features common between insect and lophotrochozoan
nervous systems (for example, mushroom bodies), which are absent in all deuterostomes and
cnidarians. PsGEF is therefore one of genes associated with the diversity of metazoan nervous
systems.

Background
A comparison of the genomes of five insects and five vertebrates revealed that there were approximately 1,000
genes present in all the insects but absent in the vertebrates. In contrast, there were approximately 5,000 genes
present in all the vertebrates but absent in the insects [1].
The number of vertebrate-specific genes is five times larger
than that of insect-specific genes, thus indicating that vertebrates have more complex gene pools than insects.
Some of these genes have been acquired in order to support insect- and vertebrate-specific characteristics during
evolution. However, if some of these vertebrate genes are
shared with lophotrochozoans (the third large superphylum of Bilateria), this would imply that they were present
in the last common ancestor of Bilateria (Urbilateria) and
have been lost from insects during evolution [2,3]. A
number of genes categorized to this group have already
been reported and characterized [4]. Meanwhile, if some
of these insect genes are shared with lophotrochozoans,
this would suggest that they were specifically acquired by
the last common ancestor of protostomes but not deuterostomes. Such genes have not been reported to date.
The origin and evolution of the metazoan central nervous
system (CNS) have been intensively discussed. Large-scale
expression analysis of neural genes in hemichordates has
revealed that the mediolateral patterning genes (Pax6, dbx,
and msx) and neural differentiation markers are expressed
around the circumference of the embryo [5,6]. These
results suggest that the centralization of a nervous system
was acquired independently in deuterostomes and protostomes [7]. Meanwhile, several studies on the development of the CNS in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse
have revealed common genetic patterning mechanisms in
the formation of the insect and vertebrate brain. In both
insects and vertebrates, the correct regionalization and
neuronal identity of the anterior brain region is regulated
by the cephalic gap genes otd/Otx and ems/Emx, whereas
patterning of the posterior brain involves members of the
Hox genes [8]. A recent study on gene expression patterns
in the brain of developing annelids (Platynereis) has demonstrated that the patterning mechanism of the CNS is
well conserved among chordates and annelids [9]. These
studies strongly indicate that Urbilateria already had an
anatomically complex CNS. Furthermore, cross-species
comparisons of genome sequences and expressed
sequence tag data sets have demonstrated the presence of
a common ancestral CNS at the molecular level [3,10].
These results suggest that Urbilateria and the last common
ancestor of protostomes were genetically complex, and
have complex nervous systems [4].
Mushroom bodies (MBs) are lobed neuropils that comprise long and approximately parallel axons originating
from clusters of minute basophilic cells located dorsally in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

the most anterior neuromere of the CNS. Structures with
these morphological properties are found in many marine
annelids (lophotrochozoa) and almost all arthropods
(ecdysozoa) except crustaceans [11]. MBs are higher multisensory centers (for example, olfaction and vision) of
the insect brain and are implicated in olfactory and other
forms of associative learning [12]. There are two possibilities regarding the presence of MBs in different animal lineages (arthropod groups except crustacea and
lophotrochozoa). One possibility is that the ancient MBlike structure was present in the CNS of the last common
ancestor of all protostomes, and then some species have
evolved the present MBs but the others have lost it secondarily during evolution. Another possibility is that MBs
have independently evolved several times in different animal lineages by convergent evolution. It was reported that
several genes encoding transcription factors, eyeless (ey),
twin of eyeless (toy), and dachsund (dac), are necessary for
the development of the Drosophila MB [13-15]. Their
homologs are present in various metazoan genomes, and
Pax6 (the vertebrate homolog of ey), for example, also has
essential roles for neural development [16]. To prove the
single origin of MBs, it will be necessary to demonstrate
that the expression domains of the above genes are conserved in the arthropod and lophotrochozoan CNS during development.
Here, we report a novel gene, namely PsGEF (GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor), which is present in
insect and Lottia (lophotrochozoa) genomes but absent in
Nematostella (cnidaria), deuterostome, and nematode
genomes. It is likely that PsGEF was specifically acquired
by the last common ancestor of protostomes, and then
lost in some species, for example nematodes. Intriguingly,
the presence of PsGEF containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains appears to coincide with the presence of
MBs. Further, in Drosophila, PsGEF functions as a GEF for
Rac and is essential for axon development in MBs. These
results suggest that gain, retention, and loss of PsGEF are
associated with some structural and/or functional features
common between insect and lophotrochozoan nervous
systems, which are absent in all deuterostomes and cnidarians. Thus, PsGEF is one of candidate genes associated
with the diversity of metazoan nervous systems.

Results
Identification of PsGEF gene uniquely shared between
insects and limpets
A large-scale comparison of the genomes of five insects
(D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, Apis mellifera, and Tribolium castaneum) and five vertebrates (Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Monodelphis domestica, Gallus gallus,
and Tetraodon nigroviridis) revealed that there were
approximately 1,000 insect-specific orthologous genes
[1]. We searched among these genes for those that are

highly expressed in the Drosophila CNS by screening transgenic lines in which GAL4 was inserted in the promoter
regions of candidate genes, in order to understand the
genetic basis for the development and functions specific
for the insect nervous system. From the screening, we
found one gene, the PsGEF gene (CG14045).
Drosophila PsGEF (DmPsGEF) encodes a protein with the
C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains (Figure 1B). The C2
domain is a Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting module
found in many proteins involved in signal transduction or
membrane trafficking [17]. It is thought to be involved in
Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding and in membranetargeting processes [18]. The PDZ domain mediates binding with other proteins and is found in many signaling
proteins frequently associated with the plasma membrane
[19]. Moreover, it is often associated with scaffolding proteins important for synaptic development [20]. The RhoGEF domain activates Rho family GTPases, namely, Rho,
Rac, and Cdc42, through release of bound guanosine
diphosphate and subsequent binding of guanosine triphosphate [21]. Thus, RhoGEF activity of PsGEF appears
to require an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level as well
as association of PsGEF with other proteins. As shown in
Figures 1A and 1B, two different DmPsGEF transcripts
(short and long mRNAs consisting of four and seven
exons, respectively) are found. The short mRNA encodes a
786-amino acid protein containing the C2 and PDZ
domains, and the long mRNA encodes a 1493-amino acid
protein containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains.
These two types of DmPsGEF mRNAs appear to be synthesized by alternative polyadenylation; polyadenylation at
the 3' end of exons 4 and 7 results in the synthesis of short
and long DmPsGEF mRNAs, respectively (Figure 1A). The
short PsGEF with C2 and PDZ domains exhibits significant similarity to the vertebrate RGS3, which also contains
C2 and PDZ domains [22]. However, PsGEF lacks amino
acid sequences necessary for constituting the regulator of
G-protein signaling (RGS) domain together with the C2
and PDZ domains, thus suggesting that the short PsGEF
does not function as an RGS.
DmPsGEF orthologs are also present in the genomes of
Nasonia vitripenis (parasitic wasp), Pediculus humanus corporis (human body louse), and Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea
aphid). The proteins encoded by these contain C2, PDZ,
and RhoGEF domains, similar to the long version of the
DmPsGEF. PsGEF was therefore present in the common
ancestor of holometabolous and hemimetabolous
insects. Further, we searched for insect PsGEF orthologs in
the genomes of Nematostella vectensis (sea anemone, cnidaria), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin), Ciona
intestinalis (sea squirt), Lottia gigantea (limpet, lophotrochozoa), and Caenorhabditis elegans. We have found that
only Lottia contains an insect PsGEF ortholog coding for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

protein containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains. As
PsGEF has a complex domain organization, it may be difficult to identify the orthologs if they contain very large
introns in some cases. PsGEF is present in insects (ecdysozoa) and limpet (lophotrochozoa) but not sea anemone
or deuterostomes, suggesting that PsGEF was specifically
acquired by the last common ancestor of protostomes.
Drosophila (DmPsGEF), Tribolium (TcPsGEF), Pediculus
(PhcPsGEF), Apis (AmPsGEF), and Lottia (LgPsGEF)
PsGEFs (Additional file 1) share the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains as shown in Figure 1C. The alignment of
amino acid sequences containing the above functional
domains of five PsGEF proteins demonstrates that they
show significant similarity only in the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains (Additional file 2). This was also the case
when the full-length amino acid sequences were analyzed
(data not shown).
The exon-intron organizations of the above five PsGEF
genes are shown in Figure 2A. Insect and limpet PsGEFs
contain one and two introns in the C2 domain-coding
regions, respectively. Intriguingly, the position of one out
of two introns is conserved at the same phase in five species (Figure 2B). Nevertheless, the size of this particular
intron is varied, ranging from 562 to 2,482 base pairs.
DmPsGEF has no intron, TcPsGEF and AmPsGEF have one
intron, and PhcPsGEF and LgPsGEF contain two introns in
the PDZ domain-coding regions (Figure 2A). TcPsGEF,
PhcPsGEF, and LgPsGEF share one intron position as well
as phases among them (Figure 2C). DmPsGEF and LgPsGEF contain one intron, AmPsGEF has two introns, and
TcPsGEF and PhcPsGEF contain four introns in the RhoGEF domain-coding regions (Figure 2A). Among them,
one intron position is conserved at the same phase in
DmPsGEF, TcPsGEF, and PhcPsGEF. In addition, the positions and phases of two introns are conserved in TcPsGEF
and PhcPsGEF. Thus, TcPsGEF and PhcPsGEF share the
same positions and phases of three out of four introns
(Figure 2D). These results demonstrate that some but not
all intron positions are conserved at the same phase in the
C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domain-coding regions of five
PsGEFs from different species.
Daphnia PsGEF lacks RhoGEF domain
We next analyzed the PsGEF ortholog in Daphnia pulex,
which belongs to crustacea, one of major arthropod
groups. The PsGEF ortholog is present in scaffold 53 of the
Daphnia pulex genome assembly; however, the exons
encoding the RhoGEF domain are apparently missing
(Figure 3A). According to the JGI database [23], three predicted genes (SNAP_00018439, SNAP_00018441, and
SNAP_00018442) are present in this genomic region. A
SNAP_00018439 mRNA was detected by using reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
appears to encode the PsGEF protein containing only the

and LgPsGEF (amino acid 18 to 730) proteins are compared with those of DmPsGEF (amino acid 272 to 1132). The numbers

C2 and PDZ domains. SNAP_00018442, but not
SNAP_00018441 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, and it
encodes a novel protein with a PH-like domain (Figure
3B).
The above results indicate that PsGEF with the C2, PDZ,
and RhoGEF domains is specifically present in lophotrochozoan and insect genomes but not in crustacean
genomes. This distribution among metazoans accurately
coincides with the presence of MBs, prominent neuropils
involved in processing multiple sensory inputs as well as
associative learning in the insect, platyhelminth, and
annelid brains [11]. We therefore tested whether PsGEF
plays a role in the development or functions of MB in Drosophila.
Region-specific expression of DmPsGEF in the embryonic
and adult central nervous system
We identified several GAL4 enhancer trap lines (NP5114,
NP0264, NP1088, NP7169, NP3316, NP7265, NP3612,
and NP3237) located in the promoter region of DmPsGEF.
These GAL4 lines were crossed with UAS-mCD8-GFP lines
to detect the expression of DmPsGEF in embryos and
adults, and all of them exhibited the same expression patterns. DmPsGEF is expressed in the subsets of cells in the
brain and ventral nerve cord as well as cells at the midgut
fusion point in the stage-15 embryos (Figures 4A and 4B).
DmPsGEF is highly expressed in MBs, the antennal lobe,
and the optic lobe of the adult brain. In addition, there are
several large discrete DmPsGEF-positive cells surrounding
the antennal lobe (Figure 4C). The presence of DmPsGEFpositive lobes of MBs, as observed by staining for Fasciclin
II (Fas II), suggested that DmPsGEF is expressed in the
alpha/beta neurons of MBs (Figure 4D). AmPsGEF mRNA
is also highly expressed in the adult honey bee brain (data
not shown).

DmPsGEF is necessary for the axon development of
mushroom bodies
To understand the functions of DmPsGEF, we generated
DmPsGEF loss-of-function mutants by imprecise excision
of NP5114. Two deletion mutants were recovered. The
deletion mutants included dmPsGEFΔ55, in which 1.5 kb
genomic DNA containing the promoter region is deleted,
and dmPsGEFΔ21, in which 2.7 kb genomic DNA containing exons 1 and 2 is deleted (Figure 5A). Both dmPsGEFΔ55
and dmPsGEFΔ21 are viable and fertile with no morphological defects. The expression of DmPsGEF mRNA was examined in NP5114, dmPsGEFΔ55, and dmPsGEFΔ21 embryos
by RT-PCR. Both short and long mRNAs are expressed in
the NP5114 embryos; however, they are absent in
dmPsGEFΔ55 and dmPsGEFΔ21 embryos. The adjacent
CG14047 mRNA is equally expressed in all embryos (Figure 5B). These results suggest that both dmPsGEFΔ55 and
dmPsGEFΔ21 are DmPsGEF-null alleles.

Since DmPsGEF is highly expressed in the alpha/beta neurons of MBs (Figures 4C and 4D), we analyzed the morphology of the alpha/beta lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21
hemizygous males by immunostaining of Fas II. The Fas
II-positive alpha/beta lobes are thinner in dmPsGEFΔ21
than in wild-type males (Figures 6A and 6B). Furthermore, the alpha lobes of late-born alpha/beta neurons visualized by 201Y-GAL4 and UAS-mCD8-GFP are thinner in
dmPsGEFΔ21 because the alpha lobes are often short, and
their positions along the beta lobes vary (Figures 6C to
6E). The same results were obtained for dmPsGEFΔ55 (data
not shown). We also analyzed the morphology of the
alpha'/beta' lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21 and wild-type males by
anti-Trio antibody staining [24]. No significant difference
was observed (data not shown).
For a more accurate analysis of the role of DmPsGEF in
the development of MBs, the morphology of alpha/beta
neurons at a single-cell level was examined by using the
mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM)

their axons into the alpha and beta lobes (Figure 6F);
however, 34% of late-born dmPsGEFΔ21 alpha/beta neurons (n = 35) have branching defects, and the axons
toward the alpha lobe are missing (Figures 6G and 6H).
These results demonstrate that DmPsGEF is necessary for
the correct axonal development of alpha/beta neurons in
MBs.

DmPsGEF genetically interacts with Rac1 but not other

As PsGEF is expected to function as a RhoGEF, we analyzed the genetic interactions of DmPsGEF with Rho family
members. We thus examined the morphology of the
alpha/beta lobes in the MBs of dmPsGEFΔ21 hemizygous
males in a rho1E3.10, rac1J11, rac2Δ, and mtlΔ heterozygous
background. For the interaction with Cdc42, dmPsGEFΔ21
homozygous females with a cdc424 heterozygous background were analyzed. It was observed that reducing the
gene dosages of Cdc42, Rho1, Rac2, and Mtl does not affect
the phenotypes of the alpha/beta lobes as observed with

The alpha lobes of late-born alpha/beta neurons are visualized by 201Y-Gal4 and UAS-mCD8::GFP in the wild-type (C) and dmPsGEFΔ21 mutants (D and E). The alpha lobes are thinner in
dmPsGEFΔ21 mutant than in the wild-type, as observed above. In addition, the alpha lobes are often short (magenta arrowhead

lobes are indicated by arrows in (C). Findings of the repressible cell marker analysis reveal that the axons of wild-type alpha/

dmPsGEFΔ21 (Figures 7A and 7C to 7G). However, reduction in the Rac1 gene dosage dramatically influences the
phenotypes: a pair of alpha/beta lobes was missing in
90% of the animals examined (Figure 7H). It was
observed that 65% of rac1J11/+ heterozygotes have normal
alpha/beta lobes (Figure 7B), and 35% have the branching defects as previously reported [26]. These results demonstrate that DmPsGEF genetically interacts with Rac1.
However, DmPsGEF does not exhibit genetic interaction
with Pak, which is a downstream effector of Rac1 (Figure
7I). This suggests that DmPsGEF activates Rac1; the active
GTP·Rac1 is involved in the axon development in MB
neurons via a Pak-independent signaling pathway.
DmPsGEF functions as a GEF for Rac in cultured cells
To test whether PsGEF is a GEF for Rac, the RhoGEF
domain of DmPsGEF was expressed in HeLa cells, and the
F-actin of these cells was visualized by using fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin. The RhoGEF activity of
PsGEF is likely to be affected by the intracellular Ca2+ level
as well as its interaction with other proteins through the
C2 and PDZ domains. Thus, only the RhoGEF domain of
DmPsGEF was expressed in the HeLa cells. Actin polymerization in membranes resulting in membrane ruffling is
specifically observed in the cells expressing the RhoGEF
domain of DmPsGEF (Figures 8C and 8F). These phenotypes are similar to those obtained with the expression of
active forms of Rac but not Cdc42 or Rho [27]. The active
forms of Cdc42 and Rho are known to induce filopodia
and stress fibers, respectively [28]. These results therefore
suggest that the RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF activates
Rac but not Cdc42 or Rho in cultured cells. This finding is
consistent with the genetic interaction of DmPsGEF with
Rac1 but not Cdc42 or Rho1, as described earlier.

Discussion
Genes specifically necessary for the development and/or
functions of the insect nervous system
We are interested in discovering the specific molecular
features underlying the functions of insect nervous systems. There are several properties specific to the insect
nervous system. One of the characteristics of the holometabolous insect brain is the development of the brain from
the larval to the adult stages during metamorphosis.
Although the overall brain organization is preserved during metamorphosis, dramatic remodeling of neuronal circuits occurs. Some embryonic and early larval neurons
die, and others undergo axon pruning and regrowth. Furthermore, many neurons are born during metamorphosis
[29]. The genes involved in neuronal remodeling and
metamorphosis might be specific to the insect genomes.
With regard to the structural characteristics of the insect
brain, MBs are specific neuropil structures found in many
marine annelids and almost all arthropod groups, except
crustaceans [11]. MBs are lobed neuropils that comprise

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

long and approximately parallel axons originating from
clusters of minute basophilic cells located dorsally in the
most anterior neuromere of the CNS. MBs are higher
olfactory and multisensory centers of the insect brain and
are implicated in odor discrimination and in olfactory
and other forms of associative learning [12]. It is not
known how MBs evolved in different taxa. There may be
some common genes among annelids and insects, and
they may have a role in the evolution of MBs. PsGEF may
be one of these genes.
Origin and evolution of PsGEF
We first identified PsGEF as an insect-specific gene, which
is highly expressed in the Drosophila CNS. It is present in
the sequenced genomes of insects but not vertebrates. A
search for PsGEF orthologs in other sequenced genomes
revealed that PsGEF is present in the parasitic wasp, the
human body louse, and, surprisingly, the limpet Lottia.
Due to the phylogenetic distance between insects and limpets, it is unlikely that PsGEF independently evolved in
these taxa. In fact, a domain-by-domain phylogenetic
analysis of RhoGEFs from different species demonstrates
that the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains of LgPsGEF cluster with those of insect PsGEFs, and do not branch with
those of different families (data not shown). Thus, it is
unlikely that PsGEFs have been independently generated
by exon shuffling (or exon capture) in the lophotrochozoan and insect lineages. The exon-intron structures of
five PsGEFs from different species also support this conclusion since the positions as well as phases of some
introns are conserved in the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF
domain-coding regions (Figure 2). This may suggest that
the last common ancestor of protostomes gained the
intron-rich ancestor of PsGEF, and some of these ancient
introns have been lost, and some new introns have been
gained in each species, as demonstrated with, for example,
nuclear OXPHOS genes [30].

Apparently, intron loss has been most extensive in DmPsGEF. PsGEF was absent in Urbilateria, and then specifically acquired by the common ancestor of all protostomes
but not deuterostomes or cnidarians. How was the
ancient PsGEF originated? Since vertebrates possess RGS3
with C2 and PDZ domains similar to the short form of
DmPsGEF, this gene was present in Urbilateria. It then
acquired the exons encoding the RhoGEF domain by exon
shuffling or exon capture from the different families to
generate PsGEF [31]. Intriguingly, PsGEF is absent in nematodes, suggesting that it has been secondarily lost from
some ecdysozoan species. Since it has been demonstrated
that the evolutionary rates of insects and nematodes are
fast and comparable [2,3,32], it is difficult to imagine that
nematodes evolved an alternative pathway or paralogs of
PsGEF to compensate for the absence of PsGEF and insects
failed to evolve such systems. A more plausible explana-

Figure 8
PsGEF functions as a GEF for Rac in cultured cells
PsGEF functions as a GEF for Rac in cultured cells. HeLa cells transiently transfected with DmPsGEF RhoGEF domain
expression constructs were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin to detect F-actin (A and D), and anti-myc antibodies were used to detect the RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF (B and E). The images A and B are merged to form image (C),
and the images D and E are merged to form image (F). Actin polymerization in membranes, which results in membrane ruffling,
is specifically observed in cells that express the RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF (arrowheads in C and F).

tion is that PsGEF has been selectively retained in the
insect and limpet genomes because it continues to play an
important role in these animals but not in nematodes.
An analysis of the Daphnia genome revealed that the
Daphnia PsGEF contains only the C2 and PDZ domains,
and it corresponds to the short form of DmPsGEF. The
exons encoding RhoGEF domains are apparently missing
in the Daphnia genome (Figure 3). This demonstrates that
the exons encoding the RhoGEF domain were specifically
deleted in crustaceans after split from a common ancestor
of crustaceans and insects [33,34]. These results suggest
that Daphnia PsGEF cannot function as a RhoGEF, which
is critical for MB axon development (Figure 7 and see
below). Thus, PsGEF containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains appears to be present only in the limpet Lottia and insects but not in crustaceans. Although it is not

known whether MB-like structures are present in the limpet brain, this distribution pattern among metazoans
coincides with the presence of MBs in the brains of certain
platyhelminthes, marine annelids, and insects but not
crustaceans [35]. These results suggest that PsGEF may be
associated with the evolution of MB-like brain structures
and is, in fact, necessary for MB axon development in Drosophila (Figure 6).
Molecular functions of PsGEF
Alternative splicing of DmPsGEF determines the presence
or absence of the RhoGEF domain in the protein (Figures
1A and 1B). The activation of Rac by PsGEF is therefore
directly regulated by alternative splicing. What are the
functions of the short version of PsGEF with only the C2
and PDZ domains, which is also present in Daphnia? If
both short and long PsGEFs are present in a single neuron,

Page 13 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2009, 7:21

the short protein may exert dominant negative effects on
the long protein. The short and long proteins may compete for binding with Ca2+ and certain proteins through
the C2 and PDZ domains, respectively. This, in turn, regulates the RhoGEF activity of the long PsGEF. If their
expression is mutually exclusive, they may have independent functions in different neurons. Since it is difficult
to distinguish the expression patterns of short and long
DmPsGEF mRNAs in Drosophila, an examination of the
functions of short PsGEF in Daphnia may provide an
answer to the abovementioned question. Although alternative splicing of PsGEF occurs in the fruit fly and honey
bee (data not shown), it remains to be established
whether the same alternative splicing occurs in other
insects and limpets.
Loss of DmPsGEF results in thinner alpha lobes than those
of wild-type (Figures 6 and 7). Furthermore, short and
multiple alpha lobes derived from late-born 201Y-Gal4expressing alpha/beta neurons were observed in MBs of
dmPsGEFΔ21 flies, as shown in Figures 6C to 6E. These
results suggest that the alpha/beta neurons bifurcate their
axons at more random positions in dmPsGEFΔ21 flies. Further, the dmPsGEFΔ21 alpha/beta neurons may not
respond well to the signals provided by guidance neurons
(the pre-existing alpha/beta neurons). Moreover, some
alpha/beta neurons fail to extend their alpha-axonal
branches (Figures 6F to 6H). Meanwhile, gamma neurons
appear to be normal. Alpha'/beta' neurons are generally
born during the late third instar, and their axons (alpha'/
beta' lobes) remain intact during metamorphosis [25].
These lobes may serve as the guiding axons for the bifurcation of the axons of alpha/beta neurons. We therefore
examined the alpha'/beta' lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21 flies by
immunostaining with anti-Trio antibody [24]. Their morphology was found to be normal, thus suggesting that
DmPsGEF is specifically necessary for the axonal development of alpha/beta neurons in MBs.
To identify Rho family members activated by PsGEF, we
first tested the genetic interaction of DmPsGEF with five
Rho family members. The results indicated that DmPsGEF
genetically interacts with Rac1 but not other family members (Figure 7). Consistent with this observation, the
ectopic expression of the RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF
induces actin polymerization in the membrane of HeLa
cells (Figure 8). These results thus suggest that PsGEF activates Rac but not Cdc42 or Rho in vivo. Intriguingly,
DmPsGEF does not genetically interact with Pak, one of
the downstream effectors of Rac (Figure 7I). Trio was
shown to activate Rac and promote LIM kinase activity via
Pak to induce axon growth inhibition [36]. Thus, DmPsGEF induces Rac activation and may stimulate axon
growth via a Pak-independent pathway along with Still
life (Sif) [36,37]. Three GEFs for Rac (Trio, Sif, and DmPs-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

GEF) appear to function for the morphogenesis of MBs in
Drosophila. Since each GEF protein has specific functional
domains (for example, Spectrin repeats and SH3 domain
in Trio, PH and PDZ domains in Sif) in addition to the
RhoGEF domain, the mechanism to activate individual
GEFs should be different. Specifically, the presence of the
C2 domain in PsGEF suggests that the increase of intracellular Ca2+ level is essential for the localization of PsGEF at
the plasma membrane where Rac proteins are anchored.
The function of DmPsGEF is therefore dependent on the
local increase of cytosolic Ca2+ level which occurs during
the axonal development of alpha/beta neurons in MBs.
DmPsGEF is expressed not only in the MBs but also in the
antennal and optic lobes in adult Drosophila brain. We
analyzed the axonal projection patterns of several olfactory neurons into the antennal lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21 flies;
however, no significant difference was observed relative to
the patterns observed in the wild-type (data not shown).
The glomerular structures of the antennal lobes visualized
by immunostaining with anti-nc82 antibody were found
to be normal (data not shown). Although we did not
observe gross morphological defects in the antennal and
optic lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21 flies, it is possible that there
were subtle defects in these brain regions. No other proteins with C2 and PDZ domains are present besides
DmPsGEF in Drosophila. However, other GEFs for Rac
(Trio and Sif) could be partially redundant with DmPsGEF. This may explain the lack of phenotypes associated
with the antennal lobes in dmPsGEFΔ21 flies. We are also
testing the olfactory and visual behaviors of adult
dmPsGEFΔ21 flies at present.
Association of PsGEF with structural and/or functional
features common between insect and lophotrochozoan
nervous systems
The specific acquisition of PsGEF by the last common
ancestor of protostomes followed by the retention or loss
in specific animal species during evolution demonstrates
that there are some structural and/or functional features
common between insect and lophotrochozoan nervous
systems, which are absent in all deuterostomes and cnidarians. We would like to propose that PsGEF may be
associated with the presence of MBs, specific brain structures in insects, annelids, and platyhelminthes [35]. The
fact that PsGEF containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF
domains is specifically retained in animals having MBs
(for example, insects but not crustaceans in arthropods)
in addition to functioning as a GEF for Rac, which is
essential for the correct axonal development of MBs in
Drosophila, suggests that the last common ancestor of protostomes might have possessed an ancient MB-like structure in the nervous system, and the MBs found in present
animals may have evolved into specific neuropil structures in insect and lophotrochozoan brains supported in

Page 14 of 18

BMC Biology 2009, 7:21

part by the retention of PsGEF in their genomes during
evolution. Nematodes and crustaceans lost the full length
PsGEF, and MB-like structures have disappeared as a result
(Figure 9). However, the functions of PsGEF do not
appear to be limited to MBs because it is also expressed in
the optic and antennal lobes of adult Drosophila brain.
Although MB-like structures are found in mollusks such as
Achatina [38] and Octopus [39], it is not known whether
limpets also have MB-like structures in their brains. It is
thus possible that the conservation of PsGEF could be for
other functional and developmental constraints.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression profile and roles of genes patterning the nervous system in
the embryos of vertebrates and annelids are quite similar
[9]. Since it is unlikely that this remarkable similarity
arose from convergent evolution, they suggest that Urbilateria may have already had a quite complex CNS, which is
also supported by comparative genomics [3,10]. It is
therefore not surprising that the origin of MBs could be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

traced back to the last common ancestor of protostomes,
in which ancient MB-like structures might have played a
role in multimodal sensory integration and even learning
and memory. To prove a single origin of MBs, it will be
necessary to demonstrate that the same gene sets (for
example, ey, toy, and dac) act similarly for the development of MBs in insects and lophotrochozoans. The
homologs of these genes are also present in the vertebrate
genomes, and they function in the early development of
nervous systems. As these genes encode transcription factors, they could function as a common 'genetic code' to
specify the brain region, giving rise to MBs and its vertebrate equivalents. Then, as a next level, a different set of
genes such as PsGEF is necessary to generate the specific
structures of MBs, which are present in the brains of
insects and lophotrochozoans but not vertebrates. In this
regard, PsGEF is one of genes involved in generating the
diversity of metazoan nervous systems.

Conclusion
The specific acquisition of PsGEF by the last common
ancestor of protostomes followed by the retention or loss
in specific animal species during evolution demonstrates
that there are some structural and/or functional features
common between insect and lophotrochozoan nervous
systems (for example, MBs), which are absent in all deuterostomes and cnidarians. PsGEF is therefore one of
genes associated with the diversity of metazoan nervous
systems.

Methods
Screening of insect-specific genes highly expressed in the
Drosophila central nervous system
The identification of insect-specific orthologous genes has
been previously described [1]. Drosophila genes were analyzed using FlyBase [40] in order to identify those in
which GAL4 was inserted in their putative promoter
regions. These GAL4 enhancer trap lines were individually
crossed with UAS-mCD8::GFP; this was then followed by
examination of green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression patterns in their progenies. We identified one line,
namely, NP5114, which exhibits strong GFP expression in
the embryonic and adult Drosophila CNS (Figure 4). In
this line, GAL4 was inserted at a position 5' upstream of
the first exon of DmPsGEF (CG14045) on the X chromosome (Figure 5). Other GAL4 lines in which GAL4 was
inserted close to NP5114 (NP0264, NP1088, NP7169,
NP3316, NP7265, NP3612, and NP3237) exhibit the
same expression patterns, with variable intensities.
Identification of alternatively spliced DmPsGEF mRNAs
There is one DmPsGEF cDNA sequence deposited in an
NCBI database (RE74757). This sequence corresponds to
the short mRNA encoding DmPsGEF with the C2 and
PDZ domains; this was confirmed by RT-PCR and rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE). To verify the presence of long mRNAs encoding DmPsGEF with the C2,
PDZ, and RhoGEF domains, the corresponding fulllength cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR and then sequenced.
The obtained sequence is identical to the one predicted
from the genomic sequence (CG14045), except that a 108bp sequence is absent.
Bioinformatics
The amino acid sequences of TcPsGEF (GLEAN_01044),
AmPsGEF (GB16089-PA), PhcPsGEF (PHUM010260PA), and LgPsGEF (fgenesh2_pg.C_sca_68000085) were
retrieved from Baylor [41], BeeBase [42], VectorBase [43],
and JGI [44], respectively. The functional domains of each
protein were analyzed by NCBI CD search, and the
sequence alignment of five PsGEF proteins was done by
MEGA4 [45]. The genomic sequences of five PsGEF were
also retrieved from above databases and FlyBase.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/21

Genetics
DmPsGEF deletion mutants were generated by the imprecise excision of NP5114. Approximately 300 w female
revertants balanced with FM7 were individually crossed
with FM7 males to establish the lines. The B+ adult males
were collected from each line, and their genomic DNA
was analyzed by PCR with the following two primers,
namely, 5'-CACGGGATCTGCAGTGCAGACAACTCTT-3'
and 5'-CAATCGCAGCTGTCAGTTCGGGAGGTGC-3', to
identify the deletion mutants. The genomic PCR yielded a
7.5-kb band from the wild-type; thus, lines yielding bands
smaller than 7.5 kb were analyzed further. We identified
two large deletion mutants, namely, dmPsGEFΔ55 and
dmPsGEFΔ21, and their breakpoints were determined by
sequencing.

In order to visualize the alpha/beta lobes of MBs by GFP,
y, w, dmPsGEFΔ21; 201Y-GAL4 females were crossed with
UAS-mCD8::GFP males, and the resulting males were
examined. To analyze the genetic interaction of DmPsGEF
with Rac1, Rac2, Mtl, Rho1, and Pak, the y, w,
dmPsGEFΔ21females were crossed with y, w; rac1J11/CyO, y,
w; rac2Δ, y, w; mtlΔ/TM3, y, w; rho1E3.10/CyO, and y, w; pak6/
TM3 males. The resulting males were then examined. To
analyze the interaction of DmPsGEF with Cdc42, we
crossed FM7/y, w, dmPsGEFΔ21, cdc424 females with y, w,
dmPsGEFΔ21 males, and then the resulting B+ females were
analyzed. More than 30 animals were analyzed for each
case.
Single-cell MARCM clones (alpha/beta neurons) were
generated by heat-shocking late-stage pupae of y, w,
dmPsGEFΔ21, FRT19A/w, hs-FLP, tub-GAL80, FRT19A; UASmCD8::GFP/+; OK107/+ at 37°C for 45 min [25]. As the
wild-type control, y, w, FRT19A chromosomes were used.
Immunohistochemistry
The embryos were immunostained with rabbit anti-GFP
antibodies (1,000-fold dilution) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (300-fold
dilution) by using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and nickel
chloride as previously described [46]. The adult brains
were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
on ice for 3 h, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 0.5% TX-100 for 5 min, and then
blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for
30 min. They were then immunostained with 1D4 (4-fold
dilution), rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1,000-fold dilution),
Rhodamine anti-mouse IgG (300-fold dilution), and FITC
anti-rabbit IgG (300-fold dilution).
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from NP5114,dmPsGEFΔ55, and
dmPsGEFΔ21 embryos. Thereafter, cDNAs were synthesized
by using a reverse transcriptase (ReverTra Ace, TOYOBO).

PCR was carried out using the following primers: 5'ATGACACGGATGCATCGCCACTCCAGTT-3' and 5'-TTAGACGAAGACACCTTTGCCTACCTCC-3' (for DmPsGEF
short mRNA), 5'-ACCTTCAGCAAGGAGTCGATTGTGCCTG-3'
and
5'-CTGCAGTTCGTTGATAACCGTGCTAAAG-3' (for DmPsGEF long mRNA), and 5'TGAGCATGAGCGCCACCTCGGATATCTA-3' and 5'-TGAGACTGGCGGATCTAGATGACGTAGT-3' (for CG14047
mRNA). The resulting PCR products were sequenced to
verify their identities.

Figure S1. Alignment of amino acid sequences containing the C2, PDZ,
and RhoGEF domains of five PsGEF proteins. The amino acid sequences
containing the C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains of DmPsGEF (amino
acid 272 to 1132), TcPsGEF (amino acid 601 to 1313), PhcPsGEF
(amino acid 14 to 700), AmPsGEF (amino acid 595 to 1238), and LgPsGEF (amino acid 18 to 730) proteins are aligned by CLUSTALW program. The amino acid sequences of C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains are
highlighted by red, green, and blue, respectively. Identical amino acids are
indicated by asterisks, and the conserved amino acids are shown by either
dots or colons. Only C2, PDZ, and RhoGEF domains show the significant
similarity between five PsGEF proteins.

Total RNA was isolated from frozen samples of Daphnia
pulex, and the cDNAs were then synthesized as mentioned
above. PCR was carried out using the following primers:
5'-ATCGGCTCGCTACCTGAAATCCAACAGC-3' and 5'GTGACGCTTCCGCCTCCTGACGGTTTCT-3'
(for
SNAP_00018439 mRNA), 5'-ATGGCGGCCTCGTCTTCGGACCTTCAGG-3' and 5'-TCAAGTATCCTCGCAGCGTTCACCGAGT-3' (for SNAP_00018441 mRNA), and 5'GGTATCATGTCCGTGCAGCTGCACAAGT-3' and 5'CATCCATTTGACGGCGGATAAGGTCGAC-3'
(for
SNAP_00018442 mRNA). The resulting PCR products
were sequenced to verify their identities.
Ectopic expression of RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF in
HeLa cells
A DNA fragment encoding the RhoGEF domain of DmPsGEF was PCR-amplified using DmPsGEF long cDNA as a
template and the following primers: 5'-TTTTTGCGGCCGCATGAGCCGGCCGGCTACCGCATGCTCGG-3' and 5'TTTTTTAAGCTTACCAATATCACTCAGCGGCACCAGGGTG-3'. The resulting PCR product was digested with
NotI and HindIII and inserted at the sites of the
pCMVTag5A vector (Stratagene) that were treated with the
same restriction enzymes. The resulting expression construct was introduced into HeLa cells with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room
temperature for 15 min; this was followed by permeabilization and blocking as done before. The transfected cells
were detected by using rabbit anti-myc antibody (1,000fold dilution) and Rhodamine anti-rabbit IgG (300-fold
dilution), and the F-actin was stained using FITC-phalloidin.
